It's been six years since the last Harold and
Kumar movie, "Harold & Kumar Escape
from Guantanamo Bay," and the third
movie, "AVery Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas,"
openly acknowledges this gap. Unlike the second
movie, whose plot picked up about 60 seconds
after the first movie dropped off, the latest shows
us how our boys' lives turned out several years
later. Shockingly, in this clearly dystopian future,
Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are
no longer best friends. They haven't even seen
each other in the past year, and their divergence
has polarized their differences: Harold has
become a successful, married homeowner, while
Kumar has regressed into a reeking, unshaven
deadbeat. Of course, the movie follows the duo
as they reconnect and reignite the spark, because
no amount of time can break the bonds of
America's favorite bromance.
It is, predictably, this bromance that carries
the entire movie. Even when they're not being
charming, Harold and Kumar's insanely believ
able chemistry charms the socks off of the most

cantankerous of movie patrons. Some other
characters, however, were less appealing: after
their bro-breakup, Harold and Kumar found
replacement best pals, an intentionally unlike -

able couple of characters that take the whole
"unlikeable" bit too far.

Harold's new friend, Todd (Tom Lennon), is
a harmless white-bread father, lame enough to
abbreviate "screw you" to "S U." Kumar's neighbor
Adrian (played by Amir Blumenfeld, who essen
tially plays a louder version of his character on his
College Humor show) is a wildly abrasive, classic
college douchebag. Scenes with these two are con
sistently the lowest points of the entire movie.

These were bal
anced by some small but
clever details that made the
whole thing worth it: deci-

sions in wardrobe (at one point Kumar's shirt
reads "My Parents Went to Hawaii and All I Got
Was Molested By My Neighbors") and a moment
in which Kumar scoffs at a character who claims
to work for the White House (Penn is, of course,
on Obama's staff as Associate Director of the
White House Office of Public Engagement.)
Of course, because this is a Harold &
Kumar movie, there are moments that push fur
ther than anyone would expect. The film paro
dies that classic scene from "A Christmas Carol"
in which a character gets his tongue

stuck to an iced-over telephone
pole except it's not a tongue that

gets cemented to the cold metal, it's a penis. And
yes, you get to see it. The audience gave a collec
tive groan/gasp of horror as the tasteful camera
angle cut away to a very close zoom into the sad
little member itself, pink and alone in the cold. In
hindsight, I don't know why we were surprised.
For the most part, though, the movie man
aged to stay grounded in its obvious good
intentions. It helped that most of the jokes were
genuinely funny and occasionally laugh-out
loud hilarious. Those who enjoyed the previous
two movies will thoroughly appreciate this one,
and while I would never advocate the use of
illicit substances, I will go ahead and observe
that the movie could, potentially, be even fun
nier if one emulated the lifestyles of the protag
onists. I'm just saying.
