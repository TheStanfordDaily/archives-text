## Does realism interfere with good gameplay?

From only a few minutes into its
opening scene, I could tell that
Uncharted 3: Drake's
Deception wasn't going to stray far
from the formula that made its pred
ecessors so special. And why would it?
You can call Uncharted an Indiana
Jones knock-off, but developer
Naughty Dog has a knack for balanc
ing fantastical, Lucas-esque plotlines
with a solid, heartwarming founda
tion of very believable, very human
characters. At times, I almost feel
closer to Nate, Sully and Elena than I
do to some of my real-life friends
and I don't say that lightly.
But since completing the much
anticipating threequel last week, I've
been pondering a persistent and
troubling question. Sure, I under
stand that Uncharted's most com-

pelling feature has always been its
genuinely lovable (or despicable) cast
of characters, and I commend its cre
ators for going to unheard-of lengths
in fleshing out that intangibly
"human" element. Most of that
comes through in the ways you'd
expect, especially after playing
Uncharted 2: great voice acting, real
world dialogue, expressive faces and
natural body language.
All of that continues to be great
in Uncharted 3. At some point,
though, I wonder if that priority
interferes with Naughty Dog's ability
to deliver tight, responsive gameplay.
One of the staples in
Uncharted's bag of development
tricks is excellent motion capture
basically, an actor puts on a skin
tight, electronic suit that records his

or her movements
for use in the game.
It's a great way to
make convincing

animations without

too much effort, and in non-interac
tive cut-scenes, at least, I don't think
anyone would argue that more is bet
ter when it comes to mocap. But as
I'm dodging gunfire or escaping a
burning chateau, I'm not won over
by believable animations. I'm just
looking to get the hell out of there.
Consider that opening scene I
mentioned, an old-fashioned bar
brawl that shows off the game's over
hauled melee combat. If you push the
attack button in the right place, Nate
might grab a bottle or pool cue to
smash over some poor fool's head. It
sounds pretty good hell, I'd proba-

bly do the same thing if I
was in a tight spot. But in
execution, it slows down
the pace of the action and,
more damningly, removes

control from the player. The camera

cuts to a new angle, begging you to
soak in the sight of Nate slowly, delib
erately lifting a half-empty bottle of
beer off the table and cracking some
skulls. As the animation loop plays
out, the player has virtually no con
trol beyond "keep smashing" in
essence, you're hitting the "replay"
button on some motion capture by
actor Nolan North. I admit it's an
amusing touch, and you'll get back to
the traditional action soon enough.
But compared to the relatively
straightforward combat of Uncharted
2, it's almost like Naughty Dog is a
little too in love with its animations.
They want you to see it, and they

want you to see all of it.
It's more noticeable in the way
Nate moves about the environment.
Push the stick all the way forward,
and he saunters into a full jog at the
same pace you'd expect from your
typical 30-year-old dude. It looks
good, and it's quick enough to get
you where you need to go. But say
you come around a corner and run
into a shotgun-toting thug. You jam
the stick the other way, expecting an
immediate, game-like reversal of
momentum. Not so here. Nate shuf
fles to a stop, deliberately transfers his
weight, then starts to pick up speed in

the other direction. Yes, it looks good.
But by that point, you're already
nursing wounds.
Uncharted 3 is ultimately a mas
terful experience, but it's also a
reminder that in some ways, games

have it rough. A film director, assum
ing he has a decent actor, can create a
believable human character just by
pointing a camera at one. Books, too,
have the luxury of meticulous, word
for-word control. But inherently, a

game creator is forced to hand over
the reins if there's a bug or if an
animation looks silly in a certain con
text, the illusion is broken. I'll be glad
to see the day that believable anima
tion and tight controls can contribute
to immersion without tripping over
each other, but I don't think it's
arrived quite yet.

you come around a corner and run
into a shotgun-toting thug. You jam
the stick the other way, expecting an
immediate, game-like reversal of
momentum. Not so here. Nate shuf
fles to a stop, deliberately transfers his
weight, then starts to pick up speed in

the other direction. Yes, it looks good.
But by that point, you're already
nursing wounds.
Uncharted 3 is ultimately a mas
terful experience, but it's also a
reminder that in some ways, games

have it rough. A film director, assum
ing he has a decent actor, can create a
believable human character just by
pointing a camera at one. Books, too,
have the luxury of meticulous, word
for-word control. But inherently, a

game creator is forced to hand over
the reins if there's a bug or if an
animation looks silly in a certain con
text, the illusion is broken. I'll be glad
to see the day that believable anima
tion and tight controls can contribute
to immersion without tripping over
each other, but I don't think it's
arrived quite yet.
