Paying homage to film noir of a bygone
Hollywood era through its low-light
aesthetic and dramatic voiceovers, Clint
Eastwood's ambitious biopic "J. Edgar" is a
complex character study of the notorious
founding director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as J.
Edgar Hoover, the film recounts both his
achievements and abuses, interspersed with
glimpses of a little-known personal life, in
order to form a meditation on that gray area
between morality, justice and power.
In 1919, a 24-year-old Hoover (DiCaprio)
living in Washington, D.C., is inspired to join the
Department of Justice after witnessing the
incompetence of the investigators at the scene of
a terrorist bombing. Ambitious, smart and
socially awkward, Hoover quickly rises through
the ranks to become the FBl's founding director
a position he would hold for the next 37
years until his death. Loosely framed by an eld
erly Hoover dictating the history of the institu
tion to a younger agent, the story of "J. Edgar"
unfolds like a web, constantly jumping back and
forth across his long tenure but always linked by
DiCaprio's booming, authoritarian voice.
Early in his career Hoover champions the
widespread practice of fingerprinting, and

under his leadership the bureau transforms
from a nominal threat lacking proper jurisdic
tion to a political powerhouse. But with time
his actions are marked by a constantly intensi
fying determination bordering upon lunacy,
leading him to tap President Kennedy's phones,
attempt to blackmail Martin Luther King Jr.
out of accepting the Nobel Prize and even
manipulate the careers of his own agents when
they threaten to outshine him. Hoover's per-

sonal life is equally controversial, with the film
paying particular attention to his ever-evolving
relationships with his straight-laced mother
Annie (Judi Dench), devoted personal secretary
Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) and close col
league Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). Thus,
bit by bit, Hoover's many facets gradually come
into focus.
DiCaprio commands the screen as the
unflappable and unscrupulous pioneer, even

under varying lay
ers of prosthetic
makeup, which,
for the record, is
the most convinc-

ing use this reviewer has witnessed to date.
While his rendition of Hoover's distinct dic
tion may seem jarring and forced in voiceover,
it thankfully flows more naturally as scenes
play out. As Tolson Hoover's second in
command, best friend and, according to
rumors, gay lover Hammer provides a
decent foil. But if there is a supporting actor
nomination to be earned, it likely belongs to
Watts, whose subtle performance as Gandy is

more affecting.
It would be easy to attribute Hoover's
more distasteful actions to the old adage
"absolute power corrupts absolutely," but in
this case the situation is not clear-cut.
Thoroughly engrossing and more thoughtfully
crafted than most biopics, "J. Edgar" merely
provides hints and suggestions regarding its
subject while leaving the viewer to piece
together the final portrait.
