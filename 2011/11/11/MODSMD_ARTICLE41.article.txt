## 'Decoded' bridges rap and literature 
### â€“ isaac HALYARD contact isaac: ihalyard@stanford. edu 
In 2009, rapper Shawn
Carter, more commonly
known as Jay-Z, was a
guest on the HBO talk show,
"Real Time with Bill Maher."
The host gave the rapper a
bound copy of every lyric of
every song he had officially

released. The book was no mere pamphlet, but
a behemoth, putting a physical perspective on
the copious amount of writing lay-Z has done
since his first official album, "Reasonable
Doubt" (1996). Perhaps it's not surprising, then,
that Jay-Z's first published book, "Decoded," has
the flow of a well-studied author.
On Nov. 1 the expanded edition of Jay-Z's
book, "Decoded," hit the shelves. The book was
originally released in October last year and
quickly made its way onto The New York
Times Best Sellers List, but the expanded edi
tion, which includes three new "decodings" of
his songs and an extended afterward, arrived in

bookstores just this month.
Much of the book itself is an autobio
graphical account of Jay-Z's development as a
rapper. It has a very oratory feel a dialogue
between Jay-Z and the reader as he tells the
captivating stories of his career.
Jay-Z's tone is passionate and simple, giv
ing the account of his life a literary poise not
always expected from a man of his profession.
A great deal is covered in the roughly 300-page
account, ranging from his early days as a hus
tler in the Marcy Projects of Brooklyn to his
sold-out performances at Madison Square
Garden.
The real heartbeat of "Decoded," however,
is the interlacing of songs throughout the text,
adding an emphasis to the stories. The songs
vary from big hits like "99 Problems" to unre
leased tracks like "History." On the left side of
the page, the lyrics to selected songs are print
ed, and on the right are footnote citations
linked to specific lines within the song. In these

citations, Jay-Z
describes what
these lines mean
and the deeper
conceptual
thoughts and
reasoning behind
his use of them.

Through the
explanation of his
lyrics and the recounting of his stories, Jay-Z
decodes his life. He stresses the point that he,
and his lyrics, are often misunderstood or mis
interpreted by many listeners. By emphasizing
the idea that rap is poetry and by decoding cer
tain lyrics, he exhibits the deeper meaning
within the songs. The combination of relaxed
storytelling with this plethora of lyrics acts as a
window into understanding the passionate and
complex thoughts that shape Jay-
Z's life, and subsequently, his

music.

To farther illustrate the evocative
nature of his music, the aesthetic layout
of the book itself is a work of art.
Designed by Rodrigo Corral Design, the
book features numerous pictures and
graphics to add to the already vibrant
descriptions and narratives taking place.
The cover is a Rorschach inkblot, playing
nicely with the idea of decoding, and the
powerful meaning and interpretation that
can lie within.
Jay-Z may not be a well-published

author or hold a degree in classics from an
esteemed university, but after years of writing
verse after verse, he inarguably has writing
experience experience that "Decoded"
shows truly does count for something.
