## GOBBLE UP THE TURKEY DROP ROXY SASS 
### 
Thanksgiving is right around
the corner, and Roxy's already
got a craving. But it's not just
turkey and cranberry sauce that have
Roxy licking her lips, it's the prospect
of some of her favorite fall traditions
the Turkey Drop and encounters
with exes.
Roxy knows that many of
you have found yourself cuddling
with that cutie down the hall who
still has a boyfriend or girlfriend
back home you may call it "pla
tonic," but Roxy can assure you that
it's anything but. While Roxy likes
her men hard, not hard to get, she
was once a naive freshman, too, and
suggests you take heart.
Thanksgiving will give you the best
gift this side of Christmas (or
Hanukkah ... Roxy never discrimi
nates). The Pilgrims may have been
sexually repressed, but Roxy knows
you won't be come late November.
What's so great about

Thanksgiving, you might ask? Two
words: Turkey Drop. For the uniniti
ated among you, the Turkey Drop
refers to the inevitable demise of
long-distance, high school relation
ships when a couple is reunited over
Thanksgiving break. He may realize
that Skype has totally masked that
freshman 15. She may decide that the
spark has fizzled. Either way, Roxy
can always count on vulnerable,
newly single freshman boys to keep
her dead week alive and kicking.
There's another reason Roxy
likes to give... thanks every
November upon her return home: ex
sex. After Thanksgiving dinner, many
people have to unbutton their pants,
and Roxy is no exception she just
likes to get a little more out of the
deal. Roxy usually prefers exploring
new territory, but there are definite
perks to people who have already
been there and done that. And while
no one wants a repeat of the awk
ward groping that was high school
hookups, Roxy is a firm believer in
the merits of a college education:
between all the classes and p-sets,
she's managed to learn a thing or
two, and believe her, so have her exes.
Plus, someone has to put all that left
over Cool Whip to use ...
