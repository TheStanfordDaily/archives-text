## UNIVERSITY Pres. talks ROTC,GSB gift at FacSen Faculty talk pre-major advising, grad diversity 
### MARGARET RAWSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate heard reports on
graduate education and undergraduate
advising Thursday, as well as some sur
prising news from University President
John Hennessy: "Given the difficulties
of setting up a campus in New York
City, we've decided to become a foot
ball powerhouse," Hennessy dead
panned.
Hennessy went on to praise the
football program and encouraged fac
ulty to attend Saturday's game against
Oregon, as well as the ESPN College
Game Day filming early Saturday
morning at the Oval.
Hennessy also discussed the recent
announcement of a $l5O million gift to
the Graduate School of Business
(GSB) from Robert "Bob" King '6O
and his wife, Dorothy "Dottie" King.
He also updated the Senate on the fu
ture of the Reserve Officers' Training
Corps (ROTC) at Stanford. Last
spring, the Senate voted to invite the re
turn of ROTC to Stanford.
Hennessy said that because of
"budgetary difficulties the Department
of Defense faces," the University "will
probably end up exploring alternative
opportunities." These may include al
ternative options for students who cur
rently commute, forming a consortium
with area schools and the United States
Naval Academy or asking the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Standards and
Policies (C-USP) to consider granting
some academic credit to students who
take ROTC courses off-campus.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
also updated the Senate, discussing the
formation of a search committee in
light of Persis Drell's resignation from
her post as director of SLAC National
Accelerator Laboratory, as well as the
University's current financial outlook.
"The financial situation of the Uni
versity right now is very good,"
Etchemendy said. He added that the
budgetary committee plans to be cau
tious, as "we have no idea what the fu
ture holds."
"We probably won't be doing cuts .
.. but we won't be spending a lot of
money either," Etchemendy added.
Graduate Education
The Senate then heard the annual
report on graduate education, post
poned from last spring, by Vice Provost
for Graduate Education Patricia
Gumport.
