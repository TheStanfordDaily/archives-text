## UNIVERSITY Pres. talks ROTC,GSB gift at FacSen Faculty talk pre-major advising, grad diversity 
### MARGARET RAWSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate heard reports on
graduate education and undergraduate
advising Thursday, as well as some sur
prising news from University President
John Hennessy: "Given the difficulties
of setting up a campus in New York
City, we've decided to become a foot
ball powerhouse," Hennessy dead
panned.
Hennessy went on to praise the
football program and encouraged fac
ulty to attend Saturday's game against
Oregon, as well as the ESPN College
Game Day filming early Saturday
morning at the Oval.
Hennessy also discussed the recent
announcement of a $l5O million gift to
the Graduate School of Business
(GSB) from Robert "Bob" King '6O
and his wife, Dorothy "Dottie" King.
He also updated the Senate on the fu
ture of the Reserve Officers' Training
Corps (ROTC) at Stanford. Last
spring, the Senate voted to invite the re
turn of ROTC to Stanford.
Hennessy said that because of
"budgetary difficulties the Department
of Defense faces," the University "will
probably end up exploring alternative
opportunities." These may include al
ternative options for students who cur
rently commute, forming a consortium
with area schools and the United States
Naval Academy or asking the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Standards and
Policies (C-USP) to consider granting
some academic credit to students who
take ROTC courses off-campus.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
also updated the Senate, discussing the
formation of a search committee in
light of Persis Drell's resignation from
her post as director of SLAC National
Accelerator Laboratory, as well as the
University's current financial outlook.
"The financial situation of the Uni
versity right now is very good,"
Etchemendy said. He added that the
budgetary committee plans to be cau
tious, as "we have no idea what the fu
ture holds."
"We probably won't be doing cuts .
.. but we won't be spending a lot of
money either," Etchemendy added.
Graduate Education
The Senate then heard the annual
report on graduate education, post
poned from last spring, by Vice Provost
for Graduate Education Patricia
Gumport.
"I think we have tremendous vi
tality in graduate education at Stan
ford and it's only going to get bet
ter," Gumport said.
She cited what she sees as sys
temic challenges, "at the national
level as well as at the foreground for
Stanford," including graduate stu
dent diversity and tuition shortfalls.
Gumport cited that graduate en
rollment has increased 32 percent
since 1985, while undergraduate en
rollment has grown four percent.
Gumport highlighted her con
cern that in 1995 domestic Under-
Represented Minorities (URM)
represented 10.7 percent of the
graduate student population, while
today they represent only 9.3 per
cent.
"It makes us concerned," she
said. Gumport included many sta
tistics concerning diversity and par
ticularly stressed a large increase in
international students.
"I think the big story is the differ
ence in applications over this time,"
she said. Gumport cited that gradu
ate programs have seen an overall
increase in applications by 38 per
cent. International student applica
tions increased by 136 percent,
while
URM applications only increased
by 10 percent.
Gumport also discussed tuition
shortfalls concerning federal fund
ing and degree completion rate
across the different graduate
schools.
She noted that attrition is down
overall, with degree completion at
75 percent, but students who do
choose to leave are doing so later.
"We will save $7 million a year if
students who are going to leave any
way leave one year earlier," she
said.
Gumport highlighted the Diver
sifying Academia, Recruiting Ex
cellence (DARE) doctoral fellow
ship program and cited the need to
survey current and former graduate
students.
"We don't track placement and
outcomes for our graduate stu
dents," she said. "This is really a
problem."
On the topic of diversity,
Etchemendy said he hopes the re
cently announced collaboration
with the City College of New York
(CCNY) will help.
"CCNY is an incredibly diverse
institution," he said. "We are hoping
that this will provide us a pipeline."
Undergraduate advising
Dean of Freshmen and Under
graduate Advising and Associate
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9
presented a report to the Senate on
undergraduate pre-major advising.
"This is a very exciting time in
pre-major advising at Stanford Uni

versity," Lythcott-Haims said. "It
has been several years since the
Senate has heard about undergrad
uate advising."
She added that the topic "has
been a challenge for quite some
time."
Lythcott-Haims framed her
presentation around "what we
think" and "what students think."
She explained that problems in ad
vising may stem from some students
thinking they do not need advising,
or others who are too timid to seek
it out.
"Our undergraduates are the
least formed version of the self they
are becoming," she said, explaining
that it may be unreasonable to ex
pect freshmen to understand the
importance of advising at the offset.
Lythcott-Haims described the
latest iteration of undergraduate
pre-major advising.
Students now have two advisors,
their regional Academic Director
and Pre-Maj or Advisor. The Acade
mic Director (AD) program was pi
loted in 2004 and instituted across
the board in 2008.

Lythcott-Haims cited that suc
cessful recruitment has resulted in
80 more volunteer pre-major advi
sors, bringing the total to 310, with
33 percent members of the Acade
mic Council, 26 percent academic or
teaching staff and 41 percent non
teaching staff or affiliates. Students
are expected to meet with their pre
major advisors once each quarter
until they declare a major.
Last year 100 percent of the class
of 2014 met with their advisors four
times, during orientation and each
quarter, according to Lythcott-
Haims, in accordance with a new
rule that placed an enrollment hold
until students had met with their ad
visors.
Lythcott-Haims also listed goals
for the future, such as creating more
AD positions, creating advising ob
jectives, bringing more faculty
members on board and increasing
student and advisor satisfaction.
She also asked the Senate, in partic
ular, for feedback from those who
used to serve as pre-major advisors
but no longer participate.
"The tools that I used disap
peared," said mechanical engineer
ing professor Chris Edwards, who
used to serve as a pre-major advisor.
Edwards referenced cuts in sopho
more peer mentors and faculty
lunches that helped facilitate the
advising process.
"We get that," Lythcott-Haims
said, referencing the need for some
form of peer advising. "We're going
to bring that back."
"I became quite cynical about
it," said linguistics professor Tom
Wasow, citing difficulties he experi
enced as a pre-major advisor in cre
ating a positive experiences for stu
dents who lacked interest. "I see
what you're doing as turning that
around. I'm almost ready to sign
up."

.. but we won't be spending a lot of
money either," Etchemendy added.
Graduate Education
The Senate then heard the annual
report on graduate education, post
poned from last spring, by Vice Provost
for Graduate Education Patricia
Gumport.
"I think we have tremendous vi
tality in graduate education at Stan
ford and it's only going to get bet
ter," Gumport said.
She cited what she sees as sys
temic challenges, "at the national
level as well as at the foreground for
Stanford," including graduate stu
dent diversity and tuition shortfalls.
Gumport cited that graduate en
rollment has increased 32 percent
since 1985, while undergraduate en
rollment has grown four percent.
Gumport highlighted her con
cern that in 1995 domestic Under-
Represented Minorities (URM)
represented 10.7 percent of the
graduate student population, while
today they represent only 9.3 per
cent.
"It makes us concerned," she
said. Gumport included many sta
tistics concerning diversity and par
ticularly stressed a large increase in
international students.
"I think the big story is the differ
ence in applications over this time,"
she said. Gumport cited that gradu
ate programs have seen an overall
increase in applications by 38 per
cent. International student applica
tions increased by 136 percent,
while
URM applications only increased
by 10 percent.
Gumport also discussed tuition
shortfalls concerning federal fund
ing and degree completion rate
across the different graduate
schools.
She noted that attrition is down
overall, with degree completion at
75 percent, but students who do
choose to leave are doing so later.
"We will save $7 million a year if
students who are going to leave any
way leave one year earlier," she
said.
Gumport highlighted the Diver
sifying Academia, Recruiting Ex
cellence (DARE) doctoral fellow
ship program and cited the need to
survey current and former graduate
students.
"We don't track placement and
outcomes for our graduate stu
dents," she said. "This is really a
problem."
On the topic of diversity,
Etchemendy said he hopes the re
cently announced collaboration
with the City College of New York
(CCNY) will help.
"CCNY is an incredibly diverse
institution," he said. "We are hoping
that this will provide us a pipeline."
Undergraduate advising
Dean of Freshmen and Under
graduate Advising and Associate
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9
presented a report to the Senate on
undergraduate pre-major advising.
"This is a very exciting time in
pre-major advising at Stanford Uni

versity," Lythcott-Haims said. "It
has been several years since the
Senate has heard about undergrad
uate advising."
She added that the topic "has
been a challenge for quite some
time."
Lythcott-Haims framed her
presentation around "what we
think" and "what students think."
She explained that problems in ad
vising may stem from some students
thinking they do not need advising,
or others who are too timid to seek
it out.
"Our undergraduates are the
least formed version of the self they
are becoming," she said, explaining
that it may be unreasonable to ex
pect freshmen to understand the
importance of advising at the offset.
Lythcott-Haims described the
latest iteration of undergraduate
pre-major advising.
Students now have two advisors,
their regional Academic Director
and Pre-Maj or Advisor. The Acade
mic Director (AD) program was pi
loted in 2004 and instituted across
the board in 2008.

Lythcott-Haims cited that suc
cessful recruitment has resulted in
80 more volunteer pre-major advi
sors, bringing the total to 310, with
33 percent members of the Acade
mic Council, 26 percent academic or
teaching staff and 41 percent non
teaching staff or affiliates. Students
are expected to meet with their pre
major advisors once each quarter
until they declare a major.
Last year 100 percent of the class
of 2014 met with their advisors four
times, during orientation and each
quarter, according to Lythcott-
Haims, in accordance with a new
rule that placed an enrollment hold
until students had met with their ad
visors.
Lythcott-Haims also listed goals
for the future, such as creating more
AD positions, creating advising ob
jectives, bringing more faculty
members on board and increasing
student and advisor satisfaction.
She also asked the Senate, in partic
ular, for feedback from those who
used to serve as pre-major advisors
but no longer participate.
"The tools that I used disap
peared," said mechanical engineer
ing professor Chris Edwards, who
used to serve as a pre-major advisor.
Edwards referenced cuts in sopho
more peer mentors and faculty
lunches that helped facilitate the
advising process.
"We get that," Lythcott-Haims
said, referencing the need for some
form of peer advising. "We're going
to bring that back."
"I became quite cynical about
it," said linguistics professor Tom
Wasow, citing difficulties he experi
enced as a pre-major advisor in cre
ating a positive experiences for stu
dents who lacked interest. "I see
what you're doing as turning that
around. I'm almost ready to sign
up."

The Faculty Senate heard reports on
graduate education and undergraduate
advising Thursday, as well as some sur
prising news from University President
John Hennessy: "Given the difficulties
of setting up a campus in New York
City, we've decided to become a foot
ball powerhouse," Hennessy dead
panned.
Hennessy went on to praise the
football program and encouraged fac
ulty to attend Saturday's game against
Oregon, as well as the ESPN College
Game Day filming early Saturday
morning at the Oval.
Hennessy also discussed the recent
announcement of a $l5O million gift to
the Graduate School of Business
(GSB) from Robert "Bob" King '6O
and his wife, Dorothy "Dottie" King.
He also updated the Senate on the fu
ture of the Reserve Officers' Training
Corps (ROTC) at Stanford. Last
spring, the Senate voted to invite the re
turn of ROTC to Stanford.
Hennessy said that because of
"budgetary difficulties the Department
of Defense faces," the University "will
probably end up exploring alternative
opportunities." These may include al
ternative options for students who cur
rently commute, forming a consortium
with area schools and the United States
Naval Academy or asking the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Standards and
Policies (C-USP) to consider granting
some academic credit to students who
take ROTC courses off-campus.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
also updated the Senate, discussing the
formation of a search committee in
light of Persis Drell's resignation from
her post as director of SLAC National
Accelerator Laboratory, as well as the
University's current financial outlook.
"The financial situation of the Uni
versity right now is very good,"
Etchemendy said. He added that the
budgetary committee plans to be cau
tious, as "we have no idea what the fu
ture holds."
"We probably won't be doing cuts .
.. but we won't be spending a lot of
money either," Etchemendy added.
