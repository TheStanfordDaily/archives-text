shared equally."
The former U.N. Secretary General detailed
how global warming, population growth, rising
food prices and general political instability are the
major contributors to food insecurity worldwide.
Annan emphasized that climate change is not a
problem of the future, but one that must be dealt
with today. He linked recent examples of extreme
weather such as a heat wave in Russia and flooding
in Thailand to global warming.
"Rising temperatures and changing rainfall pat
terns are already affecting agricultural productivi
ty," Annan said. "Eighty percent of fertile farmland
in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to turn to 'dust
bowls' by the end of the century."
According to Annan, the world's growing popu

made an appeal to the Stanford community to help

International Studies (FSI), said they had been in
talks with Annan for nearly two years in order to
arrange the visit.
"You are well equipped to undertake research
which increases our knowledge," Annan told the
audience. "You also have the capacity to actively
engage to influence policy to find and implement
solutions to improve the lives of the most vulnera

Annan began his speech by noting that al
though the world has made considerable progress
in research and technology, these successes are
marred by what he called "shameful failures."
"That failure is that almost one in seven people
on our planet will go to bed without enough to eat,"
he said. "We live at a time of great contrast: new
technology and benefits of globalization have cre
