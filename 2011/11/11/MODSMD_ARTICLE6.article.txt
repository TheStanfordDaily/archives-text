ever before. However, this progress has not been
shared equally."
The former U.N. Secretary General detailed
how global warming, population growth, rising
food prices and general political instability are the
major contributors to food insecurity worldwide.
Annan emphasized that climate change is not a
problem of the future, but one that must be dealt
with today. He linked recent examples of extreme
weather such as a heat wave in Russia and flooding
in Thailand to global warming.
"Rising temperatures and changing rainfall pat
terns are already affecting agricultural productivi
ty," Annan said. "Eighty percent of fertile farmland
in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to turn to 'dust
bowls' by the end of the century."
According to Annan, the world's growing popu
lation is another major factor that will affect food
security. While the world's ability to grow food is
declining, the number of mouths to feed is rapidly
increasing.
Experts predict that by the year 2050, the
world's food demand will grow by 70 percent.
Annan said that while estimates from two years
ago estimated that the world's population would

Former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
made an appeal to the Stanford community to help
solve issues of food security when he spoke to an
audience of more than 1,400 students in Memorial
Auditorium on Thursday afternoon.
The event co-sponsors, Stanford in Govern
ment (SIG) and the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies (FSI), said they had been in
talks with Annan for nearly two years in order to
arrange the visit.
"You are well equipped to undertake research
which increases our knowledge," Annan told the
audience. "You also have the capacity to actively
engage to influence policy to find and implement
solutions to improve the lives of the most vulnera
ble people on the planet."
Annan began his speech by noting that al
though the world has made considerable progress
in research and technology, these successes are
marred by what he called "shameful failures."
"That failure is that almost one in seven people
on our planet will go to bed without enough to eat,"
he said. "We live at a time of great contrast: new
technology and benefits of globalization have cre
ated greater opportunity and more prosperity than

level off around 9 billion, more re
cent studies point to 10 billion as
the "leveling-off point."
Rising food prices will also con
tribute to global food insecurity, ac
cording to Annan.
"By the year 2050, food prices
will increase by 50 percent," he said.
According to Annan, some con
tributing causes of food insecurity
are the result of economic factors in
Western countries, such as specula
tion in agricultural commodities
and cultivation of crops for cattle
feed and bio-fuel, rather than for
human consumption.
Annan remarked on a quote
from a personal conversation with
Fidel Castro.
"If we give the food to the cars,
what will the people eat?" Annan
said the Cuban leader once asked
him.
Annan described how high de
mand for crops such as coffee and
cocoa often causes farmers in
Africa to grow these crops instead
of dietary staples, such as cassava or
sorghum.
"Africa has become a continent
that grows what we do not eat and
imports what we need," Annan
said.
The situation, however, is not
without hope. Annan cited several
examples of innovative programs
that are being developed to help
African farmers.
In order for these programs to

be successful, Annan said he be
lieves that they must learn from the
positive and negative lessons of re
gions that have previously tried to
conquer food insecurity, such as
Asia. Annan said these new solu
tions must also be "climate-smart."
"Most importantly," Annan said,
"[these solutions] must draw from
knowledge of local communities so
they can be put into practice by
small-holder farmers."
Annan appealed to Stanford
students specifically to help in the
fight against food insecurity. He
said that the new Center for Food
Security and the Environment
(FSE) is an example of the kind of
forward thinking that can make
contributions to end hunger.
"My young friends, don't sit on
the sidelines, contribute your cu
riosity, your energy and your un
bounded enthusiasm to end global
food insecurity," Annan said.
James Honsa 'l4, a member of
SIG, said he thought Annan's
speech was "sensational," and that
the speech showed him "the huge
disconnect between the money al
lotted to food aid and the benefits
that could come from that and the
money we choose to spend on na
tional security."
In addition to speaking to Stan
ford students in Memorial Audito
rium on Thursday, Annan will be
speaking this weekend at the
launch of the new, full-fledged re
search Center for Food Security
and the Environment (FSE) under
the FSI.
