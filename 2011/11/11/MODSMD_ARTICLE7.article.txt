## Group helps form haven for homeless Night Outreach joins PA for women's shelter 
### JOSH HOYT STAFF WRITER 
Night Outreach, a Stanford stu
dent group dedicated to serving and
establishing a relationship with the
local homeless community, has part
nered with Inn Vision, the largest
provider of housing in Santa Clara
County, in an effort to establish an
area, women-only shelter.
Night Outreach said it hopes to
raise $20,000 to help fund the joint
venture. The shelter is scheduled to
open on Jan. 15,2012.
This project marks a significant
addition to Night Outreach's cur
rent activity, which includes a week
ly 'night walk' into downtown Palo
Alto. Students distribute sandwich
es and basic necessities on the walks,
which are intended to promote dia
logue between students and the
homeless and at-risk population.
"The night walks shaped our mis
sion," said Ricardo Pinho, a gradu
ate student Night Outreach member
who coordinates the night walks.
"Even now with higher-flying, more
ambitious projects, the night walks
keep us grounded and in-touch."
The student group's project part
ner, Inn Vision, is the operator of the
only emergency shelter in Palo Alto,
Hotel de Zink, which currently pro
vides 15 beds for the homeless. The
new women's shelter would double
that capacity, adding 15 additional
beds.
"This will be a women-only shel
ter, and it will be based off Inn Vi
sion's existing infrastructure," said
Night Outreach co-president Marie
Baylon 'l2. "Sometimes there are
more than 150 unhoused people on
[lnnVision's] waiting list. There is a
huge demand for shelter."
Hotel de Zink does not have a
permanent structure, and neither
will the women's shelter. Instead,
the shelter will be hosted by church
es in the area and will change loca
tions once per month. Continuing
current policy, guests will be allowed
to stay for no longer than three con
secutive months.
Night Outreach is planning the
women's shelter as a three-month
trial.
"We will be having a pilot pro
gram from Jan. 15 to April 15 at
three different churches," Pinho
said. "One is in downtown Palo Alto,
and one is in Menlo Park."
