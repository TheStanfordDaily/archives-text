## Intl. CS research team cracks audio CAPTCHA Stanford helps uncover flaw in online security 
### ROBERTO VARGAS 
Researchers in the Stanford
Computer Science Department,
working in tandem with re
searchers from Tulane University
and the French National Institute
for Research in Computer Science
and Control (INRIA), created a
program called "deCAPTCHA"
that is capable of passing an audio
Completely Automated Public
Turing Test to tell Computers and
Humans Apart (CAPTCHA).
Everyday Internet users know
CAPTCHA tests as the distorted
characters they must interpret for
access to certain online content.
The team presented the multi
year project to design the program
last May at the Institute for Elec
tronics and Electrical Engineers
(lEEE) symposium on security
and privacy in Oakland, Calif.
CATPCHAs were created in re
sponse to spammers and hackers
creating multiple accounts to take
advantage of a system. For exam
ple, a person could use a program
that created hundreds of accounts
to simulate popularity of online
content on sites such as You Tube,
Digg and Reddit. CAPTCHAs are
intended to provide a guarantee
that each account is made by a per

son, not a computer program.
Standard CAPTCHAs are
widespread and most often take
the form of characters that have
been distorted and masked with
crossing lines. The audio
CAPTCHA is an alternate option
to the visual CAPTCHA for the vi
sually impaired, combining spoken
letters and numbers with back
ground noise to confuse any auto
mated attempt to decode it.
Computer science professor
John Mitchell and post-doctoral
student Elie Bursztein led a team
from the Stanford Security Lab, as
well as from other universities, in
creating the program dubbed "de-
CAPTCHA," which focuses on de
crypting the audio-based
CAPTCHA.
DeCAPTCHA uses several ma
chine-learning algorithms to create
a "smart" program that learns from
the examples that it is given. First,
deCAPTCHA is fed the raw vowel
and number sounds that it is sup
posed to be listening for. It then lis
tens for these sound patterns in the
audio clips it is given by separating
the desired sound signals from the
rest of the audio pattern.
DeCAPTCHA has the poten
tial to be used maliciously, but re
searchers hope that presenting the
program to security development
teams before making the informa
tion public will limit damage.
