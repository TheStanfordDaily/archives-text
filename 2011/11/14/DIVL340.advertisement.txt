Seeing into the Life of Things
For decades, scientific researchers have used Stanford's Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve as
a living laboratory, a window opening onto complex natural and ecological systems. Artists,
too, often concentrate on particular places like Jasper Ridge, and—through
their own imaginative way of looking— see "into the life of things," and
represent what they find in new and unexpected ways.
This program brings together three extraordinarily accomplished
and imaginative artists who will reflect on how Jasper Ridge,
and places like it, act as a kind of "global backyard" for
entrance into a larger living world. The event will be hosted
by Philippe Cohen, Administrative Director of Jasper Ridge
with Ann Carlson, Jasper Ridge's inaugural visiting
artist, who will be the evenings moderator.
