## EDITORIAL Time for ASSU Exec to reconnect with students 
### 
Fpr all that Michael Cruz's ASSU
Executive team aimed to ac
complish this year, it has fallen
short on at least one expressed goal:
"connecting better with students."
Compared to the standard set by last
year's executive team,ledby President
Angelina Cardona, it is hard to see
how this year's team is "connecting
better." Cardona's team sent out
emails detailing what the ASSU was
doing and how regular students could
get involved. In other emails, Cardona
solicited student support for projects
ranging from a sustainable living
dorm to sexual violence reform. Her
executive team sponsored a "student
input forum" on Judicial Affairs and
an ROTC town hall. And Cardona
wrote opinion pieces for The Stanford
Daily on various campus issues; these
op-eds frequently referred to the no
tion of one "Stanford community,"
which was a consistent emphasis of
her executive team.

In comparison, President Cruz's
email updates have been less detailed,
and the calls for student feedback in
these emails have been less visible.
Furthermore, whereas Cardona invit
ed students to attend undergraduate
student senate meetings in her emails,
there has been no such invitation
from the current Executive team. Al
though ASSU Vice-President Stew
art Macgregor-Dennis has written
one opinion piece for The Daily dur
ing his term so far, it seems to have
largely been intended to be self-pro
motional. Cruz has not published any
pieces. And despite being used exten
sively by Cardona last year, the ASSU
Exec Twitter account has only been
updated once since Aug. 9.
Furthermore,many students have
expressed frustration with a platform
that seemed to emphasize quantity of
initiatives over the feasibility and
value of such endeavors. With so
many ideas for student government,
it was difficult to comprehend the Ex
ecutive team's priorities apart from
technology and entrepreneurship.

Much like their extensive platform,
Cruz and Macgregor-Dennis were
criticized over the increasing size of
their cabinet. Time spent creating
new divisions and hiring cabinet
members necessarily detracted from
time that could have been spent di
rectly advocating for students.
Whether these myriad complaints
were warranted or not, one thing be
came increasingly clear; at some
point, the Executive team lost touch
with much of the student body.
Although severing its ties with
E2.o,its entrepreneurship wing, was a
step in the right direction for the Ex
ecutive team, more needs to be done
to regain a connection with students.
To be fair, it is only halfway through
the Cruz/Macgregor-Dennis term.
However, a trend is developing
wherein the student body is becom
ing less and less connected with its
government. Cardona set a high stan
dard last year in terms of fostering
student involvement, especially in
sponsoring discussions on various
campus issues. We wonder if the E2.0
ordeal could have been prevented in
the first place with, say, a town hall or
online Q&A on the subject.
However, besides town halls,
there are many feasible actions this
year's Executive team can pursue to
better connect with the student body.
In its update emails, the Executive
team can be more detailed and more
clearly emphasize ways for students
to get involved. It can send out sur
veys to solicit input on its projects. In
future opinion pieces, it can write
about issues pertaining to the Stan
ford community. Although half of
their term has already passed, Cruz
and Macgregor-Dennis still have
time to make this year's ASSU Exec
utive Team memorable. A necessary
component of that, however, is de
veloping a true connection with stu
dents. Cruz/Macgregor-Dennis em
phasized that goal in their platform
when campaigning, and it is now
time for them to realize it in action.
