# FRESHMAN '15
## Some things are tough to B-lieve 
### Bianca Chavez 
Stanford students don't agree
on many things. With such a di
verse student body, it's no sur
prise that the campus rarely reaches
a general consensus on any issue
whether the topic of debate is the
Occupy movement, the return of
ROTC or the quality of dining hall
food. We just love to argue.
There are only three things we
can agree on: 1) Cal sucks, 2) Ore
gon may have beaten us at football,
but we totally beat them at life
(How many Oregon students go on
to become Internet billionaires,
Olympic athletes, Supreme Court
justices and leaders of countries?)
and 3) IHUM sucks, too.
Why do students hate IHUM so
much? It's not a particularly rigor
ous class like, say, CSIO6A. (I could
n't even get through the syllabus for
that course without saying, "Huh?")
It's not an overly time-consuming
class besides two short-ish pa
pers and weekly readings, there re
ally isn't any outside work. Sure,
some of the material covered may
be drier than the Sahara Desert, but
I'm willing to bet there are plenty of
other courses that focus on even
less interesting topics.
So why, then, is IHUM the most
loathed class on campus? Because
students here hate to fail. And by
fail, I mean get B's.
"Just wait 'til you freshmen get
your first papers back," one of my
upperclassman friends told me two
weeks ago. "It's gonna be like a slap
in the face." And he was right. Plen
ty of my friends were visibly upset
when our papers were returned last
week. One of my friends moped

around for the rest of the day look
ing like someone had kicked his
puppy. Another girl walked out of
lecture looking like she was about
to burst into tears.

But here's the crazy part: it's not
like these kids had flunked the as
signment. They like most other
kids in IHUM had gotten B's. As
in, a√üove average. As in, a still fairly
decent grade. And they were acting
like Thanksgiving break had been
cancelled.

To be honest, I really didn't un
derstand why they were so dis
traught. I mean, getting a B on the
first major assignment of your col
lege career isn't so abysmal es
pecially when your school is one of
the most prestigious and rigorous
institutions in the world. Then I re
alized that many of my classmates
had never gotten a B before.

As new students at Stanford, we
are all accustomed to succeeding at
school. We're used to getting A's.
We're used to being The Best at
whatever we do, whether it be aca
demics, athletics or art.
One of the hardest parts of fresh
man year has been accepting that we
can't all be The Best anymore.
Whether you're a dancer, chess play
er or a math prodigy, there is proba
bly still a person on this campus who
could beat you at your own game.
I remember realizing this during
Opening Convocation, when the
speaker (some distinguished mem
ber of the University wearing a
funny-looking hat) told a class of
1,700 high school valedictorians
that we would not all be graduating
from Stanford with honors. Hell,

850 of us would be graduating in the
bottom half of the class. That's a
hard pill to swallow, particularly
after 18 years of getting gold stars
on all your spelling tests and 2400s
on the SAT.

paper or any other aspect of
