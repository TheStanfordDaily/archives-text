## On playing Taboo 
### Miles Unterreiner 
One of my all-time favorite
board games is Hasbro's
wildly popular Taboo. You
may be familiar with it and its
tremendously annoying purple
buzzer, which the opposing team
gets to gleefully press every time
you utter one of the five forbidden
words printed on each of the game's
many cards. The object of the game:
get your teammates to guess the
item on your card without using the
five "Taboo" words (which Hasbro
knows people are most likely to use
when describing said item). Use
"green" when describing "grass,"
for instance, and you immediately
get drowned out by the purple
buzzer and docked a point or two, to
the disappointment of your team
mates and the laughter of your op
ponents. It's a lot of fun, really.
Things get a little tougher,
though, when we apply the same
strategy to our real-life Taboos:
things that are difficult to talk about
because society deems them unset
tling, controversial or potentially di
visive. We have a lot of these at
Stanford: race and affirmative ac
tion, multiculturalism, religious
faith, political beliefs and sexual ori
entation prominent among them.
And just like in the board game,
there are a lot of words and con
cepts we can't use, for various rea
sons, when talking about them.
A lot of the time, I think that's a
great thing. No one wants the N
word casually tossed about in a dis
cussion about race, for example, or
the loudest and most obnoxious
voice to win in a discussion about
politics.
But not infrequently, I think that
like the tabooed items in the board
game, tough discussions would be a
lot easier to have if we let ourselves
use our full vocabulary while having

them.
We don't generally do this,
though, and for good reason: some
one always gets really angry. As a
columnist and writer, I get (and see
other writers getting) the rhetorical
equivalent of the purple-buzzer
treatment all the time. It's not an en
joyable experience. If you've ever
written or spoken on a taboo sub
ject (this one's for you, Flipside
staff), you'll know what I'm talking
about here: bitter ad hominem at
tacks against your personal charac
ter or writing style: overheated as
sertions that assail, rather than re
spectfully disagree with, your point;
outraged rebuttals that, in true
straw-man fashion, read far more
into your original argument than
you ever intended to put there.
In short, writers who tread on
tabooed ground, at Stanford and
elsewhere, tend to get hit with full
fledged barrages of the purple
buzzer treatment, drowning out po
tentially productive conversation
with loud but unproductive noise.
The Ã¼biquity of such animus, how
ever, belies its danger.

What is a writer to do when
faced with the possibility of such an
imosity? We have several options,
none of them good. We can delicate
ly avoid writing about anything con
troversial, which has the upside of
upsetting no one but the downside
of resulting in blandly vapid
columns about the oatmeal we ate
for breakfast or the fun party we
went to last night. We can write
about controversial topics but do
our best to agree with everyone,
which also upsets nobody but tends
to result in either meaningless self
contradiction or, if everyone really
does agree, glorious and inspira
tional but ultimately forgettable
preaching to a happily homoge-

neous choir. Either one dumbs
down our discourse and has a chill
ing effect on the quality of intellec
tual life, itself predicated on a free
and vibrant exchange of some
times-conflicting ideas.
Or and this is unquestionably
the best option of a bad lot we
can say what we like without worry
ing unduly about the fury of the
purple buzzer. Such writing, if artic
ulated respectfully, can cause peo
ple to think critically rather than to
passively accept the prevailing or
thodoxy; to reexamine their own
deeply held beliefs against the light
of a real challenge; to contemplate
the possibility that they may be
wrong on a sensitive and important
issue; or to reaffirm with conviction
that they are in fact right. (Thanks
for that one, Mill.)
So if I happen to get angry mes
sages in my inbox strongly disagree
ing with me, or nasty comments on
the Daily website, I tend to think I'm
doing at least one thing right: I've
made people think hard about some
thing important. (It can also just
mean I've written a really awful arti
cle, though, so negative responses are
a necessary, but not sufficient, condi
tion for proving intellectual quality.)
If we're not careful, though,
breaking the taboo can instead
spark uproar, mutual bitterness and
the ritual dance of self-flagellating
apologies on the part of all in
volved, concluding in an unproduc
tive retreat to the same ideological
corners in which we began.
And so we remain stuck in a
game we can't get out of.

Miles loves Taboo, in small doses.
