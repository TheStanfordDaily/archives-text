## Title dreams destroyed as Ducks roll 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat or the Back 
With all the pressure,
hype and media at
tention focused on
the Farm for the first
time this season,
only one team stepped up. And for the
first time this season, it wasn't Stanford.
Here's Stat on the Back's take on the
Cardinal's first loss of the season, a 53-
30 thrashing by Oregon.
Number of the game: 2
What it means: 10/2/2010 and
11/12/2011 had a whole lot more in
common than just the zeros, ones and
twos. These two days are the only two
times in the past two years when An
drew Luck threw at least 14 incomple
tions. They're the only two times Stan
ford faced a team ranked higher than
No. 15. They're the only two times the
Stanford defense gave up over 50
points. And they're the only two times
Stanford has had to play Oregon.
Most significantly, of course, they're
the only two times in the past two sea
sons Stanford has lost. And that is no
coincidence.
Why it matters: The Cardinal is one
of the best football teams in the nation.
There is no doubt about that. Stanford
has gone 21-2 since the start of the 2010
season, which is tied for the most wins
by any FBS team in that span.
Of course, it's those two losses that
really stand out. In the past two sea
sons, the Cardinal has had two shots to
knock off a top-10 team. Once it was as
a road underdog, once it was as a home
favorite and both times it was against
the Ducks. Stanford whiffed both

times, and this inability to win big
games is what separates the Cardinal
from the truly elite teams.
Other notable numbers:
1: Saturday was the first time in a
long time that Stanford was thorough
ly outplayed from start to finish. In fact,
it was the first time in the Andrew Luck
Era (2009-11) that Stanford was
outscored in both halves of a game.
You have to give credit where credit is
due, and Oregon was far superior to
the Cardinal in every aspect of the
game. The Ducks deserved to win, and
they left no doubt.
3: It's unfair to point to one player in
a game like this, and the loss should be
spread around to the whole team.
However, Luck is seen as the best play
er in the country and possibly one of
the best ever, but he did not look re
motely deserving of the Heisman on
Saturday.
For just the third time in his career,
Luck threw multiple interceptions in a
game. One of them was completely
Luck's fault and set up the Ducks' first
score of the game. The other was not
his fault at all but was returned for a
touchdown. Three is also the number
of turnovers Luck had, as he also fum
bled for the first time this season, one of
three fumbles by Stanford.
Three was not a kind number for
the team, as the offensive line allowed
Luck to be sacked three times by Ore
gon. Luck had been sacked just four
times total in the first nine games. The
sacks on Saturday caused Luck to be
held to -13 rushing yards, just the sec
ond time in his career he has had nega
tive yards on the ground.
Stanford fumbled three times after
fumbling just twice in the first nine
games. The Cardinal seemed to give up
at the end of the game, as three of Stan
ford's season-high five turnovers came
in the final five minutes.

5-for-14: Stanford converted just
five of its 14 third downs, and two of
those conversions came in the fourth
quarter when the game was out of
hand. For a Cardinal team that relies
on long, punishing drives and came in
ranked fourth in the nation in convert
ing third downs, starting 3-for-10 isn't
going to cut it.
13: It seems unthinkable, but Stan
ford actually outgained Oregon by 13
yards. I'm not kidding look it up. If
you only saw that the Cardinal forced
two turnovers, held the Ducks to 387
total yards and forced Oregon to go 1-
for-9 on third downs, you would proba
bly expect Stanford to come away with
the win.

However, if you were watching the
game, you know that Oregon was
much more dominant than any of
these statistics show. The Ducks made
big plays four of their seven touch
downs came from at least 40 yards out.
They forced five Stanford turnovers,
kept pressure on Luck in away that no
other team could and they dominated
special teams.
17,11: The loss marks the end of
Stanford's 17-game winning streak and
11-game home winning streak. The
Cardinal almost certainly cannot win

the Pac-12 North and will not play in the
national title game. All hope is lost.
Yet, contrary to popular belief; the
season is not over. There's this little
thing called Big Game this week, and
rumor has it that Stanford and Cal
don't like each other. After that is
Notre Dame to close out the regular
season. Neither team will be a
pushover, and the Cardinal had better
regroup fast in order to beat those two
teams.

And although a national title really
is out of the picture (don't bother find
ing a scenario I've heard it, and it's
not happening), Stanford still has a
good chance at playing in a BCS bowl.
But before we go into scenarios, let's
wait and see how the Cardinal does in its
final two games. After all, as Saturday
showed, wins can never be assumed.

tasy football weeks of his life and still

the only two times in the past two sea
sons Stanford has lost. And that is no
coincidence.
Why it matters: The Cardinal is one
of the best football teams in the nation.
There is no doubt about that. Stanford
has gone 21-2 since the start of the 2010
season, which is tied for the most wins
by any FBS team in that span.
Of course, it's those two losses that
really stand out. In the past two sea
sons, the Cardinal has had two shots to
knock off a top-10 team. Once it was as
a road underdog, once it was as a home
favorite and both times it was against
the Ducks. Stanford whiffed both

times, and this inability to win big
games is what separates the Cardinal
from the truly elite teams.
Other notable numbers:
1: Saturday was the first time in a
long time that Stanford was thorough
ly outplayed from start to finish. In fact,
it was the first time in the Andrew Luck
Era (2009-11) that Stanford was
outscored in both halves of a game.
You have to give credit where credit is
due, and Oregon was far superior to
the Cardinal in every aspect of the
game. The Ducks deserved to win, and
they left no doubt.
3: It's unfair to point to one player in
a game like this, and the loss should be
spread around to the whole team.
However, Luck is seen as the best play
er in the country and possibly one of
the best ever, but he did not look re
motely deserving of the Heisman on
Saturday.
For just the third time in his career,
Luck threw multiple interceptions in a
game. One of them was completely
Luck's fault and set up the Ducks' first
score of the game. The other was not
his fault at all but was returned for a
touchdown. Three is also the number
of turnovers Luck had, as he also fum
bled for the first time this season, one of
three fumbles by Stanford.
Three was not a kind number for
the team, as the offensive line allowed
Luck to be sacked three times by Ore
gon. Luck had been sacked just four
times total in the first nine games. The
sacks on Saturday caused Luck to be
held to -13 rushing yards, just the sec
ond time in his career he has had nega
tive yards on the ground.
Stanford fumbled three times after
fumbling just twice in the first nine
games. The Cardinal seemed to give up
at the end of the game, as three of Stan
ford's season-high five turnovers came
in the final five minutes.

5-for-14: Stanford converted just
five of its 14 third downs, and two of
those conversions came in the fourth
quarter when the game was out of
hand. For a Cardinal team that relies
on long, punishing drives and came in
ranked fourth in the nation in convert
ing third downs, starting 3-for-10 isn't
going to cut it.
13: It seems unthinkable, but Stan
ford actually outgained Oregon by 13
yards. I'm not kidding look it up. If
you only saw that the Cardinal forced
two turnovers, held the Ducks to 387
total yards and forced Oregon to go 1-
for-9 on third downs, you would proba
bly expect Stanford to come away with
the win.

However, if you were watching the
game, you know that Oregon was
much more dominant than any of
these statistics show. The Ducks made
big plays four of their seven touch
downs came from at least 40 yards out.
They forced five Stanford turnovers,
kept pressure on Luck in away that no
other team could and they dominated
special teams.
17,11: The loss marks the end of
Stanford's 17-game winning streak and
11-game home winning streak. The
Cardinal almost certainly cannot win

the Pac-12 North and will not play in the
national title game. All hope is lost.
Yet, contrary to popular belief; the
season is not over. There's this little
thing called Big Game this week, and
rumor has it that Stanford and Cal
don't like each other. After that is
Notre Dame to close out the regular
season. Neither team will be a
pushover, and the Cardinal had better
regroup fast in order to beat those two
teams.

And although a national title really
is out of the picture (don't bother find
ing a scenario I've heard it, and it's
not happening), Stanford still has a
good chance at playing in a BCS bowl.
But before we go into scenarios, let's
wait and see how the Cardinal does in its
final two games. After all, as Saturday
showed, wins can never be assumed.

With all the pressure,
hype and media at
tention focused on
the Farm for the first
time this season,
only one team stepped up. And for the
first time this season, it wasn't Stanford.
Here's Stat on the Back's take on the
Cardinal's first loss of the season, a 53-
30 thrashing by Oregon.
Number of the game: 2
What it means: 10/2/2010 and
11/12/2011 had a whole lot more in
common than just the zeros, ones and
twos. These two days are the only two
times in the past two years when An
drew Luck threw at least 14 incomple
tions. They're the only two times Stan
ford faced a team ranked higher than
No. 15. They're the only two times the
Stanford defense gave up over 50
points. And they're the only two times
Stanford has had to play Oregon.
Most significantly, of course, they're
the only two times in the past two sea
sons Stanford has lost. And that is no
coincidence.
