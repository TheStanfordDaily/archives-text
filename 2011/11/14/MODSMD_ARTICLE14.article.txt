# SHUTOUT ENDS YEAR
## 
### SARAH MAISEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was a tale of two halves in
Norfolk, Va., where after holding
No. 6 Duke to just one goal in the
first period, the No. 10 Stanford
field hockey team fell 5-0 and swift
ly exited the NCAA Tournament.
The blowout ended a season that
saw the team tie the school record
of 17 wins and climb to a school
record of No. 6 in the national rank
ings.

The lopsided score after a sea
son of offensive domination may
leave many scratching their heads.
It was only the second shutout of
the season against Stanford, with
the first coming in the 1-0 loss to
California in the NorPac Champi
onship. After routinely blowing out
opponents, often by five or more
goals, the Cardinal failed to score in
its last two games.
Duke scored off its first shot,
when midfielder Devon Gagliardi
found the back of the net a little over
two minutes into the game. But de
spite being outshot 7-3, Stanford did
not give up. Redshirt senior goal
keeper Ale Moss's four saves fin
ished the period with the team still
very much in the hunt for its first
ever NCAA Tournament win.

But things would not fall the
Cardinal's way in the second peri
od. Duke came out strong once
again, this time scoring within the
first minute. Assisted by Gagliar
di, forward Emmie Le Marchand
snuck the ball into the net for her
17th goal of the season. Marchand
scored again just before the 53rd
minute to put Duke up 3-0. The
last two goals came less than a
minute apart in the final five min
utes of the game. Forward McKay
Ross blasted an open shot behind

Moss, and Marchand completed
her second hat trick of the season
on a deflection.

"lt was an evenly matched
game, but we lacked the confidence
and experience to move forward in
the postseason play," said head
coach Tara Danielson. "At end of
the day, we just didn't have the ex
perience. It was an evenly matched
game up until the middle of the sec
ond period."
Stanford's offense never ignited.
It managed just three shots in the
first period and seven in the second,
but four of those came after Duke's
fifth goal. While it held the edge in
penalty corners 6-2. the team simply
could not execute to find the net.
"At the next level, if we want to

be a champion and a title holder, we
have to work on having the experi
ence under our belt, put the ball in
the net and keep the ball out of the
net. Overall, we're really proud of
this team, and they worked very
hard," Danielson said. Stan
ford can pride itself on a stellar sea
son that brought recognition to the
talents of the program. Junior de
fender Becky Dru earned the honors
of West Division Defensive Player of
the Year and West Division Co-Play
er of the Year and was named to the
West Division All-Conference
Team. Moss, senior attacker
Stephanie Byrne and freshman at
tacker Alex McCawley also earned
All-Conference honors.
"There are so many positive at

tacking structures to build on for the
spring and next season," Danielson
said. "The team shows good signs of
discipline and understanding of the
game at the next level. This year was
a real breakthrough year for a young
team to perform and execute. [On
Saturday,] we were missing the abil
ity to capture that moment and cap
italize on opportunity to get to that
next level."

This was a season of personal
bests for many Cardinal players.
Dru's career-high 16 goals were
enough to make the star defender
the leader in goals scored in back
to-back seasons. Byrne's 16 assists
led the team and were the most of

"There are a lot of positive

"The outlook is that we're excited,
we're young, the moment for the
program is there and the girls are
hungry."
The Cardinal will see many key
players return next fall. Six under

many others produced off the
bench as reserves. The talents of

these players, as well as all those
returning, will undoubtedly make

game, but we lacked the confidence
and experience to move forward in
the postseason play," said head
coach Tara Danielson. "At end of
the day, we just didn't have the ex
perience. It was an evenly matched
game up until the middle of the sec
ond period."
Stanford's offense never ignited.
It managed just three shots in the
first period and seven in the second,
but four of those came after Duke's
fifth goal. While it held the edge in
penalty corners 6-2. the team simply
could not execute to find the net.
"At the next level, if we want to

be a champion and a title holder, we
have to work on having the experi
ence under our belt, put the ball in
the net and keep the ball out of the
net. Overall, we're really proud of
this team, and they worked very
hard," Danielson said. Stan
ford can pride itself on a stellar sea
son that brought recognition to the
talents of the program. Junior de
fender Becky Dru earned the honors
of West Division Defensive Player of
the Year and West Division Co-Play
er of the Year and was named to the
West Division All-Conference
Team. Moss, senior attacker
Stephanie Byrne and freshman at
tacker Alex McCawley also earned
All-Conference honors.
"There are so many positive at

tacking structures to build on for the
spring and next season," Danielson
said. "The team shows good signs of
discipline and understanding of the
game at the next level. This year was
a real breakthrough year for a young
team to perform and execute. [On
Saturday,] we were missing the abil
ity to capture that moment and cap
italize on opportunity to get to that
next level."

This was a season of personal
bests for many Cardinal players.
Dru's career-high 16 goals were
enough to make the star defender
the leader in goals scored in back
to-back seasons. Byrne's 16 assists
led the team and were the most of

seven shutouts, the most of her ca

"There are a lot of positive

things to build on," Danielson said.
"The outlook is that we're excited,
we're young, the moment for the
program is there and the girls are
hungry."
The Cardinal will see many key
players return next fall. Six under
classmen made starts this year, and
many others produced off the
bench as reserves. The talents of

these players, as well as all those

for a strong team next season,
