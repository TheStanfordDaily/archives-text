# BLOWOUT IN OPENER
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
While the football team drew
the hype and the crowds over
the weekend, the Stanford men's
basketball team tipped off its sea
son in style with a 91-52 blowout
victory over Central Arkansas on
Friday night in Maples Pavilion.

Sophomore point guard Aaron
Bright had a game-high 16 points,
making him one of five Cardinal
players in double figures as Stan
ford (1-0) looked solid on both
sides of the floor after some initial
shakiness on the offensive end
early on. Central Arkansas (0-1)
had a very tough season a year ago
finishing 5-24 overall and win
ning one league game in the South
land Conference and it was a lit
tle tough to gauge how well Stan
ford will match up against some of
the better competition it will see
this year.

But the Cardinal certainly had
stretches on offense that showed
signs of real promise for the year.
As hard as it was for the Bears to
find their shooting touch all night
long, it was three times harder for
the Cardinal to miss, at least by the
end of the half. While Stanford
came out looking a bit nervous and
firing up numerous bricks, the team
found its groove six or seven min
utes after the opening tip.
And thanks to that torrid stretch
to close out the final 12 minutes of
the period the only missed shots
came on a last-second three-point
shot by freshman guard Chasson
Randle, a botched layup by Bright
and a long jump shot from junior
guard Gabe Harris Stanford fin
ished the first half shooting a robust
17-for-30 from the field.
Many of those points came on
easy layups, and it looked like head
coach Johnny Dawkins had his
players much more active in the
lane compared to last year, when
stationary one-on-one isolations
were very common.
It definitely helped that Stan
ford's shooters were making jump
shots to stretch the defense

sophomore forward Anthony
Brown went 6-for-ll from the field,
and Bright hit five of his eight
three-point attempts.
The highly touted Randle per
formed well in his collegiate debut
the 2010 Illinois Gatorade Bas
ketball Player of the Year scored 15
points on 4-for-9 shooting, pulled
down six rebounds and dished out
four assists while playing a game
high 28 minutes.
There were, however, also some
glaring holes in the Cardinal's all
around game. Without Bright, the
rest of the team went just l-for-9
from behind the arc, and the team's
free-throw shooting was, on the
whole, abysmal. Stanford needed a
second-half surge to push its free
throw percentage barely past its
field-goal percentage 57.9 per
cent from the stripe and 54.2 per
cent on field goals.
But even without sophomore
forward Dwight Powell, who
sprained his ankle in practice on
Wednesday, the interior defense
was an improvement over last sea
son. The Cardinal also owned the
