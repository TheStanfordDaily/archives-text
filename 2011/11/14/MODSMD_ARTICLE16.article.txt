# OGWUMIKES START STRONG
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Seven months after falling short
in the Final Four for a fourth con
secutive season, the Stanford
women's basketball team was at it
again this weekend, kicking off the
season against a pair of tough foes
in No. 24 Texas and Gonzaga.
While the absence of star senior
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike for
the Texas trip may have slowed the
squad down, the No. 5 Cardinal (2-
0) was able to pull out two tough
victories to start the season on a
strong note.

As expected for the coming sea
son, the Ogwumike sisters led Stan
ford in scoring in both games, with
Nnemkadi putting together a flashy
33-point, 18-rebound performance
against Gonzaga (1-1) to cap off the
weekend.

"When you're playing a really
good team like this, you can't afford
to put three players on somebody,"
said Gonzaga head coach Kelly
Graves, referring to Nnemkadi Og
wumike's performance. "And on
some of those shots tonight, it
wouldn't have mattered if we had
five people, one on top of the other.
She would've made those shots. It's
just the combination of strength,
quickness and tenacity, and it's just
incredible how she can play. And it's
fun to watch."
Stanford had to do without the
preseason All-American's services
on Friday, however, due to an undis
closed upper-body injury. The Car
dinal started slowly against the
Longhorns, failing to pull away in
the first half while shooting just 12-
for-32 from the floor and l-for-7
from behind the arc. With sopho
more guard Chiney Ogwumike on
the bench after two first-half fouls,
Flouston-native freshman guard
Amber Orrange stepped into the
spotlight in her first college game
and kept Stanford running with 12
points before the break.
But Chiney Ogwumike would
have the chance to make up for her
sister's absence in the second half,
leading Stanford with 16 points and
14 rebounds for the 11th double
double of her young career. Junior
forward Joslyn Tinkle and sopho
more guard Toni Kokenis would
also finish in double figures to finish
off a 72-59 win.
Unfortunately, scheduling was
not kind to the Cardinal, which had
little time for rest between its Fri
day night game at Texas, the flight
back to the Bay Area and a 2 p.m.
start on Sunday against the Bull
dogs.
"We were tired, and they're an
excellent team," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "They
shoot the ball really well, they're in
great shape and they're physical,
but they just didn't have an answer
for Nnemkadi and Chiney inside. I
think the turnaround did probably
affect us a little bit, but that's just
college basketball. You're going to
travel, and you're going to have that
kind of stuff to deal with."

Stanford had some trouble deal
ing with the turnaround at first, and

a slow start left the Cardinal trailing
at halftime 32-31 thanks to a 10-3
turnover deficit. It was the first reg
ular-season game that the Cardinal
had trailed at the break since a Dec.
19, 2010 loss to Tennessee nearly a
year ago.
The lone bright spot in the open
ing frame against Gonzaga was
Nnemkadi Ogwumike, who led all
scorers with 16 points going into the
second half. But her teammates ral
lied behind her to close out the win,
which was highlighted by a one
handed, underhand basket and
one â€”by the senior as she was
fouled to the floor.
"When I go out there, the only
thing I think about is my team and
what we need to do, so I go out there
as hard as I can," Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike said. "We talked about it be
fore we went out there, that we
never lose at Maples. We defend this
place like no other, and I think my
team did a really good job of com
ing back. The first half was not how
we wanted it to be; we were missing
a lot of shots, we weren't necessari
ly getting the rebounds for those
missed shots and we weren't getting
back on defense. I think we did a re
ally good job of adjusting."
Thanks to improved ball-han
dling and a stingy defensive effort,
the Cardinal pulled away late to win
76-61.
Stanford will have to perfect its
play even further with yet another
busy week ahead. After hosting Old
Dominion at 7 p.m. on Thursday, the
Cardinal flies out to face No. 4 Con
necticut a week from today in a re
match of last year's heroic effort by
Stanford, which ended the Huskies'
record 90-game winning streak.
