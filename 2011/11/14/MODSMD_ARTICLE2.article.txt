# DREAMS DASHED
## Oregon runs by Stanford again to end perfect season 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
It had been 406 days since the Stanford
football team last lost a game.
But on Saturday night against the Ore
gon Ducks, the Cardinal experienced the
worst form of deja vu.

For the second time in as many years,
the No. 4 Ducks undressed the No. 9 Cardi
nal in a prime-time showdown, rolling to a
53-30 victory that stamped out Stanford's
perfect season and ended its hopes for a
national championship.

The Ducks took the early lead in the
first quarter and never looked back, capi
talizing on five Stanford turnovers in
cluding two interceptions and a fumble
from star quarterback Andrew Luck
that spelled disaster for the Cardinal.

Redshirt junior quarterback Andrew Luck struggled all day, turning the ball over three times as No. 9 Stanford suffered its first loss of the season, 53-30.
No. 4 Oregon took an early lead and never looked back, pounding the Cardinal on both sides of the ball to claim control of the Pac- 12 North.
"They took advantage of our
turnovers," said head coach David
Shaw. "You play against a team
that's got that kind of speed and that
kind of talent and is as well-coached
as they are, you turn the ball over,
you can't win."
Luck, who finished 27-of-41 pass
ing for 271 yards and three touch
downs, had a harsh assessment of his
play.
"Not good enough to win," he
said. "Worst game of the year, I
guess, in that category."
But even with his hopes to play
for a national championship and
perhaps his Heisman campaign
dashed so forcefully, the redshirt
junior tried to grasp for perspective.
"It's disappointing obviously,"
Luck said. "Disappointment, yes,
but life goes on. We've got two more
games coming up."
Overall, the Cardinal's perform
ance was not up to par mostly
due to the Ducks forcing a season
high five turnovers and sacking
Luck a season-high three times. The
offense scored a season-low 30
points and rushed for a season-low
129 yards.
Shaw admitted that his team did
not perform up to expectations but
was also quick to point out that Ore
gon was not just any other oppo
nent.
"I don't think we gave them our
best game, and they took advantage
of it," he said. "They're not a good
team, they're a great team. That
LSU game [a 40-27 Ducks loss earli
er this season], if they don't turn the
ball over against LSU, they might be
ranked No. 1 in the nation right
now."
Oregon's lightning-fast offense
didn't rack up an insane amount of

yards (unlike the 626 it hung on the
Cardinal defense last season), but it
continually capitalized on a short
field with big plays set up by a fero
cious defense.

Oregon's first big play of the
night came on the Cardinal's third
drive in the first quarter, as Luck
fired a dreadful pass directly into the
arms of Oregon linebacker Dewitt
Stuckey, who returned it to set up a
touchdown and two-point conver
sion that made the score 8-0 early
on.

Redshirt junior running back
LaMichael James then ripped off
the first big play of the day for the
Duck offense in the second quarter,
juking past senior safety Delano
Howell for a 58-yard touchdown
that made the score 15-6 in Oregon's
favor.

After Stanford made a field goal,
the Cardinal defense forced the
Duck offense to a fourth down at
the Stanford 41-yard line. Needing
seven yards to keep the drive alive,
quarterback Darron Thomas found
running back De' Anthony Thomas
on a screen pass, and the speedster
jetted untouched into the end zone
to extend the lead to 22-9.

Luck did engineer a brisk drive
to make the score 22-16 at half time,
but the Cardinal wouldn't make it
any closer after that, as the Ducks
found ways to make impact plays
over and over again in the second
half.

Oregon receiver Josh Huff took
a Darron Thomas pass and made
two defenders miss for a 59-yard
touchdown on the Ducks' first drive
of the third quarter, then James took
in his second score of the day after a
Luck fumble to make it 36-16. The
two quick scores put the Cardinal

down by 20 with 22 minutes left in
the game, a deficit that proved far
too large to overcome, even though
the Cardinal cut the Oregon lead to
13 two times after that.

The final margin was set when
Luck threw his third pick-six of the
season in the fourth quarter off the
hands of freshman wide receiver Ty
Montgomery the ghastly cherry
on top of Stanford's already miser
able day.

When the dust that the Ducks
kicked up finally cleared, James fin
ished with 146 yards rushing and
three touchdowns, certainly putting
him back into the Heisman conver
sation, and Darron Thomas went 11-
of-17 through the air for 155 yards
and three touchdowns.

The loss left a conspicuously bit
ter taste in the mouths of the Cardi
nal, which found little to be positive
about as a whole.

"You can't miss a tackle or it goes
for 60 yards and a touchdown," said
redshirt sophomore defensive end
Ben Gardner. "And that happened
far too many times tonight."
"With a team like this, once they
get a lead, that's what they're built
for," Shaw echoed. "In spurts we
played well, but just playing well
against a great team not a good
team you can't win."

And while the Ducks' domi
nance made the Cardinal's short
term sourness understandable,
Stanford won't be able to afford any
hangover effects if it wants to play it
self into a BCS bowl for the second
season in a row.

Indeed, the Cardinal still has
two games remaining on its sched
ule home contests against Cal
and Notre Dame and can still
make it to a BCS bowl with two

more victories.
"I had no grand illusions of just
showing up and things just falling for
our team just because we show up
on Saturdays," Luck continued.
"We've still got football left, and for
that, I'm grateful. Hopefully, more
games after the conference season is
over. There's still goals left for us to
accomplish."
Shaw said that his team would
not need any extra help to finish the

season strong especially after
Saturday's dreadful deja vu.
"I expect them to rebound great
ly," he said. "We've got a lot of guys
in our locker room with a lot of char
acter. We've got two regular-season
games left, and next week is Cal. We
don't need help with motivation this
week."

for a national championship and
perhaps his Heisman campaign
dashed so forcefully, the redshirt
junior tried to grasp for perspective.
"It's disappointing obviously,"
Luck said. "Disappointment, yes,
but life goes on. We've got two more
games coming up."
Overall, the Cardinal's perform
ance was not up to par mostly
due to the Ducks forcing a season
high five turnovers and sacking
Luck a season-high three times. The
offense scored a season-low 30
points and rushed for a season-low
129 yards.
Shaw admitted that his team did
not perform up to expectations but
was also quick to point out that Ore
gon was not just any other oppo
nent.
"I don't think we gave them our
best game, and they took advantage
of it," he said. "They're not a good
team, they're a great team. That
LSU game [a 40-27 Ducks loss earli
er this season], if they don't turn the
ball over against LSU, they might be
ranked No. 1 in the nation right
now."
Oregon's lightning-fast offense
didn't rack up an insane amount of

yards (unlike the 626 it hung on the
Cardinal defense last season), but it
continually capitalized on a short
field with big plays set up by a fero
cious defense.

Oregon's first big play of the
night came on the Cardinal's third
drive in the first quarter, as Luck
fired a dreadful pass directly into the
arms of Oregon linebacker Dewitt
Stuckey, who returned it to set up a
touchdown and two-point conver
sion that made the score 8-0 early
on.

Redshirt junior running back
LaMichael James then ripped off
the first big play of the day for the
Duck offense in the second quarter,
juking past senior safety Delano
Howell for a 58-yard touchdown
that made the score 15-6 in Oregon's
favor.

After Stanford made a field goal,
the Cardinal defense forced the
Duck offense to a fourth down at
the Stanford 41-yard line. Needing
seven yards to keep the drive alive,
quarterback Darron Thomas found
running back De' Anthony Thomas
on a screen pass, and the speedster
jetted untouched into the end zone
to extend the lead to 22-9.

Luck did engineer a brisk drive
to make the score 22-16 at half time,
but the Cardinal wouldn't make it
any closer after that, as the Ducks
found ways to make impact plays
over and over again in the second
half.

Oregon receiver Josh Huff took
a Darron Thomas pass and made
two defenders miss for a 59-yard
touchdown on the Ducks' first drive
of the third quarter, then James took
in his second score of the day after a
Luck fumble to make it 36-16. The
two quick scores put the Cardinal

down by 20 with 22 minutes left in
the game, a deficit that proved far
too large to overcome, even though
the Cardinal cut the Oregon lead to
13 two times after that.

The final margin was set when
Luck threw his third pick-six of the
season in the fourth quarter off the
hands of freshman wide receiver Ty
Montgomery the ghastly cherry
on top of Stanford's already miser
able day.

When the dust that the Ducks
kicked up finally cleared, James fin
ished with 146 yards rushing and
three touchdowns, certainly putting
him back into the Heisman conver
sation, and Darron Thomas went 11-
of-17 through the air for 155 yards
and three touchdowns.

The loss left a conspicuously bit
ter taste in the mouths of the Cardi
nal, which found little to be positive
about as a whole.

"You can't miss a tackle or it goes
for 60 yards and a touchdown," said
redshirt sophomore defensive end
Ben Gardner. "And that happened
far too many times tonight."
"With a team like this, once they
get a lead, that's what they're built
for," Shaw echoed. "In spurts we
played well, but just playing well
against a great team not a good
team you can't win."

And while the Ducks' domi
nance made the Cardinal's short
term sourness understandable,
Stanford won't be able to afford any
hangover effects if it wants to play it
self into a BCS bowl for the second
season in a row.

Indeed, the Cardinal still has
two games remaining on its sched
ule home contests against Cal
and Notre Dame and can still
make it to a BCS bowl with two

more victories.
"I had no grand illusions of just
showing up and things just falling for
our team just because we show up
on Saturdays," Luck continued.
"We've still got football left, and for
that, I'm grateful. Hopefully, more
games after the conference season is
over. There's still goals left for us to
accomplish."
Shaw said that his team would
not need any extra help to finish the

season strong especially after
Saturday's dreadful deja vu.
"I expect them to rebound great
ly," he said. "We've got a lot of guys
in our locker room with a lot of char
acter. We've got two regular-season
games left, and next week is Cal. We
don't need help with motivation this
week."

Redshirt junior quarterback Andrew Luck was under pressure all game long.
The offensive line allowed Luck to be sacked a season-high three times as No.
4 Oregon routed No. 9 Stanford 53-30. The Cardinal also committed a season-high
five turnovers as Stanford's undefeated season came to an end.
It had been 406 days since the Stanford
football team last lost a game.
But on Saturday night against the Ore
gon Ducks, the Cardinal experienced the
worst form of deja vu.

For the second time in as many years,
the No. 4 Ducks undressed the No. 9 Cardi
nal in a prime-time showdown, rolling to a
53-30 victory that stamped out Stanford's
perfect season and ended its hopes for a
national championship.

The Ducks took the early lead in the
first quarter and never looked back, capi
talizing on five Stanford turnovers in
cluding two interceptions and a fumble
from star quarterback Andrew Luck
that spelled disaster for the Cardinal.

Redshirt junior quarterback Andrew Luck struggled all day, turning the ball over three times as No. 9 Stanford suffered its first loss of the season, 53-30.
No. 4 Oregon took an early lead and never looked back, pounding the Cardinal on both sides of the ball to claim control of the Pac- 12 North.
"They took advantage of our
turnovers," said head coach David
Shaw. "You play against a team
that's got that kind of speed and that
kind of talent and is as well-coached
as they are, you turn the ball over,
you can't win."
Luck, who finished 27-of-41 pass
ing for 271 yards and three touch
downs, had a harsh assessment of his
play.
"Not good enough to win," he
said. "Worst game of the year, I
guess, in that category."
