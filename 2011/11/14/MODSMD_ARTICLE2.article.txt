# DREAMS DASHED
## Oregon runs by Stanford again to end perfect season 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
It had been 406 days since the Stanford
football team last lost a game.
But on Saturday night against the Ore
gon Ducks, the Cardinal experienced the
worst form of deja vu.

For the second time in as many years,
the No. 4 Ducks undressed the No. 9 Cardi
nal in a prime-time showdown, rolling to a
53-30 victory that stamped out Stanford's
perfect season and ended its hopes for a
national championship.

The Ducks took the early lead in the
first quarter and never looked back, capi
talizing on five Stanford turnovers in
cluding two interceptions and a fumble
from star quarterback Andrew Luck
that spelled disaster for the Cardinal.

No. 4 Oregon took an early lead and never looked back, pounding the Cardinal on both sides of the ball to claim control of the Pac- 12 North.
