## Senate site launch still delayed ASSU limits access to Senate records, bills 
### EDWARD NGAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Technical and organizational
challenges have delayed the launch
of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
website, limiting access to the Sen
ate's proceedings, bills and funding
decisions, all of which are required
by ASSU bylaws to be publicly avail
able.
In the site's absence, the Senate is
publishing proceedings via online
archives of messages sent on the
Senate email list. Individuals who
wish to access the information must
locate the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate mailing list through the Uni
versity's Information Technology
Services website and download the
Senate's proceedings from emails.
"[All our proceedings] are avail
able publicly," said Dan Ashton 'l4,
Deputy Chair of the ASSU Senate.
"All [meeting minutes, bills and pro
ceedings] are sent out on the public
Senate list which is archived and ac
cessible. So while the website is
down, that's the public way of stu
dents getting the information."
This fulfills the Senate's obliga
tion to publish any funding decisions
within a week of the meeting they
were made, although the informa
tion is more difficult to access.
"Obviously, the website is much
preferred," Ashton said.
The Senate website has tradition
ally been a resource for the campus
community to see ASSU resolutions
and spending decisions.
"Basically, every [Senate] com
mittee uses it as away of publishing
their information and their proj
ects," Ashton said.
Meanwhile, the site's Webmaster
Daniel Holstein 'l3 said he is still fin
ishing development on the site and
that it is "coming soon."
"[The site] will be up hopefully
within a week or two," he said.
"There was a lot of work needed to
be done to get it functional, and it's
still being done."
"It's mainly been touch-up issues
and getting access," he added. "And
then once I got access, things kept
having to be done. I was like 'Wow.
There's no database here'... It was
cleared out from last year. The URL
... wasn't pointing to [the right des
tination]."

Development of the website was
delayed even before the discovery
of these technical issues. Confusion
between the ASSU and its financial
branch, Stanford Student Enterpris

es (SSE), regarding authorization to
access and edit the site, held up the
process for over a month at the be
ginning of the academic year.
When Holstein finally gained ac
cess to the site, with the responsibili
ty to code the site and upload budg
ets, bills, meeting notes and other
Senate proceedings throughout the
year, he said the ASSU offered him
$5OO in compensation.
Despite the delays, both Ashton
and Holstein said they expect the
website to be up and running within
the next few weeks.

"[The new site] is in line graphi
cally with the new ASSU website,"
Holstein said. "There are many aes
thetic upgrades, and there are a lot
of ease-of-navigation upgrades that
we're implementing as well."
