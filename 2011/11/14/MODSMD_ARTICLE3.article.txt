## Senate site launch still delayed ASSU limits access to Senate records, bills 
### EDWARD NGAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Technical and organizational
challenges have delayed the launch
of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
website, limiting access to the Sen
ate's proceedings, bills and funding
decisions, all of which are required
by ASSU bylaws to be publicly avail
able.
In the site's absence, the Senate is
publishing proceedings via online
archives of messages sent on the
Senate email list. Individuals who
wish to access the information must
locate the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate mailing list through the Uni
versity's Information Technology
Services website and download the
Senate's proceedings from emails.
"[All our proceedings] are avail
able publicly," said Dan Ashton 'l4,
Deputy Chair of the ASSU Senate.
"All [meeting minutes, bills and pro
ceedings] are sent out on the public
Senate list which is archived and ac
cessible. So while the website is
down, that's the public way of stu
dents getting the information."
This fulfills the Senate's obliga
tion to publish any funding decisions
within a week of the meeting they
were made, although the informa
tion is more difficult to access.
"Obviously, the website is much
preferred," Ashton said.
The Senate website has tradition
ally been a resource for the campus
community to see ASSU resolutions
and spending decisions.
"Basically, every [Senate] com
mittee uses it as away of publishing
their information and their proj
ects," Ashton said.
Meanwhile, the site's Webmaster
Daniel Holstein 'l3 said he is still fin
ishing development on the site and
that it is "coming soon."
