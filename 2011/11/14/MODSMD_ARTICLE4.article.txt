## Vets event probes civilian-military gap Veterans Day speakers explore separation 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
The Haas Center for Public Ser
vice and the Stanford Military Ser
vice Network co-hosted a Veterans
Day barbeque at Kappa Alpha
(KA) Friday. Members of United
Students for Veterans' Health
(USVH) also volunteered at the
event.
Professor of political science
Larry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B Ph.D.
'BO spoke and said that separation
between America's civilian and mili
tary life can be "dangerous for a
democracy."
He said the day not only honors
the sacrifice of service members but
is also a reminder of the need to heal
the wedge between these two
spheres.
Around 56 people attended the
barbeque, according to Tim Hsia, a

law student and former U.S. Army
Infantry Captain. He called this a
"good number" and commented
that the veterans' clubs at Stanford's
law and business schools were hold
ing similar events at the same time

and that he hoped to consolidate
their efforts next year.
Colonel Joseph Felter, a senior
research fellow at the Center for
International Security and Coop
eration (CISAC), spoke at the

barbeque.
"This is just a time of tremen
dous sacrifice," Felter said. "I think
no one here is oblivious to that, but
I think our country unfortunately
might be in 'Planet Palo Alto' some
times, a little insulated from that in
credible sacrifice that's going on.
There's war going on, and people
are in harm's way."
He called the Faculty Senate's
vote last April to invite ROTC
back to campus a "great gesture" in
helping to increase awareness
about the military amongst mem
bers of the Stanford community.
He also recognized the ROTC stu
dents who were in attendance, say
ing that service members "de
serve" to be lead by those with a
Stanford education.

"You are at Stanford," Felter
said. "Each of you has options that
are probably more lucrative, certain
ly more comfortable and absolutely
less dangerous. It's comforting to
know that our countiy will remain in
