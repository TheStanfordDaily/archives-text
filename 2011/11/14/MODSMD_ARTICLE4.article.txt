## Vets event probes civilian-military gap Veterans Day speakers explore separation 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
The Haas Center for Public Ser
vice and the Stanford Military Ser
vice Network co-hosted a Veterans
Day barbeque at Kappa Alpha
(KA) Friday. Members of United
Students for Veterans' Health
(USVH) also volunteered at the
event.
Professor of political science
Larry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B Ph.D.
'BO spoke and said that separation
between America's civilian and mili
tary life can be "dangerous for a
democracy."
He said the day not only honors
the sacrifice of service members but
is also a reminder of the need to heal
the wedge between these two
spheres.
Around 56 people attended the
barbeque, according to Tim Hsia, a

law student and former U.S. Army
Infantry Captain. He called this a
"good number" and commented
that the veterans' clubs at Stanford's
law and business schools were hold
ing similar events at the same time

and that he hoped to consolidate
their efforts next year.
Colonel Joseph Felter, a senior
research fellow at the Center for
International Security and Coop
eration (CISAC), spoke at the

barbeque.
"This is just a time of tremen
dous sacrifice," Felter said. "I think
no one here is oblivious to that, but
I think our country unfortunately
might be in 'Planet Palo Alto' some
times, a little insulated from that in
credible sacrifice that's going on.
There's war going on, and people
are in harm's way."
He called the Faculty Senate's
vote last April to invite ROTC
back to campus a "great gesture" in
helping to increase awareness
about the military amongst mem
bers of the Stanford community.
He also recognized the ROTC stu
dents who were in attendance, say
ing that service members "de
serve" to be lead by those with a
Stanford education.

"You are at Stanford," Felter
said. "Each of you has options that
are probably more lucrative, certain
ly more comfortable and absolutely
less dangerous. It's comforting to
know that our countiy will remain in

good hands."
Diamond, who is also a senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution and the
Freeman Spogli Institute for Interna
tional Studies, said that he came to
Stanford as a freshman in 1969 a
year after the University ended its
ROTC program. He called this "an
ugly period in Stanford's history" and
said that it created an "intense and
sometimes thoughtless division."
"I was opposed to the Vietnam
War, but I was also opposed to the
treatment that Vietnam veterans got
when they returned," Diamond said.
"They didn't make the decision to go
to war in Vietnam. They didn't make
the decision to fight it as unwisely and
incompetently as was done."

He said the division between serv
ice members and civilians has begun
to heal, given the military's humani
tarian work in the 19905. He also
noted that the gap cannot be fully
bridged until students and faculty
members take "the initiative to un
derstand the military more."
According to Hsia, one of the ad
vantages of having ROTC and veter
an students on-campus is the poten
tial for members of the Stanford
community to become more in
formed voters.

"People should think about our
nation's wars the cost of them and
whether or not they would want their
sons and daughters to go to war,"
Hsia said. "It's very easy to want to go
to war when the personal costs are
not felt."

Hsia said he was particularly
touched when several of his profes
sors acknowledged in class that it was

Veterans Day. According to Hsia, the
day was less about thanking service
members and more about recogniz
ing "a civic duty to know what's hap
pening."

Dennis Te 'l4 and Andrew Huo
'l5 members of USVA, a student
group that volunteers at the Menlo
Park Veterans Affair Hospital
helped to set up the event. USVA
also had a table at the entrance to KA
where individuals could make cards
that would be delivered to veterans.
Te said that while he has abstained
on the issue of bringing ROTC back
on campus empathizing with the
argument put forth by the LGBT
community he decided to volun
teer at the event because he has seen
friends go into the military. He added
that some of his mentors in high
school were also veterans.

"I figured they needed people,
and I wanted to show my support,"Te
said.

Huo said that he began volunteer
ing with the USVA because he is con
sidering medical school but added
that the Three Books program this
year, which debated war ethics, got
him thinking about the armed forces
in a new light.
"Stephen Carter [author of "The
Violence of Peace: America's Wars in
the Age of Obama"] talked about,
'What does it really mean to support
your troops if you're against war?'"
Huo said. "It's sort of a paradox. You
really have to be morally aware of
what's going on to really support
your troops and try to understand
[President Barack] Obama's justifi
cation of wars."

"I guess this is the time to really
think about what we are risking these
lives for," he said.

The Haas Center for Public Ser
vice and the Stanford Military Ser
vice Network co-hosted a Veterans
Day barbeque at Kappa Alpha
(KA) Friday. Members of United
Students for Veterans' Health
(USVH) also volunteered at the
event.
Professor of political science
Larry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B Ph.D.
'BO spoke and said that separation
between America's civilian and mili
tary life can be "dangerous for a
democracy."
He said the day not only honors
the sacrifice of service members but
is also a reminder of the need to heal
the wedge between these two
spheres.
Around 56 people attended the
barbeque, according to Tim Hsia, a

law student and former U.S. Army
Infantry Captain. He called this a
"good number" and commented
that the veterans' clubs at Stanford's
law and business schools were hold
ing similar events at the same time

and that he hoped to consolidate
their efforts next year.
Colonel Joseph Felter, a senior
research fellow at the Center for
International Security and Coop
eration (CISAC), spoke at the

barbeque.
"This is just a time of tremen
dous sacrifice," Felter said. "I think
no one here is oblivious to that, but
I think our country unfortunately
might be in 'Planet Palo Alto' some
times, a little insulated from that in
credible sacrifice that's going on.
There's war going on, and people
are in harm's way."
He called the Faculty Senate's
vote last April to invite ROTC
back to campus a "great gesture" in
helping to increase awareness
about the military amongst mem
bers of the Stanford community.
He also recognized the ROTC stu
dents who were in attendance, say
ing that service members "de
serve" to be lead by those with a
Stanford education.

"You are at Stanford," Felter
said. "Each of you has options that
are probably more lucrative, certain
ly more comfortable and absolutely
less dangerous. It's comforting to
know that our countiy will remain in

good hands."
Diamond, who is also a senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution and the
Freeman Spogli Institute for Interna
tional Studies, said that he came to
Stanford as a freshman in 1969 a
year after the University ended its
ROTC program. He called this "an
ugly period in Stanford's history" and
said that it created an "intense and
sometimes thoughtless division."
"I was opposed to the Vietnam
War, but I was also opposed to the
treatment that Vietnam veterans got
when they returned," Diamond said.
"They didn't make the decision to go
to war in Vietnam. They didn't make
the decision to fight it as unwisely and
incompetently as was done."

He said the division between serv
ice members and civilians has begun
to heal, given the military's humani
tarian work in the 19905. He also
noted that the gap cannot be fully
bridged until students and faculty
members take "the initiative to un
derstand the military more."
According to Hsia, one of the ad
vantages of having ROTC and veter
an students on-campus is the poten
tial for members of the Stanford
community to become more in
formed voters.

"People should think about our
nation's wars the cost of them and
whether or not they would want their
sons and daughters to go to war,"
Hsia said. "It's very easy to want to go
to war when the personal costs are
not felt."

Hsia said he was particularly
touched when several of his profes
sors acknowledged in class that it was

Veterans Day. According to Hsia, the
day was less about thanking service
members and more about recogniz
ing "a civic duty to know what's hap
pening."
