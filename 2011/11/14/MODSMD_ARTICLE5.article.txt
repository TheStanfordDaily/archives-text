As thousands left Stanford Stadium dejectedly
following the Cardinal's loss to Oregon on
Saturday night, a fortunate few detoured to
Ford Plaza for an exclusive concert featuring Ma
roon 5. '
An enormous white tent housed the event, di
vided into a stage area and a ritzy, club-like zone
with champagne, hors d'oeuvre and a lounge com
plete with pristine white couches.
