As thousands left Stanford Stadium dejectedly
following the Cardinal's loss to Oregon on
Saturday night, a fortunate few detoured to
Ford Plaza for an exclusive concert featuring Ma
roon 5. '
An enormous white tent housed the event, di
vided into a stage area and a ritzy, club-like zone
with champagne, hors d'oeuvre and a lounge com
plete with pristine white couches.

Several unnamed Stanford
alumni hosted the private, invite
only event titled "Stanford Rocks,"
which featured a lineup including
newcomer Larissa Ness, who was
followed by Maroon 5 and Motley
Criie's Tommy Lee.

As the crowd of about 150
sipped at their drinks, Ness saun
tered onstage first and quickly
gained attention for her 30-minute
set, which included several songs
from her upcoming album, "Break
the Mold."

Supported by a ridiculously
heavy bass, backup dancers that
closely resembled the Pussycat
Dolls, a fashion sense and musical
style similar to Britney Spears with
large amounts of glitter, Ness shone
on stage in the most literal sense.
However, her powerful vocals and
array of musical talents Ness
performed two flute solos and a
piano solo during the show left
the crowd cheering for one more
song by the end of the set.
But the audience truly came
alive as Maroon 5 took the stage an
hour into the show, opening its set
with the new single "Moves Like
Jagger (feat. Christina Aguilera)."
Under neon blue lights and a

haze of fog, lead singer Adam
Levine strutted across the stage like
a glamour model in front of a crowd
largely composed of screaming
women. Though the California na
tive's microphone was a bit quiet
for the first few songs, Levine was at
his vocal best, breaking out his dis
tinctive falsetto in almost every
song.
The band performed singles
from all three of its studio albums
for an hour, including "Sunday
Morning," "Harder to Breathe,"
which was remixed with Kanye
West's "Power" for a surprisingly
catchy update, "Stutter" and per
haps its most successful hit, "This
Love."
Though Maroon 5 particular
ly guitarist James Valentine and
drummer Ryan Dusick sounded
spectacularly good, all eyes were on
Levine. Members of the crowd
wrestled with each other for a
chance to get to the front and touch
his hand, but the singer took it all in
stride, throwing out a few jokes be
tween songs.
"When you see singers turn their
heads to the side in the middle of a
song as if they're changing the
lyrics, like I just did ... they actual
ly just have to burp. Now you know
all the trade secrets," Le vine said, as
he paused to take a sip of water.
After Maroon 5 concluded with
the encore ballad "She Will Be
Loved," many fans filtered out.
Most, however, stayed for high-en
ergy performer Tommy Lee, who
finished out the show with his re
cent solo work as an electronic disc
jockey.
Though a stark contrast from his
usual rock sound, Lee's set was the
perfect end to the night. Thoughts
of fumbles and interceptions
seemed all but forgotten as the
crowd, stepping over abandoned
"Go Stanford" posters, filtered out
of the venue after midnight.

"Now you know
all the trade
secrets."
