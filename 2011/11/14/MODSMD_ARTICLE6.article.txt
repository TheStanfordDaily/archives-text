## Project shows early social networks 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN 
A project led by Stanford re
searchers made gains in documenting
the extensive social networks, similar
to today's online platforms such as
Facebook and Twitter, that existed as
long ago as 1500.
The project, entitled "Mapping the
Republic of Letters," aimed to create a
visual illustration of the "Republic of
Letters" a term used to denote the
widespread exchange of ideas and
thoughts between leading intellectuals
through letters during the early mod
ern period, between 1500 and 1800.
"This was a project that did not
evolve out of an interest in using
technology or doing things with the
digital humanities in the first
place," said Dan Edelstein, associ
ate professor of French and Italian
and the project's principal re
searcher. "This project emerged
from an academic problem."

Researchers at the Stanford Hu
manities Center began with data
compiled by the University of Ox
ford's Electronic Enlightenment
project to map this interchange of
letters. By organizing and coding
these vast stores of data some
55,000 letters Stanford re
searchers created a visualization
tool that enabled researchers to un
derstand the scale of the Republic
of Letters.

The idea for the project was born
from "The Republic of Letters," a
conference held on Stanford cam
pus in the late fall of 2007.
"Tony Grafton [professor of his
tory at Princeton University and a

contributor at the conference]
pointed out that nobody really
knows what this whole thing looks
like . . . because there is just so
much information," Edelstein said.
"I work on Voltaire's correspon
dence, which has 18,000 letters. Mul
tiply it by all the figures in the Re
public of Letters and you have an
avalanche of data."

The project has allowed Edel
stein's team, which includes a num
ber of graduate students' and pro
fessors' contributing case studies, to
explore the social networks that un
derlie geographic relationships.
"We can go back and think about
this question again," he said. "We
can use the empirical observations
as a springboard for formulating
new hypotheses."
Edelstein characterized the proj
ect as an illustration of Stanford's
approach to the digital humanities.
"We aren't trying to transform
the study of humanities into a quan
titative science," he said. "We are
using quantitative methods to for
mulate new questions."
The project also contributes new
information to Stanford's Bib
lioTech program, a conference

based initiative that explores the re
lationship between humanities
graduates and Silicon Valley.

"This is the first moment where
people are partaking in these pub
lic conversations in writing ... con
versation explodes," said Anai's
Saint-Jude, BiblioTech's director.
"It's very much akin to what is
going on today with Facebook,
blogs, Twitter ... the proliferation
of new virtual spaces that allows
for lots of new communication
across the world. It's akin to what it
feels like for us a psychological
avalanche."
Edelstein also mentioned future
research that could stem from the
project. He is currently working in
conjunction with University of Ox
ford researchers on a mapping of
major places of publication in the
1700s. He aims to examine the in
terdependencies between geo
graphic place and published con
tent.

"Why are some places more im
portant than others in different in
tellectual climates?" he said.
