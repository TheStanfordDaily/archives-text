## Study points to Bay Area's concentrated poverty 
### SARAH MOORE 
More than 40 percent of resi
dents in the Bay Area's five poorest
neighborhoods live below the
poverty line, according to a recent
study by the Brookings Institution.
The six-month study, entitled
"The Re-Emergence of Concen
trated Poverty," surveyed loca
tions around the country. It identi
fied Alameda Point, Berkeley,
Hunter's Point, uptown Oakland
and West Oakland as Bay Area
neighborhoods with at least 40
percent of the population living
below the poverty line.
However, only 1.2 percent of the
overall metropolitan population
concentration in the San Francisco-
Oakland-Fremont region was
found to be living below the pover
ty line.

According to the U.S. Depart
ment of Health and Human Ser
vices, the current poverty threshold,
adjusted for inflation, for a single
person household is an annual in
come of $10,830.
"If people have income that's
discretionary, they can spend it on
restaurants clothes, entertainment
and a lot of things that support a
much wider range of businesses,"
said Sean Randolph, president of
the Bay Area Council Economic In
stitute, for which President John
Hennessy serves on the Board of
Trustees.

"If you have communities with
very low incomes, they are probably
drawing on public services and are
unable to contribute in ways that
they might otherwise be able to
the larger economy around them,"
he said.

In order to improve upon these
numbers, Brookings Institution Se
nior Research Associate and the
study's lead researcher Elizabeth
Kneebone suggested the imple
mentation of new policies.

"Policies that foster balanced
and sustainable economic growth at
the regional level and that forge
connections between growing clus
ters of low-income neighborhoods
and regional economic opportunity
will be key to longer-term progress

against concentrated disadvan
tage," she said.
The study comes at a time when
the Occupy Wall Street movement
has already sparked nationwide dis
cussions on the definition of class
gaps.

"The majority of people who are
below the official poverty line enjoy
a level of consumption that my par
ents never enjoyed," said John Pen
cavel, senior fellow at the Stanford
Institute for Economic Policy Re
search (SIEPR). "Poverty is a rela
tive concept. It is a measure really
relative to the consumption level of
other people in the community."
The report also found that the
percentage of people living in
neighborhoods across the country
with 40 percent or more of residents
living below the poverty line in
creased from 9.1 percent to 10.5
percent over the past 10 years. How
ever, this percentage actually de
creased in the Bay Area.
This change could stem from the
study's finding that the populations
of extreme-poverty neighborhoods
increased more than twice as quick
ly in suburbs than in urban neigh
borhoods.

"We've had poverty throughout
the Bay Area for a really long time,"
Randolph said. "If we've seen some
amelioration of those conditions in
the last 10 years, then it's a good
thing, especially in light of the re
cent recession that we've just been
through."
According to Randolph, im
provements upon these numbers
have the potential to impact the na
tional economy.
"What you want from a public
policy standpoint is to have that
group be as small as possible, and
you want pathways available to en
able them to increase their income
and their quality of life," Randolph
said. "Of course, you want to see
measures that show that circum
stances are indeed getting better, so
it's what we want with the Brook
ings study showing improvements
withstanding the recession."
