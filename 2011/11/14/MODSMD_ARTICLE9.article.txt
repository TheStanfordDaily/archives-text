## AT Home in Australia NOTES FROM ABROAD 
### â€“ Katy Storch 
Home: it wasn't until I heard my
Australian host mother,
Maree, say it that I really con
templated the sound of the
word itself.
Maree and her husband, Stan, took me
and my host sister, Elise, in for the first three
weeks of our time with Stanford's program
in Australian Coastal Studies. During these
weeks, we were studying the intricacies of
coastal resource management from 9 a.m.
until 5 p.m. at the University of Queensland.
We would return to Maree and Stan daily,
whining about the schedule and its toll on
our wellness, describing the stale air and
windowless room we were cooped up in for
all those hours.
And Maree and Stan would listen, patient

and sympathetic. Stan, in his mid 60s and
an avid road cyclist, would shake his
head at the injustice of it all,
while Maree, cautious with
her well-placed wit, would
echo our concerns.
Maree and Stan took us out to the
Gold Coast beaches on our first weekend
off. We travelled to Noosa and Mooloolaba,
two picturesque beach towns, where we ate
gelati, shopped for produce at a local market
and had our first swim in the Pacific Ocean
on the other end of the globe.
During that trip, Elise and I practiced say
ing the word "home" in an Australian accent.
It was Maree who inspired it; there was
something gentle and soothing about the
way she said the word every single time.
So we practiced and practiced. We prac
ticed throughout the rest of our stay with our
host family. We practiced after we left them
to traverse Queensland, on the cattle ranch
in far north Queensland and on the white
sandy beaches of Heron Island. We would
reminisce about our stay with Maree and
Stan; about the warm, buttery tone of
Maree's voice and her clever teasing; or

Stan's
bear hugs
and light-heart
ed chuckle. We Z "
missed the gentle
sounds of the home that we
had come to love.
There are 47 Stanford students studying
here in Australia. Some of us have seen the
first kangaroo, shark and koala of our lives.
We've watched the sun rise and set over the
Great Dividing Range. We've counted
shooting stars on the beach, the
sound of whistling wind and

to sleep.
My home, once a
concept that kindled images
of family and green oceans, ex
tended in the past few years to encompass
the echo of "oh-twelve" chants and the clunk
of loose red bricks shifting under the weight
of bicycles on Stanford's paths. It stretched
further last year, when I studied abroad in
Florence, to include mozzarella gnocchi and
Lorenzo Ghiberti's gold doors at the Baptis
tery. And now its scope has widened to in
clude Australia's beaches and the mirror-re
flections of constellations I grew up tracing
with my finger.
Home: the word lassos a swirl of emo
tions and images. For me, home is family.
Home is the warmth of the hospitable a
buttery voice and unconditional love.
