# THE

## Imperfect information 
### Nina Chung 
Surprises happen when assump
tions are made, and these days, all
I can think about is how much
people surprise me. What does that
mean? It means I'm making assump
tions all over the place.
To a certain degree, this is natural.
Every day we take certain things for
granted the chair won't break once
we sit on it, the bottled water is
potable, the stranger we're shaking
hands with is not a sociopath. With
these instantaneous judgments set
tled, we can spend our time pursuing
other, more complex questions. But
actually, our effortless habit ol pre

suming the conditions ol other people
easily becomes questionable ground
for how we treat them. Maybe it's too
easy to square people off into a men
tal database of passions, lifestyles or
patterns of thinking. Too many times,
I've been immeasurably wrong and
shaken up by an inaccurate assump
tion, which I only realize I made after
it came crashing down. I wonder, if I
had come to the table knowing I did
n't know any of the cards being
played, would I have been less criti
cal? Less demanding? Less harsh?
One evening last week, a friend
from several years ago approached

me to chat. Our brief conversation
turned to the topic of one of our older
mutual friends. So far, normal. But
within moments, I found myself
shocked at what I was hearing
namely, our mutual friend's attitude
toward me now. I couldn't believe
how taken aback I was. Before that
moment, I hadn't considered that our
friend could think of me that particu
lar way. And yet, there it was a part
of the world that existed, that was be
yond me, and that reversed the logic
with which I had understood that per
son for years.
By no means is this ignorance an

isolated incident. Some of our friends
are going through the hardest times of
their lives at this very moment, but no
one would ever guess. Others are
watching family members suffer, but
are coping peacefully in quiet. Ulti
mately, these are extraordinary cir
cumstances being contained in our
seemingly normal lives. I used to think
they happened only unusually, on tel
evision or in the movies. But the most
bizarre and intricate dramas are un
folding in the lives around us all the
time, even if we're never let in on the
secrets. Most surprising are the events
we learn of in past tense. A friend of
mine, for example, spent last year
dealing with some issues, though I did
n't find out until this past weekend. At
that point, every seemingly casual
conversation we had shared before
was changed in meaning immediately.
The world's hidden unevenness of
information isn't relieved, either, by
our uncanny ability to smile away
"hard times." In fact, we've become
the ultimate traitors of our own is
sues with smiles and Hemingway
esque "Good, wonderful, alright!" re
sponses. I believe laughter has the
power to heal emotional wounds and
bad memories. But I'm starting to see
how well it aids denial, too, under
mining graveness when it's falsely
done. For everyone else, this means
that even when we are aware of
things happening in other people's
lives, the significance might fly right
over our heads.
Information is asymmetric. We
will never have complete access to the
back-stories of all of the people
around us, whom we strive to figure
out and understand in totality. Unfor
tunately, this goes in contrast with the
modern man's pursuit of godlike
knowledge of the world and every
one around them. Indeed, sometimes
we even let ourselves feel authorita
tive enough to disapprove of other
people, speak condescendingly to
them or complain about them in gen
eral. But I wonder how presumptu
ous this behavior is, when we seldom
know what complications are color
ing their life at that very moment. If
we knew that we actually know very
little, would we be more patient?
Would we be more forgiving? More
loving? Or, perhaps the bigger ques
tion: would we choose to change our
behavior at all?
The students walking past us in the
halls and sitting next to us in class are
all going through any number of
things in their life. We won't and don't
know. The team member who shows
up irritatingly late to meetings, the
frustrating rambler in section, the
overcompensating intellectual, the re
lationship strategist or whoever we
allow ourselves to be offended by
they all have a story behind them,
whoever they are at this point in time.
And after all, who am I to assume
otherwise? For any stranger and ac
quaintance in my life observing any
number of unknown things in his or
her life right now, I'm trying to re
member that the only thing they
should be getting from me is the ben
efit of the doubt. It's a small thing
or maybe the best thing? that
everybody really deserves.
