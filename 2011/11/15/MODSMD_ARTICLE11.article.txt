## TABLETS FOR THE BLIND 
### PINNAREE TEA-MANGKORNPAN 
Using a tablet computer is a com
plicated task for the visually im
paired, with few tactile reference
points on the screen and few, if
any, built-in features to make it
easier. But thanks to research this summer by
Adam Duran, a New Mexico State Universi
ty senior, that may soon change.
Duran participated in the Army High Per
formance Computing Research Center (AH
PCRC) summer internship program at Stan
ford. There, he and his mentors, assistant me
chanical engineering professor Adrian Lew
and Sohan Dharmaraja Ph.D. 'll, developed
an application that enables visually impaired
people to easily use keyboards on touch
screen devices. The AHPCRC summer intern
program selected 15 undergraduates from all
over the country to come to Stanford and
work with faculty and graduate students on
an assigned research project.
Duran and his team started even before
the interns arrived on campus.
The AHPCRC "gave us some Android
tablets and said, 'Do something with them,'"
Lew said.
He and Dharmaraja wanted to create a
Braille character-recognition program that
would use the camera to take a picture and
then translate the picture into voice.
"We were really enthusiastic about it be
cause it was doing something that could help
people," Duran said.
However, when Dharmaraja went to talk
to the Stanford Office of Accessible Educa
tion (OAE), the project began to change.
"They [the OAE] told us that there was no
real, good method for blind people to type,"
Dharmaraja said. "It seems a little unreason
able to expect a blind person to use the cam
era to take a good, accurate picture. So we
changed that project and decided to do a
writer for Braille."
Lew, who had a blind student in his spring
quarter class, agreed with this new idea.
"That was resonating with me because I

have seen this student taking notes in class
with the bulky Braillewriter with buttons,"
Lew said.
The Braillewriter keyboard has eight keys,
one for each finger. Lew emphasized the im
portance of these eight positions because
they mean the visually impaired individual
doesn't have to change the position of their
fingers.
"The tablet mimics the Braille writer peo
ple used to use," Lew said. "That's the good
thing of the application. They [the blind] don't
have to learn it they know it already."
Lew, Dharmaraja and Duran started
working on the application. Since none of
them knew how to program tablets, they had
to learn the process from scratch. But that did
not deter them.
"Sohan and I would code something,"
Duran said. "I would blindfold myself and try
to use the tablet without any of Sohan's help
and vice versa. Once we were comfortable
typing blindfolded ... we took it to someone
who is visually impaired to get feedback from
them. Everything kind of derived from expe
rience,"
After several iterations, they finally came
up with a breakthrough solution for the inter
face. Instead of having the fingers find the
keyboards, they programmed the application
to find the positions of the fingers when in
contact with the screen.
"I think we found a nice way to solve the
problem because it was very natural put
your eight fingers there, and you have the
keys," said Lew. "It is a nice, simple solution
and does not require much from the user."
As for the future of the application, the
team wants it to be "in the hands of those who
need it," Dharmaraja said. "Our goal is to
make sure that this gets developed and gets
out soon."
The New Mexico State University senior
said he benefitted greatly from his summer
experience.
"One thing that I was fortunate to learn
from Sohan and Professor Lew is they do 100
percent all the time," Duran said. "It was just
so gratifying to be able to do the work and ac
tually see people use it."

I would blindfold myself and try to use the tablet
without any of Sohans help and vice versa.
