## Accelerating startups to exceed expectations 
### DRUTHI GHANTA 
It's 11 p.m. on a Friday night
and the ground floor of the
AOL building is bustling with
energy. Stanford students
slave in the office, working
hard on the whiteboards and at
their desks to refine their startups.
While most of these students are
working on different projects, they
are united by their participation in
StartX, a Stanford-based startup ac
celerator.
Founded in 2009 by Cameron
Teitelman 'll, StartX is a startup
"incubator" that brings budding en
trepreneurs together to help them
accelerate their infant companies.
Many students apply; however, to
be admitted, their applications need
to show they have more than just a
product idea.
"We choose our applicants not
simply by their idea, but rather by
the quality of dedication and pas
sion they will have towards their
company's success," Teitelman said.
StartX focuses on providing ac
cepted applicants with four core re
sources: a network, business re
sources, entrepreneurial education
and a strong community. The ac
cepted applicants, whom StartX
calls "founders," gain a strong net

work of mentors to help them cre
ate their company step-by-step.
StartX gives its mentors free office
space for cooperating and working
with the accelerator. It also gives
the budding entrepreneurs business
resources, including free office
space, accounting and banking re
sources, legal support, web servers
and summer stipends.
StartX satisfies all of these needs
in hopes that it will eliminate minor
tasks that distract from building a
company.
Tliis philosophy is "away to help
the founders focus on the company
instead of trying to micromanage
aspects of a startup that could easi
ly be handled by a third party, like
StartX," Teitelman said.
The accelerator also provides a
three-month-long customized edu
cation, which encourages fast paced
communication between mentors
and companies.
"Companies are often asked
what they need, and we cater to
that," Teitelman said. "We realize
that time is super crucial, and in a
session that is only three months,
everyone accepts that and works to
gather information at an accelerat
ed pace."

Divya Nag 'l3 works with StartX
to improve a startup that she co

founded. Nag went through a StartX
session last year and is participating
once again in the fall session.
StartX helped teach her to be
come business savvy in running a
startup.
"I learned about equities and
other items of interest on the busi
ness side," Nag said. "That proved
to be really helpful while connect
ing with mentors and other startup
founders."
Others also find benefits from
the organization. Foreign leaders in
academia and private industry visit
StartX to "learn about success,"
Teitelman said. "They hope to emu
late what we have here at Stanford,
and we're happy to help those who
want to help entrepreneurs both
domestically and internationally."
This sense of community among
entrepreneurs resonates with
StartX's mission. "It's being sur
rounded by a group of passionate
individuals at 11 p.m. on a Friday
night that motivates us to work
harder," said Joseph Huang M.S.
'll. "When you're surrounded by
people who do what they love and
are good at it, you work to exceed
expectations."
