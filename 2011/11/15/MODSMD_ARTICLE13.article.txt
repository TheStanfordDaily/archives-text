## OPENING SALVO 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Prior to the season, sophomore point
guard Aaron Bright looked like he could
be the odd man out in Stanford's rota
tion. Now, he just may be the best player
on the team.

Bright dazzled for the second straight
game, leading all scorers with 21 points as
the Cardinal (2-0) beat Fresno State 75-
59 in the opening round of the NIT Sea
son Tip-Off at Maples Pavilion. Sopho
more forward Josh Huestis contributed a
double-double off the bench for Stan
ford, which had five players score in dou
ble figures.
"You have to give Aaron a lot of cred
it," said Stanford head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "For one, he is a heck of a com
petitor. It was evident that he wanted to
improve and wanted to become a better
player. And he did. I love to see a kid will
ing to pay the price to become the player
he wants to become."
The Cardinal got off to a slow start in
the nationally televised matchup, as sen
ior big man Josh Owens took a seat less
than four minutes into the game after a
questionable over-the-back call. With
sophomore forward Dwight Powell side
lined with an ankle injury, Dawkins en
tered a period of lineup experimenta

tion, with 10 different Cardinal players
seeing the floor in just eight minutes of
play. Huestis provided the biggest lift in
relief of Owens, holding down the paint
with five points, five boards and a mon
ster block before intermission.
"Going into last year, I struggled with
confidence early," Huestis said. "Coming
into games this year, I've figured out my
role on the team and how I can play into
that to help us win."
Once again, Bright starred in the first
half.The undersized guard, who Dawkins
deemed the most improved player on the
squad, showed off his confident stroke
from range, connecting on both three
point attempts en route to 10 points in
the opening half. His two free throws at
the 8:30 mark gave Stanford its first lead
at 16-15, a lead the team never surren
dered. The addition of highly touted
freshman guard Chasson Randle has al
lowed Bright to play off the ball, a
change that has reduced his ball-han
dling responsibilities and created addi
tional shooting opportunities.
"When I go into the game, I'm not
looking to be the leading scorer," Bright
said. "If they're giving me the open shot,
I'm going to take it. Right now, it's been
working in my favor offensively."
Seniors Jack Trotter and Jarrett Mann
contributed six apiece in the first half, as
the Cardinal managed to shoot 48 per
cent from the field to begin the game.
Stanford stretched the lead to as big as
six with 1:12 remaining, but nine
