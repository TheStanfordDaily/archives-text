# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Pair of easy wins sets up Big Splash 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's water
polo team took two lopsided wins this
weekend, defeating No. 14 Santa
Clara 17-4 on Saturday and No. 12
UC-Davis 12-7 on Sunday. Neither
opponent is in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF), so Stan
ford (18-4, 5-2 MPSF) did not get a
chance to move up from fourth in the
conference standings.
The Cardinal also had its annual

alumni game on Saturday, giving the
team a chance to play against a mix of
elder statesman and current
Olympians.

"It's always fun to have a lot of the
old players come back, especially be
cause a lot of those guys have gone on
to play higher-level polo," said red

shirt sophomore goalie Scott Plat
shon.

Freshman utility Alex Bowen
started the weekend off quickly, scor
ing the first two goals of Saturday's
game on his way to a three-goal day.
By the end of the first quarter, Stan
ford held a commanding 6-1 lead over
Santa Clara. The only first-quarter
goal for the Broncos came from soph
omore 2-meter Tucker Carlson, who
scored two of the team's three goals.
The two teams combined for only
one goal in the second quarter, going

into halftime with a 7-1 score. The
Stanford offense exploded again in
the second half, though, scoring five
goals in both the third and fourth
quarters.

All three active goalies played in
the game, with redshirt senior Brian
Pingree making four saves, while Plat
shon and redshirt sophomore Hunter
Ploch made one save apiece.
Bowen broke the ice once again
on Sunday, scoring just 19 seconds
