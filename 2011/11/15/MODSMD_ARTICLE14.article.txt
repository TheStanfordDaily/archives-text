## Pair of easy wins sets up Big Splash 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's water
polo team took two lopsided wins this
weekend, defeating No. 14 Santa
Clara 17-4 on Saturday and No. 12
UC-Davis 12-7 on Sunday. Neither
opponent is in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF), so Stan
ford (18-4, 5-2 MPSF) did not get a
chance to move up from fourth in the
conference standings.
The Cardinal also had its annual

alumni game on Saturday, giving the
team a chance to play against a mix of
elder statesman and current
Olympians.

"It's always fun to have a lot of the
old players come back, especially be
cause a lot of those guys have gone on
to play higher-level polo," said red

shirt sophomore goalie Scott Plat
shon.

Freshman utility Alex Bowen
started the weekend off quickly, scor
ing the first two goals of Saturday's
game on his way to a three-goal day.
By the end of the first quarter, Stan
ford held a commanding 6-1 lead over
Santa Clara. The only first-quarter
goal for the Broncos came from soph
omore 2-meter Tucker Carlson, who
scored two of the team's three goals.
The two teams combined for only
one goal in the second quarter, going

into halftime with a 7-1 score. The
Stanford offense exploded again in
the second half, though, scoring five
goals in both the third and fourth
quarters.

All three active goalies played in
the game, with redshirt senior Brian
Pingree making four saves, while Plat
shon and redshirt sophomore Hunter
Ploch made one save apiece.
Bowen broke the ice once again
on Sunday, scoring just 19 seconds
into the game. He ended the game
with four goals, adding yet another hat
trick to his impressive freshman re
sume that includes being the third
leading scorer in the MPSF. He is av
eraging 2.42 goals per game for the
season.
For the second straight day, Stan
ford jumped out to a 6-1 lead before
halftime. But UC-Davis made a
push in the fourth quarter, scoring
four goals in the frame to make the
final score closer than it had been
for the majority of the game. Senior
Aaron Salit had four goals for the
Aggies, including two in that fourth
quarter.
Pingree ended the day with nine
saves, taking his total to 13 for the
weekend. Senior driver Jacob Smith
had five goals on the weekend, jun
ior driver Paul Rudolph had four,
redshirt junior driver Alex Avery
had three, senior utility Peter Sefton
had two and redshirt sophomore 2-
meter Forrest Watkins had three.
Redshirt junior driver Andrew
LaForge, redshirt junior 2-meter
Ryan Brown, redshirt senior driver
Sam Finlayson, redshirt senior driv
er Ryan Kent and redshirt freshman
driver Eric Wright each finished the
weekend with one goal.
A highlight within that medley of
goals was Rudolph, who has come on
strong offensively in the last two
weeks. He has scored two goals in
each of the past four games. The Car
dinal hopes that trend will continue as
it prepares for the postseason, where
goals will be at a premium against top
conference opponents.
Platshon talked about how these
non-conference games have helped
the team come together just weeks
before its crucial playoff push.
"These games are important to get
everyone on the same page as the sea
son comes to an end," he said.
