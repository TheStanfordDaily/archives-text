# Football games take too long
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I can't hold this in any more, I try to
be diplomatic about college foot
ball, and I really, honestly enjoy
the sport and the culture that sur
rounds it, but seriously, why does it
have to take so long?
When you win, and when with each
game you see your team climbing up
the rankings, it seems easier to justify
all the time you spend not only not
doing that assignment due next week,
but simply not doing anything much at
all. The weekend that was wiped out
traveling to and from the USC game
and the dollars spent on car rental and
gas were worth it because not only was
it the most exciting game of football
I've ever seen, but we won. The long
journey home didn't seem quite so bad
knowing that when I got back I'd have
a great story to tell.
But when you lose? When you're
not enjoying yourselfj the time always
drags by and you start to wonder why
you spend so much time in sports sta
diums as a fan, you are never guar
anteed success, and even when things
are going well, at some point failure
will always catch up with you. As the
game wore on against Oregon on Sat
urday and as Stanford failed to seize
on any mistakes made by the Ducks to
force itself back into the contest, I did
a lot of soul-searching.
Hoping to get the full experience,
I'd shown up at about 1 p.m. to tailgate
I admit the thought of starting even
earlier at 5 a.m. for Game Day was too
daunting a prospect and then head
ed across to the stadium two hours
later. Already the line of students wait
ing for the gates to open seemed to
stretch to the horizon, and by the time
I actually got inside I was very much
done with standing around. But look
ing up to the scoreboard the clock was
lit up with the numbers seven and five;
before even seeing a single bit of ac
tion we would have to last an hour and
15 minutes. A friend of mine, far more
savvy than I, had brought a book; I was
deeply jealous.
At Big Game two years ago, it was
even worse. To have any hope of find
ing reasonably good seats and being
able to sit next to my friends, I had to
get inside almost two hours prior to
kickoff.
Though exhausted from the waiting,
