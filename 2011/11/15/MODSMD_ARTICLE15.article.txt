# Football games take too long
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I can't hold this in any more, I try to
be diplomatic about college foot
ball, and I really, honestly enjoy
the sport and the culture that sur
rounds it, but seriously, why does it
have to take so long?
When you win, and when with each
game you see your team climbing up
the rankings, it seems easier to justify
all the time you spend not only not
doing that assignment due next week,
but simply not doing anything much at
all. The weekend that was wiped out
traveling to and from the USC game
and the dollars spent on car rental and
gas were worth it because not only was
it the most exciting game of football
I've ever seen, but we won. The long
journey home didn't seem quite so bad
knowing that when I got back I'd have
a great story to tell.
But when you lose? When you're
not enjoying yourselfj the time always
drags by and you start to wonder why
you spend so much time in sports sta
diums as a fan, you are never guar
anteed success, and even when things
are going well, at some point failure
will always catch up with you. As the
game wore on against Oregon on Sat
urday and as Stanford failed to seize
on any mistakes made by the Ducks to
force itself back into the contest, I did
a lot of soul-searching.
Hoping to get the full experience,
I'd shown up at about 1 p.m. to tailgate
I admit the thought of starting even
earlier at 5 a.m. for Game Day was too
daunting a prospect and then head
ed across to the stadium two hours
later. Already the line of students wait
ing for the gates to open seemed to
stretch to the horizon, and by the time
I actually got inside I was very much
done with standing around. But look
ing up to the scoreboard the clock was
lit up with the numbers seven and five;
before even seeing a single bit of ac
tion we would have to last an hour and
15 minutes. A friend of mine, far more
savvy than I, had brought a book; I was
deeply jealous.
At Big Game two years ago, it was
even worse. To have any hope of find
ing reasonably good seats and being
able to sit next to my friends, I had to
get inside almost two hours prior to
kickoff.
Though exhausted from the waiting,
when a game finally starts, the adrena
line kicks back in and pretty much
everyone is on their feet for the first
quarter. Lasting through almost four
hours, though, and cheering on your
team the whole way through is no
mean feat. Doing that after having al
ready been on your feet for around
four hours beforehand is a real strug
gle, and when frustration adds to the
tiredness it's hard to keep the volume
up.
For me this game was an eight
hour ordeal for a sport that just takes
60 minutes of play, and for which a sig
nificant portion of that playing time is
eaten up in the 25 seconds between
downs. The fiasco over resetting the
game clock and play clock in the
fourth quarter just rubbed salt into my
tired wounds. In comparison, the aver
age soccer game includes 90 minutes
of nearly constant play and takes less
than two hours including halftime and
stoppages. Perhaps this is why after I
hit the two-hour mark my exhausted
voice falters, and I struggle to keep
cheering on the home side and jeering
the opposition.
Football seems to me a perfect
game for TV: the ample breaks in play
supply plenty of time to fit in some ads,
a smattering of commentary and
analysis and maybe the chance of flip
ping back and forth between other
games. But these pauses aren't so ideal
for the fans in the stadium. With an av
erage of 150 plays per college game
and assuming there is a 25-second
break between each you are look
ing at an hour of nothing. Add in com

mercial breaks and that's another
hour lost. Any way to trim down that
vacuum would be nice; cutting up to 10
seconds of the play clock could reduce
the time by almost half an hour, and
with less time devoted to ads perhaps
another 30 minutes could be salvaged.
But while time-keeping might be
out of the hands of the Department of
Athletics, that doesn't mean the expe
rience couldn't be kept shorter and
sweeter. It might be no different a sit
uation than in other grounds, but I
can't help feeling that if Stanford pri
oritized those physically present, the
team might just get a little more of that
home-field advantage that perhaps
could have made a difference on Sat
urday.
Tliere was really little reason to
open the gates an hour and a half be
fore kickoff. You could cut that time to
45 minutes and still easily get every
one seated in time to stand up for the
national anthem. The price of food
and drink inside is also ridiculous;
stopping people from bringing in their
own drinks and then charging so much
is nothing short of profiteering. Tail
gating becomes a necessity because
filling up inside will break the bank,
and staying motivated when your team
is struggling isn't helped by hunger and
thirst.
Instead of a better fan experience,
what did we get? Just a free T-shirt given
out by one of Stanford's sponsors, a
bank that clearly knows so much about
the Cardinal that it decided to give out
white T-shirts.

games. But these pauses aren't so ideal
for the fans in the stadium. With an av
erage of 150 plays per college game
and assuming there is a 25-second
break between each you are look
ing at an hour of nothing. Add in com

mercial breaks and that's another
hour lost. Any way to trim down that
vacuum would be nice; cutting up to 10
seconds of the play clock could reduce
the time by almost half an hour, and
with less time devoted to ads perhaps
another 30 minutes could be salvaged.
But while time-keeping might be
out of the hands of the Department of
Athletics, that doesn't mean the expe
rience couldn't be kept shorter and
sweeter. It might be no different a sit
uation than in other grounds, but I
can't help feeling that if Stanford pri
oritized those physically present, the
team might just get a little more of that
home-field advantage that perhaps
could have made a difference on Sat
urday.
Tliere was really little reason to
open the gates an hour and a half be
fore kickoff. You could cut that time to
45 minutes and still easily get every
one seated in time to stand up for the
national anthem. The price of food
and drink inside is also ridiculous;
stopping people from bringing in their
own drinks and then charging so much
is nothing short of profiteering. Tail
gating becomes a necessity because
filling up inside will break the bank,
and staying motivated when your team
is struggling isn't helped by hunger and
thirst.
Instead of a better fan experience,
what did we get? Just a free T-shirt given
out by one of Stanford's sponsors, a
bank that clearly knows so much about
the Cardinal that it decided to give out
white T-shirts.

I can't hold this in any more, I try to
be diplomatic about college foot
ball, and I really, honestly enjoy
the sport and the culture that sur
rounds it, but seriously, why does it
have to take so long?
When you win, and when with each
game you see your team climbing up
the rankings, it seems easier to justify
all the time you spend not only not
doing that assignment due next week,
but simply not doing anything much at
all. The weekend that was wiped out
traveling to and from the USC game
and the dollars spent on car rental and
gas were worth it because not only was
it the most exciting game of football
I've ever seen, but we won. The long
journey home didn't seem quite so bad
knowing that when I got back I'd have
a great story to tell.
But when you lose? When you're
not enjoying yourselfj the time always
drags by and you start to wonder why
you spend so much time in sports sta
diums as a fan, you are never guar
anteed success, and even when things
are going well, at some point failure
will always catch up with you. As the
game wore on against Oregon on Sat
urday and as Stanford failed to seize
on any mistakes made by the Ducks to
force itself back into the contest, I did
a lot of soul-searching.
Hoping to get the full experience,
I'd shown up at about 1 p.m. to tailgate
I admit the thought of starting even
earlier at 5 a.m. for Game Day was too
daunting a prospect and then head
ed across to the stadium two hours
later. Already the line of students wait
ing for the gates to open seemed to
stretch to the horizon, and by the time
I actually got inside I was very much
done with standing around. But look
ing up to the scoreboard the clock was
lit up with the numbers seven and five;
before even seeing a single bit of ac
tion we would have to last an hour and
15 minutes. A friend of mine, far more
savvy than I, had brought a book; I was
deeply jealous.
At Big Game two years ago, it was
even worse. To have any hope of find
ing reasonably good seats and being
able to sit next to my friends, I had to
get inside almost two hours prior to
kickoff.
Though exhausted from the waiting,
when a game finally starts, the adrena
line kicks back in and pretty much
everyone is on their feet for the first
quarter. Lasting through almost four
hours, though, and cheering on your
team the whole way through is no
mean feat. Doing that after having al
ready been on your feet for around
four hours beforehand is a real strug
gle, and when frustration adds to the
tiredness it's hard to keep the volume
up.
For me this game was an eight
hour ordeal for a sport that just takes
60 minutes of play, and for which a sig
nificant portion of that playing time is
eaten up in the 25 seconds between
downs. The fiasco over resetting the
game clock and play clock in the
fourth quarter just rubbed salt into my
tired wounds. In comparison, the aver
age soccer game includes 90 minutes
of nearly constant play and takes less
than two hours including halftime and
stoppages. Perhaps this is why after I
hit the two-hour mark my exhausted
voice falters, and I struggle to keep
cheering on the home side and jeering
the opposition.
Football seems to me a perfect
game for TV: the ample breaks in play
supply plenty of time to fit in some ads,
a smattering of commentary and
analysis and maybe the chance of flip
ping back and forth between other
games. But these pauses aren't so ideal
for the fans in the stadium. With an av
erage of 150 plays per college game
and assuming there is a 25-second
break between each you are look
ing at an hour of nothing. Add in com

mercial breaks and that's another
