# Card cruises in opening round
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
After 30 scoreless minutes in
the first round of the NCAA Tour
nament, Stanford's top-ranked
women's soccer team was clearly a
little frustrated on the field. The
Cardinal seemingly had the edge
over its opponent the Universi
ty of Montana in every aspect of
the game, on paper. Yet the Griz
zlies were pressing relentlessly, and
although Stanford's defense was
not unduly taxed, the offense was
stagnant.

But a key substitution by head
coach Paul Ratcliffe was the right
move at the right time, and a slick
header from junior midfielder Mari
ah Nogueira broke the ice and the
Grizzlies' backs as Stanford (20-0-1)
secured home-field advantage
through the next two rounds of the
tournament should it advance to
Sunday's third round —with a 3-0
victory over Montana on Friday
night.
Ratcliffe wasn't too concerned
with the way his team performed
early on, particularly since the veter
an-laden squad has set very high ex
pectations.
"I want us to be challenged," he
said Friday. "We want to get back to
the national championship, and in
saying that we have to win next Fri
day. So I think we're getting better
and better... This team is going to
peak at the right time in the big
games."
Montana (6-12-4) snuck into
the tournament as the only sub
.soo team in the field, winning the
Big Sky Tournament in penalty

kicks to make its first NCAA ap
pearance since 2000. But the Griz
didn't play like a huge underdog in
the first half, taking three shots in
one five-minute stretch as they
substituted liberally and pressed
forward in waves.
And while Stanford had several
opportunities on four comer kicks
very early and some nice combina
tions in the midfield, Montana's
defense held firm in the face of
what Grizzlies' head coach Mark
Plakorus said earlier in the week
was "possibly the best college team
ever put together."
After Ratcliffe sent in sopho
more forward Sydney Payne and
sophomore midfielder Taylor Mc-
Cann, however, something clicked.
Payne created a shot on goal
just two minutes later, and senior
Camille Levin followed that up
with another chance two minutes
after that. A nice buildup kept the
ball in Montana's defensive third,
and Stanford earned its fifth corner
kick in the 39th minute.

Senior forward Lindsay Taylor,
the Pac-12 Player of the Year,
played the ball to the far post, and
Nogueira beat goalie Kristen Hoon
with a header for her third goal of
the season and a 1-0 advantage.
The Cardinal continued to
press, building a 14-4 shot advan
tage before the break. Floon was all
over the place, forced into five saves
in the half—four coming in the
final 13 minutes.
She was impressed with what
she saw from Stanford's offense,
particularly the team's speed on the
field.
"It's a step up from what we've
seen basically all season," Hoon
said. "It was a challenge for us to
keep an eye on every player and
have everyone marked. I think we
did a pretty good job with that. We
stayed with them for the most part,

and that's what we worked for."
After halftime, it was evident
that Montana's players were
growing tired after having to
spend so much time defending
from one side of the field to the
other, as Stanford switched the
point of attack, repeatedly moving
down the Grizzlies' flanks and
avoiding the stacked defense in
the middle of the field.
Taylor was brought down in the
box in the 58th minute, and she con
verted the ensuing penalty kick
herself for a 2-0 lead.
Pac-12 Freshman of the Year
Chioma Übogagu completed the
scoring in the 72nd minute after a
nice run up the left side by Teresa
Noyola led to a cross from Payne
that Übogagu calmly slotted past
Floon.
Stanford has now won 47 con

secutive home matches 13
straight in the NCAA Tournament
and the shutout was the Cardinal's
14th of the season.
After losing the past two years
in the NCAA title match, Stanford
still has several tough games ahead
on its path back to the top. Next up
is a matchup with South Carolina
(16-6), which beat Texas in the sec
ond round on Friday night. The vic
tor will meet the winner of Friday
afternoon's matchup between Cal
and Boston College, also at Land
Q. Cagan Stadium.
The NCAA Women's College
Cup will kick off from Kennesaw,
Ga. on Friday, Dec. 2, with the
championship game to be played
on Sunday, Dec. 4.
