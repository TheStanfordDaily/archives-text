home matches of the season on Sunday against
Cal State Bakersfield and Menlo College, with

first Pac-12 dual of the season. The Stanford
wrestlers started off their home season strong,
beating Bakersfield 28-9 and demolishing
Menlo College 41-3.

redshirt senior
Nick Amuchastegui, ranked No. 1 in the coun
try at 174 pounds, dominated his opponent. The
Cardinal didn't look back as it won the rest of
the matches, all by major decision.
The match against Menlo College was even
more decisive. The Card recorded four pins and
lost just one match, which itself was decided on
a questionable no-call that would have sent
redshirt junior Matt Sencenbaugh's match into
overtime.
The team's two nationally ranked wrestlers
Amuchastegui and No. 6 Ryan Mango
continued their undefeated season and are now
5-0. Amuchastegui looked very solid, recording
two wins, one of which was a pin. In both match
es, he seemed to execute every move perfectly
both on his feet and on the mat.
Mango, a junior, looked equally prepared to
wrestle as he won both of his matches, one by
major decision and one by pin. Mango's quick
ness was simply too much for the Bakersfield
and Menlo wrestlers, neither of whom could
handle his deadly low single.
The other Cardinal wrestlers who went a
perfect 2-0 on Sunday were redshirt junior
