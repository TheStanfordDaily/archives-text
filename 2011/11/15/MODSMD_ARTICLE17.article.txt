## Card starts with easy home wins 
### PALANI ESWARAN 
The Stanford wrestling team had its first
home matches of the season on Sunday against
Cal State Bakersfield and Menlo College, with
the Bakersfield meet marking the Cardinal's
first Pac-12 dual of the season. The Stanford
wrestlers started off their home season strong,
beating Bakersfield 28-9 and demolishing
Menlo College 41-3.
The dual against Bakersfield started out ex-

matches. But

redshirt senior
Nick Amuchastegui, ranked No. 1 in the coun
try at 174 pounds, dominated his opponent. The
Cardinal didn't look back as it won the rest of
the matches, all by major decision.
The match against Menlo College was even
more decisive. The Card recorded four pins and
lost just one match, which itself was decided on
a questionable no-call that would have sent
redshirt junior Matt Sencenbaugh's match into
overtime.
The team's two nationally ranked wrestlers
Amuchastegui and No. 6 Ryan Mango
continued their undefeated season and are now
5-0. Amuchastegui looked very solid, recording
two wins, one of which was a pin. In both match
es, he seemed to execute every move perfectly
both on his feet and on the mat.
Mango, a junior, looked equally prepared to
wrestle as he won both of his matches, one by
major decision and one by pin. Mango's quick
ness was simply too much for the Bakersfield
and Menlo wrestlers, neither of whom could
handle his deadly low single.
The other Cardinal wrestlers who went a
perfect 2-0 on Sunday were redshirt junior
The team has definitely im
proved from its duals last weekend
against Northwestern, North Cen
tral College and Northern Illinois.
The Card went 2-1 on the road trip,
losing to a top-15 Northwestern
team. In that dual, the Cardinal
wrestlers were the ones being beat
en from neutral and dominated on
the mat. On Sunday, however, all
wrestlers wore their opponents
down by staying on top, accumulat
ing riding time and scoring near-fall
points.
But there is always room for im
provement.
"We've still got to get better at
putting a complete match togeth
er," Borrelli said. "But I think with
experience and conditioning, we'll
get to that point."
One thing not to overlook is that
the Cardinal is now 1-0 in the Pac
-12. Although many don't value the
regular season, conference wins
help seeding in the conference
tournament.
"You want to send the right mes
sage, because you're going to have
to wrestle those guys at the end of
the year to go to nationals," Borrel
li said.
On Sunday, the Cardinal will
travel to Chattanooga, Tenn., to
wrestle Central Michigan and
Chattanooga.

Timmy Boone at 149 pounds, soph
omore Garrett Schaner at 157
pounds, redshirt junior Spence
Patrick at 184 pounds, sophomore
Alan Yen at 197 pounds and sopho
more Dan Scherer at heavyweight.
After the match, head coach
Jason Borrelli was very pleased.
"We did a lot of things better
than we have the last couple of
duals," Borrelli said. "Hip defense
and defending shots looked better.
We did a good j ob of finishing when
we go to their legs. We were very
good from the top position as well."
The Cardinal wrestlers showed
their intelligence and mat-aware
ness during this weekend's duals.
On numerous occasions, Stanford
wrestlers were fighting for extra
points at the end of the match. One
match in particular, the contest be
tween Boone and Bakersfield's
Erik Martinez, exemplified the
team's ability to think on the mat.
With only a few seconds left in the
match, Boone was up by six and
could have stalled until the referee
raised his hand in victory. But
Boone fought for a last-second
takedown that put him up by eight,
which gained a major decision and
gave the team four crucial points.
