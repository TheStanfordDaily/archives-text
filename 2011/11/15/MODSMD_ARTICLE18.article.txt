# TOUGH SPLIT IN WASHINGTON
## CARD FALLS TO UW, BEATS WSU 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When the Stanford women's vol
leyball team last took on Washing
ton and Washington State, it easily
dismantled both opponents in
straight-set victories. The Cardinal
found Washington to be a different
team on the road, however, losing to
the Huskies 3-2. Stanford again had
little trouble with the Cougars, how
ever, defeating them 3-1.

Ultimately, the story of the
weekend was the rematch with No.
10 Washington (19-7, 11-7 Pac-12).
Entering the weekend, the No. 5
Cardinal (20-5, 14-5) stood two
games back of conference leaders
USC and UCLA and needed a
sweep of the Washington schools to
stay in the hunt for the Pac-12 title,
Washington was coming off
straight-set losses to both USC and
UCLA and was hoping to find re
demption by putting a dent in Stan
ford's conference-title hopes. Com
ing into the match, the Huskies held
an 11-1 home record and had defi
nitely played tougher volleyball in
Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
Right off the bat, the Huskies
looked like a different team than the
one Stanford swept in their last meet
ing. Washington took a 5-4 lead in the
first set and never looked back, ulti
mately taking a 25-18 victory.
The second set looked to be
more of the same, as Stanford fell
behind early and seemed to be
headed into a 2-0 hole. The Cardinal
soon roared back, however, tying
the set at 24-24 before taking its first
lead of the set, 26-25. Senior middle
blocker Stephanie Browne's kill
would cement the comeback and tie
the match up at one set apiece. Ju
nior setter Karissa Cook was large
ly responsible for the set victory,
recording assists on 15 of the 16
Cardinal kills. She would finish with
a career-high 54 assists and 16 digs
for her Pac-12-leading 15th double-

double.
Stanford's momentum contin
ued into the third set, as it led the
entire way for a 25-19 victory. The
Cardinal captured the set largely
due to its dominant defensive ef
fort, holding the Huskies to just a

.051 hitting percentage in the set.
Sophomore outside hitter Rachel
Williams had 10 digs in the set alone
and would ultimately tally 20 digs
and 20 kills for her 15th double
double, tying her with Cook for the
conference lead.

The Huskies were not going
down without a fight, however, and
rallied to capture the fourth set 25-
22, sending the Cardinal to its first
five-set match since September.
Washington roared to an early lead,
and Stanford was unable to make
up ground within the shorter fifth
set, falling 15-10 and losing the
match.
While it will go down in the
books as a loss, Stanford played
very well. The Cardinal had one of
its strongest defensive efforts of
the season, recording 87 digs and
11 blocks. Junior libero Hannah
Benjamin and sophomore defen
sive specialist Mary Ellen Luck
both recorded career-high dig to
tals, with 19 and 16 respectively.
The Cardinal held the Huskies to a
.193 hitting percentage, compared
to Stanford's .215. Freshman out
side hitter Morgan Boukather had
one of her best games for Stanford,
posting 11 kills on .455 hitting
while also recording seven blocks.
Incredibly, Stanford managed
to lead the Huskies in almost every
relevant statistical category except
the area that ultimately was the
team's downfall: serving. Stanford
had a service percentage of just
.854, compared to a .944 percent
age for Washington. The Cardinal
also had 15 service errors, while the
Huskies had only six.
Stanford's matchup with Wash
ington State (12-16, 4-14), howev
er, went much smoother, as the
Cardinal won 25-23, 25-11, 19-25,
25-15. Stanford, as usual, was led by
Williams and Cook, who cemented
their spots as the Pac-12 leaders in
double-doubles. Williams posted
16 kills and 13 digs, while Cook had
47 assists and 10 digs.
Stanford's victory can be credit
ed to its ferocious defense and effi
cient offense. Entering the match,
Washington State's senior outside
hitter Megan Ganzer led the Pac-12
in both points per set and kills per
set. While she did lead all players
with 18 kills for the match, the Stan
ford defense was able to hold her to
a .097 hitting percentage.
After completing its final road
trip of the season, Stanford heads
home next weekend to take on the
Oregon Ducks and Oregon State
Beavers.

double-doubles. Williams posted
16 kills and 13 digs, while Cook had
47 assists and 10 digs.
Stanford's victory can be credit
ed to its ferocious defense and effi
cient offense. Entering the match,
Washington State's senior outside
hitter Megan Ganzer led the Pac-12
in both points per set and kills per
set. While she did lead all players
with 18 kills for the match, the Stan
ford defense was able to hold her to
a .097 hitting percentage.
After completing its final road
trip of the season, Stanford heads
home next weekend to take on the
Oregon Ducks and Oregon State
Beavers.

STANFORD 3
WASHINGTON STATE 1
11/12, Pullman, Wash.


NICK SALAZAR/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore middle blocker Carly Wopat and the Stanford women's volleyball
team had a strong defensive effort against Washington, recording 87 digs and
11 blocks. It was not enough, however, as the Huskies came back to win in five
sets. The Cardinal bounced back with a four-set win over Washington State.
When the Stanford women's vol
leyball team last took on Washing
ton and Washington State, it easily
dismantled both opponents in
straight-set victories. The Cardinal
found Washington to be a different
team on the road, however, losing to
the Huskies 3-2. Stanford again had
little trouble with the Cougars, how
ever, defeating them 3-1.

Ultimately, the story of the
weekend was the rematch with No.
10 Washington (19-7, 11-7 Pac-12).
Entering the weekend, the No. 5
Cardinal (20-5, 14-5) stood two
games back of conference leaders
USC and UCLA and needed a
sweep of the Washington schools to
stay in the hunt for the Pac-12 title,
Washington was coming off
straight-set losses to both USC and
UCLA and was hoping to find re
demption by putting a dent in Stan
ford's conference-title hopes. Com
ing into the match, the Huskies held
an 11-1 home record and had defi
nitely played tougher volleyball in
Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
Right off the bat, the Huskies
looked like a different team than the
one Stanford swept in their last meet
ing. Washington took a 5-4 lead in the
first set and never looked back, ulti
mately taking a 25-18 victory.
The second set looked to be
more of the same, as Stanford fell
behind early and seemed to be
headed into a 2-0 hole. The Cardinal
soon roared back, however, tying
the set at 24-24 before taking its first
lead of the set, 26-25. Senior middle
blocker Stephanie Browne's kill
would cement the comeback and tie
the match up at one set apiece. Ju
nior setter Karissa Cook was large
ly responsible for the set victory,
recording assists on 15 of the 16
Cardinal kills. She would finish with
a career-high 54 assists and 16 digs
for her Pac-12-leading 15th double-

double.
Stanford's momentum contin
ued into the third set, as it led the
entire way for a 25-19 victory. The
Cardinal captured the set largely
due to its dominant defensive ef
fort, holding the Huskies to just a

.051 hitting percentage in the set.
Sophomore outside hitter Rachel
Williams had 10 digs in the set alone
and would ultimately tally 20 digs
and 20 kills for her 15th double
double, tying her with Cook for the
conference lead.

The Huskies were not going
down without a fight, however, and
rallied to capture the fourth set 25-
22, sending the Cardinal to its first
five-set match since September.
Washington roared to an early lead,
and Stanford was unable to make
up ground within the shorter fifth
set, falling 15-10 and losing the
match.
While it will go down in the
books as a loss, Stanford played
very well. The Cardinal had one of
its strongest defensive efforts of
the season, recording 87 digs and
11 blocks. Junior libero Hannah
Benjamin and sophomore defen
sive specialist Mary Ellen Luck
both recorded career-high dig to
tals, with 19 and 16 respectively.
The Cardinal held the Huskies to a
.193 hitting percentage, compared
to Stanford's .215. Freshman out
side hitter Morgan Boukather had
one of her best games for Stanford,
posting 11 kills on .455 hitting
while also recording seven blocks.
Incredibly, Stanford managed
to lead the Huskies in almost every
relevant statistical category except
the area that ultimately was the
team's downfall: serving. Stanford
had a service percentage of just
.854, compared to a .944 percent
age for Washington. The Cardinal
also had 15 service errors, while the
Huskies had only six.
Stanford's matchup with Wash
ington State (12-16, 4-14), howev
er, went much smoother, as the
Cardinal won 25-23, 25-11, 19-25,
25-15. Stanford, as usual, was led by
Williams and Cook, who cemented
their spots as the Pac-12 leaders in
double-doubles. Williams posted
16 kills and 13 digs, while Cook had
47 assists and 10 digs.
Stanford's victory can be credit
ed to its ferocious defense and effi
cient offense. Entering the match,
Washington State's senior outside
hitter Megan Ganzer led the Pac-12
in both points per set and kills per
set. While she did lead all players
with 18 kills for the match, the Stan
ford defense was able to hold her to
a .097 hitting percentage.
After completing its final road
trip of the season, Stanford heads
home next weekend to take on the
Oregon Ducks and Oregon State
