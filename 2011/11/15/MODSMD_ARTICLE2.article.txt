# STUDENT LIFE
## SULAIR looks to develop web portal Gradual change on tap for Univ.websites 
### ALLY ARRIETA 
University technology depart
ments are currently considering im
provements to core Stanford web
services, including Zimbra, Axess and
Coursework.

While peer schools have made the
switch, Stanford's Information Tech
nology Services seems unlikely to
adopt a new email provider service
and still uses Zimbra as opposed to a
Gmail platform. Stanford University
Libraries & Academic Information
Resources (SULAIR), on the other
hand, is working to develop a central
ized online portal for student needs,
which would include the needs cur
rently addressed through Axess and
Coursework.

Zimbra
Stanford's Zimbra email and cal
endar portal will update to the soft
ware's newest version, Zimbra 7, dur
ing winter quarter. The update will in
clude major calendar improvements.
Information Technology (IT) Ser
vices adopted Zimbra three years ago
and upgrades to the newest releases of
Zimbra 6 every other month. Accord
ing to Executive Director of Comput
ing Services Matthew Ricks, Zimbra
was chosen for its balance of features,
cost and the ability to support various
operating systems and mobile plat
forms. However, many students still
experience challenges with the prod
uct.

"Students indicate that the top
areas for continued investment and
enhancements include webmail fea
tures, ease of use and speed," wrote
Ricks in an email to The Daily.

"Our recent reviews of Zimbra in
dicate that website and email re
sponse during normal operations is
generally within tolerances," he
added. "Zimbra does slow down
somewhat when email backups are
being run, within a 1 a.m. through 5

a.m. backup window each night. This
is an issue that we've tried to minimize
by changing backup procedures and
timing."
To replace outdated email sys
tems, several universities have
switched to Gmail through Google
Apps for Education, a service provid
ed free to higher educational institu
tions. While Harvard made the switch
in August, Yale is currently transition
ing small groups of students at a time.
"We just started our migration in
late September, and so far the stu
dents seem enthusiastic about the
new service," wrote Jane Livingston,
director of IT strategy, governance
and policy at Yale, in an email to The
Daily. "Letting Google handle our
student email both provides the stu
dents with a more rich set of services
and importantly, it will free up Yale
staff time to work on more institution
ally-important initiatives that outside
vendors like Google can't deliver."
The switch at Harvard has re
ceived "overwhelmingly positive
feedback so far," wrote Susan Walsh,
executive director for technology in
frastructure at Harvard, in an email to
The Daily.
Several students at Stanford have
already chosen to redirect their
school email to Gmail
"I think Zimbra is way too slow,"
said Annabah Glasser 'l5. "I chose to
redirect my email to Gmail, and it
works like a charm."
Even when the University adopt
ed the well-received Zimbra system
in 2008, many students still chose to
redirect their email through Gmail.
Ricks said IT Services has been
evaluating the use of Google Apps for
Education for over a year.
"While many other colleges and
universities have implemented
Google Apps, including Gmail, there
are outstanding legal and compliance
issues which prevent widespread im

plementation at Stanford at this
time," he said. "One of the top issues is
the lack of compliance to accessibility
standards across the entire suite of
Google Apps. Google must address
this to ensure that their products are
usable by all, including those with dis
abilities."

Coursework
SULAIR, which handles the
Coursework website for managing
student-faculty interaction, is devel
oping a centralized online portal for
student interaction with the Universi
ty-
Coursework is based off the open
source software Sakai created by a
consortium of universities including
the University of Michigan, Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology, UC-
Berkeley and Stanford. The software
is free to universities.
"We receive feedback primarily
through user support and do an annu
al survey," said MakotoTsuchitani, as
sociate director in Faculty Computing
Services. "We do a ranking of desired
functionality, so we will know what to
address first. The student response
has generally been much better than
the faculty response."
Because of the consortium-based
development model, SULAIR is lim
ited in its ability to make major
changes to the program. However, it
has developed Coursework's testing
and quizzing modules, donating them
to Sakai for widespread use.
However, according to Associate
Director of SULAIR Enterprise Sys
tems of Programming Richard Web
ber, the department continues to re
ceive student complaints about pages'
loading times. According to Webber,
the delays stem from the fact that
many parties have collaborated in de
veloping Coursework's pages, creat
ing a complex system architecture.
Both Coursework and Axess have
had problems in the past with crashes
and slow page-loading speeds. Stu
dents and faculty have suggested an
aggregate view of all assignments and
improvements in file upload.
"There is lots of push in education

right now for the student portal, a
landing page which is a mash-up of
different parts of your life that are in
teresting and important to you," Web
ber said. "You can find your current
assignments, grades, what library
books you have overdue and other in
formation. We're going to work on
making this type of service available."

Response to criticism
A new enrollment system, called
Simple Enroll, was launched on Axess
on Aug. 1, in response to student criti
cism of the old system.
"We'd gotten a lot of input from
students on things they didn't like,"
said Director of Student Information
Systems Linda Regan, who worked
on Simple Enroll, in an October inter
view with The Daily. "They couldn't
see their schedules. It was difficult to
see when they had time conflicts and
they had a lot of issues with the previ
ous system, so we launched [Sim
pleEnroll] as an alternate."
Webber suggested that students
should not compare Stanford's web
sites to Internet staples such as
Google and Facebook, as the Univer
sity's resources are comparatively
limited.
"Things that work so well on the
web and set people's standards for
what they expect like Google are a
process of elimination from hundreds
if not thousands of competitors that
have tried to fill a void on the web," he
said. "When you look at higher educa
tion and the types of technologies we
use, the number of people working
and amount of money to be made is
negligible in comparison because you
are selling software to nonprofit or
ganizations."
However, he did suggest that Stan
ford's sites leave room for improve
ment.
"The environment isn't the same
and doesn't lead to the same out
comes, but that doesn't mean that we
can't learn from web development
that is out there," Webber said.
