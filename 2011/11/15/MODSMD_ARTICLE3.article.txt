# Campus ROTC unlikely
## Funds, low student interest are obstacles 
### ALICE PHILLIPS 
A Reserve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) unit on Stanford's campus is
unlikely in the near future, according
to University administrators.
The Faculty Senate voted 28 to 9
with three abstentions last spring to
extend an invitation to the military to
bring ROTC back onto campus. Flow
ever, it remains unlikely that any mili
tary branch will take the University up
on the offer. The lack of progress is pri
marily due to low levels of student in
terest and concerns about financial
sustainability, according to Senior As
sistant to the President Jeff Wachtel.
The University was free to pursue
discussions with the military about
ROTC returning to campus immedi
ately following the approval vote.
Flowever, the Faculty Senate has not
formed a subcommittee to advise
President John Flennessy on ROTC
issues, or to consider granting course
credit for ROTC classes, Wachtel said.
Obstacles to establishing an ROTC
unit

For the military to be able to justi
fy the cost of establishing a full-blown

unit, approximately 15 to 20 students
would need to graduate per year from
any participating branches of the mil
itary, according to Scott Calvert, Di
rector of Finance & Administration in
the Office of the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education.
Once attrition is accounted for, as
many as 100 students would need to
participate in whichever ROTC unit
was stationed on campus.
"That's a very large number,"
Wachtel said. "Once we learned that,
we realized that there has to be anoth
er approach to putting a program to
gether."
That alternative will likely take the
form of further collaboration with
nearby universities that already have
ROTC units, such as San Jose State
University, Santa Clara University
and UC-Berkeley, with whom Stan
ford currently has cross-town agree
ments to allow for Stanford student
participation. This alternative could
include anything from allowing other
ROTC units to hold events on campus
to hosting ROTC courses taught by
Stanford faculty for ROTC students
from Stanford and the partner univer
sities.
Calvert added that such collabora
tion would compensate for the fact
that a relatively large number of stu
dents, when compared to the handful
of Stanford ROTC participants, is

needed to facilitate many of ROTC's
leadership training objectives.
"The federal government is going
through belt-tightening on their budg
ets, and the military is not exempt
from that," Wachtel said. "They're
concerned about the cost of any pro
gram they put in place, but they're still
enthusiastic about doing something at
Stanford."
The Naval ROTC proposal
Calvert sent Stanford's proposal
for a Naval ROTC unit to the military
more than one month ago, but he ex
pressed doubt that the Navy will es
tablish a unit on campus.
"I think we presented a good and
viable case, and in different economic
times it might look more attractive,"
he said. "We have not heard back, but
we're not putting all of our eggs in that
basket."
Calvert said Stanford focused its
efforts on the Navy because both the
Army and Air Force already have a
presence on the peninsula at Santa
Clara University and San Jose State,
respectively. The number of Stanford
ROTC participants in the Naval pro
gram was also highest at the time
Calvert wrote the proposal, and those
students must travel the farthest of
ROTC participants, to UC-Berkeley.
"It doesn't make sense for the
Army to put two units 10, 12 miles

apart from each other," Calvert said.

Course credit for ROTC

According to Calvert, it is unlikely
that any course credit will be awarded
for ROTC classes before the fall of
2012.
"We're not close to actually having
details of the program," Wachtel said.
"We're not really at the point of hav
ing a program for the faculty commit
tee to approve."
Both the Army and the Navy ex
pressed interest in having their curric
ula approved for course credit. Wach
tel said he plans to forward the curric
ula to the yet-to-be-formed Faculty
Senate subcommittee to determine if
the classes merit Stanford credit.
"You can get activity credit for a lot
of things at Stanford," Calvert said.
"You can get it for yoga. And that has
a place in our education, physical fit
ness and well-being. But it's hard to
imagine that some of the activities and
coursework that they do in ROTC
