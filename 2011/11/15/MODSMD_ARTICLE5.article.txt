# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Intersections Week kicks off with trans actress Q&A 
### LUCY MUSSON 
Transgender actress Aneesh Sheth,
the first South Asian trans woman to
appear on television, spoke to stu
dents Monday evening at one of the
first events of "Intersections," a week
long series organized by Stanford Stu
dents for Queer Liberation (SSQL).
Sheth spoke about her role on the
show "Outsourced," in addition to
sharing her personal story of transi
tioning and finding success as an ac
tress.
Intersections Week aims to explore
the relationship, or intersection, be
tween LGBTQ and racial identities.
Sheth's evening talk kicked off the
week, following a lunchtime screening
of "Should Be, Could Be, But Is" with
director Nayoung Woo.
Sheth discussed not only the inter
sections of her transgender and Indian
identities, but also the intersections of
her identities as a social activist and ac
tress and challenges she faces in the
entertainment industry.
Sheth began her talk with her per

sonal story, describing how she grew
up in New York with negative stereo
types and limited knowledge of trans
gendered individuals.
"When I was 12, all I wanted to do
was dress up in saris when no one was
home," Sheth said, describing her
childhood. "At that time I had no idea
that I would ever become a woman."
Sheth came out at the age of 16 as a
gay man, but it wasn't until 10 years
later that she chose to transition. She
cited a pivotal stage role as "Sweetie,"
a eunuch in "Bombay Dreams," as in
spiring her self-realization.
"I still had the dream that one day
I would be on stage singing in a sari,"
Sheth said of her role in "Bombay
Dreams."
"I did what I wanted to do all my
life," she added.
Upon transitioning, Sheth was un
sure about her potential for success as
an actress and pursued a degree in so
cial work from New York University
(NYU). In 2010, she moved to Califor
nia to perform social work and con
tinues to remain involved in the field.
Sheth found her way back to acting
when offered a role on "Out
sourced."
"I didn't ever think I could work
as a trans actress," she said, noting
that she "felt really, really blessed" to
be a part of "Outsourced," a sitcom
about an American company's call
center in Mumbai, India. Sheth said
her character would have continued
to the second season, if not for the
show's cancellation earlier this year.
Sheth did, however, mention neg
ative feedback she received for her
role on "Outsourced." She noted that
while some took issue with her role as
a stripper, arguing that the character
served to reinforce negative stereo
types, her response was, "We all have
to start somehow."
Sheth also discussed industry dis
crimination she faced before and
after her transition.
"My agent said, 'Cut your hair,
work out, make yourself look more
masculine,'" she said, describing how
attempts to follow the advice left her
feeling as if she had betrayed a part of
herself.
Sheth also mentioned that while
she felt pressure to choose whether
or not to bill herself at auditions as
transgender, agents told her the issue
didn't matter, commenting, "You
'pass' as a woman."
Now Sheth is proud to represent
her true self.
"You're respecting yourself by
saying I'm who I am and I'm not
going to sacrifice this," she said.
Prompted by the audience, Sheth
also spoke about her relationship

with her family.
"There's still something to learn
within every story," she said when de
scribing ongoing tension. "My dad is
definitely more accepting than my
mother. She never fully grieved the
loss of a son."
Sheth also spoke about the impor
tance of her recent connection to a
South Asian transgender community,
referring to the positive support from
a "community of people who not only
understand my gender identity, but
also my culture."
"I'm only really starting to discov
er that part of myself" Sheth said.
Sheth described divisions within
the LGBTQ community and com
mented on efforts at universities to
support students from all groups.
"A lot of colleges are doing these
co-ed dormitories," she said, referring
to Stanford's policy offering co-ed liv
ing in specific dorms. "I think it's

good, but probably there are some
kinks that need to be worked out."
"Allies are a huge part of the sup
port system," Sheth said, a sentiment
shared by the student organizers of
the event.
"Intersections for me is exciting
because it allows us to explore many
identities that people feel are at odds
with each other," said SSQL co-pres
ident Leanna Keyes 'l4.
Intersections Week will include
several speakers and film screenings
and will culminate in an open mic Fri
day evening at the CoHo.
"It's much more than, 'What is it
like to be this?"' said event organizer
Mia Divecha 'l3, stressing the theme
of intersections of various identities.
"What is it like to be both these
things?"
