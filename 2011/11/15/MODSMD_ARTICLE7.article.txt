## Scholars consider binationalism Israel, Palestine panel inspires lively debate 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
A panel on binationalism in Israel
and Palestine prompted lively discus
sion Monday evening and ultimately
ended on a hopeful note. The panel, ti
tled "Theory. Art and Action: Jewish
and Palestinian voices toward bina
tionalism," featured American-Israeli
artist Udi Aloni, English professor
Hilton Obenzinger Ph.D. '97 and
Center on Democracy, Development
and the Rule of Law (CDDRL) visit
ing scholar Miriam Abu Sharkh.
The discussion was moderated by
Omar Shakir 'O7, J.D. 'l3, co-president
of Students for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER).
Shakir stressed the relevance of
the panel to recent developments in
the region, including the Arab Spring
and Palestine's bid to be admitted as a
member state to the United Nations.
"Especially now with the increas
ing breakdown of the peace process..
. There's been a lot of dialogue... but
what's really missing is, 'What is the
role of nationalism?"' Shakir said.
"What are the Jewish and the Pales
tinian national perspectives that go
into informing a binational state?"
Aloni kicked off the panel, voicing
his reasons for exploring questions of
Jewish identity in his most recent
book, "What Does a Jew Want?: On
Binationalism and Other Specters,"
published in September of this year.
Aloni emphasized the inseparabil
ity of theory, art and action in advocat
ing for change. He moved from the
discussion of the framework of
change to specifically address the
question of a binational state in the
"place called" Israel and the "place
called" Palestine.
"The issue is that language is very
tricky," he said. "Each one of us cre
ates this politically correct stuff. Two
state solution has become the lan
guage of how you keep apartheid for
ever ... The apartheid is that the
Palestinian cannot be a Palestinian in
Israel."
"I want to learn how to become a
Palestinian Jew... to learn the possi
bility of how to be a brother, not to be
an other," he added, deeming the use
of the word "other" as language of
separation.
Binationalism, he held, will come
only with this understanding.
"Only when the Palestinian is
ready to say,'l'm home, I'm ready'
to say 'l'm home in this land,'" he said.
"Until then, I am in exile,"
Abu Sharkh followed Aloni's talk
and presented a personal story of
Gaza, referencing her experience
growing up there as the daughter of a
Palestinian refugee. Her father was
trapped in Gaza as a result of the 2006
blockade.
"The issue is Palestinians not
being at home in their own home,"
Abu Sharkh said. "Gaza is a strange
strip in the modern world. Not part of
any nation. Not occupied, yet not
free."
Obenzinger spoke last, mention
ing a campaign in the West Bank
modeled after the American civil
rights movement's Freedom Riders.
"I began to understand the con
nection between the experience in the
U.S. as a settler society and then as a
segregated society, and that that there

were parallels in terms of Israel's de
velopment," Obenzinger said.
Obenzinger also criticized the
limited scope of debate on Israeli
policies.
"If you're Jewish,you'll be accused
of being a self-hating Jew," he said. "If
you're not Jewish, you're anti-Semitic.
We've got to get way past that and
start talking about what's going on."

"I don't feel very doctrinaire about
how this is going to turn out. What I do
feel strongly about is that people have
a right to live and a right to be who
they are," he added.
Members of the audience posed
questions to the panel on issues rang
ing from how a binational solution
might be more effective than a two
state approach to the preservation of
a Jewish state, the idealism of a bina
tional approach and avenues of ac
tion. Attendees broke up into smaller
discussions, raising issues such as
practicality of the binational solution,
the language of critique and historical
causality.
Many said they appreciated the
opportunity to consider a novel ap
proach to the situation.
"You don't often hear the bina
tional perspective, since it has been
historically marginalized since 1948,"
said Rachel Antonsen 'l2. "I thought
it was cool that it was being examined
through art."
The panel was co-sponsored by
the Center for Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity, the Depart
ment of Comparative literature, the
Program in Modern Thought and Lit
erature and the Department of Histo
ry and the Division of International
Comparative and Area Studies.
