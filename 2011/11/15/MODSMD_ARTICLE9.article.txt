## I'M DONE WITH MY LIFE What matters most 
### Camira Powell 
Stanford football games are always
pretty exciting on campus, especial
ly when playing a huge rival like
Oregon. But this game was special; it
was College Game Day on ESPN. I had
no idea what that meant; I'm still not
quite sure what it is, but I know it's im
portant and impressive. For days lead
ing up to the game, my Stanford web
mail inbox got blasted with requests for
extra tickets someone even likening
their Oregon game ticket to receiving
cake on their birthday. Emails an
nounced rollouts commencing at 5 a.m.
and the subsequent rally on The Oval.
Even though I miss some of the fanfare
that surrounds a Stanford football
game, I was quite thankful I was 3,000
miles away, which seemed to be the only
way to avoid being dragged along to the
early-moming celebration.
When other Floward students talk
about their football team (it's all about
the halftime show out here and to be
real, it's usually worth waiting for), I
don't hesitate to tell them what it's like
to have a bowl-winning team. I keep
tabs on our team, even purposefully
going to ESPN.com so I know what's
going on (that's a lot for a girl who does

n't even know what channel that is on
her free cable). So in the spirit of the big
match, I purposefully read an ESPN ar
ticle that talked about our unique foot
ball program. The author found one of
its most unique components to be the
fact that players are treated not like
gods, but like the students they are. Of
course, student athletes get some privi
leges that not all students get, but it's no
different from any other privileges that
come with being associated with certain
groups or organizations (am I really the
only one who wonders why Senators
have access to Old Union at all kinds of
crazy hours when I'm stuck going to
creepy Meyer if I want a place to
study?). Nonetheless, the thing that got
me about the article was a quote from
head football coach, David Shaw. An
amazing guy in his own right, he gave his
own explanation for Stanford's football

culture. He summed it up perfectly say
ing, "Stanford is full of people who love
to see greatness... It's a place of many
excellences."
It's an interesting thought espe
cially considering it comes from the
football coach —and I would have to
agree. While there are so many people
doing amazing things all over our cam
pus, there is more than one thing that we
should focus on. Stanford just likes to

win. We want to be best in everything.
After our little shakedown with Ore
gon, some worried that students are sim
ply fair-weather fans, but Cardinal pride
runs deep, and it doesn't go down easy.
Instead of finding cries of "What hap
pened?" I found optimism and support
for the Cardinal, and even joy, as stu
dents found solace in the Maroon 5 con
cert scheduled for that same night.
Things have been worse before, and one

day, it may be worse again. But right
now, there's something magical about
the spirit and energy of students coming
together in support of their fellow class
mates who play their hearts out every
weekend in front of packed stadiums.
The day after Saturday's tragedy, I
had expected to see my Facebook time
line filled with lamentations over our
heartbreaking loss to Oregon. Instead I
found a mix of optimism and support
for our beloved team, with students past
and present praising them for what they
have been able to accomplish so far.
And now, days later, students have fin
ished licking their wounds (with the in
credible concert expediting the healing
process) and turned their attention to
the game that matters most: Big Game.
The people we love to hate most are
coming to campus, and I couldn't be
more stoked. I feel like I'm more excit
ed now than when I was actually on
campus
One of the best Facebook statuses I
saw all day went like this: "End of the
Night Rankings: Stanford: #5. Universi
ty of Oregon: #lOl. Oops, I was looking
at US News College Rankings: the ones
that matter more..."
After I finished ROFLing, I had to
agree.There's more to life than football,
there's more to life than rankings and
there's more to life than one loss No
matter what the score is at the end of the
game, we 're still fwinning because Stan
ford's got SWAG (Students Working
After Graduation).

Camira would really appreciate
someone finally explaining to her what
College Game Day is. Email heratcami
