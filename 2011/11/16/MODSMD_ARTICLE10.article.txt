Evaluation results posted on the

wonderful award," Winkleby said
in an article on the School of Medi

organizations, recognizing mentors
"who help prepare the next gener
ation of scientists and engineers
while ensuring that tomorrow's in
novators reflect and benefit from
the diverse talent of the United
States," according to the press re

Colleagues, administrations or
students nominated all of the can
didates. Recipients will receive a
$25,000 award from the National

"Our nation owes them a debt of
gratitude for helping ensure that
America remains the global leader
in science and engineering for years
to come."
