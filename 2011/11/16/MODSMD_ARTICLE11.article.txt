## NARRATIVE Game Day Out in full force 
### PEPITO ESCARCE 
Somehow I convinced myself to roll out
two hours before the rest of the cam
pus. It was 3:30 a.m. on Saturday, and
for the first time in its 18 years broad
casting live from college campuses,
ESPN College Game Day was hosting its na
tional pre-game show at Stanford.
Mitch Sherman, an ESPN blogger, feared a
mediocre turnout.
"There's talk that the crowd Saturday for
ESPN's College Game Day may actually set a
record low for attendance, what with the early
morning start and apathetic nature toward
football of the Stanford students," he wrote in a
Nov. 10 blog post.
Maybe it was because Stanford students
don't necessarily live and die with the football
team's successes and failures. Maybe it was be

cause Stanford has such a small student fan
base. Or maybe it was because Game Day starts
at 6 a.m. on the West Coast.
But despite the media's doubts, I walked
over to the Oval with a few dorm mates eager
to grab a spot in the front row, only to run into
a long line of people with the same idea.
There was still hours to go before dawn, so
the stage lights were on at full force. As we wait
ed for the gates to open, I looked around at the
signs students held.
Some were random.
"SMU beat Navy."
"I Hate Le√üron."
A cutout of a random man's face blown up
to 10 times life-size.
Some were original:
"Tim Tebow - God + Talent = Andrew
Luck."
"LaMichael James Can't Smoke This Tree."
Before I knew what was happening, my group
started entering a section closed off from the rest

of the crowd near the stage. Chris Fowler,
Desmond Howard and Kirk Herbstreit came
and went from the stage. Erin Andrews stood on
a stage to the side while the live ESPN telecast
was broadcast on a JumboTron behind her.
Students were densely packed near the
stage. Cameras ran on wires overhead, filming
the crowd. Stanford males yelled out catcalls to
Andrews. Between all the signs, the students
hoisted on each other's shoulders and the sheer
enormity of the crowd, I felt much farther from
the stage than I actually was.
Mitch Sherman could not have been more
wrong.
"At 5:30,1 was at the front of the pit, and a
guy from ESPN turned around and told me,
'You guys have already exceeded our atten
dance expectations,'" said Julie Lythcott-
Haims 'B9, dean of freshmen and undergradu
ate advising. "About half of the crowd had yet
to come."
Lisa Lapin, assistant vice president of uni

versity communications, echoed these senti
ments.
"ESPN loved being at Stanford," Lapin
said. "They were incredibly impressed with the
turnout and the behavior of everybody in the
crowd."
After Fowler's brief admonition to the stu
dent crowd not to yell obscenities, the Hoover
Tower's appearance on the JumboTron sig
naled the beginning of the telecast. The crowd
roared.
The majority of the crowd was made up of
students, but there were also Oregon students,
fans and families from the Bay Area.
The "truly incomparable" Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band stood in jux
taposition to its uniformed and precise Oregon
counterpart. Both bands started to play at
around 6:30 a.m., shortly after the sun finally
came up.
