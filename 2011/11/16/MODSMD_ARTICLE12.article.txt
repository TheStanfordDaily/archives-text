## JOBBERISH Flavor of the week 
### Amanda Ach 
As you've no doubt gathered
from the fact that I mention
food in almost every column
I write, I love food. It's one of my fa
vorite things. I love to bake and
cook, but more than anything, I re
ally love to eat. I think having a ca
reer in food would be just about the
most fun thing a person could do
with his or her life whether as a
chef, baker, restaurant manager
the list goes on. But all of these are
so obvious, and they don't make use
of your hard-earned Stanford de
gree, which (as much as we all hate
to admit it) matters. While it's only
natural to get hung up on that de
tail, I'm going to be holier-than
thou for a minute and advise you
against it. Your life's passion might
be something that requires a college
education, but it might not. You
should pursue it regardless —as
long as it makes you happy and pays
the bills, it's worth your time. If my
hypocritical lecture didn't work and
you still want to do something with
food that also validates all your
hard work here at Stanford, I've got
an idea: become a flavor chemist,
also known as a flavorist. It's the
perfect job for those of you who are
both foodies and chemists, and it's
this week's topic.

A flavorist creates the artificial
flavoring found in basically any
packaged food you can buy. It's not
just a bunch of lotions and potions
flavorists use highly technical
chemical processes to create these
artificial flavors, with the same stan
dards of precision as any research
lab in the country. As a flavorist, you
will get to apply your many hours of
work on those chem p-sets to creat
ing delicious new flavors that peo
ple like me will eat and enjoy.
While the flavor industry is actu
ally quite large, there are only about
1,000 flavorists worldwide. These
flavorists are therefore highly val
ued and by highly valued, I mean
a six-figure annual income. Most of
the world's flavor companies are
American, so as a flavorist, several
of your clients will likely be interna
tional. Of course, this means that in
order to understand the local flavor
profiles, you will have to do a lot of
traveling and sampling of different
exotic cuisines. Poor you.
There is, however, one part of be
coming a flavorist that I don't envy
beyond getting a degree in
chemistry, hopeful flavorists must
also complete a seven-year training
program to become fully certified.
You can start the training program
right after getting your Bachelor's
degree, and it's basically just work
ing in a laboratory to gain experi
ence kind of like a very long in
ternship.

But being a flavorist isn't all bor
ing lab work in a white coat; there is
a certain amount of creativity in
volved in the job as well. While you

will sometimes be creating standard
flavors, you will also get to be inven
tive with your flavor creation. For
example, one flavorist was tasked
with creating the flavor "erotic" for
a Japanese candy company. Anoth
er flavor: "virgin." I'm serious. As a
flavorist, you will be turning ab
stract (if somewhat perverted)
ideas into accessible tastes, and
even though it's hard work, it can
also be a lot of fun.

Although flavorists primarily
create flavors for food products,
they aren't limited to just the food
industry. Cosmetic companies will
hire flavorists to make their prod
ucts smell (or, in some cases, taste)
good. Flavorists are also often hired
by pharmaceutical companies to
make medications taste better, al
though from personal experience, I
can say those flavorists aren't doing
such a great job. That is, except for
Children's Tylenol purple never
tasted so good.

Becoming a flavorist is a fun way
to combine your interests in food
and chemistry into a successful ca
reer. Also, given the highly technical
nature of the job, a career as a fla
vorist will no doubt put that Stan
ford diploma to good use. Lastly, as
a frequent consumer of food, I will
greatly appreciate the work that
you do. And really, that's the most
important thing.

tasted so good.

Becoming a flavorist is a fun way
to combine your interests in food
and chemistry into a successful ca
reer. Also, given the highly technical
nature of the job, a career as a fla
vorist will no doubt put that Stan
ford diploma to good use. Lastly, as
a frequent consumer of food, I will
greatly appreciate the work that
you do. And really, that's the most
important thing.
