# ON THE MARGINS, BETWEEN THE LINES
## Joking about rape 
### Jamie Solomon 
Most people at Stanford
would agree that that the
issues of rape and sexual
assault are serious matters. Howev
er, that doesn't mean they are above
becoming punch lines for jokes on
campus. Similarly, jokes involving
the Holocaust, dead babies and
Helen Keller are made all the time.
They are funny precisely because
they are matters that should not be

joked about.
But people making jokes about
rape bother me in away that jokes
about other taboo topics rarely do.
This is because rape is a problem
that our community on campus
faces every day. Jokes about rape
also become more personal they
are often about a certain person
getting assaulted, or position the
people making the jokes as rapists.
Additionally, although not always a
joke, the word "rape" has become a
general colloquialism used to de
scribe all manner of situations that
have nothing to do with sex. So al
though I know that just using the
word rape casually does not mean
that someone condones it, and I do
find humor in joking about things I
would never actually do, using this
kind of language in a college envi
ronment like Stanford is dangerous.
I mean that in a literal sense. One in
four women will get raped or as
saulted during her time in college,
often by men. (Men are sexually as
saulted as well, but in much lower
proportions.) This means that you
undoubtedly know someone who
has been or will be raped while at
Stanford. Because it's not some
thing that's talked about often, it
can be impossible to know which of
your friends has been personally af
fected by this. Hearing a joke about
rape may be incredibly painful or
triggering to them, even if you can't
see it and they are laughing along
with everyone else. By making
jokes and using language that turns
rape into a lighthearted or funny
subject, a climate is created that
downplays the seriousness of rape
and makes it harder for victims to
speak out about their experiences
or to get help. Having a space where
there can be open discourse about
rape is important for working to
wards eliminating rape on campus;
making light of it inhibits open dia
logue and prevents people from
feeling safe enough to engage in
these conversations.

It is consistently shown that men
who are rapists believe that most
other men also rape, but they just
hide it better. One in 20 college
aged men will admit to having
raped someone on anonymous sur
veys. So it is likely that in addition to
knowing someone who has been
deeply affected by a rape, you prob
ably know people who are raping
others. If you are making jokes in

volving rape and casually using the
word to describe that test you just
failed, rapists hear this as validation
that they are not alone. By normal
izing the word, it suggests to them
that raping others is a common ex
perience and that their behavior is
acceptable.

A striking example of this is a
video that resulted from an improv
show in New York City. An audi
ence member stands up to recount a
humorous story from his life to in
spire an improv scene. Unfortu
nately the story he tells is one in
which he enters the room of a drunk
woman against her will and has sex
with her even though she repeated
ly tells him to leave. The shocking
thing about this video is not that he
is admitting to raping someone
(without using that terminology
and understanding of his actions),
but that he is telling this as a humor
ous anecdote, one that he has told
many times before. To him and his
friends, this is a funny story about
him getting laid against all odds. To
this man, coercing someone into sex
becomes a punch line and it is clear,
through watching his reactions dur
ing the video, that he hears the
laughter of others as validation of
his actions. The fact that he has
grown up in an environment where
people around him make jokes
about rape, even if they would
never rape anyone, has contributed
to him seeing his actions as fully ac
ceptable and not morally question
able and allowed him to stand up in
front of a room of hundreds of
strangers and tell this story without
a second thought.

Chances are, you know someone
like him who has coerced someone
into having sex. In fact, the person
that you know is probably more so
cially aware than the audience
member is and not stupid enough to
tell a whole room about his con
quests. So don't contribute to him
normalizing rape. And don't con
tribute to furthering the trauma of
rape victims. Even though they're
oh-so-tempting and can be funny, if
you don't condone rape, don't con
done people making jokes about it.
