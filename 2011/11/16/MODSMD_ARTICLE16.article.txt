## Verlander for MVP? Child,please 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
There comes a time in a
man's life when he must
stand up for what he be
lieves. After hearing yet an
other wave of talk about
how Justin Verlander ought to win the
American League MVP award, today
is that day. I say no.
Sorry Justin, but while I believe
you and all of your supporters could
make a great argument for why you
are one of the most valuable players
on your team and in the league, it is
not possible to compare the impact a
position player has on the team to the
impact a pitcher has. And most impor
tantly, pitchers have their own damn
award the Cy Young which Ver
lander won unanimously on Tuesday.
Now, you could say I am slightly bi
ased Jacoby Ellsbury is indeed my
homeboy but just hear me out.
The last time a pitcher won the
MVP was in 1992, when Hall of Fame
reliever Dennis Eckersley saved 51
games with a 1.91 ERA for the Oak
land Athletics. The last time a starting
pitcher won the award was when
Roger Clemens went 24-4 with 238
strikeouts and a 2.48 ERA in 1986.

So there is some historical prece
dent for the Baseball Writers' Associ
ation of America to give the men on
the mound some love. But I'm going
to be honest those days are over,
and I have to believe it's because they
eventually came to their senses and
realized that as great a season as a
pitcher has. the times they are a
changin'.

And this is not to knock Verlan
der's contribution to the team, be
cause he certainly was a valuable asset
for Jim Leyland's ballclub.
Not only did the flame-throwing
right-hander lead the league in wins,
but he was also first in winning per
centage (.828), ERA (2.40), innings
(251), strikeouts (250) and WHIP
(0.920).
Those are Clemens-esque num
bers, and behind Verlander, the Tigers
won 95 games and the AL Central di
vision title for the first time in 24 years.
But I will not stand idly by while
Verlander, a great and humble guy by
most accounts, butters the media up
with his "aw, shucks" charm.
Hall of Fame hitters already fail
two-thirds of the time. They have to go
out and play nine innings of defense,
162 games a year. Sure, they get to
take plays off, while pitchers are sub
jected to scrutiny on every pitch for six
innings. But to make position players
have to compete with a guy who has a
direct impact on the game just once
every five days is simply unfair.

You cannot tell me that Justin Ver
lander deserves the MVP more than
even his own teammate, Miguel Cabr
era, who hit .344 with 30 home runs
and 105 RBI while playing an under
rated first base for the Tigers. The dif
ference between Verlander and a
pretty good starting pitcher, as com
pared to the difference between
Miguel Cabrera and a pretty good
first baseman is not comparable.
One of the biggest arguments I

have heard for Verlander is that this
year was "special" for him. But while I
agree with that description, that does
n't make him an MVP, that makes him
the Cy Young. Pedro Martinez had
perhaps the greatest single season
ever by a starting pitcher in 1999
going 23-4 with a 2.07 ERA with an
unreal 313 strikeouts and 0.92 WHIP.
That's stupid good.
And yet, he fell 13 points shy of
Ivan Rodriguez in the MVP race. (To
be honest, Manny Ramirez should
have won that MVP because his 44
HRs, .333 BA and 165 RBI was really
stupid good.) Which is why I feel safe
saying that the history of the award
tells us that pitchers should stick to the
thing they do best pitching.
They have a wonderful award for
this very reason, and Verlander won it
in a landslide rather deservedly this
year.
"Coming from your peers makes it
all the more special," Verlander said
of that honor. "I think with all the talk

about, 'Should a pitcher be able to win
MVP or a top player award?' I think it
shows a lot of support for my fellow
players to be able to vote me for that.
I think it means a lot. When it comes
from your peers, the guys you're play
ing with, the guys you're playing
against it's special."
But "those guys" deserve to have
their day, because this was no down
year for several hitters. All Ellsbury
did was put together a breakthrough
season that was as impressive as that
of any position player in the game.
Boston's leadoff man hit .321 with
212 hits, 32 homers, 105 RBIs and a
league-leading 364 total bases. He
also stole 39 bases all while playing
Gold Glove defense in centerfield.
Though the Red Sox had a histori
cally poor finish, becoming the first
team to blow a nine-game lead in Sep
tember, Ellsbury was the reason his
team still had a chance to make it to
the postseason in Game No. 162. He
hit .358 with eight homers and 21
RBIs during a time his team needed
him most.
That is what an MVP should do,
not just be the "stopper" every five
days you get the ball. The Tigers also
had Doug Fister, who was actually

more impressive than Verlander
down the stretch with a 1.79 ERA,
0.84 WHIP and an 8-1 record after
coming over via a trade with the
Mariners.
If you don't like Ellsbury, why
don't you try a helping of the Grandy
Man, or take a look at Mr. Bautista in
Toronto, or A-Gon in Beantown?
Any of them has had a great enough
season to overcome doubts.
I'm ready for the angry hordes
who say that the award shouldn't be
exclusive to position players and that
the words "most and valuable" apply
to Verlander like "Tim Tebow and
winner."
But I sincerely hope that Mr. Ver
lander can sit back and applaud for
whomever it is that does win when the
award is announced on Monday, just
like he did for the 129 games in which
he did not throw a pitch this season.

Miles also believes that defensive
players should not be able to win the
Heisman, but that's just because he's
still bitter about Charles Woodson
beating out Peyton Manning. Send
