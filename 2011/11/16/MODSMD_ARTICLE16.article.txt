## Verlander for MVP? Child,please 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
There comes a time in a
man's life when he must
stand up for what he be
lieves. After hearing yet an
other wave of talk about
how Justin Verlander ought to win the
American League MVP award, today
is that day. I say no.
Sorry Justin, but while I believe
you and all of your supporters could
make a great argument for why you
are one of the most valuable players
on your team and in the league, it is
not possible to compare the impact a
position player has on the team to the
impact a pitcher has. And most impor
tantly, pitchers have their own damn
award the Cy Young which Ver
lander won unanimously on Tuesday.
Now, you could say I am slightly bi
ased Jacoby Ellsbury is indeed my
homeboy but just hear me out.
The last time a pitcher won the
MVP was in 1992, when Hall of Fame
reliever Dennis Eckersley saved 51
games with a 1.91 ERA for the Oak
land Athletics. The last time a starting
pitcher won the award was when
Roger Clemens went 24-4 with 238
strikeouts and a 2.48 ERA in 1986.

So there is some historical prece
dent for the Baseball Writers' Associ
ation of America to give the men on
the mound some love. But I'm going
to be honest those days are over,
and I have to believe it's because they
eventually came to their senses and
realized that as great a season as a
pitcher has. the times they are a
changin'.

And this is not to knock Verlan
der's contribution to the team, be
cause he certainly was a valuable asset
for Jim Leyland's ballclub.
Not only did the flame-throwing
right-hander lead the league in wins,
but he was also first in winning per
centage (.828), ERA (2.40), innings
(251), strikeouts (250) and WHIP
(0.920).
Those are Clemens-esque num
bers, and behind Verlander, the Tigers
won 95 games and the AL Central di
vision title for the first time in 24 years.
But I will not stand idly by while
Verlander, a great and humble guy by
most accounts, butters the media up
with his "aw, shucks" charm.
Hall of Fame hitters already fail
two-thirds of the time. They have to go
out and play nine innings of defense,
162 games a year. Sure, they get to
take plays off, while pitchers are sub
jected to scrutiny on every pitch for six
innings. But to make position players
have to compete with a guy who has a
direct impact on the game just once
every five days is simply unfair.

You cannot tell me that Justin Ver
lander deserves the MVP more than
even his own teammate, Miguel Cabr
era, who hit .344 with 30 home runs
and 105 RBI while playing an under
rated first base for the Tigers. The dif
ference between Verlander and a
pretty good starting pitcher, as com
pared to the difference between
Miguel Cabrera and a pretty good
first baseman is not comparable.
One of the biggest arguments I
