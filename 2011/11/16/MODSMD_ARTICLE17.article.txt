# NEW YORK BOUND

### ZACH ZIMMERMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Junior guard Gabe Harris col
lected the loose ball, took two drib
bles and launched a 65-foot shot
that hit nothing but net as time ex

pired in the first half. The perfect
miracle heave was exactly what an
ice-cold Stanford squad needed to
right the ship.
The Cardinal (3-0) advanced to
the semifinals of the NIT Season
Tip-Off on Tuesday night, beating

Colorado State 64-52 in Maples
Pavilion. Redshirt senior forward
Josh Owens led the way for Stan
ford with 15 points, with Harris and
sophomore guard Aaron Bright
contributing 12 apiece in what was
a classic tale of two halves.

The first period of play was not
so kind to Stanford's shooting, with
the Cardinal firing 12 fewer shots
than the Rams and connecting on
just 42 percent of those looks. Free
throw shooting once again kept the
game tight, with Stanford going 8-
for-12 and CSU splitting its only
two attempts.

Colorado State streaked out to
an eight-point lead early, with red
shirt junior guard Wes Eikmeier
and junior forward Pierce Hor
nung hitting back-to-back three
pointers to extend the score to 12-
4. Stanford couldn't answer, start
ing 3-for-13 from the field before
sophomore center Stefan Nastic
buried a three from the top of the
arc, cutting the lead back to eight at
23-15. But Eikmeier responded
with one of his four first-half field
goals to give the Rams the biggest
lead of the opening period at 31-20
with 4:57 remaining.
Stanford then went on a scoring
spree of its own, ending the half on
an 11-2 run that culminated in the
three-quarter-court buzzer-beater
by Flarris, bringing the game back
to 33-31 at intermission.
"We didn't come out necessari
ly how we wanted to play in the
first half. [The buzzer-beater] was
definitely a pick-me-up going into
halftime," Owens said. "To close it
off with that just gave us all kinds of
energy going into halftime."
Flarris, Owens and freshman
guard Chasson Randle led the Car
dinal in scoring in the opening peri
od with six points apiece, Harris,
who missed significant time due to
injury last season, is just one of
many unlikely Stanford players to
make an impact early in the season.
"It's about the players being
worthy enough to be out there,"
said Stanford head coach Johnny

Redshirt senior Josh Owens spearheaded a streaky Cardinal offense on Tuesday, contributing 15 points in a win
over Colorado State. Stanford will now head to New York to play in the semifinals of the NIT Season Tip-Off.
Dawkins, "And the competition has
been healthy for them."
Two quick turnovers by Stanford
after the break made it look like the
momentum from the Harris heave
had ended, as Colorado State quick
ly brought the lead back to five.

The teams went back and forth
before a three-pointer by sopho
more guard Aaron Bright catalyzed
the best offensive stretch of the
night for the Card. Bright accounted
for 11 points in a 13-2 run that also
included a steal and emphatic dunk
by Owens, giving Stanford its
biggest lead of the game at 49-43.
Bright, who led Stanford in scoring
in the first two games of the season,
came to life in the second half, tally
ing eight of his 12 points after the
break.

But when it looked like the
Card was beginning to pull ahead,
Colorado State began chipping at
the lead. Dawkins made the deci
sion to give Bright and Owens a
breather, a move that stagnated the
Stanford offense and allowed the
Rams to pull the game within four.
A controversial tip-slam by Will

Bell followed by an Andrew Zim
mermann goaltend brought the
game to 54-52 with nearly three
minutes remaining.

Josh Owens ended a 6-0 run by
Colorado State by muscling his way
into position and banking home an
easy two, bringing the lead back to
four. Dawkins, who once again
looked unsure of his rotation by
playing 11 men in the first 11 min
utes, finally seemed to find the line
up he was looking for in Bright,
Harris, Mann, sophomore forward
Huestis and Owens. The five, who
recorded the most minutes on the
squad with at least 24 apiece, ac
counted for 53 of Stanford's 64
points and secured the win for the
Card down the stretch with lock
down defense that held Colorado
State scoreless for the final three
minutes of the game.

"We would like to narrow it
down if we possibly could," Dawkins
said. "We have depth this year. You
have different guys stepping up and
that provides us some flexibility with
our personnel at times."
Eikmeier, redshirt junior guard
Jesse Carr and junior forward Greg
Smith, who led the Rams in scoring
in the first half, combined to shoot
just 4-for-18 in the second period
after opening the game 10-for-21.

The win advances Stanford to

Madison Square Garden for the
semifinal round, where it will take
on the winner of today's game be
tween Oklahoma State and Texas-
San Antonio. However, the team
first travels to UC-Davis this Friday
for a matchup with the Aggies.
Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.
