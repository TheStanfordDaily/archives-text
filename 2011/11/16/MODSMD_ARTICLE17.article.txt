# NEW YORK BOUND

Junior guard Gabe Harris col
lected the loose ball, took two drib
bles and launched a 65-foot shot
that hit nothing but net as time ex

pired in the first half. The perfect
miracle heave was exactly what an
ice-cold Stanford squad needed to
right the ship.
The Cardinal (3-0) advanced to
the semifinals of the NIT Season
Tip-Off on Tuesday night, beating

Colorado State 64-52 in Maples
Pavilion. Redshirt senior forward
Josh Owens led the way for Stan
ford with 15 points, with Harris and
sophomore guard Aaron Bright
contributing 12 apiece in what was
a classic tale of two halves.

The first period of play was not
so kind to Stanford's shooting, with
the Cardinal firing 12 fewer shots
than the Rams and connecting on
just 42 percent of those looks. Free
throw shooting once again kept the
game tight, with Stanford going 8-
for-12 and CSU splitting its only
two attempts.

Colorado State streaked out to
an eight-point lead early, with red
shirt junior guard Wes Eikmeier
and junior forward Pierce Hor
nung hitting back-to-back three
pointers to extend the score to 12-
4. Stanford couldn't answer, start
ing 3-for-13 from the field before
sophomore center Stefan Nastic
buried a three from the top of the
arc, cutting the lead back to eight at
23-15. But Eikmeier responded
with one of his four first-half field
goals to give the Rams the biggest
lead of the opening period at 31-20
with 4:57 remaining.
Stanford then went on a scoring
spree of its own, ending the half on
an 11-2 run that culminated in the
three-quarter-court buzzer-beater
by Flarris, bringing the game back
to 33-31 at intermission.
"We didn't come out necessari
ly how we wanted to play in the
first half. [The buzzer-beater] was
definitely a pick-me-up going into
halftime," Owens said. "To close it
off with that just gave us all kinds of
energy going into halftime."
Flarris, Owens and freshman
guard Chasson Randle led the Car
dinal in scoring in the opening peri
od with six points apiece, Harris,
who missed significant time due to
injury last season, is just one of
many unlikely Stanford players to
make an impact early in the season.
"It's about the players being
worthy enough to be out there,"
said Stanford head coach Johnny
