### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
After 11 seasons at the helm
of Stanford's men's soccer pro
gram, Bret Simon announced his
resignation on Tuesday, effective
immediately. Simon led the team
to three NCAA Tournament ap
pearances, as well as two trips to
the College Cup since taking
over for Bobby Clark as head
coach in 2001.
"I have been truly blessed to
have worked at Stanford for the
past 11 seasons," Simon said in a
statement released Tuesday.
"Stanford University is the best
environment in the world to de
velop young people to their
fullest potential."
"It has been a privilege for me
and my family to be a part of this
great educational endeavor. I ap
preciate the opportunity to work
with so many exceptional stu
dent-athletes, talented coaches,
and dedicated administrators
and staff," he added.

Simon's best seasons came

in 2001 and 2002. Those teams
went a combined 36-7-4 and both
played in the College Cup the
2002 team lost 1-0 to UCLA in

games in the NCAA Tournament
before eventually losing to top
seeded Akron in the Round of 16.

and fall out of contention. This past
season, Stanford again suffered

schedule, finishing 6-10-2, fourth in

record in 22 seasons as a collegiate
head coach. He has also been
named Coach of the Year in both
the Pac-10 and Missouri Valley
Conferences.
