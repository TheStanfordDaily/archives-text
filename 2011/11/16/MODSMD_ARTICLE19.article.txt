## Cardinal copes with unfamiliar feeling 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
It's not a normal feeling for the
Stanford football team.
Hoping to rebound from a loss.
Trying to piece together what went
wrong. Working to make it all right
in just a week, with another impor
tant game coming up.
But after watching its perfect
season and the nation's longest
win streak fall apart on Saturday
against Oregon, the No. 9 Cardinal
(9-1,7-1 Pac-12) has to find away to
deal with the unfamiliar letter "L"
on its record.
Redshirt senior tight end Coby
Fleener came up empty when
grasping for any positives to take
away from a tough weekend.
"I don't know. Honestly, I don't
know how to answer that ques
tion," Fleener said. "I don't know if
there's too much good. We're not

looking for moral victories."
Defensive coordinator Derek
Mason was able to find a few more
words, but he acknowledged that
the Cardinal wasn't going to find
much to be happy about.
"It's a feeling of disappoint
ment. [The players] understood
what this game was about," he said.
"When you don't play your best
ball, there's nothing to be excited
about, there's nothing to be happy
about, there's nothing to be over
joyed about."
But even though it was the Car
dinal's first loss in over a year and
its second to the Ducks in as many
years, there is a little bit of prece
dent for Stanford's ability to re
bound in fine fashion.
"It's hard to tell how we'll deal
with [the Oregon game] right now
because we haven't played anyone
yet," redshirt junior guard David
DeCastro said. "Last year obvious
ly we took it pretty well, winning
every game afterwards."
Indeed, after the Cardinal fell to
the Ducks up in Autzen Stadium
last season in week five, it rolled to
eight straight wins and an Orange
Bowl victory. Should the Cardinal
respond the same way this season
with wins against California and
Notre Dame, it might find itself in a
BCS Bowl for the second time in as
many years.

And even though the team
won't find any positives in the Ore
gon game film, Mason said that the
coaching staff and the defense in
particular was going to have to
draw on this game a lot if it wants to

finish strong down the stretch.
"I think coming out of this game,
at the end of the day, you can't play
at 65 percent and go beat a team
that gives you 100 percent like Ore
gon did," Mason said. "It had noth
ing to do with injuries, it had more
to do with execution. We're about
getting guys to the football, tackling
the guy with the ball, and making
sure we play a certain style of de
fense, And we didn't do that.

"We gave up three explosive
plays defensively and we gave up
three red zone opportunities where
we didn't get stops.That's 42 points.
And you can't do that. I don't care
where the ball is set down," he con
tinued.
DeCastro echoed his coach
when he said the Cardinal could
draw on its experienced leaders in
order to get back in the swing of
things with the Big Game coming
up this weekend.
"I think it's trying to be mature

and realize that you can't get down
on yourself," he said. "You can't be
freaking out, you've got to be like,
'what did we do wrong? Let's fix it
and move on to Cal.'"

Altogether, Mason said the
team had done a good job of keep
ing the loss and the fact that the
season isn't over yet in perspec
tive, but he was fully aware that the
Cardinal couldn't coast into this
game still licking its wounds.
"At the end of the day, give all
the credit to Oregon. No excuses,
no explanations. They're a good
team and so are we," he said. "We
can't let Oregon beat us twice. We
lost to Oregon, and now we've got
to go beat Cal."
The Cardinal kicks off against
Cal this Saturday in the 114 th Big
Game at 7:15 p.m. at Stanford Sta
dium.

"At the end of the day, give all
the credit to Oregon. No excuses,
no explanations. They're a good

lost to Oregon, and now we've got
to go beat Cal."
The Cardinal kicks off against
Cal this Saturday in the 114 th Big
