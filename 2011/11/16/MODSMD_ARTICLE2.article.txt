# Occupy movement takes root at Stanford
## Members face challenges in mobilizing largely unresponsive student body 
### EDWARD NGAI 
Occupy Stanford continues to
plan protests and rallies despite
challenges it has faced in igniting the
student body, according to Joshua
Loftus, an active member of the or
ganization.
Loftus, a first-year Ph.D. student
in statistics, said the group is trying
to build momentum from two maj or
events in the past few weeks: a cam
pus-wide walkout on Nov. 2 and a
protest at a Goldman Sachs recruit -

ment presentation on Nov. 8. The
group hopes these events will in
spire more people to join the
protest.

" [Goldman Sachs] has been at
the center of some of the main prob
lems of Wall Street in the crash that
happened," Loftus said. "You can
see Goldman Sachs' hand at work in
pretty much any big financial prob
lem in recent history. It goes back as
far as the Great Depression."
To protest, Occupy Stanford
members could R.S.V.P. to the re

cruitment event through the Career
Development Center (CDC), hand
out pamphlets to those in atten
dance and prepare questions for
Goldman Sachs representatives.
But not all went according to plan.
"They didn't have a question
and-answer session," Loftus said.
"That just killed the plans of the
people who were going to ask
[provocative] questions."

"But then some of the students
stayed afterwards at the networking
reception and went around to some

of the different [Goldman Sachs]
employees," he added.
The disappointment at the re
cruitment event wasn't the only
challenge the Occupy Stanford
movement has had to overcome.
"The week of the alumni re
union, I wanted to do something vis
ible," Loftus said. "I tried to organize
a protest march by the Alumni Cen
ter, and it basically failed because
only two people showed up. So that
was kind of a low point."
Of all the problems Occupy

Stanford has had to deal with, low
turnout seems to be most promi
nent, according to Zach O'Keeffe
'l3, a member of Occupy Stanford.
"I'm a bit disappointed," O'Ke
effe said. "I can't say that I judge a
lot of students [for not showing up to
events] because I understand that
it's hard. It's been difficult academi
cally for me, too ... but ultimately it
is disappointing and I'd really like
more people to get involved."
O'Keeffe said Occupy Stanford
faces many unique challenges in ral
lying support, but a large part of the
group's difficulty has had to do with
its fundamental structure as an anti-

hierarchical, grassroots movement.
"A lot of people who are working
on [Occupy Stanford] aren't experi
enced in the way that more institu
tionalized groups who have organ
ized structures are," O'Keeffe said.
"We're just kind of getting together
and starting from scratch."
Occupy Stanford's meetings, the
forum in which members decide

what and when to protest, may seem
difficult to navigate for those inter
ested in the Occupy movement, ac
cording to O'Keeffe.These meetings
use a general assembly format,
where there is no leader and no
agenda.

Both Loftus and O'Keeffe com
mented that none of the members
carry titles within the organization.
"It can be frustrating, especially
for newcomers who aren't used to
it," O'Keeffe said. "It may have
turned some people off, actually, but
as the movement's been growing, I
think it's gotten a lot more efficient.

Every time I go I feel like we've ac
complished something."
TTie Occupiers have also faced
questions about the relative wealth
of Stanford students.

"But what use is it to be at the top
of a pyramid that's crumbling?" Lof
tus said. "In the long run, the entire
world is going to be worse off if we
don't fix [the problem of the weak
middle class]."
Despite the challenges and stu
dent skepticism, Occupy Stanford
activists said they are finding mean
ing in the protests despite their orga
nizational difficulties. In particular,
O'Keeffe said he felt this larger
meaning during a camp-out the or
ganization held in White Plaza last
Monday.
"I really got a sense of what these
people occupying [at Occupy camps]
are really going through," O'Keeffe
said. "I felt for the first time, 'This is
probably what it's like to be home
less.'"

Chris Herries 'l5, another
camper, agreed.
"Even though we didn't evoke
immediate social change on the spot,
strangers came up to me to discuss
the movement," Herries said. "I
think discussion is the most impor
tant step towards social change."

effe said. "I can't say that I judge a
lot of students [for not showing up to
events] because I understand that
it's hard. It's been difficult academi
cally for me, too ... but ultimately it
is disappointing and I'd really like
more people to get involved."
O'Keeffe said Occupy Stanford
faces many unique challenges in ral
lying support, but a large part of the
group's difficulty has had to do with
its fundamental structure as an anti-

hierarchical, grassroots movement.
"A lot of people who are working
on [Occupy Stanford] aren't experi
enced in the way that more institu
tionalized groups who have organ
ized structures are," O'Keeffe said.
"We're just kind of getting together
and starting from scratch."
Occupy Stanford's meetings, the
forum in which members decide

what and when to protest, may seem
difficult to navigate for those inter
ested in the Occupy movement, ac
cording to O'Keeffe.These meetings
use a general assembly format,
where there is no leader and no
agenda.

Both Loftus and O'Keeffe com
mented that none of the members
carry titles within the organization.
"It can be frustrating, especially
for newcomers who aren't used to
it," O'Keeffe said. "It may have
turned some people off, actually, but
as the movement's been growing, I
think it's gotten a lot more efficient.

Every time I go I feel like we've ac
complished something."
TTie Occupiers have also faced
questions about the relative wealth
of Stanford students.

"But what use is it to be at the top
of a pyramid that's crumbling?" Lof
tus said. "In the long run, the entire
world is going to be worse off if we
don't fix [the problem of the weak
middle class]."
Despite the challenges and stu
dent skepticism, Occupy Stanford
activists said they are finding mean
ing in the protests despite their orga
nizational difficulties. In particular,
O'Keeffe said he felt this larger
meaning during a camp-out the or
ganization held in White Plaza last
Monday.
"I really got a sense of what these
people occupying [at Occupy camps]
are really going through," O'Keeffe
said. "I felt for the first time, 'This is
probably what it's like to be home
less.'"

Chris Herries 'l5, another
camper, agreed.
"Even though we didn't evoke
immediate social change on the spot,
strangers came up to me to discuss
the movement," Herries said. "I
think discussion is the most impor
tant step towards social change."
