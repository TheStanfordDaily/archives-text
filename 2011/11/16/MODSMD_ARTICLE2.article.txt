# Occupy movement takes root at Stanford
## Members face challenges in mobilizing largely unresponsive student body 
### EDWARD NGAI 
Occupy Stanford continues to
plan protests and rallies despite
challenges it has faced in igniting the
student body, according to Joshua
Loftus, an active member of the or
ganization.
Loftus, a first-year Ph.D. student
in statistics, said the group is trying
to build momentum from two maj or
events in the past few weeks: a cam
pus-wide walkout on Nov. 2 and a
protest at a Goldman Sachs recruit -

ment presentation on Nov. 8. The
group hopes these events will in
spire more people to join the
protest.

" [Goldman Sachs] has been at
the center of some of the main prob
lems of Wall Street in the crash that
happened," Loftus said. "You can
see Goldman Sachs' hand at work in
pretty much any big financial prob
lem in recent history. It goes back as
far as the Great Depression."
To protest, Occupy Stanford
members could R.S.V.P. to the re

cruitment event through the Career
Development Center (CDC), hand
out pamphlets to those in atten
dance and prepare questions for
Goldman Sachs representatives.
But not all went according to plan.
"They didn't have a question
and-answer session," Loftus said.
"That just killed the plans of the
people who were going to ask
[provocative] questions."

"But then some of the students
stayed afterwards at the networking
reception and went around to some

of the different [Goldman Sachs]
employees," he added.
The disappointment at the re
cruitment event wasn't the only
challenge the Occupy Stanford
movement has had to overcome.
"The week of the alumni re
union, I wanted to do something vis
ible," Loftus said. "I tried to organize
a protest march by the Alumni Cen
ter, and it basically failed because
only two people showed up. So that
was kind of a low point."
Of all the problems Occupy

Stanford has had to deal with, low
turnout seems to be most promi
nent, according to Zach O'Keeffe
'l3, a member of Occupy Stanford.
"I'm a bit disappointed," O'Ke
effe said. "I can't say that I judge a
lot of students [for not showing up to
events] because I understand that
it's hard. It's been difficult academi
cally for me, too ... but ultimately it
is disappointing and I'd really like
more people to get involved."
