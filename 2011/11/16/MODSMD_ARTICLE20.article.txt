# FINISH LINE IN SIGHT
## Men, women qualify for NCAA Championships 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Running in front of a home crowd for the final time
in their careers, the men's cross country senior trio of
Chris Derrick, Jake Riley and Brendan Gregg all
cruised to top-10 finishes at the NCAA West Region
al Championships on Saturday.
Their efforts, combined with strong finishes from
freshman Joe Rosa and sophomore Erik Olson, gave
the Cardinal the win and a spot in next week's NCAA
Championships.
Just a few hours later on the same course, junior
Kathy Kroeger led the women's squad to an at-large
bid in the NCAAs after her seventh-place effort
helped No. 13 Stanford finish third behind No. 3 Wash
ington and No. 8 Arizona.
It was a nice rebound from the men's performance
at the Pac-12 Championships two weeks ago, when
Colorado snuck past the No. 5 Cardinal down the
stretch to grab the conference crown, a fact that was
not lost on Gregg.
"It was nice to go out with a win," he said after the
race. "Regionals is all about qualifying, but it's good to
get a 'W.' And it was fun finishing in front of a home
crowd for the last time on the golf course."
Derrick, Riley, Gregg and Rosa ran together for
much of the race, with Derrick eventually breaking off
to try and run down leader Lawi Lalang in the final
kilometers. Riley hung with the lead chase pack, fin
ishing fifth and covering the 10-kilometer course in
28:59, while Gregg was content to take a spot at the
head of the second pack, 27 seconds back of Riley.
Rosa and Olson couldn't sustain the pace over the
full distance, but both held on to break 30 minutes and
help stave off a late charge by Portland, which had two
runners sandwiched between Derrick and Riley but
finished just three points back of Stanford.

Men's coach Jason Dunn said before the race that
he was hoping the team would be able to shut out the
distractions that came with being on campus for ESPN
Game Day's arrival and the festivities early that morn
ing. After the race, he was optimistic that his team
might be peaking at the right time this year, as op
posed to previous seasons that saw dominant regular
season efforts followed by difficult defeats at the
NCAA Championships.
"Brendan ran really well and I thought Joe Rosa
did great in his first 10k," Dunn told GoStanford.com.
"He is really coming around well and I am excited
where he is at. We still need to shore up a few of our
guys. I still don't feel like we have had a great day all
year long. I am hoping that great day is going to be
nine days from now."
Women's coach PattiSue Plumer shared some of
Dunn's slight disappointment, as she had hoped the
team would bounce back from its third-place finish at
the Pac-12 Championships and run better on its home
course.
"I thought it was a solid race for us," Plumer said. "I
was a little disappointed that we did not get second,
but I was happy with the effort."
While Kroeger ran her usual top-10 caliber race,
redshirt senior Stephanie Marcy, freshman Aisling
Cuffe and sophomore Jessica Tonn all turned in very
nice efforts as well Marcy, Cuffe and Tonn finished
in 11th, 22nd and 29th places respectively.
But from there it was 13 spots back to the team's

fifth and final scorer, junior Claire Durkin in 42nd
place. Meanwhile, the Huskies slipped all five of their
top runners into the top 15, running away with the title
by 48 points over the Wildcats and 61 points better
than the Cardinal.
After the race, Stanford slipped out of the top 10 in
the rankings, moving down five spots from No. 8 to No.
13. It will be a tough task for anyone to take down No.
1 Florida State, the favorite on the women's side with
just one race remaining.

The Cardinal is among the group of about six
schools considered to be contenders for the NCAA
