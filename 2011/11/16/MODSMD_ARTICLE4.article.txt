## Proposed bill 'admonishes' ASSU Pres. Legislation pressures Cruz to nominate reps 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
Elections Commissioner Adam
Adler 'l2 submitted a bill titled, "A Bill
to Encourage People to Do What They
Should Already Be Doing" at the 13th
meeting of the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate Tuesday evening.
Adler, whose presence dominated
the meeting as long discussions arose
surrounding several bills he presented,
sought to "admonish" ASSU Executive
President Michael Cruz 'l2 to appoint
members to the Constitutional Coun
cil, in addition to admonishing the
Nominations Committee to appoint so
licitor generals and Senator Alex
Kindel 'l4 to make a current version of
the ASSU governing documents avail
able.
"I can't enforce the regulations if
I don't know what the regulations
are," Adler said to the Senate,

Senator Janani Ramachandran
'l4 objected to using the word "ad
monish," noting it was "rude."
"It's not that they're not doing
their job. It's just one part of their
job," Ramachandran said.
Adler rejoined that he felt the
word was justified.
The bill would be voted upon in
two weeks as a result of Thanksgiv
ing Break, but both Adler and Sen
ator Ben Laufer 'l2 said the Senate
would not have to pass the bill if
these positions were filled during
that time, rendering the point moot.
Adler also presented a bill seek
ing the Senate's help in clarifying
multiple sections of the governing
documents.

"When you look at the joint by
laws, they're an incoherent mess,"
Adler said. "There's a general sense
of carelessness in the documents I
have."

The bill seeks to address several
inconsistencies and vague language,
as well as an apparent violation of
current law.

The bylaws prohibit groups that
apply for special fees from having
money in different, non-ASSU ac
counts unless a special exemption is
granted every year, and an inde
pendent auditor must review those
accounts.

For instance, Adler said The
Daily receives special fees, but that
there is no independent auditor or
exemption issued every year. Cruz
said that a previous University pres
ident amended the constitution to
specifically exempt The Daily from
a yearly check.
Adler responded that he was
simply raising the issue to the atten

tion of the Senate, and that it was up
to the governing body to determine
the legitimacy of the apparent in
consistency.

In addition to these updates, the
Senate briefly discussed various ad
vocacy groups the senators are in
volved in personally, though not di
rectly related to official Senate busi
ness. Senate Chair Rafael Vazquez
'l2 encouraged all senators, espe
cially Queer Coalition candidates,
to attend Intersections Week at
Stanford.

Senator Shawn Dye 'l4 dis
cussed a program to promote social
justice and stand in solidarity with
UC-Berkeley students against po
lice brutality. A march of Stanford
and Berkeley students is scheduled
to take place on the Saturday of Big
Game and is currently being mar
keted with the slogan, "Social Jus
tice is bigger than Big Game."
More time was spent discussing
this topic than the others, as senators
questioned how to best address var
ious issues, including whether Satur
day's march will serve as an endorse
ment of the Occupy movement. Dis
cussion was cut short by Senate
Deputy Chair Dan Ashton 'l4.

"I don't think we should be wast
ing our time discussing it when it's
an individual thing," Ashton said.
Senator Dan Delong 'l3 dis
agreed, but Vazquez moved discus
sion forward and told senators to
contact Dye later for more informa
tion.

Laufer updated the Senate on
the conclusion to the University of
Southern California (USC) football
game ticket reimbursement pro
gram, reporting that 242 students
sought reimbursement, nearly fill
ing the allotted 250 spots. Checks
will likely be processed and distrib
uted in the Stanford Student Enter
prises (SSE) offices in the coming
weeks, Laufer said.
