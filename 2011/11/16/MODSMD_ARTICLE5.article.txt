## Pearson analyzes international student data 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
John Pearson, assistant vice
provost and director of Bechtel
International Center, spoke on
Tuesday about the trends, chal
lenges and experiences of inter
national students at Stanford.
The talk came in the wake of
recent and upcoming changes in
the visa policies affecting inter
national students. Pearson pro
vided a historical overview of
the composition and situation of
the international student body,
drawing from data and qualita
tive accounts published previ
ously in The Daily.
"The 1960s and 1990s saw a
tremendous increase in interna
tional students these were
replicated nationally," Pearson
said. "Stanford has never been
that different in increases over
the years compared to the na
tional levels."
Pearson did, however, note
one exception.
"One of the distinct differ
ences between Stanford and

many other schools in the coun
try is that we have more gradu
ate [students] than undergrads
from overseas," he said. "It was
only in 2001 that that was true
nationally."
Of these graduate students,
most enroll at the School of En
gineering, where internationals
make up 44 percent of the stu
dent body.
Before presenting data on
international student enroll
ment trends, Pearson men
tioned one caveat. Stanford has
not always categorized interna
tional students consistently
permanent residents, for exam
ple, were included in the data
until 1987,butnotsince.This can
affect the numbers in the data as
well as comparative analysis.
There are currently 3,747 de
gree-seeking undergraduate
and graduate students making
up the international student
body at Stanford, a number that
has gradually risen from the 32
international students in 1910.

John Pearson, assistant vice provost and director of Bechtel International
Center, presented data on historical trends involving the international student
body on campus, which grew from 32 students in 1910 to 3,747 this year.
The first international student to
obtain a degree graduated in 1894 as
part of the first class, majoring in zool
ogy. The Stanford Observer reflected
in 1991 that in Stanford's first year,
foreign students particularly
Japanese students outnumbered
American-born minorities.

At this time, Chinese and Japan
ese communities were the largest. In
1900,19 Japanese students, with the
support of then-president John
Casper Branner, formed a Japanese
student association. Yet these stu
dents' experiences at Stanford were
not all positive.
According to Pearson, up to
World War 11, Asian students were
not allowed to live in dorms with
other students. In the early 19205, a
Chinese student living in Encina Hall
was expelled by Caucasian students,
which led to the creation of the Chi
nese Club House, which existed in the
1920s and 19305.
In 1942, 24 Japanese-American
Stanford students were sent to in
ternment camps.
These problems disproportion
ately affected students of Asian ori
gin, but broader challenges were si
multaneously affecting the interna
tional student body at large, accord
ing to Pearson, who cited a 1949
School of Education master's thesis
on trends in international student en
rollment.
The thesis concluded that issues
facing international students includ
ed language difficulties, exchange
rates, social adjustment, discrimina
tion and difficulty in achieving intel
lectual exchange with American stu
dents and concerns over different ap
proaches to academic work.

"All of those issues we still deal
with," Pearson said.
He highlighted problems under
standing and dealing with the Honor
Code and the fact that Stanford's ad
mission for international students is
not need-blind.

As of fall 2011, the majority of in
ternational students 59 percent
are from Asia. From higher to lower
representation follows Europe, the
Americas, the Middle East and North
Africa, the Pacific Basin and Africa.
Two students are politically stateless.
The regional proportions of inter
national students represent a signifi
cant change over the past five
decades. Following the 1949 estab
lishment of the People's Republic of

China, no students from mainland
China came to Stanford for 30 years.
"By far the biggest number of stu
dents now is from mainland China,"
Pearson said. "It's very hard to imag
ine a campus where there were no
mainland Chinese students."

"China going red" was not the
only political happening to affect
Stanford internationals. The 1979
Iranian revolution reduced the num
ber of Iranian students "immediately
and drastically," Pearson said.

Two Iranian students from Stan
ford were involved in the takeover of
the Iranian consulate in San Francisco.
Prior to the revolution, the largest stu
dent population in the United States
was from Iran, but from 1979 onward,
the baton was passed to China.
Since Tiananmen Square in 1989,
the political incident that has most af
fected internationals has been the
Sept. 11 attacks.
"9/11 completely altered every
body's world, but certainly altered
the world of international students,"
Pearson said. "We now have moved
from really being advisors to being
data analysts."
"We report to the government
every day on students," Pearson con
tinued. "Last year we sent 47,000

alerts to the federal government
about international students at Stan
ford, mostly benign."
Pearson mentioned changes in
address and major as examples of
alerts that must be sent to the federal
government.
"Students now have to tell us, and
we tell the government, not their ad
dress, but their room number in their
dorm," he added.
Despite these difficulties, Pearson
noted the services Bechtel Interna
tional Center provides to interna
tional students, including an annual
orientation and a half-day workshop
on learning styles to help students
adapt to the American educational
system.

He ended on a piece of legislation
soon-to-be before Congress to help
international students in science,
technology, engineering and math
(STEM) fields remain in the country
post-graduation.
Attendees posed questions on the
problem posed by cultural back
grounds in understanding the Honor
Code, need-blind admissions and the
international student admission pool.
