## Pearson analyzes international student data 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
John Pearson, assistant vice
provost and director of Bechtel
International Center, spoke on
Tuesday about the trends, chal
lenges and experiences of inter
national students at Stanford.
The talk came in the wake of
recent and upcoming changes in
the visa policies affecting inter
national students. Pearson pro
vided a historical overview of
the composition and situation of
the international student body,
drawing from data and qualita
tive accounts published previ
ously in The Daily.
"The 1960s and 1990s saw a
tremendous increase in interna
tional students these were
replicated nationally," Pearson
said. "Stanford has never been
that different in increases over
the years compared to the na
tional levels."
Pearson did, however, note
one exception.
"One of the distinct differ
ences between Stanford and

many other schools in the coun
try is that we have more gradu
ate [students] than undergrads
from overseas," he said. "It was
only in 2001 that that was true
nationally."
Of these graduate students,
most enroll at the School of En
gineering, where internationals
make up 44 percent of the stu
dent body.
Before presenting data on
international student enroll
ment trends, Pearson men
tioned one caveat. Stanford has
not always categorized interna
tional students consistently
permanent residents, for exam
ple, were included in the data
until 1987,butnotsince.This can
affect the numbers in the data as
well as comparative analysis.
There are currently 3,747 de
gree-seeking undergraduate
and graduate students making
up the international student
body at Stanford, a number that
has gradually risen from the 32
international students in 1910.
