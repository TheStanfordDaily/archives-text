## Crowding decreases at Arrillaga Students return to home dining halls 
### ALICE PHILLIPS 
Arrillaga Family Dining Com
mons' crowding issues have sub
sided considerably since the new
dining facility opened this fall.
Smaller crowds came after a plea
Stanford Dining made in October
that students who are not residents
of Toy on or Crothers eat elsewhere.
"Recently, we have started to see
students eating in their home dining
halls," Administrative Program
Manager of Stanford Dining Cyn
thia Liu wrote in an email to The
Daily. "We are monitoring and re
viewing transactions to determine
student dining patterns."
Arrillaga was initially over
whelmed by the sheer number of
students eating there, despite a
greater-than-average seating capac
ity that was intended to accommo
date an influx as students opted to
try the new venue. The 675 seats in
Arrillaga Family Dining Commons
exceed the over-530 associated resi
dents of Crothers Hall and Toyon
Hall.

"Although we expected students
would be thrilled to eat in the new
dining hall, the overwhelming vol
ume of enthusiastic responses
amazed us," Liu said.

Students have become less en
thusiastic about Arrillaga as the
quarter wears on, citing its novelty
as the source of its popularity
among students.
"I was definitely surprised about
how popular it became, especially
among my residents who really did
n't have anything to compare it to,"
Larkin Resident Assistant Carlo
Pasco 'l3 wrote in an email to The
Daily. "They would say how much
better it is than Stern [dining], when
Stern's food has stepped up."
Henry Patterson 'l5, a Wilbur
resident, said that crowding has
served to counteract Arrillaga's ini
tial popularity.
"It's overrated," Patterson said.
"I mean, it's good; but it's not that
great. It's also too crowded."
Pasco said he has noticed many
of his freshman residents eschew
ing Arrillaga for dining options
closer to home, suggesting that stu
dents are no longer favoring the
newer dining hall.

"I've been so touched to see
Stern filled with Larkinites, espe
cially after the first two or three
weeks, when I would eat with
maybe four other people," he said.
"They're slowly coming back."
In early October, Stanford Din
ing mounted a campaign to drive
students back to their own dining
halls, as announced by ASSU Presi
dent Michael Cruz 'l2 during an
Oct. 11 meeting of the ASSU Sen
ate.

Arrillaga Dining, the first dining
hall to be built on campus in nearly
20 years, is unique among campus
dining halls in that it serves food to
students on the meal plan outside
of the traditional meal hours, which
can be advantageous to athletes
and students who take classes dur
ing normal meal times.
"We will be offering continuous
meal service as part of a pilot pro
gram at Arrillaga Family Dining
Commons on weekdays, serving
meals between breakfast and
lunch, and lunch and dinner," Liu
said. "This will allow students who
are not able to make the traditional
meal times due to class schedules,

etc., the ability to eat a full meal."
Arrillaga is also the host of the
Performance Dining Initiative,
which serves food in six categories:
enhanced immunity, anti-inflam
matory components, food synergy,
brain performance, sports perform
ance and antioxidants.

Liu emphasized that every din
ing hall has unique features analo
gous to Arrillaga's Performance
Dining Initiative, which has been
promoted by Stanford Dining for
its "synergistic food and nutrient
combinations and performance
themes" that "help students per
form at their mental and physical
peak." Stern hosts Stanford Din
ing's collaboration with Mark
Miller of Cardinal Sage, while
Wilbur and Lakeside Latenite both
feature menu items associate with
the Star Ginger@Stanford Viet
namese and Thai program. Man
zanita Dining has a new chef this
year and Lakeside Dining is dis
playing student art in collaboration
with the Stanford University Arts
Initiative.

"All the dining halls share a ro
tating menu, supplemented by
characteristics and concepts that
highlight each dining hall's unique
characteristics," Liu said.
