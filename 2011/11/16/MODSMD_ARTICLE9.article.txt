## Lucile Packard takes data in STRIDE 
### JOSEE SMITH 
A team at the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital has adopted a
new approach to storing patients'
electronic medical records (EMR)
called the Stanford Translational
Research Integrated Database En
vironment (STRIDE), according to
a perspective paper published in the
New England Journal of Medicine.

This new method allows doctors
to compare their current patients
with previous patients with similar
symptoms and factors, and helps to
determine the best step to take
when issuing a treatment, according
to the team. Physicians are no
longer solely reliant on past experi
ences or forced to sift through the
hundreds of pages contained in a
chart for a single patient, said
Christopher Longhurst, chief med
ical information officer at the Chil
dren's hospital and a co-author of
the paper.
"Wouldn't it be great if comput
ers stored the data and helped you
understand how to help other pa
tients?" said Longhurst, who is also
an architect of the Children's hospi
tal EMR system. He added that
doctors are now able to help current
patients by looking at other patients
that have been admitted with simi
lar symptoms.
Longhurst said that a current
challenge for doctors is that pub
lished evidence is available for
fewer than 20 percent of decisions
made, which forces doctors to rely
instead on their own experience
and anecdotal advice from their
peers. This is especially true in pedi

atrics because less information is
published in medical research liter
ature in that area, he added.

According to the paper, this new
method of storing and accessing in
formation was put to the test when
a 13-year-old girl was admitted to
the hospital with inflammation of
both the kidneys and pancreas as a
result of lupus a rare condition
that did not have any clinical trials
or medical literature to offer up a
best course of action.

Jennifer Frankovich, who led the
medical team, said that because of
the girl's risk for thrombosis a
formation of a blood clot inside a
blood vessel that obstructs the flow
of blood the team realized that
the girl would require anticoagula
tion drugs to prevent blood clots.
She added, however, that the team
thought the use of drugs could lead
to internal bleeding, and was unable
to find studies pertaining to the girl's
situation and related risks.
The team then turned to
STRIDE and the hospital's elec
tronic medical record to view a co
hort of pediatric patients with the
girl's condition that had been treat
ed by clinicians at the Children's
hospital between Oct. 2004 and July
2009, according to Frankovich. Of
the 98 patients in the cohort, 10 de
veloped thrombosis.
After a statistical analysis of the
data which took less than four
hours the team was able to deter
mine that the risk for blood clots was
much higher in patients with inflam
mation in the kidneys and pancreas,
and decided to give the patient anti
coagulants within 24 hours of admis-

sion, according to the paper.
"I envision that this is going to be
the future of all medicine that
most institutions are going to use
electronic records," Frankovich
said. "We are working toward mak
ing these records accessible for clin
ical research. It is a major change in
how we process medicine."

Frankovich also said that be
cause a doctor cannot look at a pa
tient's chart without permission, the
new platform is working to
anonymize patient records by re
moving all personal information

such as names and birthdates
with the hope of increasing the num
ber of records that can be refer
enced in patient care.
"However, [STRIDE] doesn't
supplement the need for medical tri
als," she said. "Obtaining the infor
mation doesn't tell you if a certain
treatment is better or worse. You
still have to interpret the informa
tion with caution."

Longhurst also referenced Pa
tients Like Me, a social networking
health site founded in Silicon Valley,
which enables patients with unusual
diseases to log in and share their
data and outcomes with other pa
tients. He said systems like STRIDE
and Patients Like Me help to gener
ate a large warehouse of data and
req anduire the active participation
of patients, but allow everyone to
better understand medical informa
tion.
"Shouldn't data act like that?" he
asked.
