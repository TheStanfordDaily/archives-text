# San Mateo imposes building regulations
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marianne LeVine 
The San Mateo County Board of
Supervisors agreed Tuesday to im
pose temporary regulations for
building homes in the Stanford
Weekend Acres Neighborhood. The
new regulations will restrict the size
of new homes by limiting the height,
number of stories and floor space.
The new restrictions were estab
lished in response to a resident's pro
posal to build two homes on a 12,500
square foot lot.
According to the new regula
tions, the maximum height of the
homes will be limited to two stories
instead of three. In addition, lots that
are fewer than 5,000 square feet will
be allowed a maximum of 2,800
square feet for floor space. Floor
space for lots that exceed 5,000
square feet will be determined by a
formula.
According to Lennie Roberts, a
representative for the Committee
for Green Foothills, the majority of
Stanford Weekend Acres residents
support the new restrictions.
The Board or Supervisors also
placed a moratorium on new build
ing permits for new or major remod
els of single-family homes in the
neighborhood in October.
