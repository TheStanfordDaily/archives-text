## CHECKMATE Scam School host Brian Brushwood teaches Stanford Chess Club magic tricks 
### JUSTINE ZHANG 
At 6 p.m. in Tresidder Union on a
cold Friday evening, members
of the Stanford Chess Club
crowded around a board,
brows furrowed at the puzzle
posed before them.
The puzzle was this: place eight queens
on a standard eight-by-eight chessboard
such that no queen is able to attack another.
The puzzle was posed by visiting magi
cian Brian Brushwood, who looked on as
eight Stanford students rose to the chal
lenge, moving pieces around the board
and drawing on their intellect and chess
intuition to find the desired orientation.
Their efforts were filmed by cameras
and will eventually air as an episode of
Brushwood's popular web series, "Scam
School."
The premise of "Scam School" is to
"teach you scams to mess with your
friends, get the girl and (of course) score a
free drink," according to Brushwood's
website.
The puzzles posed by Brushwood to
the chess team are challenging, and in a
bar situation, would probably "frustrate
people enough to buy you a beer," Brush
wood said.
Halfway through filming the show,
Brushwood demonstrated the "Chess

ESP" trick, announcing that he and a
chess club member had been "struck by
radioactive lightning" and gained the
miraculous ability to read each other's
minds. While his co-conspirator looked
away with his ears plugged, another chess
player selected a piece and placed it into
Brushwood's mug. Brushwood slammed
the mug onto the chessboard and told his
accomplice to turn around and take a
guess.
"White rook!" his accomplice said to
the stunned disbelief of the other club
members.
Intellectual pursuits
"Chess should be encouraged so that
students can develop analytical, mathe
matical and critical thinking skills," wrote
chess club president Burjis Godrej 'l4 in
an email to The Daily.
Much of the challenge for club member
Andrew Rodriguez 'l5 comes from "figur
ing out what to do" or exploring poten
tial moves and their consequences.
For Eric Thong 'l5, another club mem
ber, the biggest challenge in chess is com
ing up with a strategy to recover a losing
position. In such a case, one's ability to
weigh the risks of every move is com
pounded by the psychological burden of
having to beat the odds.
Brushwood's "intense interest in chess"
emerged during his college years. The

heightened sensitivity to the opponent's
pieces and their position on the board, es
pecially when one is at a disadvantage, is
comparable to the situational awareness a
magician must adopt when executing a
trick, Brushwood said.
A magician maps out these probabili
ties and possible audience reactions in the
same way that a chess player maps out
moves. According to Brushwood, having a
chess player's intuition aids him in his per
formance. It allows Brushwood himself to
"begin acts without having any idea how
[he'll] be proceeding," because he has
enough tricks up his sleeve for every move
and outcome.
Unlike many magicians, Brushwood is
always eager to explain his craft. For in
stance, the "Chess ESP" trick wasn't
passed off without an explanation to the
chess team. Brushwood even had Ro
driguez and Parabal Singh 'l5 reenact the
trick and "read each other's minds," giving
them pointers about showmanship along
the way.
Brushwood attributed the reasons be
hind this teaching approach to the difficul
ties he faced in his early days as a magi
cian.
"When I first started out with magic, it
was hard to find tricks," Brushwood said.
The shortage of magic tricks motivated
Brushwood to spread his own knowledge.
This "open-source" approach to magic can

capture an audience as much as a well-ex
ecuted act, Brushwood argued.
The last act
The heart of Brushwood's final trick
was in audience participation. Brushwood
explained the classic ploy: a con man
walks into a chess club and demands 10 si
multaneous matches with the club's 10
best players, knowing that he will win or
draw in at least half of the games.
The con man's trick is copying the
moves made by one of his opponents play
ing white in a match against an opponent
playing black, and vice versa. This manipu
lates the conman's opponents to play
against each other rather than the con man.
Brushwood gave away the trick from
the outset, because he was interested to see
if it would work in practice to see if a
magician possessed enough talent in mem
ory and situational awareness to pull it off.
Chess player Elliott Liu 'l2 rose to the
challenge. He managed to win or draw two
of his four opponents, coolly meandering
between chessboards and trash talking as
he made his moves.
Liu's confidence in the last act came
from discovering the best ways to execute
the trick, combining his skill as a chess
player with a magician's sense of show.

tial moves and their consequences.
For Eric Thong 'l5, another club mem
ber, the biggest challenge in chess is com
ing up with a strategy to recover a losing
position. In such a case, one's ability to
weigh the risks of every move is com
pounded by the psychological burden of
having to beat the odds.
Brushwood's "intense interest in chess"
emerged during his college years. The

heightened sensitivity to the opponent's
pieces and their position on the board, es
pecially when one is at a disadvantage, is
comparable to the situational awareness a
magician must adopt when executing a
trick, Brushwood said.
A magician maps out these probabili
ties and possible audience reactions in the
same way that a chess player maps out
moves. According to Brushwood, having a
chess player's intuition aids him in his per
formance. It allows Brushwood himself to
"begin acts without having any idea how
[he'll] be proceeding," because he has
enough tricks up his sleeve for every move
and outcome.
Unlike many magicians, Brushwood is
always eager to explain his craft. For in
stance, the "Chess ESP" trick wasn't
passed off without an explanation to the
chess team. Brushwood even had Ro
driguez and Parabal Singh 'l5 reenact the
trick and "read each other's minds," giving
them pointers about showmanship along
the way.
Brushwood attributed the reasons be
hind this teaching approach to the difficul
ties he faced in his early days as a magi
cian.
"When I first started out with magic, it
was hard to find tricks," Brushwood said.
The shortage of magic tricks motivated
Brushwood to spread his own knowledge.
This "open-source" approach to magic can

capture an audience as much as a well-ex
ecuted act, Brushwood argued.
The last act
The heart of Brushwood's final trick
was in audience participation. Brushwood
explained the classic ploy: a con man
walks into a chess club and demands 10 si
multaneous matches with the club's 10
best players, knowing that he will win or
draw in at least half of the games.
The con man's trick is copying the
moves made by one of his opponents play
ing white in a match against an opponent
playing black, and vice versa. This manipu
lates the conman's opponents to play
against each other rather than the con man.
Brushwood gave away the trick from
the outset, because he was interested to see
if it would work in practice to see if a
magician possessed enough talent in mem
ory and situational awareness to pull it off.
Chess player Elliott Liu 'l2 rose to the
challenge. He managed to win or draw two
of his four opponents, coolly meandering
between chessboards and trash talking as
he made his moves.
Liu's confidence in the last act came
from discovering the best ways to execute
the trick, combining his skill as a chess
player with a magician's sense of show.
