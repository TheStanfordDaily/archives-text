# A 						Renaissance man's wayward path
## PROFILE 
### CHRIS FREDERICK 
With his tweed jacket and
tinted Ray-Ban glasses,
Patrick Hunt makes a
strong impression. An ar
chaeologist by training,
Hunt has traveled to digs around the world
to deepen our understanding of the past.
Still, his pursuits defy easy categorization
when he's not excavating or teaching, Hunt
keeps busy as a writer, composer, poet and
art historian.
At Stanford, Hunt is a lecturer in the Struc
tured Liberal Education (SLE) program. Be
sides teaching classes in the anthropology and
classics departments. Hunt is also the director
of the Stanford Alpine Archaeology Project, a
research program that specializes in high-alti
tude excavations. Each summer, Hunt takes a
group of Stanford students to Europe to re
trace Hannibal's crossing of the Alps.
Even in his early years, Hunt had a strong
passion for academia, even if it didn't translate
into being a model student. As a boy in San
Diego, Hunt had a complicated relationship
with school.
"1 was truant a lot," he said. "But they al
ways knew where to find me: in the library."
A love for the written word inspired Hunt
to write poetry and even invent several lan
guages as a teenager.
Hunt was introduced to archaeology when
a family friend invited him to participate in a
dig at the San Diego Museum of Man.
"That was where I first saw the disjunction
between looking at a site today and imagining
what it must have looked like 300 years ago,"
Hunt said. "And that contrast really fired up
my mind."
"1 had these wild dreams about finding
buried stuff," he added. "These were literal
dreams about a burial of a unit of Roman sol
diers in my backyard. It was so real. I would
jump out [of bed] in my bathrobe and go get a
shovel to check."
Music was another major influence in
Hunt's life, especially since his mother was a
concert pianist.
"My brothers and I ended up being an a
cappella singing group, and we did this quite a
bit around Southern California," Hunt said.
In high school, Hunt fell in love with the
music of Johann Sebastian Bach.
"It was like wax plugs fell out of my ears,"
he said. "I would lie for hours in the dark, sur
rounded by Bach [in] stereo sound, and it was
just incredible."
Hunt briefly attended a music conservato
ry, but rebelled against the compositional
rules that limited his creative freedom. Hunt
recounted a time when one of his professors
rejected a manuscript he had composed.
"He told me, 'Patrick, this is nothing but
melody!"' Hunt said. "And I just said, 'Thank
you."'
Hunt's compositions have been widely
performed by professional ensembles in the
United States and Europe.
Hunt arrived at Stanford by an unconven
tional path. After finishing his Ph.D. at the

University College London Institute of Ar
chaeology, Hunt moved to Berkeley, where he
was involved in Near Eastern studies re
search.
On a whim, Hunt wrote a letter to Stanford
asking about open positions. Religious studies
professor Lee Yearley forwarded the letter to
the head of the Classics Department. Hunt
was then invited to be a visiting lecturer, and
he has been here ever since.
"That was complete luck, that somebody
didn't put [my letter] in the trash pile," he said.
"These people [were] very open,kindhearted,
really formidable scholars."

Hunt's enthusiasm for the humanities has
also attracted attention outside academia:
PBS and The History Channel have featured
Hunt as an expert in their television docu
mentaries. Recently, Hunt was filmed in Italy
for a National Geographic special, "Iceman
Murder Mystery," which aired on Oct. 26.
Hunt also maintains an active presence
online. A few years ago, venture capitalists
encouraged him to found Electrum Maga
zine, an online publication guided by the slo
gan "Why the Past Matters." Now, his Silicon
Valley patrons are seeking to expand the
magazine.

To Hunt, new technologies like the Inter
net enhance the humanities, rather than
threatening them.
"[The Internet is] paperless, and it doesn't
provide instant gratification, but it does pro
vide instant dissemination," he said.
Throughout his life, Hunt has never been
afraid to defy convention.
"There have to be people willing to take
the boundaries out and do something inde
pendent," he said. "They have to be fearless -
or at least less fearful."
