## EDITORIAL Stanford ROTC's future and the civil-military divide 
### 
One of the main justifications
given by proponents of
ROTC's return to Stanford
was that an ROTC presence on
campus would help to bridge the
perceived divide between civilians
and the military. Notwithstanding
this aspiration, or last year's deci
sion by the Faculty Senate to invite
ROTC back to campus. University
officials now consider an ROTC re
turn unlikely in the near future. The
reasons for this are understandable
and valid; military branches simply
do not expect enough student par
ticipation in the ROTC program to
justify its cost. Fiscal responsibility
by the Pentagon, even though ex
penditure on a Stanford ROTC
program would be vanishingly
small in the context of U.S. military
spending, is something all Ameri
cans can welcome and encourage.
Nevertheless, the University's orig
inal goal of bolstering civil-military
engagement can and should push
forward through other means for
the time being. Greater participa
tion in ROTC, if it is to come, will
have to follow other measures.
Several alternatives to a full
ROTC branch have already been
floated, including Stanford-hosted
ROTC events and Stanford-locat
ed ROTC courses conducted in
partnership with other nearby uni
versities. The University is also con
sidering offering course credit for
ROTC classes. These ideas could be
complemented by courses open to
all students dealing with present is
sues facing the U.S. military. The
2011 iteration of Stanford's "Three
Books" program, which provides
three books free of charge to in
coming freshmen with opportuni
ties for discussion and access to a
panel featuring the authors, focused
this year on the theme of "war

ethics." Selection of this theme, cho
sen by political science professor
Scott Sagan, represents a good first
step in helping all students to con
sider the issue of war from many
varying perspectives.
The U.S. military, for its part,
could do more to convince students
at top universities that service
through the ROTC is an option
worthy of consideration. Other
wise, there will never be enough
cadets at places like Stanford to
make the time and energy neces
sary to build a strong presence
worthwhile. There are likely many
students who reject or do not con
sider an ROTC option simply be
cause its offerings are not a salient
or well known. This is not to en
dorse a military career above oth
ers, but merely to note that students
may be unaware of their options.

The debate over ROTC's return
last year at Stanford proved to be
one of the most divisive campus is
sues in recent memory. Some op
posed engagement with the mili
tary as a matter of principle, while
others objected on the basis of
transgender equality. With news
that the ROTC likely won't be com
ing to Stanford any time soon, some
will likely ask whether last year's
seemingly endless melodrama was
worth it. Whether or not one feels it
was, and whether or not one is
happy with the result, it was inar
guably a good opportunity for all
parties to air their opinions and par
ticipate in a rare dialogue about the
role of the military in American so
ciety and on the Stanford campus.
With nearly 3 million Americans
serving in the military, Stanford
would do well to make sure that this
dialogue and the good that can
come of it move forward in the fu
ture.
