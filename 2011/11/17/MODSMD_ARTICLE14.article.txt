# DO's AND DOO-DOO's
## How to be in a movie 
### Chase Ishii 
I recently experienced the uncom
fortable situation of being forced
to watch a below-average roman
tic comedy with a girl who had an
above-average love and enthusiasm
for below-average romantic come
dies. (I stress, it was not a date.) As
the credits rolled, she shouted, "Ah! I
wish my life were like a movie!"
Maybe it was because I'm slowly
turning into an elitist movie snob, or
maybe it's because I had just been
subjected to watching the art of cine
ma be viciously tortured onscreen
for the last 96 minutes, but my first
thought was, "No, you absolutely do
not." That brings me to today's ad
vice ...
DO: Live life like a movie,
DOO-DOO: Live life like a Life
time movie...
Everyone wants the happy movie
ending, but everyone seems to selec
tively forget the hour or two of hard

work and pain and failure that the
character endures leading up to the
resolution. For the girl to get to make
out with Ryan Gosling in the rain (or
whatever actor doing whatever ac
tion in whatever manifestation of
weather is hot stuff right now), she
has to go through the pain of being
left at the altar or cheated on by her
fiance with her mother (I swear, I
could write 50 romantic comedies in
a week).
We want the success without the

failures, the excitement without
heartbreak, results without time or
effort, self-awareness without hon
esty, redemption without humility,
adventure without commitment, dis
covery without having to forget
what we know, glory without being
the underdog, intimacy without vul
nerability and fundamental change
without admitting our failure or re
linquishing control.
But how many movies do you
know of in which the protagonist is
always happy and behaves well and
never gets in above his or her head?
Or where the team that wins the
championship doesn't have to work
hard or overcome any obstacles? Or
the guy gets the girl and the movie is
just watching them live happily ever
after?
None. (Because those movies
would suck and never get made.)

And that's because the value of the
resolution is wrapped up in the fail
ures. It's the passion and persever
ance that we admire, and that ulti
mately leads to fulfillment. It's when
the stakes get raised from mere com
fort to ultimate survival that we truly
invest in the character; when their
reward becomes our reward; when it
becomes worthwhile.
I believe our life would be more
exciting and fulfilling if it were lived
more like a movie. But it requires us
to be willing to risk everything.
There's a scene at the beginning of
the iconic 80s movie "Say Any
thing" (it's the guy-in-a-trenchcoat
holding-up-a-boombox movie)
when John Cusack's lovable char
acter responds to a friend deterring
him from chasing after a girl for fear
he'll get hurt by shouting, "I want to
get hurt!" There's "Inception," in
which Leonardo DiCaprio's char
acter is willing to risk everything for
what he values as most worthy
reunion with his children. He is will
ing to enter into an adventure
knowing he is fully committed and

can never opt out.
There are huge lessons we can
learn from the silver screen. We
need to embrace vulnerability, take
bold risks and be brutally honest
with ourselves and others. It's a
strange paradox that fictional char
acters can be more real and honest
with other fictional characters than
we can be with each other. This is
not just a Stanford thing or a college
thing; it's an everyone thing.
I think if we understood the
value in failure, we wouldn't kill
ourselves so much to avoid it. Not to
mention, there's a value in true per
severance that would never be
learned without failure. ("What do
we do when we fall off the horse? We
get back on!" "Sorry, Maury. I'm not
a gymnast." Name the Movie!)
Movie characters are able to under
go fundamental changes when they
are willing to admit their failure and
humbly start anew. They find adven
ture when they don't just accept, but

embrace their situation. They find
forgiveness and redemption when
they are willing to admit their faults,
and they find glory when they ac
knowledge their faults, yet continue
fighting.
The best characters don't make
decisions based on what is safe. They
become so enamored by a person or
goal or ideal that they are willing to
let go of everything they have to
pursue it. Nothing worth loving is
safe to love.
A truly captivating, influential
and worthwhile life story requires
risks and failures in careers, in re
lationships and in conception of the
self and the higher the stakes, the
better the story.

Have you seen the romantic comedy
in which the newspaper columnist gets
a date with a beautiful girl when she re
sponds to a piece he wrote? Chase has
n't either. You can change that with an

fiance with her mother (I swear, I
could write 50 romantic comedies in
a week).
We want the success without the

failures, the excitement without
heartbreak, results without time or
effort, self-awareness without hon
esty, redemption without humility,
adventure without commitment, dis
covery without having to forget
what we know, glory without being
the underdog, intimacy without vul
nerability and fundamental change
without admitting our failure or re
linquishing control.
But how many movies do you
know of in which the protagonist is
always happy and behaves well and
never gets in above his or her head?
Or where the team that wins the
championship doesn't have to work
hard or overcome any obstacles? Or
the guy gets the girl and the movie is
just watching them live happily ever
after?
None. (Because those movies
would suck and never get made.)

And that's because the value of the
resolution is wrapped up in the fail
ures. It's the passion and persever
ance that we admire, and that ulti
mately leads to fulfillment. It's when
the stakes get raised from mere com
fort to ultimate survival that we truly
invest in the character; when their
reward becomes our reward; when it
becomes worthwhile.
I believe our life would be more
exciting and fulfilling if it were lived
more like a movie. But it requires us
to be willing to risk everything.
There's a scene at the beginning of
the iconic 80s movie "Say Any
thing" (it's the guy-in-a-trenchcoat
holding-up-a-boombox movie)
when John Cusack's lovable char
acter responds to a friend deterring
him from chasing after a girl for fear
he'll get hurt by shouting, "I want to
get hurt!" There's "Inception," in
which Leonardo DiCaprio's char
acter is willing to risk everything for
what he values as most worthy
reunion with his children. He is will
ing to enter into an adventure
knowing he is fully committed and

can never opt out.
There are huge lessons we can
learn from the silver screen. We
need to embrace vulnerability, take
bold risks and be brutally honest
with ourselves and others. It's a
strange paradox that fictional char
acters can be more real and honest
with other fictional characters than
we can be with each other. This is
not just a Stanford thing or a college
thing; it's an everyone thing.
I think if we understood the
value in failure, we wouldn't kill
ourselves so much to avoid it. Not to
mention, there's a value in true per
severance that would never be
learned without failure. ("What do
we do when we fall off the horse? We
get back on!" "Sorry, Maury. I'm not
a gymnast." Name the Movie!)
Movie characters are able to under
go fundamental changes when they
are willing to admit their failure and
humbly start anew. They find adven
ture when they don't just accept, but

embrace their situation. They find
forgiveness and redemption when
they are willing to admit their faults,
and they find glory when they ac
knowledge their faults, yet continue
fighting.
The best characters don't make
decisions based on what is safe. They
become so enamored by a person or
goal or ideal that they are willing to
let go of everything they have to
pursue it. Nothing worth loving is
safe to love.
A truly captivating, influential
and worthwhile life story requires
risks and failures in careers, in re
lationships and in conception of the
self and the higher the stakes, the
better the story.

Have you seen the romantic comedy
in which the newspaper columnist gets
a date with a beautiful girl when she re
sponds to a piece he wrote? Chase has
n't either. You can change that with an
