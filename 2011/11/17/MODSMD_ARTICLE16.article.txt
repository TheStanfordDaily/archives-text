# DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF
## Survival of the skittish 
### Leslie Brian 
Have you ever tried to sneak
up on a wild animal? Picture
it: you're hiking in the forest
and, all of a sudden, come across a
deer. You stand stock still, trying not
to scare it off, then take a tentative
step forward. Its ears prick up, its
head lifts, somehow sensing your
presence. You pause, then inch clos
er. Closer. Then, bam! That deer
practically flies off into the trees.
That's evolution for you. In
order to survive, animals live in a
constant state of watchful appre
hensiveness. Their default state of
scanning the environment and
looking out for trouble is what kept
them alive all these years. And for a
gazelle, that underlying sense of
fear is still a pretty great adaptation
to avoid being gobbled up by a lion
while grazing in the savannah.
Fortunately, most of us no longer
have to worry about impending
doom on a daily basis unless
you're biking through the Circle of
Death. Unfortunately, that default
"survival" mentality is still in
grained. Though we aren't con
fronting "fight or flight" on a daily
basis, our wired-to-worry human
brain either creates imaginary
problems or exaggerates the ones
that actually do exist.
It's a pretty exhausting way to
live. No matter how good or bad a
given situation, our minds tend to
blow things out of proportion. But
when we really stop and examine
the actual present moment, virtual
ly all of us are okay, even though it
may not feel like it. It's only by pro
jecting into the future (i.e. worry
ing) or ruminating on the past (i.e.
regret) that we start to think we're
not. Of course, life isn't always rain
bows and sunshine, but moment-to
moment, our core needs are met.
Look around. There's no civil war
(unless you count Big Game), no
bombs going off; you're not drown
ing. Right here, right now, you are
okay.
So what can we do to fight
against a constant state of worry,
negativity and self-doubt?

As trite as it sounds, it all comes
back to the power of positive think
ing. Our brain is like a sponge for
negative thoughts. No matter how
many things go right, all of our men
tal energy fixates on one that went
wrong or could have gone better.
When I was younger, I'd judge my
entire piano recital on the one pas
sage that tripped me up. When my
mom told me to think about all the
notes I hit right, I would absolutely
fume at her. Honestly, I thought it
was a pile of coddling bullshit.
But I'm beginning to see the
logic.

We all have ownership of our
lives. That includes problems we
imagine, over-dramatize or that ac
tually exist! There are ways that we
can re-train our neural pathways to
guard against the mental wear and
tear that we too often put ourselves
through. When you feel like the
world is conspiring against you, take
a step back into the present mo
ment and acknowledge that you are
still actually okay. And allow your
self to take in what positivity you
can: maybe you're really down
about not having a boyfriend or
girlfriend, but don't just dismiss a
friendly hug simply because you see
the situation as black or white.
Blanket statement: this is much
easier said than done. How many of
us want to pull ourselves up by our
bootstraps and be glad the sun is
shining when we just bombed a
problem set, or the guy we like just
asked out another girl?
In the short run, playing the mar
tyr may seem like the more appeal
ing option. But in the long run, it's
like quicksand; it only leaves you
more mired in negativity and de
pression. Too often, we wait for
other people to save us when we're
the only ones who can choose to
change our own mindset.
That's not to say that venting is
wrong. Having emotions and need
ing to express them is part of what
makes us human. But after a certain
point, venting is only productive
when you take charge of your abili-

ty to change a given situation. And
that doesn't necessarily mean
changing a given outcome. Some
times, there is really nothing you
can do to change things. But what
you can always change is your per
spective, the lens through which you
perceive life.
I had to learn to rescue myself
from well me. I've spent far
too much time pretending every
thing is fine and then running off to
cry in the corner, hoping that some
one would miraculously swoop in
and find me. I had to learn and
am still learning! to reach out to
people and let them know I needed
help.

We all face a similar choice.
Chances are, there are things you
know will make you feel better, if
you allow yourself to feel better.
Give yourself the medicine you need
for positive thought: if you struggle
with insecurity or rejection, reach
out for friendship and love. Or, if
you've never felt like you could
stand on your own, fight for inde
pendence. It's one of the hardest
things to do because it hits at our
deepest psychological wounds, but it
is within our power. And it's some
thing that we all can do in order to
take ownership of the moment and
feel a little better. Right here. Right
now.

Is this too much Pollyanna for you?

In the short run, playing the mar
tyr may seem like the more appeal
ing option. But in the long run, it's
like quicksand; it only leaves you
more mired in negativity and de
pression. Too often, we wait for
other people to save us when we're
the only ones who can choose to
change our own mindset.
That's not to say that venting is
wrong. Having emotions and need
ing to express them is part of what
makes us human. But after a certain
point, venting is only productive
when you take charge of your abili-

ty to change a given situation. And
that doesn't necessarily mean
changing a given outcome. Some
times, there is really nothing you
can do to change things. But what
you can always change is your per
spective, the lens through which you
perceive life.
I had to learn to rescue myself
from well me. I've spent far
too much time pretending every
thing is fine and then running off to
cry in the corner, hoping that some
one would miraculously swoop in
and find me. I had to learn and
am still learning! to reach out to
people and let them know I needed
help.

We all face a similar choice.
Chances are, there are things you
know will make you feel better, if
you allow yourself to feel better.
Give yourself the medicine you need
for positive thought: if you struggle
with insecurity or rejection, reach
out for friendship and love. Or, if
you've never felt like you could
stand on your own, fight for inde
pendence. It's one of the hardest
things to do because it hits at our
deepest psychological wounds, but it
is within our power. And it's some
thing that we all can do in order to
take ownership of the moment and
feel a little better. Right here. Right
now.

Is this too much Pollyanna for you?

Have you ever tried to sneak
up on a wild animal? Picture
it: you're hiking in the forest
and, all of a sudden, come across a
deer. You stand stock still, trying not
to scare it off, then take a tentative
step forward. Its ears prick up, its
head lifts, somehow sensing your
presence. You pause, then inch clos
er. Closer. Then, bam! That deer
practically flies off into the trees.
That's evolution for you. In
order to survive, animals live in a
constant state of watchful appre
hensiveness. Their default state of
scanning the environment and
looking out for trouble is what kept
them alive all these years. And for a
gazelle, that underlying sense of
fear is still a pretty great adaptation
to avoid being gobbled up by a lion
while grazing in the savannah.
Fortunately, most of us no longer
have to worry about impending
doom on a daily basis unless
you're biking through the Circle of
Death. Unfortunately, that default
"survival" mentality is still in
grained. Though we aren't con
fronting "fight or flight" on a daily
basis, our wired-to-worry human
brain either creates imaginary
problems or exaggerates the ones
that actually do exist.
It's a pretty exhausting way to
live. No matter how good or bad a
given situation, our minds tend to
blow things out of proportion. But
when we really stop and examine
the actual present moment, virtual
ly all of us are okay, even though it
may not feel like it. It's only by pro
jecting into the future (i.e. worry
ing) or ruminating on the past (i.e.
regret) that we start to think we're
not. Of course, life isn't always rain
bows and sunshine, but moment-to
moment, our core needs are met.
Look around. There's no civil war
(unless you count Big Game), no
bombs going off; you're not drown
ing. Right here, right now, you are
okay.
So what can we do to fight
against a constant state of worry,
negativity and self-doubt?

As trite as it sounds, it all comes
back to the power of positive think
ing. Our brain is like a sponge for
negative thoughts. No matter how
many things go right, all of our men
tal energy fixates on one that went
wrong or could have gone better.
When I was younger, I'd judge my
entire piano recital on the one pas
sage that tripped me up. When my
mom told me to think about all the
notes I hit right, I would absolutely
fume at her. Honestly, I thought it
was a pile of coddling bullshit.
But I'm beginning to see the
logic.

We all have ownership of our
lives. That includes problems we
imagine, over-dramatize or that ac
tually exist! There are ways that we
can re-train our neural pathways to
guard against the mental wear and
tear that we too often put ourselves
through. When you feel like the
world is conspiring against you, take
a step back into the present mo
ment and acknowledge that you are
still actually okay. And allow your
self to take in what positivity you
can: maybe you're really down
about not having a boyfriend or
girlfriend, but don't just dismiss a
friendly hug simply because you see
the situation as black or white.
Blanket statement: this is much
easier said than done. How many of
us want to pull ourselves up by our
bootstraps and be glad the sun is
shining when we just bombed a
problem set, or the guy we like just
asked out another girl?
