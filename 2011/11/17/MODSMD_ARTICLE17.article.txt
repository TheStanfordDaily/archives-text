### ANDERS MIKKELSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fresh off last weekend's disappointing
loss to Washington, the Stanford women's
volleyball team heads home for a pair of
must-win matches against Oregon and Ore

with just three games to play and needs to
win out to have any hope of competing for
the Pac-12 title.
First up, No. 5 Stanford (20-5,14-5 Pac
-12) faces a tough test in No. 15 Oregon (18-
8,11-7). The Ducks are currently tied with

two-and-a-half games back from fourth
place Stanford. A victory this Friday over
the Card would make a huge statement and

GAME NOTES: After a loss at Washington last
weekend, Stanford needs to win out if it would like to
capture the conference title for the first time since
2009, which came at the tail end of a four-year Pac
-10 championship streak.

secure a Pac-12 title. The Cardinal will need to win out to even have a shot at tying first-place USC.
