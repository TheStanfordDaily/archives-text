## STILL HOPE 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fresh off last weekend's disappointing
loss to Washington, the Stanford women's
volleyball team heads home for a pair of
must-win matches against Oregon and Ore
gon State. The Cardinal currently sits three
games back of conference-leading USC
with just three games to play and needs to
win out to have any hope of competing for
the Pac-12 title.
First up, No. 5 Stanford (20-5,14-5 Pac
-12) faces a tough test in No. 15 Oregon (18-
8,11-7). The Ducks are currently tied with
Washington for fifth in the conference, just
two-and-a-half games back from fourth
place Stanford. A victory this Friday over
the Card would make a huge statement and

GAME NOTES: After a loss at Washington last
weekend, Stanford needs to win out if it would like to
capture the conference title for the first time since
2009, which came at the tail end of a four-year Pac
-10 championship streak.

It's desperation time for sophomore defensive specialist Mary Ellen Luck and Stanford if they want to
secure a Pac-12 title. The Cardinal will need to win out to even have a shot at tying first-place USC.
help propel Oregon into the Pac-12
elite. The last meeting between the
two teams resulted in a 3-1 Stanford
victory at Oregon, and Stanford
would like to replicate the feat in
front of its home crowd.
The key to victory for the Cardi
nal will be containing the powerful
Duck offense. The Ducks rank be
hind just conference-leading USC
in both kills and assists, riding one
of the strongest outsider hitter-set
ter combos in the league. Redshirt
junior outside hitter Alaina Bergs
ma is second in the conference with
4.61 kills per set, while sophomore
setter Lauren Plum ranks second in
the Pac-12 with 11.77 assists per set.
In the last meeting between the two
teams, Bergsma lit up the Cardinal
defense for a match-high 26 kills,
while Plum posted a double-double
with 47 assists and 17 digs. Keeping
this dynamic duo in check will in
strumental for a Stanford victory.
On Sunday, Stanford will face
Oregon State (14-14, 6-12). In the
last meeting between the two
teams, Oregon State managed to
take a set from the Cardinal before
falling 3-1. The Beavers enter the
rematch on a four-match losing
streak and currently sit in eighth
place in the conference, but a victo

ry over Stanford would help build
confidence for a young team that
could be carried into next year. The
Beavers have eight freshmen on the
roster, including two-time Pac-12
Freshman of the Week middle
blocker Arica Nassar, and expect to
compete on a higher level as they
gain more experience.
The Beaver offense is led by jun
ior outside hitter Camille Saxton,
who ranks in the top-10 in the Pac
-12 in kills, points and aces per set. In
the last meeting between the two
teams, Saxton posted a double-dou
ble of 22 kills and 12 digs, as well as
two service aces. On defense, Ore
gon State is anchored by sopho
more libero Becky Defoe, who
ranks fifth in the Pac-12 with 4.65
digs per set.
If either Oregon or Oregon
State is going to make a statement,
they would have to get past the ter
rific Stanford trio of sophomore
outside hitter Rachel Williams, jun
ior setter Karissa Cook and sopho
more middle blocker Carly Wopat.
Williams and Cook are currently
tied for the Pac-12 lead in double
doubles, while Wopat leads the con
ference in blocks per set, with 1.57.
The series kicks off at Maples
Pavilion at 7 p.m. on Thursday
against Oregon, and then continues
at 1 p.m. Sunday afternoon against
Oregon State.
