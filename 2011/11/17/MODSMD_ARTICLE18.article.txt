# Spelling out our shot at redemption
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
Well, that stunk. It turns
out that the West
Coast version of the
"Game of the Centu
ry" didn't turn out ex
actly the way we planned it, either.
On the whole, there just aren't many
good things to reflect on after the Car
dinal football team fell flat on its face on
Saturday. But now that I'm past the
shock/denial/pain/guilt/bargaining/de
pression phase of that game, it's worth
mulling over a few things before we
fully move on to Big Game and those
loathsome Cal Bears.
This week, I've given you a random
smattering of things that stuck out to
me this weekend, one for every letter of
STANFORD. Just as my colleague
Jacob Jaffe takes on the numerical side
of things in his "Stat on the Back" col
umn, I'll take on the alphabetical side of
things. Let's get started, shall we?
S is for "Sky is falling." As in, it is not.
Yes, I know that loss was brutal. But
with two victories over Cal and Notre
Dame, Stanford is pretty much assured
of going to a BCS bowl. And even
though the Fiesta Bowl and Phoenix
are less fun than the National Champi
onship and New Orleans, remember
that two BCS bowls in two years is
about all a fan could ask for. (That fact
was the only thing that kept me out of
the bottom of a big, noxious bottle this
past Saturday night.)
T is for The Heisman Trust. "Andrew
Luck, Superstar" struggled to keep the
offense in a groove this weekend, and
there's reason to believe that his flat per
formance on the biggest stage of the year
may have cost him his chance at the tro
phy. His performance wasn't exactly
what Cardinal fans hoped for,but I don't
think his chances are up in smoke yet.
His main competitor, Oklahoma State
senior quarterback Brandon Weeden,
still has a major test against Oklahoma
coming up in two weeks, which means
it's far too early to count the neck-beard
out. (As an interesting side-note. Luck's
completion percentage, QB rating and
passing yards per attempt are all down
slightly this year. Seems crazy to think
that his stats were better last year, right?)
A is for Aquatic misadventures. For
some reason, the slick turf was a game
changer for the Cardinal, which had se
rious trouble staying upright on Satur
day. This particularly seemed to afflict
Levine Toilolo, whose legs mysterious
ly flipped out from under him every
time the football touched his fingertips,
much like the famous "fainting goats"
that fall over whenever they are star
tled. Did they forget to turn the sprin
klers off the night before the game?
More importantly, why did the water
seem to only affect the Stanford play

ers? I bet Phil Knight has a hand in the
Ducks' near-perfect traction...
N is for No more field goals, please.
Eric Whitaker's 48-yard field goal at
tempt in the third quarter was easily 25
yards wide of the target you could
hear everyone in the stadium thinking
to themselves, "Juuust a bit outside"
which gave an otherwise awful kick a
little sense of levity.
F is for Field goals, again. All jokes
aside, what was head coach David
Shaw thinking when he decided to kick
that field goal? Earlier in the week,
Shaw said that "time of possession plus
touchdowns" is what you needed to
beat Oregon. And then he elects to at
tempt a low-percentage kick after Ore
gon got a touchdown on a fourth down
earlier in the game? Something ain't
right with that.
O is for Offensive records. With just
four more touchdown passes, Andrew
Luck (74) will pass John Elway (77) for
the most touchdown tosses in Stanford
history and set a new single-season
record for most touchdown passes. Just
something to consider these next two
weeks will the Cardinal throw more
often in the red zone in order to etch
Luck's name a little deeper into the

record book and bolster his Heisman
campaign? Stay tuned.
R is for Rebound. This weekend
against Cal, Andrew Luck will be trying
to rebound from a loss for just the sixth
time in his career. In his time on the
Farm, Luck is 4-1 when coming off a
loss. If this pattern holds true, it looks
like the Bears might be in for a long
night on Saturday.
D is for Defensive showdown. In
years past, Cal has always had a major
offensive threat Aaron Rodgers,
DeSean Jackson, Jahvid Best but
this year, the Bears have a "no-name"
defense that has put up the best stats in
the conference. Cal is first in the Pac-12
in total defense and pass defense, allow
ing fewer than 200 yards per game
through the air. Does this spell trouble
for the Cardinal again this weekend? I
sure hope not I don't think 1 can
take another weekend like the last one.
