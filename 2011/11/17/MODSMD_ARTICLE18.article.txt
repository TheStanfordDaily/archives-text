# Spelling out our shot at redemption

Well, that stunk. It turns
out that the West
Coast version of the
"Game of the Centu
ry" didn't turn out ex
actly the way we planned it, either.
On the whole, there just aren't many
good things to reflect on after the Car
dinal football team fell flat on its face on
Saturday. But now that I'm past the
shock/denial/pain/guilt/bargaining/de
pression phase of that game, it's worth
mulling over a few things before we
fully move on to Big Game and those
loathsome Cal Bears.
This week, I've given you a random
smattering of things that stuck out to
me this weekend, one for every letter of
STANFORD. Just as my colleague
Jacob Jaffe takes on the numerical side
of things in his "Stat on the Back" col
umn, I'll take on the alphabetical side of
things. Let's get started, shall we?
S is for "Sky is falling." As in, it is not.
Yes, I know that loss was brutal. But
with two victories over Cal and Notre
Dame, Stanford is pretty much assured
of going to a BCS bowl. And even
though the Fiesta Bowl and Phoenix
are less fun than the National Champi
onship and New Orleans, remember
that two BCS bowls in two years is
about all a fan could ask for. (That fact
was the only thing that kept me out of
the bottom of a big, noxious bottle this
past Saturday night.)
T is for The Heisman Trust. "Andrew
Luck, Superstar" struggled to keep the
offense in a groove this weekend, and
there's reason to believe that his flat per
formance on the biggest stage of the year
may have cost him his chance at the tro
phy. His performance wasn't exactly
what Cardinal fans hoped for,but I don't
