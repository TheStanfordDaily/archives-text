# GOING BOWLING
## Predicting postseason scenarios 
### JOSEPH BAYDA DESK EDITOR 
Stanford fans: we've had our four days to mope,
weep, cry, scream, whatever. Now it's time to take
a realistic look at where Stanford is going to be
headed this postseason.
Above all, try and think back to just three years ago, when
the Cardinal faithful was thrilled to be headed anywhere in
late December or early January. But believe it or not, an elite
bowl bid is much more likely than your gut might have told
you on Saturday night. Let's start at the top, then:
Bowl: BCS National Championship Game, Jan. 9, New
Orleans
Chance of a Stanford bid: 0.1 %
How: First of all, whatever anyone in the media is saying.
Stanford does have a chance of ending up in the national title
game. There are three undefeated teams (No. ILSU, No. 2
Oklahoma State and No. 11 Houston) left in the country, and
eight one-loss schools in the top 10 that have a shot at threat
ening No. 9 Stanford in the standings. Assuming LSU by
overwhelming consensus the best team in the country
wins out, the seven other teams ahead of the Cardinal will
have to end the season with two losses to guarantee Stanford
a spot.
With a win against overrated Notre Dame, Stanford
would pass No. 8 Virginia Tech by the end of the season. As
for the rest of the top-10 schools, the most likely scenario re
quires seven games to go in Stanford's favor: one of them

highly likely (No. 6 Arkansas loses to LfsU), two of them
somewhat likely (No. 7 Clemson loses to No. 12 South Car
olina, Oklahoma State loses to No. 5 Oklahoma), three of
them somewhat unlikely (Oklahoma loses to No. 22 Baylor,
No. 4 Oregon loses to USC or in the Pac-12 title game, No. 3
Alabama loses to No. 24 Auburn) and one of them basically
impossible (Oklahoma State loses to 5-4 lowa State).
Gulp.
Bowl: Rose Bowl, Jan. 2, Pasadena, Calif.
Chance of a Stanford bid: 9.9%
How: Have faith, Stanford fans. The Cardinal's easiest
route to Pasadena finishing undefeated in conference
play may be gone, but there are two highly plausible sce
narios that would land Stanford in "The Granddaddy of
Them All," both of which require just one major upset. If
Oregon loses to USC which is unranked due to sanctions
but has been playing like a top-15 team and then falls to
Oregon State in a rivalry game (which is always unpre
dictable), then the Cardinal would regain its North Division
bid to the Pac-12 Championship Game and would be one
win away from the Rose Bowl. Alternately, if Oregon wins
out, Oklahoma State loses to Oklahoma and Alabama falls
to Auburn, Oregon would be vaulted to the national title
game and the Rose Bowl would, in all likelihood, replace the
Ducks with Stanford.
In other words, if Oregon wins out or loses twice, the Car
dinal has a fighting chance. But if the Ducks only lose once,
Stanford is out of luck.

If Andrew Luck and the Cardinal can win against California and Notre Dame, they will have a great shot at ending
up with an at-large bid in another BCS bowl game after winning the Orange Bowl in Miami on Jan. 3.
