# GOING BOWLING
## Predicting postseason scenarios 
### JOSEPH BAYDA DESK EDITOR 
Stanford fans: we've had our four days to mope,
weep, cry, scream, whatever. Now it's time to take
a realistic look at where Stanford is going to be
headed this postseason.
Above all, try and think back to just three years ago, when
the Cardinal faithful was thrilled to be headed anywhere in
late December or early January. But believe it or not, an elite
bowl bid is much more likely than your gut might have told
you on Saturday night. Let's start at the top, then:
Bowl: BCS National Championship Game, Jan. 9, New
Orleans
Chance of a Stanford bid: 0.1 %
How: First of all, whatever anyone in the media is saying.
Stanford does have a chance of ending up in the national title
game. There are three undefeated teams (No. ILSU, No. 2
Oklahoma State and No. 11 Houston) left in the country, and
eight one-loss schools in the top 10 that have a shot at threat
ening No. 9 Stanford in the standings. Assuming LSU by
overwhelming consensus the best team in the country
wins out, the seven other teams ahead of the Cardinal will
have to end the season with two losses to guarantee Stanford
a spot.
With a win against overrated Notre Dame, Stanford
would pass No. 8 Virginia Tech by the end of the season. As
for the rest of the top-10 schools, the most likely scenario re
quires seven games to go in Stanford's favor: one of them

highly likely (No. 6 Arkansas loses to LfsU), two of them
somewhat likely (No. 7 Clemson loses to No. 12 South Car
olina, Oklahoma State loses to No. 5 Oklahoma), three of
them somewhat unlikely (Oklahoma loses to No. 22 Baylor,
No. 4 Oregon loses to USC or in the Pac-12 title game, No. 3
Alabama loses to No. 24 Auburn) and one of them basically
impossible (Oklahoma State loses to 5-4 lowa State).
Gulp.
Bowl: Rose Bowl, Jan. 2, Pasadena, Calif.
Chance of a Stanford bid: 9.9%
How: Have faith, Stanford fans. The Cardinal's easiest
route to Pasadena finishing undefeated in conference
play may be gone, but there are two highly plausible sce
narios that would land Stanford in "The Granddaddy of
Them All," both of which require just one major upset. If
Oregon loses to USC which is unranked due to sanctions
but has been playing like a top-15 team and then falls to
Oregon State in a rivalry game (which is always unpre
dictable), then the Cardinal would regain its North Division
bid to the Pac-12 Championship Game and would be one
win away from the Rose Bowl. Alternately, if Oregon wins
out, Oklahoma State loses to Oklahoma and Alabama falls
to Auburn, Oregon would be vaulted to the national title
game and the Rose Bowl would, in all likelihood, replace the
Ducks with Stanford.
In other words, if Oregon wins out or loses twice, the Car
dinal has a fighting chance. But if the Ducks only lose once,
Stanford is out of luck.


MICHAEL LIU/The Stanford Daily
If Andrew Luck and the Cardinal can win against California and Notre Dame, they will have a great shot at ending
up with an at-large bid in another BCS bowl game after winning the Orange Bowl in Miami on Jan. 3.
Bowl: Fiesta Bowl, Jan. 2, Glendale,
Ariz.
Chance of a Stanford bid: 60%
How: Don't book your flights yet,
but I hear Arizona is pretty nice in early
January.
This is where things get confusing, all

you BCS newcomers. The four BCS
bowls besides the title game Rose, Fi
esta, Orange and Sugarâ€”will always
include the conference champions of
the one (or, in the Rose Bowl's case,
two) conference(s) traditionally associ
ated with that bowl, unless that team is in
the title game, in which case the next
best team in the conference is usually se
lected (with some exceptions) if, and
only if that team has enough wins and a
strong enough ranking to be eligible for
an at-large bid. In other words, after all is
said and done, there will be at least three
at-large bids available after the dust set
tles: one each in the Fiesta, Orange and
Sugar.
Assuming everyone holds serve in
the top 10 and no upsets benefit Stan
ford, the Cardinal will finish No. 6
overall, since Oklahoma State-Okla
homa, LSU-Arkansas and Clemson-
Virginia Tech will all play each other
in either regular-season or confer
ence-championship settings. Four of
five teams ahead of Stanford will each
receive automatic bids, Alabama is
bound to replace SEC-champion
LSU in the Sugar Bowl, and the Fies
ta Bowl will likely replace Big-12-

champion Oklahoma State with Ok
lahoma. In other words, Stanford will
be the top at-large team available
when all the traditional conference
roles have been filled.
This year, the Fiesta Bowl gets to
choose from the at-large teams before
the Sugar or Orange, which is why
Stanford is almost certainly going to
end up in Glendale if it doesn't make it
to the title game or Rose Bowl. This
would set up a rematch of the 2009 Sun
Bowl, which the Sooners won 31-27.
Bowl: Sugar Bowl, Jan. 3, New Or
leans
Chance of a Stanford bid: 10%
How: If the Fiesta Bowl decides to
pass on the Card.
Bowl: Orange Bowl, Jan. 4, Miami
Chance of a Stanford bid: 5 %
How: If the Sugar Bowl decides to
pass on the Card. Virginia Tech can
knock off Clemson in the ACC title
game to set up a rematch of Stanford's
40-12 win in Miami last season.
Bowl: Alamo Bowl, Dec. 29, San
Antonio
Chance of a Stanford bid: 15 %
How: There is one other scenario
that we've been carefully trying to push
aside. All the above bowl possibilities
assume the Cardinal wins out, but if
Stanford loses against either Cal or
Notre Dame or, God forbid, both
then an at-large BCS bid is pretty
much out of the question.
Even if the Cardinal ends the sea
son with three straight losses, it would
still finish with more wins than any Pac
-12 team besides Oregon or USC
which, remember, is excluded from
postseason play this year due to
NCAA sanctions. Thus, Stanford
would be dropped into the best avail
able bowl associated with the Pac-12:
the Alamo Bowl.
And, those, my friends, are the six
possible destinations for Stanford this
winter. The Oregon loss put a big
damper on the top of this list, but it's
not too shabby nonetheless.

Joseph Beyda hasn't slept since
Sunday after spending the last 72
hours deleting videos of "The Play "on
his Facebook wall posted by his Cal
"friends" in anticipation of Big Game.
Cheer him up with videos of Stan
ford's 56 wins in the series at
jbeyda@stanford. edu.

If Oregon wins out
or loses twice,
Stanford has a
fighting chance
[to go to the
Rose Bowl].
