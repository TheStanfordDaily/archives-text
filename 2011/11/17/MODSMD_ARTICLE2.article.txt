## Vaden reports positive reviews Tepper discusses student view of misdiagnoses 
### ILEAN A NAJARRO 
Vaden Health Center administra
tors said that the majority of its pa
tient satisfaction surveys result in pos
itive feedback; however, student re
sponse to the health center remains
mixed.
In spite of Vaden's survey results,
where were described by medical di
rector Robyn Tepper, some students
who spoke to The Daily said they as
sociate dissatisfaction with, and some

times a sense of stigma, surrounding
the services Vaden offers. Others stu
dents felt positively about their expe
riences at Vaden.
For Matt Hoang 'l4, students' neg
ative perceptions of Vaden may be a
result of students failing to under
stand and appreciate the health cen
ter's limitations.
"They're what you would expect
from student services," Hoang said.
"They're not very personal or engag
ing they're just doing their jobs."
Students "kind of go in with ...
low expectations of Vaden, and that's
kind of how I felt freshman year," said
Danielle Rossoni 'l3, a Peer Health
Educator (PHE) in Faisan. "But for

me, going through the PHE experi
ence and being more involved with
Vaden and actually knowing the re
sources and what's available there, I
have a different perspective on it
now."
John Lassere 'l2 also responded
positively when asked about his expe
riences at Vaden.
"For people who come from con
texts where we have good insurance,
some may not realize that Vaden is
pretty good medical care that sees you
pretty quickly and can really kind of
take care of quite a lot for you,"
Lassere said.

The most common medical services students use at Vaden Health Center include those for physical injuries, STI
screening, contraception, skin problems, fatigue, allergies, stomach problems, eating disorders and asthma.
According to Tepper, the most
commonly used medical services
among students are services for res
piratory illnesses, physical injuries,
STI screening, contraception, skin
problems, fatigue, allergies, stom
ach problems, eating disorders and
asthma.

According to Tepper, Vaden fol
lows the average schedule for most
student health centers, which is
three students per hour. Routine
appointments typically last 20 min
utes with five minutes for medical
assistants to situate patients and
perform standard procedures, like
taking blood pressure or tempera
ture. There are also 40-minute ap
pointments for women's health
exams and some physicals. These
time frames, however, are not set in
stone.
"If a student is particularly ill, we
can keep them at Vaden for the en
tire day if we need to give them in
travenous fluids or other support
ive treatments," Tepper said. "We
try our best to see students the same
day if possible."
While some students have ex
pressed concerns about misdiag
noses, Tepper said that Vaden has a
way of handling such concerns
when they occur.
"True misdiagnoses are not very
common, but 'perceived' misdiag
noses happen more frequently,"
Tepper said.
Tepper stated that a common
perceived misdiagnosis occurs
when students come to Vaden with
a sore throat or fever. In response,
Vaden will initially screen for strep
throat, as it is a treatable illness. If
the test is negative and symptoms
persist, students will return to
Vaden and be tested for another ill
ness like mononucleosis. If the test
for mononucleosis returns positive,
Tepper indicated that the situation
may appear as a misdiagnosis.
"If the strep screen is negative

and the student continues to be ill,
we will screen for mono, not be
cause we can cure it, but because
they may be sick for a long time and
need support," Tepper said. "So
some may see this as a misdiagnosis
... but it is routine medical prac
tice."
Lassere said he felt student per
spectives on Vaden as a whole are
fairly positive, but students seem to
consider Vaden as formed by two
entities: Vaden as a medical service
and Vaden as Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS).
Lassere said he believes that stu
dents recognize Vaden medical
services as "essential," but that
some students associate some stig
ma with CAPS.
"There is still kind of that stigma
about therapy," Lassere said.
"Something I've been seeing with
my friends ... is kind of a view of
therapy as indicative as something
wrong with you which is totally
not true,"
Despite some student dissatis
faction with Vaden, Tepper indicat
ed she and the director of CAPS are
constantly and closely working on a
quality program that includes digi
tal appointment monitoring and
oversees numerous details, includ
ing reviews by students treated in
the Stanford emergency depart
ment.
"We work hard to insure that
our delivery of care meets and ex
ceeds accepted clinical guidelines,"
Tepper said.

The most common medical services students use at Vaden Health Center include those for physical injuries, STI
screening, contraception, skin problems, fatigue, allergies, stomach problems, eating disorders and asthma.
According to Tepper, the most
commonly used medical services
among students are services for res
piratory illnesses, physical injuries,
STI screening, contraception, skin
problems, fatigue, allergies, stom
ach problems, eating disorders and
asthma.

According to Tepper, Vaden fol
lows the average schedule for most
student health centers, which is
three students per hour. Routine
appointments typically last 20 min
utes with five minutes for medical
assistants to situate patients and
perform standard procedures, like
taking blood pressure or tempera
ture. There are also 40-minute ap
pointments for women's health
exams and some physicals. These
time frames, however, are not set in
stone.
"If a student is particularly ill, we
can keep them at Vaden for the en
tire day if we need to give them in
travenous fluids or other support
ive treatments," Tepper said. "We
try our best to see students the same
day if possible."
While some students have ex
pressed concerns about misdiag
noses, Tepper said that Vaden has a
way of handling such concerns
when they occur.
"True misdiagnoses are not very
common, but 'perceived' misdiag
noses happen more frequently,"
Tepper said.
Tepper stated that a common
perceived misdiagnosis occurs
when students come to Vaden with
a sore throat or fever. In response,
Vaden will initially screen for strep
throat, as it is a treatable illness. If
the test is negative and symptoms
persist, students will return to
Vaden and be tested for another ill
ness like mononucleosis. If the test
for mononucleosis returns positive,
Tepper indicated that the situation
may appear as a misdiagnosis.
"If the strep screen is negative

and the student continues to be ill,
we will screen for mono, not be
cause we can cure it, but because
they may be sick for a long time and
need support," Tepper said. "So
some may see this as a misdiagnosis
... but it is routine medical prac
tice."
Lassere said he felt student per
spectives on Vaden as a whole are
fairly positive, but students seem to
consider Vaden as formed by two
entities: Vaden as a medical service
and Vaden as Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS).
Lassere said he believes that stu
dents recognize Vaden medical
services as "essential," but that
some students associate some stig
ma with CAPS.
"There is still kind of that stigma
about therapy," Lassere said.
"Something I've been seeing with
my friends ... is kind of a view of
therapy as indicative as something
wrong with you which is totally
not true,"
Despite some student dissatis
faction with Vaden, Tepper indicat
ed she and the director of CAPS are
constantly and closely working on a
quality program that includes digi
tal appointment monitoring and
oversees numerous details, includ
ing reviews by students treated in
the Stanford emergency depart
ment.
"We work hard to insure that
our delivery of care meets and ex
ceeds accepted clinical guidelines,"
Tepper said.
