## Vaden reports positive reviews Tepper discusses student view of misdiagnoses 
### ILEAN A NAJARRO 
Vaden Health Center administra
tors said that the majority of its pa
tient satisfaction surveys result in pos
itive feedback; however, student re
sponse to the health center remains
mixed.
In spite of Vaden's survey results,
where were described by medical di
rector Robyn Tepper, some students
who spoke to The Daily said they as
sociate dissatisfaction with, and some

times a sense of stigma, surrounding
the services Vaden offers. Others stu
dents felt positively about their expe
riences at Vaden.
For Matt Hoang 'l4, students' neg
ative perceptions of Vaden may be a
result of students failing to under
stand and appreciate the health cen
ter's limitations.
"They're what you would expect
from student services," Hoang said.
"They're not very personal or engag
ing they're just doing their jobs."
Students "kind of go in with ...
low expectations of Vaden, and that's
kind of how I felt freshman year," said
Danielle Rossoni 'l3, a Peer Health
Educator (PHE) in Faisan. "But for

me, going through the PHE experi
ence and being more involved with
Vaden and actually knowing the re
sources and what's available there, I
have a different perspective on it
now."
John Lassere 'l2 also responded
positively when asked about his expe
riences at Vaden.
"For people who come from con
texts where we have good insurance,
some may not realize that Vaden is
pretty good medical care that sees you
pretty quickly and can really kind of
take care of quite a lot for you,"
Lassere said.
