# SPLASH AWAITS
## CARD CAN TIE CAL FOR SECOND IN CONFERENCE 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's water
polo team will take on rival Cali
fornia in the annual Big Splash this
Saturday at 5:15 p.m. Both teams
are looking to improve on their

Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion (MPSF) Tournament seeding
and bolster their chances of receiv
ing the NCAA Championship's at
large bid.
Saturday's game is the regular
season finale for both teams, and
there are postseason implications

galore. No. 3 Cal (19-3,6-1 MPSF) is
currently second in the conference
while Stanford (18-4,5-2) is fourth,
with the final regular season stand
ings determining the seeding for the
MPSF Tournament.

Redshirt senior driver Ryan Kent has seen three Stanford wins in the Big Splash over his career. This year's
showdown with Cal is as important as ever and will put the winner in a good position for an at-large NCAA bid.
Although the top four teams
have beaten each other all year
long, current conference leader
USC (19-2,7-0) has emerged as the
clear favorite to repeat as MPSF
and NCAA champion. The Trojans
have a crucial season finale as well,
against co-No. 1 UCLA (19-3,5-1),
which is currently tied with Cal for
second in the MPSF.
If USC wins that game and
Stanford beats Cal, there will be a
three-way tie for second place in
the MPSF, with goal differential
being the tiebreaker. The three
second-place teams would also be
the frontrunners for the at-large
bid to the four-team NCAA Tour
nament, should none of them win
the MPSF Tournament and take
the automatic bid that accompa
nies the trophy.
"USC is the favorite," said sen
ior utility Peter Sefton, "but if they
win the MPSF tournament, the at
large bid is up for grabs."
A Stanford win in the Big
Splash and a trip to the MPSF Fi

nals would make the Cardinal the
most logical choice for the at-large
bid to NCAAs, but that is much
easier said than done. Senior driv
er Alex Avery knows from experi
ence how hard it is to win the eight
team MPSF Tournament, where
last year Stanford fell short in the
finals against the Trojans.
"You are pretty much guaran
teed to have three tough games be
cause all eight teams are good this
year," Avery said.
In fact, the nine teams in the
MPSF are currently ranked No. 1
to No. 9 nationally.
Winning the Big Splash will be
no easy task, either. Stanford's
Avery Aquatic Center will surely
be sold out, as fans from both
teams are eager to see this season's
rubber match. Stanford and Cal
have already met twice this season,
both times in early non-conference
tournaments. California took the
first meeting 8-7 in the third-place
game of the NorCal Invitational.
Stanford avenged that loss two
weeks later in a 10-9 overtime bat
tle to win the SoCal Tournament
championship.
With both earlier meetings
being so close, neither team seems
to have a real edge going into this

weekend. Stanford hopes that re
cent history does not repeat itself,
however; the Cardinal had also
split its first two meetings of the
season with USC at those same
tournaments, but the Trojans easily
handled Stanford 8-4 in their con
ference meeting last month.
The Big Splash looks to be a bat
tle of strengths, with the Bears' po
tent offense going up against the
stingy Stanford defense. California
sits atop the MPSF in offense, aver
aging 12.5 goals a game, while Stan
ford's defense in second in the
league, allowing only 5.41 goals per
game.
Saturday's contest may well
come down to which team's go-to
scorer can have the bigger impact.
Cal senior driver Ivan Rackov is
the MPSF's leading scorer with
2.95 goals per game (62 overall).
Stanford true freshman Alex
Bowen is not far behind him, aver
aging 2.52 goals per game (53
total) and ranking third in the
league.
Stanford hosts the Bears at
Avery Aquatic Center at 5:15 p.m.
Saturday night.
