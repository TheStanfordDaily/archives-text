# MEN'S SOCCER
## Missed chances define campaign SIMON ERA ENDS POORLY 
### ByTORSTEIN HOSET CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After an action-packed couple of
weeks that saw the Stanford men's
soccer team dismantle and blow out a
ranked opponent, lose heavily to the
conference champions on Senior
Day and shut out and dominate its
fiercest rivals on the road in the last
game of the season all before its
coach of 11 years resigned the
Cardinal now goes into hibernation
for the winter. That's not to say that
the players will be slacking off; but
after an intense (albeit shortened)
season, it's time to take a little break,
eat some turkey and ace those finals.
The Cardinal got off to a slow
start in the opening stages of the sea
son back in late August and early
September. After dropping the sea
son opener to Santa Clara, the team
lost back-to-back road games on the
East Coast against current No. 5
Maryland and Georgetown. The sub
sequent five games were played at
home in Laird Q. Cagan Stadium,
where the Cardinal notched convinc
ing wins against then-No. 15 Ken
tucky and Vermont as well as a sa
vory shutout of Harvard, which came
in front of an elated sell-out crowd of
nearly 2,000 during New Student
Orientation week.
These triumphs were, however,
disrupted by a surprising loss to
Lehigh and a close match against San
Francisco that ended in a draw.
Sitting with a mediocre 3-4-1
record at the halfway point of the
season, having trouble finding the
back of the net on the road and per
forming below the lofty standard
fans have come to expect of Stan
ford's athletic teams, the Cardinal
was certainly not looking like the
contender for an NCAA Tourna
ment berth that it hoped to be. Junior
defender Hunter Gorskie admits
that the team had mixed feelings
going into the second half of the sea
son.
"Thinking back, you're 3-4-1 out
of the conference, which isn't ideal;
you want to have a winning record
going into conference play," Gorskie
said. "But we were coming off two
great wins against Vermont and Har

vard, teams we had gone down to
away last year. Those are matches
that feel really good to win for re
demption reasons, and they boost
morale, so we were pretty confident
going into the SoCal games."
So the Card traveled south riding
a high wave of confidence and mo
mentum that naturally ensues from
back-to-back victories at home.
Ranked opponents UCLA and San
Diego State proved tough competi
tion, though, as the Cardinal was shut
out in both games and blanked on the
road yet again.
Gorskie underlines that the team
wasn't wasting too much energy on
the goal drought, however.
"We didn't really think about it,"
he said. "We were just going out and
trying to play well, and it just wasn't
working for us for a while. We were
playing well, though, and knew that
the goals would come."
Broken and beaten, the team re
turned to Stanford for games against
Cal, Washington and Oregon State. A
stellar free kick from junior forward
Adam Jahn was enough to seal a
close 1-1 draw against the arch-rival
Bears, and the Cardinal picked up a
split while hosting teams from the
Northwest the Huskies proved
too fierce while the Beavers got their
teeth kicked in.
A road trip up the Pacific Coast
for rematches the subsequent week
end would yield little in terms of
points, as the Cardinal was swept and
any postseason aspirations were
shattered. But a small light at the end
of the tunnel could be found in Taylor
Amman's goal against the Huskies
the Card's first away goal of the
season which set up an interesting
backdrop for the season's last away
game at Berkeley.
The Cardinal then turned its at
tention to seeking revenge against
the Southern California teams in
Stanford's last few home games of
the season. An outpouring of Cardi
nal goals saw San Diego State come
down hard to an uncharacteristically
well-playing Stanford outfit in a 4-1
blowout win at Cagan Stadium
perhaps the Cardinal's biggest upset
of the season. A tough loss to Pac-12
champion UCLA on Senior Day put
a dent in the pride of some of the sen
iors, yet they would soon redeem
themselves.
Last weekend, on the last day of
the season, the Cardinal rolled
over Cal in a match that saw fresh
man forward Zach Batteer, senior
midfielder Garrett Gunther and
Jahn each grab a goal in the deci
sive victory.
After the game, Gunther and
Jahn respectively won All-Pac-12
first team and second team honors.
Gunther finished the season as the
team's top scorer with five goals and
two assists for 12 points, two ahead
of Jahn's 10. When asked to summa
rize the season, which ended with
the Cardinal (6-10-2, 3-6-1 Pac-12)
placed fourth in the Pac-12, co-cap

tain Gorskie seemed disappointed
but optimistic.
"Result-wise, I think it wasn't
good enough for a Stanford team,"
he said. "We're always talking about
getting results, winning games and
representing the program as one of
the top ones in the Pac-12. In that
sense it was a tough year. We came
up way short of our goals, and that is
unacceptable."
"That being said, I think there
were definitely times in the season
where if the ball had bounced our
way things could have turned out
very differently," Gorskie added. "I
have a good feeling about next sea
son; we'll keep plowing forward."
Which way the ball bounces next
year remains to be seen.

fans have come to expect of Stan
ford's athletic teams, the Cardinal
was certainly not looking like the
contender for an NCAA Tourna
ment berth that it hoped to be. Junior
defender Hunter Gorskie admits
that the team had mixed feelings
going into the second half of the sea
son.
"Thinking back, you're 3-4-1 out
of the conference, which isn't ideal;
you want to have a winning record
going into conference play," Gorskie
said. "But we were coming off two
great wins against Vermont and Har

vard, teams we had gone down to
away last year. Those are matches
that feel really good to win for re
demption reasons, and they boost
morale, so we were pretty confident
going into the SoCal games."
So the Card traveled south riding
a high wave of confidence and mo
mentum that naturally ensues from
back-to-back victories at home.
Ranked opponents UCLA and San
Diego State proved tough competi
tion, though, as the Cardinal was shut
out in both games and blanked on the
road yet again.
Gorskie underlines that the team
wasn't wasting too much energy on
the goal drought, however.
"We didn't really think about it,"
he said. "We were just going out and
trying to play well, and it just wasn't
working for us for a while. We were
playing well, though, and knew that
the goals would come."
Broken and beaten, the team re
turned to Stanford for games against
Cal, Washington and Oregon State. A
stellar free kick from junior forward
Adam Jahn was enough to seal a
close 1-1 draw against the arch-rival
Bears, and the Cardinal picked up a
split while hosting teams from the
Northwest the Huskies proved
too fierce while the Beavers got their
teeth kicked in.
A road trip up the Pacific Coast
for rematches the subsequent week
end would yield little in terms of
points, as the Cardinal was swept and
any postseason aspirations were
shattered. But a small light at the end
of the tunnel could be found in Taylor
Amman's goal against the Huskies
the Card's first away goal of the
season which set up an interesting
backdrop for the season's last away
game at Berkeley.
The Cardinal then turned its at
tention to seeking revenge against
the Southern California teams in
Stanford's last few home games of
the season. An outpouring of Cardi
nal goals saw San Diego State come
down hard to an uncharacteristically
well-playing Stanford outfit in a 4-1
blowout win at Cagan Stadium
perhaps the Cardinal's biggest upset
of the season. A tough loss to Pac-12
champion UCLA on Senior Day put
a dent in the pride of some of the sen
iors, yet they would soon redeem
themselves.
Last weekend, on the last day of
the season, the Cardinal rolled
over Cal in a match that saw fresh
man forward Zach Batteer, senior
midfielder Garrett Gunther and
Jahn each grab a goal in the deci
sive victory.
After the game, Gunther and
Jahn respectively won All-Pac-12
first team and second team honors.
Gunther finished the season as the
team's top scorer with five goals and
two assists for 12 points, two ahead
of Jahn's 10. When asked to summa
rize the season, which ended with
the Cardinal (6-10-2, 3-6-1 Pac-12)
placed fourth in the Pac-12, co-cap

tain Gorskie seemed disappointed
but optimistic.
"Result-wise, I think it wasn't
good enough for a Stanford team,"
he said. "We're always talking about
getting results, winning games and
representing the program as one of
the top ones in the Pac-12. In that
sense it was a tough year. We came
up way short of our goals, and that is
unacceptable."
"That being said, I think there
were definitely times in the season
where if the ball had bounced our
way things could have turned out
very differently," Gorskie added. "I
have a good feeling about next sea
son; we'll keep plowing forward."
Which way the ball bounces next
year remains to be seen.

Midfielder Clayton Holzand his fellow seniors had a strong final season, but
the Cardinal still posted a losing record and a fourth-place finish in the Pac-12. Also leaving the team is head coach Bret Simon, who resigned Tuesday.
After an action-packed couple of
weeks that saw the Stanford men's
soccer team dismantle and blow out a
ranked opponent, lose heavily to the
conference champions on Senior
Day and shut out and dominate its
fiercest rivals on the road in the last
game of the season all before its
coach of 11 years resigned the
Cardinal now goes into hibernation
for the winter. That's not to say that
the players will be slacking off; but
after an intense (albeit shortened)
season, it's time to take a little break,
eat some turkey and ace those finals.
The Cardinal got off to a slow
start in the opening stages of the sea
son back in late August and early
September. After dropping the sea
son opener to Santa Clara, the team
lost back-to-back road games on the
East Coast against current No. 5
Maryland and Georgetown. The sub
sequent five games were played at
home in Laird Q. Cagan Stadium,
where the Cardinal notched convinc
ing wins against then-No. 15 Ken
tucky and Vermont as well as a sa
vory shutout of Harvard, which came
in front of an elated sell-out crowd of
nearly 2,000 during New Student
Orientation week.
These triumphs were, however,
disrupted by a surprising loss to
Lehigh and a close match against San
Francisco that ended in a draw.
Sitting with a mediocre 3-4-1
record at the halfway point of the
season, having trouble finding the
back of the net on the road and per
forming below the lofty standard
fans have come to expect of Stan
ford's athletic teams, the Cardinal
was certainly not looking like the
contender for an NCAA Tourna
ment berth that it hoped to be. Junior
