Residential Education
(ResEd) announced changes to
the student staff hiring process
for the 2012-2013 academic year
Monday.
According to Jennifer
Calvert, associate dean of
ResEd, the changes to the new
hiring process were in response
to feedback from Resident Fel
lows (RFs), the Resident Assis
tant (RA) Advisory Board, stu
dent staff and the student body.
Among the challenges
prospective staff members faced
last year was the different dead
lines for RA, row manager and
theme staff applications. The
row manager application
process had a later start date and
an earlier deadline than both
RA and theme staff applica
tions. To ensure that prospective
staff members are not forced to
make a premature decision re
garding which staff position to
accept, all application and selec
tion dates will coincide this year.
"We are committed to creat
ing a user-friendly timeline that
allows for flexibility in the
process, but isn't overly taxing to
our RF or student community,"
Calvert said in an email to The
Daily.
In addition to creating a con
sistent timeline across all staff
applications, ResEd is also intro

ducing a new master-match pro
gram for prospective staff. Last
year, many houses wanted to
consider certain prospective
candidates for multiple posi
tions. However, due to the differ
ent deadlines for each position,
matching candidates to specific
positions proved unfeasible.
"In the past, because manag
er and theme positions were
matched with houses at a differ
ent time than RA positions, ap
plicants were 'forced' into a
'false' choice," Calvert said.
"Opening up the ability to apply
across positions creates a greater
level of flexibility."

The introduction of the mas
ter-match process has received
positive responses from student
staff and RFs.
" I think [the match process]
gives staff more freedom to craft
the best staff possible for the fol
lowing year [by] choosing the in
dividual staff members and
where they will best fit on staff,"
said Sara Silberstein 'l2, an RA
in Kairos.
According to Christine Min
Wotipka, an associate professor
in the School of Education and
the RF in EAST House, the new
master-match process will help
prospective staff members who
have applied for multiple roles
make an informed decision in
choosing which position to ac-
