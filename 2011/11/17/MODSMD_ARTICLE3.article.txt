# Res Ed hiring policy changes
## Spring class required of RAs, co-term students ineligible 
### MARIANNE LEVINE DESK EDITOR 
Residential Education
(ResEd) announced changes to
the student staff hiring process
for the 2012-2013 academic year
Monday.
According to Jennifer
Calvert, associate dean of
ResEd, the changes to the new
hiring process were in response
to feedback from Resident Fel
lows (RFs), the Resident Assis
tant (RA) Advisory Board, stu
dent staff and the student body.
Among the challenges
prospective staff members faced
last year was the different dead
lines for RA, row manager and
theme staff applications. The
row manager application
process had a later start date and
an earlier deadline than both
RA and theme staff applica
tions. To ensure that prospective
staff members are not forced to
make a premature decision re
garding which staff position to
accept, all application and selec
tion dates will coincide this year.
"We are committed to creat
ing a user-friendly timeline that
allows for flexibility in the
process, but isn't overly taxing to
our RF or student community,"
Calvert said in an email to The
Daily.
In addition to creating a con
sistent timeline across all staff
applications, ResEd is also intro

ducing a new master-match pro
gram for prospective staff. Last
year, many houses wanted to
consider certain prospective
candidates for multiple posi
tions. However, due to the differ
ent deadlines for each position,
matching candidates to specific
positions proved unfeasible.
"In the past, because manag
er and theme positions were
matched with houses at a differ
ent time than RA positions, ap
plicants were 'forced' into a
'false' choice," Calvert said.
"Opening up the ability to apply
across positions creates a greater
level of flexibility."

The introduction of the mas
ter-match process has received
positive responses from student
staff and RFs.
" I think [the match process]
gives staff more freedom to craft
the best staff possible for the fol
lowing year [by] choosing the in
dividual staff members and
where they will best fit on staff,"
said Sara Silberstein 'l2, an RA
in Kairos.
According to Christine Min
Wotipka, an associate professor
in the School of Education and
the RF in EAST House, the new
master-match process will help
prospective staff members who
have applied for multiple roles
make an informed decision in
choosing which position to ac-
cept.
"A few times we have had to
scramble to fill vacant theme staff
positions because most applicants
accepted offers of RA positions,"
Wotipka said in an email to The
Daily.
Although Wotipka said she is "ex
cited" for the new match process, she
also noted that the change will di
minish one benefit of the previous
hiring process the ability to as
semble a staff team with comple
menting skills and personalities.
In addition to the changes to the
staff selection process, co-terminal
students will no longer be eligible to
serve as dorm staff. While in the past
co-term RAs were able to staff in up
perclassmen dorms or Row houses,
ResEd now requires that all appli
cants have another year of guaran
teed housing at the time of applica
tion. ResEd cites the growing size of
Stanford's incoming classes as the
impetus for this new requirement.
By limiting staff positions to under
graduates, ResEd hopes to reduce
the number of unassigned under
graduate students during the draw
process, according to the announce
ment. While unassigned students
from last year's draw were eventual
ly given housing, many of these stu
dents were assigned to off-campus or
graduate housing.
"This [new policy] will allow us to
keep our commitment to the overall
undergraduate population by giving
students with guaranteed years re
maining priority over those who
have already taken advantage of this
benefit," according to a prepared
joint-statement ResEd staff wrote in
an email to The Daily.
While the new rules for RA eligi
bility may reduce the number of
unassigned students during the draw
process, Silberstein described the
new policy as an "unfortunate conse
quence of the housing shortage."
"As a first-year RA, I really feel
that all of my fellow Row RAs who
are co-terming this year have a lot to
contribute to the training process
and to the community of Row mem
bers, let alone to their houses and
staff especially those who have
RAed once or even twice before,"
Silberstein said.
In addition to the changes listed
above, ResEd will require RAs to
enroll in a training class spring quar
ter. According to Calvert, ResEd

staff and RFs have been working for
years to establish the RA class and
are developing the course's curricu
lum, which will focus on "the com
plexities of leadership and emotional
intelligence."
"Our current training model al
lows for just a brief, cursory glance at
these skills over an intensive timeline
that does not lend itself to capacious
learning," Calvert said. "The RA
class will allow for deep reflective
thinking and the ability to practice
skills."
The spring-quarter course will
most likely be two-units, and ResEd
is currently working with the Bing
Overseas Program (BOSP) to create
a class option for RAs studying
abroad spring quarter.
Some RFs, RAs and prospective
RAs appear to be responding posi
tively to the new RA class require
ment.
"I think a great part of being an
RA is the RA community you join,"
said Tiffany Kung 'l3, who plans to
apply this cycle to become an RA.
"I'm definitely down to spend more
time with people who love Stanford
and am eager to be a part of the staff
community."
"I think [the class is] a good thing

because [training] is not all crammed
into such a short period," said
Matthaeus Weinhardt 'l3, a Toyon
RA. "But on the other hand if people
are taking it along with their other
courses they might retain a lot less
and forget a lot over the summer," he
added, raising one concern about the
new requirement.
Some current staff take issue with
the idea of a required transcript com
ponent to RA training.
"I feel strongly that making the
two-unit course a requirement for
the job is not the best direction to
take," said Daniel Scott Smith 'l2,
the RA of EAST House, in an email
to The Daily. "As I just checked my
University bill, tuition is $13,350 per
quarter. Does this mean that I am
paying approximately $1,335 to be
trained for a job? RAs are students
primarily, and workers after that. As
a prospective RA, I would consider
this course potentially undermining
my rights as both."
Applications for student staff po
sitions for the 2012-13 academic year
will be made available on Nov. 18 and
will be due Jan. 17.

"This [new policy] will allow us to
keep our commitment to the overall
undergraduate population by giving
students with guaranteed years re
maining priority over those who
have already taken advantage of this
benefit," according to a prepared
joint-statement ResEd staff wrote in
an email to The Daily.
While the new rules for RA eligi
bility may reduce the number of
unassigned students during the draw
process, Silberstein described the
new policy as an "unfortunate conse
quence of the housing shortage."
"As a first-year RA, I really feel
that all of my fellow Row RAs who
are co-terming this year have a lot to
contribute to the training process
and to the community of Row mem
bers, let alone to their houses and
staff especially those who have
RAed once or even twice before,"
Silberstein said.
In addition to the changes listed
above, ResEd will require RAs to
enroll in a training class spring quar
ter. According to Calvert, ResEd

staff and RFs have been working for
years to establish the RA class and
are developing the course's curricu
lum, which will focus on "the com
plexities of leadership and emotional
intelligence."
"Our current training model al
lows for just a brief, cursory glance at
these skills over an intensive timeline
that does not lend itself to capacious
learning," Calvert said. "The RA
class will allow for deep reflective
thinking and the ability to practice
skills."
The spring-quarter course will
most likely be two-units, and ResEd
is currently working with the Bing
Overseas Program (BOSP) to create
a class option for RAs studying
abroad spring quarter.
Some RFs, RAs and prospective
RAs appear to be responding posi
tively to the new RA class require
ment.
"I think a great part of being an
RA is the RA community you join,"
said Tiffany Kung 'l3, who plans to
apply this cycle to become an RA.
"I'm definitely down to spend more
time with people who love Stanford
and am eager to be a part of the staff
community."
"I think [the class is] a good thing

because [training] is not all crammed
into such a short period," said
Matthaeus Weinhardt 'l3, a Toyon
RA. "But on the other hand if people
are taking it along with their other
courses they might retain a lot less
and forget a lot over the summer," he
added, raising one concern about the
new requirement.
Some current staff take issue with
the idea of a required transcript com
ponent to RA training.
"I feel strongly that making the
two-unit course a requirement for
the job is not the best direction to
take," said Daniel Scott Smith 'l2,
the RA of EAST House, in an email
to The Daily. "As I just checked my
University bill, tuition is $13,350 per
quarter. Does this mean that I am
paying approximately $1,335 to be
trained for a job? RAs are students
primarily, and workers after that. As
a prospective RA, I would consider
this course potentially undermining
my rights as both."
Applications for student staff po
sitions for the 2012-13 academic year
will be made available on Nov. 18 and
will be due Jan. 17.

Residential Education
(ResEd) announced changes to
the student staff hiring process
for the 2012-2013 academic year
Monday.
According to Jennifer
Calvert, associate dean of
ResEd, the changes to the new
hiring process were in response
to feedback from Resident Fel
lows (RFs), the Resident Assis
tant (RA) Advisory Board, stu
dent staff and the student body.
Among the challenges
prospective staff members faced
last year was the different dead
lines for RA, row manager and
theme staff applications. The
row manager application
process had a later start date and
an earlier deadline than both
RA and theme staff applica
tions. To ensure that prospective
staff members are not forced to
make a premature decision re
garding which staff position to
accept, all application and selec
tion dates will coincide this year.
"We are committed to creat
ing a user-friendly timeline that
allows for flexibility in the
process, but isn't overly taxing to
our RF or student community,"
Calvert said in an email to The
Daily.
In addition to creating a con
sistent timeline across all staff
applications, ResEd is also intro

ducing a new master-match pro
gram for prospective staff. Last
year, many houses wanted to
consider certain prospective
candidates for multiple posi
tions. However, due to the differ
ent deadlines for each position,
matching candidates to specific
positions proved unfeasible.
"In the past, because manag
er and theme positions were
matched with houses at a differ
ent time than RA positions, ap
plicants were 'forced' into a
'false' choice," Calvert said.
"Opening up the ability to apply
across positions creates a greater
level of flexibility."

The introduction of the mas
ter-match process has received
positive responses from student
staff and RFs.
" I think [the match process]
gives staff more freedom to craft
the best staff possible for the fol
lowing year [by] choosing the in
dividual staff members and
where they will best fit on staff,"
said Sara Silberstein 'l2, an RA
in Kairos.
According to Christine Min
Wotipka, an associate professor
in the School of Education and
the RF in EAST House, the new
master-match process will help
prospective staff members who
have applied for multiple roles
make an informed decision in
choosing which position to ac-
cept.
"A few times we have had to
scramble to fill vacant theme staff
positions because most applicants
accepted offers of RA positions,"
Wotipka said in an email to The
Daily.
Although Wotipka said she is "ex
cited" for the new match process, she
also noted that the change will di
minish one benefit of the previous
hiring process the ability to as
semble a staff team with comple
menting skills and personalities.
In addition to the changes to the
staff selection process, co-terminal
students will no longer be eligible to
serve as dorm staff. While in the past
co-term RAs were able to staff in up
perclassmen dorms or Row houses,
ResEd now requires that all appli
cants have another year of guaran
teed housing at the time of applica
tion. ResEd cites the growing size of
Stanford's incoming classes as the
impetus for this new requirement.
By limiting staff positions to under
graduates, ResEd hopes to reduce
the number of unassigned under
graduate students during the draw
process, according to the announce
ment. While unassigned students
from last year's draw were eventual
ly given housing, many of these stu
dents were assigned to off-campus or
graduate housing.
"This [new policy] will allow us to
keep our commitment to the overall
undergraduate population by giving
students with guaranteed years re
maining priority over those who
have already taken advantage of this
benefit," according to a prepared
