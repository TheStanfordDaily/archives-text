## Human rights journalist shares insights Rosenberg reflects on Guantanamo access 
### ARMINE PILIKIAN 
Carol Rosenberg, recent recipi
ent of the Robert F. Kennedy Jour
nalism Award for outstanding
human rights reporting, spoke
Wednesday and relayed some of her
struggles covering events in Guan
tanamo Bay, where she has logged
more time than any other reporter.
"Carol has been an important
chronicler of the detainment of pris
oners at Guantanamo, and she has
important lessons to impart about
that experience," said Jim Bettinger,
director of the Knight Fellowship
Program, a yearlong fellowship pro
gram that attracts seasoned journal
ists from around the world.
Rosenberg discussed her report
ing style, emphasizing that she em
ploys a straightforward, wire service
style in her writing, covering the
basic facts of what happens on a day
to-day basis.
"People on the right read my sto
ries, and people on the left read my
stories; and they draw very different
conclusions," she said.
Rosenberg currently writes for
The Miami Herald, which she said is
the only paper that covers every
hearing in Guantanamo. According
to Rosenberg, the paper has a very
clear reason for wanting to cover the
events in Guantanamo.
"If they were going to make a
prison and a court out of reach of the
American people, we're not going to
allow it to be out of the reach of
American journalism," she said.
Rosenberg described the condi
tions in Guantanamo for both pris
oners and reporters. She indicated
that although the conditions for the
prisoners have been getting better,
the conditions for reporters are still
relatively the same.
"The problem with being a re
porter there is you can only show
the portion they allow you to show,"
she said.
Rosenberg also complained of
soldiers constantly listening over
her shoulder, dictating the content
of her stories and accessibility of her
sources.
Furthermore, Rosenberg stated
that one of the greatest challenges
of reporting in Guantanamo comes
from the prison's ever-changing re
strictions.
"You never know what you're al
lowed to see," she said.
Rosenberg indicated that one re
sult of the changing restrictions is
that there are always new escorts
for reporters. Still, Rosenberg said
she did not have very much difficul
ty communicating with the guards
and the prisoners about their expe
riences, which she found illuminat
ing.
Rosenberg expressed frustration
that her team was unable to account

for the costs of maintaining Guan
tanamo. There are a total of seven
camps at the base, with 171 prison
ers and 1,850 federal guards, and the
base costs $149 million a year, ac
cording to Rosenberg. Eighty per
cent of the prisoners live in a com
munal setting, where they eat, pray
and play sports together.
In response to a question from
the audience, Rosenberg described
her emotional stance on reporting
at the base.
"It's not the most fun job," she
said. "There is something very satis
fying knowing the place as well as I
do, but there is something very frus
trating about going down there."
Rosenberg also asserted that
Guantanamo Bay is vastly misun
derstood and that it is "not the
Guantanamo that people remem
ber."
The event, sponsored by the
Bowen H. McCoy Family Center
for Ethics in Society series on Ethics
and War, attracted around 50 peo
ple.
"I was expecting a more emo
tionally charged perspective, but we
really saw how she covered the
story as a journalist and was really
impartial," said Taz George 'l2. "I
was also really impressed by her
knowledge of the details of every
day life ... she spent the last 10
years of her life there, so you could
say she's the number one civilian
expert for that area."
