## Algorithm predicts cancer patient outcome 
### MARSHALL WATKINS 
Stanford researchers recently developed a
computer model capable of both analyzing mi
croscopic breast cancer images and offering pa
tients a prognosis with unprecedented accuracy
and consistency.
The Computational Pathologist system (C-
Path) is able to classify the types of cancer cells
present in a patient and the level of aggression
of the cells. The system also identifies key fea
tures in tumor tissue that may indicate chances

of survival. The model's computer analyses
were a significant improvement in statistical ac
curacy over those carried out by human pathol
ogists using the same data.
Stanford researchers trained the computer
model using tumor tissue images from 248
breast cancer patients whose survival data for
the subsequent five years were known to the re
searchers. C-Path examined 6,642 features in
the cancer image before independently identi
fying the most critical factors in determining
survivability. The researchers then created a

scoring system to predict patient outcome.
C-Path also identified structural features in
the tumor tissue images as more important than
previously thought by pathologists in determin
ing patient outcome.
"We built a model based on features of the
stroma the microenvironment between can
cer cells that was a stronger predictor of out
come than one built exclusively from features
of [cancerous] epithelial cells," said Andrew
Beck, lead author of the study. "The
stromal model was as predictive as
the model built from both stromal
and epithelial features."
Daphne Roller, a professor in
the School of Engineering and the
study's senior author, said in an
email to The Daily that the study's
results were "surprising and signifi
cant because today's cancer grad
ing scheme looks only at the cancer
cells."
"This finding supports the
emerging view that cancer isn't just
a bunch of cells gone awry, but
rather an entire ecosystem," she
said.
Beck, now an assistant professor
of pathology at Harvard Medical
School, originally undertook the
study as part of his post-doctoral
work at Stanford. His research fo
cused on the concept of prognosis
through algorithm, which stemmed
from collaboration with Roller.
Beck's experience in pathology,
combined with Roller's expertise in
machine learning and image analy
sis, allowed for the study to develop
over a two-year period.
The study confirmed its results
using a "validation" set of data from
328 women. The nature of the sub
ject material also complicated ef
forts to build the model. Among the
challenges researchers faced was
converting images to quantitative
data.
Beck noted that there remain
several obstacles to deploying the
computer model for clinical prog
noses, but anticipated broader use
of the model within a few years. He
indicated the model should be test
ed with larger images than the mi
croscopic tissue slides used in the
study. Beck added that the algo

rithm has to be able to adapt to the
different tissue staining procedures
used by different medical institu
tions.
Another challenge remaining is
the absence of lab standardization
for the C-Path system. At the mo
ment, researchers have to retrain
the model's epithelial and stromal
tissue indicators when changing
between data sets from institutions
with different staining protocols.
In the future, the researchers
anticipate the model will be ap
plied not only to other forms of
cancer but also to other diseases.
The self-teaching algorithm that C-
Path employs could train itself to
respond to different training data
and parameters and could thus for
mulate different predictions ac
cordingly.
"One particularly exciting ap
plication is to train the model on a
cohort of patients treated with a
particular disease ... and predict
which patients will respond to the
drug and which won't," Roller said.
"This would allow the system to be
used directly in helping guide clini
cal care."
By improving the accuracy and
consistency of breast cancer prog
noses, the model may allow doctors
to make more informed decisions
and to tailor treatments to the
severity of the patient's condition.
While the model seemingly offers
the possibility of advanced prog
noses in areas traditionally devoid
of expert medical coverage, re
searchers intend the system to act
as a complement for pathologists.
"This [model] will never replace
a pathologist, but will eventually
emerge as a decision support tool,"
Beck said. "It will be one that deliv
ers improved information and re
sults for doctors and patients every
where."
