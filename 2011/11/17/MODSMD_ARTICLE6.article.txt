## Algorithm predicts cancer patient outcome 
### MARSHALL WATKINS 
Stanford researchers recently developed a
computer model capable of both analyzing mi
croscopic breast cancer images and offering pa
tients a prognosis with unprecedented accuracy
and consistency.
The Computational Pathologist system (C-
Path) is able to classify the types of cancer cells
present in a patient and the level of aggression
of the cells. The system also identifies key fea
tures in tumor tissue that may indicate chances

of survival. The model's computer analyses
were a significant improvement in statistical ac
curacy over those carried out by human pathol
ogists using the same data.
Stanford researchers trained the computer
model using tumor tissue images from 248
breast cancer patients whose survival data for
the subsequent five years were known to the re
searchers. C-Path examined 6,642 features in
the cancer image before independently identi
fying the most critical factors in determining
survivability. The researchers then created a

scoring system to predict patient outcome.
C-Path also identified structural features in
the tumor tissue images as more important than
previously thought by pathologists in determin
ing patient outcome.
"We built a model based on features of the
stroma the microenvironment between can
cer cells that was a stronger predictor of out
come than one built exclusively from features
of [cancerous] epithelial cells," said Andrew
