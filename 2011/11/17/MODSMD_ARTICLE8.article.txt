## PA judge dismisses union complaint 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marianne LeVine 
On Tuesday, Chief Administra
tive Law Judge for the City of Palo
Alto Shawn Cloughesy dismissed a
complaint from the Public Employ
ment Relations Board (PERB) on
behalf of the International Associa
tion of Fire Fighters, Local 1319.
Palo Alto firefighters protested a
new ballot measure that prevents
Palo Alto police and firefighters from
using outside arbitrators in the settle
ment of contractual disputes with the
city. The PERB argued that the Palo
Alto City Council violated Califor
nia's collective bargaining law.
Palo Alto voters passed the meas
ure in question, Measure D, with a
67.28 percent majority in the Nov. 8
election.
Judge Cloughesy in his ruling
stated that he dismissed the com
plaint because the City of Palo Alto
had provided sufficient notice to
Local 1319. Cloughesy indicated
that the union had enough time to
object to the new ballot measure, yet
did not object to the ballot measure
until the last minute.
Local 1319 has 20 days to decide
whether or not to appeal the deci
sion and has yet to announce
whether it intends to take action.
Voters added the provision of
binding arbitration to the City Char
ter in 1978, giving arbitrators the
ability to make binding rulings when
two parties reach an impasse on pay
and benefit disputes. The move was
attributed at the time as a method to
counterbalance the fact that the
city's firefighters and police officers
do not have the right to strike.
Palo Alto voters followed a
statewide trend in passing Measure
D early this month. Vallejo voters
also repealed binding arbitration in
June, while San Luis Obispo voters
did so in August.
