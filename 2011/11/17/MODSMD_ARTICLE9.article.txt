# Engineers develop low-energy diode
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marianne LeVine 
Researchers in the School of En
gineering recently developed a new,
ultrafast nanoscale light-emitting
diode (LED) with the potential to
transmit data using far less energy

than other data transmission devices.
The new LED is able to transmit data
at 10 billion bits per second. Jelena
Vuckovic, an associate professor of
electrical engineering, and Gary
Shambat, a doctoral candidate in
electrical engineering, were the lead
researchers in developing the device.
The LED functions as a single
mode device. By using a single wave
length, it resembles standard lasers
used to transmit data, yet is able to
perform similar tasks at a faster rate,
using less energy by combining light
transmission and modulation.
Unlike another device Vuckovic
produced earlier this year, this latest
device can operate at room temper
ature, rendering it useful for com
mercial purposes and in answering
the growing energy needs of the
computer industry.
Also unlike pre-existing devices
that combined a laser and external
modulator, Vuckovic's latest pro
duction is a single device completing
both tasks.
