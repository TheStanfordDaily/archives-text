Clinical Research Study Participants Needed
Do you have an unsightly scar that is at least 6 inches long or a pair of
matching scars at least 2.5 inches long that you are seriously considering
having surgically revised?
• We are recruiting volunteers for a research study of a new
investigational dressing to see if it can help manage the healing
incision and minimize scar formation after scar revision procedures.
• If you qualify, you will wear the new investigational dressing for up
to 12 weeks as your incision heals.
• The outpatient revision surgery will be in Palo Alto and you will need
to return for weekly visits for 3 months and a photographic evaluation
at 4 and 6 months.
• Participants will be compensated for the weekly visits.
