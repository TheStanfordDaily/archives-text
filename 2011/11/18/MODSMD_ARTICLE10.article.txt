# Yale football coach scrutinized

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Brendan O 'Byrne 
Yale's head football coach
Thomas Williams '92 M.A. '95 is
being investigated by Yale Universi
ty following a Nov. 17 story in The
New York Times questioning
whether Williams was a Rhodes
Scholar candidate, as he said on his
resume.
Williams, who was a starting line
backer and team captain his senior
year when the Cardinal finished No.
9 in the national polls, also spent
three years as an assistant coach at
Stanford from 2002 to 2004.
The controversy began when
Yale quarterback Patrick Witt was
nominated for the scholarship. An
interview for the scholarship fell on
the same day as the Yale versus Har
vard game, and Witt sought advice
from Williams who said he faced a
similar situation at Stanford. Witt
eventually decided to stay and play
the game.
However following a question by
The New York Times, the Rhodes
Trust said they had no record of
Williams ever applying. The Rhodes
Trust said it keeps records for people

even if they end up withdrawing
their application.
Williams maintains Stanford did
endorse him, however he did not ad
vance as far as Witt, claiming the in
terview was informal. John Pearson
of Stanford's Bechtel International
Center, which is in charge of advis
ing students about the Rhodes
Scholarship on campus, declined to
give information to The New York
Times.
"We feel that we cannot provide
information that pertains to the
record of someone who was a Stan
ford student unless we received per
mission from that student," Pearson
told The New York Times.
Pearson said he has never
claimed to be a Rhodes finalist, and
wasn't surprised that the Rhodes
Trust had no record of him because
he didn't ever formally apply after
receiving a nomination from a facul
ty member. Numerous articles over
the past few weeks have listed him
as a Rhodes scholar finalist, and a
Yale alumni magazine in 2009 also
says that Pearson was a finalist.
