## EDITORIAL Beat Cal, but not with batons 
### 
In a week that usually involves
plenty of rivalry, from Big Sing
to Gaieties to the various Band
rallies and, of course, Big Game, we
would like to take a moment to
urge Stanford students to stand in
solidarity with Cal students in
recognition of some of their recent
struggles.
Many students will have seen
the videos of police action against
non-violent protesters in Sproul
Plaza on Nov. 9,2011. The students
were members of the "Occupy
Cal" movement, one of many simi
lar movements across the country,
but with a more explicit focus on is
sues facing UC-Berkeley and the
UC system. These concerns in
clude the significant fee hikes of
the past few years as well as the
issue of layoffs and reduced bene
fits for unionized Cal workers,
among others. The students chose
to protest in Sproul Plaza, holding
rallies but also setting up a
makeshift camp to maintain a
round-the-clock presence in keep
ing with the spirit of the Occupy
movement. The University
deemed this encampment illegal
and sent in police to dismantle the
encampment. Protestors met the
police and formed a human chain
around the tents in the tradition of
civil disobedience and nonviolent
protest. The police's use of batons
to forcibly break through the chain
was the subject of the video that
soon went viral.

We recognize that the adminis
tration and police's decision to dis
mantle the encampment on Nov. 9
and again on Nov. 17 was not a ma
licious one. Indeed, many of the
concerns that Chancellor Robert
Birgeneau raised regarding the
"hygiene, safety, space and conflict
issues" are valid. Any police force,
be it the one at Cal or the New
York City Policy Department,
must make a decision regarding
the best use of its resources, and
monitoring a protest encampment
may well detract from secure polic
ing elsewhere in the community.
What is unacceptable, however,
was the police's use of violence in
the face of civil disobedience. In
that situation, the appropriate re
sponse is citation and/or arrest in
accordance with the University's
regulations. Indeed, this is what the
police did on Nov. 17, issuing cita

tions for illegal lodging and failure
to disperse when given a dispersal
order.
Ultimately, the UC-Berkeley
Police Review Board will assess
last week's actions by the UCPD. It
is telling, however, that the recom
mendations made by the Police
Review Board in June 2010 in the
wake of the 2009 Wheeler Hall
protests have still not been fully
implemented. In this context, the
University must take more sub
stantive action, perhaps by first im
plementing the 2010 recommen
dations, to prove that it is commit
ted to the right of students to
protest peaceably.
The issues of disinvestment in
higher education are not unique to
Cal, of course, and not even to the
UC system. To this end, we ap
plaud those Cal students voicing
their concerns, both on campus
and in Sacramento, where a num
ber of students and faculty went to
lobby legislators and hold a press
conference on the issue of disin
vestment in higher education in
the state. While Stanford is fortu
nate that it has benefited from con
siderable recent investment and
has not faced cuts in education or
programming of the type that the
UC system has undergone, Cal's
concerns are, fundamentally, Stan
ford's concerns. Reduced funding
for public higher education means
that Stanford students' peers in the
UC system may not have the re
sources or opportunities to further
their work work which could ul
timately benefit and influence the
work of the wider academic com
munity at Stanford and elsewhere
while the fee hikes and reduc
tions to financial aid limit the size
of that community of scholars.
As Big Game Week comes to a
close, there is no doubt that Stan
ford students want, and expect, the
Cardinal to prevail on the football
field. Off the field though, what
unites us is far greater than what di
vides us. Both in response to the po
lice actions against protesters on
Nov. 9 and with regard to some of
the core complaints of those pro
testers regarding the state of public
higher education in California, we
urge Stanford students to recog
nize and support the efforts of their
colleagues at Cal to stand up to the
threats facing their education.

movement. The University
deemed this encampment illegal
and sent in police to dismantle the
encampment. Protestors met the
police and formed a human chain
around the tents in the tradition of
civil disobedience and nonviolent
protest. The police's use of batons
to forcibly break through the chain
was the subject of the video that
soon went viral.

We recognize that the adminis
tration and police's decision to dis
mantle the encampment on Nov. 9
and again on Nov. 17 was not a ma
licious one. Indeed, many of the
concerns that Chancellor Robert
Birgeneau raised regarding the
"hygiene, safety, space and conflict
issues" are valid. Any police force,
be it the one at Cal or the New
York City Policy Department,
must make a decision regarding
the best use of its resources, and
monitoring a protest encampment
may well detract from secure polic
ing elsewhere in the community.
What is unacceptable, however,
was the police's use of violence in
the face of civil disobedience. In
that situation, the appropriate re
sponse is citation and/or arrest in
accordance with the University's
regulations. Indeed, this is what the
police did on Nov. 17, issuing cita

tions for illegal lodging and failure
to disperse when given a dispersal
order.
Ultimately, the UC-Berkeley
Police Review Board will assess
last week's actions by the UCPD. It
is telling, however, that the recom
mendations made by the Police
Review Board in June 2010 in the
wake of the 2009 Wheeler Hall
protests have still not been fully
implemented. In this context, the
University must take more sub
stantive action, perhaps by first im
plementing the 2010 recommen
dations, to prove that it is commit
ted to the right of students to
protest peaceably.
The issues of disinvestment in
higher education are not unique to
Cal, of course, and not even to the
UC system. To this end, we ap
plaud those Cal students voicing
their concerns, both on campus
and in Sacramento, where a num
ber of students and faculty went to
lobby legislators and hold a press
conference on the issue of disin
vestment in higher education in
the state. While Stanford is fortu
nate that it has benefited from con
siderable recent investment and
has not faced cuts in education or
programming of the type that the
UC system has undergone, Cal's
concerns are, fundamentally, Stan
ford's concerns. Reduced funding
for public higher education means
that Stanford students' peers in the
UC system may not have the re
sources or opportunities to further
their work work which could ul
timately benefit and influence the
work of the wider academic com
munity at Stanford and elsewhere
while the fee hikes and reduc
tions to financial aid limit the size
of that community of scholars.
As Big Game Week comes to a
close, there is no doubt that Stan
ford students want, and expect, the
Cardinal to prevail on the football
field. Off the field though, what
unites us is far greater than what di
vides us. Both in response to the po
lice actions against protesters on
Nov. 9 and with regard to some of
the core complaints of those pro
testers regarding the state of public
higher education in California, we
urge Stanford students to recog
nize and support the efforts of their
colleagues at Cal to stand up to the
threats facing their education.
