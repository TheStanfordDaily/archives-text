# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Showing school spirit with safety, respect 
### 
Dear Editor:
On Nov. 19, 2011, Stanford and
Cal will square off in the 114 th an
nual Big Game at Stanford Stadi
um, an event that has been a Bay
Area tradition. Our two universities
share a strong football and academ
ic heritage, as well as a spirited and
storied rivalry.
It is important that the tradition
al goal of the Big Game be rein
forced this year: a spirited competi
tion on the field and an enjoyable
experience for those in the stands.
Unfortunately, in past years, the
spirit of the Big Game has been
dampened by the irresponsible be
havior of some that resulted in fra
cas and property damage.
We again ask this year that you
refrain from engaging in "pranks"
and other activities that may draw
law enforcement and security per
sonnel and resources away from re
sponding to more pressing matters.
We feel that those attending the Big
Game should not have to fear for
their safety; therefore, we must em
phasize that fans who engage in in
cidents of field trespass, physical as
sault and/or property damage will
be ejected from the stadium. Stu
dents found responsible for these
types of activities will face discipli

nary action at their respective insti
tutions; such action may include
suspension or dismissal.
Please respect more than a cen
tury of Big Game tradition and cel
ebrate your school spirit, pride and
sportsmanship in a safe, positive
and friendly manner. Enjoy the
game!
With warm regards,
ROBERT J. BIRGENEAU
Chancellor, UC-Berkeley

President, Stanford University
