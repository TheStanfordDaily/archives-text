# Reducing reckless drinking as a community
## 
### 
Dear students,
On Nov. 10, The Daily featured a
front page article describing Cardi
nal Nights, an initiative focused on
bringing new social programming
to campus ("OAPE offers alterna
tive social scene," Nov. 10). Spon
sored by the Office of Alcohol Poli
cy and Education (OAPE), Cardi
nal Nights gives students attractive
alternatives to events focused on al
cohol which is something students
say has been missing from the social
scene on campus. As a result, we are
expanding this programming and,
consequently, we are actively look
ing to partner with students who
have ideas and need support.
Amid growing concerns that
students are engaging more often
in unsafe drinking (drinking to
blackout, vomiting, doing things
you later regret), we reviewed our
alcohol policy and found that it was
not serving students or the campus
community well. After reframing
the policy, we now have a restated
Student Alcohol Policy that out
lines expectations around alcohol
for students. Central to the policy is
the University's concern about
high-risk and reckless drinking
practices, especially those that in
volve hard liquor. We know that
hard liquor accounts for nearly 100
percent of all emergency room
transports for alcohol poisoning,
making it the biggest risk factor in

student alcohol-related problems
at Stanford.
To combat this problem we are
increasing our educational and out
reach efforts. We need students to
question and challenge situations
that lead to dangerous drinking. We
know that Stanford is a caring place
where students are part of a dynam
ic community and get help for those
who need it.These shared values are
the basis of the Cardinal Code, an
aspirational mantra that encom
passes the Fundamental Stanford
and Honor Code. It is away of life
at Stanford centered on our 'civic'
responsibility to prevent dangerous
behaviors and promote positive and
healthy norms. We are a strong com
munity that looks out for each other
and the Cardinal Code gives this
ethos an identity and name.
We are also pleased to have a
new online resource that addresses
alcohol at Stanford (http://alcohol.
stanford.edu).This site contains the
Student Alcohol Policy and identi
fies resources and education efforts

related to alcohol and drugs. We
hope that students will use the site
as a reference tool. Also, we are
launching a training called Say
Something@Stanford to encourage
and provide skills for students to in
tervene in potentially dangerous
situations. A campus-wide Say
Something@Stanford training will
occur on Monday, Nov. 28 at 8 p.m.
in the Tresidder Oak Room and all
students are invited to participate.
I also invite all students to join
our effort to reduce reckless drink
ing and to take an active role in en
hancing the social scene on campus.
To contribute to the dialogue on
high-risk drinking, come to an
ASSU-sponsored forum on Tues
day, Nov. 29, at 9:30 p.m. at the D
school (Building 550).
I look forward to talking with you
in person and working together.
