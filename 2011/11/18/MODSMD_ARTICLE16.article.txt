# SEEING GREEN
## Doing the 'right' thing 
### Holly Moeller 
Turkey Day is coming, and with
it, the deadline for Obama's
12-member "Super Commit
tee," a group of Congress members
tasked with carving $1.2 trillion off
our national debt.

If the bipartisan group can even
reach a deal (so far, they've missed
their own deadline by at least 10
days, flatly refused each others' pro
posals and been awfully closed
lipped about possible compromis
es), it seems like everyone's going to
feel the pinch.
Everyone, that is, who can't buy
his or her way out of it.
Last week, the American Petro
leum Institute the notorious
"Big Oil" lobby representing
Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell and
others started running ads
thanking Republican super com
mittee members for preserving in
dustry-specific tax breaks worth $4O
billion over the next 10 years.
Yes, $4O billion is only a few per
centage points of the committee's
target. (Though it's still two-and-a

half times the size of Stanford's en
dowment, the biggest sum of money
that most of us are likely to claim af
filiation with in our lifetimes.)
But the idea that an industry that
earned $24 billion in profits last
quarter alone can't pony up its right
ful taxes in a time of financial crisis

... Well, it's no wonder that those of
us who've checked the facts are
rolling our eyes in dismay at the soft
spines of the super committee.
Then again, the oil companies
aren't picking up my campaign tab.
Nor are they running ads in my dis
trict, calling subsidy cuts "job-de
stroying energy taxes." The threat is
implicit: Big Oil has money, Big Oil
helped you get your Washington
D.C. seat and Big Oil can take it
away.

What a world of difference a po
litical system can make. Somewhere
across the Pacific Ocean, a certain
rising nation is maneuvering its
state-owned industries to national
advantage. No muss, no fuss, no
worries about making profits.

Last month, the New York
Times ran a quote from a Chinese
plant manager that summed it up
perfectly: "Someone has to lose
money. We're a state-owned cor
poration, and it's our social re
sponsibility."
Yes, I admit, I laughed. Aloud. I
am an American, after all, and I be
lieve in capitalism. I'm also a biolo
gist who trusts in the survival of the
fittest. But as a human being with a
pair of eyes, I also know that an un
regulated market can produce cata
strophic damages to human health
and to the environment. That's
where government, if it has a deft
touch, can employ taxes and regula
tions to account for things that our
economic system doesn't explicitly
value, like clean air and water,
preservation of open space and in
tact ecosystems for future genera

tions, and so on.
We certainly can't rely on corpo
rations to do it themselves. Admit
tedly, a few dozen members of "the
1 percent" showed up at Capitol
Hill on Wednesday to represent the
"Patriotic Millionaires" 200-
plus wealthy U.S. citizens, including
many current and ex-executives
and ask for higher taxes. And some
corporate cultures do "give back"
or "go green" for more than just the
attendant publicity. But if we want
the business of the American peo
ple to be, well, doing business, we
have to find ways to make sure that
business is still doing the right thing
for us.

Calvin Coolidge (whose speech
started the whole "business ... is
doing business" business) ended
that same speech with a reminder
that monetary wealth has never
been the true motivation of Ameri
cans. Rather, it's been a means to a
rather idealistic end: a free society
with peaceful citizens and equal op
portunity. I think that's something
every one of today's politicians
could (claim to) get behind.
So, motivated by an intuitive
sense of fair play and armed with
the knowledge that money isn't
everything, now is the time to take a

knife to energy subsidies. Sure, fuel
prices will go up (though probably a
small amount compared to the in
creases we've seen in the last few
years), but our tax money will go
further. And keep in mind, there
are tougher things on the American
pocket like, say, paying for a couple
of wars.
It's time to face the new reality:
The age of cheap oil is ending, and
energy prices are already rising. We
can face it now, or we can face it
later. Although I'm a procrastina
tor in most things, this is a task I'd
rather handle immediately. Cutting
fossil fuel subsidies today helps
level the playing field for alterna
tive energy sources, including re
newable ones like wind and solar.
That means we'll be helping these
industries develop before we need
to rely on them entirely. And if
we're feeling particularly forward
looking, we might actually, at long
last, implement a carbon tax to ex
plicitly link environmental quality
to our economic system.
Whether your goal is to slow the
rate of anthropogenic climate
change or to cut back on big gov
ernment, the first thing to do is to
slap the meddlesome, biased hand
of oil subsidies. It is, however you
look at it, the Right thing to do.

been the true motivation of Ameri
cans. Rather, it's been a means to a
rather idealistic end: a free society
with peaceful citizens and equal op
portunity. I think that's something
every one of today's politicians
could (claim to) get behind.
So, motivated by an intuitive
sense of fair play and armed with
the knowledge that money isn't
everything, now is the time to take a

knife to energy subsidies. Sure, fuel
prices will go up (though probably a
small amount compared to the in
creases we've seen in the last few
years), but our tax money will go
further. And keep in mind, there
are tougher things on the American
pocket like, say, paying for a couple
of wars.
It's time to face the new reality:
The age of cheap oil is ending, and
energy prices are already rising. We
can face it now, or we can face it
later. Although I'm a procrastina
tor in most things, this is a task I'd
rather handle immediately. Cutting
fossil fuel subsidies today helps
level the playing field for alterna
tive energy sources, including re
newable ones like wind and solar.
That means we'll be helping these
industries develop before we need
to rely on them entirely. And if
we're feeling particularly forward
looking, we might actually, at long
last, implement a carbon tax to ex
plicitly link environmental quality
to our economic system.
Whether your goal is to slow the
rate of anthropogenic climate
change or to cut back on big gov
ernment, the first thing to do is to
slap the meddlesome, biased hand
of oil subsidies. It is, however you
look at it, the Right thing to do.

Turkey Day is coming, and with
it, the deadline for Obama's
12-member "Super Commit
tee," a group of Congress members
tasked with carving $1.2 trillion off
our national debt.

If the bipartisan group can even
reach a deal (so far, they've missed
their own deadline by at least 10
days, flatly refused each others' pro
posals and been awfully closed
lipped about possible compromis
es), it seems like everyone's going to
feel the pinch.
Everyone, that is, who can't buy
his or her way out of it.
Last week, the American Petro
leum Institute the notorious
"Big Oil" lobby representing
Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell and
others started running ads
thanking Republican super com
mittee members for preserving in
dustry-specific tax breaks worth $4O
billion over the next 10 years.
Yes, $4O billion is only a few per
centage points of the committee's
target. (Though it's still two-and-a

half times the size of Stanford's en
dowment, the biggest sum of money
that most of us are likely to claim af
filiation with in our lifetimes.)
But the idea that an industry that
earned $24 billion in profits last
quarter alone can't pony up its right
ful taxes in a time of financial crisis

... Well, it's no wonder that those of
us who've checked the facts are
rolling our eyes in dismay at the soft
spines of the super committee.
Then again, the oil companies
aren't picking up my campaign tab.
Nor are they running ads in my dis
trict, calling subsidy cuts "job-de
stroying energy taxes." The threat is
implicit: Big Oil has money, Big Oil
helped you get your Washington
D.C. seat and Big Oil can take it
away.

What a world of difference a po
litical system can make. Somewhere
across the Pacific Ocean, a certain
rising nation is maneuvering its
state-owned industries to national
advantage. No muss, no fuss, no
worries about making profits.

Last month, the New York
Times ran a quote from a Chinese
plant manager that summed it up
perfectly: "Someone has to lose
money. We're a state-owned cor
poration, and it's our social re
sponsibility."
Yes, I admit, I laughed. Aloud. I
am an American, after all, and I be
lieve in capitalism. I'm also a biolo
gist who trusts in the survival of the
fittest. But as a human being with a
pair of eyes, I also know that an un
regulated market can produce cata
strophic damages to human health
and to the environment. That's
where government, if it has a deft
touch, can employ taxes and regula
tions to account for things that our
economic system doesn't explicitly
value, like clean air and water,
preservation of open space and in
tact ecosystems for future genera

tions, and so on.
We certainly can't rely on corpo
rations to do it themselves. Admit
tedly, a few dozen members of "the
1 percent" showed up at Capitol
Hill on Wednesday to represent the
"Patriotic Millionaires" 200-
plus wealthy U.S. citizens, including
many current and ex-executives
and ask for higher taxes. And some
corporate cultures do "give back"
or "go green" for more than just the
attendant publicity. But if we want
the business of the American peo
ple to be, well, doing business, we
have to find ways to make sure that
business is still doing the right thing
for us.

Calvin Coolidge (whose speech
started the whole "business ... is
doing business" business) ended
that same speech with a reminder
that monetary wealth has never
been the true motivation of Ameri
cans. Rather, it's been a means to a
rather idealistic end: a free society
with peaceful citizens and equal op
portunity. I think that's something
