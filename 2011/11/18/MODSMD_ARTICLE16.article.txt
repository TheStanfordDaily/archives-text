# SEEING GREEN
## Doing the 'right' thing 
### Holly Moeller 
Turkey Day is coming, and with
it, the deadline for Obama's
12-member "Super Commit
tee," a group of Congress members
tasked with carving $1.2 trillion off
our national debt.

If the bipartisan group can even
reach a deal (so far, they've missed
their own deadline by at least 10
days, flatly refused each others' pro
posals and been awfully closed
lipped about possible compromis
es), it seems like everyone's going to
feel the pinch.
Everyone, that is, who can't buy
his or her way out of it.
Last week, the American Petro
leum Institute the notorious
"Big Oil" lobby representing
Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell and
others started running ads
thanking Republican super com
mittee members for preserving in
dustry-specific tax breaks worth $4O
billion over the next 10 years.
Yes, $4O billion is only a few per
centage points of the committee's
target. (Though it's still two-and-a

half times the size of Stanford's en
dowment, the biggest sum of money
that most of us are likely to claim af
filiation with in our lifetimes.)
But the idea that an industry that
earned $24 billion in profits last
quarter alone can't pony up its right
ful taxes in a time of financial crisis

... Well, it's no wonder that those of
us who've checked the facts are
rolling our eyes in dismay at the soft
spines of the super committee.
Then again, the oil companies
aren't picking up my campaign tab.
Nor are they running ads in my dis
trict, calling subsidy cuts "job-de
stroying energy taxes." The threat is
implicit: Big Oil has money, Big Oil
helped you get your Washington
D.C. seat and Big Oil can take it
away.

What a world of difference a po
litical system can make. Somewhere
across the Pacific Ocean, a certain
rising nation is maneuvering its
state-owned industries to national
advantage. No muss, no fuss, no
worries about making profits.

Last month, the New York
Times ran a quote from a Chinese
plant manager that summed it up
perfectly: "Someone has to lose
money. We're a state-owned cor
poration, and it's our social re
sponsibility."
Yes, I admit, I laughed. Aloud. I
am an American, after all, and I be
lieve in capitalism. I'm also a biolo
gist who trusts in the survival of the
fittest. But as a human being with a
pair of eyes, I also know that an un
regulated market can produce cata
strophic damages to human health
and to the environment. That's
where government, if it has a deft
touch, can employ taxes and regula
tions to account for things that our
economic system doesn't explicitly
value, like clean air and water,
preservation of open space and in
tact ecosystems for future genera
