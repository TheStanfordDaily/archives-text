# THE 						MIXED MESSAGES OF MODERNISM
## The 						Stanford experience 
### D.S. Nelson 
Before we arrived here, we all
heard the obligatory generali
ties about college. The stories
are even more enthusiastic when it
comes to Stanford grads. "It was in
sane. I did so much. I learned so
much. I met so many great people.
I'll never forget this one time ..."
While Stanford and your fresh
man dorm will try to make you en
mesh yourself in the life of our cam
pus, it is easy to withdraw from so
cial life and sleepwalk toward a de
gree. While it is true of high school
that you will have a certain number
of formative experiences whether
you try or not, Stanford gives us the
freedom not to have a college expe
rience, Only here could it be easier
to lock yourself up and study than
to give into temptation and party
the quarters away (simply because
of how centralized the social scene
is.) Stanford loads on enough work
to consume most of your waking
hours as you labor away, and many
do. Many consider that option to be
the most filial thing to do. A high
GPA means that your parents' wish

for you to be successful in school
and beyond is satisfied. That is true,
but only in a limited way, and few
would think so narrowly. It is tempt
ing to deny the endeavors that will
never make it onto a resume their
due value, but performing them is
what makes college more valuable
than a mere degree.
As tempting and expected as it
may be, you should never let your
schooling get in the way of your ed
ucation. Your happiness and the
breadth of your learning are priori
ties that can't be set aside in the
name of success, or else the fullness
of your experience and self will be
sacrificed.

We should not be trying only to
succeed academically in the long
term and excel professionally in the
short term. There are far more im
portant things to seek than being
better adjusted to work and manag
ing a GPA. College's greatest im
pact is not in the classroom. The cul
tivation Stanford offers here only
begins in the classroom. Denying
yourself nights and days of leisure

means denying yourself important
self-cultivation. Classes can be
taken and retaken later in life at
community colleges. Lectures can
be heard on You Tube and lessons
read from textbooks. It is the fusion
of academic and social life and the
communal experience of develop
ing maturity that makes the college
experience. No one comes here
fully set in his or her ways. It is the
chance to share the experience of
deciding what is important to us and
will shape our lives; this provides
the education that is truly unique to
the college environment.
Your schooling can do all this,
too, but only when we take an inter
est in it beyond its career utility. I al
ways surprised myself by how little
I can learn in a class if I am not in
terested. There have been college
classes that I took with such apathy

that I couldn't remember anything
about them the quarter after. Trans
lating schooling from factual knowl
edge to internalized learning isn't a
matter of course it requires a
special variety of effort.
It's often said in a derisory way
that college is the last time in life
where you can just screw around.
But many mistake not spending
time in study for avoiding edifica
tion. Stanford students are obvious
ly masterful at delaying gratifica
tion, but we can do so at the expense
of much of life's quality.The value of
your classes is partly wasted when
the material isn't fodder for a night
time debate, when it's not internal

ized in the everyday. The investment
in college is partly wasted when one
spends too much time justifying the
payment on your room and board
(that was a really roundabout way
of saying "staying inside.") A suc
cessful career is a waste if it's not ac
companied by something good or
pleasurable, I believe this whole
heartedly.
As much as our campus seems
to push you to go out for clubs and
plan your quarters to help build a
resume, I advise a different regi
men. Go do something intention
ally useless and enjoyable. There's
nothing like a break, so seize the
day to not seize the day and you
may find you've achieved more
than one can when chained to a
desk.
