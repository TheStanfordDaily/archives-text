## NOT SO FAST Stanford can't look past Aggies 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Fresh off a big win over Col
orado State at Maples Pavilion ear
lier this week, the Stanford men's
basketball team is back on the
hardwood tonight, heading just up
the road to take on UC-Davis in a
non-league game.
The Cardinal (3-0) is riding high
after sweeping the first two games

of the NIT Season Tip-Off. Tuesday
night's 64-52 win over the Rams
earned Stanford a trip to New York
City for next week's semifinal
round of the Tip-Off and a na
tionally televised game at Madison
Square Garden on Wednesday
against Oklahoma State.
Junior guard Gabriel Harris
gave the Card a boost against Col
orado State with a 60-foot halftime
buzzer-beater, and Stanford over
came an early deficit to pull away
in the second half thanks to the
same improved outside shooting
that gave it the victories against
Central Arkansas and Fresno State

to open the season.
Although Stanford shot just 43
percent for the game, the team
cashed in on several open jump
shots that last year never seemed to
drop.
Harris finished with 12 points,
three back of redshirt senior for
ward Josh Owens for the team
high. And sophomore guard Aaron
Bright continued his impressive
start to the season with 12 points,
his third straight double-digit scor
ing night.
It will be important for Stanford
not to overlook the Aggies (1-3)
after the emotional uplift of the
win over Colorado State. While
Davis' record hasn't been all that
impressive in the early going, all
three losses were very good games
including a one-point loss to
Southern Utah and a game against
San Diego State in which the Ag
gies held the Aztecs scoreless for
the opening three minutes.
And if the Aggies' Josh Ritchart
heats up from the outside, watch
out. Last year's Big West Co-Fresh
man of the Year likes to line it up
from behind the arc, and at 6-foot
-9 he has the extension to shoot over
smaller guards. As a team, Davis is
also shooting 36 percent from be
hind the arc, with some good guard
play on the whole.
But they can still do some dam
age down low, if they have to. Har
rison Dupont made his season
debut for the Aggs in their win over
UC-Santa Cruz, scoring 15 points
with five boards in just 15 minutes.
Dupont was a McDonald's Ail-
American in high school, but sat
out last season after transferring
from the Citadel to play for Davis.
It will be up to Owens, along
with sophomores Dwight Powell
and Josh Huestis, to neutralize
Ritchart and the Aggies' wing play
with their length and athleticism.
Powell is coming off an ankle
sprain from last week, playing only
sparingly against the Rams, but
Huestis has really shined as a force
on the glass.
Freshman guard Chasson Ran
dle has also looked good early on,
but Stanford is still searching for
the man to run the offense, as
Bright appears to be more of a
spot-up shooter than a true distrib
utor, and Randle is most effective
as a slashing combo guard.
Tonight's matchup should serve
to be a good time to tune things up
for the offense before it heads to
MSG next week, as the defense has
looked relatively strong so far this
season, albeit against some suspect
offenses. Tip-off from the Pavilion
is slated for 7 p.m.
