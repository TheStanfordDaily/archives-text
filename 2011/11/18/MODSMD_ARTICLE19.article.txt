## Stanford men's basketball, golf teams sign five to national letters of intent 
### 
Men's basketball head coach
Johnny Dawkins announced the
signing of three highly-touted re
cruits to National Letters of Intent
on Thursday, the same day that
men's golf coach Conrad Ray an
nounced that two of his recruits also

had signed letters of intent and will
be attending Stanford next fall.
Dawkins' signees include Rosco
Allen, currently listed as the No. 12-
ranked small forward and No. 55
overall player in ESPNU's 100 na
tional rankings; Christian Sanders,
ESPNU's No. 26-ranked shooting
guard; and Grant Verhoeven, cur
rently ranked No. 95 overall by
ESPNU.

The 2012 class is being touted as
one of Dawkins' best overall, with
ESPN.com rating it as "on the cusp"
of being in the nation's top-25, and
Scout.com putting it at No. 25. The
players come from all over the coun
try, with Allen playing for Bishop
Gorman High School in Las Vegas,
Sanders for St. Thomas High School
in Houston and Verhoeven suiting
up for Central Valley Christian.
Ray's incoming class has a bit
more of an international flavor, as
David Boote hails from Epsom Col
lege in Surrey, England. The 2011
National Junior Champion, Boote
is joined in the class by Dominick
Francks, currently of Olympia High
School in Washington.

They will join an already deep
Cardinal squad, which features just
one senior on its roster and is ex
pected to compete for Pac-12 and
national titles when the season
kicks off in February.
