# BEAR DOWN
## CARD LOOKS TO KEEP THE AXE ON THE FARM 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
s
ometimes, it's best to just move on.
After falling flat on the national stage last
weekend, the Cardinal looks to regain its feet
against Cal, which is riding a two-game win
streak and looking to spoil the Cardinal's BCS
hopes in its last Pac-12 game of the year.

If the No. 9 Cardinal (9-1, 7-1 Pac-12)
hopes to avoid being upset by the suddenly
streaking Bears (6-4,3-4), it will need to im
prove on, well, everything from last week.
The Cardinal had a season-high five
turnovers, gave up a season-high five sacks
and 53 points, scored a season-low 30
points and had a season-low 129 rushing
yards.
"We really didn't come up with much

good things about that game," redshirt
freshman linebacker A.J. Tarpley dead
panned, but he said that the tough loss had
n't sent the Cardinal fully back to the draw
ing board.
"I wouldn't say it's like a reset for our
season, I kind of feel like we reset our men
tality every week," he said. "It's the same
when we try not to hang on the highs of the
wins too long. The USC game, for example,

we kind of reset. Yeah, it's a great win; we
got to enjoy it. But Sunday and Monday
you're preparing for the next game, prepar
ing for Oregon State."
But if Stanford wants to bounce back in
emphatic fashion and take back-to-back
games from the Bears for the first time in a
decade, it might have to fight out a defen
sive struggle for the first time all season.
Led by seniors Mychal Kendricks (75

tackles), D.J. Holt (71 tackles) and Sean
Cattouse (54 tackles), the Cal defense is
ranked first in the Pac-12 in total defense,
giving up only 319.1 yards per game the
only team with a better defensive mark
than the Cardinal in the conference.
That said, the two defenses don't exact
ly do things the same way. Cal holds passers

NOTES IA week after losing to Oregon in one of
the biggest games in Stanford history, the No. 9
Cardinal must bounce back in a hurry with
"California in town for the 114 th Big Game. The
Bears are playing their best football of the year,
but watch to see if Stanford's Andrew Luck can
regain his footing in the race for the Heisman
Trophy with a big game of his own.

to less than 200 yards a game through the air
while Stanford keeps opponents under 95
yards rushing per game. Additionally, Cal
has held its last two opponents to a com
bined 13 points, while Stanford gave up 53
last Saturday.
Even though the Cardinal defenders
weren't so impressive last weekend against
the Ducks, defensive coordinator Derek
Mason said that Stanford won't change its
stripes after one poor performance.
"We don't second guess, we don't micro
manage, we just say that we learned a lot
from this football game, let's make sure we
can correct the issues that need to be cor
rected, and let's adjust it, because that's last
week," he said.
If Stanford hopes to crack the Cal de
fense, it will likely lean heavily on the run
game in order to take advantage of the
weaker aspect of the Bear defense and try
to establish some rhythm for quarterback
Andrew Luck.
Junior running back Stepfan Taylor tal
lied 87 yards in the first half before the Car
dinal was forced to abandon the running
game, while Luck accounted for three cost
ly turnovers last weekend due to a hawking
Oregon defense that challenged the Stan
ford offensive line on every down.
Senior guard David DeCastro said that
Luck's protectors had to improve before the
ball was snapped this week if they wanted to
keep their superstar's jersey clean.
"I think just communicating; that's key
to offensive line play, always being on the
same page. When that doesn't happen, An
drew's getting hit," he said.
When Luck does turn to the air, he will
likely be looking to find senior receiver Griff
Whalen, who has quietly become the passer's
favorite target over the last month. Whalen
now leads the team with 45 catches for 641
yards and four touchdowns, with 36 of those
catches and 540 yards coming in the last six
games. Whalen's sudden rise to the ace of the
receiving corps has been particularly impor
tant, as senior receiver Chris Owusu and jun
ior tight end Zach Ertz are both once again
unlikely to play this Saturday.
The Bear offense will counter by looking
to sophomore wide receiver Keenan Allen,
who rivals USC wide receiver Robert
Woods for the top spot in every receiving
category in the Pac-12. Allen is second in re
ceptions per game in the conference and
third in receiving yards per game, as well as
10th in all-purpose yards.
The North Carolina native has 1,103
yards receiving and five touchdowns on the
year, although he has been particularly
quiet lately Allen has failed to go over

the 100-yard mark in his last four games.
"We know we've got to stop him in order
to stop their offense," Tarpley said of Allen's
importance to the Bear attack.
Of course, any matchup between Stan
ford and Cal includes an element of the un
predictable one of the country's oldest
rivalries has certainly seen its share of un
usual upsets and wild finishes over the past
114 years.
Tlie Bears have been the superior com
petitors in the last decade's Big Games,
going 7-2 since 2002, including a 1-1 record
against Luck. In his two starts against the
Bears, Luck tossed a crushing last-minute
interception to fall 34-28 at home in 2009,
then got his revenge with a 48-14 thrashing
in Berkeley that included a highlight-reel,
58-yard run in which Luck trucked over
Cattouse in the open field.
Even though Oregon and USC eclipse
Cal in terms of national prominence this

season, the Stanford players say the Trojans
and Ducks haven't pushed the Bears to the
back-burner of conference rivals.

"I would see how people would say that,
but I don't think it has been at all, there's
still just that extra excitement, that juice for
the Big Game, you know, you walk on the
campus and you see 'Beat Cal' hanging
from the library," Tarpley said. "Obviously
people might not think of them as highly as
USC or Oregon, but they're coming in here
excited and playing their best ball, and
we're going to need to do the same thing if
we're going to come out here and get the
win."
Stanford and Cal will rekindle the rival
ry tomorrow night at 7:15 p.m. in the 114 th
edition of the Big Game. Television cover
age will be on ESPN.
