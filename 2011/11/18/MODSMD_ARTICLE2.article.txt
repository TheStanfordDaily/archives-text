# BEAR DOWN
## CARD LOOKS TO KEEP THE AXE ON THE FARM 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
s
ometimes, it's best to just move on.
After falling flat on the national stage last
weekend, the Cardinal looks to regain its feet
against Cal, which is riding a two-game win
streak and looking to spoil the Cardinal's BCS
hopes in its last Pac-12 game of the year.

If the No. 9 Cardinal (9-1, 7-1 Pac-12)
hopes to avoid being upset by the suddenly
streaking Bears (6-4,3-4), it will need to im
prove on, well, everything from last week.
The Cardinal had a season-high five
turnovers, gave up a season-high five sacks
and 53 points, scored a season-low 30
points and had a season-low 129 rushing
yards.
"We really didn't come up with much

good things about that game," redshirt
freshman linebacker A.J. Tarpley dead
panned, but he said that the tough loss had
n't sent the Cardinal fully back to the draw
ing board.
"I wouldn't say it's like a reset for our
season, I kind of feel like we reset our men
tality every week," he said. "It's the same
when we try not to hang on the highs of the
wins too long. The USC game, for example,

we kind of reset. Yeah, it's a great win; we
got to enjoy it. But Sunday and Monday
you're preparing for the next game, prepar
ing for Oregon State."
But if Stanford wants to bounce back in
emphatic fashion and take back-to-back
games from the Bears for the first time in a
decade, it might have to fight out a defen
sive struggle for the first time all season.
Led by seniors Mychal Kendricks (75

tackles), D.J. Holt (71 tackles) and Sean
Cattouse (54 tackles), the Cal defense is
ranked first in the Pac-12 in total defense,
giving up only 319.1 yards per game the
only team with a better defensive mark
than the Cardinal in the conference.
That said, the two defenses don't exact
ly do things the same way. Cal holds passers
