# CROSS COUNTRY
## Card faces final test at NCAAs MEN, WOMEN TO RACE MONDAY 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
For the past four years, senior
Chris Derrick's dream has been to
help his men's cross country team
win an NCAA championship.
After three top-10 finishes for the
team both of which came with
the Cardinal entering the champi
onship meet ranked No. 1 in the
country and included top-seven
finishes for Derrick it's now or
never for the Naperville, 111. native
who will lead No. 6 Stanford into
battle on Monday against one of
the strongest fields in recent years

in Terre Haute, Ind.
Just after that race concludes,
junior Kathy Kroeger and redshirt
senior Stephanie Marcy will take
their No. 13 women's side out in
search of the program's sixth
NCAA title, but its first since the
Cardinal's remarkable run of four
national championships in five
years from 2003-07.
It won't be easy for either side,
due to a variety of internal and ex
ternal factors.

On the men's side, no one can
quite predict how the competition
will shape up. There are six teams
that most agree have the talent to
possibly take the title, and Stanford
falls into that group along with No.
1 Wisconsin, No. 2 Oklahoma
State, No. 3 BYU, No. 4 Oklahoma
and No. 5 Colorado.
The Cowboys are two-time de
fending national champions on
the LaVern Gibson Championship
Course and have five All-Ameri
cans, all of whom have been run
ning very well of late. But the Bad
gers are the top-ranked team right
now, and with their performance
at the Great Lakes Regional
the team's top-five runners all
crossed the finish line together to
win the race handily all signs
point to a fierce fight on Monday
morning.

Stanford clearly has two of the
top runners in the country in Der
rick and fellow senior Jake Riley,
who finished sixth place individu

ally at last year's NCAAs, one spot
behind Derrick. And redshirt sen
ior Brendan Gregg has found the
top-form that made him a danger
ous runner as a sophomore and
junior, turning in some very fast
times after recovering from an in
jury that kept him out all last sea
son.
But the Cardinal needs more if
it wants to hang with the depth
that some of the other teams bring
to the table.
In the Pac-12 Championships,
the Buffs sneaked past the Card
by a mere three points thanks to a
big gap between the fourth and
fifth-place finishers for Stanford.
Freshman Joe Rosa might be
the one fighting to keep the team
in the race as that fifth runner, as
he turned in a very nice 19th-place
performance at the Western Re
gionals. Or it could be sophomore
Erik Olson, who finished in 12th
place at the Pac-12 meet, but
slipped back a few spots at Re
gional.
Either way, the race is likely to
be one of the closest in years, and
it will be very interesting to see
what Derrick does in the battle for
the individual crown. Arizona
freshman Lawi Lalang has twice
run away from the field halfway
through the Pac-12 and Regionals
meets, and Derrick has come up
short trying to reel him in both
times while still trying to pick up
his teammates.

If Lalang, who is the odds-on
favorite in the individual race,
makes a similar move, or if lona
standout Lenny Korir tries to sep
arate himself early, it will be inter
esting to see if Derrick tries to stay
with them and pull out all the
stops to try and win an individual
title, or if he waits a little longer to
help his teammates with a more
strategic race.
A similar conflict might shape
up for Kroeger on the women's
side. Stanford is unlikely to chal
lenge for the overall title, as Flori
da State, Vanderbilt and a couple
other programs appear to have too
much depth for the Card to over
come this season.
But Kroeger finished seventh
at the Regionals in a comfortable
race, and was second at the ultra
competitive Pac-12s. She and
Marcy, who was seventh at the
conference meet, will likely be up
front with the leaders, but there
could be some space going back to
freshman Aisling Cuffe and junior
Claire Durkin, who round out
Stanford's scorers.

It will all shape up on race day,
with the gun for the men's 10K
going off just after 11 a.m. PST, and
the women toeing the starting line
just before 12 p.m. PST. Both races
will be available to stream online
at NCAA.com

performance at the Western Re
gionals. Or it could be sophomore
Erik Olson, who finished in 12th
place at the Pac-12 meet, but
slipped back a few spots at Re
gional.
Either way, the race is likely to
be one of the closest in years, and
it will be very interesting to see
what Derrick does in the battle for
the individual crown. Arizona
freshman Lawi Lalang has twice
run away from the field halfway
through the Pac-12 and Regionals
meets, and Derrick has come up
short trying to reel him in both
times while still trying to pick up
his teammates.

If Lalang, who is the odds-on
favorite in the individual race,
makes a similar move, or if lona
standout Lenny Korir tries to sep
arate himself early, it will be inter
esting to see if Derrick tries to stay
with them and pull out all the
stops to try and win an individual
title, or if he waits a little longer to
help his teammates with a more
strategic race.
A similar conflict might shape
up for Kroeger on the women's
side. Stanford is unlikely to chal
lenge for the overall title, as Flori
da State, Vanderbilt and a couple
other programs appear to have too
much depth for the Card to over
come this season.
But Kroeger finished seventh
at the Regionals in a comfortable
race, and was second at the ultra
competitive Pac-12s. She and
Marcy, who was seventh at the
conference meet, will likely be up
front with the leaders, but there
could be some space going back to
freshman Aisling Cuffe and junior
Claire Durkin, who round out
Stanford's scorers.

It will all shape up on race day,
with the gun for the men's 10K
going off just after 11 a.m. PST, and
the women toeing the starting line
just before 12 p.m. PST. Both races
will be available to stream online
at NCAA.com
