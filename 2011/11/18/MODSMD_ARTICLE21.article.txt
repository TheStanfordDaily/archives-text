## Card faces final test at NCAAs MEN, WOMEN TO RACE MONDAY 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
For the past four years, senior
Chris Derrick's dream has been to
help his men's cross country team
win an NCAA championship.
After three top-10 finishes for the
team both of which came with
the Cardinal entering the champi
onship meet ranked No. 1 in the
country and included top-seven
finishes for Derrick it's now or
never for the Naperville, 111. native
who will lead No. 6 Stanford into
battle on Monday against one of
the strongest fields in recent years

in Terre Haute, Ind.
Just after that race concludes,
junior Kathy Kroeger and redshirt
senior Stephanie Marcy will take
their No. 13 women's side out in
search of the program's sixth
NCAA title, but its first since the
Cardinal's remarkable run of four
national championships in five
years from 2003-07.
It won't be easy for either side,
due to a variety of internal and ex
ternal factors.

On the men's side, no one can
quite predict how the competition
will shape up. There are six teams
that most agree have the talent to
possibly take the title, and Stanford
falls into that group along with No.
1 Wisconsin, No. 2 Oklahoma
