# Really, really Big Game
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
I can't really speak to many spe
cific Carclinal-football-related
anecdotes before 1998, but as
far as Big Games go, tomor
row's showdown is perhaps
the most important one I've seen over
the last 14 years, at least from a Stan
ford perspective.
It's more important than the 2008
shellacking in Berkeley that left the
Cardinal one win shy of its first bowl in
seven years, or Stanford's dramatic win
in 2000 in the series' first overtime
game, or last year's dominant 48-14 vic
tory to preserve the Cardinal's hopes
for a BCS at-large bid. And I'd argue
that it's even more important than the
31-13 win in 1999 to secure Stanford's
first trip to Pasadena in 28 years.
That's because, if you haven't
heard. Cardinal football fans are
down in the dumps right now. And jus
tifiably so. College football is cyclical,
and with Andrew Luck just two regu
lar-season games from leaving the
Farm, there's good reason to believe
that this year is Stanford's peak, at
least for now. After letting last week's
hyped-up game slip away literally
Stanford's national title dreams are
practically gone, and a Rose Bowl
berth would be a stretch as well.
Sure, a BCS bowl is likely to pick
up the Cardinal as long as it wins out.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again:
