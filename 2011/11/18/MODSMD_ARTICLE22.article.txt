# Really, really Big Game
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
I can't really speak to many spe
cific Carclinal-football-related
anecdotes before 1998, but as
far as Big Games go, tomor
row's showdown is perhaps
the most important one I've seen over
the last 14 years, at least from a Stan
ford perspective.
It's more important than the 2008
shellacking in Berkeley that left the
Cardinal one win shy of its first bowl in
seven years, or Stanford's dramatic win
in 2000 in the series' first overtime
game, or last year's dominant 48-14 vic
tory to preserve the Cardinal's hopes
for a BCS at-large bid. And I'd argue
that it's even more important than the
31-13 win in 1999 to secure Stanford's
first trip to Pasadena in 28 years.
That's because, if you haven't
heard. Cardinal football fans are
down in the dumps right now. And jus
tifiably so. College football is cyclical,
and with Andrew Luck just two regu
lar-season games from leaving the
Farm, there's good reason to believe
that this year is Stanford's peak, at
least for now. After letting last week's
hyped-up game slip away literally
Stanford's national title dreams are
practically gone, and a Rose Bowl
berth would be a stretch as well.
Sure, a BCS bowl is likely to pick
up the Cardinal as long as it wins out.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again:
If you know anything about Stanford
football history, you should be pleas
antly surprised whenever you finish in
the top-10 two years in a row.
But I'm sorry. The Orange Bowl is
not the Rose Bowl; the Fiesta Bowl is
not the Rose Bowl. If this season ends
anywhere but Pasadena, it's going to
feel like a missed opportunity for
Stanford football fans.
Add that to the increasing number
of East-coast biased, uninformed
"pundits" who are going to couple
Luck's marginal performance against
the Ducks with highly irrelevant sta
tistical analysis to try and throw him
off the Heisman pedestal he so de
serves (Toby Gerhart, you have com
pany), while ignoring the injuries to
two of his best targets and the
dropped passes by those receivers
who did make it onto the field, and
this is starting to feel like crisis time.
That's what makes the 114 th Big
Game so important. I don't want to
see Stanford beat Cal; I want to see
Stanford destroy Cal behind six
touchdown passes, 400 rushing yards,
two sacks apiece for each of our start
ing linebackers, multiple pick-sixes
from the dynamic Michael Thomas
and at least one dominant run by
Luck. If there was ever a game where
margin of victory really mattered, it's
this one. Cardinal fans need catharsis,
and we need it now.

I have a strong suspicion that Stan
ford football players need catharsis
too. And an even stronger suspicion
that they're going to get it tomorrow.

Cal may have the best total de
fense â€” and, perhaps more impor
tantly, the best pass defense in the
Pac-12. Remember last year, when
the Bears looked to stifle the Stanford
attack on a cold, rainy day in Memor
ial Stadium behind a defense that led
the conference in the same two cate
gories'? Cal surely had forgotten that
little bit of information by the time
the Cardinal jumped out to a 45-0
lead in the third quarter.
Cal may have the best brother tan
dem in the Pac-12 between quarter
back Zach Maynard and receiver
Keenan Allen. That doesn't hide the
fact that Maynard is easily Cal's least
accurate starting passer in years,
struggling for 14 touchdowns and 11
interceptions this season.
And Cal may be facing Luck on
the downswing, after just his sixth loss
as a starting quarterback. But Luck is
4-1 in the games after those previous
five defeats, throwing seven touch
downs and an average of over 250
yards per game.
Rivalry games are way too unpre
dictable for me to say that the Cardi
nal should run away with this one. But
if there was ever a time when this
Stanford team and this Stanford
fan base could use a blowout, it's
now.

You don't have to look back very
far to find bowl-less seasons that Car
dinal fans considered successes as
long as the year ended in a Big Game
win. We're past that era, yet this Big
Game is still much bigger than most.

Joseph has a remarkably good
memory of past Big Games, consid
ering that he is only a freshman.
