# BORRELLI DUELS WITH DAD
## 
### PALANI ESWARAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming off two impressive home wins
against Cat State Bakersfield and Menlo Col
lege this past weekend, the Cardinal wrestling
team will travel to Chattanooga,Tenn. this Sun
day to take on the Central Michigan Chippe
was, then do battle with the Mocs from the Uni

versity of Tennessee at Chattanooga.
Both Central Michigan and Chattanooga (1-
1) have had exceptional programs for at least
the past decade. Under head coach Tom Bor
relli, the Chippewas have won twelve Mid-
American Conference (MAC) regular season
titles and thirteen MAC Tournament champi
onships. Meanwhile, the Mocs haven't lost a
Southern Conference dual since 2004 and

haven't lost a conference dual at home since
2003.

The Card has a recent history with both of
these schools. Last season, Chattanooga came
to the Farm, and Stanford was able to pull out a
close victory. The Mocs will surely be looking
for revenge.

Stanford wrestling head coach Jason Borrelli will see familiar competition this weekend, as his squad takes on a Central Michigan team that is coached
by his father, Tom Borrelli. The Card will also take on Tennessee-Chattanooga in the away meet, as it looks to extend its five-match winning streak.
The last time the Cardinal
wrestled the Chippewas, the out
come was not so positive. Central
Michigan destroyed Stanford, and
while the Cardinal wrestlers
would love to repay the favor, the
task won't be easy.
"This is going to be a real good
test for us," said Stanford head
coach Jason Borrelli. "Both those
teams are very well coached.
Chattanooga always wrestles hard
and will come out ready to wres
tle, and CMU is a top-fifteen
[team], year-in and year-out.
These should be two good dual
meets."
Chattanooga is returning three
wrestlers who have won the
Southern Conference champi

onship senior Brandon Wright
at 165 pounds, junior Josh Condon
at 174 pounds and junior Robert
Prigmore at 184 pounds. Those
will be tough matches for redshirt
freshman Matt Schneider (1-3),
redshirt senior Nick
Amuchastegui (5-0) and redshirt
junior Spence Patrick (4-1).
Central Michigan's team is full
of new faces with twenty-four
freshmen on the Chippewas' ros
ter. Despite its youth, the team
cannot be taken lightly. Senior
133-pounder Scotti Sentes is a two
time All-American, as is 184-
pounder Ben Bennett. Mean
while, true freshman Nick
Hodgkins came into this season as
the nation's top-ranked recruit at
149 pounds and won the Michigan
State Open earlier this season.
Sentes should give junior Ryan
Mango (5-0), No. 6 in the nation,
his first true test of the season.
And Hodgkins and Bennett will

be tough matchups for redshirt
juniors Timmy Boone and Spence
Patrick.

An interesting twist to this
weekend's matchup is that Stan
ford's Jason Borrelli will be
coaching not only against his alma
mater Central Michigan, but also
his father Tom, a legend for what
he has done for the school's
wrestling program. After losing to
his dad a couple of years ago in
Saginaw, Borrelli is definitely
fired up for this matchup.
"It's an interesting dynamic.
When the match isn't going on,
we're father and son," Borrelli
said with a grin on his face. "But
once we start, I'm competitive."
The Cardinal will head to
Chattanooga on Sunday, Nov. 20
to face Central Michigan at 9 a.m.
and Chattanooga at 11 a.m.
