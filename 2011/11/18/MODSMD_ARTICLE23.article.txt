# BORRELLI DUELS WITH DAD
## 
### PALANI ESWARAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming off two impressive home wins
against Cat State Bakersfield and Menlo Col
lege this past weekend, the Cardinal wrestling
team will travel to Chattanooga,Tenn. this Sun
day to take on the Central Michigan Chippe
was, then do battle with the Mocs from the Uni

versity of Tennessee at Chattanooga.
Both Central Michigan and Chattanooga (1-
1) have had exceptional programs for at least
the past decade. Under head coach Tom Bor
relli, the Chippewas have won twelve Mid-
American Conference (MAC) regular season
titles and thirteen MAC Tournament champi
onships. Meanwhile, the Mocs haven't lost a
Southern Conference dual since 2004 and

haven't lost a conference dual at home since
2003.

The Card has a recent history with both of
these schools. Last season, Chattanooga came
to the Farm, and Stanford was able to pull out a
close victory. The Mocs will surely be looking
for revenge.

Stanford wrestling head coach Jason Borrelli will see familiar competition this weekend, as his squad takes on a Central Michigan team that is coached
by his father, Tom Borrelli. The Card will also take on Tennessee-Chattanooga in the away meet, as it looks to extend its five-match winning streak.
