NO. 9 STANFORD (9-1,7-1 PAC-12]
CALIFORNIA (6-4,3-4 PAC-123

MILES BENNETT-SMITH
STANFORD 49, CAL 24: Talking to players at
practice this week, no one wants to bring up last week's
loss against Oregon. And why would they? There were
no moral victories to be taken as the Ducks whipped the
Cardinal all over the field. That being said, I cannot be
lieve that Stanford won't come out fired up at home for
Andrew Luck and the senior class' last chance to win
the Axe. I see Cal scoring on a defense that is still beat
up, but even if the Bears'solid run defense holds up for
the first half, David Shaw will go to the air. And I think
Luck is set to have a much better game. In the second
half, look for the Cardinal to start rolling it up.
JACOB JAFFE
STANFORD 52, CAL 13: I can see two possible
reactions to last week's humbling loss to Oregon: 1)
coming out flat with an emotional hangover and slog
ging through a tough game against a rival or 2) coming
out angry and using every pent-up frustration to punish
the team Stanford hates most. Judging by what I've
seen from Shaw & Co., I find the second option much
more likely. Last year, Cal had not allowed more than 17
points in a home game until Luck and the offense
scored 45 in three quarters at the former trash-heap
known as Memorial Stadium. This year, the Cardinal
should be even more motivated, and with the talent dif
ferential already heavily in Stanford's favor, motivation is
probably Cal's only hope. Cal is the worst passing team
in the Pac-12 and has allowed at least 31 points in every
road game this year. This Big Game will be no contest.
JACK BLANCHAT
STANFORD 41, CAL 1 : Stanford is better than
Cal in absolutely every facet of the game, so I don't see
any way that the Cardinal drops this contest. I expect a big
rebound in particular from the Stanford defense, which
should take advantage of Zach Maynard's awfulness and
force some big turnovers early in this game, allowing Luck
and the Luckettes to rack up points early on and cruise to
a win. I also expect to see the offense open up the play
book a little bit this weekend as the Cardinal offense suf
fered from a lack of big plays that could have kept the
game close last week. Look for a good amount of the Wild
cat formation and some bombs down the field from Luck.
