# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
## There is no place like home 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last night at Maples Pavilion, the Old
Dominion women's basketball team was
blown away by Stanford 97-48 in an answer
to the Cardinal's first two close games of the
season.

While Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer was awarded the Naismith
Women's College Coach of the Year award
for last year's season on the court just min
utes before the start, Old Dominion (0-3)
could not have begun this game in a worse
manner. Committing its first mistake before
tip-off, an administrative technical foul for
not turning in its starting line-up on time, it
was down by two points scored from the
line by sophomore guard Toni Kokenis even
before the Ogwumike sisters, senior forward
Nnemkadi and sophomore forward Chiney,
combined to score the first real points of the con
test.
It was an ominous sign, not only would Stan
ford (3-0) set up a 32-point lead (56-24) by the
half, the Lady Monarchs would also commit 11
more fouls in the first period, allowing the Card
to add nine uncontested points from the free
throw line.
"With a team like this you can't let them start
off strong, and that's what happened," said Old
Dominion head coach Karen Barefoot. "They
were in the zone, and they were hitting shots con
stantly."
Barefoot later said she noticed that her team's
inexperience caught up with them on the court.
"Some of them were overwhelmed, some of
our freshmen, you could tell," she said. "Tonight
we played with three or four freshmen on the
court at times."
But that is a difficult comparison to make.The
Card played all six freshmen last night, five of
them getting over ten minutes of game time
each. In fact, throughout most of the second half
Stanford's big players sat unneeded on the side
lines.
"Obviously Nneka had a phenomenal game
against Gonzaga." explained VanDerveer. "She's
a great player, but we're a lot more than just one
player. That's what I think we saw tonight."
Stepping up to illustrate that fact, senior
guard Lindy La Rocque had a career-high 15
points with five buckets from beyond the arc in
the first period alone. Her performance capped
an impressive total of 36 points by Cardinal play
ers from outside the line.
"Three-point shooting is definitely conta
gious," explained La Rocque. "[Freshman for
ward] Taylor [Greenfield] made those two right
off the bat, and it was just kind of like setting the
tone. When you see someone else making shots it
gives you confidence too."
The big lead allowed VanDerveer to show that
confidence in her younger players, letting them
gain experience before next Monday's clash with
No. 4 Connecticut on the road, which will surely
be a crucial point early on in this season.
"The experience is what will be different,"
said Nnemkadi Ogwumike looking ahead. "We
are both very young teams."
The game against the Huskies will certainly
be a less one-sided affair than last night's con
test, but with both teams having graduated key
players, this may offer an ideal opportunity for
the Card to follow up on last year's victory and
defeat UConn on its own hardwood.
"With the loss of [forward] Maya [Moore] it is
a little bit different," explained Nnemkadi Og
wumike. "But we lost [forward] Kayla [Peder
sen] and [forward] Jeanette [Pohlen] as well. So
right now we really dealing with finding our
niche as a team and understanding how we
work."
Last night's contest was a good warm-up, but
Monday's contest will be a pivotal lesson for this
young team. The matchup will be on Monday,
Nov. 21 at 4:30 p.m. PST, at UConn.

Junior forward Joslyn Tinkle notched 12 points and seven rebounds in just 18 minutes of play in Thursday night's blowout victory over
Old Dominion. Tinkle was one of five Cardinal players in double figures, as early domination allowed for 15 different Stanford
players, including all six freshmen, to see time on the floor.
