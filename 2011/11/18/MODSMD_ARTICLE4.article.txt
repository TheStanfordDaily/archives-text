# TOUGH ROAD LIES AHEAD
## Card hosts South Carolina in NCAAs 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
When this weekend is all
said and done, the Stanford
women's soccer team will be
embarking on either the sec
ond half of its potential NCAA
Championship run or the very
beginnings of yet another dis
appointing offseason. It takes
six postseason victories to take
home the College Cup, and the
No. 1 Cardinal (20-0-1, 11-0-0
Pac-12) can notch wins number
two and three at home on Fri
day and Sunday, respectively.
Stanford has reached the
NCAA Final Four every year

since 2007, but the squad can't
take the early rounds for grant
ed.

"There are a lot of strong
opponents out there, so we've
got to perform at our highest
level," said head coach Paul
Ratcliffe. "That's basically the
key. We've got to play well and
then execute in the final third."
The Cardinal should be at
least moderately concerned in
the latter regard going into
tonight's match against South
Carolina (16-6-0, 9-2-0 SEC).
Despite pounding outmatched
Montana (6-12-4) with 13 shots
on goal in the first round of the
postseason last Friday, Stan
ford was only able to get on the
board three times in a game

The No. 1 Stanford women's soccer team will take on South Carolina in
the second round of the NCAA Tournament this weekend. The Card has
made every Final Four since 2007 but has not won a title in that span.
blowout. Senior forward Lindsay
Taylor notched a goal and an assist
in 72 minutes of action, but was
stonewalled by junior Grizzly
goalie Kristen Hoon on three
other occasions. The squad also
had trouble finding the net despite
controlling play in the season fi
nale against Cal, a 2-0 win that saw
the Cardinal score both of its goals
in a 40-second span.
Stanford hasn't played two
matches on a weekend since late
October, and if the team wants to
continue into the fourth round of
the postseason or even make it
to the third-round game this Sun
day, for that matter it will need
to look sharper against the
tougher competition it will in
evitably face.
"We're ready for it," said soph
omore goalkeeper Emily Oliver.
"We had a couple of tough training
sessions on Sunday in preparation
for the two-game weekend that's
coming up, so I think we're ready
to go."

Tonight, Stanford's toughness
will be tested against South Caroli
na in the late game at Cagan Stadi
um. The Gamecocks' tight style of
soccer has held opponents to just
16 goals on the season, and al
though South Carolina might not
put up flashy offensive numbers, it
does sport senior forward Kayla
Grimsley the only current Divi
sion-I player with more than 40
goals and 30 assists on her career.
Oliver may have faced some of
the country's best offenses in Pac
-12 play, but as the tournament pro
gresses she's going to have to deal
with even more powerful attacks.
And though Oliver has the best
goals-against average in the coun
try (0.24), the defensive battle is
not a one-woman effort.

"Our back line is awesome, our
midfielders are great and defend
ing starts with the forwards," Oliv

er said. "Having everyone in front
of me just gives me confidence, and
I think we've prepared all season
[for the tournament]."
Offensively, the Cardinal needs
to receive continued contributions
from Taylor, who has scored 10
goals over the past eight games
and was named Pac-12 Player of
the Year. While 13 other Stanford
players have gotten on the board
this season, none has scored more
than half as many goals as the star
senior, whose six game-winning
tallies also lead the team.

After they lost in the College
Cup Final in devastating fashion
two years in a row and then
bounced back and carry the squad
during the second half of the con
ference season in 2011, expect
Stanford's quartet of seniors to set
the tone this weekend.

"They're all great leaders, and
they want to get back to that cham
pionship game and correct things,
win that national title," Ratcliffe
said. "There's no doubt in my mind
that they're inspired and want to
win the whole thing."

Should the Cardinal advance
past the Gamecocks, it will face the
winner of the Friday-afternoon
match between Boston College
(12-5-2, 6-4-0 ACC) and Cal (12-6-
3, 5-4-2 Pac-12). A Cal-Stanford
showdown in the wake of Big
Game weekend would surely be yet
another heated chapter in this in
tense rivalry.
"That would be interesting ...
but regardless of who we play, I
think we'll be ready to go," Oliver
said. "If it's Cal, great, and if it's
Boston College, great. But we've
got to make it there first."
That quest begins tonight at 7
p.m. at Cagan Stadium, with the
Cardinal still riding an 84-match
unbeaten streak when scoring at
least one goal and a 47-match win
streak overall. The winners of
tonight's two games will then meet
on Sunday at 1 p.m. in search of an
appearance in the quarterfinals.
