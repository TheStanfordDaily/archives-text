## Well done, Watson! EVENTS Stanford vs. Cal Quiz Bowl features IBM's Watson The 						electronic Jeopardy champion dominated, beating both teams 
### MARGARET RAWSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford and UC-Berkeley Quiz Bowl teams
matched wits Thursday evening against each other and a
formidable opponent the IBM Watson "supercom
puter," capable of answering questions posed in natural
language.
The Jeopardy-style competition demonstrated the
technology behind the powerful supercomputer "Wat
son," named after IBM founder Thomas J.Watson.
Stanford's team was represented by Nico Martinez
'O7, J.D. 'l3, Benji Nguyen 'l5 and Bill Rowan, a comput
er science graduate student.
"My assumption is that Watson will beat us," Rowan
said before the competition. According to Rowan, the
student teams had an advantage "parsing and under
standing the questions," while Watson held the advan
tage in buzzer speed, "which turns out to be crucial."
"It's David and Goliath," said Jack Dubie 'll, a com
puter science graduate student who helped organize the
event.
"The stakes could not be higher," Rowan joked. "It's
the future of the human race."
The game, moderated by Todd Crain who has
moderated more than 100 matches between Watson and
humans was preceded by a presentation by Eric
Brown, an IBM research scientist.
"It's not about the game," Brown said of the long
term goals following Watson's early success. "It's about
the technology and what we're going to do with it."

The Stanford Quiz Bowl team faced off against Cal in CEMEX auditorium on Thursday, joined on stage by IBM's Watson.
"We're all familiar with the ex
pert as a librarian," Brown said,
adding that librarians are not al
ways accessible and do not have the
same deep understanding of a wide
range of content that Watson
achieves.
According to Brown, Watson of
fers precise answers, a fast response
time and "accurate confidences"
and "consumable justifications" for
those answers.
Brown described future applica
tions of Watson's automatic open
domain question answering, from
business and commercial applica
tions to healthcare innovations in
differential diagnosis. Overall, he
described the goal of the develop
ing technology as striving "to help
people make better decisions."
Watson is just very good at win
ning at Jeopardy. After testing
against past Tournament of Cham
pions contestants during a demon
stration stage, Watson played and
won on national television this past
February against Ken Jennings, the
longest championship streak
record holder, and Brad Rutter, the
show's biggest money winner.
Brown described the complexity
of natural language and the meth
ods Watson, which uses 90 IBM
power servers, employs to parse
questions, such as determining key
words and the desired answer form.
"I'm completely unbiased here,"
Brown said before the competition.
"I don't care who comes in second."
"I smell fear," Crain said, as he
welcomed the teams to the stage.
After a series of questions dom
inated completely by Watson, Crain
added, "You're off to a bad start."
After two categories of single
Jeopardy and with both human
teams expressing slight frustration,
the Berkeley team finally managed
to beat Watson to the buzzer.
IBM scientists have been able to
cut down Watson's response rate to
the average Jeopardy contestant
time frame of fewer than three sec
onds, combined with high precision
and number of questions answered.
If the computer does not find an an
swer that crosses its confidence
threshold, it will not buzz in. During
the game, audience members were
able to see Watson's top three an

swer choices and corresponding
confidence percentages.
While both teams managed to
enter the game during the first
round, Watson took a strong lead
and benefited from the "Daily
Double." Stanford, after a detour in
the red, trailed Berkeley.
During the second round, one
clear shortcoming of the computer
became clear. After the Berkeley

team answered a question incor
rectly, Watson repeated the same
response.
At another point, Watson had a
delay in choosing the next category
after answering a question correct
ly-
"Remember, its Watson super
computer, but Microsoft software,"
said Bernie Meyerson, vice presi
dent of innovation and global uni
versity relations for IBM.
Going into final Jeopardy, de
spite successes for both student
teams, the score stood at $B,BOO for
Stanford, $16,400 for Berkeley and
$33,300 for Watson.
All three teams answered the
final question on 20th century
thinkers correctly, and the final
order remained the same.
Following the competition,
Brown responded to questions and
described some of Watson's tools,
such as a pun filter and a vulgarity
filter. Audience members posed
questions about the fairness of the
game, particularly about buzzer
speed and whether the competition
was biased.
"I would say that understanding
natural language is rigged in the hu
mans' favor," Brown said.
