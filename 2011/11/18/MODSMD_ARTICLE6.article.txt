## Well done, Watson! EVENTS Stanford vs. Cal Quiz Bowl features IBM's Watson The
						electronic Jeopardy champion dominated, beating both teams 
### MARGARET RAWSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford and UC-Berkeley Quiz Bowl teams
matched wits Thursday evening against each other and a
formidable opponent the IBM Watson "supercom
puter," capable of answering questions posed in natural
language.
The Jeopardy-style competition demonstrated the
technology behind the powerful supercomputer "Wat
son," named after IBM founder Thomas J.Watson.
Stanford's team was represented by Nico Martinez
'O7, J.D. 'l3, Benji Nguyen 'l5 and Bill Rowan, a comput
er science graduate student.
"My assumption is that Watson will beat us," Rowan
said before the competition. According to Rowan, the
student teams had an advantage "parsing and under
standing the questions," while Watson held the advan
tage in buzzer speed, "which turns out to be crucial."
"It's David and Goliath," said Jack Dubie 'll, a com
puter science graduate student who helped organize the
event.
"The stakes could not be higher," Rowan joked. "It's
the future of the human race."
The game, moderated by Todd Crain who has
moderated more than 100 matches between Watson and
humans was preceded by a presentation by Eric
Brown, an IBM research scientist.
"It's not about the game," Brown said of the long
term goals following Watson's early success. "It's about
the technology and what we're going to do with it."
