## ASSU launches Peer-to-Peer Advocacy Senator spearheads developing initiative 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU has launched a new
peer-to-peer advocacy program in
tended to connect students with
members of the ASSU who can help
solve problems students have with
the University.
According to its founder, Senator
Dan DeLong 'l3, the program fills a
gap in the current responsibilities of
the ASSU by providing constituent
services.
"If you look at elected officials at a
local level, a state level and even at
the national level, a large part of their
responsibility is to provide con
stituent services," DeLong said.
These services can include advo
cating on behalf of students with ad
ministrators and trying to solve their
problems.
The idea for this program came to
DeLong during his senate campaign.
During that process, multiple stu
dents requested help settling small fi
nancial disputes with the University,
mostly related to billing and fees. De-
Long was able to help them by email
ing these administrators on the stu
dents' behalf.
"I don't think students are aware

[they] can come to ASSU representa
tives in the Exec or the Senate to help
get their Stanford-related issues re
solved," DeLong said.
After acquiring $7O in funding
from the Undergraduate Senate's
discretionary fund, business cards
with a phone number and email ad
dress were printed and handed out to
senators at Tuesday's Senate meeting.
"Right now the ASSU does an in
credibly poor job of reaching out to
students," DeLong said, adding that
he hopes that by partnering with the
ASSU Executive, students will take
advantage of this program.
The program's aspirations are
strikingly similar to those of The Stan
ford Ombuds, which also seeks to
help students, as well as faculty and
administrators, solve conflicts on
campus. However DeLong says this
program will not be a mediation serv
ice like The Ombuds.
"This is what I call a facilitation
service," DeLong said. "Students will
feel more comfortable coming to a
peer for help and advice than going to
someone they see as another member
of University staff."

DeLong concedes that senators
have no real experience in these is
sues. However, he says that members
of the ASSU can learn on the job and
use their network of administrative
contacts to help students.
Like The Ombuds, this program is
intended to be confidential, protect

ing students' information. However
the ASSU has strict policies regard
ing confidentiality, which could make
this aspect of the program difficult to
carry out.
One potential solution to the
problem would be passing a bill label
ing all information in this program,
"proprietary business information"
and thus removing it from the scope
of the Freedom of Information Act;
however, this approach was aban
doned.
Instead, the names of the students
and the representatives who received
their call will be available for anyone
who requests the information, but
their conversations will be private.
The program will only initially be
accessible via DeLong, ASSU Execu
tive President Michael Cruz 'l2 and
Vice President Stewart Macgregor-
Dennis 'l3, Senate Chair Rafael
Vazquez 'l2, Senate Deputy Chair
Dan Ashton 'l4 and Senator Brianna
Pang 'l3 of the Advocacy committee.
The number of people with access
may expand as more senators express
interest. However DeLong said he
only wants active participants to have
access to the account.
Emails inquiring about the pro
gram can be sent to help@assu.stan
ford.edu, and calls or texts to 650-468-
0195.
