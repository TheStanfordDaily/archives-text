## Scientists use E. coli for more effective biofuels 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO 
Two Stanford researchers have
found away to use E. coli to pro
duce biodiesel fuel. Xingye Yu, a
Ph.D. candidate, and Tiangang Liu,
a post-doctoral student, recently
used E. coli to model fatty acid syn
thesis in vitro, yielding fatty acid de
rivatives that can be converted into
biodiesel.
"These findings reinforce our
earlier conclusion that, among
these metabolites, only the intracel
lular concentration of malonyl-
CoA is likely to be an attractive tar
get for further engineering, if the
goal is to improve fatty acid yield
and/or productivity," Yu wrote in an
email to The Daily.
There is a scene in "Back to the
Future II" when Doc Brown reach
es into Marty's garbage can, pulls
out a few banana peels and uses
them to power his automobile
based time machine. This type of
technology is not science fiction

anymore.
The team discovered that E.
coli's cellular machinery is useable
at points before and after a particu
lar section of the assembly line. In
particular, it could harness a partic
ular type of plant biomass called
lignocellulosic raw materials at
an earlier point in the reaction to in
crease cost-effectiveness and create
a better biodiesel alternative.
"The good news is that the en
gine that makes fatty acids in E. coli
is incredibly powerful," said Chai
tan Khosla, a professor of chemistry
and biochemistry, in an interview
with the Stanford Report. "The bad
news is this engine is subject to
some very tight controls by the
cell."
The fatty acids that the E. coli
creates cannot be directly pumped
into a car's gas tank, however they
are a precursor to biodiesel fuel.
Enzymatic reactions are like as
sembly lines, and thus, Yu says
speeding up production at a partic
ular point can impact the entire re
action rate.
"Additional research efforts are
also warranted upstream and
downstream of these biofuel syn
thesizing steps," Yu said.
Production cost, efficiency and
sustainability are the main con
cerns when producing biodiesel. Yu
and her lab's research point to E.
coli as a promising factory of
biodiesel production. They note
that E. coli's natural rate of conver
sion is not commercially viable.
However, the researchers hope to
improve this by changing its inter
nal machinery and boosting its con
version capabilities.
According to Yu, researchers
must also consider the product
yield from a specific amount of re
actant. She noted that researchers

should seek to reach the theoretical
maximal yield of 30 percent.
Reaching this yield will make E.
coli a more favored biodiesel alter
native.
"Currently only about 20 per
cent of this value is achieved," Yu
said, later adding, "We aim to in
crease the yield as high as possible
while keeping the process econom
ically sound."
Tliis process is also more sus
tainable than biodiesel production
due to a range of factors.
"There will be no competition
with food production, no
seasonal/geographical variation of
raw material supplies and no de
pendence on petrochemicals," Yu
said. "E. coli grows fast and is quite
amenable to genetic manipula
tion."
Yu and Liu's biofuel research is
currently funded by LS9, Inc., a San
Francisco-based biotech startup
that seeks to use synthetic materials
to provide sustainable products.
