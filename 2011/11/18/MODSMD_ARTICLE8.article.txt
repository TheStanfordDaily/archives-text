## Scientists use E. coli for more effective biofuels 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO 
Two Stanford researchers have
found away to use E. coli to pro
duce biodiesel fuel. Xingye Yu, a
Ph.D. candidate, and Tiangang Liu,
a post-doctoral student, recently
used E. coli to model fatty acid syn
thesis in vitro, yielding fatty acid de
rivatives that can be converted into
biodiesel.
"These findings reinforce our
earlier conclusion that, among
these metabolites, only the intracel
lular concentration of malonyl-
CoA is likely to be an attractive tar
get for further engineering, if the
goal is to improve fatty acid yield
and/or productivity," Yu wrote in an
email to The Daily.
There is a scene in "Back to the
Future II" when Doc Brown reach
es into Marty's garbage can, pulls
out a few banana peels and uses
them to power his automobile
based time machine. This type of
technology is not science fiction

anymore.
The team discovered that E.
coli's cellular machinery is useable
at points before and after a particu
lar section of the assembly line. In
particular, it could harness a partic
ular type of plant biomass called
lignocellulosic raw materials at
an earlier point in the reaction to in
crease cost-effectiveness and create
a better biodiesel alternative.
"The good news is that the en
gine that makes fatty acids in E. coli
is incredibly powerful," said Chai
tan Khosla, a professor of chemistry
and biochemistry, in an interview
with the Stanford Report. "The bad
news is this engine is subject to
some very tight controls by the
cell."
The fatty acids that the E. coli
creates cannot be directly pumped
into a car's gas tank, however they
are a precursor to biodiesel fuel.
Enzymatic reactions are like as
