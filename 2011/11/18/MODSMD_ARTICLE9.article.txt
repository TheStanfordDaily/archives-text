## Stanford researchers improve nanotube technology 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Brendan O'Byrne 
Stanford researchers have found
an effective way to sort carbon nan
otubes, making progress towards
flexible or printable electronics.

When carbon nanotubes are cre
ated, both semi-conducting and con
ducting tubes are mixed together.
Conducting tubes are used in wires
and electrodes. Semiconducting
tubes are more adept in things like
solar technologies; however, the
combination of the two makes it dif
ficult to utilize them for both purpos
es. For example, using the mixture in
electronics often causes shortages
and has stymied advances in nan
otube technology.

Zhenan Bao, Stanford associate
professor of chemical engineering,
worked with professors at Universi
ty of California-Davis and the Sam
sung Advanced Institute of Technol
ogy (SAIT) and has discovered a
way to separate the mixture and pull
out the conducting and semi-con
ducting tubes individually.
"Sorting has been a major bottle
neck for carbon nanotubes to be vi
able for practical electronics applica
tions," Bao said in an interview with
the Stanford Report. "This work
solves the problem of separating the

conducting from the semi-conduct
ing nanotubes."
Bao added a polymer to the mix
ture that only attaches itself to the
semi-conducting nanotubes, allow
ing commercially available packages
of mixed carbon nanotubes to be
separated effectively.
This is not the first polymer that is
able to sort the semi-conducting and
conducting nanotubes; however,
previous polymers have had to be re
moved before the nanotubes could
be conductive again. Bao's polymer
doesn't need to be removed and
doesn't decrease the nanotube's
conductivity.
"It merges two very important
materials together and makes a hy
brid material that could be very use
ful for printed and flexible electron
ics," Bao said.
Funding for the study came from
the SAIT and the National Science
Foundation.
