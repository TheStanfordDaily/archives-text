In association with the annual Shorenstein Journalism Award for Asia, conferred this year on China's
pioneering Caixin Media group, this panel will look at the current state and the future of the Chinese media.
The Chinese state continues to play a powerful role in controlling the media and the free flow of information
to the Chinese people. But China's media is undergoing rapid change, from the growing role of social media
to the proliferation of new publications, some of which, like Caixin, are challenging the boundaries of state
control. Which will win in China's changing media landscape—the forces of the market, state censorship or
quality journalism?
