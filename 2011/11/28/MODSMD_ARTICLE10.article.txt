## PROFILE Recasting the humanities through 'distant reading' 
### NICOLE KOFMAN 
Hidden away on the fourth floor
of Margaret Jacks Hall is the
Stanford Literary Lab, filled
not with microscopes and Bun
sen burners but instead com
puters, whiteboards and a large table.
In this laboratory, English professor
Franco Moretti and English lecturer Matt
Jockers collaborate with students to exam
ine and analyze literature using a technique
that they call "distant reading" or "macro
analysis."
As opposed to "close reading" of a text,
"distant reading" allows the Lit Lab re
searchers to analyze not just one or two
books but thousands of them at a time. This
exploratory project is made possible by a
vast reservoir of computing and library re
sources in addition to those working in the
Lab.
The Lab evolved from a workshop that
Jockers conducted in 2006 to a class he
taught in 2009 that was dedicated to the
study of digital humanities and literature in
a larger archive.
"The course description said something
like: 'in this class we will have 1,200 assigned
novels, but students won't read any of
them,'" Jockers said with a smile, "We did
end up reading some of them but not in the
way that you would traditionally read novels
in a literature class."
The class focused on computationally an
alyzing their archive of books, finding out
whether there is a "signal," or a specific word
or phrase, in the books that reveals informa
tion about their genre.
But when the quarter ended, students
had become so invested in their projects that
they wanted to continue their research. The
group formed an ad-hoc seminar that
evolved into the lab-like working environ
ment that exists today.
In the spirit of the Lit Lab's origins, stu
dents contribute to a lot of the research. One
such individual is English graduate student
Ryan Heuser M.A. 'l4 Ph.D. 'l4, a full-time
staff member working in the Lit Lab as a hu
manities research programmer. Heuser,
who has been a part of the Lit Lab since it
was founded, has a clear idea of its purpose.
