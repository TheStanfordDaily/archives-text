## PROFILE Recasting the humanities through 'distant reading' 
### NICOLE KOFMAN 
Hidden away on the fourth floor
of Margaret Jacks Hall is the
Stanford Literary Lab, filled
not with microscopes and Bun
sen burners but instead com
puters, whiteboards and a large table.
In this laboratory, English professor
Franco Moretti and English lecturer Matt
Jockers collaborate with students to exam
ine and analyze literature using a technique
that they call "distant reading" or "macro
analysis."
As opposed to "close reading" of a text,
"distant reading" allows the Lit Lab re
searchers to analyze not just one or two
books but thousands of them at a time. This
exploratory project is made possible by a
vast reservoir of computing and library re
sources in addition to those working in the
Lab.
The Lab evolved from a workshop that
Jockers conducted in 2006 to a class he
taught in 2009 that was dedicated to the
study of digital humanities and literature in
a larger archive.
"The course description said something
like: 'in this class we will have 1,200 assigned
novels, but students won't read any of
them,'" Jockers said with a smile, "We did
end up reading some of them but not in the
way that you would traditionally read novels
in a literature class."
The class focused on computationally an
alyzing their archive of books, finding out
whether there is a "signal," or a specific word
or phrase, in the books that reveals informa
tion about their genre.
But when the quarter ended, students
had become so invested in their projects that
they wanted to continue their research. The
group formed an ad-hoc seminar that
evolved into the lab-like working environ
ment that exists today.
In the spirit of the Lit Lab's origins, stu
dents contribute to a lot of the research. One
such individual is English graduate student
Ryan Heuser M.A. 'l4 Ph.D. 'l4, a full-time
staff member working in the Lit Lab as a hu
manities research programmer. Heuser,
who has been a part of the Lit Lab since it
was founded, has a clear idea of its purpose.
"The first goal is the actual re
search: to do literary, historical
work in away that doesn't presup
pose the object of study," Heuser
said. "The second goal is to con
vince the literary discipline that re
search of this kind is possible."
Though he studied literature in
graduate school, Heuser said that
he was almost a computer science
major and that he has always en
joyed programming as a hobby.
"[Jockers'j class inspired me to
put the two [disciplines] together
again," Heuser said.
Students are not the only ones
interested in this endeavor. The
success of the Literary Lab also de
pends on the enthusiasm of staff
like Glen Worthey, a digital human
ities librarian at Stanford who is
heavily involved with the Lab.
"People have been using digital
approaches to humanities for years,
but this is the first place that I know
of that is doing literary analysis on
that big of a scale," Worthey said.
"While others have analyzed the
complete works of Shake
speare or

Thomas Aqumas, none have ana
lyzed, for example, an entire centu
ry's worth of novels."
Worthey said that the Stanford
librarians are thrilled that Stan
ford's decades of investments in
digital resources are paying off in
such a tangible way.
"I think the library was really
forward thinking in believing that
owning all this [data] would be im
portant," Worthey said. "That's re
ally heartwarming for me; it's kind
of a real justification that we've
been doing the right thing."
Worthey added that the "distant
reading" the Literary Lab conducts
is in no way meant to be a replace
ment for "close reading" and tradi
tional humanities but instead sup
plements it.
Worthey said that the Lit Lab is
providing scholars with away to
deal with the books we'll never
read, literature that Moretti calls
"the great unread."
"In order to truly understand a
single text, one must understand
what else people were reading at
that time and what else was rele
vant and important," Worthey said.
"The Lit Lab takes the full literary
landscape into consideration."
Data and pamphlets aren't the
only things that the Lit Lab has to
offer to the community. Just as im
portant is the lesson those working
in the Lab have learned.
"There's no such thing as a divi
sion between 'fuzzies' and
'techies,'" Heuser said. "There's a
way to do the humanities in a
scientific, empirical manner."

Worthey added that the "distant
reading" the Literary Lab conducts
is in no way meant to be a replace
ment for "close reading" and tradi
tional humanities but instead sup
plements it.
Worthey said that the Lit Lab is
providing scholars with away to
deal with the books we'll never
read, literature that Moretti calls
"the great unread."
"In order to truly understand a
single text, one must understand
what else people were reading at
that time and what else was rele
vant and important," Worthey said.
"The Lit Lab takes the full literary
landscape into consideration."
Data and pamphlets aren't the
only things that the Lit Lab has to
offer to the community. Just as im
portant is the lesson those working
in the Lab have learned.
"There's no such thing as a divi
sion between 'fuzzies' and
'techies,'" Heuser said. "There's a
way to do the humanities in a
scientific, empirical manner."
