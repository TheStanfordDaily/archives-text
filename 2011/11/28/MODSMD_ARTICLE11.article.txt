# Q&A
## On track with Julia Landauer 
### â€“ Ethan Kessinger 
Julia Landauer 'l4 is not your typ
ical college student: when she
was 10 years old, she started rac
ing go-karts. By age 13, her ambi
tion and talent provoked her to
branch out into racing cars. And a year
later at age 14, Landauer became the
first female and the youngest driver to
win the Skip Barber Racing Series.
When she turned 17, Landauer re
ceived her NASCAR license and
today travels the country participating
in NASCAR races and events. She is
also the founder of Julia Landauer
Racing, which promotes her image
and seeks sponsors for her racing
team. As a typically busy college stu
dent, she successfully manages to bal
ance academics with her professional
racing career. The Daily spoke with
Landauer to find out more about her
experiences as both a Stanford under
grad and a racecar driver.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why did you
come to Stanford?
Julia Landauer (JL): I consider education
really important, and I was going to pursue it
anyway. [Stanford] is such a huge research
institution, which made it really attractive.
Also, the networking is incredible. Overall, it
was perfect, and it didn't hurt that it has such
nice weather.
TSD: How do you balance your racing and
your Stanford lives?
JL: It's really tough. High school was manage
able, [and] even though I went to a very com
petitive school, I got used to it. Right now, my

biggest issue is the sheer amount of time I'm in
class. All the time I am in class I can't dedicate
it to the business side of racing.
TSD: Do you need to drive every week to
stay competitive?
JL: No, it is kind of like riding a bike, it comes
back pretty quickly. But I do work out every
day strength training and endurance. De
spite my small frame, I am strong.
TSD: Do you feel that it is difficult to com
pete in such a male-dominated sport?
JL: I've had a pretty good time with it; I don't
think that I have gotten a lot of negativity. For

one, I don't exude "girliness," but overall, I
think it really comes down to proving myself
on [the] track. If they can see me as a com
petitor, then they'll see me as that a driver,
not as the girl who is a racer.
TSD:What are your current plans for racing?
JL: I'm pushing the driving 100 percent. I've
dreamed of making it to the top level of
NASCAR driving. But I am also obviously
pursuing an education and developing Julia
Landauer Racing as a brand. If the driving
doesn't work out, I am going to do something
in the industry.
