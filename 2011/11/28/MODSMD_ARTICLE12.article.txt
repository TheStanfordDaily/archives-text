## Lake Lag and the salamanders' power 
### â€“ Sierra Freeman 
Nestled between Governor's
Corner and Florence Moore
Hall is Lake Lagunita, the
"lake" that is a misnomer for
roughly three quarters of the
year. "Lake Lag," as it is commonly
called, is actually not much of a lake at all.
Lake Lag only rises naturally during
the rainy season, normally occurring dur
ing winter quarter, but the University fills
it with water when necessary to support
the California tiger salamander popula
tion that resides in the lakebed. This deci
sion was made due to the plight of these
native amphibians, according to Universi
ty archeologist Laura Jones.The salaman

der's "vulnerable" classification by the In
ternational Union for Conservation of
Nature was enough to guarantee that
measures were taken to allow for their
survival.
These precautions include monitor
ing the water level of the lake to ensure
that it's high enough to support salaman
der reproduction. Regardless of this cau
tionary measure and the natural runoff
of water from the foothills, the lake depth
only ever reaches about three feet. Ac
cording to Jones, in addition to salaman
ders, the lake also hosts a variety of
wildlife, including mallards, herons,
egrets, garden snakes and tree frogs.

These days, the lake doesn't attract
much attention from anyone besides the
native wildlife, especially after the Big
Game Bonfire, a tradition that preceded
the Big Game every year, was banned in
1997 after scientists from the Center for
Conversation Biology concluded that it
would pose a threat to the salamanders.
Nowadays, students don't hold school
wide events at the lake. Instead, it's often
the location for small club gatherings,
late-night strolls on its surrounding trail
and sunbathing during the warmer
months of the year.
