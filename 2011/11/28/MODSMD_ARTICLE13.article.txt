## EDITORIAL Stanford's Rhodes Scholars 
### 
When it comes to presti
gious awards in higher
education, nothing quite
measures up to a Rhodes Scholar
ship. This year, Stanford is lucky
enough to boast a University
record five scholarship winners,
more than any other university in
the nation this year. The students,
Aysha Bagchi 'll, Anand Habib
'll, Ishan Nath 'l2, Kate Niehaus
'lO M.S. 'll andTenzin Seldon 'l2,
will receive three years of free
study at Oxford University. (Nath
is a current writer on The Daily's
Editorial Board, and Tenzin Sel
don serves as The Daily's student
at-large. Neither student had any
involvement in the production of
this editorial.) The scholars' ac
complishments reflect primarily
their own impressive faculties, yet
it is important to remember that
their success was contingent on
taking advantage of the opportuni
ties available to them opportu
nities that Stanford assures are
available to the rest of the student
body as well.
Bagchi, Habib, Niehaus, Nath
and Seldon constitute nearly one
sixth of the 32 Americans who re
ceive the award each year. To have
a chance to win a Rhodes Scholar
ship, students must first submit an
application and earn the endorse
ment of their universities, a step
completed by 830 students in the
United States this year. Following
this step, applicants undergo inter
views that help the Rhodes Trust to
select its final set of winners.
Why should the vast majority of
students, students who will never
win a Rhodes scholarship, care
who wins the award? It is not the
award per se that most students
should aspire to, but rather the type
of accomplishment that the award
recognizes. As Stanford's Provost

John Etchemendy told the Stan
ford Report, the award winners "all
excel in areas of public service" and
"are dedicating their academic ca
reers to disciplines and interests
that will make a positive difference
for the world." Moreover, other
students should realize they have
the same professors, study options
and access to service and work op
portunities that are available to the
Rhodes scholars in their midst.
Though Stanford students
share many common resources,
there is no single or best path to the
kind of academic career that can
earn one a Rhodes Scholarship.
The diversity of the award winners
vividly demonstrates the ability of
a dedicated student to make his or
her mark regardless of background
or field of study. Stanford's winners
have received or will receive their
bachelor's degrees in philosophy
and history (Bagchi), biology
(Habib), economics and earth sys
tems (Nath), biomedical engineer
ing (Niehaus) and comparative
studies in race and ethnicity (Sel
don).This year's scholars all forged
their own path towards the award,
pursuing their own deeply held in
terests.
As an institution, Stanford
should be very proud to host or
have hosted five of this year's
Rhodes Scholars. What makes Stan
ford such a great place to study is the
degree to which it assembles high
achieving individuals in one place
where they can encourage, chal
lenge and work with each other, as
well as the degree to which Stanford
affords opportunities for service
and edifying work off campus. The
presence of so many Rhodes Schol
ars serves as an excellent proxy for
these effects and should be taken as
affirmation that Stanford continues
to function well.
