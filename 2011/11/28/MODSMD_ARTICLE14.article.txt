# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Religion: 'Freedom of' or 'Freedom from'? 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Two winter breaks ago, I
worked in a small running
shoe store in my little home
town of Gig Harbor, Wash. Snow
had gently started to fall, pepper
mint hot chocolate sales were
booming at the local Starbucks and
Christmas lights were popping up
all over nearby homes so need
less to say, I was in a cheerful, fes
tive mood as I helped customers try
on shoes and choose the best spe
cialty flavor of holiday Clif Bar.
One day that break, as I scanned
the bar code on some spiffy new
shoes for a middle-aged blond
woman, I decided to take a chance
with my newfound customer-rela
tions skills. "Happy Holidays," I said
with a smile as I handed her a brand
new pair of Nikes. The look on her
face somewhere between Rush
Limbaugh talking about Barack
Obama and Jerry Falwell fulminat
ing against the War on Christianity
immediately made me realize I'd
made a horrible, horrible mistake.
"Merry Christmas," she sniffed back
haughtily as she stormed out, mak
ing me feel like some spectacularly
ugly combination of the Grinch and
Ebenezer Scrooge.
Reasoning that I did live, after all,
in a primarily white, Christian, mid
dle-class town, I resolved to do bet
ter with the next customer, who
turned out to be an equally middle
aged brunette with a small child.
"Merry Christmas!" I grinned as I
handed her a new waterproof run
ning jacket. "Happy Holidays," she
snapped back with a glare, looking at
me as though I were some arrogant
19th-century missionary hurling fire
and brimstone from the pulpit.
As the Christmas (or holiday, if
you prefer) season approaches, I've
started thinking again about how
tricky dealing with religion can be,
both individually and as a society. It

is a subject that has divided persons
of a liberal political persuasion, like
myself, into two main camps: those
believing that we ought to be free
to choose our own religion and
those believing that society ought
to be free from religion altogether.
The latter view is appealing to
those among us who resent reli
gion's irritating tendency to clash
with the most basic values of a free
society. It is a view espoused elo
quently and forcefully by authors
like Jon Krakauer in "Under the
Banner of Heaven," Ayaan Hirsi
Ali in her provocative and widely
debated "Infidel" and the inim
itable Christopher Hitchens in
"God is not Great." And it is a view
to which I've often found myself at
tracted.
The illiberal, irrational, obscu
rantist side of organized religion
can be frustrating and even repre
hensible. It's the side that inhibits
scientific progress by promoting
"intelligent design" in the public
schools. It's the side that causes
Muslim and Jewish fundamental
ists to dig in their heels over
Jerusalem, preventing the estab
lishment of a just and lasting peace.
It's the side that prompted Islamist
assassins to target British author
Salman Rushdie for death. It's the
side that leads Fundamentalist
Mormons to take dozens of wives,
forcing girls as young as 12 into
marriages with men four times
their age. It's the side that seems in
evitably to clash with basic Enlight
enment ideas: ideas about free
speech, women's equality, scientific
inquiry, human rationality and
agency, individual freedom and in
dependent thought. And it's the
side that has sometimes led me to
think that the best society would be
a society with no religion at all a
sort of latter-day collective Temple

of Reason.
This is a view, it seems to me, that
a fair number of Stanford students
have quite understandably adopt
ed. Anti-religionism looks to be
popular across campus, from far
left liberals to far-right libertarians
and I don't blame them.
But there's another option, and
it's the option I think the founders
had in mind when they drafted the
Constitution. It's a vision of inter
faith cooperation, rather than anti
faith agitation. It's a vision that you
can see at work during the many in
terfaith services Stanford holds in
Memorial Church each year, where
Muslims, Hindus, Baha'is, Chris
tians of all denominations, Jews and
even people of no faith at all come
together to affirm common ground.
And it's a vision that I'm hopeful
will continue to grow and develop
in this nation of many faiths and be
liefs as we move forward together.
I think we're succeeding, if slow
ly and messily, in moving toward
that reality, and I hope we can con
tinue to negotiate with skill
through the thorny First Amend
ment tangles of free exercise and
non-establishment.
But most of all, I hope it won't
matter whether I say "Merry
Christmas" or "Happy Holidays" to
you this year. I promise I mean well
either way.
