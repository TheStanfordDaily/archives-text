# FRESHMAN '15
## The
						Turkey Dump 
### Bianca Chavez 
I had huge plans for my Thanksgiv
ing break. After three weeks full
of group projects and research pa
pers, the break was supposed to be a
period of almost-uninterrupted rest.
I had an entire list of activities
planned, ranging from MTV

Marathons to taking bubble baths to
gorging myself with apple pie. Ideal
ly, I'd spend the vast majority of my
time in fleece Hello Kitty pajama
pants.
At least, that's what I intended to
do.
My plans were altered when my
best friend of eight years was abrupt
ly cut loose by her boyfriend. He
cited a "change of feelings" as the
cause of their breakup.
Like so many other college girls,
my friend had become a victim of the
"Turkey Dump" defined by
Urban Dictionary as an event in
which "a student returning from col
lege breaks up with their significant
other from high school, traditionally
during Thanksgiving break."
This phenomenon has become so
common that there are dozens of
websites devoted to the Turkey
Dump. There are tips on how to tact
fully approach a breakup for the
dumpers and online support groups
for the dump-ees. There are even e
cards that you can use to break up
with your significant other if having
the conversation in person is impos
sible or too awkward to bear. (Al
though if this is your situation, I say
you at least owe your soon-to-be ex a
phone call. Dumping someone via
email makes you a bigger wimp than
the Cowardly Lion not to men
tion a total jerk.)
But what makes Thanksgiving
such a common time for breakups?
Isn't the holiday supposed to be a
time to celebrate the Pilgrim's ruth
less slaughter and conquest of the
Native Americans? What aspect of
such a merry holiday inspires thou
sands of college kids to begin flying
solo?
Well for one, it's the first time
most freshmen return home after
starting college. Many of these kids
were the ones who expected that
maintaining a long-distance relation
ship to be easier than the girl who ac
cused Justin Bieber of being her
baby-daddy. But after nearly two
months in college, some have begun
to realize that they don't really miss
their high school sweethearts.
And who can blame them? With
all the exciting new adventures col
lege brings from the insanity of
events like Full Moon to the magical
awkwardness of dormcest who
wants to be tethered to a boyfriend
or girlfriend hundreds or thousands
of miles away? Everyone knows one
person who seemed to spend the ma
jority of freshman year video chat-

ting with his girlfriend instead of ex
periencing everything college has to
offer, and few people describe that
guy as "fun."
Plus, aren't adults always telling us
that college is supposed to be about
self-discovery? How is a girl ever
supposed to discover herself when
being a "girlfriend" has been such a
large portion of her identity for so
long?
The purpose of this column is not
to say that all long-distance relation
ships are unhealthy or even that
they're all doomed to fail. But if call
ing your boyfriend fills your stomach
with more dread than your upcoming
Chem 31A midterm, maybe it's time
to begin consider a belated Turkey
Dump. But for Pete's sake, please
don't use the e-card.That's just cruel.

Let's be clear. Bianca LOVES getting
e-cards (just not ones that feature
breakup news). Why not send some
thing nice to her at blchavez@stan
ford.edu?
