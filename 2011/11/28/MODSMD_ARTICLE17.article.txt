## WOMEN'S BASKETBALL Card falls to Connecticut, beats Xavier 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While the majority of students head
ed home for Thanksgiving Break, the
No. 3 Stanford women's basketball team
set out on a road trip of its own, first
traveling to the East Coast to face No. 2
Connecticut last Monday and then on to
Ohio to square up against Xavier on Fri
day.
It was the seventh time the Cardinal
(4-1) has faced the Huskies (6-0) in just
four short years in what has become the
most important rivalry in the sport. With
both teams seemingly unable to lose on
their home court UConn is riding an
89-game home win streak, and the Card
is on an only slightly less impressive 65-
gamer it was not surprising to see the
Huskies come out on top, 68-58.

The teams, though, were not the fa
miliar pair that has closed out the top
two spots in the rankings for so long.
Both Stanford and Connecticut have
graduated key players in the last two
years, and sophomores and freshmen
now make up the majority of both ros
ters. WNBA guard Maya Moore was still
present, but as a recent graduate could
do nothing more than watch from the
sidelines. However, in her absence,
Huskies fans were not to be disappoint
ed as rising-star freshman forward
Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis grabbed 25
points and eight rebounds to make her
mark and lead her team to victory.
Rallying early in the second half to
retake the lead, Stanford showed
promise of its own but ultimately was
outplayed by UConn. Pressing hard on
defense, the Huskies forced the Card
to commit 16 turnovers, and on of
fense, UConn found enough room to
score from inside and outside and
stretched back into a stable lead by the
end. Foul trouble for Stanford senior
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike limited
her contribution to 23 minutes, and
though she tallied 22 points in that
time, her absence may have made a
crucial difference.
Heading on to Cincinnati, the Cardi
nal was looking to bounce back from
that early-season loss and continue its
unbeaten record against Xavier (1-2).
The Musketeers came in to this contest
on a two-game slide in head coach Amy
Waugh's first season at Xavier, but
though they could stay close throughout
the first period they trailed by just a
single point at the half the Card
stretched ahead in the next 20 minutes
to win comfortably, 80-64.
This time, there was no serious foul
trouble for Nnemkadi Ogwumike, and in
her 30 minutes on the hardwood she
notched her second double-double of the
year, leading the Cardinal with 34 points
and 16 rebounds. Adding to this, two
other Stanford players managed to put
up double-figure points, her sister sopho
more forward Chiney Ogwumike with 18
points and sophomore guard Toni Koke
nis with 14 points. In comparison, the
Musketeers also showed depth with four
of their starting five scoring more than 10

points each, but perhaps the crucial
difference between the two was
turnovers. Not only did the Card
force 20 turnovers to Xavier's 10,
but its ability to make this change in
possession count meant Stanford
scored 23 points from these oppor
tunities and the Musketeers just
five.

Though the Card struggled
from beyond the arc, hitting just
three of 17 shots, it was able to
make up for this on the inside, as
evidenced by the 32 points in the
paint, 26 second-chance points and
the fact that the Ogwumike sisters
accounted for well over half of
Stanford's final score.
Since first meeting Xavier in the
2010 NCAA Sacramento Regional
Final, Stanford now holds a 3-0
record over the Midwestern foe.
That first encounter could not
have been closer, with a layup by

guard Jeanette Pohlen in the dying
seconds winning the game for the
Cardinal, but the other two have
been far more comfortable victo
ries. This one provided a much
needed bounce-back after the loss
to Connecticut.
The Cardinal now returns to the
West Coast to face UC-Davis at
Maples Pavilion on Wednesday
and then travels to Fresno State on
Sunday.

five.

Though the Card struggled
from beyond the arc, hitting just
three of 17 shots, it was able to
make up for this on the inside, as
evidenced by the 32 points in the
paint, 26 second-chance points and
the fact that the Ogwumike sisters
accounted for well over half of
Stanford's final score.
Since first meeting Xavier in the
2010 NCAA Sacramento Regional
Final, Stanford now holds a 3-0
record over the Midwestern foe.
That first encounter could not
have been closer, with a layup by

guard Jeanette Pohlen in the dying
seconds winning the game for the
Cardinal, but the other two have
been far more comfortable victo
ries. This one provided a much
needed bounce-back after the loss
to Connecticut.
The Cardinal now returns to the
West Coast to face UC-Davis at
Maples Pavilion on Wednesday
and then travels to Fresno State on
Sunday.
