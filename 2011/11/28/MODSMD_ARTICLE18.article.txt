# LUCK'S HISTORIC DAY LEADS CARD
## QB SETS RECORDS ON SENIOR DAY 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
In its last regular-season
game, the Stanford football
team scored 21 unanswered
first-half points to put away
Notre Dame 28-14 but Satur
day night was all about redshirt
junior quarterback Andrew
Luck in his final performance
before the Heisman Trophy cer
emony.
Luck etched his name a little
deeper into the Stanford record
books on Saturday, going 20-for
-30 through the air for 233 yards
and four touchdowns, breaking
his own single-season record for

most touchdowns in a year and
breaking John Elway's mark for
most career passing touch
downs.

"There's no other player in
America like Andrew Luck," said
head coach David Shaw after
ward, outwardly stumping for his
quarterback. "It's apples and or
anges in my opinion between him
and everybody else, and I've seen
a lot of the other guys, and there
are a lot of really, really good foot

ball players. There's nobody like
this guy."
And while Luck's final pre-
Heisman performance might
have somewhat overshadowed
the proceedings, the other seniors
didn't miss a beat either, helping
Luck build a 21-0 lead in the first
half to seal the victory early on.

NOTRE DAME 14
STANFORD 28
11/26, Stanford Stadium


KYLE ANDERSON/The Stanford Daily
Redshirt junior quarterback Andrew Luck stole the show on Saturday, throwing four touchdown passes and
setting two school records in the process as the No. 4 Stanford football team beat Notre Dame, 28-14.
an all-around dominant perform
ance.
Altogether, Shaw summed up
what the class of 2012 meant to the
history of Cardinal football.
"It's got to be the best class in the
history of the school," he said. "You
start from the beginning, where these
guys came in on faith ... We recruit
ed guys that had the vision and that
were going to come here and were
going to do what is unheard of in
today's football, and that is be a top
five education and be a top-five foot
ball team in back-to-back years."
"It put an exclamation point on
the work our team has done over the
years since I've been here," Michael
Thomas said, speaking for a senior
class that has compiled a 23-2 record
over the last two seasons.
Despite Luck's excellent num
bers, the overall quality of the game
could best be characterized as un
even and mistake-prone. However,
Stanford took advantage of Notre
Dame's frequent mistakes, particu
larly in the first half, as well as an in
jury to quarterback Tommy Rees,
who was forced to split time with
backup Andrew Hendrix after a
Chase Thomas sack on the Irish's first
drive.
From there, Luck did what was
needed, tossing his first touchdown of
the night to redshirt freshman tight
end Levine Toilolo to open the scor
ing midway through the first quarter.
After that, both offenses struggled to
find any purchase, trading punts back
and forth until Luck threw an inter
ception in the second quarter that
was returned to the Cardinal's 11-
yard line.
When the Irish offense stalled
then missed a field goal. Luck took
full advantage of the momentum
shift, finding Fleener for his second
touchdown pass of the night. Fleener
dragged an Irish defender 10 yards
before finally finding the end zone
he also dragged Luck's name past
Elway's in the record books.
Fleener said he didn't think too
much about being the recipient of
Luck's record-breaking pass.
"I think it's something I'll be able
to tell my kids and grandkids when
I'm watching Andrew on TV some
day," he quipped.
Late in the second half, after
Gatewood intercepted Rees to atone
for a Stepfan Taylor fumble, Luck ex
pertly piloted the Cardinal offense to

a touchdown with 1:38 left on the
clock, finding freshman Ty Mong
tomery in the final seconds to stretch
the lead to 21-0 at the break.
The Irish did eventually find the
end zone in the second half when
Hendrix threw a touchdown pass to
receiver Michael Floyd in the middle
of the third quarter, but Luck found
Fleener again with a 55-yard strike
for a score to put the game out of
reach with less than six minutes left in
the game.
Stanford now will wait and watch
for a week before it knows its post
season fate, but the win over the No.
22 Irish helped bump the Cardinal up
to fourth in the Bowl Championship
Series, likely assuring the team a trip
to the Fiesta Bowl, its second BCS
bowl in a row.
But after a game where Stanford
punted six times, turned the ball over
twice and was penalized 11 times for
113 yards, Shaw said the Cardinal had
some issues to work on before it
would be ready for whichever bowl it
ends up playing in.
"First and foremost, we've got to
get healthy," he said. "We played with
our three tight ends on the field
today, and two of them were proba
bly about 80 percent. Our backs have
been beaten up and bruised all year,
we gotta get them fresh. We've got to
solve the turnover deal, we can't turn
the ball over this much, we can't
ball security is paramount, and num
ber three is penalties, we've got to
find ways to not get penalized."
But Shaw and the Cardinal play
ers weren't as focused on their bowl
destination, which will be decided
after the conference championship
games next weekend. Instead, the
Cardinal spent the postgame trying
to trumpet Luck's talents before the
Heisman ceremony on Dec. 10.
In typical fashion, Luck himself
wasn't eager to talk about what his
record-setting performance proved
to Heisman voters.
"I don't know," he said. "I don't
worry about what kind of impression
I make on anybody besides the guys
in this locker room.They can get what
they want out of watching this game."
"He'd have my vote," Fleener
said, prompting Chase and Michael
Thomas to both chime in: "Mine
too."
Luck smiled, hung his head and
perhaps betrayed his real thoughts
on the trophy awarded to the na
tion's most outstanding player.
"Too bad you don't have votes,"
he said.
