# LUCK'S HISTORIC DAY LEADS CARD
## QB SETS RECORDS ON SENIOR DAY 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
In its last regular-season
game, the Stanford football
team scored 21 unanswered
first-half points to put away
Notre Dame 28-14 but Satur
day night was all about redshirt
junior quarterback Andrew
Luck in his final performance
before the Heisman Trophy cer
emony.
Luck etched his name a little
deeper into the Stanford record
books on Saturday, going 20-for
-30 through the air for 233 yards
and four touchdowns, breaking
his own single-season record for

most touchdowns in a year and
breaking John Elway's mark for
most career passing touch
downs.

"There's no other player in
America like Andrew Luck," said
head coach David Shaw after
ward, outwardly stumping for his
quarterback. "It's apples and or
anges in my opinion between him
and everybody else, and I've seen
a lot of the other guys, and there
are a lot of really, really good foot

ball players. There's nobody like
this guy."
And while Luck's final pre-
Heisman performance might
have somewhat overshadowed
the proceedings, the other seniors
didn't miss a beat either, helping
Luck build a 21-0 lead in the first
half to seal the victory early on.
Redshirt senior tight end
Coby Fleener had two touch
down catches, senior defensive
backs Michael Thomas and Corey
Gatewood each recorded an in
terception and redshirt junior
linebacker Chase Thomas had
two sacks and forced a fumble in
