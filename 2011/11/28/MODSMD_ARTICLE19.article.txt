# Seniors cap historic year in style
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
It's hard to believe, but
we've reached the end of
another regular season of
Stanford football. Here's
Stat on the Back's take on
the Cardinal's final game of 2011.
Number of the game: 11
What it means: For the second
consecutive year, Stanford won 11
games in the regular season.
Why it matters: The Cardinal's
11-1 record opens up great BCS
possibilities, but we'll get to that
later. In the big picture, this season
(like last season) will go down as
one of the greatest in school histo
ry. From 1892 through 2009, Stan
ford football never won more than
10 games in a season. Now, the
Cardinal has won at least 11
games in back-to-back years.
Some people may point out
that teams play more games now
than they used to. This is true, but
it doesn't make this season any
less historic. Until last year, no
Stanford team had lost fewer than
two games since the 1940 team
went 10-0. (You know, the 1940
season when the AP Poll ranked
exactly 19 teams, including cur
rent powerhouses Santa Clara,
Fordham, Georgetown, Penn,
Cornell, Lafayette and, of course,
Hardin-Simmons. Let's just say
the college football world has
changed a little since then.)
Back-to-back 11-1 regular sea
sons are incredible for any team,
but for Stanford they are down
right unbelievable. Consider that
in the not-so-distant past (as in a
few years ago), the Cardinal went
seven straight years without get
ting even halfway to an 11-win
season. This team has a great deal
of potential, but with the quality
of talent leaving after this season,
who knows when the program will
ever ascend to these heights
again? Alas, that is a question for a
later day.
Other notable numbers:
4: This is the big number as far
as this year's team is concerned. In
this week's BCS standings, the
Cardinal jumped over Virginia
Tech to place in the all-important
No. 4 slot. Per BCS rules, any team
that finishes in the top four of the
final BCS standings is guaranteed
an at-large bid to a BCS bowl.
All indications are that Stan
ford would make a BCS bowl no
matter what, but now it appears a
certainty. The only way the Cardi
nal could be left out now is if a
team passes Stanford next week,
and the Cardinal's lead over Vir
ginia Tech is .0748, which is fairly
large by BCS standards. In other
words, expect to see Stanford
playing in early January, likely
against Oklahoma or Oklahoma
State in the Fiesta Bowl.
But enough of the big picture.
