# Seniors cap historic year in style
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
It's hard to believe, but
we've reached the end of
another regular season of
Stanford football. Here's
Stat on the Back's take on
the Cardinal's final game of 2011.
Number of the game: 11
What it means: For the second
consecutive year, Stanford won 11
games in the regular season.
Why it matters: The Cardinal's
11-1 record opens up great BCS
possibilities, but we'll get to that
later. In the big picture, this season
(like last season) will go down as
one of the greatest in school histo
ry. From 1892 through 2009, Stan
ford football never won more than
10 games in a season. Now, the
Cardinal has won at least 11
games in back-to-back years.
Some people may point out
that teams play more games now
than they used to. This is true, but
it doesn't make this season any
less historic. Until last year, no
Stanford team had lost fewer than
two games since the 1940 team
went 10-0. (You know, the 1940
season when the AP Poll ranked
exactly 19 teams, including cur
rent powerhouses Santa Clara,
Fordham, Georgetown, Penn,
Cornell, Lafayette and, of course,
Hardin-Simmons. Let's just say
the college football world has
changed a little since then.)
Back-to-back 11-1 regular sea
sons are incredible for any team,
but for Stanford they are down
right unbelievable. Consider that
in the not-so-distant past (as in a
few years ago), the Cardinal went
seven straight years without get
ting even halfway to an 11-win
season. This team has a great deal
of potential, but with the quality
of talent leaving after this season,
who knows when the program will
ever ascend to these heights
again? Alas, that is a question for a
later day.
Other notable numbers:
4: This is the big number as far
as this year's team is concerned. In
this week's BCS standings, the
Cardinal jumped over Virginia
Tech to place in the all-important
No. 4 slot. Per BCS rules, any team
that finishes in the top four of the
final BCS standings is guaranteed
an at-large bid to a BCS bowl.
All indications are that Stan
ford would make a BCS bowl no
matter what, but now it appears a
certainty. The only way the Cardi
nal could be left out now is if a
team passes Stanford next week,
and the Cardinal's lead over Vir
ginia Tech is .0748, which is fairly
large by BCS standards. In other
words, expect to see Stanford
playing in early January, likely
against Oklahoma or Oklahoma
State in the Fiesta Bowl.
But enough of the big picture.
Saturday night provided plenty of

numbers of its own as the Cardi
nal beat Notre Dame 28-14.
80: Okay, so this is another
somewhat big-picture number,
but it came to fruition during Sat
urday's game. Andrew Luck, in
what was likely his final collegiate
home game, threw four touch
down passes against the Fighting
Irish. Apart from helping to win
the game, the TD passes allowed
Luck to break two school records.
The fourTDs gave Luck 35 for the
season, breaking his own school
record of 32 from last season.
More significantly, though,
Luck broke John Elway's school
record of 77 career touchdown
passes. In typical Luck fashion, he
shattered the record, tallying his
80th touchdown pass with a 55-
yard bomb to Coby Fleener.
Whereas Elway played all four
years on the Farm, Luck will leave
after three, but he may still go
down as the greatest quarterback
in Stanford history. This says quite

a lot considering the achieve
ments of Elway and Jim Plunkett,
who remains Stanford's only
Heisman winner. It'll be up to vot
ers to decide if that will still be the
case two weeks from now.
10: The aforementioned 80th
touchdown was fitting in another
sense, because it went to a tight
end. Three of the four touch
downs on Saturday went to tight
ends, including a pair to Fleener.
After starting the year as just one
member of the outstanding trio of
tight ends, Fleener has cemented
himself as one of the best in the
nation. Stanford fans got a
glimpse of his talent in the Or
ange Bowl, when he hauled in
three touchdowns, and he's only
grown from there. Fleener's 10
touchdowns this season are the
most for any tight end in the na
tion, and he has assumed the role
of big-play threat in the Stanford
offense.
1.8: The Stanford rush defense
began the year on fire, but the sec
ond half of the year hasn't treated
the Cardinal run D well. On Sat
urday, though, the Fighting Irish
were stymied on the ground, aver
aging just 1.8 yards per carry on 31

carries. The pass rush helped that
number in a big way, as the Cardi
nal sacked Notre Dame's quarter
backs five times.
23: Saturday was all about the
Stanford seniors, and in the end, it
really was all about them. David
Shaw and the coaching staff elect
ed to have all 23 fourth-year and
fifth-year seniors honored during
pre-game, and many of them had
major contributions in the game,
from Luck to Fleener to Chase
Thomas to Michael Thomas to
Matt Masifilo to Corey Gatewood
. . . the list goes on and on. These
seniors helped the Cardinal es
cape the seven-year bowl drought
to become one of the nation's
elite teams, and they have gone
23-2 in their past two years.
Thanks and congratulations to
Stanford's seniors. We'll see you
in January.

Jacob Jaffe is hoping to get an invita
tion to New York as a Heisman fi
nalist after some outstanding play as
a nose tackle and offensive guard in
the Ink Bowl. If you'd like to voice

It's hard to believe, but
we've reached the end of
another regular season of
Stanford football. Here's
Stat on the Back's take on
the Cardinal's final game of 2011.
Number of the game: 11
What it means: For the second
consecutive year, Stanford won 11
games in the regular season.
Why it matters: The Cardinal's
11-1 record opens up great BCS
possibilities, but we'll get to that
later. In the big picture, this season
(like last season) will go down as
one of the greatest in school histo
ry. From 1892 through 2009, Stan
ford football never won more than
10 games in a season. Now, the
Cardinal has won at least 11
games in back-to-back years.
Some people may point out
that teams play more games now
than they used to. This is true, but
it doesn't make this season any
less historic. Until last year, no
Stanford team had lost fewer than
two games since the 1940 team
went 10-0. (You know, the 1940
season when the AP Poll ranked
exactly 19 teams, including cur
rent powerhouses Santa Clara,
Fordham, Georgetown, Penn,
Cornell, Lafayette and, of course,
Hardin-Simmons. Let's just say
the college football world has
changed a little since then.)
Back-to-back 11-1 regular sea
sons are incredible for any team,
but for Stanford they are down
right unbelievable. Consider that
in the not-so-distant past (as in a
few years ago), the Cardinal went
seven straight years without get
ting even halfway to an 11-win
season. This team has a great deal
of potential, but with the quality
of talent leaving after this season,
who knows when the program will
ever ascend to these heights
again? Alas, that is a question for a
later day.
Other notable numbers:
4: This is the big number as far
as this year's team is concerned. In
this week's BCS standings, the
Cardinal jumped over Virginia
Tech to place in the all-important
No. 4 slot. Per BCS rules, any team
that finishes in the top four of the
final BCS standings is guaranteed
an at-large bid to a BCS bowl.
All indications are that Stan
ford would make a BCS bowl no
matter what, but now it appears a
certainty. The only way the Cardi
nal could be left out now is if a
team passes Stanford next week,
and the Cardinal's lead over Vir
ginia Tech is .0748, which is fairly
large by BCS standards. In other
words, expect to see Stanford
playing in early January, likely
against Oklahoma or Oklahoma
State in the Fiesta Bowl.
But enough of the big picture.
Saturday night provided plenty of

numbers of its own as the Cardi
nal beat Notre Dame 28-14.
80: Okay, so this is another
somewhat big-picture number,
but it came to fruition during Sat
urday's game. Andrew Luck, in
what was likely his final collegiate
home game, threw four touch
down passes against the Fighting
Irish. Apart from helping to win
the game, the TD passes allowed
Luck to break two school records.
The fourTDs gave Luck 35 for the
season, breaking his own school
record of 32 from last season.
More significantly, though,
Luck broke John Elway's school
record of 77 career touchdown
passes. In typical Luck fashion, he
shattered the record, tallying his
80th touchdown pass with a 55-
yard bomb to Coby Fleener.
Whereas Elway played all four
years on the Farm, Luck will leave
after three, but he may still go
down as the greatest quarterback
in Stanford history. This says quite

a lot considering the achieve
ments of Elway and Jim Plunkett,
who remains Stanford's only
Heisman winner. It'll be up to vot
ers to decide if that will still be the
case two weeks from now.
10: The aforementioned 80th
touchdown was fitting in another
sense, because it went to a tight
end. Three of the four touch
downs on Saturday went to tight
ends, including a pair to Fleener.
After starting the year as just one
member of the outstanding trio of
tight ends, Fleener has cemented
himself as one of the best in the
nation. Stanford fans got a
glimpse of his talent in the Or
ange Bowl, when he hauled in
three touchdowns, and he's only
grown from there. Fleener's 10
touchdowns this season are the
most for any tight end in the na
tion, and he has assumed the role
of big-play threat in the Stanford
offense.
1.8: The Stanford rush defense
began the year on fire, but the sec
ond half of the year hasn't treated
the Cardinal run D well. On Sat
urday, though, the Fighting Irish
were stymied on the ground, aver
aging just 1.8 yards per carry on 31

carries. The pass rush helped that
number in a big way, as the Cardi
nal sacked Notre Dame's quarter
backs five times.
23: Saturday was all about the
Stanford seniors, and in the end, it
really was all about them. David
Shaw and the coaching staff elect
ed to have all 23 fourth-year and
fifth-year seniors honored during
pre-game, and many of them had
major contributions in the game,
from Luck to Fleener to Chase
Thomas to Michael Thomas to
Matt Masifilo to Corey Gatewood
. . . the list goes on and on. These
seniors helped the Cardinal es
cape the seven-year bowl drought
to become one of the nation's
elite teams, and they have gone
23-2 in their past two years.
Thanks and congratulations to
Stanford's seniors. We'll see you
in January.
