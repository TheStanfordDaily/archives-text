## CS remains atop Honor Code breaches Department tracking system catches violations 
### MARY HARRISON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Computer Science (CS) continues to
contribute the largest percentage of
Honor Code violations among all Uni
versity departments, although the pro
portion of plagiarism cases coming from
CS is declining.
From 1991 to 2001, the CS Depart
ment accounted for, on average, 37 per
cent of plagiarism cases. Between 2006
and 2009, that proportion dropped to 25
percent. However, the real average in
creased from 14 to 27 cases per year,
which coincided with a spike in CS en
rollment.
"The fraction of [plagiarism] cases
that have come from CS has gone down
from those years [the 19905] when in
some years, we were well above 50 per
cent of total incidents," said Eric Roberts,
professor of computer science and a
member of the University's Internal Re
view Panel, which will be submitting new
recommendations about academic in
tegrity at Stanford early winter quarter.
In 2002, Roberts published a paper
about plagiarism in the Stanford CS De
partment, which asserted that between 3
and 5 percent of CS assignments were
plagiarized at the time it was written.
"It doesn't feel nearly as out of control
as it did when I was writing that paper,"
he said.
There are several theories as to why
CS accounts for such a large proportion
of honor code violations, among them
real-world incentives and more rigorous
regulation.
"I think a good piece of it comes from
the economic incentive," Roberts said.
"People think if they get a CS degree they
could be the next Larry Page or Sergey
Brin. To cheat on a philosophy paper
doesn't have the same economic incen
tive attached to it."
Roberts also named the availability of
copy-able code, the fact that many CS
courses recycle assignments from previ
ous years and the cumulative nature of
CS classes as incentive and opportunity
to cheat.
CS professor Alex Aiken developed
the department's plagiarism detection
system, known as Measure of Software
Similarity (MOSS), which is used at uni
versities around the world. He rejected
the possibility that the higher levels of


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
plagiarism in CS classes come from a
heavier workload.
"It is fairly well known that CS
classes are difficult and involve a fair
ly heavy workload, but I don't think
it's that significantly different from,
say, a humanities course where you
have to write big papers," he said.
Judicial Affairs, however, has evi
dence showing that workload is a
major contributor to plagiarism.
"Most often students reported
running out of time, a heavy work
load or concerns about their final
grade as reasons for attempting to
take a shortcut," wrote Judicial Af
fairs Officer Jamie Pontius-Hogan in
an email to The Daily.
CS is one of the few departments
that uses a plagiarism detection system
on a regular basis. Aiken said that
when schools adopt the MOSS system,
"they find a whole bunch of cases right
at the start, word gets out and then it
drops to a low level quite quickly."
He also clarified that MOSS
"doesn't find plagiarism, that's a fair
ly common misconception it finds

similarity."
"Plagiarism has an intent," he
said. "Similarity is a more technical
notion. When we find things that look
the same, we don't know necessarily
why they look the same. Humans still
have to look at it."
Many departments choose not to
check for plagiarism because of Stan
ford's Honor Code, which leaves the
responsibility for honesty in the
hands of students.
"Faculty [in other departments]
often catch plagiarism because the
text does not read like the students'
previous work or appears to be writ
ten at a different level," Pontius-
Hogan said.
Parna Sengupta, associate direc
tor of the Introduction to the Hu
manities (IHUM) Program, which
averaged seven instances of plagia
rism per year between 2006 and 2009,
said that most faculty rarely check for
plagiarism.
"In general, we expect students to
uphold the Honor Code," she said.
The CS professors who spoke to
The Daily, however, are split on how
much influence the Honor Code ac
tually has on behavior.
"Data show that schools that have
an honor code have less incidents of
cheating than those without honor

codes," Roberts said.
Aiken, on the other hand, is not
sure if this data is genuine.
"The thing I've noticed about
honor-code schools is because the
penalty is so high, typically expulsion,
there is a reluctance on the part of
faculty to prosecute plagiarism be
cause they sometimes think punish
ment is not proportional to crime," he
said.
He did add that he thought it was
getting easier for professors to report
instances of plagiarism to the judicial
committee, because "there are defi
nitely degrees of infraction [affected
by] intent and the degree to which
things were copied."
Roberts agreed, saying that intent
is what defines plagiarism.
"What happens if someone is try
ing to cite something on an assign
ment and does it wrong?" he asked.
"In my mind, that is not an Honor
Code violation."
"What I think is most important is
that the student recognize that the
Honor Code is theirs," Roberts con
tinued. "Student lobbied for it... to
make sure they could be in charge of
administering academic integrity."

The Daily, however, are split on how
much influence the Honor Code ac
tually has on behavior.
"Data show that schools that have
an honor code have less incidents of
cheating than those without honor

codes," Roberts said.
Aiken, on the other hand, is not
sure if this data is genuine.
"The thing I've noticed about
honor-code schools is because the
penalty is so high, typically expulsion,
there is a reluctance on the part of
faculty to prosecute plagiarism be

ment is not proportional to crime," he
said.
He did add that he thought it was
getting easier for professors to report
instances of plagiarism to the judicial
committee, because "there are defi
nitely degrees of infraction [affected
by] intent and the degree to which
things were copied."
Roberts agreed, saying that intent
is what defines plagiarism.
"What happens if someone is try
ing to cite something on an assign
ment and does it wrong?" he asked.
"In my mind, that is not an Honor
Code violation."
"What I think is most important is
that the student recognize that the
Honor Code is theirs," Roberts con
tinued. "Student lobbied for it... to
make sure they could be in charge of
administering academic integrity."

Computer Science (CS) continues to
contribute the largest percentage of
Honor Code violations among all Uni
versity departments, although the pro
portion of plagiarism cases coming from
CS is declining.
From 1991 to 2001, the CS Depart
ment accounted for, on average, 37 per
cent of plagiarism cases. Between 2006
and 2009, that proportion dropped to 25
percent. However, the real average in
creased from 14 to 27 cases per year,
which coincided with a spike in CS en
rollment.
"The fraction of [plagiarism] cases
that have come from CS has gone down
from those years [the 19905] when in
some years, we were well above 50 per
cent of total incidents," said Eric Roberts,
professor of computer science and a
member of the University's Internal Re
view Panel, which will be submitting new
recommendations about academic in
tegrity at Stanford early winter quarter.
In 2002, Roberts published a paper
about plagiarism in the Stanford CS De
partment, which asserted that between 3
and 5 percent of CS assignments were
plagiarized at the time it was written.
"It doesn't feel nearly as out of control
as it did when I was writing that paper,"
he said.
There are several theories as to why
CS accounts for such a large proportion
of honor code violations, among them
real-world incentives and more rigorous
regulation.
"I think a good piece of it comes from
the economic incentive," Roberts said.
"People think if they get a CS degree they
could be the next Larry Page or Sergey
Brin. To cheat on a philosophy paper
doesn't have the same economic incen
tive attached to it."
Roberts also named the availability of
copy-able code, the fact that many CS
courses recycle assignments from previ
ous years and the cumulative nature of
CS classes as incentive and opportunity
to cheat.
CS professor Alex Aiken developed
the department's plagiarism detection
system, known as Measure of Software
Similarity (MOSS), which is used at uni
versities around the world. He rejected
the possibility that the higher levels of


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
plagiarism in CS classes come from a
heavier workload.
"It is fairly well known that CS
classes are difficult and involve a fair
ly heavy workload, but I don't think
it's that significantly different from,
say, a humanities course where you
have to write big papers," he said.
Judicial Affairs, however, has evi
dence showing that workload is a
major contributor to plagiarism.
"Most often students reported
running out of time, a heavy work
load or concerns about their final
grade as reasons for attempting to
take a shortcut," wrote Judicial Af
fairs Officer Jamie Pontius-Hogan in
an email to The Daily.
CS is one of the few departments
that uses a plagiarism detection system
on a regular basis. Aiken said that
when schools adopt the MOSS system,
"they find a whole bunch of cases right
at the start, word gets out and then it
drops to a low level quite quickly."
He also clarified that MOSS
"doesn't find plagiarism, that's a fair
ly common misconception it finds

similarity."
"Plagiarism has an intent," he
said. "Similarity is a more technical
notion. When we find things that look
the same, we don't know necessarily
why they look the same. Humans still
have to look at it."
Many departments choose not to
check for plagiarism because of Stan
ford's Honor Code, which leaves the
responsibility for honesty in the
hands of students.
"Faculty [in other departments]
often catch plagiarism because the
text does not read like the students'
previous work or appears to be writ
ten at a different level," Pontius-
Hogan said.
Parna Sengupta, associate direc
tor of the Introduction to the Hu
manities (IHUM) Program, which
averaged seven instances of plagia
rism per year between 2006 and 2009,
said that most faculty rarely check for
plagiarism.
"In general, we expect students to
uphold the Honor Code," she said.
