## CS remains atop Honor Code breaches Department tracking system catches violations 
### MARY HARRISON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Computer Science (CS) continues to
contribute the largest percentage of
Honor Code violations among all Uni
versity departments, although the pro
portion of plagiarism cases coming from
CS is declining.
From 1991 to 2001, the CS Depart
ment accounted for, on average, 37 per
cent of plagiarism cases. Between 2006
and 2009, that proportion dropped to 25
percent. However, the real average in
creased from 14 to 27 cases per year,
which coincided with a spike in CS en
rollment.
"The fraction of [plagiarism] cases
that have come from CS has gone down
from those years [the 19905] when in
some years, we were well above 50 per
cent of total incidents," said Eric Roberts,
professor of computer science and a
member of the University's Internal Re
view Panel, which will be submitting new
recommendations about academic in
tegrity at Stanford early winter quarter.
In 2002, Roberts published a paper
about plagiarism in the Stanford CS De
partment, which asserted that between 3
and 5 percent of CS assignments were
plagiarized at the time it was written.
"It doesn't feel nearly as out of control
as it did when I was writing that paper,"
he said.
There are several theories as to why
CS accounts for such a large proportion
of honor code violations, among them
real-world incentives and more rigorous
regulation.
"I think a good piece of it comes from
the economic incentive," Roberts said.
"People think if they get a CS degree they
could be the next Larry Page or Sergey
Brin. To cheat on a philosophy paper
doesn't have the same economic incen
tive attached to it."
Roberts also named the availability of
copy-able code, the fact that many CS
courses recycle assignments from previ
ous years and the cumulative nature of
CS classes as incentive and opportunity
to cheat.
CS professor Alex Aiken developed
the department's plagiarism detection
system, known as Measure of Software
Similarity (MOSS), which is used at uni
versities around the world. He rejected
the possibility that the higher levels of
