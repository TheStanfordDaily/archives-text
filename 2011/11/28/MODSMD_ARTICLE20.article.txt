# CARD FALLS JUST SHORT
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
For 36 minutes, it was No. 5
Syracuse that looked like the up
start trying to hang with the Stan
ford men's basketball team in the
championship game of the NIT
Season Tip-Off on Friday. The Car
dinal struggled to score but was
doing just enough on the offensive
end while holding the Orange
down on defense.

In a back-and-forth game where
either team's largest lead was eight
points, Stanford (5-1) led 60-54
with 4:27 remaining. But that's
when the Card began to crumble,
wilting under a full-court press as
Syracuse's experience finally
showed up in crunch time, leading
to a 69-63 Orange win.
After the Cardinal took the six
point lead, Brandon Triche scored
a driving layup, C.J. Fair followed
with a three-point play after a

turnover and preseason All-Amer
ican Kris Joseph gave Syracuse the
lead for good, 61-60, on a banked
jumper with 2:54 to play that
brought the crowd of over 8,000 at
Madison Square Garden to its feet.
The Orange (6-0) closed the
game on a 15-3 run, and Stanford
turned the ball over three times in
the final minutes to seal the deal.
But there were plenty of bright
spots despite the disappointing
loss. The Cardinal was picked by
the media to finish sixth in the Pac
-12 this season, but early results
from around the conference com
bined with Stanford's strong show
ing thus far have thrown the pre
season rankings out the window.
After losing last year's top scor
er Jeremy Green to the pro ranks,
sophomore guard Aaron Bright
has stepped up in a big way, reach
ing double digits in points in every
game this season. Bright was
named to the Tip-Off All-Tourna
ment team. Freshman Chasson
Randle has thus far lived up to the
hype, averaging 10.7 points and 3.5
rebounds per game.
In general, the sophomore class
has looked very solid, with several

players showing signs of improve
ment from last year. Forward John
Gage came off the bench against
Syracuse to score 10 points, includ
ing two huge three-point shots in
just 12 minutes.
And while forwards Josh
Huestis, Anthony Brown and
Dwight Powell didn't have re
markable performances in the
championship game Huestis
scored eight points to go along
with five rebounds but missed all
four of his free throws, and Powell
and Brown were held to just 10
points combined they have
been extremely active on defense
and have all crashed the glass ex
tremely well.
Throw in forward Josh Owens'
consistency the redshirt senior
is again averaging over 12 points
per game and is second on the
team in rebounding and Stan
ford appears to have the tools to
make a move toward playing
meaningful games in March for the
first time since 2008's Sweet 16 ap
pearance.
