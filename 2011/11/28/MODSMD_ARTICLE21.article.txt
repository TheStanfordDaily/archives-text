# POLO FALLS IN SEMIS
## 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The MPSF Tournament final
and a chance at a berth in the
NCAA Championship were in
plain sight for the No. 4 Stanford
men's water polo team after three
quarters of play against USC on
Saturday. Then it all faded away in
the course of a devastating 0-4
fourth quarter that turned a season
defining upset into a season-ending
defeat.

Stanford started off the MPSF
Tournament on Friday with a
thrilling 11-10 victory over fifth
seeded UC-Santa Barbara. It then
lost to the Trojans 8-6 in the semifi
nal and followed that up by losing
to California 8-7 in the third-place
game.
Tire fourth-seeded Cardinal en
tered Saturday's MPSF Tourna
ment semifinal knowing it needed
to knock off top-ranked USC to
have any chance at extending its
season.
But after its last meeting with
SC,in which the Trojans broke open
an early 6-1 lead and coasted to a 8-
4 victory, there was some doubt sur
rounding the likelihood of Stanford
pulling off the upset. USC is also on
a 13-game winning streak that ex
tends back to Oct. 2. To top it all off,
the Cardinal's leading scorer, fresh
man utility Alex B owen, was unable
to play because of a case of mono.
This game was anything but one
sided, though. Both teams came out
on fire from the start, with USC tak
ing the early 3-2 first-quarter ad
vantage. Junior 2-meter Forrest
Watkins seemed determined to sin
gle-handedly carry the Stanford
team, as he scored both first-quar
ter goals. Watkins scored another
two goals in the second quarter as
he continued to put the team on his
back. Goals from junior driver Paul
Rudolph and senior driver Travis
Noll completed a four-goal second
quarter that had the Cardinal up 6-

4 at halftime.
The unexpectedly high-scoring
first half would not last, though, as
USC's top-ranked and Stanford's
second-ranked defenses dominated
a scoreless third period. Senior
goalie Brian Pingree, who was hav
ing one of his best games of the sea
son, played a huge part for Stan
ford.
With a 6-4 lead going into the
fourth quarter, the Cardinal's entire
season was in the balance. A win
would give the team a chance to
take home the MPSF trophy and
the automatic NCAA bid that
comes with it. With a history of win
ning close games all season, a strong
fourth quarter was almost expect
ed.
But just 20 seconds into the
frame, USC's Nikola Vavic notched
the first goal of the half. Minutes
later the score was tied, and by the
end of the quarter, Stanford was
headed to the consolation bracket.
Friday's 11-10 win over UC-
Santa Barbara ensured that Stan
ford would not lose to any team
outside the top four nationally this
season. The close game was expect
ed, though, as Stanford had to come
from behind to beat the Gauchos 6-
5 earlier in the season.
Noll paced the team with three
goals, Rudolph continued a strong
end to his season with another two
goals and Watkins added another
two. Redshirt junior 2-meter An
drew LaForge added a goal, as did

senior drivers Jacob Smith and
Ryan Kent. Senior utility Peter
Sefton had the eventual game-win
ner, which was his only goal of the
game. Pingree ended the game with
10 saves.
The third-place game against
Cal was another rematch of a recent
blowout. The Golden Bears humili
ated host Stanford 11-4 in both
teams' season finale just a week
ago. Sunday's 8-7 loss was much
closer but no easier to stomach.
Rudolph continued his recent
goal-scoring trend, netting a hat
trick that came on the back of mul
tiple two-goal games. His goal and
another by Watkins gave Stanford
an early two-goal cushion. Yet for a
second-straight game, a second-half
letdown put the Cardinal on the
wrong side of the score sheet. A 4-2
Cal third quarter gave the Golden
Bears the second-half lead, which
they never relinquished.
Pingree made seven saves in the
game, and Noll, Smith and redshirt
junior 2-meter Ryan Brown added
one goal apiece.
Stanford finished the season at
19-7 and will likely end the year
ranked fourth. The Cardinal also
finished with a 5-3 regular-season
MPSF record, which was good
enough for fourth place, the same
place the team finished in the tour
nament.

Saturday. Then it all faded away in
the course of a devastating 0-4
fourth quarter that turned a season
defining upset into a season-ending
defeat.

Stanford started off the MPSF
Tournament on Friday with a
thrilling 11-10 victory over fifth
seeded UC-Santa Barbara. It then
lost to the Trojans 8-6 in the semifi
nal and followed that up by losing
to California 8-7 in the third-place
game.
Tire fourth-seeded Cardinal en
tered Saturday's MPSF Tourna
ment semifinal knowing it needed
to knock off top-ranked USC to
have any chance at extending its
season.
But after its last meeting with
SC,in which the Trojans broke open
an early 6-1 lead and coasted to a 8-
4 victory, there was some doubt sur
rounding the likelihood of Stanford
pulling off the upset. USC is also on
a 13-game winning streak that ex
tends back to Oct. 2. To top it all off,
the Cardinal's leading scorer, fresh
man utility Alex B owen, was unable
to play because of a case of mono.
This game was anything but one
sided, though. Both teams came out
on fire from the start, with USC tak
ing the early 3-2 first-quarter ad
vantage. Junior 2-meter Forrest
Watkins seemed determined to sin
gle-handedly carry the Stanford
team, as he scored both first-quar
ter goals. Watkins scored another
two goals in the second quarter as
he continued to put the team on his
back. Goals from junior driver Paul
Rudolph and senior driver Travis
Noll completed a four-goal second
quarter that had the Cardinal up 6-

4 at halftime.
The unexpectedly high-scoring
first half would not last, though, as
USC's top-ranked and Stanford's
second-ranked defenses dominated
a scoreless third period. Senior
goalie Brian Pingree, who was hav
ing one of his best games of the sea
son, played a huge part for Stan
ford.
With a 6-4 lead going into the
fourth quarter, the Cardinal's entire
season was in the balance. A win
would give the team a chance to
take home the MPSF trophy and
the automatic NCAA bid that
comes with it. With a history of win
ning close games all season, a strong
fourth quarter was almost expect
ed.
But just 20 seconds into the
frame, USC's Nikola Vavic notched
the first goal of the half. Minutes
later the score was tied, and by the
end of the quarter, Stanford was
headed to the consolation bracket.
Friday's 11-10 win over UC-
Santa Barbara ensured that Stan
ford would not lose to any team
outside the top four nationally this
season. The close game was expect
ed, though, as Stanford had to come
from behind to beat the Gauchos 6-
5 earlier in the season.
Noll paced the team with three
goals, Rudolph continued a strong
end to his season with another two
goals and Watkins added another
two. Redshirt junior 2-meter An
drew LaForge added a goal, as did

senior drivers Jacob Smith and
Ryan Kent. Senior utility Peter
Sefton had the eventual game-win
ner, which was his only goal of the
game. Pingree ended the game with
10 saves.
The third-place game against
Cal was another rematch of a recent
blowout. The Golden Bears humili
ated host Stanford 11-4 in both
teams' season finale just a week
ago. Sunday's 8-7 loss was much
closer but no easier to stomach.
Rudolph continued his recent
goal-scoring trend, netting a hat
trick that came on the back of mul
tiple two-goal games. His goal and
another by Watkins gave Stanford
an early two-goal cushion. Yet for a
second-straight game, a second-half
letdown put the Cardinal on the
wrong side of the score sheet. A 4-2
Cal third quarter gave the Golden
Bears the second-half lead, which
they never relinquished.
Pingree made seven saves in the
game, and Noll, Smith and redshirt
junior 2-meter Ryan Brown added
one goal apiece.
Stanford finished the season at
19-7 and will likely end the year
ranked fourth. The Cardinal also
finished with a 5-3 regular-season
MPSF record, which was good
enough for fourth place, the same
place the team finished in the tour
nament.
