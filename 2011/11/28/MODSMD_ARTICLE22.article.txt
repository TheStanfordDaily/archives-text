## Overtime goal spurs Stanford to College Cup 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford women's soc
cer team's senior class may have
helped the squad outscore its oppo
nents 174-17 at Laird Q. Cagan Stadi
um over the past four years, but the
final home game for the four outgo
ing Stanford players was anything but
a breeze.

It took the Cardinal (23-0-1) 93
minutes to overcome a determined
Oklahoma State (22-2-2) squad in the
quarterfinals of the NCAA Tourna
ment, ending with a sudden-death
tap-in from senior forward Lindsay
Taylor to propel Stanford to a fourth
straight College Cup appearance
with a 2-1 victory.
An inspired albeit brief
Cardinal effort in overtime came on
the heels of an overwhelming late
game push by the No. 2-seed Cow
girls, who knotted the match up in the
69th minute after showing little life
early in the match. Surviving five sec
ond-half corners by Oklahoma State,
Stanford controlled the extra session
and ended the game in a hurry.
"I think there was just a lot of con
fidence in our team and in our team
mates, and we really just wanted to
play for each other," Taylor said. "We
had a lot of confidence going into the
overtime, and we just wanted to take
it to them for the whole thing."
The powerful Cardinal attack
looked to have its toughest test of the
season against the nation-leading
Cowgirl defense, whose .272 goals
against average was the only such
mark in the country better than Stan
ford's (.344). Regardless, the Cardinal
outshot Oklahoma State 14-1 in the
first half forcing four saves from goal
keeper Adrianna French, who also
had several leaping efforts to swallow
up dangerous crosses in the box.
The floodgates seemed poised to
open for Stanford in the 52nd minute
when senior midfielder Kristy Zur
muhlen sent a hard strike through a
defender's legs and found the back of
the net for her fifth tally of the season.
Still battling a right-leg injury she in
curred in a second-round win over
South Carolina, Zurmuhlen was
forced to leave the game for the sec
ond time just seven minutes later,
hobbling off the field.
"She has great character, and I
think it's fitting that she scores that
goal as a senior, because she's worked
so hard throughout her career," said
head coach Paul Ratcliffe. "It was re
ally fitting to see her get it, and it was
a fantastic goal for us."

Having allowed only two shots by
the 60th minute, it looked as if the
midfielder's goal would be enough to
send Stanford to Kennesaw, Ga., for
the Final Four. But the Cardinal
struggled without Zurmuhlen, and
senior midfielder Sarah Brown got
the Cowgirls on the board with a late
strike when a Stanford defender
slipped near midfield.
Oklahoma State continued to
press, and had it not been for several
near misses not to mention a series
of foul and offside calls that infuriat
ed the Cowgirls coaching staff and
eventually led to a yellow card on the
Oklahoma State bench the Cardi
nal likely wouldn't have gotten out of
regulation with a tie.
"I don't know what happened...
after we scored, there was a letup,"
Ratcliffe said. "I've never seen that
before. That was the first time. Usual
ly, we get even stronger after we score
a goal, so it was a real surprise for me
to see that."
"But I thought at the end they
showed tremendous character to be
tied and then to come back in the
overtime. You saw how fiercely com
petitive this team is; we went after
them."
Stanford took back the driver's
seat almost instantly in the extra ses
sion, perhaps reenergized by the
short break after regulation. Junior
forward Marjani Hing-Glover sent a
rebound soaring just high with the
goalie down in the second minute of
overtime, and when the Cardinal re
gained control after the ensuing goal
kick, it wasn't going to miss again.
The sequence began when senior
midfielder Teresa Noyola corralled a
loose ball near the top of the box and
sent it to junior defender Rachel
Quon at the right side of the box.
Quon then found Taylor swooping in
from the left to bury the point-blank
opportunity at the 2:40 mark of over
time.
"It was a great buildup play, all I
did was tap it in," Taylor said of her
conference-leading 20th goal of the
season. "This team has a lot of charac
ter. We've been down in games, we've
been tied in games, and I think that
we just showed our character tonight
in being able to come back and pull
out this game in overtime, always hav
ing that belief that we can come back
and win no matter what the circum
stances are. We believe in each other."
That belief will need to get even
stronger this week, with Stanford
kicking off College Cup play on Fri
day against Florida State (18-6-1). All
four No. 1 seeds Duke, Wake For
est, the Cardinal and the Seminoles
still remain in the tournament, and
Stanford is the only squad to come
