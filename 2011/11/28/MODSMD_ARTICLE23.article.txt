## Golden Bears come back to beat Cardinal 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford women's vol
leyball team went into its game
against No. 10 California looking to
avenge an early-season loss. Locked
in a tie for fourth in conference play,
a win here would have propelled
Stanford above Cal in the Pac-12
standings and into the NCAA Tour
nament with momentum.
However, the Golden Bears (26-
6,16-6 Pac-12) had different plans, as
they beat Stanford (23-7, 15-7) in
four sets at Maples Pavilion. With
the win, Cal moved into third place
in the Pac-12 while Stanford slid
down to fifth.

The first set would define the tempo
of the entire match, one that would be
a hard-fought struggle between two of
the best teams in the nation. This set
featured 11 ties and seven lead
changes, as neither team could pull
away. After an attacking error gave Cal
a late 24-22 lead, the Card rallied from
set point, winning three straight points
to take a 25-24 lead. Sophomore out
side hitter Rachel Williams' kill gave
Stanford the first set.
The Golden Bears bounced back
in the second set, jumping out to an
early 4-0 lead. Stanford would quick
ly fight back, tying the set at 6-6. Sim
ilar to the first set, there were 15 ties
in the second. Down 24-23, a pair of
kills by junior setter Karissa Cook
and Williams gave Stanford a 25-24
lead and the chance to take a com
manding 2-0 lead. However, Cal
showed its resiliency, tying the match
on a Shannon Hawari kill. The Gold
en Bears would go on to win the set
29-27, squaring the match at one set
apiece. This would prove to be the
turning point in the match.

The trend continued into a third
set that saw six more lead changes.
The biggest lead in the set for either
team was three points, as neither
Stanford nor Cal could break away.
After Cal snapped a 22-22 tie with
two straight points, Stanford head
coach John Dunning was forced to
call a timeout. Stanford saved the
first set point with a kill by sopho
more middle blocker Carly Wopat,
but couldn't save the second, as a kill
by Cal's Correy Johnson gave the
Bears the 25-23 win.
Now down two sets to one, Stan
ford looked almost helpless in the
fourth set. After losing the first three
points, the Card called its first time
out. However, things did not change,
as the team dropped four of the next
five points to go down 7-1. Another
timeout would not be the answer for
the Cardinal, as it went on to lose the
set 25-14 in convincing fashion.
Despite the loss, many Stanford
players had good matches against a
very competitive Cal team. Both
Wopat and Cook had personal
record-setting performances. Cook
tallied her 18th straight double-dou
ble, racking up a career-high 21 digs
and 50 assists. Wopat was a force up
front, recording her first 20-plus kill
performance. She ended the game
with a team-high 22 kills on a .553 hit
ting percentage. Williams pitched in
with 19 kills of her own. Still, it wasn't
enough for the Cardinal.
While the loss was surely a disap
pointment for Stanford, it makes lit
tle difference in hindsight. The Card
advanced to its 31st consecutive
NCAA Tournament, joining Penn
State as one of the only two teams to
make the tournament in every year
of its existence.
Stanford has the No. 11 overall
seed and will take on Sacred Heart in
the first round on Friday at Maples
Pavilion.
