# Stanford, Cal students march
## Students protest police brutality, stating 'civil liberties have no rivalries' 
### MARGARET RAWSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Approximately 200 Stanford
and University of California-Berke
ley students gathered on Sat., Nov.
19 at the Arrillaga Alumni Center to
march in opposition to police action
against Occupy Cal student protest
ers.
Occupy Cal students protesting
in support of the national Occupy
Wall Street movement and against
tuition hikes clashed with Berkeley
o campus police on Nov. 9 when
they refused to remove their en
campment in Berkeley's Sproul
Plaza.
Police used batons against pro
testers, who linked arms and formed
a wall around the tents. The day's
events resulted in 39 arrests, with an
additional arrest the next morning,
and injuries to protesters' arms,
heads and stomachs.
Stanford organizers publicized
Saturday's march, which took place
a few hours before this year's Big
Game, with the message "civil liber
ties have no rivalries."
"This is a rally that will speak to
the character of students at both
schools," read a publicity email cir
culated by Stanford students before
the march. "It will send a message
that even the strongest rivals have
the capacity to come together."
Protesters marched the streets
surrounding the alumni center with
signs, including one that read, "In

justice anywhere is a threat to jus
tice everywhere," referencing Mar
tin Luther King, Jr.'s letter from
Birmingham Jail. Group chants in
cluded, "It's our reality. Stop police
brutality!"
The march ended at Cobb Track
and Angell Field, where the crowd
heard a few prepared speeches be
fore an open-mic session.
"I see a bunch of smart, young
people who want to fight for a bet

ter world," said Zachary Aslanian-
Williams, a Berkeley transfer stu
dent, in his speech.
Robert Slaughter, a senior at St.
Mary's College, described the
events of the Nov. 9 protest. He re
called witnessing police using a
baton against a woman to "stab her
in the stomach five, six times."
"The police department is doing
this to defenseless young people
who are the future," Slaughter said.

"At this I'm wondering, what the
hell is going to happen to me?" he
said. Slaughter was arrested
Nov. 9 and has been charged with
three misdemeanors. He said he was
held the longest of those who were
arrested and described the nights he
spent in the Oakland County Jail
and Santa Rita Jail, where he was
subjected to a strip search. He is

Stanford and UC-Berkeley students marched on Sat., Nov. 19 on Stanford's campus prior to Big Game 2011
to protest police brutality in response to Occupy Cal protesters' refusals to comply with police on Nov. 9.
awaiting a Dec. 12 arraignment.
Shawn Dye 'l4, ASSU senator
and political action co-chair of the
Stanford NAACP, said in an inter
view with The Daily that he, "was
wondering if people would attack me
like that."
This, along with a personal inter
est in the Occupy movement,
prompted him to take a lead role in
organizing Saturday's march.
"The police brutality I felt was un
called for," Dye said. "Looking at the
video evidence alone, we didn't see
any of the students provoking the po
lice. As students, we have so much
power that police see that as a
threat."
"The goal here is change and
seeking justice," said Milton
Achelpohl 'l3, vice president of the
Stanford NAACP.
The Stanford University Depart
ment of Public Safety (SUDPS) saw
the march as an opportunity for out
reach. SUDPS Chief Laura Wilson
was present and stood on the side, lis
tening to the student speeches.
"I appreciate the way in which all

of the participants have handled
themselves today," Wilson said, call
ing the protest "peaceful and produc
tive."
"Some of the videos I have seen
certainly were disturbing," she said
of the events in Sproul Plaza, though
she added that she was not there in
person.
"It looks like us versus them,"
Wilson said of what she sees as an un
fortunate situation in which people
"feel the police are not part of their
community."
"My message would be that we do
need to come together," she said,
noting opportunities such as police
ride-alongs for Stanford community
members to become more connect
ed to SUDPS.
Associate Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Sally Dickson also com
mented positively on the march,
which she helped students including
Dye organize.
"I'm very proud of our students,"
Dickson said. "What happened at
Cal from what I saw from the videos
was tragic."
Some protesters were clear to
draw a line between the Occupy
movement as a whole and Saturday's
march against police brutality.
"It's not a matter of the Occupy
situation but more about caring

when people get hurt and motivating
Stanford students to stand up for
what is right," said Rafael Vazquez
'l2, chair of the ASSU Senate. "I'm
really happy to see so many people
who do care."
Student groups that helped or
ganize Saturday's march included
the ASSU Executive and ASSU sen
ators, MEChA de Stanford, the Stan
ford Asian American Students Asso
ciation, the Stanford Asian Ameri
can Activism Committee, the Stan
ford Black Student Union, the Stan
ford Muslim Student Awareness
Network, the Stanford National As
sociation for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP), the Stan
ford Pilipino American Students As
sociation, the Stanford Vietnamese
Student Association and the Stan
ford Students of Color Coalition.
Kelsei Wharton 'l2, political ac
tion co-chair of Stanford NAACP
and former ASSU vice president, de
scribed the march as an effort in
"raising our collective conscious
ness."
"When people hear Occupy on
this campus now, they're not feeling
it," he said of Stanford's perception.
He described the issue as one of "try
ing to connect the dots together."
"You have to meet people where
they are and be inclusive," Wharton

said of attracting students with a
wide set of beliefs to the march. "You
can't have Stanford students tuned
out."
"The way in which Occupy Cal
has specific aims adds credence to
the movement," said ASSU Senate
Deputy Chair Dan Ashton 'l4, who
also participated in the protest.
"Hopefully, moving forward, the
conversation at Stanford can be root
ed in actionable change."
Maria Rohani, a senior at Berke
ley, commented on the issue at the
heart of Occupy Cal concern that
tuition may increase up to 81 percent
over the next four years.
"Occupy is about working against
the system that takes advantage of
those under it," Rohani said, who was
present at the Nov. 9 protest. "The
UC system has been taking advan
tage of students for years now."
Rohani compared the concerns
of protesters at Stanford and Berke
ley.
"You cannot have an Occupy
movement at Cal without [tuition in
creases] being a focus," she said.
"When you go somewhere like Stan
ford, it may not be as tangible, but it's
still part of your world."

Stanford and UC-Berkeley students marched on Sat., Nov. 19 on Stanford's campus prior to Big Game 2011
to protest police brutality in response to Occupy Cal protesters' refusals to comply with police on Nov. 9.
awaiting a Dec. 12 arraignment.
Shawn Dye 'l4, ASSU senator
and political action co-chair of the
Stanford NAACP, said in an inter
view with The Daily that he, "was
wondering if people would attack me
like that."
This, along with a personal inter
est in the Occupy movement,
prompted him to take a lead role in
organizing Saturday's march.
"The police brutality I felt was un
called for," Dye said. "Looking at the
video evidence alone, we didn't see
any of the students provoking the po
lice. As students, we have so much
power that police see that as a
threat."
"The goal here is change and
seeking justice," said Milton
Achelpohl 'l3, vice president of the
Stanford NAACP.
The Stanford University Depart
ment of Public Safety (SUDPS) saw
the march as an opportunity for out
reach. SUDPS Chief Laura Wilson
was present and stood on the side, lis
tening to the student speeches.
"I appreciate the way in which all

of the participants have handled
themselves today," Wilson said, call
ing the protest "peaceful and produc
tive."
"Some of the videos I have seen
certainly were disturbing," she said
of the events in Sproul Plaza, though
she added that she was not there in
person.
"It looks like us versus them,"
Wilson said of what she sees as an un
fortunate situation in which people
"feel the police are not part of their
community."
"My message would be that we do
need to come together," she said,
noting opportunities such as police
ride-alongs for Stanford community
members to become more connect
ed to SUDPS.
Associate Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Sally Dickson also com
mented positively on the march,
which she helped students including
Dye organize.
"I'm very proud of our students,"
Dickson said. "What happened at
Cal from what I saw from the videos
was tragic."
Some protesters were clear to
draw a line between the Occupy
movement as a whole and Saturday's
march against police brutality.
"It's not a matter of the Occupy
situation but more about caring

when people get hurt and motivating
Stanford students to stand up for
what is right," said Rafael Vazquez
'l2, chair of the ASSU Senate. "I'm
really happy to see so many people
who do care."
Student groups that helped or
ganize Saturday's march included
the ASSU Executive and ASSU sen
ators, MEChA de Stanford, the Stan
ford Asian American Students Asso
ciation, the Stanford Asian Ameri
can Activism Committee, the Stan
ford Black Student Union, the Stan
ford Muslim Student Awareness
Network, the Stanford National As
sociation for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP), the Stan
ford Pilipino American Students As
sociation, the Stanford Vietnamese
Student Association and the Stan
ford Students of Color Coalition.
Kelsei Wharton 'l2, political ac
tion co-chair of Stanford NAACP
and former ASSU vice president, de
scribed the march as an effort in
"raising our collective conscious
ness."
"When people hear Occupy on
this campus now, they're not feeling
it," he said of Stanford's perception.
He described the issue as one of "try
ing to connect the dots together."
"You have to meet people where
they are and be inclusive," Wharton

said of attracting students with a
wide set of beliefs to the march. "You
can't have Stanford students tuned
out."
"The way in which Occupy Cal
has specific aims adds credence to
the movement," said ASSU Senate
Deputy Chair Dan Ashton 'l4, who
also participated in the protest.
"Hopefully, moving forward, the
conversation at Stanford can be root
ed in actionable change."
Maria Rohani, a senior at Berke
ley, commented on the issue at the
heart of Occupy Cal concern that
tuition may increase up to 81 percent
over the next four years.
"Occupy is about working against
the system that takes advantage of
those under it," Rohani said, who was
present at the Nov. 9 protest. "The
UC system has been taking advan
tage of students for years now."
Rohani compared the concerns
of protesters at Stanford and Berke
ley.
"You cannot have an Occupy
movement at Cal without [tuition in
creases] being a focus," she said.
"When you go somewhere like Stan
ford, it may not be as tangible, but it's
still part of your world."

Approximately 200 Stanford
and University of California-Berke
ley students gathered on Sat., Nov.
19 at the Arrillaga Alumni Center to
march in opposition to police action
against Occupy Cal student protest
ers.
Occupy Cal students protesting
in support of the national Occupy
Wall Street movement and against
tuition hikes clashed with Berkeley
o campus police on Nov. 9 when
they refused to remove their en
campment in Berkeley's Sproul
Plaza.
Police used batons against pro
testers, who linked arms and formed
a wall around the tents. The day's
events resulted in 39 arrests, with an
additional arrest the next morning,
and injuries to protesters' arms,
heads and stomachs.
Stanford organizers publicized
Saturday's march, which took place
a few hours before this year's Big
Game, with the message "civil liber
ties have no rivalries."
"This is a rally that will speak to
the character of students at both
schools," read a publicity email cir
culated by Stanford students before
the march. "It will send a message
that even the strongest rivals have
the capacity to come together."
Protesters marched the streets
surrounding the alumni center with
signs, including one that read, "In

justice anywhere is a threat to jus
tice everywhere," referencing Mar
tin Luther King, Jr.'s letter from
Birmingham Jail. Group chants in
cluded, "It's our reality. Stop police
brutality!"
The march ended at Cobb Track
and Angell Field, where the crowd
heard a few prepared speeches be
fore an open-mic session.
"I see a bunch of smart, young
people who want to fight for a bet

ter world," said Zachary Aslanian-
Williams, a Berkeley transfer stu
dent, in his speech.
Robert Slaughter, a senior at St.
Mary's College, described the
events of the Nov. 9 protest. He re
called witnessing police using a
baton against a woman to "stab her
in the stomach five, six times."
"The police department is doing
this to defenseless young people
who are the future," Slaughter said.

"At this I'm wondering, what the
hell is going to happen to me?" he
said. Slaughter was arrested
Nov. 9 and has been charged with
three misdemeanors. He said he was
held the longest of those who were
arrested and described the nights he
spent in the Oakland County Jail
and Santa Rita Jail, where he was
subjected to a strip search. He is
