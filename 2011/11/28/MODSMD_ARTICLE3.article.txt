### MARGARET RAWSON MANAGING EDITOR 
Approximately 200 Stanford
and University of California-Berke
ley students gathered on Sat., Nov.
19 at the Arrillaga Alumni Center to
march in opposition to police action
against Occupy Cal student protest
ers.
Occupy Cal students protesting
in support of the national Occupy
Wall Street movement and against
tuition hikes clashed with Berkeley
o campus police on Nov. 9 when
they refused to remove their en
campment in Berkeley's Sproul
Plaza.
Police used batons against pro
testers, who linked arms and formed
a wall around the tents. The day's
events resulted in 39 arrests, with an
additional arrest the next morning,
and injuries to protesters' arms,
heads and stomachs.
Stanford organizers publicized
Saturday's march, which took place
a few hours before this year's Big
Game, with the message "civil liber
ties have no rivalries."
"This is a rally that will speak to
the character of students at both
schools," read a publicity email cir
culated by Stanford students before
the march. "It will send a message
that even the strongest rivals have
the capacity to come together."
Protesters marched the streets
surrounding the alumni center with
signs, including one that read, "In

justice anywhere is a threat to jus
tice everywhere," referencing Mar
tin Luther King, Jr.'s letter from
Birmingham Jail. Group chants in
cluded, "It's our reality. Stop police
brutality!"
The march ended at Cobb Track
and Angell Field, where the crowd
heard a few prepared speeches be
fore an open-mic session.
"I see a bunch of smart, young
people who want to fight for a bet

ter world," said Zachary Aslanian-
Williams, a Berkeley transfer stu
dent, in his speech.
Robert Slaughter, a senior at St.
Mary's College, described the
events of the Nov. 9 protest. He re
called witnessing police using a
baton against a woman to "stab her
in the stomach five, six times."
"The police department is doing
this to defenseless young people
who are the future," Slaughter said.

"At this I'm wondering, what the
hell is going to happen to me?" he
said. Slaughter was arrested
Nov. 9 and has been charged with
three misdemeanors. He said he was
held the longest of those who were
arrested and described the nights he
spent in the Oakland County Jail
and Santa Rita Jail, where he was
subjected to a strip search. He is
