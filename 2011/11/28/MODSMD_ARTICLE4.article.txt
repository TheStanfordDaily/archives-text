# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## Speakers Bureau aims to collaborate with other groups 
### AUSTIN BLOCK 
In response to the success of past col
laborations, the Stanford Speakers Bu
reau intends to co-sponsor more speak
ers this year.
The Speakers Bureau received
$175,162 in Joint Special Fees last spring
and has activated an additional $25,300
from its reserves for use this year. Its offi
cial Special Fees application sets aside
$24,000 for co-sponsorships.
About 1,400 individuals attended the
bureau's Nov. 10 co-sponsorship with
Stanford In Government (SIG) and the

Freeman Spogli Institute (FSI) of a talk
by former United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan.
"Past collaborations worked really
well," said Speakers Bureau Co-Director
Rahul Sastry 'l2. "I think collaboration is
a good way to make sure that more voic
es are heard in deciding who comes to
speak here and increasing the number of
people who hear about these events and
are therefore motivated to come out and
watch them."
Sastry also mentioned a lack of aware-

ness about the bureau's ability to
co-sponsor speaking events. While
it usually only allocates a maximum
of $l,OOO dollars per speaker event
and a maximum of $1,500 per year
for a co-sponsorship with a particu
lar campus organization, Sastry
said it sometimes exceeds that limit
to co-sponsor a marquee event such
as the Annan talk.
"Last year, we had a lot more
people applying spring quarter rel
ative to fall and winter. I think that
might [have] to do with the fact the
word didn't get out," he said.
Stanford in Government Chair
Otis Reid 'l2 called the Annan
event a success. He said Annan was
SlG's most important speaker since
Pervez Musharraf spoke at Stan
ford in Jan. 2009 shortly after being
deposed from the presidency in
Pakistan.
Both Reid and Sastry said they
were pleased with the collabora
tion. They are currently planning to
bring Pulitzer Prize-winning New
York Times columnist Nicholas
Kristof to Stanford in January.
Sastry said the Speakers Bu
reau's goal is to hold two to three
major events per quarter. In addi
tion to co-sponsoring Annan's visit
to campus, the bureau also inde
pendently funded documentary
filmmaker Michael Moore's Octo
ber lecture, which attracted about
400 attendees.
The bureau does not fund all
speakers who come to campus. For
example, Stanford Students for
Queer Liberation did not interact
with the Bureau when bringing
speakers to campus for its Intersec
tions Week.
Last year, the bureau collaborat
ed with SIG, Students for a Sustain
able Stanford (SSS) and the Hillel
Foundation for Jewish Campus
Life to bring New York Times
columnist and Middle East expert
Thomas Friedman to campus. It
also co-sponsored the Daniel Pearl
Memorial Lecture, which brought
CNN's Wolf Blitzer and David
Bohrman to campus.
"Members of SIG leadership, in
cluding myself, noted the impor
tance of partnering with an envi

ronmental organization on campus,
since Friedman would be talking
significantly about his vision of a
clean-energy economy," said Sid
dhartha Oza 'll, last year's SSS Co-
President and SIG Vice Chair. "The
partnership between SIG, SSS, Hil
lel and the ASSU Speakers Bureau
was beneficial for all parties and
ran rather smoothly."

Last year's ASSU Elections
Commissioner Stephen Trusheim
'l3 said that because the Bureau is
considered an ASSU "service or
ganization," it has "more regula
tions and restrictions than a normal
student organization."
Article IX, Section 5 of the
ASSU Joint Bylaws details the bu
reau's organizational structure and
spending, fundraising and budget
ing rules. Section 5 also spells out
the organization's charge: "to pro
mote intellectual, political, social
and cultural awareness of differing
viewpoints in the Stanford commu
nity."
"On controversial issues, every
attempt shall be made to provide a
balanced presentation of speakers
to the community, although this
balance need not be present in each
individual event," Section 5 contin
ues. The Bureau is invested with the
"sole authority to invite, on behalf
of the entire Association, individu
als to speak at Stanford."

President and SIG Vice Chair. "The
partnership between SIG, SSS, Hil
lel and the ASSU Speakers Bureau
was beneficial for all parties and
ran rather smoothly."

Last year's ASSU Elections
Commissioner Stephen Trusheim
'l3 said that because the Bureau is
considered an ASSU "service or
ganization," it has "more regula
tions and restrictions than a normal
student organization."
Article IX, Section 5 of the
ASSU Joint Bylaws details the bu
reau's organizational structure and
spending, fundraising and budget
ing rules. Section 5 also spells out
the organization's charge: "to pro
mote intellectual, political, social
and cultural awareness of differing
viewpoints in the Stanford commu
nity."
"On controversial issues, every
attempt shall be made to provide a
balanced presentation of speakers
to the community, although this
balance need not be present in each
individual event," Section 5 contin
ues. The Bureau is invested with the
"sole authority to invite, on behalf
of the entire Association, individu
als to speak at Stanford."
