## University-record five students named Rhodes Scholars 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Kurt Chirbas 
Five Stanford students were named
Rhodes Scholars on Saturday. Two others
were selected as Mitchell Scholars.

Rhodes Scholarship

The Rhodes Scholarship provides win
ners with the funds for up to three years of
study at the University of Oxford in Eng
land. Since being established in 1902
through the will of Cecil Rhodes, a British
mine operator who founded the diamond
company De Beers, the scholarship has be
come "the oldest and best known award for
international study," according to Elliot
Gerson, American secretary of the Rhodes
Trust, in a press release.

The recipients from Stanford include
three graduates and two seniors: Aysha
Bagchi 'll, who majored in philosophy and
history, with honors in Ethics in Society;
Anand Habib 'll, who majored in biology,
with honors in international security stud
ies; Kate Niehaus TO MS 'll, who earned
her bachelor's degree in biomechanical en
gineering and her master's degree in bio
engineering; Ishan Nath 'l2, who is major-
ing in economics and Earth Systems,
with a minor in mathematics; and
Tenzin Seldon 'l2, who is majoring in
comparative studies in race and eth
nicity, with a minor in feminist studies.
They plan to pursue studies as di
verse as philosophy in politics to
medical anthropology to economics
for development while at Oxford.
"For me, the award signifies all of
the hard work, support, love and con
viction of the people who have been
around me and seen my journey," said
Seldon, a member on the Daily Board
of Trustees, to the Stanford Report.
Seldon is the first Tibetan American
to win a Rhodes Scholarship.
"It signifies, not just my success,
but success for refuges all around the
world, especially Tibetan refugees
who are first generation Americans,"
she added.
The Trust selects 32 American stu
dents for the award annually, and
around 80 students in total world
wide. 2,000 students in the U.S. started
the application process this year, ac
cording to the press release, and 830
ended up being endorsed by their uni
versities to advance to the interview
round with their districts' selection
committees.
With five students selected from
Stanford, the University not only
posts a personal record, but also is the
school that claims the highest num
ber of Rhodes Scholars this year.
Harvard, Brown and Princeton fol
lowed closely behind, with four stu
dents being named Rhodes Scholars
from each of these universities.
"It's terrific for those five students,
and Stanford should be appropriate
ly proud," Gerson told the San Jose
Mercury News.

Mitchell Scholarship

The Mitchell Scholarship gives re
cipients the funds for one year of
graduate study at a university in the
Republic of Ireland or Northern Ire
land. 13 students receive the honor
annually, and were selected from a
pool of 300 applicants this year, ac
cording to a press release.
The award which was estab
lished in 2001 and named after for
mer Senator George Mitchell, who
was chairman of Northern Ireland
peace talk has become "recog
nized as a highly competitive scholar
ship, vying with the more established
Rhodes and Marshall Scholarships,"
the press release said.
"The Scholarships that bear Sena
tor Mitchell's name are a wonderful
testament to the contribution the
Senator made to peace in Ireland and
provide an invaluable platform to
connect highly talented young Amer
ican men and women to Ireland
today," Irish Ambassador Michael
Collin told finalists during a recep
tion in Washington, D.C. on Friday.
"The Mitchell scholarships are
important to Ireland and ensure that
Ireland and the United States remain
connected in a very special and
meaningful way," he said.
The recipients from Stanford are
Philippe de Koning 'lO, who majored
in international relations and spent
this past academic year at Hiroshima
University in Japan under a Full
bright Scholarship, and Tommy Tobin
'lO, who double majored in interna
tional relations and history and is cur
rently a law student at Georgetown
University Law Center.
Koning plans on using his scholar
ship to study international security
and conflict resolution at Dublin City
University while Tobin intends on
studying law at University College
Cork.
"Stanford is delighted that two more
of our students will represent the
Mitchell Scholarship in Ireland next
year," said assistant vice provost and di
rector of the Bechtel International Cen
ter John Pearson to the Stanford Report.
