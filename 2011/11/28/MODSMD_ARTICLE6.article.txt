## U.S. Ambassador to Japan visits campus Stanford alum describes American response to 'world's first megadisaster' 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER 
U.S. Ambassador to Japan John Roos '77 J.D. 'BO spoke
Friday afternoon to a near-capacity crowd at Cubberly
Auditorium about his experience coordinating the Amer
ican relief effort to last March's 9.0 earthquake and tsuna
mi, which he called "the world's first megadisaster."
An hour after the earthquake, Roos declared an emer
gency and implemented Operation Tomodachi which
means 'friends' in Japanese one of the largest relief op
erations in international history. Nearly 200 U.S. military
ships and aircraft transported food, clothing and supplies
to those left homeless.
As part of the relief effort, Stanford students sold t
shirts to raise funds for disaster aid. Roos noted how many
people continue to stop him on the streets of Tokyo to
thank him for American assistance.
"What makes a country strong is its people," he said. "It
is the university students at Akita
University and at Stanford, those
who donated their time, money and
expertise for those in need that
comprise the strength of a nation."
He also described the nuclear
crisis that ensued when a 50-foot
wave hit the Fukushima Power
Plant. The disaster was intensified
by the limited information avail
able during its initial hours.
"We were in a situation where
the information was scarce, chaotic
or sensationalized in the media and
where the need to communicate
was crucial," he said.
Roos himself used Twitter to as
sure that the 155,000 Americans liv
ing in Japan received timely infor
mation about the disaster.
Roos stressed the Japanese peo
ples' gratitude for their friendship,
showing a film from the people of
Japan thanking Americans for their
aid. He shared the inscription on his
favorite drawing from a Japanese
child: "Thank you America. Mr.
America, please take care not to
catch a cold."
He also read a letter from an or
phaned high school student whom
he visited.
"On March 11, my life changed
totally," she wrote. "At first 1 didn't

know how to deal with the situa
tion. You kindly invited us to Tokyo
and my life has changed again with
a new meaning. I will learn English
and go to school. Now I have a
dream."
Audience members responded
positively to this mixture of facts
and anecdotes.
"1 thought it was interesting how
Roos brought in personal accounts
to his presentation, creating a pow
erful effect to show what the com
munities are collectively doing to
rebuild, bit by bit," said Vince
Sparacio 'l5.
The talk was organized by
Kappa Sigma and its Community
Service Chair Danny Organ 'l3, in
collaboration with the Stanford
University Nikkei (SUN), Stanford
Asian American Activities Center
(A3C) and Residential Riddell
Funds.
Roos served as an honorary cap
tain alongside John Elway
for Stanford before the Cardinal's
40-12 victory in The Orange Bowl
last January.
Roos also touched on a more
current debate: whether Japan
should focus on innovative re
sources or rebuild as before. He
stated that the next generation has
the responsibility of reconstructing
the country, noting "how great it
would be to have Stanford students
be a part of that effort."
He then commented on the re
cent Trans Pacific Partnership
(TPP) trade agreement, which he
called "game-changing."
Several audience members com
mended Roos's speech.
"ft was inspiring to hear about
the gratitude of the Japanese," said
Jake Klonoski, a law student who
was with the U.S. Pacific Fleet and
helped with disaster recovery. "For
the Navy, oftentimes relationships
between State and Defense De
partment are difficult, but watching
the Ambassador's leadership was
impressive. In person it's easy to see
how he did a good job, because he
transmits the intentions of the
American people."
"As an American who grew up
in Japan, Roos' emphasis on the im
portance of the US-Japan relation
ship really struck a chord with me,"
said Gavin Bird 'l4.
