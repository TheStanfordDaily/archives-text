## Engineering most time-consuming 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent study by the National Survey of Student En
gagement (NSSE) found that, on average, faculty expected
engineering majors to spend the most hours per week on
their schoolwork at 20 hours, followed by social scientists at
18 hours and business and education majors at 15 hours.
The NSSE polled 1,900 faculty members at 48 institutions.
Since its founding in 2000, it has observed a 46 percent insti
tutional response. However, Stanford has not participated in
the sampling.
The study also showed some more specific findings. It as
serts that business majors spend the most time on activities
outside school. Furthermore, architectural engineering stu
dents specifically spend the most time on their coursework,
according to an email from NSSE Di
rector Alexander C. McCormick to
The Daily.
Professors did not wish to com
ment on the study's relevance at Stan
ford.
"It depends entirely on the indi
vidual," wrote Elisabeth Pate-Cor
nell, professor of management sci
ence and engineering, in an email to
The Daily. "I expect excellence, what
ever it takes."
She cited students' study habits
and mastery of the material as factors
that may vaiy the amount of time
spent on coursework.
Ronald Anderson 'l5, who plans
to declare a psychology major, said
that he already finds himself exceed
ing the amount of time completing
what is commonly referred to as Stan
ford's "golden ratio," an unofficial ap
proximation which equates one unit
of a Stanford class to three hours of
work per week.
However, other "fuzzies" have
found that the golden ratio's rele
vance depends on the individuals.
"For fuzzier majors, like history or
English, the amount of time spent on
homework is dependent on one's
ability to develop and express a cohe
sive argument," Gabrielle Gulo 'l2,
an English maj or, wrote in an email to
The Daily.
Meanwhile, the Undergraduate
Engineering Handbook suggests that

engineering students enroll in 14 to 17
units per quarter, which translates
into 42 to 51 hours of work per week,
according to the golden ratio. These
recommendations are far higher than
the NSSE study's numbers.
Emma Pierson 'l3, a physics
maj or, argued that many classes, espe

cially higher-level ones, are not as
signed a fair number of units.
"In techie classes, there's almost
an inverse correlation between how
many units a class is and how much
work it is, because higher level-classes
tend to have fewer units," she wrote in
an email to The Daily. "A three-unit

math class is probably harder than a
five-unit math class ... My graduate
CS course this quarter (229) is about
as much work as the rest of my class
es put together, doubled."
