## PROFILE Tackling the digital world's blurred boundaries 
### SHIRLEY YARIN 
Stanford is a "wired" university, with
Wi-Fi accessible almost anywhere
on campus, computers in the lob
bies of many buildings and smart
phones commonly in students'
pockets. Information related to social net
working and schoolwork alike flows con
stantly back and forth from "the cloud."
Have the lines between real life and virtual
reality blurred?
Matt Ivester MBA 'l2, who at age 23
founded the social network website Juicy-
Campus.com, thinks these two worlds have
become one. With the tag line "Always
Anonymous, Always Juicy," the site he found
ed became so controversial that it was banned
from several college campuses and investigat
ed by two attorneys general. However, its ef
fects show how powerful anonymity on the
Web can be.
"Anonymity has the effect of magnifying
the ego and putting fewer filters on what we
do," said communication professor David
Voelker Ph.D. '94.
In retrospect, Ivester said that the
anonymity Juicy Campus.com offered con
tributed "to both the success and the eventu
al downfall of the company."
Now 28 years old and in his second year at

the Graduate School of Business, Ivester used
his experience with Juicy Campus.com as
background for his book "loL.OMG!" pub
lished Oct. 10, which advises college students
on how to maintain their online reputations.
Ivester suggests in his book that students
should frequently Google search their name,
set their profiles on private and cross-link
positive content so it appears at the top of
search engine results.
In person, Ivester stressed the need to
make a good impression online because, he
said, the Internet is now like a permanent
record. While he agreed that college is a time
to try new things on the road to self-discovery,
in his book he warns students about the ad
verse consequences of publishing these mo
ments online. Because first impressions are
often made online, he said, it is crucial to man
age one's digital reputation.
"People often take the shortcut way of get
ting to know someone by just looking through
the bullet points of their life on Facebook,"
Ivester said.
As a result of the "primacy effect," where
people adhere to their first impressions, a
quick glance at someone's Facebook profile
can have long-lasting consequences. Accord
ing to Ivester, college admissions, tenant se
lection and online dating further intensify the
pressure to maintain a clean online image. Job

applicants, he said, are evaluated online as
well as on paper: career development centers
often analyze potential employees' Internet
activity and notify employers of possible
problems relating to discrimination, violence
or drug abuse.
Despite the lack of online privacy and the
dangers associated with social media, Ivester
emphasized the need to maintain a strong on
line presence, arguing that it provides effi
cient long-distance communication and al
lows users to create their own digital image.
And in any case, some, like Voelker, think
that the nature of privacy itself is changing as
a result of technological transformations.
"Digital citizenship," or the concept of par
ticipating in societal debates via information

technology, has also gained importance be
cause, according to computer science profes
sor Eric Roberts, the Internet cannot be cen
sored because that might be a violation of the
First Amendment and would be difficult to
implement.
With such a high flow of unrestricted data
on the Internet, Ivester hopes "to change be
haviors by giving people the information they
need to make the right decisions and be re
sponsible," especially here on the Farm.
"Stanford has the opportunity to take a
leadership role in the national higher educa
tion scene regarding the challenges of digital
citizenship," he said.
