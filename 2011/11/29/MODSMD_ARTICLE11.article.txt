# NOTES FROM ABROAD
## A 						PEACEFUL PROTEST 
### â€“ Erika Alvero Koski 
At 3 p.m. one Sunday afternoon, as our lit
tle Stanford contingent clustered togeth
er outside the OK Market, the Plaza
Italia and streets surrounding the Baque
dano statue swarmed with a festively
garbed crowd of all ages, milling about and gathering
on the street to form a line. Vendors hawked their
wares, selling banners with the words "La educacion
es un derecho" ("Education is a right") spanning the
red, white and blue of the Chilean flag. Other aspir
ing entrepreneurs took advantage of the scorching
hot sun beating down on the marchers and were sell
ing ice cream and jugo natural (fresh fruit juice). Had
I not known that it was a student march, I would
have mistaken the gathering crowd as one for a con
cert or a soccer game.

The relaxed chatter of the participants marked a
stark contrast to the unauthorized protest I had seen
before, with carabinero (Chilean police officer) tanks
running through the crowds and scattering the protes
tors with spurts of water and tear gas. In that protest
there was a clear division between the student protes

tors, who were there to protest against the education
system, and the rabble-rousers, who were there just
for the thrill of the protest, playing tag, throwing paint
at the carabineros' tanks and breaking street lamps.
This time it was instead an exciting Sunday after
noon family activity. Protestors chanted, "Y va a caer
la educacion de Pinochet " ("Down with the education
of Augusto Pinochet," who was president from 1973-
1989). Many elderly marchers carried signs reading
"Los abuelos apoyamos a nuestros nietos " ("Grand
parents support our grandchildren"), and further sup
port arrived later, as the protestors' path wound
under apartment buildings. Residents from above
sprinkled water over the sweating marchers down
below, some actually pulling out shower heads and
hoses to cheers of "agua" (water) from the street.
The protest culminated at Parque Almagro, where
student activists gave enthusiastic speeches and
artists played " cumbia ," a type of Latin American
music, to a wildly dancing audience.
