# 'OCCUPY' ABROAD
## 
### â€“ Kara Murray 
In every country I have visit
ed thus far, I have always ex
perienced a moment of disil
lusionment, when I realize
that my wondrous destina
tion is also affected by hardships
and inequality. In Spain, I was sure
that this moment would come
while watching the 5 million
strong protests on unemployment.
To put those into perspective,
Spain's population is only slightly
larger than California's. It has the
highest unemployment rate of any
industrialized country.
I imagined that I would see a
small sect of protesters working
against the government and a
larger number of citizens who
would disagree with their claims.
Then, on Oct. 15,1 walked out
my door to Gran Via, the largest
street in Madrid, planning to go
on a peaceful run. Instead, I ran
into a seemingly endless stream
of protesters who had closed
down the road and migrated to
ward the Plaza del Sol. Signs were
held high, people played instru
ments and danced among the dis

content. Yet it wasn't angry. It was
about positive sentimientos, to
show what was wanted, but not to
dwell on the wrong.
In Spain, the protests are not
new. They have gone on here
since May 15. For months, thou
sands of protestors camped out in
Plaza del Sol, crowding the streets
to such a degree that they became
impossible to traverse.
In addition to this particular
movement, protests have been
conducted against cuts to public
education. Whole families, includ
ing babies in strollers, wore green
T-shirts reading " Escuela publica:
de todas para todas " ("Public
school: of all for all").
These protests are not consid
ered fringe movements and are
embraced by the majority of
Spaniards.
Like everywhere else, there
are things that must be fixed. But
my love of this country has not
wavered, and I can't imagine a
better educational experience.
