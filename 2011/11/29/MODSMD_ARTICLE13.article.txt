## I'M DONE WITH MY LIFE Ducks in December 
### Camira Powell 
Can you see it? The light at the
end of the tunnel, AKA winter
break, AKA the end of finals
and our first chance to breathe that
wonderful sigh of relief that comes
with closing out one of the more hec
tic quarters of the year. I can, and I
have never been more thankful to
flip to the final month in my calen
dar, December.
I wanted to make a grand analo
gy about how we have reached the
end of a long journey, which has been
a long time coming. But let's be real
here, this upcoming break is just a
break. More or less a rest stop on the
road of life, if I want to get metaphor
ical with it. Scary thought, huh? Here
we are, limping to the finish line, only
to be told the race is not over yet. Oh
no, buddy. Some of the fun hasn't
even started.
Someone once asked me what I
thought about the conundrum of
students being afraid to voice the
stress and strain they feel, trying to
take on the world without letting
anyone see them sweat. To me, that
was a pretty accurate description of
cue dramatic music "The
Duck Syndrome." The Duck Syn
drome (which will henceforth be af
fectionately called TDS) is the idea
that we are all ducks, looking cool,
calm and collected on the surface,
but underneath our little feet are
paddling like crazy to keep us afloat.
No duck wants to admit to another
duck how much of a struggle it is to
keep his or her head above water,
even though every other duck is in
the same position. TDS is something
that's not unique to Stanford, but it's
definitely übiquitous.
I'm pretty sure revealing your
weakness to the public goes against
rule #1 in "The Art of War" play
book, but saying nothing could be
even more damaging. If we keep
paddling, what happens when we're
too tired to go on? No one wants to
see a duck's heart give out. That's not
cute. And what does a duck's heart
failure look like? Well, it comes in a
variety of forms. From a student
turned-zombie who hasn't slept
more than three hours a night in the
last month falling asleep everywhere
on campus, to that kid in lecture
who's been sick with something re
sembling whooping cough for eight
out of 10 weeks but refuses to stay
home and get better for fear of miss
ing some critical information. Or
breaking out in a cold sweat because
you just realized that your exam, 15-

minute presentation and 20-page re
search paper are all due the day be
fore the event you planned for your
student group. And, of course,
there's always the classic psychotic
breakdown.

But most of the time we talk
about these situations, we do it with
an air of nonchalance, like it's not
only inevitable, but also mandatory.
Late nights, ridiculously early morn
ings and moments of near insanity
just amount to more stories from the
trenches that we'll one day tell our
grandchildren. We display these bat
tle wounds with pride, seeing who's
gone through worse and lived to talk
about it.

At a place that encourages stu
dents to do more, work smarter and
be better, we become used to doing
the absolute most all the time. So we
often forget that it's when we take a
step back and do a little less than
nothing that things finally start get
ting done. If you need proof, just look
at your own life. Chances are you
know of at least one instance when
you (or a friend) aced a test you did
n't study for, or you (or a friend)
bagged a breezy by saying hello. This
is not to say that we should all run
around not doing anything to get
anywhere in life. Some effort is re
quired. Really, it's about knowing
that in certain situations, less can be
a lot more.

There's a beauty to doing noth
ing. It might be hard to realize or
admit that fact, but it's something
worth discovering, and the upcom
ing winter break is the perfect time
to start exploring. Realistically, we're
all going to have TDS for life, and
that's why we'll go off and run the
world (if we want to). That doesn't
mean we can't have moments of rest
and relaxation in between, though. If
a duck can leave the water to take a
nap, so can we. And my calendar tells
me there will be plenty of time for
that this December.

reader emails. Send her one at

At a place that encourages stu
dents to do more, work smarter and
be better, we become used to doing
the absolute most all the time. So we
often forget that it's when we take a
step back and do a little less than
nothing that things finally start get
ting done. If you need proof, just look
at your own life. Chances are you
know of at least one instance when
you (or a friend) aced a test you did
n't study for, or you (or a friend)
bagged a breezy by saying hello. This
is not to say that we should all run
around not doing anything to get
anywhere in life. Some effort is re
quired. Really, it's about knowing
that in certain situations, less can be
a lot more.

There's a beauty to doing noth
ing. It might be hard to realize or
admit that fact, but it's something
worth discovering, and the upcom
ing winter break is the perfect time
to start exploring. Realistically, we're
all going to have TDS for life, and
that's why we'll go off and run the
world (if we want to). That doesn't
mean we can't have moments of rest
and relaxation in between, though. If
a duck can leave the water to take a
nap, so can we. And my calendar tells
me there will be plenty of time for
that this December.

Camira might be suffering from TDS,
but she's never too busy to respond to
reader emails. Send her one at
