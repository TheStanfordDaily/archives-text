# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## The 						politics of 'honesty' 
### Nina Chung 
I have had epic crushes. These
crushes of mine, as many girls
might know, were characterized
by a disproportionate amount of
time spent thinking about a particu
lar boy. All of these epochal crashes
resulted, sooner or later, in the boy
discovering the dramatic secret. But
they were never informed through
the grapevine, oh no. Rather, the
messenger was me, face-to-face and
heart all aflutter every time. Indeed,
even after the huge heart-wrenching
feelings had faded, I always resolved
to express my feelings. It seemed the
right thing to do, really; I was always
convinced that he deserved to know
the real story, considering it ultimate
ly had everything to do with him.
That habit of mine was one of the
consequences of my deep belief in
honesty.

Back in those days, honesty was
crystal clear. It was unique for being
simultaneously mature and simple:
one told either the entire story or not
the entire story. I believe in open
communication and no lying, in
being frank and avoiding "hints." But
honesty also comes into our expres
sion of opinions about others, and
these days the nuances of this side are
creeping slowly into focus. Honesty
will always be my best policy, but the
fine print beckons. When is "just
being honest" an excuse for self-pro
motion? When does it just entangle
others' lives? When is it just plain
selfish?

These are the questions that
began haunting me recently, after I
ignited a bomb of a discussion with
someone I care very much about by
conveying a few... honest things. I
told her my opinion on specific
events of late. I told her about certain
characteristics I saw in her that I did
n't think that she herself realized. I
told her how these things were affect
ing me. Well, it wasn't all frill and
fancy, and both of us were significant
ly affected. During and immediately
after that talk, reaching back to my
motives for starting it, my justifica
tion was that I could somehow help
her by revealing these thoughts of

mine. Having more time between the
event and me, though, shows me dif
ferently. I had translated many of the
beliefs that had been forming in my
head these past few years and had
laid them on the table. I'm realizing
now that she didn't need to hear all of
them, and what she heard hurt her in
away I didn't expect. Neither of us
regrets the conversation, even if we
regret the execution; it's funny how
I've known her all of my life, and still
we learned years' worth of things
about each other in that hour. But it
taught me something about my need
for what might be called full disclo
sure. When I think of my motives
now, I wonder if there was more self
interest involved in getting my seem
ingly smart opinion out than I want
ed to admit.
Over time, I've become very
aware of my high regard for my own
opinion relative to others'. I used to
bristle frequently at recommenda
tions, suggestions and other arbitrary
things I insecurely regarded as con
descension. Apparently, I much pre
ferred to let my voice loose at the ex
pense of anyone else's contribution.
But it's caused so many unnecessary
complications. Sometimes I think
we're too confident in our own un
derstanding of other people, who
they are and what's best for them.
Then we let these ideas spiral right
out into the world and out of our con
trol. In a sense, it's being honest. In
another sense, it's being irresponsi
ble. And beyond that, it's an assump
tion that we're legitimate enough to
make such calls on another person's
life, even if we qualify ourselves with,
"Well, I think she's ..." or "No of
fense, but..."

Once upon a time, we were kids
who said all sorts of crazy things we
didn't think mattered beyond the
playground. By now, we've accumu
lated a lot more stuff in our heads
that tend to persuade us exactly the
opposite. I've been realizing how
much damage our words can do, es
pecially because, despite being hon
est, they're too easily misplaced,
one-sided and insensitive to our lis
tener's ears. Most importantly,
they're too easily used for self-glori
fying purposes that have little to do
with our listener anyway.
I'm all for honesty, no less than be
fore. But now I'm just starting to see
where the need for wisdom kicks in.

things I insecurely regarded as con
descension. Apparently, I much pre
ferred to let my voice loose at the ex
pense of anyone else's contribution.
But it's caused so many unnecessary
complications. Sometimes I think
we're too confident in our own un
derstanding of other people, who
they are and what's best for them.
Then we let these ideas spiral right
out into the world and out of our con
trol. In a sense, it's being honest. In
another sense, it's being irresponsi
ble. And beyond that, it's an assump
tion that we're legitimate enough to
make such calls on another person's
life, even if we qualify ourselves with,
"Well, I think she's ..." or "No of
fense, but..."

Once upon a time, we were kids
who said all sorts of crazy things we
didn't think mattered beyond the
playground. By now, we've accumu
lated a lot more stuff in our heads
that tend to persuade us exactly the
opposite. I've been realizing how
much damage our words can do, es
pecially because, despite being hon
est, they're too easily misplaced,
one-sided and insensitive to our lis
tener's ears. Most importantly,
they're too easily used for self-glori
fying purposes that have little to do
with our listener anyway.
I'm all for honesty, no less than be
fore. But now I'm just starting to see
where the need for wisdom kicks in.

Hopefully you don't find this column
