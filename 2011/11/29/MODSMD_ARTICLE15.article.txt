Editor's Note: As a continuation of
the conversation The Daily has en
gaged in by covering aspects of the
Occupy movement, we are pub
lishing a series of original op-eds
written by Stanford students affili
ated with the Occupy the Future
group, which formed on our cam
pus. These student op-eds repre
sent part of a series of op-eds by
Stanford faculty and students. The
complete series will be available
on Boston Review online at
bostonreview.net. Below is a state
ment from the group that intro
duces the overall effort and the stu
dent pieces.

The Occupy protests have
accomplished a great deal.
They have galvanized
many forms of public response to
the glaring inequalities of wealth
and income that now character
ize American society. We are in
sympathy with those protests.
But it isn't parks or public spaces
we aspire to occupy. It is the fu
ture of our country that is at stake
and that we hope to help shape
to occupy through our ac
tions. For this broader Occupy
movement to grow, it will require
other groups outside encamp
ments to mobilize other con
stituencies, by other means,
around other issues.
That is what we, a coalition of
faculty, staff, undergraduate and
graduate students operating
under the name of Occupy the
Future, intend to do at Stanford.
We call on the entire Stanford
community, together with a host
of groups from the Bay Area, to
join in a rally on White Plaza on
Friday, Dec. 9 from 1:30 to 3:00
p.m. We do not, however, mean
for this to be a one-time event. In
stead, we intend to coordinate a
series of activities that point to
the future, including numerous
opinion articles (appearing in
Boston Review and The Stanford
Daily), two upcoming teach-in
events centered around film
viewings, a host of discussions be
fore and an open forum following
the Dec. 9 rally.
In undertaking these activi
ties, we are motivated by three

mam issues.
The first is the deep and grow
ing division between the haves
and have-nots. Across multiple
areas of life health, education,
income, housing we see the
greatest inequalities the United
States has known since at least the
Great Depression. "We are the 99
percent" is not a mere rhetorical
device. It's consistent with data
showing that over the past decade
only the top 1 percent of wage
earners has seen their incomes
rise. The next 2 to 5 percent has
experienced flat wages, and
everyone else has experienced a
drop in earnings. The general
trend toward increasing inequali
ty has been going on for 30 years,
but has now reached unprece
dented levels. The top 1 percent
has claimed nearly all of the
growth in personal income over
the past 20 years, with most of that
accruing to the top .1 percent.
Consider this staggering fact: in
2009 the net worth of the 400
wealthiest households in the
United States exceeded that of
the bottom 50 percent of all
American households; 400 fami
lies have more than 155 million
Americans.
But extreme inequality is not
the only issue. The second prob
lem is that many of the inequali
ties we see have undone the
American Dream of opportunity
for all and instead fuel corruption
of our very democracy. We claim
to be a country committed to a
fair contest in which everyone,
rich or poor, has an equal oppor
tunity to get a job and get ahead,
where hard work and playing by
the rules will lead to a decent life,
not poverty. But instead, social
mobility in the United States is
de clining. One third of Americans
are in poverty or near poverty
while the government bails out
rich Wall Street bankers and
largely ignores the rest of the
country, including the 14 million
who are out of work and looking
for a job. We look away as CEOs
cut sweetheart deals that secure
for them extraordinary compen
sation even as their firms fail.
The gap between the 1 percent

and the 99 percent has helped to
create an environment where
state policies are responsive to
the rich, not the many; where
politicians are responsive to
wealthy individuals and corpora
tions, not the many. The upshot is
a staggering lack of accountabili
ty for those who led us into eco
nomic crisis. Meaningful democ
racy cannot exist when monied in
terests can buy elections and
when lobbyists can buy legisla
tion. More than two-thirds of
Americans support increasing
taxes on the 1 percent, but our
elected representatives in Con
gress fail to respond.
Finally, there is the issue of
finding away to manage the econ
omy and provide a decent life for
all in away that is environmental
ly sustainable. No solution to the
problems of climate disruption
can be found that does not in
volve the developed world reduc
ing its level of carbon emissions.
But special interests motivat
ed by a desire to protect profits
have continually blocked regula
tions that seek to accomplish this
task and deal with other critical
environmental problems. Creat
ing jobs is important, but we must
also find ways to make our econo
my sustainable. We can hardly
hope to Occupy the Future if
there is no future to occupy.
