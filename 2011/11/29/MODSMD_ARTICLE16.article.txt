## Occupy the Future: Beyond the honor roll 
### RON ALFA M.D./Ph.D. Candidate, Stanford University School of Medicine 
Stanford students, and Ameri
cans generally, are inculcated
with a strong attachment to
the notion of meritocracy: that suc
cess in some area is distributed
based upon merit. Nowhere does
this seem more prevalent than in
education. We are submitted to ex
amination from our earliest years,
and our performance may ulti
mately decide our class standing,
both in school and in society. If our
education system is meritocratic,
then how do we define merit, and
in what context is it expressed?
Importantly, how do inequalities
define this context?

My parents were immigrants.
Sitting at about double the pover
ty line, they used most of their in
come and burned through their
savings to enroll me in private
school for the first three years of
my education. This was unsustain
able. And so 1 moved to a public
school during third grade, where
something remarkable happened
I became a phenomenal stu
dent. The reality is, much of the
material I was then being taught at
public school I had already
learned, and in more detail, in my
previous semesters at the private
school. My teachers were im
pressed by my "intelligence."
In this case, a small inequality
created by my prior education
increased my merit in the eyes

of my instructors, and I was recom
mended for an advanced middle
school. To be sure, the effect was
real. I certainly had an easier time
comprehending material that I
had previously learned. The types
of inequalities that enrich the per
formance of an individual are
widespread in education and strat
ified by socioeconomic status. Just
consider how many undergradu
ates at top universities spend their
free time tutoring middle and high
school students at no less than $6O
per hour. Indeed, it is no coinci
dence that children of educated
parents fare better in school. Soci
ety cannot expect to eliminate
these inequalities. They will always
exist to some degree or another,
but they ensure that meritocracy is
never grounded in a fully level
playing field.
I attended a very average mid
dle school and was enrolled in very
average courses. My parents were
not educated, and did not under
stand the class stratification of the
public school system. We were an
unruly and unmotivated group of
students often at odds with a
young and inexperienced teacher.
My most salient lesson from sev
enth-grade math was learning how
to fire paper projectiles with rub
ber bands. Receiving my schedule
the second semester of that year, I
realized that by mistake or inter

vention I had been moved to an
"honors" math class. This class was
much smaller, with half the stu
dents, all of whom were quiet and
attentive. But on day one, I was al
ready too far behind to catch up. I
returned to my previous class.
This second type of inequality is
one that need not exist. It involves
the stratification or segregation
of students into classes based on
false or incomplete measures of
merit. It creates institutional in
equalities whereby those students
already benefitting from inequali
ties rooted outside the classroom
(in families and socioeconomic cir
cumstances) are given the in
creased benefit of inequalities
within the classroom, such as per
sonalized attention, smaller classes
and more experienced instructors.
Education is cumulative, and the
gap between the advantaged and
disadvantaged group widens year
ly. I know this because I spent two
years catching up on high school
math before even beginning calcu
lus at community college. These
types of inequalities create long
lasting disparities, even if individu
als manage to "catch-up." Every
day, in simple conversation with
classmates, I'm reminded of how
large the gap is and where my own
deficiencies remain. More impor
tantly, institutional inequalities cut
against the claim that educational
opportunity is based on a merito
cratic system.

We can no longer accept a social
mobility grounded in rare or heroic
examples. Students of all socioeco
nomic backgrounds should occupy
the future of our institutes of higher
learning. Inequalities exist, and they
will always exist. But if we wish to
progress toward a more just society,
we must stop building them into our
institutions.
