## Cal rivalry encourages school pride 
### Tom Taylor 
I got some criticism from friends
and enemies alike for not show
ing sufficient enthusiasm and
spirit in the wake of the Stan
ford football team's defeat to
Oregon in my last column. Perhaps
frustration got the better of me after
a game that promised so much but, at
least for Cardinal fans, never quite
delivered. Whatever excuse I can
muster, though, karma paid me back
for showing weakness nine Red
Zone points or not, something went
wrong when I showed up for the Big
Game. As I scanned my ID card to
enter the stadium, I discovered I had
n't been allocated a ticket.

In an ironic twist of fate, this was
probably the one game at which my
presence and my voice would have
made a difference. As palatable as
watching football in the California
sun might be, my British upbringing
makes it hard to take the job of a fan
seriously unless you have to deal with
at least a little rain. Watching on TV, I
couldn't believe the stadium was so
empty on such a perfectly cold and
miserable evening.
It was heartbreaking to sit at
home alone through the single most
important game Stanford will play all
season. Forget Oregon, forget the
supposed rivalry with USC and for
get any BCS bowl or even national
championship aspirations win
ning this game and holding on to the
Axe will always matter more. Every
sports team on campus varsity
and club wants to beat Cal, and
they all get their chance, from the Big
Splash to the Big Spike. It doesn't
end with real athletes either; among
other rivalry clashes in the week be
fore the Big Game, the two schools'
quiz bowl teams squared off, and just
a few short hours before the crowds
packed into Stanford Stadium, The
Stanford Daily itself welcomed The
Daily Californian to campus for the
annual Ink Bowl, an event that has
been taking place for at least the past
40 years.

It is these side-events that make
the Big Game mean as much as it
does. There are only a very few lucky
individuals on campus who can claim
to have represented the Cardinal on
the football field against another
school, but there are hundreds,
maybe thousands who have battled
Cal in some way at some point in
their Stanford careers. Standing up
alongside your fellow students and
seeing the whites of the eyes of those
Golden Bears, you get to feel how
much this rivalry matters. More than
any amount of standing faceless
among a crowd, you assume person
al responsibility for the win.
Big Game day was not a great day
just because Stanford held on to the
Axe. The icing on the cake was re
taining the Exacto Knife with a 42-21
win and sending the Daily Cal home
without even the consolation prize of
a boat-race win. With this victory The
Daily extended its winning streak to
three games over its most hated
and only rival.
Playing flag football, or in fact
any version of football, was a new ex
perience for this international stu
dent, and I cannot claim to have
shown much prowess on the field
that honor should probably go to our
part-time managing editor of
sports/part-time quarterback and to
the showing by The Daily's business
team. What I did do, though, was put
my body on the line even if an old
injury and being wrestled by a Cal
player in a blatant case of holding
limited me to just three downs
and stand up for my friends and fel
low students. I even managed to
demonstrate far better football
knowledge than both the Cal players
and their so-called coach. At more
than one point we had to walk on the
field to disrupt play when a Golden
Bear had his flags tied on so tight he
could drag the Stanford player grab
bing them along with him, and also
when their players took flag football
so seriously they committed in
fringements for holding and rough
ness that wouldn't even be legal in
real football.

In my fourth proper year of life as
a grad student on the Farm, I finally
feel I have earned the right to wear
cardinal, and no matter how many
points I might have in my student
ticket account, or whether I success
fully navigate the online ticketing
system, I deserve my place in the Red
Zone. Go Card.

football to a possible career as a refer

in the Notre Dame game as the Ink
Bowl at tom.taylor@stanford.edu.
