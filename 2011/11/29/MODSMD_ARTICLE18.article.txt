# DERRICK LEADS CARD IN NCAAs
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Halfway through last Monday's
NCAA Cross Country Champi
onship race, the No. 5 Stanford
men's team was sitting in second
place with two runners in the top 11.
Heavy favorite No. 1 Wisconsin was
already seemingly in cruise control
for the team title the Badgers
were just two places away from hav
ing five runners garner Ail-Ameri
can honors but the Cardinal was
putting on an impressive showing
without its No. 3 runner, redshirt

junior Benjamin Johnson, who was
sidelined with a foot injury.
Over the next 5,000 meters, No. 2
Oklahoma State, No. 6 Colorado
and No. 3 BYU all snuck past Stan
ford to knock head coach Jason
Dunn's team off the podium by a
mere four points. But senior Chris
Derrick ran one of the best races of
his already impressive collegiate ca
reer, outkicking lona's Leonard
Korir down the stretch to match
Ryan Hall 'O5 and Neftalem Araia
'OB for the best NCAA position in
Stanford history with a runner-up
finish in the individual race.

The No. 13 women's team ran a
solid race, earning the squad its first
top-10 finish since 2008 in a very
crowded field. Junior Kathy
Kroeger paced the Card with a 21st
place finish on the 6-kilometer
course and was joined by redshirt
senior Stephanie Marcy as an Ail-
American, the first such honor for
both runners in cross country.
On a cold, cloudy day in Terre
Haute, Ind., the races on both sides
were sizzling. Despite finishing in
28:57.5, Derrick was 13 seconds be
hind winner Lawi Lalang of Ari
zona. Lalang competing in just

his first season of cross country
capped off an undefeated season
with the win and added a course
record in the process.
Teammate and fellow senior
Jake Riley hung with Derrick and
the lead pack for the first several
kilometers before Lalang threw
down the gauntlet as he has in al
most every race this season and
surged ahead after two miles.
Southern Utah's Cameron
Levins and Korir went with him, but
no one could catch the Kenyan as he
burned the field and opened up a 14-
second gap less than a mile after
making his move.
Derrick, who has a reputation
for closing fast, chose to hang back
and not try to run with Lalang, in
stead coming on strong in the final
kilometers to first pass Levins, Ore
gon's Luke Puskedra and Wiscon
sin's Mohammed Ahmed, and final
ly kick past Korir in the final 300
meters to finish second. Riley was
an All-American for the second
straight year after crossing the line
in 18 th place.
After the race, Derrick said he
had mixed emotions despite his
fourth consecutive top-10 finish and
felt there were a few lingering ques
tions in his mind about what could
have been.
"I still feel like I left here without
being 100-percent happy, as a team
and as an individual," he said. "Our
highest finish was third place as
freshmen, and at the time I was
happy but felt like there was more
on the horizon, and we never ac
complished our goal of winning a
national championship as a team,
and it's a little disappointing.
"Races like these are won and
lost on the margins, not talent-wise
or work-ethic-wise," Derrick added.
"I don't think I ran a courageous
race. I think I ran smart and ran
tough, but I had to depend on other
people to slip up. But there are
questions I have to ask myself. I
know the way that I ran which was
planned, but did I run the race that
gave me the best chance to win? At
the end of the day, I think it was the
right decision, but there's always
some lingering doubt."
Stanford did, however, have one
of its better showings this season on
the national stage. Sophomore An
drew Berberick surprised many by

coming in 55th overall, 10 places
ahead of Brendan Gregg in the red
shirt senior's final race.

Sophomore Erik Olson com
pleted the Cardinal's scoring by fin
ishing 127 th but improved his time
and place from last year's race.
"I thought we ran pretty well,"
Dunn said. "I can't remember a race
that so closely followed the rank
ings. I think that just shows how
good all the top teams were this sea
son. It hurts to miss the podium by
such a small margin, but all of the
teams ahead of us ran really well."

The same was true on the
women's side, where just 27 points
separated the top four teams, and
several schools had surprising re
sults. No. 4 Georgetown took the
team title with 162 points, holding
No. 3 Washington eight points back,
two-time defending champion Vil
lanova 19 behind and heavy pre
race favorite No. 1 Florida State 26
points off the pace.
But the field had plenty of other
notable finishes No. 8 Arizona
came in 19th, No. 6 Colorado
slipped to 11th and No. 16 Oregon
stormed to a fifth-place finish be
hind a great race from junior Jordan
Hasay.
Hasay finished second to Vil
lanova's Sheila Reid, who won her
second straight individual crown
with a big kick to shake Hasay in the
final 50 meters.

The Cardinal was done in by a
lack of depth in the end, as the
team's fourth and fifth runners
sophomore Jessica Tonn and junior
Claire Durkin finished in 111 th
and 192 nd place, respectively.
With the cross country season
complete, many of the runners on
both teams will turn their attention
to indoor track, where Stanford
should have one of the strongest
sides in the nation, with Derrick and
senior Elliott Heath forming a for
midable duo.

Ryan Hall 'O5 and Neftalem Araia
'OB for the best NCAA position in
Stanford history with a runner-up
finish in the individual race.

The No. 13 women's team ran a
solid race, earning the squad its first
top-10 finish since 2008 in a very
crowded field. Junior Kathy
Kroeger paced the Card with a 21st
place finish on the 6-kilometer
course and was joined by redshirt
senior Stephanie Marcy as an Ail-
American, the first such honor for
both runners in cross country.
On a cold, cloudy day in Terre
Haute, Ind., the races on both sides
were sizzling. Despite finishing in
28:57.5, Derrick was 13 seconds be
hind winner Lawi Lalang of Ari
zona. Lalang competing in just

his first season of cross country
capped off an undefeated season
with the win and added a course
record in the process.
Teammate and fellow senior
Jake Riley hung with Derrick and
the lead pack for the first several
kilometers before Lalang threw
down the gauntlet as he has in al
most every race this season and
surged ahead after two miles.
Southern Utah's Cameron
Levins and Korir went with him, but
no one could catch the Kenyan as he
burned the field and opened up a 14-
second gap less than a mile after
making his move.
Derrick, who has a reputation
for closing fast, chose to hang back
and not try to run with Lalang, in
stead coming on strong in the final
kilometers to first pass Levins, Ore
gon's Luke Puskedra and Wiscon
sin's Mohammed Ahmed, and final
ly kick past Korir in the final 300
meters to finish second. Riley was
an All-American for the second
straight year after crossing the line
in 18 th place.
After the race, Derrick said he
had mixed emotions despite his
fourth consecutive top-10 finish and
felt there were a few lingering ques
tions in his mind about what could
have been.
"I still feel like I left here without
being 100-percent happy, as a team
and as an individual," he said. "Our
highest finish was third place as
freshmen, and at the time I was
happy but felt like there was more
on the horizon, and we never ac
complished our goal of winning a
national championship as a team,
and it's a little disappointing.
"Races like these are won and
lost on the margins, not talent-wise
or work-ethic-wise," Derrick added.
"I don't think I ran a courageous
race. I think I ran smart and ran
tough, but I had to depend on other
people to slip up. But there are
questions I have to ask myself. I
know the way that I ran which was
planned, but did I run the race that
gave me the best chance to win? At
the end of the day, I think it was the
right decision, but there's always
some lingering doubt."
Stanford did, however, have one
of its better showings this season on
the national stage. Sophomore An
drew Berberick surprised many by

coming in 55th overall, 10 places
ahead of Brendan Gregg in the red
shirt senior's final race.

Sophomore Erik Olson com
pleted the Cardinal's scoring by fin
ishing 127 th but improved his time
and place from last year's race.
"I thought we ran pretty well,"
Dunn said. "I can't remember a race
that so closely followed the rank
ings. I think that just shows how
good all the top teams were this sea
son. It hurts to miss the podium by
such a small margin, but all of the
teams ahead of us ran really well."

The same was true on the
women's side, where just 27 points
separated the top four teams, and
several schools had surprising re
sults. No. 4 Georgetown took the
team title with 162 points, holding
No. 3 Washington eight points back,
two-time defending champion Vil
lanova 19 behind and heavy pre
race favorite No. 1 Florida State 26
points off the pace.
But the field had plenty of other
notable finishes No. 8 Arizona
came in 19th, No. 6 Colorado
slipped to 11th and No. 16 Oregon
stormed to a fifth-place finish be
hind a great race from junior Jordan
Hasay.
Hasay finished second to Vil
lanova's Sheila Reid, who won her
second straight individual crown
with a big kick to shake Hasay in the
final 50 meters.

The Cardinal was done in by a
lack of depth in the end, as the
team's fourth and fifth runners
sophomore Jessica Tonn and junior
Claire Durkin finished in 111 th
and 192 nd place, respectively.
With the cross country season
complete, many of the runners on
both teams will turn their attention
to indoor track, where Stanford
should have one of the strongest
sides in the nation, with Derrick and
senior Elliott Heath forming a for
midable duo.

Halfway through last Monday's
NCAA Cross Country Champi
onship race, the No. 5 Stanford
men's team was sitting in second
place with two runners in the top 11.
Heavy favorite No. 1 Wisconsin was
already seemingly in cruise control
for the team title the Badgers
were just two places away from hav
ing five runners garner Ail-Ameri
can honors but the Cardinal was
putting on an impressive showing
without its No. 3 runner, redshirt

junior Benjamin Johnson, who was
sidelined with a foot injury.
Over the next 5,000 meters, No. 2
Oklahoma State, No. 6 Colorado
and No. 3 BYU all snuck past Stan
ford to knock head coach Jason
Dunn's team off the podium by a
mere four points. But senior Chris
Derrick ran one of the best races of
his already impressive collegiate ca
reer, outkicking lona's Leonard
Korir down the stretch to match
