### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Halfway through last Monday's
NCAA Cross Country Champi
onship race, the No. 5 Stanford
men's team was sitting in second
place with two runners in the top 11.
Heavy favorite No. 1 Wisconsin was
already seemingly in cruise control
for the team title the Badgers
were just two places away from hav
ing five runners garner Ail-Ameri
can honors but the Cardinal was
putting on an impressive showing
without its No. 3 runner, redshirt

junior Benjamin Johnson, who was
sidelined with a foot injury.
Over the next 5,000 meters, No. 2
Oklahoma State, No. 6 Colorado
and No. 3 BYU all snuck past Stan
ford to knock head coach Jason
Dunn's team off the podium by a

Derrick ran one of the best races of

Korir down the stretch to match
Ryan Hall 'O5 and Neftalem Araia
'OB for the best NCAA position in
Stanford history with a runner-up
finish in the individual race.

The No. 13 women's team ran a
solid race, earning the squad its first
top-10 finish since 2008 in a very
crowded field. Junior Kathy
Kroeger paced the Card with a 21st
place finish on the 6-kilometer
course and was joined by redshirt
senior Stephanie Marcy as an Ail-
American, the first such honor for
both runners in cross country.
On a cold, cloudy day in Terre
Haute, Ind., the races on both sides
were sizzling. Despite finishing in
28:57.5, Derrick was 13 seconds be
hind winner Lawi Lalang of Ari
zona. Lalang competing in just

his first season of cross country
capped off an undefeated season
with the win and added a course
record in the process.
Teammate and fellow senior
Jake Riley hung with Derrick and
the lead pack for the first several
kilometers before Lalang threw
down the gauntlet as he has in al
most every race this season and
surged ahead after two miles.
Southern Utah's Cameron
Levins and Korir went with him, but
no one could catch the Kenyan as he
