# LOSING SKID
## 
### PALANI ESWARAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was a long afternoon for the
Cardinal wrestling team on Sun
day. The team lost its third match
in a row, this time to No. 11 Mis
souri (3-1) in Burnham Pavilion
by a score of 26-9. Stanford (4-4)
won just three of the afternoon's
10 matches. Top-ranked redshirt
senior Nick Amuchastegui, No. 5
junior Ryan Mango and sopho
more Dan Scherer each recorded
wins at 174 pounds, 133 pounds
and heavyweight, respectively.

Both Amuchastegui and
Mango looked impressive and
won important matches, with
Amuchastegui taking on No. 5
Dorian Henderson. The Ail-
American wrestled well both on
the mat and on his feet, recording
a takedown and an escape and
defeating Henderson 3-0. Mango
faced off against No. 13 Nathan
McCormick in a tough match,
eventually earning the decision
9-5.
Both Mango and Amuchastegui
faced their toughest tests of the sea
son. Prior to Sunday, Mango had
not wrestled a ranked opponent,

and Amuchastegui hadn't faced a
top-five wrestler. Their ability to
take care of business against top
wrestlers in their weight class
bodes well for the rest of the sea
son and will help their seeding at
the NCAA Tournament in March.
Amuchastegui's win was his
102 nd, bringing him to sixth on the
all-time career wins list at Stan
ford. Amuchastegui won his 100 th
match against Central Michigan
last week with a major decision
over the Chippewas' Anthony
Brill.
Another bright spot for the
Cardinal was the season debut of
redshirt sophomores Bret Baum
bach at 165 pounds and Richard
Kessler at 197 pounds. Both
wrestlers lost but wrestled tough.
Baumbach lost 6-2 to No. 13 Zach
Toal, and Kessler lost to No. 12
Brent Haynes by a score of 5-3.
But there weren't too many
positives to take from the dual.
Redshirt junior Timmy Boone at
149 pounds, freshman Josh Laud
erdale at 157 pounds, redshirt
junior Spence Patrick at 184
pounds, redshirt junior Matt Sen
cenbaugh at 125 pounds and
sophomore Donovan Halpin at
141 pounds were the other Cardi
nal wrestlers to lose on Sunday.
Of Stanford's seven losses, three
were by major decision and one
was by technical fall.
The Cardinal started the sea

son off 4-1 with dominating per
formances against North Central
College, Northern Illinois, Cal
State Bakersfield and Menlo Col
lege. The team's loss to top-15
Northwestern in the first dual of
the season almost seemed like a
fluke after Stanford's four straight
wins.
But since then the Card has lost
three straight to Central Michi
gan, Chattanooga and Missouri, a
trio of talented squads. Missouri is
ranked eleventh in the nation, and
Central Michigan and Chat
tanooga are undoubtedly the most
successful programs in their re
spective conferences.
Stanford's duals with Central
Michigan and Chattanooga were
much closer than the dual against
Missouri. Central Michigan won
by nine, and Chattanooga won by
seven. In both those meets, Stan
ford was one or two matches from
a win.
While Stanford has remained
competitive throughout the sea
son, the team still has not recorded
a win against a top-25 opponent
this year, and one has to wonder
how this team will fare against
top-tier opponents throughout
the rest of the season. In each of
Stanford's losses there have been
a few solid individual performanc
es, but the team has yet to put to
