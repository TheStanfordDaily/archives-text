# STUDENT LIFE
## Students urged to'say something 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN 
The Office of Alcohol Policy and
Education (OAPE) piloted a new
program called "Say Something"
Monday night, in an effort to encour
age students to intervene when their
peers engage in dangerous and nega
tive behaviors associated with alco
hol and drugs.
"What we are trying to do is just
challenge a culture of by-standing by
getting people to just act," said Ralph
Castro, director of the OAPE. "It is a
very simple concept."
The office, which the Office of the
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
founded this September in response
to growing concerns about alcohol
poisoning and binge drinking among
students, adapted the program from
materials developed by the Universi
ty of Pennsylvania.
The presentation focused on em
powering students to recognize when
a friend's behavior moves past occa
sional "bad nights" to a serious prob
lem that needs to be addressed, as
well as giving students strategies to
intervene in harmful situations.
With sections titled "What to
Look For," "What to Say" and
"Where to Go," the program encour
aged attendees to speak up as part of
a larger intervention. It also empha
sized the importance of individual
responsibility toward helping
strangers and best friends alike.

"We all have these great capes,
Superman and woman capes . . .
hanging up in our closet," Castro
said. "What we're saying is less Su
perman and more Clark Kent. We
want you to be there in the beginning
as Clark Kent and intervene. You
don't have to turn into Superman
every night. That's what we're going
for ... by giving people a presenta
tion and saying 'Hey, this is one
step.'"
The presenters reminded stu
dents that of the 64 students who
were taken to the hospital last year
for alcohol poisoning, not a single
one reported a friend saying some
thing to them about their alcohol
consumption. Every one of them,
however, wished that someone had.
In contrast with AlcoholEdu, the
online module that all freshmen
must complete before coming to
Stanford, Say Something has been
adapted specifically for Stanford and

is arranged by campus leaders.
Mark Duarte 'l4, who attended
the pilot with his fraternity Kappa
Sigma, said that the program was
"more personal" and "more relat
able" because it was "very cognizant
of issues specific to Stanford."
Say Something also focuses solely
on information about how peers can
help each other, while AlcoholEdu
educates students on how they can
keep themselves from dangerous or
harmful situations.
Made up of all males and mostly
members of the Greek community,
the student audience responded pos
itively to the presentation.
"I definitely thought it was valu
able," Stuart Upfill-Brown 'l3 said.
"I thought it was more complete,"
Duarte said. "It kind of tied all the is
sues [together]."

Jarreau Bowen '07 spoke Monday at "Say Something," an alcohol safety
training program organized by the Office of Alcohol Policy and Education. The
entirely male audience included several members of Greek organizations.
rector of OAPE, explained that the
office hopes to expand and enlarge
the program in the next few
months.
"Hopefully by winter quarter
we can do a couple of really large
scale Say Somethings where people
come out and share their stories,"
he said.
When asked whether it might re
place AlcoholEdu in the future,
Bowen said that although he wasn't
sure, he hopes the OAPE will con
tinue to improve AlcoholEdu in the
coming years.
"I would love and our office
has talked about it quite a bit to
develop something that is more
Stanford-focused than AlcoholEdu

is," Bowen said. "I think we have a
couple more years with AlcoholE
du," he later added.
So far this year, Bowen estimat
ed that alcohol-related hospital vis
its are about "on par with last year."
Castro said that because OAPE
has been attempting "a culture
change," effects will be only gradu
ally visible.
"In two months [since OAPE
was founded], although the alco
hol trends are similar to last year,
we are starting to see that we are
being infused into the culture,"
Bowen explained. "So now it's
about how do we keep that going .
.. Hopefully this time next quar
ter, and this time spring quarter,
and especially this time next year,
we start seeing differences in actu
al numbers."
