## Men's basketball routs Pacific 
### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
Returning home from a narrow
loss to No. 4 Syracuse, the Stanford
men's basketball team was on top of
its game last night, dominating Pa
cific 79-37.
The Cardinal (6-1) was led by
redshirt senior forward Josh Owens
and freshman guard Chasson Ran
dle, who both scored 14 points.
However, it was defense that kept
Stanford comfortably ahead of the
Tigers. Pacific (2-3) did not attempt
a free throw all game, as the Cardi
nal committed only nine fouls. The
Tigers shot just 30.2 percent from
the floor and 27.8 percent from the
three-point line. Travis Fulton had
13 points to lead Pacific, but no
other player scored more than six
points.
On the other hand, 12 different
Stanford players scored, and the
Cardinal shot 51.8 percent from the
field. Stanford led 38-23 at halftime
on the strength of 11 points from
Randle. For the game, the young
point guard made four of his five
three-point attempts.
Pacific got a quick three-pointer
to start the second half and cut the
lead to 12 at 40-28, but Stanford
went on a 39-6 run over a 17-minute
span to salt the game away.
"We had about eight bad posses
sions where we took six bad shots,
and made some really poor deci
sions," said Pacific head coach Bob
Thomason. "When we did that, it re
ally separated us in the score."
Overall, the Cardinal outscored
the Tigers 41-14 after the break to
coast back into the win column.
The team will now travel to the
Pacific Northwest to take on Seattle
University on Thursday.
