### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
With the cross country season
finished just a week ago, the Stan
ford teams were well-represented
on the Pac-12 All-Academic teams.
Leading the way were senior Chris
Derrick and redshirt junior Miles
Unterreiner, who were two of the 10
runners selected for the men's first
team. Redshirt junior Benjamin
Johnson was named to the second
team, as were junior Kathy Kroeger
and redshirt senior Madeline
Duhon on the women's side.
Derrick, Stanford's top runner
and this year's NCAA runner-up,
earns his second consecutive first
team selection thanks to his 3.86
grade-point average while majoring
in economics. Unterreiner is also a
repeat selection, having won an
Elite 88 Award in the past due to his
4.04 GPA while majoring in history.
Johnson, who was injured this
year and unable to compete at
NCAAs, has a 3.59 GPA while ma
joring in chemical engineering.
Kroeger, Stanford's leading runner
on the women's side, finished 21st
at NCAAs and has a GPA of 3.93
while majoring in mathematical
and computational science. Duhon
boasts a 3.90 GPA while majoring
in management science and engi
neering.

In addition, the Cardinal had 10
men and 11 women chosen as hon
orable mentions. The Stanford men
finished fifth and the women fin
ished 10th at the NCAA Champi
onships last week.
