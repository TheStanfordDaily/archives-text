### â€“ Jack Blanchat 
Both quarterback Andrew Luck and head
coach David Shaw took home some new hard
ware on Monday, as Luck was named the Pac
-12 Offensive Player of the Year for the second
consecutive season and Shaw was selected as
the Pac-12 Coach of the Year.

Thanks to Luck's sustained excellence,
Stanford completed another 11-1 season in
Shaw's first season leading the Cardinal. Under
Shaw's leadership, the Cardinal recorded back
to-back 11-win seasons for the first time in
school history and crafted an offense that cur
rently ranks fifth nationally in scoring (43.58
points per game) and 10th in total offense
(480.92 yards per game).

Luck, who broke his own school record with
35 touchdown passes in 2011, is only the fifth
player ever to be named the conference's of
fensive player of the year in consecutive sea
sons, joining USC's Reggie Bush and Charles
White, Washington State's Ruben Mayes and
Stanford's John Elway as the only players to do
so.

Luck also broke Elway's record for most
touchdown passes in school history, set a new
mark in total offense with 10,218 career yards

and now ranks first in school history with 31
wins as a starter.
In addition, Luck's recognition means the
Cardinal has now taken home the award in
three consecutive years, after Toby Gerhart
won the award in 2009.
