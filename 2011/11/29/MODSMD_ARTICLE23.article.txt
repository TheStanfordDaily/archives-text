## 
### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
Coming off its first loss of the
season, the No. 5 Stanford women's
basketball team received some
recognition Monday when senior
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike was

named Pac-12 Player of the Week.
Ogwumike, a former Pac-10
Player of the Year and the Cardi
nal's best offensive weapon, scored
56 points in a pair of tough road
contests last week. Against peren
nial favorite No. 2 Connecticut last
Monday, Ogwumike struggled with
foul trouble but still managed to
lead the team with 22 points in
Stanford's 68-58 loss.
The Cardinal responded in a big
way by winning at Xavier on Friday,
and once again, it was Ogwumike
leading the charge. The senior dom
inated the Musketeers, scoring 34
of the team's 80 points and hauling
in 13 rebounds to help Stanford
bounce back.
For the year, Ogwumike leads
the team with 25.8 points and 11.3
rebounds per game while shooting
60 percent from the field and 86
percent from the free-throw line.
The two-time Ail-American was
picked as a Preseason All-Ameri
can as well, and along with her sister
Chiney, forms one of the best low
post combinations in the country.
Stanford hosts UC-Davis on
Wednesday at 7 p.m.
