## Community Action Chair resigns 
### KURT CHIRBAS 
ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2
recently took over the position of
Chair of the Community Action
Board (CAB), replacing Aracely
Mondragon 'l3, who stepped down
from the post in mid-October for per
sonal reasons unrelated to her work
on the Board. Cruz said the split was
amicable.
Mondragon declined to comment
on the issue, citing the personal nature
of the resignation.
"While it is a loss, we still have a
strong group of leaders ... who are
working as a whole to make up those
shoes," Cruz said.

The ASSU Executive formed the
Community Action Board during
spring quarter of the last academic
year with the intention of creating a
body that would "foster further cele
bration of the culture of diversity and
identity that already exists [at Stan
ford]," according to Cruz. The Board
features representatives from 23 dif
ferent on-campus communities
and, more informally, members of the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate Advo
cacy Committee.
According to Cruz, the Executive
team thought it would be "a natural
fit" for him to become the Board's
chair since he had worked closely with
Mondragon prior to her resignation.

Cruz noted that the Board was a com
ponent of his campaign platform with
ASSU Vice President Stewart Mac
gregor-Dennis 'l3, and that he re
mains particularly passionate about
the project. Cruz said the Board is one
of the Executive's top priorities for the
year.
The Board took a temporary hiatus
following Mondragon's resignation. It
resumed its work on Monday, Nov. 14
during its normal biweekly meeting.
"I took a little bit of time to regroup
her notes and transition," Cruz said. "I
had been mostly focusing on vision ...
so it took a little bit of time to transi
tion to including the implementation
steps of that as well."
Dane Bratz 'l3, who represents
the interfraternal Greek community
on the Board, agreed.
"We were kind of in flux until
now," Bratz said. "We've kind of got
back started on what we were doing,
and we're going to really approach
the issues more in the winter and
spring quarters."
The Board has recently refined its
goals for the upcoming year, choos
ing to focus its attention on three
main projects, according to Cruz.
These include collaborating with
Tommy Lee Woon, director of diver
sity and first-generation programs,
on a series of race and identity talks;
working with Residential Education
on the development of its new spring
quarter course for Resident Assis
tants (RAs); and holding an all-cam
pus event to celebrate diversity in the
spring, during which the Board plans
to present and publish a student re
port on diversity.

Cruz said the Board has also re
cently engaged in conversations with
the Stanford Department of Public
Safety (DPS), hoping to establish a
forum that would strengthen the re
lationship between the student body

and the police. He said this has be
come the fourth project the Board
hopes to have completed by the end
of the year.
In alignment with its first goal, the
Board has entered into discussions
with Woon and plans to launch a di
versity "ally program" at the begin
ning of winter quarter, Cruz said. The
focus of this project will be exploring
how someone can be an ally to a
community that he or she does not
identify with, according to Cruz. He
gave the example that while he iden
tifies as Filipino, the program may
explore how he could support the
Native American community.
Cruz said the Board has also start
ed to talk with Dean of Residential
Education Deborah Golder and
other ResEd administrators about
the spring RA course, hoping to in
corporate issues about diversity and
identity into its curriculum.
"The campus really sees RAs as a
bastion of Stanford culture," Cruz
said. "RA training has historically
been viewed as away to really make
an effect on Stanford culture in a pos
itive way."
Bratz said many of the Board
members have provided input on
how issues affecting their communi
ty could be represented in the RA
course. For instance, as the represen
tative for the interfraternal commu
nity, Bratz said he might examine
how the course could address resi
dents' interactions with social events

thrown at Greek houses.
The Board is still working on how
the data will be collected for the stu
dent report on diversity, according to
Cruz. He said the report may consist
of a mixture of polls, numerical data,
information about current policies
and the stories of individual commu
nity members. Students prepared a
similar report in the 19905, according
to Cruz.

The report will be presented in
the spring during the Stanford Show
case, an all-campus event being or
ganized by several student groups.
"Because of the leadership transi
tion change, the Board hasn't accom
plished that much thus far," Bratz
said. "I'm really excited though
about getting to work on these initia
tives during the spring and winter
quarters. I think over those two quar
ters, we can really accomplish the
concrete set of goals that we've set
forth, and I think those by them

selves will hopefully make a differ
ence on the campus."
According to Bratz, the Board
can be deemed successful at the end
of the year if it follows through on the
three projects it has planned for it
self. He said he hopes that if the
Board delivers on those projects, it
could become a permanent fixture in
campus life.
"This is a unique thing that hasn't
happened with the ASSU Executive
Board before," Bratz said. "We'd re
ally like to set up a foundation for
having a body like this, so in the fu
ture, it could maybe do even more
ambitious things than what we are
contemplating right now."
Other representatives on the
Board The Daily contacted either
did not respond or declined to com
ment.
