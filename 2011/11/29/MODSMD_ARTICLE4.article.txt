# PA Council halts bike plan
## Proposal aims to grow bike network 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO 
A plan to expand Palo Alto's
pedestrian and bicycle network
remains on hold despite overall
positive reception by the City
Council and community mem
bers. The City Council voted Nov.
7 to send the Bicycle and Pedestri
an Transportation Plan back to
city staff for further revisions. The
last plan addressing bicycle trans
portation in the city was in 2003.
Community members responded
with excitement to the newest ini
tiative when its sponsors released
an initial draft in July.
The City of Palo Alto Bicycle
and Pedestrian Plan would repair
bike paths around the city and cre
ate bike boulevards, new lanes to
clear congestion with pedestrians.
The plan also lays out details for
making intersections, curbs, side
walks and parking spaces more
biker-friendly.
"Palo Alto has invested a lot of
time and effort in biking," said
Palo Alto Councilman Greg
Schmid. "I think our bike usage
both for pleasure trips and for get
ting to work has increased dramat
ically over the last 10 years, and the
bike plan helps set up a network of
pathways."
Schmid said he believes that
the community widely supports
the new bike initiative and is
proud of the collaborative effort it
involved. According to Schmid,re
visions to the Bicycle and Pedes
trian Plan should include a more
comprehensive summary and in
clusion of several small changes
that the City Council brought for
ward in discussion.
"It came to us a few weeks
ago," said Councilwoman Gail
Price. "We felt that there needed
to be a little more discussion of
some of the more innovative rec
ommendations, recognizing that
[for] some of the proposals there
needs to be ... precautionary lan
guage or some caveats that indi
cate ... additional work is needed
on some of these areas."

As Price understands it, she
said, the Bicycle and Pedestrian
Plan needs "slight refinements
and enhancements." The fine-tun
ing required is mainly a result of
concerns raised at the public hear
ing on Nov. 7.
"The big obstacle is making
sure that we have funding that can
pay for some of our more ambi
tious activities," Schrnid said. "Part
of the funding has to come from

our own sources, but we also want
to make sure that we're well
placed to go for... regional, state
and national funding alterna
tives."
Schmid noted that Stanford
has made significant effort in pro
viding alternatives to driving. Palo
Alto will face the challenge of in
tegrating its changes with the bike
paths on Stanford's campus, but
Schmid said he looks forward to
the collaborative effort.
"The other part of an ambi
tious plan like this is the question
of being able to secure resources
and funding in order to implement
all of the items in this plan," Price
said. She added that the developer
agreement of the Stanford Hospi
tal expansion may be a possible
source for some funds for the ini
tiative.
The Bicycle and Pedestrian
Plan would prove financially tax
ing to the city, calling for $642,720
per typical mile of Class 1 Shared
Use Path, $42,600 per mile of
Class 2 Bike Lanes and $115,100
per mile of Enhanced Bike Lanes,
among other expenditures.
The report for the Bicycle and
Pedestrian Plan assesses each
facet of its proposal against the
2003 plan's criteria of "safety, con
nectivity and special circum
stances," as well as the "five I's
evaluation framework" of "inte
gration, inclusion, innovation, in
vestment and institutional part
nerships." If the plan passes after
revisions, the city will make grad
ual changes based on which initia
tives are understood to be the
most necessary based on these cri
teria.
"I would hope that the com
munity would be supportive of
our effort as a city to find funding
for some of these recommenda
tions," Price said. "And also in an
ideal situation it would be nice to
