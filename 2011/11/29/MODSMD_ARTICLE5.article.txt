## Strikes project adopts new goal Ballot initiative aims to 'restore law's intent' 
### NEEL THAKKAR 
Faculty and students involved with
Stanford Law School's Three Strikes
Project have drafted a ballot initiative
that would revise California's contro
versial Three Strikes Law. Pending ap
proval by the Office of the State At
torney General and the collection of
500,000 signatures, the proposal
would appear on the state ballot in
2012.
Under the 17-year-old law, persons
convicted of felonies can be sentenced
to up to 25 years of life in prison if they
have been previously convicted of
two serious or violent felonies.
According to Michael Romano,
the director of the Three Strikes Pro

life imprisonment for relatively small
crimes, such as drug possession or
petty theft.

"That is not away to run a state or
a criminal justice policy," Romano
said. "A life sentence for petty theft or
drug possession is excessive."
Though the Three Strikes Project's
usual work is to argue on behalf of
clients given third strikes for non-seri
ous, non-violent crimes, it began work
on the ballot initiative about a year
ago after being approached by the
NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
The initiative would restrict appli
cation of the third strike to serious or
violent felonies only, which Romano
said is meant to restore the law to its
original intent.
If the initiative passes, over 3,000 of
the roughly 8,800 inmates currently
jailed for third-strike offenses could
go back to court for a new sentence,
according to Malaina Freedman, a law
student who works with Romano.
California's Three Strikes Law was
passed in 1994, partly in reaction to a
string of gruesome murders commit
