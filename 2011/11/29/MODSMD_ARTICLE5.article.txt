## Strikes project adopts new goal Ballot initiative aims to 'restore law's intent' 
### NEEL THAKKAR 
Faculty and students involved with
Stanford Law School's Three Strikes
Project have drafted a ballot initiative
that would revise California's contro
versial Three Strikes Law. Pending ap
proval by the Office of the State At
torney General and the collection of
500,000 signatures, the proposal
would appear on the state ballot in
2012.
Under the 17-year-old law, persons
convicted of felonies can be sentenced
to up to 25 years of life in prison if they
have been previously convicted of
two serious or violent felonies.
According to Michael Romano,
the director of the Three Strikes Pro
ject, the law has sentenced people to
life imprisonment for relatively small
crimes, such as drug possession or
petty theft.

"That is not away to run a state or
a criminal justice policy," Romano
said. "A life sentence for petty theft or
drug possession is excessive."
Though the Three Strikes Project's
usual work is to argue on behalf of
clients given third strikes for non-seri
ous, non-violent crimes, it began work
on the ballot initiative about a year
ago after being approached by the
NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
The initiative would restrict appli
cation of the third strike to serious or
violent felonies only, which Romano
said is meant to restore the law to its
original intent.
If the initiative passes, over 3,000 of
the roughly 8,800 inmates currently
jailed for third-strike offenses could
go back to court for a new sentence,
according to Malaina Freedman, a law
student who works with Romano.
California's Three Strikes Law was
passed in 1994, partly in reaction to a
string of gruesome murders commit
ted by ex-felons. California is one of 24
states with similar laws, but is "widely
regarded as the harshest non-capital
sentencing law" in the nation, accord
ing to Romano.
Still, the original law retains some
staunch supporters. Mike Reynolds
helped draft it after his daughter Kim
ber was murdered in 1992.
According to Reynolds, the state
saw a 37 percent drop in crime in the
first four years after the law was im
plemented. He said he also believes
the law has helped contribute to a 40-
year low in crime rates.
"While all states have seen drops,"
Reynolds said, "none have as much as
in California."
Although the proposed revision
would not affect third-strikers jailed
for serious or violent crimes,
Reynolds said he believes letting any
"career criminals" out of jail would be
disastrous.
"If criminals are on the street, es
pecially repeat offenders, what are
they going to be doing?" he asked.
The debate over the Three Strikes
Law is part of a larger debate over the
future of California's prison system.
Last May, the Supreme Court
ruled in a 5-4 decision that the state's
prisons were overcrowded enough to
constitute cruel and unusual punish
ment. At one point, the prison popu
lation was at 156,000 almost dou
ble the system's capacity.
As a result, California has begun a
complicated process called realign
ment, in which it will move tens of
thousands of prisoners deemed low
risk to county jails. Inmates will also
be given the opportunity to serve only
half their sentence if they behave
well, as opposed to the former two
thirds requirement.
Reynolds said he believes the
combination of the realignment pro
gram and a reformed Three Strikes
Law would be "overload," and hard
for the public to swallow.

Flowever, Romano noted that a
study by the California Department
of Corrections found that third-strik
ers jailed for non-serious, non-violent
crimes were the least dangerous in

mates. Giving them away out of jail
would leave more room for higher
risk inmates, Romano said.
There have been past efforts at re
forming the law, the most notable of
which came in 2004.

That attempt, Proposition 66, was
much more ambitious altering the
second and third strike and redefining
burglary and received no support
from prominent law enforcement of
ficers or elected officials. The measure
failed by a substantial margin.
Calling the 2004 effort "not well
conceived" Romano said the Stan
ford team's approach is much sim
pler.
He said he expects significant sup
port from law enforcement and elect
ed officials in the coming months, al
though there have not been any such
announcements so far.
An independent poll conducted in
June found that 74 percent of regis
tered voters also agree with altering
the Three Strikes Law.
But such support is tenuous. The
2004 proposition also enjoyed sup
port from a healthy majority of voters
until the last month of campaigning,
when it sank under attacks from dis
trict attorneys and elected officials.
Reynolds said he believes the vote
will essentially be a referendum on
the success of the Three Strikes Law.
"Laws come and laws go," he said.
"The question is which ones work and
which ones don't."
