## Lofgren discusses immigration, DREAM Act 
### EDWARD NGAI 
U.S. Congresswoman Zoe Lof
gren '7O kicked off "American
Dream Week" with a speech Mon
day evening, calling the current
American immigration system "un
believably unfair" and criticizing
both Republican legislators and the
Obama administration.
As part of a weeklong series of
events sponsored by several stu
dents groups, Rep. Lofgren, D-Calif.,
the ranking Democrat on the House
Subcommittee on Immigration, dis
cussed what she described as the
shortcomings of American immigra
tion policy, expressed dim hopes for
bipartisan compromise on immigra
tion legislation before the 2012 elec
tion and shared harsh words for her
Republican colleagues in Congress
who have opposed Democrat-led ef
forts at such legislation.
The event, entitled "The Califor
nia DREAM Act Passed, Now
What?" centered on the prospects
for a federal version of the DREAM
Act, a bill that would provide condi
tional permanent residency to cer
tain illegal immigrants who came to
the United States as minors. Incarna
tions of the bill have been debated in
Congress for a decade, with the most
recent rejected by the Senate in Dec.
2010 after passing the House.
"[Passing the DREAM Act in the

House] was one of the most mean
ingful moments I've had," Lofgren
said. "Our galleries were filled with
[students who would have benefited
from the DREAM Act], and it was
really thrilling to see ... these young
people explode into applause."
Expressing "tremendous disap
pointment" that the Senate was un
able to reach the 60-vote threshold
to advance the bill, Lofgren added
that the DREAM Act's future is
bleak in the current Congress.
"If [the act] was a problem then,
it's even worse today with Republi
cans in charge of the House," she
said. "There is not a chance that I see
that the DREAM Act will be taken
up."
According to Lofgren, this dark
ens even the smallest glimmers of
hope for comprehensive immigra
tion reform in the near future.
"If we can't get the DREAM Act
through, the prospects for compre
hensive reform ... in this Congress
is very, very slim," she said.
Lofgren said she blames a lack of
bipartisanship for inaction on illegal
immigration.
"Originally the DREAM Act
was a bipartisan bill. It was Chris
Cannon, a Republican from Utah,
and Howard Berman, Democrat of
southern California, who put [the
bill] together with very even, biparti
san sponsorship [in 2003]," she said.

"That was probably the last time we
saw any bipartisanship on [immigra
tion.]"

In particular, Lofgren had harsh
words for legislators who have so far
rejected attempts to change the sta
tus quo on illegal immigration, de
spite neither party's satisfaction with
today's policies.
"Sometimes my colleagues say
they're not against immigration, just
against illegal immigration," she
said. "But if you look at many of the
individuals who say that, in fact they
work very hard to make it almost im
possible to legally immigrate to the
United States. It's not a line that I
buy."
Lofgren also criticized President
Barack Obama's handling of illegal
immigrants.
"I support President Obama's re
election, but I think stepping on the
gas pedal [enforcing] a system that
almost everybody acknowledges is
broken is ... not the smartest," she
said. "[This administration] has de
ported over a million people so far,
actually [exceeding] the deporta
tions of the two terms of the Bush
administration."
Lofgren maintained that there
are opportunities for progress on the
topic of immigration, which has been
emotional and controversial on both
sides of the aisle.
"In the [last sitting of] Congress,

myself and a couple other Democra
tic members decided that we should
have secret meetings with Republi
cans on immigration," she said. "And
we had ... over 100 hours of meet
ings, and after over a year we drafted
a bill and watermarked it so nobody
could leak it."
But the same political factors that
stopped the progress of that bill still
exist today, Lofgren said.
"Right now [Republicans] are
afraid of primary fights," she said.
Lofgren encouraged audience
members to assess their own partici
pation in the debate concerning im
migration.
"I have a role in that, but all of
you do as well," she said.
Ireri Hernandez 'l5, an organizer
of the event, said she agrees.
"I feel that informing people is
the first step to getting anything
done," Hernandez said. "This week is
about informing people in getting
them to ask questions. It may not be
really relevant to them [personally],
but it is relevant to their country."
"The hope isn't lost," Rafael
Vazquez 'l2, ASSU Senate Chair
and an organizer of American
Dream Week added. "[We] do now
have tangible steps ... to see some
thing like the DREAM Act passed."

recent rejected by the Senate in Dec.
2010 after passing the House.
"[Passing the DREAM Act in the

House] was one of the most mean
ingful moments I've had," Lofgren
said. "Our galleries were filled with
[students who would have benefited
from the DREAM Act], and it was
really thrilling to see ... these young
people explode into applause."
Expressing "tremendous disap
pointment" that the Senate was un
able to reach the 60-vote threshold
to advance the bill, Lofgren added
that the DREAM Act's future is
bleak in the current Congress.
"If [the act] was a problem then,
it's even worse today with Republi
cans in charge of the House," she
said. "There is not a chance that I see
that the DREAM Act will be taken
up."
According to Lofgren, this dark
ens even the smallest glimmers of
hope for comprehensive immigra
tion reform in the near future.
"If we can't get the DREAM Act
through, the prospects for compre
hensive reform ... in this Congress
is very, very slim," she said.
Lofgren said she blames a lack of
bipartisanship for inaction on illegal
immigration.
"Originally the DREAM Act
was a bipartisan bill. It was Chris
Cannon, a Republican from Utah,
and Howard Berman, Democrat of
southern California, who put [the
bill] together with very even, biparti
san sponsorship [in 2003]," she said.

"That was probably the last time we
saw any bipartisanship on [immigra
tion.]"

In particular, Lofgren had harsh
words for legislators who have so far
rejected attempts to change the sta
tus quo on illegal immigration, de
spite neither party's satisfaction with
today's policies.
"Sometimes my colleagues say
they're not against immigration, just
against illegal immigration," she
said. "But if you look at many of the
individuals who say that, in fact they
work very hard to make it almost im
possible to legally immigrate to the
United States. It's not a line that I
buy."
Lofgren also criticized President
Barack Obama's handling of illegal
immigrants.
"I support President Obama's re
election, but I think stepping on the
gas pedal [enforcing] a system that
almost everybody acknowledges is
broken is ... not the smartest," she
said. "[This administration] has de
ported over a million people so far,
actually [exceeding] the deporta
tions of the two terms of the Bush
administration."
Lofgren maintained that there
are opportunities for progress on the
topic of immigration, which has been
emotional and controversial on both
sides of the aisle.
"In the [last sitting of] Congress,

myself and a couple other Democra
tic members decided that we should
have secret meetings with Republi
cans on immigration," she said. "And
we had ... over 100 hours of meet
ings, and after over a year we drafted
a bill and watermarked it so nobody
could leak it."
But the same political factors that
stopped the progress of that bill still
exist today, Lofgren said.
"Right now [Republicans] are
afraid of primary fights," she said.
Lofgren encouraged audience
members to assess their own partici
pation in the debate concerning im
migration.
"I have a role in that, but all of
you do as well," she said.
Ireri Hernandez 'l5, an organizer
of the event, said she agrees.
"I feel that informing people is
the first step to getting anything
done," Hernandez said. "This week is
about informing people in getting
them to ask questions. It may not be
really relevant to them [personally],
but it is relevant to their country."
"The hope isn't lost," Rafael
Vazquez 'l2, ASSU Senate Chair
and an organizer of American
Dream Week added. "[We] do now
have tangible steps ... to see some
thing like the DREAM Act passed."
