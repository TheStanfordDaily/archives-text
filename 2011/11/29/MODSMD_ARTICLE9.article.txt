## Researchers use cell transformation to understand autism 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellora Israni 
A team of Stanford researchers
was recently able to transform skin
cells from individuals with a rare
autism-linked condition known as
Timothy syndrome into full-fledged
brain cells, presenting another look at
potential genetic precursors of autism.
Timothy syndrome is exceedingly
rare an estimated 20 people
around the world have it but be
cause it is controlled by a single gene
defect, it may aid scientists in identify
ing the developmental abnormalities
in children with autism. Individuals
with Timothy syndrome display simi
lar developmental and communica
tion problems to those with autism.
The Stanford team, led by post
doctoral research fellow in neurobi
ology Sergiu Pasca and associate pro
fessor of neurobiology Ricardo Dol
metsch, published its findings online
in Nature Medicine.
Compared with skin cell samples
taken from healthy patients, those
taken from Timothy syndrome pa
tients grew into a different propor
tion of brain cell subtypes, lacking
cells active in the corpus callosum, a
part of the brain that facilitates com
munication between the two hemi
spheres. The cells also produced too
much of a chemical that makes the
neurotransmitters dopamine and
norepinephrine, which aid in sensory
processing and social behavior.
The findings substantiate those of
other studies that have claimed that
autism stems from poor communica
tion between parts of the brain. How
ever, the National Autism Society and
researchers themselves cautioned
against generalizing the findings to all
forms of autism, as Timothy syndrome
only covers a subset of patients.
