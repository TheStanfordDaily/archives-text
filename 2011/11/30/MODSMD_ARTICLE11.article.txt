## Finding Flash Mob 
### â€“ Sierra Freeman 
If you find yourself suddenly
surrounded by a group of pil
low-fighting students in a
public place, don't be alarmed
- it may just be Stanford
Flash Mob.
Nora Lindstrom 'l2 created the
group in 2009 as away to coordinate
impulsive and outrageous stunts
with a large group of people. Thirty
to 40 students joined the first event,
lured by the chance to do something
spontaneous and completely bewil

The first event the group coordi
nated was a "freeze," in which
everyone stands still at a predeter
mined time and location. The effect
of dozens of stationary students in
the midst of tourists, other students
and faculty was "pretty cool," Lind
strom said.
Two years after its launch, the
group is now on rockier footing.
Lindstrom passed Flash Mob to new
leadership after the first year, hop

but only one event was held a
large pillow fight organized by Theo
Gibbs B.A. 'll M.S. 'l2 and Noemi

make the pillow fight an annual tra

"I think it's possible for Flash-
Mob to become popular on cam
pus, but the group will need lots of
marketing and publicity to get a
large number of members," Lind
strom said.
Despite the complications in
getting large groups of students to

mistic about a revival next year.
"I think flash mobs are awe
some, and it would be great if some
one started a new group," she said.
