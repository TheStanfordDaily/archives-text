## The
						Saxophone Mans second calling Peter Lindener pushes a preferential voting system

Peter Lindener is not like most people at Stanford.
He is in his early 50s, has no formal college educa
tion, no faculty position and is perhaps best
known around campus for playing his saxophone
in White Plaza on sunny afternoons.
When asked about Lindener, faculty members The
Daily interviewed for this article gave brief answers or de
clined to comment. There is something more to Lindener
than his saxophone suggests.
Beyond music, Lindener is passionate about revolution
izing democratic systems. Though hesitant to admit it he
insists the type of math behind his ideas is meant to opti
mize the choices for ice-cream flavors and pizza toppings at
parties Lindener says that his research seeks to provide
away to revolutionize the architecture of democracy.
While the ideas behind his claim haven't gained much
traction, they have been published.
Lindener and Joey Durham, a graduate student at UC-
Santa Barbara who met Lindener when Durham was a sen
ior at Palo Alto High School, published a paper in the pro
preferential-voting-system journal Voting Matters. It's
viewable online, and Lindener always has a few copies on
hand.
The paper, titled "Moderated Differential Pairwise Tal
lying: A Voter Specified Hybrid of Ranking by Pairwise
Comparisons and Cardinal Utility Sums," seeks to address
Condorcet's paradox which states that voters' collective
preferences can be cyclic even if individuals' are not and
solve some fundamental problems associated with voting in
its current form.
Their research could be relevant to situations like the
2000 Presidential election, when votes for Ralph Nader in
Florida were, in practical terms, votes for President George
W. Bush. The ultimate policy preferences of voters who
chose Nader but would have preferred A1 Gore to be elect
ed before Bush bore less weight in a system where voters
can only up-vote a single candidate. Alternatively, some
voters did not choose their preferred candidate (Nader) be
cause they felt that a vote for him would have been "wast
ed."
Lindener and Durham sought to eliminate this idea of a
"wasted" vote and design a form of ranked-voting democ
racy.
The "wasted vote" problem is generally studied in a very
