## The 						Saxophone Mans second calling Peter Lindener pushes a preferential voting system 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
Peter Lindener is not like most people at Stanford.
He is in his early 50s, has no formal college educa
tion, no faculty position and is perhaps best
known around campus for playing his saxophone
in White Plaza on sunny afternoons.
When asked about Lindener, faculty members The
Daily interviewed for this article gave brief answers or de
clined to comment. There is something more to Lindener
than his saxophone suggests.
Beyond music, Lindener is passionate about revolution
izing democratic systems. Though hesitant to admit it he
insists the type of math behind his ideas is meant to opti
mize the choices for ice-cream flavors and pizza toppings at
parties Lindener says that his research seeks to provide
away to revolutionize the architecture of democracy.
While the ideas behind his claim haven't gained much
traction, they have been published.
Lindener and Joey Durham, a graduate student at UC-
Santa Barbara who met Lindener when Durham was a sen
ior at Palo Alto High School, published a paper in the pro
preferential-voting-system journal Voting Matters. It's
viewable online, and Lindener always has a few copies on
hand.
The paper, titled "Moderated Differential Pairwise Tal
lying: A Voter Specified Hybrid of Ranking by Pairwise
Comparisons and Cardinal Utility Sums," seeks to address
Condorcet's paradox which states that voters' collective
preferences can be cyclic even if individuals' are not and
solve some fundamental problems associated with voting in
its current form.
Their research could be relevant to situations like the
2000 Presidential election, when votes for Ralph Nader in
Florida were, in practical terms, votes for President George
W. Bush. The ultimate policy preferences of voters who
chose Nader but would have preferred A1 Gore to be elect
ed before Bush bore less weight in a system where voters
can only up-vote a single candidate. Alternatively, some
voters did not choose their preferred candidate (Nader) be
cause they felt that a vote for him would have been "wast
ed."
Lindener and Durham sought to eliminate this idea of a
"wasted" vote and design a form of ranked-voting democ
racy.
The "wasted vote" problem is generally studied in a very

small subfield of economics called
social choice theory, which was de
veloped largely by Kenneth Arrow,
a Stanford professor emeritus of
economics and 1972 Nobel Prize
laureate.
In an email to The Daily, Arrow
wrote that he had never heard of
Lindener or his paper. He initially
agreed to read and comment on
Lindener and Durham's paper, but
did not respond to subsequent re
quests for comment.
Lindener has contacted other
professors at Stanford with the
hope of getting his work reviewed
and to see that a class is taught at
Stanford about social choice theory.
Mechanical engineering profes
sor David Beach was one of these
professors. After Beach confirmed
that he had met Lindener and re
ceived his paper, he added, "I think
that's already more than I should
say, I'm going to decline to com
ment further."
Lindener also contacted Todd
Davies, associate director of the
symbolic systems program. He too
confirmed that he had spoken with
Lindener via email and received his
paper, but had not yet had a chance
to look over it thoroughly because
of his research load.
No professor contacted for this
article nor, according to Lindener,
any professor Lindener has given a
copy of the paper to has refuted or
challenged his ideas. Lindener said
faculty members who received his
paper would most often declined to
take calls or respond to emails from
him.
Even though faculty members keep
their distance, the University does
not disenchant Lindener.
"There's no place like Stanford
in the world," he said. Lindener
added that it can get tiresome to be

ignored, but "on the flipside, they let
me play my horn here."
Faculty members aren't Linden
er's only target audience.
"I don't need to effect governmen
tal change," Lindener said. "I need
to let the leaders of tomorrow know
what's possible."
On that front, Lindener appears
to have slightly more success. Rafael
Cosman 'l5 first met Lindener at
Stanford a few weeks ago.
"I was walking through White
Plaza and I see this weird guy with a
huge bushy white beard playing a
saxophone," Cosman said. "He tells
me who he is. I tell him who I am,
and pretty soon, he tells me about
his interest in voting theory."
Cosman was a bit overwhelmed
at first by the paper, which he said
was a "hefty read," but soon became
excited.
"I don't think Peter [Lindener]
would ever say that, but it's a pretty
awesome voting system, way better
than anyone has ever implemented
before," he said.
It is difficult to assess the signifi
cance of Lindener's work since so
few academics will discuss it.
But regardless, Lindener is
happy to be on the Farm. He spoke
passionately about his work, but his
face lit up when he discussed the
"youngsters": students who come
up and talk to him, and, he hopes,
perhaps one day will take his re
search one step further.
"I'm thankful [Stanford] is intel
lectual enough that this can go for
ward, and I'm trying to hold my
own," Lindener said.
In Lindener's words, his work is
about producing a "more prosper
ous world." Whether or not anyone
agrees with his math, Lindener has
spent the past seven years of life
working to develop a system that he
believes may politically empower
the most people in the most effec
tive way.

to have slightly more success. Rafael
Cosman 'l5 first met Lindener at
Stanford a few weeks ago.
"I was walking through White
Plaza and I see this weird guy with a
huge bushy white beard playing a
saxophone," Cosman said. "He tells
me who he is. I tell him who I am,
and pretty soon, he tells me about
his interest in voting theory."
Cosman was a bit overwhelmed
at first by the paper, which he said
was a "hefty read," but soon became
excited.
"I don't think Peter [Lindener]
would ever say that, but it's a pretty
awesome voting system, way better
than anyone has ever implemented
before," he said.

few academics will discuss it.
But regardless, Lindener is
happy to be on the Farm. He spoke
passionately about his work, but his
face lit up when he discussed the
"youngsters": students who come
up and talk to him, and, he hopes,
perhaps one day will take his re
search one step further.
"I'm thankful [Stanford] is intel
lectual enough that this can go for
ward, and I'm trying to hold my
own," Lindener said.
In Lindener's words, his work is
about producing a "more prosper

agrees with his math, Lindener has
spent the past seven years of life
working to develop a system that he
believes may politically empower
the most people in the most effec
tive way.

Peter Lindener is not like most people at Stanford.
He is in his early 50s, has no formal college educa
tion, no faculty position and is perhaps best
known around campus for playing his saxophone
in White Plaza on sunny afternoons.
When asked about Lindener, faculty members The
Daily interviewed for this article gave brief answers or de
clined to comment. There is something more to Lindener
than his saxophone suggests.
Beyond music, Lindener is passionate about revolution
izing democratic systems. Though hesitant to admit it he
insists the type of math behind his ideas is meant to opti
mize the choices for ice-cream flavors and pizza toppings at
parties Lindener says that his research seeks to provide
away to revolutionize the architecture of democracy.
While the ideas behind his claim haven't gained much
traction, they have been published.
Lindener and Joey Durham, a graduate student at UC-
Santa Barbara who met Lindener when Durham was a sen
ior at Palo Alto High School, published a paper in the pro
preferential-voting-system journal Voting Matters. It's
viewable online, and Lindener always has a few copies on
hand.
The paper, titled "Moderated Differential Pairwise Tal
lying: A Voter Specified Hybrid of Ranking by Pairwise
Comparisons and Cardinal Utility Sums," seeks to address
Condorcet's paradox which states that voters' collective
preferences can be cyclic even if individuals' are not and
solve some fundamental problems associated with voting in
its current form.
Their research could be relevant to situations like the
2000 Presidential election, when votes for Ralph Nader in
Florida were, in practical terms, votes for President George
W. Bush. The ultimate policy preferences of voters who
chose Nader but would have preferred A1 Gore to be elect
ed before Bush bore less weight in a system where voters
can only up-vote a single candidate. Alternatively, some
voters did not choose their preferred candidate (Nader) be
cause they felt that a vote for him would have been "wast
ed."
Lindener and Durham sought to eliminate this idea of a
"wasted" vote and design a form of ranked-voting democ
racy.
The "wasted vote" problem is generally studied in a very

small subfield of economics called
social choice theory, which was de
veloped largely by Kenneth Arrow,
a Stanford professor emeritus of
economics and 1972 Nobel Prize
laureate.
In an email to The Daily, Arrow
wrote that he had never heard of
Lindener or his paper. He initially
agreed to read and comment on
Lindener and Durham's paper, but
did not respond to subsequent re
quests for comment.
Lindener has contacted other
professors at Stanford with the
hope of getting his work reviewed
and to see that a class is taught at
Stanford about social choice theory.
Mechanical engineering profes
sor David Beach was one of these
professors. After Beach confirmed
that he had met Lindener and re
ceived his paper, he added, "I think
that's already more than I should
say, I'm going to decline to com
ment further."
Lindener also contacted Todd
Davies, associate director of the
symbolic systems program. He too
confirmed that he had spoken with
Lindener via email and received his
paper, but had not yet had a chance
to look over it thoroughly because
of his research load.
No professor contacted for this
article nor, according to Lindener,
any professor Lindener has given a
copy of the paper to has refuted or
challenged his ideas. Lindener said
faculty members who received his
paper would most often declined to
take calls or respond to emails from
him.
