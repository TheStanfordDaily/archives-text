## EDITORIAL Do not occupy Meyer 
### 
On Monday morning, an
email to be forwarded
"freely and hugely" made
its way across Stanford email lists.
The message presents another
summons to occupy University
space, again in the spirit of the
worldwide Occupy movement.The
email assures students that, while
you may be busy, this gathering will
engage you in a spirit of action and
protest. Perhaps to encourage stu
dents who may be otherwise occu
pied with their studies, the alleged
ly permanent, 24/7 gathering is to
be held in Meyer Library.
Stanford has two major libraries
at its students' service: Green and
Meyer. While Green arguably
boasts more available space for
studying, it also requires students
to swipe their SUID cards upon en
trance and prepare bags for inspec
tion upon exit. Meyer, free of these
constraints, lends itself better to
students coming and going,
whether they are printing a last
minute paper or even cutting
through the building, which sits
squarely on top of a four-way inter
section. However, plenty of stu
dents also use Meyer as their go-to
library for long bouts of studying.
And these students are not likely to
appreciate an Occupy gathering in
their study space.
It is unclear precisely what this
new occupation will entail, and
even the italicized keywords in the
email remain vague. Is this a
protest? A sit-in? No, it is a "pres
ence." Students are encouraged to
study in solidarity, to make signs or
to have a conversation about the
events of our changing world.

While a "presence" might be less
disruptive than other potential
types of demonstration, distrac
tions of any kind in a library setting
are generally frowned upon.
Why Meyer Library? Meyer is a
study space, and with that in mind
the timing of the Occupy gathering
is woefully inopportune. Stanford
students are fast approaching the
end of the quarter and a week of
final exams. Many students will be
taking their first ever series of final
exams at Stanford. At this time of
academic stress, students increas
ingly rely upon libraries to be
places of refuge from other distrac
tions, from constant study breaks
and social contact, or as environ
ments in which a study-focused at
mosphere can facilitate concentra
tion upon their notes and text
books.

Perhaps the Occupy gathering
was scheduled to take place in
Meyer precisely because it is likely
to be a hub of student activity in the
coming two weeks. Perhaps Occu
py would like to increase its popu
larity on the Stanford campus, for it
certainly has not been able to do so
as yet. It would be more than fair to
acknowledge that Stanford stu
dents have not enthusiastically em
braced participation in a large Oc
cupy Stanford movement. The
email gives students the benefit of
the doubt, suggesting, "You're busy.
You're at Stanford," even while in
sinuating that it is merely home
work, class and extracurricular ac
tivities that have kept students
from Occupy Stanford activities.

Few can argue against the possi
bilities of dialogue, open-minded
ness and learning. As an elite institu
tion, Stanford stands for the very
principles in which these activities
are rooted. But there are times and
places for dialogue that are more ap
propriate than others, and this time,
Occupy has shown its disrespect for

students' study habits by choosing to
hold its open forum in a common
space utilized specifically for aca
demic purposes. Rather, we hope
that students will utilize the plethora
of other forums for dialogue that
currently take place on this campus,
such as the ongoing series of "Occu
py the Future" lectures by faculty
members, sponsored by the Haas
Center for Public Service. Dialogue
can happen in the classroom, in the
lecture hall, in any number of meet
ings; please leave the library to the
students in the next two weeks.
