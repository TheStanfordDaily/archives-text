# JOBBERISH
## Forever young 
### Amanda Ach 
I had a great Thanksgiving break.
I spent most of my time baking
macaroons, watching TV, play
ing board games and doing jigsaw
puzzles (I'm really cool). For a
whole week, I just did what I want
ed, when I wanted to do it and did
n't think about all the work and
other stress in my life. I had fun. At
Stanford, we don't get a lot of time
to do that. Those who know me will
tell you I make time for TV, but puz
zles and board games? They kind of
fall by the wayside. In college, our
version of fun becomes beer pong
and frat parties, but what I miss is
the fun we enjoyed as children,
where we could play games and
dress up in funny costumes basi
cally, we could lose ourselves in the
imaginary.
At Stanford, we are so grounded
in reality that sometimes we forget
about good old-fashioned fun. And
with this whole job-searching thing,
I feel like there's less fun in my life
than ever before. Now I don't know
about you, but I'm not ready to be a
timecard-punching, tax-lamenting

adult. Much like my friend Peter
Pan, I won't grow up, so I started
looking for jobs that would let me
have fun and keep in touch with my
inner child. What I found is the job
of play consultant, and it's this
week's topic.
A play consultant isn't where
you dress up in your dad's work
suits and pretend to be a consultant
you actually consult on playing.
Essentially, companies will hire you
to help them use games, play-acting
and other fun activities to improve
group dynamics and motivation.
The fun activities you organize also
lift morale and make the workplace
less miserable. And as anyone who

has worked in an office will tell you,
it can be pretty dull. As a play con
sultant, you will not only get to
enjoy getting paid to play you
will also get the incredibly reward
ing experience of bringing a little
bit of fun to someone else's day-to
day life.
Play consulting is done exclu
sively through freelancing, so you
will have to be flexible about your
lifestyle and travel schedule. This
also means compensation varies
widely, depending on who you're
working with and how much work
you're doing. This lifestyle isn't for
everyone I'm far too neurotic to
handle that type of instability
but for those of you who are more
adventurous and easy-going, you
might really enjoy it.
While there aren't many educa
tional requirements for pursuing a
career in this field, it takes a specif
ic type of person to be a successful
play consultant. Organizing these
games requires a lot of energy and
people skills; you will most likely be
working with unwilling partici
pants, and it's your job to get them
interested. A lot of the activities will

involve improvisation, such as play
acting and well, improv, so a back
ground in this would be helpful.
Lastly, you have to be good at hav
ing fun. I know that sounds silly, but
one of the most important aspects
of your job will be boosting morale
and team spirit, and if you aren't
having fun, there's no way those
corporate folks will.
Unfortunately, there is one
major difficulty you will face should
you choose to become a play con
sultant. Because the field is made
up entirely of freelancers, it's much
harder to get an internship or go
work for a company to learn about
the biz you will most likely have
to start your own company, and
that's not an easy thing to do. My
recommendation would be to start
with a job in a related field, such as
teaching or being a camp coun
selor, to build up a skill set and rep
utation that will allow you to even
tually make it on your own.
Play consulting may not be the
most serious job in the world, but it
just might be the most fun. And
more importantly, you'll be doing
what you love and making money
doing it, and what could be better
than that?
