# ON THE MARGINS, BETWEEN THE LINES
## Don't define my career for me 
### Jamie Solomon 
Although I love Thanksgiving
and getting to see my family,
one of my least favorite parts
is the "relative questions." You know
the ones, the repetitive small-talk
questions that everyone asks when
they don't really know what to ask
about your life. When you're 16, the
only thing anyone can think to ask
you is if you've gotten your license
yet. The year after that, everyone
wants to give you advice on where to
go to college. Now that I'm about to
graduate, I constantly get asked what
I'm planning on doing next. I gener
ally don't have a problem with this
question because it's important, and
knowing what I want to do with my
time tells you a lot about me.
What annoys me, however, is
when people ask, "So what are you
going to do with a Sociology de
gree?" Within the phrasing and into
nation of this question are often a

number of subtle assumptions and
judgments. The first is the implica
tion that I've chosen a useless degree
because it doesn't give me a clear
path or job field to enter after col
lege. The second is the assumption
that my undergraduate degree de
termines my next steps; that because
I am getting a B. A. in Sociology, I will
pursue work in this field. The ulti
mate frustration I have with this
question, one that often comes out
during the course of the conversa
tion, is the need for the person asking
me the question to fit my answer and

future plans into a discrete career
label such as teacher, lawyer or lob
byist. In reality, none of these is true.
My degree is not useless. Nor am I re
quired to pursue things related to so
ciology. In fact, my job will probably
not have any sort of neat label at all.
I find these issues crop up when
talking to Stanford students as well,
and I often feel looked down upon for
not having chosen a more pre-profes
sional path. I've had numerous con
versations with techie students in
which it is clear that they look down
upon fuzzy majors. The culture
among Stanford students lauds techie
degrees as practical, which ends up
framing fuzzy majors as useless. Al
though it is true that a Stanford engi
neering degree offers higher salaries
and a guaranteed job right out of
Stanford, a liberal arts degree is not a
death knell. Liberal arts degrees have
tremendous value even though they
don't shepherd the student into an
obvious career trajectory and throw
money at them.
My degree opens up a world of
possibilities to me. Although the
skills I've gained are less quantifi
able than those from techie majors,
my time at Stanford has vastly im
proved my writing, my critical think
ing skills, my research skills and my
ability to put together a coherent
and convincing argument. All of
these are qualities that employers
look for and make me a valuable
commodity on the job market.
Every company that employs those
high-paid CS majors also needs peo
ple to do marketing, HR, manage
ment and public relations. Any and
all of these options are available to

me with my liberal arts degree from
Stanford.
People forget that many Ameri
cans have jobs have little to nothing
to do with their undergraduate de
partment, so it's of little concern to
me that my job be related to sociol
ogy. Some of my relatives get this
and some don't, but as our conversa
tions continue they struggle to find a
job label for the future me; do I want
to be a consultant? A social worker?
I should be a teacher! It's like
they're grasping at straws for a name
that they know and understand, fail
ing to realize that jobs don't always
fall into these labels. Like most
adults, I will probably have a job that
has a title that you've never heard of
and that doesn't fall cleanly into any
category. What's important to me is
that I find a job that accomplishes
something that I believe is a valu
able use of my time; the end goal is
what's important, not the name.
I haven't applied to jobs yet, so
we'll see if I'm right or just overly
idealistic. But for now I refuse to be
lieve that my degree and course
work are less worthwhile than
someone whose future trajectory is
obvious. I plan on forging my own
path ahead and finding jobs where I
like the environment and the work
and that meet my long-term goals.
So next time you feel despair be
cause you don't know exactly where
you're going out of college and
there's no obvious plan laid out for
you don't. I'm there with you. We
will fashion careers that work for us
while doing what we want to do, in
stead of trying to cram ourselves
into a label that doesn't quite fit. No
matter what our relatives tell us.

Do you have any career advice for
Jamie? (But no neat little labels,
please!) Then email her at jamiesol
