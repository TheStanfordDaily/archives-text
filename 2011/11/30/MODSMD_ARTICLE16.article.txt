# STUDENTS REFLECT ON OCCUPY
## Occupy the Future: It takes a village to do just about everything 
### SHARON JANK Ph.D. Candidate, Sociology 
The old proverb, "it takes a
village to raise a child" cap
tures the reality that people
and families don't exist in isola
tion, but instead are socially con
nected member-citizens of larger
communities, society and, in
creasingly, the world. One of the
most profound implications of
this truth is an economic one: just
as children exist in a larger social
context with varying levels of con
tributions from family, teachers,
doctors and countless others who
invest in their upbringing, so too
do all products in society, from
test scores to share prices, result
from a series of interdependent
group processes in which many
people contribute.
Take my college degree, for ex
ample, While it took countless
hours of my own work, I didn't
earn it on my own and, in fact, if it
weren't for the talent and effort of
a myriad of others who supported
me throughout the process, I'd
likely still be cleaning floors in up
state New York. Contributions
and investments from friends, fam
ily and advisors made it possible
for me to work full-time while
chipping away at a bachelor's de
gree. Over-stretched co-workers,
like Jackie, took on parts of my
workload so that I could have time
to study for tests and prepare class
presentations. Students offered
advice on my admissions essays,
lent me their expensive GRE prep
materials and made sure that I
knew which internships and stu
dent positions were desirable. Ad

ministrators figured out how to
make every credit that I took work
triple-time. The city bus driver
picked me up near my home every
morning so I didn't have to walk to
work in the dark at 4 a.m. My fam
ily cooked meals for me because I
had no time or energy to cook for
myself. Academic advisors and
mentors encouraged me, believed
in me and kept me on course. The
local union reps fought to protect
the employee-benefit program
that allowed me to attend classes
while working.
The list of people who con
tributed to my college degree
goes on and on, yet, I always get
all the credit for the result. When
we think about upward mobility
and achieving economic success,
we tend to think in terms of meri
tocratic ideals and individual suc
cess. Is a system that takes so
much input to get a single positive
output the best we can do? More
importantly, what does it say
about our notions of success
when some of the people who
helped me climb the social ladder
remain trapped at the bottom?
As the nation grapples with
the nature of inequality, a com
monly asked question is whether
the unprecedented levels of in
come and wealth inequality in the
United States are the result of a
fair and open contest in which the
most talented and productive se
cure the most rewards. Or have
the "rules of the game" become
corrupt and unfair, calling into
question the legitimacy of in

equality? The trouble with this
question is that it offer only two
options: either the rules of society
are fair and inequality is justified,
or the game is corrupt and in
equality is not justified. In other
words, inequalities are a given,
and even if we could root out cor
ruption, then whatever we're left
with no matter the level of in
equality or suffering it includes
would be legitimate and fair.
Unfortunately, corruption and
nepotism aren't new, nor are they
contained to Wall Street. So while
this setup between fair or corrupt
inequality is alluring in its simplic
ity, we must resist the bait and en
tertain alternatives. Fairness isn't
simply the absence of corruption,
but rather an ongoing commit
ment to examine and evaluate the
opportunities and outcomes that
our society jointly produces. Cor
ruption isn't only individual peo
ple taking advantage of their posi
tion, but also a system that allows
people to contribute to the suc
cess of others with no improve
ment to their own material stan
dard of living. Why is it that
chances for upward mobility have
become so thin, are so few and far
between? What 1 hope for is a
shift in the way that we think
about how value is created in our
society and a realization that what
we produce for better and for
worse â€”is a collaborative en
deavor.
