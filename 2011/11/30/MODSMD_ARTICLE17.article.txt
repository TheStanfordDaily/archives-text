# Occupy the Future: Politics and inequality
## 
### FRANCES ZLOTNICK Ph.D. Candidate, Political Science 
In November 2004 I was 18
years old, a college freshman
voting in my first election. I was
excited because it was an impor
tant election and I was voting in a
swing state, in a small college town
in rural Ohio, where every news
source claimed the election would
be decided. When I arrived at my
voting precinct on Election Day, I
found a line that snaked through
every room in the building, dou
bling back on itself and ending
outside in the frigid rain. I waited
in line for six hours before reach
ing the front, where I saw that only
two voting booths had been allo
cated for around 1800 voters, com
pared to one booth per 100 voters
in Republican-heavy districts. I
missed a class and dinner in order
to vote, and in the end, my candi
date conceded the election before
the ballots that we had waited
hours in line to cast were fully
counted. I found out later that the
six- to 10-hour waits at my precinct
had occurred all around Ohio, but
almost exclusively in college towns
and in majority-black precincts.
The under-allocation of voting
booths was part of a strategy used
by Secretary of State Ken Black
well, who was serving simultane
ously as co-chair of the Bush Cam
paign in Ohio, to systematically
suppress votes from Democratic
constituencies. That night Ohio
went to Bush by a 2-percent mar
gin, giving him a second term, and
I stopped believing that elections
in America were fair or truly dem
ocratic.
Four years later, I graduated
into the worst recession since the
Depression. Like many other
young people, I came back home
to live with my mom, and after six
months of searching unsuccessful
ly for a job that would use my de
gree, I took an unpaid internship
and a part-time job at a coffee
shop. Three-and-a-half years after
that, young people continue to

bear the brunt of the effects of the
recession. Youth unemployment
has increased far more than in any
other age group, and starting
wages are depressed as entry-level
jobs have transformed into unpaid
internships, accessible only to
those whose parents can subsidize
their living expenses. Tuition at
public universities increases every
year, even as subsidized educa
tional loans and grants shrink or
disappear entirely, leaving young
people saddled with enormous
debt. Many people I graduated
with are still living at home, search
ing for a j ob that j ustifies, financial
ly and intellectually, the time, ef
fort and money they put into earn
ing a degree. They are the base of
the Occupy movement.
If you don't see the connection
between what happened in 2004
and 2008, let me explain. Though
we like to say that democratically
elected officials are accountable
to the people, it is more accurate
to say they are accountable to the
voters. The deliberate disenfran
chisement of college students that
I experienced in 2004 is an exam
ple of how democratic accounta
bility is minimized by manipulat
ing which segments of the popula
tion are over- or under-represent
ed among voters. Laws or direc
tives that make it difficult for
members of certain groups to
vote whether they be college
students, people who are poor,
ethnic and language minorities or
people who have been incarcerat
ed reduce the need for politi
cians (of either party) to advocate
for the groups' needs in order to
retain their support in the next
election. Why are the needs of
young people, the struggling
masses and minorities depriori
tized in American public policy?
Because they don't vote. Why
don't they vote? Because our po
litical institutions are designed
specifically to discourage it.

Attempts to disenfranchise tra
ditionally Democratic constituen
cies have become increasingly
common, justified by specious and
unsubstantiated concerns about
voter fraud. Most states require
voters to reregister every time
they change addresses, and thirty
one states currently or by 2012 will
require voters to show ID before
casting a ballot. Several states have
abolished early voting, which al
lowed people who aren't able to
make it to the polls on Election
Day to vote at a more convenient
time, and some states are now re
stricting which organizations can
register people to vote. Young
people, particularly college stu
dents, and ethnic minorities move
often, are far more likely to lack
forms of ID accepted under the
most stringent voter ID laws and
are major users of early voting op
tions, when available. They also
tend to vote for Democrats, a fact
not lost on the Republican-con
trolled state legislatures that have
passed nearly all of these restric
tive voting laws.
Political and economic inequal
ity in America are intimately
linked. Political inequality main
tains the structures that support
the growth of economic inequality,
and economic inequality perpetu
ates the gap in political influence
between the 1 percent and the 99
percent. The Occupy movement
has finally brought this truth into
public discourse. Now we must
focus on developing concrete
goals for challenging this system.
Repealing all laws that place oner
ous burdens on citizens attempt
ing to exercise their right to vote
and holding public officials ac
countable for discriminatory prac
tices that result in unequal access
to the vote that would be a
good place to start.
