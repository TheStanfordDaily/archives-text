## Neuheisel a class act up to the end 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
In the face of multiple sexual
abuse scandals at big-time col
lege athletic programs, it seems
only fitting that UCLA football
coach Rick Neuheisel is rising
above the fray and revealing himself to
be a class act just days after being told
he would be fired following the Bru
ins' upcoming appearance in the inau
gural Pac-12 Championship on Friday.
It's about as awkward a situation
that any head coach could be in, and
that's saying something considering
that soon after he was hired as the
coach at the University of Washington
in 2003, Neuheisel found himself in vi
olation of NCAA recruiting rules be
fore even coaching a game.
Let's take a look back at how this
teeter-totter season has gone for the
former Bruins quarterback...
Sept. 3: Opening weekend
Neuheisel leads the team onto the
field at Houston and rolled up 554
yards of total offense on the Cougars, a
figure that usually doesn't fair too
poorly on Saturdays. But Houston had
some guy named Case Keenum han
dling the snaps, and he was outstand
ing in handing UCLA yet another
opening-day loss on the road.
Week Two: Beat up on the little guy
Not much to say here, as the Bruins
looked bad but didn't have too much
trouble dealing San Jose State its 24th
loss in the past 27 games. Neuheisel's
seat, which was warming heading into
the season, remained lukewarm.
Week Three: Get beat up by the big
guy Again, not much to say here, ex
cept that instead of preying on a weak
team early in the season, the Bruins
were smacked around by No. 23 Texas
at home, and alumni and boosters
were quick to start grumbling after an
embarrassing 49-20 loss.
Week Four: Righting the ship
UCLA starts to settle into what will be
a year-long pattern with a close win
over Oregon State in its Pac-12 open
er. Neuheisel starts Richard Brehaut
at quarterback after Kevin Prince's
horrific showing against the Long
horns, but he won't be starting for long
after...
Week Five: Take a whooping from
Stanford Brehaut can't hang with the
high-powered Cardinal offense, which
puts up 45 on the porous UCLA de
fense and sees Andrew Luck make
one of the top catches of the season.
Week Six: Squeak out another win
over a mediocre team Like TimTebow,
Neuheisel comes alive when his back

is up against the wall. With his seat
quite hot now, Tricky Rick improves
to 2-1 in conference play with a late
rally to beat Washington State.
Week Seven: Lay an egg on the
road Apparently, Rick doesn't like to
get in any kind of rhythm, as he man
ages to rally his troops on national tel
evision to a huge win over Arizona in
a key Pac-12 matchup. Or not. UCLA
comes out flat, falls flatter and makes
the most noise not with its offense, but
via massive brawl sparked by a streak
er on the field. Going down 42-7 at
halftime isn't usually the way to say
you want to keep your job.
Week Eight: Sneak up on a great
California team That was a lie. I just
lied. Cal was neither great, nor did the
Bruins sneak up on them. But some
how UCLA rushed for 294 yards and
beat its bear brethren in Pasadena.
Week Nine: Shock the world for
real 1 know Arizona State isn't really
very good, and it's always a bad sign
when you are a trendy dark horse
BCS pick in the preseason, are in po
sition to make some moves midsea
son and then tank like the Sun Devils
did this year. UCLA wins by one
point when Arizona State misses a
last-second field goal and takes the in
side track to the Pac-12 South title,
otherwise known as the crown of
shame.
Week Ten: Throw it all away The
Bruins give it all back by losing to a
Utah team that was winless in its first
four conference games. It wasn't pret
ty (Prince threw two picks and the
Bruins mustered two field goals on of
fense), it wasn't close (31-6) and
Neuheisel apparently told his players
to take a snow day and not show up.
Week Eleven: Crush the Buffs
Beating Colorado should be a given,
so let's just skip over UCLA's one
game this year that lived up to expec
tations.
Week Twelve: End of the road
Like I said earlier, it's hard to have a
rollercoaster ride with more twists
and turns and ups and downs than
Neuheisel's tenure in Westwood. But
after clinching the Pac-12 South title
when Utah lost on Friday night, USC
hung half a hundred points on them,
and it really looked like the Bruins
would have had trouble stopping a
good high school team, let alone Matt
Barkley, Marqise Lee and Robert
Woods. Add in that Rick said earlier
in the week he felt UCLA had "closed
the gap more" with the Trojans
who would have won the Pac-12
South except for NCAA sanctions
prohibiting them from postseason
play and it was truly a no-win situ
ation for the old ball coach.
So let's summarize: Loss, win, loss,
win, loss, win, loss, win, win, loss, win,
loss. And still the Bruins have a
chance to make it to the Rose Bowl.
They'd have to beat Oregon which
would be about as likely as undefeat
ed Houston getting to play for a na
tional championship but still
Neuheisel got the axe.
But back to my main point, which
is that right now you'd be hard
pressed to find a coach in a similar sit
uation saying and doing the same
things (and the right things) right now.
"I thought we had moved the needle
as we had been asked to do," he told
the L. A.Times this week. "But I guess
I was naive and I wasn't aware of all
the negativity on the outside."
Clearly not, because plenty of peo
ple saw this coming from a mile away
he did go 21-28 in four seasons at
UCLA. "No one should feel sorry for
me," he says. "I had my shot."
True. But I applaud him for step
ping up and taking the blame for a
program that simply isn't attracting
recruits in the shadow of USC and is
going to struggle for several years no
matter who is at the helm.

Despite his respect for Neuheisel,
Miles will be quite bitter if the Bruins
end up in the Rose Bowl. Remind
him that this is basically impossible at
milesbs@stanford.edu and check
him out on Twitter @smilesbsmith.

Neuheisel's tenure in Westwood. But
after clinching the Pac-12 South title
when Utah lost on Friday night, USC
hung half a hundred points on them,
and it really looked like the Bruins
would have had trouble stopping a
good high school team, let alone Matt
Barkley, Marqise Lee and Robert
Woods. Add in that Rick said earlier
in the week he felt UCLA had "closed
the gap more" with the Trojans
who would have won the Pac-12
South except for NCAA sanctions
prohibiting them from postseason
play and it was truly a no-win situ
ation for the old ball coach.
So let's summarize: Loss, win, loss,
win, loss, win, loss, win, win, loss, win,
loss. And still the Bruins have a
chance to make it to the Rose Bowl.
They'd have to beat Oregon which
would be about as likely as undefeat
ed Houston getting to play for a na
tional championship but still
Neuheisel got the axe.
But back to my main point, which
is that right now you'd be hard
pressed to find a coach in a similar sit
uation saying and doing the same
things (and the right things) right now.
"I thought we had moved the needle
as we had been asked to do," he told
the L. A.Times this week. "But I guess
I was naive and I wasn't aware of all
the negativity on the outside."
Clearly not, because plenty of peo
ple saw this coming from a mile away
he did go 21-28 in four seasons at
UCLA. "No one should feel sorry for
me," he says. "I had my shot."
True. But I applaud him for step
ping up and taking the blame for a
program that simply isn't attracting
recruits in the shadow of USC and is
going to struggle for several years no
matter who is at the helm.

Despite his respect for Neuheisel,
Miles will be quite bitter if the Bruins
end up in the Rose Bowl. Remind
him that this is basically impossible at
milesbs@stanford.edu and check
him out on Twitter @smilesbsmith.
In the face of multiple sexual
abuse scandals at big-time col
lege athletic programs, it seems
only fitting that UCLA football
coach Rick Neuheisel is rising
above the fray and revealing himself to
be a class act just days after being told
he would be fired following the Bru
ins' upcoming appearance in the inau
gural Pac-12 Championship on Friday.
It's about as awkward a situation
that any head coach could be in, and
that's saying something considering
that soon after he was hired as the
coach at the University of Washington
in 2003, Neuheisel found himself in vi
olation of NCAA recruiting rules be
fore even coaching a game.
Let's take a look back at how this
teeter-totter season has gone for the
former Bruins quarterback...
Sept. 3: Opening weekend
Neuheisel leads the team onto the
field at Houston and rolled up 554
yards of total offense on the Cougars, a
figure that usually doesn't fair too
poorly on Saturdays. But Houston had
some guy named Case Keenum han
dling the snaps, and he was outstand
ing in handing UCLA yet another
opening-day loss on the road.
Week Two: Beat up on the little guy
Not much to say here, as the Bruins
looked bad but didn't have too much
trouble dealing San Jose State its 24th
loss in the past 27 games. Neuheisel's
seat, which was warming heading into
the season, remained lukewarm.
Week Three: Get beat up by the big
guy Again, not much to say here, ex
cept that instead of preying on a weak
team early in the season, the Bruins
were smacked around by No. 23 Texas
at home, and alumni and boosters
were quick to start grumbling after an
embarrassing 49-20 loss.
Week Four: Righting the ship
UCLA starts to settle into what will be
a year-long pattern with a close win
over Oregon State in its Pac-12 open
er. Neuheisel starts Richard Brehaut
at quarterback after Kevin Prince's
horrific showing against the Long
horns, but he won't be starting for long
after...
Week Five: Take a whooping from
Stanford Brehaut can't hang with the
high-powered Cardinal offense, which
puts up 45 on the porous UCLA de
fense and sees Andrew Luck make
one of the top catches of the season.
Week Six: Squeak out another win
over a mediocre team Like TimTebow,
Neuheisel comes alive when his back

is up against the wall. With his seat
quite hot now, Tricky Rick improves
to 2-1 in conference play with a late
rally to beat Washington State.
Week Seven: Lay an egg on the
road Apparently, Rick doesn't like to
get in any kind of rhythm, as he man
ages to rally his troops on national tel
evision to a huge win over Arizona in
a key Pac-12 matchup. Or not. UCLA
comes out flat, falls flatter and makes
the most noise not with its offense, but
via massive brawl sparked by a streak
er on the field. Going down 42-7 at
halftime isn't usually the way to say
you want to keep your job.
Week Eight: Sneak up on a great
California team That was a lie. I just
lied. Cal was neither great, nor did the
Bruins sneak up on them. But some
how UCLA rushed for 294 yards and
beat its bear brethren in Pasadena.
Week Nine: Shock the world for
real 1 know Arizona State isn't really
very good, and it's always a bad sign
when you are a trendy dark horse
BCS pick in the preseason, are in po
sition to make some moves midsea
son and then tank like the Sun Devils
did this year. UCLA wins by one
point when Arizona State misses a
last-second field goal and takes the in
side track to the Pac-12 South title,
otherwise known as the crown of
shame.
Week Ten: Throw it all away The
Bruins give it all back by losing to a
Utah team that was winless in its first
four conference games. It wasn't pret
ty (Prince threw two picks and the
Bruins mustered two field goals on of
fense), it wasn't close (31-6) and
Neuheisel apparently told his players
to take a snow day and not show up.
Week Eleven: Crush the Buffs
Beating Colorado should be a given,
so let's just skip over UCLA's one
game this year that lived up to expec
tations.
Week Twelve: End of the road
Like I said earlier, it's hard to have a
rollercoaster ride with more twists
and turns and ups and downs than
Neuheisel's tenure in Westwood. But
