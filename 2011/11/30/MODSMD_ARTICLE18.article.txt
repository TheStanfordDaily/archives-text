## Neuheisel a class act up to the end 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
In the face of multiple sexual
abuse scandals at big-time col
lege athletic programs, it seems
only fitting that UCLA football
coach Rick Neuheisel is rising
above the fray and revealing himself to
be a class act just days after being told
he would be fired following the Bru
ins' upcoming appearance in the inau
gural Pac-12 Championship on Friday.
It's about as awkward a situation
that any head coach could be in, and
that's saying something considering
that soon after he was hired as the
coach at the University of Washington
in 2003, Neuheisel found himself in vi
olation of NCAA recruiting rules be
fore even coaching a game.
Let's take a look back at how this
teeter-totter season has gone for the
former Bruins quarterback...
Sept. 3: Opening weekend
Neuheisel leads the team onto the
field at Houston and rolled up 554
yards of total offense on the Cougars, a
figure that usually doesn't fair too
poorly on Saturdays. But Houston had
some guy named Case Keenum han
dling the snaps, and he was outstand
ing in handing UCLA yet another
opening-day loss on the road.
Week Two: Beat up on the little guy
Not much to say here, as the Bruins
looked bad but didn't have too much
trouble dealing San Jose State its 24th
loss in the past 27 games. Neuheisel's
seat, which was warming heading into
the season, remained lukewarm.
Week Three: Get beat up by the big
guy Again, not much to say here, ex
cept that instead of preying on a weak
team early in the season, the Bruins
were smacked around by No. 23 Texas
at home, and alumni and boosters
were quick to start grumbling after an
embarrassing 49-20 loss.
Week Four: Righting the ship
UCLA starts to settle into what will be
a year-long pattern with a close win
over Oregon State in its Pac-12 open
er. Neuheisel starts Richard Brehaut
at quarterback after Kevin Prince's
horrific showing against the Long
horns, but he won't be starting for long
after...
Week Five: Take a whooping from
Stanford Brehaut can't hang with the
high-powered Cardinal offense, which
puts up 45 on the porous UCLA de
fense and sees Andrew Luck make
one of the top catches of the season.
Week Six: Squeak out another win
over a mediocre team Like TimTebow,
Neuheisel comes alive when his back
