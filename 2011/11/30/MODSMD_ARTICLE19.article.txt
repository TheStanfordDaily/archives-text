# TOURNAMENT TIME
## CARDINAL OPENS PLAY FRIDAY IN GAINESVILLE 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite a slight stumble down the stretch, the
Stanford women's volleyball team once again finds
itself in the NCAA Women's Volleyball Champi
onship this weekend, the team's 31st consecutive
appearance in the tournament. Stanford is one of
just two teams to qualify for all 31 NCAA Tourna
ments (the other being No. 9 Penn State) and is
looking to add a seventh title to its mantle.
No. 6 Stanford (21-7) is the No. 11 overall seed in
the tournament, as well as the No. 3 seed in the
Gainesville regional. The Cardinal's road to the
Final Four will start Friday against Sacred Heart.
However, the Pioneers are no easy foe as they went
27-7 this season and won the Northeast Conference
(NEC) for the second year in a row. They head to
Maples Pavilion riding a nine-game winning streak
and would love to pull off a major first-round upset
over the reeling Cardinal.
The Pioneers are led on offense by senior middle
blocker Kimmee Roleder, who ranks third in the
NEC in kills per set and points per set, with 3.94 and
4.60 respectively. But Sacred Heart's other star is
sophomore outside hitter Dianis Mercado, who led
the conference in aces per set and also ranked in the

top ten in kills. The dynamic duo is heavily featured
in the Pioneers' offense, and together they account
ed for over 50 percent of the team's total hitting at
tempts for the season. Limiting them will be the key
to a Cardinal victory.
The winner of the Stanford-Sacred Heart
matchup will face the winner of the match between
Baylor (18-14) and Michigan (20-12). No. 22 Michi
gan finished its season ranked eighth in the Big Ten
and had to rely on strong out-of-conference per
formances to earn its at-large bid to the tourna
ment. The Wolverines feature one of the strongest
service games in the nation, with three players
ranking in the top 10 in the conference in aces per
set.
The Bears did not perform well in their confer
ence either, finishing seventh out of the nine Big 12
volleyball teams. They enter the tournament riding
a three-game losing streak and would like to turn
things around against the Wolverines. The Bears
are fronted by All-Big 12 First Team senior middle
blocker Briana Tolbert, who led the team in kills,
kills per set and hitting percentage.
Overall, the Cardinal will face a tough task on
the road in pursuit of another berth in the NCAA
