# TOURNAMENT TIME
## CARDINAL OPENS PLAY FRIDAY IN GAINESVILLE 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite a slight stumble down the stretch, the
Stanford women's volleyball team once again finds
itself in the NCAA Women's Volleyball Champi
onship this weekend, the team's 31st consecutive
appearance in the tournament. Stanford is one of
just two teams to qualify for all 31 NCAA Tourna
ments (the other being No. 9 Penn State) and is
looking to add a seventh title to its mantle.
No. 6 Stanford (21-7) is the No. 11 overall seed in
the tournament, as well as the No. 3 seed in the
Gainesville regional. The Cardinal's road to the
Final Four will start Friday against Sacred Heart.
However, the Pioneers are no easy foe as they went
27-7 this season and won the Northeast Conference
(NEC) for the second year in a row. They head to
Maples Pavilion riding a nine-game winning streak
and would love to pull off a major first-round upset
over the reeling Cardinal.
The Pioneers are led on offense by senior middle
blocker Kimmee Roleder, who ranks third in the
NEC in kills per set and points per set, with 3.94 and
4.60 respectively. But Sacred Heart's other star is
sophomore outside hitter Dianis Mercado, who led
the conference in aces per set and also ranked in the

top ten in kills. The dynamic duo is heavily featured
in the Pioneers' offense, and together they account
ed for over 50 percent of the team's total hitting at
tempts for the season. Limiting them will be the key
to a Cardinal victory.
The winner of the Stanford-Sacred Heart
matchup will face the winner of the match between
Baylor (18-14) and Michigan (20-12). No. 22 Michi
gan finished its season ranked eighth in the Big Ten
and had to rely on strong out-of-conference per
formances to earn its at-large bid to the tourna
ment. The Wolverines feature one of the strongest
service games in the nation, with three players
ranking in the top 10 in the conference in aces per
set.
The Bears did not perform well in their confer
ence either, finishing seventh out of the nine Big 12
volleyball teams. They enter the tournament riding
a three-game losing streak and would like to turn
things around against the Wolverines. The Bears
are fronted by All-Big 12 First Team senior middle
blocker Briana Tolbert, who led the team in kills,
kills per set and hitting percentage.
Overall, the Cardinal will face a tough task on
the road in pursuit of another berth in the NCAA

All-Pac-12 First Team honoree Carly Wopat (No. 2) and the Stanford women's volleyball team are the No.
11 overall seed in this year's NCAA Tournament. The Card will face Sacred Heart in its first match on Friday.
title match which would be its
seventh in the last 11 years. If Stan
ford makes it past Sacred Heart
and the Michigan-Baylor winner, it
will likely face the University of
Northern lowa in the round of 16.
No. 11 UNI received the No. 6
overall seed in the tournament, de
spite its low AVCA ranking. In
fact, the No. 1 seed in the
Gainesville regional, Illinois, is

ranked No. 7 in the nation, also
below the Cardinal.
But the inconsistencies in the
NCAA seeding compared to the
AVCA rankings appear to be in
Stanford's favor. Not one team
from the Pac-12, widely considered
the strongest conference in
women's volleyball, is in its region
al, and the Cardinal finds itself as
the top-ranked team in
Gainesville.
If Stanford does manage to
make it to the Final Four, it will
face a major test against the winner
of the Honolulu regional. In yet
another demonstration of the

strangeness of the tournament
seeding, the top three teams in the
nation (Pac-12 champion USC,Big
Ten champion Nebraska and WAC
champion Hawaii) were all placed
in the same regional. No. 10 Cal,
which finds itself unseeded despite
at one point being ranked No. 1 in
the nation, No. 13 Oregon and No.
18 Pepperdine were also placed in
the Honolulu region, and none
should go down easily. Whichever
team survives Honolulu will be a
major obstacle in Stanford's path
to the championship game.
The other side of the bracket
figures to be competitive as well.

The Lexington regional features
the tournament's No. 1 overall
seed, Big 12 champion, No. 5 Texas;
the defending national champions,
No. 9 Penn State and No. 4 UCLA,
who finished second in the Pac-12.
Whoever survives Lexington will
face the winner of the Minneapolis
regional, which appears to be the
weakest of the four. No. 14 lowa
State received the top seed and the
only top-10 team is No. 8 Purdue.
Stanford kicks off its NCAA
Tournament at Maples Pavilion at
7 p.m. Friday after the 4:30 Michi
gan-Baylor showdown. The winner
of the two matchups will face one

another in Maples at 7 p.m. on Sat
urday.
