## Gatewood latest Card dual-threat 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
At any level of football, attrition
is the story of every team's season.
Players get hurt. Coaches agonize
over position battles. Fans speculate
about who will fill the voids left by
others.
That's why the Stanford football
team always says its motto about in
juries is "Next man up." If a player
goes down especially a player
like Shayne Skov or Chris Owusu
someone else has to step up.
But for the Cardinal, sometimes
it's not a problem of talent but a
problem of economics supply
doesn't meet demand and that
means a player has to change posi
tions in order to make a necessary
difference for a team that's in con
tention for a national champi

That's been the story this season
for redshirt senior Corey Gate
wood, who has stepped in and made
his impact felt on the Cardinal de
fense late this season, including
snagging an interception last Satur
day against Notre Dame a par

as a wide receiver.
After playing defensive back for
the past three seasons, Gatewood
transitioned to the Cardinal offense
in the off-season, hoping to fill in as
one of Andrew Luck's primary
pass-catchers after the Cardinal lost
its best two wide receivers from
2010 to the NFL.
But due to the emergence of
Stanford's trio of tight ends and fel
low senior receiver Griff Whalen,
the Massachusetts native found
himself a little-used corollary in one
of the nation's most prolific offens
es, as he only touched the ball twice
in the early part of the season, mak
ing one catch for 22 yards and one
rush for minus 2 yards. But when
cornerback Barry Browning and
safety Delano Howell fell to in
juries midway through the season,
Stanford defensive coordinator
Derek Mason was forced to scram
ble to find some depth on his de
fense and he knew exactly who
to turn to.
"When I first got here, the coach
ing team was concerned with what
he really wanted to do," Mason said.
"He wanted to try the offensive side
of the ball, and we wound up in a sit
uation that for him, he felt like
that's where his best football was
going to be played."
"This year, due to some injuries
and where we are, I talked to Corey
and I said, 'Hey Corey, what is your
