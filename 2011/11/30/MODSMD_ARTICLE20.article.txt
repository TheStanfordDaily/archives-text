## Gatewood latest Card dual-threat 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
At any level of football, attrition
is the story of every team's season.
Players get hurt. Coaches agonize
over position battles. Fans speculate
about who will fill the voids left by
others.
That's why the Stanford football
team always says its motto about in
juries is "Next man up." If a player
goes down especially a player
like Shayne Skov or Chris Owusu
someone else has to step up.
But for the Cardinal, sometimes
it's not a problem of talent but a
problem of economics supply
doesn't meet demand and that
means a player has to change posi
tions in order to make a necessary
difference for a team that's in con
tention for a national champi
onship.
That's been the story this season
for redshirt senior Corey Gate
wood, who has stepped in and made
his impact felt on the Cardinal de
fense late this season, including
snagging an interception last Satur
day against Notre Dame a par
ticularly impressive feat consider
ing the fact that he started the year
as a wide receiver.
After playing defensive back for
the past three seasons, Gatewood
transitioned to the Cardinal offense
in the off-season, hoping to fill in as
one of Andrew Luck's primary
pass-catchers after the Cardinal lost
its best two wide receivers from
2010 to the NFL.
But due to the emergence of
Stanford's trio of tight ends and fel
low senior receiver Griff Whalen,
the Massachusetts native found
himself a little-used corollary in one
of the nation's most prolific offens
es, as he only touched the ball twice
in the early part of the season, mak
ing one catch for 22 yards and one
rush for minus 2 yards. But when
cornerback Barry Browning and
safety Delano Howell fell to in
juries midway through the season,
Stanford defensive coordinator
Derek Mason was forced to scram
ble to find some depth on his de
fense and he knew exactly who
to turn to.
"When I first got here, the coach
ing team was concerned with what
he really wanted to do," Mason said.
"He wanted to try the offensive side
of the ball, and we wound up in a sit
uation that for him, he felt like
that's where his best football was
going to be played."
"This year, due to some injuries
and where we are, I talked to Corey
and I said, 'Hey Corey, what is your
interest in playing on this side of the
ball, man, because I really think that
you could help us.' And he said,
'Coach, I just want to play.' And it's
been good," he continued.
After just two weeks practicing
with the defense, Gatewood has
done anything but show up to fill
space, grabbing an interception in
the second quarter of last Satur
day's game against Notre Dame, as
well as making five tackles and
breaking up two passes in the last
three games.
"He's added some depth as well
as some competitive spirit to what
we do," Mason said. "He's made us
better and he's helped bolster our
unit outside."
Mason said that the coaches
were just fine with making switches
midseason because there's no room
for weakness when you're ranked
in the top five in the country.
"Our deal is, I wanted to get the
best football players on the field,
and I want to make sure they know
and understand what we do,"
Mason said.
Interestingly, Mason's defensive
backfield is mostly made up of re
placements guys who aren't de
fensive backs originally includ
ing the Stanford secondary's two
best players, Delano Howell and
Michael Thomas.
Howell, a senior from Newhall,
Calif., began his Stanford career as
a running back and kick returner,
and accounted for 439 yards of of
fense his freshman year before
switching to safety as a sophomore.
Somewhat similarly, Thomas
(who has played his entire career on

the Farm as a defensive back) was
an option-style quarterback in high
school who rushed for over 1500
yards as a prep star in his hometown
of Houston, Texas, and was rated
the 43rd-best running back in the
country coming out of high school
by Scout.com.
Mason said that his defense was
made up of players like Howell,
Thomas and Gatewood because he
subscribes to the theory of New
England Patriots' head coach Bill
Belichick if they can make a dif
ference, they will play.
"You're trying to take the best
athletes and then find out where
they're going to play. You never
know what a young man's going to
be a year or two removed from high
school, you just hope that he's will
ing, he's got a high football IQ and
he's got a skill set that allows him to
be successful," he said. "That's what
we've done, whether it's Delano or
Mike or a guy like [freshman defen
sive back] Jordan Richards, who
played as a true freshman this year,
or [sophomore defensive back]
Devon Carrington, those guys all
played offense coming out [of high
school]."
Mason said the Cardinal coach
ing staff could usually get a good feel
for what position a player would end
up being during the recruiting
process, but that the success of Gate
wood and others on the defensive
side of the ball hasn't come as a sur
prise to him, especially because
Stanford has a historic precedent for
success with switching sides.
"Sometimes those guys blossom
into something where you never
thought that they would played
there, but they do," he said. "Just
like [nine-time NFL pro bowler]
John Lynch played here on the of
fensive side of the ball as a quarter
back then ended up as a safety."

With all the position switching
that occurs on the Stanford team
and the track record of achieve
ment that comes with it it makes
one wonder if any player is safe at
his spot.
Mason said that's not the case
with him.
"What I do as a coach, I try to
make sure that all of our guys know
that they are replaceable. You ei

ther can do it or you can't," he said.
Head coach David Shaw even
suggested that quarterback An
drew Luck could switch spots after
his one-handed circus catch against
UCLA earlier this year.
"There's about five positions the
guy could play: receiver, tight end,
outside linebacker," Shaw said after
the Cardinal's 45-19 victory over
the Bruins.

And while it's likely that Mason
would like to see Luck suit up on
defense, Shaw added an important
qualifier to his statement.
"We kind of like what he does at
quarterback."
Perhaps, in just this one case,
change isn't always for the best.

Fifth-year senior Corey Gatewood started the season as a wide receiver before switching to defensive back. He
represents a pipeline of dynamic players that see action on both sides of the ball during their Stanford careers.
