## Whalen named finalist for walk-on award 
### â€“ Zach Zimmerman 
Stanford wide receiver Griff Whalen has
been named one of three finalists for the
Burlsworth Trophy, an award given to the na
tion's best player who began his career as a
walk-on.
The senior from Sylvania, Ohio more than

doubled his career receptions this season,
leading the Cardinal with 49 after entering his
final campaign with just 24. His 664 yards are
also a team-best despite recording no more
than 31 yards in the team's first four games.
Whalen came to Stanford as a defensive
back but was quickly converted to wide re
ceiver. He became an integral part of the re
ceiving rotation, where he provided relief in
the slot. At just 6-foot-l and 185 pounds,

Whalen has relied on excellent route-running
to gain separation from defenders and has
flourished in underneath routes.
This season, he has emerged as Stanford
quarterback Andrew Luck's go-to receiver.
Whalen has notched two 100-yard games and
was one of the squad's few bright spots in the
Nov. 12 loss to Oregon, a contest in which he
racked up 107 yards and two touchdowns on
nine receptions.

Whalen joins Houston wide receiver
Patrick Edwards and Southern Mississippi
quarterback Austin Davis in the final selec
tion for the Burlsworth Trophy. The online
fan-voting component of the award, which ac
counts for five percent, concludes on Dec. 7.
