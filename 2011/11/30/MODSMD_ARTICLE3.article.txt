# ASSU Chief of Staff steps down
## Emma Ogiemwanye '12 resigns in favor of spending winter quarter abroad 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN 
Current ASSU Executive Chief of
Staff Emma Ogiemwanye 'l2 will be
stepping down in January to spend win
ter quarter abroad. The ASSU is "in the
process of selecting someone to fill [the]
role for winter quarter," Ogiemwanye
said in an email to The Daily.
When asked if he thought the mid
year shift would disrupt the ASSU Exec
utive's operations, ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2 said he was not con
cerned.

"Emma has done a very good job of
laying really good groundwork and a
foundation to ensure that while she
will be missed personally the work
that the ASSU has been doing will con

tinue," he said.
Ogiemwanye's resignation comes
after a series of shake-ups in the ASSU
Executive team this fall. In October,
E2.0, a branch of the Executive formed
to advocate for student social entrepre
neurs, separated from the ASSU with
the resignation of both ASSU Co-Chairs
of Entrepreneurship Dan Thompson 'l3
and Jon Manzi 'l3. Most recently, Chair
of the Community Action Board Arace
ly Mondragon 'l3 resigned, citing per
sonal reasons.

To find Ogiemwanye's replacement,
Cruz said "there will be an open applica
tion process, but we'll also be looking
heavily at candidates that we have al-
ready received applications from
for previous roles."
The abrupt change in the ASSU
Executive team follows a recent
debate in the ASSU over the per
missibility of going abroad while
serving as an ASSU representative.
In spring of 2010, Ben Jensen 'l2, a
recently-elected Senator for the
upcoming academic year, enrolled
in the fall 2010 Bing Overseas Stud
ies Program in Berlin despite
the fact he had already signed a
declaration that said he intended to
be on campus all year.
When the issue came to light,
Jensen eventually withdrew from
the fall program and decided he
would apply for the Berlin program
for the following spring quarter,

which he did ultimately attend. The
12th Undergraduate Senate rati
fied a bill that would prevent Sena
tors from spending time abroad or
off-campus for an extended period
of time, effective with the 13th Un
dergraduate Senate, which took of
fice last spring.
The decision is made more sig
nificant because members of the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate and
the Executive are paid stipends.
Although the Chief of Staff po
sition ordinarily receives a person
al stipend of $2,500, Ogiemwanye
said she "won't be paid since I
won't be here and won't be work
ing."
Cruz and Vice President Stew
art Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 appoint
ed Ogiemwanye to the Executive
team last spring.
Cruz said that, following "a very,
very intensive application process"
in which "we received a lot of appli
cations," he and Macgregor-Dennis

appointed Emma because "she was
the most qualified and the best bal
ance for our ASSU Executive."
When asked if he knew, at the
time, that Ogiemwanye planned to
go abroad, Cruz said, "It was a dis
cussion we had entered into."
Cruz declined to say whether or
not Ogiemwanye will resume her
position once she returns to cam
pus in the spring.
"That's a bridge we will cross
when we get to it," he said.
Although the responsibilities of
the ASSU Chief of Staff shift year
to-year as decided by the President
and Vice President, Cruz said that
he and Stewart see Ogiemwanye as
"a third partner in the ASSU Exec
utive."
The Chief of Staff acts as "the
chief administrative officer of the
ASSU executives," Cruz added.
Ogiemwanye described her po
sition as "making sure that all the
cabinet chairs are working on the

things that they committed to work
ing on . . . You make sure that
everybody's talking."
At the time of her appointment,
Ogiemwanye was in Washington
D.C. She said she "participated in
hours of Skype meetings" to fulfill
her initial responsibilities.
Ogiemwanye added that acting
as a representative away from cam
pus "was difficult" and required her
to fly "back from Washington to
conduct interviews for the cabinet."
She said it was manageable, howev
er, because the ASSU was still in the
planning stages.
"At this point, my work cannot
be done well remotely," she said.
"Emma is an amazing person,
and we picked her because she was
the best and most qualified," Cruz
said. "It will be difficult to fill those
shoes, but we'll manage,"
