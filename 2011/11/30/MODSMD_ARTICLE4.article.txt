## Record five Rhodes Scholars reflect on process 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford can claim five of the 32 recently an
nounced 2011 Rhodes Scholars more than
any other university and the most in Stanford's
history.
Through their accomplishments and intend
ed career plans, the new Rhodes Scholars repre
sent a microcosm of Stanford: a human rights ac
tivist, an economist, a medical anthropologist, a
biomedical scientist and an opinion columnist.
Seniors Tenzin Seldon 'l2 and Ishan Nath 'l2
and recent alumni Anand Habib 'll, Katherine
Niehaus 'lO, M.S. 'll and Aysha Bagchi 'll
joined 102 prior Stanford winners of arguably
the world's most prestigious fellowship, the
Rhodes Trust. Nath is a writer on The Daily's Ed
itorial Board, and Seldon serves as The Daily's
student-at-large.
The Rhodes Trust announced the recipients
on Nov. 19. The scholarship will pay tuition and
expenses for up to three years of graduate work
at the University of Oxford in England.
To determine whom to endorse for the
Rhodes Scholarship, Stanford has a process
which Bechtel International Center oversees.
An internal Stanford committee composed of
faculty and former Rhodes and Marshall Schol
ars interviews candidates who are recommend
ed by faculty members. This committee evalu
ates potential Stanford applicants and sends let
ters to the Rhodes Trust supporting the candi
dates they choose to endorse,
"I am delighted for the students," said John
Pearson, director of Bechtel.
According to Pearson, around 35 to 40 stu
dents seek endorsement from the University
each year for either the Rhodes or Marshall
Scholarship. He said this number has stayed con
stant over time, and noted there is no quota for
how many students the internal committee can
endorse,
Pearson said a factor that has contributed to
the high number of University winners is "the re
markable possibilities of engagement with sen-

ior faculty for research and teaching
that are offered to the undergradu
ate population." He also empha
sized the involvement of former
Rhodes Scholars in the process, not
ing that prior Stanford winners
have used their experience to help
current candidates.
Seldon, who became the first Ti
betan-American Rhodes scholar,
also cited the involvement of the
Stanford community.
"My professors and Stanford ad
ministrators were invaluable in this
process," Seldon said. "Although at
first I wavered in applying, my pro
fessors believed in me and told me I
was ready for this."
In particular, Seldon lauded the
assistance of both Pearson and
Diane Murk, manager of the Over
seas Resource Center. She noted
that they nurtured her to think
about her role as a leader and were
both supportive throughout the
process.
Seldon said the best piece of ad
vice she received was from the men
tor Stanford paired her with, 2007
Rhodes Scholar Julie Veroff 'O7. Ac
cording to Seldon, Veroff coun
seled, "Do not let anybody influ
ence who you authentically are.
They are not always looking for the
most charismatic leader, and in the
process of trying to be what you
think they want, people lose their
true voice."
Seldon, an emerging leader of the
Tibetan diaspora who served as a re
gional coordinator of Students for a

Free Tibet, said that throughout her
Rhodes interviews which were
focused on international policies
and ethical dilemmas she always
stayed true to her authentic self.
"That was something I never
lost," she said.
Seldon, who will study refugee
and forced migration studies at Ox
ford, said that "in a time of turmoil
around the world including Tibet, I
hope that this achievement can
bring about a lessening of suffering
and a smile to the 6 million people
of the Tibetan diaspora and
refugees around the world."
Nath, who worked as an intern at
the Office of Economic Policy at the
White Flouse and as a consultant to
the Department of Energy, noted
that he hopes his future will also in
volve government service but as
an economist.
"It would certainly be a dream
come true to follow in the footsteps
of some of President Obama's eco
nomic advisers," Nath said.
A former political columnist for
The Daily, Nath said that "winning
the Rhodes Scholarship is such a
team effort."
Nath said he is appreciative of
the support that Stanford provided
in the application process, adding
that the advice he received from
Pearson was instrumental in help
ing him figure out which parts of
himself and his passions to present.
"This scholarship is, more than
anything else, a statement about
what is expected from you in the fu

ture," Nath said. "There's definitely
a sense of responsibility to use this
scholarship to the fullest not just in
pursuit of my own goals, but also to
make an impact on the broader is
sues I hope to work on."
Habib, who will study public poli
cy and medical anthropology at Ox
ford, noted that he felt fortunate to
have had the opportunity to study at
Stanford, where so many resources
are available. He said students
should "explore all [of their] options
at Stanford, and be thankful for all
the individuals ready to support you
whatever you choose to do."
Currently working in a commu
nity health program in Haiti,
Habib said the key to success is to
"be both your toughest critic and
your greatest cheerleader." He
pointed out that he has received
more rejections than acceptances
and advised students not to be
afraid of failure.
"Thinking about being one of 32
Americans named Rhodes Scholar
still gives me chills," Habib added.
Niehaus, whose work focuses on
biomechanics and its application to
high technology entrepreneurship,
said she would like to either be a
professor or lead a company one
day using either profession to
make advancements in the field of
medicine.
A former captain of Stanford's
varsity track and cross-country
teams, Niehaus won the Pac-10
5,000 meters and was named an
Academic Ail-American. She said

that she learned through track that
she only performs her best when
she's calm and confident, and
knows "despite my best, I might not
reach my goals."
She also said she appreciated
how Stanford handled the process.
"I was quite surprised when I
talked with other finalists to hear
how involved their schools are
sometimes initiating contact with
them very early in their undergrad
uate career, making comments on
recommendation letters," Niehaus
said. "I think that Stanford's ap
proach is more hands-off, which I
think is good."
Niehaus plans to pursue a doc
torate in systems approaches to bio
medical sciences at Oxford. She
noted how quickly the Rhodes in
terview seemed to go and how
much she enjoyed talking "with a
group of thoughtful, opinionated
people."
Rounding out the group is
Bagchi, who said she plans to pur
sue editorial interests.
"I am considering going into
opinion journalism, a field I first dis
covered a love for as a columnist at
The Stanford Daily," Bagchi said.
She commented that she was
also attracted to the idea of a career
in human rights, constitutional law
and public policy. She was the recip
ient of the 2011 Dinkelspiel Award
for her contributions to undergrad
uate education.
"The biggest thing Stanford did
for me is bring into my life a handful

of extraordinary teachers and men
tors over the past four years,"
Bagchi said. "It is the simple truth: I
have them to thank for the scholar
ship."
In addition to the five Rhodes
Scholars, Stanford also claimed two
Mitchell Scholars and two Marshall
Scholars.
Philippe de Koning 'lO and
Tommy Tobin 'lO both won the
Mitchell Scholarship, which is
granted to 12 students and funds
one year of graduate study at a uni
versity in the Republic of Ireland or
Northern Ireland. Koning plans to
pursue a master's degree in interna
tional security and conflict resolu
tion at Dublin City University,
while Tobin plans to study law at
University College Cork.
Rayden Llano 'lO and Will
Stoeckle 'l2 were named two of the
36 Marshall Scholars this year. The
Marshall Scholarship, founded in
1953 by a British Act of Parliament
and named after U.S. Secretary of
State George C. Marshall, covers
the expenses for typically two years
of higher education at a university
in the United Kingdom. Llano plans
to study international health policy
at the London School of Economics
and Political Science while Stoeckle
will pursue master's degrees in both
international political economy and
international conflict studies at
King's College London.

day using either profession to
make advancements in the field of
medicine.
A former captain of Stanford's
varsity track and cross-country
teams, Niehaus won the Pac-10
5,000 meters and was named an
Academic Ail-American. She said

that she learned through track that
she only performs her best when
she's calm and confident, and
knows "despite my best, I might not
reach my goals."
She also said she appreciated
how Stanford handled the process.
"I was quite surprised when I
talked with other finalists to hear
how involved their schools are
sometimes initiating contact with
them very early in their undergrad
uate career, making comments on
recommendation letters," Niehaus
said. "I think that Stanford's ap
proach is more hands-off, which I
think is good."
Niehaus plans to pursue a doc
torate in systems approaches to bio
medical sciences at Oxford. She
noted how quickly the Rhodes in
terview seemed to go and how
much she enjoyed talking "with a
group of thoughtful, opinionated
people."
Rounding out the group is
Bagchi, who said she plans to pur
sue editorial interests.
"I am considering going into
opinion journalism, a field I first dis
covered a love for as a columnist at
The Stanford Daily," Bagchi said.
She commented that she was
also attracted to the idea of a career
in human rights, constitutional law
and public policy. She was the recip
ient of the 2011 Dinkelspiel Award
for her contributions to undergrad
uate education.
"The biggest thing Stanford did
for me is bring into my life a handful

of extraordinary teachers and men
tors over the past four years,"
Bagchi said. "It is the simple truth: I
have them to thank for the scholar
ship."
In addition to the five Rhodes
Scholars, Stanford also claimed two
Mitchell Scholars and two Marshall
Scholars.
Philippe de Koning 'lO and
Tommy Tobin 'lO both won the
Mitchell Scholarship, which is
granted to 12 students and funds
one year of graduate study at a uni
versity in the Republic of Ireland or
Northern Ireland. Koning plans to
pursue a master's degree in interna
tional security and conflict resolu
tion at Dublin City University,
while Tobin plans to study law at
University College Cork.
Rayden Llano 'lO and Will
Stoeckle 'l2 were named two of the
36 Marshall Scholars this year. The
Marshall Scholarship, founded in
1953 by a British Act of Parliament
and named after U.S. Secretary of
State George C. Marshall, covers
the expenses for typically two years
of higher education at a university
in the United Kingdom. Llano plans
to study international health policy
at the London School of Economics
and Political Science while Stoeckle
will pursue master's degrees in both
international political economy and
international conflict studies at
King's College London.

Stanford can claim five of the 32 recently an
nounced 2011 Rhodes Scholars more than
any other university and the most in Stanford's
history.
Through their accomplishments and intend
ed career plans, the new Rhodes Scholars repre
sent a microcosm of Stanford: a human rights ac
tivist, an economist, a medical anthropologist, a
biomedical scientist and an opinion columnist.
Seniors Tenzin Seldon 'l2 and Ishan Nath 'l2
and recent alumni Anand Habib 'll, Katherine
Niehaus 'lO, M.S. 'll and Aysha Bagchi 'll
joined 102 prior Stanford winners of arguably
the world's most prestigious fellowship, the
Rhodes Trust. Nath is a writer on The Daily's Ed
itorial Board, and Seldon serves as The Daily's
student-at-large.
The Rhodes Trust announced the recipients
on Nov. 19. The scholarship will pay tuition and
expenses for up to three years of graduate work
at the University of Oxford in England.
To determine whom to endorse for the
Rhodes Scholarship, Stanford has a process
which Bechtel International Center oversees.
An internal Stanford committee composed of
faculty and former Rhodes and Marshall Schol
ars interviews candidates who are recommend
ed by faculty members. This committee evalu
ates potential Stanford applicants and sends let
ters to the Rhodes Trust supporting the candi
dates they choose to endorse,
"I am delighted for the students," said John
Pearson, director of Bechtel.
According to Pearson, around 35 to 40 stu
dents seek endorsement from the University
each year for either the Rhodes or Marshall
Scholarship. He said this number has stayed con
stant over time, and noted there is no quota for
how many students the internal committee can
endorse,
Pearson said a factor that has contributed to
the high number of University winners is "the re
markable possibilities of engagement with sen-

ior faculty for research and teaching
that are offered to the undergradu
ate population." He also empha
sized the involvement of former
Rhodes Scholars in the process, not
ing that prior Stanford winners
have used their experience to help
current candidates.
Seldon, who became the first Ti
betan-American Rhodes scholar,
also cited the involvement of the
Stanford community.
"My professors and Stanford ad
ministrators were invaluable in this
process," Seldon said. "Although at
first I wavered in applying, my pro
fessors believed in me and told me I
was ready for this."
In particular, Seldon lauded the
assistance of both Pearson and
Diane Murk, manager of the Over
seas Resource Center. She noted
that they nurtured her to think
about her role as a leader and were
both supportive throughout the
process.
Seldon said the best piece of ad
vice she received was from the men
tor Stanford paired her with, 2007
Rhodes Scholar Julie Veroff 'O7. Ac
cording to Seldon, Veroff coun
seled, "Do not let anybody influ
ence who you authentically are.
They are not always looking for the
most charismatic leader, and in the
process of trying to be what you
think they want, people lose their
true voice."
Seldon, an emerging leader of the
Tibetan diaspora who served as a re
gional coordinator of Students for a

Free Tibet, said that throughout her
Rhodes interviews which were
focused on international policies
and ethical dilemmas she always
stayed true to her authentic self.
"That was something I never
lost," she said.
Seldon, who will study refugee
and forced migration studies at Ox
ford, said that "in a time of turmoil
around the world including Tibet, I
hope that this achievement can
bring about a lessening of suffering
and a smile to the 6 million people
of the Tibetan diaspora and
refugees around the world."
Nath, who worked as an intern at
the Office of Economic Policy at the
White Flouse and as a consultant to
the Department of Energy, noted
that he hopes his future will also in
volve government service but as
an economist.
"It would certainly be a dream
come true to follow in the footsteps
of some of President Obama's eco
nomic advisers," Nath said.
A former political columnist for
The Daily, Nath said that "winning
the Rhodes Scholarship is such a
team effort."
Nath said he is appreciative of
the support that Stanford provided
in the application process, adding
that the advice he received from
Pearson was instrumental in help
ing him figure out which parts of
himself and his passions to present.
"This scholarship is, more than
anything else, a statement about
what is expected from you in the fu

ture," Nath said. "There's definitely
a sense of responsibility to use this
scholarship to the fullest not just in
pursuit of my own goals, but also to
make an impact on the broader is
sues I hope to work on."
Habib, who will study public poli
cy and medical anthropology at Ox
ford, noted that he felt fortunate to
have had the opportunity to study at
Stanford, where so many resources
are available. He said students
should "explore all [of their] options
at Stanford, and be thankful for all
the individuals ready to support you
whatever you choose to do."
Currently working in a commu
nity health program in Haiti,
Habib said the key to success is to
"be both your toughest critic and
your greatest cheerleader." He
pointed out that he has received
more rejections than acceptances
and advised students not to be
afraid of failure.
"Thinking about being one of 32
Americans named Rhodes Scholar
still gives me chills," Habib added.
Niehaus, whose work focuses on
biomechanics and its application to
high technology entrepreneurship,
said she would like to either be a
professor or lead a company one
day using either profession to
make advancements in the field of
medicine.
A former captain of Stanford's
varsity track and cross-country
teams, Niehaus won the Pac-10
5,000 meters and was named an
Academic Ail-American. She said

that she learned through track that
she only performs her best when

said. "I think that Stanford's ap
