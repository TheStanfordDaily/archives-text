## Micro-finance CEO Scofield talks social-e 
### CATHERINE ZAW 
President and CEO of FINCA Interna
tional Rupert Scofield shared insights on so
cial entrepreneurship Tuesday in a speech as
part of a series of events hosted by the Grad
uate School of Business's Public Manage
ment Program.
Scofield discussed the complexity of scal
ing social enterprises, the competitive land
scape for social entrepreneurs and the future
for micro-finance. Using his experience with
FINCA International as an example,
Scofield offered advice on how to be success
ful.
FINCA International is a nonprofit
micro-financing institution that is based in
Washington D.C. and operates in 21 coun
tries. According to its website, the organiza

tion's goal is "to provide financial services to
the world's lowest-income entrepreneurs, so
they can create jobs, build assets and im
prove their standard of living."
"Don't worry if your enterprise is small
and not visible," Scofield said. "If you keep
doing the right thing, you will attract the
right people to you."
Scofield said that there is still "untapped
potential [in] social business," giving exam
ples such as corporate shareholders de
manding increased accountability for con
cerns other than greater financial profits, top
universities launching social entrepreneur
ship programs and billionaires like Bill
Gates and Warren Buffett pledging to give
away half of their fortunes to promising new
charitable ideas, as they announced last year.
"Leave a little room in your life for

magic," Scofield added, referring to his own
personal story.
Scofield said he discovered his passion
for social entrepreneurship by chance when
he offset his military draft to Vietnam to
work in Guatemala with the Peace Corps. In
Guatemala, he said he saw for the first time
how a small amount of capital could have a
huge impact relative to its size.
Later in life, after not being immediately
hired after graduate school, he said he came
across a flyer that eventually sent him to
work in the Dominican Republic with a
co-worker who would eventually co-found
FINCA with him.
"If I had gotten the jobs I had applied for,
I would have been working for the necessity.
rather than for my passion," Scofield
said.
The audience, mainly composed
of those interested in pursuing social
entrepreneurship, reacted positively
to the talk. Several commented that
they found Scofield inspiring and
personally relatable, Others in the
audience referenced having read
Scofield's recently published book,
"The Social Entrepreneur's Hand
book: How to Start, Build and Run a
Business that Improves the World."
"I wanted to know if money was
better invested in micro-financing,"
said Mira Gillet, an audience mem
ber who identified herself as an em
ployee of World Vision, an evangeli
cal relief and development organiza
tion that sponsors children in devel
oping countries through dollar-a
day donations.
"I was impressed at his successes
despite all the corruption in the
field," she added.
Scofield addressed this as part of
his closing remarks.
"If all social enterprises were so
cial enterprises not just in name but
also in action, we could have the
world we wanted," he said. "As an in
dividual, we may not have the re
sources to make an impact, but as an
industry, we do."
