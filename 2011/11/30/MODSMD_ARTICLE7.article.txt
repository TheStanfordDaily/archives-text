## Mental health stigma abates, Vaden says 
### JUDITH SHANIKA PELPOLA 
Administrators at the Vaden Health Center said
there has been a steady increase in the amount of stu
dents using Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) and other similar services offered by the
University, which they attribute to a decreasing
stigmatization toward mental health on campus.
They said this trend is positive, and that they hope
to expand student access to the services, but also ac
knowledged that the issue of mental health might be
stressed amongst Stanford students in the wrong way.
"I think we overpathologize, constantly sending
messages here to students about how stressed they
are, how they lack resiliency and how they have un
balanced lives," said Carole Pertofsky, the director of
wellness and health promotion services at the Vaden
Health Center. "I think a piece of that is true. I don't
think all of that is true."
Professor William Damon of the Stanford School
of Education cited having a sense of purpose as the
key to maintaining mental health in college students
in an article in the Palo Alto Weekly. He said his re
search has indicated that most incoming students
lack such a sense, causing them to become stressed
out.
Pertofsky agreed.
"Meaning comes from who am I, what is my inner
world about and how do I craft a life based on that?"
she said. "It changes; it shifts."
Ron Albucher, director of CAPS, said it might be
harder for students to find their sense of purpose
today because "there are entire fields of study that
didn't exist a generation ago. All of
this adds complexity and can be con
fusing and at times overwhelming."
This could increase the amount of
stress faced by college students of
today, he said.
A sense of purpose, according to
Albucher, must not be heavily influ
enced by what others want for the
student, but instead come from a stu
dent's own discovery of their pas
sions and interests.
"It must come from within," he
said. "That whole developmental
process is important for this age
range."
He cited societal focus on
achievements and accomplishments
over resiliency as playing a role in the
stress of college students. According
to Albucher, resiliency is key to
maintaining mental health.
"That can start as early as pre
school, basically teaching people that
failure is a part of growth," Albucher
said. He added that this would allow
students to cope with achieving less
than expected.
Pertofsky also cited parental
stress particularly in goal-setting
for most students as a major fac
tor in students' stress. She said, if any
thing, this has only increased with the
growing use of technology to con
nect students to home.
The Stanford Duck Syndrome
in which students appear calm on the
surface, but are in reality extremely
stressed seems to play a negative
part in stress on campus as well, but
not the largest part, according to
Vaden administrators.
"I really encourage people to be
honest and open and say, 'This is at
times a really stressful place,' but you
don't need to just sit with that stress,"
Albucher said. "You can get help."
Access to mental health services
is increasing at Stanford, but still has
several issues, according to Vaden
administrators. Albucher, who will
be meeting with a group from the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate to dis
cuss access to services, said that that
the seven satellite clinics of Vaden
were created with this issue in mind,
to open up access to mental health
services.
Albucher cited lack of resources
as one particular issue. He advocates
increasing resources in order to in
crease the amount of help that Vaden
and CAPS can provide to students.
Akshay Gopalan, a counselor at the
Bridge Peer Counseling, encourages
students to use resources such as the
Bridge even if their issues seem
minor.
Both Albucher and Gopalan
cited dorms, along with their corre
sponding RAs, as being a key envi
ronment where students can learn
more about mental health and the
services offered on campus.
"The University should partner
up more with student groups,"
Gopalan said, particularly advocat
ing increased mental health training
for RAs that is focused on role-play
ing.
Charlotte Poplawski, the headTA
for the Pursuit of Happiness course
taught by Pertofsky, said mental
health has gained steam amongst
college students in recent years.
"It's something that's getting
more attention now," Poplawski said.
"People are not as afraid to talk
about it."
