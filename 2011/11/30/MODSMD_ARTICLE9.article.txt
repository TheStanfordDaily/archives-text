## Senate bill fails: 5 in favor, 4 in opposition 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate broke down into tense, heated
discussions at multiple points in
Tuesday evening's meeting. A bill
to admonish several members of
the ASSU may or not have passed
due to an unresolved debate con
cerning the Senate bylaws. Senate
Chair Rafael Vazquez 'l2 an
nounced the measure's failure be
fore the meeting adjourned, but
proponents of the bill argue that
the bill passed with a majority of
voting members.
A bill to admonish
The controversial bill of the
evening, authored by Elections
Commissioner Adam Adler 'l2
sought to admonish ASSU Execu
tive Michael Cruz 'l2, among oth
ers, for not properly executing their
duties. The only Senator who would
be admonished by the bill, Alex
Kindel 'l4 voted in its favor.
The original vote count on the
bill was five in favor, three opposed
and five abstaining, however this
did not add up to the 14 Senators
currently present, and multiple ir
regularities were noted by several
senators.
Stephen Trusheim 'l3, who is not

an ASSU senator and served last
year as Elections Commissioner,
pointed out several flaws in the vot
ing procedure.
Vazquez quieted discussion
loudly and called another vote, this
time resulting in five in favor, four
opposed and five abstaining. The
bill's language stated that it re
quired "a simple majority" from the
voting body to pass. Several Sena
tors argued that the bill did not pass
because the bylaws state that a ma
jority of present Senators is re
quired, as opposed to a majority of
voting members.
However, the bylaws of the Un
dergraduate Senate state: "Unless
otherwise indicated, all votes by the
US (Undergraduate Senate), or a
standing committee thereof, shall
be by a majority of those members
present and voting."
In an interview after the meet
ing, Vazquez initially agreed that ab
stentions were not votes, and ac
cording to this language, the bill
should have passed. Vazquez said
the bill was amended to require a
two-thirds majority before passage.
This proved to be untrue however.
Vazquez later said that an "ab
stain" counts as a vote in the Un
dergraduate Senate. Random
House Dictionary defines an ab
stention as a "withholding of a

vote."
Vazquez said the passage of the
bill does not matter, even to Adler,
and if it did he would look into the
matter more fully. Adler agreed
with this sentiment, saying the ad
monishment already had occurred
by having the vote and introducing
the bill. However Adler said he be
lieves the bill did indeed pass.
"It's not something I'd bring to
the Constitutional Council, but I
am interested in how this turns
out," Adler said.
Leadership Development Program
The Senate also discussed the in
volvement or lack thereof of
Senate Associates in the Leader
ship Development Program
(LDP).
A tense debate occurred an
hour into the meeting when Senate
Deputy Chair Dan Ashton 'l4 gave
an update about the LDP, a pro
gram that assigns each Senator a
freshman to mentor and teach
about ASSU leadership.
Members of the LDP have at
tended one full Senate meeting,
however Senators Dan DeLong

raised concerns about the level of
involvement of the members.
Ashton said that attending Sen
ate meetings was no longer manda
tory because of feedback he re
ceived in surveys from last year's
program, when LDP associates had
to attend meetings.
Ramachandran noted that as a
Senate Associate, she benefited
from attending meetings, which
were mandatory last year.
"With all due respect, I'd like to
counter that," Ashton said. "I read
the surveys, and you were the only
one who responded that going to
committee meetings was benefi
cial."
Senators began to talk over each
other following this comment, with
Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4 twice
saying, "That was awesome," and
Senator Dan Delong asking,
"Aren't those supposed to be confi
dential?"
Senate Chair Rafael Vazquez 'l2
ended discussion on the matter and

told Senators to reach out to their
Senate Associates and encourage
them to be more involved.
Other bills
Several other bills were passed
during the meeting. Ashton au
thored a bill that would authorize a
letter to be disseminated encourag
ing the Stanford University Depart
ment of Public Safety (SUDPS) to
avoid violence when dispersing any
protests on Stanford University.
Nanci Howe, director of Student
Activities and Leadership (SAL),
suggested the bill focus on how stu
dents feel the police should act with
"mutual respect," rather than focus
ing on what actions they want the
police to avoid. The amendment
was accepted by Ashton.
Another bill, authored by
Trusheim, focused on planning a
spring show in Frost Amphitheater.
The bill asked for supplementary
funding from the ASSU "special
buffer fund," which is currently val
ued at $400,000. The bill requested
$35,000 for the event, which is pro
jected to cost over $250,000.
Discussion over this bill will con
tinue at future Senate meetings.
The Senate also passed an addi

tional bill by Adler, which made
slight clarifications to other sections
of the bylaws and approved his
nominations to the Elections Com
mission.
