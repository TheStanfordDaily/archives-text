# Jeremy Weinstein recounts his work at the White House
## PROFILE A
						FOOT IN TWO WORLDS 
### LESLIE NGUYEN-OKWU 
In a well-lit office on the fourth floor of
Encina Hall, Jeremy Weinstein makes his
home among papers stacked tall across
the room. During a recent afternoon, at a
wooden table placed squarely in front of
the door, he sat with his legs crossed and spoke
passionately about his time at the White House,
Jeremy Weinstein has a foot in two worlds,
one at Stanford and one in Washington, D.C.
Here, he is an associate professor of political sci
ence and senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli
Institute for International Studies. But for the
past two years, Weinstein worked under Presi
dent Barack Obama, serving as the director for
development and democracy on the National
Security Council.
In that role, he dealt with several internation
al issues in the interest of the United States, in
cluding global development and democracy,
anti-corruption and foreign assistance reform.
During that time, Weinstein also helped shape
the nation's agenda for global development
through the United States Agency for Interna
tional Development, a government agency that
provides economic and humanitarian assis
tance around the world.
Prior to serving on the National Security
Council, Weinstein's first brush with the White
House came under the Clinton administration,
during which he focused on Africa policy. There,
he developed strong connections and eventual
ly was offered a position as a global develop
ment and democracy advisor for Obama's 2008
presidential campaign.
"I was thrilled," Weinstein said. "I had read
'Dreams from My Father,' and I was convinced
that this guy was something special. So I quick
ly got involved in the campaign and ... ulti
mately took a public service leave from Stan
ford to join the Obama administration."
Weinstein deeply admired Obama's foreign
affairs strategy, adding that it was an approach
that stemmed from Obama's background as a
community organizer. Both he and the Presi
dent agreed that establishing and maintaining
democracy required fostering ties with other
countries based on mutual understanding.
"I think at the core of the president's agenda
on democracy and human rights is recognizing
that sustainable political change comes from the
bottom up," Weinstein said.'Tt can't be imposed
from the outside. You tend not to get the kinds
of outcomes that you're interested in unless you
have that base of support and interest with peo
ple willing to take risks, as we saw in the Arab
Spring in their fight for human rights."
Through his encounters with the president,
Weinstein concluded that advocates outside of
government were key to constructing public
policy. One particular meeting with the presi
dent and a group of human rights activists

struck a chord with Weinstein that continues to
resonate today.
"The president was very powerful in his re
sponse in a number of ways," Weinstein said.
"He said to the groups, 'Your job is to hold my
feet to the fire ... so, you need to be out there
everyday raising these issues, telling us when
we're doing the right or wrong thing. My role is
to be President of the United States, and your
role is to be a strong voice for people who
aren't always heard.' I think that's a powerful
message what produces good policy is not
just the expertise of people inside the govern
ment, but the pressure that comes from out
side."
Weinstein's political background in his ca
reer outside of government spans years of pub
lic policy research and experience and also
draws upon his desire to effect change on a
global scale.
"In a big picture sense, I've always been a so
cial scientist," Weinstein said."l believe that [so
cial science] provides powerful tools to help us
understand fundamental processes of political
and economical change. There's no place like
the West Wing of the White House to have an

idea... and be in a position to call on any coun
try, any organization, any business, any group of
advocates and convene them around doing
something [about it]."
For students aspiring to work in govern
ment, Weinstein strongly advised traveling
abroad as away to gain first-hand experience
with problems resulting from different histories,
cultures and political environments.
"Get out of the United States," Weinstein
said. "It's really important to experience these
issues in places where their salience is high and
understand them from the perspectives of peo
ple who are fighting every day for human rights
and challenging their governments. You can't
learn that from a textbook."
Weinstein also encouraged depth of knowl
edge, rather than breadth. The policymakers he
most admires are the specialists. Thorough ex
pertise with a specific issue, he said, allows poli
cymakers to be more creative in their area of in
terest.
"Don't spread yourself too thin," Weinstein
added. "Know something about something.
There are a lot of generalists in Washington, but
some of the most effective policy players that

I've met are people who are deeply invested in
accumulating knowledge and expertise about
something like global poverty reduction or
whatever it might be,"
Weinstein's White House experiences have
left an indelible mark on his views about the in
ternational role of the U.S. government. In We
instein's opinion, many people see the govern
ment as an obstacle to human rights advance
ment. However, he hopes to instill in the next
generation of political leaders the notion that
government can be an effective means of large
scale progress.
"I think it's increasingly easy to write off gov
ernment as behemoth and bureaucratic and
slow and broken... but the U.S. government is
a massive player and what it does matters enor
mously all around the world," Weinstein said.
"We need the best people going into govern
ment. [Students] need to see the political
process, despite its dysfunction, as a process that
can generate good outcomes and make a differ
ence throughout the world."
