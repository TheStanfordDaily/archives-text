## DO's AND DOO-DOO's You remind me of home... 
### Chase Ishii 
There's a line in the coming-of
age indie-flick Garden State
when Zach Braffs character
says, "You know that point in your
life when you realize the house you
grew up in isn't really your home any
more? All of a sudden, even though
you have some place where you put
your shit, that idea of home is gone..
. You feel like you can never get it
back. It's like you feel homesick for a
place that doesn't even exist." That
brings me to this week's advice:
DO: Be Grateful.
DOO-DOO: Be Homeless.
I'm not sure if it was a life-imi
tates-art-imitates-life sort of thing,
but my first two years of college were
pervaded by a strange sense of not
homesickness, but homelessness and
restlessness. Stanford was my new
life, but I wasn't about to call it home.
And when I would return home for
breaks, home just felt like a house
where I kept the things from my past
life. It was like my life was placed on
pause, nothing I did at home would
contribute to "the bigger picture."
There were no feelings of conse
quence or progress.
This led to a great deal of restless
ness and discontent. When I was at
Stanford, I just wanted to be in Or
ange County, and when I was there, I
wanted to be anywhere but there. I
was stuck living in the past bliss of
nostalgia or the future hope of a
place to call "home."
Over the last two years, my con
cept of "home" has drastically
changed and it has allowed me to
be truly happy where I'm at in the
present. The sense of security and be
longing we call home isn't a place we
find or discover or reach in the dis
tant future, it's a feeling we create
here and now, where we are with the
people around us. Thanksgiving
break was the perfect reminder for
me. There are times when we all feel
lonely and lost in the world, and I've
found that the best remedy is grati
tude true appreciation for the
people that have shaped our lives. It
may help to sit down and remind
yourself where you belong and what
you call home.
For me, home is Clint having the
Deathly Hollows tattooed on his
calf forever, and Lauren knowing
"I'll be at your house in 15," means
"I'll be at your house in an hour." It's
David still saying,"Yo Yo Yo!" upon
entering every room, and Colton
still insisting that his virtual girl
friend exists (well then, how come
we've never met her?). Home is how
it somehow makes sense that Matt

got disqualified from a pancake-eat
ing contest... for eating too many
pancakes.
Home is the way Brett still has an
unshakable faith in the 18-year-old
Green Van, and the way Hilary cares
less about the Cal-Stanford rivalry
than even I do. It's how Greg had the
hardest year of his life and still
strengthens the people around him.
And how Nick and I spent the winter
writing songs about getting better
(and if we're being honest, we're get
ting there.) It's Doug having the dumb
idea of biking to Berkeley from LA
for no reason at all, and Sunny having
the genius idea of secretly following
him to film how far he actually goes
(he'll probably make it.)
Home is Landon performing the
sickest cover of "Skinny Love" I have
ever seen (in the deepest V-neck I
have ever seen). It's Jill knowing
some things never do change. It's how
Coleman used to get teased for being
straight-edge and now gets teased for
not being straight-edge, and how
Michael still won't let me ride his
horse (this is a 100 percent literal and
should not be taken figuratively in
any way). It's how Garrett will go
down in history as the funniest, nicest
and most agreeable person ever (a
narrow finish over Will, who used to
be Bill in high school), and how Clark
knows more about more things than
you do (but seriously, he does).
Home is how Arya knows any
thing I write here wouldn't do him
justice and that Carson still is... and
will forever be ... Carson. It's how
Hayden is going to be super famous
some day, and it won't change a thing.
It's how we're all counting down the
days until lan, Sam, Taylor, Lauren
and Sarah come back to us in Ameri
ca (aka Amurrricccaaaaa!).
No doubt, home is something dif
ferent for each of you. But there's a
strange confidence and joy in life
when you remember you always
have a home to return to, no matter
where you go. And better yet, you can
create one right where you are.

If you're trying to find a new home, meet
ing Chase might be a great place to start.

nostalgia or the future hope of a
place to call "home."
Over the last two years, my con
cept of "home" has drastically
changed and it has allowed me to
be truly happy where I'm at in the
present. The sense of security and be
longing we call home isn't a place we
find or discover or reach in the dis
tant future, it's a feeling we create
here and now, where we are with the
people around us. Thanksgiving
break was the perfect reminder for
me. There are times when we all feel
lonely and lost in the world, and I've
found that the best remedy is grati
tude true appreciation for the
people that have shaped our lives. It
may help to sit down and remind
yourself where you belong and what
you call home.
For me, home is Clint having the
Deathly Hollows tattooed on his
calf forever, and Lauren knowing
"I'll be at your house in 15," means
"I'll be at your house in an hour." It's
David still saying,"Yo Yo Yo!" upon
entering every room, and Colton
still insisting that his virtual girl
friend exists (well then, how come
we've never met her?). Home is how
it somehow makes sense that Matt

got disqualified from a pancake-eat
ing contest... for eating too many
pancakes.
Home is the way Brett still has an
unshakable faith in the 18-year-old
Green Van, and the way Hilary cares
less about the Cal-Stanford rivalry
than even I do. It's how Greg had the
hardest year of his life and still
strengthens the people around him.
And how Nick and I spent the winter
writing songs about getting better
(and if we're being honest, we're get
ting there.) It's Doug having the dumb
idea of biking to Berkeley from LA
for no reason at all, and Sunny having
the genius idea of secretly following
him to film how far he actually goes
(he'll probably make it.)
Home is Landon performing the
sickest cover of "Skinny Love" I have
ever seen (in the deepest V-neck I
have ever seen). It's Jill knowing
some things never do change. It's how
Coleman used to get teased for being
straight-edge and now gets teased for
not being straight-edge, and how
Michael still won't let me ride his
horse (this is a 100 percent literal and
should not be taken figuratively in
any way). It's how Garrett will go
down in history as the funniest, nicest
and most agreeable person ever (a
narrow finish over Will, who used to
be Bill in high school), and how Clark
knows more about more things than
you do (but seriously, he does).
Home is how Arya knows any
thing I write here wouldn't do him
justice and that Carson still is... and
will forever be ... Carson. It's how
Hayden is going to be super famous
some day, and it won't change a thing.
It's how we're all counting down the
days until lan, Sam, Taylor, Lauren
and Sarah come back to us in Ameri
ca (aka Amurrricccaaaaa!).
No doubt, home is something dif
ferent for each of you. But there's a
strange confidence and joy in life
when you remember you always
have a home to return to, no matter
where you go. And better yet, you can
create one right where you are.

If you're trying to find a new home, meet
ing Chase might be a great place to start.
