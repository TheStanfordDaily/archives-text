# STUDENTS REFLECT ON OCCUPY
## Occupy the Future: Widening the gap in education quality since 1995 
### GERALD HANONO '12 
Chula Vista, my hometown,
has the largest elementary
school district in California,
with 46 schools that serve the
city's 230,000 residents. Having
such a large school district poses
an interesting set of problems, pri
marily dealing with the quality of
education that exists across the
economically diverse city. The
East has the newest homes, the
newest schools and the wealthiest
families, while the West tends to
be poorer, have older facilities
and generally lag behind in the
"Academic Performance Index"
(API), which the state of Califor
nia uses to measure scholastic
achievement from second to 11th
grade. I guess it makes sense (al
though it may not be proper):
studies have long shown a corre
lation between wealth and
scholastic achievement. Howev
er, there is something a bit more
unsettling happening in Chula
Vista.
East Lake, the second-largest
subdivision and possibly the
wealthiest and most successful,
having won San Diego's "Best
Community" award 11 years
straight —on the East side of
Chula Vista has its own educa
tional foundation. The East Lake
Educational Foundation was es
tablished in 1995 and serves the
subdivision's four elementary
schools, one middle school and
one high school. Geared toward
grants for technology, the founda-

tion states that it funds "programs
that are either poorly funded
through traditional means or
have no existing funding base
through the public school dis
tricts." Which is to say that it has
provided over 1 million dollars in
supplemental aid to precisely the
same programs that no other stu
dents at the 42 other elementary
schools, nine other middle schools
and nine other high schools have
access to.
That's not all though: the ini
tial endowment for the founda
tion was created by the East Lake
Corporation, the entity that de
veloped the community. Maybe it
shouldn't be surprising that the
development that set up private
governments for its own residents
to administer its pools and parks
(as city parks and pools saw se
vere budget cuts or were closed)
also created a privatized school
fund to supplement the dwindling
state budget for education. Mar
keting ploy or not, the East Lake

Corporation greatly reinforced
the economic inequality that geo
graphically maps the city and ex
acerbated it by impacting the
youth that will make up our fu
ture generations.
I have been asked if there
would be away to make the EEF
contribute to the other schools in
the district. Perhaps they should,
but coming to a philosophical de
cision on whether the East Lake
Educational Foundation (and
other organizations like it) should
be mandated to spread the wealth
steps beyond the heart of the
issue. The system is broken: privi
lege builds upon and serves itself,
congratulating itself and basking
in its wealth as the disenfran
chised continue to go without,
falling further and further behind.
Thus I cannot accept the exis
tence of this foundation and oth
ers like it. From the realization
that a child's education needs
supplemental funding, under
standing that other children at
other schools in the same district
are also lacking should follow.
Rather than retreating from the
public sphere or using their
wealth for subsidy, the privileged
few should exercise their agency
and work to create an education
system that brings an appropriate
level of public funding to students
of all socioeconomic back
grounds.
