# DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF
## Stuck in a rut 
### Leslie Brian 
Let's be honest: there's a 60-
year-old trapped inside my 21-
year-old body. In my perfect
world, I'd be in bed by 11 p.m. every
night, nursing a cup of Yogi tea while
penning in the answers to the daily
crossword. People now respond with
"typical" when I just laugh at the
suggestion of throwing back a few
shots and raging at a frat party. My
procrastination websites of choice
are not Reddit or Perez Hilton, but
rather lumosity.com brain training (I
swear by it!) or Heidi Swanson's veg
etarian food blog, lOlcookbooks. I
still don't understand You Tube. I can
(and do) spend hours on end playing
board games. I'm the kind of person
who looks at a menu for 15 minutes,
asks the waiter an average of three
questions and then settles on the
same thing I always order.
In short, I am a creature of habit.
But aren't we all? Routine, tradition,
schedule: it's so much easier to choose
the comfortable inertia of what's fa
miliar over the uncertainty that
comes from a gamble. When I know I
can enjoy a lovely evening by myself
watching the latest episode of Top
Chef, why would I go through the has
sle of picking up the phone, calling my
friends and trying to figure out their
plans for the night when those plans
may very well fall through and leave
me in the lurch? In short, it's a much
"safer," "easier" option to accept the
guaranteed payoff of Top Chef) rather
than venture into the territory of an
uncertain outcome.
Here's the irony, though (if I'm
using that word correctly). I know
I'm my happiest, best self when I de
viate from what is routine.
My comfortable status quo tends
to be solitude. Frankly, though, peo
ple annoy me sometimes. Put me in a
big group of people trying to decide
what to do and I literally go crazy.
We'll spend hours spinning our
wheels, talking in circles, stewing
over where to go, what to do, what to

eat, etc. The Stanford student in me
cringes at the inefficiency. And for
that matter, it's frustrating to wait on
people to make up their minds only
to cancel last minute. In my mind, it's
much better to avoid that whole rig
marole by doing things alone.
But even though I enjoy my alone
time, it's also my emotional crutch.
As I learned from living alone in
Paris over the summer, too much
solitude is never good for anyone.
Yet even though I know I need peo
ple, I still struggle to reach out.
That's not everyone's rut. One
person's rut can be another person's
adventure. But we all have our vari
ations on the general theme, and
only we know exactly what it takes to
break out of our comfort zones.
Regardless of what your routine is,
deviating from the norm will always
require taking a risk. And, unfortu
nately, that lands you smack dab in the
middle of uncertainty, a no-man's land
where no one feels particularly com
fortable. Taking a risk could generate
a potential failure, and, after all, don't
we like what we're good at? So, we
revert to the comfort of sitting on the
couch, watching a movie instead of
getting out and about, exploring all
that life has to offer.
Every day can be an adventure.
That's one thing travel has taught
me. Being in a new city for a limited
amount of time makes you start to
milk every second of every day for
what it's worth. You'll run yourself
ragged going from museum to muse
um, or from landmark to landmark.
But how many of us have taken the
time to explore what our own home
town or campus has to offer? It's not
that there's nothing to do. By virtue
of going to Stanford, we all get
10,000 different emails from 10,000
different groups every day advertis
ing all sorts of cool and exciting
events on campus! And if that wasn't
enough, San Francisco's golden aura
beckons us from the horizon. But

even though I'm well apprised of all
the current goings on in the city, life's
daily grind will most likely always
trump my grand aspirations of ad
venture.
But life doesn't have to be boring
if you choose for it to not be.There are
so many opportunities to do some
thing different or fun in every mo
ment. From exhibits to see, mountain
paths to travel, sports to try, hobbies
to rekindle, new people to meet, old
friends to have coffee with, different
food to try adventure is yours to
create. It doesn't have to be a big to
do if you don't want it to be. Some
times, it's enough to strike up a con
versation with the grocery store
cashier or run a different route
around campus. But it does require
that you put forth the effort and take
a risk, allowing yourself the freedom
to try... and sometimes fail!

Its so much easier
to choose the
comfortable inertia of
what's familiar over the
uncertainty that
comes from agamble.
