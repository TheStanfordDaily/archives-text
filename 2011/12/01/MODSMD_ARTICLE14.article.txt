## Pac-12 just got a lot more fun 
### Jack Blanchat 
Which do you like
better, Christmas
or Coaching
Carousel Season?
Luckily, one is al
ready in full swing and the other is
right around the corner, but I love me
some hirings and firings more than
just about anything in the world. Col
lege football fans are so dedicated and
ravenous that there is no greater joy in
their lives than having a bad coach
fired and getting a brand new addition
to their family thanks to several mil
lion dollars and three courtesy cars.
But the best news about new
coaches in new places is that they can
totally change the framework of how
an entire conference works. That kind
of wackiness is exactly what I love so
much about the Pac-12's two newest
family members Washington State
hiring Mike Leach and Arizona hiring
Rich Rodriguez is about to make the
Pac-12 a whole lot more fun.
First of all, Leach and Rodriguez
will bring two explosive offensive
minds into the conference, and that's
an exciting prospect. The Pac-12 al
ready has five of the nation's top 25 of
fenses and two of the top 10 (Ore
gon and Stanford) so just imagine
what it will be like to have Leach and
Rodriguez added to that mix.
Rodriguez was the guy who turned
West Virginia into a two-time BCS
bowl winner by finding guys like Steve
Slaton, Pat White and Noel Devine,
and Leach's Texas Tech quarterbacks
routinely threw for more than 5,000
yards a year. When you add them to
the conference's already potent offen
sive minds, I get excited just thinking
about it.
Can you imagine the box scores
that look like something out of
NCAA 'l2? Can you see the scores
that look like they came from a bas
ketball game instead? The Pac-12 will
be like the Anti-SEC!
But secondly, and more important
ly, Rodriguez and Leach will bring
their two unique (and somewhat
bizarre) personalities to the confer
ence something that should be sig
nificantly more exciting for the fans
than the imminent offensive explo
sion.
Simply put, there is no better thing
for any football team than a coach
who loves to stir the pot and talk trash.
For example, a Stanford fan's mind
should turn directly to former head
coach Jim Harbaugh, who not only
took the Cardinal from an also-ran to
one of the baddest teams in the coun
try, but shook up conference su
premacy by bad-mouthing USC and
getting into a tiff with Trojan head
coach Pete Carroll. How much better
did that make the conference? Infi
nitely better. Immeasurably better.
The same thing is true in the NFL
Jets head coach Rex Ryan has made
the entire league more fun to watch
by always running his mouth about
anybody and everybody. So getting
Rodriguez and Leach into the Pac-12
in one hiring season is like hitting the
jackpot.
For example, Rodriguez LOVES
to cry during press conferences, and
that could make for some entertain
ing and awkward moments during
Pac-12 media days. But Leach will
bring a new level of weirdness to the
conference that has never been seen
before.
He's obsessed with the history of
pirates because he thinks pirates
would make great football players.
"Pirates function as a team,"
Leach once said. "There were a lot of
castes and classes in England at the
time. But with pirates, it didn't matter
if you were black, white, rich or poor.
The object was to get a treasure. If the
captain did a bad job, you could just
overthrow him."
He once said his Texas Tech team

lost to Texas A&M because, "As
coaches, we failed to make our coach
ing points more compelling to the
players than their fat little girlfriends."
He once dispensed dating advice
to a Texas Tech freshman by telling
the starry-eyed youngster to take a
girl on a date to a steakhouse be
cause the girl will be forced to eat in
front of you, which girls hate to do, so
they will have to "conversate and
show their true self."
Sometimes you can't make this
stuff up but isn't that much better
than a coach who does nothing but
dispense cliches?
So get excited, Pac-12 football fans
I know I am for a new era of
quirky quotes and nonstop offense,
because it's about to take the West
Coast by storm. As long as someone
doesn't get locked inside a storage
shed again, that is.

Jack Blanchat aspires to one day be
both a pirate and a head football
coach, and he doesn't mean working at
Eastern Carolina or Tampa Bay. Send

gerous job options at blanchat@stan
