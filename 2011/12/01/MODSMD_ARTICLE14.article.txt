## Pac-12 just got a lot more fun 
### Jack Blanchat 
Which do you like
better, Christmas
or Coaching
Carousel Season?
Luckily, one is al
ready in full swing and the other is
right around the corner, but I love me
some hirings and firings more than
just about anything in the world. Col
lege football fans are so dedicated and
ravenous that there is no greater joy in
their lives than having a bad coach
fired and getting a brand new addition
to their family thanks to several mil
lion dollars and three courtesy cars.
But the best news about new
coaches in new places is that they can
totally change the framework of how
an entire conference works. That kind
of wackiness is exactly what I love so
much about the Pac-12's two newest
family members Washington State
hiring Mike Leach and Arizona hiring
Rich Rodriguez is about to make the
Pac-12 a whole lot more fun.
First of all, Leach and Rodriguez
will bring two explosive offensive
minds into the conference, and that's
an exciting prospect. The Pac-12 al
ready has five of the nation's top 25 of
fenses and two of the top 10 (Ore
gon and Stanford) so just imagine
what it will be like to have Leach and
Rodriguez added to that mix.
Rodriguez was the guy who turned
West Virginia into a two-time BCS
bowl winner by finding guys like Steve
Slaton, Pat White and Noel Devine,
and Leach's Texas Tech quarterbacks
routinely threw for more than 5,000
yards a year. When you add them to
the conference's already potent offen
sive minds, I get excited just thinking
about it.
Can you imagine the box scores
that look like something out of
NCAA 'l2? Can you see the scores
that look like they came from a bas
ketball game instead? The Pac-12 will
be like the Anti-SEC!
But secondly, and more important
ly, Rodriguez and Leach will bring
their two unique (and somewhat
bizarre) personalities to the confer
ence something that should be sig
nificantly more exciting for the fans
than the imminent offensive explo
sion.
Simply put, there is no better thing
for any football team than a coach
who loves to stir the pot and talk trash.
For example, a Stanford fan's mind
should turn directly to former head
coach Jim Harbaugh, who not only
took the Cardinal from an also-ran to
one of the baddest teams in the coun
try, but shook up conference su
premacy by bad-mouthing USC and
getting into a tiff with Trojan head
coach Pete Carroll. How much better
did that make the conference? Infi
nitely better. Immeasurably better.
The same thing is true in the NFL
