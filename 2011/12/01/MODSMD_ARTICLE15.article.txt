## Defensive assistant McGlockton dead 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Chester McGlockton, a defensive assistant
for the Stanford football team, passed away last
night in his sleep due to an apparent heart attack.
He was 42.

McGlockton, a four-time NFL pro bowler,
was in just his second season coaching for the
Cardinal, seven years after retiring from the
New York Jets.
"Everyone in the Stanford Football family is
deeply saddened by the passing of Chester Mc-
Glockton," head coach David Shaw said in a
statement on Wednesday. "For the past two sea
sons, Chester has been a valuable member of our
football staff and a wonderful friend to us all.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to Chester's
wife Zina and their two children."

McGlockton was a former all-ACC defensive
tackle at Clemson and was a first round pick of
the Los Angeles Raiders in 1992. He played in
the NFL for 12 seasons with the Raiders, Chiefs,
Broncos and Jets.
San Francisco 49ers head coach Jim Har
baugh, who brought McGlockton on to his
coaching staff last season, weighed in on his for
mer assistant's passing.
"Chester has been a very close and dear
friend over the past four years," Harbaugh told
the San Jose Mercury. "He was part of our team
here and at Stanford. It's a shock and just sad, sad
with his passing."
"I want people to know Chester was a good
guy doing the right thing and helping a lot of
people. To say he was coming into his own as a
coach would be understating it," Harbaugh con
tinued. "He'd already blossomed. He was so pos
itive with other coaches and players."
The untimely passing of McGlockton
brought an outpouring of support from current
Cardinal players as well, who took to Twitter to
remember the assistant coach.
"Prayers go out to the family of Coach
Chester. He taught me so much," wrote fresh
man linebacker James Vaughters.
"Speechless ... lost much more than a coach
today. Please pray for Chester and the McGlock
ton family," tweeted redshirt freshman line
backer AJ Tarpley.
"We lost a brother today who made us all bet
ter. He challenged me personally to be a better
man," wrote offensive assistant coach Mike San
ford, who joined McGlockton as a member of
the Cardinal coaching staff two seasons ago.
McGlockton is survived by his wife, Zina, and
his two daughters. Funeral arrangements have
not yet been made.
