# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Title hopes washed again 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 2011 season ended on a bit
ter note for the No. 4 men's water
polo team this past weekend in
Los Angeles, marked by another
top squad's unsuccessful cam
paign to bring a national champi
onship home to the Farm.
Stanford ended the season at
19-7 overall and 5-3 in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF). The team finished fourth
in the MPSF regular season stand
ings and also took fourth in the
MPSF Tournament, behind No. 2
UCLA (23-4, 6-2 MPSF), No. 1
USC (22-3,8-0) and No. 3 Califor
nia (20-3,7-1). (At the time of pro
duction, the most recent NCAA
rankings, released on Nov. 23, re
flected USC as the No. 1 team. It is
likely that No. 1 USC and No. 2
UCLA will switch positions to re
flect UCLA's victory in the MPSF
Tournament.)
The Cardinal ended its season
with three losses in the span of a
week, two of them at the hands of
rival California and the other to
USC in a game that ended Stan
ford's hopes for the conference
tournament and national title.The
rough ending, however, should not
take away from an otherwise solid
season.
"It was a good season," said
junior driver Paul Rudolph, "even

though we ended with three bad
losses."
The biggest highlight of the
season was winning the SoCal
Tournament in early October,
something Stanford had not done
since 2002. In the course of that
tournament, the Cardinal defeat
ed both USC and California. That
weekend "we proved that we
could play with anyone," Rudolph
said. Looking back, redshirt soph
omore goalie Hunter Ploch noted,
"The second day of SoCals was
definitely the biggest day of the
season."
Ploch will be taking center
stage this offseason alongside fel
low redshirt sophomore goalie
Scott Platshon. One of those two
will have to step up next year to
replace redshirt senior goalie
Brian Pingree, who has been the
starter for the past two seasons
and was named honorable men
tion All-MPSF this year.
"It's always hard losing a senior
goalie," Rudolph said when talk
ing about next season.
Two players the Cardinal will
not have to worry about replacing
are freshman utility Alex Bo wen
and redshirt sophomore 2-meter
Forrest Watkins.
"I am really exited about next
year," said Platshon with regards
to the teams' outlook. "Both our
top offensive and top defensive
players in Alex and Forrest are re

turning."
Bowen and Watkins were the
stars of the 2011 team. Bowen, a
true freshman, led the team with
2.41 goals per game, which was
good enough for third in the
MPSF. He finished the year with
52 goals.
Bowen has "surprised every
one," said coach John Vargas earli
er in the season. Rudolph added
that it is "almost unheard of" for a
freshman to have that type of
goal-scoring season. His statistics
this season were so special that he
was named MPSF Newcomer of
the Year in addition to being
named to the All-MPSF First
Team. There is still a great upside
for Bowen, though, as he will be
looked at to improve on his de
fense in the offseason.
Watkins, on the other hand, has
as complete a game as anyone
could ask for. Not only is he the
team's best 2-meter defender, he
was also tied for second on the
team in scoring this season.
Watkins has also been honored
with an All-MPSF First Team se
lection for his outstanding season.
"He is our backbone," Vargas
said. "We go as he goes."
Within the first weeks of the
season, Watkins had already
eclipsed his season total of seven
goals from last year. He finished
