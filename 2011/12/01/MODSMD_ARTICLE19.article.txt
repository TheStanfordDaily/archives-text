# AGGIES EASILY AXED
## Ogwumikes crush UC-Davis 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team announced its return to
campus after the Thanksgiving
road trip last night with a 93-44
rout of UC-Davis. The Cardinal
only held a lead of three points
halfway through the first period,
but it turned up the heat to put this
game all but out of reach at the
break. Stanford (5-1) began this
game with just one upperclassman
in the starting lineup, senior for
ward Nnemkadi Ogwumike, in
comparison with the three seniors
and two juniors of Davis (6-2), and
the lack of experience seemed to
hamper the Cardinal in the early
going.

The Aggies were more effective
at pressing Stanford on offense
and stole the ball several times
early on to help it drag the game
back to level with 12:31 remaining
in the half. But from 13-13 on
wards, the Card turned its early
problems around and began to
inch back into the lead and then
race ahead to double UC-Davis'
score with 1:23 left and lead 51-23
at the half.
"We came out with tremendous
energy and a lot of confidence," ex
plained Davis head coach Jennifer
Gross of the good first few minutes
by her team. "To start with, we

were playing our defense really
well, and we had really good action
on our offensive side of the ball."

"The last couple of times we've
played at Stanford, we've been in a
very similar position where it can
go one way or the other," Gross
continued. "We really tried to
buckle down, and we tried to get
some stops and some scores, but
unfortunately it went the other
way, and it turned into a 20-point
game."

Nnemkadi Ogwumike looked
impressive the first half, when she
netted 18 points and grabbed nine
rebounds, followed closely by her
sister, sophomore forward Chiney,
who had 20 points and nine re
bounds. But with the game looking
all but won early on, Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer could rest
both the players recently named to
the Naismith Trophy watch list and
give others who don't regularly
start significant playing time.
While some teams might slow
down when their best players
leave the floor, Stanford refused
to do so. Ten of the 11 players who
took to the floor scored points,
and junior forward Joslyn Tinkle
and freshman forward Bonnie
Samuelson both notched career
highs in points. Tinkle played the
