Stanford Residential Education
and the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric co-hosted a panel discus
sion Wednesday night about the past,
present and future of women's
sports.

The event featured notable
women in the sports realm, including
Brandi Chastain, a former member
of the U.S. women's soccer team and
Ellen Estes Lee 'O2, former captain
of the Stanford water polo team and
a former Olympian. Dena Evans '96,
a highly recognized track and field
athlete and coach, and Dr. Joan
Oloff, a podiatrist from Los Gatos,
also spoke.
Kelly Myers, a PWR instructor,
organized the event. Myers said she
was "inspired by a class that [she is]
teaching ... about women in sports."
She believed it would be beneficial to
"talk to women who have reached
the highest level of sport and figure
out where do we go from here,"
The panel provided perspectives
on the past, present and future of
women's sports to an audience of 40,
which was comprised primarily of
students.

The panelists reflected on specific
moments in women's sports that
served as turning points and inspira
tions in their own careers. Some of
the panelists inspired each other.
Oloff referred to Chastain's "sports
bra moment" as a defining moment
in women's sports that has "affected
generations of women athletes."
The panelists discussed the chal
lenges that remain for women's
sports today.
According to Dena Evans, there are
"vast amounts of young girls playing
sports, [yet] there is a struggle to keep
a women's soccer pro league from
going under."

Oloff confirmed that a current
challenge for women's sports is that
"youth sports have come leaps and
bounds but professionally, there is a
strange disconnect."

Chastain discussed the reasons
for why children continue to play
sports today. She discouraged the no
tion that children should specialize in
a given sport for the purpose of earn
ing scholarships.
"Kids today are not having a
chance to truly experience sports be
cause people are telling them, 'You
can only do one,"' she said.
Although the panelists reflected
on some of the negative aspects of
women's sports today, they were
hopeful for its future.
"A professional league exists be
cause [sports are] just like school,
where you go to learn something
