# WRANGLING IN VEGAS
## Wrestlers head to Cliff Keen Invitational 
### PALANI ESWARAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend the Stanford
wrestling team travels to Las Vegas
for the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Colle
giate Wrestling Invitational. The
tournament starts on Friday, Dec. 2
and finishes on Saturday, Dec, 3.
Stanford has never competed in
the Vegas Invitational, one of the
premier collegiate competitions in
the country, and looks to bring for

ward a strong showing against the
nation's top competition. Numer
ous top-25 teams will be competing,
including Northwestern and Mis
souri, two of the country's best
teams that have already beaten
Stanford.
Other teams to watch this week
end are Stanford's fellow Pac-12
members: Arizona State, Boise
State, Cal State Bakersfield and
Oregon State. Although it is early
in the season, matches against Pac
-12 opponents have special impor
tance because they will determine
seeding in the Pac-12 Tournament
and possibly the NCAA Tourna
ment.

There is no doubt that all eyes
will be on redshirt senior No. 1 Nick

Amuchastegui (174 pounds) and
junior No. 5 Ryan Mango (133
pounds). Both wrestlers are unde
feated this season, and
Amuchastegui and Mango will
both be contenders for not only
All-American honors this season,
but also national championships.
But it's not just Amuchastegui
and Mango who need to send a
message this weekend the entire
team will be looking to show that
they can compete with the best in
the country. The Card has lost three
matches in a row all to ranked
opponents and a successful
weekend in Las Vegas would help
the Cardinal garner national re
spect.
This weekend's measure of suc
cess for Stanford will be how many
wrestlers advance to Saturday. Fri
day will consist first of play-in
matches to place the lower-seeded
competitors into the 32-man brack
et. Following those initial rounds,
the tournament will proceed
through the quarterfinal matches
and two consolation rounds. If a
wrestler makes it to Saturday, there
is a good chance he can place and
earn points for his team.
The Cardinal takes to the mat in
Las Vegas this Friday and Saturday.
