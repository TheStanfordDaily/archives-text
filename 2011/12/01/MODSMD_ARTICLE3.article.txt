### JORDAN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president of
the Children's Defense Fund (CDF), delivered a lec
ture on the meaning of life Wednesday evening in
Memorial Auditorium. As the 2011 Rathbun Visiting
Fellow, Edelman shares an honor previously awarded
to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, former Secretary of
State George Shultz and the Dalai Lama.

The tradition of "Harry's Last Lecture" originated
when law school professor Harry Rathbun deter
mined that he would dedicate the last lecture of his
course every spring quarter to ponder the meaning of
life with students who were about to leave Stanford.
The Foundation for Global Community recently en
dowed the Harry and Emilia Rathbun Fund for Ex
ploring What Leads to a Meaningful Life, a program of

Marian Wright Edelman, the founderand president of the Children's Defense Fund (CDF), spoke on Wednesday
about education, incarceration, nuclear disarmament, poverty, excessive materialism and family values.
the Office for Religious Life.
"Dr. King warned us a long time
ago about excessive materialism and
militarism... and worried that we
were integrating into a burning
house," Edelman said in an interview
with The Daily. "He warned us about
the failure to use our great wealth as
a nation to make sure that every
body had the basic necessities of
life."
With these ideals at heart, Edel
man focused her speech on "the
need to redefine the meaning of suc
cess in America," claiming that the
United States is "off track." She
spoke about education, incarcera
tion, nuclear disarmament, poverty,
excessive materialism and family
values. Edelman presented each of
her concerns to students as lessons of
life she had given to her own chil
dren.
As a young woman growing up in
the south, Edelman learned core val
ues of social responsibility. She be
came the first African American
woman admitted to the Mississippi
Bar and led the Poor People's Cam
paign with Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. These experiences influenced her
decision to create the CDF in 1973.
"Prevention and early interven
tion became the theme [for CDF],"
Edelman said. "And hopefully, I
thought that people wouldn't blame
five-month-old babies for parents
they didn't choose."
Since then, Edelman has written
eight books and received the Presi
dential Medal of Freedom the na
tion's highest civilian honor
among other accomplishments. She
spoke of her struggle to found the
first Head Start program for children
in her community, one of her many
efforts to improve the lives of those
surrounding her.
Edelman discussed the tendency
of impoverished children to end up
in prison, a process that she refers to
as the "Cradle to Prison Pipeline."
"[The United States spends]

three times more per prisoner than
per pupil," Edelman said in her lec
ture. She urged for America to "re
place that pipeline to prison with a
pipeline to college."
When asked to compare the Oc
cupy movement to the Civil Rights
Movement, Edelman praised the
publicity the movement has given to
economic gaps in American society.
She said that "major transformation
is possible if enough people are will
ing to get out of their comfort zones
[and demand change]."
In addition to her lecture in
Memorial Auditorium, Edelman
spent time during her visit speaking
with students. At a discussion with
students who were planning to go
abroad or who had already traveled,
she spoke of the need for young
adults to understand their endeavors
in a global context. She indicated this
perspective could only be obtained
by visiting other countries.
"Don't think you have to win im
mediately or even at all to make a
difference," Edelman warned. "If
you see a need, don't ask,' Why does
n't somebody do something?' ask,
'Why don't I do something?'."
Edelman emphasized the role of
young people in advocating for
change.
"I think that young people need
to find their voice in all of this be
cause so much is at stake for them as
well as for the country, and I'm hop
ing that there will be more campus
based activism," Edelman said.
"Democracy is not a spectator
sport."
