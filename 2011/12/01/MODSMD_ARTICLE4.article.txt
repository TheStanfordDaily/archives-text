## Distance learning successful Method expands access to graduate programs 
### MARIANNE LEVINE DESK EDITOR 
During a Faculty Senate meeting
on Oct. 13, electrical engineering
professor Bernd Girod indicated
that if Stanford's NYC campus pro
posal is approved, the University
will "leverage distance learning and
telepresence technologies exten
sively."

While distance learning between
two campuses may be a new chal
lenge, according to Paul Marca, ex
ecutive director of Stanford's Cen
ter for Professional Development,
Stanford has been engaging in dis
tance learning for the last 40 years.
"We've had a long and rich histo
ry delivering education," Marca
said. "We have delivered television
and internet-based education as
well as face-to-face education."
The Center for Professional De
velopment provides the opportuni
ty for individuals with full-time jobs
to continue their education and en
hance their skill sets. According to
its website, the Center offers over
25 graduate degrees and certifi
cates, as well as 51 master's of sci
ence degree "depths." Thirteen aca
demic departments from the School
of Engineering participate in the
distance learning program. Those
students interested in pursuing
master's degrees must be admitted
by specific departments.
In order to qualify for distance
learning, students must belong to
one of the Center's member compa
nies, listed on the Center's website.
These member companies include
Apple Inc., Hewlett-Packard Com
pany, General Electric, General
Motors and NASA. Marca said the
member companies "understand
the value of a Stanford education."
Member company employees qual
ify as part-time students and are el
igible for tuition discounts.
"We think of Stanford and the
School of Engineering as [deliver
ing] the needs of industry," Marca
said.
He added that an important
benefit of distance learning is the
opportunity for students to directly
apply their education to their pro
fessional lives.
"If companies have specific ini
tiatives, [they] can re-tool employ
ees specifically and do so through
Stanford," Marca said.
Marca indicated that since dis
tance learning students are working
full-time, the amount of time neces
sary to complete a program varies.
Master's degrees are typically com
pleted in between three to five
years, with five years being the
maximum amount of time provid
ed. Because of the part-time nature
of the distance-learning program,
the Center measures its size based
on the number of enrollments as
opposed to the number of actual
students.
Marca emphasized that while
distance learning students are en
rolled part-time, there is no differ
entiation in status between distance
learning students and full-time
Stanford students.
"When we offer extended edu
cation to industry, and the depart
ment admits students, that student
is a graduate student at Stanford;
there is no difference," Marca said.
"They happen to be working at
Intel or Cisco or Hewlett-Packard,
but they are in the courses ... just
not physically on campus."
Marca attributes much of the
distance learning program's success
to the dedication of the Stanford
faculty. Distance learning students
may communicate with and receive
help from faculty through different
forms of technology, including live
meetings and videoconferences.
"Our faculty understands that
there is a distance learning compo
nent of the class," Marca said. "If
they deliver to graduate students at
a distance, [they] understand the
role of responsiveness. That has
benefited students at a distance in a
significant way."
Joyce Rice, director of market
ing at the School of Engineering, in
dicated that the technology devel
oped for distance learning, which
includes taped lectures, has also
benefited full-time students.
"Full-time students at Stanford
appreciate the opportunity to go
online and view lectures of the
courses online," Rice said. "[This]

gives them the opportunity to go
over materials and prepare for
projects."
Some professors at Stanford
have also initiated distance learn
ing classes, outside of the Center for
Professional Development's specif
ic programs. Sebastian Thrun, a
computer science professor, cur
rently offers his "Introduction to
Artificial Intelligence" course on
line for free. The class now has
130,000 enrollments.

"Our class had an amazing suc
cess," Thrun wrote in an email to
The Daily. "We are changing the
lives of people whom we could
never reach before, in places like
Afghanistan [and] Tanzania. We
reached people in over 190 coun
tries."
Thrun emphasized that while
distance learning is "no alternative
to campus life," online courses can
help to "democratize education."
Although distance learning may
raise concerns about the potential
decrease in face-to-face interac
tions, both Thrun and Marca do not
find the decrease problematic.
"Our students consistently re
port a very strong connection to
us," Thrun said. "Many of them feel
as if they are in the same room with
us, as if we listen to them, let them
try and respond to their answers."
Marca believes that for master's
degree programs, face-to-face con
nections may not always be neces
sary. He stated that the only disad
vantage of the Center's master's
degree programs is the limited net
working opportunities for distance
learners.
"We believe the online experi
ence is a great way to get the mas
ter's education out there," Marca
said. "It's a pretty solid program
and a great way to extend Stan
ford's intellectual work to make a
difference in the companies that
engage with us and for those pro
fessionals who wish to take classes."
