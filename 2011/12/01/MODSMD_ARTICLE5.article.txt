## Clubs prepare for 2012 elections Democrats and Republicans on campus begin campaigns 
### EDWARD NGAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With less than a year to go before the 2012
general elections, Stanford's political organiza
tions are shifting their focus to the upcoming
election season.
In the off-year between the 2010 midterm

elections and next year's presidential election,
organizations representing both parties are
working to ignite busy students by planning
voter registration drives, volunteering with
campaigns and hosting meetings to discuss the
issues of the campaign.

"Getting young people involved in politics is
one of the biggest challenges associated with a
big political campaign," said Rahul Sastry 'l3,
vice president of the Stanford Democrats. "For
a candidate like Obama, energizing the student
vote will be a very important aspect in getting
[Obama] re-elected."

"[A] goal is to encourage everyone [at Stan
ford] to become active in politics, as university
students are our country's, and the world's, fu
ture," wrote Mary Ann Toman-Miller 'l4, presi-

dent of the Stanford College Re
publicans, in an email to The Daily.
"We need to act as a voice for our
generation and remind Washington
that our generation does not want
to inherit an unsustainable econo
my."
Toman-Miller is a Daily staffer.
A year away from the election,
however, the Stanford Democrats
still feel challenged by the unique
dynamics of campus organizing.
"I wasn't here in 2008 [for the
last general election], so it was very
interesting ... trying to figure out
how organizing on campus works,"
said Lindsay Lamont 'l3, president
of the Stanford Democrats. "We've
been going about it in a two
pronged [manner], being the liberal
base on campus ... and working
with the Obama for America cam
paign outside the Stanford commu
nity."
Lamont says she understands

the challenges in igniting enthusi
asm on a college campus in a deep
blue state.
"Even if you feel that... Cali
fornia, as a whole, your vote may
not have a voice, it doesn't mean
that you can't have an influence
elsewhere," she said. "If we look to
2008, we [had] a huge influence on
neighboring states."
To increase involvement, both
organizations are beginning to exe
cute their plans for the election year
with the final goal of building mo
mentum and fostering a more polit
ically active atmosphere on cam
pus.
"I am planning to take a delega
tion of Stanford Republicans to the
2012 Republican National Conven
tion in Tampa, Florida," Toman-
Miller said. "I will also take a dele
gation ... to the California Repub
lican Party state convention in Feb
ruary."
The Stanford Democrats are
taking a more community-based
approach to their event planning.
"The big event... we're looking
to organize [is] a 'Dress Like a Re
publican' party on campus," Lam

ont said. "That's what we mean by
having campus events that... drag
the liberal base and get them
pumped and excited. It's the com
munity-based stuff that keeps peo
ple volunteering and involved."
Lamont laughed off a follow-up
question pressing her on what
"Dress Like a Republican" meant.
"You can take that as you like,"
she said. "Favorite candidate imper
sonations, to presidential masks ...
as extreme [of a] stereotype as you
want to go."
The lightheartedness of the pro
posed events on the Democratic
side contrasts with the more formal
planning of the Stanford College
Republicans.
"Our meetings feature speak
ers," Toman-Miller said. "Our last
speaker was Professor Evers from
the Hoover Institute. Other promi
nent speakers ... [like] House Ma
jority Whip Kevin McCarthy have
offered to speak ... in the new
year."
Toman-Miller also denies the as
sumption that the Stanford campus
is deeply liberal.
"Republicans have been here on

campus since its founding," Toman-
Miller said, pointing out that Le
land Stanford was a Republican.
"At the activities fair this fall, [the
College Republicans] signed up
over 60 new members... there are
indeed many Republicans at Stan
ford."
However, even with recent
growth, the College Republicans'
mailing list remains one eighth of
the size of the Stanford Democrats',
which boasts about 800 members.
Both organizations, however,
were quick to point out that politi
cal engagement is nonpartisan.

"[We] help register everyone el
igible to vote," Toman-Miller said.
"[All of us] must engage in a con
stant and active debate on the risks
and opportunities facing our coun
try."
Lamont echoed her sentiment.
"A big thing for [the Stanford
Democrats] is activism as a whole,"
she said. "There's no partisanship in
getting people to register. Our big
task is following up and getting out
the vote."
