## Study examines shift in squid life cycle 
### NOMANA INTEKHAB HADI 
Biology professor William Gilly
and student researchers recently
managed to identify the El Nino
phenomenon as the reason for
changes in the Humboldt squid's
spawning habits.
The Humboldt squid which
resides in the Sea of Cortez has
been spawning at a much younger
age and smaller size than in past
years. Gilly began his research in
2009, inspired to find the missing
large squid in the Gulf of Califor
nia.
"What we found instead was
small squid all over the Gulf, but

the biggest surprise was that these
squids were mature and spawn
ing," Gilly said.
The El Nino phenomenon, a cli
mate pattern that occurs every five
years, causes warm water to be
pushed down from the surface to
an unusually great depth. Warm
water from the Eastern Tropical
Pacific gets pushed north into tem
perate latitude, causing tempera
ture change. El Nino triggers a
coastal upwelling process, which is
driven by wind and the rotation of
the earth. The upwelling of normal
ly cool, nutrient-rich water brings
warm, nutrient-poor "tropical"
water to the surface. The phyto

plankton's productivity, as a result,
suffers. The squid, which eat phyto
plankton, are thus impacted.
"Squid can move to an area of
tidal upwelling, which remains pro
ductive during an El Nino condi
tion, and continue on their merry,
giant squid lifestyle and live to
spawn when they are a year and a
half old," Gilly said.
The study found that Humboldt
squid are maturing earlier in re
sponse to exaggerated, changing
environmental conditions. The
number of squid was found to be
lower than in past years. Another

The Humboldt squid, which resides in the Sea of Cortez, is spawning at a
much younger age and smaller size than in past years. William Gilly found
that changes in the squid's lifestyle were linked to the El Nino phenomenon.
