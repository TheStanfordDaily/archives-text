## Study examines shift in squid life cycle 
### NOMANA INTEKHAB HADI 
Biology professor William Gilly
and student researchers recently
managed to identify the El Nino
phenomenon as the reason for
changes in the Humboldt squid's
spawning habits.
The Humboldt squid which
resides in the Sea of Cortez has
been spawning at a much younger
age and smaller size than in past
years. Gilly began his research in
2009, inspired to find the missing
large squid in the Gulf of Califor
nia.
"What we found instead was
small squid all over the Gulf, but

the biggest surprise was that these
squids were mature and spawn
ing," Gilly said.
The El Nino phenomenon, a cli
mate pattern that occurs every five
years, causes warm water to be
pushed down from the surface to
an unusually great depth. Warm
water from the Eastern Tropical
Pacific gets pushed north into tem
perate latitude, causing tempera
ture change. El Nino triggers a
coastal upwelling process, which is
driven by wind and the rotation of
the earth. The upwelling of normal
ly cool, nutrient-rich water brings
warm, nutrient-poor "tropical"
water to the surface. The phyto

plankton's productivity, as a result,
suffers. The squid, which eat phyto
plankton, are thus impacted.
"Squid can move to an area of
tidal upwelling, which remains pro
ductive during an El Nino condi
tion, and continue on their merry,
giant squid lifestyle and live to
spawn when they are a year and a
half old," Gilly said.
The study found that Humboldt
squid are maturing earlier in re
sponse to exaggerated, changing
environmental conditions. The
number of squid was found to be
lower than in past years. Another

that changes in the squid's lifestyle were linked to the El Nino phenomenon.
change Gilly's research team dis
covered was that the squid were
not as concentrated in one region.
Gilly attributed this recent change
to the squid's ability to quickly
adapt to new conditions. The ef
fects of these adaptations, howev
er, are difficult to determine at this
early stage.
"It's as if a population of hu
mans started reproducing at age
three," Gilly said. "Whether this is
good or bad for the squid, is not
something that I can easily grasp.
It's just the way it is but pre
sumably this radical change in
lifestyle serves some purpose and
has been selected for by evolu
tion."
The study found that the shift in
lifestyle, in response to El Nino, is
circumstantial. Among the surpris
es was the speed at which the shift

occurred the changes in squid
living patterns occurred between
September 2009 and May 2010,
less than one generation's time for
squid. The timeframe correlated
exactly with El Nino, leading to the
conclusion that El Nino caused the
change in squid lifestyle patterns.
"To our knowledge, the only
times small mature squid have
been reported from the Gulf of
California have been after the
1997-98 El Nino and the 2009-10
El Nino Modok." Gilly said.
"These squid are not on the small
tail-end of a normal distribution or
anything like that they form a
completely distinct size class."
The study's implications for the
future of the Humboldt squid pop
ulation remain unknown. Gilly and
his research team have been look
ing to changes in squid patterns
during the 1997-1998 El Nino peri
od to formulate predictions.
"It took two years for large
squid to return to the traditional
fishing grounds in large enough
numbers to support commercial

fishing," Gilly said. "We're coming
up on two years, so next summer
may show a return to normal [pat
terns], All we can do now is try to
track things and see where they go."
Gilly's research indicated the
important role of global warming
in the El Nino phenomenon. The
current changes from global
warming could exacerbate the im
pact of El Nino, resulting in a po
tentially irreversible change in the
size and living patterns of the
Humboldt squid.
"As long-term warming contin
ues and temperate California wa
ters become more tropical-like,
one might expect a northward pro
gression of the smaller form of
Humboldt squid," Gilly said.
"What's intriguing about our ob
servations is that the switch from
jumbo to small Humboldt squid at
maturity can happen so fast and
that it can be triggered by a dis
crete event like El Nino."

future of the Humboldt squid pop
ulation remain unknown. Gilly and
his research team have been look
ing to changes in squid patterns
during the 1997-1998 El Nino peri
od to formulate predictions.
"It took two years for large
squid to return to the traditional
fishing grounds in large enough
numbers to support commercial

fishing," Gilly said. "We're coming
up on two years, so next summer
may show a return to normal [pat
terns], All we can do now is try to
track things and see where they go."
Gilly's research indicated the
important role of global warming
in the El Nino phenomenon. The
current changes from global
warming could exacerbate the im
pact of El Nino, resulting in a po
tentially irreversible change in the
size and living patterns of the
Humboldt squid.
"As long-term warming contin
ues and temperate California wa
ters become more tropical-like,
one might expect a northward pro
gression of the smaller form of
Humboldt squid," Gilly said.
"What's intriguing about our ob
servations is that the switch from
jumbo to small Humboldt squid at
maturity can happen so fast and
that it can be triggered by a dis
crete event like El Nino."
