## Still dance Visiting artist Ann Carlson experiments with time and space 
### ARUSHI JAIN 
Four lawyers stand still in an
office hallway surrounded
by elevators. Dressed in
typical business attire, the
men's backs are to each
other, and they don't say a word. The
lawyer on the left makes the first
movement, reaching over to slap his
shoulder. The rest follow in a series
of gestures and expressions as they
bend, stretch, point and shout. What
appeared to be a normal scene of
lawyers in suits is transformed into a
dance. To Ann Carlson, a visiting
artist in the drama department, this
use of everyday people in experi
mental settings is what makes her art
distinctive.
After graduating from the Uni
versity of Utah with a bachelor of
fine arts in modern dance and the
University of Arizona with a gradu
ate degree in dance, Carlson began
to collaborate with many dancers, in
cluding the award-winning Meredith
Monk. Her work has been per
formed throughout the United
States, and she has received numer
ous awards, including an American
Masterpiece Award in 2008 and a
three-year fellowship from the Na
tional Endowment for the Arts.
This quarter, Carlson is teaching
two undergraduate classes at Stan
ford: "Performance, History and
Memory: The Jasper Ridge Project"
and "Stillness in Action: The Body
Out of Time," She is also the first vis
iting artist to collaborate with the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, a
biological sanctuary on Stanford
land that is designed to promote re
search and education. It is not a place
traditionally associated with dance.
"The idea of having a visiting
artist first came up two years ago
when I was approached by Robert
Buelteman, a well-known photogra
pher, requesting access to the pre

serve," said Jasper Ridge administra
tive director Philippe Cohen. "I then
went to the vice president of the
Stanford Arts Initiative about hav
ing Rob's photography at the pre
serve as away to raise funds for hav
ing a visiting artist program at Jasper
Ridge."
Carlson saw Jasper Ridge for the
first time when she was invited to do
work on campus in 2008. In March
2010, she returned to campus to col
laborate with 250 students to pro
duce "Still Life with Decoy," in
which students posed like they were
studying textbooks and lying on the
ground after a bike collision, among
other things.
"I have been really interested in
investigating stillness and how it res
onates in different places and differ
ent contexts," Carlson said. "It deals
with Einstein's idea that all of time
exists in the present. Stillness is real
ly interesting because it arrests
movement and lets the past and fu
ture fold on into it."
Based on Carlson's previous
work, Matthew Tie ws M.A. '99 Ph.D.
'O4, executive director of the arts
programs, invited her to be Jasper
Ridge's first visiting artist.
"She is a very unexpected artist,
and we thought it would be an inter
esting collaboration," Tiews said.
Carlson was interested by the his
tory and environment at Jasper
Ridge, which she described as "very
ancient" and "very alive."
"I got really interested in the bal
ance of [Jasper Ridge] not being
open to the public, but then inviting
a time-based artist into the situa
tion," Carlson said. "It seemed coun
terintuitive and wonderfully inven
tive."
The project follows the tableaux
vivant tradition, where actors pose as
paintings or photographs, and in
volves restaging about eight photo
graphs from Jasper Ridge on the

spot they were taken. The perform
ance will take place in March 2012,
when the audience will be guided
through a series of tours through the
different stations on the preserve
where actors perform scenes from
the past.
"It's a collision between that mo
ment in time and the present mo
ment," Carlson said. "It touches on a
lot of different disciplines, such as
environmental biology, botany, ani
mals, fish and birds."
Carlson herself has touched on
multiple disciplines in her work over
the past 20 years, collaborating with
a broad range of people who were
united by shared professions, rela
tionships or passions.
"I approach dance as any con
scious movement," Carlson said. "It
can be you typing on your laptop
right now as long as you are thinking
about it, a keyboard dance,"
This diverse group of performers
have included lawyers, nuns, security
officers and pediatricians, and her
projects have included the four
lawyers skit and a piece with fly fish
ermen she found in a sporting goods
store for a festival in Maine.
"The work is about labor's im
print on the body, about how what
we do or what we love is expressed
through our gestures," Carlson said.
Carlson is particularly fascinated
everyday movements and actively
explores how they can be sequenced
into a dance.
"I feel there is a huge hunger for
people to have an engagement with
metaphor, pulling out their everyday
movements and reconstituting them
into a portrait of who they are," Carl
son said.
Her attention to common objects
and people is evident in her person
ality as well as past work.
"She is this short, blonde fire
ball," Cohen said. "I once described
her as the Studs Terkel of dance. My

impression of her is that she looks in
the everyday and finds what she
views as a performance, which I
think is fascinating."
Tiews expressed a similar per
spective on Carlson's energy and
persona.
"She is incredibly dynamic and
inquisitive," Tiews said. "A part of
her artwork is informed by real, al
most scholarly work, which she man
ifests in really different ways."
Carlson uses this energy to por
tray the body as a powerful vehicle
of change to speak against what she
calls "a tendency to disregard move
ment."
"I call it the 'real people' work,"
Carlson said. "It responds to certain
kinds of social issues because it looks
at stereotyping and then bursts it
apart, like with the dignity of the

lawyers. You wouldn't expect those
guys in the fancy suits to be doing all
of that action."
Through her work, Carlson con
tinues to investigate how dance can
be conveyed through anything and
anyone, whether they are lawyers, fly
fishermen, scientists or Stanford stu
dents. Her stillness class has discussed
the possibility of "occupying" San
Francisco to experiment with still
ness.
"We have been talking about, how
does the still body support or object
to things in public space?" Carlson
said. "Anytime you work outside of
time, it scares people and is a kind of
disruption. It changes the whole ener
gy and impact of the space."
