Stanford's Information Security Office Memo #9
Don't be fooled by typical email scams
and hoaxes; look for these clues:
• Tragic consequences for failing to perform some action
• Promises of money or gift certificates (perhaps for
performing some action)
• Instructions or attachments claiming to protect you from
malware that is undetected by anti-virus software
• Claims that mail is not a hoax
• Multiple spelling errors, grammatical errors, or
contradictory logic
• Admonitions to forward the message
• Mail headers show multiple forwarding already
