## Keats, plural? Gigante explores story of Keats brothers 
### LUCAS OSWALD 
While John is the only Keats to
come to mind when that
name is invoked today, an
other Keats George,
John's brother had an
equally compelling story to tell, according to
English professor Denise Gigante. She ex
plores this story in her latest book, titled "The
Keats Brothers: The Life of John and
George."
For Gigante, whose literary focus is Ro
manticism, John's integral relationship with
his brother George has always remained a
point of fascination. However, the idea of a
dual biography did not originate as a concept
driven endeavor, but came about serendipi
tously. While searching for more of the famed
correspondence between John and George in
Louisville, Gigante stumbled upon a gold
mine: a moldering heap of George's papers
hidden away in the home of an Indiana high
school teacher named Naomi Joy Kirk. Kirk
had assembled a mass of primary source doc
uments and an immense master's thesis on
George in 1933 that had never been pub
lished. With this new body of insights into
George's life, a story was laid out before Gi
gante for her to piece together.
Gigante planned for this book to focus of

the lesser-known brother George, but she also
wanted to include another side of his story
apart from his relationship with John.
"I also wanted to tell the story of so many
immigrants like George, who came to the
United States around 1818 from the Old
Country, the U.K., with visions of living out
their dreams," Gigante said.
However, this factor of the book is only
separated from John in a direct sense. Accord
ing to Creative Writing Program director
Eavan Boland, the struggles of George in a
foreign land coincide with the raw world John
so often evoked in his poetry.
Instead of the glory land of opportunity
that George had anticipated, he found much
disappointment and very little beauty in
America. As one of the principle figures of
Romantic poetry, John is too often lumped
into the canon of the movement by his work
alone. The book however serves to remove
him from this context, or in Boland's words,
"places him the world he came from instead
of the world he made,"

While a biography covering two people,
one being arguably the most highly regarded
poets of the English language and the other
unknown and mostly unaccomplished, is an
unusual tactic for a biographer to take, "The
Keats Brothers" serves a distinct purpose.
As poet Stanley Plumly put it, "Denise Gi

gante and her new biography of these two
brothers take on the pointedly difficult task of
bringing George to life again as the crucially
essential character of John's tragic life."

Plumly, Boland, several faculty members,
four Stegner Fellows and a descendant of
George Keats himself celebrated the book at
a Nov. 7 English Department Literary Event
held in the brothers' honor.

The speakers highlighted portions of the
book that brought insight to the influence ge
ographic separation had on the brothers' lives
also rendering a place for the brothers story in
a familiar and relatable context, the peaks
and falls of success that define everyone's life.

Boland touched on successes of the novel
while presenting her summary.
"It is a charting of the age they lived in
seen through disorder, courage and misfor
tune of their lives," she said. "In this book,
John Keats is saved from the light, and
George is saved from the shadows."
Intermingled with these insights were the
Stegner Fellows' recitations, which brought
select pieces of Keats' poetry to life. The
poems were chosen in an effort to offer an ap
propriate context to the brothers' relation
ship and highlight their dependence on each
other during times of trouble.
In all, the conference reflected the per
spective on Keats presented in the book,
which Gigante later described as "the lens of
his own profound meditations on life and on
death, on suffering and joy and the many fluc
tuations that constitute our shared human ex
perience."
The crowded audience, old and young,
graduate and undergraduate, teachers and
students, largely affirmed Gigante's message:
Although the words of John Keats and his less
famous brother, George, were written two
centuries ago, their poetry still touches the
hearts of readers today.
