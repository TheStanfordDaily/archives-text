# INTERMISSION
## Italian filmmakers shine in SF 
### THEATER 
Last weekend, the New Italian Cinema Festi
val at the Embarcadero Center Theater in
San Francisco closed The San Francisco
Film Society's (SFFS) impressive annual Fall Sea
son of mini-festivals. The season included a se
ries of film festivals Kong Cinema, French
Cinema Now, Taiwan Film Days, NY/SF Inter
national Children's Film Festival, SF Interna
tional Animation Festival each lasting a few
days and showcasing new films from around the
world.
Many emerging Italian filmmakers were
present to introduce their films and participate
in a question-and-answer session shortly after.
Filmmaker Alessandro Aronadio's first feature,
"One Life, Maybe Two," is a dark coming-of-age
story about Matteo, a directionless young adult
who crashed into a parked police car when driv

ing on a slippery road. Two stories play out si
multaneously: one in which the crash happens
and another in which he stops in time. In both
realities, Matteo's anger and boredom are evi
dent. The film often references Francois Truf
faut's "The 400 Blows," the story of a younger,
troubled youth who gets dealt an unfair set of
cards.
Aronadio picks up on the running and water
imagery from "The 400 Blows" and uses them in
his picture to show both freedom and imprison
ment. There is a beautiful ending in which Mat
teo meets himself at a protest in one story he
is a protester and in the other the riot police.
These parallel stories so often feel like a weak
plot device, which causes viewers to focus more
on how the two stories play out differently than
on the characters within them. Perhaps Arona-
dio should have consulted Woody
Allen's "Melinda and Melinda," a film
that tells two parallel stories and finds
unexpected meaning in both, yet never
seems gimmicky.
Francesco Falaschi's "This World is
For You," also presented at the festival,
is, on the surface, a light-hearted come
dy about yet another directionless
youth, Teo, who yearns to be a writer
but is sidetracked by family problems,
including his father's debilitating illness.
On one level, "This World," a story of a
father and son desperately trying to
communicate but hurting each other as
they fail. On another, it's the story of
dealing with the realities of first love,
when the object of Teo's desire, Chiara,
is a strong, independent woman whose

research on wine will ultimately lead
her out of the country and put an expi
ration date on their relationship. It's
also the story of how the scatterbrained,
ambitious Teo, who can't figure out
how to write something honest, finds a
way to meet family expectations as well
as those he has for himself.
"Habemus Papam," which has been
making positive waves on the festival cir
cuit at Cannes and the Toronto Interna
tional Film Festival, was the much-hyped
closing-night film, and the only film by a
truly seasoned actor-director, Nanni
Moretti. The film, which will be released
theatrically in 2012, is sure-footed and
mature, a clever and hilarious satire
about the choosing of a new pope.
When the new pope, Melville
(Michel Piccoli), is chosen, he suffers
from stage fright, starts to hyperventi
late and absolutely refuses to make his
first public address and appearance. Hi
jinks ensue. They bring a non-religious

psychoanalyst (Moretti) to talk him
through it, but hold their sessions in
public and forbid the psychoanalyst
from asking him questions about sex,
his parents and his childhood. They
hold the psychoanalyst in the Vatican
until the unveiling of the new pope, and
in his boredom, he starts up a volleyball
tournament between the Cardinals.

While many great laughs are to be
had, the film works so well as satire
because of the way it humanizes
Melville and the other Cardinals. We
see the Cardinals in their quarters,
playing solitaire, putting together puz
zles, taking their medication and anx
ious to explore Rome while they have
a chance.

And most importantly, we see
Melville, terrified about the task he is
being asked to perform for the church.
He runs away from the Vatican and be
gins walking and exploring the streets
of Rome, contemplating his doubts and

trying to understand his place in the
world. He sees a second psychoanalyst
who does not know he is the pope, and
when asked his profession, Melville re
sponds that he is an actor.

Melville is so realistic, so human,
that it becomes hard for us and for him
to see himself as this divinely holy fig
ure. All this discussion of acting is not
in vain, for when he is finally forced to
take up his post, we see him dressing in
his papal costume, preparing for the
biggest performance of his life. In away,
the film suggests he has gone into the
ater after all.

The key festivals of the Fall Season
may be over, but the SFFS is still screen
ing independent and foreign film at
headquarters, and gearing up for its
winter programming and the annual
San Francisco International Film Festi
val in the spring.

cards.
Aronadio picks up on the running and water
imagery from "The 400 Blows" and uses them in
his picture to show both freedom and imprison
ment. There is a beautiful ending in which Mat
teo meets himself at a protest in one story he
is a protester and in the other the riot police.
These parallel stories so often feel like a weak
plot device, which causes viewers to focus more
on how the two stories play out differently than
on the characters within them. Perhaps Arona-
dio should have consulted Woody
Allen's "Melinda and Melinda," a film
that tells two parallel stories and finds
unexpected meaning in both, yet never
seems gimmicky.
Francesco Falaschi's "This World is
For You," also presented at the festival,
is, on the surface, a light-hearted come
dy about yet another directionless
youth, Teo, who yearns to be a writer
but is sidetracked by family problems,
including his father's debilitating illness.
On one level, "This World," a story of a
father and son desperately trying to
communicate but hurting each other as
they fail. On another, it's the story of
dealing with the realities of first love,
when the object of Teo's desire, Chiara,
is a strong, independent woman whose

research on wine will ultimately lead
her out of the country and put an expi
ration date on their relationship. It's
also the story of how the scatterbrained,
ambitious Teo, who can't figure out
how to write something honest, finds a
way to meet family expectations as well
as those he has for himself.
"Habemus Papam," which has been
making positive waves on the festival cir
cuit at Cannes and the Toronto Interna
tional Film Festival, was the much-hyped
closing-night film, and the only film by a
truly seasoned actor-director, Nanni
Moretti. The film, which will be released
theatrically in 2012, is sure-footed and
mature, a clever and hilarious satire
about the choosing of a new pope.
When the new pope, Melville
(Michel Piccoli), is chosen, he suffers
from stage fright, starts to hyperventi
late and absolutely refuses to make his
first public address and appearance. Hi
jinks ensue. They bring a non-religious

psychoanalyst (Moretti) to talk him
through it, but hold their sessions in
public and forbid the psychoanalyst
from asking him questions about sex,
his parents and his childhood. They
hold the psychoanalyst in the Vatican
until the unveiling of the new pope, and
in his boredom, he starts up a volleyball
tournament between the Cardinals.

While many great laughs are to be
had, the film works so well as satire
because of the way it humanizes
Melville and the other Cardinals. We
see the Cardinals in their quarters,
playing solitaire, putting together puz
zles, taking their medication and anx
ious to explore Rome while they have
a chance.

And most importantly, we see
Melville, terrified about the task he is
being asked to perform for the church.
He runs away from the Vatican and be
gins walking and exploring the streets
of Rome, contemplating his doubts and

trying to understand his place in the
world. He sees a second psychoanalyst
who does not know he is the pope, and
when asked his profession, Melville re
sponds that he is an actor.

Melville is so realistic, so human,
that it becomes hard for us and for him
to see himself as this divinely holy fig
ure. All this discussion of acting is not
in vain, for when he is finally forced to
take up his post, we see him dressing in
his papal costume, preparing for the
biggest performance of his life. In away,
the film suggests he has gone into the
ater after all.

The key festivals of the Fall Season
may be over, but the SFFS is still screen
ing independent and foreign film at
headquarters, and gearing up for its
winter programming and the annual
San Francisco International Film Festi
val in the spring.
