# INTERMISSION
## Italian filmmakers shine in SF 
### THEATER 
Last weekend, the New Italian Cinema Festi
val at the Embarcadero Center Theater in
San Francisco closed The San Francisco
Film Society's (SFFS) impressive annual Fall Sea
son of mini-festivals. The season included a se

Cinema Now, Taiwan Film Days, NY/SF Inter
national Children's Film Festival, SF Interna

days and showcasing new films from around the
world.
Many emerging Italian filmmakers were
present to introduce their films and participate
in a question-and-answer session shortly after.
Filmmaker Alessandro Aronadio's first feature,
"One Life, Maybe Two," is a dark coming-of-age
story about Matteo, a directionless young adult
who crashed into a parked police car when driv

multaneously: one in which the crash happens
and another in which he stops in time. In both
realities, Matteo's anger and boredom are evi
dent. The film often references Francois Truf
faut's "The 400 Blows," the story of a younger,
troubled youth who gets dealt an unfair set of
cards.
Aronadio picks up on the running and water
imagery from "The 400 Blows" and uses them in
his picture to show both freedom and imprison
ment. There is a beautiful ending in which Mat
teo meets himself at a protest in one story he
is a protester and in the other the riot police.
These parallel stories so often feel like a weak
plot device, which causes viewers to focus more
on how the two stories play out differently than
on the characters within them. Perhaps Arona-
