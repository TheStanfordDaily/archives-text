## EDITORIAL Occupy protests should avoid misguided attacks on capitalism 
### 
The Occupy movement that
began as a protest against
Wall Street has been show
ing some worrying signs of devolv
ing into a protest against capital
ism. We have previously praised
the attention drawn by these
protests to critical issues of eco
nomic inequality and unrestrained
financial sector risk-taking, among
other things, but we believe this
change of course threatens to de
tract from the group's original pur
pose. By associating certain poli
cies with extreme viewpoints and
poorly conceived economics, the
Occupy protesters risk doing seri
ous damage to the causes they sup
port.
A few recent cases typify this
trend. Last Friday, Occupy pro
testers in San Francisco took to
blockading Macy's and other re
tail outlets, discouraging shoppers
from patronizing major corpora
tions or from shopping at all.
These protests, in addition to caus
ing traffic jams and other disrup
tions, made no sense. They ignore
the obvious reality that consumer
spending is necessary for the labor
market to recover and the jobs
everyone wants so badly to return.
They also perpetuate a misguided
notion that small businesses are
inherently better than large busi
nesses. In fact, increasing the size
of businesses often enhances effi
ciency through economies of scale,
lowering the costs of production
and prices for consumers. The tril
lions of dollars on corporate bal
ance sheets right now reflect not
evil greed, but rather a slow econ
omy that discourages businesses
from reinvesting their funds in
new productive opportunities.
Moreover, Thanksgiving shoppers
are exercising a very basic liberty
that a free society guarantees.
Another episode at Harvard
University saw students walk out
of an introductory economics
course taught by Professor Greg
Mankiw, a former adviser to Pres
ident George W. Bush. These stu
dents complained of the supposed
biases propagated by the course
while offering no real evidence to
show that the material covered
anything other than standard
basic approaches to economics.
Along the way, the protesters
demonstrated their ignorance by
grumbling nonsensically that Pro
fessor Mankiw did not teach Key
nesian theory as an "alternative"
to Adam Smith, even though the
two are compatible and are used
to explain completely different
things, when all they had to do was
wait until the macroeconomic por
tion of the course for this material.
Such a fundamental misunder
standing of the "mainstream eco
nomics" they railed against only
reinforced that the protests were
rooted in ideological preconcep
tions rather than actual analysis.
Similar strains of confused
rhetoric have begun making occa
sional appearances at Stanford. A
recent, widely distributed message
encouraging students to "Occupy
the Future" emphasized "the link
between unrestrained economic
growth and the current economic
crisis." Since the word "crisis" itself
is being used to describe a large
contraction in GDP and the subse
quent weak recovery marked pre
cisely by a lack of growth, it seems
difficult to imagine why economic
growth would be considered the
problem. Similarly, the message
goes on to lament flat wages for
much of the population when ris
ing wages would, of course, result
from the very growth they criti
cize. Like the Harvard students

who appeared to oppose markets
just for the sake of doing so, these
advocates appear to use decrying
growth as a convenient catch
phrase without considering the
implications of their words.

In this discussion, it is worth em
phasizing just what it means to
have a market-based economy.
Free markets do not have to mean
low taxes or favorable treatment
for the rich. Indeed, high-tax Scan
dinavian economies with lavish
welfare states consistently score
near the top of the Heritage Foun
dation's Economic Freedom
Index. The decision to use markets
to maximize wealth creation exists
separately from policy choices re
garding the proper levels of taxa
tion and income redistribution.
Similarly, free markets do not
mean allowing an unregulated
frenzy of risk-taking on Wall
Street. The hated bank bailouts
that resulted from failed financial
sector policy were outside of the
normal capitalist framework
where businesses are allowed to
fail and succeed on their merits. Ef
forts to prevent the next bailout, as
the Dodd-Frank regulatory re
form bill or Republican presiden
tial candidate Jon Huntsman's
plan to curb large banks endeavor
to do, would actually strengthen
capitalism and allow it to function
properly. So too, would environ
mental protection, reforming poli
tics to reduce the power of special
interests, and other worthy goals of
the protesters.
This brings us to our central
point: we point out the erroneous
ness and futility of these episodes
in an attempt to strengthen the
focus of the protests. We admitted
ly pick a few examples out of a
much broader context. By doing
so, we intend not to paint the pro
testers all with the same brush or
to use a small number of state
ments to undercut a wider effort,
but rather to point out where the
movement has gone astray in
hopes of pushing toward what we
view as the right track. For the
most part, we share the goals of
Tuesday's "Occupy the Future"
op-ed published by six professors
on this page as well as, we imagine,
many of the policies they would
support. But we aim to stress that
a country with slightly higher taxes
on the wealthy, a carbon tax, ro
bust financial regulation and other
reasonable aims the protesters
should adopt to pursue their goals
would still be a place with a free
market, capitalist economy. Oppo
nents of such types of progressive
policies often try to paint their
supporters as communists or radi
cals that seek to undermine Amer
ican prosperity. The last thing that
would help push public policy in
this direction would be to prove
them right.

Free markets
do not mean
allowing an
unregulated frenzy
of risk-taking
on Wall Street.
The Occupy movement that
began as a protest against
Wall Street has been show
ing some worrying signs of devolv
ing into a protest against capital
ism. We have previously praised
the attention drawn by these
protests to critical issues of eco
nomic inequality and unrestrained
financial sector risk-taking, among
other things, but we believe this
change of course threatens to de
tract from the group's original pur
pose. By associating certain poli
cies with extreme viewpoints and
poorly conceived economics, the
Occupy protesters risk doing seri
ous damage to the causes they sup
port.
A few recent cases typify this
trend. Last Friday, Occupy pro
testers in San Francisco took to
blockading Macy's and other re
tail outlets, discouraging shoppers
from patronizing major corpora
tions or from shopping at all.
These protests, in addition to caus
ing traffic jams and other disrup
tions, made no sense. They ignore
the obvious reality that consumer
spending is necessary for the labor
market to recover and the jobs
everyone wants so badly to return.
They also perpetuate a misguided
notion that small businesses are
inherently better than large busi
nesses. In fact, increasing the size
of businesses often enhances effi
ciency through economies of scale,
lowering the costs of production
and prices for consumers. The tril
lions of dollars on corporate bal
ance sheets right now reflect not
evil greed, but rather a slow econ
omy that discourages businesses
from reinvesting their funds in
new productive opportunities.
Moreover, Thanksgiving shoppers
are exercising a very basic liberty
that a free society guarantees.
Another episode at Harvard
University saw students walk out
of an introductory economics
course taught by Professor Greg
Mankiw, a former adviser to Pres
ident George W. Bush. These stu
dents complained of the supposed
biases propagated by the course
while offering no real evidence to
show that the material covered
anything other than standard
basic approaches to economics.
Along the way, the protesters
demonstrated their ignorance by
grumbling nonsensically that Pro
fessor Mankiw did not teach Key
nesian theory as an "alternative"
to Adam Smith, even though the
two are compatible and are used
to explain completely different
things, when all they had to do was
wait until the macroeconomic por
tion of the course for this material.
Such a fundamental misunder
standing of the "mainstream eco
nomics" they railed against only
reinforced that the protests were
rooted in ideological preconcep
tions rather than actual analysis.
Similar strains of confused
rhetoric have begun making occa
sional appearances at Stanford. A
recent, widely distributed message
encouraging students to "Occupy
the Future" emphasized "the link
between unrestrained economic
growth and the current economic
crisis." Since the word "crisis" itself
is being used to describe a large
contraction in GDP and the subse
quent weak recovery marked pre
cisely by a lack of growth, it seems
difficult to imagine why economic
growth would be considered the
problem. Similarly, the message
goes on to lament flat wages for
much of the population when ris
ing wages would, of course, result
from the very growth they criti
cize. Like the Harvard students

who appeared to oppose markets
just for the sake of doing so, these
advocates appear to use decrying
growth as a convenient catch
phrase without considering the
implications of their words.

In this discussion, it is worth em
phasizing just what it means to
have a market-based economy.
Free markets do not have to mean
low taxes or favorable treatment
for the rich. Indeed, high-tax Scan
dinavian economies with lavish
welfare states consistently score
near the top of the Heritage Foun
dation's Economic Freedom
Index. The decision to use markets
to maximize wealth creation exists
separately from policy choices re
garding the proper levels of taxa
tion and income redistribution.
Similarly, free markets do not
mean allowing an unregulated
frenzy of risk-taking on Wall
Street. The hated bank bailouts
that resulted from failed financial
sector policy were outside of the
normal capitalist framework
where businesses are allowed to
fail and succeed on their merits. Ef
forts to prevent the next bailout, as
the Dodd-Frank regulatory re
form bill or Republican presiden
tial candidate Jon Huntsman's
plan to curb large banks endeavor
to do, would actually strengthen
capitalism and allow it to function
properly. So too, would environ
mental protection, reforming poli
tics to reduce the power of special
interests, and other worthy goals of
the protesters.
This brings us to our central
point: we point out the erroneous
ness and futility of these episodes
in an attempt to strengthen the
focus of the protests. We admitted
ly pick a few examples out of a
much broader context. By doing
so, we intend not to paint the pro
testers all with the same brush or
to use a small number of state
ments to undercut a wider effort,
but rather to point out where the
movement has gone astray in
hopes of pushing toward what we
view as the right track. For the
most part, we share the goals of
Tuesday's "Occupy the Future"
op-ed published by six professors
on this page as well as, we imagine,
many of the policies they would
support. But we aim to stress that
a country with slightly higher taxes
on the wealthy, a carbon tax, ro
bust financial regulation and other
reasonable aims the protesters
should adopt to pursue their goals
would still be a place with a free
market, capitalist economy. Oppo
nents of such types of progressive
policies often try to paint their
supporters as communists or radi
cals that seek to undermine Amer
ican prosperity. The last thing that
would help push public policy in
this direction would be to prove
them right.
