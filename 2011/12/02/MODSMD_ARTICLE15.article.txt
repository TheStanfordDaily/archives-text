## Of trees, fighter jets and the mysteries of science funding 
### Holly Moeller 
By the time Dr. Maciej Zwie
niecki returned to the black
board, I'd gotten sufficiently
lost in the intricacies of fluid dy
namics that I wasn't sure how much
more I could absorb from his lec
ture on vertical water transport in
trees. Still, I could objectively ad
mire his off-the-cuff artwork as he
brushed away a cross-section of a
tree and quickly outlined a perfect
ly recognizable ... fighter jet?
The audience watched, be
mused. Maciej chuckled, then ex
plained how mechanisms borrowed
from tree physiology might one day
be used to efficiently transfer heat
from jet wings to the cockpit. At
least, that's what the Department
of Defense (DOD), which funded
his basic research on tree mechan
ics, hoped.
It was an unexpected but in
formative â€” turn in the Harvard
Forest researcher's address. Though
motivated in equal parts by awe at
the forest of biological pumps that
natural selection has produced and
by burning curiosity to understand
how these pumps function, Maciej's
work was ultimately subject to the
occasional left-hand turn in pursuit
of biomimicry.
This was both a blessing and a
curse. A relatively plush DOD
budget meant he could invest in de
tailed MRI imagery to watch water
flow through living trees. But when
it came to basic ecological questions
How would his test seedlings
adapt if grown under drought con
ditions? Do all tree species employ
the same strategies? Maciej
could only shrug. His dollars were
earmarked for a very specific pur
pose, and it was just luck that some
basic science could be done simulta
neously.
As I exited the lecture hall 15
minutes later, I thanked my lucky
stars that my research funding was
far more flexible and hoped that the
U.S. government would continue to
invest in basic scientific research.
Sure, getting a grant funded by the
National Science Foundation
(NSF) (as many basic research pro
grams in my field are) is no mean
feat, especially as financial belts are
being tightened across the nation.
But the NSF is one of the few places
you can turn for help answering
fundamental questions about how
the world works, laying the founda

tions for more applied develop
ments.
The world is filled with acciden
tal discoveries by curious re
searchers, later developed into
some of our most important tech
nologies. Take X-rays, for example.
Of course, many academics are mo
tivated purely by their own curiosi
ty should a world-changing find
ing emerge from their work, well,
that was just a lucky break. Over the
history of the United States, its citi
zens have largely supported these
endeavors and enjoyed the fruits of
these labors in popular scientific ac
counts, documentaries and the like.
But today, as pennies are being
pinched and a growing faction of
people actively denies the societal
value of scientific knowledge, those
of us working in basic science are
feeling a bit on edge. As evidenced
by scores of cell biologists linking
their work to cancer biology and a
numbers of ecologists citing the im
pacts of climate change, we're all
looking for ways to make our work
immediately relevant to society's
needs.
As an environmentalist, I think a
certain degree of self-reflection is in
order. We each have to make a judg
ment call about the work that inter
ests us and the degree to which we
want it to "matter" beyond our
inner circle. But should that influ
ence our ability to get funding?
Obviously, it depends on whose
money you're asking to spend. Gov
ernment agencies aside, there are
plenty of private ventures funding
their own teams of scientists (and
please keep agendas in mind when
you read, say, the environmental im
pact assessment produced by Shell
Petroleum.)
There's something to be said for
getting what you pay for: the most
effective way of transferring hy
draulics from trees to fighter jets
doubtless begins by funding Maciej
Zwieniecki to figure out exactly
how trees work. There's also value
in linking financiers, researchers
and beneficiaries. In theory, the
tighter the groups are coupled, the
more the researchers' efforts will
reflect the needs and interests of
those whose money they are spend
ing. This also keeps lines of commu
nication open and ensures that sci
entific results aren't buried in the
technical papers that have become

the currency of academia.
Perhaps that's why I'm glad to
hear about peers both scientists
and journalists turning to crowd
sourced funding. Taking advantage
of modern technology they make
web-based pitches that, if well
placed, can reach thousands. To
catch on, they must be concise, com
prehensible and charismatic (which
perhaps explains why friends' stud
ies of tropical biodiversity and cof
fee production or climate-driven
extinction are succeeding in ways
that my new project on tree-fungal
coevolution might not).
Ultimately, that's why we need
many kinds of science funding
from an array of sources and ear
marked for a range of specificities.
Science emerged from a desire to
describe the world around us and to
understand how humanity interacts
with it. To advance either goal, we
must invest in both it's an invest
ment that Americans will hopefully
continue to make, both with their
tax dollars and from their private
funds.
