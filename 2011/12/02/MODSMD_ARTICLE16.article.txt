## Title game misses out on USC 
### Joseph Beyda 
I love hating USC as much as
the next guy, but this is just
getting ridiculous. Until
now, I've never had a real
problem with the sanctions
enforced against the Trojans due to
a "lack of institutional control" that
allegedly led to improper benefits
for former running back Reggie
Bush and guard OJ. Mayo. Don't do
the crime if you can't do the time.
Don't be surprised when innocent
people get caught in the crossfire
long afterwards. Don't expect
mercy from the NCAA when you
make a mockery of its dedication to
amateurism.

But all of a sudden, it feels like
NCAA is making a mockery of col
lege football fans. And the Pac-12.

When the first-ever Pac-12 Foot
ball Championship Game is played
tonight, the conference's claim that
"the best of the North meets the
best of the South" will be utterly in
validated. USC (10-2 7-2 Pac-12) is
far and away the best team in the
Pac-12 South nobody else has
challenged both Stanford and Ore
gon and it's not even going to be
within 500 miles of Autzen Stadium
tonight thanks to the postseason
ban imposed by the NCAA. Adding
insult to injury, the Trojans will be
replaced by archrival UCLA (6-6,
5-4), which has lost four Pac-12 con
tests by the combined score of 124-
37, ranks 88th out of 120 FBS
schools in points scored (and 87th in
points allowed), fired its head coach
effective after tonight's game and,
of course, lost to USC 50-0 just a
week ago.
Ever since the Trojans received
their postseason ban, scholarship
reductions and other sanctions,
people have been asking how in the
world USC was supposed to pre
vent a sharp dip in recruiting that
could send ripples through their
program for years. So let me ask a
question that's just as applicable to
USC, not to mention Stanford and
the 10 other members of the Pac-12:
Flow in the world is a freshly re
aligned conference supposed to
make a name for itself on a national
scale, fuel a massive new television
deal, eliminate the East Coast (or
better: Southeast coast) bias that's
been consistently haunting it in
both BCS and Heisman considera
tions and attract any significant
viewership for tonight's highly tout
ed championship game if it's bound
to be a laugher?
I'd argue that it can't.

This debacle strikes at the heart
of what we consider the "champi
on" of a conference. Last year, USC
could've still achieved the title
"Pac-12 Champion" if it won
enough games. Being officially rec
ognized as the best team in the con
ference actually had something to
do with how you played on Satur
days, not the skeletons hanging
around in your proverbial closet.

This time around, the NCAA's
sanctions go too far. By considering
the Pac-12 title game a postseason
contest, the NCAA is directly im
peding the historical success of
USC's football program and direct
ly harming current Trojans players
who haven't done anything wrong.
The distinction between that and
the prior impact of the sanctions is
minor yet still notable.
The same is true from the per
spective of the conference as a
whole. It's one thing to keep the
conference's strongest dynasty in
recent memory from having the
chance to represent the Pac-12 in a
bowl for a couple years; it's worse to
keep it out of the record books alto
gether.
Hopefully we're never going to
have to deal with this situation in

the future. Pac-12 teams not to
mention the rest of the country
have probably learned their lesson
from the droves of NCAA rules vi
olations in recent years. But re
gardless, the legitimacy of the Pac
-12 title game is severely threat
ened if a legitimate contender can
be excluded so easily, as with USC
this year. The same goes for other
conference championship games,
which will more than likely experi
ence similar issues in the near fu
ture if violations continue to ap
pear out of nowhere.
There's no question that we
need to punish violators and dis
courage improper benefits, and the
threats of losing a few years' worth
of bowl games or the vacation of

past wins are major deterrents. But
preventing future teams from put
ting their names in the record
books? That goes one step too far.
So USC fans, take note: For the
first time in my life, I'm supporting
you on something. Though you will
probably enjoy watching your best
friends from Westwood get mur
dered tonight, you're the ones who
belong in Eugene,

There was a bitter fight over whether
The Daily could run this column given
its pro-USC tilt, but Joseph Bey da won
us over with a PowerPoint presentation
and some very impressive spreadsheets.
Feel free to let him know how a chance
to keep SC down should never be
passed up at jbeyda@stanford.edu.
