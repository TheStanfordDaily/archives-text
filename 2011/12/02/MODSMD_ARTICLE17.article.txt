# REDHAWKS DOWN
## SPORTS BRIEFS 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
Led by a dominant performance
in the paint by senior forwards Jack
Trotter and Andrew Zimmerman,
the men's basketball team improved
to 7-1 on the season with a 72-49 win
over Seattle Thursday night.

Trotter scored 13 points on 5-6
shooting from the field including
a rare three-pointer for the 6-foot-9
power forward in what was his
best performance of the season
against the Redhawks' over
whelmed interior defense.

Zimmerman also got into the ac
tion down low, scoring 10 points on
5-8 shooting as the Cardinal shot 45

percent from the field and took a 40-
17 at halftime after holding Seattle
(2-3) scoreless for a seven-minute
stretch early in the game.
Sophomore forward Anthony
Brown heated up from the outside
after the break, knocking down sev
eral three-pointers and scoring 10
of his game-high 15 points in the
half. And despite a big improve
ment from the Redhawks offense

they shot just 8-25 from the field
in the first half and missed all nine
three-point attempts the Cardi
nal was just too much to handle.
Sophomore forward John Gage
had another solid shooting night,
going 2-3 from behind the arc and
contributing eight points in the

first half, and fellow sophomore
forward Josh Huestis continued
his recent stretch of stellar play
with nine points and nine re
bounds on the night.

Stanford did have to shake off
tough shooting nights from fresh
man guard Chasson Randle and
redshirt senior forward Josh
Owens, who went a combined 1-13
with no points from Owens the
Cardinal's leading scorer was aver
aging better than 12 points per
game before the game.
Up next for Stanford is a
matchup with North Carolina State
at home on Sunday. It will be the
last game before the team breaks
for dead and finals weeks, with tip

off scheduled for 1 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.

Sophomore guard Aaron Bright, a Seattle-area native, had 10 points last night in Stanford's 72-49 win over the Redhawks. Though Stanford's big men,
senior forwards Jack Trotter and Andrew Zimmermann, dominated the action, Bright has carved out an increased role for himself this season.
