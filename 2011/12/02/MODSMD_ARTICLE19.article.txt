# MEN'S SWIMMING & DIVING
## Freshmen shine early 
### GEORGE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's diving program was buzzing with ex
citement last year when it landed the top two high school re
cruits in the country. Now, that excitement is shifting into re
sults as Kristian Ipsen and Connor Kuremsky are in the
middle of their freshman collegiate seasons and already im
pressing teammates and coaches alike.
Coming into the season as the No. 1 recruit in the coun
try, Ipsen had already made a name for himself on the na
tional and international scenes. Among his many accom
plishments, Ipsen is a 16-time junior national champion,
eight-time senior national champion, three-time word jun
ior world champion and a silver medalist at the 2009 World
Championships. All of these accolades came flooding in be
fore he even took a single step on the diving board for the
Cardinal.

"Kristian is just excellent," said head diving coach Rick
Schavone. "I'm awed by it. Our goal is for him to qualify for
the 2012 Olympics and then medal at the 2016 Olympics.
He's making some sacrifices this year as a freshman because
he has to balance the collegiate season with his USOC
(United States Olympic Committee) commitments.
