# MEN'S SWIMMING & DIVING
## Freshmen shine early 
### GEORGE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's diving program was buzzing with ex
citement last year when it landed the top two high school re
cruits in the country. Now, that excitement is shifting into re
sults as Kristian Ipsen and Connor Kuremsky are in the
middle of their freshman collegiate seasons and already im
pressing teammates and coaches alike.
Coming into the season as the No. 1 recruit in the coun
try, Ipsen had already made a name for himself on the na
tional and international scenes. Among his many accom
plishments, Ipsen is a 16-time junior national champion,
eight-time senior national champion, three-time word jun
ior world champion and a silver medalist at the 2009 World
Championships. All of these accolades came flooding in be
fore he even took a single step on the diving board for the
Cardinal.

"Kristian is just excellent," said head diving coach Rick
Schavone. "I'm awed by it. Our goal is for him to qualify for
the 2012 Olympics and then medal at the 2016 Olympics.
He's making some sacrifices this year as a freshman because
he has to balance the collegiate season with his USOC
(United States Olympic Committee) commitments.
"He could be the greatest talent
since [Gregory] Louganis," ex
plained Schavone, a three-time
NCAA Coach of the Year, coach of
eight NCAA team championships
and developer of 89 All-American
honors. "On the men's side, he is def
initely the most well-accomplished
diver we've ever had coming in. No
one comes close to him."

It's an unexaggerated, yet lofty
compliment, considering that
Louganis won four Olympic gold
medals and five World Champi
onship titles in the 1980s.
And yet the No. 2 recruit, Kurem
sky, has his own lengthy list of accom
plishments. He finished second at the
2007 Junior National Champi
onships in the 1-meter springboard
and placed in the top three at the
2009 Junior National Champi
onships in both the 1-meter and 3-
meter events. And he has also com
peted well on the international stage,
finishing fifth at the 2007 Junior Pan
American Games.

"Connor might not be as accom
plished as Kristian coming in, but
he's definitely up there, too,"
Schavone said. "He's of that caliber.
Connor's progress in this past month
has really taken off and he's im
proved just as much as Kristian has."
Ipsen and Kuremsky have not
only benefited from each other's
presence, but also by being part of
the team as a whole.

"I feel like when you train with
anybody, regardless of their ability
level, you can watch them and imple
ment the things you learn into your
own diving," Kuremsky said. "I hon
estly think that by working with
everyone on the team, let alone Kris

tian, I'm able to improve myself."
Despite the success on the board
both divers share, they come from
very different training backgrounds.
This has forced Schavone to imple
ment different approaches for each
diver.

"Kristian came from a minimal
training background and did not have
a great deal of pool accessibility,"
Schavone said. "We're trying to build
the foundation and revisit the basics
so that he can compete at even higher
levels. Connor, on the other hand,
comes from a solid program. His ba
sics are excellent. But I want to im
prove his dynamics, so that he'll be
more powerful and explode better off
the board."

Both Ipsen and Kuremsky were
quick to credit their coach for con
structing an exciting and supportive
atmosphere in which the transition
has been almost seamless. They're
also aware of the progress they've
made over the past few months train
ing under Schavone's practice regi
men.

"Before coming here, I had a limit
ed number of hours for practice, and I
would have to rush through it," Ipsen
said. "There's more flexibility here,
and I think that's been beneficial."
Kuremsky agreed.

"For me, the transition has been
easy," he said. "Everyone here is real
ly supportive of each other. Coach
Schavone... has made practice fun,
rather than something you don't
want to do. He also focuses on break
ing diving down into simple move
ments â€” movements that anyone,
not just divers, can do. That makes
things easier."

The veterans on the team have
also helped make things easier for
the freshmen divers. Kuremsky
noted that the upperclassmen have
been very helpful, particularly with
academic advice, and Ipsen also cited
their helpful role outside practice.

"It's nice to have many people on
the team who are older than us,"
Ipsen said. "They show us the ropes,
how college diving works and what
certain corrections to make. And we
can ask them about anything, not just
about diving."
Schavone expressed no doubts
about how well the freshmen have fit
into the team, as well as the overall
team chemistry.
"We have an amazing men's
team, probably the best we've ever
had," he said. "We have five guys
who've competed at senior nationals.
The basic core of our team is sopho
mores and freshmen. They fit togeth
er great and take bonding trips. They
like each other and work hard as a
team."

The diving duo is excited and op
timistic as the rest of the season un
folds.

"I'm looking forward to the team
atmosphere. We're all striving for the
same thing, and there's people to
support you even when you have a
setback," Kuremsky said.
Ipsen was happy just to be able to
get into the whole process of compe
tition at the collegiate level.

"I'm excited to travel with the
team to the meets. I've been so excit
ed to be involved in collegiate diving,
and now I'm finally part of it."

Their stories are even more inter
twined than you might expect; Ipsen
and Kuremsky have known each
other for a long time since well
before Stanford, and even before
high school. They first met at the Ju
nior Pan-Pacific meet when they
were just twelve years old. Since
then, they've seen each other at na
tional meets and on recruiting trips
throughout years.
And now, finally, they're Cardinal
teammates.
