## Breaking down the BCS 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
With just a week left in the college football
season and the Stanford football team's season
over, the Cardinal must now sit and wait to find
out where it will be playing in a bowl this January
and thanks to its second consecutive 11-1 fin
ish, Stanford will be playing for its second con
secutive BCS bowl.

But every college football fan knows that
there are few things more confusing than the
BCS nuclear physics, the "plot" of the three
Star Wars prequels and the Kennedy assassina
tion are perhaps the only subjects more baffling
so it's useful to lay out the scenarios that affect
Stanford's road ahead.

In order to put the BCS puzzle together, it's
useful to lay out the teams that are still in con
tention. For clarity's sake, it'll be easiest to go
conference by conference and pick out who still
has a chance.

Pac-12: Oregon and UCLA play tonight in
Eugene to decide the Pac-12 champion, who will
go to the Rose Bowl. Even the staunchest Bruins

fan would concede that lame-duck Rick
Neuheisel's squad doesn't stand much of a
chance, so it's pretty safe to say that the Ducks
are headed for Pasadena. Stanford is ranked
fourth in the latest BCS standings, which guaran
tees the Cardinal a BCS berth, and it's over
whelmingly likely that the Card will end up in the
Fiesta Bowl, with an outside shot at the Sugar
Bowl.

SEC: LSU and Georgia will play on Saturday
to decide the conference champion but it like
ly doesn't matter if LSU wins or loses, because
they're going to the national title game either
way. The Tigers' BCS ranking is a perfect 1.000,
so even if they lose to the Bulldogs, they'll still get
to reprise the "Game of the Century" with Al
abama for the National Championship.
The Tide have locked up a spot in the nation
al title game because, like Stanford, Alabama is
firmly planted at number two in the standings
and is extremely unlikely to move no matter
what happens. It's also worth mentioning that if
Georgia does upset LSU, it will get a berth in the
Sugar Bowl.
The only way the SEC race could
affect Stanford is if LSU wins, be
cause then the Sugar Bowl could se
lect the Cardinal to play in New Or
leans. However, they're more likely
to select 10-2 Michigan should that
situation occur, because the Michi
ganders would buy up far more
seats than the Cardinal ever could.
(Unless Stanford decided to dedi
cate its $2O billion endowment to a
weekend of hand grenades and
bead-tossing for all students and
alumni.)
Big 12: Oklahoma and Okla
homa State square off Saturday for
the conference title, and the winner
will end up in the Fiesta Bowl, the
traditional landing spot for the Big
12 champion. So start brushing up
on your Sooners and Cowboys his
tory, Cardinal fans, if you want to get
a few good laughs and learn how to
taunt your future opponents.
Big Ten: Wisconsin and Michigan
State play this Saturday to decide
who goes to the Rose Bowl to face
Oregon. (Or UCLA. And by that I
mean Oregon.) And remember that
Michigan is likely to get the call to
the Sugar Bowl should LSU win.

ACC: Virginia Tech and Clem
son square off in a play-in game for
the Orange Bowl. How sad does
that last sentence make you? Not as
sad as you're about to be.
Big East: Cincinnati, West Vir
ginia and Louisville are the teams
still in the hunt for the Orange
Bowl. Because I'm sure you don't
care which of these three awful
teams ends up playing the Hokies or
Tigers, I won't waste any more of
your time.
Non-automatic-qualifying con
ferences: Should Houston beat
Southern Mississippi on Saturday, it
will win Conference USA and thus
be eligible for a BCS bowl. The
Cougars are likely to end up in the
Sugar Bowl if they win, and if they
lose, they would open up another
spot for an at-large bid. If the
Cougars lose and Oklahoma beats
Oklahoma State, it would likely
mean that both the Sooners and the
Cowboys would be BCS-bound.
So there you have it essential
ly 17 teams for 10 spots. Not that
confusing at all, right? After a long,
wild season, everything's turned out
to be pretty simple at the end.That's
the great thing about the BCS puz
zle, after all it says it takes two to
three years on the box, but it only
took me six months to figure it out.
