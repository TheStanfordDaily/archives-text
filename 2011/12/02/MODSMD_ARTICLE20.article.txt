## Breaking down the BCS 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
With just a week left in the college football
season and the Stanford football team's season
over, the Cardinal must now sit and wait to find
out where it will be playing in a bowl this January
and thanks to its second consecutive 11-1 fin
ish, Stanford will be playing for its second con
secutive BCS bowl.

But every college football fan knows that
there are few things more confusing than the
BCS nuclear physics, the "plot" of the three
Star Wars prequels and the Kennedy assassina
tion are perhaps the only subjects more baffling
so it's useful to lay out the scenarios that affect
Stanford's road ahead.

In order to put the BCS puzzle together, it's
useful to lay out the teams that are still in con
tention. For clarity's sake, it'll be easiest to go
conference by conference and pick out who still
has a chance.

Pac-12: Oregon and UCLA play tonight in
Eugene to decide the Pac-12 champion, who will
go to the Rose Bowl. Even the staunchest Bruins

fan would concede that lame-duck Rick
Neuheisel's squad doesn't stand much of a
chance, so it's pretty safe to say that the Ducks
are headed for Pasadena. Stanford is ranked
fourth in the latest BCS standings, which guaran
tees the Cardinal a BCS berth, and it's over
whelmingly likely that the Card will end up in the
Fiesta Bowl, with an outside shot at the Sugar
Bowl.

SEC: LSU and Georgia will play on Saturday
to decide the conference champion but it like
ly doesn't matter if LSU wins or loses, because
they're going to the national title game either
way. The Tigers' BCS ranking is a perfect 1.000,
so even if they lose to the Bulldogs, they'll still get
to reprise the "Game of the Century" with Al
abama for the National Championship.
The Tide have locked up a spot in the nation
al title game because, like Stanford, Alabama is
firmly planted at number two in the standings
and is extremely unlikely to move no matter
what happens. It's also worth mentioning that if
Georgia does upset LSU, it will get a berth in the
