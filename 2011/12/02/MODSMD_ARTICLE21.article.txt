# TINK TALK Q&A WITH JOSLYN TINKLE
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Junior forward Joslyn Tinkle scored a
career-high 19 points and chipped in nine
rebounds in the Cardinal's latest win over
UC-Davis. We caught up with the Mis
soula, Mont, native to ask her about this
year's Stanford team and all things bas
ketball.

Stanford Daily (TSD):This year the team
has undergone a couple of changes with
an infusion of youth from the big fresh

man class. What is the team dynamic and
what kind of role have you taken on as
one of the veterans?
Joslyn Tinkle (JT): I think that's just
something that we as upperclassmen did
a really good job of, making sure to
smooth the transition. Over the summer a
lot of us were here helping the freshmen
out. And it is a big advantage for them to
come in here, before their freshmen year,
to kind of get acquainted with everything,

kind of get going in the system. We
worked really hard and they pick up
things really quickly, which is nice.
We didn't know what to expect, with
six freshmen it's practically half our
team, but it's been great.
And for me, coming in as an up
perclassman, you have a kind of dif
ferent game about you, a different
mentality. You want to lead and help
these younger kids out as well as be
contributors and work with the
teammates you've been around for
longer. I would say it is more fun to
be an upperclassman, though.

TSD: What are some of your person
al goals this season?

JT: You know, for me, it's been a lit
tle bit different in that coming in as
a freshman, I played a lot inside, be
hind Jayne Appel and [Nnemkadi
Ogwumike], and then last year I
was a little more on the perimeter,
even starting the year at the two
guard. Fm really thankful that Fm
able to be a little more versatile and
[head coach] Tara [VanDerveer]
puts me out there wherever she re
ally needs me.
It's really about whatever it takes
to be out on the court. I mean, who
doesn't love being in the game? I try
to go out there and do my best and
fulfill my role. And this year I feel
like I'm gaining a little more confi
dence as a contributor, and finding a
role for myself, whether it's inside
playing with my back to the basket or
being able to step out a little more
where I can look inside to those Og
wumike sisters who can just jump
out of the gym [laughter].

TSD: How nice is it playing for a
coach with VanDerveer's pedigree
and track record?

JT: Tara has had tremendous success
here at Stanford. She really knows
what it takes to be a top team and
compete at this caliber of competi
tion. And she is a really good re
cruiter. Everyone I've been fortu
nate enough to play with over my
past three years has made it truly like
a family we are a sisterhood. It's
not a show and we aren't lying when
we say we're best friends on and off
the court. I feel like that's something
she does a really good job of, recruit
ing not only really good basketball
players but good people. She's smart
in that, and she's definitely doing
things right, otherwise we wouldn't
have this kind of success.

TSD: When did you first think that
you might have the chance to do
something special on the basketball
court?
JT: Well first off, 1 didn't really grow
up having a college team I loved.
Both my parents played basketball,
my dad professionally, and so I grew
up just being around the game. All of
my brothers and sisters play and it's
been fun to have everyone in the
family be a part of this. And I guess I
had that advantage of having two

coaches in the house, just wanting to
be in the gym.
But it really clicked when I first
started playing AAU basketball. We
started traveling, gaining some
recognition from college coaches. I
remember my first letter I received
from a college coach as a freshman in
high school. It was pretty spectacu
lar, and just a good feeling and that's
when I thought, "Man, I could really
make something of this." And that's
what's kept me motivated and driv
en to compete at this level.

TSD: What drove you to come to
Stanford? Your dad is the head
coach at Montana and your mom is
going into the Hall of Fame there.
Why come all the way out to Califor
nia?

JT: There was a great amount of
pressure to stay home. I mean, I've
lived there for a long time, they have
a great system going there, and the
best of my high school teammates
are playing there. But for me it was
a matter of looking at the grand
scheme of things. I was recruited
across the country, and I took all five
official visits to schools. And actual
ly I came here with my last one with
out having a particular interest in
Stanford, until I stepped foot on this
campus.
I looked around, and it gave me
goose bumps.There are so many op
portunities I could have for myself
beyond basketball. It came down to
where I could see myself happy, liv
ing here for four years, without bas
ketball. Obviously I wanted to come
here because it's a top team, and has
had great success. But you also
couldn't turn down an education
like this. Like I said, I've been fortu
nate enough to have great team
mates. And when I did choose Stan
ford, a lot of people in Montana sup
ported me and still do today. They
know this is a place that's hard to
turn down.

TSD: Who wins in a game of one-on
one in your family?

JT: I'd like to say myself, sorry mom
[laughter], she's a great player and
we've had our fair share of fights in
the driveway. But dad, I won't even
play there's no chance there. He
still has it. Sister Ellie and I really get
into it, and Tres, you know he's really
just sprouting up. He's gonna be
quite the player himself. He's 6-foot
-4 and my mom calls me up, tells me
he's tip-dunking in practice, [laugh
ter] I'm afraid to play him when I go
back home. So I guess I don't know
who really wins.

TSD: What was it like playing for
Team USA in the 2008 FIB A Amer
icas Championship?

JT: It was just amazing. That was the
first time I met Nneka and Sarah
Boothe who were my USA team
mates. But coming in as a younger
member in that group was one the
best experiences ever. Winning that
gold medal, standing up there was
just one of the proudest moments I
have ever had.

TSD: When did you first think that
you might have the chance to do
something special on the basketball
court?
JT: Well first off, 1 didn't really grow
up having a college team I loved.
Both my parents played basketball,
my dad professionally, and so I grew
up just being around the game. All of
my brothers and sisters play and it's
been fun to have everyone in the
family be a part of this. And I guess I
had that advantage of having two

coaches in the house, just wanting to
be in the gym.
But it really clicked when I first
started playing AAU basketball. We
started traveling, gaining some
recognition from college coaches. I
remember my first letter I received
from a college coach as a freshman in
high school. It was pretty spectacu
lar, and just a good feeling and that's
when I thought, "Man, I could really
make something of this." And that's
what's kept me motivated and driv
en to compete at this level.

TSD: What drove you to come to
Stanford? Your dad is the head
coach at Montana and your mom is
going into the Hall of Fame there.
Why come all the way out to Califor
nia?

JT: There was a great amount of
pressure to stay home. I mean, I've
lived there for a long time, they have
a great system going there, and the
best of my high school teammates
are playing there. But for me it was
a matter of looking at the grand
scheme of things. I was recruited
across the country, and I took all five
official visits to schools. And actual
ly I came here with my last one with
out having a particular interest in
Stanford, until I stepped foot on this
campus.
I looked around, and it gave me
goose bumps.There are so many op
portunities I could have for myself
beyond basketball. It came down to
where I could see myself happy, liv
ing here for four years, without bas
ketball. Obviously I wanted to come
here because it's a top team, and has
had great success. But you also
couldn't turn down an education
like this. Like I said, I've been fortu
nate enough to have great team
mates. And when I did choose Stan
ford, a lot of people in Montana sup
ported me and still do today. They
know this is a place that's hard to
turn down.

TSD: Who wins in a game of one-on
one in your family?

JT: I'd like to say myself, sorry mom
[laughter], she's a great player and
we've had our fair share of fights in
the driveway. But dad, I won't even
play there's no chance there. He
still has it. Sister Ellie and I really get
into it, and Tres, you know he's really
just sprouting up. He's gonna be
quite the player himself. He's 6-foot
-4 and my mom calls me up, tells me
he's tip-dunking in practice, [laugh
ter] I'm afraid to play him when I go
back home. So I guess I don't know
who really wins.

TSD: What was it like playing for
Team USA in the 2008 FIB A Amer
icas Championship?

JT: It was just amazing. That was the
first time I met Nneka and Sarah
Boothe who were my USA team
mates. But coming in as a younger
member in that group was one the
best experiences ever. Winning that
gold medal, standing up there was
just one of the proudest moments I
have ever had.

Junior forward Joslyn Tinkle scored a
career-high 19 points and chipped in nine
rebounds in the Cardinal's latest win over
UC-Davis. We caught up with the Mis
soula, Mont, native to ask her about this
year's Stanford team and all things bas
ketball.

Stanford Daily (TSD):This year the team
has undergone a couple of changes with
an infusion of youth from the big fresh

man class. What is the team dynamic and
what kind of role have you taken on as
one of the veterans?
Joslyn Tinkle (JT): I think that's just
something that we as upperclassmen did
a really good job of, making sure to
smooth the transition. Over the summer a
lot of us were here helping the freshmen
out. And it is a big advantage for them to
come in here, before their freshmen year,
to kind of get acquainted with everything,

kind of get going in the system. We
worked really hard and they pick up
things really quickly, which is nice.
We didn't know what to expect, with
six freshmen it's practically half our
team, but it's been great.
And for me, coming in as an up
perclassman, you have a kind of dif
ferent game about you, a different
mentality. You want to lead and help
these younger kids out as well as be
contributors and work with the
teammates you've been around for
longer. I would say it is more fun to
be an upperclassman, though.

TSD: What are some of your person
al goals this season?

JT: You know, for me, it's been a lit
tle bit different in that coming in as
a freshman, I played a lot inside, be
hind Jayne Appel and [Nnemkadi
Ogwumike], and then last year I
was a little more on the perimeter,
even starting the year at the two
guard. Fm really thankful that Fm
able to be a little more versatile and
[head coach] Tara [VanDerveer]
puts me out there wherever she re
ally needs me.
It's really about whatever it takes
to be out on the court. I mean, who
doesn't love being in the game? I try
to go out there and do my best and
fulfill my role. And this year I feel
like I'm gaining a little more confi
dence as a contributor, and finding a
role for myself, whether it's inside
playing with my back to the basket or
being able to step out a little more
where I can look inside to those Og
wumike sisters who can just jump
out of the gym [laughter].

TSD: How nice is it playing for a
coach with VanDerveer's pedigree
and track record?

JT: Tara has had tremendous success
here at Stanford. She really knows
what it takes to be a top team and
compete at this caliber of competi
tion. And she is a really good re
cruiter. Everyone I've been fortu
nate enough to play with over my
past three years has made it truly like
a family we are a sisterhood. It's
not a show and we aren't lying when
we say we're best friends on and off
the court. I feel like that's something
she does a really good job of, recruit
ing not only really good basketball
players but good people. She's smart
in that, and she's definitely doing
things right, otherwise we wouldn't
have this kind of success.
