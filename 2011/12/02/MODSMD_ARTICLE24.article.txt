## WORST MOVIE SEQUELS 
### 
Thanksgiving Week was a good time for sequels. "The Muppets"
netted an enviable 98-percent "Fresh" rating on Rotten
Tomatoes, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim vaulted an already ven
erable property to ever-higher critical acclaim. So successful were
these sequels, in fact, that it's easy to forget that most sequels
are, at best, half-baked retreads. Here are five of the worst
offenders, collapsed souffles of pure dreck that sucked us in with
promises of greatness only to . . . well, to suck.
"Evan Almighty"
Quick, what comes to mind when you think "the climax of a comedy
movie"? If you thought "shameless pontification against corporate
greed or something," then congratulations, this is the movie for you.
"Evan Almighty" isn't a failure on every level, just on the one level that
counts for a comedy movie: being funny.

"Speed 2: Cruise Control"
"Speed" is not a classic by any measure, though it is a solidly enter
taining action movie. So if "Speed" is a masterpiece with shades of
Tarantino, then its sequel set on a cruise ship, otherwise known as a
vehicle that literally cannot go faster than a residential speed limit
falls somewhere on the lower end of the Dennis Dugan spectrum.
He's the guy that directed "Jack & Jill," by the way.
"Batman & Robin"
At one point in the movie, co-antagonist Mr. Freeze queries our
heroes, "What killed the dinosaurs?" That his answer is the groan
inducing pun "the Ice Age" makes it abundantly clear why any
answer other than "this movie" is an egregious oversight. Another
reason? Nipples. On the Batsuit. The only consolation? Batman was
shelved until "Batman Begins" because of it.
"Home Alone 3"
An unsuspecting viewer who sees "The Pacifier" will likely be more
than a little surprised that the villains are, ultimately, North Korean ter
rorists. Apparently this trope is older than that viewer would imagine,
because the same conceit is at the heart of this Macaulay Culkin-less
(and Christmas-less) sequel to the now-classic staples of the '9os.
Every character in this movie is new, which just gives viewers even less
of a reason to care about the same exact antics as the first two.
"Spider-Man 3"
Moviegoers flocked in droves to see Spidey battle some more enemies
in some more awesome superhero action. Instead, they got Tobey
Maguire sporting an emo look and attitude for about 45 action-less
minutes before he fought a really emotional guy made of sand but

somehow still dangerous. Also Venom. And the New Goblin.

With so many villains, it's amazing how
boring and bad â€”this movie was.
