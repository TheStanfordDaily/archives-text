Can girls have sex with girls? Do Emirati
princesses eat fried dates on sticks? Why is it
that only girls are called over-achievers? Blair
or Serena? These are but few of the questions that
may enter the mind when watching "The Winifred
Bennett Academy For Not-So-Little Princesses," the
senior project of drama student Kristen Elizabeth
Gura 'l2.
The play finds the world of The Winifred
Bennett Academy an elite boarding school bent on
molding its all-girl student body into socialites with

diamond validations shaken by the arrival of its
very first foreign exchange student, an Arabic
princess. Protagonist Tiffany Soleste (Max Sosna-
Spear '11), must sort out her own anxieties of youth,
sexuality and success while dealing with all the press
ing issues of womanhood like evading predators of
the dance floor hunt, discerning what exactly "hook
ing up" really means, and just how one can gracefully
confront the Other Woman.
Lyric McHenry 'l4 plays Princess Nadia with a
broken English that brings a sense of foreign playful
ness to the kindergarten wisdom of the play that any
Stanford student can relate to. Adding to the competi
tion between Tiffany and Nadia, a rebellious debu
tante Winny (Bronwyn Reed 'l2) and the sensuous
Southern Belle (Xandra Clark 'l4) engage in a con
fusing liaison that becomes a love triangle, then
square, then pentagon, in a hilarious debacle of bliss
ful ignorance and painful maturation all too familiar
in the lives of most young women.
Gura staged the reading with a tongue-in-cheek
nod to her own boarding school experience (she
attended Phillips Exeter Academy), with precious
matching uniforms and sparkling pink accents. Her
fresh look into the comedic culture of estrogen-heavy
breeding zones comes together with the innovative
structure in a happy marriage of laughter and reso
nant meaning.
"Everything about [Tiffany] is so true and
honest even through this convoluted lens, she

struggles ... I think we all have anxieties
about being the best at the things we think
we're the best at," said Sosna-Spear 'll, the
male actor cast as the female protagonist.
Though Sosna-Spear dons the garb and
make-up of a lady, Gura made the decision to
stray from the "over-the-top drag" look and
instead opt for a post-gender portrayal that
focused on talent.
"I wanted to play it with a gender-blind
casting decision. To be completely honest, it
wasn't really a deep philosophical reason for
making Tiffany Soleste a man [played by Max],
it was basically... a great actor expressed inter
est in playing a girl and I have an idea for a play
let's put it together,"' Gura said.
"I learned at a really young age what was
expected ... in a professional working environ

ment, and that's something I have tried really

hard to bring to rehearsals and performances
here [at Stanford] ... People don't realize it's a
lot like a varsity athlete, our time commit
ment," Reed said, who has performed in pro
fessional productions since age eight.

She thinks "Winifred Bennett" has come
together harmoniously.
"I don't think we could get a better group
than the one we have because Kristen wrote it
with us in mind ... I do think [Stanford] is
sort of the ideal venue for it, it being her senior
project and us being all so close together," Reed
said.

Perhaps the most powerful adages and
laughs come from Sosna-Spear's portrayal of
the pathologically proper young lady as com
pared to McHenry's inquisitive intruder, show

ing the culture clash of the American princess

and the actual princess.
"The princess element was added last. My
favorite director in the whole world, Andy
Fickman, has called me 'Princess' since I started
interning for him ... I kind of decided, a la his
inspiration one day, 'I should make this
princess themed,'" Gura said.
Andy Fickman ("She's the Man," "The
Game Plan") spoke last year as a guest lecture
and has mentored Gura for several years.
"I pay homage to Andy in Act 2, Scene 4.5
titled 'She's the Man'... He has been in my
career path. He's been a huge influence and
really positive; I think you always need that one
person who almost believes in you more than
you believe in yourself," Gura said.
Gura's passion and talent for the stage seep

off the page and into the laughter that will
surely permeate Nitery this weekend.
"It's going to be something that every girl
on this campus can relate to ... I think there's
literally something for everyone."
And if that's not enough to get an audi
ence in the seats, Gura goads, "Girls will be
making out!"
"The Winifred Bennett Academy For Not-So-
Little-Princesses" runs Dec. 1-3 at 7p.m. each
night in the Nitery.
