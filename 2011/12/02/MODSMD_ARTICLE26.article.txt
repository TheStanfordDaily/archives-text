Can girls have sex with girls? Do Emirati
princesses eat fried dates on sticks? Why is it
that only girls are called over-achievers? Blair
or Serena? These are but few of the questions that
may enter the mind when watching "The Winifred
Bennett Academy For Not-So-Little Princesses," the
senior project of drama student Kristen Elizabeth
Gura 'l2.
The play finds the world of The Winifred
Bennett Academy an elite boarding school bent on
molding its all-girl student body into socialites with

diamond validations shaken by the arrival of its
very first foreign exchange student, an Arabic
princess. Protagonist Tiffany Soleste (Max Sosna-

tante Winny (Bronwyn Reed 'l2) and the sensuous
Southern Belle (Xandra Clark 'l4) engage in a con
fusing liaison that becomes a love triangle, then
square, then pentagon, in a hilarious debacle of bliss

in the lives of most young women.
Gura staged the reading with a tongue-in-cheek
nod to her own boarding school experience (she
attended Phillips Exeter Academy), with precious
matching uniforms and sparkling pink accents. Her
fresh look into the comedic culture of estrogen-heavy
breeding zones comes together with the innovative
structure in a happy marriage of laughter and reso
