## 'FELA!' FAILS TO DELVE DEEP 
### â€” alexandra HEENEY contact alexandra: aheeney@stanford. edu 
The new Broadway musical, "Fela!", has
some fun dance numbers but is largely
a disastrous, disconnected and misogy
nistic production about the life of Nigerian
Afrobeat superstar and political activist Fela
Anikulapo Kuti. It takes place in the African
Shrine, a nightclub in Nigeria where Fela (Sahr
Ngaujah) is giving his final concert and telling
his life story through the songs that he wrote.
"Fela!" delivers a glorious spectacle with
impressive percussive afrobeats and delicious
dancing, but the play is so desultory that if
there is a message, it gets lost in the jumble.
Without a coherent storyline, the production is
disorienting. It doesn't establish tone appropri
ately. The dance numbers are so vivacious, fun
and sexual, that it's unnerving when we hear
excruciating details about how Fela's wives
were tortured in the second act: all signs in the
first act pointed towards this being a generally
light production.
Even when the production gets serious, it

gets serious about characters who have never
been developed and that we have never learned
to care for: Fela's wives are indistinguishable,
scantily clad background dancers without per
sonality, and his mother (Melanie Marshall) is

treated as an idolized savior. While the atroci
ties committed against them are atrocious by
any standards, the play lacks the poignancy that
it could have had if any of them had been
developed into more than cliches of the mes
sianic mother and the whorish wives. The only
character in the play with any development
and even that is shallow is Fela, our obnox
ious host.
"Fela!" is never fully able to create an emo
tional connection because the entirety of the
story occurs in an isolated place the African
Shrine and is guided by Fela, a largely isolat
ed figure: we rarely see signs of the poor state
of the world seeping into the Shrine. Most of
the audience is not already well-versed in
Nigerian history, making it difficult to guess at

the important historical events that are occur
ring when the play is set. The play doesn't even
provide subtle hints of these. Without the out
side world seeping into Fela's world in the
African Shrine, there is no context. And with
out context, it's impossible to understand how
the world is affecting Fela and how he is effect
ing change in it.
It's not an impossible task to achieve this
harmony between the story of Fela and his
connection to that of Nigeria. Consider
"Cabaret," a play about people and politics, in
many ways the predecessor to "Fela!", where the
emcee is our guide here Fela is our emcee.
In "Cabaret," we get to know the characters well
as three-dimensional, realistic people. The rea
son "Cabaret" is so heartbreaking and moving
is that we get to see how the influence of the
Nazis is slowly seeping into their world and
impacting their lives: the merry singing and
