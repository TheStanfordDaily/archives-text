## NO 'SHAME'IN NC-17 
### â€” misa SHIKUMA contact misa: mshikuma@stanford. edu 
My mind was reeling as I left the the
ater in early September after a
screening of British director Steve
McQueen's newest feature, a provocative
drama entided "Shame." On the surface,
"Shame" is about a man with a sex addiction
but taps into the paradoxically isolating nature
of modern, high-tech society in surprising
ways. Unfortunately, it's the first part that's
been getting the most attention, and having
seen the film, I can't say that I blame people.
Oscar-worthy performances by stars Michael
Fassbender and Carey Mulligan aside, my ini
tial reaction was to wonder who would be
brave enough to distribute it in a climate much
friendlier toward heads being blown off than a
hint of below-the-belt nudity. Fortunately, Fox
Searchlight Pictures stepped up to the plate,
and "Shame" hits theaters today in limited
release under an NC-17 rating.

Short for "No One 17 and Under
Admitted," NC-17 joined the ratings ranks in
1990 after then-president of the Motion
Picture Association of America (MPAA) Jack
Valenti decided that a growing number of films

possessed content too strong to merit a mere
Restricted (R) rating. As for the lengthy
moniker, "X" had already been embraced by
the pornographic industry. The irony here is
that despite the film industry's attempt not to
conflate NC-17 and X, the stigma remains, giv
ing rise to phenomena like Unrated, usually
given to an uncut version of a film whose film
makers have surrendered an initial NC-17 rat
ing, and Not Rated, when a film is not submit
ted to the MPAA at all and thus is likewise an
evasion tactic.
There have been some 200 films rated as
NC-17, although this number is slightly skewed
by those that subsequently appealed to receive
R status. The point is that the number is inten
tionally low, because for a majority of film
makers and distributors, NC-17 is like a death
sentence with limited prospects for advertising
and exhibition. Speaking to the Associated
Press recently, John Fithian, president of the
National Association of Theatre Owners,
reported that, according to a survey, 97 out of
100 theaters would play an NC-17 film and
further stressed that the fear of the rating is

unwarranted. So what makes "Shame" a poten
tial game changer?
First of all, McQueen is a true artist who
was recently awarded Commander of the Order
of the British Empire for his decades-long
career in London's art world prior to making
his acclaimed feature-film debut in 2008 with
"Hunger." In the past several months, "Shame"
has generated plenty of buzz on the festival cir
cuit, beginning with a strong debut at the

Venice Film Festival that earned
prizes for Best Film as well as the
Volpi Cup for Fassbender as Best

Actor. Critics continue to laud the film heading
into awards season, and so far, the team has
been promoting it as though on campaign. In
addition to the requisite press engagements, just
days ago, Fassbender was on hand at the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences'
Governors Awards along with other Oscar
hopefuls sent by their respective studios. If

Fassbender were to receive a nomination, it
could be a big step in revitalizing the image of a
rating that never should have gotten such a bad
rap in the first place.
Furthermore, where others would have
appealed or re-cut the film, McQueen and Fox
Searchlight have embraced the picture's NC-17
status. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter
during their annual directors roundtable,
McQueen stated that he found "Shame" to be
"not particularly" shocking.
"We all have sex, we all see what Michael
and Carey have, as far as being naked," he elab
orated. "What's unfamiliar, at least to me, is
someone with a gun shooting someone in the
head. I think we made a film that was responsi
ble. I don't care NC-17? Brilliant! Fantastic!
Bring it on! I take full responsibility for it. I
think most violent films are not responsible ...
Films should reflect real life. Otherwise, what's
the point?"
In an interview with New York Magazine,
Fassbender similarly defended his character's

nudity, saying that, "Yeah, and some of us have
[penises] and most of the rest have seen them,
so what's the big deal?" Going a step further to
address the sexism intrinsic to the ratings sys
tem, he also complained that, "Women can
parade around naked all the time, but the guy
conveniently has his pants on."
Just last year, Derek Cianffance's "Blue
Valentine," backed by the venerable Weinstein
Company, appealed to get its NC-17 rating
reduced to an R. The content in question? A
scene in which a man goes down on his girl-

friend. The filmmakers were successful, but just
think about how many unquestionably R-rated
movies you've seen in which a man receives a
blowjob.
It also deserves to be noted that the sexual
acts depicted in both "Shame" and "Blue
Valentine" are decidedly un-erotic. Yes, the
scenes are graphic and reveal more skin, but
unlike their campy R-rated counterparts, these
portrayals are disturbing and uncomfortable to
watch perhaps because they appear to be so
eerily realistic rather than merely performanc
es. Still, for those who still equate NC-17 with
X, the rating makes the material seem more tit
illating, and, in this instance, undeservedly so.
Of course, change won't come all at once,
but at the very least, "Shame" promises to
expand the ratings discussion. If it can play well
to audiences outside the industry and help legit
imize the NC-17 rating, the effects could be far
reaching. Many have commented upon the "rat
ings creep," a trend in which the amount of

harsh content (language, nudi
ty, violence, etc.) in each rat-

ings category increases over

time, but in truth, these broad ranges, particu
larly in the R domain, result from hasty re-cuts
in avoidance of what might actually be the more
appropriate rating. Not just the portrayal of
"taboo" subjects, but the very artistic integrity of
the medium itself is at stake.

"I think NC-17 is a badge of honor, not a
scarlet letter," Searchlight President Steve Gilula
declared to The Hollywood Reporter just last
month. Speaking highly of McQueen's work,
he added that, "It's not a film that everyone will
take easily, but it certainly breaks through the
clutter and is distinctive and original."
Here's to hoping that "Shame" carries that
badge all the way to the Academy Awards in
February and perhaps, along the way, encour
ages other filmmakers not to compromise their
vision.

Valentine" are decidedly un-erotic. Yes, the
scenes are graphic and reveal more skin, but
unlike their campy R-rated counterparts, these
portrayals are disturbing and uncomfortable to
watch perhaps because they appear to be so
eerily realistic rather than merely performanc
es. Still, for those who still equate NC-17 with
X, the rating makes the material seem more tit
illating, and, in this instance, undeservedly so.
Of course, change won't come all at once,
but at the very least, "Shame" promises to
expand the ratings discussion. If it can play well
to audiences outside the industry and help legit
imize the NC-17 rating, the effects could be far
reaching. Many have commented upon the "rat
ings creep," a trend in which the amount of

harsh content (language, nudi
ty, violence, etc.) in each rat-

ings category increases over

time, but in truth, these broad ranges, particu
larly in the R domain, result from hasty re-cuts
in avoidance of what might actually be the more
appropriate rating. Not just the portrayal of
"taboo" subjects, but the very artistic integrity of
the medium itself is at stake.

"I think NC-17 is a badge of honor, not a
scarlet letter," Searchlight President Steve Gilula
declared to The Hollywood Reporter just last
month. Speaking highly of McQueen's work,
he added that, "It's not a film that everyone will
take easily, but it certainly breaks through the
clutter and is distinctive and original."
Here's to hoping that "Shame" carries that
badge all the way to the Academy Awards in
February and perhaps, along the way, encour
ages other filmmakers not to compromise their
vision.

My mind was reeling as I left the the
ater in early September after a
screening of British director Steve
McQueen's newest feature, a provocative
drama entided "Shame." On the surface,
"Shame" is about a man with a sex addiction
but taps into the paradoxically isolating nature
of modern, high-tech society in surprising
ways. Unfortunately, it's the first part that's
been getting the most attention, and having
seen the film, I can't say that I blame people.
Oscar-worthy performances by stars Michael
Fassbender and Carey Mulligan aside, my ini
tial reaction was to wonder who would be
brave enough to distribute it in a climate much
friendlier toward heads being blown off than a
hint of below-the-belt nudity. Fortunately, Fox
Searchlight Pictures stepped up to the plate,
and "Shame" hits theaters today in limited
release under an NC-17 rating.

Short for "No One 17 and Under
Admitted," NC-17 joined the ratings ranks in
1990 after then-president of the Motion
Picture Association of America (MPAA) Jack
Valenti decided that a growing number of films

possessed content too strong to merit a mere
Restricted (R) rating. As for the lengthy
moniker, "X" had already been embraced by
the pornographic industry. The irony here is
that despite the film industry's attempt not to
conflate NC-17 and X, the stigma remains, giv
ing rise to phenomena like Unrated, usually
given to an uncut version of a film whose film
makers have surrendered an initial NC-17 rat
ing, and Not Rated, when a film is not submit
ted to the MPAA at all and thus is likewise an
evasion tactic.
There have been some 200 films rated as
NC-17, although this number is slightly skewed
by those that subsequently appealed to receive
R status. The point is that the number is inten
tionally low, because for a majority of film
makers and distributors, NC-17 is like a death
sentence with limited prospects for advertising
and exhibition. Speaking to the Associated
Press recently, John Fithian, president of the
National Association of Theatre Owners,
reported that, according to a survey, 97 out of
100 theaters would play an NC-17 film and
further stressed that the fear of the rating is

unwarranted. So what makes "Shame" a poten
tial game changer?
First of all, McQueen is a true artist who
was recently awarded Commander of the Order
of the British Empire for his decades-long
career in London's art world prior to making
his acclaimed feature-film debut in 2008 with
"Hunger." In the past several months, "Shame"
has generated plenty of buzz on the festival cir
cuit, beginning with a strong debut at the

Venice Film Festival that earned
prizes for Best Film as well as the
Volpi Cup for Fassbender as Best

Actor. Critics continue to laud the film heading
into awards season, and so far, the team has
been promoting it as though on campaign. In
addition to the requisite press engagements, just
days ago, Fassbender was on hand at the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences'
Governors Awards along with other Oscar
hopefuls sent by their respective studios. If

Fassbender were to receive a nomination, it
could be a big step in revitalizing the image of a
rating that never should have gotten such a bad
rap in the first place.
Furthermore, where others would have
appealed or re-cut the film, McQueen and Fox
Searchlight have embraced the picture's NC-17
status. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter
during their annual directors roundtable,
McQueen stated that he found "Shame" to be
"not particularly" shocking.
"We all have sex, we all see what Michael
and Carey have, as far as being naked," he elab
orated. "What's unfamiliar, at least to me, is
someone with a gun shooting someone in the
head. I think we made a film that was responsi
ble. I don't care NC-17? Brilliant! Fantastic!
Bring it on! I take full responsibility for it. I
think most violent films are not responsible ...
Films should reflect real life. Otherwise, what's
the point?"
In an interview with New York Magazine,
Fassbender similarly defended his character's

nudity, saying that, "Yeah, and some of us have
[penises] and most of the rest have seen them,
so what's the big deal?" Going a step further to
address the sexism intrinsic to the ratings sys
tem, he also complained that, "Women can
parade around naked all the time, but the guy
conveniently has his pants on."
Just last year, Derek Cianffance's "Blue
Valentine," backed by the venerable Weinstein
Company, appealed to get its NC-17 rating
reduced to an R. The content in question? A
scene in which a man goes down on his girl-

friend. The filmmakers were successful, but just
think about how many unquestionably R-rated
movies you've seen in which a man receives a
blowjob.
It also deserves to be noted that the sexual
acts depicted in both "Shame" and "Blue
Valentine" are decidedly un-erotic. Yes, the
