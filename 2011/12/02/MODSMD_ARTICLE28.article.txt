## NO 'SHAME'IN NC-17 
### â€” misa SHIKUMA contact misa: mshikuma@stanford. edu 
My mind was reeling as I left the the
ater in early September after a
screening of British director Steve
McQueen's newest feature, a provocative
drama entided "Shame." On the surface,
"Shame" is about a man with a sex addiction
but taps into the paradoxically isolating nature
of modern, high-tech society in surprising
ways. Unfortunately, it's the first part that's
been getting the most attention, and having
seen the film, I can't say that I blame people.
Oscar-worthy performances by stars Michael
Fassbender and Carey Mulligan aside, my ini
tial reaction was to wonder who would be
brave enough to distribute it in a climate much
friendlier toward heads being blown off than a
hint of below-the-belt nudity. Fortunately, Fox
Searchlight Pictures stepped up to the plate,
and "Shame" hits theaters today in limited
release under an NC-17 rating.

Short for "No One 17 and Under
Admitted," NC-17 joined the ratings ranks in
1990 after then-president of the Motion
Picture Association of America (MPAA) Jack
Valenti decided that a growing number of films

possessed content too strong to merit a mere
Restricted (R) rating. As for the lengthy
moniker, "X" had already been embraced by
the pornographic industry. The irony here is
that despite the film industry's attempt not to
conflate NC-17 and X, the stigma remains, giv
ing rise to phenomena like Unrated, usually
given to an uncut version of a film whose film
makers have surrendered an initial NC-17 rat
ing, and Not Rated, when a film is not submit
ted to the MPAA at all and thus is likewise an
evasion tactic.
There have been some 200 films rated as
NC-17, although this number is slightly skewed
by those that subsequently appealed to receive
R status. The point is that the number is inten
tionally low, because for a majority of film
makers and distributors, NC-17 is like a death
sentence with limited prospects for advertising
and exhibition. Speaking to the Associated
Press recently, John Fithian, president of the
National Association of Theatre Owners,
reported that, according to a survey, 97 out of
100 theaters would play an NC-17 film and
further stressed that the fear of the rating is

unwarranted. So what makes "Shame" a poten
tial game changer?
First of all, McQueen is a true artist who
was recently awarded Commander of the Order
of the British Empire for his decades-long
career in London's art world prior to making
his acclaimed feature-film debut in 2008 with
"Hunger." In the past several months, "Shame"
has generated plenty of buzz on the festival cir
cuit, beginning with a strong debut at the

Venice Film Festival that earned
prizes for Best Film as well as the
Volpi Cup for Fassbender as Best

Actor. Critics continue to laud the film heading
into awards season, and so far, the team has
been promoting it as though on campaign. In
addition to the requisite press engagements, just
days ago, Fassbender was on hand at the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences'
Governors Awards along with other Oscar
hopefuls sent by their respective studios. If
