Michael Crichton, the world
renowned author of science-thriller
classics "Jurassic Park" and "The
Andromeda Strain," passed away three years
ago but left behind the bones of his last

novel. After the first third of the book was dis
covered in his papers, his publisher and agent
engaged Richard Preston, bestselling author of
"The Hot Zone," to write the rest of Crichton's
unfinished novel. This much-anticipated

posthumous collaboration, "Micro," was
released just before Thanksgiving.
Part tech-thriller and part wilderness
adventure, "Micro" is the story of seven gradu
ate researchers at a Harvard biology lab who go
on a recruiting trip to Nanigen

Micro Technologies, headquartered in Hawaii.
One of them, Peter Jansen, has a personal con
nection to the company in the form of his
elder brother Eric, a vice president at the firm.
There is, as Peter soon discovers, more to the

situation than meets the eye; Eric texts Peter

the cryptic message "don't come" the day he
dies in a suspicious boating accident. The grad
students, however, ignore the warning and fly
to Hawaii, where Peter unveils an incriminating
phone conversation (itself obtained illegally) in
an attempt to force Nanigen CEO Yin Drake to

admit to murdering Eric. Drake, anxious to
cover up his misdeeds, uses Nanigen's latest
innovation to shrink all seven grad students
(and one unlucky Nanigen employee) to the
size of pinheads, and he intends to kill them.

What ensues is a brutal race for survival in
the Hawaiian forest, as they race to return
unnoticed to Nanigen headquarters and use
the machine to restore themselves to their nat
ural sizes. One cannot help but be reminded of
"Jurassic Park;" to people only millimeters tall,
every insect is a threat the size of
Tyrannosaurus Rex. They find themselves
evading not only birds and spiders, but also
Drake's corporate assassins, sent to eliminate
them as soon as they are discovered missing.
"Micro" does not escape some of the pit
falls common to the thriller genre, including
that of sacrificing character development in
favor of premise and plot. Most of the main
characters fall into neat stereotypes: the sancti
monious academic elitist, the feisty female
martial arts expert, the cowardly turncoat and
perhaps the flattest stock character of all, the
evil CEO who will stop at nothing to sate his
greed. As the story progresses and the protago
nists are picked off one by one in gruesome
encounters with the local fauna, the reader is

hardly surprised that with one notable
exception the less important characters are
first to die. The plot, too, is a little thin; for all
the corporate intrigue and international
impacts it promises, most of the book chroni
cles the students' journey through the forest,
almost like a reality television show where a
character is eliminated permanently
every few chapters. "Micro" provides the occa

sional adrenaline rush, but it soon becomes
somewhat predictable.
What really shines in "Micro" is the eco
logical detail. The sheer variety and specificity
of the oversized predators in the book hint at
the amount of research that must have been
conducted while writing it. The grad students
each have their own area of expertise, ranging
from toxins to arachnids to indigenous medi
cine, and these specialized bodies of knowledge
come in handy as they encounter relevant

threats the authors painstakingly describe
the various ways in which predators are neu
tralized. Although this particular element con
tributes greatly to the verisimilitude of the plot,
it simply isn't enough.
Ultimately, "Micro" reads more like a very
detailed summary of a book (albeit with some
cinematic action sequences tossed in) than an
actual book which is likely not far from the
truth. It is, one might imagine, difficult to co
write with a dead man; this reader would not be
surprised if Preston wrote his way through
Crichton's copious notes, thinking, "I hope that's
what he meant."
