## Cooper defends aid policy Stanford's policy may hurt low-income students 
### CHRISTOPHER KREMER 
Stanford's policy to waive the tu
ition of students whose family in
comes are below $lOO,OOO helps these
students afford college; however, fig
ures from College Board suggest it
may also take money away from less
wealthy students at other universities.
A Nov. 24 article published in
USA Today examined the connec
tion between elite universities, such as
Stanford, offering generous financial
aid to families that make upwards of
double the average income in the
United States, and how this causes
other universities to offer similar
packages to remain competitive.
However at other universities, in
creasing aid to these families can
mean cutting aid to those who are
more in need.
"That's certainly possible that
other institutions would feel pres
sured," said Karen Cooper, director
of Financial Aid at Stanford. "They're
competing on a lot of levels. That's
one piece of everything that there is
to compete about."
Stanford's Financial Aid Office
says that its first responsibility is to
provide for its students' families.
"Students who are admitted
should be able to attend without
bankrupting our families," Cooper
said. "At an institution with a healthy
endowment, I feel like we have a re
sponsibility to ensure that our fami
lies of the students are able to attend
Stanford."
In the 2010-2011 academic year,
Stanford charged $40,050 for tuition,
$957 in required fees and $12,291 for
room and board. The Financial Aid
Office guarantees to waive the full
price tag for students from families
with an annual income of under
$60,000, and it guarantees to waive
the price of tuition for students from
families with an annual income of
under $lOO,OOO.

There is no cutoff for how much fi
nancial aid the University gives to its
undergraduates. Aid for students
from families with incomes of
$lOO,OOO and over is calculated on a
case-by-case basis.
"A family that makes $150,000
but has $1 million in assets and one
kid in a family wouldn't qualify for
aid at all," Cooper said. 'A family that
has $200,000 that has six kids where
two are in college and two will be in
college in the next couple years
would probably qualify for at least
some help."
If there is any competition over
admitted undergraduates, according
to the Financial Aid Office, it is over
low-income students. Much of this
competition is between Stanford and
other elite universities such as Har
vard and Yale.

In 2008 the Financial Aid Office
developed its current formula for dis
tributing aid in order to attract more
students from low-income families to
apply for undergraduate admission
to Stanford.
A little more than half of students
apply for financial aid at Stanford.
While around 30 percent of under
graduates come from families that
makes less than $lOO,OOO a year, they
receive 70 percent of all aid dis-

persed.
"I can say wholeheartedly that
Stanford's need-based financial aid
has changed my life," said Brittany
Rose Foerster 'l2. "It is the reason
why lam here ... among other ex
tenuating reasons and circum
stances."
"The amount of aid offered to me
made coming to Stanford the cheap
est option out of all the rest of the
schools that I applied to and they
were all in-state," Foerster said.
"Our first priority is to help our
lowest income families," Cooper said.
"We want to make sure that every
one is admitted has enough money to
attend."
