## Cooper defends aid policy Stanford's policy may hurt low-income students 
### CHRISTOPHER KREMER 
Stanford's policy to waive the tu
ition of students whose family in
comes are below $lOO,OOO helps these
students afford college; however, fig
ures from College Board suggest it
may also take money away from less
wealthy students at other universities.
A Nov. 24 article published in
USA Today examined the connec
tion between elite universities, such as
Stanford, offering generous financial
aid to families that make upwards of
double the average income in the
United States, and how this causes
other universities to offer similar
packages to remain competitive.
However at other universities, in
creasing aid to these families can
mean cutting aid to those who are
more in need.
"That's certainly possible that
other institutions would feel pres
sured," said Karen Cooper, director
of Financial Aid at Stanford. "They're
competing on a lot of levels. That's
one piece of everything that there is
to compete about."
Stanford's Financial Aid Office
says that its first responsibility is to
provide for its students' families.
"Students who are admitted
should be able to attend without
bankrupting our families," Cooper
said. "At an institution with a healthy
endowment, I feel like we have a re
sponsibility to ensure that our fami
lies of the students are able to attend
Stanford."
In the 2010-2011 academic year,
Stanford charged $40,050 for tuition,
$957 in required fees and $12,291 for
room and board. The Financial Aid
Office guarantees to waive the full
price tag for students from families
