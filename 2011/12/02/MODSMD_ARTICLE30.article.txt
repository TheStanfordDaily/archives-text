Director Steve McQueen
reunites with actor Michael
Fassbender for his sopho
more feature "Shame," a grim story of
a closeted sex addict whose carefully
controlled private life is thrown off
balance with the arrival of his way
ward younger sister.
Brandon (Fassbender) is a 30-
something bachelor living in New
York City who frequently engages in
casual sex, pornography and mastur
bation; anything, really, that can get
him off, as it immediately becomes
apparent that he needs it just to feel
something. A successful business exec
utive by day, Brandon is almost
Patrick Bateman-like in his meticulous
privacy and lack of affect. The title
reflects the vicious cycle he puts him
self through wherein, unable to con
nect with others on a personal level, he
juggles a myriad of physical relation
ships to try to fill the void inside.
But when Sissy (Carey
Mulligan), an aspiring singer and
hill-time drifter, shows up unexpect
edly on his doorstep with nowhere
else to stay, Brandon becomes even
more withdrawn. His sister's pres
ence makes Brandon more self-con

scious of his perverse nature, and her
repeated attempts to strengthen their
sibling bond only push him further
into the city's underbelly in order to
get the satisfaction he craves. Neither
sibling can afford to continue living
as they have been, and it is only a
matter of time before tensions reach
a boiling point.
Fassbender gives a restrained and
almost-menacing performance as
Brandon, a man who seems to act on
his moment-to-moment thoughts
rather than responding to normal psy
chosocial stimuli. Mulligan, through
roles like Sissy, is growing up and
breaking out of the girlish mold that
first put her on the map with the suc
cess of2oo9's "An Education," for which
she earned an Oscar nomination. But
not only does "Shame" showcase
Mulligan's acting chops, her character's
haunting rendition of "New York, New
York" at a nightclub is also one of the
film's most memorable scenes.
Just like his debut feature
"Hunger" (2008), "Shame" brings
out McQueen's uncanny ability to
speak volumes without words, no
doubt a product of his background
as an artist dealing in experimental

film. Relying on powerful imagery
and brilliantly crafted montages, the
director establishes Brandon's New
York City as one that is sparse and
cold, a marked departure from the
urban pinnacle that usually graces
the screen.
The minimalist aesthetic carries
over into the depictions of the sexual
act, giving off a raw carnality sans
passion and emotion. Sex is not sexy
for Brandon; there are only his pri
mal needs and desires that need be

satiated. Fassbender boldly bares all
for the role, a refreshing change
from Hollywood's strong tendency
toward female objectification. This is
not to say that Brandon's conquests
are spared by the camera, but rather
that McQueen treats his actors more
fairly across gender lines than other
directors (I'm talking to you,
Michael Bay.)
While "Shame" has enjoyed
positive critical responses on the fes
tival circuit, it remains to be seen

how its decidedly NC-17 material
will influence a distribution deal in
America, where extreme violence is
much more tolerated than extreme
sexuality. One can only hope that
McQueen will not be asked to com
promise his artistic vision, and if the
film finds its way to a theater near
you, I would highly encourage giv
ing it a chance.
