## The
						rise, fall and rise of gaming creativity

We're still in the thick of the holi
day release schedule, and game
critics around the Net are already
calling out Fall 2011 as one of the best sea
sons in video game history. As someone
who just stayed up until 5 a.m. pickpocket-

ing townsfolk in Skyrim and
took his Wii across the country
just to play Skyward Sword over
Thanksgiving break, I can't say I
entirely disagree it's an

incredible time to be a gamer. But calling it
the best season in history makes light of an
often unnoticed trend that's more true
today than ever: developing a successful
video game is an art of iteration, not inno
vation.
Take a look at Metacritic's top
games of 2011, and you'll have to scroll
through a few pages before you see any
scores below 85. A strong year, indeed. But
you'd also be hard-pressed to find many
games without a "2," "3" or "HD" stuck in the
title, especially among major retail releases.
That point is easy to prove: between
Uncharted, Batman, Gears of War, Zelda,
Halo, Metal Gear Solid and Rayman, we're

inundated with sequels, remakes and
reboots. On its own, that isn't a problem.
What's a little more disconcerting to me is
that most of these games and there cer
tainly are exceptions fail to bring new, cre
ative ideas to the table. They're iterative.

They're safe. And as their brand
recognition continues to penetrate
the mainstream market, they're
successful.
Video games didn't always

suffer from sequelitis. Thinking back to some
of my favorite series from the NES days, it
seemed almost customary that every entry in
a franchise would try something fundamen
tally different. Zelda II introduced a larger
overwork! map, experience points and side
scrolling combat. Mario 2, at least in
America, had four playable characters, a life
meter and remember this? vegetable
picking. Castlevania II was almost an RPG,
Donkey Kong 3 was a shooter, Dig Dug II
and Contra Force had overhead perspectives
and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 intro
duced unique character attributes and a large
map to explore. Even the sequel to Tetris
Tetris! — gave players something different.
Back then, video games were in their
infancy. There weren't strict standards on
what a "franchise" meant, and the limitations
of simple sounds and graphics meant that

most of the variation from title to title need
ed to be in gameplay. It was a wild time,

when innovation mattered more than pres
entation or marketing, and financial risks

weren't as damning. Today, money is every
thing, and unsafe investments can put a lot
of people out of work.

When I reflect on the slow transition to
today's publisher-controlled, sequel-driven
market, my mind lingers on the downfall
perhaps too strong a word, but it's hard to
resist of two of my favorite game develop
ers from childhood: Rare and Square. In the
'9os, both studios balanced a signature style
of development between dozens of unique,
one-off experiments and established fran
chises alike. Both, however, are now mired in
creative stagnation. After it was sold to

Microsoft in 2003, it became clear that Rare's
quirky, off-center style couldn't survive in an
era when traditional, mascot-driven adven
tures were dying away in favor of online
death-matches and Hollywood wannabes.
Nowadays, Rare churns out painfully boring
Kinect games and updates for Microsoft's
online avatars. Square, meanwhile, can no
longer gamble on collaborative, creative ven
tures like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy
Tactics. Instead, it spends years at a time
pumping impressive visuals into otherwise
sterile experiences like Final Fantasy XIII, or
throws wholesale heaps of its older classics
onto PSN, WiiWare and iOS. For these sym
bols of a bygone era, the golden age this is
not.

Big-box creativity may be fading, but
that's not to say we live in an era devoid of
fresh ideas. In some ways, the opposite might
be true. Independent and small-budget
games, while sometimes hard to find amid
the flash-bangs and engine-rewing of the

holiday season, are easier than ever to devel
op and distribute. History is repeating itself
on a smaller scale as mobile and download
able games form their own ecosystem of

trial, error and reckless experimentation
the same environment that gave rise to so
many still-cherished franchises of the 'Bos
and '9os. Unless larger developers start taking
those same risks again, I can't bring myself to
say that gaming has never been better.

dazzled gamers back in 2005, builds every game around a strong artistic
vision. Sadly, most modern publishers won't back such ambitious projects.
