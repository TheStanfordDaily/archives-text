### â€“ halle EDWARDS contact halle: halle@stanford. edu 
With the recent release of
"The Twilight Saga:
Breaking Dawn Part 1,"
it's clear that the Twilight phenome
non is still gripping the nation. Still,
one can't help but notice the many
awkward moments in the film

from falling in love with a friend's
newborn baby to destructive vam
pire sex and the characters' often
even more awkward reactions.

Wondering how you would react to
these situations? Are you just as awk
ward as Bella or smooth as Jacob's
abs? Take our quiz to find out.
1) Your best friend and love of
your life is considering having
life-threatening sex with his/her
undead lover. Like any best

friend/wannabe lover, you feel
it's your duty to warn him/her.
What is the best place and

method to do so?

A. Calmly voicing,
your opinions
and concerns
either in a private
conversation in

person or via
telephone
B. Screaming

your warning in

front of his/her spouse

C. Screaming your warning at
his/her wedding

D. Both B and C
2) It's the night before your
wedding to the love of your
life. What do you do?
A. Go to your perfectly normal
(read: no killing of animals)
Bachelor/Bachelorette party,
obviously.
B. Ask pointed questions about your
future spouse's sexual history and
bachelor/bachelorette party plans.
C. Wait for him/her in his/her bed
room (uninvited) and tell him/her
about your mysterious past.
D. After showing up in his/her bed
room, unannounced, unload all the
details of your tragic past, including
your stint as a murderous vampire,
and any other deal-breakers you can
think of. Serial killing's no big deal if
it's just a phase, right?
3) Time for a wedding speech!
How do you keep it classy?

A. Warmly congratulate the bride
and groom and add a funny anec-

dote or two.

B. Use to the speech to subtly allude
to your own accomplishments or
express jealousy that you are not get
ting married right out of high
school.

C. Sing the bride/groom's favorite
nursery rhyme. Romantic, and
decidedly not creepy.
D. Allude to your immortal nature

and announce your plans to spend
forever together, even though most
of the guests are not vampires and
your talk of eternal soul-bonding
will just sound tacky.
4) Your wedding night has
arrived! How do you go about

getting down?
A. Sip cham
pagne in a fancy
hotel room.
B. Go skinny
dipping.
Romantic and
playful!
C. Go skinny-

dipping, alone, while waiting for
your spouse to freshen up. Nothing
says romance like chaste separation!
D. Retreat to the bathroom to brush
your teeth and shave your legs
because your spouse who just
pledged eternal love will no longer
love you if you have stubblies.
5) You wake up following a
night of passion to find your
hotel room in shambles. How

do you react?
A. Freak out and hire a divorce
lawyer.
B. Embrace your spouse's kinky side
but look into getting some sturdy
furniture for your future home.
C. Awkwardly ask, "Was it good for
you?"

D. Ignore the fact your body is cov
ered in nasty bruises and insist it was
the best night of your life.
6) The maid arrives and finds

the aforementioned, now
destroyed hotel room. What do
you tell her?

A. Make up some excuse and apolo
gize profusely.
B. Explain that the furniture was not
sturdy enough for your, ahem, galli
vanting, and apologize.

C. Avoid the maid as she cleans but
leave a large tip for her.
D. Make eye contact with the maid,
but don't explain what happened.
Slink away and laugh with your
spouse about it in the next room.
7) You find out that your best
friend is endangering her life
by carrying a monster-baby to
term. How do you cope?
A. Accept her decision and try and
support them.
B. Try to talk her out of it by explain
ing that most pregnancies don't
include bone-breaking, excruciating
pain, starvation and blood-drinking.
C. Try to scream her out of it, and

plan on storming out dramatically if
unsuccessful. Consider ripping off
your shirt in fury to drive home your
point.
D. Tell a bunch of ravenous animals
who already distrust your friend
about the scenario and see how they
react. Act surprised when they decide
to kill your friend.
8) Your life is in danger. Do you
tell your parents?
A. Of course! They care about me
and would want to be by my side.
B. Maybe. You don't want to freak
them out, but realize they should
probably know.
C. Probably not. You were never
close and you figure you'll get over
this whole monster-pregnancy thing
in a few weeks anyway.
D. Definitely no. You lie to your par

ents and tell them you're going to a
spa in Switzerland so they don't get
worried because you do that kind
of thing all the time.
9) Your wife just gave birth to a
monster-baby and is lying in
bed, dying. What do you do?
A. Rush her to a hospital to be treat
ed by properly trained doctors after
weeks of home remedies receiving
a blood transfusion would probably
be wiser than drinking blood at this
point.
B. Run to her side and make some
one call for an ambulance. Try to
keep her conscious.
C. Trust your doctor-dad to know
what to do, and in the meantime
perform CPR because that will
help with the blood loss.
D. Fondle the monster-baby for a few
minutes before noticing your wife is
dying, and then bite her in various
places in an attempt to turn her into
an immortal vampire.
10) You're seeing your best
friend's monster-baby for the
first time. What do you do?
A. Bring a nice gift for the bun
dle of joy.
B. Hold the baby politely and try not
to panic when it starts crying.
C. Congratulate your friend but
avoid holding the thing.
D. Envision your future together
with the baby and fall in love. It's not
creepy if the baby's nearly an adult in
my fantasies, right?
