Awkwardness rank:
10-15 points:
Social Savant
When life throws crazy events at
you, from vampire weddings to
weird pregnancies to monster
babies, you handle it all with grace
and humor. You're decidedly bereft
of Twilight-style awkwardness. Keep
on keeping it classy.

16-25 points:
Slightly awkward
You have your awkward moments,
but you generally know how to keep
weird situations from becoming
completely overblown.
26-35 points:
Jacob-level awkward
You tend to have unexpected out
bursts or awkward responses to
strange events, but your heart is
generally in the right place. You
might have trouble functioning

in daily life, but your rock-hard
abs generally make things easier
for you.
36-40 points:
Bella-level awkward
You possess levels of awkwardness
that have rarely been rivaled in all
of human society. Much akin to
Bella, you make odd situations
unbearable with your weird
responses and self-destructive ten
dencies. That you've made it func
tionally to adulthood is an achieve
ment in itself.
