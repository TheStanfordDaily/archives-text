## ROXY SASS BOOTY CALL with style 
### 
It's midnight on Friday, and your
phone lights up with a message
that could only mean one thing:
it's sexy time. Roxy is always in the
mood for some action, and she's an
expert in getting exactly what she
wants, especially when it comes to
those late-night phone calls. While
she spends an hour doing her hair
and makeup for the night, she
knows in two or three hours, she'll
want someone else to be doing her.
Though you've used your best
lines on that cutie you met in the

post office "nice package"
you're not quite sure how to take it
to the next level. Roxy understands
that not everyone can just show up
at that someone's door without
seeming like a stalker. (Role-play,
anyone?) Here are her best tips on
how to make plans to get naked,
shamelessly.
The subtle hints
Roxy is an exhibitionist, and
approaches her booty-calls in the
same fashion. But for those of you
who don't want to explicitly tell your
hook-up buddy you're in the mood,
a little teasing can be effective in get
ting them to ahem come over
to your place. For example:
"I need to work out today, but I
can think of so many better ways to

do that then by going to the
gym ■ ■ ■"
"What if I told you that I was
Roxy Sass?"
The party text
Even Roxy needs a little liquid
courage to tell the frat star in the
room how to throw the afterparty
once the party downstairs is over. If
you're texting your way into
uncharted territory (or providing
the map to yours), a text early in the
night can help build the anticipa
tion. Remember: The later it is, the
more obvious your intentions
become. If it's past 12 o'clock in the
morning, you're looking to get
some, and it will show.
10:31 p.m. "Heyyy, what are
you doing tonight?"

11:17 p.m. "Want to meet
up later? I haven't seen you in awhile
12:00 a.m. "Tryna?"
1:02 a.m. "Nice shoes,
wanna fuck?"
The emoticon
A picture is worth 1,000 words,
and Roxy is a fan of showing, not
telling. But if you're not ready to add
modeling to your list of extracurric
ulars, adding a winky face to that
painstakingly drafted message will
get straight to the point, so you can
get straight to boning.;-)
Roxy might be bad, but she's perfectly
good at it. Send her a late night email
at intermission@stanforddaily.com so
she can show you, too.
