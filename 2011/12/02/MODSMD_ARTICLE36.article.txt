If you hate smiling, laughing, gig
gling, singing, dancing and all
around joy, then maybe you
should avoid "The Muppets."
However, if you want to smile, spend
some time with everyone's favorite
puppets and sing along. Jason Segel
finds this joy everywhere in this new
addition to the Muppet universe. A
well-known Muppet super fan, Segel
took great care and reverence in
adapting a new Muppets movie, and
it shows in every frame.
The film follows two brothers,
Gary (Segel) and Walter (Peter
Linz), who happens to be a Muppet
don't ask questions, just go with
it. Walter joins Gary and his fiancee
Mary (Amy Adams) on their trip to
Los Angeles, where they fulfill one of
Walter's dreams and visit the
Muppet Studios in Hollywood. They
soon discover that the studio is run
down and all but abandoned. Even
worse, Walter uncovers a plot by the
evilly named oil baron Tex Richman
(Chris Cooper) to buy the Muppet

Studios and drill for oil. Gary, Walter
and Mary take it upon themselves to
reunite the Muppet gang and help
them raise the money to rescue the
studio.
The fun begins as the gang
slowly begins to come back together.
We start to see a disillusioned
Kermit, a rock-bottom Fozzie Bear
and a successful-but-forlorn Miss
Piggy out in the real world. Once
together, they must figure out how
to raise the money to stop Tex
Richman from buying the studio.
Fortunately, the Muppets begin per
forming again, and the movie comes
full circle. The largest hurdle they
face in trying to raise money is
obsolescence no one cares about
the Muppets any more. Perhaps it is
true that our society has left the
Muppets behind, but with this
movie about nostalgia and a respect
for the entertainment that formed

our personalities during childhood,
the Muppets are truly back.
Each scene is filled with a
wealth of small pleasures and
delights. All of the characters are
acutely aware that they are in a
Muppet movie, which leads to a
series of in-jokes and references that
are refreshing and fun. There is also
a string of cameos that are enjoyable
if only to see Jack Black get kid
napped by Muppets. However, the
movie's standouts are definitely the
toe-tapping songs. Equal parts
catchy and playful, the slate of origi
nal songs and throwbacks to old
favorites are bubbly and fun diver
sions that enliven each scene. Adams

and Segel get sidelined to let the
Muppets shine as the real stars, who
perform so sincerely in each song
that it's hard not to be entirely
enthralled by them.
While it is definitely a movie for
kids, it is not a kiddie movie. "The
Muppets" proves that there is room
in the world for a movie with both
complex themes and poignant mes
sages, but also puppets wearing fart
shoes.
