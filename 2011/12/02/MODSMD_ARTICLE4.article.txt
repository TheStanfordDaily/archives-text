Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) successfully
repaired a gas pipeline leak, which had been dis
covered in Palo Alto earlier this month. The leak,
which was 1 to 2 mm in diameter, was the result
of water corrosion and was discovered during a
routine pressure test.
The faulty pipeline segment was part of the
same line line 132, which caused a September
2010 explosion in San Bruno and killed eight
people. That incident resulted from an incom
plete weld on a pipeline seam, which ruptured in

response to an electronic glitch elevating the gas
pressure in the pipeline.
The pipeline is one of two PG&E lines that
run along Stanford campus. The pipelines run on
either side of Junipero Serra Boulevard from
Page Mill Road to Sand Hill Road, through an
area that hosts faculty residences.
Both pipelines were listed by PG&E on a list
of 100 top sections for maintenance compiled
after the San Bruno explosion. PG&E plans to
replace line 109 and line 132, which date from
1936 and 1947 respectively, by 2013 and 2014.
PG&E also plans to upgrade line 109 to allow in
