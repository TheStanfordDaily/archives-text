## PG&E pipeline hole mended Testers found hole in same line that caused San Bruno explosion 
### MARSHALL WATKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) successfully
repaired a gas pipeline leak, which had been dis
covered in Palo Alto earlier this month. The leak,
which was 1 to 2 mm in diameter, was the result
of water corrosion and was discovered during a
routine pressure test.
The faulty pipeline segment was part of the
same line line 132, which caused a September
2010 explosion in San Bruno and killed eight
people. That incident resulted from an incom
plete weld on a pipeline seam, which ruptured in

response to an electronic glitch elevating the gas
pressure in the pipeline.
The pipeline is one of two PG&E lines that
run along Stanford campus. The pipelines run on
either side of Junipero Serra Boulevard from
Page Mill Road to Sand Hill Road, through an
area that hosts faculty residences.
Both pipelines were listed by PG&E on a list
of 100 top sections for maintenance compiled
after the San Bruno explosion. PG&E plans to
replace line 109 and line 132, which date from
1936 and 1947 respectively, by 2013 and 2014.
PG&E also plans to upgrade line 109 to allow in
ternal inspection of the pipe's structural integri
ty-
The leak in the pipeline, which occurred
under Page Mill Road in Palo Alto, was discover-
Ed on Nov. 3 when a routine test
using elevated water pressure re
vealed gradually falling pressure
levels through the pipe segment.
The leak's precise location was de
termined on Nov. 8, by pumping a
helium-air mixture through the
pipeline and testing at ground
level for traces of the mixture.

The line was retested, without
any further faults discovered, on
Nov. 10. No gas leak resulted from
the pipe, which had been drained
before the test commenced.

"They welded a sleeve around
it [the leak]," said PG&E
spokesperson Brittany Chord.
"The line was able to resume serv
ice shortly. The repair process was
only a matter of a couple of days."
Chord described the fault as
relatively minor, with the size of
the leak likely being exacerbated
by exposure to above-normal
pressure during the testing

process. The pipeline had been
tested earlier in the year without
issue. However, PG&E officials
informed Stanford earlier in the
year that they had been unable to
find testing records for most of the
lines along Junipero Serra.
In response to the San Bruno
explosion, California state regula
tors ordered that hydrostatic test
ing, which pumps water at 50 per
cent higher pressure through the
line for eight hours, be performed
on all pipeline segments without
documented test results. The
method, which costs between
$600,000 and $1 million per mile of
pipes tested, offers greater accura
cy than comparable methods and
will gradually be applied to
PG&E's entire network in order
to determine where pipe upgrades
or replacement may be most need
ed, according to Chord.
Larry Gibbs, associate vice
provost for Environmental Health
and Safety, noted that both lines
crossing Stanford property were
operating at reduced pressure fol
lowing an order from the state
government, but that the Univer

sity considered the leak to have
been effectively addressed.
"We're all very confident in
[on-campus] pipeline safety,"
Gibbs said. "The [new] testing
process is certainly something that
we've pushed PG&E for."
Gibbs noted that there had
been previous incidents with
pipeline leaks on campus. Fence
construction near Casa Italiana
and the installation of fiber optic
cables by Residential Housing
both resulted in minor pipeline
breaches, which Gibbs said were
resolved within a couple of hours
by PG&E repair teams.
"We've been working with
PG&E for over a year," Gibbs
said. The dialogue, which was es
tablished after the San Bruno ex
plosion, has involved regular meet
ings with a PG&E representative.
Stanford has sought to coordinate
with PG&E with regards to on
campus construction and pipeline
repair in order to preclude further
incidents.
