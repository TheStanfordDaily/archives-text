# Searsville Dam still questioned
## Group holds fundraiser to promote demolition

On Thursday night, the group "Beyond
Searsville Dam" held an auction event in Palo
Alto titled, "Give a Dam!" to raise money to
evaluate and consider the removal of Stan
ford University's Searsville Dam.
Beyond Searsville Dam is a nonprofit
coalition of individuals, community groups
and businesses; it states that its mission is to
remove the dam in a manner that is beneficial
to protecting creek-side communities and im
proving watershed health.
Beyond Searsville Dam argues that the 65-
foot tall dam is a concern to the San Fransqui
to Creek watershed and greater San Francis
co Bay for several reasons. As of right now, the
Searsville Dam has lost over 90 percent of its
original water storage capacity because of the
build-up of approximately 1.5 million cubic
yards of sediment, originally bound for the
bay, filling in the reservoir.
Five Stanford scholars were appointed to
a commission to study the dam in May of
2011. A previous report in 2007 determined
that the removal of the dam would have
harmful ecological effects on the surround
ing biosphere.
"There are many complicated issues in
volved in Searsville Dam and Reservoir, and
it is very important to the University that we
consider possible future actions with great
care," said Jean McCown, director of commu
nity relations, in the Stanford Report in May.
"Right now, there is a lot of misinforma
tion out there about Searsville Dam," Mc-
Cown said. "Our hope is that this faculty com
mittee will assure that the study examines all
the issues so that it presents a thoughtful and
well-reasoned assessment of potential alter
natives."
According to "Give a Dam!", the dam and
its reservoir do not offer drinking water, flood
control or hydropower, and it is off limits to
the public.
"Give a Dam!" was one of the first major
fundraiser events for Beyond Searsville Dam.
Matt Stoecker, the director of Beyond
Searsville Dam, said he had not made a mon
etary goal for the event.
"We made a lot more than I expected just
through ticket selling, and there is much more
money that went into the donations and the
auctions," Stoeker said.
Not only has the 120-year old dam lost its
