# Searsville Dam still questioned
## Group holds fundraiser to promote demolition 
### CATHERINE ZAW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Thursday night, the group "Beyond
Searsville Dam" held an auction event in Palo
Alto titled, "Give a Dam!" to raise money to
evaluate and consider the removal of Stan
ford University's Searsville Dam.
Beyond Searsville Dam is a nonprofit
coalition of individuals, community groups
and businesses; it states that its mission is to
remove the dam in a manner that is beneficial
to protecting creek-side communities and im
proving watershed health.
Beyond Searsville Dam argues that the 65-
foot tall dam is a concern to the San Fransqui
to Creek watershed and greater San Francis
co Bay for several reasons. As of right now, the
Searsville Dam has lost over 90 percent of its
original water storage capacity because of the
build-up of approximately 1.5 million cubic
yards of sediment, originally bound for the
bay, filling in the reservoir.
Five Stanford scholars were appointed to
a commission to study the dam in May of
2011. A previous report in 2007 determined
that the removal of the dam would have
harmful ecological effects on the surround
ing biosphere.
"There are many complicated issues in
volved in Searsville Dam and Reservoir, and
it is very important to the University that we
consider possible future actions with great
care," said Jean McCown, director of commu
nity relations, in the Stanford Report in May.
"Right now, there is a lot of misinforma
tion out there about Searsville Dam," Mc-
Cown said. "Our hope is that this faculty com
mittee will assure that the study examines all
the issues so that it presents a thoughtful and
well-reasoned assessment of potential alter
natives."
According to "Give a Dam!", the dam and
its reservoir do not offer drinking water, flood
control or hydropower, and it is off limits to
the public.
"Give a Dam!" was one of the first major
fundraiser events for Beyond Searsville Dam.
Matt Stoecker, the director of Beyond
Searsville Dam, said he had not made a mon
etary goal for the event.
"We made a lot more than I expected just
through ticket selling, and there is much more
money that went into the donations and the
auctions," Stoeker said.
Not only has the 120-year old dam lost its
original function, but it also blocks
the migration of steelhead trout and
other native fish and aquatic species
from accessing the largest spawning
and rearing stream in the watershed.
Additionally, the artificial reservoir
habitat supports exotic species that
compete with and prey upon native
species.
With the removal of the dam and
its still water habitat, the valley
made up of six converging streams
that had been buried can be re
stored. Restoration of this valley can
provide flood protection by natural
ly retaining winter water flows and
releasing them gradually later on,
creating an excellent wetland habi
tat. Furthermore, the trapped sedi
ment caught in the Searsville Dam
can go toward wetland restoration
projects in San Francisco Bay, mini
mizing costs to efforts of both the
dam removal and wetland restora
tion.
Over 200 people attended the
event, many of whom were associat
ed with Stanford University in some
capacity.
The money that was raised during
this event will be used for three im
mediate purposes: to fund a full-time
staff to help Beyond Searsville Dam,
as Stoecker had been working with
out pay for long hours for the coali
tion, to create a short documentary
that will help inform the public and
to help pay legal fees so that their at
torney could continue to work with

them to point out the inadequate
conservation plan the maintenance
of the Searsville Dam entailed.
"There was an uncertainty,"
Stoecker added, referring to what
would happen after dam removal.
"We didn't know what would hap
pen. But now that's not true. Now we
know that the river renews itself."
Stoecker gave a few solutions re
garding the removal of the Searsville
Dam: the concrete foundations
could be completely removed or
some concrete could be left so as to
stabilize the leftover sediment.
Stoecker also mentioned other
benefits that could arise from the re
moval of the Searsville Dam for Stan
ford. He suggested that after the dam
was removed, a bridge could be built
above the valley so that students
could do observational research on
the restored river environment
below, and the Felt Reservoir could
expand, even double its capacity.
"If you want the government to
change, you have to change the cor
porations. If you want the corpora
tions to change, you have to change
the consumers," said Yvon
Chouinard, the key-note speaker for
this event and the founder of Patag
onia.
Chouinard emphasized "public
involvement" and said he believed
that the main reason why there was
an uncertainty about the removal of
the dam was because of "ignorance."
He also spoke about past dam re
movals and their immediate benefits,
which he hoped Stanford could help
realize.
