## COLLEGE CUP AWAITS CARD 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
There's no question that the No.
1 Stanford women's soccer team is
looking forward to playing in the
College Cup this weekend. But
more than likely, the Cardinal is
looking backward as well.
Three straight trips to college
soccer's Final Four have ended in 1-
0 losses for Stanford (23-0-1), and
things probably aren't going to get
any easier this time around with all
four top seeds still alive in Kenne
saw, Ga. this weekend.
If the Cardinal wants to make it
to a third-straight College Cup
final, it's going to have to fend off a
Florida State team (18-6-1) this af
ternoon that's much more danger
ous than its record might suggest.
The ACC champion Seminoles lost
twice in four days to the two other
College Cup squads, Duke (21-3-1)
and Wake Forest (18-3-4), before

falling to conference second and
third-place finishers North Caroli
na and Virginia in a two-week span.
Needless to say, the tough schedule
prepared Florida State for the tour
nament well, as the Seminoles have
outscored opponents 10-1 while
avenging regular-season losses to
Portland and Virginia.
Stanford has been challenged
significantly in the postseason in its
own right, and is coming off a nail
biting 2-1 win over Oklahoma State
that senior forward Lindsay Taylor
ended with a point-blank goal early
in overtime. Emotional as the victo
ry may have been, the Cardinal isn't
ready to rest on its laurels.
"It will definitely give us confi
dence going into the College Cup to
be able to come back from being
tied and go into overtime," Taylor
said, "but saying that, I think that
going into every game we have to
