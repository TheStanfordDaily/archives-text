# BRINGING IT HOME
## COLLEGE CUP AWAITS CARD 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
There's no question that the No.
1 Stanford women's soccer team is
looking forward to playing in the
College Cup this weekend. But
more than likely, the Cardinal is
looking backward as well.
Three straight trips to college
soccer's Final Four have ended in 1-
0 losses for Stanford (23-0-1), and
things probably aren't going to get
any easier this time around with all
four top seeds still alive in Kenne
saw, Ga. this weekend.
If the Cardinal wants to make it
to a third-straight College Cup
final, it's going to have to fend off a
Florida State team (18-6-1) this af
ternoon that's much more danger
ous than its record might suggest.
The ACC champion Seminoles lost
twice in four days to the two other
College Cup squads, Duke (21-3-1)
and Wake Forest (18-3-4), before

falling to conference second and
third-place finishers North Caroli
na and Virginia in a two-week span.
Needless to say, the tough schedule
prepared Florida State for the tour
nament well, as the Seminoles have
outscored opponents 10-1 while
avenging regular-season losses to
Portland and Virginia.
Stanford has been challenged
significantly in the postseason in its
own right, and is coming off a nail
biting 2-1 win over Oklahoma State
that senior forward Lindsay Taylor
ended with a point-blank goal early
in overtime. Emotional as the victo
ry may have been, the Cardinal isn't
ready to rest on its laurels.
"It will definitely give us confi
dence going into the College Cup to
be able to come back from being
tied and go into overtime," Taylor
said, "but saying that, I think that
going into every game we have to

class to bring home Stanford's first NCAA title in women's soccer.
bring everything we have and play
the style of soccer we're capable of
playing. So I don't think that any
game necessarily helps us get over a
hump."
That certainly hasn't been the
case for Stanford over the last two
College Cups, when dramatic wins
in the semifinals preceded letdown
performances on Sunday. So even
with the trying battle against the
Cowgirls behind it, the Cardinal
knows it has to get right back to
work.
"In the whole tournament, I
don't think any game's been easy so
far," said senior midfielder Kristy
Zurmuhlen, who opened the scor
ing for the Cardinal last Friday. "I
mean, there's [been rainy] weather
and every team's athletic and tough.
I think it's just prepared us going
forward."
Indeed, Stanford hasn't really
dominated any of its tournament
games from the opening kickoff,
scoring more than half of its post
season goals after the 60th minute.
"We're going to be very excited
to get to the College Cup now be

cause we had to earn it, it wasn't just
gliding in there easy," said head
coach Paul Ratcliffe. "We know it's
going to be hard once we get there,
and we've had tests going into this,
so I think that's going to help us.
"It's going to take experience,
but for me the most important thing
is that competitive drive and that
character and the desire. You've got
to have that to win it."

Friday's matchup will feature a
showdown between two dominant
forwards: Taylor for the Cardinal
and redshirt junior forward Tiffany
McCarty, whose 18 goals on the sea
son are second in the ACC, for the
Seminoles. Each has carried her
successes to the postseason, where
Taylor has posted seven points and
McCarty has netted five,
Taylor certainly had more of an
impact when these two teams met
last year in the quarterfinals, getting
Stanford's second score in a 5-0 rout
and taking five shots, all of them on
goal. McCarty missed the entire
2010 season due to injury.
It will be the last chance at a na
tional championship for Taylor,

Zurmuhlen and the rest of the sen
iors.

"The people on this team are like
sisters, and we just care about each
other so much," Zurmuhlen said.
"And as much as we want this for
ourselves, we want it more for each
other, and I think that's the differ
ence: We work for each other."

Should the Cardinal advance, it
will have less than two days to pre
pare for either Wake Forest or
Duke, who meet in the late game
Friday. As dominant as Stanford has
been in recent years, the squad has
gone only 18-14-7 against ACC
schools in its history; many of those
struggles came against North Car
olina, however, which has an 8-0-3
record in the series. Luckily for the
Card, the Tar Heels fell in penalty
kicks in the third round.
Stanford meets Florida State at 2
p.m., with the NCAA Final sched
uled for Sunday at 10 a.m. Both
games will be televised on ESPNU
and at ESPN3.com.
