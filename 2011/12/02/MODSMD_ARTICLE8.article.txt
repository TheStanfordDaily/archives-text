## Morozov probes Internet's role in new democracies 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Evgeny Morozov, visiting scholar in the
Program on Liberation Technology at the
Center on Democracy, Development and the
Rule of Law (CDDRL), delivered a talk on
Thursday evening on the role of the Internet
in the democracy debate in regards to the
Arab Spring.
CDDRL Director Larry Diamond intro
duced Morozov by quoting The New York
Times' list of 100 Notable Books of 2011, in
which Morozov's book, "The Net Delusion:
The Dark Side of Internet Freedom," is de
scribed as "challenging and often contrarian."
"There are probably very few people writ
ing about the Internet today who are more
widely read, more widely discussed ... and
provoke more controversy, and constructive
ly so in my opinion, than Evgeny Morozov,"
Diamond said.
The talk weighed heavily on the theoreti
cal aspects of the debate and was part of the
weekly speaker series held by the CS
546/POLISCI 337S Seminar on Liberation
Technologies. Morozov began by introducing
two perspectives on technology and social
change: instrumentalist and ecological.
He summarized the "not particularly intel
lectually exciting" instrumentalist argument
saying, "It all depends on the people.Technol
ogy has no impact in itself and it all depends
on the human actors."
In this perspective, the Internet is a neutral
tool, an instrument and an amplifier. Moro
zov used the examples of Facebook's Mark
Zuckerberg, journalist Malcolm Glad well

and New York University professor Clay
Shirky to illustrate this position, posing theo
retical questions arguing against the instru
mentalist position.
Morozov then moved to describe the eco
logical position, a position he feels is more ac
curate.
"I'm much closer towards the ecological
camp," he said. "I think of technology tools as
having impact and effects that transcend sim
ple usage."
"The idea is that [the Internet] is more
than a tool: It transforms both the environ
ment where politics is made, those who partic
ipate in politics and many other keywords in
the vocabulary that we use to think about
protest and political change," he added.
The ecological position, in Morozov's ar
gument, looks at the long-term impacts of the
Internet in a certain arena. He held that aca
demia and the media often "gets the balance
wrong" when engaging in discussion about
the Internet, arguing for the importance of
comparative assessment.
"If you don't look beyond Twitter, how do
you know it's important?" he questioned, cit
ing a working paper by the Project on Infor
mation Technology and Political Islam that
claimed social media had a "central role" in
the Arab Spring and that Twitter was a "key
tool."
"All they looked at was social media and
the Internet more broadly," Morozov argued.
"It's central between what and what? We
don't know. For this statement to make sense
you need some comparative perspective
which is missing from such studies."
He also cited a First Post article on a hash

tag that trended on Twitter following the de
tainment of Egyptian-American journalist
Mona El Tahawy in the Egyptian Interior
Ministry. The article's headline claimed that
#FreeMona resulted in El Tahawy's release,
but Morozov quoted a line from his book to
raise concerns with this view.
"If a tree falls in the forest and everyone
tweets about it, it may not be the tweets that
moved it," he joked, going on to explain. "The
fact that everyone tweets about it does not
mean it was Twitter or a hashtag that resulted
in that particular outcome. Certainly it was
part of the story; but how important it was is
something to be studied, not something to be
assumed."
"The Internet is loaded with so many cul
tural assumptions that it's very hard to disen
tangle all the culture from what's actually
happening," Morozov said, discussing the
problem of making assumptions about the
usefulness of the Internet.
The "cost" of holding the perspective that
the Internet is neutral tool or that it inevitably
leads to democracy has "dire" implications on
policy, Morozov argued, entering a discussion
on the faults of this argument and reforming
the U.S. State Department's Internet freedom
agenda.
He first addressed the argument that the
Internet is facilitating the emergence of de
centralized and leaderless political structures,
citing Alec Ross, senior advisor on innovation
to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who
wrote on the benefits of social media in or-
