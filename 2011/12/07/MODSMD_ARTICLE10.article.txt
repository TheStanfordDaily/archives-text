## TREND Handling homesickness 
### CHRIS YANG 
Looking through a sunny Stanford
brochure, it might be hard to imag
ine that students living on the Farm
could miss home.
But, between bursts of midterms and other
sources of stress, homesickness can manifest
at arbitrary moments. Students can find them
selves beset by anxiety while groping for the
worn surface of a childhood bed stand that is
not there; they may be assailed by pangs of
nostalgia while looking at pictures of family
and old friends. And despite how contagious
ly happy everyone can seem to be on the sur
face, homesickness is not uncommon.
"Homesickness is a completely normal
and universal human experience," said CAPS
psychologist Naomi Brown. "For most, it is a
necessary developmental stage on the way to
growing up ... most students work through it
without any need from CAPS."
Homesickness cases are rarely reported to
counseling services such as CAPS or Vaden
Health Center's Bridge Peer Counseling
Center. This can mostly be chalked up to the

fact that it is more often a symptom than
a root problem. According to Brown,
homesickness is a phase of adjustment
in which students learn to balance dis
tress, negative stress inherent in con
fronting a new environment, and eu
stress, the positive stress that accompanies
change and excitement.
"At the Bridge, I've never had a call that
was specifically concerning homesickness,"
said Twain peer health educator Corinne
Coates 'l2, who is also a Bridge counselor.
"Instead, it really just tends to be something
that exacerbates other problems like room
mate conflicts and anxiety about grades ...

sometimes it's hard for students to throw
themselves into Stanford, which ends up mak
ing it harder not to be homesick."
When homesickness it is purely a conse
quence of adjustment issues, certain demo
graphics within the student body are more
likely to experience it. Incoming freshmen
might come to mind first; however, smaller
subsets of that group, such as international
students or students who are similarly far
from home, are particularly vulnerable.
"When I first came here, it was really the

cultural differ
ences that struck
me," said Eri Gamo
'l5, a Taiwanese student. "The humor, the
mannerisms, the social interactions were all
alien ... adjustment has been the hardest
part of Stanford so far, and I think it con
tributed a lot to how homesick I was in the
first few weeks of the quarter."

This sentiment is even shared by
some American students who are not
from the West Coast.
"It just felt like twice as much to get used
to in that I was bringing a Midwestern mind
set to California," said Minnesota native Ali
son Matteo 'l5. "It's not that people weren't
