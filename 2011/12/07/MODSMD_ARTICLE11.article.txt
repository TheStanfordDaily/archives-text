## Stanford study snacks 
### ETHAN KESSINGER 
L ate-night snacking fuels students to con
tinue working into the night, or perhaps
greets them as a beacon of solace, a
break from the tedious work that has
consumed their day. While some opt to
eat in the comfort of their own rooms (on cereal
hoarded from the dining halls, pizza delivered to
their dorms or even snack food purchased from
any number of on- or off-campus convenience
stores), others stay local and let Stanford Dining
satisfy their hunger pangs.
Stanford's late-night dining options include
The Dish at Arrillaga Family Dining Commons,
Latenite at Lagunita and The Axe and Palm at
Old Union.

More than that though, students indulge in
late night dining because it introduces excitement
into the lives of overworked (and hungry) college
students: It is an excuse to avoid homework, a
place to catch up with friends, a last stop after a
long night on the Row or a different place to
study.

Visiting one of Stanford's late-night dining fa
cilities is like walking into a popular bar, except
instead of beer, students are trying out a new fla
vor of milkshake or chicken tender. Each restau
rant is always loud, hectic and filled with the most
diverse group of students imaginable at all hours
of the night: A couple with matching pink hair
watches viral videos; a band member using his
celebrity status to try to score a complimentary
slice of pepperoni pizza; a stressed out freshman
thinking his red cup with "water" is fooling every
one and a boy trying to turn a group project into
a romantic first date.

Although students all over campus have ac
cess to these dining options, each has its unique
location, clientele and signature food. The Axe
and Palm, located next to Old Union, is a prime
spot for a variety of burgers and sandwiches; if
beef is not your style, you can try a salmon, lamb
or garden burger.
"I am almost out of my dining dollars because
of The Axe and Palm," said Sierra Freeman 'l5. "I
can't get enough of their burgers and fries."
The Dish at Arrillaga may not appeal as much
burger lovers with its primarily Mexican and Ital
ian themed menu, but it certainly has its fair share
of attendees.

"It is such a different experience from regular
dining at Arrillaga, but somehow you still feel like
even the drinks are made by a gourmet chef," said
Keith Wyngarden 'l5.
Latenite at Lagunita does not lack fans, either.
"It is always quite an adventure," said Chris
Barnum 'l4. "I love the food, and it's also a great
place to meet new people and relax after a long
night."

Despite the campus-wide love of late-night
dining, some students are hesitant to partake in
late-night snacking, worried about the extra calo
ries. However, Vivian Crisman, resident nutri
tionist at the Vaden Health Center, suggests that
there is no need to stop snacking so long as the
