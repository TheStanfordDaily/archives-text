The race begins. Children, grand
parents, athletes and even entire
families run; but the goal is not
just the finish line, it is eliminating
poverty housing and homeless
ness.The event is Stanford Habitat for Hu
manity's Home Run SK/10K, a major
fundraising event that has taken place an
nually for 16 years.
Stanford Habitat for Humanity is a cam
pus chapter of the international nonprofit
organization. The organization's goals are
"to eliminate poverty housing and home

lessness from the world" and "to make de
cent shelter a matter of conscience and ac
tion," according to its website.
The central organization consists of
country chapters, regional chapters and
campus chapters. The Stanford chapter
works with regional chapters Habitat for
Humanity Silicon Valley and Habitat for
Humanity Greater San Francisco, con
tributing through fundraising and volun
teer work.
Stanford Habitat for Humanity co-pres
ident Keren Mikva 'l2 described the rela

tionship with the regional chapters as a
"mutual partnership," where in return for
fundraising help the Stanford chapter re
ceives priority for participating in builds
and subsequent support for fundraising
events and activities. Apart from "builds,"
the Stanford chapter organizes two main
activities: Home Run and Family Fun Day.
This year, Home Run raised about
$14,000, according to Mikva, who called the
event a "huge undertaking."
