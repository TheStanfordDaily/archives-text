### PINNAREE TEA-MANGKORNPAN 
The race begins. Children, grand
parents, athletes and even entire
families run; but the goal is not
just the finish line, it is eliminating
poverty housing and homeless
ness.The event is Stanford Habitat for Hu
manity's Home Run SK/10K, a major
fundraising event that has taken place an
nually for 16 years.
Stanford Habitat for Humanity is a cam
pus chapter of the international nonprofit
organization. The organization's goals are
"to eliminate poverty housing and home

lessness from the world" and "to make de
cent shelter a matter of conscience and ac
tion," according to its website.
The central organization consists of
country chapters, regional chapters and
campus chapters. The Stanford chapter
works with regional chapters Habitat for
Humanity Silicon Valley and Habitat for
Humanity Greater San Francisco, con
tributing through fundraising and volun
teer work.
Stanford Habitat for Humanity co-pres
ident Keren Mikva 'l2 described the rela

tionship with the regional chapters as a
"mutual partnership," where in return for
fundraising help the Stanford chapter re
ceives priority for participating in builds
and subsequent support for fundraising
events and activities. Apart from "builds,"
the Stanford chapter organizes two main
activities: Home Run and Family Fun Day.
This year, Home Run raised about
$14,000, according to Mikva, who called the
event a "huge undertaking."

Managing the team
Stanford Habitat for Humani
ty's executive board consists of six
members who have worked on the
event for six to seven months with
support from several community
partners, regional chapters and an

advisor from Stanford Student Ac
tivities and Leadership.
"It's hard ... everybody [is a]
full-time student as well," Mikva
said. "But our team really pulled to
gether this year."
"It would've been nice to have
more people help out and do prepa
ration," added Pauline Santos 'l2,
Stanford Habitat's financial officer.
"We're looking to expand our team."
Aside from the difficulties of
working with a small team, the
chapter faced financial challenges.

"We lost one of our major spon
sors this year because of the econo
my," Mikva said. "That was kind of
a blow, but we actually have a big
ger donation this year."
The other major Stanford Habi
tat event, Family Fun Day, takes
place in May. The Stanford chapter
and the families it has worked with
go out for a fun day together. Previ
ous trips have been to the San Fran
cisco Zoo and the Exploratorium.
"This year we actually hope to
bring [families] to Stanford and
have a field day here because a lot
of them have kids," Mikva said.
"We've been to their homes, so we
want to bring them to our home at
Stanford."
"It's satisfying to see the people
you serve, and how well they're
doing," Santos added. "You'll see
the motivation to continue what
you're doing."
The Stanford chapter also coor
dinates some activities with the
UC-Berkeley Habitat chapter.
"The day before the Big Game
we each brought a group out...
and had a fake competition," Mikva

said. "We're going to do another big
build before the Cal basketball
game in March."
The group also plans to initiative
more new events.
"We're ... thinking about trying
to develop another event that's
more advocacy oriented, with our
partner at Silicon Valley," Mikva
said. "It's still in the works."
"[We would] try to spread
awareness about housing issues
around Stanford. A lot of people
know about homelessness, but
poverty housing is another huge
issue that Habitat focuses on," she
added.
Despite, or perhaps because of,
the hard work involved in building
houses or organizing large events,
the members of the chapter enjoy
their labor.
"When we take students out on
builds it's not just us ... you get to
meet a lot of different people from
all over it's a lot of fun," Mikva
said.
