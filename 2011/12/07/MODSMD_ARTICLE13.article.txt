# ERICA CHENOWETH
## DISCARDING THE SWORD 
### â€“ Carl Romanos 
With her weary eyes and
short, tussled hair, Erica
Chenoweth looks the part
of a busy academic.
Chenoweth, a visiting
scholar at the Center for International Se
curity and Cooperation (CISAC), had just
returned from a six-week around-the
world tour for her recently published
book comparing the efficiency of nonvio
lent to violent uprisings during the Arab
Spring. Despite her fatigue, her eyes
gleamed when talking about her book and
life after her tour.

"Ever since then, my life has been a
whirlwind," Chenoweth said.
Chenoweth has begun to tackle more
book projects as well. In one, she examines
the role of terrorism in democratic coun
tries, arguing that terrorist violence is more
likely to be seen in free societies. In anoth
er project, Chenoweth explores the suc
cesses and failures of international conflicts
to explain the rational behind nonviolent
uprisings. In addition, Chenoweth analyzes
the effectiveness of counterterrorism poli
cies and is involved in a variety of move
ments for nonviolent resistance.

From her research, Chenoweth has con
cluded that political power is shifting from
those who have the most weapons to those
who can recognize and exercise popular
power over authority.
"Mao [Zedong] used to say that power
flows from the barrel of a gun," Chenoweth
said. But "what we're now seeing is that
people are standing down gun barrels all
over the world, and they're winning."
According to Chenoweth, nonviolent
resistance is twice as effective as violent in-
