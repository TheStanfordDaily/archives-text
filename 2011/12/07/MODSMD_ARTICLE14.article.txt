## EDITORIAL Underprivileged students and intro classes 
### 
First-generation and others
from generally underprivi
leged backgrounds have a
host of unique challenges upon ar
riving at Stanford. They are placed
in a new social and economic cul
ture. They have financial burdens
that add to the stress of campus life.
And they are generally faced with
an abrupt academic transition;
from day one, students from these
backgrounds are in classes along
side peers who attended some of
the nation's top high schools. Al
though both groups of students are
bright, the privileged group is sig
nificantly better prepared for col
lege-level coursework; a 2003
study of 28 selective institutions, in
cluding Stanford, showed that the
GPA differential between low and
high income students is 0.2 in the
freshman year, a number that nar
rows somewhat in subsequent
years. Stanford, by expanding its fi
nancial aid program and focusing
on diversity, has committed to in
creasing the number of students
from less privileged backgrounds
at the University. This commit
ment, however, should not end
upon admission. Stanford should
ensure that all students have the
tools to succeed at Stanford, re
gardless of socioeconomic back
ground. This is especially impor
tant in the freshman year; a differ
ent 2003 study concluded that
"being a first-generation student
confers its greatest liability in the
initial adjustment to postsec
ondary education."
Therefore, we applaud pro
grams like freshman advising,
which requires incoming students
meet with an academic advisor be
fore enrolling in autumn quarter
classes. However, there remain
facets of the institutional structure,
which discriminate against under

privileged students. One example
is Chem3lA, which is generally
considered one of the most diffi
cult freshman classes. Due to med
school applications and/or unit-in
tensive majors, there is a strong
pressure to take Chem3lA in the
freshman year. However, the class
is only offered in autumn quarter.
For premeds and science/engineer
ing majors, especially those facing a
greater transition to college life
and academics, this poses a consid
erable dilemma: they can take
Chem3lA autumn quarter their
freshman year, five days removed
from arriving on campus; or they
can take Chem3lA their sopho
more year, when they are likely
better prepared, but fall a year be
hind their peers.
Accordingly, we believe that
Chem3l A and B should also be of
fered in the winter-spring. This
would allow more students to ap
proach the material when they feel
ready.The Computer Science, Eco
nomics and Math Departments al
ready have their introductory
classes offered in at least two of the
three non-summer quarters; we
see little reason for the Chemistry
Department not to follow suit.
With more than 400 students,
Chem3lA certainly has enough
demand to be offered in other
quarters. And although the biology
core lists Chem33 as a prerequisite
meaning, in theory, that stu
dents who want to take the core
their sophomore year have to start
with Chem3lA in autumn their
freshman year student com
ments on Courseßank agree that
Chem33 is not needed to do well in
the core.

or lower, and in freshman year es
pecially this can be a trying expe

from underprivileged back

This Board believes the next step
is to offer Chem3lA in the win

from underprivileged back
grounds are, for all intents and
purposes, forced into this experi

time in their college careers. The
University, if it is truly committed
to the ideal of providing a level
playing field for its students,
should not tolerate this.
