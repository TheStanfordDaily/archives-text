# FRESHMAN '15
## Is the honeymoon over? 
### Bianca Chavez 
Freshman year thus far has
been a lot like summer camp.
Sure, there may have had a
few rough patches like, any day
before an IHUM paper was due
but for the most part, life has been
pretty damn sweet. It's been a
quarter full of firsts; from football
season to Full Moon, everything
about Stanford thus far has felt
new and exciting.
But, as fall quarter comes to a
close and finals loom, are we fresh
men destined to lose that giddy
love and excitement for every as
pect of Stanford life?
I sure as hell haven't lost my
Cardinal love, but some of the ea
gerness has definitely faded away.
For example, during the first few
weeks of the quarter, I woke up
every day at 8:30 a.m. a full
hour and a half before my first
class in order to pick out an out
fit, carefully apply my makeup,
straighten my hair and eat a
leisurely, nutritionally balanced
breakfast in Stern's dining hall. I
arrived to every class at least five
minutes early and would have
parted with my favorite Steve
Madden boots before I considered
missing any of my classes. (Hey, I
told you in my first column that I
was totally That Freshmen. Did
you think I was joking or some
thing?)
Nowadays, I'm lucky to roll out
of bed at 9:40 a.m., and the Getting
Ready routine that once took 90
minutes now takes about nine
and that includes the time it takes
to grab my breakfast of champions
(read: a warm Diet Coke).
Don't get me wrong. I do still
enjoy the material I'm learning in
my classes, but the thought of lec
tures now typically fills me with
more dread than giddiness.
And as we freshmen get more
settled into college life, our atti
tudes toward our classes aren't the

only things that our shifting; our
relationships with each other are
changing perhaps even more dra
matically. What may have first
seemed like one of your room
mates endearing, quirky traits
like, say, sleeping through 9 million
alarms has ceased to be the
least bit funny or cute and has be
come super fucking annoying.
(True story: I know one girl whose
roommate set six alarms in order
to wake up for her 9 a.m. class
the first of which went off at 7 a.m.
. .. every single day. Umm ... in
considerate much?) Now that the
niceties are over, roommates are
starting to show their true colors,
and sometimes they're pretty
heinous. Some pairs that expected
to be bridesmaids in each other's
weddings are starting to realize
that they're far from BFFs, and not
so far from enemies.
So maybe the starry-eyed peri
od of wonder is beginning to dwin
dle for some of us frosh. But is this
necessarily a bad thing? Before
coming to Stanford, I envisioned
this place as a magical, academic
haven sort of like a fairy-tale
kingdom, if fairy tales had
midterms instead of fire-breathing
dragons. After being here for 10
weeks, I have started to realize
that while Stanford may be incred
ibly wonderful, it is also incredibly
real, with its own sets of problems
and areas in need of improvement.
Over my next two quarters here on
The Farm, I hope to gain a better

understanding of these issues.
Maybe by then I'll have traded in
some of my freshman-ness for ma
turity.

Do you have away for Bianca to get
from Twain to the Quad in less than
10 minutes? She'd love those extra
300 seconds of sleep. Let her know at
