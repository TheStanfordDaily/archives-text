# SEEING GREEN
## Blue, green and the color of corporate personhood 
### Holly Moeller 
Let me begin by saying that I
bleed blue. Not Yankee blue
or horseshoe crab copper
IBM Blue. I was raised on a corpo
rate paycheck and through all the
years my mother worked for the
computing giant (and the months I
spent in sales internships with
them) I never once shook an un
friendly hand or doubted a cowork
er's ethics. We were all good people,
selling a good product that we be
lieved in that I still believe in.
But we were also part of corpo
rate America, hard at work building
the fortunes of the 1 percent.
How can I reconcile what I know
about the personhood of employees
with the faceless and troubling
power that big business wields on
Wall Street and Capitol Hill?
On my cynical days or per
haps, my most realistic ones I
think that perhaps everything can
be explained by self-interest and
the limits of our moral compass,
shaped by millennia of small-group
interactions. For example, many of
us, including my coworkers at IBM,
buy some organic fruit and bike to
work in good weather for personal
health and environmental reasons.
We care depending on our age
and childrearing status about the
world we'll leave our descendants.
Occasionally we spare a thought for
the citizens of Pacific atolls drown

ing under rising sea levels. Rarely
do we pen a letter to our congress
man about these or other issues.

It's not that we explicitly claim our
personal health and safety are more
valuable than any other's. It's just that
in the back-of-the-envelope cost
benefit analysis accompanying any
one of our actions, proximity (both
spatial and emotional) matters. A lot.
Now take this logic to the cor
porate boardroom, where suited
men several tiers removed from
entry-level employees (and even
more distant from those whose
land they might be clearing or
whose oceans they might be
drilling) are safeguarding their
own wealth and the business model
of a company that may be decades
older than their careers. They steer
businesses formed by the econom
ics of the bottom line, businesses
that are neither compelled by their
stakeholders nor reminded by
their neighbors to take the envi
ronmental high road.
Of course, most companies don't
start out that way. They begin with a
novel vision, a principled strategy
for enacting it and a few founding
employees who, above all, believe.
As I clearly remember from my
days as Employee No. 12 at biotech
startup Ginkgo Bio Works, belief
and the mobility of a small size
will take you far. The founders were

fearless, willing to turn the company
on a dime and keenly aware of both
business and environmental issues.

What is it that separates Ginkgo
the quiet engineer of oil spill
cleanups and alternative energy
sources from Exxon Mobil,
which spending millions annually to
preserve its tax breaks and run pro
fossil fuel ad campaigns? What are
the "risk factors" for environmental
irresponsibility?
First: size and its consorts, inertia
and wealth. Second: importance to
individuals and other industries. Fi
nally: reliance on nonrenewable re
sources. Combined with immobility
born of size, this is the deciding factor
separating the businesses which will
go down fighting to strip the world
bare from those that will turn with the
market to greener pastures.
Today, it's our job to remind big
businesses that, though they may
wield wealth and power that the 99
percent cannot, they rest on the
shoulders of principled, hard-work
ing, environmentally conscious in
dividuals. It's our job to demand an
equal voice. It's simply human na
ture.
