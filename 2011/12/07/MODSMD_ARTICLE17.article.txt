# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## A 						Christ-less Christianity? 
### Miles Unterreiner 
The religious right loves to com
plain that we've taken the
Christ out of Christmas. Well,
maybe. But if the left has taken Christ
out of Christmas, then you, Bill
O'Reillys and Rush Limbaughs of
the world, are guilty of a far worse
crime: taking the Christ out of Chris
tianity.
As a lifelong Christian, it's always
perplexed me how successfully the
religious right has constructed such a
conservative political agenda around
so profoundly liberal a figure as
Jesus. How has a visionary who cared
for the poor been employed in the
service of an ideology that so blatant
ly favors the rich? A man who com
forted and cured the sick, the leprous
and the lame used to derail the possi

bility of universal health care? The
Prince of Peace remembered as the
Lord of War? A champion of the out
cast, the unwanted and the different
converted into a mouthpiece for the
exclusion of the spurned and the
scorned? It's been said before, but I'll
say it again: if Jesus were alive today,
he'd lean Democrat.
Jesus was no trickle-down econo
mist, no free-marketeer; he harbored
no sympathy with or allegiance to the
wealthy. "It is easier," he said, "for a
camel to go through the eye of a nee
dle than for a rich man to enter the
kingdom of God" (Matthew 19:23-
24). The Gospels of Mark, Matthew
and Luke tell us of the rich man who
fell on his knees before the Lord, ask
ing what he needed to do to inherit

eternal life. '"One thing you lack,'
Jesus said. 'Go, sell everything you
have and give to the poor, and you
will have treasure in heaven. Then
come, follow me.' When the man
went away in sorrow, Jesus looked
around and said to his disciples,' How
hard it is for the rich to enter the king
dom of God!"' (Mark 10:21-23).
Jesus didn't count himself
among the wealthy moneylenders,
his society's 1 percent; he over
turned their tables in the Temple in
a holy rage. "'My house will be
called a house of prayer,' bellowed

the Savior, 'but you are making it a
den of robbers'" (Matthew 21:13).
Elsewhere, he put it yet more
bluntly: "You cannot serve both
God and money" (Matthew 6:24).
It's easy to see Jesus waving a "We
are the 99 percent" sign at an Oc
cupy rally; it's a bit harder to see
him engineering new derivatives
for Goldman Sachs or holding out
on a debt deal to demand more tax
breaks for the wealthy. After all,
Jesus hung out with prostitutes and
tax collectors (tax collectors!); he
didn't waste his time fulminating
against oppressive slingshot-con
trol laws or complaining about the
unfair taxes levied on the richest
0.1 percent of Pharisees. The only
invisible hand Jesus followed was
that of the Holy Spirit.
When talking about the proper
response to injustice, Jesus did not
speak of retaliation or preemptive
strikes, bombing campaigns or
drone missions, hanging or firing

squads. He spoke of forgiveness.
"You have heard that it was said,
'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an
evil person. If someone strikes you
on the right cheek, turn to him the
other also. And if someone wants to
sue you and take your tunic, let him
have your cloak as well" (Matthew
5:38-42).
He was skeptical of pompous,
public, ornamental religiosity: "And
when you pray, do not be like the
hypocrites, for they love to pray
standing in the synagogues and on
the street corners to be seen by oth
ers ... But when you pray, go into
your room, close the door and pray
to your Father, who is unseen"
(Matthew 6:5-6). No televised Na
tional Prayer Days here, Governor
Perry; prayer for Jesus was intense
ly, deeply personal, a means through
which to better understand one's di
rect relationship with God not
showily trumpet one's faith to the
masses.
So go ahead and justify your tax
cuts for the rich, your attacks on
Obamacare and your wars. Justify
them on economic grounds, or tell
me that missiles and bombs are

strategically necessary to advance
our long-term interests in the region
or explain how screwing the poor
will help everyone in the long run.
You know what, you may even be
right Jesus was no economist and
no general, and heaven knows we
should render to Caesar what is
Caesar's.

Just know that when you do,
you'll be worshipping at the altar of
Adam Smith, not the feet of God.

And know that there are a lot of
Christians out there who wish you'd
stop preaching the virtues of this
theologically questionable, spiritu
ally empty, thoroughly Christ-less
thing you so audaciously call Chris
tianity.

perplexed me how successfully the
religious right has constructed such a
conservative political agenda around
so profoundly liberal a figure as
Jesus. How has a visionary who cared
for the poor been employed in the
service of an ideology that so blatant
ly favors the rich? A man who com
forted and cured the sick, the leprous
and the lame used to derail the possi

bility of universal health care? The
Prince of Peace remembered as the
Lord of War? A champion of the out
cast, the unwanted and the different
converted into a mouthpiece for the
exclusion of the spurned and the
scorned? It's been said before, but I'll
say it again: if Jesus were alive today,
he'd lean Democrat.
Jesus was no trickle-down econo
mist, no free-marketeer; he harbored
no sympathy with or allegiance to the
wealthy. "It is easier," he said, "for a
camel to go through the eye of a nee
dle than for a rich man to enter the
kingdom of God" (Matthew 19:23-
24). The Gospels of Mark, Matthew
and Luke tell us of the rich man who
fell on his knees before the Lord, ask
ing what he needed to do to inherit

eternal life. '"One thing you lack,'
Jesus said. 'Go, sell everything you
have and give to the poor, and you
will have treasure in heaven. Then
come, follow me.' When the man
went away in sorrow, Jesus looked
around and said to his disciples,' How
hard it is for the rich to enter the king
dom of God!"' (Mark 10:21-23).
Jesus didn't count himself
among the wealthy moneylenders,
his society's 1 percent; he over
turned their tables in the Temple in
a holy rage. "'My house will be
called a house of prayer,' bellowed

the Savior, 'but you are making it a
den of robbers'" (Matthew 21:13).
Elsewhere, he put it yet more
bluntly: "You cannot serve both
God and money" (Matthew 6:24).
It's easy to see Jesus waving a "We
are the 99 percent" sign at an Oc
cupy rally; it's a bit harder to see
him engineering new derivatives
for Goldman Sachs or holding out
on a debt deal to demand more tax
breaks for the wealthy. After all,
Jesus hung out with prostitutes and
tax collectors (tax collectors!); he
didn't waste his time fulminating
against oppressive slingshot-con
trol laws or complaining about the
unfair taxes levied on the richest
0.1 percent of Pharisees. The only
invisible hand Jesus followed was
that of the Holy Spirit.
When talking about the proper
response to injustice, Jesus did not
speak of retaliation or preemptive
strikes, bombing campaigns or
drone missions, hanging or firing

squads. He spoke of forgiveness.
"You have heard that it was said,
'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an
evil person. If someone strikes you
on the right cheek, turn to him the
other also. And if someone wants to
sue you and take your tunic, let him
have your cloak as well" (Matthew
5:38-42).
He was skeptical of pompous,
public, ornamental religiosity: "And
when you pray, do not be like the
hypocrites, for they love to pray
standing in the synagogues and on
the street corners to be seen by oth
ers ... But when you pray, go into
your room, close the door and pray
to your Father, who is unseen"
(Matthew 6:5-6). No televised Na
tional Prayer Days here, Governor
Perry; prayer for Jesus was intense
ly, deeply personal, a means through
which to better understand one's di
rect relationship with God not
showily trumpet one's faith to the
masses.
So go ahead and justify your tax
cuts for the rich, your attacks on
Obamacare and your wars. Justify
them on economic grounds, or tell
me that missiles and bombs are

strategically necessary to advance
our long-term interests in the region
or explain how screwing the poor
will help everyone in the long run.
You know what, you may even be
right Jesus was no economist and
no general, and heaven knows we
should render to Caesar what is
Caesar's.

Just know that when you do,
you'll be worshipping at the altar of
Adam Smith, not the feet of God.

And know that there are a lot of
Christians out there who wish you'd
stop preaching the virtues of this
theologically questionable, spiritu
ally empty, thoroughly Christ-less
thing you so audaciously call Chris
tianity.
