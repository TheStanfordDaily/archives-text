# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## A
						Christ-less Christianity? 
### Miles Unterreiner 
The religious right loves to com
plain that we've taken the
Christ out of Christmas. Well,
maybe. But if the left has taken Christ
out of Christmas, then you, Bill
O'Reillys and Rush Limbaughs of
the world, are guilty of a far worse
crime: taking the Christ out of Chris
tianity.
As a lifelong Christian, it's always
perplexed me how successfully the
religious right has constructed such a
conservative political agenda around
so profoundly liberal a figure as
Jesus. How has a visionary who cared
for the poor been employed in the
service of an ideology that so blatant

forted and cured the sick, the leprous
and the lame used to derail the possi

Prince of Peace remembered as the
Lord of War? A champion of the out
cast, the unwanted and the different
converted into a mouthpiece for the
exclusion of the spurned and the
scorned? It's been said before, but I'll

he'd lean Democrat.
Jesus was no trickle-down econo
mist, no free-marketeer; he harbored

kingdom of God" (Matthew 19:23-
24). The Gospels of Mark, Matthew
and Luke tell us of the rich man who
fell on his knees before the Lord, ask
ing what he needed to do to inherit

eternal life. '"One thing you lack,'
Jesus said. 'Go, sell everything you
have and give to the poor, and you
will have treasure in heaven. Then
come, follow me.' When the man
went away in sorrow, Jesus looked
around and said to his disciples,' How
hard it is for the rich to enter the king
dom of God!"' (Mark 10:21-23).
Jesus didn't count himself
among the wealthy moneylenders,
his society's 1 percent; he over
turned their tables in the Temple in
a holy rage. "'My house will be
called a house of prayer,' bellowed
