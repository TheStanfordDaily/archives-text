## Occupy the Future: Taxes and inequality 
### JONAH REXER '12 
Classic political theory says
that in countries with high in
equality like the United
States, the median voter will favor
redistribution through progressive
taxation. But in the past few
decades, income inequality in the
United States has soared even as
our tax policy has become less pro
gressive. Today, tax rates on the
highest income earners are low by
any standard; they have fallen dra
matically since the 19705, when they
were upward of 70 percent, and our
current rate of 35 percent ranks
among the lowest of the advanced
nations. Our fiscal policy is far less
redistributive than at any other
point in our history, and now, pro
grams like Social Security and
Medicare, the last vestiges of the
postwar social contract, may indeed

be the next casualties of the anti
tax, anti-government dogma cur
rently dominating our fiscal debate.
The result has been that less re
distribution has compounded struc
tural trends the runaway corpo
rate profits and stagnant wages
driving post-1970 inequality to
accelerate a widening gap. Econo
mists from the right will argue that
this doesn't matter, that inequality
is the price we pay for growth. High
er marginal tax rates on high-earn
ers would reduce the incentive to
invest and innovate, stifling the so
called "job creators."
The reality is that taxes on the
rich do not disincentivize any more
than do taxes on other classes. Since
GDP is equivalent to the sum of all
wages in an economy, "the effect on
everyone else's income if a worker

chooses to work one hour less is
zero" regardless of whether the
worker is a janitor or a hedge fund
manager, as explained by New York
Times columnist Paul Krugman last
month. If anything, our economy,
fueled largely by middle class con
sumer demand, requires a tax sys
tem where the rich shoulder a larg
er share of the burden. And given
that all income is subject to dimin
ishing returns, it seems that the fund
manager should be more willing to
part with a billionth dollar of in
come than a teacher earning a frac
tion of that.

But the case for a more progres
sive tax system goes beyond Rawl
sian notion of how a fair society
ought to look. As our elected repre
sentatives in Congress continue to
clash over the budget, what's at
stake is not only a few million poor
er Americans slipping below the
poverty line because of hardline in
sistence on spending cuts (though
this prospect is real, as many Amer
icans depend on social programs up
for cuts.) In fact, a spate of recent
evidence from the IMF, as detailed
in the Dec. 2010 release "Leverag
ing Inequality," finds that periods of
long-run inequality also increase
the likelihood of financial and eco
nomic crisis. The income gap is
filled by an unsustainable growth in
credit, as households "resist the
erosion of their relative income po
sition by borrowing to maintain a
higher standard of living." In the
past decade, this borrowing mainly
took the form of subprime debt to
poor and middle class households.
In the face of political pressure
for redistribution, politicians were
either unable to find the political
will to raise taxes or were outright
against it. Clinton's tax rates, now
an upper limit, are not particularly
high compared to Europe, and the
Bush tax cuts were a boon to the
rich. Instead of reinvesting in socie
ty, they slashed taxes and pumped
cheap credit into the system. Insti
tutions like Fannie and Freddie,
part of Bush's "home ownership so
ciety," were vehicles for financing
the debts of the poor and middle
classes.

While interning in DC last
spring, I was able to see Raghuram
Raj an, the former IMF chief, pres
ent this view of the global financial
crisis. In his talk, he made a surpris
ing claim: that cuts in funding of

early childhood education had
played a role in causing the Great
Recession. Cutting these programs,
he argued, represented the broader
attack on the social safety net that
has compounded rising structural
inequality in the past few decades,
contributing to the broad demand
for easy credit. The impact of these
cuts was something I saw among
the many public school students I
had tutored from Harlem to East
Palo Alto, whose parents might
have been in debt.

No real redistribution ever hap
pened. Meanwhile, the recklessness
of the financial sector and deregu
lation set the stage for the crash.
The credit bubble grew, and then in
2008 it burst, leaving most Ameri
cans worse off and the social safety
net even weaker. Of course, it's only
one of the lessons in our tale of eco
nomic ruin, but it's an important
one: that inequality puts us all at
risk. If progressive fiscal policy can
address this imbalance through the
redistribution of income, then it can
make our economy not only fairer,
but also stronger.

sive tax system goes beyond Rawl
sian notion of how a fair society
ought to look. As our elected repre
sentatives in Congress continue to
clash over the budget, what's at
stake is not only a few million poor
er Americans slipping below the
poverty line because of hardline in
sistence on spending cuts (though
this prospect is real, as many Amer
icans depend on social programs up
for cuts.) In fact, a spate of recent
evidence from the IMF, as detailed
in the Dec. 2010 release "Leverag
ing Inequality," finds that periods of
long-run inequality also increase
the likelihood of financial and eco
nomic crisis. The income gap is
filled by an unsustainable growth in
credit, as households "resist the
erosion of their relative income po
sition by borrowing to maintain a
higher standard of living." In the
past decade, this borrowing mainly
took the form of subprime debt to
poor and middle class households.
In the face of political pressure
for redistribution, politicians were
either unable to find the political
will to raise taxes or were outright
against it. Clinton's tax rates, now
an upper limit, are not particularly
high compared to Europe, and the
Bush tax cuts were a boon to the
rich. Instead of reinvesting in socie
ty, they slashed taxes and pumped
cheap credit into the system. Insti
tutions like Fannie and Freddie,
part of Bush's "home ownership so
ciety," were vehicles for financing
the debts of the poor and middle
classes.

While interning in DC last
spring, I was able to see Raghuram
Raj an, the former IMF chief, pres
ent this view of the global financial
crisis. In his talk, he made a surpris
ing claim: that cuts in funding of

early childhood education had
played a role in causing the Great
Recession. Cutting these programs,
he argued, represented the broader
attack on the social safety net that
has compounded rising structural
inequality in the past few decades,
contributing to the broad demand
for easy credit. The impact of these
cuts was something I saw among
the many public school students I
had tutored from Harlem to East
Palo Alto, whose parents might
have been in debt.

No real redistribution ever hap
pened. Meanwhile, the recklessness
of the financial sector and deregu
lation set the stage for the crash.
The credit bubble grew, and then in
2008 it burst, leaving most Ameri
cans worse off and the social safety
net even weaker. Of course, it's only
one of the lessons in our tale of eco
nomic ruin, but it's an important
one: that inequality puts us all at
risk. If progressive fiscal policy can
address this imbalance through the
redistribution of income, then it can
make our economy not only fairer,
but also stronger.
