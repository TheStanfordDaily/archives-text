## Occupy the Future: Taxes and inequality 
### JONAH REXER '12 
Classic political theory says
that in countries with high in
equality like the United
States, the median voter will favor
redistribution through progressive
taxation. But in the past few
decades, income inequality in the
United States has soared even as
our tax policy has become less pro
gressive. Today, tax rates on the
highest income earners are low by
any standard; they have fallen dra
matically since the 19705, when they
were upward of 70 percent, and our
current rate of 35 percent ranks
among the lowest of the advanced
nations. Our fiscal policy is far less
redistributive than at any other
point in our history, and now, pro
grams like Social Security and
Medicare, the last vestiges of the
postwar social contract, may indeed

be the next casualties of the anti
tax, anti-government dogma cur
rently dominating our fiscal debate.
The result has been that less re
distribution has compounded struc
tural trends the runaway corpo
rate profits and stagnant wages
driving post-1970 inequality to
accelerate a widening gap. Econo
mists from the right will argue that
this doesn't matter, that inequality
is the price we pay for growth. High
er marginal tax rates on high-earn
ers would reduce the incentive to
invest and innovate, stifling the so
called "job creators."
The reality is that taxes on the
rich do not disincentivize any more
than do taxes on other classes. Since
GDP is equivalent to the sum of all
wages in an economy, "the effect on
everyone else's income if a worker

chooses to work one hour less is
zero" regardless of whether the
worker is a janitor or a hedge fund
manager, as explained by New York
Times columnist Paul Krugman last
month. If anything, our economy,
fueled largely by middle class con
sumer demand, requires a tax sys
tem where the rich shoulder a larg
er share of the burden. And given
that all income is subject to dimin
ishing returns, it seems that the fund
manager should be more willing to
part with a billionth dollar of in
come than a teacher earning a frac
tion of that.

But the case for a more progres
sive tax system goes beyond Rawl
sian notion of how a fair society
ought to look. As our elected repre
