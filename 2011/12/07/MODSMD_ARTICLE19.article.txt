In "Keats, plural?" (Dec. 2), The
Daily incorrectly reported that
English professor Denise Gigante
discovered primary source docu
ments in Naomi Joy Kirk's home
while doing background research
for "The Keats Brothers: The Life
of John and George." In fact, she
read through papers in the Naomi
Joy Kirk Collection at the Filson
Historical Society in Louisville, Ky.,
which were not primary sources.
