## Alcohol transports on the rise Castro blames hard alcohol, "pre-gaming" 
### MARSHALL WATKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The number of alcohol-related
hospitalizations has accelerated over
the last month, according to the Office
of Alcohol Policy and Education
(OAPE).
OAPE Director Ralph Castro ac
knowledged that while the number of
transports earlier in the quarter had
been similar to previous years, the
University is currently experiencing a
higher than average number of alco
hol-related hospitalizations.
The University has averaged two
to three transports each weekend
since Halloween, according to Castro.
This statistic suggests that a transport
has been occurring approximately
each weekend night, on average. The
majority of transports constitute up
perclassmen, according to Castro,
while freshmen remain a plurality of
cases, as in previous years.
Castro downplayed the signifi
cance of the increase in transports,
noting that the OAPE's emphasis on
providing alcohol-free entertainment
and educating students about the
dangers of high-risk drinking may
have developed a more responsible
student body.
"As increased attention is placed
on high-risk drinking, more students
are aware and may be calling for help
at an increased rate," Castro said in
an email to The Daily. "So, the in
crease may be due to positive care
taking behaviors, rather than more
drinking."
The efforts of the OAPE, which
was created at the start of this aca
demic year to reduce high-risk drink
ing, have included the Cardinal
Nights initiative, outreach to fresh
man dorms and a new emphasis on
reminding students that they are eth
ically responsible for their peers.
Castro said that Cardinal Nights
events have been generally well at
tended and that feedback from stu
dents has been extremely positive, al
though the program's recent begin
ning has made it hard to draw conclu
sions about any impact on transports.
Clifford Nass, resident fellow in
Otero, praised the impact of the
OAPE's creation, saying that it effec

tively consolidated alcohol policy and
showed that the University is taking
the initiative in addressing high-risk
drinking.
"The important thing is that the
University is saying that there are
things we should be doing to address
this problem," Nass said. "Alcohol is
no longer being treated as an individ
ual issue, but as the product of group
activity."
Nass and the OAPE both identi
fied the common practice of "pre
gaming" for events with hard liquor as
the most concerning trend in student
drinking.
"Stanford is not immune to this
trend, and we are a heavy hard liquor
consumption campus," Castro said.
"We are targeting hard liquor in our
educational efforts and are telling
everyone that hard liquor is the
biggest risk factor for alcohol ER
transport cases."
Castro noted that while Stanford is
above national averages for hard
liquor consumption and pre-gaming,
the University, in comparison to its
peer institutions, has a lower number
of emergency room transports.
The OAPE is currently attempting
to become more consistent and raise
awareness about the dangers of high
risk drinking. Castro stated that the
OAPE this year had a specific focus
on educating freshmen on the dan
gers of high-risk drinking.

"Freshman year is a high-risk time
in many ways, academically and so
cially," Castro said. "Given that many
frosh were not regular drinkers in
high school, the risk for situational al
cohol-related problems is high."
The OAPE looked at other col
leges' attitudes toward alcohol issues
before formulating the University's
Student Alcohol Policy, which Castro
asserted offers clearer and more con
sistent policies in targeting high-risk
drinking.
Nass expressed cautious optimism
with regards to the OAPE's initia
tives, commenting that students are
assuming increasing responsibility for
their peers. Nass also said that the
number of student staff present in
dorms and the tendency of students to
drink on-campus in relatively safer
surroundings should naturally help
reduce high-risk drinking in any case.
Castro said that active support and
engagement by the student body will
be needed to ensure that the OAPE's
efforts in targeting high-risk drinking
are effective.
"I believe that every student can
buy into the idea of having a safe and
healthy community free of the nega
tive consequences of alcohol misuse,"
Castro said. "In order to be successful,
we need everyone to do their part."
