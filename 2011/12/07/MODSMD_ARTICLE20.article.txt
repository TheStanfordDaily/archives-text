## CHAMPS AT LAST CARD BEATS DUKE FOR NCAA TITLE 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
NCAA title number 102 made
its way to the Farm this week, but
for the undefeated Stanford
women's soccer team, its run at the
College Cup meant much more

than the trophy it brought home.
When defender Camille Levin
found midfielder Teresa Noyola
waiting at the back post and Noyola
headed in the first-ever goal in a
College Cup final for the Cardinal
(25-0-1), the two seniors put a con
clusively positive stamp on careers

that had been marked by three
years of postseason disappoint
ment.

Women's soccer has been one of
the few national titles that has
seemed to just elude Stanford. Four
times in 1993, 2008, 2009 and
2010 the Cardinal reached the
Final Four only to meet heartbreak.
Two years in a row, eventual Fler
mann Trophy winners were si
lenced in the College Cup final.
And even as the Stanford squad
demonstrated its national rele
vance year-in and year-out under
head coach Paul Ratcliffe, it could
never attain the dynasty status
given to perennial champions
North Carolina and Notre Dame,
That all changed Sunday.
"This team deserves it," Noyola
said. "We've worked extremely
hard but have also shown great
character to not let the heartbreaks
of the last two seasons catch up [to
us]."
Duke (22-4-1) pressured threat
eningly at times in the final, but
solid play from the back line and
another perfect performance from
sophomore goalkeeper Emily Oliv
er between the pipes propelled
Stanford to victory and the first un
defeated season in school history.
"We didn't think about any
other game this year," Levin said.
"It was about this game. We knew
we had to come out and keep pos
session and play our game."
The Cardinal was doing just that
against the Blue Devils early on
and had several close misses in the
first half. A header from junior mid
fielder Mariah Nogueira went just
wide right in the third minute;
freshman forward Chioma Ãœbo
gagu nearly drew a penalty kick
with her evasiveness in the 22nd
minute, but the referee held on to
his whistle.
Stemming the tide, Duke coun
tered with chances of its own and
nearly snuck one by Oliver late in
the half on a misplayed ball by the
Stanford defense. Forward Molly
Lester missed high, however, and

the back-and-forth match was
scoreless entering the half.
Though the Cardinal was con
trolling the tempo, the match still
had the potential of turning into an
other close loss, like the consecu
tive 1-0 defeats Stanford had suf
fered in the two previous finals. In
each, the Cardinal's leading scorer

Kelley O'Hara in 2009 and
Christen Press in 2010 was held
to three or fewer shots; on Sunday,
20-goal-scorer senior forward
Lindsay Taylor entered the half
with just one attempt.
But this time around, Ratcliffe

classmate Teresa Noyola unmarked on the back post for the game-winning
goal against the Blue Devils, giving Stanford its first title in program history.
