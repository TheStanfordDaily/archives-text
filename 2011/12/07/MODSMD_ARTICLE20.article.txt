## CHAMPS AT LAST CARD BEATS DUKE FOR NCAA TITLE 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
NCAA title number 102 made
its way to the Farm this week, but
for the undefeated Stanford
women's soccer team, its run at the
College Cup meant much more

than the trophy it brought home.
When defender Camille Levin
found midfielder Teresa Noyola
waiting at the back post and Noyola
headed in the first-ever goal in a
College Cup final for the Cardinal
(25-0-1), the two seniors put a con
clusively positive stamp on careers

that had been marked by three
years of postseason disappoint
ment.

Women's soccer has been one of
the few national titles that has
seemed to just elude Stanford. Four
times in 1993, 2008, 2009 and
2010 the Cardinal reached the
Final Four only to meet heartbreak.
Two years in a row, eventual Fler
mann Trophy winners were si
lenced in the College Cup final.
And even as the Stanford squad
demonstrated its national rele
vance year-in and year-out under
head coach Paul Ratcliffe, it could
never attain the dynasty status
given to perennial champions
North Carolina and Notre Dame,
That all changed Sunday.
"This team deserves it," Noyola
said. "We've worked extremely
hard but have also shown great
character to not let the heartbreaks
of the last two seasons catch up [to
us]."
Duke (22-4-1) pressured threat
eningly at times in the final, but
solid play from the back line and
another perfect performance from
sophomore goalkeeper Emily Oliv
er between the pipes propelled
Stanford to victory and the first un
defeated season in school history.
"We didn't think about any
other game this year," Levin said.
"It was about this game. We knew
we had to come out and keep pos
session and play our game."
The Cardinal was doing just that
against the Blue Devils early on
and had several close misses in the
first half. A header from junior mid
fielder Mariah Nogueira went just
wide right in the third minute;
freshman forward Chioma Übo
gagu nearly drew a penalty kick
with her evasiveness in the 22nd
minute, but the referee held on to
his whistle.
Stemming the tide, Duke coun
tered with chances of its own and
nearly snuck one by Oliver late in
the half on a misplayed ball by the
Stanford defense. Forward Molly
Lester missed high, however, and

the back-and-forth match was
scoreless entering the half.
Though the Cardinal was con
trolling the tempo, the match still
had the potential of turning into an
other close loss, like the consecu
tive 1-0 defeats Stanford had suf
fered in the two previous finals. In
each, the Cardinal's leading scorer

Kelley O'Hara in 2009 and
Christen Press in 2010 was held
to three or fewer shots; on Sunday,
20-goal-scorer senior forward
Lindsay Taylor entered the half
with just one attempt.
But this time around, Ratcliffe

Senior midfield Teresa Noyola (above) scored the only goal on a header in
Stanford's 1-0 victory over Duke in the NCAA Championship match
Sunday. It was the two-time All-American's ninth goal of the season.

wasn't necessarily expecting the
scoring to come from his top offen
sive players.
" [Duke has] a great defense," he
said. "They're very hard to break
down and score on ... It was a very
tight match."
"I thought our outside backs
were going to be the difference in
the game," Ratcliffe added later.
"Duke's back four is very solid.
Their three in the midfield are
hard-working players and we
needed to get our outside backs
forward to create a numerical ad
vantage outside and try to get in
crosses."
Indeed, it was Levin and her fel
low outside defender, Rachel
Quon, who would define the sec
ond half. Quon drew a foul to set up
a dangerous Noyola free kick two
minutes into the half, although the
Cardinal couldn't capitalize. After
a missed Stanford corner just a
minute later. Blue Devil freshman
sensation Kelley Cobb raced up
field, just one woman Quon
to beat. But the junior held her
own, and Levin swooped in from
behind the play to end Cobb's
promising rush.
Then Levin made the play that
Stanford soccer fans won't soon
forget. Taking a 53rd-minute feed
from Übogagu to the high right
side of the box, Levin battled by
two defenders as she moved to
wards the end line. Running out
of real estate, she tried to cross to
Noyola who played youth soc
cer with Levin but a Blue
Devil defender blocked the at
tempt as Levin slipped to the turf.
She scrambled to get to her feet,
fed in another ball, and the rest is
history.
"You've got to feel sorry for
Duke because that's unstoppable,"
Ratcliffe noted. "They blocked her
cross twice and she still got back up
and crossed it to the back post."
Noyola had already scored per
haps the biggest goal of the regular
season for the Cardinal, an over
time header to beat Washington.
And on a strikingly similar play
Sunday, she added the biggest goal
in Stanford soccer history to her re
sume.
"You don't get that many op
portunities at this stage," Noyola
said. "Camille played a great ball
and that shows how connected we
are. I knew exactly what she was
going to do."
The squad hadn't lost a game in
six years when scoring a goal, but

after Oklahoma State tied up a
similar game in the quarterfinals
and took the Cardinal to sudden
death overtime, Stanford knew it
still had its work cut out for it after
Noyola's tally.
An energized Molly Pathman,
coming off a two-goal performance
in the semifinals, re-entered the
game for Duke in the 67th minute
and made an instant impact. Taken
down in the box just three minutes
later, Pathman begged for a penal
ty but was not given one after Übo
gagu had been similarly spurned in
the first half. A minute later, Path
man found an open Laura Wein
berg in the box but her left-footed
deflection sailed high.
The barrage continued into the
73rd minute, when Kaitlyn Kerr
pounced on a loose ball and forced
Oliver to make a leaping save on
her roaring shot from outside the
box. On the ensuing corner, Wein
berg almost found an opening but
had her low strike blocked by
Nogueira. Hanging by a thread, the
Cardinal got the clear it needed.
"ft was the longest 20 minutes of
my life," Oliver said, referring to
the end of the game. "Everyone's
hearts were beating out of their
ears."
And they would keep doing so
late into the match. Taylor and sen
ior midfielder Kristy Zurmuhlen
helped burn the clock with strong
plays on the Blue Devils' side of
midfield, yet Duke fed the ball
back into the final third time and
time again. It looked like they had
a shot even into the 89th minute,
when the Blue Devils drew two
corner kicks.
The Cardinal fended them both
off, the same way it had fended off
the heartbreak that's been building
up since 2008, and just minutes
later the team was wearing NCAA
Champion hats and T-shirts.
"This win caps off four tremen
dous years at Stanford," Ratcliffe
said. "The last four years, this team
has been incredible, and they've
shown such great character to have
all those setbacks and come back
and fight through and achieve our
goal of winning a national champi
onship."
And when the most accom
plished senior class in Stanford soc
cer history Taylor, Noyola,
Levin and Zurmuhlen walked
off the field wearing cardinal and
white for the last time on Sunday,
they did so with more than just a
95-4-4 career record and four trips
to the College Cup behind them.
This time, they took home a trophy.
And so much more.

An energized Molly Pathman,
coming off a two-goal performance
in the semifinals, re-entered the
game for Duke in the 67th minute
and made an instant impact. Taken
down in the box just three minutes
later, Pathman begged for a penal
ty but was not given one after Übo
gagu had been similarly spurned in
the first half. A minute later, Path
man found an open Laura Wein
berg in the box but her left-footed
deflection sailed high.
The barrage continued into the
73rd minute, when Kaitlyn Kerr
pounced on a loose ball and forced
Oliver to make a leaping save on
her roaring shot from outside the
box. On the ensuing corner, Wein
berg almost found an opening but
had her low strike blocked by
Nogueira. Hanging by a thread, the
Cardinal got the clear it needed.
"ft was the longest 20 minutes of
my life," Oliver said, referring to
the end of the game. "Everyone's
hearts were beating out of their
ears."
And they would keep doing so
late into the match. Taylor and sen
ior midfielder Kristy Zurmuhlen
helped burn the clock with strong
plays on the Blue Devils' side of
midfield, yet Duke fed the ball
back into the final third time and
time again. It looked like they had
a shot even into the 89th minute,
when the Blue Devils drew two
corner kicks.
The Cardinal fended them both
off, the same way it had fended off
the heartbreak that's been building
up since 2008, and just minutes
later the team was wearing NCAA
Champion hats and T-shirts.
"This win caps off four tremen
dous years at Stanford," Ratcliffe
said. "The last four years, this team
has been incredible, and they've
shown such great character to have
all those setbacks and come back
and fight through and achieve our
goal of winning a national champi
onship."
And when the most accom
plished senior class in Stanford soc
cer history Taylor, Noyola,
Levin and Zurmuhlen walked
off the field wearing cardinal and
white for the last time on Sunday,
they did so with more than just a
95-4-4 career record and four trips
to the College Cup behind them.
This time, they took home a trophy.
And so much more.

NCAA title number 102 made
its way to the Farm this week, but
for the undefeated Stanford
women's soccer team, its run at the
College Cup meant much more

than the trophy it brought home.
When defender Camille Levin
found midfielder Teresa Noyola
waiting at the back post and Noyola
headed in the first-ever goal in a
College Cup final for the Cardinal
(25-0-1), the two seniors put a con
clusively positive stamp on careers

that had been marked by three
years of postseason disappoint
ment.

Women's soccer has been one of
the few national titles that has
seemed to just elude Stanford. Four
times in 1993, 2008, 2009 and
2010 the Cardinal reached the
Final Four only to meet heartbreak.
Two years in a row, eventual Fler
mann Trophy winners were si
lenced in the College Cup final.
And even as the Stanford squad
demonstrated its national rele
vance year-in and year-out under
head coach Paul Ratcliffe, it could
never attain the dynasty status
given to perennial champions
North Carolina and Notre Dame,
That all changed Sunday.
"This team deserves it," Noyola
said. "We've worked extremely
hard but have also shown great
character to not let the heartbreaks
of the last two seasons catch up [to
us]."
Duke (22-4-1) pressured threat
eningly at times in the final, but
solid play from the back line and
another perfect performance from
sophomore goalkeeper Emily Oliv
er between the pipes propelled
Stanford to victory and the first un
defeated season in school history.
"We didn't think about any
other game this year," Levin said.
"It was about this game. We knew
we had to come out and keep pos
session and play our game."
The Cardinal was doing just that
against the Blue Devils early on
and had several close misses in the
first half. A header from junior mid
fielder Mariah Nogueira went just
wide right in the third minute;
freshman forward Chioma Übo
gagu nearly drew a penalty kick
with her evasiveness in the 22nd
minute, but the referee held on to
his whistle.
Stemming the tide, Duke coun
tered with chances of its own and
nearly snuck one by Oliver late in
the half on a misplayed ball by the
Stanford defense. Forward Molly
Lester missed high, however, and

the back-and-forth match was
scoreless entering the half.
Though the Cardinal was con
trolling the tempo, the match still
had the potential of turning into an
other close loss, like the consecu
tive 1-0 defeats Stanford had suf
fered in the two previous finals. In
each, the Cardinal's leading scorer

Kelley O'Hara in 2009 and
Christen Press in 2010 was held
to three or fewer shots; on Sunday,
20-goal-scorer senior forward
Lindsay Taylor entered the half
with just one attempt.

Senior midfield Teresa Noyola (above) scored the only goal on a header in
Stanford's 1-0 victory over Duke in the NCAA Championship match
Sunday. It was the two-time All-American's ninth goal of the season.

wasn't necessarily expecting the
scoring to come from his top offen
sive players.
" [Duke has] a great defense," he
said. "They're very hard to break
down and score on ... It was a very
tight match."
"I thought our outside backs
were going to be the difference in
the game," Ratcliffe added later.
"Duke's back four is very solid.
Their three in the midfield are
hard-working players and we
needed to get our outside backs
forward to create a numerical ad
vantage outside and try to get in
crosses."
Indeed, it was Levin and her fel
low outside defender, Rachel
Quon, who would define the sec
ond half. Quon drew a foul to set up
a dangerous Noyola free kick two
minutes into the half, although the
Cardinal couldn't capitalize. After
a missed Stanford corner just a
minute later. Blue Devil freshman
sensation Kelley Cobb raced up
field, just one woman Quon
to beat. But the junior held her
own, and Levin swooped in from
behind the play to end Cobb's
promising rush.
Then Levin made the play that
Stanford soccer fans won't soon
forget. Taking a 53rd-minute feed
from Übogagu to the high right
side of the box, Levin battled by
two defenders as she moved to
wards the end line. Running out
of real estate, she tried to cross to
Noyola who played youth soc
cer with Levin but a Blue
Devil defender blocked the at
tempt as Levin slipped to the turf.
She scrambled to get to her feet,
fed in another ball, and the rest is
history.
"You've got to feel sorry for
Duke because that's unstoppable,"
Ratcliffe noted. "They blocked her
cross twice and she still got back up
and crossed it to the back post."
Noyola had already scored per
haps the biggest goal of the regular
season for the Cardinal, an over
time header to beat Washington.
And on a strikingly similar play
Sunday, she added the biggest goal
in Stanford soccer history to her re
sume.
"You don't get that many op
portunities at this stage," Noyola
said. "Camille played a great ball
and that shows how connected we
are. I knew exactly what she was
going to do."
The squad hadn't lost a game in
six years when scoring a goal, but

after Oklahoma State tied up a
similar game in the quarterfinals
and took the Cardinal to sudden
death overtime, Stanford knew it
still had its work cut out for it after
Noyola's tally.
An energized Molly Pathman,
coming off a two-goal performance
