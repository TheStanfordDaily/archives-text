# HEISMAN PREDICTIONS
## DAILY STAFF BREAKS DOWN THE BALLOT 
### 
Before Saturday's Heisman Trophy
ceremony, five Daily sports staffers give
their opinions on who will hoist the
hardware in New York.
MILES BENNETT-SMITH
Robert Griffin 111 has put on an unbelievable
show this season, throwing for 3,998 yards with 36
touchdowns against just six interceptions and adding
nine TDs and over 500 yards on the ground. He tore
up TCU, Oklahoma and Texas and threw for 1,201
yards in Baylor's three losses.That's stupid good, and
I think his stats have enough voters drooling to carry
him to the trophy. But the reason he doesn't get my
vote is because of what happened two weeks ago
when the Bears throttled Texas Tech with RG3
on the sideline.This Baylor offense is a machine, and
I firmly believe as good as Griffin is, the video-game
stats come from the fact that he has speedy wideouts
in a spread system and has to throw all day because
the defense isn't even mediocre it gave up fewer
than 24 points one time all season, against the vaunt
ed Lumberjacks of Stephen F.Austin. And although
I predict that it will, that shouldn't be enough to put
the trophy on your mantle.
And while this might make some of you here
upset, I'm sorry, but I don't think Andrew Luck is the
best candidate for this year's award. Toby Gerhart
was robbed two years ago, but Luck simply hasn't
been as sharp as I think he needed to be since the
USC game. His numbers are nice to look at and he is
clearly the best quarterback playing on Saturdays,
but I would not characterize very many of his games
this season as "outstanding performances." Winning
has been his and the team's goal this season, and he
is hurt by playing in a system that runs so efficiently,
but I think he could have been even greater with
what he was working with.
Although he likely won't win it, I would cast my
vote for Trent Richardson as the 2011 Heisman Tro
phy winner. Along with his impressive overall stats,
he came up big in games all year long even in the
Crimson Tide's sole defeat, he accounted for 169
yards of total offense against the best defense in the
country.
So while there are about six players who should
be in a heated conversation for the award, and I think
Richardson is the one who deserves it, it's my bet
that you'll see RG3 with tears of joy on his cheeks
Saturday night.
Prediction: 1. Robert Griffin HI, 2. Andrew Luck, 3. Trent Richardson

I'll admit that I haven't watched either Richard
son or Griffin 111 play a full game. East Coast sports
writers who voted in 2009: let's call it even.
