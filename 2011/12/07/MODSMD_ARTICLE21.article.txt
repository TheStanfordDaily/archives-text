# HEISMAN PREDICTIONS
## DAILY STAFF BREAKS DOWN THE BALLOT 
### 
Before Saturday's Heisman Trophy
ceremony, five Daily sports staffers give
their opinions on who will hoist the
hardware in New York.
MILES BENNETT-SMITH
Robert Griffin 111 has put on an unbelievable
show this season, throwing for 3,998 yards with 36
touchdowns against just six interceptions and adding
nine TDs and over 500 yards on the ground. He tore
up TCU, Oklahoma and Texas and threw for 1,201
yards in Baylor's three losses.That's stupid good, and
I think his stats have enough voters drooling to carry
him to the trophy. But the reason he doesn't get my
vote is because of what happened two weeks ago
when the Bears throttled Texas Tech with RG3
on the sideline.This Baylor offense is a machine, and
I firmly believe as good as Griffin is, the video-game
stats come from the fact that he has speedy wideouts
in a spread system and has to throw all day because
the defense isn't even mediocre it gave up fewer
than 24 points one time all season, against the vaunt
ed Lumberjacks of Stephen F.Austin. And although
I predict that it will, that shouldn't be enough to put
the trophy on your mantle.
And while this might make some of you here
upset, I'm sorry, but I don't think Andrew Luck is the
best candidate for this year's award. Toby Gerhart
was robbed two years ago, but Luck simply hasn't
been as sharp as I think he needed to be since the
USC game. His numbers are nice to look at and he is
clearly the best quarterback playing on Saturdays,
but I would not characterize very many of his games
this season as "outstanding performances." Winning
has been his and the team's goal this season, and he
is hurt by playing in a system that runs so efficiently,
but I think he could have been even greater with
what he was working with.
Although he likely won't win it, I would cast my
vote for Trent Richardson as the 2011 Heisman Tro
phy winner. Along with his impressive overall stats,
he came up big in games all year long even in the
Crimson Tide's sole defeat, he accounted for 169
yards of total offense against the best defense in the
country.
So while there are about six players who should
be in a heated conversation for the award, and I think
Richardson is the one who deserves it, it's my bet
that you'll see RG3 with tears of joy on his cheeks
Saturday night.
Prediction: 1. Robert Griffin HI, 2. Andrew Luck, 3. Trent Richardson
JOSEPH BEYDA
I'll admit that I haven't watched either Richard
son or Griffin 111 play a full game. East Coast sports
writers who voted in 2009: let's call it even.
But seriously. Luck has it all. I
won't (rather, don't have enough
space to) explain what I mean by that,
though David Shaw went out of his
way to do so last week if you needed a
reminder. Given enough time to per
colate, I think Shaw's extensive com
ments on Luck's play-calling abilities
are going to have their desired effect
on voters nationwide. Last year we
were talking about Owen Marecic's
two-way skills in the age of one-way
players; now we're talking about a
guy who's practically a player-coach
given how much larger his role is than
those of most collegiate athletes.
It's going to be much closer than
any of us would hope, thanks to the
uncalled-for blowback from Luck's
letdown against Oregon, which was
n't really that terrible, to be honest.
But Richardson and Griffin 111 also
lost the biggest games of their respec
tive seasons. Stanford's battered re
ceiving corps certainly didn't help
Luck, and hopefully the same East
Coast-biased pundits who were mak
ing a huge deal of this in the preseason
to try to debunk the Cardinal's na
tional contender status won't have
forgotten Luck's limited targets.
And I'm sure you've heard this
many times before, but Luck definite
ly deserves some significant credit for
coming back to school. Not to knock
Richardson or Griffin 111, but positive
role models are crucial in a college
sports era filled with scandals.
Luck is the logical choice, the de
servedly hyped-up poster boy of col
lege football and unquestionably the
best player in the country. My gut feel
ing is that enough voters will recog
nize that. If so, Stanford will have its
second Heisman winner; if not, it will
likely become the first school in histo
ry to field three straight runner-ups.
And if Luck somehow drops below
second, Cardinal fans would be more
than justified in unplugging their TV
sets.
Prediction: 1. Andrew Luck, 2. Trent Richardson,
3. Robert Griffin 111

JACK BLANCHAT
After watching a lot of football
this season, I can truly say it's harder
than I can ever remember to come up
with someone who deserves this
year's Heisman Trophy. I don't know
how you pick a winner, but I'll try.
While I think Andrew Luck is the best
player and far and away the best pro
prospect in the country, I believe the
award for the nation's "most out
standing player" deserves to go to
Robert Griffin. When you look at his
stats, they're all substantially better
than Luck's more touchdowns,
more passing yards, more rushing
yards, fewer interceptions and he's
had several big wins and "Heisman
moments" in big games. Unfortunate
ly for Luck, his season came down to
just one game if the Cardinal beats
Oregon, he's the winner without a
doubt. I just don't see the voters leav
ing Griffin off their ballots after his re
markable season, and that should be
enough to carry him to the podium in
New York City.
Prediction: 1. Robert Griffin 111, 2. Andrew Luck, 3.
Trent Richardson/Tyrann Mathieu

JACOB JAFFE
A week ago, I was completely set
on my belief that somehow Trent
Richardson was going to sneak ahead

of Andrew Luck to claim the Heis
man Trophy and force Stanford into
its third-straight runner-up finish.
After Saturday's games, I'm
forced to revise my opinion, but one
thing has not changed: Luck will still
be the Cardinal's third straight sec
ond-place finisher. However, my firm
belief that the Heisman race was
down to Richardson and Luck was
rocked by the surge in support for
Robert Griffin 111 after his demoli
tion of the previously formidable
Texas defense.
Mark Ingram played on the last
weekend in 2009 while Toby Gerhart
didn't, and that cost Gerhart the Heis
man. In this case, RG3 played while
Richardson and Luck didn't, and that
could be the difference once again.
After being a distant third in the race
just a few weeks ago, Griffin has made
himself the clear favorite, even stating
on national television that he will win.
I haven't seen anything that would
make me disagree. He's got the num
bers (gaudy yardage and touchdown
totals through the air and on the
ground, about to set the NCAA sin
gle-season record for passing efficien
cy), the charisma (he actually gives
good interviews) and the Heisman
moments (season-opening thriller
over TCU, stunning upset of Okla
homa).
Luck should slot in at second be
cause Richardson will lose too many
votes to Montee Ball and Tyrann
Mathieu, the other two finalists who
played (and played well) on the final
weekend.
Prediction: 1. Robert Griffin 111, 2. Andrew Luck,
3. Trent Richardson

ZACH ZIMMERMAN
It's hard for me to consider the
possibility of having a member of
Stanford football finish runner-up in
three straight seasons, but I'd be a fool
not to. Andrew Luck is, and I say this
without any hesitation, the best play
er in the country. The Heisman Tro
phy doesn't care. The voting guide
lines for the award are as nonsensical
as the BCS, and the subjective nature
of the process makes it nearly impos
sible to predict what will happen from
year to year. Will Luck get his fair
share of first-place votes? Absolutely.
Does he have the numbers to win
over the hearts of the statistics-ob
sessed voters? Not a chance. I whole
heartedly support and agree with
David Shaw's last-minute push for his
quarterback, but if the past two years
are any indication, it may be too little,
too late. Luck goes home empty
handed once again, this time as the
victim of a number-padding system.

While I think Andrew Luck is the best
player and far and away the best pro
prospect in the country, I believe the
award for the nation's "most out
standing player" deserves to go to
Robert Griffin. When you look at his
stats, they're all substantially better
than Luck's more touchdowns,
more passing yards, more rushing
yards, fewer interceptions and he's
had several big wins and "Heisman
moments" in big games. Unfortunate
ly for Luck, his season came down to
just one game if the Cardinal beats
Oregon, he's the winner without a
doubt. I just don't see the voters leav
ing Griffin off their ballots after his re
markable season, and that should be
enough to carry him to the podium in
New York City.
Prediction: 1. Robert Griffin 111, 2. Andrew Luck, 3.
Trent Richardson/Tyrann Mathieu

JACOB JAFFE
A week ago, I was completely set
on my belief that somehow Trent
Richardson was going to sneak ahead

of Andrew Luck to claim the Heis
man Trophy and force Stanford into
its third-straight runner-up finish.
After Saturday's games, I'm
forced to revise my opinion, but one
thing has not changed: Luck will still
be the Cardinal's third straight sec
ond-place finisher. However, my firm
belief that the Heisman race was
down to Richardson and Luck was
rocked by the surge in support for
Robert Griffin 111 after his demoli
tion of the previously formidable
Texas defense.
Mark Ingram played on the last
weekend in 2009 while Toby Gerhart
didn't, and that cost Gerhart the Heis
man. In this case, RG3 played while
Richardson and Luck didn't, and that
could be the difference once again.
After being a distant third in the race
just a few weeks ago, Griffin has made
himself the clear favorite, even stating
on national television that he will win.
I haven't seen anything that would
make me disagree. He's got the num
bers (gaudy yardage and touchdown
totals through the air and on the
ground, about to set the NCAA sin
gle-season record for passing efficien
cy), the charisma (he actually gives
good interviews) and the Heisman
moments (season-opening thriller
over TCU, stunning upset of Okla
homa).
Luck should slot in at second be
cause Richardson will lose too many
votes to Montee Ball and Tyrann
Mathieu, the other two finalists who
played (and played well) on the final
weekend.
Prediction: 1. Robert Griffin 111, 2. Andrew Luck,
3. Trent Richardson

ZACH ZIMMERMAN
It's hard for me to consider the
possibility of having a member of
Stanford football finish runner-up in
three straight seasons, but I'd be a fool
not to. Andrew Luck is, and I say this
without any hesitation, the best play
er in the country. The Heisman Tro
phy doesn't care. The voting guide
lines for the award are as nonsensical
as the BCS, and the subjective nature
of the process makes it nearly impos
sible to predict what will happen from
year to year. Will Luck get his fair
share of first-place votes? Absolutely.
Does he have the numbers to win
over the hearts of the statistics-ob
sessed voters? Not a chance. I whole
heartedly support and agree with
David Shaw's last-minute push for his
quarterback, but if the past two years
are any indication, it may be too little,
too late. Luck goes home empty
handed once again, this time as the
victim of a number-padding system.
Prediction: 1. Robert Griffin 111, 2. Andrew Luck,
3. Trent Richardson
Before Saturday's Heisman Trophy
ceremony, five Daily sports staffers give
their opinions on who will hoist the
hardware in New York.
MILES BENNETT-SMITH
Robert Griffin 111 has put on an unbelievable
show this season, throwing for 3,998 yards with 36
touchdowns against just six interceptions and adding
nine TDs and over 500 yards on the ground. He tore
up TCU, Oklahoma and Texas and threw for 1,201
yards in Baylor's three losses.That's stupid good, and
I think his stats have enough voters drooling to carry
him to the trophy. But the reason he doesn't get my
vote is because of what happened two weeks ago
when the Bears throttled Texas Tech with RG3
on the sideline.This Baylor offense is a machine, and
I firmly believe as good as Griffin is, the video-game
stats come from the fact that he has speedy wideouts
in a spread system and has to throw all day because
the defense isn't even mediocre it gave up fewer
than 24 points one time all season, against the vaunt
ed Lumberjacks of Stephen F.Austin. And although
I predict that it will, that shouldn't be enough to put
the trophy on your mantle.
And while this might make some of you here
upset, I'm sorry, but I don't think Andrew Luck is the
best candidate for this year's award. Toby Gerhart
was robbed two years ago, but Luck simply hasn't
been as sharp as I think he needed to be since the
USC game. His numbers are nice to look at and he is
clearly the best quarterback playing on Saturdays,
but I would not characterize very many of his games
this season as "outstanding performances." Winning
has been his and the team's goal this season, and he
is hurt by playing in a system that runs so efficiently,
but I think he could have been even greater with
what he was working with.
Although he likely won't win it, I would cast my
vote for Trent Richardson as the 2011 Heisman Tro
phy winner. Along with his impressive overall stats,
he came up big in games all year long even in the
Crimson Tide's sole defeat, he accounted for 169
yards of total offense against the best defense in the
country.
So while there are about six players who should
be in a heated conversation for the award, and I think
Richardson is the one who deserves it, it's my bet
that you'll see RG3 with tears of joy on his cheeks
Saturday night.
Prediction: 1. Robert Griffin HI, 2. Andrew Luck, 3. Trent Richardson
JOSEPH BEYDA
I'll admit that I haven't watched either Richard
son or Griffin 111 play a full game. East Coast sports
writers who voted in 2009: let's call it even.
But seriously. Luck has it all. I
won't (rather, don't have enough
space to) explain what I mean by that,
though David Shaw went out of his
way to do so last week if you needed a
reminder. Given enough time to per
colate, I think Shaw's extensive com
ments on Luck's play-calling abilities
are going to have their desired effect
on voters nationwide. Last year we
were talking about Owen Marecic's
two-way skills in the age of one-way
players; now we're talking about a
guy who's practically a player-coach
given how much larger his role is than
those of most collegiate athletes.
It's going to be much closer than
any of us would hope, thanks to the
uncalled-for blowback from Luck's
letdown against Oregon, which was
n't really that terrible, to be honest.
But Richardson and Griffin 111 also
lost the biggest games of their respec
tive seasons. Stanford's battered re
ceiving corps certainly didn't help
Luck, and hopefully the same East
Coast-biased pundits who were mak
ing a huge deal of this in the preseason
to try to debunk the Cardinal's na
tional contender status won't have
forgotten Luck's limited targets.
And I'm sure you've heard this
many times before, but Luck definite
ly deserves some significant credit for
coming back to school. Not to knock
Richardson or Griffin 111, but positive
role models are crucial in a college
sports era filled with scandals.
Luck is the logical choice, the de
servedly hyped-up poster boy of col
lege football and unquestionably the
best player in the country. My gut feel
ing is that enough voters will recog
nize that. If so, Stanford will have its
second Heisman winner; if not, it will
likely become the first school in histo
ry to field three straight runner-ups.
And if Luck somehow drops below
second, Cardinal fans would be more
than justified in unplugging their TV
sets.
