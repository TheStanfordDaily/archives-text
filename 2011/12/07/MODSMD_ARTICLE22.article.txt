# BOUND TO BE A FIESTA
## CARD SET TO PLAY OK STATE IN BOWL 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After completing its second-straight 11-
1 season, the Stanford football team is once
again bound for a BCS bowl.
This time, the No. 4 Cardinal (11-1,8-1
Pac-12) will head south to Glendale, Ariz, to
take on the No. 3 Oklahoma State Cowboys
(11-1,8-1 Big 12) in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl
on Jan. 3 in a matchup that pairs two of the
country's best offenses against one another.
"I think this game is going to be great for
college football," Stanford head coach
David Shaw said after his team received its
BCS bid. "I think it's going to be exciting. I
think it's going to be one of the best bowl
games this year."
Oklahoma State comes into the Fiesta
Bowl after capturing the Big 12 champi
onship by routing rival Oklahoma 44-10,
but it was left out of the BCS title game
after it couldn't push past No. 2 Alabama in

the final BCS standings.
And while the Cowboys were at the
heart of the latest BCS title game contro
versy, Shaw, who hasn't been shy about crit
icizing the BCS system, said he couldn't
know how the Cowboys would react to
being snubbed for the title game.
"I have no idea. Oh gosh, I don't know.
I'm not experienced enough to be able to
put myself in other people's shoes," he said.
"They did get some push from some
people to be in the national championship
game, and they earned that, not just from
how they played against Oklahoma but
how they played all year," Shaw continued.
"They had one loss in a tough circumstance,
but at the same time, the BCS put the two of
us together."
Even without the somewhat controver
sial status of the matchup, the desert show
down appears likely to be one of the most
exciting games of the year. The Cowboys
and Cardinal bring in the nation's second
and fifth-most prolific scoring offenses, re
spectively, and all eyes will be on the Cow
boys' high-flying duo of quarterback Bran
don Weeden and wide receiver Justin
Blackmon against two-time Heisman final

ist Andrew Luck.
Weeden has thrown for 4,328 yards this
year, the third most in the nation, and
Blackmon, who won last year's Biletnikoff
Award as the nation's top receiver, had
1,336 yards and 15 touchdowns this season.
Shaw, a former wide receiver at Stan
ford, saved his highest praise for Blackmon,
the engine of the Cowboys' attack.
"That guy wearing number 81 is some
thing special," he said. "They have other
guys, they have good running backs, but
Justin Blackmon, I think, is a special, special
player."
Shaw also compared the Cowboys'
deadly offense to conference rival Oregon,
but explained that Oklahoma State's wide
open spread attack was different from the
Ducks' run-based game.
"They've got the combination of team
speed and playing speed, where they run a
lot of plays in a short time. They don't hud
dle up, they don't spend time between
plays," Shaw said. "You see the receivers
catch the ball, get tackled and run back to
get lined up again."


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Redshirt senior Coby Fleener put on an impressive performance during last season's Orange Bowl win over Virginia Tech with three touchdown
catches. He and the rest of Stanford's tight end core will need to shine if Stanford wants to keep up with Ok. State in the Fiesta Bowl.
But before the Cardinal can
start to focus on stopping and
outscoring Oklahoma State, it
must first deal with the challenges
that come with more than a month
between games. In addition to hav
ing finals week interposed between
the bowl selection and the game,
the Cardinal will also have to make
do with its starting quarterback
bouncing around the country for
various awards shows, including the
Heisman Trophy ceremony this
Saturday.
Shaw said that the Cardinal was
going to use its extended, if inter
rupted, practice time to focus first
on jump-starting an offense that
has struggled in its last three games.
Partly due to injuries to offen
sive weapons Zach Ertz and Chris
Owusu, the Cardinal has posted its
three lowest point totals of the sea
son and turned the ball over a com
bined eight times.
"All coaches have the same dis
ease, and sometimes [having] too
long to prepare is really bad for us
because we try to do too much,"
Shaw said when discussing the Car
dinal's practice schedule. "We'll
take a cursory look at Oklahoma

State with our players, but a lot of
our first few practices are going to
be us working on us.
"We're going to work hard to do
the things that we need to do better,
and as we get out of finals week
we'll really have some of those Ok
lahoma State-dedicated practices,"
he continued.

But despite the challenges that
come with awards season, almost a
month of downtime before the
game and Oklahoma State receiv
ing the bulk of the national atten
tion, Shaw said the goals that were
set out well before the season were
as clear as ever.
"We've been a team that's
been ranked in the top 10 the en
tire year, [and] that's probably
been talked about the least.That's
fine. Our guys don't care; we don't
play for that. We play to earn re
spect on the field and to earn re
spect in the rankings, and that's
what we have," he said. "What you
do on Saturday is who you are,
and we're going to have the best
resume that we can."
Stanford and Oklahoma State
will face off in the Fiesta Bowl in
Glendale, Ariz, at University of
Phoenix Stadium on Jan. 2 at 5:30

people to be in the national championship
game, and they earned that, not just from
how they played against Oklahoma but
how they played all year," Shaw continued.
"They had one loss in a tough circumstance,
but at the same time, the BCS put the two of
us together."
Even without the somewhat controver
sial status of the matchup, the desert show
down appears likely to be one of the most
exciting games of the year. The Cowboys
and Cardinal bring in the nation's second
and fifth-most prolific scoring offenses, re
spectively, and all eyes will be on the Cow
boys' high-flying duo of quarterback Bran
don Weeden and wide receiver Justin
Blackmon against two-time Heisman final

ist Andrew Luck.
Weeden has thrown for 4,328 yards this
year, the third most in the nation, and
Blackmon, who won last year's Biletnikoff
Award as the nation's top receiver, had
1,336 yards and 15 touchdowns this season.
Shaw, a former wide receiver at Stan
ford, saved his highest praise for Blackmon,
the engine of the Cowboys' attack.
"That guy wearing number 81 is some
thing special," he said. "They have other
guys, they have good running backs, but
Justin Blackmon, I think, is a special, special
player."
Shaw also compared the Cowboys'
deadly offense to conference rival Oregon,
but explained that Oklahoma State's wide
open spread attack was different from the
Ducks' run-based game.
"They've got the combination of team
speed and playing speed, where they run a
lot of plays in a short time. They don't hud
dle up, they don't spend time between
plays," Shaw said. "You see the receivers
catch the ball, get tackled and run back to
get lined up again."

Redshirt senior Coby Fleener put on an impressive performance during last season's Orange Bowl win over Virginia Tech with three touchdown
catches. He and the rest of Stanford's tight end core will need to shine if Stanford wants to keep up with Ok. State in the Fiesta Bowl.
But before the Cardinal can
start to focus on stopping and
outscoring Oklahoma State, it
must first deal with the challenges
that come with more than a month
between games. In addition to hav
ing finals week interposed between
the bowl selection and the game,
the Cardinal will also have to make
do with its starting quarterback
bouncing around the country for
various awards shows, including the
Heisman Trophy ceremony this
Saturday.
Shaw said that the Cardinal was
going to use its extended, if inter
rupted, practice time to focus first
on jump-starting an offense that
has struggled in its last three games.
Partly due to injuries to offen
sive weapons Zach Ertz and Chris
Owusu, the Cardinal has posted its
three lowest point totals of the sea
son and turned the ball over a com
bined eight times.
"All coaches have the same dis
ease, and sometimes [having] too
long to prepare is really bad for us
because we try to do too much,"
Shaw said when discussing the Car
dinal's practice schedule. "We'll
take a cursory look at Oklahoma

State with our players, but a lot of
our first few practices are going to
be us working on us.
"We're going to work hard to do
the things that we need to do better,
and as we get out of finals week
we'll really have some of those Ok
lahoma State-dedicated practices,"
he continued.

But despite the challenges that
come with awards season, almost a
month of downtime before the
game and Oklahoma State receiv
ing the bulk of the national atten
tion, Shaw said the goals that were
set out well before the season were
as clear as ever.
"We've been a team that's
been ranked in the top 10 the en
tire year, [and] that's probably
been talked about the least.That's
fine. Our guys don't care; we don't
play for that. We play to earn re
spect on the field and to earn re
spect in the rankings, and that's
what we have," he said. "What you
do on Saturday is who you are,
and we're going to have the best
resume that we can."
Stanford and Oklahoma State
will face off in the Fiesta Bowl in
Glendale, Ariz, at University of
Phoenix Stadium on Jan. 2 at 5:30
p.m. Television coverage will be on

After completing its second-straight 11-
1 season, the Stanford football team is once
again bound for a BCS bowl.
This time, the No. 4 Cardinal (11-1,8-1
Pac-12) will head south to Glendale, Ariz, to
take on the No. 3 Oklahoma State Cowboys
(11-1,8-1 Big 12) in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl
on Jan. 3 in a matchup that pairs two of the
country's best offenses against one another.
"I think this game is going to be great for
college football," Stanford head coach
David Shaw said after his team received its
BCS bid. "I think it's going to be exciting. I
think it's going to be one of the best bowl
games this year."
Oklahoma State comes into the Fiesta
Bowl after capturing the Big 12 champi
onship by routing rival Oklahoma 44-10,
but it was left out of the BCS title game
after it couldn't push past No. 2 Alabama in

the final BCS standings.
And while the Cowboys were at the
heart of the latest BCS title game contro
versy, Shaw, who hasn't been shy about crit
icizing the BCS system, said he couldn't
know how the Cowboys would react to
being snubbed for the title game.
"I have no idea. Oh gosh, I don't know.
I'm not experienced enough to be able to
put myself in other people's shoes," he said.
"They did get some push from some
people to be in the national championship
game, and they earned that, not just from
how they played against Oklahoma but
how they played all year," Shaw continued.
"They had one loss in a tough circumstance,
but at the same time, the BCS put the two of
us together."

sial status of the matchup, the desert show
down appears likely to be one of the most
exciting games of the year. The Cowboys
