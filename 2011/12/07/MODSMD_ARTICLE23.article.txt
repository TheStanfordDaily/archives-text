# Footballs will fly in Fiesta Bowl
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Well, here we are. Our
BCS overlords have
spoken, and the
bowl games are set.
And from a Stan
ford perspective, things couldn't have
gone much better. The Cardinal will
play in not-too-far-away Glendale,
Ariz., against arguably the second
best team in the country on Jan. 2.
Here's Stat on the Back's first look at
the numbers of Stanford's Fiesta
Bowl matchup with Oklahoma State.
Number of the game: 92.92
What it means: Stanford and Okla
homa State, two of the top five offens
es in the country, combine for 92.92
points per game. Yes, you read that
right.
Why it matters: TSU and Alabama
will play a week later in what is sup
posedly the meeting of the two best
teams in the nation. But they could
play a thousand more rematches and
those teams wouldn't come close to
approaching 90 points in a game.
You want offense? This is a game
for offense. Stanford boasts Andrew
Luck, the best player in the country
(regardless of the Heisman results).
The Cardinal has a running game that
has already put up 446 yards in a game
against a team with a winning record
(yep, Alabama, those teams exist.) In
12 games this year, Stanford scored at
least 44 points seven times.
But Stanford's may not even be
the best offense in this game. Okla
homa State boasts its own prolific
quarterback in Brandon Weeden,
whose grandkids will take over for
him in Stillwater next year. (Okay, I
guess he's not that old. But he did
graduate high school when Luck was
12. Seriously. And the next year, he
was traded to the Dodgers for Kevin
Brown. Yes, that Kevin Brown.) Wee
den has been putting up insane num
bers this season, and those are certain
ly helped by Justin Blackmon, who is
arguably the best wide receiver in the
country. The Cowboys have even
found a running game this year, which
is just unfair for an offense that al
ready ranks second in the nation in
passing and scoring. Oh yeah, and
Okie State has scored at least 44
points eight times.
Needless to say, this game should
be fun.
Other notable numbers:
1: With these crazy-good passing
games, who leads these two teams in
points and yards? That would be Cow
boy running back Joseph Randle, who
has 25 touchdowns this season, includ
ing 23 on the ground. To put this in
perspective, Stanford's trio of Stepfan
Taylor, Tyler Gaffney and Jeremy
Stewart have 23 rushing touchdowns
combined. Randle has more rushing
yards than Taylor on fewer carries, and
he also has 38 catches, more than any
Stanford player besides Griff Whalen.
Watch out for No. 1 in orange and
black.
26: On the other hand, Stanford
never relies on one player to do all of
its scoring. The Cardinal is all about
balance, and few teams do it so well.
Stanford is one of just three teams to
rank in the top 26 nationally in passing
and rushing on offense, along with
Baylor and Texas A&M.
Of course, those two teams both
struggle on defense, while Stanford's
balance carries over to the other side
of the ball. The Cardinal is also one of
just three teams to rank in the top 26
in scoring and total offense and scor
ing and total defense, along with Wis
consin and Boise State. It's hard to get
much more balanced than that.
113: Meanwhile, Oklahoma State
cares as much about balance as the
BCS bowls do about selecting the best
teams. The aforementioned Black
mon had a historic 2010 campaign,
running away with the Biletnikoff
Award for top receiver in the country
while shattering several records. This
year hasn't gone as well for the red
shirt junior he only has 1,336 yards
on 113 catches. 113!!! Despite the
"drop-off," Blackmon has more yards
and touchdowns than Stanford's top
two receivers (Whalen and Coby
Fleener) combined and almost half as
many grabs as the Cardinal's entire
team. He is once again in the running
for best receiver in the country, and
he's undoubtedly the scariest player
for the Stanford secondary.
42: One of the most intriguing as
pects of this game is Oklahoma
State's defense. The offense gets all
the hype, but it's the Cowboy defense
that has elevated Mike Gundy's crew
to a team that is merely settling for its
first-ever BCS bowl. Oklahoma State
is 107 th out of 120 in yards allowed,
yet they only give up about 25 points
per game.
How do they do it? Turnovers. The
