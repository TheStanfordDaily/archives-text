### ANDERS MIKKELSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 11-seeded Stanford
women's volleyball team entered
the NCAA Tournament with high
expectations and hopes of turning
its tumultuous regular season
around after dropping three of its
last five matches. Unfortunately,
just two days into the tournament,
the Cardinal (22-8) found itself
knocked out, victims of a huge
upset at the hands of unseeded
Michigan (22-12).

The Cardinal's first-round
matchup was against Sacred Heart
(27-8), the winner of the Northeast
Conference. Eager to prove that it
was ready to compete for a nation
al title, Stanford came out in force
in the first set. Redshirt freshman
outside hitter Lydia Bai stole the
show early, posting seven kills and
two blocks while leading the Car
dinal to a 25-14 victory in the set.
Overall, the Stanford defense was
tremendous, holding the Pioneers
to a .057 hitting percentage.
The second set did not go quite
as well for Stanford, however. The
Cardinal looked sloppy through
out, committing five net violations
and nine total errors. Despite four
kills and six digs from sophomore
outside hitter Rachel Williams,
who would finish with 18 and 11 for
her 20th double-double of the
year, Stanford dropped the second
set 25-23.

The Cardinal began to regain its
dominance in the third set, prima
rily as a result of its net defense.
Sophomore middle blocker Carly
Wopat had one of her strongest
games in college, posting a career
high 13 blocks to go with her nine
kills. She registered five blocks in
the third set alone, as Stanford
eked out a 25-22 win.

And Stanford proceeded to win
the fourth and deciding set 25-11 in
impressive fashion. Junior setter

Karissa Cook registered 10 assists
and two blocks in the set. She, too,
would finish with huge offensive
numbers, putting up 46 assists, 14
digs and a career-high eight blocks
in the match. The Cardinal im
proved to 31-0 in the first round of
the NCAA Tournament and await
ed its matchup with Michigan the
next day.
The first set with the Wolverines
was a back-and-forth affair, but
Williams stole the show with six
kills on a .600 hitting percentage.
She would ultimately finish with a
team-high 16. The Cardinal was
able to hold the Wolverines to a
.158 hitting percentage while hit
ting .314 itself and took the first set
25-20.
For the second straight day,
Stanford struggled in the second
set. Michigan took an early lead
and never relinquished it, winning
25-17. Junior libero Hannah Ben
jamin played tremendous defense
with seven of her 19 digs in the set,
but it was simply not enough to
stop the ferocious Wolverine at
tack.
Stanford went into the break
knowing it needed to turn its game
around or risk ending its season in
the second round at home. The
third set was competitive early,
with neither team taking a lead of
over one point. Then, with Stan
ford nursing a slight 11-10 advan
tage, Michigan began to take over.
The Wolverines scored four
straight points and eight of the next
10 to take a commanding lead.
Redshirt junior opposite Claire
McElheny paced Michigan with
five kills in the set, as the Wolver
ines won 25-18. McElheny would
finish with a match-high 18 kills on
a .410 hitting percentage.
The fourth set was again close
early, but two straight service aces
by freshman setter Lexi Danne
miller helped the Wolverines pull
away. Dannemiller would finish

with five aces, and Michigan had 12
as a team. The terrific service game
of the Wolverines had a major im
pact on the match's ultimate out
come, Stanford dropped the final
set 25-20, losing the match and
ending its season.

Thus, Stanford's quest for its
seventh NCAA championship
ended much earlier than anyone
could have expected. Luckily, with
just two graduating seniors and
