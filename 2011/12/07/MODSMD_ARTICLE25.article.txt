# Searching for a BCS replacement
## 
### Tom Taylor 
So another college football
regular season has come to
a close, and what have we
learned? I'm not entirely
sure.
Unsatisfied with Stanford's rank
ing in the major polls, one of my
friends recently started creating his
own system, which I'll blatantly plug:
CSSportsßank.com. The idea was to
try to consider just the results from
the current season and not the institu
tional bias many of the existing
human polls are famous for. Ironical
ly, though, he ended up ranking the

Cardinal lower than the BCS did (No.
6) and Boise State far higher (No. 2).
Apart from the well-known four
or so ranking systems, searching the
Internet throws up a host of other at
tempts to create accurate and useful
ways to rate and compare football
schools. The one thing they all have in
common, though, is that none of them
seem particularly satisfactory to any
one but the two teams who get sent to
the national championship game.
There is hard science thrown into
many of these rankings, but there is a
hefty dose of magic too; how to deal

with the two intangibles of strength of
schedule and home field advantage
remains an open question.
One of the greatest mysteries to
me is how everyone that is, every
one except the fans of the two teams
given a shot at the national title and
the suits in their smoke-filled rooms
at NCAA/BCS headquarters
agrees that college football needs
playoffs, yet there is no sign of these
happening in the immediate future.
In the week after UEFA decided the
groups for next year's Euro 2012 soc
cer tournament, the comparison

seems stark. What if, instead of giving
16 teams a real shot at that title, the
existing BCS system was used?
There are no undefeated Euro
pean teams in the top 30 of the FIFA
rankings since the last major tourna
ment, the 2010 World Cup, but there
are three one-loss teams: Germany,
England and Greece. While Spain
reigning world and European cham
pions— and the Netherlands are
ranked first and second in the world,
they have four and three losses, re
spectively, and so it would be impossi
ble to justify sending either to the
championship game. With just two
losses and one more win than Croatia,
France would sneak into fourth to se
cure an automatic bid to one of the
other four big bowl games.
In addition to all of the teams men
tioned so far (excluding Croatia), four
more won their conferences, i.e. quali
fying groups, and thus should get auto
matic bids to these other games. The
final spot should go to Croatia, but in
true BCS style, Portugal would proba
bly steal the place from them with a
longer history and more appearances
at big tournaments.
Taking into account both historical
bias and general rankings, this means
Germany would face England in the
championship game, while the other
major contests could look something
like this: Spain vs. Portugal, Nether
lands vs. Denmark, Greece vs. France
and Italy vs. Russia.
Anyone who thinks this would be
a good idea needs their head exam
ined. More than any amount of the fi
nancial instability that is currently
tearing down European institutions, if
anything like this scenario were ever
attempted, it would lead to open re
volt. At best, fans would just stay away
from their TV screens; at worst, it
might turn nasty. Given both Euro
pean soccer fans' ability to cause trou
ble and the continent's history of start
ing world wars, I wouldn't suggest try
ing out this thought experiment.
If nothing else, the BCS system is
elitist, inherently unfair and at odds
with the American Dream. Undefeat
ed all year until last Saturday's game,
Houston was doing everything in its

power to justify a national champi
onship berth, but regardless it never
entered the conversation. Alabama
had the opportunity to secure its spot
already this season against No. 1 LSU
and blew it, yet everyone still expected
it to be there. I even feel slightly sorry
for two-loss Oregon, ranked down at
No. 6 even after an impressive victory
over No. 4 Stanford. The problem too
is that in the average year, even the na
tional champion can't unquestionably
claim to have been the best. I think it
would be generous to consider the
Cardinal the No. 1 team this year, but
at No. 4 it hasn't even been tested by
any of the teams ahead of it. The clos
est LSU and Oklahoma State have
come to that is sharing the same oppo
sition as Stanford this year (Oregon
and Arizona, respectively).
Making the comparison again to
Euro 2012, the big excuse money
that I hear against playoffs falls
short. Sure, the five BCS bowls gener
ate a lot of TV money during the week
or so that they are on, but that major
soccer tournament will dominate the
airwaves in Europe for a month. The
other get-out clause is the physicality
of the game, but somehow NFL play
ers cope with this, and spreading an
eight-team college playoff system
over the three-week holiday break
would provide easily enough time for
recovery. No team would play more
than three games, fans would feel
compelled to watch most of the seven
games to see how the opposition is
doing and at the end we would
have a true champion.
I say the BCS has a choice. Change
the system now, or we change it for
you.

the aforementioned BCS headquar
ters if things get ugly. If you 're looking
for directions, give him a holler at
torn. taylor@stanford. edu.

No. 6 even after an impressive victory

would be generous to consider the
Cardinal the No. 1 team this year, but
at No. 4 it hasn't even been tested by

eight-team college playoff system
over the three-week holiday break

than three games, fans would feel

So another college football
regular season has come to
a close, and what have we
learned? I'm not entirely
sure.
Unsatisfied with Stanford's rank
ing in the major polls, one of my
friends recently started creating his
own system, which I'll blatantly plug:
CSSportsßank.com. The idea was to
try to consider just the results from
the current season and not the institu
tional bias many of the existing
human polls are famous for. Ironical
ly, though, he ended up ranking the

Cardinal lower than the BCS did (No.
6) and Boise State far higher (No. 2).
Apart from the well-known four
or so ranking systems, searching the
Internet throws up a host of other at
tempts to create accurate and useful
ways to rate and compare football
schools. The one thing they all have in
common, though, is that none of them
seem particularly satisfactory to any
one but the two teams who get sent to
the national championship game.
There is hard science thrown into
many of these rankings, but there is a
hefty dose of magic too; how to deal

with the two intangibles of strength of
schedule and home field advantage
remains an open question.
One of the greatest mysteries to
me is how everyone that is, every
one except the fans of the two teams
given a shot at the national title and
the suits in their smoke-filled rooms
at NCAA/BCS headquarters
agrees that college football needs
playoffs, yet there is no sign of these
happening in the immediate future.
In the week after UEFA decided the
groups for next year's Euro 2012 soc
cer tournament, the comparison

seems stark. What if, instead of giving
16 teams a real shot at that title, the
existing BCS system was used?
There are no undefeated Euro
pean teams in the top 30 of the FIFA
rankings since the last major tourna
ment, the 2010 World Cup, but there
are three one-loss teams: Germany,
England and Greece. While Spain
reigning world and European cham
pions— and the Netherlands are
ranked first and second in the world,
they have four and three losses, re
spectively, and so it would be impossi
ble to justify sending either to the
championship game. With just two
losses and one more win than Croatia,
France would sneak into fourth to se
cure an automatic bid to one of the
other four big bowl games.
In addition to all of the teams men
tioned so far (excluding Croatia), four
more won their conferences, i.e. quali
fying groups, and thus should get auto
matic bids to these other games. The
final spot should go to Croatia, but in
true BCS style, Portugal would proba
bly steal the place from them with a
longer history and more appearances
at big tournaments.
Taking into account both historical
bias and general rankings, this means
Germany would face England in the
championship game, while the other
major contests could look something
like this: Spain vs. Portugal, Nether
lands vs. Denmark, Greece vs. France
and Italy vs. Russia.
Anyone who thinks this would be
a good idea needs their head exam
ined. More than any amount of the fi
nancial instability that is currently
tearing down European institutions, if
anything like this scenario were ever
attempted, it would lead to open re
volt. At best, fans would just stay away
from their TV screens; at worst, it
might turn nasty. Given both Euro
pean soccer fans' ability to cause trou
ble and the continent's history of start
ing world wars, I wouldn't suggest try
ing out this thought experiment.
