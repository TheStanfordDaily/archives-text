# Searching for a BCS replacement
## 
### Tom Taylor 
So another college football
regular season has come to
a close, and what have we
learned? I'm not entirely
sure.
Unsatisfied with Stanford's rank
ing in the major polls, one of my
friends recently started creating his
own system, which I'll blatantly plug:
CSSportsßank.com. The idea was to
try to consider just the results from
the current season and not the institu
tional bias many of the existing
human polls are famous for. Ironical
ly, though, he ended up ranking the

Cardinal lower than the BCS did (No.
6) and Boise State far higher (No. 2).
Apart from the well-known four
or so ranking systems, searching the
Internet throws up a host of other at
tempts to create accurate and useful
ways to rate and compare football
schools. The one thing they all have in
common, though, is that none of them
seem particularly satisfactory to any
one but the two teams who get sent to
the national championship game.
There is hard science thrown into
many of these rankings, but there is a
hefty dose of magic too; how to deal

with the two intangibles of strength of
schedule and home field advantage
remains an open question.
One of the greatest mysteries to
me is how everyone that is, every
one except the fans of the two teams
given a shot at the national title and
the suits in their smoke-filled rooms
at NCAA/BCS headquarters
agrees that college football needs
playoffs, yet there is no sign of these
happening in the immediate future.
In the week after UEFA decided the
groups for next year's Euro 2012 soc
cer tournament, the comparison

seems stark. What if, instead of giving
16 teams a real shot at that title, the
existing BCS system was used?
There are no undefeated Euro
pean teams in the top 30 of the FIFA
rankings since the last major tourna
ment, the 2010 World Cup, but there
are three one-loss teams: Germany,
England and Greece. While Spain
reigning world and European cham
pions— and the Netherlands are
ranked first and second in the world,
they have four and three losses, re
