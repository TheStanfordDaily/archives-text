# LUCK IN HEISMAN HUNT
## Star QB again named Heisman Trophy finalist 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
For the second year in a row, Stanford red
shirt junior quarterback Andrew Luck was
named a finalist for the Heisman Trophy on
Monday. Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin
111, LSU defensive back Tyrann Mathieu, Al
abama running back Trent Richardson and
Wisconsin running back Montee Ball rounded
out the list of finalists.
"I'm obviously very honored, very excited,"
Luck said. "It's a great trip to New York. I re
member last year what an experience that was,
so to be able to go and relive that again, I'm
very excited. I'm excited to meet the other guys
and hang out with them, and I'm excited to rep
resent this university."
After finishing as the runner-up to Auburn's
Cam Newton for the 2010 Heisman, Luck was
widely proclaimed to be the frontrunner for the
award before the season began and has put to
gether another outstanding, if expected, sea
son.
Luck has completed 70 percent of his passes
for 3,170 yards and 35 touchdowns and is first in
the Pac-12 and fifth nationally in passing effi
ciency. He has guided the Cardinal offense to
the tune of 43.6 points per game and 480.9
yards a game of total offense, as well as an 11-1
record and a berth in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.
Head coach David Shaw said he almost
couldn't count the number of moments that led

ists for the Heisman Trophy. Luck finished second in the voting last year to Auburn's Cam Newton.
to Luck being named a finalist once
again.
"It's hard to pick a few moments,
because in every single game, he
proved that he's one of the best play
ers in the nation," he said.
And even with Luck's consistent
excellence shining through, Shaw
did point to one performance in par
ticular that stood out in his mind.
"The USC performance, it's one
of those deals where if you're look
ing for a Heisman moment," he said.
"The funny thing is, if that game hap
pens four weeks later, he's maybe
even running away with it. There's a
lot of emphasis on late-season
games, but that performance was
phenomenal."
Should Luck win the award, he
will join 1970 Heisman winner Jim
Plunkett as the second Cardinal
player to take home the award for
the nation's most outstanding play
er.
However, despite Luck's phe
nomenal season, he will have to beat
out one of the most talented Heis
man fields in recent memory.
Griffin 111, who took Baylor to a
9-3 record and the Alamo Bowl, the
first nine-win season for the Bears
since 1986, led the nation in passing
efficiency and passing rating, threw
for 3,998 yards and 36 touchdowns
and ran for 644 yards and nine
touchdowns.
Mathieu was an integral part of
LSU's second-ranked defense and
top-tier special teams during its un
defeated run to the BCS national
championship game, recording 71
tackles, forcing five fumbles, inter
cepting two passes and scoring four
touchdowns along the way.
Richardson was the battering
ram for the Alabama offense, rush
ing for 1,583 yards and 20 touch-

downs to help lead the Tide to the
national championship game for the
second time in three years.
Ball has also notched a historical
ly significant season, rushing for
1,759 yards and scoring an astound
ing 38 total touchdowns, just one shy
of Barry Sanders' NCAA record, as
the junior helped carry the Badgers
to the Rose Bowl for the second
straight year.
Luck said he hadn't seen much of
his competitors before this past
week but was struck by the quality
of the other four players in the Heis
man hunt.
"They're obviously all special
players," he said. "I'm very im
pressed with all their athletic abili
ties and with how they carry them
selves off the field, so I'm very excit
ed to meet them in person"
But despite the stiff competition,
Luck said his hopes for Saturday's
ceremony were quite obvious.
"Would I want to win the Heis
man trophy? Absolutely. I would
definitely love to win it."
The award will be presented on
Saturday, Dec. 10 in New York City.
ESPN will provide coverage of the
trophy presentation beginning at 5
p.m.PST.

However, despite Luck's phe
nomenal season, he will have to beat
out one of the most talented Heis
man fields in recent memory.
Griffin 111, who took Baylor to a
9-3 record and the Alamo Bowl, the
first nine-win season for the Bears
since 1986, led the nation in passing
efficiency and passing rating, threw
for 3,998 yards and 36 touchdowns
and ran for 644 yards and nine
touchdowns.
Mathieu was an integral part of
LSU's second-ranked defense and
top-tier special teams during its un
defeated run to the BCS national
championship game, recording 71
tackles, forcing five fumbles, inter
cepting two passes and scoring four
touchdowns along the way.
Richardson was the battering
ram for the Alabama offense, rush
ing for 1,583 yards and 20 touch-

downs to help lead the Tide to the
national championship game for the
second time in three years.
Ball has also notched a historical
ly significant season, rushing for
1,759 yards and scoring an astound
ing 38 total touchdowns, just one shy
of Barry Sanders' NCAA record, as
the junior helped carry the Badgers
to the Rose Bowl for the second
straight year.
Luck said he hadn't seen much of
his competitors before this past
week but was struck by the quality
of the other four players in the Heis
man hunt.
"They're obviously all special
players," he said. "I'm very im
pressed with all their athletic abili
ties and with how they carry them
selves off the field, so I'm very excit
ed to meet them in person"
But despite the stiff competition,
Luck said his hopes for Saturday's
ceremony were quite obvious.
"Would I want to win the Heis
man trophy? Absolutely. I would
definitely love to win it."
The award will be presented on
Saturday, Dec. 10 in New York City.
ESPN will provide coverage of the
trophy presentation beginning at 5
p.m.PST.

"\ would
definitely love
to win it."

redshirt junior
