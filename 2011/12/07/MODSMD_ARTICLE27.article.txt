# VEGAS IS NO PARTY
## 
### PALANI ESWARAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This past weekend the Car
dinal wrestling team headed to
Las Vegas for the Cliff Keen
Las Vegas Collegiate
Wrestling Invitational. The
tournament brought together
some of the best teams in the
country, and the Cardinal
wrestlers couldn't quite hang
with the best, finishing in 25th
place out of the 34 teams.
The team went into the
event with eight wrestlers, rep
resenting each weight class ex
cept 125 pounds and 157
pounds. The team had two
placed winners No. 5 junior
Ryan Mango at 133 pounds
and No. 1 redshirt senior Nick
Amuchastegui at 174 pounds.
Mango finished in seventh
place, and Amuchastegui fin
ished in sixth.
Amuchastegui started off
the tournament with three

consecutive wins and looked
very impressive. He pinned
Kyle Sweedman of North
Idaho College in the first peri
od, beat Monte Shmaulhaus of
Utah Valley 5-1 and dominat
ed Kurtis Julson of North
Dakota State 8-2. However,
the top-ranked wrestler had to
forfeit the remainder of his
matches due to injury, keeping
his record at an impressive 11-
0 on the season.
Mango's first match was a
major decision victory over
Alex Annunciation of Cal
Baptist, but he lost his next
match to Zach Zehner of
Wyoming. Mango then won
three straight matches, one of
which was a 3-2 decision over
Pac-12 opponent Garrett
Drucker of Oregon State, an
important victory for confer
ence seeding down the road.
Mango lost his next match but
then destroyed Aaron Kalil of
Navy 17-5 to make his record

13-2 this year.
Other wrestlers who won
matches were sophomore
Alan Yen at 197 pounds and
sophomore Dan Scherer at
heavyweight. Yen went 1-2 in
Las Vegas, losing to Nick Ten
penny of North Carolina and
Simas Norkus of Western
Wyoming. But Yen did beat
Chace Eskam of Arizona State
by a convincing score of 8-1. As
with Mango, a solid Pac-12 win
will mean a lot down the line.
Scherer wrestled four close
matches, winning 5-0 against
Jowan Gill of Indiana and 5-0
against Paul Snyder of Hofstra
while losing 5-0 to Levi Coop
er of Arizona State and 2-1 to
Brandon Williamson of West
Virginia.
The Card will next travel to
Reno on Dec. 18 for the Reno
Tournament of Champions.
