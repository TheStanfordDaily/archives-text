# COMEBACK KIDS ON A ROLL
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Led by a strong effort from red
shirt senior Josh Owens and a ca
reer-best game from freshman
guard Chasson Randle, the men's
basketball team rallied from a
double-digit deficit late in the sec
ond half and knocked off N.C.
State on Sunday in one of the Car
dinal's best preseason wins in

After losing a lead of its own
against No. 3 Syracuse in the
championship game of last week's
NIT Season Tip-Off, Stanford (8-
1) was in deep trouble at home
against the Wolfpack (5-3). N.C.
State's C.J.Williams had 18 points,
and his blocked shot opened a 12-
4 run in the second half that put
the Card in a 47-35 hole.
But from there, Johnny
Dawkins' team responded with
the kind of effort that has many

analysts rethinking Stanford's pre
season No. 6 ranking in the Pac-12,
spurred on by a remarkable night
at the charity stripe.
Sophomore Anthony Brown
hit a three-pointer and added a
dunk to cut into the Wolfpack's
lead, and Owens chipped in with
four free throws that gave the Car
dinal its first lead of the game with
three minutes remaining.
Owens went back to the line
and extended Stanford's lead be
fore Randle hit four free throws as
a desperate N.C. State fouled to try
and extend the game.
Stanford finished 29-34 from
the line, including a 19-21 effort in
the second half, to offset a tough
shooting night from the field. Al
though Owens went 6-10 on a col
lection of layups and short lay-ins
and sophomore Aaron Bright
chipped in 15 points on 5-8 shoot
ing, the rest of the team combined
to shoot 25 percent for the game.
But the Cardinal will have
plenty of time to work on its shoot
ing touch, as the team doesn't hit
the court again until the end of a

years.
