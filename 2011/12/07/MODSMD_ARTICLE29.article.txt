# 'Tis the bowl season
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
Cue the sound. Turn up the
lights. And let the contro
versy begin. As I'm sure
you've heard by now,
we've been rewarded
with a rematch of LSU-Alabama in
the BCS National Championship
Game, but more importantly, Stan
ford has itself one hell of a matchup
against the Oklahoma State Cowboys
in the Fiesta Bowl.
With the Cardinal making its sec
ond consecutive BCS bowl appear
ance on Jan. 2 in Glendale, Ariz., there
will be plenty of time for rumination
before the Cowboys test out their
high-powered offense against An
drew Luck and company so let's
take a look at all five of the BCS
bowls, see how they stack up at first
glance and let you know whether or
not you should tune in. Of course,
we'll start with the Cardinal and Cow
boys.
Fiesta Bowl: No. 3 Oklahoma
State versus No. 4 Stanford. This al
ready appears to be one darn fine
matchup, and judging by reactions
from sportswriters and fans on Twit
ter, it looks like a lot of people will be
tuning in to see Luck's final college
game against a very pissed-off Okla
homa State squad.The Cowboys were
locked out of the national title game
against LSU, and it's safe to say they'll
be playing with an attitude and some
thing to prove to everybody who left
'Bama sitting comfortably in the num
ber-two spot.
Of course, the story of this game is
the two outstanding offenses, which
everybody except for the rare fan
with a fetish for defense finds more
entertaining than 9-6 final scores.
Oklahoma State quarterback
Brandon Weeden and superstar wide
out Justin Blackmon bring in the na
tion's second-best passing offense
(386 yards per game) and the nation's
second-highest-scoring offense (49.3
points per game). Stanford has a more
balanced attack between the air and
the ground but still has the nation's
fifth-highest-scoring offense with 43.6
points per game.
Interestingly, Oklahoma State
pairs its offense with a defense that
has forced 42 turnovers, the most in
the nation by a wide margin six
more than North Carolina State and
nine more than San Jose State. (Yeah,
that surprised me, too.) Paired with
the Pokes' offense, that could prove to
be a deadly combination against a
Stanford team that has struggled with
turnovers lately and scored its three
lowest point totals of the season in its
last three games.
All in all, this looks like a great
matchup on paper and a matchup
you and everyone else in the country
will tune in for even though a lot of
people would have preferred to see
the Cowboys in New Orleans. Natu
rally, that brings us to our next
matchup.
BCS Title Game: No. ILSU ver
sus No. 2 Alabama. Well, they say that
the BCS title game is supposed to
present to us the two best teams in the
nation at the end of the season... but
it just doesn't feel right, does it?
This game doesn't need to be pre
viewed because we've already seen it
before and had it analyzed and over
analyzed for us by every media source
out there, and we already know what
kind of game it will be. Unfortunately,
some of the intrigue is gone from this
one, because it will be a nasty football
game between two schools that hate
each other.
Obviously, you should tune in for
this one do you really have any
thing better to do on a Monday
night? but it might be best to
watch this game with the sound off,
or put it on your DVR and watch it
at double speed. Unless, of course,
you're one of those people (like me)
who needs a cigarette after a partic
ularly good form tackle or a well

blocked punt return.
But if the SEC going for (and get
ting) its remarkable sixth-straight na
tional title isn't your thing, there are
plenty of other BCS options to turn
to.
Rose Bowl: No. 5 Oregon versus
No. 10 Wisconsin. This game could
easily be the most exciting of any BCS
bowl game this year. Again, offense is
the story in this one, and this time it's
because of the Badgers' and Ducks'
ability to run the football. Oregon
racks up 295.7 rushing yards per
game, fifth-most in the nation, and
Wisconsin isn't too far behind with
237.4 per game, 11th in the country.
The best part of this game, much
like the Stanford-Oklahoma State
game, is the story of the offenses' con
trasting styles. Oregon runs their
funky, spread-out, hurry-up offense,
while Wisconsin grinds you down
with enormous linemen that have al
lowed running back Montee Ball to
run for 32(!) touchdowns this season.
For comparison's sake, that's almost
double the number of scores
LaMichael James has run for this
year.
So I'm definitely going to be
watching this one, and so should you,
even if it's on my phone in the parking
lot at the Fiesta Bowl. And in a move
that may surprise my dedicated read
ers, I will also be watching at least a lit
tle bit of the next BCS bowl game two
nights later.
Orange Bowl: No. 23 West Vir
ginia versus No. 20 Clemson. These
two teams are certainly not up to par
with LSU and others, but I think they
actually will provide a somewhat in
teresting matchup.
After winning its first eight games,
Clemson pulled a classic Clemson
move and lost three of its next four.
But just when the Tigers looked like
they were about to get run over in the
ACC Championship Game, head
coach Dabo Swinney brought out a
classic rant that railed against Steve
Spurrier and South Carolina, and
Clemson beat Virginia Tech like a
drum to make it to the Orange Bowl.

Now they face off against a three
loss West Virginia team that boasts
the country's eighth best offense
the Mountaineers put up 533 yards of
offense against LSU earlier this year
and I must admit that I am in
trigued.
Is it possible for Clemson to play
well in two consecutive games late in
the season? How many Red Bulls
(Jagerbombs, perhaps?) will West Vir
ginia head coach Dana Holgorsen
drink during the game? Will Andrew
Luck attend the game to support his
dad Oliver, the West Virginia athletic
director? How will the fans from rural
South Carolina and West Virginia re
spond to Miami?
Maybe I need to chill out a bit if
I'm talking myself into watching the
Orange Bowl. But I know I sure as
hell won't be watching the season's
worst BCS bowl.

Sugar Bowl: No. 11 Virginia Tech
versus No. 13 Michigan. Man, this
game is a stinker. Sure, Michigan's
Denard Robinson and Virginia Tech's
David Wilson are two prolific run
ners, but unlike Oregon and Wiscon
sin, this game has zero sex appeal. I
mean, one of the best wins that Vir
ginia Tech had this year came against
Arkansas State.

So there's a lot of potential foot
ball-watching fun to be had when the
calendar flips over to 2012, and plenty
of good BCS games that should pro
vide a strong ending to the college
football season, even though it wasn't
really the ending we wanted to see.
For now, it's time to enjoy the holi
days, obsessively read previews about
the games and lament the fact that
this Stanford season has just one
game left.
It just goes so fast, doesn't it?

Jack Blanchat will go into hiberna
tion after the BCS title game, only to
emerge for the Super Bowl and Stan
ford's Sept. 1 opener against San Jose
State. Remind him just how Oski-like
that sounds at blanchat@stanford.edu

Jack Blanchat will go into hiberna
tion after the BCS title game, only to
emerge for the Super Bowl and Stan
ford's Sept. 1 opener against San Jose
State. Remind him just how Oski-like
that sounds at blanchat@stanford.edu
or follow him on Twitter at @jmblan
chat.
Cue the sound. Turn up the
lights. And let the contro
versy begin. As I'm sure
you've heard by now,
we've been rewarded
with a rematch of LSU-Alabama in
the BCS National Championship
Game, but more importantly, Stan
ford has itself one hell of a matchup
against the Oklahoma State Cowboys
in the Fiesta Bowl.
With the Cardinal making its sec
ond consecutive BCS bowl appear
ance on Jan. 2 in Glendale, Ariz., there
will be plenty of time for rumination
before the Cowboys test out their
high-powered offense against An
drew Luck and company so let's
take a look at all five of the BCS
bowls, see how they stack up at first
glance and let you know whether or
not you should tune in. Of course,
we'll start with the Cardinal and Cow
boys.
Fiesta Bowl: No. 3 Oklahoma
State versus No. 4 Stanford. This al
ready appears to be one darn fine
matchup, and judging by reactions
from sportswriters and fans on Twit
ter, it looks like a lot of people will be
tuning in to see Luck's final college
game against a very pissed-off Okla
homa State squad.The Cowboys were
locked out of the national title game
against LSU, and it's safe to say they'll
be playing with an attitude and some
thing to prove to everybody who left
'Bama sitting comfortably in the num
ber-two spot.
Of course, the story of this game is
the two outstanding offenses, which
everybody except for the rare fan
with a fetish for defense finds more
entertaining than 9-6 final scores.
Oklahoma State quarterback
Brandon Weeden and superstar wide
out Justin Blackmon bring in the na
tion's second-best passing offense
(386 yards per game) and the nation's
second-highest-scoring offense (49.3
points per game). Stanford has a more
balanced attack between the air and
the ground but still has the nation's
fifth-highest-scoring offense with 43.6
points per game.
Interestingly, Oklahoma State
pairs its offense with a defense that
has forced 42 turnovers, the most in
the nation by a wide margin six
more than North Carolina State and
nine more than San Jose State. (Yeah,
that surprised me, too.) Paired with
the Pokes' offense, that could prove to
be a deadly combination against a
Stanford team that has struggled with
turnovers lately and scored its three
lowest point totals of the season in its
last three games.
All in all, this looks like a great
matchup on paper and a matchup
you and everyone else in the country
will tune in for even though a lot of
people would have preferred to see
the Cowboys in New Orleans. Natu
rally, that brings us to our next
matchup.
BCS Title Game: No. ILSU ver
sus No. 2 Alabama. Well, they say that
the BCS title game is supposed to
present to us the two best teams in the
nation at the end of the season... but
it just doesn't feel right, does it?
This game doesn't need to be pre
viewed because we've already seen it
before and had it analyzed and over
analyzed for us by every media source
out there, and we already know what
kind of game it will be. Unfortunately,
some of the intrigue is gone from this
one, because it will be a nasty football
game between two schools that hate
each other.
Obviously, you should tune in for
this one do you really have any
thing better to do on a Monday
night? but it might be best to
watch this game with the sound off,
or put it on your DVR and watch it
at double speed. Unless, of course,
you're one of those people (like me)
who needs a cigarette after a partic
ularly good form tackle or a well

blocked punt return.
But if the SEC going for (and get
ting) its remarkable sixth-straight na
tional title isn't your thing, there are
plenty of other BCS options to turn
to.
Rose Bowl: No. 5 Oregon versus
No. 10 Wisconsin. This game could
easily be the most exciting of any BCS
bowl game this year. Again, offense is
the story in this one, and this time it's
because of the Badgers' and Ducks'
ability to run the football. Oregon
racks up 295.7 rushing yards per
game, fifth-most in the nation, and
Wisconsin isn't too far behind with
237.4 per game, 11th in the country.
The best part of this game, much
like the Stanford-Oklahoma State
game, is the story of the offenses' con
trasting styles. Oregon runs their
funky, spread-out, hurry-up offense,
while Wisconsin grinds you down
with enormous linemen that have al
lowed running back Montee Ball to
run for 32(!) touchdowns this season.
For comparison's sake, that's almost
double the number of scores
LaMichael James has run for this
year.
So I'm definitely going to be
watching this one, and so should you,
even if it's on my phone in the parking
lot at the Fiesta Bowl. And in a move
that may surprise my dedicated read
ers, I will also be watching at least a lit
tle bit of the next BCS bowl game two
nights later.
Orange Bowl: No. 23 West Vir
ginia versus No. 20 Clemson. These
two teams are certainly not up to par
with LSU and others, but I think they
actually will provide a somewhat in
teresting matchup.
After winning its first eight games,
Clemson pulled a classic Clemson
move and lost three of its next four.
But just when the Tigers looked like
they were about to get run over in the
ACC Championship Game, head
coach Dabo Swinney brought out a
classic rant that railed against Steve
Spurrier and South Carolina, and
Clemson beat Virginia Tech like a
drum to make it to the Orange Bowl.

Now they face off against a three
loss West Virginia team that boasts
the country's eighth best offense
the Mountaineers put up 533 yards of
offense against LSU earlier this year
and I must admit that I am in
trigued.
Is it possible for Clemson to play
well in two consecutive games late in
the season? How many Red Bulls
(Jagerbombs, perhaps?) will West Vir
ginia head coach Dana Holgorsen
drink during the game? Will Andrew
Luck attend the game to support his
dad Oliver, the West Virginia athletic
director? How will the fans from rural
South Carolina and West Virginia re
spond to Miami?
Maybe I need to chill out a bit if
I'm talking myself into watching the
Orange Bowl. But I know I sure as
hell won't be watching the season's
worst BCS bowl.

Sugar Bowl: No. 11 Virginia Tech
versus No. 13 Michigan. Man, this
game is a stinker. Sure, Michigan's
Denard Robinson and Virginia Tech's
David Wilson are two prolific run
ners, but unlike Oregon and Wiscon
sin, this game has zero sex appeal. I
mean, one of the best wins that Vir
ginia Tech had this year came against
Arkansas State.

So there's a lot of potential foot
ball-watching fun to be had when the
calendar flips over to 2012, and plenty
of good BCS games that should pro
vide a strong ending to the college
football season, even though it wasn't
really the ending we wanted to see.
For now, it's time to enjoy the holi
days, obsessively read previews about
the games and lament the fact that
this Stanford season has just one
game left.
It just goes so fast, doesn't it?

Jack Blanchat will go into hiberna
