Cue the sound. Turn up the
lights. And let the contro
versy begin. As I'm sure
you've heard by now,
we've been rewarded
with a rematch of LSU-Alabama in
the BCS National Championship
Game, but more importantly, Stan
ford has itself one hell of a matchup
against the Oklahoma State Cowboys
in the Fiesta Bowl.
With the Cardinal making its sec
ond consecutive BCS bowl appear
ance on Jan. 2 in Glendale, Ariz., there
will be plenty of time for rumination
before the Cowboys test out their
high-powered offense against An
drew Luck and company so let's
take a look at all five of the BCS
bowls, see how they stack up at first
glance and let you know whether or
not you should tune in. Of course,
we'll start with the Cardinal and Cow
boys.
Fiesta Bowl: No. 3 Oklahoma
State versus No. 4 Stanford. This al

matchup, and judging by reactions
from sportswriters and fans on Twit
ter, it looks like a lot of people will be
tuning in to see Luck's final college
game against a very pissed-off Okla
homa State squad.The Cowboys were
locked out of the national title game
against LSU, and it's safe to say they'll
be playing with an attitude and some
thing to prove to everybody who left
'Bama sitting comfortably in the num
ber-two spot.
Of course, the story of this game is
the two outstanding offenses, which
everybody except for the rare fan
with a fetish for defense finds more
entertaining than 9-6 final scores.
Oklahoma State quarterback
Brandon Weeden and superstar wide
out Justin Blackmon bring in the na
tion's second-best passing offense
(386 yards per game) and the nation's
second-highest-scoring offense (49.3
points per game). Stanford has a more
balanced attack between the air and
the ground but still has the nation's
