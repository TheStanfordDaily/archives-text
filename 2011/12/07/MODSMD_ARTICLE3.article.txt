## Senate discusses $400K fund Holds closed meeting on sexual assault policy 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Senate meeting start
ed off with a closed meeting be
tween the Undergraduate Senate
and the internal re view panel for ju
dicial affairs.
Senate Chair Rafael Vazquez 'l2
asked that reporters and people not
associated with the ASSU leave the
meeting, at the request of members
of the panel. Vazquez told The Daily
that the topic of the closed meeting
was the preponderance of evidence
standard for sexual assault on cam
pus.
This action may have violated
the ASSU Joint Bylaws, which state
that there are only three reasons a
legislative meeting may be closed:
to "discuss the appointment, the
employment, the performance, or
the dismissal of an Association
member or employee who is neither
the President, the Vice President,
nor a member of an Association leg
islative body," to "discuss pending
litigation" or to "discuss propri
etary business practices." No men
tion of personal requests from
panel members is included in the
ASSU constitution.
The senate re-opened the meet
ing after an hour and received an
update from Neveen Mahmoud
'll, CEO of Stanford Student En
terprises (SSE), the financial arm of
the ASSU. Mahmoud praised the
successful opening of Ground-Up,
the new coffee shop set up by the
SSE.
Mahmoud then informed the
senate about the $400,000 buffer
fund that was discussed last week,
after Stephen Trusheim 'l3 request
ed money be allocated from this
fund to a concert he was helping to
plan,
Mahmoud informed the senate
that every year Stanford students
are charged 10 percent higher than
what is deemed necessary to fulfill
special fees requirements. This 10
percent is used to account for stu
dents who choose to not pay their
special fees and also to cover mis

takes. Last year two student groups
were incorrectly left off the special
fees ballot, and the ASSU covered
their expenses from this buffer
fund.
Money from this fund was again
requested, this time by organizers
of BlackFest. Looking to book an
artist capable of pulling in large
crowds, BlackFest organizers have
been in contact with Grammy
nominated J. Cole.
BlackFest is requesting $40,000
due to an increase in interest and
cost. Renting Frost Amphitheater
would cost the group $62,000, and
they say they simply don't have
enough money to pursue a big
name artist.
This money could come in the
form of a grant or a loan, to be paid
back by revenue generated from
ticket sales. Current internal pro
jections put the cost of a ticket to
BlackFest at $3O, thus organizers
are requesting funding for a big
name artist to ensure that enough
tickets are sold.
Senators expressed a desire to
talk further with Mahmoud about
the origin and actual amounts of
this buffer fund before making any
funding decisions. However, the
bills are time-sensitive, as both
groups wish to start negotiations
with artists before January.

Pending senators' availability,
Vazquez hopes to schedule an
emergency meeting of the Senate
over finals week to vote on these
bills.
Senators also asked ASSU Ex
ecutive Michael Cruz 'l2 questions
about the resignation of Emma
Ogiemwanye 'l2. Some senators
were confused as to why her going
abroad wasn't discussed during the
interview process, and Cruz re
sponded that there were no plans
for her to go abroad at that time.
Senator Brianna Pang 'l3 asked
why Ogiemwanye decided to go
abroad during fall quarter of this
year, after she'd already accepted
the job as Chief of Staff for the
ASSU Executive. Cruz responded
that Pang would have to ask
Ogiemwanye.
Vazquez also briefly addressed
the senate, encouraging senators to
stay involved over winter break.
"Any senator who is going to be
online or able to meet during winter
break, we'll be hashing out more
details for winter quarter, re-hash
our goals and reorient ourselves
into being more effective."
No legislative bills were passed
during this week's meeting.
