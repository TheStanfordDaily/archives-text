## Stanford track and field indoor season debuts in Boise 
### – Miles Bennett-Smith 
Stanford kicked off the indoor
track and field season over the
weekend, sending a relatively small
contingent to the Jackson Open and
Multi Event but finishing with
strong performances on both the
men's and the women's sides.
While the overall level of com
petition at the Boise State-hosted
meet was not quite what Stanford
will have to deal with in the Pac-12,
the Cardinal was particularly domi
nant in field events —junior
Karynn Dunn took the women's
long jump by over a foot, and red
shirt junior Jordan Merback added
to the Card's early haul with a victo
ry of her own in the triple jump.
Senior Ail-American Katerina
Stefanidi also got her season off to a
good start with a win in the pole
vault, clearing 13 feet, 111/4 inches.
The men's team saw similar re
sults, as freshman Dartis Willis
one of the nation's top high school
high jumpers last year at Detroit
Country Day won his signature
event in his collegiate debut.
A trio of long-jumpers nearly led
a Stanford sweep in the men's event,
as sophomore James Jones, redshirt
sophomore Kevin Cardey and fresh
man Darian Brooks finished behind
Boise State's Kurt Felix in second,
third and fourth places.
Although the team was missing
most of its distance runners and
many of its regular performers,
Stanford still managed to hold its
own on the track as well. Redshirt
senior sprinter Shataya Hendricks
finished second in the 200 meters
and fourth in the 60 meters the
100-meter dash is not traditionally
run during the indoor season.
In addition, freshmen Amber
Farrell and Madeline Treasure ac
quitted themselves well in their de
buts for the Cardinal, with Farrell
coming in second in the 60-meter

hurdles and Treasure just missing a
title in the women's heptathlon to
finish second with 3,322 points.
Brooks continued his solid
showing on the track as well, run
ning 6.92 to finish second in the 60-
meter dash.
Stanford won't compete again this
calendar year but will be back in ac
tion on Jan. 14, heading to the Univer
sity of Washington Indoor Preview,
regularly a top-notch competition.
