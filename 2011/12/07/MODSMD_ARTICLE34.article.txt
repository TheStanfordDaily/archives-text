## PROCRASTINATION SITES 
### 
We feel you, man. Your brain's dead. Exams are about to hijack
your soul. In times like these, sometimes all you need are
some Internet memes to procrastinate away the pain. Tune in
and drop out . . . then wake up at eight to show that test who's
boss. Just be careful like we are, and don't let these sites get
the best of your attention spa . . . attention spa . . . attention . .
. atten ... oh my gosh, that goat's singing like Usher.
This is Why I'm Broke
Remember when you played The Sims and wondered why cool
objects like a Money Tree and Cool Shades didn't exist in real
life? Well, what if we told you that glow-in-the-dark toilet paper
and water-fueled jet packs were real? What's that? You'd spend
all your money and become broke? Yeah, us too. It's a good
thing we have none.
Pinterest
We know this started as a website for stay-at-home mamas to
share their inner Martha Stewart, but it's come a long way from
turkey-shaped cupcakes. Kind of. If you like surfing the net for
cool photography, food porn or things that are just pretty (we
see you ladies), set aside an hour... uh, four.
The Cool Hunter
Bit of a hipster, eh? If edgy art, architecture and music strike your
fancy, look no further. Hey, whatever points you lose on your
exam, you make up in points for sophistication!
I Waste So Much Time
Be careful with this. It doesn't even try to disguise the fact that it
will mercilessly suck away your time. Sure, you will enjoy a few
laughs over a baby turtle shouting, "Release the Kraken!" but
next thing you know, it's 4 a.m., and you don't know what you're
doing with your life. Proceed with caution. Prepare to lose a
minimum of 10,000 brain cells.
Longform
We're feeling a bit guilty about encouraging the demise of your
attention spans, and it's true, it's become harder to find quality
pieces of long journalism. Longform amasses the best ones from
a variety of publications. See, we were really just messing with
you about all that meme stuff. We're actually a lot more

sophisticated and ... cat doing
handstand. Brain melting.
