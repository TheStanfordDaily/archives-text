### â€“ halle EDWARDS contact halle: halle@stanford. edu 
In a year filled with wizards, Kardashians and real
fairytale weddings, 2011 was a great year for pop
culture. Here are our favorite moments.
Adele performs "Someone Like You" at the MTV
VMAs
During an awards show known for its elaborate
performances, crazy costumes and unplanned drama
(ahem, Kanye West) Adele stood out this year by
showing up in a simple black dress and taking the
stage with only a pianist to back her up. Letting her
soulful voice stand out, Adele managed to upstage the
much more elaborate numbers with "Someone Like
You."
Rim Kardashian's 72-day marriage
The Kardashians, pop culture's favorite punch
line, recently made even more of a mockery of them
selves. After getting married in true Kardashian form
(the entire ceremony was broadcast in a four-hour spe
cial), Kim Kardashian announced her divorce just

weeks later.
Comedians and
Internet pundits
everywhere
rejoiced, and we
all got something
to joke about.
The Royal
Wedding
In other wed-

ding news, after eight years of dating, Prince William
and Kate Middleton finally tied the knot. In a lavish
ceremony broadcast all over the world, Kate appeared
in a much-talked-about Alexander McQueen dress
and, despite her commoner status, married a prince.
The best news? The two remain happily married.
"Harry Potter" ends its decade-long run
After 10 years of witches, wizards, sociopathic
murderers and teen drama, the Harry Potter movie
adaptation finally ended this summer with the release
of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2." It
was a fitting finale to the saga, with Harry and
Voldemort finally facing off.
"Bridesmaids" becomes the top-grossing Judd Apatow
film

Pre-"Bridesmaids," many thought that women
were not cut out for Judd Apatow's brand of raw
adult humor. However, Kristin Wiig, Melissa
McCarthy and the other ladies of "Bridesmaids"
proved any naysayers wrong with their unbridled,
hilarious performances. And audiences agreed
"Bridesmaids" made more money at the box office
than any other Judd Apatow film.
