## Bringing 'TINKER TAILOR' to the big screen 
### – misa SHIKUMA contact misa: mshikuma@stanford. edu 
Sweden's Tomas Alfredson makes his English
language directorial debut with "Tinker Tailor
Soldier Spy," an adaptation of John le Carre s
popular British spy-novel featuring an all-star cast
including Gaiy Oldman, Colin Firth, Mark Strong
and Tom Hardy. Fresh off of wrapping production
on "The Dark Knight Rises," Christopher Nolan's
conclusion to his celebrated Batman trilogy, Gary
Oldman recently joined Alfredson in San Francisco
to talk about careers, homoeroticism and why con
temporary audiences will still enjoy their Cold War
set story.
For Alfredson, the journey all began in 2008
with the unprecedented international success of his
vampire flick "Fet the Right One In." The scripts
came pouring in, and yet he doubted whether he
could execute any of them daunted, in part, by
directing in a language other than his native
Swedish.
"I wasn't sure if it was the right thing for me to
do," Alfredson confessed, "so I just rejected every
thing that came up until someone said that
Working Title [Films, a British production compa
ny] had retrieved the rights to this book." The direc
tor had read the book and watched the mini-series
years ago, so when he expressed interest in the proj
ect, everything fell into place—well, almost.
Casting the role of protagonist George Smiley
proved to be the biggest hurdle.
"In the book, he's described as someone that
you would immediately forget," Alfredson elaborat
ed, "so the problem was to find an actor not unin
teresting, but to play uninteresting."
After six months of deliberation, his team
began to get a sense of "If we can't find this man,
let's not do this film." But fortunately, when casting
director Jina Jay came up with veteran actor Gary
Oldman, it was an instant fit, after which they sim
ply cast the rest around him.
Oldman remembered Alffedson's worries on
the set as he complained that "50 to 60 percent of
his [linguistic] tools were taken awayJ'
However, "when you're working on a film set
with actors for 12 hours a day and that is your only
way of communication... you get into a shorthand
really quickly" the actor continued, emphasizing
that the language of film is universal.
Finguistic barriers aside, Alfredson enjoyed
quite a bit of freedom in crafting his version of the
story.

tor recounted.
"Since he himself was a spy in the '6os, he was
a great help to have, because he knows and remem
bers everything about all the details, documents,
how stuff looked and so on and so forth," Alfredson
said.
The author also proved a valuable resource to
Oldman, who added that, "A lot of the history of
George was from [le Carre s] own experience."
When asked about his extraordinary,
chameleon-like performances, Oldman, in contrast
with known method-actors who notoriously stay in
character day-in and day-out, merely said that,
"Once you've got a character and you've done the
work, then you can switch it on and off'
With that said, the lead-up to a shoot can be
more intense.
"I always scare the dogs and the kids when I'm
doing a role that's slightly more [energetic] than
George," Oldman joked.
"They have play-dates that come over and say
[in hushed voice] 'ls your dad alright?' 'Oh yeah, it's
just rehearsal,'" he added.
In addressing the film's appeal to today's
moviegoers, both reached first for the story's broad
er themes.
"I'm not particularly interested in the Cold
War or espionage," Alfredson said bluntly. "I mean,
it's interesting, but for me, this film is not about
those things."
"It's about love, love lost, friendship, betrayal,"
Oldman agreed, adding that, "the politics are almost
like a backdrop to it."
Yet at the same time, the setting is what enables
it to be so profoundly character-driven in away that
many movies these days simply are not.
"It took a different kind of soldier," Oldman
continued. "These men that were in MI-5, MI-6, are
more like the Bill Haydons [Colin Firth's character]
—there was a lot of closet homosexuality going on
because it was absolutely not accepted." (Though
homosexuality was punishable by law until 1967,


"John le Carre said in the beginning of the
process, 'If you need me, I will answer the phone,
but I won't call you and I won't interfere,"' the director recounted.
the stigma remained long afterward).
"Within the secret service it was
forbidden because you would expose
yourself to blackmailing," Alfredson
confirmed, "and yet the people that
were recruited very often were [gay],
and to sacrifice that, as we see in the
film it's so cruel and heartbreaking
[in] a very strong motive."
Also crucial to the film's '7os vibe
is the fear so atmospheric it's practically
tangible.
"I remember the '7os," Oldman
reminisced. "I mean... I was more
interested in girls and David Bowie at
that time, but I do remember that sort
of threat." Referencing current global
events, he hinted that perhaps every
generation, to a certain extent, experi
ences some form of Zeitgeist that will
enable them to connect with the story.
Thus, even though the Cold War itself
is "a thing very much in the mists of
time," the apprehensive wait-and-see of
what moves the world's political players
will make it quite similar to today.
Venturing back into less controver
sial territory, I wonder whether there
might be any memorable moments
from the set to share. After thinking a
moment, Alfredson recalls shooting a
small scene early on as Oldman's char
acter adjusts to retired life.
"It's a really, really boring situation
which everyone can relate to," the direc

tor said. "I said 'cut,' and [Oldman]
came to me and said, 'Can I watch
that?' We played it back, and he was
looking at the monitor and said, 'I used
to play [Sex Pistols bassist] Sid Vicious.'
He saw this gray man with an apron
frying an egg!"
But perhaps this side of the char
acter is closer to the real Gary Oldman
than he would care to admit. His sons,
of whom he spoke quite lovingly,
popped up several times in the course
of our conversation.
"When I'm not working," the
actor said, "I'm a dad —it's book
reports and science projects."
And is there anything on the table
for Alfredson?
"It's a very emotional thing," he
mused, "to choose a project. I think it's
[that] you read something and if your
body reacts on it, it's probably a good
project. Like if you laugh or cry or
something happens in your heart."
When pressed, Alfredson added, "I
deliberately haven't read anything since
we opened with this film in London. I
need to rest a little and see what happens."
Well, sir, we eagerly await your
next move.

[in hushed voice] 'ls your dad alright?' 'Oh yeah, it's
just rehearsal,'" he added.
In addressing the film's appeal to today's
moviegoers, both reached first for the story's broad
er themes.
"I'm not particularly interested in the Cold
War or espionage," Alfredson said bluntly. "I mean,
it's interesting, but for me, this film is not about
those things."
"It's about love, love lost, friendship, betrayal,"
Oldman agreed, adding that, "the politics are almost
like a backdrop to it."
Yet at the same time, the setting is what enables
it to be so profoundly character-driven in away that
many movies these days simply are not.
"It took a different kind of soldier," Oldman
continued. "These men that were in MI-5, MI-6, are
more like the Bill Haydons [Colin Firth's character]
—there was a lot of closet homosexuality going on
because it was absolutely not accepted." (Though
homosexuality was punishable by law until 1967,


"John le Carre said in the beginning of the
process, 'If you need me, I will answer the phone,
but I won't call you and I won't interfere,"' the director recounted.
the stigma remained long afterward).
"Within the secret service it was
forbidden because you would expose
yourself to blackmailing," Alfredson
confirmed, "and yet the people that
were recruited very often were [gay],
and to sacrifice that, as we see in the
film it's so cruel and heartbreaking
[in] a very strong motive."
Also crucial to the film's '7os vibe
is the fear so atmospheric it's practically
tangible.
"I remember the '7os," Oldman
reminisced. "I mean... I was more
interested in girls and David Bowie at
that time, but I do remember that sort
of threat." Referencing current global
events, he hinted that perhaps every
generation, to a certain extent, experi
ences some form of Zeitgeist that will
enable them to connect with the story.
Thus, even though the Cold War itself
is "a thing very much in the mists of
time," the apprehensive wait-and-see of
what moves the world's political players
will make it quite similar to today.
Venturing back into less controver
sial territory, I wonder whether there
might be any memorable moments
from the set to share. After thinking a
moment, Alfredson recalls shooting a
small scene early on as Oldman's char
acter adjusts to retired life.
"It's a really, really boring situation
which everyone can relate to," the direc

tor said. "I said 'cut,' and [Oldman]
came to me and said, 'Can I watch
that?' We played it back, and he was
looking at the monitor and said, 'I used
to play [Sex Pistols bassist] Sid Vicious.'
He saw this gray man with an apron
frying an egg!"
But perhaps this side of the char
acter is closer to the real Gary Oldman
than he would care to admit. His sons,
of whom he spoke quite lovingly,
popped up several times in the course
of our conversation.
"When I'm not working," the
actor said, "I'm a dad —it's book
reports and science projects."
And is there anything on the table
for Alfredson?
"It's a very emotional thing," he
mused, "to choose a project. I think it's
[that] you read something and if your
body reacts on it, it's probably a good
project. Like if you laugh or cry or
something happens in your heart."
When pressed, Alfredson added, "I
deliberately haven't read anything since
we opened with this film in London. I
need to rest a little and see what happens."
Well, sir, we eagerly await your
next move.
Sweden's Tomas Alfredson makes his English
language directorial debut with "Tinker Tailor
Soldier Spy," an adaptation of John le Carre s
popular British spy-novel featuring an all-star cast
including Gaiy Oldman, Colin Firth, Mark Strong
and Tom Hardy. Fresh off of wrapping production
on "The Dark Knight Rises," Christopher Nolan's
conclusion to his celebrated Batman trilogy, Gary
Oldman recently joined Alfredson in San Francisco
to talk about careers, homoeroticism and why con
temporary audiences will still enjoy their Cold War
set story.
For Alfredson, the journey all began in 2008
with the unprecedented international success of his
vampire flick "Fet the Right One In." The scripts
came pouring in, and yet he doubted whether he
could execute any of them daunted, in part, by
directing in a language other than his native
Swedish.
"I wasn't sure if it was the right thing for me to
do," Alfredson confessed, "so I just rejected every
thing that came up until someone said that
Working Title [Films, a British production compa
ny] had retrieved the rights to this book." The direc
tor had read the book and watched the mini-series
years ago, so when he expressed interest in the proj
ect, everything fell into place—well, almost.
Casting the role of protagonist George Smiley
proved to be the biggest hurdle.
"In the book, he's described as someone that
you would immediately forget," Alfredson elaborat
ed, "so the problem was to find an actor not unin
teresting, but to play uninteresting."
After six months of deliberation, his team
began to get a sense of "If we can't find this man,
let's not do this film." But fortunately, when casting
director Jina Jay came up with veteran actor Gary
Oldman, it was an instant fit, after which they sim
ply cast the rest around him.
Oldman remembered Alffedson's worries on
the set as he complained that "50 to 60 percent of
his [linguistic] tools were taken awayJ'
However, "when you're working on a film set
with actors for 12 hours a day and that is your only
way of communication... you get into a shorthand
really quickly" the actor continued, emphasizing
that the language of film is universal.
Finguistic barriers aside, Alfredson enjoyed
quite a bit of freedom in crafting his version of the
story.

tor recounted.
"Since he himself was a spy in the '6os, he was
a great help to have, because he knows and remem
bers everything about all the details, documents,
how stuff looked and so on and so forth," Alfredson
said.
The author also proved a valuable resource to
Oldman, who added that, "A lot of the history of
George was from [le Carre s] own experience."
When asked about his extraordinary,
chameleon-like performances, Oldman, in contrast
with known method-actors who notoriously stay in
character day-in and day-out, merely said that,
"Once you've got a character and you've done the
work, then you can switch it on and off'
With that said, the lead-up to a shoot can be
more intense.
"I always scare the dogs and the kids when I'm
doing a role that's slightly more [energetic] than
George," Oldman joked.
"They have play-dates that come over and say
[in hushed voice] 'ls your dad alright?' 'Oh yeah, it's
just rehearsal,'" he added.
