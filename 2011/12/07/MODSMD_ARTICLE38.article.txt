Winter break probably seems ages
away right now but whether you
believe it or not, there will eventu
ally come a time when you're relaxed enough
to kick back, sip some hot chocolate and
watch some cheery holiday films on loop.
You might even have time to hit up the movie
theater (what???). Luckily, Intermission has
done the homework to keep you in the know
about what flicks will soon be playing at a
theater near you.
"New Year's Eve" (Dec. 9)
From the same writer and director of
"Valentine's Day," this sort-of-sequel docu
ments the transition from 2011 to 2012 for
several hopeful romantics and wizened cur
mudgeons. The "New Year's Eve" cast is as
equally star-studded as the lovers' flick and
has more daring, diverse additions like Robert
De Niro, Seth Meyers ("Saturday Night Live")
and Sofia Vergara ("Modern Family"). It plays
its ensemble parts in the intertwining fashion
of "Valentine's Day" and "Love Actually", with
a healthy dose of similar feel-good holiday
spirit. Set to Pink's "Raise Your Glass," the
trailer has a party attitude with a nod to the
magic of New Year's Eve.

"Girl With a Dragon Tattoo" (Dec. 21)
Unless you've been living under a rock
for the last four years, you know about Stieg
Larsson's novel "Girl With a Dragon Tattoo,"
and unless you've actually read the bestseller,
you probably have no idea what it's about.
The first teaser trailer of the (second) cine
matic adaptation hailing from David Fincher
("Se7en," "Fight Club," "The Social Network")
reveals little information in its minute-and-a-

half montage of visuals set to Trent
Reznor and Karen O's screechy
rendition of "Immigrant Song."

The trailer clues us
in on the dual peri
ods of the film,
Daniel Craig,
Christopher
Plummer, a Lady
Gaga lookalike and
not much else.
Shouting its "Feel
Bad Movie" status in

text, the trailer promises "Dragon Tattoo" will
be yet another cool movie in Fincher's reper
toire.
"I Melt With You" (Dec. 9)
Despite the bizarrely sentimental title
(taken from the popular Modern English
song) and the seemingly trite premise, this
buddy-reunion film's trailer promises a new
spin on the white adult male relationships
popularized by the likes of "The Hangover,"
"Horrible Bosses" and "Old School." At first
the trailer feels like it gives the game away:
four college friends (Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe,
Thomas Jane and Christian McKay) gather
every year for a retreat of ribaldry, mischief
and self-medication. The montage of good
times quickly turns to shots of desperation
and busied isolation as the words "A BURIED
SECRET" flashes over plotted sand, indicating
a mystery movie. But we've seen this film

before, the one where several friends on holi
day revisit a scarred past until the trailer
smolders into Camera's maudlin track

"Defeatist" in a hastened montage suggesting
that "I Melt" is less about the wacky situations
of white men than a character study of four
men and the psychological warfare of the
everyday.
"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"
(Dec. 25)
The trailer for "Extremely Loud and
Incredibly Close" reads like a mini-version of
the feature-length version: establishing admira
tion for the son and father s (Tom Hanks) rela
tionship, ripping it with halting visuals of the
falling Twin Towers and a melodramatic mon-
