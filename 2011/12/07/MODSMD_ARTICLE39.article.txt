Y | holidays are almost upon us; that
means Christmas shopping. If finals are
-A- draining your brainpower and Amazon
recommendations are letting you down, fear
not Book Critiqua has something for every
one on your list;
The Fashionista
"Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty,"

Metropolitan Museum
of Art
For your chic friend
who couldn't make it to
New York, this is the
next best thing. The
book, which illuminates
the entirety of
McQueen's career,
includes essays and

commentary by
Andrew Bolton, curator of the designer's
posthumous exhibition at the Met, Sarah
Burton, McQueen's creative director and sever

al fashion editors. It also features, of course,
pages upon pages of stunning photography.

The Techie
"Steve Jobs," by Walter
Isaacson
Of the famous people
who died this year, the
most influential is
undoubtedly Steve Jobs.
This book is a compre
hensive, uncut biography
of the man behind Apple.
In writing it, Isaacson

conducted over 40 interviews with Jobs in the
last years of his life, and over 100 with his kin,
colleagues and competitors. For the CS major
who dreams of making it big in the Valley, this
is the story of one man who did.
The Hipster
"Lucking Out," by James Wolcott
For the friend who exudes "vintage" from every
pore, who wishes he'd been alive when punk

rock was making its downtown debut and liter
ary legends like Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal
roamed the earth, this memoir is a rich portrait
of 1970s New York in all its degenerate glory.
Wolcott's eyewitness perspective, by turns
affectionate and critical, captures the spirit of
the city and the era almost like stepping into
a time machine.

The History Buff
"Inferno," by Max Hastings
For the friend who knows or thinks she
knows everything about World War 11,
"Inferno" offers a unique glimpse of the
human lives behind the numbers. At once a
sweeping, all-encompassing history of the war
and an intimate tale of the people involved,
this meticulously researched book delves into
the lives of soldiers, housewives and statesmen
around the world. Hastings, a journalist and
prolific historian, pays special attention to the
lesser-known theaters of conflict, such as
Finland and Bangladesh.

The Movie Buff

"The Age of Movies," by Pauline Kael, ed.
Sanford Schwartz
Kael was, for over 20 years, a much-beloved
film critic at The New Yorker known for her
biting wit and laser-like focus, as well as her
beautiful prose. It is said, in certain circles, that
her writing shaped an entire generation's taste
in film. "The Age of Movies" is a collection of
Kael's reviews of her era's most influential
films, curated by Sanford Schwartz of The New
York Review of Books.
The Environmentalist
"Visions of Earth," National Geographic
If you're searching for a beautiful coffee-table
book for a nature-lover, look no further. This
spellbinding volume features hundreds of
pages of lush, high-quality images, many of
them from the unpublished portfolios of
world-famous photographers. Ranging from


landscapes to wildlife to little-known
cultures around the globe, this book
is a veritable feast for the eyes.
The Jock
"The Art of Fielding," by Chad
Harbach
Harbach's debut novel is both a clas
sic baseball story — a small-town
athlete making it in the big leagues
and an introspective, literary
work. Preternaturally talented short
stop Henry Skrimshander and sever
al major players in his life confront
the skeletons in their respective clos

ets as the biggest game of the season
draws steadily closer. Harbach defdy
handles ambition, commitment,
doubt and desire, and he spins a
lovely yarn.
The Bibliophile
"The Letters of Ernest Hemingway,
Vol. 1," ed. Sandra Spanier and Robert
W. Trogdon
For your most well-read friend, not
just any book will do. There's a good
chance he already owns all of the
infallible classics you were thinking
of getting him. This newly-published

(Sept. 2011) volume, however,
should right up his alley, revealing a
softer side to the famous, testos
terone-oozing author that the world
has never before seen. Hemingway's
surprisingly affectionate letters to his
family and friends grants readers a
glimpse of his creative process, his
take on the literati of his day and the
people and events that shaped his
work.
