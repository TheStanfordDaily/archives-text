# ResEd tweaks Row financial policies
## 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
The Office of Residential Education (ResEd)
has implemented changes to the financial policies
for student-managed Row houses over the recent
months, following the identification of several
"compliance issues" during a general review
process, according to administrators.
These changes, some of which have endured
while others have not, included more University
oversight of student house dues and vendor pay
ment.
In an email to The Daily, Assistant Dean of
ResEd Nate Boswell referenced the Sept. 2010 hir
ing of Director of Operations Aaron Buzay as the
result of a larger review process conducted by Deb
orah Golder, dean of Res Ed.
"The hiring of this position increased oversight
of all operational and financial activities in ResEd

and supplemented existing partnerships with Busi
ness Affairs," Boswell said. "During the first com
prehensive review conducted by Director Buzay,
the department identified several compliance is
sues that required attention and worked together
with the Auditing Office and other Business Affairs
partners to make corrections."
This past spring, ResEd prohibited Row houses
from using social dues to purchase alcohol, citing a
school policy that restricts University funds from
being used to buy alcohol for those under the age
of 21. Several house financial managers (FMs)
noted that under the previous system, Stanford
could be held legally responsible in the case of an
alcohol-related accident, since the purchases were
made through University-owned bank accounts.
At the outset of this autumn quarter, the Uni
versity introduced a new round of changes to Row
financial policies.
ResEd standardized Row house social dues at

$75 and began collecting this fee through students'
University bills instead of through student FMs.
ResEd also experimented with the way Row house
food vendors are paid, shifting the responsibility
from FMs to the Row Central Office for the first
five weeks of the quarter.
A new staff member, Financial Associate Jo
Arredondo, is charged with looking over weekly
house budget reports and serves as a point person
for FMs.
These changes raised several questions for FMs
about the shifting nature of their role and what au
tonomy they can expect to have in the future.
"We are committed to preserving the core
tenets of the student management program which
is geared towards enabling student leaders to build
vibrant, intimate residential communities," wrote
Boswell and Buzay in a joint email to The Daily.

financial managers are no longer officially in charge of collecting student social dues, though several said they maintain "slush" funds for alcohol.
"However, we are also committed to
and responsible for upholding the
standards of the University."

Row life
The Row is a collection of 36 hous
es along Mayfield Avenue and span
ning from the Cowell Cluster to the
Lake Houses. It includes 29 self-ops,
where students manage the house's
meal services and hire a cook, and
seven co-ops, which are completely
student-run and do not receive Uni
versity custodial services.

All of these houses are Universi
ty-owned except for the co-op Chi
Theta Chi and the fraternity Sigma
Chi which have lease agreements
with the University and are owned
by separate alumni boards. Chi Theta
Chi and Sigma Chi are the only hous
es unaffected by the changes, accord
ing to student staff.
Michelle Berry 'l2, FM of the co
op Kairos, highlighted the unique as
pect of Stanford's housing options.
"One of the things to consider is
that we are basically the only system
like this in the country," Berry said.
"There's no other system that has all
of these University-owned houses
that are run by students. That is put
ting a large responsibility on stu
dents, so it's understandable that the
University and the donors and the
administration would be concerned
about giving this responsibility to
students."

Berry noted what she sees as im
plicit benefits to having a system
where students manage virtually all
aspects of house life, adding that in a
co-op like Kairos where students
all share the responsibility to cook
and clean it makes sense that resi
dents have decision-making power
for the house.

"I think we are going to have on
going conversations with the admin
istration about what our role at the
University is," Berry said. "I don't
know where that will lead though. I
want to say that I'm optimistic that
this system will continue in a similar
form as it is now."

Social dues
Social dues at Row houses are
now collected through the Universi
ty bill, according to ResEd adminis
trators, who noted that the change is
"consistent with all residences on
campus."
In previous years, FMs would
have to personally collect the social
dues from each of their house's resi
dents. Most FMs said they appreciat
ed the change, and that it has helped
to simplify the process. If residents
did not pay social dues in past years,
student FMs have had to place a hold
on a student's accounts or set a late
fine, according to Row management
documents.
Since ResEd placed social dues
on the University bill, the amount
has been standardized across all Row
houses at $75 per quarter. Previously,
it had been the duty of FMs to work
with house staff and residents to set
the price for social dues. Social dues
ranged from $23.64 at the sorority
Delta Delta Delta to $124.23 at the
self-op Phi Sig in the fall of 2007, ac
cording to Row management docu
ments.
Social dues can be used to fund
house trips, decorations for parties
and other items such as dorm
themed apparel. Since last spring, the
funds can no longer be used to pur
chase alcohol, which is what a bulk of
the money had been spent on in the
past, according to several FMs.
Anton Zietsman 'l2, FM of the
self-op La Maison Francaise, said
that the $75 amount is significantly
less than what his house has charged
in the past, stating that the money is
normally used to throw two all-cam
pus events, which require a large
amount of funds.
However, Maneeshika Madduri
'l3, Hammarskjold FM, said that the
standardized amount is more than
the $5O the co-op has historically
charged for social dues.
"It's a little bit different in the
sense that I don't have to go around
and ask people to give me checks for
social dues," she said. "But it's also
more than what most people in the
house expect."
Several FMs commented that it
has become more of a challenge to
purchase alcohol for house events
since they can no longer use money
from social dues.
"It's been kind of a nightmare for
me," said Travis Noll 'l2, FM of the
fraternity Kappa Alpha.
Noll said in previous years, FMs
were allowed to collect money from
residents and put those funds into
their University bank accounts to
make purchases. However, with last
spring's policy change, no money
from University bank accounts can
be spent on purchases that include
alcohol.
"I try to make sure that we have
alcohol when our social chairs have
requested it, and that it's paid for
properly, and we have enough
money for it, and the budget works
out," Noll said. He declined to state
how his house collects money for al
cohol, but did say that they do not use
their University-owned bank ac
counts.
Berry said the alcohol policy

change has gone more smoothly at
Kairos which holds a weekly
event known formally as "Cheese,"
but informally amongst students as
"Wine and Cheese."
Berry said residents in the house
have all pitched in a set amount to
keep this tradition alive, calling the
pot of money "slush funds."
Berry said she did not face stu
dents who refused to pay this extra
fund.
"They all understood that
whether you drink or not, this money
is being used for our Wine and
Cheese event, which is an integral
part of our house culture," she said.
When asked about houses unoffi
cially collecting money to purchase
alcohol, Boswell and Buzay said in an
email, "We do not account for funds
that students/houses decide to collect
outside of the University bill and out
side of the University bank account."
Payment of vendors
ResEd implemented a policy at
the beginning of the autumn quarter
that restricted FMs' access to funds
coming from residents' board bills.
However, after the University
missed payments to food vendors on
behalf of Row houses, and some
houses did not receive their ship
ments of food on time, ResEd re
versed the policy.
In previous years, FMs would pay
vendors directly for the food that was
delivered to their houses, using the
money from residents' board bills.
However, at the beginning of this ac
ademic year, ResEd decided to limit
FMs' access to only 30 percent of
their kitchen budget. The rest of the
budget 70 percent was held by
the Row Central Office, from which
University officials would pay ven
dors on behalf of Row houses after
FMs submitted their invoices.
Formally, the 30 percent that re
mained in house accounts was to be
used for "open kitchen" items
snacks and other food supplies that
can be accessed by residents any time
throughout the day.The other 70 per
cent, which was held by the Universi
ty, was set aside to purchase "closed
kitchen" items from vendors, or food
that is set aside for chefs to cook
meals.
"I think the overall reason [for the
policy change] was just so that they
could control more of the funds,"
Madduri said. "I think they wanted
to see how the University handled it
instead of having students take care
of so much money."
Noll said another reason why
ResEd may have implemented the
change was so they could "gain lever
age over vendors in terms of prices."
"We all share a lot of vendors in
common, and they thought that
rather than having 33 different hous
es paying a vendor, if one person
does it, then you can kind of convince
[the vendors]... to lower prices,"
Noll said.
Row houses purchase all of their
food from vendors including pro
duce, bread, meat and dairy products.
Student staff members decide the
amount and kinds of vendors they
wish to use and employ anywhere
from four mainstream vendors to
seven to 10 smaller, more specialty
vendors. Students maintained the
power to select which vendors to use
under the new policy at the beginning
of the year.
This year though, when houses re
ceived invoices from vendors, they
would log their purchases onto
Quickßooks, small business account
ing software that can be accessed
both remotely by individual FMs and
at the Row Central Office. In the past,
the Row used Excel spreadsheets to
keep track of house's financial
records.
Afterwards, FMs would place all
their invoices in an envelope that was
sent to the University, which would
be responsible for paying the ven
dors.
According to several FMs, the
University was often not able to
process these invoices quickly enough
to meet the deadlines for vendor pay
ments, and some houses temporarily
stopped receiving shipments of food
as a result. According to FMs and
ResEd administrators, this problem
was largely due to the fact that the
University's billing system is monthly,
while vendors expected to be paid
weekly.
One FM, who asked to remain
anonymous to avoid harming her
working relationship with the Univer
sity, said her house did not receive a
food delivery due to a missed pay
ment. However, she said the house
chef was able to talk to the vendor and
eventually convince them to lift the
hold on their account long enough for
the shipment to be delivered.
The day the shipment was origi
nally missed though, the chef had to
make dinner with the food the house
already had, the FM added.
Berry said that several of her
house's payments were also missed,
but that the house continued to re
ceive shipments and never ran into
any problems with its vendors.
"I think mainly because with the
vendors we use, we've been using
them for many years, and we have
good relationships with them," Berry
said. "So even though they weren't
getting paid, and some sent us emails
saying, 'Oh, we haven't received pay
ments yet,' none of them seemed
angry especially once we ex
plained what the issue was, they were
really understanding. All of our deliv

eries were made on time. We didn't
have an issue with that."

According to FMs, ResEd officials
considered two solutions to solve the
problem: limiting the amount of ven
dors Row houses could use to five or
restoring the responsibility to pay
vendors to FMs. ResEd eventually
chose the latter option.
"This shift represents the institu
tion's growing confidence that our
program can be maintained by stu
dents, provided they perform their
duties within the structures we contin
ue to develop," Arredondo wrote in
an Oct. 31 email to Row management
in which he announced the policy re
versal.

Financial Associate
FMs are now required to submit a
weekly report including all profits,
losses and receipts to Arredondo, who
fills the new ResEd position of Finan
cial Associate.
Several FMs expressed that this
change has been positive.
"I like it because there's a go-to
person that if I have a question, I can
ask or if I have any concerns about
my budget, I can talk to," Madduri
said.
FMs said that the recent policy
changes have not affected Row life in
any significant way, but the conversa
tions between ResEd and the Univer
sity are ongoing, and they want to

make sure that the tradition of stu
dent management continues.
"I feel like if this power was taken
away from student managers, then
that ideology would be lost, and we
wouldn't be able to live in our houses
in away that we would like," Berry
said.
"Transition of this kind is always
challenging," ResEd administrators
Boswell and Buzay said. "But we be
lieve that the changes still allow for
the flexibility of student-led manage
ment and adherence to University
policies."
