# ResEd tweaks Row financial policies
## 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
The Office of Residential Education (ResEd)
has implemented changes to the financial policies
for student-managed Row houses over the recent
months, following the identification of several
"compliance issues" during a general review
process, according to administrators.
These changes, some of which have endured
while others have not, included more University
oversight of student house dues and vendor pay
ment.
In an email to The Daily, Assistant Dean of
ResEd Nate Boswell referenced the Sept. 2010 hir
ing of Director of Operations Aaron Buzay as the
result of a larger review process conducted by Deb
orah Golder, dean of Res Ed.
"The hiring of this position increased oversight
of all operational and financial activities in ResEd

and supplemented existing partnerships with Busi
ness Affairs," Boswell said. "During the first com
prehensive review conducted by Director Buzay,
the department identified several compliance is
sues that required attention and worked together
with the Auditing Office and other Business Affairs
partners to make corrections."
This past spring, ResEd prohibited Row houses
from using social dues to purchase alcohol, citing a
school policy that restricts University funds from
being used to buy alcohol for those under the age
of 21. Several house financial managers (FMs)
noted that under the previous system, Stanford
could be held legally responsible in the case of an
alcohol-related accident, since the purchases were
made through University-owned bank accounts.
At the outset of this autumn quarter, the Uni
versity introduced a new round of changes to Row
financial policies.
ResEd standardized Row house social dues at

$75 and began collecting this fee through students'
University bills instead of through student FMs.
ResEd also experimented with the way Row house
food vendors are paid, shifting the responsibility
from FMs to the Row Central Office for the first
five weeks of the quarter.
A new staff member, Financial Associate Jo
Arredondo, is charged with looking over weekly
house budget reports and serves as a point person
for FMs.
These changes raised several questions for FMs
about the shifting nature of their role and what au
tonomy they can expect to have in the future.
"We are committed to preserving the core
tenets of the student management program which
is geared towards enabling student leaders to build
vibrant, intimate residential communities," wrote
Boswell and Buzay in a joint email to The Daily.

financial managers are no longer officially in charge of collecting student social dues, though several said they maintain "slush" funds for alcohol.
