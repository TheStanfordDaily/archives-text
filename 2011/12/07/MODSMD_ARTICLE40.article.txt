## The 						year's best albums 
### – maria, DEL CARMEN BARRIOS, andrea HINTON, ben LABOY, sara VAN RENSSELAER contact them: intermission@stanforddaily. com 
It's hard to designate 12 months' worth of
musical releases as "weak," but if any year
can boldly claim the tide, if s 2011. The
homogeneity of radio favorites is almost ridicu
lous: add some dubstep and you're guaranteed
to go platinum. "Sexy And I Know It" has now
spent three solid months in the top three of the
Billboard Hot 100 enough said. There were
catchy releases and a smattering of good songs,
but when entire albums were great, they were
almost impeccable. Here are a couple examples
of what we mean.

"Helplessness Blues" Fleet Foxes
Three years in the making, "Helplessness
Blues" can hardly be called a lazy effort by Fleet
Foxes. After scrapping the greater part of a first
album, the band buckled down with producer
Phil Ek (The Shins, Band of Horses) to turn out
their sophomore effort after they exploded onto
the indie scene in 2008. The album is somber
and introspective, more invested in re-creating

the quality of memo
ries and contemplation
than the pastoral
atmosphere of their
first release.
"Helplessness Blues,"
the single and arguably

the best track, is the pensive epitome of the
whole album. It's the finest example of Robin
Peckold's songwriting ability, a vivid description
of the emotional turmoil following self-interro
gation regarding one's place in the world.

"Watch The Throne"
Jay-Z and Kanye West
The album might be so good because
everyone expected it to be after all, Jay and
'Ye are the current and indisputable kings of
hip-hop. But with a nod to the past (the album
includes the voices of '6os artists Otis Redding
and Nina Simone) and possibly the most unex
pected samples to be thrown into rap ("Ni**as
in Paris" features Will Ferrell and Jon Heder
from their comedy "Blades of Glory"), "Watch
The Throne" became an opulent masterpiece on
the often gilded life of fame.

"The King of Limbs" Radiohead
Despite its relatively short length (eight
songs, 37 min), "The King of Limbs" is a vastly
complex collection of songs, and as with every

Radiohead album, the more you listen to it, the
more layers you discover. As a whole, the group
has departed from writing melody-driven power
ballads, and this LP conjures up a contemplative,
more abstract feel. "Lotus Flower" is quite a mas
terpiece. The thick, rolling bass line fills out the
track and complements Yorke's cutting falsetto
perfectly throughout the song. Watch the official
video for a wild performance of Yorke jolting and
shimmying to the beat; while certainly not a con
ventional music video, it is yet another interesting
stylistic innovation by the group. Plus, if anything
else, you might find a link to one of the countless
viral videos of his dance moves mashed up with
Beyonce or Lady Gaga.

"21" Adele
Adele's sophomore album, "21", took

2011 by storm.
"Rolling in the Deep"
became the new go-to'
anthem of revenge
after a bitter break-up
and dominated the
airwaves for much of
the summer. Her

melancholy follow up single "Someone Like
You" (which you've probably heard loudly
sung by a small group of drunken dorm
mates) has received similar airplay and was
featured in a hilarious "SNL" sketch with

Emma Stone. The remainder of the album
keeps with the soul that was present in her
first album, "19", but exposes a feistier side to
Adele and her style, exemplified by tracks like
the thumping "Rumour Has It."
—SV
"Mylo Xyloto" — Coldplay
"Mylo Xyloto" is an album that, like so

many of Coldplay's
works, has to grow on
the listener.
Considering that the
title means absolutely
nothing, this one
understandably takes a
little longer than usual

to figure out. "Mylo" resembles its predecessor,
"Viva la Vida," in its production, but the pomp
and circumstance were assuaged by a quiet
romance, steering the album away from the
realm of French Revolution victory speeches
for the better. It might not sound exactly like
"X&Y," but Coldplay makes a pretty convincing
argument that they've moved on to equally
appealing melodies.
