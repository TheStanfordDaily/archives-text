## 2011 in movies: Best and worst 
### â€“ misa SHIKUMA contact misa: mshikuma@stanford. edu 
In a February GQ article ominously titled "The Day the
Movies Died," eminent film-writer Mark Harris dubbed
2011 the year of sequels, prequels, reboots, adaptations and
endless permutations of the above. Not that any of these are
inherently problematic, but when studios repeatedly churn them
out instead of coming up with something new to show us, well,
it's frustrating to say the least. Despite Mr. Harris' dismal movie
forecast, 2011 had its share of standouts, and with a packed slate
of big budget films and Oscar bait set to debut over the next few
weeks, possibly even more to come.
Top Picks:
10. "Captain America: The First Avenger"
Although there were many comic book adaptations to
choose from this year, only one had the winning combination of
containing a plethora of loud explosions and being emotionally
affective. In other hands, the noble Steve Rogers (the man
beneath the superhero getup) could have easily become sappy,
but Chris Evans balances the character's earnestness, courage
and sensitivity remarkably well.
9. "Crazy, Stupid, Love."
Writer Dan Fogelman sets a new standard for the genre by
showing the ups and downs of relationships while deftly avoid
ing the pitfalls of being overly trite and campy. Featuring an
outstanding ensemble cast that includes Steve Carell, Ryan
Gosling, fulianne Moore and Emma Stone, it pokes fun at love
while reminding us that it's attainable at all ages.
8. "Bridesmaids"

"SNL" spotlight-stealer Kristen Wiig takes on her first star
ring role in what many have dubbed the female equivalent to
"The Hangover." Centered on a struggling pastry chef whose
best friend's wedding instigates a tense rivalry with a fellow
bridesmaid, the movie isn't afraid to show women being just as
bawdy as men. It's refreshing, hilarious, awkward and oftentimes
all three at the same time.
7. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"
The decade-long saga based on f.K. Rowling's beloved book
series finally comes to its thrilling conclusion. Except for some
questionable prosthetic makeup at the end, this diehard fan of the
series found the adaptation to be a surprisingly adequate tribute.

6. "Attack the Block"
From the producers of "Shaun of the Dead" and "Hot
Fuzz" comes a new side-splitting saga centered on a gang of
South London youths who must protect their working-class
housing development (aka "the block") from an alien invasion.
The dialect may be a bit of a shock for those used to hearing
proper Colin Firth-like accents in British movies, but by the end
you'll be wishing you could say, "Believe, broth-a," with the same
swag as these street kids.
5. "Take Shelter"
Set amidst the rural cornfields of Ohio, "Take Shelter" fol
lows a working-class family man as he experiences a series of
increasingly graphic nightmares revolving around a violent
storm. Shaken by these visions, his erratic behavior soon begins
to take a toll on his wife and young daughter. With the suspense
rising as you can no longer be certain of whether he is glimpsing
the future or merely losing his mind, this is the thought-provok
ing answer to all the overblown apocalypse and disaster duds of

recent years.
4. "Midnight In Paris"
In Woody Allen's time-traveling story, a struggling
American writer discovers a portal back to 1920s Paris, where he
finds inspiration in the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude
Stein and Pablo Picasso. Equal parts romantic comedy and his
torical drama, even the kitsch factor can't stop its undeniable
charm. Plus, you can give yourself and your liberal education a
pat on the back for recognizing all the members of the Parisian
glitterati and catching the film's pop-culture references.
3. "Pariah"

Writer/director Dee Rees' poignant debut feature focuses
on a Brooklyn teen not only struggling to come into her own as
a young woman, but also trying to come out to her fractured
family. Aided by a strong cast dominated by newcomers, this is
powerful, intimate storytelling at its best.

2. "Another Earth"
Upon being released from prison for her involvement in a
fatal car crash, a young woman attempts to make amends with
the man whose family she killed. Things get even more compli
cated when a contest opens to win a trip to Earth Two, the plan
et that first became visible on the night of the accident, and
both characters begin to question if their parallel lives still result
in tragedy. "Another Earth" stays grounded by its haunting por
trayal of how the choices we make stay with us forever.
1. "The Descendants"
Alexander Payne makes a triumphant return to the screen
with this alternately hilarious and tear-jerking story of a distant
father (George Clooney) trying to hold his family together in
the wake of a tragedy. Clooney has never been better, and the
film's gorgeous Hawaiian scenery will provide a nice respite
from whatever cold climate you might be going home to this
break.
Worst Picks:
Worst Sequel: The Hangover Part II"
As the title suggests, "The Hangover Part II" is merely "The
Hangover" redux, albeit less funny and with more male geni
talia. The physical setting may be different, but when the novelty
of the franchise is the novelty itself, using the same storyline

doesn't quite cut it.
Fingers crossed that


there isn't a "Part III" in the works.
Worst Adaptation: "Atlas
Shrugged"
A thousand-page book about
trains that features two-dimension
al characters, which are all stand
ins for an overarching ideological
agenda, is one thing. A low-budget
movie adaptation whose script
consists of passages cut and pasted
together from said book is quite
another and, for most people, far
worse. If "Atlas Shrugged" succeed
ed at anything, it's to prove that
one can, in fact, be too loyal to the
book.

the future or merely losing his mind, this is the thought-provok
ing answer to all the overblown apocalypse and disaster duds of

recent years.
4. "Midnight In Paris"
In Woody Allen's time-traveling story, a struggling
American writer discovers a portal back to 1920s Paris, where he
finds inspiration in the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude
Stein and Pablo Picasso. Equal parts romantic comedy and his
torical drama, even the kitsch factor can't stop its undeniable
charm. Plus, you can give yourself and your liberal education a
pat on the back for recognizing all the members of the Parisian
glitterati and catching the film's pop-culture references.
3. "Pariah"

Writer/director Dee Rees' poignant debut feature focuses
on a Brooklyn teen not only struggling to come into her own as
a young woman, but also trying to come out to her fractured
family. Aided by a strong cast dominated by newcomers, this is
powerful, intimate storytelling at its best.

2. "Another Earth"
Upon being released from prison for her involvement in a
fatal car crash, a young woman attempts to make amends with
the man whose family she killed. Things get even more compli
cated when a contest opens to win a trip to Earth Two, the plan
et that first became visible on the night of the accident, and
both characters begin to question if their parallel lives still result
in tragedy. "Another Earth" stays grounded by its haunting por
trayal of how the choices we make stay with us forever.
1. "The Descendants"
Alexander Payne makes a triumphant return to the screen
with this alternately hilarious and tear-jerking story of a distant
father (George Clooney) trying to hold his family together in
the wake of a tragedy. Clooney has never been better, and the
film's gorgeous Hawaiian scenery will provide a nice respite
from whatever cold climate you might be going home to this
break.
Worst Picks:
Worst Sequel: The Hangover Part II"
As the title suggests, "The Hangover Part II" is merely "The
Hangover" redux, albeit less funny and with more male geni
talia. The physical setting may be different, but when the novelty
of the franchise is the novelty itself, using the same storyline

doesn't quite cut it.
Fingers crossed that


there isn't a "Part III" in the works.
Worst Adaptation: "Atlas
Shrugged"
A thousand-page book about
trains that features two-dimension
al characters, which are all stand
ins for an overarching ideological
agenda, is one thing. A low-budget
movie adaptation whose script
consists of passages cut and pasted
together from said book is quite
another and, for most people, far
worse. If "Atlas Shrugged" succeed
ed at anything, it's to prove that
one can, in fact, be too loyal to the
book.
In a February GQ article ominously titled "The Day the
Movies Died," eminent film-writer Mark Harris dubbed
2011 the year of sequels, prequels, reboots, adaptations and
endless permutations of the above. Not that any of these are
inherently problematic, but when studios repeatedly churn them
out instead of coming up with something new to show us, well,
it's frustrating to say the least. Despite Mr. Harris' dismal movie
forecast, 2011 had its share of standouts, and with a packed slate
of big budget films and Oscar bait set to debut over the next few
weeks, possibly even more to come.
Top Picks:
10. "Captain America: The First Avenger"
Although there were many comic book adaptations to
choose from this year, only one had the winning combination of
containing a plethora of loud explosions and being emotionally
affective. In other hands, the noble Steve Rogers (the man
beneath the superhero getup) could have easily become sappy,
but Chris Evans balances the character's earnestness, courage
and sensitivity remarkably well.
9. "Crazy, Stupid, Love."
Writer Dan Fogelman sets a new standard for the genre by
showing the ups and downs of relationships while deftly avoid
ing the pitfalls of being overly trite and campy. Featuring an
outstanding ensemble cast that includes Steve Carell, Ryan
Gosling, fulianne Moore and Emma Stone, it pokes fun at love
while reminding us that it's attainable at all ages.
8. "Bridesmaids"

"SNL" spotlight-stealer Kristen Wiig takes on her first star
ring role in what many have dubbed the female equivalent to
"The Hangover." Centered on a struggling pastry chef whose
best friend's wedding instigates a tense rivalry with a fellow
bridesmaid, the movie isn't afraid to show women being just as
bawdy as men. It's refreshing, hilarious, awkward and oftentimes
all three at the same time.
7. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"
The decade-long saga based on f.K. Rowling's beloved book
series finally comes to its thrilling conclusion. Except for some
questionable prosthetic makeup at the end, this diehard fan of the
series found the adaptation to be a surprisingly adequate tribute.

6. "Attack the Block"
From the producers of "Shaun of the Dead" and "Hot
Fuzz" comes a new side-splitting saga centered on a gang of
South London youths who must protect their working-class
housing development (aka "the block") from an alien invasion.
The dialect may be a bit of a shock for those used to hearing
proper Colin Firth-like accents in British movies, but by the end
you'll be wishing you could say, "Believe, broth-a," with the same
swag as these street kids.
5. "Take Shelter"
Set amidst the rural cornfields of Ohio, "Take Shelter" fol
lows a working-class family man as he experiences a series of
increasingly graphic nightmares revolving around a violent
storm. Shaken by these visions, his erratic behavior soon begins
to take a toll on his wife and young daughter. With the suspense
rising as you can no longer be certain of whether he is glimpsing
the future or merely losing his mind, this is the thought-provok
ing answer to all the overblown apocalypse and disaster duds of

recent years.
