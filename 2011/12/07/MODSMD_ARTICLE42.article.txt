# A 						second opinion...

This has been a year for daring movies,
and the best of them have all been
movies that I feel like I've never seen
before. If someone had told me the best films
this year would include a Martin Scorsese chil
dren's movie and a comedy about cancer, I
wouldn't have believed either could even get
made. Fortunately my instincts were wrong,
and we have some new movies to treasure for
years to come.
"The Tree of Life"
This year's most bold and evocative movie
comes from one of my favorite filmmakers of
all time. Terrence Malick composes a beautiful

epic poem that is as daring as
it is touching, as elegant as it is
piercing and provocative. It is

unlike anything I've ever seen before, and this
challenging film will remain at the top of my
list for years to come.
"The Artist"
This movie just hit theatres at Cine Arts,
and it is not one to be missed. Beyond the fact
that it is going to win a bucket of Oscars, it is
also the most charming and joyous movie I
have seen all year. It's a black-and-white silent
movie that follows a movie star during the
silent film era, when talkies started to become
popular. Don't be afraid of the premise it's
guaranteed to be the most magical night at the

movies this year.
"50/50"
You will laugh, you will cry and you will
love "50/50." Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character
is diagnosed with cancer, and he must negoti
ate life with his best friend (Seth Rogen), his
extremely young therapist (Anna Kendrick),
his obsessive mother (Anjelica Huston) and his
wet-blanket girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard).
Everyone gives a touching performance, and I

challenge you not to cry during this hilarious
and heart-warming tale.
"Super 8"
This alien monster movie was made on a
relatively small budget, but it certainly packs the
largest punch of any blockbuster I saw this year.
A group of kids in a small town in the '7os
stumbles across a train wreck while filming a
student movie. The suspense and action are
exhilarating, leaving you nostalgic for monster
movies and pleasantly surprised at this charm
ing yet thrilling film.
"Hugo"
This movie is just too difficult to put into
a box. It's a Martin Scorsese-directed children's
movie about a clock-fixing orphan in a train

station, the limping train station security offi
cer played by Sacha Baron Cohen, the disgrun
tled toy maker and his granddaughter. The
train station is rendered with extravagant tones
of gold and blue, and it will transport you to
this foreign world where a love of going to the
movies is all you need to join the club.
Honorable Mentions: "Horrible Bosses,"
"Martha Marcy May Marlene," "Midnight in
Paris," "The Muppets," "Source Code"
Dishonorable Mentions:
"The Green Hornet"
Even though Seth Rogen lost all of that
weight, he is unconvincing as a super hero,

Chinese pop sensation Jay Chou is less interest
ing than cardboard and the once-terrifying
Christoph Waltz looks like a clown. You know
it's truly a terrible movie when the best part
about it is Cameron Diaz.
"Hop"
I was genuinely excited for this movie about
the Easter Bunny's son who just wants to be a
rock-and-roll drummer. It was reductive and juve
nile (although I should've guessed that), it forced
un-cute animated chicks down your throat and
the Easter Bunny world (on Easter Island, natural
ly) was so vile and tacky it made my eyes bleed.
