## THE
						YEAR IN PIXELS: 2011's greatest moments 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
Not too long from now, I might look back
on 2011 as a year when I spent an
unhealthy amount of time with my jaw
hanging open in front of my television screen.
For better or worse, developers this year seemed
to focus on the big "impact" moments those
plot-points and set-pieces that reach legendary
You Tube status and have you texting your friends
at 2 a.m. Other games, as they always have, made
for great water-cooler moments in less scripted
but more personal ways. But regardless of
method, half the fun of those experiences comes
from sharing them. So if you'll indulge me a bit,
here are my favorite moments of 2011.
Dead Space 2 Eye and the Needle
Cheap horror movies like "Saw" really don't
do it for me. They're gruesome to be sure, but if
onscreen action is going to keep me up at night,
it needs to put me in the mind of a believably
traumatized character, not just show me some
one's body being brutalized. Dead Space 2 deliv
ers on both fronts, standing as the genre's best
example of how interactivity can foster a visceral
sort of pathos that's unachievable in films. That
point hit home for me in the game's final
stretch, when protagonist Isaac Clarke an
eerily relatable character compared to his 2008
debut needs to make a grotesque and
unthinkable sacrifice. To describe the scene in
detail would be a disservice; it needs to be
played. But as you, the player, lower tapered
metal ever closer to Isaac's shivering flesh, I chal
lenge you to keep your composure.
Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception Just Deserts
I've heard people criticize this scene for
involving little more than "just pushing forward."
It's a fair argument, but one that belittles the very

core of the Uncharted franchise. Trudging
through the Arabian sandscape is special because
it epitomizes the preeminent trait of one of gam
ing's most endearing characters: Nathan Drake is
a normal man with relatable vulnerabilities.
We've been through a lot with Nate, but until
Drake's Deception, we'd never seen him reduced
to the basic need for food and water. One mirage

gives way to the next, the sun sets and
rises, and still we press forward with
fleeting clarity. The camera pulls back

to show the endless sea of dunes;
Nate is lost in body and mind,
and we're right there with him.

Batman: Arkham City
Jumped by a Shark

It's surprisingly non
controversial to say that
Batman: Arkham City {
has the best brawl- CTJ
ing mechanics of any '
game since the 16-bit
days. After Arkham

Asylum, I'd even say it was
expected. But I never
would've predicted that I'd

need to unleash my Bat-fists on
the snout of 25-foot great white
shark. Beholding the beast as it

breaks through the waves and
onto your precarious bit of flotsam

is a legitimate shocker for the decidedly

T-rated game, not to mention a brilliantly
subtle throwback to the classic 1966 film,

when Adam West goes toe-to-toe with a laugh
able plastic prop. It was also the only moment
this year that made me scream out loud.

(Seriously, who the hell would expect that? Not
me.) Holy Sardine, Batman!
Portal 2 Shooting (to) the Moon
The brilliance of Portal 2's moonshot is that
it doesn't need to tell the player to do anything
the game's no-nonsense premise has trained
you to fire at highlighted surfaces, and after see
ing the roof break open with the full moon shin-

ing through, keen players might even
k recall an otherwise throw-away conver-

sation about how Portals rely on
k lunar particles. So with one last but-
ton-tap and a "here-we-go"
sparkle, it's off to space with evil

robots in tow and a dumb
founded grin on your face,
The Elder Scrolls V:
Skyrim
B A Stealing a Heart
/ The stand-out fea
ture of this entry is that I
came upon it by chance.
V Not to say that I'm special:
J Skyrim's greatest strengths are
its emergent gameplay and adap-

f tive storytelling. With a massive
world to explore and intricate sys-

* terns overlapping in unpredictable

ways, Skyrim allows an imaginative play-

er to craft his or her own set of unique

> tales. You could almost think of this entry as a
W stand-in for whatever your own "Skyrim

moment" might be.
After a long journey west, only a small
band of Forsworn warriors separated me from
the final components I needed to reforge the
legendary blade, Mehrunes' Razor. My housecarl

and I could handle most of them without trou
ble; moving silently up the mountainside, we
made short work of the archers and swordsmen.
But a powerful witchdoctor stood firmly in my
path he was barely a man now, with tortur
ous sutures holding his body together and his
chest gaping open. A gruesome, bestial heart
pulsed steadily in place of his own. As he sought
me out to make a final blow, I took shelter in a
cave and considered my options maybe I
could slip some poison into his pockets or steal
some of his charms. I just needed to get close
enough. I told my companion to wait, cast a
silencing spell and tracked the shaman down.
Slumped over his alchemy laboratory and mut
tering some incantations, he was deep in
thought. Now was my chance. In a flash, the
unthinkable presented itself to me. It was gutsy
literally but I went for it. I tore the throb
bing mass from his chest, and the mighty
shaman collapsed. At last, I'd taken the summit.
After I stole his heart, I knew Skyrim had
stolen mine.
