## STOP WATCHING 'New Girl', SAVE 'Community' 
### â€” aaron BRODER contact aaron: abroder@stanford. edu 
It's that time of year again: that
special time when everyone
burns through their backlog of
television shows in a desperate effort
to put off homework and studying.
For the more discerning procrastina
tors, however, it might help to have
an idea of what in your Hulu queue
is actually worth watching. Here are
a few of my superlative awards for
the front half of the season.

Best Show You Need to Help
Save "Community"
"Community" has always
teetered on the edge of cancellation,
but now that it's vanished from the
midseason schedule for an indefinite
hiatus, it's time to rally the troops. If
you're a fan, tell your friends about it
and (most importantly) keep watch
ing. If you're not, well, the hiatus
gives you time to give "Community"
a try. In the past few weeks, it's been
a documentary, explored parallel
timelines and was (very briefly) an
anime, and yet it manages to com
bine these epic, over-the-top
moments with an emotional
grounding that meshes surprisingly
well and makes for one of the most
well-written sitcoms on TV.
Biggest Surprise of the Season
"Once Upon A Time"
I probably shouldn't like ABC's
"Once Upon a Time," but I do any
way. Instead of keeping you guessing
at some elusive mystery, the solution
of which is almost sure to disap
point, it gives you most everything
that matters upfront and lets you
care about the characters and how
they're going to get out of the mess
they're in. It's campy, heavy-handed

and doesn't exactly revolutionize the
Disney princesses, but it's good
enough to keep me watching, and at
least it's trying to mix up the format
a bit harder than its NBC counter
part, "Grimm."
Least Impressive New Show of
the Season "New Girl"
I didn't have high expectations
for "New Girl" from the start, but the
show hasn't done anything to exceed
the already low expectations. They're
relying too much on Zooey
Deschanel to carry... pretty much
everything, actually, and she's just
unable to support the sitcom plot
retreads and quirkiness that goes a
step or two past adorable. Sorry, Fox;
maybe next year?
Most Disappointing Cliffhanger
Resolutions of the Season
"How I Met Your Mother"

Until a week or two ago, I
would have picked on "Castle,"
whose writers seemed to have con
venientiy forgotten about Beckett's
shooting, much less the fact that she
knows Castle confessed his love for
her. But with "Kill Shot" dramatical
ly changing Beckett's character in
response to the former, I'm willing
to give them a slight pass on the lat
ter. Instead, I'll have to give the
award to "How I Met Your Mother"
and its writers; though it's pretty
obvious that Barney's going to end
up with Robin now, I'll be damned
if they aren't prolonging it.
