As college students and writers
of an arts and entertainment
section, we Intermission
staffers take pride in being some of
the biggest couch potatoes you'll
probably ever meet. Who'll nab the
GOP nomination? How would we
solve the debt crisis in Europe?
Damn if we know. What moments
were totally worth rewinding on
Hulu (or on your DVR if you could
afford such luxuries here)? Take a
look and find out.

"Game of Thrones" —Season
One finale

One of the most talked-about
new shows of 2011, "Game of
Thrones" adapts George R. R.
Martin's complicated fantasy series
into a surprisingly watchable TV
show. The first season culminated in
the jaw-dropping final scene when
Daenerys, last of the Targaryens,
walks into her husband's funeral pyre
and emerges with three newly
hatched dragons. The scene forms
the perfect cliffhanger for the end of
Season One.

Runner-up moment: In the penul
timate episode of Season One titled
"Baelor," one of the main characters
is killed off. If you watch the show,
this rings true as one of the most
shocking episodes on television. To
kill off a character so central to the
plot and the narrative devices at play
with little warning and grave conse
quences was so daring and true to
the plot and nature of those evil
Lannisters that I can't wait for
Season Two.

"Gossip Girl" —The Dair story
line
For once, "Gossip Girl" actually

did some realistic character and
relationship development and
finally gave us a reason to care
about this show that had stumbled
so much the previous year. Dan
and Blair verbally sparred as
though they were in a 1930s
screwball comedy, making every
scene between them spark: Dan
dubbing Blair a "dictator of taste,"
watching "Rosemary's Baby" over
the phone together, falling asleep
watching "The Philadelphia Story"
and culminating in their freeze
frame kiss.

"The Good Wife" —Alicia
Florrick finally kicks her husband
out

In the last two years, we've
watched her wade through so
much chaos caused by her adulter
ous, philandering husband as she
secretly pines for Will Gardiner.
How empowering for her to finally
stop being "the good wife" and
give his undeserving ass the boot.
Runner-up moment: It's proof
positive that Peter can be such an
awful sleaze-bag, but it was terribly
exciting to anticipate just how bit
ter and scary he could be and how
destructive he might be to Alicia.
We hate him for it, but we kind of
love the show for having him go
there.

"New Girl" "Wedding"
It's no surprise that "New Girl,"
starring Zooey Deschanel, is one of
the most-watched new series of the
fall. The third episode, "Wedding,"
brought Zooey s character and her
three male roommates together for
an episode that consisted of photo
booth shenanigans, dance-offs and a
slow-motion chicken dance. The
episode provided enough laughs to
cement "New Girl's" status as the
year's best new comedy.

"The League" —The mind con
trol of Kevin

This comedy about four guys in
a fantasy football league is one of the
funniest shows on television. It is
foul, raunchy and borderline offen
sive, but also extremely clever and
unexpected. In the first episode of
Season Three, Kevin's best friend
Pete, his wife Jenny and his brother
Taco all reveal that they have been
trying to control his thoughts sub
liminally. The payoff is hands-down
the hardest I have laughed in a year.

"Glee" Santana, Mercedes and
the Troubletones perform "Rumour
Has It/ Someone Like You"

In the midst of Glee's third sea
son, Santana, Mercedes and the
Troubletones' performance of Adele's
"Someone Like You" combined with
"Rumour Has It" was a true show
stopper. The mash-up itself is musi
cally impressive some are calling
it the best musical number Glee has
ever done but more strikingly, it
finally propelled Mercedes and
Santana into the spotlight after two
seasons of backing up Rachel.

"The Big Bang Theory" "The
Herb Garden Germination"
The Season Four episode starts
like any other episode of this beloved
show. When Sheldon and his girl
friend Amy decide to start spreading
rumors, the whole gang completely
falls apart. The farce spins out of
control and Sheldon and Amy con-

tinue to perpetuate the madness.

"Vampire Diaries" Stefan goes to the dark side
The most recent season of the Vampire Diaries has
been better than ever, with the creators pushing the
Originals' storyline from last season into shocking new
territory. But what really stands out is good-guy vampire
Stefan's descent into the dark side. Usually the show's pil
lar of morality in the midst of evil, Stefan transformed
into a killing, blood-drinking monster while former vil
lain Damon now plays the good guy. With these roles
reversed, the show is more gripping than ever.
HE
"True Blood" Bill and Jessica hide from the
witches
As the witches begin gathering more power
under the evil witch leader Marnie, the vampires use
silver chains to pin themselves inside. While it seems
that the main hunk Bill and his sexy, but na'ive proge-

Ny Jessica are safely strapped in, Marnie and her fol
lowers cast a spell to force all of the vampires out into
the daylight. This moment in the middle of Season
Four was heart-pounding.
BH
"Grey's Anatomy" —Alex discovers that Arizona
thinks he's the future of pediatrics
Alex Karev has taken such a beating on this show,
moving from a crazy girlfriend to a cancerous and aban
doning wife to a backstabbing girlfriend. Meanwhile, he's
always felt second string in the operating room to
Meredith and Cristina. He's grown into this three
dimensional damaged but grown-up and caring charac
ter over the years and it was so satisfying to see him final
ly validated.
