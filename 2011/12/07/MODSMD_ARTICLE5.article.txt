## Stanford's Occupy movement continues to evolve 
### MARSHALL WATKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than one month after
the Occupy protests spread to
the West Coast, members of the
Stanford community continue
to be actively involved with the
movement. Students, staff and
faculty have maintained the
"Occupy Stanford" movement
while also developing an "Occu
py the Future" initiative in
hopes of mobilizing the broader
University community.
Both Stanford students and
law enforcement officers from
the University's Department of
Public Safety (SUDPS) have
been extensively involved in
Bay Area Occupy protests.
Stanford sheriffs, along with
Palo Alto PD officers, were dis
patched to assist Oakland PD in
evicting Occupy protestors from
a city encampment on Oct. 25.

The ensuing confrontation re
sulted in the use of riot gear and
less-than-lethal ammunition by
law enforcement, as well as over
100 arrests and critical injuries
to a protesting Iraq War veter
an.

The first Occupy Stanford
general assembly took place on
Oct. 14 in White Plaza. Several
students have made repeated
trips to Bay Area Occupy move
ments, with some present during
the Oct. 25 crackdown in Oak
land and a larger contingent
participating in the successful
takeover of the Oakland city
port on Nov. 2.
