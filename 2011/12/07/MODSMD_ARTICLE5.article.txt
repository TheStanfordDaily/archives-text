## Stanford's Occupy movement continues to evolve 
### MARSHALL WATKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than one month after
the Occupy protests spread to
the West Coast, members of the
Stanford community continue
to be actively involved with the
movement. Students, staff and
faculty have maintained the
"Occupy Stanford" movement
while also developing an "Occu
py the Future" initiative in
hopes of mobilizing the broader
University community.
Both Stanford students and
law enforcement officers from
the University's Department of
Public Safety (SUDPS) have
been extensively involved in
Bay Area Occupy protests.
Stanford sheriffs, along with
Palo Alto PD officers, were dis
patched to assist Oakland PD in
evicting Occupy protestors from
a city encampment on Oct. 25.

The ensuing confrontation re
sulted in the use of riot gear and
less-than-lethal ammunition by
law enforcement, as well as over
100 arrests and critical injuries
to a protesting Iraq War veter
an.

The first Occupy Stanford
general assembly took place on
Oct. 14 in White Plaza. Several
students have made repeated
trips to Bay Area Occupy move
ments, with some present during
the Oct. 25 crackdown in Oak
land and a larger contingent
participating in the successful
takeover of the Oakland city
port on Nov. 2.

Occupy supporters are currently camping out and discussing issues of inequality
around the clock in the 24/7 first-floor study group area of Meyer.

Dan Ashton 'l4 authored a letter
on Nov. 29 to be distributed en
couraging the SUDPS to avoid vi
olence when dispersing protestors
on University grounds and to re
main respectful of student dia
logue.
"Regardless of the causes of
the violence at those schools, pro
tection of student safety is cer
tainly something about which stu
dent government should be pas
sionate," Ashton wrote in an
email to The Daily. "I have no rea
son to believe that Stanford po
lice will react violently to student
protests. Laura Wilson, Chief of
Police, has done a wonderful job
thus far of enabling free assembly,
and I see no reason why that
won't continue,"
Wilson confirmed that the
SUDPS has met internally and
with other University officials to
discuss potential responses to situ
ations involving the Occupy
movements. She added that
SUDPS officers were trained to
use â€”if necessary a level of
force just enough to overcome the
level of resistance, and she noted
that the use of pepper spray on
nonviolent protesters would not
be authorized.
Wilson played down concerns
about the Occupy movement at
Stanford, writing in an email to
The Daily that, "so far, the indi
viduals involved with this move
ment have been respectful of oth
ers and have not interfered with
the academic mission of the insti
tution. My hope is that this com
munity will continue to engage in
intellectual, respectful and
peaceful means of dialogue so
that police intervention is not re
quired."
While acknowledging that
there is currently no consistent
and ongoing dialogue between
SUDPS and students involved in
Occupy Stanford, Wilson noted
that SUDPS and students success
fully communicated in advance of
the anti-police brutality rally that
took place before Big Game.
"Should the need arise, we will
certainly meet with students. If
students want to speak with us
about their plans, we are happy to

meet with them as well," Wilson
wrote.
Occupy Meyer
Occupy Stanford has continued
to protest on campus, most recent
ly establishing a permanent pres
ence in the lobby of Meyer Li
brary. Occupy Meyer, where the
movement has also held General
Assembly meetings, was devel
oped according to participants
as a means of emphasizing
Stanford's ongoing relevance to
the Occupy movement.The move
ment currently mans a table in the
library lobby around the clock.
"The symbolism of occupying
an academic place is important,"
said Zach O'Keeffe 'l3. "We want
to open up a space for intellectual
dialogue, to discuss problems and
solutions in a very academic way.
[At Occupy Meyer] there's the fis
sion of the intellectual and aca
demic with the activist and pro
gressive nature of the Occupy
movement."

O'Keeffe added that the group
chose Meyer instead of Green Li
brary in order to minimize disrup
tion to students. Joshua Schott 'l4
noted that occupying Meyer also
gave the movement the ability to
reach more students in an area
which is heavily trafficked.
Students involved with Occupy
Stanford highlighted other efforts
being undertaken by the move
ment. Current initiatives include
investigating the disbursement of
Stanford's endowment to ensure
that all expenditure is conducted
in a socially responsible manner,
protesting recruitment events for
firms deemed to have acted in a
socially irresponsible manner and
supporting anti-inequality groups
on campus.
Schott said that Occupy Stan
ford is currently in the process of
forming a working group to devel
op more long-term initiatives, such
as creating a major or even a think
tank to advance the cause of re
ducing inequalities in the political
and economic arenas.
"Occupy Stanford is a lasting
movement," Schott said. "What's
happening now is just the begin
ning."
Occupy Stanford participants
acknowledged that the movement
has received mixed feedback from
the Stanford community.
"I think we haven't been able to
reach out to the Stanford commu
nity," Schott said.

He claimed that the movement
has suffered from both skepticism
that Stanford students could iden
tify with the issues of "the 99 per
cent" and from negative portray
als of Occupy protests by the
media. Schott added that the
movement needs to demonstrate
that Stanford is both affected by
issues affecting the broader world
and will be part of the solution to
those issues.

"I think the people voicing op
position have done so more
strongly," O'Keeffe said. "But
most people recognize that there
are legitimate grievances. There
has been a surprising amount of
backing from the ASSU and the
faculty."
Members were largely opti
mistic about Occupy Stanford's
success thus far.

"I'm prouder to be here after
seeing all the progress we've
made," O'Keeffe said. "I'm hope
ful for the future and sure that [the
movement] will continue to grow."

Occupy the Future
Partially in response to and in
spired by Occupy Stanford, a
coalition of students, staff and fac

ulty developed the Occupy the Fu
ture movement. The initiative,
which will put on a teach-in, rally
and public forum on Friday, Dec. 9,
was developed independently of
Occupy Stanford, but the two
movements share many common
personnel and objectives.
"We see Occupy Stanford as
part of a broader movement," said
Douglas McAdam, professor of
sociology. "We're very sympathet
ic, but we wanted to pursue the
same goals by different means."
Some Occupy Stanford mem
bers expressed concern about Oc
cupy the Future, viewing it as driv
en primarily by the ASSU, faculty
and the University administration,
although most still praised the ini
tiative's concept and willingness to
address real issues.
"I'd like to see them work more
with the students," O'Keeffe said.
"I worry that it's a top-down ap
proach as opposed to the grass
roots approach the rest of the [Oc
cupy] movement has thrived on."
"The University has been
broadly supportive," McAdam
said. "You have to work with a
whole lot of University offices to
gain various permissions, and

everybody's really committed to
ensuring we can put the events we
want on."
Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman described
Occupy the Future as an exclu
sively student-driven initiative.
Occupy the Future organizers
credited Occupy Stanford with
providing the impetus for the Uni
versity community to develop Oc
cupy the Future. Flowever, they
described Occupy the Future as a
more enduring means of advanc
ing the cause of the Occupy move
ment and a potentially more ap
pealing method to the Stanford
community.
"Most of the people within the
Stanford community who I have
talked with have been incredibly
supportive of the Occupy the Fu
ture idea," wrote Haas Center for
Public Service Executive Director
Thomas Schnaubelt in an email to
The Daily. "I wouldn't have gotten
involved in Occupy the Future if I
didn't believe that there is a good
chance for something long-lasting
to come from it."

forming a working group to devel

"Occupy Stanford is a lasting

Occupy Stanford participants
acknowledged that the movement
has received mixed feedback from
the Stanford community.
"I think we haven't been able to

He claimed that the movement
has suffered from both skepticism
that Stanford students could iden

media. Schott added that the
movement needs to demonstrate
that Stanford is both affected by
issues affecting the broader world
and will be part of the solution to
those issues.

"I think the people voicing op

most people recognize that there

Members were largely opti

success thus far.

"I'm prouder to be here after

Occupy the Future
Partially in response to and in
spired by Occupy Stanford, a
coalition of students, staff and fac

ulty developed the Occupy the Fu
ture movement. The initiative,
which will put on a teach-in, rally
and public forum on Friday, Dec. 9,
was developed independently of
Occupy Stanford, but the two
movements share many common
personnel and objectives.
"We see Occupy Stanford as
part of a broader movement," said
Douglas McAdam, professor of
sociology. "We're very sympathet
ic, but we wanted to pursue the
same goals by different means."
Some Occupy Stanford mem
bers expressed concern about Oc
cupy the Future, viewing it as driv
en primarily by the ASSU, faculty
and the University administration,
although most still praised the ini
tiative's concept and willingness to
address real issues.
"I'd like to see them work more
with the students," O'Keeffe said.
"I worry that it's a top-down ap
proach as opposed to the grass
roots approach the rest of the [Oc
cupy] movement has thrived on."
"The University has been
broadly supportive," McAdam
said. "You have to work with a
whole lot of University offices to
gain various permissions, and

everybody's really committed to
ensuring we can put the events we
want on."
Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman described
Occupy the Future as an exclu
sively student-driven initiative.
Occupy the Future organizers
credited Occupy Stanford with
providing the impetus for the Uni
versity community to develop Oc
cupy the Future. Flowever, they
described Occupy the Future as a
more enduring means of advanc
ing the cause of the Occupy move
ment and a potentially more ap
pealing method to the Stanford
community.
"Most of the people within the

More than one month after
the Occupy protests spread to
the West Coast, members of the
Stanford community continue
to be actively involved with the
movement. Students, staff and
faculty have maintained the
"Occupy Stanford" movement
while also developing an "Occu
py the Future" initiative in
hopes of mobilizing the broader
University community.
Both Stanford students and
law enforcement officers from
the University's Department of
Public Safety (SUDPS) have
been extensively involved in
Bay Area Occupy protests.
Stanford sheriffs, along with
Palo Alto PD officers, were dis
patched to assist Oakland PD in
evicting Occupy protestors from
a city encampment on Oct. 25.

The ensuing confrontation re
sulted in the use of riot gear and
less-than-lethal ammunition by
law enforcement, as well as over
100 arrests and critical injuries
to a protesting Iraq War veter
an.

The first Occupy Stanford
general assembly took place on
Oct. 14 in White Plaza. Several
students have made repeated
trips to Bay Area Occupy move
ments, with some present during
the Oct. 25 crackdown in Oak
land and a larger contingent
participating in the successful
takeover of the Oakland city
port on Nov. 2.

Occupy supporters are currently camping out and discussing issues of inequality
around the clock in the 24/7 first-floor study group area of Meyer.

Dan Ashton 'l4 authored a letter
on Nov. 29 to be distributed en
couraging the SUDPS to avoid vi
olence when dispersing protestors
on University grounds and to re
main respectful of student dia
logue.
"Regardless of the causes of
the violence at those schools, pro
tection of student safety is cer
tainly something about which stu
dent government should be pas
sionate," Ashton wrote in an
email to The Daily. "I have no rea
son to believe that Stanford po
lice will react violently to student
protests. Laura Wilson, Chief of
Police, has done a wonderful job
thus far of enabling free assembly,
and I see no reason why that
won't continue,"
Wilson confirmed that the
SUDPS has met internally and
with other University officials to
discuss potential responses to situ
ations involving the Occupy
movements. She added that
SUDPS officers were trained to
use â€”if necessary a level of
force just enough to overcome the
level of resistance, and she noted
that the use of pepper spray on
nonviolent protesters would not
be authorized.
Wilson played down concerns
about the Occupy movement at
Stanford, writing in an email to
The Daily that, "so far, the indi
viduals involved with this move
ment have been respectful of oth
ers and have not interfered with
the academic mission of the insti
tution. My hope is that this com
munity will continue to engage in
intellectual, respectful and
peaceful means of dialogue so
that police intervention is not re
quired."
While acknowledging that
there is currently no consistent
and ongoing dialogue between
SUDPS and students involved in
Occupy Stanford, Wilson noted
that SUDPS and students success
fully communicated in advance of
the anti-police brutality rally that
took place before Big Game.
"Should the need arise, we will
certainly meet with students. If
students want to speak with us
about their plans, we are happy to

meet with them as well," Wilson
wrote.
Occupy Meyer
Occupy Stanford has continued
to protest on campus, most recent
ly establishing a permanent pres
ence in the lobby of Meyer Li
brary. Occupy Meyer, where the
movement has also held General
Assembly meetings, was devel
oped according to participants
as a means of emphasizing
Stanford's ongoing relevance to
the Occupy movement.The move
ment currently mans a table in the
library lobby around the clock.
"The symbolism of occupying
an academic place is important,"
said Zach O'Keeffe 'l3. "We want
to open up a space for intellectual
dialogue, to discuss problems and
solutions in a very academic way.
[At Occupy Meyer] there's the fis
sion of the intellectual and aca
demic with the activist and pro
gressive nature of the Occupy
movement."

O'Keeffe added that the group
chose Meyer instead of Green Li
brary in order to minimize disrup
tion to students. Joshua Schott 'l4
noted that occupying Meyer also
gave the movement the ability to
reach more students in an area
which is heavily trafficked.
Students involved with Occupy
Stanford highlighted other efforts
being undertaken by the move
ment. Current initiatives include
investigating the disbursement of
Stanford's endowment to ensure
that all expenditure is conducted
in a socially responsible manner,
protesting recruitment events for
firms deemed to have acted in a
socially irresponsible manner and
supporting anti-inequality groups
on campus.
Schott said that Occupy Stan
ford is currently in the process of
