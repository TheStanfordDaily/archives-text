## UAL outlines overhaul for academic majors website 
### ALICE PHILLIPS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The office of the Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) hopes to complete a reno
vation of the Undergraduate Acad
emic Life (UAL) website by the
start of the 2012-13 academic year,
VPUE Project Manager Tegan
Bradford said. The renovation will

include the creation of a new web
site for centrally located informa
tion concerning undergraduate
majors.
Bradford set a tentative May
milestone for launching the Ap
proaching Stanford portion of the
UAL site the portion with infor
mation pertinent to incoming
freshmen for the incoming
Class of 2016; but because no ven

dor has been selected, the timeline
is tentative, she said.
The 400-page UAL site was
most recently renovated in 2007.
"We hope that the site will be a
useful advising tool and enable stu
dents to explore and plan their ed
ucations more intentionally," Asso
ciate Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education Sharon Palmer
wrote in an email to The Daily.

VPUE drew inspiration for the
new majors website from a Brown
University site called Focal Point
that aggregates information on
each undergraduate major in an in
teractive display.
The Brown site is an attractive
model because it allows students to
easily navigate between the re
quirements for various majors and
shows the names of advisors and
the career pathways of alumni from
each major, said Tenzin Seldon 'l2.
Seldon is a member of the VPUE
Student Advisory Group and The
Stanford Daily Board of Directors.
"We want to find the means to
be sure that some of the resources
that the [Career Development Cen
ter] offers, for example, are used
and employed," Seldon said. "Cur
rently, a lot of students are not able
to really outreach to the CDC or
only do it later on. Sometimes it's a
little too late."
In order to better accommodate
an interactive, visual display
throughout the UAL site and on the
undergraduate majors site, Brad
ford said VPUE plans to develop a
simpler, more streamlined back
ground in contrast to the current
UAL site's very red template.

One of the main goals of the
UAL site renovation, along with
creating a new hub for undergradu
ate majors, is to restructure the in
formation architecture of the site
from the most recent 2007 renova
tion, Bradford said. She added that
analytics have shown that users are
avoiding the site's navigational
structure by Googling what they
are looking for.
"One of the goals at that time
was to make it accessible for a view
er coming to the site who wasn't fa
miliar with our programs," she said.
"Instead of calling things by pro
gram names Introductory Semi
nars, Introduction to the Humani
ties or Bing Overseas Studies
they rounded them into larger
groupings."
Bradford said she would like the
new design of the UAL site to cut
down on the levels users must click
through to find relevant informa
tion and reorganize page groupings
in an attempt to be more user
friendly.
"We would like to unpack some
of that navigation a little bit and call

some of our programs out by name
to allow students to find them easi
er," Bradford said. "That was one
thing that was a goal in the 2007 ver
sion that I think, with the benefit of
hindsight, might have been a bit of a
miss."
In addition to reorganizing the
site's navigation, VPUE is going to
be able to pull more information
from disparate sources across the
University because the Registrar's
office is now providing departmen
tal information in the form of Dru
pal feeds, Bradford said.
Because students have needs
that span many University divisions
including the CDC, the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs and the
academic departments, the feeds
will allow the UAL site to serve as a
hub for feeds from across depart
ments and offices.
"The more we can collect things
for [our students], provide things
for them, that would be the goal,"
Bradford said. "We'll see how we
do."
Lance Choy, director of the Ca
reer Development Center, wrote

about the relation of choice of
major to potential careers in an
email to The Daily.
"Many students are concerned
about their career plans, and they
often believe that there is a strong
correlation between the major and
a job," Choy said.
"Perhaps for jobs that empha
size technical skills and knowledge
like engineering, the major is
strongly tied to the career field,"
Choy continued. "[But] most busi
ness and public service jobs really
do not focus on the major. Employ
ers tend to think of individuals in
terms of skills, experience and moti
vation."
"We may not be able, because of
time and technical constraints, to
implement all of our ideas in the
first version, but that way we can get
feedback from students after the
initial launch about what works and
what doesn't, and what additional
features they might find useful,"
Palmer said.
