## Winter housing placement rate improves 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
All 275 students returning from over
seas for winter quarter have been as
signed to housing an improvement
over previous years' numerous last
minute assignments.
Because the University offers fewer
study-abroad programs winter quarter,
more students require housing. In order
to deal with the influx of housing appli

cations, Student Housing has opened 114
additional undergraduate spaces 26
in Escondido Village and 88 in Oak
Creek. It leased additional apartments in
Oak Creek and consolidated graduate
students in Escondido Village to create
these spaces.
This year, 40 percent of the students
returning from overseas will be in Es
condido Village or Oak Creek.
"By providing space in Oak Creek
and Escondido Village, we are able to

keep some groups together, which is an
option we were unable to offer in the
past," said Rodger Whitney, executive di
rector of Student Housing, in an email to
The Daily.
At this time last year, over 50 students
with guaranteed housing were still on the
waiting list, compared with 36 this year.
Housing said it expects to assign all stu
dents on the waiting list over winter break.
