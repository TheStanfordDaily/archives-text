## Winter housing placement rate improves 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
All 275 students returning from over
seas for winter quarter have been as
signed to housing an improvement
over previous years' numerous last
minute assignments.
Because the University offers fewer
study-abroad programs winter quarter,
more students require housing. In order
to deal with the influx of housing appli

cations, Student Housing has opened 114
additional undergraduate spaces 26
in Escondido Village and 88 in Oak
Creek. It leased additional apartments in
Oak Creek and consolidated graduate
students in Escondido Village to create
these spaces.
This year, 40 percent of the students
returning from overseas will be in Es
condido Village or Oak Creek.
"By providing space in Oak Creek
and Escondido Village, we are able to

keep some groups together, which is an
option we were unable to offer in the
past," said Rodger Whitney, executive di
rector of Student Housing, in an email to
The Daily.
At this time last year, over 50 students
with guaranteed housing were still on the
waiting list, compared with 36 this year.
Housing said it expects to assign all stu
dents on the waiting list over winter break.

"Each year we receive late can
cellations where these students
can be assigned," Whitney said. "If
everything remains the same as
last year, we will assign the guar
anteed students over winter
break."
There are also 21 students who
are not guaranteed housing and
are still unassigned, compared to
seven last year.
Students returning from
abroad next quarter have, for the
most part, been pleased with
Housing's efforts.
"Overall, the application
process has been quite smooth
and definitely simpler than I ex
pected," said Ruthie Arbeiter 'l2,
who is currently studying abroad
at Oxford. "Housing told us from
the onset that we would find out
our winter quarter housing assign
ments on Nov. 19, so that was nice
that we knew exactly when to ex
pect them. They emailed us the re
sults promptly at midnight on the
19th."
Matei Daian 'l2, currently in
Florence, also found the applica
tion process easy.
"I have a friend who is wait-list
ed and doesn't know yet where he
will live," Daian said. "But he is
confident Stanford will eventually
find him some on-campus hous
ing."
However, there remain kinks in
the system. Jeffrey Gerson 'l2,
currently at Oxford, is seeking re
assignment from west to east cam
pus. While he experienced no
problems with the original appli
cation process, he says that the re
assignment process has been far
less clear.
Gerson had questions about
the reassignment process and was
seeking to speak to a Housing rep

resentative in person. He submit
ted a request through the online
HelpSU system and received a re
sponse from Housing Assignment
Coordinator Mark Young, who,
though he wrote in his email, "If
you have any question, please
don't hesitate to ask," did not pro
vide his email address.
Gerson then turned in his reas
signment form and was sent an au
tomatically generated message
saying Housing would respond to
his request in two business days.
"That was on Nov. 23," Gerson
said. "I've yet to receive a response
or confirmation of having received
my reassignment request."
When asked about Gerson's
situation, Whitney informed The
Daily that Gerson was "welcome
to email housingassignments@
lists.stanford.edu or to email
[Housing Assignments Specialist]
Justin Akers directly."
Gerson, however, was never di
rectly given this information. The
Housing website also does not
have any of the staff's individual
contact information; it only lists
the phone number of the general
Housing Assignments office.
Director of Housing Assign
ments Susan Nunan said she be
lieves that Gerson's case is an
anomaly.
"This is the first complaint I
have received about our use of this
system," she said. "I've double
checked with my Housing Assign
ments staff today, and they have
confirmed that they respond to all
emails, including reassignment re
quests, by telling the student that
they received the request and the
next steps that will occur in the
process."
"If this student did not receive
such a response, it is definitely an
anomaly and not indicative of our
normal customer service standard,"
she said.
