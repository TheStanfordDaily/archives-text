### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Billy Gallagher 
A Stanford contingent, including
President John Hennessy, traveled
to New York City late last week to
interview with NYC officials re
garding Stanford's bid for Applied
Sciences NYC. Stanford spokes
woman Lisa Lapin confirmed the
trip, but declined to comment fur
ther due to the City's request that
participants not discuss their pro
posals or the process until a winner
is selected.
According to the New York Daily
News, two schools have already been
eliminated from the competition.
Cornell University and Stanford
have been discussed as the frontrun
ners by numerous media sources.
Columbia University, New York
University and Carnegie Mellon
University are also in the running.
In a Nov. 29 speech at Massachu
setts Institute of Technology, New
York Mayor Michael Bloomberg
claimed that Stanford and Cornell
are both "desperate."
"Stanford is desperate to do it
I'm not exaggerating," Bloomberg
said, according to the New York
Daily News. "Cornell is desperate to
do it. I'm not exaggerating there."

Dr. Lisa Coico, president of the City
College of New York, was on cam
pus today to meet with Hennessy
and other officials to discuss the re
cent Stanford@CCNY partnership
between the two schools.
This collaboration is not a formal
part of Stanford's NYC proposal,
but the partnership will involve cre
ating a joint-degree program be
tween the institutions if Stanford is
granted a campus on Roosevelt Is
land.
According to Lapin, New York
City has set an internal deadline of
January 15. However, Lapin noted
that a deadline for the public an
nouncement has not been firmly es
tablished.
