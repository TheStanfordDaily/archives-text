21st Century: Encounters, Identity, and Sovereignty in
Contemporary America
MW 1:15-3:05p, 320-106 (Wilcox, M.) 5 units
What does it mean to be a Native American in the 21st
century? Beyond traditional portrayals of military
conquests, cultural collapse, and assimilation, the
relationships between Native Americans and American
society. Focus is on three themes leading to in-class moot
court trials: colonial encounters and colonizing
discourses; frontiers and boundaries; and sovereignty of
self and nation. Topics include gender in native
communities, American Indian law, readings by native
authors, and Indians in film and popular culture.

CHICANST 14N/CSRE 14N/ EDUC 114 N. Growing
Up Bilingual
TTh 10:00a-11:50a, 420-245 (Valdes, G.) 3 units
This course is a Freshman Introductory Seminar
that has as its purpose introducing students to the
sociolinguistic study of bilingualism by focusing on
bilingual communities in this country and on
bilingual individuals who use two languages in
their everyday lives. Much attention is given to the
history, significance, and consequences of
language contact in the United States. The course
focuses on the experiences of long-term US
minority populations as well as that of recent
immigrants.
CHICANST 120/FEMSTI2O/ILAC 287. Queer Raza
MW 11:00am-12:30pm, 240-101
(Yarbro-Bejarano, Y.) 3-5 units
Examination of cultural representations by U.S.
Latin@s that explore the following questions: How
is the mutual constitution of race/sex/class/
gender theorized and represented? How is desire
racialized? How is racial difference produced
through sex acts and what is the function of sex in
racial (self)formation? How to reconcile pleasure
and desire with histories of imperialism and
(neo)colonialism and other structures of power?
How do these texts reinforce or contest
stereotypes and the "ideal" bodies of national
identity? How do these texts produce queerness as
a web of social relations?
CHICANST 160N/ CSRE 160N/ DRAMA 17N. Latino/Latina
Performance in the United States
MW 1:15p-3:15p, ROBLEGI7 (Moraga, C.) 3 units
Preference to freshmen. This course will introduce works by U.S.
Latino and Latina performance artists producing from the margins
of the mainstream Euro-American theater world. We will examine
how performance art serves as a kind of dramatized political forum
for Latino/a artists, producing some of the most transgressive
explorations of queer and national/ethnic identities in the U.S.
today. By the course's conclusion, each student will create and
perform in a staged reading of an original performance piece.
CHICANST 168/ CSRE 168/ FEMST 140H/ ANTHRO 169A. New
Citizenship: Grassroots Movements for Social Justice in the U.S.
F 10:00a-12:50p, MEYER 147 (Coll, K.) 5 units
Focus is on the contributions of immigrants and communities of
color to the meaning of citizenship in the U.S. Citizenship, more
than only a legal status, is a dynamic cultural field in which people
claim equal rights while demanding respect for differences.
Academic studies of citizenship examined in dialogue with the
theory and practice of activists and movements. Engagement with
immigrant organizing and community-based research is a central
emphasis.
CHICANST 200/ CSRE 200/ ILAC 280. Latin@ Literature
W 2:15p-5:05p, 160-839 (Yarbro-Bejarano, Y.) 3-5 units
Texts by U.S. Latin@s of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and
Dominican descent. Examines how these writers' shared history of
Spanish colonization and U.S. imperialism has resulted in differing
representations of home and homeland, nation, diaspora, history,
and memory. Explores how racialization informs the production of
gendered identities as well as sexualities. Analysis of the formal
conventions of fiction, poetry, drama, memoir, and film.

Project
F 10:00a- 12:00p, 500-106 (Voss, B.) 2-5 units

interpretation through a focused study of San Jose's
historic Chinese communities. The course includes
classroom lectures, seminar discussion, laboratory analysis
of historic artifacts, and participation in public
archaeology events. Course themes include immigration,

This course will introduce students to contemporary Asian
American poetry, from the birth of an Asian American
panethnic identity in the 1960s to the present. We will
track shared themes in these works from the relationship
between cultural assimilation and language acquisition,
to representations of feelings of exile and alienation
between "home" and "host" countries. We will read works
by Lawson Inada, Theresa Cha, Marilyn Chin, Li-Young Lee,
John Yau, Myung Mi Kim, and others.

CORE COURSES
CSRE 149/ COMPLIT 149. The Laboring of Diaspora &
Border Literary Cultures
TTh 10:00a-11:50a, 50-518 (Saldivar, J.) 3-5 units
Focus is given to emergent theories of culture and on
comparative literary and cultural studies. How do we
treat culture as a social force? How do we go about
reading the presence of social contexts within cultural
texts? How do ethno-racial writers re-imagine the
nation as a site with many 'cognitive maps* in which the
nation-state is not congruent with cultural identity?
How do diaspora and border narratives/texts strive for
comparative theoretical scope while remaining rooted
in specific local histories.
