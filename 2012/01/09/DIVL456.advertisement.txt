More than 40 years ago, Cirandma gave you
some Series E Savings Bonds. So you put them in
a safe place and forgot about them—until now. You were
cleaning out the basement when you found an unexpected
treasure... those old Series K Savings Bonds. And even though
your old bonds are no longer earning interest, they could still be
worth more than 5 times their face value. So why not redeem those
old bonds at your local financial institution? To find out more, call I-800-4US BOND,
or write to Savings Bonds, I'arkersburg, WV 26106 828. Old Savings Bonds.
They're a treasure worth
