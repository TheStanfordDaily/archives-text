Lead paint poisoning affects
over one million children today.
Learning disabilities, hearing loss, speech delays, violent behavior
and, in rare cases, seizures and even death: these are just some
of the effects lead paint poisoning has on young children. If your
home was built before 1978, lead paint on your walls, doors,
windows and sills may be dangerous. And it's not just large paint
chips that can cause damage. In fact, three granules of lead dust
are enough to poison your child. Let's make all kids lead-free kids.
