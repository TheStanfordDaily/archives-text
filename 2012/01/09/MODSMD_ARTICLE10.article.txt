## TREND Forefathers of footbag PROFILE 
### ALYA NAQVI 
Passing through White Plaza on a
Tuesday afternoon, you are likely
to spot a couple of guys playing
hacky sack to dance music on the
stage of the small amphitheater.
You might assume that these men are pursu
ing a casual hobby or simply messing around
between classes. The thought that they are
practicing a serious aerobic sport would
probably never cross your mind.
"Footbag," commonly referred to as
"hacky sack," is a more than 30-year-old
competitive sport, according to Steve Gold
berg M.S. 'BB, the club's organizer. Over 350
clubs across the world are registered with
the International Footbag Players' Associa
tion (IPFA), which Goldberg co-founded
(its website's main server is run from his
house).
Although the Stanford Footbag Club is
affiliated with Stanford University and plays
on campus, only a few players are actually

Stanford students or alumni. Moreover,
Goldberg, an engineering manager at
Google, sponsors most of the club's activi
ties; the University does not provide any
funding.
Despite the University's lack of involve
ment, Goldberg maintained that footbag is
still a Stanford institution. He said that the
Stanford club, which was founded on cam
pus in 1989, is the longest-running footbag
club in the entire world. Moreover, the club
has hosted the Western Regional Footbag
Championships 10 times in the organiza
tion's 22-year history.
At practice in White Plaza, Goldberg ges
tured to the four players around him.
"These are some of the top players in the
world, by the way," he said.
Alex Dworetzky, a 20-year-old Belmont
resident, has been in the club since 2007. He
has participated in a number of tourna
ments, including the 2009 and 2011 IFPA
World Footbag Championships in Prague
and Helsinki, respectively. Despite Dworet
zky's dedication to the sport, he was quick to
note that this is only an after-work pastime,
not his primary occupation.

Brian Sherrill, another frequent footbag
ger, is a 25-year-old Bay Area resident who
also competed in Helsinki as well as many
other footbagging events in the United
States. Sherrill is one of the world's best
"stitchers," according to Goldberg, meaning
that he makes and sells high-quality foot
bags for players around the world.
The club is open to players of all skill lev
els.
And if they don't know how to footbag?
"We can teach them to play," Sherrill said
with a grin.
Amotz Ziv Av, a native Israeli and post
doctoral scholar at the School of Medicine,
joined only recently and is still learning all
the basics.

In addition to novices, the Stanford
Footbag Club attracts professionals from
across the world, including Kim Mortensen
of Denmark. Mortensen, another postdoc
toral scholar at the School of Medicine, is
one of the best freestyle footbag players
from Copenhagen, Goldberg said. Al
though there are other players who join
pick-up games every now and again, Gold
berg said that these four athletes were the

most regular.
The footbaggers prepare for competi
tions "sort of like how break dancers prac
tice," Goldberg said. "We go in a circle, and
each person does as many tricks as they can
without dropping the footbag. When they
drop it, they pass it to the next player."
In a competition, the players choreo
graph two-minute routines to music. They
perform these routines in front of a panel of
judges, trying to link together as many tricks
as possible.
Although the Stanford club specializes in
freestyle footbag, other clubs in the area play
another style of footbag, called "footbag
net." Unlike freestyle footbag, which show
cases an individual player's skill, footbag net
is played by kicking a footbag over a five
foot tall net, and is very much a team sport.
"Players spike the footbag," Goldberg
said. "It's like volleyball with your feet."
No matter the style, Goldberg and his
group hope that the up-and-coming sport
will continue to grow in popularity, not just
on Stanford's campus but across the world.

resident, has been in the club since 2007. He
has participated in a number of tourna
ments, including the 2009 and 2011 IFPA
World Footbag Championships in Prague
and Helsinki, respectively. Despite Dworet
zky's dedication to the sport, he was quick to
note that this is only an after-work pastime,
not his primary occupation.

Brian Sherrill, another frequent footbag
ger, is a 25-year-old Bay Area resident who
also competed in Helsinki as well as many
other footbagging events in the United
States. Sherrill is one of the world's best
"stitchers," according to Goldberg, meaning
that he makes and sells high-quality foot
bags for players around the world.
The club is open to players of all skill lev
els.
And if they don't know how to footbag?
"We can teach them to play," Sherrill said
with a grin.
Amotz Ziv Av, a native Israeli and post
doctoral scholar at the School of Medicine,
joined only recently and is still learning all
the basics.

In addition to novices, the Stanford
Footbag Club attracts professionals from
across the world, including Kim Mortensen
of Denmark. Mortensen, another postdoc
toral scholar at the School of Medicine, is
one of the best freestyle footbag players
from Copenhagen, Goldberg said. Al
though there are other players who join
pick-up games every now and again, Gold
berg said that these four athletes were the

most regular.
The footbaggers prepare for competi
tions "sort of like how break dancers prac
tice," Goldberg said. "We go in a circle, and
each person does as many tricks as they can
without dropping the footbag. When they
drop it, they pass it to the next player."
In a competition, the players choreo
graph two-minute routines to music. They
perform these routines in front of a panel of
judges, trying to link together as many tricks
as possible.
Although the Stanford club specializes in
freestyle footbag, other clubs in the area play
another style of footbag, called "footbag
net." Unlike freestyle footbag, which show
cases an individual player's skill, footbag net
is played by kicking a footbag over a five
foot tall net, and is very much a team sport.
"Players spike the footbag," Goldberg
said. "It's like volleyball with your feet."
No matter the style, Goldberg and his
group hope that the up-and-coming sport
will continue to grow in popularity, not just
on Stanford's campus but across the world.
