## Rebuilding Thailand from overseas 
### LESLIE NGUYEN-OKWU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Before gushing monsoon rains
drenched Fern Kundhikanjana's
home in Thailand, Chinese char
acters were hung above the door
way. Her aunt hoped they would
ward off the floods. But Kundhikanjana
knew these efforts were vain. To her, it was
all "superstition."

As a sixth-year graduate student in ap
plied physics, Kundhikanjana M.S. 'O9,
Ph.D. 'l2 has lived in the United States for
the last 10 years but still holds close ties to
her homeland now more than ever.

Last year, Thailand's flood season
brought with it waters as high as 10 feet in
some areas, the worst in 50 years. Plunging
more than one-third of the country under
water, the floods wreaked havoc on Thai
land's crops, factories and capital city of
Bangkok. The floods left thousands of peo
ple without homes, food or clean water and
killed 780 people.

Though Thailand has experienced
floods before, few were as severe as the
walls of water that swept through the home
of Perth Charernwattanagul 'l4, another
native of Thailand.

"My parents' factory and house in the
suburbs were severely damaged to the
point that relocation was the only solu
tion," he said. "My parents are struggling to
restart production. Transportation now re
quires a lot of [the] budget, and many roads

Within two weeks, the THAIS club raised
thousands of dollars both through their online
and offline efforts...

are virtually inaccessible."
Before the flooding, his parents man
aged one of four factories that produced
hemodialysis solution in Bangkok. The so
lution helps treat people with kidney dis
ease, who often use it on a weekly basis.
Now, with all but one factory flooded, in
cluding his parents', Bangkok hospitals are
in short supply.

Charernwattanagul is also worried
about his friends and other family back
home. He speaks to his boyfriend frequent
ly, whose house is located in an area at high
risk for flooding. Though he communicates
with him and his parents everyday, he is un
easy about being so far away.
"I feel really weird being here in this
kind of situation and not doing anything,"
Charernwattanagul said. "This is the first
time that I felt this kind of conflict, sort of
like 'Do I really belong here?' I feel really

connected to [Thailand], and I feel like my
life here doesn't really matter that much."
Soon after hearing about the floods, he
quickly got involved in flood-relief efforts
at Stanford. Charernwattanagul is one of
about 80 members in the THAIS Club, a
community of Stanford undergraduate and
graduate students from Thailand. They
quickly rallied around the cause, raising
funds and awareness for flood victims
through a campaign called "Dry Thailand."
For several days in October and Novem
ber, members of the THAIS Club stood in
White Plaza and gave out boba tea to pro
mote their "Thai F(l)ood Fest."
Within two weeks, the THAIS club raised
thousands of dollars through both their on
line and offline efforts, and they successfully
donated their proceeds to Baan Arsa Jaidee,
an organization that provides ongoing reha
bilitation and relief for Thailand.

"We made about $4,500, which exceed
ed our expectations," said Prae Num
swangneth 'l3, the THAIS Club's under
graduate co-president.
"If you think about it, a dollar or $2 can
basically buy a meal for people in Thai
land," said THAIS graduate co-president
Werapong Goo M.S. 'l5. "By donating $5,
you could buy meals for a day for a family
of three or four. It helps a lot, even though
$5 isn't much for us."
Goo was most struck by the kindness of
the passersby who stopped at their tables to
chat and learn more about Thailand.
"I was just surprised by their generosity
even though they might not have had any
interactions with Thailand or Thai people
before," Goo said. "Some people just saw
our poster that we put on our tables and
came without asking for any free drink or
free food. They asked, 'Oh, can I just give
you money?' But we couldn't take it with
out giving them food."
Like many other members of the
THAIS Club, Goo was humbled by the ex
perience.
"We are a group of people who are
lucky enough to be at this great university,"
Goo said. "We always want to help other
people. That's something that I learned
from Stanford. I feel like Stanford has
taught us to reach out and pay back the
community."

"If you think about it, a dollar or $2 can
basically buy a meal for people in Thai
land," said THAIS graduate co-president
Werapong Goo M.S. 'l5. "By donating $5,
you could buy meals for a day for a family
of three or four. It helps a lot, even though
$5 isn't much for us."
Goo was most struck by the kindness of
the passersby who stopped at their tables to
chat and learn more about Thailand.
"I was just surprised by their generosity
even though they might not have had any
interactions with Thailand or Thai people
before," Goo said. "Some people just saw
our poster that we put on our tables and
came without asking for any free drink or
free food. They asked, 'Oh, can I just give
you money?' But we couldn't take it with
out giving them food."
Like many other members of the
THAIS Club, Goo was humbled by the ex
perience.
"We are a group of people who are
lucky enough to be at this great university,"
Goo said. "We always want to help other
people. That's something that I learned
from Stanford. I feel like Stanford has
taught us to reach out and pay back the
community."

Before gushing monsoon rains
drenched Fern Kundhikanjana's
home in Thailand, Chinese char
acters were hung above the door
way. Her aunt hoped they would
ward off the floods. But Kundhikanjana
knew these efforts were vain. To her, it was
all "superstition."

As a sixth-year graduate student in ap
plied physics, Kundhikanjana M.S. 'O9,
Ph.D. 'l2 has lived in the United States for
the last 10 years but still holds close ties to
her homeland now more than ever.

Last year, Thailand's flood season
brought with it waters as high as 10 feet in
some areas, the worst in 50 years. Plunging
more than one-third of the country under
water, the floods wreaked havoc on Thai
land's crops, factories and capital city of
Bangkok. The floods left thousands of peo
ple without homes, food or clean water and
killed 780 people.

Though Thailand has experienced
floods before, few were as severe as the
walls of water that swept through the home
of Perth Charernwattanagul 'l4, another
native of Thailand.

"My parents' factory and house in the
suburbs were severely damaged to the
point that relocation was the only solu
tion," he said. "My parents are struggling to
restart production. Transportation now re
quires a lot of [the] budget, and many roads

are virtually inaccessible."
Before the flooding, his parents man
aged one of four factories that produced
hemodialysis solution in Bangkok. The so
lution helps treat people with kidney dis
ease, who often use it on a weekly basis.
Now, with all but one factory flooded, in
cluding his parents', Bangkok hospitals are
in short supply.

Charernwattanagul is also worried
about his friends and other family back
home. He speaks to his boyfriend frequent
ly, whose house is located in an area at high
risk for flooding. Though he communicates
with him and his parents everyday, he is un
easy about being so far away.
"I feel really weird being here in this
kind of situation and not doing anything,"
Charernwattanagul said. "This is the first
time that I felt this kind of conflict, sort of
like 'Do I really belong here?' I feel really

connected to [Thailand], and I feel like my
life here doesn't really matter that much."
Soon after hearing about the floods, he
quickly got involved in flood-relief efforts
at Stanford. Charernwattanagul is one of
about 80 members in the THAIS Club, a
community of Stanford undergraduate and
graduate students from Thailand. They
quickly rallied around the cause, raising
funds and awareness for flood victims
through a campaign called "Dry Thailand."
For several days in October and Novem
ber, members of the THAIS Club stood in
White Plaza and gave out boba tea to pro
mote their "Thai F(l)ood Fest."
Within two weeks, the THAIS club raised
thousands of dollars through both their on
line and offline efforts, and they successfully
donated their proceeds to Baan Arsa Jaidee,
an organization that provides ongoing reha
bilitation and relief for Thailand.

"We made about $4,500, which exceed
ed our expectations," said Prae Num
swangneth 'l3, the THAIS Club's under
graduate co-president.
