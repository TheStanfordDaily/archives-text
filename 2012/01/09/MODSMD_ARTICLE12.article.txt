## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN On the new relativism 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Last spring, in one of the best
courses I've ever taken at
Stanford, our ethics in socie
ty professor asked the class what
we thought about female genital
mutilation, or FGM.
He didn't sugarcoat it for us. He
explained that FGM, which is
practiced worldwide but is most
prevalent in northeastern Africa,
involves the forcible excision of
the external female genitalia, most
commonly the clitoris; that it is
generally performed on infants,
without anesthesia, with scissors
or unsanitized knives; and that its
purpose is often to inhibit or re
strain the woman's sexual desire
later in life, or to keep her "pure"
for her future husband. Unsurpris
ingly, he continued, FGM fre
quently leads to sexual dysfunc
tion and disease, and complica
tions can range from painful infec
tion to death.
Our professor then asked us
what we thought about the moral
ity of FGM whether we consid
ered the practice right, wrong or
something in between. A student
sitting near the front raised her
hand. "Oh, I'm a total relativist,"
she said brightly. "If that's just
what they do there, then I'm com
pletely fine with it."
Relativism, roughly speaking,
is the idea that what's ethically
wrong in one place, in one culture
or in one era may be ethically right
or permissible in another, and that
we therefore ought to refrain from
criticizing objectionable practices
that occur outside our nation, our
culture or our time period. Some
times relativism is precise and
philosophical, flowing from deep
and thoughtful moral convictions
about cultural sovereignty or
group rights. More often, it springs
from the rudimentary idea that
everyone ought to "mind his own
business" and direct his moral en
ergies toward solving his own
problems rather than those of oth
ers. Occasionally, it simply flows
from a reflexive inability to criti
cize the paralyzing illness of
the chronically kind.
But wherever the new rela
tivism comes from, however popu
lar it becomes and whatever it
might look like, I stand as opposed
as I did that day in class last spring.
I believe this for many reasons.
The first and most general of these
is that relativism is too often racist.
Take the popular relativist argu
ment that certain groups and peo
ples say, the Chinese are
unfit for democratic government
and that we therefore ought to ab
stain from advocating that it be
given to them. The idea seems to
be that Chinese people are geneti
cally unable to think or vote for
themselves or that Chinese cul
ture is inherently autocratic and
tyrannical. Either way, it's an in
sulting argument, whether it is ap
plied to the Chinese or the Irani
ans or the Zimbabweans. (Besides
being racist, it also makes very lit
tle sense: one wonders why, if the

Chinese so truly dislike democra
cy, Beijing is so afraid to let them
say so at the ballot box.) It con
signs those who look and act and
speak differently to a sphere of
lesser moral worth, less deserving
of attention and thought than peo
ple like "us." It says that other peo
ples do not have the same basic as
pirations, basic needs for respect
or basic humanity that "we" do.
Relativism also has a short
memory. Its modern adherents
seem to forget too easily, for in
stance, that their "leave us alone"
and "mind your own business" ar
guments were once used to defend
slavery.
Relativists often urge that we
embrace cultural or national rela
tivism because its alternative is
Western imperialist military inter
vention. But this is simply poor
reasoning. One may criticize a
practice without advocating that
force be used to stop it; a doctor
may seek to cure a disease without
prescribing toxic chemotherapy
that kills the patient.
Lastly and most strongly, I op
pose relativism because it acts as a
sort of morphine for the pain cen
ters of the moral mind a tran
quilizing drug to dull the senses
and induce an anodyne ethical tor
por. I worry about how effective a
painkiller it is when administered
to liberals, once the most ardent
defenders of individual freedom.
Feminists who (quite rightly)
throw a fit when American
women are paid 70 cents for every
dollar earned by men fall embar
rassingly silent when confronted
with the predicament of Saudi
women being forbidden to drive.
Civil libertarians who (quite right
ly) rail against religious influence
in government meet the Iranian
theocracy with a halfhearted
shrug. LGBT advocates for mar
riage equality at home politely re
frain from criticizing the stoning of
homosexuals abroad. Liberals
seem willing to drop our liberal
ism at any international airport,
thrown in the trash along with the
detritus from our pockets and any
carry-on liquids weighing more
than 3 ounces.
It may be argued that this is
only an appropriate tolerance
and respect for competing ideas
about what is right and just. If that
is the case, then I am happy to be
called intolerant and disrespect
ful; of tyranny, of theocracy, of
gender inequality and of every
thing else I think it important to
fight against, both at home and
abroad.
