# FRESHMAN '15
## Resolve to quit New Year's resolutions 
### Bianca Chavez 
There are two types of people
in this world: those who
make New Year's resolu
tions and those who hate all the
damn idiots making New Year's
resolutions

Take a wild guess which kind of
person I am.
It's not that I have any problem
with the concept of a resolution; I
think an active attempt to better
oneself is a totally worthwhile
goal. In fact, I think setting goals is
the only way a person can hope to
improve his lot in life (excluding an
incredible stroke of luck like win
ning the lottery or finding a pot o'
gold at the end of a rainbow. But I
wouldn't sit around waiting for
that to happen, because unless
you're a wee little Irish elf, the clos
est you'll ever get to a pot o' gold
are probably those little green
marshmallows in Lucky Charms.
And do you know what the odds of
winning the lottery are? You'd
probably be better off attempting
to shrink 5 feet and learning to say,
"They're magically delicious!" in
an Irish accent.)
So if self-improvement is a per
fectly noble goal, what's the mat
ter with New Year's resolutions?
In a word: everything.
First, let's take a moment to ex
amine the types of resolutions
people are making. At every New
Year's Eve party, there is at least
one woman who vows to lose
weight in the coming year (before

inhaling half a tray of artisan
cheese and crackers) and at least
one guy who loudly promises to
quit smoking (before excusing
himself to go outside and burn
one last cancer stick just to, you
know, celebrate the New Year).
My problem with resolutions

like this? They're too vague,
which makes them all too easy to
put off. Sure, you'll intend to start
your diet on January 1, but when
that morning comes around, will
you really be disciplined enough
to walk past all the holiday treats
that are likely still sitting on your
kitchen counter and reach for an
apple instead? Or will you just tell
yourself, "I really meant to start
dieting on January 2, after the last
of these Christmas cookies are
gone"?
Unless resolutions come with a
concrete goal and an ending date,
(example: "I will lose 20 pounds
by March 15" instead of "I will
lose weight"), they're likely to fail
and quickly. Sure enough, be
fore the end of January, loads of
people are ready to give up on the
goals that they set with the best in
tentions only a few weeks earlier.
And the majority of them will give
themselves pats on the back for at
least trying to improve their lives
and vow to do better next year.
But why give up on 2012 com
pletely before January is even
over? If you genuinely want to im
prove your life, there's no need to
wait until the start of a new calen
dar. Any day can be the beginning
of a new year and a new you.

tion? Email Bianca at blchavez@

sure you keep it.

So if self-improve
ment is a perfectly
noble goal, what's the
matter with New
Years resolutions? In a
word: everything.
