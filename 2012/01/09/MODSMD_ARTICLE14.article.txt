## HEARTS BROKEN CARD LOSES FIESTA BOWL AFTER LATE FG MISS 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
It was going to be perfect.
Tied 38-38 with Oklahoma
State, a flawless two-minute drill
from Andrew Luck in the final
game of his college career set up a
35-yard field-goal attempt with
three seconds left to win the Fiesta
Bowl. All it would take was redshirt
freshman kicker Jordan
Williamson to seal the storybook
ending for Luck and the Stanford
football team.

It was going to be perfect.
But Williamson's kick from
the middle of the field, with no
wind and the half-orange, half-red
student sections setting the back
drop twisted wide left.
Moments later in overtime,
after another missed field goal
from Williamson, Cowboy kicker
Quinn Sharp put home a 22-yard
field goal to give Oklahoma State
the 41-38 win in one of the most
thrilling and heartbreaking
bowl games of the season.
The No. 4 Cardinal (11-2, 8-1
Pac-12) pushed back and forth with
the No. 3 Cowboys (12-1, 8-1 Big
12) all night long, with the two ex
plosive offenses combining for
over 1,000 total yards and 79 points.
But even with a near-perfect day
from Luck in his swan song for the
Cardinal he completed 27 of his
31 passes for 347 yards, two touch
downs and an interception it

still wasn't enough.
"We didn't finish, and that's not
just the kick at the end," said head
coach David Shaw. "We didn't fin
ish the game, the game that we're
capable of."
"I play football to win," Luck
said. "I think everybody up here
will say the same thing. Yeah, I'm
sure I'll watch the film and see
where I can get better or see what I
did well. But at the end of the day,
we lost. I'm as much to blame as the
next guy."
Certainly, Luck and the of
fense's stats suggested otherwise,
with Stanford totaling 590 total
yards of offense as Luck's near-per
fect day was complemented by 177
yards rushing and two touchdowns
from junior running back Stepfan
Taylor as well as 120 yards receiv
ing and a touchdown from fresh
man wideout Ty Montgomery.
However, against an Oklahoma
State team that got dominant of
fensive performances from quar
terback Brandon Weeden, who was
29-of-42 for 399 yards and three
touchdowns, and receiver Justin
Blackmon, who had 186 yards and
three touchdowns, Shaw took care
to point out that the loss could not
be placed on Williamson's shoul
ders in a game that was an offensive
shootout.

"Offensively, we talk about it all
time: we cannot settle for field
goals against a good football
team," Shaw said. "Whether you
make them or you miss them,
against a good team, it is inconse
quential. Good teams score touch
downs. If you kick the field goal,
now you are back behind the eight
ball."

While the Fiesta Bowl did even
tually live up to all of its hype, as it
was expected to be a duel between
two of the most complete and dan
gerous offenses in the nation, the
first few minutes of the game were
surprisingly highlighted by solid
defense, as both the Cowboys and
the Cardinal couldn't muster any
points in the first 10 minutes of
play.
After a 41-yard field goal at
tempt from Williamson sailed wide
left on the Cardinal's first drive of
the game, junior cornerback Ter
rence Brown intercepted the first
pass of the night from Weeden to
give Stanford a chance at redemp
tion and a short field. However,
Oklahoma State sacked Luck on
third down and put the Cardinal
out of field-goal range.
After trading punts, Luck final
ly put the Cardinal on the board
when he faked a handoff, stepped
back and hit Montgomery, who
streaked past the Cowboy defense
for a 53-yard touchdown and a 7-0
lead with 4:16 left in the first quar
ter.
After the next three series a
rare Luck interception bookended

by two Cowboy punts the game
took on a new complexion: offense
on, defense off.
On the Cardinal's ensuing drive,
it was all Jeremy Stewart, as the
senior running back got the Cardi
nal into Cowboy territory with a
34-yard run, then capped off the
seven-play, 87-yard drive with a 24-
yard touchdown run to make it 14-
0.
Oklahoma State, which had
been outgained by a margin of 221
yards to just 27, responded by feed
ing Blackmon, who hauled in a 43-
yard touchdown pass, then, just
moments later, shucked Brown off
his back and outran the rest of the
defense for a 67-yard touchdown to
tie the game at 14.
Stanford and Oklahoma State
then traded brisk scoring drives be
fore the half to send the game to
halftime tied at 21.
The Cardinal came out of the
locker room in ideal fashion, sack
ing Weeden on third down to end
the Cowboys' first drive, then plod
ding down the field before Luck hit
redshirt sophomore tight end Zach
Ertz for a 16-yard touchdown that
gave Stanford the lead once again,

28-21.
The teams traded field goals to
make the score 31-24, but it was
only a matter of time before Black
mon struck again. After gaining
just 15 yards in the third quarter,
the two-time Biletnikoff Award
winner tied a Fiesta Bowl record
with his third touchdown catch of
the night to tie the score at 31 with
11:53 to go.
Needing a critical drive, the Car
dinal reeled off a 13-play touch
down drive that took seven min
utes and 21 seconds off the clock,
ending with a Taylor touchdown to
make the score 38-31. The touch
down put the ball back in the hands
of the Oklahoma State offense
with 4:26 left in the game.
That was far more than the
Cowboys needed, as Weeden
whisked the offense down the field
in less than two minutes to tie the
score at 38.
With 2:35 left on the clock and
the ball on his own 20, the game
was now Luck's to win.
Luck completed all five of his
passes for 50 yards, and Taylor

Junior running back Stepfan Taylor (33) had a career day against Oklahoma State, as he rushed 35 times for
177 yards, both career highs. In all, the Stanford running game outrushed the Cowboys 243-13 and the Cardinal
had a 178-yard advantage overall, but rare special teams and red zone miscues cost Stanford the game.
added three runs for 13 yards to set
up the game-winning field-goal at
tempt.
But it just wasn't to be. Even
with the dramatic setup in the final
game of a superstar's career.
"Obviously it didn't work out,"
Luck said. "It's no one person's
fault. There's so many opportuni
ties throughout the course of the
game to change it, and we had the
chance to stick the dagger in them
[at the end of regulation], and we
didn't do that."
For the program-changing re
cruiting class of 2008, which in
cludes the NFL-bound Luck, the
rare defeat comes as a sour ending

to a four-year career that saw the
Cardinal program reach unprece
dented heights and notch a 23-3
record in the last two seasons.
"It's hard to reconcile a loss in
the last game of the year," Luck
said. "But I'm so proud to be able to
represent Stanford, so ever grateful
to be a part of this locker room, and
I'll miss these guys dearly."
Despite his excellence in the Fi
esta Bowl and in 2011, Luck de
parts the program like a hero from
an Ernest Hemingway novel
with the final moments of the story
leaving an unsatisfying conclusion
to a dedicated, brilliant effort a
fact he was acutely aware of.
"It's a game of football," he
said. "I don't believe in fairy tales
any more now that I'm older."

It was going to be perfect.
Tied 38-38 with Oklahoma
State, a flawless two-minute drill
from Andrew Luck in the final
game of his college career set up a
35-yard field-goal attempt with
three seconds left to win the Fiesta
Bowl. All it would take was redshirt
freshman kicker Jordan
Williamson to seal the storybook
ending for Luck and the Stanford
football team.

It was going to be perfect.
But Williamson's kick from
the middle of the field, with no
wind and the half-orange, half-red
student sections setting the back
drop twisted wide left.
Moments later in overtime,
after another missed field goal
from Williamson, Cowboy kicker
Quinn Sharp put home a 22-yard
field goal to give Oklahoma State
the 41-38 win in one of the most
thrilling and heartbreaking
bowl games of the season.
The No. 4 Cardinal (11-2, 8-1
Pac-12) pushed back and forth with
the No. 3 Cowboys (12-1, 8-1 Big
12) all night long, with the two ex
plosive offenses combining for
over 1,000 total yards and 79 points.
But even with a near-perfect day
from Luck in his swan song for the
Cardinal he completed 27 of his
31 passes for 347 yards, two touch
downs and an interception it

still wasn't enough.
"We didn't finish, and that's not
just the kick at the end," said head
coach David Shaw. "We didn't fin
ish the game, the game that we're
capable of."
"I play football to win," Luck
said. "I think everybody up here
will say the same thing. Yeah, I'm
sure I'll watch the film and see
where I can get better or see what I
did well. But at the end of the day,
we lost. I'm as much to blame as the
next guy."
Certainly, Luck and the of
fense's stats suggested otherwise,
with Stanford totaling 590 total
yards of offense as Luck's near-per
fect day was complemented by 177
yards rushing and two touchdowns
from junior running back Stepfan
Taylor as well as 120 yards receiv
ing and a touchdown from fresh
man wideout Ty Montgomery.
However, against an Oklahoma
State team that got dominant of
fensive performances from quar
terback Brandon Weeden, who was
29-of-42 for 399 yards and three
touchdowns, and receiver Justin
Blackmon, who had 186 yards and
three touchdowns, Shaw took care
to point out that the loss could not
be placed on Williamson's shoul
ders in a game that was an offensive
shootout.

"Offensively, we talk about it all
time: we cannot settle for field
goals against a good football
team," Shaw said. "Whether you
make them or you miss them,
against a good team, it is inconse
quential. Good teams score touch
downs. If you kick the field goal,
now you are back behind the eight
ball."

While the Fiesta Bowl did even
tually live up to all of its hype, as it
was expected to be a duel between
two of the most complete and dan
gerous offenses in the nation, the
first few minutes of the game were
surprisingly highlighted by solid
defense, as both the Cowboys and
the Cardinal couldn't muster any
points in the first 10 minutes of
play.
After a 41-yard field goal at
tempt from Williamson sailed wide
left on the Cardinal's first drive of
the game, junior cornerback Ter
rence Brown intercepted the first
pass of the night from Weeden to
give Stanford a chance at redemp
tion and a short field. However,
Oklahoma State sacked Luck on
third down and put the Cardinal
out of field-goal range.
After trading punts, Luck final
ly put the Cardinal on the board
when he faked a handoff, stepped
back and hit Montgomery, who
streaked past the Cowboy defense
for a 53-yard touchdown and a 7-0
lead with 4:16 left in the first quar
ter.
After the next three series a
rare Luck interception bookended

by two Cowboy punts the game
took on a new complexion: offense
on, defense off.
On the Cardinal's ensuing drive,
it was all Jeremy Stewart, as the
senior running back got the Cardi
nal into Cowboy territory with a
34-yard run, then capped off the
seven-play, 87-yard drive with a 24-
yard touchdown run to make it 14-
0.
Oklahoma State, which had
been outgained by a margin of 221
yards to just 27, responded by feed
ing Blackmon, who hauled in a 43-
yard touchdown pass, then, just
moments later, shucked Brown off
his back and outran the rest of the
defense for a 67-yard touchdown to
tie the game at 14.
Stanford and Oklahoma State
then traded brisk scoring drives be
fore the half to send the game to
halftime tied at 21.
The Cardinal came out of the
locker room in ideal fashion, sack
ing Weeden on third down to end
the Cowboys' first drive, then plod
ding down the field before Luck hit

"I play football to win," Luck
said. "I think everybody up here
will say the same thing. Yeah, I'm
sure I'll watch the film and see
where I can get better or see what I
did well. But at the end of the day,
we lost. I'm as much to blame as the
next guy."
Certainly, Luck and the of
fense's stats suggested otherwise,
with Stanford totaling 590 total
yards of offense as Luck's near-per
fect day was complemented by 177
yards rushing and two touchdowns
from junior running back Stepfan
Taylor as well as 120 yards receiv
ing and a touchdown from fresh
man wideout Ty Montgomery.
However, against an Oklahoma
State team that got dominant of
fensive performances from quar
terback Brandon Weeden, who was
29-of-42 for 399 yards and three
touchdowns, and receiver Justin
Blackmon, who had 186 yards and
three touchdowns, Shaw took care
to point out that the loss could not
be placed on Williamson's shoul
ders in a game that was an offensive
shootout.

"Offensively, we talk about it all
time: we cannot settle for field
goals against a good football
team," Shaw said. "Whether you
make them or you miss them,
against a good team, it is inconse
quential. Good teams score touch
downs. If you kick the field goal,
now you are back behind the eight
ball."

While the Fiesta Bowl did even
tually live up to all of its hype, as it
was expected to be a duel between
two of the most complete and dan
gerous offenses in the nation, the
first few minutes of the game were
surprisingly highlighted by solid
defense, as both the Cowboys and
the Cardinal couldn't muster any
points in the first 10 minutes of
play.
After a 41-yard field goal at
tempt from Williamson sailed wide
left on the Cardinal's first drive of
the game, junior cornerback Ter
rence Brown intercepted the first
pass of the night from Weeden to
give Stanford a chance at redemp
tion and a short field. However,
Oklahoma State sacked Luck on
third down and put the Cardinal
out of field-goal range.
After trading punts, Luck final
ly put the Cardinal on the board
when he faked a handoff, stepped
back and hit Montgomery, who
streaked past the Cowboy defense
for a 53-yard touchdown and a 7-0
lead with 4:16 left in the first quar
ter.
After the next three series a
rare Luck interception bookended

by two Cowboy punts the game
took on a new complexion: offense
on, defense off.
On the Cardinal's ensuing drive,
it was all Jeremy Stewart, as the
senior running back got the Cardi
nal into Cowboy territory with a
34-yard run, then capped off the
seven-play, 87-yard drive with a 24-
yard touchdown run to make it 14-
0.
Oklahoma State, which had
been outgained by a margin of 221
yards to just 27, responded by feed
ing Blackmon, who hauled in a 43-
yard touchdown pass, then, just
moments later, shucked Brown off
his back and outran the rest of the
defense for a 67-yard touchdown to
tie the game at 14.
Stanford and Oklahoma State
then traded brisk scoring drives be
fore the half to send the game to
halftime tied at 21.
The Cardinal came out of the
locker room in ideal fashion, sack
ing Weeden on third down to end
the Cowboys' first drive, then plod
ding down the field before Luck hit
redshirt sophomore tight end Zach
Ertz for a 16-yard touchdown that
gave Stanford the lead once again,

28-21.
The teams traded field goals to
make the score 31-24, but it was
only a matter of time before Black
mon struck again. After gaining
just 15 yards in the third quarter,
the two-time Biletnikoff Award
winner tied a Fiesta Bowl record
with his third touchdown catch of
the night to tie the score at 31 with
11:53 to go.
Needing a critical drive, the Car
dinal reeled off a 13-play touch
down drive that took seven min
utes and 21 seconds off the clock,
ending with a Taylor touchdown to
make the score 38-31. The touch
down put the ball back in the hands
of the Oklahoma State offense
with 4:26 left in the game.
That was far more than the
Cowboys needed, as Weeden
whisked the offense down the field
in less than two minutes to tie the
score at 38.
With 2:35 left on the clock and
the ball on his own 20, the game
was now Luck's to win.
Luck completed all five of his
passes for 50 yards, and Taylor

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Junior running back Stepfan Taylor (33) had a career day against Oklahoma State, as he rushed 35 times for
177 yards, both career highs. In all, the Stanford running game outrushed the Cowboys 243-13 and the Cardinal
had a 178-yard advantage overall, but rare special teams and red zone miscues cost Stanford the game.
added three runs for 13 yards to set
up the game-winning field-goal at
tempt.
But it just wasn't to be. Even
with the dramatic setup in the final
game of a superstar's career.
"Obviously it didn't work out,"
Luck said. "It's no one person's
fault. There's so many opportuni
ties throughout the course of the
game to change it, and we had the
chance to stick the dagger in them
[at the end of regulation], and we
didn't do that."
For the program-changing re
cruiting class of 2008, which in
cludes the NFL-bound Luck, the
rare defeat comes as a sour ending

to a four-year career that saw the
Cardinal program reach unprece
dented heights and notch a 23-3
record in the last two seasons.
"It's hard to reconcile a loss in
the last game of the year," Luck
said. "But I'm so proud to be able to
represent Stanford, so ever grateful
to be a part of this locker room, and
I'll miss these guys dearly."
Despite his excellence in the Fi
esta Bowl and in 2011, Luck de
parts the program like a hero from
an Ernest Hemingway novel
with the final moments of the story
leaving an unsatisfying conclusion
to a dedicated, brilliant effort a
fact he was acutely aware of.
"It's a game of football," he
said. "I don't believe in fairy tales
any more now that I'm older."
