# Pride in team trumps pain of loss
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Every week this football sea
son, I've delved into the
numbers related to Stan
ford football and tried to
use statistics to gain greater insight
into the team and the games them
selves. I could do this same thing
about last week's Fiesta Bowl.
Except I can't.
I've looked at the numbers. I've
seen how much Stanford outgained
Oklahoma State, I know the Cardi
nal had over 200 more yards than the
Cowboys. I know Stanford didn't
trail until that final field goal went
through the uprights. I know painful
ly well what Andrew Luck's stats
were, what Stepfan Taylor's were,
what Ty Montgomery's were.
The thing is, sometimes the stats
don't give you any more informa
tion. If you saw that game, or ii; like
me, you were at University of
Phoenix Stadium (yep, that's really
its name) that day, you know what
happened. You saw Stanford domi
nate virtually every facet of the
game, only to lose in heartbreaking
fashion.
I'm not here to point the finger of
blame. There are dozens and dozens
of other columns out there ridiculing
Jordan Williamson for his three
missed kicks. Many others bash
David Shaw for his conservative
play-calling. For lots of pained Stan
ford fans, anger and blame are the
only means of coping. I understand
that.
But that's just not me. Not be
cause I'm noble or above that or any
thing. I just don't have the energy.
The Fiesta Bowl took so much out of
me that I just can't bring myself to
rant and throw people under the bus.
Instead, I'm just deflated. As my
colleague Jack Blanchat so accurate-
