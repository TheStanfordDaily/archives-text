# Pride in team trumps pain of loss
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Every week this football sea
son, I've delved into the
numbers related to Stan
ford football and tried to
use statistics to gain greater insight
into the team and the games them
selves. I could do this same thing
about last week's Fiesta Bowl.
Except I can't.
I've looked at the numbers. I've
seen how much Stanford outgained
Oklahoma State, I know the Cardi
nal had over 200 more yards than the
Cowboys. I know Stanford didn't
trail until that final field goal went
through the uprights. I know painful
ly well what Andrew Luck's stats
were, what Stepfan Taylor's were,
what Ty Montgomery's were.
The thing is, sometimes the stats
don't give you any more informa
tion. If you saw that game, or ii; like
me, you were at University of
Phoenix Stadium (yep, that's really
its name) that day, you know what
happened. You saw Stanford domi
nate virtually every facet of the
game, only to lose in heartbreaking
fashion.
I'm not here to point the finger of
blame. There are dozens and dozens
of other columns out there ridiculing
Jordan Williamson for his three
missed kicks. Many others bash
David Shaw for his conservative
play-calling. For lots of pained Stan
ford fans, anger and blame are the
only means of coping. I understand
that.
But that's just not me. Not be
cause I'm noble or above that or any
thing. I just don't have the energy.
The Fiesta Bowl took so much out of
me that I just can't bring myself to
rant and throw people under the bus.
Instead, I'm just deflated. As my
colleague Jack Blanchat so accurate-

ly put it, the Fiesta Bowl was going ab
solutely perfectly for Stanford, and
then in the span of a moment, it all
fell apart. I've gone over this game so
many times in my head that I can see
a football sailing to the left of an up
right every time I blink. I've already
compared it to the other worst mo
ment in Stanford football history, a
comparison that is too fitting for my
liking.
Many other people have moved
on, but one week has not been
enough for me to get past the pain of
the Fiesta Bowl. Losing at the last
second is tough, but for me, this game
was even more than a rough loss.This
was the end.
In my time at Stanford, I've had
the great fortune to broadcast foot
ball games for KZSU. I've been at all
three bowl games and traveled to al
most every road game for the past
two years. It's been an unbelievable
experience, but as I am a senior, the
Fiesta Bowl marked the end for me.
The end of anything great is difficult,
and seeing such an incredible lour
years end as heart-wrenchingly as
possible was almost unbearable.
But I'm just a broadcaster and a
fan. I didn't play a down, and I can
take no credit for a single success of
Stanford football.

Think about the players. Think
about the guys that have been there
for four, five or even six years work
ing their tails off every day to make
Stanford into a contender.
It's easy to get caught up in the
abysmal ending, but as I sat in the
booth watching Oklahoma State
fans celebrate a game Stanford
should have won, I couldn't help but
go over the last four years in my
head.
I wasn't on the Farm yet when the
Cardinal went through that infa
mous 1-11 season,but I've been a fan
since far before then. I remember my
sister telling me frantically that Stan
ford had somehow beaten USC in
the Biggest Upset Ever. I remember
the roughly 20 people in the stands
with me at the end of a rainy Stan
ford blowout of Washington State
my freshman year. I remember
being in the distinct minority as a
Stanford fan in our own stadium
when the Trojans came to town.
I remember when a five-win sea
son was a success. And I know many
of you do too.
Just think about that for a second,
and think about what Stanford foot
ball has just accomplished. An 11-
win season is a disappointment. Let
that sink in. Eleven wins. Before
2010, Stanford had never gotten 11
wins in a season. Now it's not
enough. This year, Stanford Stadium
was sold out for every home game
but one. Yep, the same stadium that
caused Washington head coach

Steve Sarkisian to prepare his play
ers for a lack of crowd noise because
of attendance issues.
The 2012 football schedule was
just announced, and I'm already
hearing complaints from people that
had never even been to a game three
years ago. Casual fans are scouting
out the 2012 football season. In Janu
ary.
To say that the seniors on the
team have changed the culture here
is as big an understatement as saying
that Luck is a decent quarterback.
Stanford football is unrecognizable
compared to what it was a few years
ago, and it's only getting better.
I know the Fiesta Bowl hurt. It's
still hurting. But think about the big
picture. Think about where Stanford
football has been, and think about
where it's going now.
And think about those seniors.
This is it for them too. Do you want
to remember one bad minute or four
years of unbelievable achievement?
Even as pessimistic as I am, I'll
take Option B.
So thank you, seniors. You may
not all make millions in the NFL, but
you've all done incredible things for
Stanford, and you've made the last
four years an absolute pleasure.

A, even going so far as to tattoo "this
one hurts Fiesta Bowl 'l2 " on his
chest. But he ended up choosing Op

laser tattoo-removal sessions ahead.

ly put it, the Fiesta Bowl was going ab
solutely perfectly for Stanford, and
then in the span of a moment, it all
fell apart. I've gone over this game so
many times in my head that I can see
a football sailing to the left of an up
right every time I blink. I've already
compared it to the other worst mo
ment in Stanford football history, a
comparison that is too fitting for my
liking.
Many other people have moved
on, but one week has not been
enough for me to get past the pain of
the Fiesta Bowl. Losing at the last
second is tough, but for me, this game
was even more than a rough loss.This
was the end.
In my time at Stanford, I've had
the great fortune to broadcast foot
ball games for KZSU. I've been at all
three bowl games and traveled to al
most every road game for the past
two years. It's been an unbelievable
experience, but as I am a senior, the
Fiesta Bowl marked the end for me.
The end of anything great is difficult,
and seeing such an incredible lour
years end as heart-wrenchingly as
possible was almost unbearable.
But I'm just a broadcaster and a
fan. I didn't play a down, and I can
take no credit for a single success of
Stanford football.

Think about the players. Think
about the guys that have been there
for four, five or even six years work
ing their tails off every day to make
Stanford into a contender.
It's easy to get caught up in the
abysmal ending, but as I sat in the
booth watching Oklahoma State
fans celebrate a game Stanford
should have won, I couldn't help but
go over the last four years in my
head.
I wasn't on the Farm yet when the
Cardinal went through that infa
mous 1-11 season,but I've been a fan
since far before then. I remember my
sister telling me frantically that Stan
ford had somehow beaten USC in
the Biggest Upset Ever. I remember
the roughly 20 people in the stands
with me at the end of a rainy Stan
ford blowout of Washington State
my freshman year. I remember
being in the distinct minority as a
Stanford fan in our own stadium
when the Trojans came to town.
I remember when a five-win sea
son was a success. And I know many
of you do too.
Just think about that for a second,
and think about what Stanford foot
ball has just accomplished. An 11-
win season is a disappointment. Let
that sink in. Eleven wins. Before
2010, Stanford had never gotten 11
wins in a season. Now it's not
enough. This year, Stanford Stadium
was sold out for every home game
but one. Yep, the same stadium that
caused Washington head coach

Steve Sarkisian to prepare his play
ers for a lack of crowd noise because
of attendance issues.
The 2012 football schedule was
just announced, and I'm already
hearing complaints from people that
had never even been to a game three
years ago. Casual fans are scouting
out the 2012 football season. In Janu
ary.
To say that the seniors on the
team have changed the culture here
is as big an understatement as saying
that Luck is a decent quarterback.
Stanford football is unrecognizable
compared to what it was a few years
ago, and it's only getting better.
I know the Fiesta Bowl hurt. It's
still hurting. But think about the big
picture. Think about where Stanford
football has been, and think about
where it's going now.
And think about those seniors.
This is it for them too. Do you want
to remember one bad minute or four
years of unbelievable achievement?
Even as pessimistic as I am, I'll
take Option B.
So thank you, seniors. You may
not all make millions in the NFL, but
you've all done incredible things for
Stanford, and you've made the last
four years an absolute pleasure.

laser tattoo-removal sessions ahead.
Every week this football sea
son, I've delved into the
numbers related to Stan
ford football and tried to
use statistics to gain greater insight
into the team and the games them
selves. I could do this same thing
about last week's Fiesta Bowl.
Except I can't.
I've looked at the numbers. I've
seen how much Stanford outgained
Oklahoma State, I know the Cardi
nal had over 200 more yards than the
Cowboys. I know Stanford didn't
trail until that final field goal went
through the uprights. I know painful
ly well what Andrew Luck's stats
were, what Stepfan Taylor's were,
what Ty Montgomery's were.
The thing is, sometimes the stats
don't give you any more informa
tion. If you saw that game, or ii; like
me, you were at University of
Phoenix Stadium (yep, that's really
its name) that day, you know what
happened. You saw Stanford domi
nate virtually every facet of the
game, only to lose in heartbreaking
fashion.
I'm not here to point the finger of
blame. There are dozens and dozens
of other columns out there ridiculing
Jordan Williamson for his three
missed kicks. Many others bash
David Shaw for his conservative
play-calling. For lots of pained Stan
ford fans, anger and blame are the
only means of coping. I understand
that.
But that's just not me. Not be
cause I'm noble or above that or any
thing. I just don't have the energy.
The Fiesta Bowl took so much out of
me that I just can't bring myself to
rant and throw people under the bus.
Instead, I'm just deflated. As my
colleague Jack Blanchat so accurate-

ly put it, the Fiesta Bowl was going ab
solutely perfectly for Stanford, and
then in the span of a moment, it all
