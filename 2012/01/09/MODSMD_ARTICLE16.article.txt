# CARD WINS IN FOUR OTs
## 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
After holding its first 14 oppo
nents to 72 points or fewer en
route to a 12-2 start, the Stanford
men's basketball team gave up
season-high point totals in back
to-back road games against the
Oregon schools. Thanks to a late
comeback on Saturday night,
though, the Cardinal was able to
salvage a split in thrilling fashion,
winning the longest game in
school history 103-101.
On Thursday, Stanford (13-3,
3-1 Pac-12) suffered its first loss
in conference play, falling 78-67
to Oregon (11-4, 2-1). Duck for
ward Devoe Joseph scored 16 of
his game-high 30 points in the

final 10 minutes to help Oregon
pull away. Joseph, a senior trans
fer from Minnesota, had not
scored more than 19 points in
nearly three full years. Mean
while, the Cardinal was outre
bounded for only the third time
all season Stanford is 1-2 in

Thursday's game was the Car
dinal's first road loss, but Satur
day's tussle with Oregon State was
the game of the weekend in the
Pac-12 and perhaps the nation.
For much of the early going,

the game was anything but excit
ing for Stanford. The Beavers
used an early 18-5 run to take a
32-17 lead with six minutes to go
in the first half. The big blows
were back-to-back three-point
ers by reserve guard Roberto
Nelson after one of his shoes had
fallen off. Nelson, who had made
just six shots total in his past
three games, was 6-for-9 with 15
points in the first half to lead all
scorers.
Stanford responded to the
Beavers' lead with a 15-2 run of
its own, but Oregon State
stretched the lead back to seven
at halftime. The Beaver offense
clicked at the start of the half, and
several early layups gave Oregon
State a 55-43 lead. Just when it
appeared that the Cardinal was
reverting to last year's poor form,
Stanford's guards took over.
Sophomore Aaron Bright and
freshman Chasson Randle hit
three-pointers to cap a 10-0 Stan
ford run that gave the Cardinal
its first lead of the game at 61-60
with 8:30 to go.
From there, the game tight
ened up, as neither team led by
more than three points. Sopho
more forward Dwight Powell,
who did not score on Thursday,
got crucial playing time on Satur
day and made a layup to give
Stanford a 74-71 lead with just
over two minutes to play. Oregon
State responded as forward
Angus Brandt banked in a three
pointer to tie it.
With just 25 seconds left, the
score was tied again, and Brandt
was fouled by Powell. Brandt
missed both free throws, giving
Stanford a chance to win the
game at the buzzer. Powell
missed a jumper with two sec
onds left, and Oregon State for
ward Eric Moreland got the re
bound. Instead of just holding it
for overtime, Moreland tried to
heave the ball downcourt, and
redshirt senior forward Josh
Owens knocked it down and im
mediately laid the ball in right at
the buzzer.
The Stanford bench mobbed
Owens as it appeared he had just
won the game. However, the ref
erees checked the monitors and
determined that the red light on
the backboard the official in

dicator of the end of the game,
rather than the stadium clock
was illuminated a fraction of a
second before Owens released
the ball, making the shot not
count and sending the game to
overtime.
Stanford began overtime at a
disadvantage because sopho
more forward John Gage fouled
out during regulation. The Cardi
nal's foul trouble worsened as
Bright picked up his fourth foul
and senior guard Jarrett Mann
fouled out. Trailing 83-82 with 23
seconds left, Randle made one of
two free throws to tie the game
up, and Beaver guard Ahmad
Starks dribbled the ball off his
foot out of bounds on Oregon
State's final possession to force
another extra frame.
In the second overtime, the
two teams traded leads back and
forth. Down by one with 20 sec
onds left, Powell threw a perfect
inbounds pass to Randle for an
easy layup to take the lead. Ore
gon State forward Joe Burton
then got fouled and made one
free throw to tie it back up, and
Randle's desperation shot was
blocked to send the game to
triple overtime.
By the third overtime, both
teams were clearly exhausted.
The Beavers didn't make shots,
but they still held a 95-92 lead
thanks to three free throws. The
final of those three came after
Bright's fifth foul, making him
the third Cardinal starter to foul
out. Stanford looked to be at the
end of its road, but Oregon State
missed a couple put-backs to
keep the game within a score, and
finally sophomore forward An
thony Brown knocked down a
clutch game-tying three-pointer
with 17 seconds left. The 14th tie
of the game forced yet another
overtime session.
Randle came out on fire to
start the fourth overtime, sinking
a three-pointer and converting a
layup on the first two possessions
of the period to give Stanford a
100-95 lead. This marked the first
time since the game was 60-55
with nine minutes left in regula
tion that either team led by more
than one possession. The two

those games.
