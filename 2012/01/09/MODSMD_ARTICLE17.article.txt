# OGWUMIKES LEAD WINTER SWEEP
## 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last week the Stanford
women's basketball team finished
off a busy holiday break with two
wins over the Oregon schools at
Maples Pavilion. Since students
headed home at the end of finals,
the team has played, and won,
seven straight games and sits alone
atop the Pac-12 standings.

The stretch also saw a host of
Cardinal players set personal
records. Against Princeton, sopho
more forward Chiney Ogwumike
put up 21 points before her sister,
senior forward Nnemkadi, bet
tered that with 42 points against
Tennessee. Sophomore guard Toni
Kokenis also scored 26 points, in
cluding five three-pointers, against
the Lady Volunteers. In the follow
ing game, versus Cal State Bakers
field, junior forward Joslyn Tinkle
grabbed a career-best double-dou
ble with 20 points and 11 rebounds,
and freshman forward Erica
Payne scored 12 points. Then, in
the first-ever Pac-12 game played
on Maples Pavilion's hardwood,
freshman forwards Taylor Green
field and Bonnie Samuelson
notched 17 points on five three
pointers and 18 points on six
threes, respectively.
However, No. 4 Stanford (13-1,
4-0 Pac-12) did not have every
thing its own way over the break,
and it had to battle hard to keep its
home winning streak intact,
pushed all the way in the very first
game, against Princeton, and the
very last, against Oregon State.
Lining up shorter than the
Card, unranked Princeton showed
its determination by out-rebound
ing Stanford in the early part of the
game the Saturday after finals. The
Tigers refused to be bowed by
their more prestigious opponents,
and each time it looked like the
home team was pulling away,
Princeton responded. In the sec

ond half, though, the Cardinal
began to pull ahead, and as its op
ponents struggled with fouls, the
challenge began to fall away and
Stanford sealed an 85-66 victory.
"I thought [Princeton's] pace
was great, I thought they were
scrappy, and if Nneka and Chiney
had been on their team, we would
have gotten blasted," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer after
the game. "We need other people
stepping up."
Perhaps VanDerveer's chal
lenge to her other players worked,
because Kokenis played a major
role in turning a nine-point deficit
into a strong 97-80 victory over No.
6 Tennessee in the team's next
game.
"I think this was a breakout
game for Toni," VanDerveer com
mented after the game. "We know
she's capable of that, but to knock
down her threes, to run the offense.
For us to have two turnovers at
halftime says something about
great point guard play."
The headline story from that
game, though, was not Kokenis'
performance but the 42-point, 17-
rebound starring role of Nnemka
di Ogwumike,
"This was one of the most in
credible individual performances
that I've ever seen on this court,"
VanDerveer said, "and I just want
to congratulate Nneka for really
putting our team on her back. She
was a woman with girls out there.
She just dominated in away I've
never seen. You could say she was
in a zone, but this is how she's been
practicing, and this is how she's
been competing and leading."
Two days later Stanford wel
comed Bakersfield to the Farm
and taught the newcomers to Divi
sion I basketball a difficult lesson
in a 90-48 rout. Against weaker op
position, and with a 30-point lead
already by the half, VanDerveer
used the opportunity to rest her
starters and give others a real
chance to shine. Even without
those usual players, the Roadrun
ners were still no match for the
Cardinal and performances by Tin
kle and Payne.
"This was without Nneka,"

VanDerveer said. "This was play
ing without Chiney a lot. Other
people stepped up, and that's what
our team is all about. If we wanna
win the Pac-12, its not gonna be
just Nneka or just Toni."
After a short break for Christ
mas, Stanford then headed down
to Los Angeles to finish off the
year with its first-ever outings in
the new Pac-12 Conference. First
up was USC, and just like after the
break for finals, the Cardinal
seemed to be lacking some sharp
ness in a narrow 61-53 victory. Al
though Stanford led through most
of the game, the Trojans came back
from a 10-point deficit in the first
half to tie the game midway
through the second, and it was only
in the last five minutes that the
Cardinal managed to stabilize its
lead and fend off the challenge
from the Trojans.
Crossing the city to face UCLA
on New Year's Eve, the Card en
joyed an easier contest after a close
first few minutes, leading the Bru
ins by 17 points at the half to set up
a comfortable 77-50 rout. Both Og
wumike sisters posted double
doubles, and Stanford comfortably
outshot UCLA from the floor with
almost double the Bruins' shoot
ing accuracy. The Cardinal also
grabbed almost twice as many
boards as the Bruins, 49 to 27, and
four times as many assists, 19 to 5.
Returning to the Farm last
week, Stanford seized the chance
to take away some of the Ducks'
Rose Bowl-winning high with a
dominant 93-70 victory. Oregon at
tempted to nullify the Ogwumike
sisters' dominance in the paint by
forcing the Card to shoot from out
side, but against the three-point
abilities of Greenfield and
Samuelson, it didn't work: the pair
hit 11 shots from beyond the arc.
"They did a good job of con
taining the inside," Nnemkadi Og
wumike said, "but our perimeter
shooting really opened it up, and
that's always a lot of relief for the
post."
Even against this strategy, one
that in theory should diminish her
effect, Nnemkadi Ogwumike still
managed to make a major impact

on this contest, grabbing a double
double and 32 points of her own.
"I thought we did a terrific job
on Nneka," said Oregon head
coach Paul Westhead. "She's a
pretty good player. She had 32
points, and we did a good job."
Facing Oregon State, a team
Stanford has never lost to in 25
home games and that was coming
off three losses in four games, the
Cardinal could have been forgiven
for expecting an easier ride, not a
narrow 67-60 win.
In the first few minutes, the Stanford
defense looked to be having a real ef
fect on the Beavers, but as the half wore
on, the strategy seemed to be coming
apart. Oregon State was hitting over 60
percent from the field while the Card
was not making its own possessions
count, and it slipped back from an
eight-point lead to trail by four. A bet
ter second half and double-double per
formances from Nnemkadi who also
broke into the 1,000-rebound and
2,000-point clubs in this game and

Chiney Ogwumike turned the tide, but
the Beavers pushed Stanford to the
end, halving a 14-point gap by the final
buzzer.
"I think this was a wakeup call
for our team" VanDerveer said.
"How important it is to every
team coming up against Stanford.
I can't say I was really excited
about how we played, but I was ex
cited about how Nneka and
Chiney battled."
The break schedule has made it
clear that while in this young team
there is serious potential, Stanford
is not yet the finished unit that it
could be. The Card will need to
keep growing up fast if it hopes to
add more silverware to its cabinet
now that the long Pac-12 schedule
is in full flow. Next up is a trip to
the conference's new additions at
Utah on Thursday and then Col
orado on Saturday.

a comfortable 77-50 rout. Both Og
wumike sisters posted double
doubles, and Stanford comfortably
outshot UCLA from the floor with
almost double the Bruins' shoot
ing accuracy. The Cardinal also
grabbed almost twice as many
boards as the Bruins, 49 to 27, and
four times as many assists, 19 to 5.
Returning to the Farm last
week, Stanford seized the chance
to take away some of the Ducks'
Rose Bowl-winning high with a
dominant 93-70 victory. Oregon at
tempted to nullify the Ogwumike
sisters' dominance in the paint by
forcing the Card to shoot from out
side, but against the three-point
abilities of Greenfield and
Samuelson, it didn't work: the pair
hit 11 shots from beyond the arc.
"They did a good job of con
taining the inside," Nnemkadi Og
wumike said, "but our perimeter
shooting really opened it up, and
that's always a lot of relief for the
post."
Even against this strategy, one
that in theory should diminish her
effect, Nnemkadi Ogwumike still
managed to make a major impact

on this contest, grabbing a double
double and 32 points of her own.
"I thought we did a terrific job
on Nneka," said Oregon head
coach Paul Westhead. "She's a
pretty good player. She had 32
points, and we did a good job."
Facing Oregon State, a team
Stanford has never lost to in 25
home games and that was coming
off three losses in four games, the
Cardinal could have been forgiven
for expecting an easier ride, not a
narrow 67-60 win.
In the first few minutes, the Stanford
defense looked to be having a real ef
fect on the Beavers, but as the half wore
on, the strategy seemed to be coming
apart. Oregon State was hitting over 60
percent from the field while the Card
was not making its own possessions
count, and it slipped back from an
eight-point lead to trail by four. A bet
ter second half and double-double per
formances from Nnemkadi who also
broke into the 1,000-rebound and
2,000-point clubs in this game and

Chiney Ogwumike turned the tide, but
the Beavers pushed Stanford to the
end, halving a 14-point gap by the final
buzzer.
"I think this was a wakeup call
for our team" VanDerveer said.
"How important it is to every
team coming up against Stanford.
I can't say I was really excited
about how we played, but I was ex
cited about how Nneka and
Chiney battled."
The break schedule has made it
clear that while in this young team
there is serious potential, Stanford
is not yet the finished unit that it
could be. The Card will need to
keep growing up fast if it hopes to
add more silverware to its cabinet
now that the long Pac-12 schedule
is in full flow. Next up is a trip to
the conference's new additions at
Utah on Thursday and then Col

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
OREGON STATE 60
STANFORD 67
1 /7, Maples Pavilion


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Senior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike had a career-high 42 points and
17 rebounds in the No. 4 Stanford women's basketball team's 97-80
win over No. 6 Tennessee, the team's biggest win of the season so far.
Last week the Stanford
women's basketball team finished
off a busy holiday break with two
wins over the Oregon schools at
Maples Pavilion. Since students
headed home at the end of finals,
the team has played, and won,
seven straight games and sits alone
atop the Pac-12 standings.

The stretch also saw a host of
Cardinal players set personal
records. Against Princeton, sopho
more forward Chiney Ogwumike
put up 21 points before her sister,
senior forward Nnemkadi, bet
tered that with 42 points against
Tennessee. Sophomore guard Toni
Kokenis also scored 26 points, in
cluding five three-pointers, against
the Lady Volunteers. In the follow
ing game, versus Cal State Bakers
field, junior forward Joslyn Tinkle
grabbed a career-best double-dou
ble with 20 points and 11 rebounds,
and freshman forward Erica
Payne scored 12 points. Then, in
the first-ever Pac-12 game played
on Maples Pavilion's hardwood,
freshman forwards Taylor Green
field and Bonnie Samuelson
notched 17 points on five three
pointers and 18 points on six
threes, respectively.
However, No. 4 Stanford (13-1,
4-0 Pac-12) did not have every
thing its own way over the break,
and it had to battle hard to keep its
home winning streak intact,
pushed all the way in the very first
game, against Princeton, and the
very last, against Oregon State.
Lining up shorter than the
Card, unranked Princeton showed
its determination by out-rebound
ing Stanford in the early part of the
game the Saturday after finals. The
Tigers refused to be bowed by
their more prestigious opponents,
and each time it looked like the
home team was pulling away,
Princeton responded. In the sec

ond half, though, the Cardinal
began to pull ahead, and as its op
ponents struggled with fouls, the
challenge began to fall away and
Stanford sealed an 85-66 victory.
"I thought [Princeton's] pace
was great, I thought they were
scrappy, and if Nneka and Chiney
had been on their team, we would
have gotten blasted," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer after
the game. "We need other people
stepping up."
Perhaps VanDerveer's chal
lenge to her other players worked,
because Kokenis played a major
role in turning a nine-point deficit
into a strong 97-80 victory over No.
6 Tennessee in the team's next
game.
"I think this was a breakout
game for Toni," VanDerveer com
mented after the game. "We know
she's capable of that, but to knock
down her threes, to run the offense.
For us to have two turnovers at
halftime says something about
great point guard play."
The headline story from that
game, though, was not Kokenis'
performance but the 42-point, 17-
rebound starring role of Nnemka
di Ogwumike,
"This was one of the most in
credible individual performances
that I've ever seen on this court,"
VanDerveer said, "and I just want
to congratulate Nneka for really
putting our team on her back. She
was a woman with girls out there.
She just dominated in away I've
never seen. You could say she was
in a zone, but this is how she's been
practicing, and this is how she's
been competing and leading."
Two days later Stanford wel
comed Bakersfield to the Farm
and taught the newcomers to Divi
sion I basketball a difficult lesson
in a 90-48 rout. Against weaker op
position, and with a 30-point lead
already by the half, VanDerveer
used the opportunity to rest her
starters and give others a real
chance to shine. Even without
those usual players, the Roadrun
ners were still no match for the
Cardinal and performances by Tin
kle and Payne.
"This was without Nneka,"

VanDerveer said. "This was play
ing without Chiney a lot. Other
people stepped up, and that's what
our team is all about. If we wanna
win the Pac-12, its not gonna be
just Nneka or just Toni."
After a short break for Christ
mas, Stanford then headed down
to Los Angeles to finish off the
year with its first-ever outings in
the new Pac-12 Conference. First
up was USC, and just like after the
break for finals, the Cardinal
seemed to be lacking some sharp
ness in a narrow 61-53 victory. Al
though Stanford led through most
of the game, the Trojans came back
from a 10-point deficit in the first
half to tie the game midway
through the second, and it was only
in the last five minutes that the
Cardinal managed to stabilize its
lead and fend off the challenge
from the Trojans.
Crossing the city to face UCLA
on New Year's Eve, the Card en
joyed an easier contest after a close
first few minutes, leading the Bru
ins by 17 points at the half to set up
a comfortable 77-50 rout. Both Og
wumike sisters posted double

outshot UCLA from the floor with

Lining up shorter than the
Card, unranked Princeton showed
its determination by out-rebound
ing Stanford in the early part of the
game the Saturday after finals. The
Tigers refused to be bowed by
their more prestigious opponents,
and each time it looked like the
home team was pulling away,
Princeton responded. In the sec

ond half, though, the Cardinal
began to pull ahead, and as its op
ponents struggled with fouls, the
challenge began to fall away and
Stanford sealed an 85-66 victory.
"I thought [Princeton's] pace
was great, I thought they were
scrappy, and if Nneka and Chiney
had been on their team, we would
have gotten blasted," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer after
the game. "We need other people
stepping up."
Perhaps VanDerveer's chal
lenge to her other players worked,
because Kokenis played a major
role in turning a nine-point deficit
into a strong 97-80 victory over No.
6 Tennessee in the team's next
game.
"I think this was a breakout
game for Toni," VanDerveer com
mented after the game. "We know
she's capable of that, but to knock
down her threes, to run the offense.
For us to have two turnovers at
halftime says something about
great point guard play."
The headline story from that
game, though, was not Kokenis'
performance but the 42-point, 17-
rebound starring role of Nnemka
di Ogwumike,
"This was one of the most in
credible individual performances
that I've ever seen on this court,"
VanDerveer said, "and I just want
to congratulate Nneka for really
putting our team on her back. She
was a woman with girls out there.
She just dominated in away I've
never seen. You could say she was
in a zone, but this is how she's been
practicing, and this is how she's
been competing and leading."
Two days later Stanford wel
comed Bakersfield to the Farm
and taught the newcomers to Divi
sion I basketball a difficult lesson
in a 90-48 rout. Against weaker op
position, and with a 30-point lead
already by the half, VanDerveer
used the opportunity to rest her
starters and give others a real
chance to shine. Even without
those usual players, the Roadrun
ners were still no match for the
Cardinal and performances by Tin
kle and Payne.
"This was without Nneka,"

VanDerveer said. "This was play
ing without Chiney a lot. Other
people stepped up, and that's what
our team is all about. If we wanna
win the Pac-12, its not gonna be
just Nneka or just Toni."
After a short break for Christ
mas, Stanford then headed down
to Los Angeles to finish off the
year with its first-ever outings in
the new Pac-12 Conference. First
up was USC, and just like after the
break for finals, the Cardinal
seemed to be lacking some sharp
ness in a narrow 61-53 victory. Al
though Stanford led through most
of the game, the Trojans came back
from a 10-point deficit in the first
half to tie the game midway
through the second, and it was only
in the last five minutes that the
Cardinal managed to stabilize its
lead and fend off the challenge
from the Trojans.
Crossing the city to face UCLA
on New Year's Eve, the Card en
joyed an easier contest after a close
first few minutes, leading the Bru
ins by 17 points at the half to set up
a comfortable 77-50 rout. Both Og
wumike sisters posted double
doubles, and Stanford comfortably
outshot UCLA from the floor with
almost double the Bruins' shoot
ing accuracy. The Cardinal also
grabbed almost twice as many
boards as the Bruins, 49 to 27, and
four times as many assists, 19 to 5.
Returning to the Farm last
week, Stanford seized the chance
to take away some of the Ducks'
Rose Bowl-winning high with a
dominant 93-70 victory. Oregon at
tempted to nullify the Ogwumike
sisters' dominance in the paint by
forcing the Card to shoot from out
side, but against the three-point
abilities of Greenfield and
Samuelson, it didn't work: the pair
hit 11 shots from beyond the arc.
"They did a good job of con
taining the inside," Nnemkadi Og
wumike said, "but our perimeter
shooting really opened it up, and
that's always a lot of relief for the
post."
Even against this strategy, one
that in theory should diminish her
effect, Nnemkadi Ogwumike still
managed to make a major impact

on this contest, grabbing a double
double and 32 points of her own.
"I thought we did a terrific job
on Nneka," said Oregon head
coach Paul Westhead. "She's a
pretty good player. She had 32
points, and we did a good job."
Facing Oregon State, a team
Stanford has never lost to in 25
home games and that was coming
off three losses in four games, the
Cardinal could have been forgiven
for expecting an easier ride, not a
narrow 67-60 win.
In the first few minutes, the Stanford
defense looked to be having a real ef
fect on the Beavers, but as the half wore
on, the strategy seemed to be coming
apart. Oregon State was hitting over 60
percent from the field while the Card
was not making its own possessions
count, and it slipped back from an
eight-point lead to trail by four. A bet
ter second half and double-double per
formances from Nnemkadi who also
broke into the 1,000-rebound and
2,000-point clubs in this game and

Chiney Ogwumike turned the tide, but
the Beavers pushed Stanford to the
end, halving a 14-point gap by the final
buzzer.
"I think this was a wakeup call
for our team" VanDerveer said.
"How important it is to every
team coming up against Stanford.
I can't say I was really excited
about how we played, but I was ex
cited about how Nneka and
Chiney battled."
The break schedule has made it
clear that while in this young team
there is serious potential, Stanford
is not yet the finished unit that it
could be. The Card will need to
keep growing up fast if it hopes to
add more silverware to its cabinet
now that the long Pac-12 schedule
is in full flow. Next up is a trip to
the conference's new additions at
Utah on Thursday and then Col
orado on Saturday.
