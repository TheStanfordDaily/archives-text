# CARD SHOWS MAJOR STRIDES
## 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The road to a 3-1 conference
start has been far from flawless,
yet in the fourth season under the
direction of head coach Johnny
Dawkins, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team appears to have final
ly turned a corner and is now on
pace to see its first legitimate post
season action since the departure
of Brook and Robin Lopez in the
spring of 2008.
The Cardinal (13-3) has
emerged as the early, albeit
minute, favorite in the Pac-12, a
conference still stuck in what
seems like a perpetual rebuilding
process. Stanford has benefitted
from an improvement on offense,
possible in large part because of
the emergence of sophomore
guard Aaron Bright and the addi
tion of freshman guard Chasson
Randle. The backcourt duo have
combined to hit 63 three-pointers
thus far, with Bright connecting on
50 percent of his looks from be
hind the arc. Efficient production
from the perimeter has yielded a
team output of 73.1 points per
game, good enough for third in the
conference.
However, the real surprise
from this year's team has come on
the glass, where senior forward
Josh Owens leads the most pro
ductive rebounding team in the
conference. The Cardinal ranks
first in both offensive and defen
sive rebounds, and its 52.7 re
bounding percentage ranks in the
top 25 nationally. It's a marked im
provement for a once height-chal
lenged squad that has augmented
its frontcourt depth. Owens pulls
down 6.1 boards per game, and
sophomore forward Josh Huestis
grabs nearly 10 rebounds per 40
minutes. Both players, undersized
at their respective positions, have
performed admirably early in the
conference season, most notably
in the Pac-12 opener against
UCLA, a team with a significant
size advantage.
Rebounding has been critical
in preventing second-chance scor
ing opportunities for opponents,
repeated looks that would be fatal
for a turnover-maligned offense
the Cardinal gives the ball away
nearly 15 times per game. Addi

tionally, the team averages less
than one assist per turnover, a sta
tistic that will undoubtedly need
to improve to sustain Stanford's
early-season success but one that
is shockingly not the worst in the
conference.

As in recent years, turnovers
have almost exclusively been the
product of the cliched, careless er
rors. Stanford's young ball-han
dling core has struggled with full
court pressure, reckless dribble
drives and, as demonstrated in the
four-overtime thriller against Ore
gon State, inbounds in decisive
moments. These issues, especially
when attributed to youth, typically
resolve themselves with increased
playing time. But consistent min
utes on any given night are hard to
come by, and Dawkins has been
far from hesitant to make lineup
alterations. Nine players regularly
average more than 11 minutes per
night.
Another glaring issue is the
team's free-throw shooting, a
groan-worthy flaw that is exposed
on a nightly basis. Stanford has
recorded the fifth-most shots from
the charity stripe in the confer
ence but has hit those attempts at
a rate of 67.7 percent. The Cardi
nal plays four guys in its regular
rotation that shoot worse than 65
percent from the line, and oppos
ing teams have been intent to ex
ploit this fault.
But even when factoring in the
free throws and turnovers, Stan
ford is getting it done in the wins
column. The Card is one of four
teams in the Pac-12 with just one
conference loss, a group that trails
undefeated Colorado, a league
newcomer that has shockingly
won its first three Pac-12 games by
a combined 69 points. It's unlikely
that the Buffaloes will maintain
this torrid pace, leaving the door
wide open for the conference title.
"Unlikely" may be an under
statement when describing the
Pac-12's chance at securing more
than two bids to the NCAA Tour
nament in March. But aside from
the conference tournament cham
pion, the team currently with the
best shot at receiving an at-large
bid is Stanford. The two losses to
Oregon and Butler sting, but a
five-point defeat against No. 1
Syracuse in Madison Square Gar
den a game in which the Cardi
nal led for the majority of the ac
tion could actually benefit
Dawkins' squad when the selec
tion committee takes a look at its
resume.
First, though, Stanford must
navigate its way through a daunt
ing post-break schedule. The team
receives Utah and Colorado at
home this week before taking on
its toughest road trip of the sea

son, a three-game gauntlet at
Washington, Washington State
and Cal. If the Cardinal is able to
win at least four of those games,
most notably the matchup with
the Bears, then Stanford could see
its first action inside the AP Top 25
and position itself for a berth in
the Big Dance.
Minimizing turnovers and in
creasing offensive efficiency is im
perative, as is cementing a firmer
rotation. Sloppy play often masks
reality, but the talent and coaching
is there. Now it's just a matter of
putting it all together when it
counts.

The road to a 3-1 conference
start has been far from flawless,
yet in the fourth season under the
direction of head coach Johnny
Dawkins, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team appears to have final
ly turned a corner and is now on
pace to see its first legitimate post
season action since the departure
of Brook and Robin Lopez in the
spring of 2008.
The Cardinal (13-3) has
emerged as the early, albeit
minute, favorite in the Pac-12, a
conference still stuck in what
seems like a perpetual rebuilding
process. Stanford has benefitted
from an improvement on offense,
possible in large part because of
the emergence of sophomore
guard Aaron Bright and the addi
tion of freshman guard Chasson
Randle. The backcourt duo have
combined to hit 63 three-pointers
thus far, with Bright connecting on
50 percent of his looks from be
hind the arc. Efficient production
from the perimeter has yielded a
team output of 73.1 points per
game, good enough for third in the
conference.
However, the real surprise
from this year's team has come on
the glass, where senior forward
Josh Owens leads the most pro
ductive rebounding team in the
conference. The Cardinal ranks
first in both offensive and defen
sive rebounds, and its 52.7 re
bounding percentage ranks in the
top 25 nationally. It's a marked im
provement for a once height-chal
lenged squad that has augmented
its frontcourt depth. Owens pulls
down 6.1 boards per game, and
sophomore forward Josh Huestis
grabs nearly 10 rebounds per 40
minutes. Both players, undersized
at their respective positions, have
performed admirably early in the
conference season, most notably
in the Pac-12 opener against
UCLA, a team with a significant
size advantage.
Rebounding has been critical
in preventing second-chance scor
ing opportunities for opponents,
repeated looks that would be fatal
for a turnover-maligned offense
the Cardinal gives the ball away
nearly 15 times per game. Addi

tionally, the team averages less
than one assist per turnover, a sta
tistic that will undoubtedly need
to improve to sustain Stanford's
early-season success but one that
is shockingly not the worst in the
conference.

As in recent years, turnovers
have almost exclusively been the
product of the cliched, careless er
rors. Stanford's young ball-han
dling core has struggled with full
court pressure, reckless dribble
drives and, as demonstrated in the
four-overtime thriller against Ore
gon State, inbounds in decisive
moments. These issues, especially
when attributed to youth, typically
resolve themselves with increased
playing time. But consistent min
utes on any given night are hard to
come by, and Dawkins has been
far from hesitant to make lineup
alterations. Nine players regularly
average more than 11 minutes per
night.
Another glaring issue is the
team's free-throw shooting, a
groan-worthy flaw that is exposed
on a nightly basis. Stanford has
recorded the fifth-most shots from
the charity stripe in the confer
ence but has hit those attempts at
a rate of 67.7 percent. The Cardi
nal plays four guys in its regular
rotation that shoot worse than 65
percent from the line, and oppos
ing teams have been intent to ex
ploit this fault.
But even when factoring in the
free throws and turnovers, Stan
ford is getting it done in the wins
column. The Card is one of four
teams in the Pac-12 with just one
conference loss, a group that trails
undefeated Colorado, a league
newcomer that has shockingly
won its first three Pac-12 games by
a combined 69 points. It's unlikely
that the Buffaloes will maintain
this torrid pace, leaving the door
wide open for the conference title.
"Unlikely" may be an under
statement when describing the
Pac-12's chance at securing more
than two bids to the NCAA Tour
nament in March. But aside from
the conference tournament cham
pion, the team currently with the
best shot at receiving an at-large
bid is Stanford. The two losses to
Oregon and Butler sting, but a
five-point defeat against No. 1
Syracuse in Madison Square Gar
den a game in which the Cardi
nal led for the majority of the ac
tion could actually benefit
Dawkins' squad when the selec
tion committee takes a look at its
resume.
First, though, Stanford must
navigate its way through a daunt
ing post-break schedule. The team
receives Utah and Colorado at
home this week before taking on
its toughest road trip of the sea

son, a three-game gauntlet at
Washington, Washington State
and Cal. If the Cardinal is able to
win at least four of those games,
most notably the matchup with
the Bears, then Stanford could see
its first action inside the AP Top 25
and position itself for a berth in
the Big Dance.
Minimizing turnovers and in
creasing offensive efficiency is im
perative, as is cementing a firmer
rotation. Sloppy play often masks
reality, but the talent and coaching
is there. Now it's just a matter of
putting it all together when it
counts.
