# Fiesta no party for Williamson

MICHAEL KHEIR/The Stanford Daily
Redshirt freshman kicker Jordan Williamson had a chance to win the Fiesta Bowl for Stanford, but his 35-yard field goal hooked wide left as time
expired. Williamson missed three field goals, including another in overtime, as the Cardinal fell, 41-38, to Oklahoma State. The loss ends the
careers of all the Stanford seniors, including two-time Heisman Trophy runner-up quarterback Andrew Luck.
