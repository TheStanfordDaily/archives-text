# SWIM TEAMS ROLL
## 
### GEORGE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a three-week break from competi
tion, both the women's and men's swimming
teams dove into the new year with dominat
ing victories over Pacific, winning by respec
tive scores of 162-92 and 159-92.
On the women's side, the Cardinal swim
mers set the tone on the very first event of the
meet, with a 1-2-3 finish in the 200 medley
relay as the Stanford "C' relay team man
aged to beat the Pacific "A" relay team. Stan
ford would go on to finish at least first or sec
ond in 13 of the 14 total events.
Individually, sophomores Andie Taylor
and Maya Dißado and freshman An
nemarie Thayer led the way, each coming up
with two individual event wins. Taylor won
the 200 butterfly and the 500 free, events in
which the top four finishers were all Cardinal
swimmers. Dißado notched a first-place fin
ish in the 1,000 freestyle, winning by 20 sec
onds, and then followed up that performance
with a victory in the 200 breaststroke. Thayer
earned her two wins by sweeping the back
stroke events, touching out her teammates in
both the 100 and 200 backstroke.
Like the women's team, the men's swim
mers took control right at the start, with a 1-
2-3-4 sweep in the 200 medley relay. From
that point on, Stanford never gave Pacific a
chance to bounce back as the top three fin
ishers in all 14 events were Cardinal swim
mers.
The freshman duo of David Nolan and
John Edwards added to their already impres

sive freshman campaigns with respective
triple and double-win efforts. Nolan won the
50 freestyle, 200 backstroke and 100 butter
fly, while Edwards took the 100 backstroke
and 200 individual medley. Seniors Curtis
Lovelace and Chad La Tourette each
chipped in a win in the 100 breaststroke and
500 freestyle, respectively.
Most of the competition that the Cardinal
swimmers faced was against their own team

mates. In the women's 200 freestyle, junior
Natalie Durant held off senior Samantha
Woodward by just one-hundredth of a sec
ond, the slimmest of margins. In the men's
100 freestyle, junior Aaron Wayne touched
out senior Geoff Cheah by less than three
tenths for the win, and in the men's 200 but
terfly, Bobby Bollier surged in the last 50
yards to overtake junior Mack Montgomery
by about six-tenths of a second.

The women's team improved its dual
meet record to 4-1, while the men's team is
still undefeated at 5-0. Next up for the Cardi
nal swimmers is a dual meet against Arizona
State on Jan. 20. The divers will compete at
their own Cardinal Diving Invite this Friday
through Sunday.
