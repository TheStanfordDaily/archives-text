# WRESTLERS COME UP JUST SHORT

### PALANI ESWARAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One thing is certain: the Stanford
wrestling team is ready to go in 2012. The
Cardinal wrestled against No. 9 American
(4-4) at Burnham Pavilion on Sunday, los
ing an incredibly close and hard-fought
match by a final score of 18-17. Despite the
loss, No. 23 Stanford (5-5) did a lot of things
well, and the team has shown resilience de
spite a rough stretch earlier this season.
Every wrestler came out extremely ag
gressive and showed something that has
been lacking this season flow. Early on
in the season, the Cardinal wrestlers would
execute one move at a time, which, when

defended properly, would not lead to
points. On Sunday, however, the wrestlers
showed a determination to go from one
move to another. There were numerous re
versals and shots that were immediately
converted into pinning combinations.
The Cardinal's winning wrestlers were
No. 9 junior Ryan Mango by major decision
at 133 pounds, redshirt sophomore Bret
Baumbach at 165 pounds, No. 1 redshirt
senior Nick Amuchastegui by major deci
sion at 174 pounds, redshirt junior Spence
Patrick at 184 pounds and sophomore Dan
Scherer at heavyweight.
The Eagles got off to a fast start, winning
four of the first five matches. The only win
for the Card in that stretch came from
Mango, who is now 19-5 on the season and

10-0 in dual meets. But the Stanford
wrestlers battled back, winning four of the
final five matches and almost overcoming a
10-point deficit.
Those four wins exemplified how good
the team can be. In particular, Baumbach
wrestled extremely well. On neutral, he
took good shots and showed great defense.
He was able to scramble out of situations
both on his feet and on the mat to score at
crucial periods in the bout.
Amuchastegui looked very impressive
and showed why he is the top-ranked
wrestler in his weight class. On his feet, he
worked an array of shots, including a
smooth sweep single-leg and a deadly quick
high-crotch. Amuchastegui was dominant
on top, and if his opponent hadn't continu

ally fled the mat, Amuchastegui would
have surely registered near-fall points and
earned a technical fall, which awards five
points to the winning wrestler's team if that
wrestler is beating his opponent by 15
points.
Patrick came out and immediately es
tablished that he was the aggressor. He con
stantly shot throughout the match, and his
high-crotch was extremely successful. His
opponent was called for stalling numerous
times as Patrick asserted his will.
But perhaps no wrestler showed as
much determination as Scherer. His oppo
nent, Blake Herrin, was far bigger than he,
and it looked as if Scherer was going to
