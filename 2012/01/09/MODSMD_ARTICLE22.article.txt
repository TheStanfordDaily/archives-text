## Report finds pensions underfunded in Calif. 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
A recent study published by
the Stanford Institute for Eco
nomic Policy Research (SIEPR)
estimated that the state of Cali
fornia has underfunded public
pensions anywhere from $498 bil
lion to $142.6 billion, depending
on assumed rates of return on in
vestments.

The report authored by
public policy professor Joe Na
tion, with assistance by California
Common Sense researcher Evan
Storms 'l3 concluded that the
state should both reduce retire
ment benefits for current govern
ment employees and work to
overhaul California's public pen
sion system. The study looked at
the California Public Employees
Retirement System (CaIPERS),
California State Teachers Retire
ment System (CaISTRS) and the
University of California Retire
ment Plan (UCRP).
California State Treasurer Bill
Lockyer, who had previously
agreed to serve on a SIEPR pen
sion advisory panel, resigned
from his position on the panel in
protest of the recent study. In a
Dec. 25 op-ed published in the
Sacramento Bee, Lockyer called
SIEPR a "Wall Street-supported
think tank" and argued that the
assumptions Nation used in the
study for investment returns had
exaggerated the amount of un
funded liability for pensions.
The SIEPR study, titled, "Pen
sion Math: How California's Re
tirement Spending is Squeezing
the State Budget," stated that
based on a "more realistic 6.2 per
cent rate of return," public pen
sions were underfunded by $290.6
billion, or $24,000 per California
household. The report also calcu
lated the amount of unfunded lia
bility using different assumptions
for investment returns: pensions
were underfunded by $498 billion
using a 4.5 percent "risk-free" rate
and by $142.6 billion using a 7.5 to
7.75 percent rate.
In a Dec. 16 op-ed published in
the Sacramento Bee, Nation said
that the study used a 6.2 percent
rate of return because it is the
"long-term historical average for
investors allocating capital in the
same manner as pension funds."
Lockyer, however, noted in his

Op-ed that over the past 20 years,
CaISTRS' annual average rate of
return has been 8.1 percent, and
UCRP's annual average has been
8.97 percent. He said that Nation
had used a "'black-box' portfolio
to cook up different numbers that
serve his purpose" and called the
result "beyond reproach."
Nation, who has previously
served as Democratic state as
semblyman, disagreed in his op
ed, calling Lockyer's insistence on
a higher assumption for invest
ment returns "precisely the rea
son that pension systems find
themselves in poor shape today."
"Had they assumed lower,
more realistic returns in the past,
increased contributions would
have improved their funded posi
tions today," Nation said.
Nation also argued that
CaIPERS and CaISTRS would
need to earn an average rate of re
turn of more than 12 percent in
order to ensure that these pension
systems were fully funded.
"That level of long-term return
is Bernie Madoff territory," Na
tion said.
While admitting that that the
current system for public pen
sions is "too expensive and politi
cally unsustainable," Lockyer dis
agreed with the study's conclu
sion that benefits for current gov
ernment employees should be
mandatorily reduced. He added
that the state should find ways to
entice current workers to move
voluntarily to a plan that would
save taxpayers' money instead.
"Government doesn't get to
break its promises to workers who
earn their pay and benefits,"
Lockyer said, calling the action
"unconstitutional" and compar
ing it to the state refusing to pay
interest to its bondholders.
California Governor Jerry
Brown has recently been defend
ing a plan for pension reform that
was initially proposed in October,
which would raise the retirement
age for future government em
ployees from 55 to 67 and partial
ly enroll workers in a 401(k)-style
plan.
The SIEPR study concluded
that "Brown's reform plan is a
needed step in the right direction"
but that it is "likely to reduce the
unfunded shortfall by a small
amount" and "additional reforms
are required," according to a
press release.
This report was the first in a
three-part series on pensions. The
second report, which was pub
lished on Dec. 14, concerned San
Jose's federated and safety pen

sion systems, similarly finding
them underfunded. The third re
port, on independent pension sys
tems, was originally scheduled to
be published on Dec. 15, accord
ing to the press release. However,
according to the SIEPR website,
the release of this study has been
delayed until "early- to mid- Jan
uary" to include "detailed visual
izations."

sion Math: How California's Re
tirement Spending is Squeezing
the State Budget," stated that
based on a "more realistic 6.2 per
cent rate of return," public pen
sions were underfunded by $290.6
billion, or $24,000 per California
household. The report also calcu
lated the amount of unfunded lia
bility using different assumptions
for investment returns: pensions
were underfunded by $498 billion
using a 4.5 percent "risk-free" rate
and by $142.6 billion using a 7.5 to
7.75 percent rate.
In a Dec. 16 op-ed published in
the Sacramento Bee, Nation said
that the study used a 6.2 percent
rate of return because it is the
"long-term historical average for
investors allocating capital in the
same manner as pension funds."
Lockyer, however, noted in his

Op-ed that over the past 20 years,
CaISTRS' annual average rate of
return has been 8.1 percent, and
UCRP's annual average has been
8.97 percent. He said that Nation
had used a "'black-box' portfolio
to cook up different numbers that
serve his purpose" and called the
result "beyond reproach."
Nation, who has previously
served as Democratic state as
semblyman, disagreed in his op
ed, calling Lockyer's insistence on
a higher assumption for invest
ment returns "precisely the rea
son that pension systems find
themselves in poor shape today."
"Had they assumed lower,
more realistic returns in the past,
increased contributions would
have improved their funded posi
tions today," Nation said.
Nation also argued that
CaIPERS and CaISTRS would
need to earn an average rate of re
turn of more than 12 percent in
order to ensure that these pension
systems were fully funded.
"That level of long-term return
is Bernie Madoff territory," Na
tion said.
While admitting that that the
current system for public pen
sions is "too expensive and politi
cally unsustainable," Lockyer dis
agreed with the study's conclu
sion that benefits for current gov
ernment employees should be
mandatorily reduced. He added
that the state should find ways to
entice current workers to move
voluntarily to a plan that would
save taxpayers' money instead.
"Government doesn't get to
break its promises to workers who
earn their pay and benefits,"
Lockyer said, calling the action
"unconstitutional" and compar
ing it to the state refusing to pay
interest to its bondholders.
California Governor Jerry
Brown has recently been defend
ing a plan for pension reform that
was initially proposed in October,
which would raise the retirement
age for future government em
ployees from 55 to 67 and partial
ly enroll workers in a 401(k)-style
plan.
The SIEPR study concluded
that "Brown's reform plan is a
needed step in the right direction"
but that it is "likely to reduce the
unfunded shortfall by a small
amount" and "additional reforms
are required," according to a
press release.
This report was the first in a
three-part series on pensions. The
second report, which was pub
lished on Dec. 14, concerned San
Jose's federated and safety pen

sion systems, similarly finding
them underfunded. The third re
port, on independent pension sys
tems, was originally scheduled to
be published on Dec. 15, accord
ing to the press release. However,
according to the SIEPR website,
the release of this study has been
delayed until "early- to mid- Jan
uary" to include "detailed visual
izations."

A recent study published by
the Stanford Institute for Eco
nomic Policy Research (SIEPR)
estimated that the state of Cali
fornia has underfunded public
pensions anywhere from $498 bil
lion to $142.6 billion, depending
on assumed rates of return on in
vestments.

The report authored by
public policy professor Joe Na
tion, with assistance by California
Common Sense researcher Evan
Storms 'l3 concluded that the
state should both reduce retire
ment benefits for current govern
ment employees and work to
overhaul California's public pen
sion system. The study looked at
the California Public Employees
Retirement System (CaIPERS),
California State Teachers Retire
ment System (CaISTRS) and the
University of California Retire
ment Plan (UCRP).
California State Treasurer Bill
Lockyer, who had previously
agreed to serve on a SIEPR pen
sion advisory panel, resigned
from his position on the panel in
protest of the recent study. In a
Dec. 25 op-ed published in the
Sacramento Bee, Lockyer called
SIEPR a "Wall Street-supported
think tank" and argued that the
assumptions Nation used in the
study for investment returns had
exaggerated the amount of un
funded liability for pensions.
