### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellora Israni 
Professor emeritus of mathe
matics Robert Osserman died at
his Berkeley home Nov. 30. He was
84.

Osserman joined the Stanford
faculty in 1955. He served as the
Department of Mathematics chair
from 1973 to 1979 and the Andrew
W. Mellon chair of interdiscipli
nary studies from 1987 to 1990. In
the early 1980s, he helped found
the Mathematical Services Re
search Institute in Berkeley. He
served as its deputy director from
1990 to 1995 and helped it become
one of the world's premier re
search institutions for mathemat
ics.
Osserman's early research fo
cused on Riemann surfaces and
complex analysis. Throughout his
career, he conducted ground
breaking analysis of "minimal sur
faces," a geometric concept known
for its fundamental significance as
well as beauty. His "Survey of Min
imal Surfaces," first published in
1969, remains a classic reference
text in the field.
Osserman received his Ph.D.
from Harvard. Throughout his ca
reer, he held visiting appointments
at the University of Colorado, the
Courant Institute, Harvard and the
University of California, Berkeley.
He was a recipient of the Guggen
heim and Fulbright fellowships.
From 1960 to 1961, he headed up
Washington, D.C.'s Mathematics
branch of the Office of Naval Re
search.
He authored or co-authored
over 70 research papers and served
as a thesis supervisor for nine grad
uate students. In 1985, he received
the Dean's Award for teaching.
"Bob Osserman was my thesis
adviser, my colleague and my very
dear friend," said Blaine Lawson,
Osserman's first Ph.D. student and
now a professor of mathematics at
Stony Brook University. "He was a
mentor of tremendous influence in
my mathematical development
and on my outlook on mathemati
cal life. He was a man of immense
erudition and personal warmth
and charm."
Osserman worked to make
mathematics more interesting and
accessible. In 1993, he helped or
ganize San Francisco's "Fermat
Fest," a public celebration of the
famous proof of Fermat's last the

orem. In 2010, he published two
papers on the architecture of the
Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Mo.
Born in 1926 in New York City,
he showed early interests in music
and science, which he pursued
throughout his life. He served in
the Air Corps in World War 11.
Osserman had lived in Berke
ley since the 1980s. He is survived
by his first wife, three sons and one
grandchild.
