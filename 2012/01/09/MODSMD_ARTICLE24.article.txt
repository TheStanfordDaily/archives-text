### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellora Israni 
Palo Alto councilman Yiaway
Yeh was unanimously elected the
city's mayor for this year, making
him Palo Alto's first Chinese-
American mayor and the city's
first mayor to have graduated from
Gunn High School.
Yeh, 33, is the second-youngest
councilman to hold the position
and the youngest in 80 years. He
joined the council in 2007.
"I will work hard to keep us fo
cused, efficient and effective as
best as possible so that we can best
serve Palo Alto," Yeh said in a
statement.
Yeh works as an auditor for the
City of Oakland and had previous
ly served in a similar role in San
Francisco. The Palo Alto Weekly
cited Yeh's "patient, deliberative
style" as well as his "mastery of
some of the city's driest but most
critical issues, namely finances and
utilities" as reasons for his election.
"He frequently sees things that
other members of the council, per
haps all of us, have not seen," said
councilman Larry Klein, who
nominated Yeh, in an interview
with the Palo Alto Weekly. "I think
we've all seen that Yiaway is a
careful, deliberate thinker."
In speaking of his agenda for
Palo Alto in 2012, Yeh said he
"couldn't feel luckier." He will
hold a series of "Mayor's Chal
lenges" athletic events to promote
community building in the city. He
said he plans to focus on improving
the city's aged infrastructure, the
efficiency of its services and its
youth services throughout his
term.

Yeh served as vice mayor last
term, contributing to the unanimi
ty of his election. The race for vice
mayor, in which the council chose

Greg Scharff over Greg Schmid,
was closer. After a majority of
council members indicated they
would support Scharff, the council
fulfilled Schmid's request to make
the vote unanimous.
