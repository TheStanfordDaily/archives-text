A Santa Clara County law man
dating health standards for chil
dren's meals accompanied by free
toys has had limited effects, ac
cording to a recent study by the
School of Medicine.
The study, which tracked busi
nesses' reactions to an Aug. 2010
law, documented menus, prices,
restaurant signage and whether in
centives such as toys were being of
fered, among other criteria. Pub
lished Dec. 8 in the American Jour
nal of Preventive Medicine, it
found that restaurants did not in
crease the number of healthy items
on their children's menus, as
hoped.
"This ordinance gave us the op
portunity to study a real-world ex
ample of a private-sector response
to a public health policy," said Jen

study and a postdoctoral scholar at
the Stanford Prevention Research
Center.
"It's true that parents have the
responsibility to seek out healthy
choices for their children," Otten
said. "But, if those choices don't
exist or aren't easily identified for
parents, then we need to explore
the best levers for changing our en
vironment so that they are."
The law prohibits restaurants
from offering incentives such as
toys for meals with more than 485
calories or meals that did not meet
nutritional standards with respect
to fat, salt and sugar content. A
Federal Trade Commission report
found that 10 restaurant chains
spent $360 million on 1.2 billion
children's toys in 2006.
The ordinance mandated that
restaurants either improve the nu
trition of their meals or stop offer
ing incentives. It affected only un
incorporated parts of the county,
and found that, both before and
