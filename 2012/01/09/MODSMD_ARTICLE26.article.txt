# Stanford sailing comes up just short at Rose Bowl Regatta
## 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
Despite a strong showing on
the final day, Stanford's sailing
team finished in second place at
the Rose Bowl Regatta over the
weekend, ending the two-day
event 11 points behind Navy.
Just seven points separated the
second- and fifth-place finishers,
and the Cardinal was hard
pressed to hold onto its position
as St. Mary's College of Maryland
ended the regatta only five points
behind Stanford, which dug itself
an early hole against the Midship
men on day one.

The Cardinal was four points
down after day one and could not
come back in the final day of rac
ing, ending the seven total races
with 72 combined points Navy
finished with 61.
St. Mary's, Georgetown and
the College of Charleston closed
out the top five, and Stanford's
"A" Division team of Kieran
Chung-Wolf and Yuri Namikawa
finished with 29 points, second in
the division after placing between
sixth and ninth over the three
races on Sunday. They finished in
the top nine in all seven races.
The "B" Division team of Sally
Mace and Haley Kirk finished
with 43 points, fifth-best in the di
vision after finishing from first to
11th through the five second-day
races.
The Cardinal will return to the
water on Feb. 11, when it will host
the first of two regional regattas
at Redwood Shores.
