### JOSEE SMITH 
While the introductory com
puter science course CSIO6A
spiked in enrollment fall quarter,
the fundamental introductory
courses in other departments such
as mathematics, chemistry and
economics enrolled a similar num
ber of students as previous quar
ters, according to numbers on

Axess.
CSIO6A enrollment has shot
up from 285 to 594 students from
fall 2007 to this past fall. Mean
while, CHEM3IA numbers in
creased only slightly from 385 to
420, while MATHSI and
ECONIA both decreased, from
400 to 300 and from 460 to 396, re
spectively.

Mehran Sahami B.S. '92 M.S.
'93 Ph.D. '99, associate professor
in computer science, taught
CSIO6A fall quarter and has been
doing so for the past few years.
With regards to the increased en
rollment, which has been notice
able for the past few years, Sahami
wrote in an email to The Daily that
he believes it is due to a combina
tion of factors.

"Certainly the growing high
tech economy and the availability
of job opportunities in computing
is a factor," he wrote. "Another
factor is that computing is becom
ing critical in a variety of areas, as
computers play a larger role in so
ciety ... I think CSIO6A has a
positive reputation on campus and
that causes students to recom
mend the course to their friends."
The next course in the se
quence, CSIO6B, also saw higher
than-expected enrollment for this
