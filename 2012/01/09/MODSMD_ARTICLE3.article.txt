## Students flock to intro CS CS106 series enrollment spikes, other depts constant 
### JOSEE SMITH 
While the introductory com
puter science course CSIO6A
spiked in enrollment fall quarter,
the fundamental introductory
courses in other departments such
as mathematics, chemistry and
economics enrolled a similar num
ber of students as previous quar
ters, according to numbers on

Axess.
CSIO6A enrollment has shot
up from 285 to 594 students from
fall 2007 to this past fall. Mean
while, CHEM3IA numbers in
creased only slightly from 385 to
420, while MATHSI and
ECONIA both decreased, from
400 to 300 and from 460 to 396, re
spectively.

Mehran Sahami B.S. '92 M.S.
'93 Ph.D. '99, associate professor
in computer science, taught
CSIO6A fall quarter and has been
doing so for the past few years.
With regards to the increased en
rollment, which has been notice
able for the past few years, Sahami
wrote in an email to The Daily that
he believes it is due to a combina
tion of factors.

"Certainly the growing high
tech economy and the availability
of job opportunities in computing
is a factor," he wrote. "Another
factor is that computing is becom
ing critical in a variety of areas, as
computers play a larger role in so
ciety ... I think CSIO6A has a
positive reputation on campus and
that causes students to recom
mend the course to their friends."
The next course in the se
quence, CSIO6B, also saw higher
than-expected enrollment for this

winter quarter.
"Over the break, the enroll
ment numbers in CSIO6B shot up
so that there are now 100 more of
you than would fit in the original
ly assigned room," wrote CSIO6B
professor Eric Roberts in an email
to students.
The class has been moved to
Hewlett 200, where CSIO6A was
taught in the fall.
"I was really excited to have
Mehran," said Gabi Greenberg
'l5, who took CSIO6A this past
fall quarter. "I was also interested
in pursuing a CS-related major."
When asked about taking a
class with more than 600 students,
Greenberg said that it was a bit
shocking on the first day that a lot
of people couldn't find seats, but
added that Sahami was "very en
gaging" and that her discussion
section leader helped break down
the material.
Steven Longoria 'l5 said he
took the class because he knew
that he wanted to major in CS and,
while he did not have any experi
ence with computer science be
fore coming to Stanford, he is
even more interested in pursuing
CS as a major after taking 106A.
The Computer Science De
partment made changes this past
quarter in order to accommodate
the extra students. More section
leaders and graders were hired,
which contributed to a greater
number of helpers at the LaIR
computer cluster to assist students
with their programming assign
ments in the course.
"For CSIO6A, we also had the
class lectures videotaped to make
it easier for the students to access
the class material if they had diffi
culty getting seats in the lecture
hall," Sahami added.
Both Greenberg and Longoria

said they utilized online lectures
for review.
"If I didn't understand some
thing in class, I would go online
and watch the lecture again so I
wasn't confused," Greenberg said.
Longoria said that the large
class size didn't really discourage
him from going to lecture; he used
the lectures posted online to help
him understand the material bet
ter.
Sahami added in his email, "the
Computer Science Department
also looks to expand the size of
faculty to help address the grow
ing enrollments in CS courses at
all levels."
In other introductory classes,
such as Math 51, Chem 31A and
Econ IA, enrollment has re
mained steady over the past five
years.
Many of these introductory
courses have, on average, about
300 to 400 students. According to
Roger Kuhn, student services
manager in the Chemistry De
partment, "enrollment for Chem
istry 31A and 318 has been con
sistent over the last few years,"
and continues to meet the expec
tations of the department.
Many students who enroll in
these introductory courses said
they take them because of a desire
to major in something related to
the course, seeking a feel for the
department and major or because
the course fulfills a General Edu
cation Requirement or a prereq
uisite for another major.
The math and chemistry de
partments split introductory class
es into several lectures to keep
class sizes small, while economics
and computer science do not.
"In the case of the 50s courses,
we try to keep enrollments at
most 50 per lecture," wrote Brian
White, professor of mathematics,
in an email to The Daily. "We
never keep students out."

ters, according to numbers on

Axess.
CSIO6A enrollment has shot
up from 285 to 594 students from
fall 2007 to this past fall. Mean
while, CHEM3IA numbers in
creased only slightly from 385 to
420, while MATHSI and
ECONIA both decreased, from
400 to 300 and from 460 to 396, re
spectively.

Mehran Sahami B.S. '92 M.S.
'93 Ph.D. '99, associate professor
in computer science, taught
CSIO6A fall quarter and has been
doing so for the past few years.
With regards to the increased en
rollment, which has been notice
able for the past few years, Sahami
wrote in an email to The Daily that
he believes it is due to a combina
tion of factors.

"Certainly the growing high
tech economy and the availability
of job opportunities in computing
is a factor," he wrote. "Another
factor is that computing is becom
ing critical in a variety of areas, as
computers play a larger role in so
ciety ... I think CSIO6A has a
positive reputation on campus and
that causes students to recom
mend the course to their friends."
The next course in the se
quence, CSIO6B, also saw higher
than-expected enrollment for this

winter quarter.
"Over the break, the enroll
ment numbers in CSIO6B shot up
so that there are now 100 more of
you than would fit in the original
ly assigned room," wrote CSIO6B
professor Eric Roberts in an email
to students.
The class has been moved to
Hewlett 200, where CSIO6A was
taught in the fall.
"I was really excited to have
Mehran," said Gabi Greenberg
'l5, who took CSIO6A this past
fall quarter. "I was also interested
in pursuing a CS-related major."
When asked about taking a
class with more than 600 students,
Greenberg said that it was a bit
shocking on the first day that a lot
of people couldn't find seats, but
added that Sahami was "very en
gaging" and that her discussion
section leader helped break down
the material.
Steven Longoria 'l5 said he
took the class because he knew
that he wanted to major in CS and,
while he did not have any experi
ence with computer science be
fore coming to Stanford, he is
even more interested in pursuing
CS as a major after taking 106A.
The Computer Science De
partment made changes this past
quarter in order to accommodate
the extra students. More section
leaders and graders were hired,
which contributed to a greater
number of helpers at the LaIR
computer cluster to assist students
with their programming assign
ments in the course.
"For CSIO6A, we also had the
class lectures videotaped to make
it easier for the students to access
the class material if they had diffi
culty getting seats in the lecture
hall," Sahami added.
Both Greenberg and Longoria

said they utilized online lectures
for review.
"If I didn't understand some
thing in class, I would go online
and watch the lecture again so I
wasn't confused," Greenberg said.
Longoria said that the large
class size didn't really discourage
him from going to lecture; he used
the lectures posted online to help
him understand the material bet
ter.
Sahami added in his email, "the
Computer Science Department
also looks to expand the size of
faculty to help address the grow
ing enrollments in CS courses at
all levels."
In other introductory classes,
such as Math 51, Chem 31A and
Econ IA, enrollment has re
mained steady over the past five
years.
Many of these introductory
courses have, on average, about
300 to 400 students. According to
Roger Kuhn, student services
manager in the Chemistry De
partment, "enrollment for Chem
istry 31A and 318 has been con
sistent over the last few years,"
and continues to meet the expec
tations of the department.
Many students who enroll in
these introductory courses said
they take them because of a desire
to major in something related to
the course, seeking a feel for the
department and major or because
the course fulfills a General Edu
cation Requirement or a prereq
uisite for another major.
The math and chemistry de
partments split introductory class
es into several lectures to keep
class sizes small, while economics
and computer science do not.
"In the case of the 50s courses,
we try to keep enrollments at
most 50 per lecture," wrote Brian
White, professor of mathematics,
in an email to The Daily. "We
never keep students out."
