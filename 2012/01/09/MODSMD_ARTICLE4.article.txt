## County rejects Alpine Trail funds 
### ILEANA NAJARRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors
officially rejected Stanford's offer of $10.4 million
toward restoration of the Alpine Road Trail on
Dec. 13 with a 3-2 vote. The offer expired on Dec.
31.

The debate over the trail's construction and
the restoration of the existing trail stretching from
Highway 280 to Junipero Serra lasted for a
decade. The county had previously rejected Stan
ford's proposal in 2008 and 2010 but considered it
again on the University's request.
As per a prior agreement, Stanford will now
set up a fund for Santa Clara County to provide
recreational opportunities for campus residents
and authorized users of Stanford facilities.

Larry Horton, Stanford senior associate vice
president and director of government and com
munity relations, said that for now, Stanford stu
dents and local residents would have to continue
to use the existing trail.
RJ. Utz, professor in the School of Medicine,
said that the issue of the existing trail is still rele
vant.

"It ends for Stanford in many ways, but it does
n't end for those of us who live in the area that's
affected, and we're not about to let it end at this
point," he said.
San Mateo County Supervisor Dave Pine, who
voted to accept Stanford's offer, said the board is
aware of the dangerous conditions of the existing
trail. The stretch is adjacent to a road used by an
average of 25,000 cars a day driving at fast speeds
and has seen a cyclist's death at the Highway 280
interchange.
"The specific vote was as to whether we should
continue to study the matter and again, because of
the serious problems in the quarter, because of
the county's budget shortfalls, I felt that we should
continue those studies," Pine said.

One of the concerns that led to the rejection
focused on whether a trail could be built in the
designated quarter of the county. Residents of
nearby Stanford Weekend Acres have advocated
positioning the trail well away from the neighbor
hood so as to avoid traffic congestion in their area.

At the board meeting where the vote took
place, six options for use of the funds offered by
Stanford were examined.
One option suggested building the trail as a
connection to Pier's Lane from Junipero Serra,
