## County rejects Alpine Trail funds 
### ILEANA NAJARRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors
officially rejected Stanford's offer of $10.4 million
toward restoration of the Alpine Road Trail on
Dec. 13 with a 3-2 vote. The offer expired on Dec.
31.

The debate over the trail's construction and
the restoration of the existing trail stretching from
Highway 280 to Junipero Serra lasted for a
decade. The county had previously rejected Stan
ford's proposal in 2008 and 2010 but considered it
again on the University's request.
As per a prior agreement, Stanford will now
set up a fund for Santa Clara County to provide
recreational opportunities for campus residents
and authorized users of Stanford facilities.

Larry Horton, Stanford senior associate vice
president and director of government and com
munity relations, said that for now, Stanford stu
dents and local residents would have to continue
to use the existing trail.
RJ. Utz, professor in the School of Medicine,
said that the issue of the existing trail is still rele
vant.

"It ends for Stanford in many ways, but it does
n't end for those of us who live in the area that's
affected, and we're not about to let it end at this
point," he said.
San Mateo County Supervisor Dave Pine, who
voted to accept Stanford's offer, said the board is
aware of the dangerous conditions of the existing
trail. The stretch is adjacent to a road used by an
average of 25,000 cars a day driving at fast speeds
and has seen a cyclist's death at the Highway 280
interchange.
"The specific vote was as to whether we should
continue to study the matter and again, because of
the serious problems in the quarter, because of
the county's budget shortfalls, I felt that we should
continue those studies," Pine said.

One of the concerns that led to the rejection
focused on whether a trail could be built in the
designated quarter of the county. Residents of
nearby Stanford Weekend Acres have advocated
positioning the trail well away from the neighbor
hood so as to avoid traffic congestion in their area.

At the board meeting where the vote took
place, six options for use of the funds offered by
Stanford were examined.
One option suggested building the trail as a
connection to Pier's Lane from Junipero Serra,

the trail has lasted over a decade and continues.
thereby completely avoiding
Stanford Weekend Acres. How
ever, according to the agreement
between Stanford and Santa
Clara County, Stanford land
would not be used for the Alpine
Road Trail as Stanford had al
ready built trails in its area using
Santa Clara funds.

Another option included cross
ing Alpine Road heading north to
wards Pier's Lane or a modestly
sized trail along the Stanford
Weekend Acres corner. Pine even
suggested a moderate pedestrian
use-only 4-foot trail along Stan
ford Weekend Acres in order to
appease those with concerns.
In the end, Pine said he be
lieves that the history behind the
debate affected the majority's de
cision, as the three supervisors
who voted to reject the offer had
rejected it once, if not twice be

fore. He also said the county will
continue to look into improving
dangerous conditions on the trail.
"I do think that the process has
certainly shed a light on the ur
gency of updating the quarter,
and I'm sure if the county works
on its budget coming into the next
year and looks at its capital budg
et, we'll be working on what we
can find funds for," Pine said.
In the meantime, Utz and
about 20 other residents involved
in the Committee to Fix Lower
Alpine Trail will begin lobbying
supervisors to obtain the needed
funds to repair the existing trail.
"I think in the end, they did
something that was fiscally irre
sponsible; and I think that now
they're stuck with a trail that has
to be fixed, and they're stuck with
a creek that's eroding into a road
that's going to cost millions of
dollars to fix. I think that that re
ality is going to hit home very
soon," Utz said.
