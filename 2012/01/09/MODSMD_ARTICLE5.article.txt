## Admins elaborate on NYC University explains NYC campus withdrawal 
### BILLY GALLAGHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Administrators responded to
questions about the University's
Dec. 16 withdrawal of Stanford-
NYC, its $2.5 billion proposal to
build a graduate school of ap
plied sciences and engineering in
New York City, in a press release
published on Tues., Dec. 27.
On Oct. 26, Stanford submit
ted StanfordNYC and was con
sidered to be the front-runner,
along with Cornell University, to
win New York City's competition
for a science and technology
campus. After extensive negotia
tions with the city, Stanford with
drew its application on Dec. 16.
Three days after Stanford re
tracted its application to develop
the 1.9 million square-foot cam
pus and two days after Cornell
appended a $350 million alumni
donation to its proposal, New
York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg announced he had
chosen Cornell University's pro
posal to build facilities on Roo
sevelt Island with the Technion-
Israel Institute of Technology.
"During the negotiation
process, the city introduced addi
tional requirements that in
creased the risks and costs for
Stanford and decreased the po
tential benefit," the Dec. 27 press
release stated.

According to the release,
Bloomberg News and The New
York Times, some of these addi
tional matters included city
building regulations and timeline
penalties that the University was
not comfortable with.

"From the beginning, Stan
ford expressed an interest in the
project with the clear under
standing that it had to benefit
both Stanford and New York
City," the release said. "We were
very much hoping for a success
ful outcome, but it became ap
parent that there were areas
where the city and University
were not going to agree. Beyond
the academic part of the propos
al, the project involved numerous
land use, real estate, zoning, con
struction timetables with signifi
cant penalties and other details."
"In a project of this nature, in
volving a significant investment
by both the city and a much larg
er investment by the University,
both sides need to be willing to
accept a certain level of risk," it
continued. "Ultimately, we decid
ed we could not accept the level
of risk that the city wanted us to
accept."
In a speech at MIT in late No
vember, Bloomberg called both
Stanford and Cornell "desper
ate" for the NYC campus and
added that the city would "go
back and try to renegotiate with
each one."
"I applaud the mayor's bold
vision for this transformative
project and wish the city well in
turning that vision into a reality,"
Stanford President John Hen
nessy said in the Dec. 16 press re
lease. "Stanford was very excited
to participate in the competition,
and we were honored to be se
lected as a finalist. We were look
ing forward to an innovative
partnership with the city of New
York, and we are sorry that to
gether we could not find away to
realize our mutual goals."
Stanford spent $3 million on
the proposal in 'due diligence'
toward a project that ultimately
could have cost up to $2.5 billion.
These initial costs included fees
for architects and attorneys. The
University previously estimated
the proposal's costs at $1 million.
Cornell will spend at least $2
billion to build a 2.1 million
square-foot campus that will ac
commodate up to 2,500 students
at a time. Cornell does not expect
to complete the campus until
2043, but students will begin tak
ing classes in pre-existing facili
ties starting next year.
The Dec. 27 press release shot
down any notion that the deci
sion to withdraw was influenced
by Cornell.
"Stanford's withdrawal was
the result of our own negotia

tions and had nothing to do with
Cornell's bid," it said. "Prior to
our decision, there was no sug
gestion on the city's part that
Stanford's bid was not the front
runner in the competition. In
fact, all evidence available to us
indicated the contrary."
"I appreciate the tremendous
effort put forth at all levels of the
University and the city," Hen
nessy said in the Dec, 16 press re
lease. "We are grateful for the
enthusiastic support of the tech
community both in New York
and in Silicon Valley, the efforts
of our alumni and the welcome
we received throughout New
York and from residents of Roo
sevelt Island in particular. We
gained through this process a
fruitful partnership with our col
leagues at the City College of
New York, a partnership that will
strengthen both of our programs
and will continue to benefit New
York City students for many
years to come.
Stanford stated its commit
ment to continue with Stan
ford@CCNY, its partnership
with the City College of New
York (CCNY), to develop a joint
degree program in technology
and entrepreneurship. The Uni
versity also announced that it
will make its proposal available
for public viewing at Green Li
brary, subject to confirmation
from NYCEDC that it may do
so.

appended a $350 million alumni
donation to its proposal, New
York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg announced he had
chosen Cornell University's pro
posal to build facilities on Roo
sevelt Island with the Technion-
Israel Institute of Technology.
"During the negotiation
process, the city introduced addi
tional requirements that in
creased the risks and costs for
Stanford and decreased the po
tential benefit," the Dec. 27 press
release stated.

According to the release,
Bloomberg News and The New
York Times, some of these addi
tional matters included city
building regulations and timeline
penalties that the University was
not comfortable with.

"From the beginning, Stan
ford expressed an interest in the
project with the clear under
standing that it had to benefit
both Stanford and New York
City," the release said. "We were
very much hoping for a success
ful outcome, but it became ap
parent that there were areas
where the city and University
were not going to agree. Beyond
the academic part of the propos
al, the project involved numerous
land use, real estate, zoning, con
struction timetables with signifi
cant penalties and other details."
"In a project of this nature, in
volving a significant investment
by both the city and a much larg
er investment by the University,
both sides need to be willing to
accept a certain level of risk," it
continued. "Ultimately, we decid
ed we could not accept the level
of risk that the city wanted us to
accept."
In a speech at MIT in late No
vember, Bloomberg called both
Stanford and Cornell "desper
ate" for the NYC campus and
added that the city would "go
back and try to renegotiate with
each one."
"I applaud the mayor's bold
vision for this transformative
project and wish the city well in
turning that vision into a reality,"
Stanford President John Hen
nessy said in the Dec. 16 press re
lease. "Stanford was very excited
to participate in the competition,
and we were honored to be se
lected as a finalist. We were look
ing forward to an innovative
partnership with the city of New
York, and we are sorry that to
gether we could not find away to
realize our mutual goals."
Stanford spent $3 million on
the proposal in 'due diligence'
toward a project that ultimately
could have cost up to $2.5 billion.
These initial costs included fees
for architects and attorneys. The
University previously estimated
the proposal's costs at $1 million.
Cornell will spend at least $2
billion to build a 2.1 million
square-foot campus that will ac
commodate up to 2,500 students
at a time. Cornell does not expect
to complete the campus until
2043, but students will begin tak
ing classes in pre-existing facili
ties starting next year.
The Dec. 27 press release shot
down any notion that the deci
sion to withdraw was influenced
by Cornell.
"Stanford's withdrawal was
the result of our own negotia

tions and had nothing to do with
Cornell's bid," it said. "Prior to
our decision, there was no sug
gestion on the city's part that
Stanford's bid was not the front
runner in the competition. In
fact, all evidence available to us
indicated the contrary."
"I appreciate the tremendous
effort put forth at all levels of the
University and the city," Hen
nessy said in the Dec, 16 press re
lease. "We are grateful for the
enthusiastic support of the tech
community both in New York
and in Silicon Valley, the efforts
of our alumni and the welcome
we received throughout New
York and from residents of Roo
sevelt Island in particular. We
gained through this process a
fruitful partnership with our col
leagues at the City College of
New York, a partnership that will
strengthen both of our programs
and will continue to benefit New
York City students for many
years to come.
Stanford stated its commit
ment to continue with Stan
ford@CCNY, its partnership
with the City College of New
York (CCNY), to develop a joint
degree program in technology
and entrepreneurship. The Uni
versity also announced that it
will make its proposal available
for public viewing at Green Li
brary, subject to confirmation
from NYCEDC that it may do
so.

Administrators responded to
questions about the University's
Dec. 16 withdrawal of Stanford-
NYC, its $2.5 billion proposal to
build a graduate school of ap
plied sciences and engineering in
New York City, in a press release
published on Tues., Dec. 27.
On Oct. 26, Stanford submit
ted StanfordNYC and was con
sidered to be the front-runner,
along with Cornell University, to
win New York City's competition
for a science and technology
campus. After extensive negotia
tions with the city, Stanford with
drew its application on Dec. 16.
Three days after Stanford re
tracted its application to develop
the 1.9 million square-foot cam
pus and two days after Cornell
appended a $350 million alumni
donation to its proposal, New
