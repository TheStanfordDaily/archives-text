## Admins elaborate on NYC University explains NYC campus withdrawal 
### BILLY GALLAGHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Administrators responded to
questions about the University's
Dec. 16 withdrawal of Stanford-
NYC, its $2.5 billion proposal to
build a graduate school of ap
plied sciences and engineering in
New York City, in a press release
published on Tues., Dec. 27.
On Oct. 26, Stanford submit
ted StanfordNYC and was con
sidered to be the front-runner,
along with Cornell University, to
win New York City's competition
for a science and technology
campus. After extensive negotia
tions with the city, Stanford with
drew its application on Dec. 16.
Three days after Stanford re
tracted its application to develop
the 1.9 million square-foot cam
pus and two days after Cornell
appended a $350 million alumni
donation to its proposal, New
York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg announced he had
chosen Cornell University's pro
posal to build facilities on Roo
sevelt Island with the Technion-
Israel Institute of Technology.
"During the negotiation
process, the city introduced addi
tional requirements that in
creased the risks and costs for
Stanford and decreased the po
tential benefit," the Dec. 27 press
release stated.

According to the release,
Bloomberg News and The New
York Times, some of these addi
tional matters included city
building regulations and timeline
penalties that the University was
not comfortable with.

"From the beginning, Stan
ford expressed an interest in the
project with the clear under
standing that it had to benefit
both Stanford and New York
City," the release said. "We were
very much hoping for a success
ful outcome, but it became ap
parent that there were areas
where the city and University
were not going to agree. Beyond
the academic part of the propos
al, the project involved numerous
land use, real estate, zoning, con
struction timetables with signifi
cant penalties and other details."
"In a project of this nature, in
volving a significant investment
by both the city and a much larg
er investment by the University,
both sides need to be willing to
accept a certain level of risk," it
continued. "Ultimately, we decid
ed we could not accept the level
of risk that the city wanted us to
accept."
In a speech at MIT in late No
vember, Bloomberg called both
Stanford and Cornell "desper
ate" for the NYC campus and
added that the city would "go
back and try to renegotiate with
each one."
