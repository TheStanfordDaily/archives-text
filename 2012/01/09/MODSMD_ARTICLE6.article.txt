## Trustees approve $438 million energy plan 
### MARGARET RAWSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The University Board of Trustees ap
proved sites for two significant arts buildings,
took action on seven other construction
projects, approved a $438 million plan to
shrink the school's carbon footprint and dis
cussed Occupy Stanford at its second meet
ing of the academic year.

"Arts district" expands

The trustees gave site and concept ap
proval for the Anderson Collection to be lo
cated on the corner of Lomita Drive and

Campus Drive West, north of the Cantor
Arts Center. The collection, donated by
Harry W. and Mary Margaret Anderson and
Mary Patricia Anderson Pence includes 121
works of 20th-century American art by 86
artists and represents movements including
Abstract Expressionism, Color Field Paint
ing, Post-Minimalism, California Funk Art,
Bay Area Figurative Art, Light and Space
and contemporary painting and sculpture.
Before their two-day meeting, the trustees
visited the Anderson family and toured the
collection, which includes some of the fore
most examples of post-World War II Ameri
can art and is one of the most valuable collec
tions to be donated to a university.

The Board also approved a site for the $B5
million, 96,000 square-foot Burton and
Deedee McMurtry building, which will
house the University's art and art history de
partments, contributing to an expanding
"arts district" near Cantor Arts Center in ad
dition to the nearby Bing Concert Hall which
is expected to be completed in 2013. The
$30.5 million building for the Anderson Col
lection is expected to open in 2014, with the
McMurtry building opening in the following
year.
The expansion of the "arts district," as
University administrators have taken to call-
ing it, is a significant milestone in
the Stanford arts initiative.

New campus energy plan

The trustees granted design
approval to the Campus Energy
Systems Improvement project,
which will ultimately replace the
Cardinal Cogeneration plant and
the existing electrical substation,
decrease campus water consump
tion by 18 percent and cut green
house gas emissions in half
with a price tag of $438 million.
The new system will grant the
University "more flexibility as the
energy markets change in the fu
ture," said Leslie Hume, chair of
the Board of Trustees.

The system is expected to be
completed midway through 2015
and would meet the University's
energy needs through 2050.
Under the design, the largest
component of the University's
Energy and Climate Plan, Stan
ford will buy electricity via direct
access to the energy market, build
a new central energy facility to re
cover waste heat from the campus
chilled-water system to meet the
bulk of campus heating needs,
convert the existing central-steam
system to a more efficient hot
water system and build a new and
expanded electrical substation.

Occupy Stanford

The Board also heard a report
from Stanford University De
partment of Public Safety
(SUDPS) Chief Laura Wilson
concerning University response
to Occupy protests.
Hume said that Wilson spoke
to the trustees about how she
works with students "to try and
make sure that they can protest
and make their voices heard."

"She takes free speech and
[students'] power to protest very
seriously and works with them to
make sure they can do this in a
safe way," Hume said, noting that
Wilson was present when Stan
ford students peacefully marched
in solidarity with students from
the University of California,
Berkeley before the Big Game.

Reassurance in light of Penn
State

The Board also spoke about
Penn State, embroiled in contro
versy this fall following accusa

tions of sexual abuse by former
assistant football coach Jerry San
dusky. Hume said the trustees re
flected on lessons from the scan
dal and were eager to hear from
administrators how Stanford cul
tivates a different environment.
"The trustees were interested
in talking to the president and
general counsel about what we at
Stanford did to create and en
courage a culture of responsibility
and good citizenship how we
communicated our expectations
and gave employees and faculty
and staff a message that this is a
place that takes ethics and re
sponsibility seriously," Hume
said.

She added, "It was not a long
discussion, but it was an impor
tant discussion."

Law School update, lab renova
tions for School of Medicine

The Board also heard an up
date from Law School Dean
Larry Kramer and Larry Mar
shall, director of the Mills Legal
Clinic of Stanford Law School,
and toured the new William H.
Neukom Building at Stanford
Law School.
"It makes the law school a real
law-school campus," Hume said
of the new building.
The trustees also gave concept
approval for renovations of two
buildings 3155 and 3165 Porter
Drive currently leased to the
School of Medicine for research.
The renovation costs for the two

buildings are expected to be $19.5
million and $23.8 million, respec
tively.
Following renovations to mod
ernize existing laboratories and
convert office space, the buildings
are expected to house the School
of Medicine Sleep Center, the
Department of Radiology, the
Department of Genetics, the
Stanford Genome Center and the
Center for Personalized Medi
