## Study says everyday pricing more effective 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent study found that
"everyday pricing," defined as con
sistently low prices across all prod
ucts, is in fact more effective than
"promotional pricing," defined as
temporary discounts, in supermar
kets.

The study, entitled "Supermar
ket Pricing Strategies," was co-au
thored by Stanford Graduate
School of Business marketing pro
fessor Harikesh S. Nair as well as
professors Harikesh S. Nair and
Sanjog Misra,both of the Universi
ty of Rochester.
The researchers used game the
ory to analyze the Trade Dimen
sion's "Supermarkets Plus Data
base," which provides information
on every supermarket in the Unit
ed States from 1998 to 2000. A su
permarket is defined by the report
as "a store selling a full line of food
products and generating at least $2
million in yearly revenues," and in
cludes large chains such as Safe
way, Wal-Mart and Kroger.

Common market and econom
ics theory predicts that supermar
kets use pricing strategies as key
marketing tools as they compete
for local customers. These ap
proaches can be labeled as offering
everyday low pricing, promotional
pricing or a hybrid model.
Some chains consistently re
ported either promotional or
everyday low pricing; 73 percent of
Wal-Mart stores, for example, said
that they endorsed the everyday
low-pricing strategy, while only 5
percent of Safeway stores did the
same. Instead, Safeway tended to

ward promotional pricing.
The report explained that su
permarkets tend to choose "asso
ciative matching, which usually oc
curs in settings with ... comple
mentarities." Thus, "firms are able
to increase the overall level of de
mand by matching their rivals'
strategies."
The report argued that the asso
ciative pricing may be explained in
that customers are more likely to
trust retailers when they cooperate
and offer similar strategies to their
rivals, rather than trying to differ
entiate themselves.

"Consumers prefer to receive a
consistent message," the report ex
plained.

The research also found that
certain pricing strategies align bet
ter with certain demographics.
Everyday low pricing "is the
preferred strategy for geographic
markets that have larger house
holds, more racial diversity in
terms of African-American and
Hispanic populations, lower in
come and fewer vehicles per
household" while promotional
pricing "is associated with smaller
households, higher income, fewer
automobiles per capita and less
racial diversity," the study report
ed.

Progressive in its methodologi
cal methods and data set, the re
port said, "incorporating such
postgame outcome data into the
analysis promises to offer newer
and crisper insights into the nature
of competition in the market."
