## VA patients ready to share e-records 
### CATHERINE ZAW 
A School of Medicine study
found that 80 percent of surveyed
Veterans Affairs (VA) patients
are interested in sharing their
health records electronically with
family members, caregivers and
outside providers in order to im
prove their care.
First author Donna Zulman,
instructor in the School of Medi
cine, is also an investigator for the
VA medical system, which want
ed to study its patients' thoughts
about sharing their records. The
VA medical system uses an elec
tronic record system called "My
HealtheVet." The study was pub
lished in the Dec. 20 issue of the
Annals of Internal Medicine.
Zulman conducted the survey
mid-2010, asking a random sam
ple of 18,000 My HealtheVet
users if they were willing to share
some or all of their information in
their public health record.
Almost 80 percent of veterans
expressed interest in sharing in
formation with at least one per
son given in the options, which in
cluded a spouse or partner, child,
other family member, an unrelat
ed caregiver, friend or neighbor
and a non-VA health-care
provider.
Since the veteran patient pop
ulation tends to have multiple
health conditions, "it would be es
pecially beneficial for these pa
tients to be able to share their in
formation with the people who
are helping them," Zulman said in
an interview with the School of
Medicine.

Zulman added that sharing in
formation helps allow family
members who live far from the
veterans to provide support. In
fact, over half of the veterans who
were interested in sharing health
information with a family mem

ber other than a spouse or a part
ner reported that the family
member did not live with them.

Although the majority of My
HealtheVet users are men, repre
sentative of the veteran popula
tion in general, Zulman and her
colleagues found that both men
and women participating in the
survey showed similar interests in
sharing their health records.
Currently, patients have legal
rights to obtain their medical
records on paper by written re
quest, which then allows them the
freedom to share these printed
copies, thus making them able to
share health records non-elec
tronically.
"However, in reality, this
process is cumbersome and ineffi
cient," Zulman said. "[The current
process is] not conducive to rou
tine information-sharing between
patients, their caregivers and their
multiple health-care providers.
[The] procedures have their own
inherent data security risks."
Because of concerns about
data security and privacy, policies
to restrict information in health
care systems, intending to protect
patients from malicious intents,
were created. Changes to system
policies may help facilitate future
health care.
"Electronic personal health
records offer an opportunity to
open these communication chan
nels by enabling patients to view
their information online and
share their information electroni
cally," Zulman said. "Our study
suggests that patients are eager to
embrace this opportunity and
that health-care systems need to
develop applications that enable
patients to easily and safely share
their information."
