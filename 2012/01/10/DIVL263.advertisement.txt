The Stanford Historical Society, the Bill Lane Center for the American West, and Stanford Continuing Studies present
Railroaded: The Transcontinental
and the Making of Modern America
E
Join us for an evening with prize-winning historian Richard White, who will
talk about his eagerly anticipated and now celebrated big book on the epic
construction of the railroads that spanned the American continent in the
1870s and 80s. The story of how the railroads were built has become one
of the nation's inspiring myths, and they transformed life radically,
rearranging forever our sense of space and time.
Nobody tells this story better than Richard White in Railroaded: The
Transcontinental and the Making of Modern America. Fellow American
historian Patricia Limerick wrote, "Railroaded offers flabbergasting views
of the human talent for self-justification and contradiction, provides a
valuable—if unsettling—comparison to the financial troubles of our times,
and shows why the best historians are compared to detectives."
