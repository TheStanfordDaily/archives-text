# Q&A
## Ryan Mayfield, Stanford superfan 
### â€“ Kimberly Bacon 
Ryan Mayfield 'l3 has been featured
on Sports Illustrated and ESPN's
websites as the football fan of the
week. Every Saturday last quarter,
he could be found covered in Cardi
nal gear at Stanford Stadium, and over winter
break, he made his national television debut at
the Fiesta Bowl. The Daily's Kimberly Bacon
caught up with Mayfield to talk about his life as
Stanford's "superfan."
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What inspired you
to become such a big fan?
Ryan Mayfield (RM): I've really always been
a huge football fan. My father is a huge football
fan, so when I was growing up I think I went to
several hundred high school games in my
hometown. When I came to Stanford it was
kind of just a natural progression.
TSD: What's your normal routine before a
game?
RM: My sophomore roommate, Eddy Albar
ran 'l3, and I go to the game together. It's so
much fun going to the stadium because I have
the flag whipping behind me and ... the older
fans milling about are laughing at me. I'm usu
ally in line about three and half hours before the
game.
TSD: Do you think that Stanford fans have be
come more energetic in recent years?

RM: Oh, without a doubt. My best friend's
brother [Class of 'o6] ... talks about how this
year we won more games than his entire time
here. He is a football fan but he never even
cared that much because they always lost. I was
really inspired at the end of the Oregon game.
With four minutes left [and] down by three
touchdowns, the student section was full. I
would like to think that, even if we started los
ing, the fandom would continue at the same
level.
TSD: How would you respond to a claim that
Stanford fans are apathetic and fair-weather
fans?
RM: I don't think we can know that for sure
yet. Obviously if you look at the past 10 years
of Stanford football I would agree with that
when we were terrible no one came and now
that we're good the student section is full. We
are just such a small school that we have a hard
time getting people to create a big following.
So I don't think that question can be answered
yet. I think we are moving in the right direc
tion.
TSD: Were you at ESPN College Game Day?
RM: Yes, I was. I went at about 3:30 in the
morning. It was fun; it was a little crazy. I had
never been to one before. It was cool to see that
many people there, that much passion, that
much excitement for the team.

TSD: How did it feel to be voted a Sports Illus
trated Superfan?
RM: It was a little weird but it was really cool.
I would put it as one of my happiest moments
because it was cool to see that Sports Illustrat
ed was finally caring about Stanford. The fact
that they care about our fans means ... that
they care about our team. And I think that that
is the bigger thing. I don't want it to get to my
head or anything because, whatever, I'm a fan.
TSD: Have you received recognition from the
team?
RM: No, no. I don't know, it would be cool
maybe, but I don't necessarily want it. I'm a
fan. We're sitting in the stadium screaming
while they're getting punched around on the
field. Let's put the tribute where it's due.

It was a little weird but it was really cool. I would put
it as one of my happiest moments because it was
cool to see that Sports Illustrated was finally caring
about Stanford.
