### Nina Chung 
This is going to be a simple col
umn. That is what I have to tell
myself as I sit down in front of
the keyboard and write this column
every week. I know I could spiral ef
fortlessly into the black hole of unin
telligible hyper-intellectuality,
something only possible when we
remove ourselves from real life. I'm
tempted to be over-comprehensive
and cover all theoretical comers to
prevent potential criticisms against
my ideas. But, more than that, I want
to write something clear. I want to be
understandable, in the hopes that
you, my reader, happen to relate to
me. It's nerve-wracking sometimes.
This column is around 800 words on
an interior page of the Tuesday edi
tion of one school's newspaper a
little thing. Yet I still get remarkably
nervous on Monday night about the
next morning's paper. Despite my
desire to express something honest,
something fascinating, something
that I hope benefits everyone, it's al
most too much to expect that I could
accurately share any observation of
our lives in black and white type. Our
very complex lives ...
Here's what is not too complex:
Taylor Swift's music, which filled
my car over winter break. Swift is a
self-proclaimed "boy-crazy country
starlet" that sings about Romeo and
Juliet, being 15, romantic moments
and enchanting first acquaintances.
Her music is crush-heavy, exaggerat
edly dreamy and well-fancied by a
surprising number of my guy-friends
who would love to be a Swift muse.
Overall, though, most would only
blushingly admit to liking Swift, and
shallowly at that. So why did I appre
ciate it so much over winter break?
The past several weeks, I was with a
young woman whom I love and re
gard as my little sister, a girl who has
been navigating certain pressures in
life I'll never know. Unexpectedly,
that music provided random relief as
we held numerous karaoke sessions
on the road. The subject didn't mat
ter it was easy listening. At a time
when all else in her life was hitting
painful extremes, this kind of sim
plicity like board games, trips to
farmers' markets, Zoolander, hand
made Christmas cards meant
everything. It was like interrupting
one's thoughts, often dark and self
destructive, by just breathing.
As we get older, we build increas
ingly lofty infrastructures out of our
lives as we pursue what we presume
will be a better one later. It's not al
ways intentional (unless one chooses
to live apart from society). Like our
evolving schoolwork, from spelling
tests to theses, our personal lives be
come frilled with higher stakes and
bigger consequences. We grow up
feeling obligated to other people and
their standards and expectations. We

have the power to influence their
lives, as they do us. We overanalyze
their opinions even while we muddle
through our own. We make more
choices and supposedly get wiser as
we do. We think a lot, especially
about if and how others are thinking
about us.
But I was thinking about it. . . and
realized that when I'm happiest, I'm
not thinking. In fact, while at peace
and/or laughing hysterically in tears,
I'm sort of mindless. It turns out con
tentment isn't complicated. And
most of us would agree in words, be
fore we turn back to how we actually
live. By now, experience has taught
us that the world is a convoluted
place. And so, voila! We expect com
plexity, so we make create it. And in
away, we feel that's the natural, ma
ture thing to do.
Complaining about busyness has
become a competition in disguise for
so many of us students, when in fact
our greatest difficulty seems to be sit
ting still, alone, quietly. By letting so
many other voices into our heads, it's
now hard to be accompanied by our
own. But many of us have seen, in our
friends and family, how uncontrol
lably this tendency leads to crisis.
This column doesn't aim to explain
all of the ways our lives in this mod
em world are complicated they
undeniably are. This column just
wants to re-appreciate the simplicity
we seem set on abandoning as we
grow older and more expectant of
ourselves and others. I just wonder if,
before we get onto saving the world,
we should recognize when we have
to be saved from ourselves, first.
Goodness, however our personal
ities and passions define it, is some
thing we pursue with every ounce of
academic and extracurricular energy
we have. That's commendable. But
what is true, noble, just, pure, lovely,
virtuous, praiseworthy ... is also the
smallest, most immaterial thing in
the world. That's all I wanted to say.
It's childlike, really which means
it's crucial. As I recall my most des
perate moments and those of the
people I wish I could rescue, I realize
we have to return there to remember
why we choose to live for the next
morning at all.
