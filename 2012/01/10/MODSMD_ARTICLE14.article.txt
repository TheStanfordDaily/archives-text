## Move on to women's basketball 
### Tom Taylor 
MM 11 is not lost.
A
A week after the Fiesta Bowl, I
know it still hurts. Those missed kicks,
those chances lost, a depressing 12-
hour drive home from Arizona in de
feat. But this is sports. When you go
down you don't stay down. You get up
fighting and move on.
I don't mean to trivialize what it
feels like to lose, let alone to lose in that
way. Winning would be meaningless if
losing wasn't so painful. The great
thing about sports, though, is that there
is always another chance. Another
game, another season or even a differ
ent athletic discipline. College football
is dead â€”at least for the next nine
months. Long live college basketball!
The Pac-12 season is already four
games old and Stanford's men's and
women's teams are tied for second and
first, respectively. The women are also
ranked No. 4 in the nation, and though
unranked, the men have been receiving
votes in both the AP Top 25 and coach
es' polls. But I'm going to avoid the ob
vious and not write about the men's
team from here on, partly because
they'll get their fair share of coverage
from other sources and partly personal
bias; I do report on the women's team,
after all.
The cruel reality of the sports world
is that some get all the attention, and so
it is on the Farm with football and
men's basketball. The core of Stanford
fans, the students, rarely make it to any
of the other varsity or club activities on
campus rival students might proba
bly claim we hardly make it to those ei
ther. Perhaps this is because you are ac
ademic overachievers and struggle to
find the time outside of classes and as
signments, but that doesn't really feel
like a good excuse.
Many of the athletes on campus are
professional in all but name, and we get
to go watch them in our backyard for
free. Take senior women's basketball
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike for ex
ample. Over the break, when most of
you were relaxing with family, she
scored 174 points in seven games and
just2o9 minutes ofplay; that's just over
0.8 points per minute. She broke into
the exclusive 2,000-point club last Sat
urday against Oregon State, and she is
on pace to finish second on the all-time
Stanford scoring list by the end of the
regular season, behind guard Candice
Wiggins' school record of 2,629
points.
Many people expect undefeated
No. 1 Baylor to sweep this year, in large
part because of its Naismith College
Player of the Year favorite, 6-foot-8
junior forward Brittney Griner, a play
er who is already on the USA Basket
ball roster. And can dunk. But if anyone
can upset that apple cart, it might just
be Ogwumike. She was named the
United States Basketball Writers Asso
ciation National Player of the Week for
a 42-point, 17-rebound destruction of
No. 6 Tennessee in the final days of
2011 and just seems to be getting bet
ter. Even in the last two contests against
the Oregon schools, in which Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer claimed
Ogwumike might not have been on her
A-game, she averaged more than 30
points per game. But perhaps the best
placed people to comment on her abil
ities are those who have to come to
Maples Pavilion and face her.
"She's obviously an incredible ath
lete," said Oregon State head coach
Scott Rueck after his team's recent loss
to Stanford. "She's got the combina
tion that the greatest players in her sport
have. People come to watch her be
cause she does things no one else can
do. It's not only athleticism and skill,
but she's got this fire and drive in her.
This passion that her whole team can
just jump on."
And to make matters worse for the
Cardinal's opponents, she has a
younger sister on the team, sophomore
forward Chiney.
So when you need a break from
homework this quarter and you're
missing being able to watch the na
tion's best college football player shut
his stuff on Stanford's field every
weekend, come on down to Maples. In
tight games the Cardinal could certain
ly do with your support, and players
like the Ogwumikes deserve it with
their skill and commitment. But more
than that, you can erase the pain of the
Fiesta Bowl with the dream of NCAA
glory.
