# CARD CRUSHES CANADA
## STANFORD WINS FIRST TWO MATCHES 
### JORDAN GUNNING CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's volleyball team (2-0)
started off its season with two wins this weekend
against the Thompson Rivers Wolf Pack of Canada
(0-2).
With six of seven starters returning including
first-team All-American seniors Erik Shoji and Brad
Lawson the Cardinal went into the weekend
poised to win its two exhibition matches.

The two teams met for the first match at Maples
Pavilion. As the heavy favorites it was no surprise
that the Cardinal won the match, but it was a surprise
when the Cardinal lost the first set to the Wolf Pack.
In the first set of the match, Thompson Rivers
went nearly point-for-point with Stanford and took
advantage of the Cardinal's five service errors and
eight attack errors. A kill from Thompson Rivers'
Krzysztof Orman ended the set and resulted in a 25-
23 Cardinal loss.
With the first set of the season going down as a
disappointing loss, the team came back to win the
following three sets convincingly.
The Cardinal came out swinging in the second
set, easily trouncing the Wolf Pack 25-13. The Cardi
nal had 15 kills in the set to Thompson Rivers' four.
Sophomores Brian Cook, outside hitter, and Denny
Falls, middle blocker, each had four kills in the set.
The Cardinal also managed to hold the Wolf Pack to
a .000 hitting percentage.
The third set was also dominated by Stanford
with a 25-18 score and only one Cardinal service
error.
The final set of the match was another 25-18 vic
tory to net the Cardinal its first win of the season,
three sets to one.
Even with the rocky start, the match was a strong
showing of Stanford's skill. The Cardinal was led by
Cook's 16 kills and Lawson's 12.
On Saturday the teams met again at Burnham
Pavilion for their second exhibition match. The Car
dinal swept the match with wins of 25-21, 25-16 and
