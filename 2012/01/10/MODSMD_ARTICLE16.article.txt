### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Fresh off a runner-up finish at the College Cup
and just two years removed from leading the
Charlotte men's soccer team to the program's
first NCAA appearance a turnaround engi
neered in just five short years coach Jeremy
Gunn was poised to turn the 49ers into perennial
NCAA contenders.
But when Stanford Athletic Director Bob
Bowlsby came knocking, looking to find a re
placement for Bret Simon, who stepped down in
November after 11 years as head of the Stanford
program, Gunn couldn't say no.
In the 40-year-old Gunn, Bowlsby hired a vet
eran coach with plenty of wins and postseason
success on his resume, although he does not have
much experience.
"Jeremy Gunn has a proven track record of
winning and developing student-athletes and
programs everywhere he has coached," Bowlsby
said. "We are very excited to welcome Jeremy
Gunn as our new men's soccer coach. His teams
are known to be extremely well-organized, deter

mined, hard-working and well-coached."
And conversely, the allure of coaching on the
Farm, despite the Cardinal's spate of up-and
down years since the team's last sustained run of
postseason success in the early 2000s, was ulti
mately too much for Gunn to pass up Char
lotte reportedly made several attempts to extend
Gunn's contract and retain the English national.
"1 am truly honored to accept the position as
the new head men's soccer coach at Stanford
University," Gunn said. "I am excited to begin a
new era of Stanford men's soccer and am thrilled
to be given the opportunity to become a part of
one of the most prestigious universities in the
world."
Growing up in North Yorkshire, England,
Gunn was outstanding at both cricket and soccer.
A member of England's U-17 national team in
cricket, he was also a youth player at Gromsby
Town F.C. and Scunthorpe United F.C. before
coming to the United States to play soccer for Cal
State Bakersfield he went on to become a first
team Ail-American for the Roadrunners.
After graduating from Bakersfield, Gunn
began his coaching career as an assistant at his

alma mater while continuing to play soccer pro
fessionally in the United States he spent sev
eral years with the Chico Rooks Pro Soccer Club
in Chico, Calif, and the North Bay Breakers of
Rohnert Park, Calif, before playing in the United
Soccer League for Nashville and later
Charleston.
He served on both the men's and women's
coaching staffs during his seven-year stint at
Bakersfield, helping the Roadrunners to the 1997
NCAA Division II national championship and an
appearance in the 1995 national semifinal.
The success propelled him to accept his first
head coaching job with Fort Lewis College in
Durango, Colo. There he built a D-II juggernaut,
winning the Rocky Mountain Conference five
times and playing in three NCAA Champi
onships in eight years with the Skyhawks. In
eight seasons, Gunn won an average of 15 games
each year, going 22-0-1 en route to the 2005
NCAA championship.
He picked up right where he left off after ac
cepting the job at Charlotte. During the five sea-
