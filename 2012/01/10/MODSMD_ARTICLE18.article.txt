# Both fencing teams finish in top three in season opener
## 
### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
At Sunday's Western Invitational in Colorado
Springs, Colo., the Stanford women's fencing
team placed second and the men's team placed
third.
The tournament used a best-of-six-match for
mat, and the Cardinal teams went 5-1 and 4-2, re
spectively.
On the women's side, all five
wins were fairly comfortable, as
Stanford won the first five best-of
-27 matches by at least nine-point
margins. However, in the title match,
the Cardinal ran into a buzz saw in
Northwestern, with the Wildcats
winning 25-2 to take the title.
The men had the closest match of
the tournament, barely edging out

UC-San Diego 14-13 after three
blowout wins. Stanford lost twice,
though: once to host Air Force and
once to eventual champion Notre
Dame.
Freshmen led the way for both
teams, as Cameron Lindsay went
14-4 and Jonathan Lee went 13-5 on
the men's side, while Katya Savitsky
was 11-4, Julia Klepner was 12-5
and Lily McElwee was 14-3.
Stanford does not compete again
until the Midwestern Invitational on
Feb. 4.
