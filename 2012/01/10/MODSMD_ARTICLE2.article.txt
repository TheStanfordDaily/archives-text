# CCNY partnership will'absolutely continue'

### CATHERINE ZAW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In spite of Stanford's decision to withdraw its
application from the competition to build an ap
plied science campus in New York City, the Uni
versity's partnership with the City College of
New York (CCNY) will "absolutely continue,"
according to a recent University press release,
which also stated the two schools would be "mov
ing forward with a joint development of an under
graduate curriculum in entrepreneurship."

Stanford submitted a bid to build a $2.5 billion
graduate school of applied science and engineer
ing on Roosevelt Island at the end of last October,
responding to the New York City Economic De
velopment Corporation's (NYCEDC) request
for proposals. Two weeks before Stanford un
veiled its final proposal, the University an

nounced that it had partnered with CCNY, which
would have temporarily hosted Stanford's aca
demic program by providing space for faculty
and classes until the proposed Roosevelt Island
campus was completed.
Instead, Stanford withdrew from the contest in
mid-December. Three days later, Mayor Michael
Bloomberg announced that NYCEDC had select
ed a joint proposal prepared by Cornell Universi
ty and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology as
the winner.
CCNY was not involved in Stanford's deci
sion to withdraw its application, according to
CCNY officials. CCNY President Lisa Coico
joined Stanford President John Hennessy and
other Stanford administrators in the first-round
interview with NYCEDC, but CCNY was not in
volved in the subsequent negotiation process with
the city, which was handled by a smaller Stanford

team. Stanford also prepared its final proposal in
dependently from CCNY.
CCNY officials said they are disappointed
that the partnership as initially envisioned
through the Roosevelt Island bid could not go for
ward, but also said that they are prepared to play
a significant role in enabling Stanford to create a
robust presence in New York City through other
means, stating that CCNY would be willing to
provide on-campus space and other amenities
necessary for Stanford to accomplish that goal.
Mary Edmondson, the vice president for com
munications at CCNY, said that the continued
"partnership [with Stanford] will provide trans
formational opportunities for our students and our
faculty scholars. Reciprocally, we will be able to
provide research opportunities for Stanford stu
dents and faculty in New York City."
Stanford and CCNY have built a strong part

nership that isn't directly related to the proposal
for the Roosevelt Island campus, according to of
ficials at both universities, who said a by-product
of this collaboration is the continued develop
ment of a joint curriculum. Like all university cur
ricula, the curriculum of this program would be
developed by faculty and then reviewed by the
appropriate faculty senate and senior institutional
leaders at each of the respective institutions.
"We are still having conversations about how
that might be possible without a Stanford faculty
presence in New York City," said Lisa Lapin, as
sistant vice president for university communica
tions at Stanford, in an email to The Daily.
Under the Roosevelt Island bid, "the best un
dergraduate engineering students" at CCNY
would have been able to apply during their junior
