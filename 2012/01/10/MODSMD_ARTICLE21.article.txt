### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Margaret Rawson 
The Stanford Libraries have part
nered with the principal municipal li
brary of Bologna, Italy, and the Istitu
to per i beni culturali della Regione
Emilia-Romagna to grant public ac
cess to the papers of Europe's first fe
male professor, Laura Bassi, an 18th
century Italian scientist. The institu
tions will work together to scan
Bassi's archives, which include
6,000 pages documenting her life and
work.
The documents, which are now in
the archives of the Biblioteca Comu
nale dell'Archiginnasio in Bologna,
will become accessible online later
this year. Stanford will assist in cre
ating an easily searchable website to
grant public access to the documents,
which will be translated and ex
plained.
The second woman to receive a
university degree in Europe, Bassi
lived from 1711 to 1778 and was
known for conducting experiments
in her home with her husband, also
a scientist. Bassi was the first
woman to be offered an official
teaching position in a European
university.
"As an erstwhile student of Italian
archival material, I am very pleased
that Stanford is working with the
Archiginnasio to bring the Bassi ma
terial to a wider audience," said Stan
ford University librarian Michael A.
Keller in a statement to The Stanford
Report.
