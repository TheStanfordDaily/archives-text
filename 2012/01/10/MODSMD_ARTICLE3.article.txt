## High-speed rail meets roadblocks Peer group advises state legislature to not approve the release of funds 
### JAMIE KIM 
Concerns about the feasibility of funding Cal
ifornia's high-speed rail (HSR) project led a peer
review group to conclude last Tuesday that the
state legislature should not approve the release of
billions of dollars of state bond money to fund the
first phase of construction.
The California High-Speed Rail Peer Review
Group, consisting of renowned transportation and
financial experts, was commissioned by Proposi
tion 1A to advise lawmakers on the rail plan,
which would connect Northern and Southern Cal
ifornia by a 520-mile-long high-speed bullet train
that would travel between San Francisco and Los
Angeles in two hours and 40 minutes.
Since first being approved by voters in 2008,
the rail plan has come under increasing fire for in
accurate estimates of cost and potential ridership.
Last November, California's High-Speed Rail
Authority released a new business plan, which es
timated that the train would cost around $9B bil
lion, almost triple the $33 billion estimate that
voters were given when the plan was first ap
proved.
A study published in October 2010 by Stan
ford management professor Alain Enthoven,
former World Bank analyst William Grindley
and Silicon Valley financial consultant William
Warren concluded that based on the history of
high speed rail projects around the world, "there
is little if any chance the system will pay for it
self." The study further reported that the train
would be lucky to draw 10 million riders, a mere
fraction of the 90 million figure that was initial-
ly sold to voters.
According to Enthoven, in an
email to The Daily, the California
High-Speed Rail Authority recently
published a 2012 draft business plan
that raised their estimated costs for
the segment connecting San Francis
co to Los Angeles "from $43 billion
to some $98.5 to $ll7 billion." En
thoven wrote that "this is based on 15
percent completion of engineering
work, far front enough to have a truly
reliable estimate. Histories of other
mega projects suggest the total even
tual costs could exceed $l5O bil
lion."
Enthoven is currently studying
the 2012 business plan and aims to
complete an analysis by Jan. 16.
Last November, Palo Alto City
Council members were unanimous
in their opposition to the proposed
high-speed rail. The council voted 8-
1 to charge its Rail Committee with
drafting a request to the state legisla
ture to either abandon the project or
put it in the Nov. 2012 ballot for re
consideration.
According to an article in the San
Jose Mercury News, Larry Klein, a
Palo Alto city councilman and the
sole dissenting vote, said that the
council "knew enough and that fur
ther input from the Rail Committee
wasn't necessary to take a formal
stand."
Klein, who chairs the city coun
cil's Rail Committee, wrote in an
email to The Daily that he voted in
dissent because he wanted the full
council, which was already unani
mously against the rail plan, itself to
take action rather than refer the mat
ter back to the state legislature.
Klein said that "voters now real

ize that what they voted for was a mi
rage. As the recent field poll shows,
the voters would today overwhelm
ingly reject the HSR proposal. The
estimated cost hasn't really in
creased. Many people knew the orig
inal estimated costs using the
HSR Authority's own internal num
bers were unrealistically low.
What has changed is that the HSR
Authority, faced with a barrage of
criticism, finally acknowledged
more reasonable cost numbers."
The city council last acted on the
matter at a meeting on Dec. 19, when
its Rail Committee drafted a formal
written opposition to the rail project.
The position, adopted by the full city
council, was transmitted to state leg
islators and Governor Jerry Brown,
among others.
"It basically cites HSR's exorbi
tant cost, its overestimated ridership,
the misleading information provided
the voters in 2008 and the environ
mental damage HSR would cause as
the reasons for our opposition,"
Klein wrote.
The project has encountered
other setbacks as well. In November,
a state judge ruled that that the High-
Speed Rail Authority would have to
reopen and revise its environmental
analysis after a lawsuit was brought
forth by a coalition that included
Menlo Park, Atherton and Palo Alto.
The cities, in coalition with vari
ous nonprofit groups, first chal
lenged the Rail Authority's selection
of the Pacheco Pass as the placement
of the San Francisco-Los Angeles
line three years ago, contending that
that the rail authority failed to suffi
ciently analyze the traffic impacts of
the proposed line at Monterey High
way south of San Jose.
The ruling created an additional
setback for the rail authority, which
was forced to further revise its pro
gram-level Environmental Impact
Report.

The high-speed train project is of
particular interest to Stanford, which
owns 36.2 acres of land along the rail
corridor in Menlo Park and Palo
Alto. A statement issued by the Uni
versity in June 2010 details Stan
ford's various interests in the align
ment of the train. Primary among
those concerns are "improved opera
tion and viability of Caltrain," "the
economic effect of taking or impact
ing University lands" and "the trans
portation effect/impact of any newly
created physical barriers between
Stanford and the surrounding com
munities."
On the possibility of a high-speed
train station in Palo Alto, the state
ment, while acknowledging the po
tential economic benefits and in
creased ease of travel to Palo Alto
businesses and to some of the busi
nesses currently on Stanford-owned
lands, brings up that Palo Alto and its
neighboring areas "have very little
available traffic and parking capacity
for such a facility." The statement ex
pressly states, "a station for HSR
would not, in our view, constitute a
priority justifying further reduction
of this limited capacity."
Stanford Director of Land Use
and Environmental Planning Charles
Carter, who represents Stanford on
the City of Palo Alto Rail Corridor
Task Force, said that the University's
fundamental position remains un
changed.
"Protecting residential uses, im
proving connections through the cor
ridor and identifying opportunities to
develop supporting civic and com
mercial uses in the corridor were the
big ideas, along with design en
hancements to the primary roadways
in the corridor to make them 'com
plete streets' that serve all modes of
travel," Carter said.
