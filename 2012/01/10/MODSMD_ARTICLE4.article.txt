## Research links protein complex with pancreatic cancer 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Melody Wong 
A recent study by researchers at the Stanford
School of Medicine indicates that a protein com
plex called SWI/SNF could play a previously un
suspected role in slowing the growth of pancreatic
cancer cells.
The study, which was published on Monday in
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sci
ences, used samples of 70 different pancreatic can
cers, which were provided by the Sol Goldman
Pancreatic Cancer Research Center at the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine. In one
third of these 70 cases, at least one subunit of the
multiunit SWI/SNF protein complex was deleted,
mutated or rearranged.
Forty-eight of the cancer cases used in the
study were primary samples from human patients,
then implanted into immune-deficient mice. The
other 22 cases were grown in the laboratory.
Using a technique called array-comparative
genomic hybridization, which involves using a
single-stranded DNA to seek and bind to its mir
ror image, researchers were able to pinpoint all
the disparities in the genome between normal and
cancerous pancreatic epithelial cells. Researchers
discovered that genes for individual subunits of
SWI/SNF were altered sto 10 percent of the time.
