## Research links protein complex with pancreatic cancer 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Melody Wong 
A recent study by researchers at the Stanford
School of Medicine indicates that a protein com
plex called SWI/SNF could play a previously un
suspected role in slowing the growth of pancreatic
cancer cells.
The study, which was published on Monday in
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sci
ences, used samples of 70 different pancreatic can
cers, which were provided by the Sol Goldman
Pancreatic Cancer Research Center at the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine. In one
third of these 70 cases, at least one subunit of the
multiunit SWI/SNF protein complex was deleted,
mutated or rearranged.
Forty-eight of the cancer cases used in the
study were primary samples from human patients,
then implanted into immune-deficient mice. The
other 22 cases were grown in the laboratory.
Using a technique called array-comparative
genomic hybridization, which involves using a
single-stranded DNA to seek and bind to its mir
ror image, researchers were able to pinpoint all
the disparities in the genome between normal and
cancerous pancreatic epithelial cells. Researchers
discovered that genes for individual subunits of
SWI/SNF were altered sto 10 percent of the time.
According to the study, the link
between the mutations in the
SWI/SNF protein complex and pan
creatic cancer had not been encoun
tered in the past because these genet
ic differences are spread amongst the
five different subunits of the protein
complex. Researchers said it was not
until the data was considered togeth
er that they realized more than a third
of the cancer samples contained a
deletion, mutation or rearrangement
in at least one of the five subunits in
the protein complex.
"This is really strong genetic evi
dence that this complex plays a role in
pancreatic cancer," said Jonathan Pol
lack, associate professor of pathology
and senior author of the research, in a
press release by the School of Medi
cine. "It suggests the influence of the
SWI/SNF complex is on par with that
of other well-known tumor suppres
sors, such as p53."
Upon this discovery, researchers
then experimented by engineering
the pancreatic cancer cell to re-ex
press the altered subunit. They found
that the artificial expression slowed
the growth of the cancer cells and
even caused them to enter a perma
nent suspended state instead of divid
ing wildly.
According to the press release, the
researchers now plan on working to
identify which particular genes are
responsible for the growth of pancre
atic cells by experimenting with the
expression of genes on the SWI/SNF
subunits.
Graduate student Hunter Shain is
the first author of the study. Other
contributors include graduate student
Craig Giacomini and former patholo
gy resident Karen Matsukuma.
