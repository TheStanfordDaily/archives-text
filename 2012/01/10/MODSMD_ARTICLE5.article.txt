## Fiesta Bowl sells out ticket allotment Ticket sales grow from last year, but Fiesta not more profitable 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ticket sales for this year's Fiesta Bowl far
exceeded those from last year's Orange Bowl,
echoing the desire of Stanford fans to see An
drew Luck play his last college game, as he led
the No. 4 Cardinal against No. 3 Oklahoma
State.
"We got the same allotment of tickets
17,500 from each bowl," said Brian Talbott,
senior associate director and CFO for Stanford
Athletics. "We sold out in less than a week for
the Fiesta Bowl, and last year, for the Orange
Bowl, we actually did not sell out. Ever."
Since Stanford sells bowl tickets for the
same price that it purchases them, any amount
of unsold tickets represents a net cost for the
athletic department.
"There is some reimbursement that the con

ference offers us for unsold tickets," Talbott
said. "So we are able to recover some of the
money that way. This year, obviously, we did
n't need to do that since we sold all of the tick
ets... but we don't make a profit on [ticket
sales for bowl games]."
Talbott said he wasn't sure why there was
such a difference between the amount of tickets
sold for these two bowls.
"I would think mostly it's proximity," he
said. "The Orange Bowl is a lot farther away,
and we have a smaller concentration of alum
supporters out there. [For] the Fiesta Bowl,
some people could even drive."
The Cardinal fell in the Jan. 2 Fiesta Bowl to
Oklahoma State, 41-38 in overtime. Last year,
the Cardinal beat Virginia Tech 40-12 in the Or
ange Bowl in Miami, which is more than 2,000
miles farther from Stanford than Phoenix.
Talbott also inferred that "the assumption
that it is Andrew Luck's last year caused some
people to want to see that game," leading to in
creased ticket sales in two consecutive years.
"Our season ticket sales went up ... more

than 50 percent this year as compared to last
year," Talbott said. "Not only were the bowl
sales up, but ticket sales in general for our sea
son were up."
The Fiesta Bowl's success, however, was
not due to a dramatic increase in student ticket
purchases. Talbott said that a little fewer than
1,500 students bought tickets out of the 17,500
provided, adding that the bowl tickets went
"mostly [to] general supporters: season ticket
holders, other interested parties ... [and] gen
eral fans."
Overall, Talbott said, "It ended up being
about as expensive to go to the Fiesta Bowl as
to go to the Orange Bowl. It was a roughly sim
ilar experience for us financially."
Although he said that it was too early to
tell, Talbott is optimistic about next year's sea
son — even with a new quarterback. "We
have some [new season ticket] interest in de
posits for next year, which is obviously posi
tive," he said.
