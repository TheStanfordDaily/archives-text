## SMC continues to diversify its portfolio 
### MARSHALL WATKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Management Company
(SMC) has continued to re-align its portfolio
in response to losses sustained during the re
cent recession, according to SMC president
and chief executive John Powers.
The SMC has attained an annualized re
turn of 9.3 percent over the past 10 years,
with its merged pool including most of
the University's endowment, as well as capi
tal reserves from Stanford Hospital & Clinics
and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
growing to $19.5 billion as of June 30,2011.
However, the height of the recession saw
the SMC sustain heavy losses, with the
merged pool shrinking by 25.9 percent in the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2009. As of the
2011 fiscal year, Stanford's endowment has
not yet returned to pre-recession levels.

"What was really singular about that fis
cal period was that, with the exception of
treasuries, there really was no safe haven,"
Powers said. "All asset classes got pum
meled."
Since then, the SMC has sought to lessen
its exposure in private equity and real estate,
two asset classes that were principal contrib
utors to losses sustained, in the aftermath of
the recession. The SMC's real estate invest
ments had reached a plateau in the years be
fore the economic crisis.
Powers stated that the SMC was looking
to gradually reduce the pace of new commit
ments to both assets until their share of the
portfolio was re-aligned appropriately, but he
emphasized the incremental nature of the ad
justment and the potential for future invest
ments.
Endowment managers at peer universities
have also sought to limit their exposure to

risk. Last November, Bloomberg Business
week reported that Harvard Management
Company, which manages the $32 billion en
dowment of Harvard University, was seeking
to sell $1.5 billion of its holdings in private
equity funds.
"If the question is whether we've lost our
enthusiasm for private equity or real estate,
in the case of private equity, no," Powers
said. "In the case of real estate, we're chang
ing the risk profile of our real estate portfolio,
which probably will never be as large [as the
stake held before the recession], and then
from time to time we'll opportunistically in
crease exposure when the time seems right."
Losses sustained in the recession have af
fected the SMC-'s portfolio composition and
investment philosophies in the years since.
Powers noted a renewed emphasis on invest-
ment diversification and an aversion
to certain asset classes.
"We've increased our exposure
to hedge fund strategies that have
historically shown low correlation
with equities, and we are overweight
with our market allocations in natu
ral resources," Powers said.
The SMC's speedy recovery
from the recession it recorded a
gain of 14.4 percent in the 2010 fis
cal year can be attributed to both
market conditions and SMC invest
ment decisions. Powers stated that
the development of a "very heavy
value credit exposure" was a critical
component in profits generated dur
ing the economic recovery.
Powers said that negative experi
ences with illiquid assets during the
recession had increased the value
that the SMC puts on flexibility
within the portfolio. He acknowl
edged, however, that the SMC is
"still in the process of getting back to
the level of liquidity that we would
like to have."
Extensive exposure to equities,
however, may be necessary to satis

fy the SMC's objectives, Powers
said. The SMC aims to enable the
endowment to pay off approximate
ly 5.5 percent to the University to
cover inflation and to then grow the
endowment's real value. The high
levels of growth expected necessi
tates significant equity exposure, ac
cording to Powers.
"The portfolio will always have a
significant equity component to it,"
Powers stated. "That was the case be
fore the market mess, and that will be
the case going forward too. Within
that, we think we can prudently di
versify and lower our risk, but we will
always have a significant amount of
long-mn equity exposure."
While the SMC currently has a
little over half of its portfolio invest
ed in the United States, Powers stat
ed that in the long run investments
would become increasingly tilted to
wards Asia and other emerging mar
kets.
"We'll look to be broadly reflec
tive of global market capitalization,"
Powers said. "We will continue to
slowly become less and less U.S.-
centric, while recognizing that there
will [still] always be, from time to
time, opportunities."

The Stanford Management Company
(SMC) has continued to re-align its portfolio
in response to losses sustained during the re
cent recession, according to SMC president
and chief executive John Powers.
The SMC has attained an annualized re
turn of 9.3 percent over the past 10 years,
with its merged pool including most of
the University's endowment, as well as capi
tal reserves from Stanford Hospital & Clinics
and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
growing to $19.5 billion as of June 30,2011.
However, the height of the recession saw
the SMC sustain heavy losses, with the
merged pool shrinking by 25.9 percent in the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2009. As of the
2011 fiscal year, Stanford's endowment has
not yet returned to pre-recession levels.

"What was really singular about that fis
cal period was that, with the exception of
treasuries, there really was no safe haven,"
Powers said. "All asset classes got pum
meled."
Since then, the SMC has sought to lessen
its exposure in private equity and real estate,
two asset classes that were principal contrib
utors to losses sustained, in the aftermath of
the recession. The SMC's real estate invest
ments had reached a plateau in the years be
fore the economic crisis.
Powers stated that the SMC was looking
to gradually reduce the pace of new commit
ments to both assets until their share of the
portfolio was re-aligned appropriately, but he
emphasized the incremental nature of the ad
justment and the potential for future invest
ments.
Endowment managers at peer universities
have also sought to limit their exposure to

risk. Last November, Bloomberg Business
week reported that Harvard Management
Company, which manages the $32 billion en
dowment of Harvard University, was seeking
to sell $1.5 billion of its holdings in private
equity funds.
"If the question is whether we've lost our
enthusiasm for private equity or real estate,
in the case of private equity, no," Powers
said. "In the case of real estate, we're chang
ing the risk profile of our real estate portfolio,
which probably will never be as large [as the
stake held before the recession], and then
from time to time we'll opportunistically in
crease exposure when the time seems right."
Losses sustained in the recession have af
fected the SMC-'s portfolio composition and
investment philosophies in the years since.
Powers noted a renewed emphasis on invest-
ment diversification and an aversion
to certain asset classes.
"We've increased our exposure
to hedge fund strategies that have
historically shown low correlation
with equities, and we are overweight
with our market allocations in natu
ral resources," Powers said.
The SMC's speedy recovery
from the recession it recorded a
gain of 14.4 percent in the 2010 fis
cal year can be attributed to both
market conditions and SMC invest
ment decisions. Powers stated that
the development of a "very heavy
value credit exposure" was a critical
component in profits generated dur
ing the economic recovery.
Powers said that negative experi
ences with illiquid assets during the
recession had increased the value
that the SMC puts on flexibility
within the portfolio. He acknowl
edged, however, that the SMC is
"still in the process of getting back to
the level of liquidity that we would
like to have."
Extensive exposure to equities,
however, may be necessary to satis

fy the SMC's objectives, Powers
said. The SMC aims to enable the
endowment to pay off approximate
ly 5.5 percent to the University to
cover inflation and to then grow the
endowment's real value. The high
levels of growth expected necessi
tates significant equity exposure, ac
cording to Powers.
"The portfolio will always have a
significant equity component to it,"
Powers stated. "That was the case be
fore the market mess, and that will be
the case going forward too. Within
that, we think we can prudently di
versify and lower our risk, but we will
always have a significant amount of
long-mn equity exposure."
While the SMC currently has a
little over half of its portfolio invest
ed in the United States, Powers stat
ed that in the long run investments
would become increasingly tilted to
wards Asia and other emerging mar
kets.
"We'll look to be broadly reflec
tive of global market capitalization,"
Powers said. "We will continue to
slowly become less and less U.S.-
centric, while recognizing that there
will [still] always be, from time to
time, opportunities."
