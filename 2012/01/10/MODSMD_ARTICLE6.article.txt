## SMC continues to diversify its portfolio 
### MARSHALL WATKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Management Company
(SMC) has continued to re-align its portfolio
in response to losses sustained during the re
cent recession, according to SMC president
and chief executive John Powers.
The SMC has attained an annualized re
turn of 9.3 percent over the past 10 years,
with its merged pool including most of
the University's endowment, as well as capi
tal reserves from Stanford Hospital & Clinics
and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
growing to $19.5 billion as of June 30,2011.
However, the height of the recession saw
the SMC sustain heavy losses, with the
merged pool shrinking by 25.9 percent in the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2009. As of the
2011 fiscal year, Stanford's endowment has
not yet returned to pre-recession levels.

"What was really singular about that fis
cal period was that, with the exception of
treasuries, there really was no safe haven,"
Powers said. "All asset classes got pum
meled."
Since then, the SMC has sought to lessen
its exposure in private equity and real estate,
two asset classes that were principal contrib
utors to losses sustained, in the aftermath of
the recession. The SMC's real estate invest
ments had reached a plateau in the years be
fore the economic crisis.
Powers stated that the SMC was looking
to gradually reduce the pace of new commit
ments to both assets until their share of the
portfolio was re-aligned appropriately, but he
emphasized the incremental nature of the ad
justment and the potential for future invest
ments.
Endowment managers at peer universities
have also sought to limit their exposure to

risk. Last November, Bloomberg Business
week reported that Harvard Management
Company, which manages the $32 billion en
dowment of Harvard University, was seeking
to sell $1.5 billion of its holdings in private
equity funds.
"If the question is whether we've lost our
enthusiasm for private equity or real estate,
in the case of private equity, no," Powers
said. "In the case of real estate, we're chang
ing the risk profile of our real estate portfolio,
which probably will never be as large [as the
stake held before the recession], and then
from time to time we'll opportunistically in
crease exposure when the time seems right."
Losses sustained in the recession have af
fected the SMC-'s portfolio composition and
investment philosophies in the years since.
