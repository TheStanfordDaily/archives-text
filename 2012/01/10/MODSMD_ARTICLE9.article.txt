## Old Chem A 						glimmer of the future for a symbol of Stanford's past 
### LANAHO SUZANNE STATHATOS 
Stanford's campus is known for,
among other things, its aesthetic
beauty, its rich history and its for
ward-thinking modernity. But the old
chemistry building, with boarded-up
windows and doors, surrounded by a tall chain
link fence tagged with "No Trespassing" signs,
doesn't quite fit with the last of those three. The
building has been unused since 1987, when the
University deemed it a structural and fire haz
ard, and when other old buildings were re
paired after the Loma Prieta earthquake in
1989, Stanford left it a relic. But it may not stay
that way for long.
The old chemistry building, built in 1900,
was the first reinforced concrete building west
of the Mississippi River. It was built on Lomi
ta Drive away from the Main Quad to prevent
the rest of the Quad from being affected by po
tential explosions, according to chemistry pro
fessor Michael Fayer. In its golden days, it
housed beautiful wooden lecture halls, spiral
staircases, student and research laboratories, a
library and administrative offices.
"The old chemistry building had real char
acter," Fayer said.
Then the University built more buildings.
By 1974, when Fayer arrived at Stanford, the
chemistry department had expanded into the
three Stauffer Laboratory buildings west of the
old chemistry building.
Fayer conducts his research using lasers,
which require very stable conditions. When he
arrived at the University, his team was placed
in the basement of the old chemistry building,
where its antiquity proved useful: there were
no vibrations from air conditioners or elevators
to disrupt the tranquil environment needed for
his work. At the same time, the building also
showed signs of deterioration. Asbestos-cov
ered steam pipes lay exposed, and when the
carcinogenic material would occasionally fall

off the pipes, people in HAZMAT suits had to
remove it. The pipes also leaked and Fayer and
his team shared their space with rats, which
scampered across the floor above.
He recalled one particular game that he and
his team played with the rats. "You'd hear this
rat running from one side of the ceiling to the
other," he said. "You'd hear the rat running
along, and at just the right time, you jumped up
and pushed the ceiling up whoom the rat
couldn't stop and would just come falling out
there and would be running around on the
ground."
To end the rodent infestation, the depart
ment tried rattraps. These failed, so they chose
to poison the rats. However, the end of one in
festation led to the beginning of another.
"All the rats died, and then the flies came,"
Fayer said. "We had weeks of dense flies with
in all the rooms ... thousands of flies."
Many faculty moved their offices to the
Mudd Chemistry Building, the Chemistry De
partment's new headquarters built in 1977, to
avoid such conditions. However, Fayer stayed
in the old chemistry building until 1987, when
the University drilled into the building and
found that the rebar that initially supported the
building's frame had corroded to tubes of rust,
making it structurally hazardous. The Univer
sity deemed the building unfit for earthquake
regulations, and shortly thereafter constructed
the Keck Science Building, where Fayer now
conducts his research. Their findings proved
serendipitous, as two years later, the Loma Pri
eta Earthquake struck the Bay Area.

Bob Wheeler, the facility manager for Zone
B (the region of the University where the old
chemistry building is located), and his team
work to keep the public from accessing the old
chemistry building. Occasionally, his team
finds compromised windows and doors, and
they work to secure these access points.
Wheeler believes Stanford hasn't made
changes to the building because "the Universi
ty hasn't identified the funding to make the re
pairs that need to be made to do the seismic up
grade," he said.
Some, like Wheeler, would move to main
tain the building's appearance and recondition
it.
"I've always thought that restoring a build
ing from that era would be a wonderful chal
lenge and great fun," Wheeler said. "It is a
piece of history and the architecture then is
much different from the architecture now."
According to Andrew Herkovic, director of

communications and development at Stanford
University Libraries, the University has dis
cussed turning the old chemistry building into
a library, but no specific plans have been made.
Indeed, Stanford's 2011 -2012 capital budg
et and three-year capital plan lists "Old Chem
istry Classrooms with Library" as a delayed
project for the School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
"To the best of my knowledge, there has
been no architectural programming done on
that prospective library, other than that it would
be poured somehow within the shell of Old
Chem," Herkovic said.
The cost, however, poses a major obstacle
to that path forward. In 1999, University plan
ners and administrators estimated that it would
cost at least $35 million to renovate the build
ing to adhere to earthquake safety standards,

The old chemistry building stands separately
and alone from the rest of the Quad next to
the Oval during the 1 946-47 academic
year. The photo was taken with a Brownie
camera and was likely shot from Hoover
Tower.
Others, like Fayer, argue that keep
ing the building itself intact isn't
necessarily a priority.
"It would be much cheaper to just
tear down the old chemistry building
and build a new modern building,"
Fayer said. "It would never be useful
as a science building. That would be
fabulously expensive, because it just
doesn't have the systems for air han
dling, water and electricity."
Fayer also identified the potentially
toxic problems related to Old Chem. In
the early 1900s, scientists poured raw
chemicals down the drains (a forbid
den practice hi modem labs). These
chemicals festered in the pipes, and
over a long period of time, began to
pemieate the entire building.
"It's my guess that it would be al
most a toxic waste disposal problem
to get rid of what's in the contami
nated wood and all of the stuff that's
in this building . . . the place is so
polluted with 75 years or more of

chemicals."
Instead of trying to save the
building or leave it untouched, Fayer
suggested replacing it with a new
joint chemistry-biology library or
another administrative building, op
timizing the use of the 60,000 square
feet the current structure covers. Al
ternatively, Fayer said he "wouldn't
mind if they just tore it down and
made it into a new grass field." After
"watching it for almost a quarter of
century just sit there, it just seems to
me like something should happen."
However, "it is unlikely that the
University would demolish this
building since it has historical sig
nificance," said Craig Tanaka, direc
tor of the Department of Capital
Planning and Space Management.
No plans have been approved for
the old chemistry building's future,
Tanaka said, but senior administra
tion officials will discuss it during
the upcoming capital plan cycle.
Until then, Old Chem is caught in
limbo.

in all the rooms ... thousands of flies."
Many faculty moved their offices to the
Mudd Chemistry Building, the Chemistry De
partment's new headquarters built in 1977, to
avoid such conditions. However, Fayer stayed
in the old chemistry building until 1987, when
the University drilled into the building and
found that the rebar that initially supported the
building's frame had corroded to tubes of rust,
making it structurally hazardous. The Univer
sity deemed the building unfit for earthquake
regulations, and shortly thereafter constructed
the Keck Science Building, where Fayer now
conducts his research. Their findings proved
serendipitous, as two years later, the Loma Pri
eta Earthquake struck the Bay Area.

Bob Wheeler, the facility manager for Zone
B (the region of the University where the old
chemistry building is located), and his team
work to keep the public from accessing the old
chemistry building. Occasionally, his team
finds compromised windows and doors, and
they work to secure these access points.
Wheeler believes Stanford hasn't made
changes to the building because "the Universi
ty hasn't identified the funding to make the re
pairs that need to be made to do the seismic up
grade," he said.
Some, like Wheeler, would move to main
tain the building's appearance and recondition
it.
"I've always thought that restoring a build
ing from that era would be a wonderful chal
lenge and great fun," Wheeler said. "It is a
piece of history and the architecture then is
much different from the architecture now."
According to Andrew Herkovic, director of

communications and development at Stanford
University Libraries, the University has dis
cussed turning the old chemistry building into
a library, but no specific plans have been made.
Indeed, Stanford's 2011 -2012 capital budg
et and three-year capital plan lists "Old Chem
istry Classrooms with Library" as a delayed
project for the School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
"To the best of my knowledge, there has
been no architectural programming done on
that prospective library, other than that it would
be poured somehow within the shell of Old
Chem," Herkovic said.
The cost, however, poses a major obstacle
to that path forward. In 1999, University plan
ners and administrators estimated that it would
cost at least $35 million to renovate the build
ing to adhere to earthquake safety standards,

The old chemistry building stands separately
and alone from the rest of the Quad next to
the Oval during the 1 946-47 academic
year. The photo was taken with a Brownie
camera and was likely shot from Hoover
Tower.
Others, like Fayer, argue that keep
ing the building itself intact isn't
necessarily a priority.
"It would be much cheaper to just
tear down the old chemistry building
and build a new modern building,"
Fayer said. "It would never be useful
as a science building. That would be
fabulously expensive, because it just
doesn't have the systems for air han
dling, water and electricity."
Fayer also identified the potentially
toxic problems related to Old Chem. In
the early 1900s, scientists poured raw
chemicals down the drains (a forbid
den practice hi modem labs). These
chemicals festered in the pipes, and
over a long period of time, began to
pemieate the entire building.
"It's my guess that it would be al
most a toxic waste disposal problem
to get rid of what's in the contami
nated wood and all of the stuff that's
in this building . . . the place is so
polluted with 75 years or more of

chemicals."
Instead of trying to save the
building or leave it untouched, Fayer
suggested replacing it with a new
joint chemistry-biology library or
another administrative building, op
timizing the use of the 60,000 square
feet the current structure covers. Al
ternatively, Fayer said he "wouldn't
mind if they just tore it down and
made it into a new grass field." After
"watching it for almost a quarter of
century just sit there, it just seems to
me like something should happen."
However, "it is unlikely that the
University would demolish this
building since it has historical sig
nificance," said Craig Tanaka, direc
tor of the Department of Capital
Planning and Space Management.
No plans have been approved for
the old chemistry building's future,
Tanaka said, but senior administra
tion officials will discuss it during
the upcoming capital plan cycle.
Until then, Old Chem is caught in
limbo.

Stanford's campus is known for,
among other things, its aesthetic
beauty, its rich history and its for
ward-thinking modernity. But the old
chemistry building, with boarded-up
windows and doors, surrounded by a tall chain
link fence tagged with "No Trespassing" signs,
doesn't quite fit with the last of those three. The
building has been unused since 1987, when the
University deemed it a structural and fire haz
ard, and when other old buildings were re
paired after the Loma Prieta earthquake in
1989, Stanford left it a relic. But it may not stay
that way for long.
The old chemistry building, built in 1900,
was the first reinforced concrete building west
of the Mississippi River. It was built on Lomi
ta Drive away from the Main Quad to prevent
the rest of the Quad from being affected by po
tential explosions, according to chemistry pro
fessor Michael Fayer. In its golden days, it
housed beautiful wooden lecture halls, spiral
staircases, student and research laboratories, a
library and administrative offices.
"The old chemistry building had real char
acter," Fayer said.
Then the University built more buildings.
By 1974, when Fayer arrived at Stanford, the
chemistry department had expanded into the
three Stauffer Laboratory buildings west of the
old chemistry building.
Fayer conducts his research using lasers,
which require very stable conditions. When he
arrived at the University, his team was placed
in the basement of the old chemistry building,
where its antiquity proved useful: there were
no vibrations from air conditioners or elevators
to disrupt the tranquil environment needed for
his work. At the same time, the building also
showed signs of deterioration. Asbestos-cov
ered steam pipes lay exposed, and when the
carcinogenic material would occasionally fall

off the pipes, people in HAZMAT suits had to
remove it. The pipes also leaked and Fayer and
his team shared their space with rats, which
scampered across the floor above.
He recalled one particular game that he and
his team played with the rats. "You'd hear this
rat running from one side of the ceiling to the
other," he said. "You'd hear the rat running
along, and at just the right time, you jumped up
and pushed the ceiling up whoom the rat
couldn't stop and would just come falling out
there and would be running around on the
ground."
To end the rodent infestation, the depart
ment tried rattraps. These failed, so they chose
to poison the rats. However, the end of one in
festation led to the beginning of another.
"All the rats died, and then the flies came,"
Fayer said. "We had weeks of dense flies with
in all the rooms ... thousands of flies."
