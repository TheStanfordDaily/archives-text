## Senate discusses schedule, LDP 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate kicked off its first meeting of the
winter quarter in the upstairs
lounge of the Nitery at 8:30 p.m. on
Tuesday night with an update from
the Publications Board.The Senate
passed all the spending bills sug
gested by the Board.
Next, the ASSU Executive
Michael Cruz 'l2 and Vice-Presi
dent Stewart Macgregor-Dennis
'l3 updated the Senate on recent
developments within the executive
branch.
The duo informed the Senate of
their selection for a new chief of
staff, Lina Hidalgo 'l3, who was the
chair of the Leadership Develop
ment Program (LDP) under the
previous administration. The pre
vious chief of staff, Emma
Ogiemwanye 'l2, decided to go
abroad this quarter.

The Executive also scheduled a
meeting for the senators and the
Community Action Board to help
foster relationships. Senators have

previously complained that they have
not met their counterparts in the Ex
ecutive branch, and both groups
sought increased communication.
The Senate also struggled to find
a new meeting time for their week
ly meetings. Many senators had
class in the afternoon and night, and
several are Alternative Spring
Break leaders. They resolved to ei
ther schedule the meetings at 8:30
p.m. on Tuesday night, pushing the
meeting back over an hour from last
quarter, or meet on the weekends.
Several senators objected to the
weekend meetings; however, Sena
tors Samar Alqatari 'l4 and Tara
Trujillo 'l4 noted that finding a time
where everyone could meet was a
priority. Senate Chair Rafael
Vazquez 'l2 will send out a Doodle
to find what times work best for the
senators.
The Senate also spent time try
ing to organize a private dinner
a retreat-like meeting where they
can discuss the upcoming quarter.
They are still planning on having a
retreat later in the year, and a time
has not been set for the dinner yet.

Dan Ashton 'l4 gave updates
on the Leadership Development
Program (LDP), the mentoring
program that pairs freshmen with
ASSU senators. Ashton said that
the expectation for senators is to
meet with their mentee at least
once a week. Senators will then
give updates in their meetings and
help the mentees form projects of
their own design.
The LDP has been a contentious
issue in the past, as several senators
have noted they have not had any
contact with their mentee, and oth
ers questioned the involvement
level of the mentees. These new ad
ditions to the program, if they work,
would increase the activity level of
the LDP mentees.
The Academic Affairs Commit
tee had several updates regarding
programs they are targeting to
wards freshmen; however the Ap
propriations and Advocacy Com
mittees are still working on finding
meeting times for the new quarter.
