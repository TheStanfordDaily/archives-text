## PROFESSOR, PRINCE 
### NATASHA WEASER 
Moulay Hicham Ben Abdallah
M.A. '97 walked into the
CoHo, glanced around, smiled
and said, "Well, this is a cozy
place."
Wearing jeans and a plain black sweater, he
blended into the crowd of Stanford students and
visitors, none of whom knew they were in the
presence of a prince.
Being a prince "can be more of a nuisance
than anything else. People scrutinize you and
have preconceived notions like ... does he wear
a turban?" he joked.
Ben Abdallah, whose full name is Prince
Moulay Hicham Ben Abdallah El Alaoui, is
third in line to the throne of the Kingdom of
Morocco and first cousin to the current King,
Mohammed VI. Nicknamed the "Red
Prince," he is well known for favoring demo
cratic reforms in Morocco and the Arab
world. He does not, however, appreciate the
title, stating in an interview with the French
journal Le Debat that it was given to him by
the same "information handlers" who nick
named King Mohammed VI "King of the
Poor."
His unorthodox views in the conservative
kingdom led to his expulsion from palace
grounds by his cousin, who ascended the
throne in 1999 after the death of his father and
Ben Abdallah's uncle, Hassan 11.
Morocco's Al-Alaoui dynasty has been in
power for four centuries and traces its lineage
back to the Prophet Mohammed. The monar
chy does not tolerate criticism.
"The authorities use the restrictive press
law and an array of financial and other, more
subtle mechanisms to punish critical journal
ists, particularly those who focus on the king,
his family or Islam," states the Freedom House
2011 Country Report on Morocco.
"The monarchy is a cultural and historical
symbol," Ben Abdallah said. "This is why Mo
roccans are aware of its crucial role in society
and push for reform instead of overthrowing
the regime... but there is a deep sense of
frustration and impatience."
His decision to publicly state his contro
versial views in 1995 was not taken lightly.
"I thought profoundly about who I was and
what my country was," he said. "It was not
easy. There were high costs, and one of them
was being ostracized and even vilified."
Nevertheless, Ben Abdallah remains an
outspoken political maverick, unwavering in
his support for controversial publications and
journalists as well as groups like the February
20th Youth Movement.
Raised in the Moroccan capital Rabat's
Royal Palace complex, Ben Abdallah attended
the Rabat American School and graduated
from Princeton with a bachelor's degree in
politics in 1985. After pursuing several entre
preneurial and humanitarian endeavors, he
came to Stanford in 1995 to pursue a master's
degree in political science.
"Deepening my experience and my knowl
edge one way or another has never been inter
rupted in my life no matter where I go," Ben
Abdallah said.
In his witty, yet diplomatic, manner, Ben
Abdallah compared Stanford and Princeton.
"Princeton is like an orchestra where you
cannot play out of note but produce great

music," he said. "Stanford is like one big rock
band where everyone is encouraged to make
their own sound."
After leaving the Farm, Ben Abdallah stayed
in close contact with Larry Diamond, director of
the Center for Democracy, Development and
the Rule of Law (CDDRL).
In 2007, Ben Abdallah left his home in
Princeton, where he had been living since 2002,
and returned to Stanford as a CDDRL visiting

scholar.
At CDDRL, he has been deeply involved in
the Arab Reform and Democracy Program
doing research, mentoring students, giving talks
and developing the program.
"My goal is to enrich myself and my com
munity as well as foster general understanding
of the region," he said.
Although Ben Abdallah originally intended
to stay at CDDRL for two years, he eventually

decided to remain longer and is now a consult
ing professor. This means he regularly com
mutes back to Princeton, where his wife, Mali
ka, and their two daughters live.
One of Ben Abdallah's initial research proj
ects at CDDRL was investigating the idea that
the Arab world is incompatible with democra
cy, which he swiftly rejected as a false concept.
"There was an underlying thesis that there
was something about Arabs that makes them
accept authoritarianism, and I wanted to unbun
dle it," he said. "I wanted to say, look, authori
tarianism is here, but this is why it's here. The
factors are not cultural."
The Arab Spring may have surprised the
Western world, but not Ben Abdallah.
"I always felt that something was around the
comer," he said. "I knew that the status quo was
untenable, and that in a few of these places
something would have to give way."
What surprised him was the movement's
place of origin, Tunisia, which had a strong se
curity apparatus. He also did not envision the
movement's diffusion and transformation into
what he called an "awakening."
Despite the optimism in the movement, he
said that the future of the region is uncertain.
Setbacks, reversals and failures are all likely to
happen as each country faces its own particular
demons, he said, but he believes the trend to
wards democracy is irreversible.
"This is a new generation with new values,"
he said. "Fear has receded, and societies will
not remain idle."
He also downplayed fears over the rise of Is
lamist parties throughout the region and in his
native Morocco, where the Justice and Develop
ment Party, a moderate Islamist party, recently
won parliamentary elections.
"This does not mean we will see the rise of
theocracies," he said. "People are not going to
resist secular authoritarianism to fall into reli
gious despotism."
Although Ben Abdallah has vigorously
championed reform in Morocco for the last two
decades, he attempts to keep his expectations re
alistic.
"It took hundreds of years for the West to get
things on track," he said. "It will be a messy and
laborious process for Morocco, but we'll even
tually get it right."
Ben Abdallah's work at Stanford and in pol
itics is not the end of his pursuits. He also runs
his own foundation, the Moulay Hicham Foun
dation for Social Science Research on North
Africa and the Middle East, founded Princeton's
Institute for the Transregional Study of the Con
temporary Middle East, North Africa and Cen
tral Asia and owns Al-Tayyar Energy, a renew
able energy company that processes agricultur
al waste in Thailand.
"I barely have free time; I am juggling," he
said. "Every time I think I cannot handle more,
someone else throws me another ball to juggle."
Although his professional and family lives
are rooted in the United States now, Ben Abdal
lah still keeps close ties with Morocco and re
turns often.
"I miss the community feel," he said. "I miss
my nephews and my friends. I miss walking on
the streets hearing the call to prayer and
smelling the odors of spices, so now and then I
need to go back home."

politics in 1985. After pursuing several entre
preneurial and humanitarian endeavors, he
came to Stanford in 1995 to pursue a master's
degree in political science.
"Deepening my experience and my knowl
edge one way or another has never been inter
rupted in my life no matter where I go," Ben
Abdallah said.
In his witty, yet diplomatic, manner, Ben
Abdallah compared Stanford and Princeton.
"Princeton is like an orchestra where you
cannot play out of note but produce great

music," he said. "Stanford is like one big rock
band where everyone is encouraged to make
their own sound."
After leaving the Farm, Ben Abdallah stayed
in close contact with Larry Diamond, director of
the Center for Democracy, Development and
the Rule of Law (CDDRL).
In 2007, Ben Abdallah left his home in
Princeton, where he had been living since 2002,
and returned to Stanford as a CDDRL visiting

scholar.
At CDDRL, he has been deeply involved in
the Arab Reform and Democracy Program
doing research, mentoring students, giving talks
and developing the program.
"My goal is to enrich myself and my com
munity as well as foster general understanding
of the region," he said.
Although Ben Abdallah originally intended
to stay at CDDRL for two years, he eventually

decided to remain longer and is now a consult
ing professor. This means he regularly com
mutes back to Princeton, where his wife, Mali
ka, and their two daughters live.
One of Ben Abdallah's initial research proj
ects at CDDRL was investigating the idea that
the Arab world is incompatible with democra
cy, which he swiftly rejected as a false concept.
"There was an underlying thesis that there
was something about Arabs that makes them
accept authoritarianism, and I wanted to unbun
dle it," he said. "I wanted to say, look, authori
tarianism is here, but this is why it's here. The
factors are not cultural."
The Arab Spring may have surprised the
Western world, but not Ben Abdallah.
"I always felt that something was around the
comer," he said. "I knew that the status quo was
untenable, and that in a few of these places
something would have to give way."
What surprised him was the movement's
place of origin, Tunisia, which had a strong se
curity apparatus. He also did not envision the
movement's diffusion and transformation into
what he called an "awakening."
Despite the optimism in the movement, he
said that the future of the region is uncertain.
Setbacks, reversals and failures are all likely to
happen as each country faces its own particular
demons, he said, but he believes the trend to
wards democracy is irreversible.
"This is a new generation with new values,"
he said. "Fear has receded, and societies will
not remain idle."
He also downplayed fears over the rise of Is
lamist parties throughout the region and in his
native Morocco, where the Justice and Develop
ment Party, a moderate Islamist party, recently
won parliamentary elections.
"This does not mean we will see the rise of
theocracies," he said. "People are not going to
resist secular authoritarianism to fall into reli
gious despotism."
Although Ben Abdallah has vigorously
championed reform in Morocco for the last two
decades, he attempts to keep his expectations re
alistic.
"It took hundreds of years for the West to get
things on track," he said. "It will be a messy and
laborious process for Morocco, but we'll even
tually get it right."
Ben Abdallah's work at Stanford and in pol
itics is not the end of his pursuits. He also runs
his own foundation, the Moulay Hicham Foun
dation for Social Science Research on North
Africa and the Middle East, founded Princeton's
Institute for the Transregional Study of the Con
temporary Middle East, North Africa and Cen
tral Asia and owns Al-Tayyar Energy, a renew
able energy company that processes agricultur
al waste in Thailand.
"I barely have free time; I am juggling," he
said. "Every time I think I cannot handle more,
someone else throws me another ball to juggle."
Although his professional and family lives
are rooted in the United States now, Ben Abdal
lah still keeps close ties with Morocco and re
turns often.
"I miss the community feel," he said. "I miss
my nephews and my friends. I miss walking on
the streets hearing the call to prayer and
smelling the odors of spices, so now and then I
need to go back home."

M.A. '97 walked into the
CoHo, glanced around, smiled
and said, "Well, this is a cozy
place."
Wearing jeans and a plain black sweater, he
blended into the crowd of Stanford students and
visitors, none of whom knew they were in the
presence of a prince.
Being a prince "can be more of a nuisance
than anything else. People scrutinize you and
have preconceived notions like ... does he wear
a turban?" he joked.
Ben Abdallah, whose full name is Prince
Moulay Hicham Ben Abdallah El Alaoui, is
third in line to the throne of the Kingdom of
Morocco and first cousin to the current King,
Mohammed VI. Nicknamed the "Red
Prince," he is well known for favoring demo
cratic reforms in Morocco and the Arab
world. He does not, however, appreciate the
title, stating in an interview with the French
journal Le Debat that it was given to him by
the same "information handlers" who nick
named King Mohammed VI "King of the
Poor."
His unorthodox views in the conservative
kingdom led to his expulsion from palace
grounds by his cousin, who ascended the
throne in 1999 after the death of his father and
Ben Abdallah's uncle, Hassan 11.
Morocco's Al-Alaoui dynasty has been in
power for four centuries and traces its lineage
back to the Prophet Mohammed. The monar
chy does not tolerate criticism.
"The authorities use the restrictive press
law and an array of financial and other, more
subtle mechanisms to punish critical journal
ists, particularly those who focus on the king,
his family or Islam," states the Freedom House
2011 Country Report on Morocco.
"The monarchy is a cultural and historical
symbol," Ben Abdallah said. "This is why Mo
roccans are aware of its crucial role in society
and push for reform instead of overthrowing
the regime... but there is a deep sense of
frustration and impatience."
His decision to publicly state his contro
versial views in 1995 was not taken lightly.
"I thought profoundly about who I was and
what my country was," he said. "It was not
easy. There were high costs, and one of them
was being ostracized and even vilified."
Nevertheless, Ben Abdallah remains an
outspoken political maverick, unwavering in
his support for controversial publications and
journalists as well as groups like the February
20th Youth Movement.
Raised in the Moroccan capital Rabat's
Royal Palace complex, Ben Abdallah attended
the Rabat American School and graduated
from Princeton with a bachelor's degree in
politics in 1985. After pursuing several entre
preneurial and humanitarian endeavors, he
came to Stanford in 1995 to pursue a master's
