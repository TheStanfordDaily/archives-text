## A 						unit of happiness 
### LESLIE NGUYEN-OKWU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Now in the thick of her sopho
more year, Najla Gomez Ro
driguez 'l4 spends more time
with caffeine than she does
with her own friends. An as
piring civil engineering major and possible
law student, Gomez Rodriguez juggled a
tightly-packed schedule her autumn quarter
—l7 units of engineering, physics and
math along with leadership positions in
Sigma Theta Psi, El Centra Chicano, the
First-Generation Low Income Partnership
and the Latino Sib Program. Swamped with
meetings, midterm review sessions, classes,
rallies and events, this is the busiest she has
ever been. At times, her workload is, in her
words, "barely manageable."
In a recent post on Facebook, Gomez Ro
driguez wrote, "Slept 20 out of the past 28
hours ... Catching up on sleep much?" A
friend commented, "You deserve it!"
Yet it's not just sleep that Stanford stu
dents lack. Fred Luskin Ph.D. '99 P.D. '99, a
senior consultant in health promotion at Stan
ford who speaks nationally on the importance
of managing stress, hesitated as he searched
for the right words.
"There's just not enough 'kidness' left,"
Luskin said. "There's a lack of carefreeness,
exuberance and exploring for the sake of ex
ploring. They're too scheduled, too organ
ized, too future-oriented."
Luskin, along with Carole Pertofsky, di
rector of health promotion at the Vaden
Health Center, hopes to counterthis issue. To
gether, they teach Athletic 196, a one-unit
course called "Happiness." According to
Luskin, Stanford students tend to be high
achieving— reaching for excellence but
straining themselves in the process. Yet
achievement, he explained, does not neces
sarily mean happiness.
"I think there's an emptiness within a lot
of people who make straight A's or get a
Rhodes scholarship, but don't have the
deeper qualities that make life rich," Luskin
said. "You can go out and notice how beau
tiful it is and still get straight A's. If you
make sure you have real relationships, then
the straight A's will mean more than just
getting them."

In addition to cultivating meaningful rela
tionships and acquiring a healthier apprecia
tion for life, the course seeks to define what
happiness is, how to gain it and ultimately,
how best to incorporate it into daily activities.
It's the little things, Luskin argued, that make
us happy.
"Reminding people to relax a little, to
smile, to taste the coffee, whatever it is, [is] so
helpful," he said. "So much of psychology is
focused on what's wrong with people and not
on how to be happy and healthy."
Luskin and Pertofsky originally taught a
course titled "The Pursuit of Happiness and
Health" in the School of Medicine's Depart
ment of Pediatrics, which in 2007 evolved
into the happiness class offered now, taught
twice a year through the athletics department.
The happiness class covers topics such as
gratitude, mindfulness, human connections,
forgiveness and meditation, and reaches a
wider student audience.
Annemarie Estess B.A. 'O9 M.A. 'lO,
now an undergraduate admission counselor,
helped design the course's curriculum.
"We were especially driven by student
testimonials denoting a pattern of high stress,
high expectations and a desire to dedicate
more resources toward personal introspec
tion and growth," Estess wrote in an email to
The Daily.
The happiness class pertains to people
from all walks of life. According to Luskin,
nearly anyone can benefit from its readings
and guided practices. Assignments often
focus on self-reflection and deep fulfillment,
varying from simply savoring your own food
to thanking someone you take for granted.
"Rather than having to work on some
math problem, you're having to figure out
how to live a more satisfying life," said Nick
Enge B.S. 'O9 M.S. 'lO, an earth systems
graduate student and a teaching assistant for
the course. "It's harder to come into a class
where you're expected to think about and re
flect on and change yourself. It's a complete
ly different kind of problem; but I think it's
equally, if not more, important."
Some take the course to leam new ways to
handle their stress. Others like Steven Crane
' 12, a former student and TA, are simply cu
rious about the topic.
"I just typed 'happiness' into Explore
Courses, because that's what I wanted to leam
about," Crane said.

Two years ago, Crane served as president
for Stanford Peace of Mind, a group dedicat
ed to addressing students' mental health is
sues. He cited the course as pivotal to gaining
a greater sense of self-awareness and a deep
er understanding of his character strengths.
Moreover, he said, the course has also helped
students with issues that require more help
than the course can offer.
"In the journals and conversations we have,
we sort of get a sense that a person is really
struggling,'" Crane said. "We identify people
who definitely need help and refer them to
CAPS [Counseling and Psychological Servic
es]."
In the future, Luskin and Pertofsky envi
sion making the tenets of the course accessi
ble to all incoming students as part of their
freshman curriculum. Ideally, Luskin wants
every student to be equipped with the funda
mentals of long-term happiness through an
optional "wellness" certificate that would ap
pear on transcripts. In theory, these initiatives
would introduce students to the basics of a
well-rounded lifestyle.
"We need to include these courses as part
of a multi-layered approach throughout the
University if we are to support students in not
only preventing mental illness, but in flour
ishing during their time on the Farm," Estess
said.
Busy with school and a dizzying number
of extracurricular activities, Gomez Ro
driguez knew little about the happiness class
and its growing success. However, she's in
terested in enrolling.
"I think that inside the busy bubble that is
Stanford, we often forget... the importance
of slowing down to appreciate the moment
we are living without realizing what we are
missing, and I think this course is a step to
wards addressing this issue," Gomez Ro
driguez said. "The happier I am, the easier it
becomes to reach my highest potential."

Now in the thick of her sopho
more year, Najla Gomez Ro
driguez 'l4 spends more time
with caffeine than she does
with her own friends. An as
piring civil engineering major and possible
law student, Gomez Rodriguez juggled a
tightly-packed schedule her autumn quarter
—l7 units of engineering, physics and
math along with leadership positions in
Sigma Theta Psi, El Centra Chicano, the
First-Generation Low Income Partnership
and the Latino Sib Program. Swamped with
meetings, midterm review sessions, classes,
rallies and events, this is the busiest she has
ever been. At times, her workload is, in her
words, "barely manageable."
In a recent post on Facebook, Gomez Ro
driguez wrote, "Slept 20 out of the past 28
hours ... Catching up on sleep much?" A
friend commented, "You deserve it!"
Yet it's not just sleep that Stanford stu
dents lack. Fred Luskin Ph.D. '99 P.D. '99, a
senior consultant in health promotion at Stan
ford who speaks nationally on the importance
of managing stress, hesitated as he searched
for the right words.
"There's just not enough 'kidness' left,"
Luskin said. "There's a lack of carefreeness,
exuberance and exploring for the sake of ex
ploring. They're too scheduled, too organ
ized, too future-oriented."
Luskin, along with Carole Pertofsky, di
rector of health promotion at the Vaden
Health Center, hopes to counterthis issue. To
gether, they teach Athletic 196, a one-unit
course called "Happiness." According to
Luskin, Stanford students tend to be high
achieving— reaching for excellence but
straining themselves in the process. Yet
achievement, he explained, does not neces
sarily mean happiness.
"I think there's an emptiness within a lot
of people who make straight A's or get a
Rhodes scholarship, but don't have the
deeper qualities that make life rich," Luskin
said. "You can go out and notice how beau
tiful it is and still get straight A's. If you
make sure you have real relationships, then
the straight A's will mean more than just
getting them."

In addition to cultivating meaningful rela
tionships and acquiring a healthier apprecia
tion for life, the course seeks to define what
happiness is, how to gain it and ultimately,
how best to incorporate it into daily activities.
It's the little things, Luskin argued, that make
us happy.
"Reminding people to relax a little, to
smile, to taste the coffee, whatever it is, [is] so
helpful," he said. "So much of psychology is
focused on what's wrong with people and not
on how to be happy and healthy."
Luskin and Pertofsky originally taught a
course titled "The Pursuit of Happiness and
Health" in the School of Medicine's Depart
ment of Pediatrics, which in 2007 evolved
into the happiness class offered now, taught
twice a year through the athletics department.
The happiness class covers topics such as
gratitude, mindfulness, human connections,
forgiveness and meditation, and reaches a
wider student audience.
Annemarie Estess B.A. 'O9 M.A. 'lO,
now an undergraduate admission counselor,
helped design the course's curriculum.
"We were especially driven by student
testimonials denoting a pattern of high stress,
high expectations and a desire to dedicate
more resources toward personal introspec
tion and growth," Estess wrote in an email to
The Daily.
The happiness class pertains to people
from all walks of life. According to Luskin,
nearly anyone can benefit from its readings
and guided practices. Assignments often
focus on self-reflection and deep fulfillment,
varying from simply savoring your own food
to thanking someone you take for granted.
"Rather than having to work on some
math problem, you're having to figure out
how to live a more satisfying life," said Nick
Enge B.S. 'O9 M.S. 'lO, an earth systems
graduate student and a teaching assistant for
the course. "It's harder to come into a class
where you're expected to think about and re
flect on and change yourself. It's a complete
ly different kind of problem; but I think it's
equally, if not more, important."
Some take the course to leam new ways to
handle their stress. Others like Steven Crane
' 12, a former student and TA, are simply cu
rious about the topic.
"I just typed 'happiness' into Explore
Courses, because that's what I wanted to leam
about," Crane said.

Two years ago, Crane served as president
for Stanford Peace of Mind, a group dedicat
ed to addressing students' mental health is
sues. He cited the course as pivotal to gaining
a greater sense of self-awareness and a deep
er understanding of his character strengths.
Moreover, he said, the course has also helped
students with issues that require more help
than the course can offer.
"In the journals and conversations we have,
we sort of get a sense that a person is really
struggling,'" Crane said. "We identify people
who definitely need help and refer them to
CAPS [Counseling and Psychological Servic
es]."
In the future, Luskin and Pertofsky envi
sion making the tenets of the course accessi
ble to all incoming students as part of their
freshman curriculum. Ideally, Luskin wants
every student to be equipped with the funda
mentals of long-term happiness through an
optional "wellness" certificate that would ap
pear on transcripts. In theory, these initiatives
would introduce students to the basics of a
well-rounded lifestyle.
"We need to include these courses as part
of a multi-layered approach throughout the
University if we are to support students in not
only preventing mental illness, but in flour
ishing during their time on the Farm," Estess
said.
Busy with school and a dizzying number
of extracurricular activities, Gomez Ro
driguez knew little about the happiness class
and its growing success. However, she's in
terested in enrolling.
"I think that inside the busy bubble that is
