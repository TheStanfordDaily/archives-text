## A 						LOOK BACK 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Two missed field goals in the Fiesta Bowl.
A sublime triple-overtime victory against
USC. The final season for one of the supreme
talents in Stanford and college football histo
ry.

The 2011 Stanford football season is un
likely to be forgotten by any Stanford fan for
a long time, and now that the college football
season is over, it's time to take stock of what
exactly fans will remember and will want
to forget from this season.
The Good: 1) Andrew Luck. Of course,
the list has to start with the best player in col
lege football. Luck was expected to be spec
tacular this entire season after bypassing the
NFL draft for another shot at the national
title and Heisman trophy, and he lived up to
all of those expectations. While he won't be
taking home a crystal football or a Heisman,
he shattered records, made some truly in
credible plays (like his one-handed catch,
clutch 4th quarter and overtime perform
ance against USC and his near-flawless game
against Oklahoma State) and assured him
self the No. 1 pick in the draft once again.
While Colts fans are deeply fond of Peyton
Manning, Luck should certainly have little
trouble finding a warm welcome in Indi
anapolis next year.
2) 56-48,30 T. In one of the wildest games
in the entirety of college football this season,
two of the most talented teams in the nation
battled out an instant classic. And of course,
the good guys won.
3) Stepfan Taylor. The junior running
back became just the third player in Stanford
history to have back-to-back 1,000-yard
rushing seasons, a testament not only to his
skill as a runner but also to his ability to stay
healthy despite carrying the ball 242 times
this season.Taylor averaged a solid 5.5 yards
a carry and was in the top 25 nationally in
rush yards per game. If he weren't so over
shadowed by Andrew Luck, Taylor likely
would be hailed as one of the most talented.

well-rounded running backs in the country.
But he's likely to finally earn some of that
well-deserved praise as the centerpiece of
the Cardinal offense in its 2012 campaign.
4) Tree's Company. The Cardinal's trio of
tight ends was easily one of the best in the en
tire country this season, as Zach Ertz, Levine
Toilolo and Coby Fleener combined to score
20 receiving touchdowns. While each one did
miss game time with injuries, the production
from these three dynamic players was instru
mental in helping the Cardinal offense be so
dominant. Other than one underwhelming
performance from the three against Oregon,
the trio continually made big plays at critical
moments throughout the season. One can as
sume that Ertz and Toilolo will be major fac
tors in the Stanford offense next season, and
Fleener has been receiving a lot of praise
from NFL Draft scouts, as many expect him
to be taken in the first three rounds this
April.
5) Fresh faces. After some major injuries
forced the Cardinal to reshuffle its lineup
midway through the season, one can very
safely say that those players who were asked
to step in did so in impressive fashion. On de
fense, Jarek Lancaster and AJ Tarpley both
played extremely well in the stead of Shayne
Skov, with Lancaster leading the team with
70 tackles and Tarpley notching the third
most tackles on the team with 57, despite
starting only seven games. On offense, fresh
man wide receiver Ty Montgomery stepped
in for Chris Owusu and made himself a vital
part of the offense. Montgomery had 120
yards and a touchdown to lead all Cardinal
receivers in the Fiesta Bowl, and the Texas
native also had a rushing touchdown against
Cal and a kickoff return for a score against
Washington State. The early success of Lan
caster, Tarpley and Montgomery proves that
the Cardinal coaching staff knows what it's
doing when it hits the recruiting trail.
6) Shaw and the coaching staff. In his first
season at the helm, Shaw crafted an experi
enced, professional staff of coaches that kept
the Cardinal in the national title hunt for

most of the year. Of course, there were mo
ments where Shaw and company fell into the
category of "not so good," but on the whole,
the group did a great job of making sure the
Cardinal achieved almost all of the goals it
was expected to achieve in the preseason.
The not-so-good: 1) The kicking game. It's
not entirely fair to put Jordan Williamson
into this category he was having a brilliant
year before a midseason injury but unfor
tunately, you can't look past the missed kicks
in the Fiesta Bowl. Additionally, the team
struggled with kicking the ball out of bounds
on kickoffs.
2) Injuries. Watching Chris Owusu fall to
the turf several times this season after a blow
to the head was a terrifying reminder of just
how costly the game of football can be
and how thankful Owusu and the Cardinal
should be that those injuries were not any
worse. Also, the loss of Shayne Skov in the
fourth game of the year was obviously a
major blow to the Cardinal this season it's
never a good thing to lose your best defen
sive player, even though Lancaster andTarp
ley filled in well in his spot.
3) The Oregon debacle. At every turn, the

Ducks fully dominated the Cardinal's most
hyped game of the season. The loss ended
any hopes Stanford had for a national title,
and being blown off the field by more than 20
points in your own house is something that
should not happen to any top-ten team.
4) The tragic death of defensive assistant
coach Chester McGlockton. A rising star on
the Stanford coaching staff, McGlockton was
just 42 years old when he passed away on
Nov. 30. One only had to look at the outpour
ing of emotions from fellow coaches and his
players on Twitter to see that McGlockton
was well-respected and admired throughout
the Stanford family, and that he will be
missed.
Next week, we'll take a look ahead to
what 2012 will bring for the Cardinal in
cluding a top-tier recruiting class and a re
built offense and defense but for now, it's
good to take one last moment and reflect on
an unforgettable 2011, for both its good and
bad.

Junior running back Stepfan Taylor, who finished with more than 1,000 rushing yards
in back-to-back seasons, was a bright spot in the Cardinal's 2011 campaign. With
Luck's departure, he is poised to be the focal point of Stanford's offense in 2012.
