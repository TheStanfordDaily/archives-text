# A 						YEAR OLDER
## NO. 4 STANFORD EAGER TO HIT COURT 
### DANIEL LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
A year ago, despite a youthful roster that fea
tured just one senior in the starting lineup, the
Stanford men's volleyball team finished with a 19-
8 record and a top-10 national ranking. Although
the season came to a premature end in a disap
pointing match in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) Tournament, one that pre
vented Stanford from defending its national title,
much good could be found in the season's results
for the Cardinal.
Then-juniors Erik Shoji and Brad Lawson re
peated as American Volleyball Coaches Associa
tion (AVCA) First Team All-Americans, with
Shoji becoming just the second Cardinal player
ever to earn the honor three times. Freshmen Eric
Mochalski and Brian Cook became dependable
weapons, with Mochalski earning MPSF All-
Freshman honors, and junior setter Evan Barry
settled comfortably into his new starting spot. All
of this underlies the best news of all about young
teams: they only get better.
The Cardinal returns six of its seven starters
from a team that a year ago finished with a 15-7
conference record, good enough for third. Senior
middle blocker and third-year starter Gus Ellis
joins Shoji, Lawson, Mochalski, Cook and Barry
as a returner in the starting lineup, which will be
nicely complemented with the addition of 6-7
sophomore Denny Falls. Obviously, the optimism
on this team runs high.
"We have excellent talent and leadership in
our senior class," Mochalski said. "This team is fo
cused and determined to have a great year and
make a run in the playoffs."
He isn't the only one that agrees with this as
sessment of the team's chances. The Cardinal
opens the season ranked No. 4 in the country and
is predicted to finish third in the MPSF, though the
ceiling could be much higher.
The team's attack should once again center
around Lawson, who a season ago led the team in
kills, kills per set (finishing seventh in the nation),
service aces and service aces per set. Joining Law
son on the attack will be his fellow senior Ellis,
who finished the season with an efficient .351 hit
ting percentage.
TTie 6-5 Mochalski, who led the team in hitting
percentage at a .451 clip and finished second in
aces, will be the team's jack-of-all-trades in his
sophomore season despite having started the ma
jority of last season at middle blocker. He is listed
at three different positions on the team's official
website. Cook, Mochalski's classmate, returns as
the second-leading returner in kills, having fin
ished third on the team a season ago.
These two headline a parade of sophomores
who will greatly contribute to the Cardinal's at
tack, which includes Falls and 6-5 outside hitter
Steven Irvin. Irvin posted an impressive 15 kills in
the team's second exhibition victory over Thomp
son Rivers, starting in place of the resting seniors
Lawson and Ellis.
The man tasked with distributing the ball to
the plethora of talent Stanford features will once
again be Barry, who made an impressive starting

debut a season ago. Barry finished last season
fourth in the country in assists per set at 11.56,
good for a .488 assist percentage. He also con
tributed 34 kills and finished fourth on the team
with 1.35 digs per set.
The defense once again will be anchored by
the All-American Shoji, who finished third in the
country in digs per set with 2.62 and became Stan
ford's all-time leader in digs. Expect redshirt
freshman Scott Sakaida to fill the void left by the
graduated Jordan Inafuku as the ever-important
second libera and defensive specialist. Sakaida
was a high school teammate of Lawson's. Ellis and
Mochalski will once more lead the Cardinal's de
fense at the net, as they led the team with nearly a
block per set each last season.
If last season was any indication, expect big
things from the Cardinal this year.The mix of sen
iors and sophomores will provide a great mix of
talent, leadership and experience, one that should
translate to excellent results.
"Having four senior starters on the team most
importantly means we have experienced players
out on the floor. We know each other well and
have a good idea of what the next guy is going to
do before he does it," Lawson said.
The team's season officially opens today at Pa
cific, and the team's home opener comes on Fri
day at 7 p.m. against Juniata.
