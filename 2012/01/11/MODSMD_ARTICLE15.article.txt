## 'No regrets' for No. 2 Card tennis 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
Stanford women's tennis rings in
the New Year ranked No. 2 behind
the Florida Gators, the same team it
lost the NCAA title to last May after
entering the postseason as the over
whelming favorite. Its slip from the
top spot is not the only difference
from last year the Card graduated
half of last spring's national champi
onship doubles pair, Hilary Barte, as
well as Carolyn McVeigh and Jen
nifer Yen but returns seven play
ers and adds one freshman. Roster
updates aside, the Cardinal is ready
for a fresh start and a new mentality
"No regrets."
"In last year's final match, we had
already overcome so many obstacles
and achieved so much, and I know
each player fought her heart out,"
explained senior captain Veronica
Li. "Everyone said, 'No regrets.' We
would all much rather lose on this
team than win with any other."

leadership are juniors Mallory Bur

man, is the latest Stanford tennis
player to enter college as the No. 1
high school recruit.

double-threat because she's very
calm and patient, but can also attack

doubles. I see her playing the role of
our 'rock' because she's so solid."
While Tsay may be the "rock,"
Burdette hopes to "be the best
leader that I can be and take care of
all of the little details on the team so
that, when we take the court, every
body can just focus on tennis."
Burdette's efforts in helping the
team run smoothly are noticed by
her teammates.
"Mallory is like my co-captain,"
Li said. "She takes care of all the te
dious work and really knits the team
together."
Li pointed out that Burdette's
meticulousness allows her to con
centrate on one of the challenges a
new team faces every year to take
a group of some of the most gifted in
dividual tennis players in the nation
and mesh that into one champi
onship contending team.
"Everyone knows that tennis is
