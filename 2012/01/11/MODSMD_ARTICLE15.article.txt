## 'No regrets' for No. 2 Card tennis 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
Stanford women's tennis rings in
the New Year ranked No. 2 behind
the Florida Gators, the same team it
lost the NCAA title to last May after
entering the postseason as the over
whelming favorite. Its slip from the
top spot is not the only difference
from last year the Card graduated
half of last spring's national champi
onship doubles pair, Hilary Barte, as
well as Carolyn McVeigh and Jen
nifer Yen but returns seven play
ers and adds one freshman. Roster
updates aside, the Cardinal is ready
for a fresh start and a new mentality
"No regrets."
"In last year's final match, we had
already overcome so many obstacles
and achieved so much, and I know
each player fought her heart out,"
explained senior captain Veronica
Li. "Everyone said, 'No regrets.' We
would all much rather lose on this
team than win with any other."
Li is the sole senior on this year's
squad and has taken the reins in pi
loting the team. Helping to provide
leadership are juniors Mallory Bur
dette, Natalie Dillon and StaceyTan,
and sophomores Nicole Gibbs,
Kristie Ahn and Amelia Herring.
Ellen Tsay, the Cardinal's lone fresh
man, is the latest Stanford tennis
player to enter college as the No. 1
high school recruit.
"Ellen is very driven and inde
pendent," Burdette noted. "She's a
double-threat because she's very
calm and patient, but can also attack
and be very aggressive, especially in
doubles. I see her playing the role of
our 'rock' because she's so solid."
While Tsay may be the "rock,"
Burdette hopes to "be the best
leader that I can be and take care of
all of the little details on the team so
that, when we take the court, every
body can just focus on tennis."
Burdette's efforts in helping the
team run smoothly are noticed by
her teammates.
"Mallory is like my co-captain,"
Li said. "She takes care of all the te
dious work and really knits the team
together."
Li pointed out that Burdette's
meticulousness allows her to con
centrate on one of the challenges a
new team faces every year to take
a group of some of the most gifted in
dividual tennis players in the nation
and mesh that into one champi
onship contending team.
"Everyone knows that tennis is
individual sport," she acknowl
edged,"and a team setting is a huge
change from what we were all used
to in the juniors. This year is no dif
ferent in that we have so many in
dependent, strong-willed talents,
but we need to realize that we are
all charging along the same path
and should have the same goals."
"That's how we can win," she
added.

The Cardinal will have to wait
to test its team cohesion until Feb.
1, when it faces UC-Davis at
home. This weekend, the team
will be split into two groups for
two separate individual tourna
ments. Burdette, Gibbs, Tan and
Dillon will all be traveling to Las
Vegas to represent Stanford in
the Freeman Invitational, while
Ahn, Herring, Tsay and Li will be
playing down in Palm Springs in

the National Collegiate Tennis
Classic.

"We get to compete against
players from other schools in
stead of playing each other in one
tournament," Burdette ex
plained. "These tournaments
allow everyone to improve their
individual rankings and serve as a
gauge for us as we move into the
dual season. Whether we do real
ly well or not, we will each get a
feel for what we need to improve
upon."
The team's flexible practice
style has allowed for such im
provement, with a format that en
courages individual tune-ups.
"The coaches are very recep
tive to our opinions and very in
touch with our difference practice
and playing styles," she said. "It's
usually a combination of what the
coaches think we need to work on
as a team as well as more person
alized instruction."
Doubles play has been anoth
er focus of recent practices. With
the graduation of her former part

ner, Burdette will now be playing
with Gibbs at the top of the dou
bles ladder.
"[Gibbs] and I have a similar
chemistry out there on the dou
bles court that I felt with Hilary
when we first started playing," she
said. "So it was a very smooth
transition for me, and I think the
sky is the limit for us as a doubles
team."
Although Li explained that
this year's ladder is not yet ce
mented, Cardinal fans can be sure
that fine tennis will be on display
yet again at the Farm. With a mul
titude of strong, young teams such
as Duke and UCLA on the sched
ule, the squad is anxious to begin
competing again.
"Being ranked No. 2 behind
one of our biggest rivals definite
ly fuels our fire," she said. "I think
I can speak for everyone when I
say we are super excited for the
opportunity to play."
