# Inject steroid users into HOF
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
I will not lie â€”it gives me great
pleasure to see Timothy
Richard Tebow do his damn
thing. I laugh in the face of
Stephen A. Smith, much like
Skip Bayless will do every morning
this week on ESPN's First Take.
I jumped on the Tebow band
wagon early on, when youngTimmy
was only just beginning to learn how
much hate could be piled upon
someone so seemingly undeserving
of detestation. But the story of how
Tim shocked the world by taking
the Pittsburgh Steelers (albeit a de
pleted Steelers team) out behind
the shed is neither here nor there.
Instead I would like to get an
early start with my attempts to con
vince 573 of the stubbornest, most
irritable, least compromising, nos
talgic old fogies this side of Mount
Crumpit the Baseball Writer's
Association of America that
Major League Baseball's Hall of
Fame has a responsibility to open its
doors to many of the players whose
careers have been tainted by play
ing in The Asterisk Era.
Barry Larkin was voted into the
HOF, and his election is a nice story.
Larkin is clearly deserving, posting
solid career numbers and earning a
reputation as a clubhouse leader.
But this year's ballot pales in
comparison to next year's, when
several of the greatest players in his
tory are eligible all of whom have
at least tangential ties to steroid use:
Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens,
Sammy Sosa, Mike Piazza, Curt
Schilling and Craig Biggio.
Even a brief look at the stats re
veals that among those six players,
three might be the best at their posi
tion ever.
Putting aside any question of
steroid use, Bonds flat out abused
pitchers throughout his entire ca
reer. He won seven MVP awards
four more than anyone else and
ended his career with eight Gold
Glove Awards and 12 Silver Slugger
Awards.
Bonds is the all-time home run
leader (762), walk leader (2558) and
came tantalizingly close to 3,000 hits
and 2,000 RBI coming up just short
of each.
Oh, and he used steroids.
Clemens won seven Cy Young
