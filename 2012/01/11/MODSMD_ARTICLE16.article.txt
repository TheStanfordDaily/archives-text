# Inject steroid users into HOF
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
I will not lie —it gives me great
pleasure to see Timothy
Richard Tebow do his damn
thing. I laugh in the face of
Stephen A. Smith, much like
Skip Bayless will do every morning
this week on ESPN's First Take.
I jumped on the Tebow band
wagon early on, when youngTimmy
was only just beginning to learn how
much hate could be piled upon
someone so seemingly undeserving
of detestation. But the story of how
Tim shocked the world by taking
the Pittsburgh Steelers (albeit a de
pleted Steelers team) out behind
the shed is neither here nor there.
Instead I would like to get an
early start with my attempts to con
vince 573 of the stubbornest, most
irritable, least compromising, nos
talgic old fogies this side of Mount
Crumpit the Baseball Writer's
Association of America that
Major League Baseball's Hall of
Fame has a responsibility to open its
doors to many of the players whose
careers have been tainted by play
ing in The Asterisk Era.
Barry Larkin was voted into the
HOF, and his election is a nice story.
Larkin is clearly deserving, posting
solid career numbers and earning a
reputation as a clubhouse leader.
But this year's ballot pales in
comparison to next year's, when
several of the greatest players in his
tory are eligible all of whom have
at least tangential ties to steroid use:
Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens,
Sammy Sosa, Mike Piazza, Curt
Schilling and Craig Biggio.
Even a brief look at the stats re
veals that among those six players,
three might be the best at their posi
tion ever.
Putting aside any question of
steroid use, Bonds flat out abused
pitchers throughout his entire ca
reer. He won seven MVP awards
four more than anyone else and
ended his career with eight Gold
Glove Awards and 12 Silver Slugger
Awards.
Bonds is the all-time home run
leader (762), walk leader (2558) and
came tantalizingly close to 3,000 hits
and 2,000 RBI coming up just short
of each.
Oh, and he used steroids.
Clemens won seven Cy Young

Awards, two World Series Champi
onship and an MVP award (and we
saw how difficult it is for pitchers to
win MVP awards). Fie is one of just
four pitchers to have more than
4,000 strikeouts, and also won over
350 games in a 23-year career.
And he was injected several
times with performance enhancing
drugs, in the butt.
Let's look at Piazza, without
question the best hitting catcher the
game has ever seen. Playing what is
notoriously the most difficult posi
tion for hitters to play because of
the constant grind and nature of
taking a beating for nine innings
every night, Piazza hit .308 with 427
home runs and a career OPS of
.922. Those are first ballot, sure
thing, no-doubt-about-it numbers.
But he is suspected of taking
steroids.
While Schilling only won 216
games and has borderline numbers
for Cooperstown in the regular sea
son, his ability to rise above when it
mattered most in the postseason
would ordinarily make him almost
certainly a Hall of Famer.
Except he might have been juic
ing.
And with 3,000 hits, 250 home
runs and 400 steals and outstanding
defense at four positions, Biggio
shouldn't have to worry about
much beyond who to thank when
they unveil his bronze bust.
But he, too, is lumped right in with
the rest of many of the best players
of the era, and will have a steep up
hill battle to the 75-percent of the
vote required to gain entry.
I am not in any way apologizing
for those players who used steroids.
What they did was wrong and they
all had the choice to steer clear of
"the clear" or avoid the "flax seed
oils." But we cannot afford to act as
if this situation is unique in base
ball's history, and it certainly does
not warrant the knee-jerk reactions
many writers have voiced.
Like many sports, baseball has
undergone many changes through
out the years. I mean, the spitball
was not outlawed until 1920, and
was still in wide use through the
19605. The minimum home-run dis
tance in ballparks was raised in 1925
to 250 feet.

I can go on to talk about drop
ping the pitcher's mound a whop
ping five inches in 1969, along with
shrinking the strike zone. No
African Americans were on major
league rosters until 1947. A brand
new position was added to the
American League as recently as
1973. Seriously.
And yet people aren't clamoring
to throw out the outstanding statis
tics put up by pitchers when the
mound was high and the balls
weren't changed out every pitch. Or
the offensive stats from American
League players that benefited be
cause they had a professional hitter
inserted into the lineup and no
longer had to rely on their pitcher to
bat in games.
One of the prevailing wisdoms
circulating has it that Bonds might
stand a better chance to eventually
make it in because it is assumed that
he only began using steroids about
halfway through his career and his
stats before that time were nearly
deserving on their own. But the
Boston Globe's Dan Shaughnessy
says that as in golf, cheating on the
back nine gets you disqualified even
if the front nine is clean.
Come on, Shaughnessy.
You cannot compare golf and
baseball. And you cannot expect
me to believe that these six players
were in the minority of players tak
ing steroids. I've met many former
pros that tell me that everyone was
doing it, and the league was also
looking the other way until very re
cently.
The players were not victims,
and their choices have tainted
themselves and the sport. But I be
lieve that the only fair way to look at
this era is not to remove two
decades from the record books, nor
attach asterisks to the players'
names who have been convicted of
taking PEDs or admitted to doing
so.
Rather, we must accept that this
was an era just like the dead-ball
era, and continue to respect that the
best players deserve to be en
shrined. I hope to see Bonds and
company right alongside other no
torious "cheaters" like Gaylord
Perry or John McGraw the next
time I find myself in Cooperstown.

Miles would vote Tebow into the
Hall of Fame if he took steroids,
too. Send him your thoughts at
milesbs@stanford.edu and check

shrinking the strike zone. No
African Americans were on major
league rosters until 1947. A brand
new position was added to the
American League as recently as
1973. Seriously.
And yet people aren't clamoring
to throw out the outstanding statis
tics put up by pitchers when the
mound was high and the balls
weren't changed out every pitch. Or
the offensive stats from American
League players that benefited be
cause they had a professional hitter
inserted into the lineup and no
longer had to rely on their pitcher to
bat in games.
One of the prevailing wisdoms
circulating has it that Bonds might
stand a better chance to eventually
make it in because it is assumed that
he only began using steroids about
halfway through his career and his
stats before that time were nearly
deserving on their own. But the
Boston Globe's Dan Shaughnessy
says that as in golf, cheating on the
back nine gets you disqualified even
if the front nine is clean.
Come on, Shaughnessy.
You cannot compare golf and
baseball. And you cannot expect
me to believe that these six players
were in the minority of players tak
ing steroids. I've met many former
pros that tell me that everyone was
doing it, and the league was also
looking the other way until very re
cently.
The players were not victims,
and their choices have tainted
themselves and the sport. But I be
lieve that the only fair way to look at
this era is not to remove two
decades from the record books, nor
attach asterisks to the players'
names who have been convicted of
taking PEDs or admitted to doing
so.
Rather, we must accept that this
was an era just like the dead-ball
era, and continue to respect that the
best players deserve to be en
shrined. I hope to see Bonds and
company right alongside other no
torious "cheaters" like Gaylord
Perry or John McGraw the next
time I find myself in Cooperstown.

Miles would vote Tebow into the
Hall of Fame if he took steroids,
too. Send him your thoughts at
milesbs@stanford.edu and check
him out on Twitter @smilesbsmith.
I will not lie —it gives me great
pleasure to see Timothy
Richard Tebow do his damn
thing. I laugh in the face of
Stephen A. Smith, much like
Skip Bayless will do every morning
this week on ESPN's First Take.
I jumped on the Tebow band
wagon early on, when youngTimmy
was only just beginning to learn how
much hate could be piled upon
someone so seemingly undeserving
of detestation. But the story of how
Tim shocked the world by taking
the Pittsburgh Steelers (albeit a de
pleted Steelers team) out behind
the shed is neither here nor there.
Instead I would like to get an
early start with my attempts to con
vince 573 of the stubbornest, most
irritable, least compromising, nos
talgic old fogies this side of Mount
Crumpit the Baseball Writer's
Association of America that
Major League Baseball's Hall of
Fame has a responsibility to open its
doors to many of the players whose
careers have been tainted by play
ing in The Asterisk Era.
Barry Larkin was voted into the
HOF, and his election is a nice story.
Larkin is clearly deserving, posting
solid career numbers and earning a
reputation as a clubhouse leader.
But this year's ballot pales in
comparison to next year's, when
several of the greatest players in his
tory are eligible all of whom have
at least tangential ties to steroid use:
Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens,
Sammy Sosa, Mike Piazza, Curt
Schilling and Craig Biggio.
Even a brief look at the stats re
veals that among those six players,
three might be the best at their posi
tion ever.
Putting aside any question of
steroid use, Bonds flat out abused
pitchers throughout his entire ca
reer. He won seven MVP awards
four more than anyone else and
ended his career with eight Gold
Glove Awards and 12 Silver Slugger
Awards.
Bonds is the all-time home run
leader (762), walk leader (2558) and
came tantalizingly close to 3,000 hits
and 2,000 RBI coming up just short
of each.
Oh, and he used steroids.
Clemens won seven Cy Young

Awards, two World Series Champi
onship and an MVP award (and we
saw how difficult it is for pitchers to
win MVP awards). Fie is one of just
four pitchers to have more than
4,000 strikeouts, and also won over
350 games in a 23-year career.
And he was injected several
times with performance enhancing
drugs, in the butt.
Let's look at Piazza, without
question the best hitting catcher the
game has ever seen. Playing what is
notoriously the most difficult posi
tion for hitters to play because of
the constant grind and nature of
taking a beating for nine innings
every night, Piazza hit .308 with 427
home runs and a career OPS of
.922. Those are first ballot, sure
thing, no-doubt-about-it numbers.
But he is suspected of taking
steroids.
While Schilling only won 216
games and has borderline numbers
for Cooperstown in the regular sea
son, his ability to rise above when it
mattered most in the postseason
would ordinarily make him almost
certainly a Hall of Famer.
Except he might have been juic
ing.
And with 3,000 hits, 250 home
runs and 400 steals and outstanding
defense at four positions, Biggio
shouldn't have to worry about
much beyond who to thank when
they unveil his bronze bust.
But he, too, is lumped right in with
the rest of many of the best players
of the era, and will have a steep up
hill battle to the 75-percent of the
vote required to gain entry.
I am not in any way apologizing
for those players who used steroids.
What they did was wrong and they
all had the choice to steer clear of
"the clear" or avoid the "flax seed
oils." But we cannot afford to act as
if this situation is unique in base
ball's history, and it certainly does
not warrant the knee-jerk reactions
many writers have voiced.
Like many sports, baseball has
undergone many changes through
out the years. I mean, the spitball
was not outlawed until 1920, and
was still in wide use through the
19605. The minimum home-run dis
tance in ballparks was raised in 1925
to 250 feet.

I can go on to talk about drop
ping the pitcher's mound a whop
ping five inches in 1969, along with
shrinking the strike zone. No
African Americans were on major
league rosters until 1947. A brand
new position was added to the
