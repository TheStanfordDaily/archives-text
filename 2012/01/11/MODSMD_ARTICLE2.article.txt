# Mid-Year Convocation sets 2015 up for rest of Farm years
## ACADEMICS SIS looks to increase future participation 
### LAURYN WILLIAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Preliminary results from an
ongoing study conducted by Ellen
Woods, associate vice provost for
Undergraduate Education, have
determined that 70 percent of the
current sophomore class has been
enrolled in either an Introductory
Seminar or a September Studies
course whether Sophomore
College or Arts Intensive since
beginning at Stanford.
The study will conclude with
the Class of 2014 and will help the
Office of Undergraduate Educa
tion pinpoint whom it does not
reach, why it does not reach them
and what it can do to improve the
program. At this time, it does not
seek to assess the affects of Stan
ford Introductory Studies (SIS)
on the undergraduate experience.
SIS collected this data through
a survey sent to the current soph
omore class that included both

multiple choice and open-ended
questions. The survey was sent to
all members of the Class of 2014
who had not taken an Introducto
ry Seminar in July. SIS analyzed
enrollment data to see which stu
dents were new to introductory
seminars at the conclusion of fall
quarter, and will continue to do so
after winter and spring quarters.
The survey focused on the
freshman experience in particu
lar.
The impact of dorm assign
ments on participation was one
significant area that the study
shed light upon.
"All the dorm participation
rates were almost identical, ex
cluding FroSoCo [Freshman-
Sophomore College], where par
ticipation rates are significantly
higher," Woods said. "There does
n't seem to be any relationship be
tween where you live in the fresh
man year and whether or not you
enroll in a seminar."

Because of this, differences in
residential advising have been
discounted as a significant factor
in Introductory Studies enroll
ment.

Though the data shows an
overwhelmingly positive student
response to introductory pro
grams, the evidence from Woods'
study is now being analyzed in
order to determine why the other
30 percent of students have not
taken advantage of these pro
grams.

The Introductory Seminars
web page heralds the seminars as
a place where students are provid
ed with a "focused, in-depth envi
ronment to try out an area of in
terest." Yet, open-ended respons
es to the study identified intimida
tion as a major reason why certain
students decide not to apply.

"Some students would rather
be in a large class or are intimidat-

Ed by being in a small class with a professor," Woods
said.
In order to eliminate this "intimidation factor," the
Office of Undergraduate Education is preliminarily
seeking to collaborate with the Center for Teaching
and Learning (CTL), undergraduate advising pro
grams and other existing resources to determine
remedies.
According to Woods, some students may believe
that their "undergraduate education is complete
without it" when it comes to Introductory Studies.
The study identifies discouragement as another
important factor. Students who wish to enroll in In
troductory Studies and September Studies must first
submit an essay application and are hand-selected by
the instructor of their course. Space is limited, and
clear evidence suggests that some students who are
not accepted decide not to apply to future seminars.
This fall, the Introductory Studies program made
concerted efforts to reverse this cycle.
"We sent a message to all students who did not get
in referring them to what we learned from the Re
silience Project," Woods said. "Perhaps to avoid the
discouragement of being turned down."
Still, of all students who do not enroll, the vast ma
jority are unable to fit the seminar into their schedule
of classes, according to Woods. Because it is clear that
seminars cluster at a particular time of day, the Office
of Undergraduate Education will work on recom
mendations to faculty and departments that will
spread class times throughout the day.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education Harry
Elam agrees that this assumption about schedule con
flicts is the most fitting. "Most Stanford students want
to take advantage of everything we offer, so I think it's
more [an issue] of fitting a seminar into crowded
schedules than it is a strong commitment not to take
one," Elam wrote in an email to The Daily.
The results of this study will continue to be as
sessed throughout this year and are part of a "general
program evaluation" that is done on a regular basis by
numerous program directors on campus.
Though other universities offer seminars for fresh
man and sophomores, Elam believes that Stanford's
program is unique in that it provides "almost a perfect
teaching and learning situation, [in which] faculty
teach seminars on topics of special interest, motivat
ed students enroll in the seminar and together the fac
ulty and students explore a topic they both care
about."
According to Woods, the purpose of this study of
the Class of 2014 is clear.
"We want students to know that Introductory
Seminars are a valuable educational experience, we
have space for them and we want to serve them."

cluding FroSoCo [Freshman-
Sophomore College], where par
ticipation rates are significantly
higher," Woods said. "There does
n't seem to be any relationship be
tween where you live in the fresh
man year and whether or not you
enroll in a seminar."

Because of this, differences in
residential advising have been
discounted as a significant factor
in Introductory Studies enroll
ment.

Though the data shows an
overwhelmingly positive student
response to introductory pro
grams, the evidence from Woods'
study is now being analyzed in
order to determine why the other
30 percent of students have not
taken advantage of these pro
grams.

Ed by being in a small class with a professor," Woods
said.
In order to eliminate this "intimidation factor," the
Office of Undergraduate Education is preliminarily
seeking to collaborate with the Center for Teaching
and Learning (CTL), undergraduate advising pro
grams and other existing resources to determine
remedies.
According to Woods, some students may believe
that their "undergraduate education is complete
without it" when it comes to Introductory Studies.
The study identifies discouragement as another
important factor. Students who wish to enroll in In
troductory Studies and September Studies must first
submit an essay application and are hand-selected by
the instructor of their course. Space is limited, and
clear evidence suggests that some students who are
not accepted decide not to apply to future seminars.
This fall, the Introductory Studies program made
concerted efforts to reverse this cycle.
"We sent a message to all students who did not get
in referring them to what we learned from the Re
silience Project," Woods said. "Perhaps to avoid the
discouragement of being turned down."
Still, of all students who do not enroll, the vast ma
jority are unable to fit the seminar into their schedule
of classes, according to Woods. Because it is clear that
seminars cluster at a particular time of day, the Office
of Undergraduate Education will work on recom
mendations to faculty and departments that will
spread class times throughout the day.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education Harry
Elam agrees that this assumption about schedule con
flicts is the most fitting. "Most Stanford students want
to take advantage of everything we offer, so I think it's
more [an issue] of fitting a seminar into crowded
schedules than it is a strong commitment not to take
one," Elam wrote in an email to The Daily.
The results of this study will continue to be as
sessed throughout this year and are part of a "general
program evaluation" that is done on a regular basis by
numerous program directors on campus.
Though other universities offer seminars for fresh
man and sophomores, Elam believes that Stanford's
program is unique in that it provides "almost a perfect
teaching and learning situation, [in which] faculty
teach seminars on topics of special interest, motivat
ed students enroll in the seminar and together the fac
ulty and students explore a topic they both care
about."
According to Woods, the purpose of this study of
the Class of 2014 is clear.
"We want students to know that Introductory
Seminars are a valuable educational experience, we
have space for them and we want to serve them."

Preliminary results from an
ongoing study conducted by Ellen
Woods, associate vice provost for
Undergraduate Education, have
determined that 70 percent of the
current sophomore class has been
enrolled in either an Introductory
Seminar or a September Studies
course whether Sophomore
College or Arts Intensive since
beginning at Stanford.
The study will conclude with
the Class of 2014 and will help the
Office of Undergraduate Educa
tion pinpoint whom it does not
reach, why it does not reach them
and what it can do to improve the
program. At this time, it does not
seek to assess the affects of Stan
ford Introductory Studies (SIS)
on the undergraduate experience.
SIS collected this data through
a survey sent to the current soph
omore class that included both

multiple choice and open-ended
questions. The survey was sent to
all members of the Class of 2014
who had not taken an Introducto
ry Seminar in July. SIS analyzed
enrollment data to see which stu
dents were new to introductory
seminars at the conclusion of fall
quarter, and will continue to do so
after winter and spring quarters.
The survey focused on the
freshman experience in particu
lar.
The impact of dorm assign
ments on participation was one
significant area that the study
shed light upon.
"All the dorm participation
rates were almost identical, ex
cluding FroSoCo [Freshman-
Sophomore College], where par
ticipation rates are significantly
higher," Woods said. "There does
n't seem to be any relationship be
tween where you live in the fresh
man year and whether or not you
enroll in a seminar."

Because of this, differences in
residential advising have been
discounted as a significant factor
