# Mid-Year Convocation sets 2015 up for rest of Farm years
## ACADEMICS SIS looks to increase future participation

Preliminary results from an
ongoing study conducted by Ellen
Woods, associate vice provost for
Undergraduate Education, have
determined that 70 percent of the
current sophomore class has been
enrolled in either an Introductory
Seminar or a September Studies
course whether Sophomore
College or Arts Intensive since
beginning at Stanford.
The study will conclude with
the Class of 2014 and will help the
Office of Undergraduate Educa
tion pinpoint whom it does not
reach, why it does not reach them
and what it can do to improve the
program. At this time, it does not
seek to assess the affects of Stan
ford Introductory Studies (SIS)
on the undergraduate experience.
SIS collected this data through
a survey sent to the current soph
omore class that included both

multiple choice and open-ended
questions. The survey was sent to
all members of the Class of 2014
who had not taken an Introducto
ry Seminar in July. SIS analyzed
enrollment data to see which stu
dents were new to introductory
seminars at the conclusion of fall
quarter, and will continue to do so
after winter and spring quarters.
The survey focused on the
freshman experience in particu
lar.
The impact of dorm assign
ments on participation was one
significant area that the study
shed light upon.
"All the dorm participation
rates were almost identical, ex
cluding FroSoCo [Freshman-
Sophomore College], where par
ticipation rates are significantly
higher," Woods said. "There does
n't seem to be any relationship be
tween where you live in the fresh
man year and whether or not you
enroll in a seminar."

Because of this, differences in
residential advising have been
discounted as a significant factor
in Introductory Studies enroll
ment.

Though the data shows an
overwhelmingly positive student
response to introductory pro
grams, the evidence from Woods'
study is now being analyzed in
order to determine why the other
30 percent of students have not
taken advantage of these pro
grams.

The Introductory Seminars
web page heralds the seminars as
a place where students are provid
ed with a "focused, in-depth envi
ronment to try out an area of in
terest." Yet, open-ended respons
es to the study identified intimida
tion as a major reason why certain
students decide not to apply.

"Some students would rather
be in a large class or are intimidat-
