# CS seeks greater female involvement

Perhaps even more remarkable
than the record-breaking enroll
ment in CS 106A last quarter was
the percentage of those 594 students
who were female.
"We're getting pretty close to
gender parity," said Mehran Saha
mi, BS '92, M.S. '93, Ph.D. '99, an as
sociate professor of computer sci
ence who teaches the course in the
fall.
Gender parity, if only in the in
troductory class, is encouraging
news for a department that is over
whelmingly male.
Unfortunately, the percentage of
female students in computer science
drops off considerably from 106A,
even though, according to Roberts
and Sahami, women do just as well
and report liking it just as much as
men.
Each subsequent course in the
track becomes more and more
male-dominated. The percentage of
female CS majors remains only 20
percent, according to computer sci
ence professor Eric Roberts.
The number of women matters,
said Roberts, because universities
are producing a tenth of the com
puter scientists that the industry is
demanding, because existing tech
nology reflects its producers and be
cause the major can be empowering,
especially in terms of salary.
That number is an improvement
on recent years in 2009, only 8.1
percent of students graduating in
computer science were women
but represents no change in the
longer run. Roberts, who has taught
at Stanford since 1990, remembers
the percentage of women in the
major ranging from 14 to 26 percent.

"It's one of the lowest of the en
gineering disciplines," Roberts said.
Last quarter, computer science
major Sophia Westwood 'l3 was
among the latest to try and figure

out why that was the case, talking to
professors and doing her own re
search as well.
The issue "is always present, but
pushed under the rug," Westwood
said. "The actual numbers ... were
pretty stark."
"Fundamentally, it's a simple
idea," Westwood said. "We're get
ting all these people in 106A and
we're having trouble keeping
them."
Each person's case for not con
tinuing is unique, she said, but some
of the deterrents she found were
rooted in stereotypes and miscon
ceptions of the major.
To combat that perception, the
department overhauled the major
in 2008, adding tracks, like Artificial
Intelligence and Graphics, which
catered to students' interests, and
emphasizing the multidisciplinary
nature of computer science.
Another obstacle is the sense
that computer science can be soli
tary and for some, socially isolating.
"The stereotype of the socially
awkward nerd has some basis in re
ality," Roberts said. "I've always
thought the milieu in CS can be off
putting to people who put more
value in the social side of things."
But Westwood said she believes
this is not usually the case, especially
with the department's recent multi
disciplinary focus.
"Other interests make you a bet
ter computer scientist," she said.
"You're not going to be in a cubicle;
you're not going to be antisocial and
you're not going to have a monitor
tan. Unless you want to."
The field's gender gap can be
self-reinforcing. With fewer female
role models in computer science,
women can shy away.
"For a lot of guys, their default is
to continue and for a lot of girls, the
default isn't," Westwood said.
