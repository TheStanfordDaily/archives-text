# CS seeks greater female involvement
## 
### NEEL THAKKAR 
Perhaps even more remarkable
than the record-breaking enroll
ment in CS 106A last quarter was
the percentage of those 594 students
who were female.
"We're getting pretty close to
gender parity," said Mehran Saha
mi, BS '92, M.S. '93, Ph.D. '99, an as
sociate professor of computer sci
ence who teaches the course in the
fall.
Gender parity, if only in the in
troductory class, is encouraging
news for a department that is over
whelmingly male.
Unfortunately, the percentage of
female students in computer science
drops off considerably from 106A,
even though, according to Roberts
and Sahami, women do just as well
and report liking it just as much as
men.
Each subsequent course in the
track becomes more and more
male-dominated. The percentage of
female CS majors remains only 20
percent, according to computer sci
ence professor Eric Roberts.
The number of women matters,
said Roberts, because universities
are producing a tenth of the com
puter scientists that the industry is
demanding, because existing tech
nology reflects its producers and be
cause the major can be empowering,
especially in terms of salary.
That number is an improvement
on recent years in 2009, only 8.1
percent of students graduating in
computer science were women
but represents no change in the
longer run. Roberts, who has taught
at Stanford since 1990, remembers
the percentage of women in the
major ranging from 14 to 26 percent.

"It's one of the lowest of the en
gineering disciplines," Roberts said.
Last quarter, computer science
major Sophia Westwood 'l3 was
among the latest to try and figure

out why that was the case, talking to
professors and doing her own re
search as well.
The issue "is always present, but
pushed under the rug," Westwood
said. "The actual numbers ... were
pretty stark."
"Fundamentally, it's a simple
idea," Westwood said. "We're get
ting all these people in 106A and
we're having trouble keeping
them."
Each person's case for not con
tinuing is unique, she said, but some
of the deterrents she found were
rooted in stereotypes and miscon
ceptions of the major.
To combat that perception, the
department overhauled the major
in 2008, adding tracks, like Artificial
Intelligence and Graphics, which
catered to students' interests, and
emphasizing the multidisciplinary
nature of computer science.
Another obstacle is the sense
that computer science can be soli
tary and for some, socially isolating.
"The stereotype of the socially
awkward nerd has some basis in re
ality," Roberts said. "I've always
thought the milieu in CS can be off
putting to people who put more
value in the social side of things."
But Westwood said she believes
this is not usually the case, especially
with the department's recent multi
disciplinary focus.
"Other interests make you a bet
ter computer scientist," she said.
"You're not going to be in a cubicle;
you're not going to be antisocial and
you're not going to have a monitor
tan. Unless you want to."
The field's gender gap can be
self-reinforcing. With fewer female
role models in computer science,
women can shy away.
"For a lot of guys, their default is
to continue and for a lot of girls, the
default isn't," Westwood said.
Changing that default setting for
women, Westwood realized, can be
as easy as sitting down to speak with
and advise them.
"For a lot of them [female com
puter science majors] there was a
part where someone reached out
and said, 'You're really good at
this,"'Westwood said.
Beginning last quarter, West
wood began a program in which sec
tion leaders in the 106 series would
reach out to talented freshman and
sophomore women to talk to them
about a future in the subject.
Although the program could
not reach everyone it sought to,
Westwood ended up speaking one
on-one with just over 30 women of
the 60 she contacted.
Bonnie McLindon 'l4 was one
of the students Westwood engaged.
After taking 1068 in the fall, she
was considering majoring in the
subject. And the ensuing discussion

with Westwood "definitely solidi
fied my declaring CS," McLindon
said.
"I felt very included in the
community," McLindon said. "It
made me want to reach out to the
other girls in 1068 [who were]
with me."
Westwood also encouraged
the students she spoke with tap into
another effort by the department:
recruiting more female section
leaders for the 106 series.
That way, "the students see a
greater number of female role mod
els," Sahami said.
The program seems to be work
ing, as McLindon said she is apply
ing to become a section leader in
the spring.
Westwood plans to continue and
expand her outreach program into
this quarter and beyond.
"The building blocks are in
place," she said, referring to the re
vamped major and the pull of the
troubled economy. "A push here
would help."
