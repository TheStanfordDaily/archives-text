## Harvard prof, addresses 2012 'Hacktivism' 
### JOSH HOYT STAFF WRITER 
In a talk given at Stanford Law School
on Tuesday, Harvard Professor of Law and
Computer Science Jonathan Zittrain ex
pressed concern both over the Internet
being too consolidated and controlled, as
well as concern about security issues high
lighted by "hacktivism" in 2011.
The event, 'Hacktivism: Anonymous,
Lulzsec and Cybercrime in 2012 and Be
yond,' was sponsored by CodeX: The Stan
ford Center for Legal Informatics. CodeX is
a multidisciplinary laboratory run by the
University that seeks "to explore ways in
which information technology can be used
to enhance the quality and efficiency of our
legal system while decreasing its cost," ac
cording to its website.
Zittrain, co-founder and co-director of
the Berkman Center for Internet & Society
at Harvard, has often concerned himself
with potentially harmful censorship and
limits to freedom on the Internet, but in this
talk, focused on one major drawback: major
security concerns that are often beyond the
skill level of the general public to compre
hend and address.
"About a year ago it dawned on me that
our information environment is one in
which, if you anger the wrong people, your
entire life is vulnerable," Zittrain said. "That
is a high cost to pay for security, and it car
ries certain drawbacks that we shouldn't
have to entertain."
Zittrain described fears over the worst
case scenario cyber attacks getting the bulk
of public attention like an attack that
disables the power grid or interferes with a
nuclear plant. He addressed such scenarios
as real, but the product of "hype."
Instead he singled out attacks like dis
tributed denial of service attacks (DDoS),
which were at the center of many important
news stories in 2011, including attacks on
governments in the Middle East and on
companies that had severed ties with Wik
iLeaks.
Zittrain related how Anonymous, a
loose Internet group known for activist

hacking, retaliated against HB Gary Feder
al, an Internet security consulting firm, and
its CEO Aaron Barr. Aaron Barr had his
Twitter and Facebook hacked to announce
his home address and social security num
ber. Additionally, all of the internal compa
ny emails were hacked and released.
Ultimately, Anonymous itself was com
promised and forced to announce: "We re
gret to inform you today that our network
has been compromised by a former IRC
operator and fellow helper named 'Ryan."'
"I don't know if you've seen Reservoir
Dogs where everybody is pointing their
guns at each other," Zittrain said. "But this
is where I say 'things have gone too far.'"
Everybody is vulnerable in this environ
ment, including expert consultants in cyber
security, according to Zittrain.
"This box in front of me [pointing at his
laptop] contains all of my emails on it, and if
Anonymous were mad enough at me, I
have every confidence that they would be in
this box within 12 hours," Zittrain said.
"Maybe if I broke it over my knee and
never plugged it in again ..." he joked.
Zittrain did not offer any specific solu
tions to the balance, but he favors a solution
that would be "bottom up" in nature, not a
government-driven solution. He looks to
models like Wikipedia for bottom-up gov
ernance that works. Zittrain acknowledged
that any solution would have to work with
the nature of the consumers.

"How do we build systems that are still
extremely simple and intuitive to use, but

capture experimentalist spirit that
was so important to the develop
ment of the Internet?" Zittrain
asked.
Zittrain will not have to come
up with all of the answers himself,
as students in a Law class called

'ldeas for A Better Internet' at
tended the event.The class has stu
dents from both Stanford and Har
vard who will be presenting their
work in an event on Wed., Jan. 18.
Eli Marschner, a second-year
graduate student in computer sci
ence, is working on the issues relat
ed to journalism on the Internet.
He came away from this talk pon
dering the differences between on
line activism and traditional ac
tivism.

"With online civil disobedience,
if you want to call it that, it is not
highly organized groups who are
dedicating their time and risking
being arrested," Marschner said.
"It might be somebody in their
basement running downloaded
software their friend told them to
download. The scale is fundamen
tally different."
