## Area lacks concern over snow Bay Area water supply holds steady despite record lows in State snowfall 
### NARDOS GIRMA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over the past week, Stanford students have
fretted about the low level of snowfall in the
Tahoe area in anticipation of dorm ski trips
during the coming weekends. What students
have not realized is that beyond inconvenienc
ing skiers and snowboarders, this low snowfall
could potentially have a future impact on Cal
ifornia's water supply.
The amount of water in the snow of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains is currently 83 per
cent below its Jan. 3 average and could impact
the San Francisco water system, which current
ly gets about 85 percent of its water from the
Sierra Nevadas.
The system, which serves about half of the
Bay Area, including San Francisco, the Penin
sula and parts of Santa Clara and Alameda
County, provides water from the Fletch
Hetchy water system, which is fed by Sierra
runoff
Although the decreased snowfall in the
Sierra may sound alarming, especially consid
ering its link to the Bay Area and Stanford
water supplies, there is little reason to be too
concerned, according to Steve Ritchie, assis
tant general manager at the San Francisco
Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC).
"Basically, coming into this year, the Hetch
Hetchy reservoir is full or as close to full as we
can have it this time of year," Ritchie said. "So
right at the moment, we are not overly con
cerned; but we are certainly keeping an eye on
the amount of snowfall up [in the Sierras]."
Tom Zigterman, Associate Director and
Civil Infrastructure Manager for Stanford,
who manages the water systems here on cam
pus, cited heavy precipitation in the past few
years as the main reason for this.
"It isn't as alarming as it might seem that we
haven't had as much rainfall this rainy season
to date because the reservoirs are quite full in
the state from the prior two years of good rain
fall," Zigterman said. "It would take two to
three years of rainfall below normal to start se
riously impacting California's water supply."
This does not mean that a drought is entire
ly out of the question, but rather that if one did
occur, Californians would not feel the effects of
it for a few years.
"This could be the beginning of a drought,"

Ritchie said. "Would we see the effects of it di
rectly? No, because we still have lots of carry
over storage from last year, but that means we
have to be extra cautious going into next year."
Additionally, California has reason to re
main optimistic about future rainfall.
"While December 2011 was dry, typically
January through May account for about two
thirds of the water year precipitation," wrote
Margaret Laporte, associate director of Utili
ties for Water Resources and Environmental
Quality for Stanford, in an email to The Daily.
"In the past two years we have had rains past
May into June. So while precipitation to date is
lagging, there are a number of historically wet
months ahead of us."
Even if a dry winter were to occur, the Bay
Area would be able to depend on the full reser
voirs. Stanford, which receives a majority of its
water from the SFPUC, also would not be af
fected by a dry winter.
The SFPUC is one of three water supplies
for Stanford, making up 100 percent of the
University's potable water supply—water that
is suitable for drinking. Stanford's non-potable
service water comes from creeks in the
foothills, rainfall runoff and ground water, and
is used for purposes such as irrigation and toi
let-flush.
If a drought were actually declared in the
future, customers of the SFPUC could be ex
pected to decrease their water consumption,
something that the Santa Clara Valley Water
District has had to mandate in the past.
Water conservation is not new to Stanford.
The University has already made immense
strides in water conservation, even without a
drought, decreasing average daily potable
water use from 2.7 million gallons per day to
below 2.2 million gallons per day, despite con
tinued campus growth.
Additionally, Stanford is continuing to ex
plore conservation measures such as retro
fitting fixtures and converting irrigation from
potable water to non-potable water supply.
Although Californians will most likely not
experience any effects of a dry winter in the im
mediate future, the current dry spell does cast
a light on California's water systems.
According to Zigterman, "It continues to
indicate that we need to plan long-term in the
state and particularly in dry climates like we
have in California and the West, to be careful
about our water supplies and use them pru
dently."

ing skiers and snowboarders, this low snowfall
could potentially have a future impact on Cal
ifornia's water supply.
The amount of water in the snow of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains is currently 83 per
cent below its Jan. 3 average and could impact
the San Francisco water system, which current
ly gets about 85 percent of its water from the
Sierra Nevadas.
The system, which serves about half of the
Bay Area, including San Francisco, the Penin
sula and parts of Santa Clara and Alameda
County, provides water from the Fletch
Hetchy water system, which is fed by Sierra
runoff
Although the decreased snowfall in the
Sierra may sound alarming, especially consid
ering its link to the Bay Area and Stanford
water supplies, there is little reason to be too
concerned, according to Steve Ritchie, assis
tant general manager at the San Francisco
Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC).
"Basically, coming into this year, the Hetch
Hetchy reservoir is full or as close to full as we
can have it this time of year," Ritchie said. "So
right at the moment, we are not overly con
cerned; but we are certainly keeping an eye on
the amount of snowfall up [in the Sierras]."
Tom Zigterman, Associate Director and
Civil Infrastructure Manager for Stanford,
who manages the water systems here on cam
pus, cited heavy precipitation in the past few
years as the main reason for this.
"It isn't as alarming as it might seem that we
haven't had as much rainfall this rainy season
to date because the reservoirs are quite full in
the state from the prior two years of good rain
fall," Zigterman said. "It would take two to
three years of rainfall below normal to start se
riously impacting California's water supply."
This does not mean that a drought is entire
ly out of the question, but rather that if one did
occur, Californians would not feel the effects of
it for a few years.
"This could be the beginning of a drought,"

Ritchie said. "Would we see the effects of it di
rectly? No, because we still have lots of carry
over storage from last year, but that means we
have to be extra cautious going into next year."
Additionally, California has reason to re
main optimistic about future rainfall.
"While December 2011 was dry, typically
January through May account for about two
thirds of the water year precipitation," wrote
Margaret Laporte, associate director of Utili
ties for Water Resources and Environmental
Quality for Stanford, in an email to The Daily.
"In the past two years we have had rains past
May into June. So while precipitation to date is
lagging, there are a number of historically wet
months ahead of us."
Even if a dry winter were to occur, the Bay
Area would be able to depend on the full reser
voirs. Stanford, which receives a majority of its
water from the SFPUC, also would not be af
fected by a dry winter.
The SFPUC is one of three water supplies
for Stanford, making up 100 percent of the
University's potable water supply—water that
is suitable for drinking. Stanford's non-potable
service water comes from creeks in the
foothills, rainfall runoff and ground water, and
is used for purposes such as irrigation and toi
let-flush.
If a drought were actually declared in the
future, customers of the SFPUC could be ex
pected to decrease their water consumption,
something that the Santa Clara Valley Water
District has had to mandate in the past.
Water conservation is not new to Stanford.
The University has already made immense
strides in water conservation, even without a
drought, decreasing average daily potable
water use from 2.7 million gallons per day to
below 2.2 million gallons per day, despite con
tinued campus growth.
Additionally, Stanford is continuing to ex
plore conservation measures such as retro
fitting fixtures and converting irrigation from
potable water to non-potable water supply.
Although Californians will most likely not
experience any effects of a dry winter in the im
mediate future, the current dry spell does cast
a light on California's water systems.
According to Zigterman, "It continues to
indicate that we need to plan long-term in the
state and particularly in dry climates like we
have in California and the West, to be careful
about our water supplies and use them pru
dently."
