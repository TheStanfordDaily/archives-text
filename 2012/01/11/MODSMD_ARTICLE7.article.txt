than extensive in nature.

T|ie last year has been a tur
bulent time for Stanford
University with broad im
plications for the future character
and scope of the institution. This
manifested itself most dramatical
ly in the rise of Stanford as a fa
vorite in the high-stakes competi
tion to build a new technology
campus in New York City (for
which Stanford was prepared to
spend $2.5 billion), and in Stan
ford's subsequent withdrawal of its
application. Closer to home, 2011
saw the beginning of work on the
$5 billion expansion of the Stan
ford Medical Center, dubbed
"Project: Renewal," as well as the
opening of a new campus for the
Graduate School of Business;
major progress in the construction
of the Bing Concert Hall; the new
Arrillaga Family Dining Com
mons; and other smaller projects.
While we regret that Stanford
and New York were unable to find
a mutually beneficial agreement,
we respect the University's decision
to look after the interests of its com
munity in the face of the supposed
ly rising demands placed upon it by
Mayor Bloomberg and the city
government. Though details of the
negotiations remain vague and
University staff members have re
sponded amiably when asked for
comment, the early enthusiasm on
the part of Stanford University
President John Hennessey for a
New York campus suggests that
something rather drastic likely hap
pened to upend the situation. Nev
ertheless, the Stanford environ
ment is set to continue to continue
its improvement in 2012, though
the changes will be intensive rather

One of the most encouraging re
cent developments is the new
Campus Energy Systems Im
provement project recently ap
proved by the University Board of
Trustees. As any student who has
seen the vast cloud of hot steam
that towers over the University on
chilly mornings can attest, the cur
rent system can surely be im
proved upon.The $438 million dol
lar plan is set to significantly re
duce Stanford's water and energy
use. While the benefits of this new
infrastructure will be largely invis
ible, they will be quite real.
More saliently, Stanford's short
and medium term development
looks to be dominated by two
broad projects: the aforemen
tioned expansion of the Medical
Center and the creation of a new
arts district centered on the exist
ing Cantor Arts Center that will
encompass the future Bing Con
cert Hall as well as a recently ap
proved $B5 million, 96,000 square
foot building that will host the Uni
versity's Art and Art History de
partments.
The simultaneous construction
of a state-of-the-art hospital for
both treatment and research and
the arts district taking shape near
Museum Way say a great deal
about Stanford's institutional
identity. In an age of specialization,
Stanford maintains a strong pres
ence across many different disci
plines and fields of human endeav
or. If the drama and change of 2011
is any indication, 2012 promises to
be another newsworthy chapter in
the ongoing creation of a universi
ty that began in 1891.
