## Stop human trafficking 
### NADEJDA MARQUES Manager of the Program on Human Rights at Stanford 
By an act of Congress, today,
Jan. 11, is Human Traffick
ing Awareness Day in the
United States. President Obama
has taken important steps to rec
ognize the nation's responsibility
to "prevent, identify and aggres
sively combat" human trafficking.
The Department of State has in
cluded the United States in its
Trafficking in Persons Report 2010
and individual states have adopted
important legislation to combat
human trafficking. For instance, on
Jan. 1, California became the first
state to require major retailers and
manufacturers doing business
within its borders to publicly dis
close measures taken to eradicate
forced labor and human traffick
ing from their supply and distribu
tion chains. However, as many of
these measures do not provide for
clear penalties but instead seek to
provide citizens and consumers
with information on the conditions
under which the products they
purchase are produced, they are
unlikely to effectuate significant
change.
Human trafficking is a global
problem that calls for a global re
sponse, because, as President
Obama observed in 2011, "no
country can claim immunity from
the scourge of human rights abus
es, or from the responsibility to
confront them." In fact, no govern
ment can claim immunity, nor can
intergovernmental organizations
such as the United Nations, do
mestic businesses, multinational
corporations and civil society.
There is a convenient reluctance to
admit that trafficking is a response
to market demands, weak or per
verse labor and immigration legis
lation, absence of penalties for
abusers and obscene economic
and development disparities, in
cluding gender and ethnic in
equities.
A Human Trafficking Aware
ness Day serves to call attention to
a problem that we've been avoid
ing for centuries. We are so good at
avoiding the scope of the problem
that we are unable even to put a
number to it. Estimates vary wide
ly, ranging from 4 million to 27 mil

lion victims per year. The nomen
clature employed is as unclear as
the breadth of the problem: sex
trafficking, bonded labor, forced
child labor, debt bondage, involun
tary domestic servitude and child
soldiers are all terms employed to
subsets of the broader problem.
There is an urgent need to raise
awareness to this problem and the
millions who are victimized by
trafficking. To begin with, a clear
understanding of the problem
would be a good start. The United
Nations defines trafficking in
human beings by emphasizing
three elements: the movement or
receipt of people; some form of
threat, force, coercion or deceit;
and the purpose of exploitation.
We need greater investment in ef
fort to stop trafficking. We should
dedicate more resources to re
search, developing interdiscipli
nary methodologies that include
the causes and conditions of vul
nerability among different groups
in the varied contexts of war and
peace to respond and combat the
problem more effectively. We
should develop public policy to
curb the growing economic in
equalities that exacerbate condi
tions in which human trafficking
tends to occur. For our part, the
Program on Human Rights at the
Center on Democracy, Develop
ment and Rule of Law (CDDRL)
will sponsor an international
speaker series and workshops
over the next two quarters to pro
mote debate and discussion on so
lutions for human trafficking
worldwide.
In short, we are trying to pro
mote an approach that includes in
ternational cooperation as well as
an active role for local and interna
tional business and organizations,
the United Nations, the World
Bank, philanthropic institutions
and non-governmental organiza
tion an approach that will work
today, Jan. 11, as well as the other
364 days each year in which human
trafficking continues.
