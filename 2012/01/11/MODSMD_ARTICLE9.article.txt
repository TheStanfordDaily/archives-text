## America's next top psychologist 
### Amanda Ach 
Since I'm sure you were all
wondering, my break was ex
cellent. I spent time with my
family, celebrated both Christmas
and Hanukkah (being a cultural
Jew is fun), ate lots of delicious
food, opened presents, ate even
more food the list goes on. But
still, the best part of my vacation
was the unlimited TV-watching
time. I've become so accustomed to
Megavideo's poor quality and
ridiculous 72-minute rule that I
sometimes forget the pure unadul
terated joy that comes from being
able to plop myself on a couch and
watch TV uninterrupted for hours
and hours. One day over break I
watched a whole season of Top
Chef thank you, Bravo
marathons instead of looking
for a job. But as much as I love TV,
even I have to admit that there are
some flaws in reality television.
First of all, I don't understand why
the contestants on Top Chef keep
making desserts even when we
know it usually gets them eliminat
ed. It just doesn't seem worth the
risk to me. But second, and perhaps
more importantly, there is just so
much reality TV. Some of the shows
are great (you can never have too
many Real Housewives), but some
are bizarre and even disturbing
(Toddlers & Tiaras? Really?). And
while reality TV may be weirder
than ever, the fact of the matter is,
where there's growth like that,
there have to be jobs. Unfortunate
ly, I don't think I qualify for a spot
on Jersey Shore; but in my research
I found that there are other, less
GTL-based ways to work in the
world of reality TV. This brings us
to today's job topic: a reality TV
psychologist.

Now, hopefully this doesn't
come as a shock to you, but reality
TV is somewhat staged. Networks
want their programs to be enter
taining for the viewer, and in order
to ensure that this happens, they
hire psychologists to screen partici
pants for severe psychological dis
orders and other potential liabili
ties. These psychologists evaluate
the various contestants, create psy
chological profiles and help casting
directors create the most entertain
ing casts.
While it may sound like a lot of
fun (albeit a tad evil) to exploit
people's psychological problems
for my enjoyment, the majority of
the work you would do as a reality
TV psychologist actually involves
helping the contestants handle the
psychological trauma associated
with participating in a reality TV
show. Beyond just creating dynam
ic, sometimes explosive casts, you
work with each participant individ
ually throughout the whole process
and after the show has ended. It's
incredibly important work
there have been several suicides
among reality TV cast members re
cently, highlighting the need for
more counseling and other psycho
logical support structures.
Of course, in order to be a reali
ty TV psychologist, you need to be
a licensed, practicing psychologist.
This means attending either gradu
ate or medical school and most
likely working in a clinical setting
for a few years before you can
begin working with a reality TV
show. The downside is that you
can't start this job right after gradu
ation, but on the plus side, it pays re
ally well, so you might find it's
worth the wait.

As a reality TV psychologist,
you will also have the benefit of
flexibility. Most reality TV psychol
ogists are independent contractors,
taking on the cast members along
with some private patients in a
standard clinical setting. This al
lows you more flexibility in terms
of how much you want to work
with reality TV participants and
how much you want to work with
normal, sane people. If you are
more interested in the casting as
pect of reality TV psychology, you
can opt to work for a company
whose job it is to screen contest
ants, including background checks
as well as psychological evalua
tions.
Becoming a reality TV psychol
ogist is a great way to use your aca
demic passion to work in the enter
tainment industiy but still truly help
people, which is a pretty unique
combination. The reality (pirn in
tended) is that people aren't that
smart, and they will continue to par
ticipate in reality TV shows regard
less of the psychological risks. As a
reality TV psychologist, you will be
able to help them manage these
risks and make reality TV fun for
everyone. But especially me.
