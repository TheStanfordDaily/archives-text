## ACADEMICS Earth Sciences opens geobiology program 
### BRAD HUANG 
The School of Earth Sciences
will begin interviewing candidates
this quarter to become faculty for
a new program in Geobiology at
Stanford, according to Geological
and Environmental Sciences pro
fessor Jonathan Payne.
Earth Sciences will make a se
ries of hires over the next few years
with the help of a newly formed
search committee, comprised of
faculty from three departments:
Geological and Environmental
Sciences, Environmental Earth
Systems Science and Biology.
"We expect to make three new
hires over the next three years
(i.e., one per year)," wrote Payne,
who is an associate professor in
the new program, in an email to
The Daily.
According to the 2011-12
budget proposal from the School
of Earth Sciences, geobiology is an
emerging multidisciplinary field
that will be "game changing for
the study of the Earth."
"Geobiology is the study of the
co-evolution of Earth and life. It
involves a wide range of ap
proaches, from studies of microbe
mineral interactions to the influ
ence of biological activity on the
solid Earth, oceans and atmos
phere," Payne said.
The primary challenge for the
committee is the scientific breadth
of the applicant pool.
"Given such diverse areas of
expertise among the applicants, it
is challenging [and exciting] to
read and evaluate the application
materials in order to identify the
finalists," Payne said.
Geobiology will not be a full
fledged department. Professor
Pamela Matson, Dean of the

School of Earth Sciences, clarified
in an email: "We are not starting a
new department, but instead hir
ing several faculty that will form
the nucleus of a new, interdiscipli
nary research and educational ini
tiative in geobiology."
Because the search committee
is still searching for new faculty, it
is hard to tell how many new
courses would appear with the
new program the courses are
dependent on the new faculties'
decisions.
However, according to Payne,
it is likely that new introductory
classes will be developed primari
ly on the graduate level, with some
undergraduate courses as an op
tion.
Several other peer institutions
MIT, Caltech and USC have
already formed geobiology pro
grams.
But according to Payne, "Few
of our competitors have major hir
ing initiatives in this area at the
moment."
Payne noted that the field of
geobiology is just coming to the
fore as its own discipline. Paleon
tology was the precursor to geobi
ology, he said.
Geobiology differs from pale
ontology through the emergence
of new biological and geological
research tools, including ge
nomics, isotope geochemistry and
nanoscale characterization of bio
logical and geological materials
and processes.
Through such tools, first avail
able in the late 19905, geobiolo
gists can now investigate phenom
ena in the biosphere and
geosphere.
