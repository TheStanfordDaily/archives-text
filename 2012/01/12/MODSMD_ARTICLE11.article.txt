# Law School launches new China project
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Brendan O'Byrne 
Stanford Law School has
launched the China Guiding Cases
Project (CGCP), a project that
seeks to inform scholars in and
outside of China about legal cases
decided by China's Supreme Peo
ple's Court.
In Nov. 2010 China's Supreme
People's Court decided to insti
tute "guiding cases" that lower
courts would be compelled to fol
low, a major change to the Chi
nese legal system. In addition,
higher Chinese courts implied

harsh consequences if lower
courts refused to follow the deci
sions in these cases.
The CGCP hopes to index
these decisions in an online,
searchable format and translate
them to English.The site will allow
legal experts to post commentary
about the cases, discussing any im
plications or nuances, and will also
allow for dialogue between com
menters and experts. All cases and
commentary will be posted in both
Chinese and English.
The program is led by Mei
Gechlik, a visiting fellow at the
Hoover Institution and a re
searcher at Stanford Law School.
Gechlik has experience working in
Asia and the United States. She
has testified before Congress and
advised the U.N. about China-re
lated issues.
