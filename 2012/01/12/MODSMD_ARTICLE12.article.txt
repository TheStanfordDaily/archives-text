## DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF The
						more things change, the more things stay the same 
### Leslie Brian 
In 2012, we will do everything
perfectly and effortlessly. We
will work out every day, actu
ally read all of the assigned texts
and catch up with all of the peo
ple we meant to see last quarter.
We will go to office hours every
week, roll out to social events and
keep our email inboxes free of
clutter. We vow to be more spon
taneous and to check things off
our Stanford bucket list. Oh, and
obviously, we'll also sleep eight
hours a night. Casual.
It's a nice picture, but a flawed
one. In away, it reminds me of my
middle school mentality towards
our monthly mile run. The night
before the big day, I'd lie in bed
and visualize myself bounding
around the school track. One,
two, then three, four in my
head, those obligatory four laps
wouldn't even leave me winded.
Mind over matter; it was just that
easy!

But no matter how much men
tal energy I expended, I always
had to walk at lap three. Despite
the fact that I never practiced in
between runs, I assumed I'd mag
ically be able to improve at the
next event three weeks later, just
because I willed it to be so.

In a similar way, the dream of
fundamentally revamping your
life overnight just doesn't trans
late into reality. You can dream
about your dozen resolutions 'til
the cows come home, but if you
stop to think about it for a split
second, the realization hits that
there just isn't enough time in a
single day to do it all, let alone do
it all well. Taken individually,
each resolution presents a noble
aspiration who would disagree
with vowing to study harder,
work out more, socialize with old
friends or get more sleep? But
our lives don't exist in a vacuum,
and try as we might, there is only
so much we can do to compart
mentalize our schedules. In the
real world, we all have to choose
between resolutions: do you sleep
more and sacrifice the problem
set? Do you study that much
harder or go to the party? Do you
go to office hours or hit the gym?
There is no one answer: differ
ent circumstances call for differ
ent decisions. However, most
people still insist on thinking
about New Year's resolutions in
an all-or-nothing kind of way. We
believe that resolutions, once ful
filled, will enable us to sidestep
choices between two good things,
when all they are really capable
of is helping us to manage them.
That's why New Year's resolu
tions often fall flat. It's easy to get
trapped in the Stanford feast-or
famine mentality. Instead of tack
ling our resolutions in a slow and
steady, strategic way, we don full
battle attire and swing into ac-

tion, sending out twenty emails
we've meant to write for the past
month, going to the gym reli
giously and booking ourselves
solid with advisor meetings. We
exhaust ourselves during one or
two unsustainable weeks, only to
find ourselves too burnt out to
keep up with any one of our reso
lutions for the rest of the year.
Not every change can be real
ized in a day. But most tasks, no
matter how daunting, can be ac
complished long-term. The prob
lem is that most of us view New
Year's resolutions as quick-fix so
lutions to larger issues; thus, we
employ a flawed approach to fol
lowing through on them.
Every day, we're forced to
make choices about what's im
portant. What we choose is al
ways motivated by something,
but it's where that motivation
comes from that truly matters
when making those decisions.
Most often, you're choosing be
tween two desirable things. We've
all been there: you wake up early
with the intention to go running,
but all your body wants in that
moment is more sleep. Do you
press snooze? If you really do
need the sleep, then sleep! But if
you're just avoiding the day, get
up. The lines are blurry and hard
to distinguish.
My procrastination method of
choice is avoiding what really
needs to get done by fooling my
self into something else that
seems productive at first blush.
(For example, deleting emails
from my inbox appeals to me
much more than reading for
class). What matters isn't really
whether or not you put some
thing off to tomorrow after all,
we are only capable of so much in
a day without going crazy but
whether that choice is a deliber
ate one, motivated by what's real
ly good for you.

We want it all. And we can
have it all. Just not overnight.
Start slowly and give yourself
time to adjust to new habits.
There was a reason why I couldn't
just will myself to run that month
ly mile back in middle school: I
didn't practice. But with enough
repetition, anyone can run a
marathon!

In that case, though, I think I'll
make the deliberate choice not
to.
