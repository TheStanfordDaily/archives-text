# DO'S AND DOO-DOO'S
## Nostalgia! (The Illusion of a Golden Age) 
### Chase Ishii 
Last quarter in my creative
writing class, we performed
an emotional awareness ex
ercise (it's not the heart-warming
Breakfast-Club-moment it sounds
like, though if it was, I would have
most definitely been Emilio Es
tevez). We took a specific state of
being and described the resulting
physical sensations it had upon
our body. For example, humilia
tion = throat and stomach
squeezed together; anger = lungs
slowly filling with sand; Tapatio =

mosh-pit on the tongue.
The most intriguing state was
nostalgia. For some, it invoked the
same golden glow and weightless
ness of gratitude. For others, it was
that sinking emptiness expanding
from the stomach that comes
when one experiences despair or
loneliness (or country music).
Though the memories were heart
felt, they carried with them dis
couragement and hopelessness.
They were the illusive phantoms
of a life once lived. (I may have
meant 'elusive' there, but I think
either one works.) That leads me
to today's advice:
Do: Appreciate the past.
Doo-Doo: Live in the past.
The past is peculiar. (I feel
British whenever I use the word
'peculiar.') The past has an incred
ible influence on our present and
future even though it is just that
time passed. It's obvious the way a
person's emotional, mental and
relational health can be crippled
by a harmful past abuse, addic
tion, betrayal, tragedy sadly,
the list goes on. But there can be a
negative reactionary component
to good memories as well, one that
speaks much more to our present
than our past.
I spent last spring quarter
abroad in Oxford.The majority of
my time was spent writing or re
searching my weekly 10-page tu
torial papers. (I don't say this to

brag, but rather to help paint an
accurate picture ... but also to
brag.) Yet when I think back on
the trip, my memory tends to leave
out the less than desirable parts. I
don't remember pulling multiple
all-nighters, paying double for
everything because the American
dollar is having performance is
sues or being told to stop shouting
in public because my best attempt
at a British accent sounds like the
Geico Gecko. But I do remember
running around the streets of Ed
inburgh, Scotland at midnight and
trying to explain my love for An
gels baseball to a baseball-illiter
ate (and therefore lesser) nation
and getting to attend Will & Kate 's
royal wedding due to a crazy, fluke
mistake with invitation deliveries.
(I don't remember if that last part
actually happened, further prov
ing my argument for the faulty na
ture of memory.)
The Illusion of a Golden Age: a
flawed longing for a fictionalized
past can keep us discontent and
shackled from proceeding in the
present. (Don't believe me? Ask
Owen Wilson's character from
Midnight in Paris.) Take, for in
stance, a break-up, a divorce or a
death; these are very concrete
signs that life pushes forward in
differently, and there are some
things you can't get back. And it's
ok to grieve what has been lost.
That is probably the healthiest and
most honest way to handle
tragedy. But to romanticize the
past as the best life will ever be
paints the present like a prison
and the future as absent of hope.
Scott Hansen, a San Francisco
artist who creates music under the
moniker Tycho, released a breath
taking instrumental record last
year called Dive. (Big thanks to
Thrice's Riley Breckenridge for
the recommendation.) This is
what Hansen had to say about the
record: "Nostalgia is a common

thread in my work, but this album
wasn't driven by that idea. I see
these songs as artifacts from a fu
ture which might have more in
common with our past than our
present"
I'm slowly learning (the hard
way, more often than not) that life
moves on and things change. Peo
ple change. They walk in and out
of your life, sometimes forever.
And even if they remain, there
may be no returning to what was
once had. But just because you've
lost one relationship doesn't mean
you can't have a comparable one
down the road with someone you
meet tomorrow. While it is often
easier to cling to the momentary
comfort of the past, it is better to
hope in the golden prospect of the
future.

It's no surprise that trying to go
back is the biggest deterrent to
moving forward. Living in the past
is not living at all. It should be
called "loitering in the past" (and
if the past is anything like the
parking lot of Baskin Robbins in
San Juan Capistrano, loitering
there may be punishable by a $250
fine. San Juan PD, you are unrea
sonable tyrants). The loss of an in
credible past doesn't necessarily
produce a lesser future unless
you let it. If hindsight is 20-20, then
nostalgia is 50-50, and the odds are
in your hands.

Still living in a past relationship,
ladies? Chase would be happy to
help you escape that nostalgia.
