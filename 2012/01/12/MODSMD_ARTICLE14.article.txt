## HEADING EAST OGWUMIKE SISTERS LOOK TO CONTINUE DOMINANCE IN ROCKIES 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tonight the Stanford women's basket
ball team starts its first-ever road trip to the
new Pac-12 schools, Utah and Colorado.

The No. 4 Cardinal (13-1, 4-0 Pac-12)
will look to secure its position at the top of
the conference against the Utes (13-1,2-1
Pac-12) in Salt Lake City before heading
up to play the Buffaloes (8-6,1 -2 Pac-12) in
Boulder on Saturday afternoon.

Stanford has met Utah 12 times before
this season, most recently on the road in
November 2010, and has won on every sin
gle occasion so far. However, the Utes may
draw inspiration from their recent road
win against Washington, and the Card
struggled against Oregon State at Maples
last weekend. To cause an upset, though,
Utah will need to find away to deal with
the Ogwumike factor.

Senior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike
has been a consistent force for the Cardi
nal this season and leads the Pac-12 in both
points and rebounds, with 24.5 points per
game and 11.9 rebounds per game. She
won her third Pac-12 Player of the Week
honor this season for her performances
against the Oregon schools last week, and
is a leading contender for national player
of the year.

Though her sister, sophomore forward
Chiney, has not had quite as much consis
tency or success so far this year, both sisters
had double-doubles against Oregon State
last week. The effect these two players can
have on a team was also evident in the pre
vious contest against Oregon, when the
Ducks' strategy revolved around forcing
the Card to shoot from outside, although
freshmen forwards Bonnie Samuelson and
Taylor Greenfield are able to hit threes at
will, forcing the Ducks to pay for their

strategy.
Utah will look down low to its top per
formers, as forwards Michelle Ploufe and
Taryn Wicijowski lead the team with 15.1
and 12.9 points per game respectively. In
terestingly (and unusually, for the Cardi
nal) the Utes might have a height advan
tage in this matchup. Like Chiney Ogwu
mike and four other Stanford players,
Wicijowski stands at 6-foot-3, but the 6-
foot-4 Ploufe and two other Utah forwards
are only beaten in height by the Card's 6-
foot-5 redshirt junior forward Sarah
Boothe. As a result of its height in the
paint, Utah is fourth in the conference in
defensive rebounds, two places below
Stanford, and fifth in blocked shots, two
places above the Card. However, the Utes
have struggled to use this advantage at the
other end of the court, sitting in 11th place
in offensive rebounds.

After a solid string of play during the
winter break, Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer will be hoping that her play
ers can find greater consistency in their
play. The seven-game stretch featured
some great individual performances and a
couple of routs, but at times the Cardinal
struggled and perhaps relied far too heavi
ly on the skills of Nnemkadi Ogwumike to
get it out of tricky situations. While the
conference is only a few games old, both
second-place teams, USC and Washington
State, are locked in rivalry games this
weekend, and a Stanford sweep of the new
Pac-12 schools this weekend could provide
a huge boost to Stanford's dreams of win
ning the inaugural title.

Tip-off between Stanford and Utah at
the Jon M. Huntsman Center in Salt Lake
City is at 6 p.m. tonight.
