## Card welcomes Utes to Maples, Pac-12 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR Jack Blanchat 
Tonight, the Stanford men's basketball
team hosts Utah in its first visit to Maples
Pavilion as a Pac-12 contender. The Cardinal
(13-3, 3-1 Pac-12), playing in its only home
stand in the month of January, has not faced
the Utes (4-11,1-2) since 1997.
Both teams came away with splits last
weekend, with the Utes beating Washington
State in overtime, then losing to Washington,
and the Cardinal falling to Oregon before
picking up an exciting four-overtime win over
Oregon State. However, head coach Johnny
Dawkins hopes that the team and the home

crowd don't dwell on the thrilling victory.
"Everyone is still amazed about the game
and wants to talk about the game and stay in
that moment," he said. "And we need to
move on to our next moment, which is this
weekend, and our opponents that we face
coming up with Utah, so you know we want
to move on."
Utah, who was slated to finish last in the
conference, has already exceeded expecta
tions. The Utes' offense centers on senior
guard Josh Watkins, who led all players with
18 points in the victory over Washington
State, and ranks fourth in the Pac-12 in scor
ing with an average of 15.6 points per game.
He is equally dangerous when creating op

portunities for his teammates, dishing the
second-most assists per game in the confer
ence, with an average of 4.93. Defensively,
junior center Jason Washburn ranks fifth in
the conference in rebounding, with 6.9 per
game, while shooting 58.3 percent from the
field, fourth-best in the conference,
"I think Utah's a good team, they have
potential," Dawkins said. "I think they've
been getting better all season, culminating
with the games you saw this past weekend
versus the Washington schools. They're very
competitive; they're a physical team, and
kind of resembling their coach ... You can
see the guys taking shape and
buying into what they have to do
to win."
The Cardinal, which leads the

conference in total rebounds, will
look to use its advantage on the
glass to nullify Washburn's pro
duction. Stanford will also need to
cut down on fouls and turnovers,
and convert from a higher rate at
the line. Realistically, the Utes
might be one of the weakest con
ference opponents the Card will

face this season, providing an ex
cellent opportunity to correct
early-season errors.
Stanford will tip off against
Utah tonight at Maples Pavilion
at 7 p.m.
