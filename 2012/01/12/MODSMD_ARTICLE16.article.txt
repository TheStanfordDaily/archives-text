# TIGERS ARE EASY PREY
## MEN'S VOLLEYBALL OPENS WITH WIN 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
It didn't take long for the No. 4 men s vol
leyball team to get on track in its season
opening match against the University of the
Pacific. After battling back and forth
throughout the first set, a pair of kills by
sophomore Steven Irvin gave Stanford
some breathing room over the No. 15 Tigers
and the Cardinal didn't look back UOP
didn't breach the 20-point mark again as
Stanford picked up a 3-0 road sweep on
Wednesday night.
The Cardinal (1-0) came into the match
with some momentum from two wins over
visiting Thompson Rivers of Canada over
the weekend, but those came in exhibition
matches, and Pacific posed much bigger
problems with All-MPSF selection Taylor
Hughes.
In the first set, Hughes looked like he
might prove to be a problem for the Cardi
nal defense, notching four kills and a block.
But the Tigers offense went ice cold in the
second set, finishing with just nine kills on 27
swings with four attack errors a .185 hit
ting percentage.
Conversely, Stanford s attack really start
ed to press the net in the second frame. After
hitting .265 in the first set, the Card hit .367
in set two, as sophomore outside hitter Brian
Cook turned in one of the best performanc
es of his young career. The Santa Cruz native
had 13 kills on the night and just two attack
errors, a .478 hitting percentage to go with
his two service aces.
And after pounding Thompson Rivers
defense for 15 kills in the last exhibition
match, sophomore opposite Steven Irvin ex
panded on what has been a solid offseason
with eight kills.

The Stanford men's volleyball team seesawed back and forth
with the Pacific Tigers in the first set on Wednesday, but
blew them away in the last two sets to come out victorious in
the first game of the spring season.
chipping in 11 kills, and senior
libero Erik Shoji himself a
three-time First Team All-Ameri
can with a chance to become the
Cardinal s first ever four-time Ail-
American recording 12 digs, the
rout was on.
Stanford jumped out to a 10-4
lead and didn t look back, finishing
off the set with a kill by sophomore
Denny Falls.
A run of three straight points to
open up the third set allowed the
Cardinal to work through its of
fense without too many problems.
Senior setter Evan Barry spread
the ball around, finishing with 36
assists, as Stanford pushed its lead
to 20-12 late in the third.
Although a late three-point run

by the Tigers reenergized the scat
tering of fans watching the match
at the Alex G. Spanos Center, a
timeout by Stanford coach John
Kosty settled the Cardinal, and a
Cook kill ended the night with 25-
19 set.
With four returners from last
year s team that finished No. 7 in
the final national poll, Stanford has
one of the more experienced
teams in the country. But Kosty
chose not to go to the bench much
against Pacific, as only two players
saw action outside of the six
starters.
When the team returns to ac
tion against visiting Juniata at
Maples Pavilion on Friday night,
expect to see more substitutions as
the Cardinal looks to open its of
fense up against the perennial Di
vision 111 title contenders.
