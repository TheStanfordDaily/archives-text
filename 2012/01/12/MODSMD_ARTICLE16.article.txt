# TIGERS ARE EASY PREY
## MEN'S VOLLEYBALL OPENS WITH WIN 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
It didn't take long for the No. 4 men s vol
leyball team to get on track in its season
opening match against the University of the
Pacific. After battling back and forth
throughout the first set, a pair of kills by
sophomore Steven Irvin gave Stanford
some breathing room over the No. 15 Tigers
and the Cardinal didn't look back UOP
didn't breach the 20-point mark again as
Stanford picked up a 3-0 road sweep on
Wednesday night.
The Cardinal (1-0) came into the match
with some momentum from two wins over
visiting Thompson Rivers of Canada over
the weekend, but those came in exhibition
matches, and Pacific posed much bigger
problems with All-MPSF selection Taylor
Hughes.
In the first set, Hughes looked like he
might prove to be a problem for the Cardi
nal defense, notching four kills and a block.
But the Tigers offense went ice cold in the
second set, finishing with just nine kills on 27
swings with four attack errors a .185 hit
ting percentage.
Conversely, Stanford s attack really start
ed to press the net in the second frame. After
hitting .265 in the first set, the Card hit .367
in set two, as sophomore outside hitter Brian
Cook turned in one of the best performanc
es of his young career. The Santa Cruz native
had 13 kills on the night and just two attack
errors, a .478 hitting percentage to go with
his two service aces.
And after pounding Thompson Rivers
defense for 15 kills in the last exhibition
match, sophomore opposite Steven Irvin ex
panded on what has been a solid offseason
with eight kills.
