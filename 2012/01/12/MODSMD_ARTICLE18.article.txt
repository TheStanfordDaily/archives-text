# Kristina Vaculik helps Canadian gymnastics team qualify for 2012 Olympics
## 
### â€” Miles Bennett-Smith 
When freshman gymnast
Kristina Vaculik decided to
take a year off from school to
compete with the Canadian na
tional team, she had one goal in
mind qualify for the
Olympics. On Wednesday, she
did just that, posting her team s
best score on the uneven bars as
Canada was one of four teams
to advance to the London
Games at the Olympic Qualifying
Test Event.
One of seven team members,
Vaculik is a two-time Canadian
all-around champion and won
four titles at the 2010 national
championships.
As a freshman on the Farm
last year, she competed in all
four events and scored at least

9.825 points (out of 10) in each.
Her season-high score came at a
crucial time for the Cardinal,
when she placed third on the
bars at the NCAA Ann Arbor
Regional.

Assuming Vaculik stays
healthy, she will likely be one of
three Olympians on Stanford s
2013 roster sophomore Shona
Morgan and freshman Rebecca
Wing competed at the 2008 Bei
jing Games for Australia and
Great Britain, respectively.
