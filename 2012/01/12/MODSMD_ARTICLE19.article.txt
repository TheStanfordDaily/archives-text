# Shaw already outclasses Harbaugh
## 
### 
You've heard it all year
long: David Shaw is not
Jim Harbaugh. David
Shaw will never be Jim
Harbaugh. David Shaw
can't do what Jim Harbaugh did. But
that's apparently a good thing.
How can this be so? As of today,
Shaw's first-ever recruiting class is
ranked higher than any class that
Harbaugh brought in during his four
years on the Farm.
That's right: with the addition of
running back Barry Sanders, Jr., the
Cardinal's incoming recruiting class
is currently ranked as the No. 15 class
in the entire nation. Harbaugh's re
cruiting classes during his four years
were ranked 50th, 20th, 26th and
22nd.
Now, national signing day isn't
until Feb. 1, so that ranking could still
slide up or down, but the fact remains
the same: Instead of letting Stanford
slide back into mediocrity with a sub
par recruiting class, Shaw has gone
out and gotten the Cardinal its high
est-ranked recruiting class... ever.
(At least since Rivals.com began to
rank recruiting classes in 2002.)
Anybody worth their salt knows
that recruiting rankings are, at best, a
flawed metric mediocre Notre
Dame somehow always brings in a
top-20 recruiting class but every
one also knows that there is no way
to win in college football unless you
can recruit well. Just look at national
champion Alabama the Tide has
n't had a recruiting class outside the
top 10 since 2006, and even then, it
had the No. 11 class in the country. It's
no wonder that it has been to three
BCS bowls in the last four years.
So even though the Cardinal's
2012 recruiting saga isn't complete
yet, what Shaw has done on the re
cruiting trail has been particularly
impressive. Not only has he contin
ued what Harbaugh started, but he's
also already put his own stamp on the
program by pulling together a truly
impressive recruiting class in his first
season as a head coach.
First, he snared commitments
from two high-profile, highly sought
after recruits: running back Barry
Sanders, Jr. and linebacker Noor
Davis.
Sanders,son of NFLlegendßarry
Sanders, spurned Florida State, Ala
bama and Oklahoma State (his fa
ther's alma mater) to come to Stan
ford. JJie Oklahoma City native is
ranked as the No. 1 running back in
the nation.
Similarly, Davis, the number two
linebacker in the country, turned
down offers from Florida, Notre
Dame, Alabama, USC and 22 other
schools to take his talents to Palo
Alto.
To put it in terms any big-game
hunter would understand, these two
players represent big trophies on the
wall of Shaw and the Cardinal
coaching staff, and Sanders' and
Davis' commitments will probably
induce other top prospects who are
still uncommitted to take a second
look at coming to the Farm.
Second, Shaw has put together a
recruiting class that is much deeper
than just two studs the Cardinal's
2012 recruiting class contains nine
four-star recruits. A class that is both
that talented and deep means that
the Cardinal can count on one class
to fill in for departing starters (or sig
nificant contributors) right away.
Considering that Stanford will lose
half of its starters to graduation or
the NFL this year, it's nice to know
that a big group of talented players
can come in and fill those gaps.
Third, Shaw's expert touch on the
recruiting trail is particularly impres
sive considering the competition
that he has to recruit against con
ference rivals Oregon, USC and Cal
are all expected to bring in top-15

classes this year. It goes without say
ing that recruiting is so high-stakes
and so hotly contested because of its
zero-sum nature: if you can bring in
top-tier talent, you are also prevent
ing good players from falling into the
hands of your rivals.
Lastly, the 2012 recruiting class
could get even better over the next
two weeks. Offensive lineman Kyle
Murphy, the number 22 recruit in the
country, has narrowed his choices
down to USC, Florida, Oregon and
Stanford, and defensive end Aziz
Shittu, the nation's 27th best player,
will pick between USC, Cal, UCLA
and Stanford in the coming weeks. If
Shaw is able to get these two guys to
put a Stanford hat on their heads on
Feb. 1, the Cardinal could conceiv
ably finish with a top-10 class (and
prevent their conference rivals from
adding to their already stocked cup
boards).
So while David Shaw will never
be able to match Flarbaugh's testos
terone-fueled quotes, blue-collar at
titude and general disregard for typ
ical gestures of "sportsmanship," that
might be not be such a bad thing
after all, Shaw is the guy who is about
to bring in the highest-ranked re
cruiting class in Stanford history.

baugh's early recruits, but passed up
a career in football to pursue his
passion as an amateur apiarist. For

to bring in the highest-ranked re

You've heard it all year
long: David Shaw is not
Jim Harbaugh. David
Shaw will never be Jim
Harbaugh. David Shaw
can't do what Jim Harbaugh did. But
that's apparently a good thing.
How can this be so? As of today,
Shaw's first-ever recruiting class is
ranked higher than any class that
Harbaugh brought in during his four
years on the Farm.
That's right: with the addition of
running back Barry Sanders, Jr., the
Cardinal's incoming recruiting class
is currently ranked as the No. 15 class
in the entire nation. Harbaugh's re
cruiting classes during his four years
were ranked 50th, 20th, 26th and
22nd.
Now, national signing day isn't
until Feb. 1, so that ranking could still
slide up or down, but the fact remains
the same: Instead of letting Stanford
slide back into mediocrity with a sub
par recruiting class, Shaw has gone
out and gotten the Cardinal its high
est-ranked recruiting class... ever.
(At least since Rivals.com began to
rank recruiting classes in 2002.)
Anybody worth their salt knows
that recruiting rankings are, at best, a
flawed metric mediocre Notre
Dame somehow always brings in a
top-20 recruiting class but every
one also knows that there is no way
to win in college football unless you
can recruit well. Just look at national
champion Alabama the Tide has
n't had a recruiting class outside the
top 10 since 2006, and even then, it
had the No. 11 class in the country. It's
no wonder that it has been to three
BCS bowls in the last four years.
So even though the Cardinal's
2012 recruiting saga isn't complete
yet, what Shaw has done on the re
cruiting trail has been particularly
impressive. Not only has he contin
ued what Harbaugh started, but he's
also already put his own stamp on the
program by pulling together a truly
impressive recruiting class in his first
season as a head coach.
First, he snared commitments
from two high-profile, highly sought
after recruits: running back Barry
Sanders, Jr. and linebacker Noor
Davis.
Sanders,son of NFLlegendßarry
Sanders, spurned Florida State, Ala
bama and Oklahoma State (his fa
ther's alma mater) to come to Stan
ford. JJie Oklahoma City native is
ranked as the No. 1 running back in
the nation.
Similarly, Davis, the number two
linebacker in the country, turned
down offers from Florida, Notre
Dame, Alabama, USC and 22 other
schools to take his talents to Palo
Alto.
To put it in terms any big-game
hunter would understand, these two
players represent big trophies on the
wall of Shaw and the Cardinal
coaching staff, and Sanders' and
Davis' commitments will probably
induce other top prospects who are
still uncommitted to take a second
look at coming to the Farm.
Second, Shaw has put together a
recruiting class that is much deeper
than just two studs the Cardinal's
2012 recruiting class contains nine
four-star recruits. A class that is both
that talented and deep means that
the Cardinal can count on one class
to fill in for departing starters (or sig
nificant contributors) right away.
Considering that Stanford will lose
half of its starters to graduation or
the NFL this year, it's nice to know
that a big group of talented players
can come in and fill those gaps.
Third, Shaw's expert touch on the
recruiting trail is particularly impres
sive considering the competition
that he has to recruit against con
ference rivals Oregon, USC and Cal
are all expected to bring in top-15

classes this year. It goes without say
ing that recruiting is so high-stakes
and so hotly contested because of its
zero-sum nature: if you can bring in
top-tier talent, you are also prevent
ing good players from falling into the
hands of your rivals.
Lastly, the 2012 recruiting class
could get even better over the next
two weeks. Offensive lineman Kyle
Murphy, the number 22 recruit in the
country, has narrowed his choices
down to USC, Florida, Oregon and
Stanford, and defensive end Aziz
Shittu, the nation's 27th best player,
will pick between USC, Cal, UCLA
and Stanford in the coming weeks. If
Shaw is able to get these two guys to
put a Stanford hat on their heads on
Feb. 1, the Cardinal could conceiv
ably finish with a top-10 class (and
prevent their conference rivals from
adding to their already stocked cup
boards).
So while David Shaw will never
be able to match Flarbaugh's testos
terone-fueled quotes, blue-collar at
titude and general disregard for typ
ical gestures of "sportsmanship," that
might be not be such a bad thing
after all, Shaw is the guy who is about
to bring in the highest-ranked re
cruiting class in Stanford history.
