# Shaw already outclasses Harbaugh
## 
### 
You've heard it all year
long: David Shaw is not
Jim Harbaugh. David
Shaw will never be Jim
Harbaugh. David Shaw
can't do what Jim Harbaugh did. But
that's apparently a good thing.
How can this be so? As of today,
Shaw's first-ever recruiting class is
ranked higher than any class that
Harbaugh brought in during his four
years on the Farm.
That's right: with the addition of
running back Barry Sanders, Jr., the
Cardinal's incoming recruiting class
is currently ranked as the No. 15 class
in the entire nation. Harbaugh's re
cruiting classes during his four years
were ranked 50th, 20th, 26th and
22nd.
Now, national signing day isn't
until Feb. 1, so that ranking could still
slide up or down, but the fact remains
the same: Instead of letting Stanford
slide back into mediocrity with a sub
par recruiting class, Shaw has gone
out and gotten the Cardinal its high
est-ranked recruiting class... ever.
(At least since Rivals.com began to
rank recruiting classes in 2002.)
Anybody worth their salt knows
that recruiting rankings are, at best, a
flawed metric mediocre Notre
Dame somehow always brings in a
top-20 recruiting class but every
one also knows that there is no way
to win in college football unless you
can recruit well. Just look at national
champion Alabama the Tide has
n't had a recruiting class outside the
top 10 since 2006, and even then, it
had the No. 11 class in the country. It's
no wonder that it has been to three
BCS bowls in the last four years.
So even though the Cardinal's
2012 recruiting saga isn't complete
yet, what Shaw has done on the re
cruiting trail has been particularly
impressive. Not only has he contin
ued what Harbaugh started, but he's
also already put his own stamp on the
program by pulling together a truly
impressive recruiting class in his first
season as a head coach.
First, he snared commitments
from two high-profile, highly sought
after recruits: running back Barry
Sanders, Jr. and linebacker Noor
Davis.
