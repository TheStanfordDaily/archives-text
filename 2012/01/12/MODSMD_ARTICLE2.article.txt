# Apple archive opens doors for select few

### SANDY HUANG 
A spotlight has recently been directed at
a little-known archive of documents from
Apple, Inc. The collection rests in an undis
closed location, guarded tightly by Stanford
University librarians as part of the special
collections section.
In 1997, Apple donated many of its
founding documents, company records and
prototypes to Stanford University after
Steve Jobs returned to the company. The
collection has remained largely private,
though interest in the archive has risen
since the death of Jobs in October of last
year.
Parts of the collection have recently
been opened to exclusive groups such as
the Associated Press, under the condition
that they not reveal the location. While the
collection is not open to the public, a major
ity of it has been available to Stanford stu
dents for years.
"We welcome students, faculty, any qual
ified researcher to use these materials," said
Leslie Berlin, a project historian at the

Stanford Silicon Valley Archives.
The Apple collection, which occupies
600 feet of shelf space, is considered a valu
able resource for researchers interested in
engineering, marketing or those who wish
to track how such a powerful corporation
came into being.
"I really feel like a documentary record
is as close as you can get to a time machine,"
Berlin said. "Having documents that come
from the very time that a historian would
write about in the future, those are very spe
cial."
The collection has a wide range of docu
ments. One is a detailed interview with Jobs
and his business partner, Steve Wozniak.
This interview reveals the reason Jobs and
Wozniak chose the now-famous Apple
name and logo because Apple would
come before Atari alphabetically in the
phone book.
Other parts of the collection offer a
more personal peek into the culture of
Apple in its early days. For example, a video
called "Bluebusters" spoofs the popular
"Ghostbusters" movie by having company

executives pose as "Bluebusters," who re
place PCs produced by then-rival IBM with
Apple's own Macintoshes.
The only part of the Apple collection
still unavailable to researchers is its hard
ware series. According to the Online
Archive of California, that part of the col
lection will be "closed until it can be fully
arranged and described."
"We do not have a specific date set for
completing processing of the hardware seg
ment of the collection," Berlin said.
With many researchers and historians,
not to mention tech enthusiasts, itching to
get a peek at the display, many are wonder
ing whether Stanford will open up the
archive to the public. Several media organ
izations have speculated that the collection
would attract the attention of thieves, thus
the enhanced security and restrictive ac
cess.
Henry Lowood, curator for History of
Science and Technology Collections at
Stanford, was not available to comment for
this story.
When asked if any of the other holdings

in the Stanford Silicon Valley Archives
could match Apple's collection in terms of
size, Berlin knew of a few.
''ln terms of the Apple collection rela
tive to others in our archives, we have sev
eral comparable collections in terms of re
search value, including Fairchild, Ampex
and Varian Associates," Berlin said, listing
several powerful tech companies founded
in the region. The Silicon Valley Archives
also feature a collection belonging to
Flewlett-Packard.
"I think that all of our collections have
something to offer different researchers,"
Berlin said.
Any researcher can view materials from
the Apple collection in Green Library's
Special Collections Reading Room, located
in the Bing Wing, by requesting them
through a paging process, which can be
completed in person, by email or online and
allows up to a maximum of five items per
day.
