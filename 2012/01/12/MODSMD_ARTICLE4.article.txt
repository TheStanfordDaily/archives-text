## ASSU approves funding for two spring concerts

from the ASSU general fees budget
also goes to the buffer fund at the end
of the year.
The Senate approved the concert
funding measure in a special meeting

during finals week before winter break,

could work on signing artists and con

event would go toward paying back the
ASSU Senate first. Senator Ben Laufer

has reserve funding upwards of
$15,000. Senate Appropriations Chair
