## ASSU approves funding for two spring concerts 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
dipped into a $350,000 buffer fund in
order to fund two upcoming concert
events on campus: BlackFest and a
spring concert sponsored by the Stan
ford Concert Executive Committee
(SCEC).

The buffer fund results from the
ASSU's decision to cover a 10 percent
refund rate by charging each student 10
percent more on the cost of student
fees than will be distributed to qualify
ing student groups. This inflated cost
prevents shortfalls when some students
request refunds of their student fees.

Students are able to request refunds up
until the second week of the quarter.
Many senators expressed surprise
about the existence of the fund, which
they previously did not know existed.
Senators did not offer an explanation
as to why they were not aware of the
fund before.
The ASSU maintains a commitment
to cover a 10 percent refund rate by
charging each student 10 percent more
than will be distributed to qualifying
student groups. Any unspent money
from the ASSU general fees budget
also goes to the buffer fund at the end
of the year.
The Senate approved the concert
funding measure in a special meeting

during finals week before winter break,
hurrying the process so that the groups
could work on signing artists and con
tinuing preparations.
A $40,000 loan was approved to the
Stanford National Association for the
Advancements of Colored People
(NAACP), under the condition that 50
percent of the profits made from the
event would go toward paying back the
ASSU Senate first. Senator Ben Laufer
'l2 pointed out the NAACP currently
has reserve funding upwards of
$15,000. Senate Appropriations Chair
Brianna Pang 'l3 said she finds the
group's reserves justified and should
not be used given that the group's
annual operating budget is
$35,000.
Pang, who is a staff member of
Stanford NAACP and currently
serves as the group's frosh intern
coordinator, sponsored the bill.
BlackFest hopes to use the
money to help sign popular hip
hop artist J. Cole, who recently
was nominated for Best New
Artist at this year's Grammy
Awards.
Another bill also requested
funding to hold a concert in Frost
Amphitheater this year. A bill
authored by Stephen Trusheim
'l3 requested $35,000 to support
a concert organized by the Stan
ford Concert Executive Com
mittee (SCEC), a newly formed
group in conjunction with the
Stanford Concert Network
(SCN).
The bill gives Trusheim, who
is a member of SCEC and also
the executive chair of Student
Groups and Events for the
ASSU, and Emily Pollock 'l3, co
director of SCN, authority to
spend the money how they see
fit.
Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4
fought hard to tie this $35,000
grant specifically to subsidizing
student costs, and was joined by
Laufer in an effort to have spe
cific language in the bill noting
that this money would go toward
subsidizing tickets.
ASSU Executive Michael

Cruz 'l2 and Senator Nate Gar
cia 'l4 both argued that it does
not matter where the money
goes if it is used to support the
concert.The final bill does not in
clude any language about the
money being allocated to stu
dent ticket subsidies. The bill
does mention students would re
ceive at least a 15 percent dis
count off of the face value of the
tickets. The face value for tickets
is still undetermined, making it
difficult to predict how much a
student ticket subsidy would cost
the group or save students.
Many of the senators ex
pressed frustration with
Trusheim, who did not attend the
meeting during finals week of
autumn quarter to discuss the
bill and answer questions. Sena
tor Shawn Dye 'l4, a Stanford
Concert Network (SCN) mem
ber, was also absent from the fi
nals week meeting.
Trusheim and Dye must re
port to the Senate at least once a
quarter to give an update on how
the project develops and how the
money is spent. Organizers of
BlackFest must report at least
once every two weeks.
The BlackFest bill states that
ASSU Financial Manager
Neveen Mahmoud 'll estimated
that the $70,000 dollar withdraw
al would not be a problem for the
ASSU.
"Financially speaking, the
proposal to withdraw roughly
$70,000 does not seem like it will
drastically negatively impact the
buffer fund as is," Mahmoud said.
