## Flu research sparks debate over censorship Board urges journals to withhold publication, cites safety concerns 
### SHELLEY XU 
Researchers successfully created a version of the
HSNI virus, typically only virulent in wild waterfowl,
which could possibly be transmitted to humans.
The National Science Advisory Board for Biose
curity (NSABB) was set up after 9/11 to monitor the
scientific community for bioterrorist threats. This is
the first time the board has recommended authors
not publish parts of an article since its inception in
2004, recommending scientists redact portions of the
article which contain the methodology of how to
replicate the procedure.
"This is about one of the worst things I can imag
ine," said David Relman, Stanford professor of mi
crobiology and member of the U.S. National Science
Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), referring
to a scenario in which a transmissible form of HSNI
avian flu might find its way into the public sphere, a
possibility that recently came closer to reality due to
controversial research by University of Wisconsin-
Madison scientists and, independently, Dutch scien
tists.
"The reality is that if it escaped, and behaved as we
think it might, it could cause a global pandemic unlike
anything anyone has ever seen," said Relman, who
has been a member of the NSABB since its founding.
The concern of the board is that people who want
to inflict harm, or even people who simply want to
push the boundaries of biology without taking prop
er safety measures, could use the research to replicate
the transmissible virus and release it into the public.
On the other hand, many critics say that the rec
ommendation approaches academic censorship and
limits scientific knowledge. Sara Tobin, a senior re
search scholar in Stanford's Program for Genomics,
Ethics and Society, is one such critic.
"We all benefit from more understanding of bio
logical processes and how viruses work, and when
things aren't published, there isn't any way to use the
scientific methods to make sure ... people can build
on that in constructive ways," Tobin said.
Tobin said the portion of the research which the
NSABB recommended to be withheld from publica
tion could help scientists understand how the virus
transmission works, and could be, "extremely useful
in handling flu epidemics."
She acknowledges an inherent
catch-22 of sorts, however, be
cause the research has not been
published, making the benefits
and risks are both unclear.
HSNI is an extremely danger
ous virus, much more dangerous
than the average flu virus.
"The 1918 flu pandemic had a
mortality of 2 percent, and killed
tens to hundreds of millions," said
Douglas Owens, director of the
Center for Health Policy in the
Freeman Spogli Institute at Stan
ford. "This virus kills 50 percent [of
the time]. It's 25 times more fatal
than the 1918 flu."
Relman echoed these com
ments, saying, "[HSNI] is a particu
larly lethal disease. There aren't
very many infectious agents in the
world that have higher fatality
rates than this virus does."
Because of HsNl's dangerous
capabilities, preventing people
from inflicting harm by using the

virus is a major concern.
"Bioterrorism now is a very im
portant national security threat, so
you have to think about this dual
use biology quite differently,"
Owens said. He said he agrees with
the NSABB's actions, and that in
cases like the HSNI case, scientists
should act prudently.
The research used ferrets as a
surrogate for transmitting the dis
ease. Some say that because of this
disparity, there is not sufficient
ground to withhold publication of
the methodology of the study, as it
is not certain that the virus will act
in humans as it does with ferrets.
But as Relman warns,"You would
n't want to take your chances that
it's wrong."
The actions of the NSABB
have also raised concern that there
is no proper mechanism for the sci
entific community and the public
to evaluate biosecurity threats be
fore they become published. Rel
man stated that the NSABB has
recommended to the United States
government the formation of local
committees to help scientists as
they formulate research proposals
to determine the possible danger
of certain experiments.

"We need to find a really sound
system for dealing with all these
kinds of cases, and putting it in
place soon, because we can't have
these one-time solutions," Relman
said.
"There is a lot of work that goes
on now in biology that could be
used for great good or that people
with ill intentions could use to do
harm," Owens said. "This is an
issue that will have to be consid
ered as people move forward."
As of now, the government has
not reformed or changed the sys
tem. I Tobin said she envisions a con
ference in which scientists, the pub
lic and the press can come together
to discuss the various merits and
risks of publication.
"I think that a community is
probably going to be more produc
tive than this small group making
the recommendation," Tobin said.
According to Relman, the
NSABB is moving toward voting
in favor of recommending a volun
tary moratorium on publication of
the latest controversial research to
allow for a "global discussion."

possibility that recently came closer to reality due to
controversial research by University of Wisconsin-
Madison scientists and, independently, Dutch scien
tists.
"The reality is that if it escaped, and behaved as we
think it might, it could cause a global pandemic unlike
anything anyone has ever seen," said Relman, who
has been a member of the NSABB since its founding.
The concern of the board is that people who want
to inflict harm, or even people who simply want to
push the boundaries of biology without taking prop
er safety measures, could use the research to replicate
the transmissible virus and release it into the public.
On the other hand, many critics say that the rec
ommendation approaches academic censorship and
limits scientific knowledge. Sara Tobin, a senior re
search scholar in Stanford's Program for Genomics,
Ethics and Society, is one such critic.
"We all benefit from more understanding of bio
logical processes and how viruses work, and when
things aren't published, there isn't any way to use the
scientific methods to make sure ... people can build
on that in constructive ways," Tobin said.
Tobin said the portion of the research which the
NSABB recommended to be withheld from publica
tion could help scientists understand how the virus
transmission works, and could be, "extremely useful
in handling flu epidemics."
She acknowledges an inherent
catch-22 of sorts, however, be
cause the research has not been
published, making the benefits
and risks are both unclear.
HSNI is an extremely danger
ous virus, much more dangerous
than the average flu virus.
"The 1918 flu pandemic had a
mortality of 2 percent, and killed
tens to hundreds of millions," said
Douglas Owens, director of the
Center for Health Policy in the
Freeman Spogli Institute at Stan
ford. "This virus kills 50 percent [of
the time]. It's 25 times more fatal
than the 1918 flu."
Relman echoed these com
ments, saying, "[HSNI] is a particu
larly lethal disease. There aren't
very many infectious agents in the
world that have higher fatality
rates than this virus does."
Because of HsNl's dangerous
capabilities, preventing people
from inflicting harm by using the

virus is a major concern.
"Bioterrorism now is a very im
portant national security threat, so
you have to think about this dual
use biology quite differently,"
Owens said. He said he agrees with
the NSABB's actions, and that in
cases like the HSNI case, scientists
should act prudently.
The research used ferrets as a
surrogate for transmitting the dis
ease. Some say that because of this
disparity, there is not sufficient
ground to withhold publication of
the methodology of the study, as it
is not certain that the virus will act
in humans as it does with ferrets.
But as Relman warns,"You would
n't want to take your chances that
it's wrong."
The actions of the NSABB
have also raised concern that there
is no proper mechanism for the sci
entific community and the public
to evaluate biosecurity threats be
fore they become published. Rel
man stated that the NSABB has
recommended to the United States
government the formation of local
committees to help scientists as
they formulate research proposals
to determine the possible danger
of certain experiments.

"We need to find a really sound
system for dealing with all these
kinds of cases, and putting it in
place soon, because we can't have
these one-time solutions," Relman
said.
"There is a lot of work that goes
on now in biology that could be
used for great good or that people
with ill intentions could use to do
harm," Owens said. "This is an
issue that will have to be consid
ered as people move forward."
As of now, the government has
not reformed or changed the sys
tem. I Tobin said she envisions a con
ference in which scientists, the pub
lic and the press can come together
to discuss the various merits and
risks of publication.
"I think that a community is
probably going to be more produc
tive than this small group making
the recommendation," Tobin said.
According to Relman, the
NSABB is moving toward voting
in favor of recommending a volun
tary moratorium on publication of
the latest controversial research to
allow for a "global discussion."

Researchers successfully created a version of the
HSNI virus, typically only virulent in wild waterfowl,
which could possibly be transmitted to humans.
The National Science Advisory Board for Biose
curity (NSABB) was set up after 9/11 to monitor the
scientific community for bioterrorist threats. This is
the first time the board has recommended authors
not publish parts of an article since its inception in
2004, recommending scientists redact portions of the
article which contain the methodology of how to
replicate the procedure.
"This is about one of the worst things I can imag
ine," said David Relman, Stanford professor of mi
crobiology and member of the U.S. National Science
Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), referring
to a scenario in which a transmissible form of HSNI
avian flu might find its way into the public sphere, a
possibility that recently came closer to reality due to
controversial research by University of Wisconsin-
Madison scientists and, independently, Dutch scien
tists.
