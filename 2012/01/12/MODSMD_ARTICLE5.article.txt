## Flu research sparks debate over censorship Board urges journals to withhold publication, cites safety concerns 
### SHELLEY XU 
Researchers successfully created a version of the
HSNI virus, typically only virulent in wild waterfowl,
which could possibly be transmitted to humans.
The National Science Advisory Board for Biose
curity (NSABB) was set up after 9/11 to monitor the
scientific community for bioterrorist threats. This is
the first time the board has recommended authors
not publish parts of an article since its inception in
2004, recommending scientists redact portions of the
article which contain the methodology of how to
replicate the procedure.
"This is about one of the worst things I can imag
ine," said David Relman, Stanford professor of mi
crobiology and member of the U.S. National Science
Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), referring
to a scenario in which a transmissible form of HSNI
avian flu might find its way into the public sphere, a
possibility that recently came closer to reality due to
controversial research by University of Wisconsin-
Madison scientists and, independently, Dutch scien
tists.
"The reality is that if it escaped, and behaved as we
think it might, it could cause a global pandemic unlike
anything anyone has ever seen," said Relman, who
has been a member of the NSABB since its founding.
The concern of the board is that people who want
to inflict harm, or even people who simply want to
push the boundaries of biology without taking prop
er safety measures, could use the research to replicate
the transmissible virus and release it into the public.
On the other hand, many critics say that the rec
ommendation approaches academic censorship and
limits scientific knowledge. Sara Tobin, a senior re
search scholar in Stanford's Program for Genomics,
Ethics and Society, is one such critic.
"We all benefit from more understanding of bio
logical processes and how viruses work, and when
things aren't published, there isn't any way to use the
scientific methods to make sure ... people can build
on that in constructive ways," Tobin said.
Tobin said the portion of the research which the
NSABB recommended to be withheld from publica
tion could help scientists understand how the virus
transmission works, and could be, "extremely useful
