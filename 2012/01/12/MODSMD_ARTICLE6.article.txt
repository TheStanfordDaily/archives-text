# NEWS BRIEF
## Ongoing debate over Row chef compensation 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Margaret Rawson 
According to an email update circu
lated by the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC), University adminis
trators have refused to meet SLAC's de
mands regarding holiday bonuses and
paid vacation for Row chefs and kitchen
assistants, known as "hashers."
SLAC stated that its representatives
recently met with University administra
tors, including Associate Vice Provost for
Student Affairs and Dean of Residential
Education Deborah Colder.
Prior to winder break, SLAC circulat
ed a petition demanding the University
"reinstate vacation pay and holiday

bonuses for chefs and hashers in self-ops,
Greek houses, and theme houses at the
same level as the 2010-2011 academic
year; give chefs and hashers full heath
care benefits as during the 2010-2011 ac
ademic year; cover parking permits and
health certification expenses for chefs
and hashers; and leave the kitchens of
self-ops, Greek houses and theme hous
es in control of the students, chefs and
hashers that have created these vibrant
house communities."
SLAC claims 1,400 Stanford commu
nity member signatures on the petition.
[The Daily has yet to verify this number
but estimates, due to some repeat and
anonymous signatures, that the number
is over 1,200.]
In the update email, SLAC ob
jected to a Business Affairs audit of
Row finances and said that Student
Operating Services (SOS), previ
ously the only provider of Row
house kitchen labor, may have
been forced to make cuts after
being forced to compete with out
side bidders.
Citing differing calculations
from both sides of the debate, SLAC
said that ResEd administrators have
agreed to share a budget to clarify
the debate, which is part of a larger
controversy over increasing central
ization of Row house finances.
