## Study finds rise in income segregation 
### JUDITH PELPOLA 
A recent report by Sean F. Reardon and
Kendra Bischoff of Stanford University's Cen
ter for Education Policy Analysis has found a
significant increase in residential income segre
gation in the United States over the last four
decades.
High levels of income inequality may, but do
not necessarily, correlate positively with high
levels of income segregation, according to the
study authors.
"There can be lots of income inequality but
no income segregation," said Reardon, an asso
ciate professor of education.
In 1970, roughly 66 percent of families lived

in mixed-income neighborhoods. This has de
creased to about 44 percent. This shift corre
lates with an increase in families living in neigh
borhoods characterized as either affluent or
poor.
Bischoff cited areas in Silicon Valley, such as
Palo Alto, as places with high home values,
which contribute to income segregation.
Income segregation increased most rapidly
in the last decade. According to Bischoff, there
was an increase in segregation over larger areas
of land as a result of the recent increase in sub
urbanization.

"I was surprised at the sheer increase that
we've seen," Bischoff said.
The recent housing crisis may
have caused an unpredictable
effect on income segregation, ac
cording to Bischoff and Rear
don, especially due to the fact
that both low-income and mid
dle-income families were fore
closed on in recent years.
"The recession and the hous
ing market crisis has been a huge
disruption to the trends in the
relationship between how much
money people make and where
they live," Reardon said.
This trend is troubling ac
cording to both authors, who
said mixed-income neighbor
hoods provide better public
services for society.
"Higher-income areas often
spend more on public services,"
Reardon said. He further noted
a smaller need for such public
services in higher-income neigh
borhoods, showing an inefficient
allocation of resources.
Mixed-income neighbor
hoods therefore provide a
"spillover of public services" ac
cording to Bischoff. Such neigh
borhoods provide more re
sources for low-income children
who would not have access to
such services in isolated, low-in
come neighborhoods.
Reardon also cited mixed-in
come neighborhoods as benefi
cial to the political sphere.
"We worry that increasing
segregation means increasing
political polarization," he said.
Should representatives be more
from mixed-income areas, ac
cording to Reardon, there would
be increasing pressure for repre-

sentatives to work toward a
more common good, rather than
represent the individual interest
of segregated districts.
Furthermore, both authors
claim that increasing income
segregation decreases the
breadth of perspective people
have in regards to the lives of
those with different economic
status.
"We think that having more
contact with people that are dif
ferent from yourself benefits the
ability to make decisions about
social policy and the democratic
process," Bischoff said.
Both Reardon and Bischoff say
that developments that promote
mixed-income housing in partic
ular areas would help reverse
the trend.
"The truth of the matter is
that income segregation is hard
to reverse," Bischoff said, partic
ularly due to its connection to
housing stock, which changes
slowly over time.
Bischoff also stated that
changes in income inequality
would have a variety of social
effects beyond income segrega
tion, and such changes would
most likely be a result of tax
policy.
The study was an extension
of a previous study done by
Bischoff and Reardon about
the connection between income
inequality and income segrega
tion during the period of 1970
to 2000. The research was sup
ported by the US2OIO project
conducted by Brown University
and the Russell Sage Founda
tion. US2OIO, led by John
Fogan, is a research project fo
cusing on recent societal trends
in America.
