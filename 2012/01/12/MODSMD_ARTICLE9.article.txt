## PROFILE I'm on a dragonboat 
### JUSTINE ZHANG 
A boatful of paddles dipped into
the water simultaneously, push
ing the water back and the boat
forward. With every determined
stroke, the boat accelerated, glid
ing onwards despite its heaviness.The power
of the paddlers was surprising for another
reason: this was a practice held the chilly
Sunday morning before finals week. But the
Stanford Dragonboat Team, undaunted,
took up the challenge.
"There's a dragon head on the boat," one
paddler said, when asked about his rationale
for joining the team.
The decor is striking: a standard boat
consists of 10 or 20 paddlers, a steersperson
and a drummer. On race days, with its paint
ed scales, dragon head and dragon tail, the
boat appears to be a mythical beast.
The artistry of dragonboating suggests its
cultural roots. The story goes that a Chinese
poet, Qu Yuan, drowned himself to protest
an impending invasion by another state. To
keep fish and evil spirits away from his body,
the common folk beat drums and splashed
the water with paddles. Dragonboating, so it
is said, then arose as an activity to commem
orate him.
Dragonboating has since transformed
into an international sport. While it is still
relatively obscure in the United States, it is
slowly becoming more popular at the na
tional and collegiate levels. The California
Dragon Boat Association (CDBA) holds
races for colleges like Stanford and Cal.
Coaches Tek Li 'l2 and Mike Liu 'OO said
that they are promoting dragonboating at
Stanford more as a sport than as a religious
event. Liu rowed in the CDBA before join
ing the Stanford team. Li started drag
onboating in high school. Structuring prac
tices around their experience in drag
onboating and Li's experience on a college

wrestling team, the coaches try to maintain a
high degree of involvement. This year, they
tripled the practices held per week, one on
water and two off-water sessions. Along with
improving the team's form, these extra prac
tices "have been really successful in keeping
people involved with the team," Li said.
While picking up the basic paddle stroke
in dragonboating isn't difficult, getting

power out of the stroke
takes a lot longer to mas
ter. The force of the
stroke should ideally
come as a result of rotat
ing one's core, while min
imizing extraneous mo
tions. This principle was
heavily drilled in the
Sunday morning practice
session, where paddlers
were constantly focusing
on "developing their ro
tation," Li said. Li occa
sionally instructed his
team to perform "power
strokes" fast-paced,
extremely forceful
strokes that rapidly pro
pel the boat through the
water. Even seasoned
rowers like Liu were out
of breath after such exer
cises.
Another challenge
for dragonboaters is
mastering the timing of
the stroke. Both coaches
are pushing for a faster
stroke rate, but achieving
that requires that team
members paddle in uni
son. Synchrony is key to
dragonboating.but is one
of the more difficult skills
for a team to achieve.

While the Stanford rowers mostly paddled
in unison, moments of discord between the
oars caused the boats to flounder.
"Strokes should be timed to not go any
faster than anyone can keep up with," Li
said. While managing the pace poses a
challenge, many team members agreed that
the idea of doing something in sync with 19
other people is also a big draw of the sport.
But for most team members, the most ex
citing part of dragonboating is the races.
"It's a chance to really hang out with the
team," one paddler said.
A standard race is 500 meters, and the
team is trying to pare down their current
time of three to four minutes to two minutes.
During practice, Li frequently called for
"mock races." This drill was probably the
most tiring exercise for the team, but despite
this, the challenge was appealing: one pad
dler said he enjoyed races because "every
one paddles as hard as they can."

In the coming quarters, the dragonboat
team hopes to expand their presence on
campus and recruit more members. Li said
the team's distribution of flyers and emails,
along with word-of-mouth, are instrumental
factors in "putting a face to the name 'drag
onboat'" and drawing more people to the
sport. Li hopes to ultimately quadruple the
current number of paddlers. As a result, no
experience or athletic background is a pre
requisite for participation.
"I want to expose a sport; so if someone is
interested, I'll do my best to let them in," Li
said.
The one requirement, Liu added, is "a
willingness to do something new."
"It matches up very well with a typical
Stanford student, who's adept at more than
one dimension," he said.

event. Liu rowed in the CDBA before join
ing the Stanford team. Li started drag
onboating in high school. Structuring prac
tices around their experience in drag
onboating and Li's experience on a college

wrestling team, the coaches try to maintain a
high degree of involvement. This year, they
tripled the practices held per week, one on
water and two off-water sessions. Along with
improving the team's form, these extra prac
tices "have been really successful in keeping
people involved with the team," Li said.
While picking up the basic paddle stroke
in dragonboating isn't difficult, getting

power out of the stroke
takes a lot longer to mas
ter. The force of the
stroke should ideally
come as a result of rotat
ing one's core, while min
imizing extraneous mo
tions. This principle was
heavily drilled in the
Sunday morning practice
session, where paddlers
were constantly focusing
on "developing their ro
tation," Li said. Li occa
sionally instructed his
team to perform "power
strokes" fast-paced,
extremely forceful
strokes that rapidly pro
pel the boat through the
water. Even seasoned
rowers like Liu were out
of breath after such exer
cises.
Another challenge
for dragonboaters is
mastering the timing of
the stroke. Both coaches
are pushing for a faster
stroke rate, but achieving
that requires that team
members paddle in uni
son. Synchrony is key to
dragonboating.but is one
of the more difficult skills
for a team to achieve.

While the Stanford rowers mostly paddled
in unison, moments of discord between the
oars caused the boats to flounder.
"Strokes should be timed to not go any
faster than anyone can keep up with," Li
said. While managing the pace poses a
challenge, many team members agreed that
the idea of doing something in sync with 19
other people is also a big draw of the sport.
But for most team members, the most ex
citing part of dragonboating is the races.
"It's a chance to really hang out with the
team," one paddler said.
A standard race is 500 meters, and the
team is trying to pare down their current
time of three to four minutes to two minutes.
During practice, Li frequently called for
"mock races." This drill was probably the
most tiring exercise for the team, but despite
this, the challenge was appealing: one pad
dler said he enjoyed races because "every
one paddles as hard as they can."

In the coming quarters, the dragonboat
team hopes to expand their presence on
campus and recruit more members. Li said
the team's distribution of flyers and emails,
along with word-of-mouth, are instrumental
factors in "putting a face to the name 'drag
onboat'" and drawing more people to the
sport. Li hopes to ultimately quadruple the
current number of paddlers. As a result, no
experience or athletic background is a pre
requisite for participation.
"I want to expose a sport; so if someone is
interested, I'll do my best to let them in," Li
said.
The one requirement, Liu added, is "a
willingness to do something new."
"It matches up very well with a typical
Stanford student, who's adept at more than
one dimension," he said.

A boatful of paddles dipped into
the water simultaneously, push
ing the water back and the boat
forward. With every determined
stroke, the boat accelerated, glid
ing onwards despite its heaviness.The power
of the paddlers was surprising for another
reason: this was a practice held the chilly
Sunday morning before finals week. But the
Stanford Dragonboat Team, undaunted,
took up the challenge.
"There's a dragon head on the boat," one
paddler said, when asked about his rationale
for joining the team.
The decor is striking: a standard boat
consists of 10 or 20 paddlers, a steersperson
and a drummer. On race days, with its paint
ed scales, dragon head and dragon tail, the
boat appears to be a mythical beast.
The artistry of dragonboating suggests its
cultural roots. The story goes that a Chinese
poet, Qu Yuan, drowned himself to protest
an impending invasion by another state. To
keep fish and evil spirits away from his body,
the common folk beat drums and splashed
the water with paddles. Dragonboating, so it
is said, then arose as an activity to commem
orate him.
Dragonboating has since transformed
into an international sport. While it is still
relatively obscure in the United States, it is
slowly becoming more popular at the na
tional and collegiate levels. The California
Dragon Boat Association (CDBA) holds
races for colleges like Stanford and Cal.
Coaches Tek Li 'l2 and Mike Liu 'OO said
that they are promoting dragonboating at
Stanford more as a sport than as a religious
