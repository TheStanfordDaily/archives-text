According to sutras, sandalwood is the ideal material from
which to create a Buddhist statue, because of its aroma and
ability to sustain detailed carving. However, this standard
created a dilemma for those Buddhist communities outside of
South Asia—most notably those spread across China, Korea,
and Japan—where sandalwood did not grow locally.
Consequently, the concept of "surrogate sandalwood" began
to gain currency in East Asia from the early Bth century
onward, and Buddhist communities began to seek approximations
for sandalwood in their own local environments.
In this talk, Yukio Lippit, Professor of History of Art and
Architecture at Harvard, will introduce the nature of such
insights in the case of Japanese Buddhism from the 7th
through 11th centuries, and thereby explore the dynamic
intersection of religious studies, art history, and ecology.
