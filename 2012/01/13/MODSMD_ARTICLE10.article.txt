## EDITORIAL The
						rise of the "B Corp" 
### 
For students looking at or
ganizations in the "real
world," whether for em
ployment or in order to bring
about an idea they have, the split
between nonprofit corporations
and "traditional," or for-profit,
companies is clear. Nonprofit
must serve a societal need, often
(but not solely) in a charitable,
religious or research capacity.
For-profit corporations can so
licit investors and shareholders,
but generally the law sees their
primary mission as maximizing
shareholder returns. This means
that a for-profit company's so
cial or environmental missions
often become secondary to its
profit-seeking motive. In a "mid
dle ground" between these ex
tremes a new type of corpora
tion is emerging, with California
the latest but surely not the last
state to legally enshrine so
called "B Corp" status.
The B Corp, or benefit corpo
ration, is meant to give firms a
way to prioritize social and/or
environmental goals without
imposing all the restrictions of
nonprofit status. California's
legislation, which is similar to
laws in Maryland, Vermont and
a few other states, requires B
Corps to have a "specific public
benefit," which is generally
taken to mean a social or envi
ronmental mission. They must
also take into account the inter
ests of their workers, their cus
tomers, the community and the
environment in addition to
shareholders, and they must
publish reports on their societal
or environmental impact in ad
dition to financial results. One of
the best-known companies to
have since applied for legal B
Corp status is Patagonia, a
maker of outdoor clothing and
equipment, which has a long his
tory of supporting environmen
tal causes. In fact, although legal
B Corp status is still nascent, the
nonprofit organization B Lab
that developed B Corp certifica
tion and promotes states' adop
tion of benefit corporation sta
tus has certified more than 400
companies as such. The organi
zation sees B Corp status as a

corporate social responsibility
equivalent to the U.S. Green
Building Council's LEED status
for environmentally sustainable
design and aims to support more
transparent standards for com
panies claiming to do good.
Detractors argue that it is
not clear that legal B Corp sta
tus is needed at all. Legal prece
dent suggests that for-profit
corporations must maximize
shareholder value but no laws
actually state that social or en
vironmental missions must
come second. Furthermore,
some argue that part of the B
Lab certification procedure is
cumbersome and does not actu
ally guarantee any real social or
environmental impact on the
part of the firms involved, de
feating its stated purpose. Last
ly, the relative newness of the
legal status means that many
questions remain as to how the
B Corps will actually be treated
in the context of bankruptcy,
layoffs or other socially diffi
cult, but sometimes economi
cally necessary events.
Nevertheless, it would seem
that the development of B Corp
status offers several benefits and
few real compromises for poten
tial, socially conscious entrepre
neurs, including those at Stan
ford. There is no doubt that firms
that want to run themselves as a
business (i.e. not as a nonprofit)
but do see their role as fulfilling
primarily a societal beneficial
function do not currently have
any unique recognition. At worst
then, the B Corp registration of
fers a niche for a few firms to oc
cupy. At best, it allows numerous
firms that are currently con
strained to legally work towards
enriching numerous stakehold
ers rather than solely their
shareholders and encourages
further social entrepreneurship.
It does all this without restricting
the rights of other corporations
or giving B Corps any readily ap
parent unfair advantage. Blur
ring the line a little between the
categorical extremes of for- and
nonprofits with the introduction
of benefit corporation status ap
pears to be a win-win.
