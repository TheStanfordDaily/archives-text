# SEEING GREEN
## Where water comes from 
### Holly Moeller 
During the driest December
in two decades, I snuck off
for a long weekend in
Yosemite National Park. When I
booked the trip, I expected to visit
a winter wonderland, photo
graphing snowflakes pouring
down the face of Half Dome and
icicles dangling from every cabin.
Instead, every single road was
clear, and the only sign of winter
was the frost edging Bridalveil
Fall.
For my travel companion, a
Yosemite rookie, the absence of
snow proved a boon: We drove to
every classic vista and hiked trails
generally closed by that time of
year. But if I was slightly disap
pointed by the lack of seasonal
snowfall, I can only imagine the
dismay of ski resorts across the
American West.
The unseasonably dry weather
has left Tahoe skiers scraping
gravel, Colorado and Utah resorts
facing slim snowpacks and
Yosemite itself still closed to
snowsports. Snow-lovers with re
sources can still get their wintry
kicks in parts of New Mexico and
British Columbia; but in general,
this year's conditions are lamen
table.
Worse, a bad ski season pre
dicts a tough year for water-users
(read: everyone) living in the
American West.
Snowmelt from western
mountain ranges form the head
waters of rivers harnessed to sup
ply agricultural irrigation, drink
ing water and hydroelectric
power. During low-snowfall
years, our frozen mountain reser
voir is diminished, and drought
looms.
Here on the Peninsula, 85 per
cent of our water comes the Hetch
Hetchy Reservoir, perched within
Yosemite National Park and filled

by the dammed Tuolumne River.
This water flows 167 miles down
from the Sierras, across Califor
nia's Central Valley, underneath
San Francisco Bay, to Peninsula
reservoirs like Crystal Springs
(the body of water visible from I
-280 between San Francisco and
Stanford).
The pipelines connecting the
flooded Hetch Hetchy Valley to
our dorm room taps were laid be
tween 1914 and 1934, and cross
three active faults. (The Crystal
Springs Reservoir itself lies in the
valley of the San Andreas Fault.)
So it's no surprise that the San
Francisco Public Utilities Com
mission is currently in the midst of
a decade-long, $4.6 billion project
to reinforce and enhance the
water transport system before the
next "Big One" rattles a fault be
tween here and the Sierras.
History predicts a severe
earthquake along the Hayward
Fault about once every 140 years,
so we're overdue for the next one.
Geologists assign a 30-percent
probability of a major earthquake
within the next 30 years a slip
pery number for a slippery fault.
But in the (likely) event that this
January remains dry, we may dis
cover that the largest threat to our
water security isn't the shaky
ground over which it flows. Per
haps we'll see that the real threat
is drought.
So far, we've gotten half the
normal amount of precipitation,
and the snowpack is 20 percent or
less than normal for this time of
year. It's easy to see that Califor
nia's water supply is in trouble by
glancing at your nearest reservoir.
The bathtub ring dirt and rock
exposed along reservoir edges by
falling water levels of Lake
Don Pedro (also filled by the
Tuolumne River), which we

passed on our drive home from
Yosemite, must have been meters
high. Even Crystal Springs here
on the Peninsula is looking low.
Across California and across
the world we're growing on
borrowed water, outstripping the
ability of our freshwater supply to
replenish itself.
It's a problem exacerbated by
climate change. Not only will pre
cipitation patterns change, poten
tially reducing the absolute
amount of water that rains down
on Californian watersheds, but
warmer temperatures will mean
less snow and more rain. Thus,
rather than accumulating a large
snowpack that melts in spring just
in time to meet agricultural de
mand, we'll have to find ways of
capturing immediate runoff from
winter storms by adding capacity
to existing liquid reservoirs.
Scientists expect the Sierra Ne
vada snowpack to decline by 40
percent by 2050 and by up to 90
percent by 2100, assuming we
keep up our current rates of fossil
fuel use. Since it seems that, short
of running out of those fuels, our
carbon dioxide emissions are un
likely to slow, we'll be dealing with
significant dry-downs within our
own lifetimes.
Time to start practicing.
One week after my visit to
Yosemite, I found myself in an
other National Park: Death Val
ley. Water that flows into Death
Valley doesn't leave: The annual
evaporation rate is 150 inches per
year, and the valley floor is cov
ered by salt deposits up to 5 feet
deep. Our hotel room was plas
tered with warnings about heat
and dehydration, and equipped
with water conservation meas
ures, like a rotating hourglass to
time five-minute showers.
It's amazing how quickly you
learn to soap up (and how grateful
you become for shorter haircuts)
while watching sand trickle
through the glass aperture. It was
a lesson I took home with me: the
perfect New Year's Resolution
shaped by two National Parks,
one at elevation, the other (part
ly) below sea level, linked by
water, or rather, its absence.

Holly encourages you to try out the
five-minute shower and to send
water-saving tips, comments and
critiques to hollyvm@stanford.edu.

and the snowpack is 20 percent or
less than normal for this time of
year. It's easy to see that Califor
nia's water supply is in trouble by
glancing at your nearest reservoir.
The bathtub ring dirt and rock
exposed along reservoir edges by
falling water levels of Lake
Don Pedro (also filled by the
Tuolumne River), which we

passed on our drive home from
Yosemite, must have been meters
high. Even Crystal Springs here
on the Peninsula is looking low.
Across California and across
the world we're growing on
borrowed water, outstripping the
ability of our freshwater supply to
replenish itself.
It's a problem exacerbated by
climate change. Not only will pre
cipitation patterns change, poten
tially reducing the absolute
amount of water that rains down
on Californian watersheds, but
warmer temperatures will mean
less snow and more rain. Thus,
rather than accumulating a large
snowpack that melts in spring just
in time to meet agricultural de
mand, we'll have to find ways of
capturing immediate runoff from
winter storms by adding capacity
to existing liquid reservoirs.
Scientists expect the Sierra Ne
vada snowpack to decline by 40
percent by 2050 and by up to 90
percent by 2100, assuming we
keep up our current rates of fossil
fuel use. Since it seems that, short
of running out of those fuels, our
carbon dioxide emissions are un
likely to slow, we'll be dealing with
significant dry-downs within our
own lifetimes.
Time to start practicing.
One week after my visit to
Yosemite, I found myself in an
other National Park: Death Val
ley. Water that flows into Death
Valley doesn't leave: The annual
evaporation rate is 150 inches per
year, and the valley floor is cov
ered by salt deposits up to 5 feet
deep. Our hotel room was plas
tered with warnings about heat
and dehydration, and equipped
with water conservation meas
ures, like a rotating hourglass to
time five-minute showers.
It's amazing how quickly you
learn to soap up (and how grateful
you become for shorter haircuts)
while watching sand trickle
through the glass aperture. It was
a lesson I took home with me: the
perfect New Year's Resolution
shaped by two National Parks,
one at elevation, the other (part
ly) below sea level, linked by
water, or rather, its absence.

Holly encourages you to try out the
five-minute shower and to send
water-saving tips, comments and
critiques to hollyvm@stanford.edu.

Instead, every
single road was
clear, and the only
sign of winter was
the frost edging
Bridalveil Fall.

During the driest December
in two decades, I snuck off
for a long weekend in
Yosemite National Park. When I
booked the trip, I expected to visit
a winter wonderland, photo
graphing snowflakes pouring
down the face of Half Dome and
icicles dangling from every cabin.
Instead, every single road was
clear, and the only sign of winter
was the frost edging Bridalveil

For my travel companion, a
Yosemite rookie, the absence of
snow proved a boon: We drove to
every classic vista and hiked trails
generally closed by that time of
year. But if I was slightly disap
pointed by the lack of seasonal
snowfall, I can only imagine the
dismay of ski resorts across the
American West.
The unseasonably dry weather
has left Tahoe skiers scraping
gravel, Colorado and Utah resorts
facing slim snowpacks and
Yosemite itself still closed to
snowsports. Snow-lovers with re
sources can still get their wintry
kicks in parts of New Mexico and
British Columbia; but in general,
this year's conditions are lamen
table.
Worse, a bad ski season pre
dicts a tough year for water-users
(read: everyone) living in the
American West.
Snowmelt from western
mountain ranges form the head
waters of rivers harnessed to sup
ply agricultural irrigation, drink
ing water and hydroelectric
power. During low-snowfall
years, our frozen mountain reser
voir is diminished, and drought
looms.
Here on the Peninsula, 85 per
cent of our water comes the Hetch
Hetchy Reservoir, perched within
Yosemite National Park and filled

by the dammed Tuolumne River.
This water flows 167 miles down
from the Sierras, across Califor
nia's Central Valley, underneath
San Francisco Bay, to Peninsula
reservoirs like Crystal Springs
(the body of water visible from I
-280 between San Francisco and
Stanford).
The pipelines connecting the
flooded Hetch Hetchy Valley to
our dorm room taps were laid be
tween 1914 and 1934, and cross
three active faults. (The Crystal
Springs Reservoir itself lies in the
valley of the San Andreas Fault.)
So it's no surprise that the San
Francisco Public Utilities Com
mission is currently in the midst of
a decade-long, $4.6 billion project
to reinforce and enhance the
water transport system before the
next "Big One" rattles a fault be
tween here and the Sierras.
History predicts a severe
earthquake along the Hayward
Fault about once every 140 years,
so we're overdue for the next one.
Geologists assign a 30-percent
probability of a major earthquake
within the next 30 years a slip
pery number for a slippery fault.
But in the (likely) event that this
January remains dry, we may dis
cover that the largest threat to our
water security isn't the shaky
ground over which it flows. Per
haps we'll see that the real threat
is drought.
