# THE 						MIXED MESSAGES OF MODERNISM
## A 						musical double standard

I value free speech. Reading
otherwise-controversial ideas
rarely bothers me, but I strug
gle to read The Atlantic because
its tone is so moralizing. In my
days at school, especially among
those who term themselves "so
cially aware," I have not found
that mindset a common one. In
stead, I have met an army of white
knights, always at the ready to de
scend with righteous anger on
those who say the wrong thing,
and others who are less impas
sioned but share the sentiment.
Attitudes toward speech heav
ily favor the shaming, if not cen
sorship, of certain varieties of
speech. Saying something insensi
tive, whether true and to the point
or not, is universally decried. Of
tentimes, this is a reasonable reac
tion. Most would rather write
something bland, boring and un
informative than offend someone
else even if just by challenging
their beliefs. The consequences
are by no means limited to mere
social shaming. They reach deep
into personal, professional and
public life.
When gaffes of that sort are
made in the public and private
spheres, reactions are harsh and
swift. When words reflecting atti
tudes of unadulterated selfish
ness, a desire for needless excess
or a cavalier attitude towards vio
lence come up in conversation,
people shake their heads in disap
pointment. Many see it as neces
sary that politicians resign after

faux pas that imply wrongheaded
values. A wide array of statements
we term insensitive or coarse is
thought to reflect so strongly on
the character of their speakers
that they are put beyond public
redemption. But consider the
music that will be ringing in bars
and clubs across the country this
Friday night. That we should de
light in lyrics so blatantly wrong
headed when upholding a culture
so sensitive it often oppresses
controversial debate is so ridicu
lous it defies explanation.
At parties and at home, about a
third of the soundtrack of the
budding 'los is comprised of
music whose lyrics not only make
no pretense to being moral, but
actively glorify actions that alarm
even the most apathetic among
us. Which is really strange in this
day and age. Everything is ana
lyzed for undertones of malice
and immorality. What is found
lacking is harshly critiqued. Yet
the role of drugs, violence and in
humane behavior in music has
never been so large as it is today.
Yes, they've always been a part of
our music, but no one would guess
what "Day Tripper" is about (the
immaculately clean Paul McCart
ney is singing about a prostitute).
"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"
is riddled with drug references,
but never do Ringo, John or
George declare their love for
codeine syrup and a host of seri
ous drugs. Never do they give vio
lence and manipulation a clear

endorsement.
What is at the core of this dou
ble standard, that allows the ven
eration of casual immorality and
insensitivity in one realm and not
in every other? I could never pre
tend to know. It does, however,
seem doubly absurd that this
realm of clemency be music
the chosen form of entertain
ment, consolation and informa
tion about the adult world for
teens, tweens and age groups too
young to have a hip moniker.
This is not to say our music
needs to change, and I certainly
do not advocate censorship. I will
continue listening to the same
things I always do. I merely want
to point out how ludicrous it is
that in a world where a police offi
cer's sexist, dumb, but apologized
for sentence at a 10-person public
safety seminar at a law school in
Toronto spurred an international
movement, we not only abide by
but encourage, admire and pro
mote words reflecting much
worse attitudes. We'll pounce on
statements that show the slightest
signs of poor judgment, and do
nothing but bob our heads while
violence and carelessness are ele
vated onto our most prominent
stages. We believe in free speech,
but we also viciously attack that
speech we deem unacceptable;
then why is music exempt from
our scrutiny?
The realization of our own in
consistency forces us to ask ques
tions of the sincerity of our values.

While I know plenty of Stanford
students who won't stomach a sin
gle word out of line, perhaps right
fully so, none of them takes issue
with the music that inundates our
airwaves. Neither do I, really. But
it seems truly absurd that we can
campaign against innumerable
social ills and then give them tacit
sponsorship by popularizing
artists who make it central to their
work. It's not a problem I can
properly address. But it certainly
seems to have some hefty implica
tions about our endorsement of
our values and our beliefs about
the media we let define our cul
ture.

Is Tyler, the Creator not your ideal
music? Let Spencer know at dsnel
son@stanford. edu.

Saying something
insensitive,whether
true and to the point
or not, is universally
decried.
