## NOTHING FOR FREE STANFORD EDGES STRUGGLING UTAH 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Despite a very tough night from the free
throw line Stanford went 5-17 at the char
ity stripe the men's basketball team
staved off a scrappy Utah team to continue
its run of conference success with a 68-65 win
on Thursday night.
The Cardinal (14-3, 4-1 Pac-12) was fa
vored by 23 heading into the contest, but
struggled to contain the Utes' offense, which
came into the game 333 rd in the country av
eraging just 56.9 points per game. Guard
Chris Hine scored a career-high 21 points for
Utah (4-12, 1-3), routinely splitting the de
fense for layups.

On offense, Stanford was an efficient scor
er, shooting 53.8 percent from the field and a
solid 41.2 percent from behind the three
point arc. But the Card had 18 turnovers and
several times gave the ball away by throwing
passes out of bounds or dribbling off its own
feet.
With a rowdy student section providing
plenty of support despite an announced at
tendance of just 4,981, Stanford had sever
al highlight-worthy plays. Redshirt senior
Josh Owens threw down a one-handed
slam off a breakaway in the first half, and
sophomore forwards Dwight Powell and
Josh Huestis both emphatically finished
plays above the rim.
It was Huestis who really put the team on
his back in the second half, scoring all 13 of
his points down the stretch on 6-6 shooting
from the field. The 6-foot-7 forward from
Great Falls, Mont, also chipped in 10 re
bounds in one of the best games of his career.
With the Utes picked to finish 12th by the
media in their first season in the Pac-12 and
already winless on the road so far this season,
Stanford looked to be on its way to a big win
despite some early struggles on offense.

Sophomore forward Josh Huestis had a career-high 13 points and shot 6-6 from the field, leading the Cardinal to a surprisingly close win over new Pac-12 addition Utah.
Utah did not pick up its first
bucket until almost four minutes
into the game, and did not score
again until a layup by Hines at the
9:22 mark in the first half. But the
Cardinal led by only eight at that
point, and two more quick bas
kets by the Utes cut the lead to
three with a little over seven min
utes left in the half.
A 10-point run by Stanford
gave the Card a little breathing
room, but Utah ended the half
with a seven-point response of its
own to tighten things up at the
break.
Play opened up early in the
second half with plenty of points
on both sides. Four consecutive
three-pointers by the Utes saw
them take their first lead of the
game less than three minutes into
the half at 39-37.
A steal and layup by Hines
pushed the lead to 43-39, the
Utes' biggest advantage of the
night. That's when Huestis came
on strong, scoring eight of his
points in the next six minutes.
Stanford pushed its lead back to
seven with a nice run, and a three
pointer by Huestis on the wing
had coach Johnny Dawkins ani
mated on the sideline as the Card
seemed to ice the game with 3:42
to play.
But Utah refused to go away.
Down by 10 with just 43 sec
onds to go, the Utes went on a
seven-point run as Stanford
turned the ball over and missed
two free throws. After a missed
foul shot by Utah's Dijon Fair,
two game-tying three-point at
tempts were off line, giving the
Card a 68-65 victory and moving
it into a tie with Cal for first place
in the crowded Pac-12.

solid 41.2 percent from behind the three
point arc. But the Card had 18 turnovers and
several times gave the ball away by throwing
passes out of bounds or dribbling off its own
feet.
With a rowdy student section providing
plenty of support despite an announced at
tendance of just 4,981, Stanford had sever
al highlight-worthy plays. Redshirt senior
Josh Owens threw down a one-handed
slam off a breakaway in the first half, and
sophomore forwards Dwight Powell and
Josh Huestis both emphatically finished
plays above the rim.
It was Huestis who really put the team on
his back in the second half, scoring all 13 of
his points down the stretch on 6-6 shooting
from the field. The 6-foot-7 forward from
Great Falls, Mont, also chipped in 10 re
bounds in one of the best games of his career.
With the Utes picked to finish 12th by the
media in their first season in the Pac-12 and
already winless on the road so far this season,
Stanford looked to be on its way to a big win
despite some early struggles on offense.

Sophomore forward Josh Huestis had a career-high 13 points and shot 6-6 from the field, leading the Cardinal to a surprisingly close win over new Pac-12 addition Utah.
Utah did not pick up its first
bucket until almost four minutes
into the game, and did not score
again until a layup by Hines at the
9:22 mark in the first half. But the
Cardinal led by only eight at that
point, and two more quick bas
kets by the Utes cut the lead to
three with a little over seven min
utes left in the half.
A 10-point run by Stanford
gave the Card a little breathing
room, but Utah ended the half
with a seven-point response of its
own to tighten things up at the
break.
Play opened up early in the
second half with plenty of points
on both sides. Four consecutive
three-pointers by the Utes saw
them take their first lead of the
game less than three minutes into
the half at 39-37.
A steal and layup by Hines
pushed the lead to 43-39, the
Utes' biggest advantage of the
night. That's when Huestis came
on strong, scoring eight of his
points in the next six minutes.
Stanford pushed its lead back to
seven with a nice run, and a three
pointer by Huestis on the wing
had coach Johnny Dawkins ani
mated on the sideline as the Card
seemed to ice the game with 3:42
to play.
But Utah refused to go away.
Down by 10 with just 43 sec
onds to go, the Utes went on a
seven-point run as Stanford
turned the ball over and missed
two free throws. After a missed
foul shot by Utah's Dijon Fair,
two game-tying three-point at
tempts were off line, giving the
Card a 68-65 victory and moving
it into a tie with Cal for first place
in the crowded Pac-12.

Senior forward Josh Owens had 11 points, including this energetic dunk,
and made one of his two free throws of the night. Stanford struggled from
the line, converting on just five of its 17 free throw opportunities.
