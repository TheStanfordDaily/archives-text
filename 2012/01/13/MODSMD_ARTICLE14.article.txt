## NOTHING FOR FREE STANFORD EDGES STRUGGLING UTAH 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Despite a very tough night from the free
throw line Stanford went 5-17 at the char
ity stripe the men's basketball team
staved off a scrappy Utah team to continue
its run of conference success with a 68-65 win
on Thursday night.
The Cardinal (14-3, 4-1 Pac-12) was fa
vored by 23 heading into the contest, but
struggled to contain the Utes' offense, which
came into the game 333 rd in the country av
eraging just 56.9 points per game. Guard
Chris Hine scored a career-high 21 points for
Utah (4-12, 1-3), routinely splitting the de
fense for layups.

On offense, Stanford was an efficient scor
er, shooting 53.8 percent from the field and a
solid 41.2 percent from behind the three
point arc. But the Card had 18 turnovers and
several times gave the ball away by throwing
passes out of bounds or dribbling off its own
feet.
With a rowdy student section providing
plenty of support despite an announced at
tendance of just 4,981, Stanford had sever
al highlight-worthy plays. Redshirt senior
Josh Owens threw down a one-handed
slam off a breakaway in the first half, and
sophomore forwards Dwight Powell and
Josh Huestis both emphatically finished
plays above the rim.
It was Huestis who really put the team on
his back in the second half, scoring all 13 of
his points down the stretch on 6-6 shooting
from the field. The 6-foot-7 forward from
Great Falls, Mont, also chipped in 10 re
bounds in one of the best games of his career.
With the Utes picked to finish 12th by the
media in their first season in the Pac-12 and
already winless on the road so far this season,
Stanford looked to be on its way to a big win
despite some early struggles on offense.
