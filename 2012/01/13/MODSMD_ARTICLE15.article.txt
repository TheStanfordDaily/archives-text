## New-look Cardinal begins defense of its title 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
With often-intimate connections formed
through the recruiting process and four years
or more of training and competition,
it s rarely easy for coaches to say goodbye to
graduating seniors. When you graduate five
Ail-Americans on the heels of winning the
NCAA championship, like men s gymnastics

coach Thom Gilelmi did this year, it can be
overwhelming.
Faced with that daunting task, the No. 4
Cardinal kicks off its defense of last season s
title tonight when it takes on No. 5 California
on the road in Berkeley, Calif.
The rival Golden Bears regularly prove a
stiff test for Stanford, and last year saw the
Cardinal rebound nicely from a season-open
ing loss to Cal, winning the Big Flipoff and

the last dual-meet of the season to enter the
postseason with plenty of momentum.
But the loss of Ail-Americans Alex
Buscaglia, Josh Dixon, Tim Gentry, Ryan
Lieberman and Abhinav Ramani all of
whom graduated after competing for the
Cardinal in last year s NCAA meet and
Buscaglia s win of an NCAA Individual Title
