## New-look Cardinal begins defense of its title 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
With often-intimate connections formed
through the recruiting process and four years
or more of training and competition,
it s rarely easy for coaches to say goodbye to
graduating seniors. When you graduate five
Ail-Americans on the heels of winning the
NCAA championship, like men s gymnastics

coach Thom Gilelmi did this year, it can be
overwhelming.
Faced with that daunting task, the No. 4
Cardinal kicks off its defense of last season s
title tonight when it takes on No. 5 California
on the road in Berkeley, Calif.
The rival Golden Bears regularly prove a
stiff test for Stanford, and last year saw the
Cardinal rebound nicely from a season-open
ing loss to Cal, winning the Big Flipoff and

the last dual-meet of the season to enter the
postseason with plenty of momentum.
But the loss of Ail-Americans Alex
Buscaglia, Josh Dixon, Tim Gentry, Ryan
Lieberman and Abhinav Ramani all of
whom graduated after competing for the
Cardinal in last year s NCAA meet and
Buscaglia s win of an NCAA Individual Title
on the horizontal bar has left
some questioning Stanford s
depth.
Despite fielding a roster of
only 13 members other teams
like Cal regularly carry up to 20
athletes with 15 allowed to travel
to most competitions Glielmi
has been impressed by the team s
ability to step up its training so far
this offseason.
"We need guys to be ready,
even if they're in the seventh spot
of the lineup in a sport that has six
competitors," he said. "We may
need them to step in and compete.
The need to be ready is inherent in
our sport since guys are getting in
jured all the time. We're going to
be calling on our all-around gym
nasts this year a lot and that really
takes a lot out of them."
One athlete, Glielmi, likely
won t have to worry as much
about in the spotlight is Eddie
Penev. A three-time All-Ameri
can, the junior is one of the team s
best all-around gymnasts and
won an NCAA Individual Title
on the vault as a freshman in 2010.
With All-American Cameron
Foreman looking to improve on
his third-place finish on the paral
lel bars last season and sopho
more Cale Robinson hoping to
bounce back from a knee injury
suffered last year, Stanford still
enters the season ranked among
the nation s best teams.
But with many of this year s
main gymnasts unseasoned in

high-pressure competition
Penev is in fact the only returner
to post an All-Around score last
season in a meet the defending
NCAA champs have plenty to
prove early on.
Glielmi acknowledged the high
expectations his squad faces, but
the two-time College Gymnastics
Association National Coach of
the Year said that he fully expects
to make a deep run in this year s
postseason.
"Our goal is always an NCAA
championship," he said. "Regard
less of how we finish in the dual
meet and regular season, the guys
need to come away from each
competition knowing what they
need to do to improve and be the
best they can be at their events.
We'll be strategic when we use
guys and be ready to go come
postseason."
Against the Bears, who fin
ished fourth at the 2010 NCAA
Championships, it will be impor
tant for Stanford to start strong
and not fall behind early. Cal
boasts two members of the U.S.
senior national team, Donathan
Bailey and Glen Ishino, and had
three members of the team com
pete at either the World Champi
onships or Pan American Games
during the fall.
Coach Tim McNeill s team
also returns four All-Americans.
The Cardinal, which has fin
ished in the top three at the
NCAA Team Championships for
six consecutive seasons, gets its
season underway tonight at Haas
Pavillion at 7:30 p.m.

enters the season ranked among
the nation s best teams.
But with many of this year s
main gymnasts unseasoned in

high-pressure competition
Penev is in fact the only returner
to post an All-Around score last
season in a meet the defending
NCAA champs have plenty to
prove early on.
Glielmi acknowledged the high
expectations his squad faces, but
the two-time College Gymnastics
Association National Coach of
the Year said that he fully expects
to make a deep run in this year s
postseason.
"Our goal is always an NCAA
championship," he said. "Regard
less of how we finish in the dual
meet and regular season, the guys
need to come away from each
competition knowing what they
need to do to improve and be the
best they can be at their events.
We'll be strategic when we use
guys and be ready to go come
postseason."
Against the Bears, who fin
ished fourth at the 2010 NCAA
Championships, it will be impor
tant for Stanford to start strong
and not fall behind early. Cal
boasts two members of the U.S.
senior national team, Donathan
Bailey and Glen Ishino, and had
three members of the team com
pete at either the World Champi
onships or Pan American Games
during the fall.
Coach Tim McNeill s team
also returns four All-Americans.
The Cardinal, which has fin
ished in the top three at the
NCAA Team Championships for
six consecutive seasons, gets its
season underway tonight at Haas
Pavillion at 7:30 p.m.
