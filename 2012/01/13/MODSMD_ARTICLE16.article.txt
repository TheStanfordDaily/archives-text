# STIFLING THE UTES
## CARD OVERCOMES LOW SCORE 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last night the Stanford women's basketball
team extended its unbeaten streak in the Pac
-12, defeating Utah 62-43 in Salt Lake City.
Again the No. 4 Cardinal (14-1,5-0 Pac-12)
started the game slowly, allowing the Utes (8-7,
1-3) to tie the game eight minutes into the con
test, and the score stayed level at 10-10 for al
most three whole minutes. From there, howev
er, the Card noticeably improved, and the half
ended with an 11-point lead. After the break,
an eight-point unanswered run in the first two
minutes of the second period put the game out
of Utah's reach, and it was relatively simple for
Stanford from there on out.

The high points for the Cardinal were the
double-doubles by both Ogwumike sisters,
senior forward Nnemkadi and sophomore for
ward Chiney, as well as a nice night from soph
omore guard Toni Kokenis, who joined them in
double-figure scoring with 13 points. In reply,
redshirt sophomore forward Taryn Wicijowski
also grabbed a double-double for Utah and
redshirt junior guard Iwalani Rodrigues scored
16 points.
Most of the Ogwumikes' rebounds came
defensively, which highlights a good defensive
effort by the Cardinal in general. The low
point, though, came on offense, with both
teams shooting being below par: Utah man-

Sophomore forward Chiney Ogwumike had her sixth double-double of the season against
Utah in a relatively low-production night for the usually powerful Cardinal offense. Stanford's
62 points were just one above a season low, and the squad has been held below 70 points
in two straight games, a cause for concern heading into tomorrow's meeting with Colorado.
aged just 27.8 percent from the
field, and though Stanford was
definitely better with 43.3 percent
it hit just one from 11 three-point
attempts.
The Card will next face Col
orado (13-2, 2-2 Pac-12) at the
Coors Event Center in Boulder
tomorrow afternoon. The Buf
faloes are recovering from a col
lapse against California last night
that cost them a chance to enter a
tie for second place in the confer
ence. Colorado had a 12-point lead
with just over 12 minutes left in the
game, but would only score four
more points in the contest as the
Golden Bears surged back to win
68-55.
The Lady Buffs should still be a
tricky proposition for Stanford,
however, with the best overall
record of any team except the
Card in the Pac-12. When the two
last met, albeit in March 2002, the
Buffaloes recorded a narrow 62-

59 home win. If the altitude of Salt
Lake City played any part in Stan
ford's shooting struggles in Utah,
that too will provide additional
home advantage to Colorado as
Boulder sits over a thousand feet
higher at 5,430 ft.
The player Stanford may need
to be most wary of is junior guard
Chucky Jeffrey, who grabbed 21
points against the Golden Bears
and with 17.2 points per game,
ranks near the top of the Pac-12's
scoring table, Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike, though, sits atop that list
and exemplifies the difference
between the two schools. Stan
ford's top scorers are forwards
who stand well over six-feet tall,
while Colorado's are guards sev
eral inches shorter. If the Cardi
nal can defend as well as it did
against Utah, it will be in the ideal
position to put this height advan
tage to good use against Col
orado.
The contest between Stanford
and Colorado will start at 3 p.m.
PT in Boulder.
