# STIFLING THE UTES
## CARD OVERCOMES LOW SCORE 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last night the Stanford women's basketball
team extended its unbeaten streak in the Pac
-12, defeating Utah 62-43 in Salt Lake City.
Again the No. 4 Cardinal (14-1,5-0 Pac-12)
started the game slowly, allowing the Utes (8-7,
1-3) to tie the game eight minutes into the con

most three whole minutes. From there, howev

ended with an 11-point lead. After the break,

Stanford from there on out.

The high points for the Cardinal were the
double-doubles by both Ogwumike sisters,
senior forward Nnemkadi and sophomore for
ward Chiney, as well as a nice night from soph
omore guard Toni Kokenis, who joined them in
double-figure scoring with 13 points. In reply,
redshirt sophomore forward Taryn Wicijowski
also grabbed a double-double for Utah and
redshirt junior guard Iwalani Rodrigues scored
16 points.
Most of the Ogwumikes' rebounds came
defensively, which highlights a good defensive
effort by the Cardinal in general. The low
point, though, came on offense, with both
teams shooting being below par: Utah man-

Sophomore forward Chiney Ogwumike had her sixth double-double of the season against
Utah in a relatively low-production night for the usually powerful Cardinal offense. Stanford's
62 points were just one above a season low, and the squad has been held below 70 points
in two straight games, a cause for concern heading into tomorrow's meeting with Colorado.
