# MLB about to get way too 'wild'
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
With bowl season
less than a week
behind us, every
one s minds are
on altering col
lege football s postseason format
for the first time since 1998, when
the BCS was established. But in an
attempt to provide some distrac
tion from the disappointment of
Stanford s close Fiesta Bowl loss,
I m going to focus on another
league making similar changes in
the near future: the MLB.
Under the new collective bar
gaining agreement signed last No
vember, the MLB postseason will
feature two more wild-card teams,
one each from the National and
American leagues, which will par
ticipate in a one-game playoff with
their league s other wild-card club
starting in either 2012 or 2013. It s
the first major change to the base
ball postseason since the division
series was added in, yes, the late
O9os, and it further parallels the
plus-one model that has become
popular among NCAA football
pundits because it increases al
beit just slightly the number of
teams with the potential of win
ning a title at season s end.
Single-game playoffs are
hardly new to baseball; as
tiebreakers they can mark a nail
biter of an ending to the regular
season. And in four of the past
five years, at least one of the two
wild-card races have come down
to a single game, so it s not like
the second wild-card bid is en
tirely unmerited.
That said, adding a second
wild-card team only takes away
from the September chaos at the
tail end of the MLB season, a 162-
game marathon that exhausts
even the most dedicated of fans
and, just like the three-hour game
itself, turns off a good chunk of our
generation with its slow pace. Re
member last September, when
late-inning heroics at three sepa
rate venues jettisoned the Rays
and Cardinals into the postseason
above the Braves and Red Sox?
With a second wild-card bid, not
only would all four teams have
made it to the playoffs; they likely
would have clinched a berth days
in advance. Taking away from that
final-day-of-the-season excite
ment is a serious mistake, and with
the lack of parity in today s MLB,
you shouldn t expect nearly as
many down-to-the-wire races
after the second wild-card team is
added.
What s more, there s a serious
wear-and-tear factor at hand for
the players here. One game might
not seem like much, but the travel
and exhaustion accumulate quick
ly. Go back to 1997, when the
Dodgers and Mets finished tied
for second in the NL wild-card
standings behind the Marlins. The
Mets lost the season series with
the Dodgers 6-5, so the tiebreak
would have been played in LA. If
the Mets won, they would then
have to travel back to Miami for
the wild-card showdown, soon fol
lowed by a best-of-five series be
ginning in Atlanta. By the time
New York had its first home game,
it would have traveled over 8,500
miles and played in three cities.
Knowing how the MLB likes to
push up its postseason schedule,
the Mets probably would ve had
to do it all in less than a week. And
they wouldn t even be out of the
first round yet.
Just as frightening, what if
there s a three-way tie for the wild
card, which nearly happened be
tween the Rockies, Padres in Mets
in 2007? Or if one of the wild-card
teams is tied for a division lead as
well? Point is, one-game tiebreaks
can build up in a hurry, and by the
time we have a single wild-card
representative, the three division
leaders will be well rested from all
the time they had spent twiddling
their thumbs. If anything, this sys
tem could make it harder for a
wild-card club to make a run deep
into the playoffs.
Baseball is supposed to be a
simple, approachable game; pick
up a bat, throw a ball and you re
well on your way. We ve already
had Shoeless Joe Jackson s
thrown World Series, the DH rule,
Pete Roses gambling, the Pitts
burgh Pirates cocaine use, George
Brett s pine tar, the addition of in
terleague play, Sammy Sosa s
corked bat, Bill James sabermet
rics, steroid allegations against
practically everyone, instant re
play for home runs and Armando
Galarraga s umpire-revoked per
fect game (in that order) con

found that legacy.
Add two more wild-card teams
to the list.

Joseph Bey da is a baseball purist at
heart, but likes to bring a little
sabermetrics into the newsroom
with plenty of pie charts and
spreadsheets. Let him who will be

in advance. Taking away from that
final-day-of-the-season excite
ment is a serious mistake, and with
the lack of parity in today s MLB,
you shouldn t expect nearly as
many down-to-the-wire races
after the second wild-card team is
added.
What s more, there s a serious
wear-and-tear factor at hand for
the players here. One game might
not seem like much, but the travel
and exhaustion accumulate quick
ly. Go back to 1997, when the
Dodgers and Mets finished tied
for second in the NL wild-card
standings behind the Marlins. The
Mets lost the season series with
the Dodgers 6-5, so the tiebreak
would have been played in LA. If
the Mets won, they would then
have to travel back to Miami for
the wild-card showdown, soon fol
lowed by a best-of-five series be
ginning in Atlanta. By the time
New York had its first home game,
it would have traveled over 8,500
miles and played in three cities.
Knowing how the MLB likes to
push up its postseason schedule,
the Mets probably would ve had
to do it all in less than a week. And
they wouldn t even be out of the
first round yet.
Just as frightening, what if
there s a three-way tie for the wild
card, which nearly happened be
tween the Rockies, Padres in Mets
in 2007? Or if one of the wild-card
teams is tied for a division lead as
well? Point is, one-game tiebreaks
can build up in a hurry, and by the
time we have a single wild-card
representative, the three division
leaders will be well rested from all
the time they had spent twiddling
their thumbs. If anything, this sys
tem could make it harder for a
wild-card club to make a run deep
into the playoffs.
Baseball is supposed to be a
simple, approachable game; pick
up a bat, throw a ball and you re
well on your way. We ve already
had Shoeless Joe Jackson s
thrown World Series, the DH rule,
Pete Roses gambling, the Pitts

corked bat, Bill James sabermet
rics, steroid allegations against

Add two more wild-card teams
to the list.

With bowl season
less than a week
behind us, every
one s minds are
on altering col
lege football s postseason format
for the first time since 1998, when
the BCS was established. But in an
attempt to provide some distrac
tion from the disappointment of
Stanford s close Fiesta Bowl loss,
I m going to focus on another
league making similar changes in
the near future: the MLB.
Under the new collective bar
gaining agreement signed last No
vember, the MLB postseason will
feature two more wild-card teams,
one each from the National and
American leagues, which will par
ticipate in a one-game playoff with
their league s other wild-card club
starting in either 2012 or 2013. It s
the first major change to the base
ball postseason since the division
series was added in, yes, the late
O9os, and it further parallels the
plus-one model that has become
popular among NCAA football
pundits because it increases al
beit just slightly the number of
teams with the potential of win
ning a title at season s end.
Single-game playoffs are
hardly new to baseball; as
tiebreakers they can mark a nail
biter of an ending to the regular
season. And in four of the past
five years, at least one of the two
wild-card races have come down
to a single game, so it s not like
the second wild-card bid is en
tirely unmerited.
That said, adding a second
wild-card team only takes away
from the September chaos at the
tail end of the MLB season, a 162-
game marathon that exhausts
even the most dedicated of fans
and, just like the three-hour game
itself, turns off a good chunk of our
generation with its slow pace. Re
member last September, when
late-inning heroics at three sepa
rate venues jettisoned the Rays
and Cardinals into the postseason
above the Braves and Red Sox?
With a second wild-card bid, not
only would all four teams have
made it to the playoffs; they likely
would have clinched a berth days
in advance. Taking away from that
final-day-of-the-season excite
ment is a serious mistake, and with
the lack of parity in today s MLB,
you shouldn t expect nearly as
many down-to-the-wire races
after the second wild-card team is
added.
