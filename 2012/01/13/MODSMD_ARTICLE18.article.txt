## Squad faces Cal Poly in conference clash 
### PALANI ESWARAN STAFF WRITER 
This Sunday the Stanford
wrestling team heads to San Luis
Obispo to take on a Pac-12 foe,
the Cal Poly Mustangs.
The Cardinal (5-5,1-1 Pac-12)
and the Mustangs (3-2, 2-1) have
been to the same tournaments
this year the Vegas Invitation
al, the Reno Tournament of
Champions, and the Midlands
Tournament. In the two earlier
tournaments, Vegas and Reno,
Cal Poly finished higher than
Stanford.
But since then Stanford has
wrestled much better. At the Mid
lands Tournament Stanford fin
ished 25th, eight spots better than
Cal Poly.
The Cardinal and the Mus
tangs have wrestled three teams
in common so far this season, and
both are 2-1. Both teams dominat
ed Cal State Bakersfield and won
close meets against Boise State.
But against American, Stanford
almost pulled out a win while Cal
Poly lost by double digits.
Tlie main event of Sunday s dual
will be the match between Stan
ford s No. 1 Nick Amuchastegui
(13-0) and Cal Poly s No. 4 Ryan
Desßoches (19-0). Desßoches, a
two-time NCAA Tournament
qualifier who has twice finished
third in the Pac-12 Tournament, has
already won three tournaments this
year. Amuchastegui has won the
Pac-12 Tournament and finished
second on two occasions, including
last year.
This match will undoubtedly
be the toughest test so far for both
Amuchastegui and Desßoches.
There is a lot at stake because the
winner of this match will likely
have the No. 1 seed at the Pac-12
tournament and a top-three seed
at the NCAA Tournament.
Stanford s other ranked

wrestler, No. 7 Ryan Mango at 133
pounds, looks to improve upon his
19-5 record and keep his 10-0 per
fect.
The Mustangs have two
ranked wrestlers other than
Desßoches No. 2 Boris No
vachkov at 141 pounds and No. 16
Ryan Smith at 197 pounds. No
vachkov has had an extremely
successful career at Cal Poly, win
ning two tournaments this season
and finishing fifth at another. He
has lost just two matches this year,
has won the Pac-12 Tournament
twice and last season finished sec
ond at the NCAA Tournament.
Smith recently defeated the
No. 14 197-pounder in the coun
try, Danny Mitchell of American.
Smith will be a tough match for
Alan Yen, Stanford s starter at 197
pounds.
This match is crucial in deter
mining momentum for the re
mainder of the rest of the season
for the Cardinal. Although the
squad is wrestling very well
maybe the best it has all year it
is coming off of a loss. A win this
weekend would greatly boost the
team s confidence and would be a
great reward for the team s hard
work and improvement, while in
dividual wins are also very impor
tant for seeding in the Pac-12
Tournament.
The key to the dual will be the
Cardinal wrestlers ability to put
multiple moves together. Against
Boise State and American, they
were able to execute one move
after another, reshooting after an
opponents attack and going for
pinning combinations after gain
ing control. The Cardinal has the
ability and the talent to win this
Sunday, and it is crucial that it
takes care of business against its
Pac-12 opponent.
