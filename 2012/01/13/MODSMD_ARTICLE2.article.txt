## FTC seeks to rein in Facebook Commissioner Brill speaks about privacy concerns at Law School 
### JOSH HOYT STAFF WRITER 
Public fear over online priva
cy has been ramping up, and for
Julie Brill, a commissioner at the
Federal Trade Commission, the
increased attention is warranted.
In an informal talk at the Stan
ford Law School, Commissioner
Brill said the FTC is focusing in
creasing attention on the privacy
policies of cyber companies from
Facebook to the latest smart
phone applications.
"We have been really active
over the past year or so in terms
of enforcement and probably the
matter that... in many ways
could be considered the most im
portant is the Facebook settle
ment," Brill said. "I think Face
book, and to a certain extent the
Google proposed settlement, are
significant because for the first
time we are calling on companies
... by order from us, to institute a
comprehensive privacy pro
gram."
The FTC has taken actions
against Facebook, Google and
Twitter and has proposed settle
ments for all three. The major
components of the settlements
with Facebook and Google in
clude: "having in place personnel
who are primarily responsible for
privacy" and "having in place
governance structures through
out the corporate entity that are
thinking about privacy," Brill
said. "We also put in place audit
ing requirements ... that last for
20 years."

In the case of Facebook, Brill
also mentioned that the FTC is
specifically concerned with the
transparency and clarity of their
privacy rules.
"Just simply having some
thing down somewhere in a
very complicated document, we
have taken the position that. . .
it will not absolve a company of
potential problems if con
sumers wouldn't have expected
to find that very salient infor
mation in the place where the
company put it. That was one
issue that came up in the Face
book matter."
Facebook is accused of de
ceiving "consumers by telling
them they could keep their infor
mation on Facebook private, and
then repeatedly allowing it to be
shared and made public," accord

ing to an FTC press release. Of
the three major Silicon Valley
companies to face action from
the FTC, the action against Face
book contained the most numer
ous and diverse complaints. The
complaints range from changing
the company's privacy policies
without notifying consumers, to
several instances of misrepre
senting such policies.
For example, the FTC com
plaint claims that, "in many in
stances, Facebook has shared in
formation about users with plat
form advertisers by identifying to
them the users who clicked on
their ads, despite stating explicit
ly that Facebook never shares
data. After relaxing privacy poli
cies in Dec. 2009, "platform ad
