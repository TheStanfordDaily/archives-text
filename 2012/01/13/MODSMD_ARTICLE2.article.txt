## FTC seeks to rein in Facebook Commissioner Brill speaks about privacy concerns at Law School 
### JOSH HOYT STAFF WRITER 
Public fear over online priva
cy has been ramping up, and for
Julie Brill, a commissioner at the
Federal Trade Commission, the
increased attention is warranted.
In an informal talk at the Stan
ford Law School, Commissioner
Brill said the FTC is focusing in
creasing attention on the privacy
policies of cyber companies from
Facebook to the latest smart
phone applications.
"We have been really active
over the past year or so in terms
of enforcement and probably the
matter that... in many ways
could be considered the most im
portant is the Facebook settle
ment," Brill said. "I think Face
book, and to a certain extent the
Google proposed settlement, are
significant because for the first
time we are calling on companies
... by order from us, to institute a
comprehensive privacy pro
gram."
The FTC has taken actions
against Facebook, Google and
Twitter and has proposed settle
ments for all three. The major
components of the settlements
with Facebook and Google in
clude: "having in place personnel
who are primarily responsible for
privacy" and "having in place
governance structures through
out the corporate entity that are
thinking about privacy," Brill
said. "We also put in place audit
ing requirements ... that last for
20 years."

In the case of Facebook, Brill
also mentioned that the FTC is
specifically concerned with the
transparency and clarity of their
privacy rules.
"Just simply having some
thing down somewhere in a
very complicated document, we
have taken the position that. . .
it will not absolve a company of
potential problems if con
sumers wouldn't have expected
to find that very salient infor
mation in the place where the
company put it. That was one
issue that came up in the Face
book matter."
Facebook is accused of de
ceiving "consumers by telling
them they could keep their infor
mation on Facebook private, and
then repeatedly allowing it to be
shared and made public," accord

ing to an FTC press release. Of
the three major Silicon Valley
companies to face action from
the FTC, the action against Face
book contained the most numer
ous and diverse complaints. The
complaints range from changing
the company's privacy policies
without notifying consumers, to
several instances of misrepre
senting such policies.
For example, the FTC com
plaint claims that, "in many in
stances, Facebook has shared in
formation about users with plat
form advertisers by identifying to
them the users who clicked on
their ads, despite stating explicit
ly that Facebook never shares
data. After relaxing privacy poli
cies in Dec. 2009, "platform ad

vertisers potentially could take
steps to get detailed information
about individual users, including
profile picture, gender, current
city, friend list, pages and net
works."
In 2011, Google and the FTC
finalized an agreement stemming
from an FTC case brought in
2010. The Google case was over
the well-publicized Google Buzz
fiasco, in which Google tried to
create a social network based
around users' Gmail accounts.
According to the FTC website,
"the options for declining or leav
ing the social network were inef
fective"; and "for users who
joined the Buzz network, the con
trols for limiting the sharing of
their personal information were
confusing and difficult to find."
The FTC case against Twitter
focused on data security, not pri
vacy practices, and alleged that
Twitter had not taken thorough
enough security measures in 2009
when it was hacked twice.
In all three actions, the FTC
has brought what is called an "ad
ministrative complaint," which is
not a formal charge of violating
the law. The companies do not
admit to breaking the law when
they finalize their settlement
agreements with the FTC, and the
finalized agreements do not come
with a penalty, although they do
provide for future penalties if the
agreement is broken.
Beyond bringing individual
actions, last year the FTC created
a proposal suggesting unique
standards and practices to ad
dress privacy concerns online.
"We probably most famously
sent out a call for industry, as well
as policy makers, to consider de
veloping 'do not track' features,"
Brill said. "It is one mechanism to

give users simplified notice and
simplified choice about some of
the ways that data is being collect
ed and used online."
The FTC proposal further sug
gests creating more strict disclo
sure rules for "third party" com
panies that collect data without
direct interaction with the cus
tomer. The thinking is that a cus
tomer dealing directly with a ven
dor is aware that Amazon, for ex
ample, will have access to their
personal data, but should be
clearly notified if that data is col
lected by a third party as well.
Brill said she expects the propos
al to be finalized in the coming
months, but for now it is open for
comments.
The FTC has traditionally fo
cused on data security, but when
asked about last year's discovery
that patient information from
Stanford Hospital, including
names and diagnosis codes, was
online for over a year, Commis
sioner Brill said it would not be
the FTC that would handle the
case. Instead, Health and Human
Services will be taking action.
Brill did offer empathy for
consumers over data security in
general.
The consumer "has to trust
that the company is engaging in
good data security practices and
when that falls down ... the con
sumer is left on the sideline; but
its their data."
"That is one of the reasons
that we focused for a long time on
data security, and it is only more
recently that we have moved
more broadly into privacy," she
added.
The event was hosted by the
Stanford Center for Internet and
Society and was put on as a part of
Data Privacy Day, an effort to
raise awareness about privacy.
The official Data Privacy Day is
Jan. 28.

The FTC has taken actions
against Facebook, Google and
Twitter and has proposed settle
ments for all three. The major
components of the settlements
with Facebook and Google in
clude: "having in place personnel
who are primarily responsible for
privacy" and "having in place
governance structures through
out the corporate entity that are
thinking about privacy," Brill
said. "We also put in place audit
ing requirements ... that last for
20 years."

In the case of Facebook, Brill
also mentioned that the FTC is
specifically concerned with the
transparency and clarity of their
privacy rules.
"Just simply having some
thing down somewhere in a
very complicated document, we
have taken the position that. . .
it will not absolve a company of
potential problems if con
sumers wouldn't have expected
to find that very salient infor
mation in the place where the
company put it. That was one
issue that came up in the Face
book matter."
Facebook is accused of de
ceiving "consumers by telling
them they could keep their infor
mation on Facebook private, and
then repeatedly allowing it to be
shared and made public," accord

ing to an FTC press release. Of
the three major Silicon Valley
companies to face action from
the FTC, the action against Face
book contained the most numer
ous and diverse complaints. The
complaints range from changing
the company's privacy policies
without notifying consumers, to
several instances of misrepre
senting such policies.
For example, the FTC com
plaint claims that, "in many in
stances, Facebook has shared in
formation about users with plat
form advertisers by identifying to
them the users who clicked on
their ads, despite stating explicit
ly that Facebook never shares
data. After relaxing privacy poli
cies in Dec. 2009, "platform ad

vertisers potentially could take
steps to get detailed information
about individual users, including
profile picture, gender, current
city, friend list, pages and net
works."
In 2011, Google and the FTC
finalized an agreement stemming
from an FTC case brought in
2010. The Google case was over
the well-publicized Google Buzz
fiasco, in which Google tried to
create a social network based
around users' Gmail accounts.
According to the FTC website,
"the options for declining or leav
ing the social network were inef
fective"; and "for users who
joined the Buzz network, the con
trols for limiting the sharing of
their personal information were
confusing and difficult to find."
The FTC case against Twitter
focused on data security, not pri
vacy practices, and alleged that
Twitter had not taken thorough
enough security measures in 2009
when it was hacked twice.
In all three actions, the FTC
has brought what is called an "ad
ministrative complaint," which is
not a formal charge of violating
the law. The companies do not
admit to breaking the law when
they finalize their settlement
agreements with the FTC, and the
finalized agreements do not come
with a penalty, although they do
provide for future penalties if the
agreement is broken.
Beyond bringing individual
actions, last year the FTC created
a proposal suggesting unique
standards and practices to ad
dress privacy concerns online.
"We probably most famously
sent out a call for industry, as well
as policy makers, to consider de
veloping 'do not track' features,"
Brill said. "It is one mechanism to

give users simplified notice and
simplified choice about some of
the ways that data is being collect
ed and used online."
The FTC proposal further sug
gests creating more strict disclo
sure rules for "third party" com
panies that collect data without
direct interaction with the cus
tomer. The thinking is that a cus
tomer dealing directly with a ven
dor is aware that Amazon, for ex
ample, will have access to their
personal data, but should be
clearly notified if that data is col
lected by a third party as well.
Brill said she expects the propos
al to be finalized in the coming
months, but for now it is open for
comments.
The FTC has traditionally fo
cused on data security, but when
asked about last year's discovery
that patient information from
Stanford Hospital, including
names and diagnosis codes, was
online for over a year, Commis
sioner Brill said it would not be
the FTC that would handle the
case. Instead, Health and Human
Services will be taking action.
Brill did offer empathy for
consumers over data security in
general.
The consumer "has to trust
that the company is engaging in
good data security practices and
when that falls down ... the con
sumer is left on the sideline; but
its their data."
"That is one of the reasons
that we focused for a long time on
data security, and it is only more
recently that we have moved
more broadly into privacy," she
added.
The event was hosted by the
Stanford Center for Internet and
Society and was put on as a part of
Data Privacy Day, an effort to
raise awareness about privacy.
The official Data Privacy Day is
Jan. 28.

Public fear over online priva

Julie Brill, a commissioner at the
Federal Trade Commission, the
increased attention is warranted.
In an informal talk at the Stan

Brill said the FTC is focusing in

of enforcement and probably the
matter that... in many ways
could be considered the most im

comprehensive privacy pro
