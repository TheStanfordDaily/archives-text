## Research looks to small farms in Africa 
### LUCY MUSSON 
Smallholder farms may hold the answer to issues of
hunger and poverty in Africa, according to Thorn Jayne,
professor of international development from Michigan
State University, who presented his research Thursday
evening as part of the Global Food Policy and Food Se
curity Symposium Series.
"The ironic thing is that Africa, which is the most food
insecure and impoverished continent in the world, also
has the greatest supply of unutilized arable land in the
world," Jayne said.
Despite the perception of Africa as a land-rich conti
nent, studies of where the people live reveal a different
situation, Jayne added.
"Much of rural Sub-Sahara Africa is sparsely popu
lated, but a high proportion of the rural people in the con
tinent do live in densely populated areas,'' Jayne said, ref

erencing population histograms.
Jayne used Zambia, the country in which he current
ly runs a policy program, to illustrate the negative effects
of living at the population threshold. Sixty-seven percent
of Zambia's population is not selling maize or other
crops due to their lack of access to land. Jayne argued this
leads to urbanization problems.
"Some of the problems of urban slums... are linked
in some respect to the problem of inability to earn a liveli
hood," Jayne said, highlighting the farmers in the bottom
tier who do not produce maize,
Javne used evidence from maize fanning in Zambia
to illustrate that agricultural growth does not necessarily
lead to poverty reduction. Following a maize subsidy in
the mid-2000s, maize production in Zambia doubled, but
rural poverty remained at 78 percent.
"How can you have that kind of
growth and not have any impact on
poverty reduction?" Jayne asked.
According to Jayne, the answer
lies in the size of farms. Maize pro
duction increased dramatically on
large farms of 10 to 20 hectares.
Forty-one percent of households,
however, live on farms of less than
one hectare. Jayne argued that solu
tions to poverty therefore must be
based in smallholder farms, especial
ly since individuals with political
connections typically control the
large farms.
"There are elements of this story
that are similar to what's going on in
the United States," Jayne said, refer
encing how large land owners are
able to support subsidies to continue
accumulating wealth.
Jayne concluded that policies
aimed at poverty reduction and agri
cultural development must address
these land inequalities, physical in
frastructure and public investments.

"There needs to be a public in
vestment strategy that will expand
access to land in areas that are cur
rently underutilized to allow some
kind of natural migration to be going
into these areas, to relieve the popu
lation pressures," Jayne said.
Following Jayne's speech, Derek
Byerlee, director of the 2009 World
Development Report, provided ad
ditional commentary. He agreed
with Jayne's main points and,in addi
tion, emphasized the need to address
the current system of land markets
and land rights. At present, 80 per
cent of the land is under customary
rights and under this informal sys
tem transactions are not recorded.
Byerlee argued for the need for
transparency in these transactions,
and like Jayne presented the tie be
tween land rights issues and other
social problems.
"I think it's going to be really crit
ical for maintaining peace and re
ducing conflict. I think a lot of the big
conflicts we've seen in Africa, trace
them back, and they reduce to prob
lems of land," Byerlee said.
