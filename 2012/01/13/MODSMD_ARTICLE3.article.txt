## Research looks to small farms in Africa 
### LUCY MUSSON 
Smallholder farms may hold the answer to issues of
hunger and poverty in Africa, according to Thorn Jayne,
professor of international development from Michigan
State University, who presented his research Thursday
evening as part of the Global Food Policy and Food Se
curity Symposium Series.
"The ironic thing is that Africa, which is the most food
insecure and impoverished continent in the world, also
has the greatest supply of unutilized arable land in the
world," Jayne said.
Despite the perception of Africa as a land-rich conti
nent, studies of where the people live reveal a different
situation, Jayne added.
"Much of rural Sub-Sahara Africa is sparsely popu
lated, but a high proportion of the rural people in the con
tinent do live in densely populated areas,'' Jayne said, ref

erencing population histograms.
Jayne used Zambia, the country in which he current
ly runs a policy program, to illustrate the negative effects
of living at the population threshold. Sixty-seven percent
of Zambia's population is not selling maize or other
crops due to their lack of access to land. Jayne argued this
leads to urbanization problems.
"Some of the problems of urban slums... are linked
in some respect to the problem of inability to earn a liveli
hood," Jayne said, highlighting the farmers in the bottom
tier who do not produce maize,
Javne used evidence from maize fanning in Zambia
to illustrate that agricultural growth does not necessarily
lead to poverty reduction. Following a maize subsidy in
the mid-2000s, maize production in Zambia doubled, but
rural poverty remained at 78 percent.
