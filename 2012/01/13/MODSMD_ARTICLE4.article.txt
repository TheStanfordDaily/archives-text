## Stanford Nobel Laureate wins top U.S. science honor 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Kristian Davis Bailey 
Former director of the Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center (SLAC) Burton
Richter was awarded the Presidential
Enrico Fermi Award on Thursday. The
award is one of the oldest and most pres
tigious science and technology distinc
tions granted by the U.S. Government.
The U.S. Department of Energy s
(DOE) Office of Science conferred the
honor on Richter, who is a Nobel Prize
winning physicist, and on Mildred Dres
selhausof M.I.T.
The Fermi Award is given to recog
nize scientists, engineers and science pol
icymakers who have given unstintingly
over their careers to advance energy sci
ence and technology, the DOE web
page states.
Richter boasts a lifelong career in the

physical sciences that has taken him
from a post-doctoral fellowship at Stan
ford in 1956 to a professorship in 1967
and a 15-year tenure as director of
SLAC, from 1984 to 1999.
Richter won the Nobel Prize in
Physics in 1976 along with Samuel Ting
for their work on the discovery of a sub
nuclear particle. His general research fo
cused on experimental particle physics
with high-energy electrons and electron
positron colliding beams.
In addition to his work in physical sci
ences, Richter has become a leader in en
ergy policy and national security affairs
in recent years, serving on the Secretary
of Energy Advisory Board, Laboratory
Operations Board and Nuclear Energy
Task Force. He chaired the National Re
search Council's Board on Physics and
Astronomy.
And in 2010, Richter published Be
yond Smoke and Mirrors a book that
examines the issues of nuclear energy
and climate change in the 21st century.
The book received the 2011 Phi Beta
Kappa Book award in science in
early December.
The Presidential Enrico Fermi
Award was named in honor of En
rico Fermi, an Italian-American
who discovered the first nuclear
chain reaction. The $50,000 hono
rarium and the gold medal bearing
an image of Fermi are granted to
scientists who excel in both theory
and experiment.
Energy Secretary Steven Chu
will present the award to Richter
and Dresselhaus later this year. The
two scientists will split the honorar
ium.
