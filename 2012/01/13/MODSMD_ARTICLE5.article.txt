# EPA homicides double in 2011
## Decades-long trend reflects decrease in violent crime 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The number of homicides in
East Palo Alto doubled this past
year, jumping from four homi
cides in 2010 to eight in 2011.
With a goal of zero homicides
in 2012, the city will rely heavily
upon its Operation Fourth
Quarter, a collaborative pro
gram that educates the commu
nity with the expectation of low
ering the rate of homicide.
The City of East Palo Alto
Police Department reported a 9
percent decrease in violent
crime and a 2 percent decrease
in overall crime during 2011. Ac

Davis, the doubling of homicides
over the past year, while emo

single digits.
"You do have to put it in con
text in a sense that, even though
it was double last year, it was the
same as the year before," Davis
said. "We're seeing a long-term
downward trend, clearly; but I
think the fact that we have these

increases and decreases, these
fluctuations, really underscores
how much work we have to get
done."
The chief referred to the five
murders in June and July of 2011
as the reason this year's homi
cide rate was unbalanced.
Specifically, he believes that a vi
olent crime spree of three indi
viduals accounted for three of
the five summer homicides,
pointing to the need to curb gang
violence in East Palo Alto. Con
trary to this past year's data, his
torical trends of homicide in
East Palo Alto typically show an
increase during the last three
months of the year.
Operation Fourth Quarter
was established in 2007 to count
er the trend of East Palo Alto
homicides in the fourth quarter
of 2006, during which three mur
ders occurred in two weeks. The
program focuses on enforce
ment of laws and prevention of
crimes.
"It makes the community
aware that this is a historical
time, that we do have violence,
and it provides, what we think, is
