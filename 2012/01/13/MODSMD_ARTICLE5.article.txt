# EPA homicides double in 2011
## Decades-long trend reflects decrease in violent crime 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The number of homicides in
East Palo Alto doubled this past
year, jumping from four homi
cides in 2010 to eight in 2011.
With a goal of zero homicides
in 2012, the city will rely heavily
upon its Operation Fourth
Quarter, a collaborative pro
gram that educates the commu
nity with the expectation of low
ering the rate of homicide.
The City of East Palo Alto
Police Department reported a 9
percent decrease in violent
crime and a 2 percent decrease
in overall crime during 2011. Ac
cording to Police Chief Ronald
Davis, the doubling of homicides
over the past year, while emo
tionally significant, is not statisti
cally significant. Rather, it
demonstrates the extreme fluc
tuation of homicide rates in the
single digits.
"You do have to put it in con
text in a sense that, even though
it was double last year, it was the
same as the year before," Davis
said. "We're seeing a long-term
downward trend, clearly; but I
think the fact that we have these

increases and decreases, these
fluctuations, really underscores
how much work we have to get
done."
The chief referred to the five
murders in June and July of 2011
as the reason this year's homi
cide rate was unbalanced.
Specifically, he believes that a vi
olent crime spree of three indi
viduals accounted for three of
the five summer homicides,
pointing to the need to curb gang
violence in East Palo Alto. Con
trary to this past year's data, his
torical trends of homicide in
East Palo Alto typically show an
increase during the last three
months of the year.
Operation Fourth Quarter
was established in 2007 to count
er the trend of East Palo Alto
homicides in the fourth quarter
of 2006, during which three mur
ders occurred in two weeks. The
program focuses on enforce
ment of laws and prevention of
crimes.
"It makes the community
aware that this is a historical
time, that we do have violence,
and it provides, what we think, is
a comprehensive approach,"
Davis said. "It's not just enforce
ment. We try to schedule and en
gage in prevention programs, in
tervention programs and clearly,
enforcement strategies."
Involved in the collaborative,
community efforts are local
youth, fraternities and parents,
among others. These groups are
engaged in town hall meetings,
roundtable discussions, youth
summits and other educational
events. Internally, Operation
Fourth Quarter increases police
enforcement with the addition of
narcotics and gang investigations,
compliance checks and tactical
operations on a weekly basis.
"I think [the community is]
doing a tremendous job fighting
crime and violence. But, the fact
that [it] can fluctuate so greatly
suggests that many of the core is-

sues that involve crime and vio
lence remain," Davis said. "We
keep fighting the battle; we're
doing a great job, but we [have]
got to get to those core issues, oth
erwise one argument, one issue
leads to a spark and major prob
lems for us."
Despite the continued risk of
violence, the East Palo Alto Po
lice Department reported that
the amount of gun violence did
not increase proportionally to the
number of homicides this past

year. Davis said he views this
trend as promising, noting that
factors such as the caliber of
weaponry and the proximity of
the shooter were likely more re
sponsible for the deaths than an
overall increase in gun violence.
"I think [Operation Fourth
Quarter has] made a tremendous
difference. We haven't seen those
kinds of numbers since then,"
Davis said, noting that even so, vi
olence usually remains highest
during the fourth quarter.
The city has seen a decline of
homicides over the past decade.
While the count was often in the
double digits during the 19905,
reaching a record of 42 homicides
in 1992, recent years have been
relatively peaceful, ranging be
tween four and 15 killings in the
past six years.
"We're small enough that four
is outrageous," Davis said. "There
is no reason why we cannot have
zero homicides in a year."
