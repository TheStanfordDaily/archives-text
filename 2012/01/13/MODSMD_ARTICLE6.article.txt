## BeWell expands to offer spousal benefits 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Entering its fifth year, Be-
Well, a campus incentive pro
gram to encourage healthy
lifestyles for community mem
bers, has expanded to offer fi
nancial benefits to spouses and
registered domestic partners of
University benefits-eligible em
ployees. In addition, BeWell has
started offering employee par
ticipants the option of sharing
and exchanging their BeWell
records with those from an out
side medical plan.
Stanford's BeWell program
provides participating Universi
ty employees with yearly fiscal
incentives, advising, nutrition
workshops, gym memberships,
classes and other services to help
them make healthy decisions,
thereby hoping to prevent heart
disease, cancer, diabetes and
metabolic syndrome. Under
graduates and graduate students

can also use BeWell to track
their health progress and partic
ipate in events, but do not re
ceive financial incentives.
Spouses and registered do
mestic partners will not have ac
cess to "BeWell Berries," a pack
age of benefits including a year
ly fitness assessment and classes,
offered to employees in addition
to the lifestyle assessment and fi
nancial incentives that make up
the core of the program.
"It would be great to see the
at least 50 percent of [participat
ing] employees with spouses or
registered domestic partners
participating in the program,"
said Jennifer Sexton, director of
fitness and wellness programs,
about the new initiative. "We
had over 6,300 faculty and staff
complete the SHALA and Well
ness Profile in
2011."
