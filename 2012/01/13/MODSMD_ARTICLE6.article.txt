## BeWell expands to offer spousal benefits 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Entering its fifth year, Be-
Well, a campus incentive pro
gram to encourage healthy
lifestyles for community mem
bers, has expanded to offer fi
nancial benefits to spouses and
registered domestic partners of
University benefits-eligible em
ployees. In addition, BeWell has
started offering employee par
ticipants the option of sharing
and exchanging their BeWell
records with those from an out
side medical plan.
Stanford's BeWell program
provides participating Universi
ty employees with yearly fiscal
incentives, advising, nutrition
workshops, gym memberships,
classes and other services to help
them make healthy decisions,
thereby hoping to prevent heart
disease, cancer, diabetes and
metabolic syndrome. Under
graduates and graduate students

can also use BeWell to track
their health progress and partic
ipate in events, but do not re
ceive financial incentives.
Spouses and registered do
mestic partners will not have ac
cess to "BeWell Berries," a pack
age of benefits including a year
ly fitness assessment and classes,
offered to employees in addition
to the lifestyle assessment and fi
nancial incentives that make up
the core of the program.
"It would be great to see the
at least 50 percent of [participat
ing] employees with spouses or
registered domestic partners
participating in the program,"
said Jennifer Sexton, director of
fitness and wellness programs,
about the new initiative. "We
had over 6,300 faculty and staff
complete the SHALA and Well
ness Profile in
2011."
Sexton noted that the number
of spouses and registered domes
tic partners expected to enroll is
uncertain.
"We'd love to see the same
participation rate with the faculty
and staff, just under 50 percent,
but I don't know how many peo
ple who qualify have a spouse or
partner," Sexton said. "If we saw
half of the 6,300, it would be
great."
BeWell encourages Stanford
employees to send in their med
ical information on a yearly basis
by increasing the fiscal incentive
for returning participants. First
time participants receive $2OO for
completing the Stanford Health
and Lifestyle Assessment
(SHALA) and Wellness Profile.
A returning participant who com
pleted SHALA and the Wellness
Profile for 2011 qualifies to re
ceive $4BO after completing this
year's profile.
In previous years, these bene
fits and fiscal incentives have only
been made available to Stanford
employees, but BeWell has
changed its policy to also benefit

the spouses and domestic part
ners of these employees. Qualify
ing spouses and registered do
mestic partners must complete
three requirements to receive the
$240 taxable wellness reward in
2013. BeWell requires that spous
es or partners complete the
SHALA and Wellness Profile,
agree to share information in
2012 and enroll in a Stanford
sponsored medical plan in 2013.
The Be Well mission is to serve
"as the overarching health and
wellness resource for Stanford
University," according to the pro
gram's website. In its mission
statement, the program states
that "by facilitating a culture of
wellness at Stanford, we encour
age individuals to adopt and
maintain a healthy lifestyle and
behaviors to improve their
health, well-being and quality of
life."
BeWell approaches the ques
tion of how to stay healthy by per
sonalizing its resources to address
the employee's individual needs.
Participating employees must
first fill out the health and
lifestyle assessment, which serves
as the "gateway to the BeWell
program." BeWell reports that
the assessment is not meant to be
time-consuming, and takes on av
erage 20 minutes to complete.

Only after the employee has com
pleted the SHALA profile can he
or she move on to fill out the Well
ness Profile.
The Wellness Profile consists
of three components, which in
clude a screening, followed by ad
vising and finally a planning stage.
Once employees have undergone
their screening, they are provided
with a free one-to-one advising
session. Participants meet with
wellness advisors who tailor the
program to the individual, consid
ering data such as total choles
terol, HDL, glucose, body mass
index, waist circumference and
blood pressure.

I don't know how
many people who
qualify have a
spouse.
