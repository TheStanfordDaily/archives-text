## Law professors react to PIPA, SOPA legislation 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
Congress is expected to con
sider two bills when it returns
from recess on Jan. 24: the Pre
venting Real Online Threats to
Economic Creativity and Theft
of Intellectual Property Act
(PROTECT IP Act or PIPA)
and the Stop Online Piracy Act
(SOPA).
The legislation is of major
concern to Stanford thought
leaders, in addition to nation
wide legal experts, online securi
ty experts, Internet activists and
the founders of many of Silicon
Valley's largest companies
"The answer is to innovate,
not to pass stupid laws that are
going to screw up the Internet,"
said Anthony Falzone, executive
director of the Fair Use Project
at the Stanford Center for Inter
net and Society (SCIS) at a Dec.
7 event hosted by SCIS called,
"What's wrong with SOPA?"
The panel convened experts on
Internet infrastructure and secu
rity, digital intellectual property
and Silicon Valley business to ar
ticulate many of SOPA's prob
lems.
More than 150 people attend
ed the Law School event, which
was "not meant to give equal
time to both sides," according to
Falzone. The audience did in
clude two representatives from
the Motion Picture Association
of America, supporters of SOPA
and PIPA, who spoke up during
a question and answer session.
"There were things about this
bill that people in Silicon Valley
needed to know that is
lawyers, entrepreneurs and tech
nology people," Falzone said.
"Our goal was to put together an
array of people who could speak
to each one of those sets of con
siderations."
Professor Mark Lemley, di
rector of the Stanford Program
in Law, Science and Technology,
spoke in a January interview
with The Daily of the necessity
of publicizing what he character
ized as the incredible harm of
this potential legislation.
"PIPA was introduced in the
Senate in early 2011 and it went
through the Senate Judiciary
Committee unanimously . . .
mostly I think because people
hadn't paid attention to it," Lem
ley said.
Lemley believes this unani
mous action occurred because
PIPA was a less extreme bill than
SOPA a conscious legislative
decision to make the "lesser of
two evils" look like a healthy
compromise.
Both pieces of legislation are
almost exclusively supported by
traditional media companies
like Viacom and members of

Recording Industry Association
of America, as well as companies
heavily reliant on brands such as
Nike, the NBA and Pfizer.
The founders of Google,
Yahoo, Twitter, Linkedln and
many other Silicon Valley giants
published an open letter warn
ing of the dangers of SOPA and
PIPA.
The letter appeared as a paid
advertisement in The New York
Times, The Washington Post and
other newspapers. It predicted
SOPA and PIPA would, "have a
chilling effect on innovation"
and change "the very basic struc
ture of the Internet."
The letter also raised the legal
concern that this legislation al
lows the closure of websites
without due process and could
be used to stifle legitimate
speech.
"If we just shut down the In
ternet there would be a lot less
piracy, right?" Lemley said. "But,
there is a lot of socially valuable
material that we get only be
cause of the Internet."
In the most severe version of
SOPA the Attorney General
would have authority to bring
action against websites accused
of "committing or facilitating
online piracy."
The bill also provides for a
system of notifications directly
from the copyright holder to web
services like Internet service
providers (ISP) and search en
gines. These web services are
then able to suspend service to
specific sites and are immune
from prosecution for doing so in
error.
"You wouldn't necessarily
even bring anybody into court,"
Lemley said. "So each individual
ISP who gets this notice has now
got to keep a separate black list."
Falzone said he fears a world
in which websites could be shut
down, "in a completely invisible
way."
"You would have people
doing these deals in the prover
bial smoky backroom ... pick
ing up the phone and saying,
'Wouldn't it be so unpleasant if
we had to go through an elabo
rate process and spend money
on lawyers?"' Falzone said.
Of further concern is that the
act of physically limiting the
websites that computers can ac
cess would not only fundamen
tally change the way the Internet
currently operates, but in so
doing would negate current ef
forts at improved Internet secu
rity.
For Lemley, the physical
blocking of websites has foreign
policy ramifications as well.
"It's awfully hard to persuade
the Chinas and Irans of the
world that they should open
their society and Internet to
things they object to when we
won't open our society to things
we object to," Lemley said.
A third bill that Congress will
consider, the Online Protection
& Enforcement of Digital Trade
Act (OPEN Act) may address
some of the professor's concerns
with SOPA and PIPA.
This legislation would differ
from SOPA because it would not
allow for the physical blocking
of websites; rather it would
block funding for the infringing
websites. It would also be en
forced by the International
Trade Commission and do away
with the notification system of
SOPA.
Falzone predicts that what
Congress will ultimately pass
will be similar to the OPEN Act
and not SOPA. Falzone also said
he foresees a more prolonged
battle.
"Silicon Valley has now really
thrown their weight behind [op
posing SOPA & PIPA], and it is a
real fight . . . everybody has
brought their big guns."

The letter appeared as a paid
advertisement in The New York
Times, The Washington Post and
other newspapers. It predicted
SOPA and PIPA would, "have a
chilling effect on innovation"
and change "the very basic struc
ture of the Internet."
The letter also raised the legal
concern that this legislation al
lows the closure of websites
without due process and could
be used to stifle legitimate
speech.
"If we just shut down the In
ternet there would be a lot less
piracy, right?" Lemley said. "But,
there is a lot of socially valuable
material that we get only be
cause of the Internet."
In the most severe version of
SOPA the Attorney General
would have authority to bring
action against websites accused
of "committing or facilitating
online piracy."
The bill also provides for a
system of notifications directly
from the copyright holder to web
services like Internet service
providers (ISP) and search en
gines. These web services are
then able to suspend service to
specific sites and are immune
from prosecution for doing so in
error.
"You wouldn't necessarily
even bring anybody into court,"
Lemley said. "So each individual
ISP who gets this notice has now
got to keep a separate black list."
Falzone said he fears a world
in which websites could be shut
down, "in a completely invisible
way."
"You would have people
doing these deals in the prover
bial smoky backroom ... pick
ing up the phone and saying,
'Wouldn't it be so unpleasant if
we had to go through an elabo
rate process and spend money
on lawyers?"' Falzone said.
Of further concern is that the
act of physically limiting the
websites that computers can ac
cess would not only fundamen
tally change the way the Internet
currently operates, but in so
doing would negate current ef
forts at improved Internet secu
rity.
For Lemley, the physical
blocking of websites has foreign
policy ramifications as well.
"It's awfully hard to persuade
the Chinas and Irans of the
world that they should open
their society and Internet to
things they object to when we
won't open our society to things
we object to," Lemley said.
A third bill that Congress will
consider, the Online Protection
& Enforcement of Digital Trade
Act (OPEN Act) may address
some of the professor's concerns
with SOPA and PIPA.
This legislation would differ
from SOPA because it would not
allow for the physical blocking
of websites; rather it would
block funding for the infringing
websites. It would also be en
forced by the International
Trade Commission and do away
with the notification system of
SOPA.
Falzone predicts that what
Congress will ultimately pass
will be similar to the OPEN Act
and not SOPA. Falzone also said
he foresees a more prolonged
battle.
"Silicon Valley has now really
thrown their weight behind [op
posing SOPA & PIPA], and it is a
real fight . . . everybody has
brought their big guns."

Congress is expected to con
sider two bills when it returns
from recess on Jan. 24: the Pre
venting Real Online Threats to
Economic Creativity and Theft
of Intellectual Property Act
(PROTECT IP Act or PIPA)
and the Stop Online Piracy Act
(SOPA).
The legislation is of major
concern to Stanford thought
leaders, in addition to nation
wide legal experts, online securi
ty experts, Internet activists and
the founders of many of Silicon
Valley's largest companies
"The answer is to innovate,
not to pass stupid laws that are
going to screw up the Internet,"
said Anthony Falzone, executive
director of the Fair Use Project
at the Stanford Center for Inter
net and Society (SCIS) at a Dec.
7 event hosted by SCIS called,
"What's wrong with SOPA?"
The panel convened experts on
Internet infrastructure and secu
rity, digital intellectual property
and Silicon Valley business to ar
ticulate many of SOPA's prob
lems.
More than 150 people attend
ed the Law School event, which
was "not meant to give equal
time to both sides," according to
Falzone. The audience did in
clude two representatives from
the Motion Picture Association
of America, supporters of SOPA
and PIPA, who spoke up during
a question and answer session.
"There were things about this
bill that people in Silicon Valley
needed to know that is
lawyers, entrepreneurs and tech
nology people," Falzone said.
"Our goal was to put together an
array of people who could speak
to each one of those sets of con
siderations."
Professor Mark Lemley, di
rector of the Stanford Program
in Law, Science and Technology,
spoke in a January interview
with The Daily of the necessity
of publicizing what he character
ized as the incredible harm of
this potential legislation.
"PIPA was introduced in the
Senate in early 2011 and it went
through the Senate Judiciary
Committee unanimously . . .
mostly I think because people
hadn't paid attention to it," Lem
ley said.
Lemley believes this unani
mous action occurred because
PIPA was a less extreme bill than
SOPA a conscious legislative
decision to make the "lesser of
two evils" look like a healthy
compromise.
Both pieces of legislation are
almost exclusively supported by
traditional media companies
like Viacom and members of

Recording Industry Association
of America, as well as companies
heavily reliant on brands such as
Nike, the NBA and Pfizer.
The founders of Google,
Yahoo, Twitter, Linkedln and
many other Silicon Valley giants
published an open letter warn
ing of the dangers of SOPA and
PIPA.
The letter appeared as a paid
advertisement in The New York
Times, The Washington Post and
