Do you live in the San Francisco Bay
area, are in good health and between
the ages of 20 -79?
Would you like to know your own telomere length -- a general
biomarker of overall health?
Telome Health Inc., a Menlo Park biotechnology firm, is researching age-based
average telomere length in Bay Area residents. The study involves completing a
20 minute on-line health survey, and coming to our offices for 3 separate fasting
blood draw and saliva collections over a twelve month period.
Participants will be reimbursed for their time with $2O upon completion of
each blood draw. They will also have the option to receive a report of their telomere
length, and educational information about telomeres and health.
