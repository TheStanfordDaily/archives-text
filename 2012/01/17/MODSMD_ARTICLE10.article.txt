# I'M DONE WITH MY LIFE
## It's that time again 
### Camira Powell 
We're back! Can you believe
it? I can't, mainly because I
don't want to. I won't lie, it's
only been a few days and it feels...
different. I've heard it can be hard ad
justing to life back on campus after
being away, like going home for the
first time after leaving for college.
Even though I'm here, I still don't
feel like I'm here. Maybe it's because
I'm starting school for the first time
the second time this year, or maybe it
is because it is, well, winter quarter.
As I walk around campus, joy and
hope for the future is palpable. Stu
dents are playing Frisbee on the
lawns, biking into the sunset and
it's January. It's literally like being in
a scene from one of those movies
that extol the virtues of the quintes
sential "college experience." Howev
er, this kind of New Year enthusiasm
can quickly be extinguished by the
daily grind of school.The sun doesn't
shine forever, even in California. The
winter rains seem to wash away the
light, happy spirit that is indicative of
a new quarter a new year.

Always wanting the present year
to be even better than the one past, I
make tons of New Year's Resolu
tions. Most of them are generic
mantras and affirmations about
learning from mistakes, being the
best you can be and all that jazz. But
when 2012 rolled around, I felt like it
was time for something different.
This year, I wanted to make attain
able, realistic resolutions so I could
make concrete changes in my life. So,
I came up with these:
Be nice(r) Personally, I think I'm
sweeter than Splenda. However,

some of my friends (and family) tend
to disagree. Whenever I hear some
one tell me this, my initial response is
"WTF? I'm so done with you." And
after doing this for the millionth time
and watching my friends roll their
eyes at me (again), that's when it hit
me. Maybe they're more right than I
want to admit. So this year, I'm re
solved to be nicer, or at least, a little
less direct upon first approach. Even
though it goes against my natural in
stincts to not check someone right
away if they're doing something
basic, I should still try. In theory, I'll
get more faith in people if I see them
correct themselves, and I'll look like
the brighter, friendlier person I want
to become.

Be Healthy(er) I'm with Con
gress on this one: pizza should count
as a vegetable, and any form of a po
tato (fried, especially) should too.
I'll be the first to admit that I'm not
the healthiest person in world, and I
know no doctor or sane person
would support my beliefs. As an ar
dent fan of Michelle Obama, I'm
going to jump on this whole "let's
move" bandwagon and commit to
stepping up my health game. This
means eating green things that
aren't Skittles and coming to terms
with my fear of vegetables (they are
not evil.) And my commitment to
being healthier extends beyond the
physical; it includes the mental as
well. Healthy looks a little different
for everyone. For some, it's learning
how to reduce stress by not taking
on as much responsibility, and for
others, it's spending more time
thinking positive thoughts to create

a positive self-image. For me, it
comes down to actually maintain
ing a balance between eating well,
stressing less and making time for
stuff that makes me happy. Easier
said than done, but I think it's
doable.

Be Spontaneous(er) I support
the concept of going with the flow. As
a California native, I'm all for not
forcing things to happen and seeing
where life takes you. Yet, I would not
consider myself impulsive. Even
though being spontaneous is nor
mally associated with doing stuff
without thinking, that doesn't neces
sarily have to be a bad thing. We're
Stanford students. We like to think
and we're good at it (duh, that's how
we got in here in the first place), but
sometimes there is a downside to
thinking too much, i.e. overdrinking
the little stuff Sometimes,it's just bet
ter to go for it than analyze it later.
Like Nike says, "Just do it." After all,
if we can't believe in a multimillion
dollar brand, then who can we trust?
I am determined to stay strong.
Why? Besides the personal fulfill
ment that comes with maintaining
resolutions past January 2, they are
also legitimate things that I have the
power to change. These little changes
might even be the rainbows that
come with rain in the winter.

Camira would love to hear your reso
lutions for this year, too. Let her know

one tell me this, my initial response is
"WTF? I'm so done with you." And
after doing this for the millionth time
and watching my friends roll their
eyes at me (again), that's when it hit
me. Maybe they're more right than I
want to admit. So this year, I'm re
solved to be nicer, or at least, a little
less direct upon first approach. Even
though it goes against my natural in
stincts to not check someone right
away if they're doing something
basic, I should still try. In theory, I'll
get more faith in people if I see them
correct themselves, and I'll look like
the brighter, friendlier person I want
to become.

Be Healthy(er) I'm with Con
gress on this one: pizza should count
as a vegetable, and any form of a po
tato (fried, especially) should too.
I'll be the first to admit that I'm not
the healthiest person in world, and I
know no doctor or sane person
would support my beliefs. As an ar
dent fan of Michelle Obama, I'm
going to jump on this whole "let's
move" bandwagon and commit to
stepping up my health game. This
means eating green things that
aren't Skittles and coming to terms
with my fear of vegetables (they are
not evil.) And my commitment to
being healthier extends beyond the
physical; it includes the mental as
well. Healthy looks a little different
for everyone. For some, it's learning
how to reduce stress by not taking
on as much responsibility, and for
others, it's spending more time
thinking positive thoughts to create

a positive self-image. For me, it
comes down to actually maintain
ing a balance between eating well,
stressing less and making time for
stuff that makes me happy. Easier
said than done, but I think it's
doable.

Be Spontaneous(er) I support
the concept of going with the flow. As
a California native, I'm all for not
forcing things to happen and seeing
where life takes you. Yet, I would not
consider myself impulsive. Even
though being spontaneous is nor
mally associated with doing stuff
without thinking, that doesn't neces
sarily have to be a bad thing. We're
Stanford students. We like to think
and we're good at it (duh, that's how
we got in here in the first place), but
sometimes there is a downside to
thinking too much, i.e. overdrinking
the little stuff Sometimes,it's just bet
ter to go for it than analyze it later.
Like Nike says, "Just do it." After all,
if we can't believe in a multimillion
dollar brand, then who can we trust?
I am determined to stay strong.
Why? Besides the personal fulfill
ment that comes with maintaining
resolutions past January 2, they are
also legitimate things that I have the
power to change. These little changes
might even be the rainbows that
come with rain in the winter.

Camira would love to hear your reso
lutions for this year, too. Let her know

We're back! Can you believe
it? I can't, mainly because I
don't want to. I won't lie, it's
only been a few days and it feels...
different. I've heard it can be hard ad
justing to life back on campus after
being away, like going home for the
first time after leaving for college.
Even though I'm here, I still don't
feel like I'm here. Maybe it's because
I'm starting school for the first time
the second time this year, or maybe it
is because it is, well, winter quarter.
As I walk around campus, joy and
hope for the future is palpable. Stu
dents are playing Frisbee on the
lawns, biking into the sunset and
it's January. It's literally like being in
a scene from one of those movies
that extol the virtues of the quintes
sential "college experience." Howev
er, this kind of New Year enthusiasm
can quickly be extinguished by the
daily grind of school.The sun doesn't
shine forever, even in California. The
winter rains seem to wash away the
light, happy spirit that is indicative of
a new quarter a new year.

Always wanting the present year
to be even better than the one past, I
make tons of New Year's Resolu
tions. Most of them are generic
mantras and affirmations about
learning from mistakes, being the
best you can be and all that jazz. But
when 2012 rolled around, I felt like it
was time for something different.
This year, I wanted to make attain
able, realistic resolutions so I could
make concrete changes in my life. So,
I came up with these:
Be nice(r) Personally, I think I'm
sweeter than Splenda. However,

some of my friends (and family) tend
to disagree. Whenever I hear some
one tell me this, my initial response is
"WTF? I'm so done with you." And
after doing this for the millionth time
and watching my friends roll their
eyes at me (again), that's when it hit
