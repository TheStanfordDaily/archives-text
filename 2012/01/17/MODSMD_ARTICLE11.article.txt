# Health insurance exhibits no effects for diabetics in developing countries
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF Kurt Chirbas 
According to a recent study,
those with health insurance do not
experience better care or treat
ment for diabetes than those with
out insurance in developing coun
tries such as India and China.

The study, which will be pub
lished on Jan. 24 in the journal of
the American Diabetes Associa
tion titled Diabetes Care, looked at
responses to a global survey by the
World Health Organization, using
the data from 35 countries that
could be described as "low- or mid
dle-income" in 2002 and 2003, ac
cording to a press release on Free
man Spogli Institute (FSI) for In
ternational Studies website.
Using this information, re
searchers discovered that those di
abetics with health insurance were
not more likely to have proper
medication, nor were they less like
ly to be in a state of "catastrophic
medical spending," than those
without health insurance. The lat
ter term is classified as those who
spend "more than 25 percent of a
household income on medical
care," according to the study.
The study concluded that some
reasons why diabetics with health
insurance do not fare better in de
veloping countries is because of a
shortage of a supply of medica
tions like insulin in these coun
tries, as well as high co-payments
or deductibles.
"Public and private health in
surance programs aren't providing
sufficient protection for diabetics
in many developing countries,"
said Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert,
assistant professor of medicine and
leader of the researcher, in the
press release. "People with insur
ance aren't doing markedly better
than those who don't have it.
Health insurance and health sys
tems need to be re-oriented to bet
ter address chronic diseases like di
abetes."

Researchers said that this is a
pressing problem because the
number of diabetics in these coun
tries is likely to increase over the
years as household incomes in
crease, and not treating diabetes
often leads to those individuals to
spiral into an even worse medical
and financial state.

"It's important to get ahead of
the curve and prepare so there's
an infrastructure in place to deal
with these health and cost issues,"

Goldhaber-Fiebert said.
