## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€”Kurt Chirbas 
Stanford School of Medicine is
one of 130 universities and col
leges to sign a pledge promising to
devote more of its resources to
wards improving the health care of
military service members and
their families, according to a White
House press release. First Lady
Michelle Obama announced the
pledge last Wednesday during a
speech at Virginia Common
wealth University (VCU).
The pledge is formed though a
partnership between the Associa
tion of American Medical Col
leges (AAMC), the American As
sociation of Colleges of Osteo
pathic Medicine (AACOM) and
Joining Forces. Joining Forces is a
national initiative led by Obama
and U.S. Vice President Joe
Biden's wife, Jill Biden, with the
purpose of "bringing] attention to
the unique needs and strength of
America's military families," ac
cording to its website.
Participants include 105 med
ical schools, such as Harvard Med
ical School and Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine,
and 25 colleges of osteopathic
medicine. Those signing the
pledge commit to further training
their students how to diagnose and
treat issues concerning military
veterans, especially post-traumat
ic stress disorder (PTSD) and
traumatic brain injury (TBI), as
well as developing new research
and trials for these disorders.

"I'm inspired to see our nation's
medical schools step up to address
this pressing need for our veterans
and military families," Obama said
during her speech at VCU. "By di
recting some of our brightest minds,
our most cutting-edge research and
our finest teaching institutions to
ward our military families, they're
ensuring that those who have
served our country receive the first
rate care that they have earned."

Obama cited the fact that one
sixth of military veterans exhibit
signs of PTSD, and that "those of us
who have never experienced war
will never be able to fully under
stand the true emotional cost."

"Because of our integrated mis
sions in education, clinical care and
research, America's medical
schools are uniquely positioned to
take a leadership role in this impor
tant effort," said Darrell G. Kirch,
AAMC president and CEO, in the
press release.
