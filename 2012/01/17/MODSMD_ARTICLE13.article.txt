## BUFFS BEATEN RANDLE, HUESTIS LEAD CARD TO WIN 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Freshman guard Chasson Randle had in
stant-impact potential long before he arrived
on the Farm, but his contributions thus far
have exceeded any and all expectations.

Randle had 18 points to lead all scorers as
the Stanford men's basketball team took
down Pac-12 newcomer Colorado 84-64 on
Saturday. The outcome represented the
biggest conference win of the season for the
Cardinal, which has won five out of its past six
games.

"I feel like we executed well," Randle said.
"This was definitely one of our best perform
ances on both ends of the court. For us it's all
about getting better."

Stanford (15-3,5-1 Pac-12) had one of its
most efficient outings of the year, as the
young squad connected on 52 percent of its
shots and dished out 16 assists to just 11

turnovers. The reduction of lost possessions
was crucial in dominating Colorado (11-6,3-
2 Pac-12) in all facets of the game.
Cardinal head coach Johnny Dawkins was
impressed with his team's offensive effort,
particularly with its focus on meaningful
passes.

"Our ball movement was as good as it's
been all year," Dawkins said.
Sophomore guard Aaron Bright and sen
ior forward Josh Owens were efficient from

the field, combining for 24 points on 7-of-12
shooting. It was, however, sophomore for
ward Josh Huestis who impressed once again.
The Cardinal's most productive bench player
finished with 13 points, four rebounds and
four blocks in just 23 minutes of action, his
second consecutive double-digit scoring per
formance.
Huestis was pleased by Stanford's all-

around effort and saw Saturday's
outpouring as a meaningful sign
of things to come.
"We feel like we are a good
matchup for anybody," Fluestis
said. "We just played harder.
Thursday was not a good defen
sive effort."

Despite overwhelmingly neg
ative attention for the conference
as a whole a league that is
without a team currently ranked
in any major poll or in the top 35
in RPI Stanford is making a le
gitimate claim to being one of the
few potential earners of an
NCAA Tournament bid come
March. A win over the Buffaloes,
who entered this week in sole
possession of the Pac-12 lead, is a
good way to attract votes moving
forward.

Colorado relied heavily on its
starters on offense, with the start
ing five recording 56 of the team's
64 points. More noticeably, how
ever, was the team's inability to
rebound with the Stanford front
line. The Buffs rank first in the
league in defensive boards per
game but were outrebounded by
Stanford 23-15 on the defensive
glass.

"You've got to credit Stan
ford," said Colorado head coach
Tad Boyle. "Stanford played a

heck of a game. We knew re
bounding was going to be a key,
and they beat us on the boards
and pretty handily."
The Buffaloes were led by
sophomore forward Andrew
Roberson, who tallied 15 points
but managed to pull down just
four boards, nearly eight below
his season average. Austin Du
fault, Carlon Brown and Spencer
Dinwiddle joined Roberson in
double digits. Colorado made just
six of its 17 three-point attempts
and finished its Bay road trip
without a win.
"What we take from this game
is that we just have to do things
better execute better offen
sively, and we gotta be tougher,"
Boyle said. "We have a lot of
young guys, and for us it's some
thing different every night we
have to address."
For Stanford, things are begin
ning to shape up nicely. The Car
dinal is on pace to win 15 of its 18
conference games, but the team
must first battle through one of its
toughest stretches of the season, a
three-game stint on the road that
begins with the Washington
schools and finishes with a tough
matchup against Cal in which the
Golden Bears will most likely be
favored.

Thursday's contest against
Washington State tips off at 7:05
p.m. in Pullman.
