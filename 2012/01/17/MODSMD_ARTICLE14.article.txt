# TINKLE SPURS STAMPEDE
## STANFORD RUNS ALL OVER BUFFALOES IN PAC-12 WIN 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Completing a road sweep of
the newly-added Pac-12 schools,
the Stanford women's basketball
team comfortably defeated Col
orado 80-54 last Saturday in Boul
der.

The No. 4 Cardinal (15-1, 6-0
Pac-12) started relatively slow
against the Lady Buffaloes (13-3,
2-3 Pac-12), and though Stanford
began the game with a nine-point
run, Colorado fought back to
within four midway through the
first half. However, that was the
closest the Lady Buffs would get,
and by the break the Card led 32-
15. Stanford then returned for the
second period with an 11-3 run
that all but killed the contest even
though there was still 16:56 re
maining.

Four of Stanford's starters
senior forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike, her sister sophomore for
ward Chiney, junior forward
Joslyn Tinkle and sophomore
guard Toni Kokenis reached
double-figure point totals, led by
Tinkle, who tied her career record
of 20. The shooting performance
of these players was in high con
trast to the struggles against Utah
in Salt Lake City and also to the
rest of the team. The overall field
goal percentage only increased a
small amount from the 43.3 per
cent against the Utes to 50 percent
in this game, but considering just
these four starters, the jump was
substantial. In Utah the shooting
accuracy was roughly the same
across the team, but in Colorado
these four hit 66.7 percent com
pared to just 15.8 percent from the
other players.
In contrast, though Colorado
shared the scoring responsibility
much more equally, its starters

only managed a combined 18
points between them. Critically
this included the Lady Buffs' two
statistically best players, junior
guard Chucky Jeffery and fresh
man guard Lexy Kresl. They came
into the contest averaging 17.2
and 10.8 points per game and left
with just two and three points, re
spectively, as each shot l-for-10.
Tire fact that these two players
were kept quiet and that the game
was almost seven minutes old be
fore Colorado scored its first
points clearly demonstrates the
good defensive performance
made by Stanford. The Lady
Buffs' top two performers were
freshman forward Jen Reese and
sophomore guard Brittany Wilson
with 10 points each. However,
only two of Wilson's baskets came
before Stanford had already
scored enough points to win the
game outright. When the Card
began to lower its guard and play
deeper from the bench, Reese hit
her first the basket with just 10
minutes remaining.

Apart from the shooting accu
racy of her bench, the biggest con
cern in this game for Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer may
have been the health of Nnemka
di Ogwumike. At the four-minute
mark she went down in a scramble
for the ball under the basket and
hurt her right ankle. The injury
kept her out of the first half for
over five minutes, but with the
ankle taped up, she went on to
post an important 19 points from
her 26 minutes on court.

In Nnemkadi Ogwumike's
temporary absence, Tinkle
stepped up and made a key contri
bution to the Card's victory. In
contrast to the pre-Christmas rout
of Cal State Bakersfield at
Maples, where Tinkle set a career
high of 20 points, this was a Pac-12
conference game with a lot more
at stake. In that contest Van-
Derveer was happy to rest her
usual starters, which was not the
case on Saturday, when both the
Ogwumike sisters and Kokenis

spent substantial time on the hard
wood. In Tinkle's second-straight
start, she made a good case for
more by opening the scoring,
downing her first four shots and
making no mistakes from the
charity stripe.
In the face of some of the strug
gles during the road trip, Tinkle's
performance will have come as
some comfort to VanDerveer,
who will not want to have to rely

purely on her National Player of
the Year contender Nnemkadi
Ogwumike to capture the inaugu
ral Pac-12 title.
Stanford returns to campus
this week to face Washington
State on Thursday followed by
Washington on Saturday at
Maples Pavilion.

into the contest averaging 17.2
and 10.8 points per game and left
with just two and three points, re
spectively, as each shot l-for-10.
Tire fact that these two players
were kept quiet and that the game
was almost seven minutes old be
fore Colorado scored its first
points clearly demonstrates the
good defensive performance
made by Stanford. The Lady
Buffs' top two performers were
freshman forward Jen Reese and
sophomore guard Brittany Wilson
with 10 points each. However,
only two of Wilson's baskets came
before Stanford had already
scored enough points to win the
game outright. When the Card
began to lower its guard and play
deeper from the bench, Reese hit
her first the basket with just 10
minutes remaining.

Apart from the shooting accu
racy of her bench, the biggest con
cern in this game for Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer may
have been the health of Nnemka
di Ogwumike. At the four-minute
mark she went down in a scramble
for the ball under the basket and
hurt her right ankle. The injury
kept her out of the first half for
over five minutes, but with the
ankle taped up, she went on to
post an important 19 points from
her 26 minutes on court.

In Nnemkadi Ogwumike's
temporary absence, Tinkle
stepped up and made a key contri
bution to the Card's victory. In
contrast to the pre-Christmas rout
of Cal State Bakersfield at
Maples, where Tinkle set a career
high of 20 points, this was a Pac-12
conference game with a lot more
at stake. In that contest Van-
Derveer was happy to rest her
usual starters, which was not the
case on Saturday, when both the
Ogwumike sisters and Kokenis

spent substantial time on the hard
wood. In Tinkle's second-straight
start, she made a good case for
more by opening the scoring,
downing her first four shots and
making no mistakes from the
charity stripe.
In the face of some of the strug
gles during the road trip, Tinkle's
performance will have come as
some comfort to VanDerveer,
who will not want to have to rely

purely on her National Player of
the Year contender Nnemkadi
Ogwumike to capture the inaugu
ral Pac-12 title.
Stanford returns to campus
this week to face Washington
State on Thursday followed by
Washington on Saturday at
Maples Pavilion.

Junior forward Joslyn Tinkle scored a career-high 20 points to help the
No. 4 Stanford women's basketball team dispatch Colorado, 80-54,
in the first-ever meeting between the teams as conference foes.
Completing a road sweep of
the newly-added Pac-12 schools,
the Stanford women's basketball
team comfortably defeated Col
orado 80-54 last Saturday in Boul
der.

The No. 4 Cardinal (15-1, 6-0
Pac-12) started relatively slow
against the Lady Buffaloes (13-3,
2-3 Pac-12), and though Stanford
began the game with a nine-point
run, Colorado fought back to
within four midway through the
first half. However, that was the
closest the Lady Buffs would get,
and by the break the Card led 32-
15. Stanford then returned for the
second period with an 11-3 run
that all but killed the contest even
though there was still 16:56 re
maining.

Four of Stanford's starters
senior forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike, her sister sophomore for
ward Chiney, junior forward
Joslyn Tinkle and sophomore
guard Toni Kokenis reached
double-figure point totals, led by
Tinkle, who tied her career record
of 20. The shooting performance
of these players was in high con
trast to the struggles against Utah
in Salt Lake City and also to the
rest of the team. The overall field
goal percentage only increased a
small amount from the 43.3 per
cent against the Utes to 50 percent
in this game, but considering just
these four starters, the jump was
substantial. In Utah the shooting
accuracy was roughly the same
across the team, but in Colorado
these four hit 66.7 percent com
pared to just 15.8 percent from the
other players.
In contrast, though Colorado
shared the scoring responsibility
much more equally, its starters

only managed a combined 18
points between them. Critically
this included the Lady Buffs' two
statistically best players, junior
guard Chucky Jeffery and fresh
man guard Lexy Kresl. They came
into the contest averaging 17.2
and 10.8 points per game and left
with just two and three points, re
spectively, as each shot l-for-10.
