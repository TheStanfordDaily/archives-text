score of 23-17. The Card is now 6-5

Saturday's dual against Cal Poly
was highlighted by the match be

t ween No. 1 Amuchastegui and No.
3 Ryan Desßoches of Cal Poly at
174 pounds. Desßoches has placed
multiple times at the NCAA Tour
nament, and Amuchastegui fin
ished second at the NCAAs last
season. Going into the match,
many anticipated that it would be
extremely close, but Amuchastegui
dominated Desßoches, winning 8-
0 and registering a major decision
for the Cardinal.

The top-ranked wrestler dominat
ed in every facet of the match. He

recorded three takedowns from
the neutral position, escaped once
from bottom and didn't let up on
top, recording over three and a half
minutes of riding time.
Amuchastegui is now 14-0 overall
and 11-0 in duals.

The other winning wrestlers for

Stanford were No. 9 Mango by pin
at 133 pounds, sophomore Garrett
Scherer by major decision at 157
pounds, redshirt sophomore Bret
Baumbach at 165 pounds, redshirt
junior Spence Patrick at 184
pounds and sophomore Dan
Scherer at heavyweight.
Mango's win puts him at 16-8

in the Pac-12 and NCAA Tourna
ments.

Both Patrick and Scherer won
in overtime. Patrick's match was
very hard-fought, and it was his
ability to wrestle well on the mat
that led to his win. After three pe
riods he was down by one, but be
cause he had over a minute of rid
ing time, the match was sent into
overtime. Neither he nor his oppo
nent scored in the first overtime
period, but in the next period
Patrick secured a reversal to win
the match.
Scherer's match was won with
his ability to wrestle well on his
feet. Going into overtime, Scherer
and his opponent were tied at one,
but as time expired in the first
overtime, Scherer took his oppo
nent down to win the match by
two. Scherer has quietly put to
gether an extremely successful
season. He is 16-8 overall and 9-2
in duals. The sophomore has not
been ranked, but he has definitely
become a wrestler to watch in the
Pac-12. He might be a sleeper in
postseason tournaments.
This win is huge for the team's
confidence. The team has been
wrestling well lately, but the Car
dinal came into this dual off a loss
to American last weekend. This
match validates the team's hard
work and improvement through
out the season. The Card wrestled
well in all phases top, bottom
and neutral. And most important
ly, the team put together a com
plete match, both individually and
as a whole. Each wrestler fought
through the whistle, and everyone
came out ready to fight hard.

Sunday's win ensures that
Stanford will have a winning
record in Pac-12 duals. The Cardi
nal has one more Pac-12 match
Oregon State at home on Jan. 29.
So far the team has been very suc
cessful in the Pac-12, which bodes
well for the Pac-12 Tournament in
late February.
On Friday, Stanford will travel
to San Francisco to take on the
San Francisco State Gators at 7
p.m.

wrestling well lately, but the Car
dinal came into this dual off a loss
to American last weekend. This
match validates the team's hard
work and improvement through
out the season. The Card wrestled
well in all phases top, bottom
and neutral. And most important
ly, the team put together a com
plete match, both individually and
as a whole. Each wrestler fought
through the whistle, and everyone
came out ready to fight hard.

Sunday's win ensures that
Stanford will have a winning
record in Pac-12 duals. The Cardi
nal has one more Pac-12 match
Oregon State at home on Jan. 29.
So far the team has been very suc
cessful in the Pac-12, which bodes
well for the Pac-12 Tournament in
late February.
On Friday, Stanford will travel
to San Francisco to take on the
San Francisco State Gators at 7
p.m.
