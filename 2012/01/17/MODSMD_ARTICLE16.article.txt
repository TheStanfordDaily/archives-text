# Griner to NBA? Intriguing
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Struggling to find any ex
cuse not to work on my
first problem set of the
year, I flicked on the TV
on Sunday in time for the
women's basketball matchup be
tween No.l Baylor and unranked
Texas. It is hard to say it was a
thrilling game the Longhorns
were clearly outmatched but it
was intriguing to watch junior Bay
lor forward Brittney Griner.
Listening to the commentary
felt a little like watching a Stanford
football game on TV this last year,
but with the TV pundits drooling
over Griner's abilities instead of
those of Stanford's redshirt junior
quarterback Andrew Luck. What
ever you might know about Griner
and I admit I don't know that
much she is impressive. She is
the hot favorite to win National
Player of the Year, is already on the
USA Basketball roster after play
ing on its European tour last year,
stands at 6-foot-8 and has recorded
five dunks so far in her collegiate
career. Just like many expected of
Luck a year ago, there is a belief that
she may leave school early in the
pursuit of professional riches,
though in contrast to football this is
unusual in women's basketball.
Some have even wondered
whether she could be the first
woman to break into the NBA.
She seems to have at least some
of the qualities that would require
watching her towering over the
other players in the game on Sunday,
she looked out of place, in a good
way but I will freely admit that I
don't know enough about the differ
ences between women's and men's
basketball to really wade into that
debate. What I do wonder, though, is
whether she'd really want to.
Griner seems guaranteed to
have a long and successful career in
the WNBA, almost without need
ing to try. In comparison, the risks
would be incredibly high for any
woman player, even an outstanding
one, making a bid for the NBA.
Even the best college players some
times don't make it at the profes
sional level, and should she try and
fail, it would be a painful experi
ence. On pure height alone, Griner
would no longer stand out in the
NBA, and her ability to dunk
wouldn't be anything particularly
special. That doesn't mean she
wouldn't be able to stand up and
fight for her place, but just that
many of the advantages she is used
to would be gone.
A lot of Stanford students prob
ably come here after finishing first,
or near first, in their high school
class, but only a handful of them get
to claim that honor at the Farm.
Having lived your life at the top,
finding you are suddenly consid
ered average, or even below aver
age, can come off as a bit of a shock
even if being average at Stanford
still ranks you pretty high in general.
And then there is the specter of
sexism: real, imagined or inferred. It
is hard to believe there wouldn't be
some in the NBA who would be
against women players joining, and
others that would be wary of draw
ing negative attention by crossing
that line. Any team that drafted a
woman would also be under extra
pressure to either succeed or fail,
because the media always needs a
story.

It took a long time before the
first black driver, Lewis Hamilton,
entered Formula 1, in 2007. Partly
this was a case of fewer black kids
trying their hand at racing cars, but
the extra pressure on the first of his
kind can't be neglected. The media
seized on the story, and Hamilton
was perhaps under greater scrutiny
in his first few races than any other
driver, ever. Should he have failed,
or even just not been especially
good, it would have hurt the image
of equality in Fl. As it turned out,
while he might sometimes be diffi
cult to love, he proved himself to be
exceptionally talented.
Joining the NBA and simply
being average should be considered
a success for anyone; only a very
few can even cut it at that level, so
not becoming a team's star player is
no failure. However, simply be
cause of the story she'd create,
Griner might not be given that ben
efit. Anything but success might be
considered failure.

But after all this, the best thing
about the top athletes is that they
never really know when to give up.
They want to play at the top level
and beat the best because they have
maximum faith in their abilities. If
Griner could make it in the NBA,
she would seal her place in history.
So, in face of all the risk, the dangers

and the possible drawbacks, if the
NBA came knocking, it might be an
offer too good to resist.

Tom Taylor actually went through
a comparison of the NBA and
WNBA without any mention of the
vast differences in money and pop
ularity. Let him know how that will
factor in at tom.taylor@stanford.

ence. On pure height alone, Griner
would no longer stand out in the
NBA, and her ability to dunk
wouldn't be anything particularly
special. That doesn't mean she
wouldn't be able to stand up and
fight for her place, but just that
many of the advantages she is used
to would be gone.
A lot of Stanford students prob
ably come here after finishing first,
or near first, in their high school
class, but only a handful of them get
to claim that honor at the Farm.
Having lived your life at the top,
finding you are suddenly consid
ered average, or even below aver
age, can come off as a bit of a shock
even if being average at Stanford
still ranks you pretty high in general.
And then there is the specter of
sexism: real, imagined or inferred. It
is hard to believe there wouldn't be
some in the NBA who would be
against women players joining, and
others that would be wary of draw
ing negative attention by crossing
that line. Any team that drafted a
woman would also be under extra
pressure to either succeed or fail,
because the media always needs a
story.

It took a long time before the
first black driver, Lewis Hamilton,
entered Formula 1, in 2007. Partly
this was a case of fewer black kids
trying their hand at racing cars, but
the extra pressure on the first of his
kind can't be neglected. The media
seized on the story, and Hamilton
was perhaps under greater scrutiny
in his first few races than any other
driver, ever. Should he have failed,
or even just not been especially
good, it would have hurt the image
of equality in Fl. As it turned out,
while he might sometimes be diffi
cult to love, he proved himself to be
exceptionally talented.
Joining the NBA and simply
being average should be considered
a success for anyone; only a very
few can even cut it at that level, so
not becoming a team's star player is
no failure. However, simply be
cause of the story she'd create,
Griner might not be given that ben
efit. Anything but success might be
considered failure.

But after all this, the best thing
about the top athletes is that they
never really know when to give up.
They want to play at the top level
and beat the best because they have
maximum faith in their abilities. If
Griner could make it in the NBA,
she would seal her place in history.
So, in face of all the risk, the dangers

and the possible drawbacks, if the
NBA came knocking, it might be an
offer too good to resist.

Tom Taylor actually went through
a comparison of the NBA and
WNBA without any mention of the
vast differences in money and pop

Struggling to find any ex
cuse not to work on my
first problem set of the
year, I flicked on the TV
on Sunday in time for the
women's basketball matchup be
tween No.l Baylor and unranked
Texas. It is hard to say it was a
thrilling game the Longhorns
were clearly outmatched but it
was intriguing to watch junior Bay
lor forward Brittney Griner.
Listening to the commentary
felt a little like watching a Stanford
football game on TV this last year,
but with the TV pundits drooling
over Griner's abilities instead of
those of Stanford's redshirt junior
quarterback Andrew Luck. What
ever you might know about Griner
and I admit I don't know that
much she is impressive. She is
the hot favorite to win National
Player of the Year, is already on the
USA Basketball roster after play
ing on its European tour last year,
stands at 6-foot-8 and has recorded
five dunks so far in her collegiate
career. Just like many expected of
Luck a year ago, there is a belief that
she may leave school early in the
pursuit of professional riches,
though in contrast to football this is
unusual in women's basketball.
Some have even wondered
whether she could be the first
woman to break into the NBA.
She seems to have at least some
of the qualities that would require
watching her towering over the
other players in the game on Sunday,
she looked out of place, in a good
way but I will freely admit that I
don't know enough about the differ
ences between women's and men's
basketball to really wade into that
debate. What I do wonder, though, is
whether she'd really want to.
Griner seems guaranteed to
have a long and successful career in
the WNBA, almost without need
ing to try. In comparison, the risks
would be incredibly high for any
woman player, even an outstanding
one, making a bid for the NBA.
Even the best college players some
times don't make it at the profes
sional level, and should she try and
fail, it would be a painful experi
ence. On pure height alone, Griner
would no longer stand out in the
NBA, and her ability to dunk
wouldn't be anything particularly
special. That doesn't mean she
wouldn't be able to stand up and
fight for her place, but just that
many of the advantages she is used
