# RECORD SETTERS
## 
### DANIEL LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
An exciting weekend for the
Stanford men's volleyball team fea
turing the collegiate debuts of sever
al team members, new career-highs
and a record-setting performance all
distracts the observer from the most
important statistic regarding the
team's matches: 2-0. As in two wins
and no losses for the fourth-ranked
Cardinal (3-0), following successful
matches against Juniata (1-1) and
No. 14 Loyola-Chicago (2-4).

The team's home opener pitted
the Cardinal against Div. 11l Juniata,
with the Cardinal prevailing in four
sets,2s-13,20-25,25-14,25-14.Junior
outside hitter Jake Kneller set a ca
reer high with 10 kills, and sopho
more outside hitter Brian Cook
matched him, pacing a sizzling Stan
ford attack that as a team hit .515 for
the match.The performance was the
third-highest percentage in school
history during the rally-scoring era.
While the team played 14 of the
20 players on the roster and fea
tured the collegiate debuts of red
shirt freshmen Daniel Tublin,
Grant Delgado and Scott "Scoot
er" Sakaida, the first set belonged
to the old guard, as All-American
senior outside hitter Brad Lawson
had six kills on six attempts. His
classmate, middle blocker Gus
Ellis, also contributed three kills in
the set during which the Cardinal
jumped out to an early 6-2 lead and
never looked back. The run fea
tured three kills and a service ace
by Lawson, as well as a kill by Ellis.
Sophomore outside hitter Steven
Irvin contributed three kills and two
aces during the set.
Head coach John Kosty experi
mented much more with his lineup
during the second set, sitting Law
son, Cook and starting sophomore
middle blocker Eric Mochalski
(who didn't play in the first set ei
ther) in favor of Kneller, senior out
side hitter Jake Vandermeer and
redshirt senior middle blocker
Charley Henrikson. Juniata took
advantage of the opportunity
against Stanford's bench players,

using runs of 6-2 and 7-3 to close out
the Cardinal, 25-20. Ben Wolff, who
finished with five kills in the set,
paced Juniata.
Kosty was more conventional
with his lineup in the third set, bring
ing back Mochalski and Cook. It
showed, as the Cardinal opened the
set on a 10-4 run, largely on the
strength of play by Cook and
Mochalski, who combined for five
kills during the run. The two would
finish with 11 kills in the set. Delga
do and Tublin registered the first ace
and first kill of their respective colle
giate careers during the set.
"It is so fun to see my classmates
have the successes they have been
having. We are all really good
friends and have been working hard
together since we got here, so to get
to play together on the court is a
thrill," Mochalski said.
Tublin and Mochalski led the
Cardinal attack in the fourth set
with four kills each as the Cardinal
finished the match with another set
score of 25-14.
Not to be lost in the parade of
Stanford attackers was senior setter
Evan Barry, who turned in a flawless
51-assist performance.
Having an entire year of starting
experience under his belt has been
an obvious boost for Barry.
"It's been a big impact for me, es
pecially coming in replacing such a
great setter [in former setter Kawika
Shoji]. Having a whole year has def
initely improved my confidence, as
well as the sophomores having de
veloped further," he said.
That they have, and it continued
to show on Saturday during a
record-setting performance against
Loyola, in which Mochalski set a
Stanford record for hitting percent
age in a single match. He finished
with 10 kills and no errors in 12 at
tempts. In addition, Cook continued
to lead the team in kills, registering
12. While the focus of the match may
have been on those two, they were
quick to deflect the praise onto their
teammates.

"The record took a team effort. I
may get the credit, but I am nothing
without the play of my teammates.
The passers were lights out. The ball
control was tremendous and Barry
was setting so well that it all came to
gether," Mochalski said.

"Barry is doing a great job run
ning the offense, [senior libero Erik]

Shoji is killing it on defense and most
importantly we have twenty guys
bringing it every day in practice,"
Cook said.

The Cardinal won in straight sets,
25-19, 25-11, 25-21, winning its sec
ond match of the young season over
a ranked opponent. Not to be lost in
the parade of sophomores were
Stanford's seniors, particularly Law
son, Shoji and Barry.
Lawson, who is no stranger to
high-percentage hitting perform
ances himself, most notably his 24-
kill, 28-attempt performance in the
2010 national championship, fin
ished with 11 kills at a .476 clip. Shoji
was solid as always, registering eight
digs from his libero position, and
perhaps most impressive of them all

may have been Barry, who finished
with 39 assists and played a large role
in Mochalski's, and the team's, per
formance.

"It's your role [as a setter] to help
other people have good games. I'm
proud that he was able to accom
plish that, and I'm definitely not
going to take that away from him.
Having someone as athletic and as
good as him only makes my job eas
ier," Barry said.

The Cardinal begins the first
match of its 10-match road swing on
Friday at UCLA. The team does not
return home until a Feb. 24 date with
Pepperdine.
