# DIVING
## Card dominates own invitational 
### GEORGE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal men's and
women's divers opened up the
competition season with a domi
nating performance at their own
three-day Cardinal Invitational
this past weekend. Freshman
Kristian Ipsen and sophomore
Stephanie Phipps led the way for
Stanford by sweeping their re
spective 1-meter and 3-meter
springboard events. Senior cap
tain Taylor Sishc also won the
men's platform event on Sunday.
Ipsen's final score of 420.75 in
the 1-meter springboard put him
90 points ahead of freshman
teammate Connor Kuremsky. In
the 3-meter event, Ipsen won by
an even greater margin, finishing
with a score of 455.80,110 points
ahead of sophomore teammate
Noah Garcia.
"I was trying some new dives
on the springboard," Ipsen said.
"Overall, I was happy with my
performance. It's nice to get into
the competition part of the diving
season. And I feel like our team as
a whole did really well."
Part of the reason for Ipsen's
large margins of victory is his abil
ity to perform difficult dives that
no other divers can execute. The

degree of difficulty of his dives at
the invite reached up to 3.50,
whereas other divers performed
dives that were in the 3.0 degree
of-difficulty range.
Phipps mirrored Ipsen's wins
with two victories of her own on
the springboard. On Friday,
Phipps held off Cal's Molly Hayes
in the 3-meter with a score of
321.80. The next day, Phipps an
Ail-American as a freshman last
year beat her Cal opponent
again, this time in the 1-meter
with a score of 294.20.
"I was pretty happy with the
meet," Phillips said. "I'm focusing
on learning how to compete, so
that's what I was trying to do this
weekend. At this point of the sea
son, I want to focus on getting into
competition mode and doing at
meets what I do in practice."
The invitational concluded on
Sunday afternoon with the plat
form event. Sishc overtook Cal's
Tyler Pullen on the third dive and
would go on to win with a score of
346.30,50 points ahead of second
place finisher Pullen.

Sishc, the men's diving captain,
pointed out, "I was pleased with
the result overall, but there are a
couple dives that I need to get bet
ter at. As a team, [head coach Rick
Schavone] is really pleased with
us right now, and we're just com
ing back from winter training. But
we still have a long time to go.
There are still a lot of things to
work on."

Schavone agreed that there are
certain aspects that the team can
improve on. "We definitely need
to work more on the platform," he
said. "We're going to go back to
heavy training and re-emphasize
platform. We still have a lot to do,
and we're going to start at 7:30 to
morrow morning." Even two-time
winner Ipsen stated that he need
ed to "work on cleaner entries" in
his dives.
As a team, the Cardinal divers
won five of the six events compet
ed this past weekend. In most of
the events, Stanford dominated
the field. In the men's 3-meter
springboard, for instance, the top
six finishers were all Cardinal
divers.

"It's just the middle of the
season, so the meet results aren't
that important right now,"
Schavone said. "We just came
back from heavy training, and the
divers are pretty torn up. We're
diving well for this time of the
year. The meet showed us that

we're heading in the right direc
tion, especially on the spring
board. We're going to work more
on platform, but stick with what
we've been doing on spring
board."

The Cardinal divers will pre
pare next for a competition-filled
month that includes important
dual meets against Pac-12 teams
including Arizona State, Arizona,
USC and Cal. The divers' next
matchup will be against Arizona
State at home on Friday.

"Overall, I was happy with my
performance. It's nice to get into
the competition part of the diving
season. And I feel like our team as
a whole did really well."
Part of the reason for Ipsen's
large margins of victory is his abil
ity to perform difficult dives that
no other divers can execute. The

degree of difficulty of his dives at
the invite reached up to 3.50,
whereas other divers performed
dives that were in the 3.0 degree
of-difficulty range.
Phipps mirrored Ipsen's wins
with two victories of her own on
the springboard. On Friday,
Phipps held off Cal's Molly Hayes
in the 3-meter with a score of
321.80. The next day, Phipps an
Ail-American as a freshman last
year beat her Cal opponent
again, this time in the 1-meter
with a score of 294.20.
"I was pretty happy with the
meet," Phillips said. "I'm focusing
on learning how to compete, so
that's what I was trying to do this
weekend. At this point of the sea
son, I want to focus on getting into
competition mode and doing at
meets what I do in practice."
The invitational concluded on
Sunday afternoon with the plat
form event. Sishc overtook Cal's
Tyler Pullen on the third dive and
would go on to win with a score of
346.30,50 points ahead of second
place finisher Pullen.

Sishc, the men's diving captain,
pointed out, "I was pleased with
the result overall, but there are a
couple dives that I need to get bet
ter at. As a team, [head coach Rick
Schavone] is really pleased with
us right now, and we're just com
ing back from winter training. But
we still have a long time to go.
There are still a lot of things to
work on."

Schavone agreed that there are
certain aspects that the team can
improve on. "We definitely need
to work more on the platform," he
said. "We're going to go back to
heavy training and re-emphasize
platform. We still have a lot to do,
and we're going to start at 7:30 to
morrow morning." Even two-time
winner Ipsen stated that he need
ed to "work on cleaner entries" in
his dives.
As a team, the Cardinal divers
won five of the six events compet
ed this past weekend. In most of
the events, Stanford dominated
the field. In the men's 3-meter
springboard, for instance, the top
six finishers were all Cardinal
divers.

"It's just the middle of the
season, so the meet results aren't
that important right now,"
Schavone said. "We just came
back from heavy training, and the
divers are pretty torn up. We're
diving well for this time of the
year. The meet showed us that

we're heading in the right direc
tion, especially on the spring
board. We're going to work more
on platform, but stick with what
we've been doing on spring
board."

The Cardinal divers will pre
pare next for a competition-filled
month that includes important
dual meets against Pac-12 teams
including Arizona State, Arizona,
USC and Cal. The divers' next
matchup will be against Arizona
State at home on Friday.
