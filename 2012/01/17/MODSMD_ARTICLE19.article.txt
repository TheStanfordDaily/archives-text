## Stanford alumnus Ryan Hall earns spot on U.S. Olympic team in marathon 
### 
Former Ail-American distance
runner Ryan Flail 'O5 secured a
spot in the 2012 Olympic Games
with a second-place finish at Sat
urday's U.S. Olympic Marathon
Trials in Flouston.

The pre-race favorite, Hall
pushed the pace early on the flat,
fast course, and a lead pack of
seven runners quickly broke away
from the rest of the field. But as
brisk winds swept the course, the
2008 Trials winner Hall was slowly
reeled in by the lead pack.
In the end, 2004 Olympic silver
medalist Meb Keflezighi won the
race by 22 seconds with a strong kick
past Hall, ultimately finishing in
2:09:08.

Three-time track Olympian
Abdi Abdirahman secured the
third spot and filled out the most
seasoned U.S. men's marathon
team ever, with an average age of
33 and multiple Olympic appear
ances among the three runners.

The 29-year old Hall ran the
fastest time ever for an American
at last year's Boston Marathon,
finishing the 26.2-mile race in
2:04:58. Known for going out fast,
Hall finished 10th at the 2008

Games in Beijing when he started
more conservatively and finished
in 2:12:33.
