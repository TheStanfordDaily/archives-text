## U.S. Rep outlines online bill Proposed law seeks to address Internet security threats 
### ANTHONY VASQUEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Friday, U.S. Representa
tive Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) out
lined the main points of a bill,
which if signed into law would re
quire the federal government and
private companies to share infor
mation about online threats.

Rogers, who is chairman of the
House Permanent Select Com
mittee on Intelligence, along with
Intel Chief Executive Paul Otelli
ni spoke with the media following
an invitation-only panel discus
sion. The event, titled "Leveraging
Private Sector Drive and Innova
tion to Improve U.S. Cybersecuri
ty," was organized by Stanford's
Center for International Security
and Cooperation (CISAC). In ad
dition to Rogers and Otellini,
members of the panel included
Stanford Law Professor and
CISAC co-director Mariano-Flo
rentino Cuellar, Representative
Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.), Vice
President for Security Engineer
ing at Google Eric Grosse, Ora
cle's Chief Corporate Architect
Edward Screven and Cisco's Secu
rity Group Leader Chris Young.
House Bill H.R. 3523, called
the Cyber Intelligence Sharing
and Protection Act of 2011, would
require the Director of National
Intelligence to create away for the
government to share information
about online threats with private
companies. The government
would also be required to encour
age private companies to share
their own information with the na
tional government. The bill, which
awaits a house vote later this year,
comes on the heels of reports of
cyber hacking originating from
outside the United States against
U.S. government computers in
cluding the Pentagon's.
"The intelligence community
believes strongly that it's just a
matter of time before we have a
catastrophic cyber attack," Rogers
said. "We have admired this prob
lem for a very long time, and it is
time to do something."
Otellini said he supports the
law because it is easy to carry out
and will improve the online securi
ty environment, which also now
includes cellular phones.
"It's a great first step; it's very
implementable," Otellini said. "It
simply says the government has
information. They can share it
with private industry privately. We
can take advantage of that to im
prove our products and protect
our customers."

Rogers said the passage of this
law would not allow for govern
ment officials to legally look for
personal information.
"The language that we
strengthened was to say that this
information can only be used for
national security purposes," he
added. "Nobody can go phishing.
You can't have an IRS agent going
in and saying, 'Gee, we'd like to
find out if somebody hasn't been
paying their taxes.' All of that can
