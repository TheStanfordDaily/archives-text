In a rare occurrence, Stan
ford's women's soccer coach Paul
Ratcliffe and new men's coach Je
remy Gunn were each named Na
tional Coach of the Year by the
National Soccer Coaches Associ
ation of America on Friday.
It was the second award for
Gunn, who spent the last five sea
sons with the Charlotte 49ers and
took over the Stanford men's
program on Dec. 21 after the res
ignation of Bret Simon in No
vember. His 49ers fell to North
Carolina in this year's men's title
match.
Ratcliffe, who led the Cardinal to
a 25-0-1 record and the program's
first national title this season, is now
a three-time award winner with all
three honors coming during Stan
ford's four-year stretch of domi
nance in the sport. Over those four
years, the Cardinal was 95-4-4
including 53-0-1 at home with
appearances in the NCAA College
Cup in each of those seasons.
