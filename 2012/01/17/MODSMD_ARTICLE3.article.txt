# Ice-rink proposal advances
## Club ice hockey team spearheads a proposal for an on-campus rink 
### MARSHALL WATKINS STAFF WRITER 
Plans for the construction of an on-campus
ice rink facility have continued to progress, with
fundraising for a feasibility study of the propos
al currently ongoing.

The proposal, which has been spearheaded
by the University's club ice hockey team, envi
sions the construction of a facility incorporating
multiple sheets of ice as well as storage and
training space for other sports and recreational
opportunities for the student body. The pro
posed rink would likely take at least four years
to construct once approved, according to Jack
Werner 'l4, a member of the club ice hockey
team.

Ice hockey team members emphasized the
importance of the proposed facility for the pro
gram's future success. Team members currently
travel to Redwood City twice a week for mid
night practices, which has forced some mem
bers to withdraw from the team and resulted in
an ongoing struggle to consistently field a team.

Werner said that the rink's construction
would benefit the program by making Stanford
more appealing to recruits, noting that the Uni
versity is currently disadvantaged by the lack of
dedicated rink facilities, especially when com
pared to rival schools on the East Coast. The
convenience of an on-campus rink and the en
hanced quality of the team, would also boost fan
attendance, he added.

"The rink would integrate the team into the
student body and would raise awareness of the
team on campus," said James Dudley 'lO M.S. 'll.

The rink facility, which could cost as much as
$2O million depending on the building's com
plexity and number of ice sheets, would be fund
ed entirely by alumni. Dudley noted the enthu
siasm of hockey alumni for the project, noting
that the $25,000 required for the University fea
sibility study had been raised from alumni
pledges within a day. Alumni have also offered
assistance with the rink's design and construc
tion.

The proposal notes that opening the facility
up to the local community may also allow the fa
cility to break even financially.

Obstacles to the proposal's approval include
the feasibility study as well as the large physical
and environmental footprint created by the
rink. The proposal seeks to maximize the green
potential of the facility by the inclusion of envi
ronmentally friendly technology which,
Werner noted, would generate positive publici
ty for the University and provide an opportuni
ty for field-testing by Stanford laboratories.

The rink's construction would also be com
plicated by University land usage rules. Stan
ford's general usage permit established with
Santa Clara County limits the University's
ability to develop acreage and may necessitate
trade-offs with other construction projects.
According to Werner, the Stanford Athletics
Department has emphasized the need for the
project to benefit the entirety of the University
community. Werner commented that the con
cept has been met with generally positive feed
back from University administrators. The pro
posal emphasizes the significance of the facili
ty's availability to students as providing a place
for students to gather and socialize with a non
alcoholic context.

Werner noted that the rink's potential West
Campus location, and the construction of a new
gym nearby, might transform West Campus into
a campus hub.

"Stanford has a lot of outdoor recreation op
portunities, but very limited indoor opportuni
ties," Werner said. "Between all the different
athletic events people can do, students seem re
ally happy and intrigued by the proposal."
The proposed rink would also directly bene
fit other winter sport athletes at Stanford, such
as Olympian figure skater Rachael Flatt 'l5.
Flatt, who currently commutes to San Jose and
Oakland for twice-daily practices, noted that
the lack of world-class facilities near campus
had necessitated an exhausting schedule, Flatt
also asserted that the proposal would benefit
Stanford's skaters by averting the burnout com
monly induced by a lack of facilities and compe
tition opportunities.

"I think that we've got a great proposal,"
Dudley added. "And that there's a really strong
case for a rink. Hopefully, the University
agrees."

The proposal notes that opening the facility
up to the local community may also allow the fa
cility to break even financially.

Obstacles to the proposal's approval include
the feasibility study as well as the large physical
and environmental footprint created by the
rink. The proposal seeks to maximize the green
potential of the facility by the inclusion of envi
ronmentally friendly technology which,
Werner noted, would generate positive publici
ty for the University and provide an opportuni
ty for field-testing by Stanford laboratories.

The rink's construction would also be com
plicated by University land usage rules. Stan
ford's general usage permit established with
Santa Clara County limits the University's
ability to develop acreage and may necessitate
trade-offs with other construction projects.
According to Werner, the Stanford Athletics
Department has emphasized the need for the
project to benefit the entirety of the University
community. Werner commented that the con
cept has been met with generally positive feed
back from University administrators. The pro
posal emphasizes the significance of the facili
ty's availability to students as providing a place
for students to gather and socialize with a non
alcoholic context.

Werner noted that the rink's potential West
Campus location, and the construction of a new
gym nearby, might transform West Campus into
a campus hub.

"Stanford has a lot of outdoor recreation op
portunities, but very limited indoor opportuni
ties," Werner said. "Between all the different
athletic events people can do, students seem re
ally happy and intrigued by the proposal."
The proposed rink would also directly bene
fit other winter sport athletes at Stanford, such
as Olympian figure skater Rachael Flatt 'l5.
Flatt, who currently commutes to San Jose and
Oakland for twice-daily practices, noted that
the lack of world-class facilities near campus
had necessitated an exhausting schedule, Flatt
also asserted that the proposal would benefit
Stanford's skaters by averting the burnout com
monly induced by a lack of facilities and compe
tition opportunities.

"I think that we've got a great proposal,"
Dudley added. "And that there's a really strong
case for a rink. Hopefully, the University
agrees."

Stanford hockey alumni, such as members of the 1977-78 team seen here in Squaw Valley,
would completely fund the on-campus ice rink if approved. Land use plan is an obstacle.
