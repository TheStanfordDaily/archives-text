### JULIA ENTHOVEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the 25th anniversary of the national
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, institu
tions across Stanford organized events to
commemorate the life and works of this ex
traordinary national figure.
Last Friday, the Martin Luther King Jr.
Research and Education Institute hosted a
public King Holiday Celebration on the
second floor of Tresidder Memorial Union
to remember King's impact both on the
past and future. The event, with an audi
ence of around 100 people, included musi
cal performances, dramatic readings of
King's sermons, a documentary trailer and
an update on the King Institute's recent
work.

Among those in attendance were Bob
Fitch, a staff photographer for the South
ern Christian Leadership Conference,
King's activist organization; Ramzi Rabah,
who played King in a Palestinian theater
production and spoke about the nonvio
lence movement in West Jerusalem; and
Aleta Hayes 'Bl, a contemporary dancer

and lecturer whose father was the first
black male to attend the University of Mis
souri medical school.
Kadesia Woods 'l4, Jessica Anderson
'l4 and Tyler Brooks 'l4, members of the
Chicago Collective, performed during the
program's reception.

make," Woods said when asked what the

take in all of these experiences, because
they wouldn't be possible without the work
of the Civil Rights Movement."
"It's just another marker of the privi
lege that we have of being students at Stan
ford," Anderson added. "And appreciating
our blackness, but also appreciating every
thing [else]. Getting an opportunity to per
form, having a voice on a campus like this
it's a wonderful opportunity. Just being
able to think about Martin and his contri
bution and how we can be a part of that."
