# STUDENT LIFE
## Institute, students celebrate the life of MLK Jr. 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the 25th anniversary of the national
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, institu
tions across Stanford organized events to
commemorate the life and works of this ex
traordinary national figure.
Last Friday, the Martin Luther King Jr.
Research and Education Institute hosted a
public King Holiday Celebration on the
second floor of Tresidder Memorial Union
to remember King's impact both on the
past and future. The event, with an audi
ence of around 100 people, included musi
cal performances, dramatic readings of
King's sermons, a documentary trailer and
an update on the King Institute's recent
work.

Among those in attendance were Bob
Fitch, a staff photographer for the South
ern Christian Leadership Conference,
King's activist organization; Ramzi Rabah,
who played King in a Palestinian theater
production and spoke about the nonvio
lence movement in West Jerusalem; and
Aleta Hayes 'Bl, a contemporary dancer

and lecturer whose father was the first
black male to attend the University of Mis
souri medical school.
Kadesia Woods 'l4, Jessica Anderson
'l4 and Tyler Brooks 'l4, members of the
Chicago Collective, performed during the
program's reception.
"It just reminds me to be really grateful
for the things that he did ... we are the em
bodiment of the changes that he wanted to
make," Woods said when asked what the
day meant to her. "It reminds you to really
take in all of these experiences, because
they wouldn't be possible without the work
of the Civil Rights Movement."
"It's just another marker of the privi
lege that we have of being students at Stan
ford," Anderson added. "And appreciating
our blackness, but also appreciating every
thing [else]. Getting an opportunity to per
form, having a voice on a campus like this
it's a wonderful opportunity. Just being
able to think about Martin and his contri
bution and how we can be a part of that."

The King Institute
"I think he was a great symbol of the


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
movement," said Clayborne Car
son, professor of history, about the
importance of King.
Coretta Scott King selected
Carson in 1985 to lead the King Pa
pers Project, responsible for edit
ing and publishing all of her late
husband's writings. Carson also di
rects the organization that hosted
Friday's party, the King Institute,
which is a body that seeks to keep
King's message of non-violence
alive around the world.

"I would not say that the move
ment would not have happened if
King had not been born, but he
was certainly the person who best
expressed its long-term vision,"

Carson said. "He linked our strug
gle to traditional American ideas
of democracy and justice . . .
When he spoke at the march on
Washington, he didn't just say,
'Let's pass a civil rights bill.' He
said, 'We're fighting for the ideal
of democracy.'"
Carson expressed pride in the
Institute's work to spread King's
message in 2011, which saw the
opening and dedication of the
Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial
in Washington D.C., a multi-year
project which he helped orches
trate.

The King Institute also staged a
reinterpretation of the play "Pas
sages of Martin Luther King" with
the Palestinian National Theater as
part of their recent goal to "take
Martin Luther King to [other]
part[s] of the world where ... his
message is very vitally needed," ac

cording to Carson.
Last year, the Institute also or
ganized for the play to be per
formed in Beijing.
"The fact that we were able to
do the play with scenes dramatiz
ing the protests in Birmingham...
a mile from Tiananmen Square was
to me a testament to the power of
Martin Luther King's message,"
Carson said.
Celebrating King
Other celebrations include the
annual Martin Luther King Jr.-
themed dinner that will be hosted
by Stanford Dining tonight, featur
ing dishes like Creole gumbo and
jambalaya. A red banner reading
"Stanford Remembers Martin
Luther King, Jr.," festooning the
palm trees at the start of Palm
Drive, will stay up all this week.
The University Public Worship

services at the Memorial Church
both last Sunday and this upcom
ing Sunday are dedicated to King.
The a cappella group Talisman will
perform at next week's morning
program, a multifaith celebration
organized by the student group
Faiths Act in Togetherness and
Hope (F.A.I.T.H).
Last Sunday's service, hosted
by the Office for Religious Life,
featured a sermon by Bishop
Yvette Flunder, founder and sen
ior pastor of City of Refuge Unit
ed Church of Christ, a "radically
inclusive" Christian ministry in
San Francisco.

"Love leads to action," she said
in a sermon written to align with
the King's values and beliefs. "Love
... is a do word. Love is the oxygen
of a movement for freedom. We
need love, but we need love that
does something."

Student reception
Although both the MLK Cele
bration and Worship Service were

well attended, Carson said he
wished 100 more students had
come to the Friday Celebration.
"I do believe that we're still
cognizant of the day [and] recog
nize it," Anderson said. "But I feel
like there is a lot more room for
development, thinking about it
and actually having events on
campus."
Woods, who works for the
Black Community Service Center
on campus, said that despite what
she perceives as a lack of enthusi
asm in recent years, she believes
Stanford is shifting.
"More is being done," Woods
said. "I know that the MLK Insti
tute ... [is] actually partnering up
with more groups and are trying to
do more tours of the Institute be
cause how many people have actu
ally visited?"
"People are doing more, but it's
going to take a while," she added.
