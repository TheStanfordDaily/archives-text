## Stanford receives almost 37,000 applications for the Class of 2016 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€”Kurt Chirbas 
Almost 37,000 high school students ap
plied to join the Stanford Class of 2016, form
ing the largest applicant pool in the Universi
ty's history.

The Office of Undergraduate Admissions
received a total of 36,744 freshman applica-

tions by the University's final Jan. 1 deadline,
which represents a 7-percent rise from last
year when the University received a previ
ously record-breaking 34,348 applications for
the Class of 2015. Around 32,000 students ap
plied for the Class of 2014, and approximate
ly 30,000 for the Class of 2013.

Bob Patterson, Stanford director of admis
sions, told Bloomberg News that Stanford
had expected lower applicant numbers this
admission cycle because of the reinstatement
of early admission at Harvard University and
Princeton University. He also added that suc
cess of the school's athletic department,
which included the Cardinal football team

appearing in the Fiesta Bowl, might have bol
stered the numbers.

"It's a little more than we anticipated,"
Patterson told Bloomberg. "Stanford did very
well in football, and Andrew Luck was a
leader for the University."

Of this applicant pool, 5,880 students ap
plied under the single-choice early action pro
gram and have already received their admis
sion decision. This number was slightly lower
from the Class of 2015, which saw 5,959 stu
dents apply early action.

Harvard and Princeton, which returned to
offering early action admission this year, re
ceived 4,245 and 3,547 applications under

their programs, respectively. Yale University
received 4,310 applications for early action
this year, down 18 percent from 5,257 last
year.

Final application numbers reflecting regu
lar decision numbers for these universities
have not been released. Last year, Harvard
received nearly 35,000 applications for the
Class of 2015, a record for the university.
On Dec. 9, Stanford admitted 755 students
who applied early action for the Class of 2016.
Last year, the University admitted 2,436 un
dergraduate students in total, 96 more stu
dents than admitted in 2010.
