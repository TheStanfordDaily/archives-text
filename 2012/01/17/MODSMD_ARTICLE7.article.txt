## PROFILE Stanford grad's hot wheels 
### SHIRLEY YARIN 
With over 10,000 minds,
many often lost in thought
(and others merely lost),
crisscrossing over its cam
pus, Stanford is a place
where dozens of collisions occur each day.
The majority of those impacts are of the
bike-vs.-fixed-object or other bike variety;
the Revolight, however, was born from the
collision of bikes and an innovating mind.

A brainchild of Kent Frankovich M.S.
'lO, Revolights are LED lighting systems
that connect to the bike's wheels, producing
a white light on the front half of the bike and
a red light on the back, which allow bikers to
see more clearly and increase their visibili
ty. The idea for the lighting system struck
Frankovich while he was completing his
master's degree in mechanical engineering
at Stanford, when he noticed the shortcom
ings of his traditional, handlebar-mounted
light, which pointed ahead but did not offer
the rider much visibility from the side.
Although California law requires all cy
clists to use a light visible at a distance of
300 feet in front during nighttime, biking in
poorly lit conditions remains dangerous
and sometimes fatal. According to the Na
tional Center for Statistics and Analysis
(NCSA), 39 percent of fatalities from re
ported bicycle accidents in 2008 occurred
between 5 p.m. and midnight. This statistic
hit especially close to home two years ago
when visiting Ph.D. student Yichao Wang
died in 2010 after being struck by a car at
the dark intersection of Palm Drive and
Museum Way.
The NCSA report also found that near
ly 70 percent of nighttime bicycle collisions
were due to inadequate side visibility, a
problem that the Revolight team strives to
prevent with its new system. The current
public prototype features a white front
light and red rear light, which mimics the
lights on most motorized vehicles.
"The Revolight lighting system serves as
a unique identifier for bicycles and their di
rection," said Jim Houk, another member
of the production team.
The team's images of the system's latest
prototypes reveal a bike outfitted to look
like a cousin of Tron's Lightcycle. Each
wheel's lighting system consists of 12 LED
lights connected to a wire, which is then at
tached to the wheel using six clips. The
lights are powered by polymer lithium-ion
batteries, which last for about four hours
and recharge using a USB, Houk said.
Since debuting their project on Kick

starter, the crowd-funding website, early
last summer, the team has raised nearly five
times its initial goal of $43,500 in startup
capital, thanks to a pool of over 1,400 back
ers. Today, Frankovich builds the circuits
for the Revolight in his own apartment.

Frankovich credited Stanford with nur
turing his inborn love of tinkering.
"When I was younger, I would go to a
hardware store to buy things I could cut up
and drill to make into go-cart parts,"
Frankovich said. "I always had the motiva
tion to design, but Stanford gave me the
skills I really wanted to make them better."
Currently, the production team is work
ing on its sixth prototype. In the latest ver
sion, Frankovich added an accelerometer
to make the back wheel a solid arc even
when the biker stops. This has been imple

mented in an effort to reduce criticism that
the Revolight might be distracting to other
drivers.

"People are always going to provide
feedback on potential negative features,
and as innovators we welcome and test
those concerns," Houk said. However, he
emphasized that "the concept of the Revo
light is not distracting, and its safety fea
tures far outweigh any such concerns."
In future prototypes, Kent and the rest
of the production team will try to make the
Revolight adaptable to more rim sizes.
Members of the team also want to make
the Revolight resilient to adverse weather
conditions.

The initial production batch will be di
rected toward the initial group of investors
who saw the potential in the design, Houk

said. The first batch of production, set on
March 2012, is expected to yield 900 Revo
light lighting systems.
However, because the production team
does not want to rely solely on its Kick
starter funds to design prototypes, it is
looking for more ways to raise capital.
"We have gotten feedback from many fu
ture applications including motorcycles,
wheelchairs and scooters," Frankovich said
when asked about tapping into new markets.
"We would love to get into other ver
sions of the Revolight, but we try not to
overstate our objection and remain as
transparent to consumers as possible,"
Houk said about the product's future.
