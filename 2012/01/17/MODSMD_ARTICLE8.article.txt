## Tackling the Cancer Center 
### LINDA YU 
To many, Douglas Blayney '72, the med
ical director of the Stanford Cancer
Center, is a hero. As his daughter used to
say when she was younger, "My dad can
save the lives of people who smoke cig
arettes."
He can do that and more, adopting a number of

leadership roles throughout his
career.
Blayney's position at the
Cancer Center has brought him
full circle back to the Farm. After
completing his undergraduate
studies and receiving a degree in
electrical engineering at Stan
ford, he worked in private prac
tice for 17 years as an oncologist
and hematologist, and later also

served as the medical director at the University of
Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center.
"It was one of the greatest days on Earth when
we recruited him from Michigan," said former Di
rector Irving Weissman M.D. '65, who currently
serves as a senior scientific advisor to the Cancer
Center. "He brings major leadership in the field of
breast cancer, and more important, professional
ism and vision in setting up the structures to do
clinical trials efficiently. Blayney is the one person
who knows exactly how to do it."
Blayney's vision for the Stanford Cancer Cen
ter includes delivering complex, coordinated care,
and he has already made numerous changes in the
first two years of his office. Focusing his efforts on
all aspects of patient care as well as patient em
powerment, he said that he has already increased
patient satisfaction scores and implemented
changes to EPIC, the medical center's electronic
medical record system. Now he is working on
quantifying the quality of care and measuring pa
tient satisfaction so the Center can more accurate
ly and appropriately provide needed cancer inter
ventions.
Blayney is also dedicated to increasing the effi
ciency of patient care, especially with the ever-in
creasing costs of treatment.
"As treatment is targeted to a smaller but better
identified segment of the population, it means that
the denominator over the cost of de velopment be
comes smaller, and the treatment per individual
becomes more expensive," he said. "We are getting
into ways of transforming cancer care delivery
through reducing waste and ineffective treatments
in order to make it more efficient."
Blayney's clear and systematic style is perhaps
a reflection of both his personality and his studies.

Though he entered Stanford knowing that he
wanted to be a doctor, he was also drawn to the
technical and problem-solving aspects of electrical
engineering.

"I studied EE because my father was an electri
cal engineer, so I grew up with it, was good at it and
found success in it," he said. "I liked its rigorous,
systematic approach to problems and understand
ing the parts of a system and how systems function
together."

His technical background has given him the
skills to think rigorously, synthesize problems and
communicate effectively, all of which he applies to
his medical work, he said.

"Every time I see a patient who has a difficult
diagnostic problem, we together decide on the
course of action," he said. "Afterward, I'm always
testing that course of action 'ls there anything
I'm missing here? Is there a quantitative way to
test the hypothesis of the diagnosis?'"
The challenging, problem-solving nature of on
cology was also a factor that lured him to the field.
"I enjoy dealing with cancer because it can af
fect so many of the body's different systems," he
said. "It posed a lot of mysteries physically and psy
chologically, which I enjoyed solving."
Blayney could see that at the time he entered
his medical profession cancer research was becom
ing more prevalent, which meant that more ad
vanced cancer interventions would be developed.
These would need to be tested, and Blayney was
enthusiastic about being a part of that testing, he
said.

According to Beverly Mitchell, the current di
rector of the Stanford Cancer Institute, Blayney's
passion for improving patient care quality shows
through in his work, and his leadership has helped
the Cancer Center become a more effective organ
ization.

"He's played a major role in bringing teams of
physicians together in delivering quality patient
care," she said. "He brings a blend of expertise; he
leads by example and he's not confrontational."
Although "he looks like a linebacker," Weis
mann said, and his presence and background com
mand attention, Weismann agreed with Mitchell's
description of Blayney's amicable personality.
"He doesn't force people to think his own way,"
Weismann said.

While Blayney studied at the Farm, he remem
bered "mildly quirky people at Stanford whose
reason for being here was to be excellent at what
they do and transmit that excellence to the next
generation." Back at Stanford, he too reflects the
excellence of his own generation.
