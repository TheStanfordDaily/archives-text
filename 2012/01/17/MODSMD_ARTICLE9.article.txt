## THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION Vulnerability 
### Nina Chung 
Sometimes, all we want in the
world from another person is a
nod reassurance that we
aren't alone. Sometimes, we just
want our thoughts received, ac
knowledged and echoed back to us
like they make sense and, yes, it's
okay. Normal. You're fine. I under
stand. For as much as communica
tion is about conveying informa
tion, it's about confirming what we
already think. This might explain
our impulse to latch onto, in first en
counters, "ME too!!!" or "I know,
right?!" like conversational
lifeboats. It's that initial connection
we constantly seek, even if we're
only at shallow shores of acquain
tance.

But if we move on into darker
waters, our distance from solid
ground grows alongside our own
vulnerability. At the point where
stranger turns into significant, trust
becomes crucial with all the added
self-exposure. It's no longer a class
or fave movie or play-day proximi
ty that locks in a long friendship
like it might have in grade school.
At 20-ish years of age, we've accu
mulated exclusive rights to our
most self-identifying thoughts
rights that we don't relinquish in
discriminately. Our biggest dreams,
family secrets, shameful mistakes
and lowest moments are not always
the flashy headlines we broadcast
in large group settings. They mean
more. And for that, it's what gives
us the chance to find those others
that know it all, and love us all the
more. Otherwise, what? ... Most
of us have felt it. Otherwise, we're
surrounded by crowds of people
with whom we talk, talk, talk ...
but have not a single clue about
who we are. This is loneliness at its
most ironic. It's loneliness at its
worst.

Many of us felt this freshman
year, when we first landed in a high
energy world of smiling people who
were similar in the most important
way: they were students at this
school. Maybe that was enough, for
a while. But there were many of us
who soon found ourselves pretend
ing and trying to remember what to
say to sound included for the sake of
being included. We began feeling
that contrast between the individu
ality we all "know" we support and
our instinctive fear of that moment
of social isolation. (Why else do we
keep so quiet in discussion sec
tions? ) So we kept up the cheer and
toned down the challenge, because
being effortlessly honest suddenly
became risky. Talking about our past
and ourselves wasn't exactly going
with the flow when conversations
had to be neutral territory. And the
result, from a bird's-eye view, was a

tangle of people each feeling alone
for the same , unspoken, unseen rea
sons. It's a strange social phenome
non when you think about it. But
I'm sure it's happening, always.
So what happens if we're too
open,maybe indiscriminately? Now
this might be the crux of the ever
lasting "girl/guy-friends" question.
Example scenario: she meets him
and opens up. So does he. They
laugh, they giggle, but it's not all
laughs and giggles: they talk. She
does the same with other friends. He
does not. And, starting from there,
an imbalance can begin where one
feels something in the relationship
that the other does not. This isn't a
formula, but rather a series of events
I've seen innumerable times. It per
suades me that letting someone in
can, well, really bnhgthemin.lt per
suades me that we respect and grav
itate to genuinely open hearts, even
if we're scared of opening our own.
Finally, I'm convinced that who
we're close with is more of a choice
than I previously thought.
In the kaleidoscopic scheme of
people in my life, the ones who re
main with me even if they're gone
are the ones with whom I get to the
heart of things. We're honest, and
maybe totally awkward and maybe
embarrassingly politically incorrect.
We have a relationship big enough
to allow space for silence. We aren't
afraid to stumble in our attempts to
articulate crazy, ambiguous mental
things. And only later do I realize
the ridiculous vulnerability of it all.
What if they rejected or mocked my
most deep-seated beliefs? I guess it
depends on how much that actually
mattered...

I tend to believe that, in the big
ger picture of things, most of us are
going through very, very similar
things. The specific words, dates,
players, situation may be different.
But the vocabulary of emotion stays
the same. More often than not, we
share something quite substantial
with the person sitting next to us,
whoever they are. Of course,
though, we'd have to take a chance
on ourselves and them to find
out just how much.

that know it all, and love us all the
more. Otherwise, what? ... Most
of us have felt it. Otherwise, we're
surrounded by crowds of people
with whom we talk, talk, talk ...
but have not a single clue about
who we are. This is loneliness at its
most ironic. It's loneliness at its
worst.

Many of us felt this freshman
year, when we first landed in a high
energy world of smiling people who
were similar in the most important
way: they were students at this
school. Maybe that was enough, for
a while. But there were many of us
who soon found ourselves pretend
ing and trying to remember what to
say to sound included for the sake of
being included. We began feeling
that contrast between the individu
ality we all "know" we support and
our instinctive fear of that moment
of social isolation. (Why else do we
keep so quiet in discussion sec
tions? ) So we kept up the cheer and
toned down the challenge, because
being effortlessly honest suddenly
became risky. Talking about our past
and ourselves wasn't exactly going
with the flow when conversations
had to be neutral territory. And the
result, from a bird's-eye view, was a

tangle of people each feeling alone
for the same , unspoken, unseen rea
sons. It's a strange social phenome
non when you think about it. But
I'm sure it's happening, always.
So what happens if we're too
open,maybe indiscriminately? Now
this might be the crux of the ever
lasting "girl/guy-friends" question.
Example scenario: she meets him
and opens up. So does he. They
laugh, they giggle, but it's not all
laughs and giggles: they talk. She
does the same with other friends. He
does not. And, starting from there,
an imbalance can begin where one
feels something in the relationship
that the other does not. This isn't a
formula, but rather a series of events
I've seen innumerable times. It per
suades me that letting someone in
can, well, really bnhgthemin.lt per
suades me that we respect and grav
itate to genuinely open hearts, even
if we're scared of opening our own.
Finally, I'm convinced that who
we're close with is more of a choice
than I previously thought.
In the kaleidoscopic scheme of
people in my life, the ones who re
main with me even if they're gone
are the ones with whom I get to the
heart of things. We're honest, and
maybe totally awkward and maybe
embarrassingly politically incorrect.
We have a relationship big enough
to allow space for silence. We aren't
afraid to stumble in our attempts to
articulate crazy, ambiguous mental
things. And only later do I realize
the ridiculous vulnerability of it all.
What if they rejected or mocked my
most deep-seated beliefs? I guess it
depends on how much that actually
mattered...

I tend to believe that, in the big
ger picture of things, most of us are
going through very, very similar
things. The specific words, dates,
players, situation may be different.
But the vocabulary of emotion stays
the same. More often than not, we
share something quite substantial
with the person sitting next to us,
whoever they are. Of course,
though, we'd have to take a chance
on ourselves and them to find
out just how much.

Sometimes, all we want in the
world from another person is a
nod reassurance that we
aren't alone. Sometimes, we just
want our thoughts received, ac
knowledged and echoed back to us
like they make sense and, yes, it's
okay. Normal. You're fine. I under
stand. For as much as communica
tion is about conveying informa
tion, it's about confirming what we
already think. This might explain
our impulse to latch onto, in first en
counters, "ME too!!!" or "I know,
right?!" like conversational
lifeboats. It's that initial connection
we constantly seek, even if we're
only at shallow shores of acquain
tance.

But if we move on into darker
waters, our distance from solid
ground grows alongside our own
vulnerability. At the point where
stranger turns into significant, trust
becomes crucial with all the added
self-exposure. It's no longer a class
or fave movie or play-day proximi
ty that locks in a long friendship
like it might have in grade school.
At 20-ish years of age, we've accu
mulated exclusive rights to our
most self-identifying thoughts
rights that we don't relinquish in
discriminately. Our biggest dreams,
family secrets, shameful mistakes
and lowest moments are not always
the flashy headlines we broadcast
in large group settings. They mean
more. And for that, it's what gives
us the chance to find those others
that know it all, and love us all the
more. Otherwise, what? ... Most
