## PROFILE Saving Stegner's study 
### ADRIENNE VON SCHULTESS 
The Los Altos Hills community is
no stranger to mega mansions
indeed, a 25,500-square-foot
mansion recently sold for $lOO
million as the most expensive
single-family house purchased in the Unit
ed States, according to The San Francisco
Chronicle. But the new construction also
replaces smaller homes of the past.
One house slated for demolition be
longed to Wallace Stegner, an acclaimed
historian, environmentalist and writer, who
won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1972
and was an early resident of Los Altos Hills.
"Wallace Stegner was appointed a full
professor at Stanford in 1945," wrote
Eavan Boland, director of the Creative
Writing Program, in an email to The Daily.
"He was hired specifically to be in charge of
the Creative Writing Program."
Stegner's family "decided to offer his
property and house to Stanford at a dis
counted price in the hope that they might
put in a creative writing center," said Les
Earnest, senior research scientist emeritus.

Stanford's Property Development Of
fice said it would sell instead, leading the
family to withdraw the offer. The property
was placed on the market and purchased by
New Yam and Wan Lei Yong. The Yongs
later applied for a demolition permit be
cause they "wanted to build another man
sion," according to Earnest.
Earnest is leading an effort to preserve
Stegner's study, where Stegner wrote the
majority of his most famous works, such as
"Angle of Repose" and "The Spectator
Bird." He believes the study should be relo
cated to a site in the surrounding area and
converted into a small museum, where he
envisions exhibits on Stegner's career and a
robotic docent.
The landowners agreed to allow the
study to be moved, but the logistics are dif
ficult: the study can only be moved once the
demolition has started because of its loca
tion on the lot.
There are other efforts to not only save
the study but also to halt the house's demo
lition entirely. The National Trust for His
toric Preservation wrote to Debbie Pedro,
planning director for Los Altos Hills, argu

ing the study should be designated a his
toric site and to request a California Envi
ronmental Quality Act (CEQA) review of
the site. This review examines both the en
vironmental implications of a demolition
and the site's historical significance.
As the CEQA review takes place,
Earnest is racing to gather funds to relocate
the study and find a place to put it.
"I have about half as much as we need,
namely $3,500, and I am willing to loan
enough to get the job done," Earnest said.
"So the money is not the major block at this
point. It's the site and lack thereof."
Earnest has looked at several sites for a
possible relocation, but none have yet
come through. After being rejected by the
board of Hidden Villa, a Los Altos Hills
ranch, he appealed to Stanford.
"I happen to know John Hennessy and
suggested to him that Stanford provide a
site," Earnest said. As a result, Stanford's
Property Development Office looked into
possible sites for the study.
Stanford's Property Development Of
fice found three potential sites in the
foothills by the golf course overlooking the

campus. Earnest appealed to those at Stan
ford "who were previously associated with
Stegner," he said.
Stanford ultimately rejected the project.
Finding no help from the University,
Earnest moved on to two potential sites in
Los Altos Hills. One of these sites is "next
to town hall in fact next to an old house
moved there as a historical artifact,"
Earnest said.
"I did write a letter to the town govern
ment requesting permission to use the
sites," Earnest said. "There are indications
that some council members are opposed."
On Dec. 20, Los Altos Hills Mayor Rich
Larson wrote to Earnest, saying "the Histo
ry Committee has been asked to put this
issue on the January agenda and to propose
a solution. There appears to be strong
agreement from all parties that this matter
should be resolved as quickly as possible."
Yet without a site and with the result of
the CEQA review still pending, the study's
future is unclear.

planning director for Los Altos Hills, argu

ing the study should be designated a his
toric site and to request a California Envi
ronmental Quality Act (CEQA) review of
the site. This review examines both the en
vironmental implications of a demolition
and the site's historical significance.
As the CEQA review takes place,
Earnest is racing to gather funds to relocate
the study and find a place to put it.
"I have about half as much as we need,
namely $3,500, and I am willing to loan
enough to get the job done," Earnest said.
"So the money is not the major block at this
point. It's the site and lack thereof."
Earnest has looked at several sites for a
possible relocation, but none have yet
come through. After being rejected by the
board of Hidden Villa, a Los Altos Hills
ranch, he appealed to Stanford.
"I happen to know John Hennessy and
suggested to him that Stanford provide a
site," Earnest said. As a result, Stanford's
Property Development Office looked into
possible sites for the study.
Stanford's Property Development Of
fice found three potential sites in the
foothills by the golf course overlooking the

campus. Earnest appealed to those at Stan
ford "who were previously associated with
Stegner," he said.
Stanford ultimately rejected the project.
Finding no help from the University,
Earnest moved on to two potential sites in
Los Altos Hills. One of these sites is "next
to town hall in fact next to an old house
moved there as a historical artifact,"
Earnest said.
"I did write a letter to the town govern
ment requesting permission to use the
sites," Earnest said. "There are indications
that some council members are opposed."
On Dec. 20, Los Altos Hills Mayor Rich
Larson wrote to Earnest, saying "the Histo
ry Committee has been asked to put this
issue on the January agenda and to propose
a solution. There appears to be strong
agreement from all parties that this matter
should be resolved as quickly as possible."
Yet without a site and with the result of
the CEQA review still pending, the study's
future is unclear.
