## Echoes of the past 
### MADELINE SIDES 
Peering around corners of
tall bookcases, winding
through a trail of old
gramophones and
speakers, a visit to Stan
ford's Archive of Recorded Sound
is an adventure through the music
and voices of the past century.
The Archive, located in the
basement of Braun Music Library,
was created in 1958 when the Uni
versity's first music librarian, Ed
ward Colby, developed an interest
in historical sound recordings. At
the time, old style 78 rpm (revolu
tions per minute) records were
being quickly replaced by the
newer LP format (long-playing
phonograph record), and Colby
felt that libraries should hurry to
collect the historical disks before
they disappeared.
Today, the Archive houses
about 100,000 78 rpm disks and
200,000 LP records and is over
seen by head librarian Jerry
Mcßride.
"Much of the collection comes
to us from private donations,
though we do have some funds for
purchasing items," Mcßride said.
"The primary purpose of the
recordings here is for the use of
Stanford students and faculty for
their research, teaching and
study."
TTie Archive contains sound
recordings of all types, ranging
from classical concerts and opera
performances to spoken word
readings, radio broadcasts and
homemade sound effects. From
delicate cylinders, thick lacquered
disks and traditional 22 rpm LPs
to spools of reel-to-reel tape and
boxes of CDs, the recordings span
the last century and come in for
mats representative of their time

period. The Archive also has the
devices needed to play all of these
recordings: many of these devices
are historical pieces themselves.
"The recordings can be used
for historical research or research
of any topic. Anything in sound
can be the source of research,"
Mcßride said. "We get a wide
range of people using the Archive.
It's a fairly unique collection, so
we get users from outside of Stan
ford, both undergrad and gradu
ate as well as University faculty."
Many of the Archive's collec
tions are completely unique, and
their constituent pieces can only
be found at Stanford. Digitiza
tion work ensures that the
recordings will be available to fu
ture generations, as some of
these past recordings are less
durable than others.
"Sound recording tape from
the 1950s to 'Bos is a rather unsta
ble format," Mcßride said. "The
tape is beginning to fail if it hasn't
been stored properly over the
years."
Unfortunately, digitization
from analog recordings is a time
intensive process, as recordings
must be digitized in real time. The
process for one two-hour record
ing itself takes more than two
hours.
"The plan is over time to digi
tize our recordings for preserva
tion purposes," Mcßride said.
Much of the Archive is organ
ized into collections, many coming
with intriguing background sto
ries about the people and places
that created them. Sound cata
loguer Frank Ferko is responsible
for organizing and researching the
details of some of the Archive's
collections.
"Each cataloging record that I
do is like a mini research project,"

Ferko said. "When we receive
recordings, we oftentimes do not
have the actual disk packaging; we
have to go off of the little informa
tion provided on the label."
Ferko recently catalogued the
Ambassador Auditorium collec
tion, which comes from the fa
mous Ambassador Auditorium in
Pasadena, Calif., known as "the
Carnegie Flail of the West."
"The Ambassador Foundation
donated their entire collection of
recordings from 1974-1995 to
Stanford, as well as the supporting
paper documents that go with the
recordings," Ferko said. "They
hosted all kinds of performers
from around the world for 20
years ... and had very sophisticat
ed recording equipment."

Ferko is currently working on
cataloging a large personal collec
tion from San Francisco native
Jack Lund that was donated to
Stanford after his death in 2009.

"He had a very strong interest
in classical music. He attended
concerts, supported the San Fran
cisco Symphony and traveled the
world meeting great artists,"
Ferko said. Lund's entire personal
collection, which includes hun
dreds of 78 rpm records as well as
written letter correspondences
with musicians, photos and con
cert programs, is being added to
the Archive.

The Archive is impressive in its
depth, evidenced by collections
like the Monterey Jazz Festival
collection, which holds each con

secutive recording of the annual
Monterey Jazz Festival in Mon
terey, Calif., beginning in 1958. It is
also staggering in its breadth.
Ferko has come across a variety of
unique and quirky recordings in
his time at Stanford and can trace
musical and recording trends over
the course of its history.

"I came across a record once
with a label marked 'Man Walking
on Gravel,' and I had to listen to
verify. But it is just that, the sound
of a man on gravel. Flip it over and
you find the track 'Two Men Walk
ing on Gravel,"' Ferko said. "Back
then, recording sound effects was
a novel thing."
