## FRESHMAN '15 Is 20 too many? 
### Bianca Chavez 
During my time at Stanford,
I have been told several
pieces of advice time and
time again. Start papers before the
day they're due. Don't join 90
clubs just because they all seem
cool. Wear a helmet when riding
your bike. And, above all else, do
not attempt to take 20 units.
So when it came time for me to
enroll in classes for this quarter, I
told myself I would play it safe.
Then I started browsing through
Explore Courses. And my cau
tious academic plan was promptly
flung out the window.
"Don't do it," my friends
warned. They thought my choice
to take 20 units would be the
equivalent of Cady Heron's deci
sion to join the Mathletes: social
suicide. We all knew the kids in our
dorm who had taken 20 units dur
ing fall quarter but only by
name. They were the ones who
rarely ventured outside of the
building, unless it was to attend
class or visit the library, of course.
They were the ones who pulled all
nighters like it was as simple as
pulling up your pants. They were
the ones who always looked like
they were in desperate need of a
nice, long nap despite the mul
tiple cups of coffee they consumed
at every meal.
Was I condemning myself to a
quarter of their extreme lifestyle?
A quarter without lazy Saturday
brunches, The Row, How I Met
Your Mother marathons and late

night runs to Yogurtland?
"Think long and hard before
you decide to take a heavy course
load this early in your college ca
reer," warned my Pre-Major Advi
sor earlier this year. "Getting used
to college is a huge adjustment,"
she explained. "Give yourself a
while to settle in before you start
piling that many classes on your
plate." I left her office knowing she
was probably right (as she always
is), and yet a tiny part of me was
still on the fence.
Plus, even if I thought about
dropping a class, which one would
it be? Spanish? Too bad it's a re
quirement for studying abroad in
Madrid which I've dreamed of
doing for years. IHUM? More like
iWish. Poli sci? Too bad it's a major
requirement. My introsem? Too
bad it's easily my favorite class and
the thought of dropping it makes
me want to cry.
Like so many other students, I
didn't sign up for 20 units thinking,
"This will probably be as much fun
as a root canal. Let's do it!" It just
sort of happened. Between
major/minor requirements,
GERs, IHUM and PWR, 20-unit
quarters are sort of like zits: unfor
tunate, but most people will have
one or two at some point.
And so, despite the warnings of
my advisor and my friends, I have
decided to plow on with my 20-unit
course load. Sure, part of me is
more scared than I've been since I
saw "The Devil Inside" (bad, bad,

decision), but a larger part of me
knows that everything will proba
bly be just fine. Why? Because I re
ally believe that you are the only
person who can know what you're
capable of. Others can offer advice
and present perfectly valid points
to back up their assertions, but who
knows my study habits and time
management skills better than my
self? Besides, thousands of other
Stanford students have undertak
en the 20-Unit Challenge and lived
to tell the tale. Some gasp!
even had a few nights of fun time in
the process!
Was my decision a foolish one?
Maybe a little. Will there be days
when my mountain of work makes
me feel like crying? Duh. Can I
handle the pressure? Only time
will tell. Will I learn tons of new
things as I push myself harder than
I have ever pushed myself before?
Absolutely.
And if not, I'll thank Leland
and Jane for Stanford's long drop
period.
