## Picture perfect 
### Amanda Ach 
Funny story: last week, I fell
down a flight of stairs. I was
carrying a plate of French
fries and ketchup, and by the end
of my little tumble I was com
pletely covered in both. Other
than ruining a great shirt with
ketchup stains, I survived un
harmed that is, save for one
tiny cracked rib. Now, this would
n't have been such a big deal, but
last week was also when I saw the
picture of the woman who fell on
Google Maps' Street View, which
just so happens to be the funniest
thing I've ever seen. Ever. Unfor
tunately, having a cracked rib
makes laughing a completely
miserable experience, so what
should have been the best mo
ment in my life became, well, mis
erable. Still, even after crying in
both pain and laughter for sever
al minutes, I maintain that em
barrassing moments caught on
Street View are amazingly funny.
There's only one problem
Google is running out of streets.
Yes, they have photographed al
most all of the big streets in the
world! For the conspiracy theo
rists out there, this is probably
terrifying for a completely differ
ent reason, but for those of us
who live for funny Google Street
View images, this is deeply upset
ting. Luckily, Google is working
as quickly as possible to make
sure we are never short in our
supply of Brazilian women
falling on their faces or German
men crawling out of car trunks
(true story) they are now ex
panding Google Street View to
cover more remote areas of the
earth. Aside from providing us
with the potential for more en
tertainment, this new initiative
has also given us something al
most as great â€”jobs.
As it turns out, Google is hir
ing recent college graduates to
bike around various parts of the
world that aren't automobile-ac
cessible and take photographs
for Street View. In fact, there are
currently two young men biking
around France, taking les photos
of historical sites and presumably
drinking a lot of wine and having
a great time. For someone who
loves biking, travel and photog
raphy, this is probably the best
job you could ever imagine.
Of course, a sense of adven
ture isn't the only qualification
for this opportunity. You will also
need to have some sort of a back
ground in engineering or com-

puter science in order to proper
ly operate the fancy equipment,
and experience with photogra
phy wouldn't hurt. In addition,
you need to be a good bike rider.
I'm sure this isn't a big deal for
most of you, but those of us who
had three bike accidents in their
freshman year alone may not be
best suited for this job (yes, I'm
talking about myself).
As long as you can stay up
right on a bicycle, this job has
very few drawbacks. The biggest
one literally is that you will
ride a giant, oversized tricycle
that holds a lot of heavy photog
raphy and GPS equipment. Sec
ond, given the awesomeness of
the job, it's a pretty competitive
application process, although the
Internet was somewhat unclear
on the details of exactly how to
go about applying. And last but
not least, you have to wear a
Google shirt the whole time
(probably not the same exact
one, but still).
It should also be noted that
this is a short-term job. You might
have the opportunity to transi
tion into a more permanent posi
tion at Google afterwards, but it's
not a career in and of itself. In my
opinion, though, this is a good
thing. Very few of us know what
we want to do with our lives, so
why not try something fun for a
little bit and then see what we
want to do after that? There will
never be a better time in our lives
to just travel around the world
taking pictures and enjoying life,
and the fact that this is an actual
job, however temporary, is almost
too good to be true.
Basically, if I were at all quali
fied, I would be totally into this
job. But I'm not, so I'm going to
encourage all of you to consider it
when making your post-gradua
tion plans. And if you do end up
taking pictures for Google Street
View, please try to catch some
funny or embarrassing moments
on camera. It would make me so
incredibly happy.

Think Amanda's clumsiness is
cute? Make her fall for you! Woo
