## SPRINGING TO ACTION MEN'S, WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS OPEN SEASONS 
### CONNOR SCHERER 
Both Cardinal gymnastics
teams kicked off their 2012 cam
paigns this past weekend, with
the women hosting the NorCal
Quad Meet and the men begin
ning their title defense at Cali
fornia. The women emerged with
a solid performance and a victo
ry, while the men dropped their
first test of the season.
Women's gymnastics
On Sunday afternoon, the
Stanford women's gymnastics
team opened its season at the
NorCal Quad Meet, hosting UC-
Davis, San Jose State and Sacra
mento State. The preseason No. 8
squad, the Cardinal returns eight
gymnasts from last year's team
although two were sidelined
this past weekend with injuries
and brings in a strong recruit
ing class of five freshmen. But
the team is led by upperclassmen
Nicole Pechanec and Ashley
Morgan, both of whom did not
disappoint on Sunday.
Pechanec, a senior who
earned All-Pac-10 Second Team
honors on the floor exercise last
season, participated in the un
even bars, vault and balance
beam. She was one of five Cardi
nal gymnasts to compete in at
least three events, along with
Morgan, fellow junior Nicole
Dayton and freshmen Pauline
Hanset and Rebecca Wing.
Using her own invented move,
the "Pechancova," Pechanec
earned a 9.900 on the uneven
bars to lead the field in that
event. In addition, she and Day
ton tied to win the vault with
scores of 9.825.

Morgan also earned All-Pac
-10 honors on the floor, joining
the first team on the floor. She
was the only Cardinal gymnast

to compete in all four events on
Sunday, finishing second overall
behind Thomasina Wallace of
San Jose State by a margin of just
.075 points. Morgan's 9.900 on
the floor, her fifth consecutive
9.900 in that event, tied her with
Pechanec for the best score on
the afternoon.
The Cardinal also got a big
boost from Hanset, who was
making her collegiate debut.
Never earning below a 9.750 on
any of her three events, Hanset
scored a 9.850 on the floor, sec
ond only to Morgan.
Stanford earned a total score
of 194.900, followed by San Jose
State (194.300), Sacramento
State (191.575) and UC-Davis
(190.775). The Cardinal won
every event as a team on the af
ternoon aside from the floor, in
which they placed second to San
Jose State. However, Stanford
never trailed in the meet, as its
opening vault score was the
highest in the first round.
On Sunday, the Cardinal
hosts Washington at Burnham
Pavilion in the second of the
team's three home meets during
the 2012 season.

Men's gymnastics
The Stanford men's gymnas
tics team looked to open its de
fense of last year's national
championship on Friday against
California. Following six consec
utive top-three finishes at the
NCAA team championships and
a national title in two of the past
three years, the team looked to
continue its success this season
despite losing five All-Ameri
cans from last year. However,
the preseason No. 4 Cardinal suf
fered a tough loss to the No. 5
Bears to kick off its season.
The meet was a back-and
forth affair between the Cardi

nal and Bears until the past few
events. After Cal got off to a
2.800-point lead after the first
round (where the Bears put up a
score of 57.500 on the floor exer
cise and the Cardinal scored a
54.700 on the pommel horse),
Stanford narrowed the deficit
with its impressive performance
on the floor in the second round.
Led by redshirt sophomore Paul
Hichwa's 15.000, the Cardinal

posted a 58.300 to cut Cal's lead
to just .300 points.
After the rings and vault,
Stanford took a 227.400 to
226.600 lead over Cal, due in
large part to redshirt freshman
Sean Senters' 15.200 in vault, the
high score among all events for
the team. However, Cal came
back in the final two events to ul-
