## SHERWOOD CUP FEATURES BEST 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford men's ten
nis team had a busy holiday
weekend in Thousand Oaks,
Calif., competing in the early
season Sherwood Collegiate
Cup. The annual tournament
features some of the best pro
grams and players in college ten
nis, giving coaches a privileged
opportunity to watch their
squads face off against elite com
petition on the eve of the dual
match season.

"The competition is great
down there," said Stanford head
coach John Whitlinger. "The
guys saw some of the best tennis
players in the country. It was a
great test for us."
This year's Sherwood Cup
field featured four prominent
teams: Stanford, No. 9 UCLA,No.
5 Baylor and the two-time de
fending national champion, No. 1
use

The Cardinal was without the
services of its top player, senior
Bradley Klahn, who is out "for at
least another month" with an in
jury, according to Whitlinger.
The Stanford delegation, with
out Klahn, was still eight-men
deep and was led by the impres
sive play of senior Ryan
Thacher, who will likely be filling
in for Klahn in the team's No. 1
spot when the dual-match sea
son kicks off this Friday.
Thacher and junior Dennis
Lin, who returned to his home
town for the tournament, were
the two Cardinal representatives
to make it past the first round of
the draw. In the second round,
Lin fell to UCLA's Nick Meister,
while Thacher bruised his way
past USC's Roberto Quiroz by
the score of 6-0, 6-1. Thacher's
run ended in the quarterfinals
when Quiroz's teammate,
Daniel Nguyen, got revenge to
the tune of 6-4,6-3.
The Trojans continued their
strong play from last season by
sweeping through the doubles
and singles draws, with Trojans

winning and finishing runner-up
in both draws. Coach Whitlinger,
though, does not put too much
stock in the results of this tune
up tournament.

"It's good to play those guys
and see where you're at and see
what their teams are going to be
like," he said. "It's really just a
good tournament to start the
year off with."
"It's still a long way from May,"

he added , referring to the annual
NCAA Tennis Championship.

Stanford will surely be look
ing to play its best tennis late in
the spring, when the team hopes
to avenge its memorably heart
breaking loss to No. 2 Virginia in
last year's NCAA quarterfinal,
and when Klahn has returned to
the court in full health.
The Cardinal will face its next
opponent on Friday, Jan. 20,
when it travels to No. 23 Tulsa.
