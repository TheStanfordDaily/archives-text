## No. 2 Card hits the road 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
Stanford tennis fans will
have to wait two more weeks
to witness the Cardinal in ac
tion at home, but the players
have been busy gaining match
play practice in anticipation of
their dual-season opener. The
No. 2 Stanford women made
their first appearance since the
fall this past weekend, repre
senting the Cardinal in the
Freeman Memorial Invitation
al in Las Vegas and the Nation
al College Tennis Classic
(NCTC) in Indian Wells, Calif.
Senior captain Veronica Li,
freshman Ellen Tsay and soph
omore Amelia Herring jour
neyed to Southern California
to compete in the NCTC.
Other schools represented in
the tournament included No. 9
Virginia, No. 21 Texas and No.
16 USC.

Tsay led the charge for
Stanford as the No. 2 seed be
hind UVA's Emily Fraser.Tsay
breezed through the first and
second rounds before falling to
Virginia's Xi Li 7-6 (4), 6-1 in
the quarterfinals. Despite her
elimination, Tsay was proud of
the mental toughness she dis
played throughout the match.
"I was down 0-3 in the first
set of the match and came back
to go up 5-4," Tsay said. "Even
though I lost that set in a
tiebreaker and ended up losing
the match, I feel as though I
was constantly finding ways to
try to improve and stay in it."
Tsay faced a similar situa
tion when doubling up with Li.
In their quarterfinal match
against Texas' Elizabeth Beg
ley and Juliana Gajic,Tsay and
Li's chances at victory seemed
grim as they trailed 1-7 in the
pro-set doubles match, which
is played to eight games. Tsay was
lucky to have experience on her
side this time, as she and senior
captain partner Li were able to
make a comeback to win the
match 9-7.
"I think at first we were still
kind of feeling it out and didn't
have much match experience to
gether,"Tsay said. "Our play was a
little bit off-timing, but we knew
that if we got it together, we could
be the better team. We talked it
out, tried to work together more
and improved with each game."
Li, too, ran away with the first
round but was eliminated in the
second round by Texas' Alex Mar
tin, 6-2,7-5. Herring fell in the sin
gles first round to Katerna Pal
livets of Fresno Pacific, 7-5, 6-1,
but moved on to consolations,
sneaking by Erika Januskova of
Fresno Pacific 7-6 (10-9), 5-7,7-3.
She ultimately lost in the quarter
finals of the consolation round to
Cierra Gaytan-Leach of Texas, 6-
2,6-2.
Representing the Cardinal just
east in Las Vegas was the rest of
the squad: junior Natalie Dillon,
sophomore Nicole Gibbs, junior
Mallory Burdette and junior
Stacey Tan.Tan and Burdette both
reached the quarterfinals round,
but Dillon was defeated 6-1,6-1 in
the second flight of the main draw
singles round by Skylar Morton of
UCLA. Tan fell 6-0, 6-4 to
UCLA's Robin Anderson in the
quarters. It was Burdette who se
cured a 4-6, 6-0, 6-3 victory that
round after dropping the first set.
"I was up 4-3 in the first but lost
my focus and she came back,"
Burdette said. "I knew that if I ex
ecuted my game plan that I would
have a really good chance of get
ting through that round. The
match helped me work through a
lot of issues."
Many of these challenges
stemmed from playing on the
road.
"I needed to continue to be ag
gressive in the point and not settle
for just hanging behind the base
line," she said. "The conditions in
Vegas were a little bit tough be
cause of the bouncy courts, which
were pretty slow compared to the
soft courts at Stanford, so I had to
take the ball earlier so it wouldn't
jump over my head."
Burdette made it all the way to
the championship round before
USC's Zoe Scandalis outlasted
her 6-7 (8), 7-6 (5), 6-3.

"I was a little bit frustrated be
cause I had three match points in
the second set, but she was tough,"
Burdette said. "She got a lot of
balls back. I was taking all the
risks and really going for my shots,
but she was getting almost every
ball even though she was hanging
back. It made it difficult to close
out the match, but she did a great
job."
Burdette and Gibbs also made
it to the consolation champi
onship doubles match and were
set to face North Carolina's Shi
nann Featherston and Lauren
McHale. However, the match was
not played because the Stanford
players had already missed their
first flight back to the Farm due to
prolonged singles play and could
n't afford to miss a second.
The Cardinal now has two
weeks to prepare for its first dual
match of the season on Feb. 1
against UC-Davis.
"The first weeks back are
rough because everyone's been
doing different things over
break," Burdette said. "But every
one's focused now. It's the time to
really break it down in practice
and in the gym and then build it all
back up for the season's start."
Tsay agreed and expressed ex
citement to play back on the
Farm.
"I think our mentality will be
even more intense," she declared.
"I have watched Stanford play
dual matches before, and I know
the crowd will be really enthusias
tic. I can't wait to experience play
ing for the team and the home
crowd."

"I was down 0-3 in the first
set of the match and came back
to go up 5-4," Tsay said. "Even
though I lost that set in a
tiebreaker and ended up losing
the match, I feel as though I
was constantly finding ways to
try to improve and stay in it."
Tsay faced a similar situa
tion when doubling up with Li.
In their quarterfinal match
against Texas' Elizabeth Beg
ley and Juliana Gajic,Tsay and
Li's chances at victory seemed
grim as they trailed 1-7 in the
pro-set doubles match, which
is played to eight games. Tsay was
lucky to have experience on her
side this time, as she and senior
captain partner Li were able to
make a comeback to win the
match 9-7.
"I think at first we were still
kind of feeling it out and didn't
have much match experience to
gether,"Tsay said. "Our play was a
little bit off-timing, but we knew
that if we got it together, we could
be the better team. We talked it
out, tried to work together more
and improved with each game."
Li, too, ran away with the first
round but was eliminated in the
second round by Texas' Alex Mar
tin, 6-2,7-5. Herring fell in the sin
gles first round to Katerna Pal
livets of Fresno Pacific, 7-5, 6-1,
but moved on to consolations,
sneaking by Erika Januskova of
Fresno Pacific 7-6 (10-9), 5-7,7-3.
She ultimately lost in the quarter
finals of the consolation round to
Cierra Gaytan-Leach of Texas, 6-
2,6-2.
Representing the Cardinal just
east in Las Vegas was the rest of
the squad: junior Natalie Dillon,
sophomore Nicole Gibbs, junior
Mallory Burdette and junior
Stacey Tan.Tan and Burdette both
reached the quarterfinals round,
but Dillon was defeated 6-1,6-1 in
the second flight of the main draw
singles round by Skylar Morton of
UCLA. Tan fell 6-0, 6-4 to
UCLA's Robin Anderson in the
quarters. It was Burdette who se
cured a 4-6, 6-0, 6-3 victory that
round after dropping the first set.
"I was up 4-3 in the first but lost
my focus and she came back,"
Burdette said. "I knew that if I ex
ecuted my game plan that I would
have a really good chance of get
ting through that round. The
match helped me work through a
lot of issues."
Many of these challenges
stemmed from playing on the
road.
"I needed to continue to be ag
gressive in the point and not settle
for just hanging behind the base
line," she said. "The conditions in
Vegas were a little bit tough be
cause of the bouncy courts, which
were pretty slow compared to the
soft courts at Stanford, so I had to
take the ball earlier so it wouldn't
jump over my head."
Burdette made it all the way to
the championship round before
USC's Zoe Scandalis outlasted
her 6-7 (8), 7-6 (5), 6-3.

"I was a little bit frustrated be
cause I had three match points in
the second set, but she was tough,"
Burdette said. "She got a lot of
balls back. I was taking all the
risks and really going for my shots,
but she was getting almost every
ball even though she was hanging
back. It made it difficult to close
out the match, but she did a great
job."
Burdette and Gibbs also made
it to the consolation champi
onship doubles match and were
set to face North Carolina's Shi
nann Featherston and Lauren
McHale. However, the match was
not played because the Stanford
players had already missed their
first flight back to the Farm due to
prolonged singles play and could
n't afford to miss a second.
The Cardinal now has two
weeks to prepare for its first dual
match of the season on Feb. 1
against UC-Davis.
"The first weeks back are
rough because everyone's been
doing different things over
break," Burdette said. "But every
one's focused now. It's the time to
really break it down in practice
and in the gym and then build it all
back up for the season's start."
Tsay agreed and expressed ex
citement to play back on the
Farm.
"I think our mentality will be
even more intense," she declared.
"I have watched Stanford play
dual matches before, and I know
the crowd will be really enthusias
tic. I can't wait to experience play
ing for the team and the home
crowd."
