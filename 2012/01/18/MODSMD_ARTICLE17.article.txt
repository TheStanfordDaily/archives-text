# Delighted with Dawkins
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
Just a few months ago, I was
ready to see the day that
Johnny Dawkins got fired.
For a kid who grew up
watching the Stanford bas
ketball team make it into March
Madness every year from 1994 to
2008 (with the lone exception of the
2005-06 season), it was painful to
watch Cardinal basketball the past
few seasons three years in a row,
Dawkins' squad finished seventh or
worse in the Pac-10. And after last
year's effort, I was hoping that the
Stanford basketball team would
have another bad season this year so
the Cardinal could move on from
Dawkins' regime and begin its re
turn to respectability.
I hit rock bottom as a Stanford
basketball fan last year. On a night
ly basis, my rage would boil every
time I saw Jeremy Green jack up an
other terrible three-pointer while
Dawkins sat placidly on the bench.
If Dawkins was going to sit there
like a man checking stocks on his
iPad while his team played subpar
basketball, I was not going to sup
port the team any longer.
But lo and behold, halfway
through the 2011-12 season, my
feelings have changed. In his fourth
year as head coach for the Cardinal,
things have finally crystallized for
Dawkins' squad and I couldn't
be happier about it. The Stanford
basketball team is back.
In case you haven't realized, the
Cardinal basketball team is 15-3
overall, tied for first in the Pac-12
and in good position to make the
NCAA tournament. The 15 wins in
18 games have already tied the Car
dinal's win total from the entirety of
last season. Now, the Pac-12 has
proven to be a very weak confer
ence this season, but Dawkins de
serves to be commended for finally
delivering a team that looks like a
winner back to the Farm.
The most remarkable thing
about the Cardinal's transforma
tion from "very mediocre with a lot
of major question marks" to "pretty
darn good" is that Dawkins was able
to finally make it happen in just one
year with pretty much the exact
same team. So just how has he done
it?
First, the addition of freshman
guard Chasson Randle coupled
with the departure of Jeremy Green
has made the Cardinal's backcourt
infinitely better. Although Green
led the team in points per game last
season with 16.2 per contest, the
Cardinal are far better off now than
they were last season when Green
ran the show.
Simply put, Randle does all the
things that Green never did last sea
son like pass the basketball occa
sionally. Last year. Green averaged
just one assist per game. Just one.
Randle averages 2.3 per game. It's
amazing how having a guard who
creates opportunities for other play
ers changes just how successful your
team is. Additionally, Randle is the
third-leading scorer on the team,
with his 12.2 points per game essen
tially making up for Green's scoring
ability.
Second, Dawkins appears to un
derstand the strengths and weak
nesses of his team much better this
season. Notably, this means that
sophomores John Gage and Josh
Huestis have earned far more play
ing time, and their energy and scor
ing ability have been a critical part
of the Cardinal's success. Gage aver
ages three more minutes of playing
time per game this year and has
even gotten some starts the last few
weeks while Huestis' playing
time has gone up from 9.9 minutes
per game to 20.9 minutes per game.
Although this has affected Dwight
Powell and Jarrett Mann's playing
time, one can hardly argue with the
results.
Finally, I'd like to think fans like
me, who were becoming disgruntled
with the team's recent performanc
es, had something to do with the
transformation as well. But I also
know Johnny Dawkins would never
admit that the hot seat was getting
to him, even if it were true. But when
I watch him prowl up and down the
sidelines with a little more spring in
his step or wave his arms to pump up
the crowd (like he did last Thursday
against Utah), I have to believe that
Dawkins knew he had to deliver a
winner this season. And he has.

In sum, it's clear to me that this
team, under Dawkins' leadership,
has finally turned a corner. Even
though his team is far from being
one of the best in Stanford history,
the Cardinal looks primed to re
