# Co-founder Yang leaves Yahoo
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF Margaret Rawson 
Yahoo co-founder and former
CEO Jerry Yang '9O M.S. '9O re
signed from his board position and
broke ties completely with the
company Tuesday, amid recent
criticism about his leadership and
failure to secure a buy-out deal
with Microsoft. Yang resigned
from all company positions, includ
ing the boards of Yahoo Japan
Corporation and Alibaba Group
Holding Limited.
"The time has come for me to
pursue other interests outside of
Yahoo," Yang said in a company
statement.
Following the announcement
Tuesday, the company's stock price
rose approximately 3.7 percent in
after-hours trading. The company
has faced recent turmoil, as former
Pay Pal head Scott Thompson was
only recently appointed as CEO,
replacing Carol Bartz, who was
fired in September.
Yang currently serves on the
Stanford University Board of
Trustees following his initial ap
pointment in 2005, as last reported
in the August 2011 Stanford Bul
letin.
Yang and his wife, Akiko Ya
mazaki, pledged $75 million, the
largest of several donations from
the couple, to the University in
2007 for the construction of the
Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki
Environment and Energy Build
ing (Y2E2) and the Li Ka Shing
Center for Learning and Knowl
edge at the School of Medicine.
Yang co-founded Yahoo with
fellow Stanford student David Filo
in 1995.
