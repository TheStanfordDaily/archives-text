## No overdue bill increase with ePay 
### ALICE PHILLIPS STAFF WRITER 
Despite a new Stanford ePay system in
stated in the middle of last quarter which re
quired authorized tuition payers to re-regis
ter, Director of Student Services TJ. Fletcher
wrote in an email to The Daily that her office
has not observed an increase in past-due bal
ances this quarter.

Stanford's quarterly bill cycle begins two
months before the start of the upcoming
quarter, when students are first notified of
their unpaid balance. The balance is due by
the 15th of the month prior to the start of the
next quarter, and for the majority of students
the bill-paying cycle ends there. However,
each quarter there are some students for
whom the cycle drags on because they have
an unpaid balance, according to Director of
Financial Aid Karen Cooper.
An account is considered past due if there
is an unpaid balance after the due date, and
31 days past the due date, the account is
placed on a financial hold that prevents stu
dents from enrolling in future terms and re
ceiving transcripts or diplomas. Late pay
ment fees of 1 percent of the balance due are
applied once the account is considered past
due, according to the Stanford University
Gateway to Financial Activities website.
"Severely delinquent accounts may be re
ferred to a collection agency and/or placed in
litigation in accordance with state and feder
al laws," according to the website, "Students
with delinquent accounts may be held re
sponsible for collection costs, attorney fees
and court costs."

Financial holds can be lifted without the
balance being paid if there are arrangements
made to pay the balance, Fletcher wrote. Her
office and the Financial Aid Office stay in
close contact about cases involving unpaid
balances of students on financial aid.

"We'll step forward and say, it's our fault
the money's not here yet," Cooper said. "We
have to do x, y, z and the student's done
everything they can. It's an open communi-
cation back and forth between the
offices."
For students on financial aid, the
problem is one of several possible
components of their bill: University
financial aid, the parent contribu
tion, the student contribution or ex
pected outside scholarships.
"It could be that there is aid that
was supposed to disperse that has
n't, or they need more aid than
what we originally estimate,"
Cooper said. "We have to sit down
and figure out: why is the bill not
paid? Where is the money not com
ing from?"
Outside scholarship checks are
processed through the Financial
Aid Office, but if the check does not
arrive in time the balance is consid
ered unpaid, Cooper said. Her of
fice puts the amount of money a
student expects to receive as "antic
ipated aid" in the account so no late
fees will apply if the scholarship
check arrives late, but the student
will still be unable to enroll until the
check comes in to pay the balance,
as a financial hold will still apply.
"We do our best to make sure
we don't have a backlog of private
scholarship checks to be
processed," Cooper said.
If the problem is that the par
ent/student portion of the bill has
yet to be paid, the Financial Aid Of
fice constantly reevaluates if the aid
awarded is appropriate for a fami
ly's finances.
"We have noticed an increase in
appeals to us during the middle of
the year dealing with changes in
family circumstances over the last

three years or so due to the econo
my," Cooper said. "Families, par
ents are losing jobs. That's definite
ly on the upswing and has been a
big change for us."
A situation that Cooper said
does occur regularly, albeit it in
small numbers, is students who
have delinquent bills and are apply
ing for financial aid, despite having
never filled out the Free Applica
tion for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) during the normal aid
application cycle.

The Financial Aid Office is cur
rently handling at least one such
case of a student who has a delin
quent University bill but will need
financial aid to pay out the balance,
"If the student just fills out a fi
nancial aid application, we can get
him or her fixed up," Cooper said.
"Students do still apply throughout
the year, and changes in circum
stances are the number one reason.
The family thought they could han
dle the charges, but somebody lost a
job; there are medical expenses,
those kinds of things."
However, if graduate students
find themselves needing financial
aid, Cooper said that her office's
hands are frequently tied by feder
al regulations.
For example, if a student has de
faulted on federal loans taken out
while earning an undergraduate
degree, the Financial Aid Office
cannot award them new federal
loans at the graduate level. The of
fice will recommend private loans,
she said, but generally the student
will need a cosigner due to having
racked up bad credit by defaulting
on undergraduate loans.
"In really sticky situations, we
do have a small institutional loan
program that we can use, but it's a
small program," Cooper said.

Graduate student bills are also
often complicated because most
students rely on refunds due to
overpaid balances for their living
expenses, Cooper said. After the
University departments input the
stipend information into a comput
er system and the Financial Aid Of
fice applies any federal loans the
student may be receiving in addi
tion, the difference between the
amount owed and the amount paid
is refunded to the student's bank
account.

Federal rules allow the Univer
sity to dispense the refund up to 10
days before the start of the quarter
and as many as 14 days after the
start of the quarter. Cooper said
that Stanford usually refunds grad
uate student early in that time
frame, but that the winter quarter
refunds were delayed due to prob
lems transferring files to the stu
dents' banks.
"We were within the federal
regulations," Cooper said. "We
have to disperse money to students
within 14 days; it's not like we're vi
olating any rules, but I know how
important it is to get that money to
students."

due, according to the Stanford University
Gateway to Financial Activities website.
"Severely delinquent accounts may be re
ferred to a collection agency and/or placed in
litigation in accordance with state and feder
al laws," according to the website, "Students
with delinquent accounts may be held re
sponsible for collection costs, attorney fees
and court costs."

Financial holds can be lifted without the
balance being paid if there are arrangements
made to pay the balance, Fletcher wrote. Her
office and the Financial Aid Office stay in
close contact about cases involving unpaid
balances of students on financial aid.

"We'll step forward and say, it's our fault
the money's not here yet," Cooper said. "We
have to do x, y, z and the student's done
everything they can. It's an open communi-
cation back and forth between the
offices."
For students on financial aid, the
problem is one of several possible
components of their bill: University
financial aid, the parent contribu
tion, the student contribution or ex
pected outside scholarships.
"It could be that there is aid that
was supposed to disperse that has
n't, or they need more aid than
what we originally estimate,"
Cooper said. "We have to sit down
and figure out: why is the bill not
paid? Where is the money not com
ing from?"
Outside scholarship checks are
processed through the Financial
Aid Office, but if the check does not
arrive in time the balance is consid
ered unpaid, Cooper said. Her of
fice puts the amount of money a
student expects to receive as "antic
ipated aid" in the account so no late
fees will apply if the scholarship
check arrives late, but the student
will still be unable to enroll until the
check comes in to pay the balance,
as a financial hold will still apply.
"We do our best to make sure
we don't have a backlog of private
scholarship checks to be
processed," Cooper said.
If the problem is that the par
ent/student portion of the bill has
yet to be paid, the Financial Aid Of
fice constantly reevaluates if the aid
awarded is appropriate for a fami
ly's finances.
"We have noticed an increase in
appeals to us during the middle of
the year dealing with changes in
family circumstances over the last

three years or so due to the econo
my," Cooper said. "Families, par
ents are losing jobs. That's definite
ly on the upswing and has been a
big change for us."
A situation that Cooper said
does occur regularly, albeit it in
small numbers, is students who
have delinquent bills and are apply
ing for financial aid, despite having
never filled out the Free Applica
tion for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) during the normal aid
application cycle.

The Financial Aid Office is cur
rently handling at least one such
case of a student who has a delin
quent University bill but will need
financial aid to pay out the balance,
"If the student just fills out a fi
nancial aid application, we can get
him or her fixed up," Cooper said.
"Students do still apply throughout
the year, and changes in circum
stances are the number one reason.
The family thought they could han
dle the charges, but somebody lost a
job; there are medical expenses,
those kinds of things."
However, if graduate students
find themselves needing financial
aid, Cooper said that her office's
hands are frequently tied by feder
al regulations.
For example, if a student has de
faulted on federal loans taken out
while earning an undergraduate
degree, the Financial Aid Office
cannot award them new federal
loans at the graduate level. The of
fice will recommend private loans,
she said, but generally the student
will need a cosigner due to having
racked up bad credit by defaulting
on undergraduate loans.
"In really sticky situations, we
do have a small institutional loan
program that we can use, but it's a
small program," Cooper said.

Graduate student bills are also
often complicated because most
students rely on refunds due to
overpaid balances for their living
expenses, Cooper said. After the
University departments input the
stipend information into a comput
er system and the Financial Aid Of
fice applies any federal loans the
student may be receiving in addi
tion, the difference between the
amount owed and the amount paid
is refunded to the student's bank
account.

Federal rules allow the Univer
sity to dispense the refund up to 10
days before the start of the quarter
and as many as 14 days after the
start of the quarter. Cooper said
that Stanford usually refunds grad
uate student early in that time
frame, but that the winter quarter
refunds were delayed due to prob
lems transferring files to the stu
dents' banks.
"We were within the federal
regulations," Cooper said. "We
have to disperse money to students
within 14 days; it's not like we're vi
olating any rules, but I know how
important it is to get that money to
students."

Despite a new Stanford ePay system in
stated in the middle of last quarter which re
quired authorized tuition payers to re-regis
ter, Director of Student Services TJ. Fletcher
wrote in an email to The Daily that her office
has not observed an increase in past-due bal
ances this quarter.

Stanford's quarterly bill cycle begins two
months before the start of the upcoming
quarter, when students are first notified of
their unpaid balance. The balance is due by
the 15th of the month prior to the start of the
next quarter, and for the majority of students
the bill-paying cycle ends there. However,
each quarter there are some students for
whom the cycle drags on because they have
an unpaid balance, according to Director of
Financial Aid Karen Cooper.
An account is considered past due if there
is an unpaid balance after the due date, and
31 days past the due date, the account is
placed on a financial hold that prevents stu
dents from enrolling in future terms and re
ceiving transcripts or diplomas. Late pay
ment fees of 1 percent of the balance due are
applied once the account is considered past
due, according to the Stanford University
Gateway to Financial Activities website.
