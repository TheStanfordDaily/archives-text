## Senator Feingold calls for balance in politics 
### NITHYA VIJAYAKUMAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Americans should "walk and chew
gum at the same time," said former U.S.
Senator Russ Feingold to Crothers resi
dents Tuesday evening, calling for Amer
icans to balance the improvement of
global awareness with domestic econom
ic recovery.

Feingold the inaugural Mimi and
Peter E. Haas Distinguished Visitor at
the Haas Center for Public Service this
quarter held his first talk of a weekly
conversation series with Stanford stu
dents in Crothers, a global citizenship

themed dorm.
During his informal conversation with
the students, Feingold discussed politics,
his career, his decision to become a politi
cian and the importance of travel.
"Private citizens should be encour
aged and facilitated into going to other
parts of the world," Feingold empha
sized.
Feingold first discussed his recent
book, "While America Sleeps," which
covers the current lack of international
knowledge among American citizens.
While certain populations such as univer
sity students and faculty tend to be more
globally aware, Feingold said, he believes

the country at large needs to prioritize its
global education.

When asked about the United States'
current relationship with Iran, Feingold
acknowledged the danger of the coun
try's nuclear weapons program and
stressed the importance of maintaining a
positive relationship.

When another student questioned
prioritizing internationalism while re
building the American economy remains
a pressing issue, Feingold stressed the im
portance of balance in American politics.
As the discussion progressed, students
raised concerns on topics from the
importance of U.S. intervention in
global affairs to the Arab Spring
and the SOPA and PIPA bills.
Questions grew more person
al, as Feingold described how
seeing his political heroes
John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther
King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy
speak and later be assassinat
ed inspired him to pursue a ca
reer in politics.
Feingold connected with stu
dents by describing the proudest
and weakest moments of his ca
reer and described the difficul
ties as well as the importance of
voting independently in a two
party system.
Crothers residents will see
many other political figures visit
during the course of the year.
"Senator Feingold is one of
several key visitors to Crothers
this year, including Kofi Annan,
Ambassador Karl Eikenberry
and, next week, anti-genocide ac
tivist John Prendergast," said
Stephen Stedman '79 M.A. 'B5

Ph.D. 'BB, Crothers resident fel
low and Freeman Spogli senior
fellow at the Center on Democ
racy, Development and the Rule
of Law (CDDRL).
Feingold will speak to students
in other venues, including leading
a weekly workshop series facili
tated by Stanford in Government
(SIG) and two major lectures,
among other events.
"His engagements include

meetings with public and foreign
policy scholars, evening dorm
events, radio talk shows, a con
versation about faith and politics
with his sister, Rabbi Dena Fein
gold, and numerous class visits,"
said Thomas Schnaubelt, execu
tive director of the Haas Center
for Public Service.
