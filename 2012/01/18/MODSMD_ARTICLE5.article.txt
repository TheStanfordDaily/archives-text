# PA residents protest AT&T
## Others support plan to install 19 new antennas 
### SARAH MOORE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Palo Alto City Council will hold a public hear
ing on Monday, Jan. 23 to consider resident appeals
protesting an AT&T plan to install 19 new antennas
on utility poles.
AT&T aims to improve the wireless provider's ge
ographic coverage and carrying capacity with the new
antennas, but four residents have filed an official ap
peal with the city in opposition to the plan.
"The application by AT&T is just the first of many
to come," said resident Paula Rantz in her appeal. "I
am asking that this application be denied until the city
has come up with a comprehensive Wireless Master
Plan for the installation of cell towers, taking into ac
count the needs of the various providers and the over
all impact to our community."
Most residents in opposition expressed that the
proposed benefits do not outweigh the aesthetic
drawbacks, which not only include unsightliness but
also possible harm to property values. Other concerns
include worries about radiation emissions and prefer
ence for a citywide plan about the use of all utility
poles.
Palo Alto Director of Planning Curtis Williams,
whose office approved AT&T's plan, feels that these
issues have been adequately recon
ciled for the project to continue.
As far as visual effects are con
cerned, "Our architecture people
have already looked at the utility
poles, and they already have utility
equipment on them," Williams
said. "They condition the equip
ment so that it will blend in more,
and some of the equipment will be
located up higher so it's not right at
eye level. Also, it is required at
some of the poles to put some addi
tional trees in to help screen it visu
ally."
Regarding radiation concerns,
the federal government sets stan
dards ensuring that emissions are
healthy, and AT&T is far below the
limit with its new plan, he said.
Furthermore, Williams com
mends the idea of having a Palo
Alto wireless communications
plan, but the city is limited in what it
can do in that realm by federal reg
ulations. It is, however, attempting
to provide better information about
where wireless providers can locate
their antennas.
About 20 Palo Alto residents
have contacted the city planning
office in opposition to AT&T's
proposal, but around the same
amount have notified the office of
their support, said Williams.
"In Palo Alto, you've got a real
high density of smart phone users
and smart device users," said
AT&T spokesperson Lane Kas
selman. "Because of that, you have
more devices on our network, and
it makes it harder for those folks to
be able to get fast speed and main
tain connection. In order to solve
that, we must have more access

points to connect to the network."
After Monday's public hearing,
the city council will make a decision
about whether AT&T will be al
lowed to carry out its installation
plans. If the plans are approved,
AT&T will fund the entire proce
dure and will also pay $1,500 per
year to the city for the use of each
utility pole. The installation process
of the antennas is projected to take
three to four months.
The 19 new antennas have been
designated for East Palo Alto and
downtown Palo Alto, so if they are
installed, Stanford students' wire
less coverage will be minimally af
fected except for when they leave
campus to visit surrounding neigh
borhoods.
The installations would be the
first step in bigger plans AT&T has
for the area, which include the es
tablishment of 80 new antennas
total, some of which will more di
rectly affect those on the Stanford
campus.
The company claims that if its
plans are put into effect, users will
have fewer dropped calls, faster
data speeds and a noticeable im
provement in connectivity.
"These specific antennas are
called DAS [Distributed Antenna
System], and they're all around the
Bay Area," Kasselman said.
"They're a bunch of smaller anten
nas that cover a larger area without
the need to put up a bigger antenna.
This is a solution we use for neigh
borhoods where it isn't really aes
thetically pleasing to put in a large
antenna, so we put in these smaller
ones."
AT&T says it has heard from
thousands of Palo Alto residents on
the record, saying that they are in
support of the new plans.
