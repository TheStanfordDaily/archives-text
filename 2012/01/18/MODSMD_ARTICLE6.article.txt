## Calif, schools at stake in budget 
### EDWARD NGAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
California voters will face a stark choice in Novem
ber when they decide whether to approve Governor
Jerry Brown's new budget proposal, which stipulates ei
ther raising income taxes for the wealthy and temporar
ily increasing sales tax by half a percent, or eliminating
$5.3 billion from state welfare and public school expen
ditures.
Even if voters approve the tax increases, which are
expected to bring in around $35 billion over five years
according to administration estimates, Brown's propos
al would still cut nearly $1 billion each from MediCal
and CalWorks and over $1 billion from the state's pub
lic education system. If voters reject the tax increase,
however, a $5.4 billion trigger cut will be enacted, with
California children receiving the brunt of the impact;
the vast majority of the savings $4.8 billion would
be taken from K-12 education.
"[Governor Brown's proposal] either means that
voters approve new taxes, in which case we're able to
maintain the status quo, or voters reject the taxes, in
which case we make even more draconian cuts in the
education system," said David Plank, executive director
of the Stanford Policy Analysis for California Education
and professor in the School of Education. "Neither of
them is a cheerful scenario for schools because the pres
ent situation in public schools is pretty awful, given the
cuts they sustained over the past four
years."
The measure targeting education
is intended to close a $9.2 billion
shortfall in the state budget this year,
down from $26.6 billion last year. Ac
cording to Plank, these cuts are nec
essary as a result of the state govern
ment's history of fiscal mismanage
ment.
"The problem that we all face is
that we have pasted together budg
ets... that are basically optimistic
assumptions," Plank said. "Gover
nor Schwarzenegger, in his first year,
issued $l5 billion worth of bonds to
cover a deficit.Those have to be paid
back."
If voters reject Brown's tax in
crease initiative and another $4.8 bil
lion is slashed from public schools,
Plank foresees big changes in the
classroom experience for California
children.
"The estimate I've seen is that
[the trigger cut] amounts to three
weeks off the school year. You're
talking about a genuinely radical
change in the educational experi
ence," Plank said. "If the cuts go
through, we're certainly testing the
bottom of [the school spending] dis
tribution. We're headed for 50th
pretty quickly."
As a result of annual cuts over the
past several years to the state educa
tion system, California public school
districts are suffering. An Education
Week study released on Jan. 8 rated
California an "F" for school spend
ing, as the state slipped to 47th in the
nation in per-pupil spending.
But it may not even be the cut's
magnitude that troubles school ad
ministrators most.
"The greatest challenge is uncer
tainty: will the [trigger cuts] happen?
And will they be at a scale that is
what you expected?" said Kevin
Skelly, superintendent of the Palo
Alto Unified School District. "That
uncertainty makes it very difficult to
plan. It makes it very difficult to work

with bargaining salaries and benefits,
and it puts everybody on edge."
In the uncertainty over the state's
future finances, Kelly's school dis
trict is bracing for the worst.
"We have what we called struc
tural deficit: we're spending more
money than we anticipate bringing
in," Skelly said. "Fortunately, if you
look around the state, many school
districts have built up a reserve that
is there in case of these cuts. We'll
spend our reserve."
Over the last four years, the Palo
Alto Unified School District has cut
its per-student spending by over
$l,OOO. This cut, Skelly said, has a
large impact in the classroom for
both students and teachers.
"When you add more kids to
classes, you have to hire fewer teach
ers [to deal with cost challenges]," he
said. "But when the budget is 85 per
cent people, it has to come down to
the number of teachers you have.
And that has an effect on teacher
morale, teacher experience and of
ferings you can [provide] for stu
dents."
While California students are
facing a funding proposal that could
shave three weeks off their school
year, state Republicans and teach
ers' unions are blasting Brown's pro
posal, saying it uses students politi
cally in order to raise taxes.
"Clearly, there is a political ele
ment to [the proposal]," Skelly said.
"But the other piece of it is that [Gov.
Brown's] options are very limited. K
-12 education is one 0f... few."
Plank said he agrees that Gov.
Brown's options are limited, but
questioned what he called the "Re
publican intransigence on taxes"
while the two sides negotiated the
budget.
"The polling shows that voters
will approve tax increases if the taxes
go to schools, so Republicans are
saying,' [Gov. Brown] has put schools
at risk.' Well, schools have already
been hammered," Plank said. "It's
not like Republicans are defending
the children in schools; [they're] op
posing the tax increases."

will approve tax increases if the taxes
go to schools, so Republicans are
saying,' [Gov. Brown] has put schools
at risk.' Well, schools have already
been hammered," Plank said. "It's
not like Republicans are defending
the children in schools; [they're] op
posing the tax increases."

California voters will face a stark choice in Novem
ber when they decide whether to approve Governor
Jerry Brown's new budget proposal, which stipulates ei
ther raising income taxes for the wealthy and temporar
ily increasing sales tax by half a percent, or eliminating
$5.3 billion from state welfare and public school expen
ditures.
Even if voters approve the tax increases, which are
expected to bring in around $35 billion over five years
according to administration estimates, Brown's propos
al would still cut nearly $1 billion each from MediCal
and CalWorks and over $1 billion from the state's pub
lic education system. If voters reject the tax increase,
however, a $5.4 billion trigger cut will be enacted, with
California children receiving the brunt of the impact;
the vast majority of the savings $4.8 billion would
be taken from K-12 education.
"[Governor Brown's proposal] either means that
voters approve new taxes, in which case we're able to
maintain the status quo, or voters reject the taxes, in
which case we make even more draconian cuts in the
education system," said David Plank, executive director
of the Stanford Policy Analysis for California Education
and professor in the School of Education. "Neither of
them is a cheerful scenario for schools because the pres
ent situation in public schools is pretty awful, given the
cuts they sustained over the past four
years."
The measure targeting education
is intended to close a $9.2 billion
shortfall in the state budget this year,
down from $26.6 billion last year. Ac
cording to Plank, these cuts are nec
essary as a result of the state govern
ment's history of fiscal mismanage
ment.
"The problem that we all face is
that we have pasted together budg
ets... that are basically optimistic
assumptions," Plank said. "Gover
nor Schwarzenegger, in his first year,
issued $l5 billion worth of bonds to
cover a deficit.Those have to be paid
back."
If voters reject Brown's tax in
crease initiative and another $4.8 bil
lion is slashed from public schools,
Plank foresees big changes in the
classroom experience for California
children.
"The estimate I've seen is that
[the trigger cut] amounts to three
weeks off the school year. You're
talking about a genuinely radical
change in the educational experi
ence," Plank said. "If the cuts go
through, we're certainly testing the
bottom of [the school spending] dis
tribution. We're headed for 50th
pretty quickly."
As a result of annual cuts over the
past several years to the state educa
tion system, California public school
districts are suffering. An Education
Week study released on Jan. 8 rated
California an "F" for school spend
ing, as the state slipped to 47th in the
nation in per-pupil spending.
But it may not even be the cut's
magnitude that troubles school ad
ministrators most.
"The greatest challenge is uncer
tainty: will the [trigger cuts] happen?
And will they be at a scale that is
what you expected?" said Kevin
Skelly, superintendent of the Palo
Alto Unified School District. "That
uncertainty makes it very difficult to
plan. It makes it very difficult to work

with bargaining salaries and benefits,
and it puts everybody on edge."
In the uncertainty over the state's
future finances, Kelly's school dis
trict is bracing for the worst.
"We have what we called struc
tural deficit: we're spending more
money than we anticipate bringing
in," Skelly said. "Fortunately, if you
look around the state, many school
districts have built up a reserve that
is there in case of these cuts. We'll
spend our reserve."
Over the last four years, the Palo
Alto Unified School District has cut
its per-student spending by over
$l,OOO. This cut, Skelly said, has a
large impact in the classroom for
both students and teachers.
"When you add more kids to
classes, you have to hire fewer teach
ers [to deal with cost challenges]," he
said. "But when the budget is 85 per
cent people, it has to come down to
the number of teachers you have.
And that has an effect on teacher
morale, teacher experience and of
ferings you can [provide] for stu
dents."
While California students are
facing a funding proposal that could
shave three weeks off their school
year, state Republicans and teach
ers' unions are blasting Brown's pro
posal, saying it uses students politi
cally in order to raise taxes.
"Clearly, there is a political ele
ment to [the proposal]," Skelly said.
"But the other piece of it is that [Gov.
Brown's] options are very limited. K
-12 education is one 0f... few."
Plank said he agrees that Gov.
Brown's options are limited, but
questioned what he called the "Re
publican intransigence on taxes"
while the two sides negotiated the
budget.
"The polling shows that voters
will approve tax increases if the taxes
go to schools, so Republicans are
saying,' [Gov. Brown] has put schools
at risk.' Well, schools have already
been hammered," Plank said. "It's
not like Republicans are defending
