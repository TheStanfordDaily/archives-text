The ASSU Senate kicked off its meet
ing Tuesday with the introduction of Lina
Hidalgo 'l3, the new ASSU Executive
Chief of Staff nominated by ASSU Presi
dent Michael Cruz 'l2 and Vice President
Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3.
Former ASSU Executive Chief of Staff
Emma Ogiemwanye 'l2 stepped down
after choosing to go abroad winter quarter
this year.
"The different initiatives the cabinets
are pursuing are geared toward bringing
campus together," said Hidalgo, who an
swered questions from Senators for sever
al minutes at the meeting.
"The platform of the ASSU is an unbi
ased avenue to promote goals of student
groups," Hidalgo said, adding that she
aims to continue promoting student
groups on campus and follow through on
several initiatives already started prior to
her appointment.

or six applicants applied to the position,
draft of new governing docu
ments and hope to show a private
draft to administrators and Sena
tors sometime in the next week.
Cruz said he believes a public
version will be available within
the month.
Cruz said the new governing
documents are significantly
shorter than the current ones, es
timating their length to be rough
ly 100 pages.
Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4
raised concerns over the docu
ments, especially about how Sen
ators would be able to adequate

ly judge any changes or differ
ences between the two versions.
However, Cruz assured Elhanan
that it would be a smooth
process.
"I wouldn't go so far as saying
the content was the same, but
anyone who was familiar with
the ASSU will be able to recog
nize the documents," Cruz said.
Senators also briefly dis
cussed the Division of Internal
Review (DIR). The Senate had
previously grilled Andrew
Aguilar 'l4, head of the DIR, for
failing to gain access to financial
information and failing to prop
erly communicate with the Sen
ate.
According to Macgregor-
Dennis, this contentious ex
change at a previous Senate

meeting was dissuading Aguilar
from coming in again.
"Andrew is wary of having
communication with the Senate
given past communication,"
Macgregor-Dennis told the gov
erning body.
Senate involvement with the
DIR will continue, however, and
the appropriations committee
plans to review a controversial
ASSU buffer fund to further ex
plore the sustainability of the
fund. Chair of the appropriations
committee Brianna Pang 'l3 said
she was working with Aguilar to
write a report on the fund and to
determine what its proper use
will be in the future.
