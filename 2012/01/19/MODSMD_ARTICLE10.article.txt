# DO'S AND DOO-DOO'S
## Fears 
### Chase Ishii 
Fear is defined by Diction
ary.com as "a distressing
emotion aroused by impend
ing danger, evil, pain, etc., whether
the threat is real or imagined."
("Classic use of a definition as an
opening hook. You've got 'em
suckered in now, Chase!") If we
were playing an icebreaker game
and you asked me what was my
biggest fear, I would first make a
joke about how awful of an ice
breaker game this was and then
probably answer, "bald people."
("And you just lost 'em. Nice job.
Chase.")

I understand this fear is com
pletely irrational. Most bald peo
ple I've met have been pleasant
and not threatening. I don't know
what type of danger they may
pose. I don't even know if "bald" is
the politically correct terminology.
(Maybe they prefer "hair-follically
challenged?" I'm getting angry
emails either way.) Honestly, I
don't even know that many bald
people. (That's a much better ice
breaker game! Make a list of all
the bald people you know. Extra
points if they are in the room!)

All I know is that whenever I
see a bald person, I think of that
scene from The Mummy when
High Priest Imhotep opens up his
mouth and millions of bugs fly
out, and the eight-year-old inside
me starts to cry. (Metaphor alert:
there is not actually an eight-year
old inside of me.)
That long and slightly (or very)
obnoxious ramble was to demon
strate that in order to face our
fears, we must first identify them.
We may do our best to not think
about our fears because that re
quires admitting they exist. (Fear
of fears? Meta!) But it is impor
tant to be aware of what we fear.

It allows us to understand ways in
which we have been crippled or
controlled by our fears, and most
importantly, it reveals our true
values. And that brings us to this
week's advice:
DO: Know your fear.
DOO-DOO: Hide from your
fear.
Without properly understand
ing our fears, we are more prone
to being controlled and held cap
tive by them. (If you replace
"fears" in that sentence with "ro
bots with lasers," this article gets
much more interesting.) As men
tioned in past articles, I entered
Stanford with a negative percep
tion of Stanford students and cul
ture. I imagined everyone to be
the rich, pompous elitists so ex
pertly portrayed by the satirical
Twitter handle @stanford-
DOUCHE. (I had a good laugh
when someone sent this to me. If I
understood the Twitter, I would
follow or subscribe or twit-attack
or whatever it is that you do on
the Twitter.)
I was so scared of being
lumped into this negative image
(which doesn't even really exist)
that I actively went out of my way
to be perceived as "non-Stanford"
as possible. (For the first half of
freshman year, when people
asked where I went to school, I
would answer "a small school up
north," and when I then had to an
swer "Stanford" to their follow-up
question, I looked like the preten
tious asshole I was so afraid of
being.) Worse, I missed out on a
lot of the opportunities provided
by the school.
We can also be crippled by our
fears. I've talked to plenty of stu
dents who are stressed about
choosing their majors. (There's
that less-than-half-truth floating

around that your major deter
mines your job, which determines
the rest of your life.) At the root of
their indecision were different
types and degrees of fear. "I'm
scared I might make the wrong de
cision" actually means "I'm scared
I may not have a job," or "I'm
scared of what my parents will
say," or "I'm scared I won't enjoy
it" or any combination of any other
possibilities. Especially at a place
like Stanford, hyper-concerned
with researching and knowing the
facts before making a decision,
these fears can be paralyzing.
I've recently been exploring
the possibility of co-terming in ...
something. Only more recently
did I identify this false ambition as
a response to my fear of failing as
a screenwriter. It's a tough indus
try, and if I don't make it, I would
at least have a degree to fall back
on (besides the religious studies
degree that I know EVERY com
pany is looking for). Identifying
this fear of failure doesn't make it
disappear, but it does allow me to
consider the situation more fully.
What do I value more: security
and stability or creativity and pas
sion? And is it worth the risk of
failure?
Take some time this week and
ask yourself, "What am I so afraid
of? And why? And is it worth the
risk?"

Are you scared of emailing Chase
at ninjaish@stanford.edu? Don't
be. (Well, only if you look a lot like
Kate Beckinsale. Bald people and
everyone else, don't waste your
time.)

pletely irrational. Most bald peo
ple I've met have been pleasant
and not threatening. I don't know
what type of danger they may
pose. I don't even know if "bald" is
the politically correct terminology.
(Maybe they prefer "hair-follically
challenged?" I'm getting angry
emails either way.) Honestly, I
don't even know that many bald
people. (That's a much better ice
breaker game! Make a list of all
the bald people you know. Extra
points if they are in the room!)

All I know is that whenever I
see a bald person, I think of that
scene from The Mummy when
High Priest Imhotep opens up his
mouth and millions of bugs fly
out, and the eight-year-old inside
me starts to cry. (Metaphor alert:
there is not actually an eight-year
old inside of me.)
That long and slightly (or very)
obnoxious ramble was to demon
strate that in order to face our
fears, we must first identify them.
We may do our best to not think
about our fears because that re
quires admitting they exist. (Fear
of fears? Meta!) But it is impor
tant to be aware of what we fear.

It allows us to understand ways in
which we have been crippled or
controlled by our fears, and most
importantly, it reveals our true
values. And that brings us to this
week's advice:
DO: Know your fear.
DOO-DOO: Hide from your
fear.
Without properly understand
ing our fears, we are more prone
to being controlled and held cap
tive by them. (If you replace
"fears" in that sentence with "ro
bots with lasers," this article gets
much more interesting.) As men
tioned in past articles, I entered
Stanford with a negative percep
tion of Stanford students and cul
ture. I imagined everyone to be
the rich, pompous elitists so ex
pertly portrayed by the satirical
Twitter handle @stanford-
DOUCHE. (I had a good laugh
when someone sent this to me. If I
understood the Twitter, I would
follow or subscribe or twit-attack
or whatever it is that you do on
the Twitter.)
I was so scared of being
lumped into this negative image
(which doesn't even really exist)
that I actively went out of my way
to be perceived as "non-Stanford"
as possible. (For the first half of
freshman year, when people
asked where I went to school, I
would answer "a small school up
north," and when I then had to an
swer "Stanford" to their follow-up
question, I looked like the preten
tious asshole I was so afraid of
being.) Worse, I missed out on a
lot of the opportunities provided
by the school.
We can also be crippled by our
fears. I've talked to plenty of stu
dents who are stressed about
choosing their majors. (There's
that less-than-half-truth floating

around that your major deter
mines your job, which determines
the rest of your life.) At the root of
their indecision were different
types and degrees of fear. "I'm
scared I might make the wrong de
cision" actually means "I'm scared
I may not have a job," or "I'm
scared of what my parents will
say," or "I'm scared I won't enjoy
it" or any combination of any other
possibilities. Especially at a place
like Stanford, hyper-concerned
with researching and knowing the
facts before making a decision,
these fears can be paralyzing.
I've recently been exploring
the possibility of co-terming in ...
something. Only more recently
did I identify this false ambition as
a response to my fear of failing as
a screenwriter. It's a tough indus
try, and if I don't make it, I would
at least have a degree to fall back
on (besides the religious studies
degree that I know EVERY com
pany is looking for). Identifying
this fear of failure doesn't make it
disappear, but it does allow me to
consider the situation more fully.
What do I value more: security
and stability or creativity and pas
sion? And is it worth the risk of
failure?
Take some time this week and
ask yourself, "What am I so afraid
of? And why? And is it worth the
risk?"

Are you scared of emailing Chase
at ninjaish@stanford.edu? Don't
be. (Well, only if you look a lot like
Kate Beckinsale. Bald people and
everyone else, don't waste your
time.)

Fear is defined by Diction
ary.com as "a distressing
emotion aroused by impend
ing danger, evil, pain, etc., whether
the threat is real or imagined."
("Classic use of a definition as an
opening hook. You've got 'em
suckered in now, Chase!") If we
were playing an icebreaker game
and you asked me what was my
biggest fear, I would first make a
joke about how awful of an ice
breaker game this was and then
probably answer, "bald people."
("And you just lost 'em. Nice job.
