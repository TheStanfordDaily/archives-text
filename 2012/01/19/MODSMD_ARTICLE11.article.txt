## NEWS FEATURE LEAVING IRAQ Veterans at Stanford reflect on U.S. withdrawal 
### ADRIENNE VON SCHULTHESS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Dec.ls, the United States
officially ended the Iraq
War, withdrawing the last
U.S. forces over the Kuwaiti
border. At the peak of the
U.S. engagement, 170,000 U.S. troops
were stationed in Iraq; now, only 157 sol
diers and a small number of Marines re
main.
The exit, after over eight and a half
years of engagement, left 4,485 Ameri
can service members dead, according to
the New York Times.
As the future of Iraq hangs in the bal
ance, Stanford service members reflect
ed on the Iraq withdrawal.
Corporal Gavriel Jacobs J.D. 'l3
served two combat tours in Iraq as a tank
crewman. On his second tour in 2007, he
was wounded by an lED ambush.
"Success in Iraq is not something you
can put a price tag on," Jacobs said. "I feel
that we have done a disservice, by pulling
out as fast as we have, to the effort that
we have all put in."
"We put so much time, energy and
blood into that country," he added. "You
really want it to be successful; you want
all the things you did to be worth some
thing, to have a happy ending."
At the same time, "if the Iraqis tell us
they want us to leave, there may only be
so much we can do," he said.
The departure came much later than

the Bush Administration publicly pre
dicted. As BBC News reported in 2003,
former Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld said combat operation in Iraq
"could last six days, six weeks. I doubt six
months."
"The fundamental mistake was not
understanding how significant a political
disruption removing that regime was,"
said Colonel Charlie Miller, visiting fel
low at the Center for International Secu
rity and Cooperation (CISAC), who
served two tours in Iraq and was White
House director for Iraq.
"I am not sure we had a good grasp on
how long it would take them to work
through the political system," he said.
The current Iraqi government is
based on a fragile power-sharing agree
ment, and Miller hopes for a "continued
balance of power among the different
sects and ethnicities."
This setup was tested just a day after
U.S. troops left Iraq. On Dec. 19, Iraq's
Higher Judicial Council issued an arrest
warrant for Vice President Tariq al-
Hashimi, the highest-ranking Sunni offi
cial in Iraq, for organizing hit squads and
bombings. He promptly accused Shia
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of
trumping up the charges and then fled to
Kurdistan, where he resides as of Jan. 2.
Despite political complications, some
veterans believe the Iraqi army will be
able to support a stable government.
Sergeant Chris Clark 'l2 served two
tours in Iraq ending in 2007 as a member
of the Marine Corps Reconnaissance
Unit.

In 2005, the Iraqi army "couldn't con
duct the most basic military operations
let alone be able to provide security at
any reasonable level for the entire coun
try," Clark said. By 2007, "they had vastly
improved in their capabilities."
Given the progress that he saw in two
years, Clark is willing to "defer to the mil
itary leadership's opinion that Iraq is ca
pable of providing their own security."
Navy Lieutenant lan Aucoin J.D. 'l4
goes further, suggesting that the U.S. mil
itary's withdrawal is necessary to speed
up the improvement in the Iraqi mili
tary's capabilities.
Aucoin served as a combat engineer
in Iraq from 2008 to 2009. He was in Iraq
when he heard about the full details of
the exit plan in 2008.
"My initial reaction was that we had
hit a plateau in what we were able to do
over there in terms of establishing secu
rity, and it was time to turn things over to
the Iraqi government," he said.
"As long as American forces are still
there and [lraqis] are relying on them for
not just military tactical aid but for logis
tical aid ... there is not as much incen
tive to develop those resources and capa
bilities on [their] own," he added.
Captain Anne Hsieh J.D. 'l2, who

joined the army in 2001 and was de
ployed to Iraq from 2005 to 2006, ex
pressed concerns that progress gained in
Iraq could be "easily erased."
"Most of us who've been out there, we
try to think in terms of what it means for
the Iraqis; and I'm really not sure what it's
going to look like without a U.S. pres
ence," Hsieh said.
The fear of regression cuts deeply be
cause of the many sacrifices given to get
Iraq to this point.
"I don't think the Iraqi people have a
strong sense of confidence that in the fu
ture the government will be able to sur
vive different political and security chal
lenges," said Marine Captain Gabriel
Ledeen J.D. 'l2, who served two tours in
Iraq between 2006 and 2008.
Despite his fears, Ledeen is optimistic.
"Under Saddam [Hussein] they didn't
have a chance for the future, they knew
that the future would be just as miserable
as the present," he said. "There was not
hope that they could have an impact on
their children's lives, and now they have
the opportunity. So I would hope that if
things start to slide back, the Iraqi people
would stand up and not let that happen."
The possibility for a better future for
Iraqis is what many veterans at Stanford
consider the legacy of U.S. troops in Iraq.
"The memories of those we have lost
echoes with every vote that is cast, every
decision made by political deliberation
and every child who grows up freer than
their parents," wrote Sergeant William
Treseder 'l2, a U.S. Marine Corps Iraq
and Afghanistan veteran, in an email to
The Daily.
Ledeen described how on his second
deployment from 2007 to 2008, his unit
worked with Iraqis who led a project that
reopened the market center of a town
called Al-Karmah.
"All of a sudden, this was an area that
was functioning again," Ledeen said.
"They knew how to live, how to do their
stuff they just needed a place to do it
and the security ... [so] they could bring
in crops from the field without being shot
at or without someone from al-Qaeda in
Iraq cutting off their hands because they
were selling cucumbers and tomatoes."
Iraq also has resources that may pro

vide an economic lifeline.
"Iraqis are going to have sufficient
revenue from their oil [fields]... as they
develop those and the infrastructure to
better extract [oil] and export [it]," Miller
said. "They are going to have plenty of
money to pour into their public services
and people."
This independence could come at a
cost for the United States, as Colonel Joe
Felter Ph.D. 'O5, a senior research fellow
at CISAC who served in both Iraq and

Afghanistan, argued.
"Prime Minster al-Maliki has domes
tic constituent interests that are not per
fectly aligned with ours," he said. "As we
leave, you are going to see they are going
to make decisions based on their nation
al interests and domestic politics."
Yet Marine Corps Captain Sam Jacob
son J.D. '14, called the focus on the with
drawal itself "misguided."
"The military troops are leaving, but it
is not the end by any means," he said. "It
is important for us to remember that on
Jan. 1, Iraqis will be dying ... We espe
cially need to remember [that] the war
continues, not for us but for somebody."
"The war goes on in other ways, and
we need to be aware of this," he added.
"That is what it means to be engaged cit
izens in a participatory democracy."
