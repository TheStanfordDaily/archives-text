## IS THERE LIFE AFTER LUCK? 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
For the diehard college football fan, there
are only two seasons: football season and the
worst seven months of the year (not includ
ing National Signing Day).
So while the dust hasn't even settled from
the Stanford football team's shootout in the
Fiesta Bowl, it's never too early to start look
ing ahead to 2012 and see just who will be
suiting up for the Cardinal on Sept. 1 against
San Jose State,
This week, as the first half of a two-part
2012 preview, we'll take a look at the Stan
ford offense.
The first order of business for David Shaw
and the offense is, of course, to find a replace
ment for Andrew Luck, but the Cardinal has
much bigger issues than just replacing their

Heisman-caliber quarterback. Four of the
Cardinal's offensive starters from 2011 could
have their names called in the first round of
the NFL Draft in April Luck, tight end
Coby Fleener and offensive linemen
Jonathan Martin and David DeCastro so
there will be plenty of holes to fill.
The heir to Luck's throne as starting quar
terback is most likely sophomore Brett Not
tingham, who was Luck's primary backup
this season and played in garbage time sever
al different times during 2011. Rivals.com
ranked Nottingham as the country's fourth
best pro-style quarterback coming out of
high school interestingly, Luck was also
rated the number four pro-style quarterback
when he came to Stanford.
But despite earning the backup spot this
season, Nottingham isn't assured of winning
the job, and he will have to fend off a slew of

talented suitors if he wants to start the season
under center. Juniors Robbie Picazo and
Josh Nunes both have experience in the Car
dinal offense as three-year backups, and
freshmen Evan Crower and Kevin Hogan
will bring their size (both are over 6-foot-4)
and athleticism to the open quarterback
competition.
After quarterback, the Cardinal's next
biggest point of concern has to be the offen
sive line. After replacing three departing
starters last season, the Cardinal will now
have to replace its two most talented starters
in 2012. Center Sam Schwartzstein, tackle
Cameron Fleming and experienced starters
Kevin Danser and David Yankey can cer
tainly be expected to grab positions along the
line after playing a substantial amount in
2012, but there is still one position that isn't
totally clear at this point. Junior Khalil

Wilkes could fill in somewhere after chal
lenging for the starting center job last year,
and the Cardinal also will bring in a top
notch recruiting class of linemen. Right now,
Stanford has three four-star linemen com
mitted to come play on the Farm next year
Nick Davidson, Graham Shuler and Bran
don Fanaika and five-star tackle Kyle
Murphy, who is still deciding between Stan
ford, USC, Oregon and Florida, could also
join in the battle for the two open spots.
Whoever ends up along the offensive line
will end up blocking for an extremely talent
ed group of running backs though, where the
Cardinal could have a dominant four-pack of
runners. Junior Stepfan Taylor will be going
for his third consecutive 1,000-yard rushing
season, junior Tyler Gaffney could still steer

After completing a second-straight 11 -win season, the Stanford football team now must replace six starters on the offensive side of the ball, including quarterback Andrew Luck.
the "Wildcat" offense if he doesn't
decide to play professional base
ball, sophomore Anthony Wilker
son will undoubtedly get more
playing time and incoming fresh
man Barry Sanders will bring his
4.3 speed to the backfield as well.
Together, this group of runners
could go a long way toward easing
the transition for the Cardinal's
new starting quarterback, especial
ly with the with the ... wide open
competition on the outsides.
Receiver will be another major
point of concern for the Cardinal
offense next year, as seniors Griff
Whalen and Chris Owusu have
both used up their eligibility. This
will be the second year in a row that
Stanford will have to replace its top
two receivers (after Doug Baldwin
and Ryan Whalen both departed to
the NFL), but there is a major lack
of experience among this upcoming
group of pass-catchers.
Freshman Ty Montgomery is
the clear top dog after his breakout
2011 season (he was the Cardinal's
leading receiver in the Fiesta Bowl
with 120 yards and a touchdown),
while juniors Drew Terrell and
Jamal Rashad-Patterson both got
some playing time this season.
After that, though, most of the re
ceivers on the Stanford depth chart
have yet to see the field. However,
the Cardinal will be able count on
their tight ends will alleviate the
lack of depth out wide.

Junior Zach Ertz and redshirt
sophomore Levine Toilolo both re
turn to the Farm after big seasons
in 2011, and they will certainly help
provide some instant stability for

the offense. The two combined for
10 touchdowns despite some in
jury problems during the year, and
so long as both can stay healthy,
they could easily be Stanford's top
two receivers next season.
Perhaps the most important
piece of the puzzle for the Cardinal
will be the coaching staff, though,
as it will likely look exactly the
same as 2011. After the coaching
transition from Jim Harbaugh to
David Shaw last season, there was
a lot of coaching turnover of
fensive coordinator Greg Roman
also skipped over to the 49ers
and Shaw had to assemble his own
new offensive staff, including of
fensive coordinator Pep Hamilton
and run game coordinator Mike
Bloomgren.
After engineering a red zone
offense that was the best in the na
tion in 2011, Hamilton has report
edly been contacted about taking
over the offense for the Alabama
Crimson Tide, but it's not known if
Hamilton is seriously considering
the move. The Tide has won two
national championships in the last
three years and is looking to re
place Jim McElwain, who left to
become the head coach at Col
orado State.
Altogether, with Stanford's re
cent success turning out top-tier
talent and a top-20 recruiting class
coming in, the Cardinal might be in
good position to continue its offen
sive success, even though it will
have to replace six critical starters.
But on the whole, it's clear to see
that Stanford still has some serious
questions to address before the
2012 kickoff â€”questions that go
much deeper than just the loss of
Andrew Luck to the NFL.

as it will likely look exactly the
same as 2011. After the coaching
transition from Jim Harbaugh to
David Shaw last season, there was
a lot of coaching turnover of
fensive coordinator Greg Roman
also skipped over to the 49ers
and Shaw had to assemble his own
new offensive staff, including of
fensive coordinator Pep Hamilton
and run game coordinator Mike
Bloomgren.
After engineering a red zone
offense that was the best in the na
tion in 2011, Hamilton has report
edly been contacted about taking
over the offense for the Alabama
Crimson Tide, but it's not known if
Hamilton is seriously considering
the move. The Tide has won two
national championships in the last
three years and is looking to re
place Jim McElwain, who left to
become the head coach at Col
orado State.
Altogether, with Stanford's re
cent success turning out top-tier
talent and a top-20 recruiting class
coming in, the Cardinal might be in
good position to continue its offen
sive success, even though it will
have to replace six critical starters.
But on the whole, it's clear to see
that Stanford still has some serious
questions to address before the
2012 kickoff â€”questions that go
much deeper than just the loss of
Andrew Luck to the NFL.

For the diehard college football fan, there
are only two seasons: football season and the
worst seven months of the year (not includ
ing National Signing Day).
So while the dust hasn't even settled from
the Stanford football team's shootout in the
Fiesta Bowl, it's never too early to start look
ing ahead to 2012 and see just who will be
suiting up for the Cardinal on Sept. 1 against
San Jose State,
This week, as the first half of a two-part
2012 preview, we'll take a look at the Stan
ford offense.
The first order of business for David Shaw
and the offense is, of course, to find a replace
ment for Andrew Luck, but the Cardinal has
much bigger issues than just replacing their

Heisman-caliber quarterback. Four of the
Cardinal's offensive starters from 2011 could
have their names called in the first round of
the NFL Draft in April Luck, tight end
Coby Fleener and offensive linemen
Jonathan Martin and David DeCastro so
there will be plenty of holes to fill.
The heir to Luck's throne as starting quar
terback is most likely sophomore Brett Not
tingham, who was Luck's primary backup
this season and played in garbage time sever
al different times during 2011. Rivals.com
ranked Nottingham as the country's fourth
best pro-style quarterback coming out of
high school interestingly, Luck was also
rated the number four pro-style quarterback
when he came to Stanford.
But despite earning the backup spot this
season, Nottingham isn't assured of winning
the job, and he will have to fend off a slew of

talented suitors if he wants to start the season
under center. Juniors Robbie Picazo and
Josh Nunes both have experience in the Car
dinal offense as three-year backups, and
freshmen Evan Crower and Kevin Hogan
will bring their size (both are over 6-foot-4)
and athleticism to the open quarterback
competition.
After quarterback, the Cardinal's next
biggest point of concern has to be the offen
sive line. After replacing three departing
starters last season, the Cardinal will now
have to replace its two most talented starters
in 2012. Center Sam Schwartzstein, tackle
Cameron Fleming and experienced starters
Kevin Danser and David Yankey can cer
tainly be expected to grab positions along the
line after playing a substantial amount in
2012, but there is still one position that isn't
totally clear at this point. Junior Khalil

Wilkes could fill in somewhere after chal
lenging for the starting center job last year,
and the Cardinal also will bring in a top
notch recruiting class of linemen. Right now,
Stanford has three four-star linemen com
mitted to come play on the Farm next year
Nick Davidson, Graham Shuler and Bran
don Fanaika and five-star tackle Kyle
Murphy, who is still deciding between Stan
ford, USC, Oregon and Florida, could also
join in the battle for the two open spots.
Whoever ends up along the offensive line
will end up blocking for an extremely talent
ed group of running backs though, where the
Cardinal could have a dominant four-pack of
runners. Junior Stepfan Taylor will be going
for his third consecutive 1,000-yard rushing
season, junior Tyler Gaffney could still steer

After completing a second-straight 11 -win season, the Stanford football team now must replace six starters on the offensive side of the ball, including quarterback Andrew Luck.
the "Wildcat" offense if he doesn't
decide to play professional base
ball, sophomore Anthony Wilker
son will undoubtedly get more
playing time and incoming fresh
man Barry Sanders will bring his
4.3 speed to the backfield as well.
Together, this group of runners
could go a long way toward easing
the transition for the Cardinal's
new starting quarterback, especial
ly with the with the ... wide open
competition on the outsides.
Receiver will be another major
point of concern for the Cardinal
offense next year, as seniors Griff
Whalen and Chris Owusu have
both used up their eligibility. This
will be the second year in a row that
Stanford will have to replace its top
two receivers (after Doug Baldwin
and Ryan Whalen both departed to
the NFL), but there is a major lack
of experience among this upcoming
group of pass-catchers.
Freshman Ty Montgomery is
the clear top dog after his breakout
2011 season (he was the Cardinal's
leading receiver in the Fiesta Bowl
with 120 yards and a touchdown),
while juniors Drew Terrell and
Jamal Rashad-Patterson both got
some playing time this season.
After that, though, most of the re
ceivers on the Stanford depth chart
have yet to see the field. However,
the Cardinal will be able count on
their tight ends will alleviate the
lack of depth out wide.

Junior Zach Ertz and redshirt
sophomore Levine Toilolo both re
turn to the Farm after big seasons
in 2011, and they will certainly help
provide some instant stability for

the offense. The two combined for
10 touchdowns despite some in
jury problems during the year, and
so long as both can stay healthy,
they could easily be Stanford's top
two receivers next season.

will be the coaching staff, though,
