## IS THERE LIFE AFTER LUCK? 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
For the diehard college football fan, there
are only two seasons: football season and the
worst seven months of the year (not includ
ing National Signing Day).
So while the dust hasn't even settled from
the Stanford football team's shootout in the
Fiesta Bowl, it's never too early to start look
ing ahead to 2012 and see just who will be
suiting up for the Cardinal on Sept. 1 against
San Jose State,
This week, as the first half of a two-part
2012 preview, we'll take a look at the Stan
ford offense.
The first order of business for David Shaw
and the offense is, of course, to find a replace
ment for Andrew Luck, but the Cardinal has
much bigger issues than just replacing their

Heisman-caliber quarterback. Four of the
Cardinal's offensive starters from 2011 could
have their names called in the first round of
the NFL Draft in April Luck, tight end
Coby Fleener and offensive linemen
Jonathan Martin and David DeCastro so
there will be plenty of holes to fill.
The heir to Luck's throne as starting quar
terback is most likely sophomore Brett Not
tingham, who was Luck's primary backup
this season and played in garbage time sever
al different times during 2011. Rivals.com
ranked Nottingham as the country's fourth
best pro-style quarterback coming out of
high school interestingly, Luck was also
rated the number four pro-style quarterback
when he came to Stanford.
But despite earning the backup spot this
season, Nottingham isn't assured of winning
the job, and he will have to fend off a slew of

talented suitors if he wants to start the season
under center. Juniors Robbie Picazo and
Josh Nunes both have experience in the Car
dinal offense as three-year backups, and
freshmen Evan Crower and Kevin Hogan
will bring their size (both are over 6-foot-4)
and athleticism to the open quarterback
competition.
After quarterback, the Cardinal's next
biggest point of concern has to be the offen
sive line. After replacing three departing
starters last season, the Cardinal will now
have to replace its two most talented starters
in 2012. Center Sam Schwartzstein, tackle
Cameron Fleming and experienced starters
Kevin Danser and David Yankey can cer
tainly be expected to grab positions along the
line after playing a substantial amount in
2012, but there is still one position that isn't
totally clear at this point. Junior Khalil

Wilkes could fill in somewhere after chal
lenging for the starting center job last year,
and the Cardinal also will bring in a top
notch recruiting class of linemen. Right now,
Stanford has three four-star linemen com
mitted to come play on the Farm next year
Nick Davidson, Graham Shuler and Bran
don Fanaika and five-star tackle Kyle
Murphy, who is still deciding between Stan
ford, USC, Oregon and Florida, could also
join in the battle for the two open spots.
Whoever ends up along the offensive line
will end up blocking for an extremely talent
ed group of running backs though, where the
Cardinal could have a dominant four-pack of
runners. Junior Stepfan Taylor will be going
for his third consecutive 1,000-yard rushing
season, junior Tyler Gaffney could still steer

After completing a second-straight 11 -win season, the Stanford football team now must replace six starters on the offensive side of the ball, including quarterback Andrew Luck.
