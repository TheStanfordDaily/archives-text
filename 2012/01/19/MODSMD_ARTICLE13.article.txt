# NORTH AND NORTHWEST
## Washington schools up next 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
This weekend, the Stanford
men's basketball team will travel
north to begin its longest road
stretch of the season, a two-week
trip away from Maples that
opens this weekend in Washing
ton and concludes at California
on Jan. 29. The Cardinal (13-3,5-
1 Pac-12) looks to overcome its
road woes and continue its hot
start against a struggling Wash
ington State team (9-8, 1-4)
tonight.
"It's always a tough trip," said
head coach Johnny Dawkins on
the upcoming weekend in Wash
ington, "but we view every trip in
the Pac-12 as tough. They're all
good teams, they all have terrific
coaches. We want to make it dif
ficult on their home floors."
Last season, the Cardinal split
the series with the Cougars, with
each team winning on the road.
However, this year's matchup
will look quite different, as both
squads' leading scorers Stan
ford's Jeremy Green and Wash
ington State's Klay Thompson
left school early to pursue
professional careers.
However, one familiar foe
will be senior guard Faisal Aden,
who put up 20 points in last sea
son's loss to the Cougars at
Maples Pavilion. This season,
Aden is averaging 13.1 points
per game, second best on his
team, and leads the Cougars in
steals with 20.
In Thompson's absence, jun
ior forward Brock Motum has
emerged as a threat for the
Cougars on both ends of the
floor, leading the team in scoring
with 15.4 points per game and re
bounding with 6.1 per game. In
the Cougars' lone conference
win over Oregon State on Dec.
31st, Motum contributed 26 of
the team's 81 points and grabbed
eight rebounds.
Freshman guard DaVonte
Lacy, the third-leading scorer
with 9.8 points per game, will be
yet another offensive weapon

for Washington State, particular
ly as the Cougars' strongest
three-point shooter.
The Cardinal, which has tra
ditionally struggled away from
its home court, notched an im
portant four-overtime victory at
Oregon State in its most recent
road game an experience that
Dawkins thinks has made his
young team better.
"You can't practice what we
went through that night,"
Dawkins said. "To have four
overtimes, I mean basically what
you had is five end-game situa
tions you had your regulation
end-game and your four over

time end-games. And to put a
young man in that kind of envi
ronment â€” first of all, on the
road and then having the op
portunity to play through those
situations period after period, it
can only help you grow."
For the Cardinal, redshirt
senior Josh Owens continues to
be a strong low-post presence,
leading the team in both points
and rebounds, while sophomore
forward Josh Huestis has
stepped into a bigger role, partic
ularly on the glass, in recent
weeks.

it heads north to take on Washington and Washington State.
day's game against Colorado
when she only pulled down nine
rebounds to go with her 15 points.
Last week against Oregon and
Oregon State, Ogwumike put up
32 and 33 points on the Ducks and
Beavers, respectively.
In addition to Nnemkadi Og
wumike s powerful play, younger
sister Chiney Ogwumike has also
kept up a prolific pace, as she has
reeled off six straight double-dou
bles of her own. In addition, the
Ogwumikes production has been
complemented by the play of
guard Toni Kokenis lately, as the
sophomore has had 13,19 and 19
points in her last three outings.
Washington State won't be
able to challenge Stanford's sister
duo down low and looks to be
heavily overmatched, as the
Cougars don't boast a single play
er who averages double-digit
scoring guards Jazmine
Perkins and Ireti Amojo are tied
for the team lead with an average
of nine points per game.
The Cardinal then welcomes
the Washington Huskies (10-5,2-
3) to Maples on Saturday, and the
Dawgs could present far bigger
problems for Stanford.
The Huskies only average 65.2
points per game, seventh in the
Pac-12, well behind the Cardinal s
80.1 points per game easily the
most in the conference, but Wash
ington does have a dynamic and
effective one-two scoring punch.
Six-foot-three senior center
Regina Rogers leads the squad
with 16.2 points per game, and
freshman point guard Jazmine
Davis contributes 13.6 points per
game, and the two could combine
to help neutralize the three-head
ed monster that the Ogwumikes
and Kokenis have been recently.
Additionally, the Huskies play
ferocious defense, holding oppo
nents to just a .330 shooting per
centage from the floor. That could
pose problems for a Stanford
team that came out a little too ca
sually against Oregon State at
home two weeks ago, shooting
just 36.4 percent in a 67-60 victory

against the Beavers.
After that sluggish perform
ance, though, the Cardinal has
dominated its last two games, and,
if history is any indication, it

shouldn't have too many prob
lems continuing its 71-game

home win-streak.
The Cardinal and the Cougars
tip off at 7 p.m. tonight at Maples
Pavilion.

Senior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike (above) has been a force on the
glass and on the scoreboard lately, with five double-doubles in her last
six games. The No. 4 Cardinal welcome the Washington schools to the
