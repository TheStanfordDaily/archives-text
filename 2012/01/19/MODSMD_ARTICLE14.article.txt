# Get ready for Stanford baseball
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
Don't sleep on Stanford
baseball. While the
campus may just be
starting to catch foot
ball fever thanks to
Andrew Luck and company, every
year there are several other sports
that fly under the radar with only A1
Davis' famous mantra: just win,
baby.
Just yesterday, I ran into a class
mate who was lamenting the cam
pus's lack of attention to the mid
major college sports, like baseball.
And although I disagree strongly
that any sport here is "mid-major"
and could spend thousands of words
talking about any one of Stanford's
NCAA title contenders with 101
national championships, the Farm
has gotten used to winning a lot
I'd like to turn today's attention to
the baseball diamond, where coach
Mark Marquess' team is turning
heads with a collection of major
league talent that hasn't been seen at
the Sunken Diamond in several
years.

There's no need to bury the
headline here the Cardinal has
likely the top pitcher in the collegiate
ranks this season in junior Mark
Appel and features a lineup built for
scoring runs with two other likely
first-round draft picks in classmates
Kenny Diekroeger and Stephen Pis
cotty.
So in honor of that trio of presea
son All-Americans which is al
ready earning points for No. 3 Stan
ford with the pollsters in Collegiate
Baseball's Preseason rankings I
have thought of three reasons why
you should not sleep on Stanford
baseball this season.
Reason No. 1: After shortstop
Diekroeger and third baseman Pis
cotty, the lineup is looking pretty
damn good.
Piscotty led the Cardinal with a

.364 average and was an All-Pac-10
selection last season, while Dieko
roeger hit .356 and was a Freshman
All-American in 2010. But Stanford
also boasts two more two-year re
turning starters in outfielders Jake
Stewart and Tyler Gaffney and fea
tures three sophomores who started
in 2011 Brian Ragira, Austin Wil
son and Lonnie Kauppila.
Short of preseason No. 1 Florida,
Stanford ought to score runs in big
ger bunches than any other team in
the country. Last year, the Cardinal
outscored its opponents 310-232 but
is in prime position to push runners
across the plate earlier and more
often this spring.
Gaffney ended last season on a
22-game hit streak, Ragira was Pac
-10 Freshman of the Year after hit
ting .329 with 46 RBIs, Wilson has
about as high a ceiling as any out
fielder Stanford has had in recent
memory, Kauppila was an all-star in
the NCAA Tournament and that
just begins to scratch the surface of
what the Cardinal has to offer on of
fense.
Reason No. 2: There is no substi
tute for pure, cold heat.
What Appel has attached to his
right shoulder is a rocket of an arm,
routinely throwing 97-98 and touch
ing 100 mph last season with an easy
delivery that scouts drool over. He
has three "plus" pitches, with a nice
slider and changeup with good ac
tion to keep hitters guessing.
That's major-league ace-type
stuff. There are no questions about
his character, and with an entire sea
son as the marquee Friday-night
starter under his belt, the Houston
native is the "Appel" of many folks'

eyes.
Reason No. 3:The SEC is due to
lose.
To put it lightly, I do not appreci
ate the way Southeastern Confer
ence fans tout everything about
their teams as unbeatable. Yes, I said
it. The SEC has been home to the
last three College World Series
Champions South Carolina in
2010 and 2011 and LSU in 2009
and frankly, I don't think anyone
down South is ready for a four-peat.
Florida is an almost unanimous
choice as the nation's No. 1 so far this
preseason, and they return most of
their lineup from last season and will
undoubtedly be quite good. South
Carolina always finds away to win
and has two outstanding pitchers.
And Arkansas seems to have put it
self on the cusp of big things down in
the swampland.
But something tells me Florida
might be hit with an injury or two,
and the Gamecocks have plenty of
holes to fill on offense.
And sure, any of those pitfalls
could await the Cardinal. Questions
about the pitching staff behind
Appel are certainly there, and there
are few things more difficult than
hitting a pitched baseball.
However, when all is said and
done in June, I think Stanford will be
back in the CWS for the first time
since 2008 with some of the best tal
ent the Farm has seen since Sam
Fuld, Carlos Quentin and Jeremy
Guthrie sat in the dugout at Sunken
Diamond.
Don't sleep on Stanford base
ball.
Miles Bennett-Smith has clearly
never been to Fayetteville, Ark. Tell
him that the Ozark Mountains do
not qualify as "swampland" at
milesbs@stanford.edu and check
him out on Twitter @smilesbsmith.

and could spend thousands of words
talking about any one of Stanford's
NCAA title contenders with 101
national championships, the Farm
has gotten used to winning a lot
I'd like to turn today's attention to
the baseball diamond, where coach
Mark Marquess' team is turning
heads with a collection of major
league talent that hasn't been seen at
the Sunken Diamond in several
years.

There's no need to bury the
headline here the Cardinal has
likely the top pitcher in the collegiate
ranks this season in junior Mark
Appel and features a lineup built for
scoring runs with two other likely
first-round draft picks in classmates
Kenny Diekroeger and Stephen Pis
cotty.
So in honor of that trio of presea
son All-Americans which is al
ready earning points for No. 3 Stan
ford with the pollsters in Collegiate
Baseball's Preseason rankings I
have thought of three reasons why
you should not sleep on Stanford
baseball this season.
Reason No. 1: After shortstop
Diekroeger and third baseman Pis
cotty, the lineup is looking pretty
damn good.
Piscotty led the Cardinal with a

.364 average and was an All-Pac-10
selection last season, while Dieko
roeger hit .356 and was a Freshman
All-American in 2010. But Stanford
also boasts two more two-year re
turning starters in outfielders Jake
Stewart and Tyler Gaffney and fea
tures three sophomores who started
in 2011 Brian Ragira, Austin Wil
son and Lonnie Kauppila.
Short of preseason No. 1 Florida,
Stanford ought to score runs in big
ger bunches than any other team in
the country. Last year, the Cardinal
outscored its opponents 310-232 but
is in prime position to push runners
across the plate earlier and more
often this spring.
Gaffney ended last season on a
22-game hit streak, Ragira was Pac
-10 Freshman of the Year after hit
ting .329 with 46 RBIs, Wilson has
about as high a ceiling as any out
fielder Stanford has had in recent
memory, Kauppila was an all-star in
the NCAA Tournament and that
just begins to scratch the surface of
what the Cardinal has to offer on of
fense.
Reason No. 2: There is no substi
tute for pure, cold heat.
What Appel has attached to his
right shoulder is a rocket of an arm,
routinely throwing 97-98 and touch
ing 100 mph last season with an easy
delivery that scouts drool over. He
has three "plus" pitches, with a nice
slider and changeup with good ac
tion to keep hitters guessing.
That's major-league ace-type
stuff. There are no questions about
his character, and with an entire sea
son as the marquee Friday-night
starter under his belt, the Houston
native is the "Appel" of many folks'

eyes.
Reason No. 3:The SEC is due to
lose.
To put it lightly, I do not appreci
ate the way Southeastern Confer
ence fans tout everything about
their teams as unbeatable. Yes, I said
it. The SEC has been home to the
last three College World Series
Champions South Carolina in
2010 and 2011 and LSU in 2009
and frankly, I don't think anyone
down South is ready for a four-peat.
Florida is an almost unanimous
choice as the nation's No. 1 so far this
preseason, and they return most of
their lineup from last season and will
undoubtedly be quite good. South
Carolina always finds away to win
and has two outstanding pitchers.
And Arkansas seems to have put it
self on the cusp of big things down in
the swampland.
But something tells me Florida
might be hit with an injury or two,
and the Gamecocks have plenty of
holes to fill on offense.
And sure, any of those pitfalls
could await the Cardinal. Questions
about the pitching staff behind
Appel are certainly there, and there
are few things more difficult than
hitting a pitched baseball.
However, when all is said and
done in June, I think Stanford will be
back in the CWS for the first time
since 2008 with some of the best tal
ent the Farm has seen since Sam
Fuld, Carlos Quentin and Jeremy
Guthrie sat in the dugout at Sunken
Diamond.
Don't sleep on Stanford base
ball.
Miles Bennett-Smith has clearly
never been to Fayetteville, Ark. Tell
him that the Ozark Mountains do
not qualify as "swampland" at
milesbs@stanford.edu and check
him out on Twitter @smilesbsmith.
Don't sleep on Stanford
baseball. While the
campus may just be
starting to catch foot
ball fever thanks to
Andrew Luck and company, every
year there are several other sports
that fly under the radar with only A1
Davis' famous mantra: just win,
baby.
Just yesterday, I ran into a class
mate who was lamenting the cam
pus's lack of attention to the mid
major college sports, like baseball.
