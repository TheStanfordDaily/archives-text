# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
## Huskies, Cougars return to the Farm 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After reeling off 12 straight
wins, including two in the Rocky
Mountains last week, the Stan
ford women s basketball team re
turns to Maples Pavilion this
weekend to begin a three-game
home-stand.
The No. 4 Cardinal (15-1, 6-0
Pac-12) tips the action off tonight
against Washington State (9-8, 3-
2), and if history is any indication,
Stanford should have little trou
ble sweeping through the week
end.
The Cardinal has never lost to
the Cougars, with 52 straight vie-

Tories over Washington State, in
cluding the last eight meetings by
an average of 39.1 points.
If Stanford hopes to continue
to keep its winning streak alive, itll
likely continue to lean on the Og
wumike sisters, who have been
hammering opponents during the
Cardinal's dominant Pac-12 start.
Senior forward Nnemkadi Og
wumike has unsurprisingly been
the driving force behind the Car
dinal offense lately, as she's con
sistently dominated the glass and
led the team in scoring. Ogwu
mike had a string of five straight
double-doubles snapped in Satur-
Stanford will also look for
more dynamic play from its
young backcourt of Chasson
Randle and Aaron Bright. The
two guards lead the team in min
utes and closely match each other
as the squad's second and third
leading scorers (Bright with 12.3
points per game, Randle with
12.2).
"I think they do a very good
job of complementing each

other," Dawkins said. "Both of
these kids are capable scorers,
and they're both capable of han
dling the basketball as the lead
guard. I think it gives us a great
balance out there,
"They realize the value of one
of them going at any given time to
help the team," he added. "So I've
been pleased with their develop
ment, I've been pleased with their
chemistry."
Tip-off against the Cougars is
scheduled for 7 p.m. at Beasley
Coliseum in Pullman, Wash.
