## Men's soccer adds top assistant 
### Miles Bennett-Smith 
New Stanford men's soccer
coach Jeremy Gunn, just a day after
he was honored as National Coach
of the Year, named John Smith the
lead assistant coach for the Cardinal
on Wednesday.
Gunn, a native of the United
Kingdom, turned to a fellow English
national in Smith to help him on the
sideline.
"I am thrilled to announce the

appointment of John Smith as assis
tant coach to the men's program,"
Gunn said. "He has a wealth of expe
rience both as a player and as a coach
and will make an immediate impact
in the program with his personality
and drive."
Smith spent the last six seasons as
head coach at Incarnate Word in San
Antonio. He compiled a 62-26-10
record with the Crusaders, turning
them into a perennial Division II
contender with three consecutive
Heartland Conference Champi
onships, a feat that earned him three
straight Coach of the Year awards.
"I am very excited to have been
afforded the opportunity to join
such a fantastic program here at
Stanford University," Smith said. "It
is an honor for me to be able to coach
at such an institution which has truly
become the benchmark for both ac
ademic and athletic excellence at the
collegiate level."
After setting scoring records as a
striker at Rollins College, Smith
played for several professional

teams in the United States before
eventually becoming an assistant
coach with the Cal State-Bakersfield
soccer program in 1998, where
Gunn was already on the coaching
staff.

Along with goalkeeper and assis
tant coach Mike Graczyk, Smith and
Gunn will try to help the Cardinal
which has missed out on the postsea
son eight times in the past nine sea
sonsâ€” return to prominence in
2012.
