# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## Finances murky in ASSU Process not transparent, hard to track financial information 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
Despite campaign promises and
governing documents mandating
transparency, student oversight of
the ASSU remains lacking, as track
ing ASSU financial transactions oc
casionally eludes even the organi
zation's student representatives.
The ASSU constitution man
dates that "all records of any Asso
ciation entity must be available for
scrutiny by the public" and also re
quires that the ASSU "provide ac
cess in a timely, efficient manner."
The only exceptions to this rule,
which do not apply to the following
cases, are proprietary business in
formation, banking of non-funded
accounts as well as legal and per
sonnel records for ASSU employ
ees.
Over $350,000 buffer fund
The ASSU Senate recently drew
its attention to a buffer fund with
over $350,000, after several Sena
tors became aware of the fund's ex
istence for the first time. When
Stephen Trusheim 'l3, former
ASSU Elections Commissioner,
went to the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate to request $35,000 for a con
cert in the fall, he recommended the
Senate look into using the buffer
fund.
This suggestion was met with
surprise and confusion by many
Senators, who then requested an
explanation from Neveen Mah
moud 'll, the CEO of Stanford Stu
dent Enterprises (SSE), the finan
cial arm of the ASSU.
Mahmoud informed the Senate
that the fund is created by a 10 per
cent surcharge placed on all Stan
ford students' general fees to cover
the cost of those who request re
funds. The excess money has tradi-
tionally been used to fund student
groups who did not receive special
fees in a campus-wide vote.
Trusheim is currently an em
ployee of the ASSU/SSE. Trusheim
did not attend the meeting in which
the vote occurred, despite a request
from Senators that he do so. His bill
was approved on Jan. 11 by an
ASSU Senate that has not yet
voted "no" on a funding bill this
year.
Difficult to find the money
Student groups can only receive
$6,000 from general fees, with a
slightly higher cap for publications
or groups who do community serv
ice. This stands in contrast to the
$35,000 dispersed in accordance
withTrusheim's bill. Unless a group
knew about the buffer fund, it
would have no opportunity to re
quest money from it.
Additionally, there are currently
no rules or procedures for approv
ing money from the fund. The ap
propriations committee did not
have authority over suggestions for
uses of the fund, and the money was
not delegated in a traditional
"funding bill," sent out to the public
Senate email list as attachments. In
stead, the concert funding was
passed as a regular bill, located
within a Senate meeting agenda.

ASSU Senate finances scattered,
untracked
In addition to the new and un
regulated pool of money being
given out to only a few student
groups on campus, other areas of

the ASSU severely lack trans
parency. Any student is entitled by
the ASSU Constitution to request
records concerning money spent by
the ASSU Senate; however, this
process is convoluted and often
times met with confusion.
Requests for the transactions
from the SSE offices returned a se
ries of transactions made from the
ASSU Senate's account; however
student groups that received
money were listed by a four-digit
code used for MyGroups, the
banking program for the SSE and
ASSU.
After going through these
documents and pairing each
number with its student group,
The Daily asked members of the
ASSU appropriations committee
to explain several significant odd
ities. Alon Elhanan 'l4, in charge
of communications and a mem
ber of the appropriations com
mittee, responded by granting
The Daily access to the Senate's
spending tracker, a Google docu
ment used by the Senate to
record transactions.
Of the 39 transactions that were
withdrawn from the ASSU spend
ing account according to SSE, only
17 were included on the ASSU
Senate's spending tracker. Over
$26,000 dollars withdrawn from
the ASSU Senate's account were
not recorded in the spending
tracker.

Chair of the appropriations
committee Brianna Pang 'l3 re
sponded that all the spending was
tracked in funding bills, which are
sent out to the ASSU Senate's
email list each week. However,
there exists no database for these
documents, making the process of
acquiring this information incredi
bly dense and time-consuming.

ASSU transparency moving for
ward
Pang acknowledged after a Sen
ate meeting that these funding bills
and spending trackers were not suf
ficiently updated or easy to access
and promised to put all the funding
bills in one place on the new ASSU

Senate site. Pang and Senate Chair
Rafael Vazquez 'l2 both said they
hope to do so in the coming week.
After a total of $75,000 was allo
cated from the fund (an additional
$40,000 was given to the NAACP
for Blackfest), Pang said she was
working with Andrew Aguilar, di

rector of the Division of Internal
Review (DIR), to draft rules about
the usage of the fund and to get a
more detailed report about the
fund from Mahmoud.
