## Chinese martial arts show a rare treat for Stanford and the Bay Area 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
This week, the Beijing Wushu
Team, with actor Zhenwei Wang from
the 2010 "Karate Kid" movie making a
special appearance, will perform two
shows at Stanford on Wednesday and
Thursday night in Burnham Pavilion,
as well as two shows in San Francisco.
The shows range

from 90 minutes to two hours and have
32 acts.
The Beijing Wushu Team consists
of 30 athletes, all of whom came from
China a week and half ago. The team is
visiting Stanford on a visit to the Bay
Area. The Stanford Wushu Team and
Stanford Martial Arts are funding
their transportation costs.
Zhang Hong Mei, one of the
wushu instructors and coaches here at

Stanford, was a champion member of
the Beijing Wushu Team in the past.
Mei was once teammates with Li Lian
Jie, better known as Jet Li.
The Stanford Wushu Team had
been hoping to bring the Beijing team
over to the United States for quite some
time now, and everything finally
worked out this year.
