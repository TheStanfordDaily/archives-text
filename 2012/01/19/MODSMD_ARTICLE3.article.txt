# Beijing Wushu Team performs in Burnham
## Chinese martial arts show a rare treat for Stanford and the Bay Area 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
This week, the Beijing Wushu
Team, with actor Zhenwei Wang from
the 2010 "Karate Kid" movie making a
special appearance, will perform two
shows at Stanford on Wednesday and
Thursday night in Burnham Pavilion,
as well as two shows in San Francisco.
The shows range

from 90 minutes to two hours and have
32 acts.
The Beijing Wushu Team consists
of 30 athletes, all of whom came from
China a week and half ago. The team is
visiting Stanford on a visit to the Bay
Area. The Stanford Wushu Team and
Stanford Martial Arts are funding
their transportation costs.
Zhang Hong Mei, one of the
wushu instructors and coaches here at

Stanford, was a champion member of
the Beijing Wushu Team in the past.
Mei was once teammates with Li Lian
Jie, better known as Jet Li.
The Stanford Wushu Team had
been hoping to bring the Beijing team
over to the United States for quite some
time now, and everything finally
worked out this year.

Literally translated, "wushu"
is broken up into two words,
"wu" meaning military and
"shu" meaning art. Thus,
"wushu" is the term for Chinese
martial arts.
Wushu today has evolved
into an organized and system
ized branch of study that is
largely practiced for its method
in achieving health, self-defense
skills, mental discipline, recre
ation and competition.
While kung fu and wushu
were originally the same, wushu
has modernized in mainland
China to create a universal stan
dard for training and compet
ing. Consequently, wushu has
grown into an athletic perform

ance and competitive sport,
while kung fu or traditional
wushu remains the traditional
fighting practice.
"The special thing about
Stanford Wushu is that not only
are we a club, but we're also a
competitive team," said Aysha
Kureishi 'l4. "A lot of people
from the community come over
to compete with us."
The biggest competition that
the Stanford Wushu Team par
ticipates in is the National
Wushu Collegiates Tourna
ment, where the team sends in
at least one team of six and
sometimes individual members
as well. Last year, the competi
tion was held at UCLA, and
Stanford Wushu placed third.
This year, they will be compet
ing in April at the University of
Virginia.

The Stanford Wushu Team
has already begun planning fu

ture events for this year. During
the upcoming Lunar New Year,
Stanford Wushu will be per
forming at White Plaza.
"We often do demos at large
scale events like NSO and go
into places in the community in
order to spread Chinese cul
ture," said Zahra Sayyid 'l2, co
president of Stanford Wushu.
"We're planning to have a
seminar with the Beijing Wushu
Team on Sunday, which will be
open to the public," Sayyid said.
"Basically, anyone who wants to
come interact with them can do
that."

Tickets to the Stanford per
formances in Burnham Pavilion
are $2O for students and $45 for
general admission and are
available at the door. The per
formances start at 7:00 p.m.
