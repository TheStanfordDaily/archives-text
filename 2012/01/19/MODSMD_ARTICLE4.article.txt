## RA feedback program launches campus-wide 
### MARY HARRISON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This year, Stanford's Residential Education
(ResEd) Department piloted a new survey
called the Staff Feedback Instrument (SFI) that
gives dorm staff the opportunity to be rated by
their residents.
ResEd designed the SFI to facilitate a con
versation between Resident Assistants (RAs)
and Resident Fellows (RFs) about how dorm
staff members are performing and how they can
improve in the future.
Over 4,500 students were invited to take the

survey this year. The survey was an extension of
a previous RA feedback project that ResEd had
been working on for the past three years.
Jennifer Calvert, associate dean of ResEd,
explained the progress of the survey in an email
to The Daily.
"During the first year of development, we in
terviewed constituents to get a sense of what
they thought would be useful information and to
gather information about their preferences re
garding timing, format and reporting," Calvert
said.
After surveying the residential community to
determine what types of questions would be

helpful to ask, the following year, ResEd per
formed a small pilot program of the SFI that sur
veyed six houses and gathered feedback for over
20 RAs.
Because the houses that participated in the
pilot program last year responded very positive
ly to the SFI, ResEd decided to expand the pro
gram this year to all 44 houses with Resident Fel
lows, according to Calvert.
The surveyed houses included a variety of
dorms, from all-freshman houses to apartment
style dorms for upperclassmen.
