## RA feedback program launches campus-wide 
### MARY HARRISON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This year, Stanford's Residential Education
(ResEd) Department piloted a new survey
called the Staff Feedback Instrument (SFI) that
gives dorm staff the opportunity to be rated by
their residents.
ResEd designed the SFI to facilitate a con
versation between Resident Assistants (RAs)
and Resident Fellows (RFs) about how dorm
staff members are performing and how they can
improve in the future.
Over 4,500 students were invited to take the

survey this year. The survey was an extension of
a previous RA feedback project that ResEd had
been working on for the past three years.
Jennifer Calvert, associate dean of ResEd,
explained the progress of the survey in an email
to The Daily.
"During the first year of development, we in
terviewed constituents to get a sense of what
they thought would be useful information and to
gather information about their preferences re
garding timing, format and reporting," Calvert
said.
After surveying the residential community to
determine what types of questions would be

helpful to ask, the following year, ResEd per
formed a small pilot program of the SFI that sur
veyed six houses and gathered feedback for over
20 RAs.
Because the houses that participated in the
pilot program last year responded very positive
ly to the SFI, ResEd decided to expand the pro
gram this year to all 44 houses with Resident Fel
lows, according to Calvert.
The surveyed houses included a variety of
dorms, from all-freshman houses to apartment
style dorms for upperclassmen.
Although participation data
varied widely from house to house,
Calvert stated that the program
had an overall response rate of 47
percent.
"The SFI is unique in that it
focuses on a provided rating from
"poor" to "excellent" for each
RA ... The switch to a rating sys
tem was a byproduct of the inter
views that took place during year
one," Calvert said.
Previous surveys conducted
by ResEd asked residents to re
spond to a series of statements on
a scale from "strongly agree" to
"strongly disagree."
Residence staffs seem to
think that the new wording gives
RAs more direct feedback so
they can focus their energies in
improving areas in which they
scored poorly.
"Both Resident Fellows and
student staff seemed to agree that
they would prefer items which
gave them clear indications of
their performance," Calvert said.
The survey asks residents to
rate RAs in 10 categories: ap
proachability, reliability, ability to
have interesting conversations, en
gagement in the house, organiza

tion, ability to consider multiple
viewpoints, assertiveness, enthusi
asm, reasonableness and ability to
have intellectual conversations.

These 10 categories, Calvert
said, reflect the three tenets that
ResEd believes are important as
pects of a successful residential ex
perience at Stanford: building
community, decision-making and
intellectuality.
Residents also give RAs an
overall rating reflecting a combina
tion of all aspects of their perform
ance.

"The purpose of the instru
ment," Calvert said, "is to facilitate
a conversation between student
staff and their supervisors regard
ing student-staff performance as
perceived by residents."
Calvert emphasized that this
survey is just one of many tools
used by RFs in assessing how the
dorm staff is working.
"What [the implementation of
survey data] looks like exactly will
vary as much as the residential ex
perience varies across campus,"
she said.

"This variation is important,"
Calvert added, "because it allows
us to customize the manner and de
gree to which we coach our student
staff toward improvement."
Although ResEd has high
hopes for the survey, some dorm
staff members are not sure about
how successful it will be.

Kali Lindsay 'l2, an RA in the
all-freshman dorm Larkin, is one
RA to express concern with the
competitive nature of the survey.

"I felt a little weird about the
whole thing ... [the survey] com
pares RAs to each other and ranks
them," Lindsay said.
In addition to comparing RAs
within houses, the survey also
ranks RAs across campus.
Lindsay said currently the RFs
in Larkin give staff members feed
back through quarterly check-ins.
Lindsay added that she wasn't sure
if the new surveying method would
improve on the system that is cur
rently in place.

The Resident Fellows for
Larkin House, Patti Hanlon-Baker
and Geoff Baker, said they would
complement the ResEd SFI survey
with a Larkin-specific assessment,
hoping that the house-specific sur
vey would espouse their values of
"retrospection, introspection and
prospection" more than the SFI
alone.

In an email to The Daily, Geoff
Baker wrote that the RF pair
would prefer a survey method that
is both "specific and actionable."

"We want to learn what we can
from the past with an eye on what
we think we know about the pres
ent and future," Baker said.
