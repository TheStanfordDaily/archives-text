# NEWS BRIEF
## CIS joins SOPA, PIPA blackout 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF —Brendan O 'Byrne 
Many popular websites —
Wikipedia, Reddit and Imgur to
name a few —blacked out their
websites yesterday as part of a
protest movement against the
Stop Online Piracy Act, common
ly referred to as SOPA, and the
Preventing Real Online Threats
to Economic Creativity and Theft
of Intellectual Property Act, also
known as PROTECT IP or PIPA.
These bills are currently in Con
gress, and many in the tech com
munity feel they amount to cen
sorship of the Internet.
The Stanford Center for Inter
net Studies (CIS), a division of
Stanford Law School's Law, Sci
ence and Technology Program,
went black to show solidarity with
the other websites participating in
the Jan. 18 shutdown. Stanford's
official Twitter account (©Stan
ford) twice tweeted about action
taken by the CIS, and the official
CIS Twitter account (©Stanford-
CIS) has been tweeting about op
position to SOPA and PIPA since
November.
Google also protested the acts
by blacking out its logo on the
front page, and the company
claims to have garnered 4.5 mil
lion signatures against the two
acts.
A petition on Whitehouse.gov
has more than 100,000 signatures,
and another on a popular activist
site Avaaz has over 1.5 million sig
natures.

The Daily previously reported
on a conference held by CIS earli
er this month about SOPA and
PIPA, which allowed many tech
innovators and legal scholars to
voice their concerns over the leg
islation.
