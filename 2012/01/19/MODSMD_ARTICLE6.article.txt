# STS major changes
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF Brendan O 'Byrne 
The Stanford Program in Sci
ence, Technology and Society
(STS) will be undergoing changes
in September of this year.
Director of STS Fred Turner
announced in an email to STS ma
jors the changes, which will allow
students to choose an area of
focus in their studies. Both bache
lor of arts (8.A.) and bachelor of
science (8.5.) degrees will be
available to students in the major.
The five areas of focus that stu
dents may choose are Informa
tion Technology, Media & Society
(B.A. or 8.5.); Innovation, Tech
nology and Organizations (B.A.
or 8.5.); Environment and Sus
tainability (B.A. or 8.5.); Life Sci
ences and Biotechnology (B.A. or
8.5.) and Policy, Security & Tech
nology (B.A. only). Students
seeking a bachelor of arts will
have eight classes that come from
a pre-approved list of humanities
classes and four that come from
technical areas, while the opposite
will be true for bachelor of science
candidates.
Turner said the new major will
also focus on innovative research
and off-campus opportunities. The
core classes and senior capstone
projects will remain in the major as
well.
Current majors and those who
declare before September 2012
will have a choice between the new
and the old format, while all stu
dents who declare after that will be
required to adopt the new guide
lines.
