## Citi exec offers her advice, insight By NATASHA WEASER 
### 
Citi's chief innovation officer
and one of the most powerful
women in business today, Debo
rah Hopkins, spoke to over 300
people packed into the NVIDIA
Auditorium in the Huang Engi
neering Center on Wednesday af
ternoon.
Hopkins is the first of a set of
speakers in the 1-unit course
MS&E 472, also known as the En
trepreneurial Thought Leaders
Seminar. The seminar is open to
the public and brings prominent
entrepreneurial voices to campus
once a week to share their insights

with the Stanford community.
Tina Seelig, executive director
of the Stanford Technology Ven
tures Program (STVP), which, in
conjunction with Business Associ
ation of Stanford Entrepreneurial
Students (BASES), helped organ
ized the event, introduced Hop
kins as "someone passionate
about creativity and entrepre
neurship."
Hopkins has a long and suc
cessful history in the business
world, previously holding posi
tions such as CFO of Boeing and
General Motors. She joined Citi in
2003, working in technology and
strategy before being tapped by

CEO Vikram Pandit to become
chief innovative officer in 2008.
Based in Palo Alto, her main
aim is client-based innovation and
forming partnerships with start
ups, universities and thought lead
ers.
"I am absolutely delighted to
be here," Flopkins said. "We are
passionate about being part of
this campus and being involved in
what you are doing here."
Hopkins was instrumental in
establishing a presence for Citi in
Silicon Valley in the last three
years. In 2011, Citi met with 600
start-up companies in the area
and invested in eight of them.
"Being in the Valley is a core
component for us," Hopkins said.
Citi has a strong connection to
Stanford, working with Stanford
start-ups such as Ready For Zero,
which helps people pay off their
debts. Hopkins said Citi invested
in the company and is looking at
how to commercialize the idea
and offer it to its own customers.
Hopkins highlighted the Tahrir
Square and Occupy Wall Street
protests, citing the impact of tech
nological revolutions on business.
"We are going through a time
of a confluence of events we have
never witnessed before," Hopkins
said. "The world is forever
changed by the way we communi
cate and use technology and data.
This will fundamentally change
the way business is conducted."
She stated that because of the
advancement of technology, busi

nesses must now adapt by having
a more open communication net
work and be more involved in a
dialogue with their customers.
According to Hopkins, as
pects like web design and social
marketing, not traditionally
linked to banking, are now cru
cial elements in the industry.
Citing Citi's Smart Banking
project, which redesigned the en
tire process of consumer bank
ing, she said Citi's goal is to simul
taneously make banking accessi
ble and enjoyable while main
taining a firm moral commitment
to help people make better finan
cial decisions.
"Banking is thought of as in
timidating and awful," she said.
"But it is concerned with the
most intimate things in your life
like buying a house or opening
your first account."
Hopkins repeatedly men
tioned Citi's role and expansion
in Asia, which is being used as a
zone to test new strategies and
where branches are spreading
rapidly.
"I liked her emphasis on mo
bile technology," said audience
member George Burgess 'l5,
managing director of Education-
Apps Ltd. "The way Citi has inte
grated mobile devices into their
Asian stores is extremely cre
ative,"
"I found her to be a very
strong businesswoman," said an
other audience member Narjis
Sarehane 'l3. "She inspired me to
pursue my interest in business."
