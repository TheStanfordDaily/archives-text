Hopkins is the first of a set of
speakers in the 1-unit course
MS&E 472, also known as the En
trepreneurial Thought Leaders
Seminar. The seminar is open to
the public and brings prominent
entrepreneurial voices to campus
once a week to share their insights

with the Stanford community.

conjunction with Business Associ

2003, working in technology and
