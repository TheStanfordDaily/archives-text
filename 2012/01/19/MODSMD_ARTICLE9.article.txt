## DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF Let's get physical! 
### Leslie Brian 
There's no denying that we
are sensory creatures. I
could be 85, and the rich,
salty taste of brisket and riced po
tatoes would still send me right
back to evenings spent home
alone on the couch while my par
ents gallivanted off to their
grown-up parties; and whenever I
hear "Disturbia," I'm always cata
pulted back to freshman year
pregames in the halls of Cedro.
The point is that our brains
make associations without our
even noticing. Every day, we see
and listen and taste and smell and
feel a thousand different things.
Our web of neurons and synaps
es, muscles and fibers are con
stantly working to process an
overload of external and internal
stimuli and give us feedback. It's a
pretty cool mechanism: when
we're cold, we shiver; when we're
hot, we sweat. Adding an even
greater degree of complexity,
more often than not, it's not just a
physical response we record, but
a mental one, too. So that a
Thanksgiving meal is more than
just a gustatory sensation, it's also
an emotional imprint.
This is all to say that our bod
ies are incredibly powerful instru
ments. Yet despite their wisdom,
we don't give our bodies enough
credit. How many times do we
pause and take in our internal
physicality and emotions? Our
heart is always beating and our
lungs are constantly taking in air,
but subtle changes in these kinds
of everyday actions are huge
clues to your physical and mental
state. Notice your posture, your
breath, your energy level. The
tension hiding in your shoulders
or your jaw. The rate at which
your fingers tap away at the key
board. Are you fiddling with your
hair, bouncing your foot, getting
distracted, picking your nails?
Pimples? These are all external
manifestations of our body's
inner state. It's trying to tell us
something.
Where it gets tricky is that
we're rational creatures as well.
Without fangs or sharp canines or
armor-like skin, humans climbed
to the top of the food chain. Stan
ford, in particular, is a community
of academic thinkers, dominated
by those who have used sheer
mental grit to get ahead. And for
us worshippers of reason, how the
body communicates information
doesn't always register. We're
frustrated when we can't provide
a ready explanation for our feel
ings. "Why am I crying?" or "I
don't know why I'm so tired" or
"Sorry, I'm so out of it." When it's
not convenient to feel a certain
way, rather than respecting our
body, we apologize for it. Reason
should guide your response to a
feeling, not the other way around.
You can't simply use your head to

coax your body to feel differently.
It doesn't work like that. No one
can outsmart Mother Nature.
Last Friday, I participated in
an incredible experience that was
all about noticing how the body
physically reacts to an emotional
ly charged situation. We replicat
ed an exercise that had been con
ducted in South Africa in order to
help heal the wounds of
apartheid. After breaking up into
pairs, we were assigned roles. Per
son A would say the words, "You
hurt me," and Person B would re
spond with, "I'm sorry." That
same dialogue would repeat, over
and over again, as we varied into
nation and body language to
make up for the fact that we
couldn't change the words.
All of us were shocked by how
viscerally and intensely the exer
cise affected us. Some cried.
Everyone wanted the exercise to
end. We all needed time to
process what had happened.
Whether we wanted to or not, we
had all superimposed our own
psyches onto the words we were
saying, provoking physical reac
tions that hit us out of nowhere.
The exercise was both incredi
bly uncomfortable and incredibly
illuminating. No amount of ra
tional thought could explain our
reactions. I can't describe what
might have been going through
the other 14 students' heads. We
had to go off of our physicality
alone to process it.
The body is an infinite source
of truth, even though its truth
may not be "rational" or "logi
cal," per se. Emotions aren't like
equations. They aren't clean or
straightforward, they're messy
and don't immediately add up.
But that doesn't make emotional
information any less valid. Tuning
into our bodies opens us up to in
sight that no degree of rationality
could. You can intellectualize all
you want, but sometimes, it's no
replacement for something as
simple as sitting with your emo
tions.
As my mom said, sometimes
you need a good cry. We all need
to heal, both emotionally and
physically. When you allow your
self to listen to your body and
process your feelings, there's a
much better chance it won't leave
a scar.

feel a thousand different things.
Our web of neurons and synaps
es, muscles and fibers are con
stantly working to process an
overload of external and internal
stimuli and give us feedback. It's a
pretty cool mechanism: when
we're cold, we shiver; when we're
hot, we sweat. Adding an even
greater degree of complexity,
more often than not, it's not just a
physical response we record, but
a mental one, too. So that a
Thanksgiving meal is more than
just a gustatory sensation, it's also
an emotional imprint.
This is all to say that our bod
ies are incredibly powerful instru
ments. Yet despite their wisdom,
we don't give our bodies enough
credit. How many times do we
pause and take in our internal
physicality and emotions? Our
heart is always beating and our
lungs are constantly taking in air,
but subtle changes in these kinds
of everyday actions are huge
clues to your physical and mental
state. Notice your posture, your
breath, your energy level. The
tension hiding in your shoulders
or your jaw. The rate at which
your fingers tap away at the key
board. Are you fiddling with your
hair, bouncing your foot, getting
distracted, picking your nails?
Pimples? These are all external
manifestations of our body's
inner state. It's trying to tell us
something.
Where it gets tricky is that
we're rational creatures as well.
Without fangs or sharp canines or
armor-like skin, humans climbed
to the top of the food chain. Stan
ford, in particular, is a community
of academic thinkers, dominated
by those who have used sheer
mental grit to get ahead. And for
us worshippers of reason, how the
body communicates information
doesn't always register. We're
frustrated when we can't provide
a ready explanation for our feel
ings. "Why am I crying?" or "I
don't know why I'm so tired" or
"Sorry, I'm so out of it." When it's
not convenient to feel a certain
way, rather than respecting our
body, we apologize for it. Reason
should guide your response to a
feeling, not the other way around.
You can't simply use your head to

coax your body to feel differently.
It doesn't work like that. No one
can outsmart Mother Nature.
Last Friday, I participated in
an incredible experience that was
all about noticing how the body
physically reacts to an emotional
ly charged situation. We replicat
ed an exercise that had been con
ducted in South Africa in order to
help heal the wounds of
apartheid. After breaking up into
pairs, we were assigned roles. Per
son A would say the words, "You
hurt me," and Person B would re
spond with, "I'm sorry." That
same dialogue would repeat, over
and over again, as we varied into
nation and body language to
make up for the fact that we
couldn't change the words.
All of us were shocked by how
viscerally and intensely the exer
cise affected us. Some cried.
Everyone wanted the exercise to
end. We all needed time to
process what had happened.
Whether we wanted to or not, we
had all superimposed our own
psyches onto the words we were
saying, provoking physical reac
tions that hit us out of nowhere.
The exercise was both incredi
bly uncomfortable and incredibly
illuminating. No amount of ra
tional thought could explain our
reactions. I can't describe what
might have been going through
the other 14 students' heads. We
had to go off of our physicality
alone to process it.
The body is an infinite source
of truth, even though its truth
may not be "rational" or "logi
cal," per se. Emotions aren't like
equations. They aren't clean or
straightforward, they're messy
and don't immediately add up.
But that doesn't make emotional
information any less valid. Tuning
into our bodies opens us up to in
sight that no degree of rationality
could. You can intellectualize all
you want, but sometimes, it's no
replacement for something as
simple as sitting with your emo
tions.
As my mom said, sometimes
you need a good cry. We all need
to heal, both emotionally and
physically. When you allow your
self to listen to your body and
process your feelings, there's a
much better chance it won't leave
a scar.

There's no denying that we
are sensory creatures. I
could be 85, and the rich,
salty taste of brisket and riced po
tatoes would still send me right
back to evenings spent home
alone on the couch while my par
ents gallivanted off to their
grown-up parties; and whenever I
hear "Disturbia," I'm always cata
pulted back to freshman year
pregames in the halls of Cedro.
The point is that our brains
make associations without our
even noticing. Every day, we see
and listen and taste and smell and
feel a thousand different things.
