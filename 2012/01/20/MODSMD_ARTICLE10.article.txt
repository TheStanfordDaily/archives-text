## EDITORIAL Why Keystone XL is the wrong battle for environmentalists 
### 
We consider ourselves to
be strongly supportive
of environmental caus
es. We believe climate change to
be one of the most important is
sues facing our generation and
would gladly participate in advo
cacy efforts to change the current
course of U.S. policy (or lack
thereof). However, we do not
view the Keystone XL pipeline as
the right battle for the cause. After
months of protests led by Bill
McKibben and his environmen
talist followers, thousands of civil
disobedience arrests and moun
tains of apocalyptic rhetoric, Pres
ident Obama decided to delay the
request for the pipeline that
would bring tar sands oil down
from Canada and hand a victory
to environmentalists. We don't
see it as a victory worth winning.
Contrary to popular belief,
blocking this pipeline will make
no substantive contribution to
curbing climate change. We do
think concerns about the poten
tial harm to Nebraska's aquifers
are a good reason to reconsider
the pipeline, but that is not what
the debate has been about. While
oil extracted from Canadian tar
sands does produce about 15 per
cent greater carbon emissions
than conventional oil, keeping it
out of the United States will not
keep it from being burned. If the
tar sands are used by China, and
the U.S. uses slightly cleaner oil,
carbon emissions have only been
redistributed, not reduced. Fur
thermore, blocking one pipeline is
unlikely to even keep the oil out
of America when other pipelines
and modes of transport will sim
ply serve the same purpose. For
these reasons, New York Times
energy and environmental re
porter Andrew Revkin calls Key
stone "a distraction from core is
sues ... and largely insignificant if
your concern is averting a disrup
tive buildup of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere." As Michael
Levi, senior fellow for energy and
environment at the Council on
Foreign Relations, explains, de
mand for oil and other fossil fuels
is the key variable in the future of
the climate. Putting a price on car
bon to slash demand for fossil
fuels would make oil sands devel
opment obsolete and a failure to
do so would result in huge climate
problems whether or not this
pipeline is approved.

it counted. The cap-and-trade bill
that passed the U.S. House of
Representatives but languished
in the Senate would have used
carbon pricing to reduce green
house gas emissions 17 percent by
2020 and 80 percent by 2050. It
would have permanently and dra
matically altered America's posi
tion on climate and perhaps even
set the stage for the global green
house gas reduction treaty that
failed with it in 2010. And yet, we
have trouble remembering any
events on campus supporting this
legislation or protesting its failure.
There were no civil disobedience
arrests on the steps of the Capitol
Building. McKibben even op
posed cap-and-trade.
Environmentalists' opposition
to Keystone has succeeded main
ly in undermining President
Obama and handing a political
victory to Republicans. And why
not, when the pipeline makes the
President choose between alien
ating one of two core constituen
cies; labor and environmental
ists? Meanwhile, the people who
want to shut down the EPA laugh
gleefully and reap the benefits of
this protracted tussle.

Some on the far left would
argue that the President doesn't
have an environmental record
worth defending, but they are
mistaken. Under President
Obama, the Recovery Act poured
$9O billion into clean energy, the
largest investment in American
history. Major improvements in
fuel economy standards for cars
and light trucks will save billions
of barrels of oil and trillions of
dollars in fuel costs. The EPA will
regulate mercury, arsenic, toxic air
metals and carbon dioxide for the
first time. Most importantly,
blame for the failure of cap-and
trade lies with a dysfunctional
Senate that requires 60 votes for
every bill. Where the executive
branch could act, President
Obama did, and where legislation
failed it is Congress who deserves
the blame.

To sum up, we agree with ob
servers who note that the sheer
energy behind the Keystone XL
protests has been impressive.
Pointed toward a better cause, it
could and would have been inspir
ing. But as it is, all environmental
ists have accomplished is to blow
an insignificant issue way out of
proportion, paint themselves as
extremists uninterested in the
facts as well as play into the hands
of politicians actively opposed to
environmental protection.

Environmentalists did have
their chance to make a real differ
ence two years ago, but their en
thusiasm lacked noticeably when
