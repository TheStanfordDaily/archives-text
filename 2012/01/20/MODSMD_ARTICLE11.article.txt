# SEEING GREEN
## What goes around... gets stuck in the middle 
### Holly Moeller 
AUCKLAND, NZ
Twelve hours after liftoff
from SFO, 15 hours after
my roommate dropped me off at
the international terminal, I was
hauling my luggage toward my
connecting gate when the strap of
my laptop bag abruptly tore off.
Fortunately, somewhere in the
back of my sleepy brain, I remem
bered that Fd packed a backup for
the cheaply made bag, which had
n't looked quite up to the task Fd
asked of it. I re-packed books and
electronics in a canvas tote, and
ditched the ruined mess of plastic
y fabric at the next trashcan.
It wasn't until my next flight
had lifted off, treating me to a
panoramic view of dawn over the
southern Pacific Ocean, that I re
alized the irony of what I'd done.
Overnight, a plane had carried me
across the world's biggest body of
water, containing the world's
largest trash dump, the Pacific
Garbage Patch. In the morning, I
had, though indirectly, con
tributed to its continued expan
sion.

The Pacific Garbage Patch is
really more of a soup than a patch,
it's a collection of floating plastic
bits from around the world,
caught in the center of a slow
moving vortex of ocean currents
that border the North Pacific Sub
tropical Gyre. The patch extends,
arguably, over an area the size of
Hawaii, Texas or the entire conti
nental United States. The dis
agreement stems from both scien
tific debate how do you bound
something that's constantly
changing shape and location
while bobbing along on the open
ocean? and shameless propa
ganda. Even shock value's bigger
in Texas.

To disentangle myth from fact:
The Pacific Garbage Patch is not a
floating landfill. Despite media
portrayals that borrow pictures
from trash-choked harbors, the
patch is comprised primarily of
microscopic plastic particles, the
breakdown products of larger
plastic pieces that made their way
into the world's oceans. The patch
is still a warning sign. In 1997,
when Charles Moore found him
self sailing through a sea spotted
by bobbing bottles and chock-full
of plastic pellets, he was shocked.
Like all of us, he'd been tossing his

plastic waste into garbage bags
meant for terrestrial dumps, and
then forgetting about it. Yet here
was this vast expanse of escaped
human refuse, collecting thou
sands of miles from its nearest
human source.
Where else are human waste
products accumulating, out of
sight and out of mind?

There are at least five marine
garbage patches decorating
Earth's oceanic gyres. Like the
eastern Pacific one that Moore
discovered, they're comprised en
tirely of plastic, the one thing that
won't rot or rust away in the salt
water environment. Instead, plas
tic slowly photodegrades, break
ing down into smaller and smaller
pieces which, a la Zeno's Paradox,
never quite go away.

Though a huge net or plastic
drum is more visually disturbing,
the smallest bits of plastic are the
most dangerous. Their weathered
edges absorb toxic chemicals like
DDT (a pesticide outlawed in the
United States) and PCBs (also
banned by Congress), and then
deliver them to planktonic life
when the plastic pieces are mis
taken as food. Because plastics
are man-made, animal digestive
tracts can't break them down, so
both large pieces and residues ac
cumulate in the food web, transi
tioning from zooplankton, to ju
venile fish, to larger fish and even
to birds.

In deference to the perma
nence of plastic, when I spent 10
days aboard the Sea Education
Association's teaching vessel, the
Corwith Cramer, we carefully
separated and stored every bit of
plastic trash. The rest of our waste,
once we'd sailed far enough from
land, was unceremoniously
pitched overboard as oceanic
compost. By the end of the trip, in
spite of having 40-odd people
aboard, we'd accumulated sur
prisingly little plastic. But when I
thought about the fact that our
trash-bag-full would be around
for time immemorial likely
longer than the human race will
persist on the planet it seemed
a lot bigger.

Somehow that lesson faded
quickly when I returned to shore.
On land, I throw out plastic every
day candy wrappers, packag
ing and the odd ripped shoulder

bag. I rarely think about what that
plastic means to the planet.
Of course, plastic production
isn't the only way humans are
making long-term changes to the
planet. But if we can manage to
keep in mind the connection be
tween our everyday expendables
and the mountains of trash that
travel to landfills every year, plas
tics might be the best everyday re
minder that we have.

After all, it's hard to envision
the wild landscapes that pre-date
our suburbs. It's difficult to call to
mind Arctic oil rigs and strip
mined mountaintops we haven't
seen. And it's impossible to taste
or smell the changing amounts of
carbon dioxide in the air.

So maybe it's time to make
personal plastics-only piles, and
watch them grow in a corner, day
after day. At least we'll be keeping
our contribution to the Pacific
Garbage Patch right where we
can see it.

Holly will be writing from New
Zealand this quarter, where she'll
be counting up her plastic and dig
ging up tree roots. Send comments

Of course, plastic
production isn't the
onlyway humans
are making long
term changes to
the planet.
