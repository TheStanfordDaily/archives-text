# THE 						MIXED MESSAGES OF MODERNISM
## In student protests, let apathy ring? No. 
### D.S. Nelson 
There's nothing quite like a
professor's opinion to end a
debate. Replacing your own
thoughts with the comfortable
ability to endorse something that
seems respectable, even if foreign,
is easy and natural. So professors
rarely make their opinions known
in discussion, if only to prevent
section from becoming lousy with
students parroting them back until
the debate devolves into unthink
ing stagnancy.

Liberal arts colleges and uni
versities alike swear by their unbi
ased fostering of considered and
careful thought, but most, through
their professors and administra
tions, lend tacit or active sponsor
ship to a single creed.There's little
mystery as to what ideas leading
universities endorse. I have no
bone to pick with this consensus.
But the development of this tacit
agreement in academia may have
cost it exactly what it hoped to stir
up: active campus debates and po

litical action.
The resolution of controversy
is the most appropriate use of the
able mind. In college we are given
the opportunity to wade deeply
and forcefully into it. We have out
lets for expression of varieties po
litical, artistic and social. Yet it
somehow seems as though that
place has been superseded. "Oc
cupy the Future" and its ilk of Uni
versity-encouraged action do
more to hamstring students at
tempting to form political move
ments than help them. Many stu
dents are left with a troubling pic
ture of political life on campus,
and begin to feel a lament creep
ing up. We no longer have agency,
as could and was delivered
through university indifference.
Rather, we are provided with the
sense of a child being nudged by
his or her parent towards better
ideas, which does much to stifle
our zeal for action. Where there
was once the opportunity to revel

in the independence of our
thought, there is only a nagging
sense of obligation.
Not only does the attitude, real
or merely perceived, of our sur
roundings change the actions of
normal supporters, it muffles their
opposition. The similarity be
tween opinions voiced on campus
is almost choir-like in its exacti
tude, when material things are said
at all. Especially on social matters,
dialogue uniformly falls to one
side, and the other is ridiculed in
absentia. The dissidents are pres
ent yet confine themselves to their
own company. Those whose opin
ions don't line up feel the pressure
of knowing where campus author
ities' judgment will fall. As a result,
the possibility of an enlivening
clash and debate is much reduced.
Those who felt as though there
was a moral duty owed to act are
dissuaded by the absence of a fray
to dive into.

It is those professors who

brought about academia's consen
sus who are most disappointed by
its direction. Political fervor has
largely been by pre-professional
drive. In that, we have lost some
thing integral to that experience
which we call college. Rather than
being heady, our collegiate life is
focused around drive and persist
ence in the place of an intellectual
experience. Nowhere is this more
evident than in our extracurricular
pursuits.

The meat of our actions ex
presses our drive, but not our intel
ligence, and shows our desire to be
good people but neglects our need
to be thinking people. We have
shied away from being decisive in
our beliefs. We would rather serve
the community than seek to im
prove or criticize it with our minds.
It is hard to call our extracurricu
lar commitments fickle, as trans
parent as they may often seem.
While they may be motivated by a
simple sense of duty or the need
for a well-ornamented resume, I
would not call any of our commu
nity service clubs misguided on

those grounds. But on another I
certainly could. The most promi
nent feature of Stanford's ex
tracurricular activities is their
completely uncontroversial na
ture; our campus' most active
commitment is to avoiding that
which our professors want us to
greet head-on.
I believe that universities may
create better citizens today than
they did yesterday. Stanford does
nothing if not remind students
that they are duty-bound to the so
ciety that makes their achieve
ments possible. Anyone who re
members convocation can re
member the public and communi
ty service mantra. I can't speak to
how effective they are in that re
gard. I can say, however, that this

may be replacing a culture of
thinking with a utilitarian culture
that values thought so it can im
prove itself, but not materially
change.
It says more than most would
like to notice about Stanford's stu
dent body that the strongest polit
ical response comes from its facul
ty and administration, not its stu
dents. Our most prominent politi
cal expression or involvement is an
anemic protest in Meyer, and the
University-organized events were
twice as visible. I believe whole
heartedly that we students are ca
pable of creating lively and pas
sionate discourse, as well as action,
on campus. I also believe that we
can accomplish this far better in
dependently than the University's
prodding can stir us to.

ased fostering of considered and
careful thought, but most, through
their professors and administra
tions, lend tacit or active sponsor
ship to a single creed.There's little
mystery as to what ideas leading
universities endorse. I have no
bone to pick with this consensus.
But the development of this tacit
agreement in academia may have
cost it exactly what it hoped to stir
up: active campus debates and po

litical action.
The resolution of controversy
is the most appropriate use of the
able mind. In college we are given
the opportunity to wade deeply
and forcefully into it. We have out
lets for expression of varieties po
litical, artistic and social. Yet it
somehow seems as though that
place has been superseded. "Oc
cupy the Future" and its ilk of Uni
versity-encouraged action do
more to hamstring students at
tempting to form political move
ments than help them. Many stu
dents are left with a troubling pic
ture of political life on campus,
and begin to feel a lament creep
ing up. We no longer have agency,
as could and was delivered
through university indifference.
Rather, we are provided with the
sense of a child being nudged by
his or her parent towards better
ideas, which does much to stifle
our zeal for action. Where there
was once the opportunity to revel

in the independence of our
thought, there is only a nagging
sense of obligation.
Not only does the attitude, real
or merely perceived, of our sur
roundings change the actions of
normal supporters, it muffles their
opposition. The similarity be
tween opinions voiced on campus
is almost choir-like in its exacti
tude, when material things are said
at all. Especially on social matters,
dialogue uniformly falls to one
side, and the other is ridiculed in
absentia. The dissidents are pres
ent yet confine themselves to their
own company. Those whose opin
ions don't line up feel the pressure
of knowing where campus author
ities' judgment will fall. As a result,
the possibility of an enlivening
clash and debate is much reduced.
Those who felt as though there
was a moral duty owed to act are
dissuaded by the absence of a fray
to dive into.

It is those professors who

brought about academia's consen
sus who are most disappointed by
its direction. Political fervor has
largely been by pre-professional
drive. In that, we have lost some
thing integral to that experience
which we call college. Rather than
being heady, our collegiate life is
focused around drive and persist
ence in the place of an intellectual
experience. Nowhere is this more
evident than in our extracurricular
pursuits.

The meat of our actions ex
presses our drive, but not our intel
ligence, and shows our desire to be
good people but neglects our need
to be thinking people. We have
shied away from being decisive in
our beliefs. We would rather serve
the community than seek to im
prove or criticize it with our minds.
It is hard to call our extracurricu
lar commitments fickle, as trans
parent as they may often seem.
While they may be motivated by a
simple sense of duty or the need
for a well-ornamented resume, I
would not call any of our commu
nity service clubs misguided on

those grounds. But on another I
certainly could. The most promi
nent feature of Stanford's ex
tracurricular activities is their
completely uncontroversial na
ture; our campus' most active
commitment is to avoiding that
which our professors want us to
greet head-on.
I believe that universities may
create better citizens today than
they did yesterday. Stanford does
nothing if not remind students
that they are duty-bound to the so
ciety that makes their achieve
ments possible. Anyone who re
members convocation can re
member the public and communi
ty service mantra. I can't speak to
how effective they are in that re
gard. I can say, however, that this

may be replacing a culture of
thinking with a utilitarian culture
that values thought so it can im
prove itself, but not materially
change.
It says more than most would
like to notice about Stanford's stu
dent body that the strongest polit
ical response comes from its facul
ty and administration, not its stu
dents. Our most prominent politi
cal expression or involvement is an
anemic protest in Meyer, and the
University-organized events were
twice as visible. I believe whole
heartedly that we students are ca
pable of creating lively and pas
sionate discourse, as well as action,
on campus. I also believe that we
can accomplish this far better in
dependently than the University's
prodding can stir us to.

What better action can you take
than emailing Spencer at dsnel

There's nothing quite like a
professor's opinion to end a
debate. Replacing your own
thoughts with the comfortable
ability to endorse something that
seems respectable, even if foreign,
is easy and natural. So professors
rarely make their opinions known
in discussion, if only to prevent
section from becoming lousy with
students parroting them back until
the debate devolves into unthink
ing stagnancy.
