## LATE COLLAPSE BY CARD COUGARS STEAL HOME WIN 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
With Josh Owens hitting all
of his shots as Washington State
struggled to score at all, Stan
ford's men's basketball team ap
peared to be on its way to its
fourth win in a row. But the
Cougars heated up just as the
Cardinal went ice-cold and
Stanford's 13-point lead evapo
rated in the second half of an 81-
69 upset loss on Thursday night.

The loss dropped the Cardi
nal (15-4, 5-2 Pac-12) out of a
first-place tie in the conference,
but will likely sting Stanford
even more if coach Johnny
Dawkins' team cannot fix its
mistakes with road tests against
tougher opponents on the hori
zon.

Against one of the better de
fenses in the Pac-12, Stanford
came out hitting shots. Redshirt
senior Owens was having his
way on the low block, and
scored 10 points on 5-5 shooting
in the first half as the Cougars
(10-8,2-4) had no answer.
After hitting eight of its first
14 shots, however, the Cardinal

began to struggle from the field.
Sophomore Aaron Bright had a
tough shooting night, making
just two of his 12 shots and going

1-8 from behind the three-point
arc.

As a team, Stanford went 5-
15 to close out the half, but still
held a slim 29-27 lead at the
break thanks to a five-minute
stretch in which the Cougars did
not score.

When the teams returned
from the locker room, however,
it seemed as though the Cardi
nal had regained its offensive
rhythm. A flurry of three-point
ers with two in a row from
freshman guard Chasson Ran
dle stretched Stanford's lead
to 42-29 with 16:56 remaining.
And a three-point play from
Owens gave the Cardinal a 10-
point lead with just over 13 min
utes to go in the game.
That's when Washington
State keyed by guard Faisal
Aden absolutely caught fire.
It took just three minutes for
Stanford's double-digit advan
tage to vanish entirely, as the
Cougars outscored the Cardinal
12-1 and hit field goals on five
consecutive offensive trips.
Aden scored 14 points in the
next seven minutes and 10
straight for his team at one point
taking over the game as part
of his 33-point night for which
Stanford had no answer.

Although the Cardinal kept
the game relatively close, no one
on the floor could buy a basket,
going 0-10 from the field over an
11 -minute stretch in the second

Senior Josh Owens was perfect from the floor, but his 19 points weren't
enough for Stanford in Thursday's 81-69 loss. The Cardinal only had
one other scorer in double figures, freshman guard Chasson Randle.
