## Stanford starts season without Klahn 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
This recent stretch of cold
weather notwithstanding, spring
is in the air here on the Farm, and
that means one thing for the
Stanford men's tennis team: The
season is about to start. The 2011-
12 Cardinal team is looking to
avenge last year's nail-biting de
feat at the hands of the Virginia
Cavaliers in the quarterfinals of
the NCAA Tournament, held at
Stanford's home court, the Taube
Family Tennis Center.
The deciding match in that
contest came down to senior

Alex Clayton, one of three de
parting members along with
classmates Ted Kelly and Greg
Hirshmann. The three new fresh
men represent a subtle shift for
the Stanford team in that two of
them are international: Gregory
Zerkalov is from Moscow and
John Morrissey is from Dublin.
The third freshman, Robert

normally would because Bradley
Klahn is out with an injury for at
least the next month.

Klahn, a senior who is a for
mer NCAA singles champion,
has been the team's No. 1 player
for more than two seasons, and

his absence will surely be a tough
void for Whitlinger to fill early in
the season.

"[The injury] gives another
guy a chance to step up and play
and prove himself, and that can
be a really good thing,"
Whitlinger said. "When you lose
your No. 1 player, a guy who is an
NCAA champion, it definitely
creates a bit of a dilemma but
this is a deep team and in the
coming matches I guess we'll see
just how deep it is. We've got
some challenging matches com
ing up, but these are matches that
