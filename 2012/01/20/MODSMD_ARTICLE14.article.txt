## Stanford starts season without Klahn 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
This recent stretch of cold
weather notwithstanding, spring
is in the air here on the Farm, and
that means one thing for the
Stanford men's tennis team: The
season is about to start. The 2011-
12 Cardinal team is looking to
avenge last year's nail-biting de
feat at the hands of the Virginia
Cavaliers in the quarterfinals of
the NCAA Tournament, held at
Stanford's home court, the Taube
Family Tennis Center.
The deciding match in that
contest came down to senior

Alex Clayton, one of three de
parting members along with
classmates Ted Kelly and Greg
Hirshmann. The three new fresh
men represent a subtle shift for
the Stanford team in that two of
them are international: Gregory
Zerkalov is from Moscow and
John Morrissey is from Dublin.
The third freshman, Robert
Stineman, hails from Winnetka,
111.

The Stanford men's tennis
team has been renowned, of late,
for being one of the few top col
legiate programs to recruit al
most exclusively in the United
States. This year's batch of fresh

man shows that head tennis
coach John Whitlinger seems to
be bucking his personal recruit
ing trends and following trends
of the nation's other top pro
grams in international recruiting.
The three new freshmen, as
well as the rest of last year's un
derclassmen, are likely to be
thrust into action early and often
this season, more so than they
normally would because Bradley
Klahn is out with an injury for at
least the next month.

Klahn, a senior who is a for
mer NCAA singles champion,
has been the team's No. 1 player
for more than two seasons, and

his absence will surely be a tough
void for Whitlinger to fill early in
the season.

"[The injury] gives another
guy a chance to step up and play
and prove himself, and that can
be a really good thing,"
Whitlinger said. "When you lose
your No. 1 player, a guy who is an
NCAA champion, it definitely
creates a bit of a dilemma but
this is a deep team and in the
coming matches I guess we'll see
just how deep it is. We've got
some challenging matches com
ing up, but these are matches that
we are really excited to be play
ing."

The Cardinal starts the season
ranked No. 6 in the country be
hind powerhouses USC, Virginia,
Ohio State, Georgia and Baylor.
USC is the two-time defending
national champion and the Cardi
nal players certainly have their
two dual-match meetings with the
Trojans the first on Feb. 3 at

Taube, the second on April 14 in
L.A.

Coach Whitlinger is happy
with the No. 6 ranking, but con
cedes, "there is a long way to go
until May."
May is the culminating month
of the college tennis season; the
month that all coaches build their
teams up for. May is the month of
the NCAA Championship, held
this year at Georgia. By May the
Cardinal will assuredly have their
stud, Bradley Klahn, back on the
court, changing the tenor of a
team that will have played for
more than a month in his absence.

Until then, however,
Whitlinger says his squad must
strive "to get a little better every
day, every match, to discover ex
actly what kind of team we have."

The men's tennis team is excit
ed to get its dual-match season off
on the right foot when it travels to
Oklahoma to meet Tulsa and the
University of North Carolina. The
Cardinal will then return home
for a seven-match home-stand
beginning Jan. 27 against St.
Mary's.

Former NCAA singles champion senior Bradley Klahn will miss the first month of the season with an injury,
leaving head coach John Whitlinger with more young players to insert into matches, at least for now.
