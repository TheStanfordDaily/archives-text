# 49ers have Giant shoes to fill
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
The Giants have a lot more in
common with the 49ers
than you might think. I'm
not referring to the New
York Giants here. Well, I
guess I am, if you're thinking back to
the 19505. Youknow,when theyplayed
at the Polo Grounds? I'm talking
about the G-Men... no, that doesn't
help either.
Let's try that again.

The beard-growing, torture-induc
ing, 2010-World-Series-winning San
Francisco baseball Giants (hereafter
"Los Gigantes") have a lot more in
common with the 49ers than you
might think.
For one, even though Los Gigantes
left the 49ers to fend for themselves
against Candlestick Park's torrential
winds more than a decade ago, the two
teams do both play in the same city.
Glad to have that established.

Besides just the geographical simi
larity, it's notable that the two teams
share the same fan base.The Bay Area
fan is a rare specimen, often lying dor
mant for years before emerging with a
triumphant' 'I truly do fear the beard!"
or a boasting "Did you know that An
drew Luck plays football at the school
I went to 25 years ago (but haven't
been to a game at since) ?'' We don't al
ways make for the best attendance
numbers, but our own brand of city
wide bandwagoning comes across as
overwhelming support whenever
someone mutters the word "champi
onship."

That's not to say that the 49ers
don't have any dedicated fans, the type
that flies back from their respective
East Coast college for a weekend of
playoff football or misses the dorm's
ski trip in order to catch the game, (I
know both.) But there's a certain gen
eral-public buzz around this 49ers
team —the same buzz that followed
Los Gigantes when they won it all in
2010 —that has got to be uplifting for
the coaches and players.
When it comes to the gridiron, the
13-3 49ers have made their way into
the NFL's elite with a stifling defense in
a season otherwise dominated by
record-breaking quarterback per
formances. Sure, Frank Gore and Alex
Smith have put together solid seasons,
but San Francisco's heart and soul lies
in its defense. Doesn't that remind you
of when Los Gigantes took home the
World Series two years ago, relying on
arguably the most dangerous pitching
staff in the NL and an offense that was
middle-of-the-road at best?

Just as importantly, the squad has
one hell of a coach in Jim Harbaugh.
He might not have as much pro-level
coaching experience as Bruce
Bochy, who took Los Gigantes to the
World Series in his 16th year as an
MLB manager, but if Harbaugh's
time at Stanford told you anything,
it's that his players usually outper
form expectations. That's no coinci
dence.

But I'd argue that the 49ers re
semble their baseball-playing coun
terparts most of all because of the ad
versity they've had to overcome.
There was the difficulty of turning
around a losing team despite a lock
out-shortened offseason, just like the
roster overhaul Los Gigantes under
went before (and during) the 2010
season. There was the bad ER. from
the preseason-game parking-lot
shooting in August, just like the Barry

Bonds steroid allegations cloud that
continued to hang over AT&T Park.
There was the challenge of getting
Smith to live up to the expectations of
a one-time first-overall draft pick, just

like the (failed) struggle for Barry Zito
to pitch like he deserved his seven
year, $126-million contract.

Even last weekend, there was the
need for the 49ers to put together a
last-minute drive to knock off the
Saints and move on to the NFC title
game, just like Los Gigantes squeaked
out a series win over the Phillies with
an eighth-inning home run.
The Bay Area has only had two
professional major-sport teams win ti
tles in a five-year span once before,
when the Oakland A's took home
three straight World Series (1972-
1974) and the Golden State Warrior's
won the 1975 NBA title. Could the
two San Francisco teams pull off the
feat again?
The pieces are in place, but there's
still a Giant game to be played Sunday.
And hopefully, a Super one after that.

Don't ever accuse Joseph Bey da of
jumping on the 49er bandwagon be
cause, unlike the bandwagoners he
refers to, "Bunting Bey da " is as much
a Bay Area sports fan as his last name
suggests. Send him stories of fake
fans' tomfoolery at jbeyda@stan

I went to 25 years ago (but haven't
been to a game at since) ?'' We don't al
ways make for the best attendance
numbers, but our own brand of city
wide bandwagoning comes across as
overwhelming support whenever
someone mutters the word "champi

That's not to say that the 49ers
don't have any dedicated fans, the type
that flies back from their respective
East Coast college for a weekend of
playoff football or misses the dorm's
ski trip in order to catch the game, (I
know both.) But there's a certain gen
eral-public buzz around this 49ers
team —the same buzz that followed
Los Gigantes when they won it all in
2010 —that has got to be uplifting for
the coaches and players.
When it comes to the gridiron, the
13-3 49ers have made their way into
the NFL's elite with a stifling defense in
a season otherwise dominated by
record-breaking quarterback per
formances. Sure, Frank Gore and Alex
Smith have put together solid seasons,
but San Francisco's heart and soul lies
in its defense. Doesn't that remind you
of when Los Gigantes took home the
World Series two years ago, relying on
arguably the most dangerous pitching
staff in the NL and an offense that was
middle-of-the-road at best?

Just as importantly, the squad has
one hell of a coach in Jim Harbaugh.
He might not have as much pro-level
coaching experience as Bruce
Bochy, who took Los Gigantes to the
World Series in his 16th year as an
MLB manager, but if Harbaugh's
time at Stanford told you anything,
it's that his players usually outper
form expectations. That's no coinci
dence.

But I'd argue that the 49ers re
semble their baseball-playing coun
terparts most of all because of the ad
versity they've had to overcome.
There was the difficulty of turning
around a losing team despite a lock
out-shortened offseason, just like the
roster overhaul Los Gigantes under
went before (and during) the 2010
season. There was the bad ER. from
the preseason-game parking-lot
shooting in August, just like the Barry

Bonds steroid allegations cloud that
continued to hang over AT&T Park.
There was the challenge of getting
Smith to live up to the expectations of
a one-time first-overall draft pick, just

like the (failed) struggle for Barry Zito
to pitch like he deserved his seven
year, $126-million contract.

Even last weekend, there was the
need for the 49ers to put together a
last-minute drive to knock off the
Saints and move on to the NFC title
game, just like Los Gigantes squeaked
out a series win over the Phillies with
an eighth-inning home run.
The Bay Area has only had two
professional major-sport teams win ti
tles in a five-year span once before,
when the Oakland A's took home
three straight World Series (1972-
1974) and the Golden State Warrior's
won the 1975 NBA title. Could the
two San Francisco teams pull off the
feat again?
The pieces are in place, but there's
still a Giant game to be played Sunday.
And hopefully, a Super one after that.

Don't ever accuse Joseph Bey da of
jumping on the 49er bandwagon be

refers to, "Bunting Bey da " is as much
a Bay Area sports fan as his last name

The Giants have a lot more in
common with the 49ers
than you might think. I'm
not referring to the New
York Giants here. Well, I
guess I am, if you're thinking back to
the 19505. Youknow,when theyplayed
at the Polo Grounds? I'm talking
about the G-Men... no, that doesn't
help either.
Let's try that again.

The beard-growing, torture-induc
ing, 2010-World-Series-winning San
Francisco baseball Giants (hereafter
"Los Gigantes") have a lot more in
common with the 49ers than you
might think.
For one, even though Los Gigantes
left the 49ers to fend for themselves
against Candlestick Park's torrential
winds more than a decade ago, the two
teams do both play in the same city.
Glad to have that established.

Besides just the geographical simi
larity, it's notable that the two teams
share the same fan base.The Bay Area
