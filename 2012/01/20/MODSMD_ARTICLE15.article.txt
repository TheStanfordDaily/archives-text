# 49ers have Giant shoes to fill
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
The Giants have a lot more in
common with the 49ers
than you might think. I'm
not referring to the New
York Giants here. Well, I
guess I am, if you're thinking back to
the 19505. Youknow,when theyplayed
at the Polo Grounds? I'm talking
about the G-Men... no, that doesn't
help either.
Let's try that again.

The beard-growing, torture-induc
ing, 2010-World-Series-winning San
Francisco baseball Giants (hereafter
"Los Gigantes") have a lot more in
common with the 49ers than you
might think.
For one, even though Los Gigantes
left the 49ers to fend for themselves
against Candlestick Park's torrential
winds more than a decade ago, the two
teams do both play in the same city.
Glad to have that established.

Besides just the geographical simi
larity, it's notable that the two teams
share the same fan base.The Bay Area
fan is a rare specimen, often lying dor
mant for years before emerging with a
triumphant' 'I truly do fear the beard!"
or a boasting "Did you know that An
drew Luck plays football at the school
I went to 25 years ago (but haven't
been to a game at since) ?'' We don't al
ways make for the best attendance
numbers, but our own brand of city
wide bandwagoning comes across as
overwhelming support whenever
someone mutters the word "champi
onship."

That's not to say that the 49ers
don't have any dedicated fans, the type
that flies back from their respective
East Coast college for a weekend of
playoff football or misses the dorm's
ski trip in order to catch the game, (I
know both.) But there's a certain gen
eral-public buzz around this 49ers
team —the same buzz that followed
Los Gigantes when they won it all in
2010 —that has got to be uplifting for
the coaches and players.
When it comes to the gridiron, the
13-3 49ers have made their way into
the NFL's elite with a stifling defense in
a season otherwise dominated by
record-breaking quarterback per
formances. Sure, Frank Gore and Alex
Smith have put together solid seasons,
but San Francisco's heart and soul lies
in its defense. Doesn't that remind you
of when Los Gigantes took home the
World Series two years ago, relying on
arguably the most dangerous pitching
