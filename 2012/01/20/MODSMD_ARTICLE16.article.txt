# ANOTHER HOME BLOWOUT
## CARD BREEZES BY COUGARS AT MAPLES 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At Maples Pavilion last night the Stanford
women's basketball team routed Washington State
75-41 to tighten its grasp on top spot in the Pac-12
conference.

The No. 4 Cardinal (17-1,7-0 Pac-12) came into
this game unbeaten in 52 games against the
Cougars (9-9,3-3), on a 12-game winning streak and
facing an opponent that had dropped its last two
contests, but none of that seemed to matter at the
start.

Washington State pushed hard from the tip-off,
scoring the first bucket and keeping up an intense
rhythm that worked noticeably to its advantage.
Both teams were running full pace up and down the
court in attack and defense, leading to errors on
both sides, but because Stanford was never able to
really settle, it struggled early on to make home ad
vantage count. With 7:54 gone in the first half the
Cougars led by four and were shooting close to 50
percent while the Card was struggling to break 30
percent from the field. From that point, though, the
tide began to turn and Stanford went on a 20-5 run
to close out the half with an 11-point lead.
"Washington State plays a great 3-2 zone," ex
plained sophomore forward Chiney Ogwumike.
"They're really aggressive, and it takes a little while
for you to feel your way through as an offense. We
were just trying to make the proper adjustments ..

entry passes. It just took us a while to get our

rhythm, but it's always good when
you can find that early in the
game," she said.
Stanford brought this im
proved form back for the second
period, steadily extending its lead,
while the Cougars couldn't repeat
the intensity that had caused the
Card problems early on. While
the WSU defense made just three
steals in the game, all in the first
half, the Cardinal made 12 by the
final buzzer, and by the end of the
contest Stanford was shooting
better than its opponent.

While both senior forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike and her
sister Chiney recorded double
doubles with 22 points and 10
rebounds, and 19 and 12, respec
tively Stanford received im
proved contributions from the
bench. Shooting, though, is cer
tainly an area where work is still
needed, particularly after the
Cardinal shot 4-for-20 from be
hind the three-point arc. Howev
er, Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer was clearly buoyed by
the performance in general, and
was particularly upbeat about this
black mark.

"I know we have great shoot
ers on our team and I'm excited
that we're doing so well and
shooting poorly," VanDerveer
said. "It's almost scary when
you're shooting really, really well
and you win, because then what if
you have an off night?"
Next up for the Card is Wash

71-47 loss to California this
Saturday at 2 p.m.
