## Squad looks to continue Pac-12 streak 
### PALANI ESWARAN STAFF WRITER 
This weekend the Stanford wrestling team
will face off against the San Francisco State
Gators and the Southern Oregon Raiders.
Stanford (6-5, 3-0) is coming off a big con
ference win against Cal Poly, and the team
hopes to carry its momentum through this
weekend. San Francisco State (3-4) lost to Cal
Poly recently and will try to bounce back
against another tough Pac-12 opponent. The
only tournament in which both of these teams
competed was the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invita
tional in early December, with Stanford finish
ing 25th overall and San Francisco State com
ing in 31st.
Southern Oregon is 6-2, and they have been
wrestling extremely well lately. The Raiders
are coming off a 41-3 win over Pacific, and
prior to that dual they finished third at the
Cliff Keen National Duals.
Both the Raiders and the Cardinal compet
ed in the Reno Tournament of Champions in
December. Southern Oregon finished 11th,
and Stanford finished 16th. It might seem as if
Southern Oregon has the edge going into this
weekend, but when Stanford wrestled in Reno,
the team was without top-ranked 174-pounder
Nick Amuchastegui. If he had wrestled, he
would have most likely placed, if not won, and
the Card would have finished much higher
than 16th.
While a team never wants to look past an
opponent, this weekend's duals shouldn't be
too much trouble for Stanford. The Cardinal is
a top-25 team in Division I, whereas San Fran
cisco State is a Division II program and South
ern Oregon competes in the NAIA. A loss this
weekend would be a huge disappointment and
would greatly slow down the squad's momen
