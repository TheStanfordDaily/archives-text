## Squad looks to continue Pac-12 streak 
### PALANI ESWARAN STAFF WRITER 
This weekend the Stanford wrestling team
will face off against the San Francisco State
Gators and the Southern Oregon Raiders.
Stanford (6-5, 3-0) is coming off a big con
ference win against Cal Poly, and the team
hopes to carry its momentum through this
weekend. San Francisco State (3-4) lost to Cal
Poly recently and will try to bounce back
against another tough Pac-12 opponent. The
only tournament in which both of these teams
competed was the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invita
tional in early December, with Stanford finish
ing 25th overall and San Francisco State com
ing in 31st.
Southern Oregon is 6-2, and they have been
wrestling extremely well lately. The Raiders
are coming off a 41-3 win over Pacific, and
prior to that dual they finished third at the
Cliff Keen National Duals.
Both the Raiders and the Cardinal compet
ed in the Reno Tournament of Champions in
December. Southern Oregon finished 11th,
and Stanford finished 16th. It might seem as if
Southern Oregon has the edge going into this
weekend, but when Stanford wrestled in Reno,
the team was without top-ranked 174-pounder
Nick Amuchastegui. If he had wrestled, he
would have most likely placed, if not won, and
the Card would have finished much higher
than 16th.
While a team never wants to look past an
opponent, this weekend's duals shouldn't be
too much trouble for Stanford. The Cardinal is
a top-25 team in Division I, whereas San Fran
cisco State is a Division II program and South
ern Oregon competes in the NAIA. A loss this
weekend would be a huge disappointment and
would greatly slow down the squad's momen
tum as the team heads into the home stretch of
the season.

There are some matchups
that will be tough for Stanford
wrestlers this weekend. San
Francisco State's Isaiah Jimenez
is ranked No. 8 in the 165-pound
weight class in Division II and
will likely face Cardinal redshirt
sophomore Bret Baumbach,
who is coming off a win against
Cal Poly.
Southern Oregon has four
wrestlers who are ranked in the
NAlA.Their top wrestler is No. 1
Mitchell Lofstedt at 125 pounds.
Stanford forfeited that weight
class against Cal Poly, but who
ever wrestles Lofstedt will defi
nitely have to fight hard.
At 174 pounds the Raiders
will send out No. 2 Brock Gutch
es against Amuchastegui. It
looks like this might be a close
match, but it wouldn't be sur
prising if Amuchastegui domi
nated, just as he did against a
top-five opponent this past
weekend.

Redshirt junior Spence
Patrick of Stanford will face No.
3 Austin Vanderford. Patrick has
wrestled especially well in 2012,
and this match will be a good test
for him. Southern Oregon's final
ranked wrestler is No. 8 Bubba
Owens, who will wrestle against
sophomore Dan Scherer.
Despite some tough matches
in this weekend's duals, expect
the Card to carry their momen
tum and come out on top.

The Cardinal will wrestle
against the Gators on Friday at 7
p.m. in San Francisco and against
the Raiders on Saturday at 1
p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
