# SWIMMING & DIVING
## Arizona foes pack Avery this weekend 
### GEORGE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Calling Stanford swimming and diving's
schedule for the next two days "action
packed" would be an understatement.

Both the men's and women's Cardinal
swimmers and divers are set to compete in
back-to-back home dual meets starting tomor
row. The two-day stretch will see Stanford host
both Arizona schools in the Pac-12, one of the
nation's most respected conferences in swim
ming and diving. The Cardinal will square off
with Arizona State on Friday, followed by a
quick turnaround to compete against Arizona
on Saturday.

On the men's side, the No. 3 Cardinal is un
defeated in dual meet competition so far this
season at 5-0 and hopes to improve to 7-0 by
Saturday afternoon. Although no team in the
Pac-12 should be overlooked, Stanford should
not be seriously challenged in Friday's
matchup against Arizona State, as the Sun
Devils are coming into the meet with a 0-5
record. The tougher test will come on Satur
day, when the Cardinal takes on the Arizona
Wildcats, the No. 1 team in the nation. Al
though the results of NCAA Championships
are ultimately more important than mid-sea
son rankings, the showdown between the No. 1
and No. 3 teams will certainly prove to be an
intriguing matchup as well as one of the

biggest collegiate dual meets of the season.
Arizona's lineup of men's swimmers is im
pressive to say the least, with multiple swim
mers nationally ranked in the top five in indi
vidual events. The Wildcats wouldn't be
ranked No. 1 without some of the country's
fastest swimmers, showcasing a pair of senior
stars. In both the 200 backstroke and 200 indi
vidual medley, Arizona senior Cory Chitwood
currently owns the nation's fastest times by al
most two full seconds. Senior Austen Thomp
son also has the fastest 400 individual medley
time by an absurd margin of six seconds.
Not to be outdone, Stanford has its own ar-
senal of fast swimmers. Freshman
David Nolan embodies versatility
as he has some of the country's
fastest times in multiple events,
including top-10 times in the 200
individual medley, 200 back
stroke, 100 freestyle and 100
butterfly. Senior Bobby Bollier
is ranked second in the 200 but
terfly, senior Chad La Tourette
third in the 1650 freestyle and
senior Curtis Lovelace seventh
in the 200 breaststroke. La
Tourette has been especially
dominant in the distance events
in dual meet situations, holding
a 19-event win streak and win
ning 21 out of 22 events in his
collegiate career. In fact, La
Tourette hasn't lost since his
freshman year, and those losses
were against Stanford teammates.

The Cardinal divers will also
be critical if Stanford is to pull off
the upset, with freshman Kristian
Ipsen and senior Taylor Sishc
both coming off wins from the
Cardinal Diving Invitational last

weekend.
The women's team will face
equally stiff competition, facing
two top-25 teams in No. 24 Ari
zona State and No. 5 Arizona.
Against these two teams, history
is clearly on Stanford's side. The
Cardinal has been undefeated
against Arizona State in dual
meets since 2001 while also car
rying an eight-meet winning
streak against Arizona. Current
ly ranked sixth in the nation, the
women's swimmers and divers
will have their hands full in back
to-back top-25 matchups, but
they will also have an opportuni
ty to showcase some fast times.

The women's team is especial
ly stellar in the sprint events. Sen
ior Sam Woodward is ranked sec
ond nationally in the 100 butter
fly and fifth in the 50 freestyle. In
fact, there are three Cardinal
swimmers in the national top 12
for the 50 freestyle. It should be
no surprise, then, that the team
currently has the fastest time in
the 200 freestyle relay and sec
ond-fastest time in the 400
freestyle relay on the national
stage. The Cardinal sprinters,
however, will have to face Ari
zona's Margo Geer, who owns

the nation's third-fastest time in
the 100 freestyle and fifth-fastest
time in the 50 freestyle.
Also crucial for the Cardinal's
success is the speed of sopho
more backstroke star Maya Di-
Rado, who currently owns the
fastest time in the nation in the
200 backstroke and top-three
times in the 200 and 400 individ
ual medley. Di√üado will try to
hold off Arizona's fourth-ranked
Sarah Denninghoff in the 200
backstroke and a pair of Wildcat
individual medley swimmers
who are in the top 25. On the div
ing board, sophomore Stephanie
Phipps, who swept the spring
board events at last weekend's
Cardinal Invitational, will look
to rack up as many points as she
can.

The women's team will com
pete against Arizona State at 2
p.m. on Friday and Arizona at 11
a.m. on Saturday at the Avery
Aquatic Center. The men's team
will face off against Arizona
State at noon on Friday and Ari
zona at 11 a.m. on Saturday at 11
a.m., also at Avery.
