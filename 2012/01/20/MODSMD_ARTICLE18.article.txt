# SWIMMING & DIVING
## Arizona foes pack Avery this weekend 
### GEORGE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Calling Stanford swimming and diving's
schedule for the next two days "action
packed" would be an understatement.

Both the men's and women's Cardinal
swimmers and divers are set to compete in
back-to-back home dual meets starting tomor
row. The two-day stretch will see Stanford host
both Arizona schools in the Pac-12, one of the
nation's most respected conferences in swim

with Arizona State on Friday, followed by a
quick turnaround to compete against Arizona

On the men's side, the No. 3 Cardinal is un
defeated in dual meet competition so far this
season at 5-0 and hopes to improve to 7-0 by
Saturday afternoon. Although no team in the
Pac-12 should be overlooked, Stanford should
not be seriously challenged in Friday's
matchup against Arizona State, as the Sun
Devils are coming into the meet with a 0-5
record. The tougher test will come on Satur
day, when the Cardinal takes on the Arizona
Wildcats, the No. 1 team in the nation. Al
though the results of NCAA Championships
are ultimately more important than mid-sea
son rankings, the showdown between the No. 1
and No. 3 teams will certainly prove to be an
intriguing matchup as well as one of the

biggest collegiate dual meets of the season.

pressive to say the least, with multiple swim
mers nationally ranked in the top five in indi
vidual events. The Wildcats wouldn't be
ranked No. 1 without some of the country's
fastest swimmers, showcasing a pair of senior
stars. In both the 200 backstroke and 200 indi
vidual medley, Arizona senior Cory Chitwood
currently owns the nation's fastest times by al
most two full seconds. Senior Austen Thomp
son also has the fastest 400 individual medley
time by an absurd margin of six seconds.
Not to be outdone, Stanford has its own ar-
