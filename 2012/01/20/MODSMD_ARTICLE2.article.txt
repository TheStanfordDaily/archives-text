## Americans Elect takes root on Farm Students, professors plan March event to publicize online nomination system 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Americans Elect, a new political movement
looking to place its own non-partisan presiden
tial candidate on ballots across the 50 states, has
taken root at Stanford.

Student volunteers have joined the move
ment, though it does not have a registered stu
dent group on campus, and renowned faculty
have expressed support, amid speculation
about who among them might become candi
dates.

"Americans Elect is a 'second way' to nomi
nate a president, not a traditional third party,"
states the Americans Elect website. "Our
process is open to any qualified candidate and
any registered voter no matter their party."
Any registered voter, regardless of party,
need only sign up as a delegate online with
Americans Elect to nominate qualified candi
dates or to demonstrate support for those previ
ously nominated. This process serves as the con
vention through which Americans Elect will se
lect its presidential candidate by June 2012.
"I think that it has a good chance to do some
thing very innovative in American politics, and
that is to present... an independent presiden
tial candidate who is ... the product of a very,
very broad participatory and deliberative
process," said Larry Diamond, Hoover fellow
and director of Stanford's Center on Democra
cy, Development and the Rule of Law
(CDDRL) at the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies. "I think it has the poten
tial to do that."

While some view Americans Elect as a de
tractor from partisan candidates or as a lost
cause, Americans Elect provides a reportedly
secure voting method that allows delegates to
vote in partisan primaries as well as in the inde
pendent nominations. The group has achieved
ballot access in 15 states, including California,
Florida and Michigan, with 2,391,957 signatures
toward a directly nominated ticket.
"The big question that remains unanswered
is who's going to put themselves forward as a
credible ticket," Diamond said. "Much of the fu
ture of Americans Elect depends on that."
Diamond himself has been named as a po
tential candidate to come out of the process, but
laughed at the suggestion.

"Absolutely not. Under no circumstance," he
said, when asked about the possibility. "First of
all, I don't even think I would qualify ... it's so
