## Americans Elect takes root on Farm Students, professors plan March event to publicize online nomination system 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Americans Elect, a new political movement
looking to place its own non-partisan presiden
tial candidate on ballots across the 50 states, has
taken root at Stanford.

Student volunteers have joined the move
ment, though it does not have a registered stu
dent group on campus, and renowned faculty
have expressed support, amid speculation
about who among them might become candi
dates.

"Americans Elect is a 'second way' to nomi
nate a president, not a traditional third party,"
states the Americans Elect website. "Our
process is open to any qualified candidate and
any registered voter no matter their party."
Any registered voter, regardless of party,
need only sign up as a delegate online with
Americans Elect to nominate qualified candi
dates or to demonstrate support for those previ
ously nominated. This process serves as the con
vention through which Americans Elect will se
lect its presidential candidate by June 2012.
"I think that it has a good chance to do some
thing very innovative in American politics, and
that is to present... an independent presiden
tial candidate who is ... the product of a very,
very broad participatory and deliberative
process," said Larry Diamond, Hoover fellow
and director of Stanford's Center on Democra
cy, Development and the Rule of Law
(CDDRL) at the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies. "I think it has the poten
tial to do that."

While some view Americans Elect as a de
tractor from partisan candidates or as a lost
cause, Americans Elect provides a reportedly
secure voting method that allows delegates to
vote in partisan primaries as well as in the inde
pendent nominations. The group has achieved
ballot access in 15 states, including California,
Florida and Michigan, with 2,391,957 signatures
toward a directly nominated ticket.
"The big question that remains unanswered
is who's going to put themselves forward as a
credible ticket," Diamond said. "Much of the fu
ture of Americans Elect depends on that."
Diamond himself has been named as a po
tential candidate to come out of the process, but
laughed at the suggestion.

"Absolutely not. Under no circumstance," he
said, when asked about the possibility. "First of
all, I don't even think I would qualify ... it's so


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
outlandish and ridiculous, it's
funny."
Diamond mentioned that, be
fore endorsing Mitt Romney, Jon
Huntsman would have been a po
tential candidate for Americans
Elect. While Huntsman's choice
to endorse may have taken his
name out of the running, among
the other most tracked candi
dates on the website are Ron
Paul, President Obama and
Bernie Sanders.
Americans Elect's student
supporters at Stanford are equal
ly optimistic about the nomina
tion system. A recent program
ming drawback forced the associ
ated student committee to
reschedule a panel event for Fri
day, Jan. 20, to an unspecified date
in March. Despite the setbacks,
Americans Elect is looking for
ward to a revamped, highly publi
cized event.

"I think since it's such a high
profile event with some really big
name professors in academia and
also some outside experts, hope
fully it will attract a lot of atten
tion," said Americans Elect cam
pus leader and director of finance
Darren Hau 'l5. "We're hoping to
get an auditorium that seats
maybe 300 to 400 people."

Hau noted that the Americans
Elect student group has yet to be
officially recognized by the Uni
versity and, as a result, was unable
to secure a location with enough
time to fundraise for the event.
Meanwhile, Diamond explained
that a Friday afternoon event
would likely draw a lower atten
dance than a more strategically
timed panel in the spring. Among
the speakers invited to the panel
event were David Kennedy, co-di
rector of The Bill Lane Center for
the American West at Stanford;
Khalil Byrd, CEO of Americans
Elect; Tucker Bonds, former
spokesman of the McCain 'OB
campaign; and Diamond.
In addition to the group's ef
forts to become a recognized stu

dent group on campus and draw
students to a panel presentation,
the Stanford committee for
Americans Elect has publicized
in White Plaza, prompting be
tween 60 and 70 students to join
the group's mailing list.

"I believe Stanford has more
students signed up for the Ameri
cans Elect emailing list than any
other campus," said student vol
unteer Josh Grinberg, 'l5. "So in
that regard, the Stanford campus
is most aware and most active."

Americans Elect has the po
tential to add a third ticket to bal
lots across America. The group
hopes to make a broad, grass
roots appeal with efforts similar
to those currently taking shape at
Stanford's campus.
"We just want to re-engage
people," Hau said. "Besides pro
moting awareness of Americans
Elect, we want to tell people that.
. . you can actually participate
constructively in politics."

pendent nominations. The group has achieved
ballot access in 15 states, including California,
Florida and Michigan, with 2,391,957 signatures
toward a directly nominated ticket.
"The big question that remains unanswered
is who's going to put themselves forward as a
credible ticket," Diamond said. "Much of the fu
ture of Americans Elect depends on that."
Diamond himself has been named as a po
tential candidate to come out of the process, but
laughed at the suggestion.

"Absolutely not. Under no circumstance," he
said, when asked about the possibility. "First of
all, I don't even think I would qualify ... it's so

outlandish and ridiculous, it's
funny."
Diamond mentioned that, be
fore endorsing Mitt Romney, Jon
Huntsman would have been a po
tential candidate for Americans
Elect. While Huntsman's choice
to endorse may have taken his
name out of the running, among
the other most tracked candi
dates on the website are Ron
Paul, President Obama and
Bernie Sanders.
Americans Elect's student
supporters at Stanford are equal
ly optimistic about the nomina
tion system. A recent program
ming drawback forced the associ
ated student committee to
reschedule a panel event for Fri
day, Jan. 20, to an unspecified date
in March. Despite the setbacks,
Americans Elect is looking for
ward to a revamped, highly publi
cized event.

"I think since it's such a high
profile event with some really big
name professors in academia and
also some outside experts, hope
fully it will attract a lot of atten
tion," said Americans Elect cam
pus leader and director of finance
Darren Hau 'l5. "We're hoping to
get an auditorium that seats
maybe 300 to 400 people."

Hau noted that the Americans
Elect student group has yet to be
officially recognized by the Uni
versity and, as a result, was unable
to secure a location with enough
time to fundraise for the event.
Meanwhile, Diamond explained
that a Friday afternoon event
would likely draw a lower atten
dance than a more strategically
timed panel in the spring. Among
the speakers invited to the panel
event were David Kennedy, co-di
rector of The Bill Lane Center for
the American West at Stanford;
Khalil Byrd, CEO of Americans
Elect; Tucker Bonds, former
spokesman of the McCain 'OB
campaign; and Diamond.
In addition to the group's ef
forts to become a recognized stu

dent group on campus and draw
students to a panel presentation,
the Stanford committee for
Americans Elect has publicized
in White Plaza, prompting be
tween 60 and 70 students to join
the group's mailing list.

"I believe Stanford has more
students signed up for the Ameri
cans Elect emailing list than any
other campus," said student vol
unteer Josh Grinberg, 'l5. "So in
that regard, the Stanford campus
is most aware and most active."

Americans Elect has the po
tential to add a third ticket to bal
lots across America. The group
hopes to make a broad, grass
roots appeal with efforts similar
to those currently taking shape at
Stanford's campus.
"We just want to re-engage
people," Hau said. "Besides pro
moting awareness of Americans
Elect, we want to tell people that.
. . you can actually participate
constructively in politics."

Americans Elect, a new political movement
looking to place its own non-partisan presiden
tial candidate on ballots across the 50 states, has
taken root at Stanford.

Student volunteers have joined the move
ment, though it does not have a registered stu
dent group on campus, and renowned faculty
have expressed support, amid speculation
about who among them might become candi
dates.

"Americans Elect is a 'second way' to nomi
nate a president, not a traditional third party,"
states the Americans Elect website. "Our
process is open to any qualified candidate and
any registered voter no matter their party."
Any registered voter, regardless of party,
need only sign up as a delegate online with
Americans Elect to nominate qualified candi
dates or to demonstrate support for those previ
ously nominated. This process serves as the con
vention through which Americans Elect will se
lect its presidential candidate by June 2012.
"I think that it has a good chance to do some
thing very innovative in American politics, and
that is to present... an independent presiden
tial candidate who is ... the product of a very,
very broad participatory and deliberative
process," said Larry Diamond, Hoover fellow
and director of Stanford's Center on Democra
cy, Development and the Rule of Law
(CDDRL) at the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies. "I think it has the poten
tial to do that."

While some view Americans Elect as a de
tractor from partisan candidates or as a lost
cause, Americans Elect provides a reportedly
secure voting method that allows delegates to
vote in partisan primaries as well as in the inde
pendent nominations. The group has achieved
ballot access in 15 states, including California,
Florida and Michigan, with 2,391,957 signatures
toward a directly nominated ticket.
