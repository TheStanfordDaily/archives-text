## TOP 5 REASONS YOU CAN'T GET ANY WORK DONE 
### 
Happy week two! By now, you might be wondering why you signed
up for 20 units when it feels so cold while biking that you can't
even motivate yourself to go to the library. That class-drop dead
line you labeled on your calendar is moving closer and closer. . .
but we can tell you why you're really not getting anything accom
plished.
The three-day weekend
Three-day weekends are the most deceptive periods of relaxation
known to college students. If you're anything like us at Intermission,
you either told yourself you were going to work a week ahead during
that extra day off only to do no work, or you went on ski trip, in which
case you didn't even bother to bring anything remotely academic
along with you.
The weather
Thirty-five degree temperatures and 9 a.m. classes don't work well
together. Throw in a little rain and all of a sudden, you can count the
number of times you actually show up to that lecture on one hand. It's
a win-win situation until the final.
Any reminders of winter break
This is a public service announcement: please delete all holiday sta
tions from your Pandora channel ASAP. Nothing says "Ebenezer
Scrooge" more than trying to do The Problem Set From Hell while lis
tening to Michael Buble croon to you, "From now on, our troubles will
be miles away."
Your partying roommate
Let's face it, this may be the one time during the entire quarter that all
of your friends insist on partying together. Either that or you got so
frustrated with your frat-hard-frat-often roommate stumbling in at 3
a.m. that you decided give up on any work. YOLO.
SOPA blackout
This past Wednesday became one of the darkest days in frantic-last
minute-essay history. How is anyone supposed to do research without
Wikipedia?
