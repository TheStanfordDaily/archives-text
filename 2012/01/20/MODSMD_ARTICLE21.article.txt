-W- k -r-hen "West Side Story" opens, we are
\ f \ / introduced to two New York street
T T gangs: the Sharks and the Jets. And
they're dancing with fisticuffs. It takes a few minutes
to get used to the fact that the stage-fights will be
dance-fights, but once you do, you know you're in
for a ride. The cast of Broadway San Jose's produc
tion at the Center for Performing Arts can definitely
dance. This is a show with a story told largely
through song and dance; it's physical and visceral
and, for the most part, it's done pretty darn well.
"West Side Story" is the epitome of what a
good musical should be. It's full of memorable
songs, impressive dance numbers and a poignant
story to tie it all together. Leonard Bernstein com
posed the complex and enduring music with lyrics
by Steven Sondheim, choreography reproduced
from Jerome Robbins's original work for the play
and a story based on Shakespeare's "Romeo and
Juliet."
It's the Upper West Side in the 19505, and our
Romeo is Tony, an American and the former leader
of the Jets. His Juliet is Maria, a Puerto Rican immi
grant whose family belongs to the opposing street
gang, the Sharks. The gangs hate each other based
on principle and unshakeable racism. But when
Tony (Ross Lekites) and Maria (Evy Ortiz) meet at
the local dance, it's inauspicious, color-blind love at
first sight.
The story is told largely through song and
dance. Bernstein's music is a great challenge to sing:

it requires a huge vocal range and the ability to mas
ter difficult syncopated rhythms and melodies with
challenging intervals. Ross Lekites, as Tony, owns his
musical part. He has a powerhouse voice with large
and beautiful range that never becomes operatic.
Every note is clear, with perfect pitch, allowing the
music to shine to its fullest. Ortiz's voice is meeker,
by comparison, but full enough to get the message
across. The rest of the cast does a fine job tackling
this complex but rewarding material. Unlike many
modern musicals, you will leave "West Side Story"
humming the songs.
This production is wonderfully choreographed
and staged, making excellent use of space and of
James Youmans' wonderful set design, which places
you right in the streets of New York. The love scenes
between Tony and Maria always take place on an
island set-piece her balcony, her bed or an empty
stage without a background because, as they

lament in the song "Somewhere," their relationship
doesn't belong in the world they live in. When the
Jets do the famous number "Cool" right before
meeting with the Sharks for a rumble, they start off
in Doc's drug store. Then the store set-pieces disap
pear, allowing the Jets to take over the stage, which
is now that piece of territory in the city that they are
so intent on defending. We also witness this territo
ry-marking through dance in "Dance at the Gym."
The biggest flaw in the production is that it far
