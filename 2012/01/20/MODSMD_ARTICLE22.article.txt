## 'One Acts': a bright (and sparkly) spot of winter quarter 
### â€“ sasha ARIJANTO contact sasha: sasha16@stanford. edu 
CCT he Original Winter One Acts," Ram's
Head's winter production, hits the spot. In
Stanford's arguably bleakest quarter, the

three short plays packaged into
one show offer a drop of cul
tural relief that soothes the
belabored mind. The board of
Ram's Head, Stanford's oldest
theatrical company, selects a
student producer who then
works with the board to
choose three student directors,
each of whom directs his or
her own production. The
result is a triptych of organic
one acts, Stanford-grown from
the writer all the way to the
director and players.
"Sparkle Time," the first
installment of the evening,
flows from the pen of
Samantha Toh 'll and may
just answer that ever-present

suspicion that yoga seems a little too sexual for coinci
dence. The set to this light-hearted comedy provides
insight into the plays' plot: an orange yoga mat placed
enticingly before a mirror draped in sparldy cloth, a

studied arrangement of glassware and alcohol waiting
to be drunk, a tempting red and black lacey bra tossed
wantonly aside suggesting the sensuality to come.

What begins as a tantric liaison
quickly turns to a farcical
conundrum as a frenzied
woman balances her cuckolded
husband, a mid-divorce sister
and a forbidden lover. But what
appears to be a simple situa
tional comedy grows in absurd
ity and humor when a straight
laced cabaret surprises even the
keenest of observers.
Pink Floyd's "Comfortably
Numb" ushers us into the next
one act, "The Days." This
poetic piece reads like an ode to
disastrous love with a stifled
desperation like a choked
scream. From the first scene, the
palpable tension waxes and sur
renders only in the play's unique

narrative manner. A love story in reverse, "The Days"
plays with dramatic flares through the set and sound to

heighten the tension
of the love without

feeling kitschy; the filmic flavor
develops the drama in the period
of a one act but with the intensity
of a feature. Lawrence Neil 'l4
and Jessica Waldman 'l5 deliver
painfully honest performances
that swallow hard and drop down
to the most vulnerable part of the
audience's belly. The pure brutali
ty winds itself back to the stage of
innocent bliss, coloring "The
Days" with a predictable but
deeply satisfying sense of soured
love. Ashley Chang's script feels
like a raw "The Glass Menagerie"
with the local color of modern
day.
"Playing Co-Op," written
by Patrick Kelly 'l2, directed by
Harry Spitzer 'l2, caps off the
show with a Stanford-centric
comedy of video games and
desire. The story portrays two
best-friend gamers of opposite
sex who vie for the companion
ship of a recent transfer and fel
low gamer of bisexual preference.
Between the geeky Roy (James
Seifert 'l5) and the abrasively glib
Lisa (Amanda Hechinger 'l2),
"Playing Co-Op" finds enough

material to ride giggles into full
fledged guffaws. Cultural allu
sions, awkward situations and
well-crafted wit waff a sense of
comical absurdity over the very
real phenomenon of Stanford
courtship, nodding to the whole
some nature of such a contrived
practice. Seifert, who starred as
an ill-fated Leland Junior in
Ram's Head's fall production,
impresses again with tightly
wound wordplay and tactical
vibrancy. The awkward innocence
of Seifert's Roy plays against
Hechinger's artfully brash Lisa to
create a hilarious charade that
will have the audience ready for a
sequel.
"The Original Winter One Acts"
will be playing this weekend, Jan.
19-21, at 8 p.m. in Pigott Theater.
Tickets are $5 for students and $lO
for general admission and are

wound wordplay and tactical
vibrancy. The awkward innocence
of Seifert's Roy plays against
Hechinger's artfully brash Lisa to
create a hilarious charade that
will have the audience ready for a
sequel.

will be playing this weekend, Jan.
19-21, at 8 p.m. in Pigott Theater.
Tickets are $5 for students and $lO
for general admission and are
available at tickets.stanford.edu, the
Stanford Ticket Office, White Plaza
and at the door.
