CCT he Original Winter One Acts," Ram's
Head's winter production, hits the spot. In
Stanford's arguably bleakest quarter, the

three short plays packaged into
one show offer a drop of cul
tural relief that soothes the
belabored mind. The board of
Ram's Head, Stanford's oldest
theatrical company, selects a
student producer who then
works with the board to
choose three student directors,
each of whom directs his or
her own production. The
result is a triptych of organic
one acts, Stanford-grown from
the writer all the way to the
director and players.
"Sparkle Time," the first
installment of the evening,
flows from the pen of
Samantha Toh 'll and may
just answer that ever-present

suspicion that yoga seems a little too sexual for coinci
dence. The set to this light-hearted comedy provides
insight into the plays' plot: an orange yoga mat placed
enticingly before a mirror draped in sparldy cloth, a

studied arrangement of glassware and alcohol waiting
to be drunk, a tempting red and black lacey bra tossed
wantonly aside suggesting the sensuality to come.

What begins as a tantric liaison
quickly turns to a farcical
conundrum as a frenzied
woman balances her cuckolded
husband, a mid-divorce sister
and a forbidden lover. But what
appears to be a simple situa
tional comedy grows in absurd
ity and humor when a straight
laced cabaret surprises even the
keenest of observers.
Pink Floyd's "Comfortably
Numb" ushers us into the next
one act, "The Days." This
poetic piece reads like an ode to
disastrous love with a stifled
desperation like a choked
scream. From the first scene, the
palpable tension waxes and sur
renders only in the play's unique

narrative manner. A love story in reverse, "The Days"
plays with dramatic flares through the set and sound to

heighten the tension
of the love without
