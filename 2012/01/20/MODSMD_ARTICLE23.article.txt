Former mixed martial arts
champion Gina Carano
stars in Steven Soderbergh's
"Haywire" as an ex-marine
turned contract killer whose life is
on the line when her boss, also her
former lover, turns on her. While
the script often fails to deliver, in a
world where ever-shrinking star
lets no longer look capable of
throwing a convincing punch, it is
both refreshing and admirable to
see an actress like Carano doing
all her own stunts and fighting her
way through such an A-list cast.
We first meet Mallory
(Carano), who bears an uncanny

resemblance to a beefed up ver
sion of Minka Kelly, as she's on
the run from both the authorities
and her two-timing boss, Kenneth
(Ewan McGregor). After leaving
former colleague Aaron
(Channing Tatum) beaten and
bruised on a diner floor, Mallory
makes a quick getaway in a
bystander's car, and over the
course of the drive relates the
events leading up to the present.
One week earlier, Mallory was
in Barcelona, allegedly to rescue a
hostage. With the mission narrow
ly completed, she returns home
only to be immediately dispatched

again by
Kenneth.
He makes
the job
sound too

easy posing as the wife of free
lance hit man Paul (Michael
Fassbender), yet her faux husband
has ulterior motives. Mallory
manages to escape alive, but this
sudden turn of events calls all of
her professional relationships into
question, causing her to embark
on a journey hell-bent on retribu
tion.
