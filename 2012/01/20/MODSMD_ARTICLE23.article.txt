Former mixed martial arts
champion Gina Carano
stars in Steven Soderbergh's
"Haywire" as an ex-marine
turned contract killer whose life is
on the line when her boss, also her
former lover, turns on her. While
the script often fails to deliver, in a
world where ever-shrinking star
lets no longer look capable of
throwing a convincing punch, it is
both refreshing and admirable to
see an actress like Carano doing
all her own stunts and fighting her
way through such an A-list cast.
We first meet Mallory
(Carano), who bears an uncanny

resemblance to a beefed up ver
sion of Minka Kelly, as she's on
the run from both the authorities
and her two-timing boss, Kenneth
(Ewan McGregor). After leaving
former colleague Aaron
(Channing Tatum) beaten and
bruised on a diner floor, Mallory
makes a quick getaway in a
bystander's car, and over the
course of the drive relates the
events leading up to the present.
One week earlier, Mallory was
in Barcelona, allegedly to rescue a
hostage. With the mission narrow
ly completed, she returns home
only to be immediately dispatched

again by
Kenneth.
He makes
the job
sound too

easy posing as the wife of free
lance hit man Paul (Michael
Fassbender), yet her faux husband
has ulterior motives. Mallory
manages to escape alive, but this
sudden turn of events calls all of
her professional relationships into
question, causing her to embark
on a journey hell-bent on retribu
tion.

The film throws you into
the fray with little explanation,
but any confusion regarding the
story falls to the wayside when
Mallory springs into action.
Carano is more than convincing
as an action star because there
are no illusions; she actually did
what her character does. Unlike
the Lara Crofts and Cataleya
Restrepos of franchises past,
Mallory needs no weapons. She
can legitimately beat the crap
out of anyone through sheer
force and skill, and it is quite a
sight to behold.
Unfortunately, Soderbergh
lets the inertia drag on too long
between action sequences, which
is when the fa9ade slips and
Carano's non-acting background
becomes obvious. Although to
be fair, she is not given much
substance to work with. The
writing is weak and poorly
scripted around Carano's physi
cal capabilities, which is a shame
because the premise a woman
who can kick ass and doesn't
need to be subordinate to the
male protagonist has a ton of

potential.
While a lack of character
depth is practically a convention
of the genre, in this case, it is as
though there is not enough
action to fill in the story's gaps.
Soderbergh seems to have tried
to go for realism, which is
admirable as far as action flicks
go, but in between the fight
scenes, things simply fall apart
and the audience's interest
wanes. Without the dreaminess
of "Drive" nor the kitschiness of
"Kill Bill," "Haywire" is merely
caught in the middle ground of
being different but not distin
guishing.
