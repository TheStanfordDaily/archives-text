## Shootin' the 'Shit' with Ralph Nguyen 
### – louis LAGALANTE contact louis: lagalant@stanford. edu 
There's one concept that
nearly defies definition, one
class of stereotypical dis
course that can only be denoted by
one word. It's drivel, yet well
informed; ignorant, yet well-inten
tioned; idiotic, but intelligent peo
ple engage in it just as often as the
less intelligent. I'm talking, of
course, about "shit." Starting with
"Shit My Dad Says" the title of
Justin Halpern's hilarious book
the Internet has been obsessed with
the concept of documenting the
mostly real ramblings of entire
classes of people. Recently this
trend crept its way onto You Tube,
as Internet trends are wont to do.
True to the entrepreneurial spirit of
Stanford University, Ralph
Nguyen 'l2 took the then-nascent
idea and ran with it. He describes
the impetus as a combination of
interest in comedy and an interest
in recognition.
"I do a lot of comedy,"
Nguyen said, "especially stand-up,
and I thought I could do a better
job at creating these videos [by]
picking more interesting topics and
doing a little shameless self-promo
tion."
These desires converged in his
first video, "Shit Fat People Say"
described on its You Tube page as
"[a] terrible parody of' Shit Girls
c
When looking back on it,
Nguyen's first reaction was to call it
"very shameful" before continuing,
"I think the comment that summa
rized that up, someone said, 'This
should be renamed 'Shit Ugly
People Say.' It's definitely oddball."
Despite less-than-favorable
responses, the video accrued

enough views for Nguyen
whose You Tube channel is
JustCallMeMrßight to continue
his quest for Internet stardom.
When he returned to Stanford for
winter quarter, he noticed some
thing else oddball: Freshmen every
where, from vastly different back
grounds, seemed to fall into the
same patterns of ridiculous behav
ior. Out of this observation, "Shit
College Freshmen Say" was born.
"They all start off as direct
quotes," he says, referring to the
sound bites that make up the clip,
"but they all get more and more
absurd." This model hit the mark
and in nine days rocketed to more
than 381,000 hits. Emboldened, he
followed with "Shit White People
Say to Asians," which in four days
reached nearly the same number.
And he isn't planning on stopping.
"Yes, definitely," he began.
"The one [that our] campus knows
me for is 'Shit College Freshmen
Say,' but I've also done really well
with 'Shit White People Say to
Asians.' 1,000,000 views is only the
beginning."
