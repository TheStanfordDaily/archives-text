# THE
						GOLDEN GLOBES
## Red carpet fashion BEST DRESSED... and WORST 
### â€“ lauren WILSON contact lauren: lhwilson@stanford. edu 
Everyone knows the Golden
Globes are really just one big
boozefest (see Meryl Streep's
acceptance speech). Any credibility
the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association had was thrown out the
window last year after they nomi
nated "The Tourist" in the best
comedic film and acting categories.
It's just an excuse for Hollywood's
rich and famous to turn out, rub
shoulders and have a good time.
Here's a look at what the celebs
wore to the party.
BEST
Nicole Kidman
After some recent fashion blunders,
Kidman made a roaring comeback
with this flawlessly fitted Versace
covered in ornate, Indianesque
studs whose warm hues accented
her copper hair.
Jessica Alba
You can always rely on Alba to bring
it when it comes to awards-show
fashion. The Globes were no excep
tion, with her romantic lavender

gown by Gucci.
Kate Beckinsale
Beckinsale's Golden Globes look
was a variation of the same form
fitting gown, gentle up-do paired
with giant dangly earrings combi
nation she's strutted at many a past
red carpet. But after one look at the
perfectly structured bodice of her
Roberto Cavalli, it's easy to see why
the English actress wouldn't want to
mess with a winning formula.
Emma Stone
Everyone's favorite bottle-redhead
continued her red-carpet streak
with another home run in a striking
plum and fuchsia Lanvin.
Julianne Moore
Mermaid dresses were everywhere
on the red carpet, but Moore man
aged to set her look apart with a
two-tiered black Chanel and by
accessorizing with eye-catching
green tassel earrings by Fred
Leighton.
Paula Patton
The bright yellow hue of the

"Mission: Impossible" star's
Monique Lhuillier was a fun twist
on the popular mermaid-cut trend
and popped on the carpet, especial
ly in a sea of beige and neutral
toned gowns.
JURY'S OUT
Rooney Mara
Like a recent Gawker article asked:
does Rooney Mara realize she's not
actually Lisbeth Salander? The rising
starlet's slew of black attire would
point toward no. She looked great
in her sexy Nina Ricci gown and
accomplished the whole edgy thing,
but with Mara's monochromatic
wardrobe, even Lisbeth couldn't
escape its overwhelming monotony.
Shailene Woodley
The "Descendants" star is another
burgeoning actress who's this close
to getting it right. She looked elegant
in her Marchesa, but the dress's pale,
off-white tone washed her out, dis
tracting us from its fragile detailing.
WORST
Jessica Biel

It's unclear why Biel decided to
traipse down the carpet in this
saggy-in-all-the-wrong-places (hello
tri-boob), sickly colored Elie Saab
that looked like one of Miss
Havisham's leftovers. As that
American treasure, Joan Rivers, said,
"She is bringing sexless back."
Julie Bowen
Any episode of this season's
"Modern Family" would make you
want to drive Bowen to the closest
In-N-Out for a double-double with
extra cheese. Her pale Reem Acra
gown (which looked better on
Olivia Wilde at the 2008 Emmys)
did nothing to flatter her figure
other than washing her out and
drawing attention to her stringy,
wan limbs.
Kelly Osbourne
Osbourne-tron 2000 greeted us
from the future in an angular, elec
tric blue Zac Posen contraption and
bizarre white, gelled hair. Next time,
leave the whole futuristic-alien thing
to Tilda Swinton.

Sarah Michelle Gellar
Go ahead and call us heartless
not even the adorable fact that
Gellar's 2- year-old daughter helped
her pick out this Marchesa could
make us forgive Buffy for this weird,
tie-dye disaster.
Lea Michele
The "Glee" star's metallic Marchesa
came off as vampy instead of high
fashion. Plus, the whole selective
embroidery thing looked better
when Halle Berry did it back at the
Oscars in 2002.
Jessica Chastain
Chastain tried to go for classy with
this high-necked Givenchy but
wound up matronly with its ill fit
and unflattering color, exacerbated
by the actress's ugly, combed-back
pomp. And it's all a damn shame
since Chastain's had such a banner
year both on the big screen and on
the red carpet.
