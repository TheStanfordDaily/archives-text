Awards season officially
kicked off last Sunday with
The Golden Globes. A
long awards show that honors both
film and television, the Globes are
notorious for the open bar avail
able to the celebrities the cause
of many a drunken speech both
this year and in years past. In case

you missed it or didn't feel like sit
ting through four hours of TV,
here's our compilation of the
night's most exciting moments.
Peter Dinklage dedicates his
award

Peter Dinklage's win for best
supporting actor in a TV series was
exciting for many reasons: it was his
first nomination for a Golden Globe,
his character on "Game of Thrones"
is a fan favorite and his win turned
out to be the only "Thrones" victory
of the night. However, his accept
ance speech stood out because he
mentioned Martin Henderson,
who he suggested that the audience
search online. Google they did
by the millions. Henderson, it
turns out, is an aspiring British
actor who was attacked due to his
dwarfism and left with serious
long-term injuries. After being
mentioned by Dinklage, his name
trended on Twitter, making

Henderson one of the most
buzzed-about people after the
Golden Globes. Good for Dinklage
for using his platform to raise
awareness of discrimination. Long
live the Imp!
Martin Scorsese upsets "The
Artist" director Michel
Hazanavicius
The Golden Globes were a
great night for "The Artist." The
silent film picked up awards for
best actor, score and film (in the
Musical or Comedy category),
coming the closest to a sweep in a
year without a real frontrunner.
But it was a shock when it didn't
win best director, which seemed
like a sure bet. That honor went to
Martin Scorsese for his work in
"Hugo," a family-friendly film
lauded as one of the best of the
season. The film is obviously a
huge departure from the famous
director's usual gritty subject mat
ter. Also Scorsese's first film in 3D,
"Hugo" showed that 3D isn't just a
fad and that when directed well, it
can actually enhance the story.
Rewarding Scorsese for that all
while adding some surprise to the
awards ceremony made it one
of the most memorable moments
of the night.
Funny acceptance speeches:
George Clooney and Meryl
Streep
Even though they won for best

actor and actress
in dramatic
movies, both
George Clooney
and Meryl Streep
brought some
hilarity to their
acceptance speech
es. Clooney
skipped the usual
laundry list of
thank-you's in
order to congratu
late fellow nomi
nee Michael
Fassbender for
"taking on full
frontal responsibil
ities this year."

Meanwhile, Meryl Streep, glorious
ly drunk but still somehow graceful
as always, complimented many of
her fellow actresses and then pro
ceeded to call Harvey Weinstein
"God."
"The punisher... Old
Testament, I guess," she added.
Speeches like this are why alcohol
should be a part of all awards
shows.
"Homeland" wins big
"Homeland," Showtime's new
TV series about troubled CIA
agent Carrie Mathison (played by
Claire Danes), was not widely
expected to win any awards going
into the Golden Globes. It hadn't
generated the buzz that popular
HBO series "Game of Thrones"
had, nor did it have the audience of

FX drama "American Horror
Story." That didn't stop the series
from claiming both best drama
series and best actress. And
deservedly so "Homeland" is a
crisp, well-written look at the inner
machinations of the CIA. Carrie,
played to paranoid perfection by
Claire Danes, is constantly teeter
ing on the brink of a meltdown
while chasing down threats to
American security. The show
blends action and drama skillfully,
and with a few Golden Globes
under its belt, "Homeland" can
look forward to a bigger audience
going into its second season.

generated the buzz that popular
HBO series "Game of Thrones"
had, nor did it have the audience of

FX drama "American Horror
Story." That didn't stop the series
from claiming both best drama
series and best actress. And
deservedly so "Homeland" is a
crisp, well-written look at the inner
machinations of the CIA. Carrie,
played to paranoid perfection by
Claire Danes, is constantly teeter
ing on the brink of a meltdown
while chasing down threats to
American security. The show
blends action and drama skillfully,
and with a few Golden Globes
under its belt, "Homeland" can
look forward to a bigger audience
going into its second season.
