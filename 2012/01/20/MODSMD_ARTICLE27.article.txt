It was refreshing, though ultimately prob
lematic, that Phyllida Law's "The Iron
Lady" refused to follow the straight
biopic trajectory to tell the story of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher. Although rem
nants of her career are told in flashbacks,
these have a different flavor than those we
saw in Eastwood's "J. Edgar": they don't all
piece together in a straightforward story from
start to finish. Instead, they are reminiscences
of an icy woman gone mad. And therein lies
the problem with the film: Law and screen
writer Abi Morgan are so busy editorializing
about Thatcher's career and life that they
leave no room for the audience to make up
our own minds, to consider the controversy
of Thatcher's career without being told what
to think. Worse, the editorializing often
comes in platitudinous remarks, like when
Thatcher's colleague tells her "if you want to
change this country, you need to lead this
country."
In the present, where we first meet
Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep in her
Golden Globe-winning performance), she is
mad and alone, hallucinating about her dead
husband and nostalgic for her glory years as
prime minister. Her extreme ambition in her
political career led her to alienate everyone in
her life, from her children that she never had

time for to her colleagues whom she fre
quently berated without restraint. Of course,
Streep nails her tics and affectations and gives
us a glimpse at the three-dimensional charac
ter that the film dances around but never
fully explores.
Whenever Thatcher comes up with a

wild political policy, it is her throng of male
subordinates who tell her how crazy it is:
whether it's taxing everyone the same
amount regardless of income or waging war

to recover the
Falkland
Islands. Was j
there any '
logical rea-

son behind any

of these policies? The film doesn't provide
enough context for us to decide: the only
information we are given points to her sense
less decisions.

There's a strange brand of feminism
here. While the film has us admire her drive
and success, it is constantly criticizing her for
her lack of warmth and motherly affection:
remember, today's feminists, it seems to me,
need to be superwomen that can do and have
it all. Her ambition also causes her to treat all
other women with disdain, frequently stating
that she prefers the company of men, includ
ing that she prefers her son's company to her
daughter's. There's something altogether
scary about a social-climbing woman from a
lower-middle class family embracing conser
vative politics that simply label the poor as
lazy. We aren't really supposed to like her.
The most interesting part of the film lies

in its heart: in the relationship between
Thatcher and her husband (Jim Broadbent)
Broadbent plays yet another clever, slightly
goofy but kind husband of a strong and

headstrong woman, not unlike the men he
played in "Iris "or "Bridget lones's Diary." Her
marriage to him was a helpful political move
he is a well-bred, respectable businessman;
she is a grocer's daughter with an Oxford
education but they really did love each
other. When he proposes, she tells him that
she needs a career outside of domestic life; he
explains that's exactly why he wants to marry
her. Whether in the flashbacks or in her hal
lucinations, there's a lovely tenderness
between the couple, which shows a very dif
ferent, almost inconsistent, side of the

woman and just how much she depended on
this loving man's support.
It's no secret that Margaret Thatcher was
hated by many, at least sometimes for good
reason. Law really misses an opportunity to
delve deep into what makes Thatcher tick, set
tling instead to present her as a washed-up
politician, an old lady who is crazy now and
had crazy ideas in her heyday. The few
glimpses into her domestic life are well-played
and involving; it's unfortunate that the rest of
the film is largely a study in caricature and a
small, albeit highly-biased, history lesson.

hated by many, at least sometimes for good
reason. Law really misses an opportunity to
delve deep into what makes Thatcher tick, set
tling instead to present her as a washed-up
politician, an old lady who is crazy now and
had crazy ideas in her heyday. The few
glimpses into her domestic life are well-played
and involving; it's unfortunate that the rest of
the film is largely a study in caricature and a
small, albeit highly-biased, history lesson.
