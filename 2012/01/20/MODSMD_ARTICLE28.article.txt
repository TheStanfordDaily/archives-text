The controversial movie
"We Need to Talk
About Kevin" has
been kicking around the cir
cuit since the Cannes Film
Festival in May but is only just
getting its American release.
This is not because it is a bad
film on the contrary, it's
bold and compelling but
because it is an extremely
challenging film that enters a
very dark place. Based on the
novel of the same name by
female author Lionel Shriver,
the film looks at the mother of
one of the worst children in
cinema, Kevin. The mother,
Eva, played by the always
engaging and expressive Tilda

Swinton, spends the time soul
searching and evaluating her
role in raising her son. Was
she too strict? Did she not love
him enough? Did her husband
love him too much?
As these questions swirl
through her head, the audi
ence sees how her relationship
with Kevin forms over his
childhood. To put it delicately,
it is not a spoiler to say that
Kevin ends up committing a
horrific crime for which he is
ultimately put in prison. The

hyper, non-chronological nar
rative of the film shows this
early on, but obscures his
abhorrent actions until the
end. This non-linear timeline
of the movie smartly places
the most exciting and exhila
rating events at its end and
also does very well in estab
lishing a nightmare-tinged
chaos, but it certainly does not
help the audience through the
tricky narrative. It takes about
30 minutes to discern exactly
where in the narrative the
action takes place.
Perhaps the main reason
to see "Kevin" is for Tilda
