The controversial movie
"We Need to Talk
About Kevin" has
been kicking around the cir
cuit since the Cannes Film
Festival in May but is only just
getting its American release.
This is not because it is a bad
film on the contrary, it's
bold and compelling but
because it is an extremely
challenging film that enters a
very dark place. Based on the
novel of the same name by
female author Lionel Shriver,
the film looks at the mother of
one of the worst children in
cinema, Kevin. The mother,
Eva, played by the always
engaging and expressive Tilda

Swinton, spends the time soul
searching and evaluating her
role in raising her son. Was
she too strict? Did she not love
him enough? Did her husband
love him too much?
As these questions swirl
through her head, the audi
ence sees how her relationship
with Kevin forms over his
childhood. To put it delicately,
it is not a spoiler to say that
Kevin ends up committing a
horrific crime for which he is
ultimately put in prison. The

hyper, non-chronological nar
rative of the film shows this
early on, but obscures his
abhorrent actions until the
end. This non-linear timeline
of the movie smartly places
the most exciting and exhila
rating events at its end and
also does very well in estab
lishing a nightmare-tinged
chaos, but it certainly does not
help the audience through the
tricky narrative. It takes about
30 minutes to discern exactly
where in the narrative the
action takes place.
Perhaps the main reason
to see "Kevin" is for Tilda

Swinton's breathtaking perform
ance. As an actress who never dis
appoints, Swinton fully realizes
the inner turmoil of this guilt
ridden mother. Every emotion is
seen on her face as she navigates
the frustration, anguish, brief joys
and damaging lows of mother
hood. Her tremendous ability to
show the subtle line between
exasperation and fear elevates this
film from ordinary to extraordi
nary. She has been racking up
nominations from the Screen
Actors Guild to the Golden
Globes and is primed to receive a
deserved Best Actress Academy
Award nomination come next

week. The young Ezra Miller
delivers a chilling performance, as
does John C. Reilly another
welcome addition to the film.
British director Lynne
Ramsay creates a truly bizarre
and interesting film that is entire
ly her vision. She uses a vast
amount of vivid imagery and
incongruous set-pieces to show
the detached and tortured state of
the protagonists. While all very
effective, it can also be startling,
often difficult to follow or digest.
"Kevin" not only wears its art
house affectations on its sleeve,
but it throws them at the viewer
boldly and with total abandon.

However, getting lost in this film
is okay, even encouraged. Ramsay
is working harder to create a tone
than a narrative, and she succeeds
in accomplishing her goals.
Ultimately, the performances
make this horrific and introspec
tive story compelling to watch.
"Kevin" is a must-see for fans of
Swinton's work and everyone
should be a fan of her work.
