## 2012 schedule disappoints PAC-12 VOTE SETS BIG GAME IN OCT. 
### BILLY GALLAGHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Big Game? Oct. 20.T0p-5 ranked USC
visiting the Farm? Before students are on
campus. Once students are back? Arizona,
Washington State and Oregon State.
That's it.

The 2012 football schedule is an unusu
al one, due to Pac-12 scheduling complica
tions and a vote that did not go Stanford's
way.

Every year, Stanford football plays the
entire Pac-12 North (Cal, Oregon, Oregon
State, Washington and Washington State)
as well as the California schools in the Pac

12 South (USC and UCLA).The Cardinal
also plays two additional Pac-12 South
teams, on a two-year round robin cycle
(Arizona and Colorado last year and this
year). Stanford has multi-year obligations
with San Jose State, Notre Dame and
Duke, which put all three on the schedule
this year.

There are several factors that compli
cate the Pac-12's schedule. Some years, the
league has 14 weeks to complete the
schedule determined by the calendar
other years allow 15 weeks. The 2011
and 2012 seasons are both "14 week" years.
With a 12-team league and a league cham
pionship game, these 14 weeks do not

leave much flexibility in the schedule. The
Pac-12's new lucrative television deals, as
well as playing occasional Thursday and
Friday night games, further complicate the
scheduling process. Many of these factors
arose from the addition of Colorado and
Utah to the league last year, but did not af
fect Stanford much in the 2011 season.
Stanford's schedule
Stanford will open its 2012 campaign
with three straight home games: Sept. 1
against San Jose State, Sept. 8 against
Duke and Sept. 15 against USC.The USC
Trojans, with star quarterback Matt
Barkley returning for his senior season,
have been predicted to finish as high as No.
2 in the nation for the 2012 season.

Classes for the 2012 to 2013 school year
begin on Sept. 24 for undergraduates.
"As for Stanford starting with USC in
week three, that's not unusual," wrote Pac
-12 Vice President of Public Affairs Kirk
Reynolds in an email to The Daily. "Stan
ford opened the Pac-12 season this past
season in week three at Arizona and
opened the 2010 schedule in week two at
UCLA."

Stanford and USC are the only Pac-12
teams to start conference play in week
three. Washington will not start Pac-12
play until Sept. 27, with all other Pac-12
teams beginning on Sept. 22.
The Cardinal has a bye week Sept. 22,
followed by a Thursday night game on
Sept. 27 at Washington to face the Huskies
and quarterback Keith Price, whose 477
yard, seven TD performance in the Alamo
bowl raised some early Heisman specula
tion.

The 2012 schedule includes four Thurs
day night games, described as "specialty
dates for ESPN and FOX" in a Pac-12
press release. Every school that plays a
Thursday night game is required to have a
bye week the week before.
Stanford will then play its first home
game with the student body on campus on
Oct. 6 against the Arizona Wildcats and
new head coach Rich Rodriguez's offense
before heading to Notre Dame for the
annual battle with the Fighting Irish on
Oct. 13.

The Cardinal will then travel across the
Bay to Cal on Oct. 20 for the Big Game be
fore hosting Washington on Oct. 27, travel
ing to Colorado on Nov. 3, playing Oregon
State on Nov. 10 and finishing its season on
the road against three-time defending con
ference champion Oregon and UCLA, on
Nov. 17 and Nov. 24, respectively.

The Big Game
First played in 1892, the Big Game is
older than the Pacific Coast Conference,
the earliest predecessor of the Pac-12,

for fans as Big Game will take place on Oct. 20, disrupting several campus traditions.
