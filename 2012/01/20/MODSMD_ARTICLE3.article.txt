## 2012 schedule disappoints PAC-12 VOTE SETS BIG GAME IN OCT. 
### BILLY GALLAGHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Big Game? Oct. 20.T0p-5 ranked USC
visiting the Farm? Before students are on
campus. Once students are back? Arizona,
Washington State and Oregon State.
That's it.

The 2012 football schedule is an unusu
al one, due to Pac-12 scheduling complica
tions and a vote that did not go Stanford's
way.

Every year, Stanford football plays the
entire Pac-12 North (Cal, Oregon, Oregon
State, Washington and Washington State)
as well as the California schools in the Pac

12 South (USC and UCLA).The Cardinal
also plays two additional Pac-12 South
teams, on a two-year round robin cycle
(Arizona and Colorado last year and this
year). Stanford has multi-year obligations
with San Jose State, Notre Dame and
Duke, which put all three on the schedule
this year.

There are several factors that compli
cate the Pac-12's schedule. Some years, the
league has 14 weeks to complete the
schedule determined by the calendar
other years allow 15 weeks. The 2011
and 2012 seasons are both "14 week" years.
With a 12-team league and a league cham
pionship game, these 14 weeks do not

leave much flexibility in the schedule. The
Pac-12's new lucrative television deals, as
well as playing occasional Thursday and
Friday night games, further complicate the
scheduling process. Many of these factors
arose from the addition of Colorado and
Utah to the league last year, but did not af
fect Stanford much in the 2011 season.
Stanford's schedule
Stanford will open its 2012 campaign
with three straight home games: Sept. 1
against San Jose State, Sept. 8 against
Duke and Sept. 15 against USC.The USC
Trojans, with star quarterback Matt
Barkley returning for his senior season,
have been predicted to finish as high as No.
2 in the nation for the 2012 season.

Classes for the 2012 to 2013 school year
begin on Sept. 24 for undergraduates.
"As for Stanford starting with USC in
week three, that's not unusual," wrote Pac
-12 Vice President of Public Affairs Kirk
Reynolds in an email to The Daily. "Stan
ford opened the Pac-12 season this past
season in week three at Arizona and
opened the 2010 schedule in week two at
UCLA."

Stanford and USC are the only Pac-12
teams to start conference play in week
three. Washington will not start Pac-12
play until Sept. 27, with all other Pac-12
teams beginning on Sept. 22.
The Cardinal has a bye week Sept. 22,
followed by a Thursday night game on
Sept. 27 at Washington to face the Huskies
and quarterback Keith Price, whose 477
yard, seven TD performance in the Alamo
bowl raised some early Heisman specula
tion.

The 2012 schedule includes four Thurs
day night games, described as "specialty
dates for ESPN and FOX" in a Pac-12
press release. Every school that plays a
Thursday night game is required to have a
bye week the week before.
Stanford will then play its first home
game with the student body on campus on
Oct. 6 against the Arizona Wildcats and
new head coach Rich Rodriguez's offense
before heading to Notre Dame for the
annual battle with the Fighting Irish on
Oct. 13.

The Cardinal will then travel across the
Bay to Cal on Oct. 20 for the Big Game be
fore hosting Washington on Oct. 27, travel
ing to Colorado on Nov. 3, playing Oregon
State on Nov. 10 and finishing its season on
the road against three-time defending con
ference champion Oregon and UCLA, on
Nov. 17 and Nov. 24, respectively.

The Big Game
First played in 1892, the Big Game is
older than the Pacific Coast Conference,
the earliest predecessor of the Pac-12,

which was formed in 1915, and has
been played 114 times with the
earliest previous date coming on
Nov. 8.
Both Stanford and Cal officials
expressed their disappointment
with the 2012 Big Game date.
"The October 20 date for Big
Game is 2012 is certainly not our
first choice but the conference is
governed by the will of the major
ity and we have a duty to respect
the outcome of the vote," said
Stanford's Director of Athletics
Bob Bowlsby in a press release.
"We will work with California
and the Pac-12 Office to advocate
for the Big Game and all rivalry
games to be scheduled toward the
end of the season in future years."

This will be only the fifth time
that the Big Game has not been
played in November. The game
has previously been moved to the
first week of December, as was
the case in 2006 and 2007, to avoid
conflicts. Flowever, now that the
conference has expanded to 12
teams and includes a champi
onship game scheduled for
Nov. 30 that is no longer possi
ble.

"The Pac-12 Conference val
ues the importance of our historic
rivalry games and the importance
of scheduling them in traditional
end-of-season dates," said Pac-12
commissioner Larry Scott in a
statement. "However, with the
addition of our Championship
Football Game the last week of
the season, and new television
agreements commencing in 2012,
there will be additional priorities
that need to be balanced when
making the schedule that will
mean occasional date adjust
ments to rivalry games.

"In this case, we made every
effort to create a schedule that
would allow the Big Game to be
played at the end of the season.
Cal and Stanford were clear that
they did not want to play the Big
Game Thanksgiving week so we
presented additional options to
our member institutions for dis
cussion and a vote. Ultimately the
majority vote determined the
schedule."

The majority vote
According to the Pac-12, the
conference considers initial input
from every member school on
dates they prefer, specific issues,
and other requests before draft

ing initial schedules. Several pos
sible schedules are then put out
for discussion before they are nar
rowed to three finalists.The mem
ber schools then vote on the three
final proposals.
The three final proposals slot
ted the Big Game for Oct. 20, Nov.
17 and the Friday after Thanks
giving. Both Cal and Stanford fa
vored the Nov. 17 date and lob
bied for its acceptance.
"While this version kept the
Big Game on a more traditional
Saturday late in the season, other
dates for conference games were
significantly impacted," said a Cal
press release. "In line with confer
ence policy, the schedules were
put to a vote among the 12 athlet
ic directors, and the majority vote
favored schedule A which
slots the Stanford-Cal game on
Oct. 20."

The Pac-12 would not elabo
rate further on the voting process.
Officials from the athletic depart
ments at Arizona State, UCLA,
USC, Utah and Washington de
clined to comment on the voting
process. Officials from the athlet
ic departments at Arizona, Col
orado, Oregon, Oregon State and
Washington State could not be
reached for comment by the time
of publication.
A Stanford Athletics Depart
ment source confirmed that the
other Pac-12 presidents voted in
favor of the Oct. 20 date.
Officials from Stanford and
Cal repeatedly pointed to the
many Big Game week traditions
held by both schools and their
alumni to reasons why the Friday
after Thanksgiving date would
not work.

"There are dozens, if not hun
dreds, of events on both campuses
that are tied to the Big Game,"
Bowlsby said in an interview with
the Mercury News. "With both
schools on break, Thanksgiving
week won't work."
However, the 2012 schedule
will still impact many Stanford
traditions.

Farm effects
Richard Muschell, Stanford
assistant athletic director and di
rector of ticket sales, said his of
fice has received calls from alum
ni and season ticket holders about
the Big Game date.
"People aren't happy about
the break in tradition for Big
Game," Muschell said. "And
that's to be expected. Hell, we
weren't happy. We weren't happy
about it either. But you kind of
play with the cards you're dealt."
Muschell said the student sec

tion, which was about 5,000 seats
this past season, will be smaller
for the first three home games
when students are not on campus.
Muschell noted that there will be
room for all students who wish to
sit in the Red Zone.
"If we had our druthers, I'd
have the entire [home] schedule
after the students got back,"
Muschell said. "The students add
so much electricity to it. That's
enormous."

The early home games, lack of
an obvious "road trip" date and
early Big Game could also affect
the Band, according to LSJUMB
Public Relations officer Brian
Flamm 'l3.
Flamm noted that the Band
typically uses the NSO football
game followed by a mid-October
road trip to recruit freshmen and
new members. However, there
will be no game during NSO this
year, and the away games be
tween the start of classes and
Thanksgiving Break are in Col
orado and Washington â€”too far
for an effective road trip, accord
ing to Flamm.
"The big disadvantage of the
schedule is having Big Game so
early," Flamm wrote in an email
to The Daily. "For band, Big
Game is not just a game, but there
is an entire week of events pre
ceding the game.. . Big Game
week is probably the most impor
tant week of the fall for band, and
this earlier date could affect some
of our traditional events."

The early Big Game will also
present unique challenges to the
production of Gaieties. Gaieties
usually casts during the first week
of school in the fall, which allows
for six to seven full weeks of re
hearsal and set-building before
three nights of performances
leading up to the Big Game. In
2012, Gaieties will have a little
over three weeks between the
first day of class and the tradi
tional first night of performanc
es.

"Because of the earlier date
of Big Game the staff and cast
will have much less time during
the fall quarter to produce the
show," wrote 2011 Gaieties pro
ducer Nora Martin 'l2 in an
email to The Daily. "Because of
the scale and length of the pro
duction, our timeline for hiring
the staff, writing the script, cast
ing the show, rehearsing all the
material and building the set will
have to be adjusted. While no
concrete decisions have been
made, the show is called Big
Game Gaieties and it is our prior
ity to stay true to the 100+ year
old tradition. I will be working
with next year's producer, Ram's
Head and the University adminis
tration to create an abbreviated
schedule that will still allow the
show to be performed during the
week leading up to our game
against Cal."

The Band and Gaieties are not
the only student groups affected
by the 2012 football schedule.
Students, alumni, season ticket
holders and, most importantly,
the players will all have to adjust
to a different schedule this year.
How will the team adjust? Tune
in Sept. 1.

Officials from Stanford and

many Big Game week traditions
held by both schools and their

not work.

"There are dozens, if not hun

that are tied to the Big Game,"
Bowlsby said in an interview with
the Mercury News. "With both

week won't work."
However, the 2012 schedule
will still impact many Stanford
traditions.

Richard Muschell, Stanford
assistant athletic director and di
rector of ticket sales, said his of
fice has received calls from alum
ni and season ticket holders about
the Big Game date.
"People aren't happy about
the break in tradition for Big
Game," Muschell said. "And
that's to be expected. Hell, we
weren't happy. We weren't happy
about it either. But you kind of
play with the cards you're dealt."
Muschell said the student sec

tion, which was about 5,000 seats
this past season, will be smaller
for the first three home games
when students are not on campus.
Muschell noted that there will be
room for all students who wish to
sit in the Red Zone.
"If we had our druthers, I'd
have the entire [home] schedule
after the students got back,"
Muschell said. "The students add
so much electricity to it. That's
enormous."

The early home games, lack of
an obvious "road trip" date and
early Big Game could also affect
the Band, according to LSJUMB
Public Relations officer Brian
Flamm 'l3.
Flamm noted that the Band
typically uses the NSO football
game followed by a mid-October
road trip to recruit freshmen and
new members. However, there
will be no game during NSO this
year, and the away games be
tween the start of classes and
Thanksgiving Break are in Col
orado and Washington â€”too far
for an effective road trip, accord
ing to Flamm.
"The big disadvantage of the
schedule is having Big Game so
early," Flamm wrote in an email
to The Daily. "For band, Big
Game is not just a game, but there
is an entire week of events pre
ceding the game.. . Big Game
week is probably the most impor
tant week of the fall for band, and
this earlier date could affect some
of our traditional events."

The early Big Game will also
present unique challenges to the
production of Gaieties. Gaieties
usually casts during the first week
of school in the fall, which allows
for six to seven full weeks of re
hearsal and set-building before
three nights of performances
leading up to the Big Game. In
2012, Gaieties will have a little
over three weeks between the
first day of class and the tradi
tional first night of performanc
es.

"Because of the earlier date
of Big Game the staff and cast
will have much less time during
the fall quarter to produce the
show," wrote 2011 Gaieties pro
ducer Nora Martin 'l2 in an
email to The Daily. "Because of
the scale and length of the pro
duction, our timeline for hiring
the staff, writing the script, cast
ing the show, rehearsing all the
material and building the set will
have to be adjusted. While no
concrete decisions have been
made, the show is called Big
Game Gaieties and it is our prior
ity to stay true to the 100+ year
old tradition. I will be working
with next year's producer, Ram's
Head and the University adminis
tration to create an abbreviated
schedule that will still allow the
show to be performed during the
week leading up to our game
against Cal."

The Band and Gaieties are not
the only student groups affected
by the 2012 football schedule.
Students, alumni, season ticket
holders and, most importantly,
the players will all have to adjust
to a different schedule this year.

Big Game? Oct. 20.T0p-5 ranked USC
visiting the Farm? Before students are on
campus. Once students are back? Arizona,
Washington State and Oregon State.
That's it.

The 2012 football schedule is an unusu
al one, due to Pac-12 scheduling complica
tions and a vote that did not go Stanford's
way.

Every year, Stanford football plays the
entire Pac-12 North (Cal, Oregon, Oregon
State, Washington and Washington State)
as well as the California schools in the Pac

12 South (USC and UCLA).The Cardinal
also plays two additional Pac-12 South
teams, on a two-year round robin cycle
(Arizona and Colorado last year and this
year). Stanford has multi-year obligations
with San Jose State, Notre Dame and
Duke, which put all three on the schedule
this year.

There are several factors that compli
cate the Pac-12's schedule. Some years, the
league has 14 weeks to complete the
schedule determined by the calendar
other years allow 15 weeks. The 2011
and 2012 seasons are both "14 week" years.
With a 12-team league and a league cham
pionship game, these 14 weeks do not

leave much flexibility in the schedule. The
Pac-12's new lucrative television deals, as
well as playing occasional Thursday and
Friday night games, further complicate the
scheduling process. Many of these factors
arose from the addition of Colorado and
Utah to the league last year, but did not af
fect Stanford much in the 2011 season.
Stanford's schedule
Stanford will open its 2012 campaign
with three straight home games: Sept. 1
against San Jose State, Sept. 8 against
Duke and Sept. 15 against USC.The USC
Trojans, with star quarterback Matt
Barkley returning for his senior season,
have been predicted to finish as high as No.
2 in the nation for the 2012 season.

Classes for the 2012 to 2013 school year
begin on Sept. 24 for undergraduates.
"As for Stanford starting with USC in
week three, that's not unusual," wrote Pac
-12 Vice President of Public Affairs Kirk
Reynolds in an email to The Daily. "Stan
ford opened the Pac-12 season this past
season in week three at Arizona and
opened the 2010 schedule in week two at
UCLA."

Stanford and USC are the only Pac-12
teams to start conference play in week
three. Washington will not start Pac-12
play until Sept. 27, with all other Pac-12
teams beginning on Sept. 22.
The Cardinal has a bye week Sept. 22,
followed by a Thursday night game on
Sept. 27 at Washington to face the Huskies
and quarterback Keith Price, whose 477
yard, seven TD performance in the Alamo
bowl raised some early Heisman specula
tion.

The 2012 schedule includes four Thurs
day night games, described as "specialty
dates for ESPN and FOX" in a Pac-12
press release. Every school that plays a
Thursday night game is required to have a
bye week the week before.
Stanford will then play its first home
game with the student body on campus on
Oct. 6 against the Arizona Wildcats and
new head coach Rich Rodriguez's offense
before heading to Notre Dame for the
annual battle with the Fighting Irish on
Oct. 13.

The Cardinal will then travel across the
Bay to Cal on Oct. 20 for the Big Game be
fore hosting Washington on Oct. 27, travel
ing to Colorado on Nov. 3, playing Oregon
State on Nov. 10 and finishing its season on
the road against three-time defending con
ference champion Oregon and UCLA, on
Nov. 17 and Nov. 24, respectively.

The Big Game
First played in 1892, the Big Game is
older than the Pacific Coast Conference,
the earliest predecessor of the Pac-12,


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
The 2012 Cardinal football schedule is set to provide a drastically different experience
for fans as Big Game will take place on Oct. 20, disrupting several campus traditions.
which was formed in 1915, and has
been played 114 times with the
earliest previous date coming on
Nov. 8.
Both Stanford and Cal officials
expressed their disappointment
with the 2012 Big Game date.
"The October 20 date for Big
Game is 2012 is certainly not our
first choice but the conference is
governed by the will of the major
ity and we have a duty to respect
the outcome of the vote," said
Stanford's Director of Athletics
Bob Bowlsby in a press release.
"We will work with California
and the Pac-12 Office to advocate
for the Big Game and all rivalry
games to be scheduled toward the
end of the season in future years."

This will be only the fifth time
that the Big Game has not been
played in November. The game
has previously been moved to the
first week of December, as was
the case in 2006 and 2007, to avoid
conflicts. Flowever, now that the
conference has expanded to 12
teams and includes a champi
onship game scheduled for
Nov. 30 that is no longer possi
ble.

"The Pac-12 Conference val
ues the importance of our historic
rivalry games and the importance
of scheduling them in traditional
end-of-season dates," said Pac-12
commissioner Larry Scott in a
statement. "However, with the
addition of our Championship
Football Game the last week of
the season, and new television
agreements commencing in 2012,
there will be additional priorities
that need to be balanced when
making the schedule that will
mean occasional date adjust
ments to rivalry games.

"In this case, we made every
effort to create a schedule that
would allow the Big Game to be
played at the end of the season.
Cal and Stanford were clear that
they did not want to play the Big
Game Thanksgiving week so we
presented additional options to
our member institutions for dis
cussion and a vote. Ultimately the
majority vote determined the
schedule."

The majority vote
According to the Pac-12, the
conference considers initial input
from every member school on
dates they prefer, specific issues,
and other requests before draft

ing initial schedules. Several pos
sible schedules are then put out
for discussion before they are nar
rowed to three finalists.The mem
ber schools then vote on the three
final proposals.
The three final proposals slot
ted the Big Game for Oct. 20, Nov.
17 and the Friday after Thanks
giving. Both Cal and Stanford fa
vored the Nov. 17 date and lob
bied for its acceptance.
"While this version kept the
Big Game on a more traditional
Saturday late in the season, other
dates for conference games were
significantly impacted," said a Cal
press release. "In line with confer
ence policy, the schedules were
put to a vote among the 12 athlet
ic directors, and the majority vote
favored schedule A which
slots the Stanford-Cal game on
Oct. 20."

The Pac-12 would not elabo
rate further on the voting process.
Officials from the athletic depart
ments at Arizona State, UCLA,
USC, Utah and Washington de
clined to comment on the voting
process. Officials from the athlet
ic departments at Arizona, Col
orado, Oregon, Oregon State and
Washington State could not be
reached for comment by the time
of publication.
A Stanford Athletics Depart

which was formed in 1915, and has
been played 114 times with the
earliest previous date coming on
Nov. 8.
Both Stanford and Cal officials
expressed their disappointment
with the 2012 Big Game date.
"The October 20 date for Big
Game is 2012 is certainly not our
first choice but the conference is
governed by the will of the major
ity and we have a duty to respect
the outcome of the vote," said
Stanford's Director of Athletics
Bob Bowlsby in a press release.
"We will work with California
and the Pac-12 Office to advocate
for the Big Game and all rivalry
games to be scheduled toward the
end of the season in future years."

This will be only the fifth time
that the Big Game has not been
played in November. The game
has previously been moved to the
first week of December, as was
the case in 2006 and 2007, to avoid
conflicts. Flowever, now that the
conference has expanded to 12
teams and includes a champi
onship game scheduled for
Nov. 30 that is no longer possi
ble.

"The Pac-12 Conference val
ues the importance of our historic
rivalry games and the importance
of scheduling them in traditional
end-of-season dates," said Pac-12
commissioner Larry Scott in a
statement. "However, with the
addition of our Championship
Football Game the last week of
the season, and new television
agreements commencing in 2012,
there will be additional priorities
that need to be balanced when
making the schedule that will
mean occasional date adjust
ments to rivalry games.

"In this case, we made every
effort to create a schedule that
would allow the Big Game to be
played at the end of the season.
Cal and Stanford were clear that
they did not want to play the Big
Game Thanksgiving week so we
presented additional options to
our member institutions for dis
cussion and a vote. Ultimately the
majority vote determined the
schedule."

The majority vote
According to the Pac-12, the
conference considers initial input
from every member school on
dates they prefer, specific issues,
and other requests before draft

ing initial schedules. Several pos
sible schedules are then put out
for discussion before they are nar
rowed to three finalists.The mem
ber schools then vote on the three
final proposals.
The three final proposals slot
ted the Big Game for Oct. 20, Nov.
17 and the Friday after Thanks
giving. Both Cal and Stanford fa
vored the Nov. 17 date and lob
bied for its acceptance.
"While this version kept the
Big Game on a more traditional
Saturday late in the season, other
dates for conference games were
significantly impacted," said a Cal
press release. "In line with confer
ence policy, the schedules were
put to a vote among the 12 athlet
ic directors, and the majority vote
favored schedule A which
slots the Stanford-Cal game on
Oct. 20."

The Pac-12 would not elabo
rate further on the voting process.
Officials from the athletic depart
ments at Arizona State, UCLA,
USC, Utah and Washington de
clined to comment on the voting
process. Officials from the athlet
ic departments at Arizona, Col
orado, Oregon, Oregon State and
Washington State could not be
reached for comment by the time
of publication.
A Stanford Athletics Depart
ment source confirmed that the
other Pac-12 presidents voted in
favor of the Oct. 20 date.
Officials from Stanford and
Cal repeatedly pointed to the
many Big Game week traditions
held by both schools and their
alumni to reasons why the Friday
after Thanksgiving date would
not work.

"There are dozens, if not hun
dreds, of events on both campuses
that are tied to the Big Game,"
Bowlsby said in an interview with
the Mercury News. "With both
schools on break, Thanksgiving
week won't work."
However, the 2012 schedule
will still impact many Stanford
traditions.

Farm effects
Richard Muschell, Stanford
assistant athletic director and di
rector of ticket sales, said his of
fice has received calls from alum
ni and season ticket holders about
the Big Game date.
"People aren't happy about
the break in tradition for Big
Game," Muschell said. "And
that's to be expected. Hell, we
weren't happy. We weren't happy
about it either. But you kind of
play with the cards you're dealt."
Muschell said the student sec

tion, which was about 5,000 seats
this past season, will be smaller
for the first three home games
when students are not on campus.
Muschell noted that there will be
room for all students who wish to
sit in the Red Zone.
"If we had our druthers, I'd
have the entire [home] schedule
after the students got back,"
Muschell said. "The students add
so much electricity to it. That's
enormous."

The early home games, lack of
an obvious "road trip" date and
early Big Game could also affect
the Band, according to LSJUMB
Public Relations officer Brian
Flamm 'l3.
Flamm noted that the Band
typically uses the NSO football
game followed by a mid-October
road trip to recruit freshmen and
new members. However, there
will be no game during NSO this
year, and the away games be
tween the start of classes and
Thanksgiving Break are in Col
orado and Washington â€”too far
for an effective road trip, accord
ing to Flamm.
"The big disadvantage of the
schedule is having Big Game so
early," Flamm wrote in an email
to The Daily. "For band, Big
Game is not just a game, but there
is an entire week of events pre
ceding the game.. . Big Game
week is probably the most impor
tant week of the fall for band, and
this earlier date could affect some
of our traditional events."

The early Big Game will also
present unique challenges to the
production of Gaieties. Gaieties
usually casts during the first week
of school in the fall, which allows
for six to seven full weeks of re
hearsal and set-building before
three nights of performances
leading up to the Big Game. In
2012, Gaieties will have a little
over three weeks between the
first day of class and the tradi
tional first night of performanc
es.

"Because of the earlier date
of Big Game the staff and cast
will have much less time during
the fall quarter to produce the
show," wrote 2011 Gaieties pro
ducer Nora Martin 'l2 in an
email to The Daily. "Because of
the scale and length of the pro
duction, our timeline for hiring
the staff, writing the script, cast
ing the show, rehearsing all the
material and building the set will
have to be adjusted. While no
concrete decisions have been
made, the show is called Big
Game Gaieties and it is our prior
ity to stay true to the 100+ year
old tradition. I will be working
with next year's producer, Ram's
Head and the University adminis
tration to create an abbreviated
schedule that will still allow the
show to be performed during the
week leading up to our game
against Cal."

The Band and Gaieties are not
the only student groups affected
by the 2012 football schedule.
Students, alumni, season ticket
holders and, most importantly,
the players will all have to adjust
to a different schedule this year.
How will the team adjust? Tune
in Sept. 1.

Big Game? Oct. 20.T0p-5 ranked USC
visiting the Farm? Before students are on
campus. Once students are back? Arizona,
Washington State and Oregon State.
That's it.

The 2012 football schedule is an unusu
al one, due to Pac-12 scheduling complica
tions and a vote that did not go Stanford's
way.

Every year, Stanford football plays the
entire Pac-12 North (Cal, Oregon, Oregon
State, Washington and Washington State)
as well as the California schools in the Pac

12 South (USC and UCLA).The Cardinal
also plays two additional Pac-12 South
teams, on a two-year round robin cycle
(Arizona and Colorado last year and this
year). Stanford has multi-year obligations
with San Jose State, Notre Dame and
Duke, which put all three on the schedule
this year.

There are several factors that compli
cate the Pac-12's schedule. Some years, the
league has 14 weeks to complete the
schedule determined by the calendar
other years allow 15 weeks. The 2011
and 2012 seasons are both "14 week" years.
With a 12-team league and a league cham
pionship game, these 14 weeks do not

leave much flexibility in the schedule. The
Pac-12's new lucrative television deals, as
well as playing occasional Thursday and
Friday night games, further complicate the
scheduling process. Many of these factors
arose from the addition of Colorado and
Utah to the league last year, but did not af
fect Stanford much in the 2011 season.
Stanford's schedule
Stanford will open its 2012 campaign
with three straight home games: Sept. 1
against San Jose State, Sept. 8 against
Duke and Sept. 15 against USC.The USC
Trojans, with star quarterback Matt
Barkley returning for his senior season,
have been predicted to finish as high as No.
2 in the nation for the 2012 season.

Classes for the 2012 to 2013 school year
begin on Sept. 24 for undergraduates.
"As for Stanford starting with USC in
week three, that's not unusual," wrote Pac
-12 Vice President of Public Affairs Kirk
Reynolds in an email to The Daily. "Stan
ford opened the Pac-12 season this past
season in week three at Arizona and
opened the 2010 schedule in week two at
UCLA."

Stanford and USC are the only Pac-12
teams to start conference play in week
three. Washington will not start Pac-12
play until Sept. 27, with all other Pac-12
teams beginning on Sept. 22.
The Cardinal has a bye week Sept. 22,
followed by a Thursday night game on
Sept. 27 at Washington to face the Huskies
and quarterback Keith Price, whose 477
yard, seven TD performance in the Alamo
bowl raised some early Heisman specula
tion.

The 2012 schedule includes four Thurs
day night games, described as "specialty
dates for ESPN and FOX" in a Pac-12
press release. Every school that plays a
Thursday night game is required to have a
bye week the week before.
Stanford will then play its first home
game with the student body on campus on
Oct. 6 against the Arizona Wildcats and
new head coach Rich Rodriguez's offense
before heading to Notre Dame for the
annual battle with the Fighting Irish on
Oct. 13.

The Cardinal will then travel across the
Bay to Cal on Oct. 20 for the Big Game be
fore hosting Washington on Oct. 27, travel
ing to Colorado on Nov. 3, playing Oregon
State on Nov. 10 and finishing its season on

made, the show is called Big
Game Gaieties and it is our prior
ity to stay true to the 100+ year
old tradition. I will be working
with next year's producer, Ram's
Head and the University adminis
tration to create an abbreviated
schedule that will still allow the
show to be performed during the
week leading up to our game
against Cal."

The Band and Gaieties are not
the only student groups affected
by the 2012 football schedule.
Students, alumni, season ticket
holders and, most importantly,
the players will all have to adjust
to a different schedule this year.
How will the team adjust? Tune
in Sept. 1.
