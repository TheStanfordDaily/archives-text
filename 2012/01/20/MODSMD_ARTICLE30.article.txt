## ROXY SASS How to love thy neighbors 
### 
Roxy remembers the long-ago
days of her freshman year,
when she was still young and
naive. Before she could even say
NSO, she was warned against the
dangers of dormcest. But willpower
isn't exactly Roxy's strong suit, and
boys are no exception. When fine
male specimens are presented in
front of Roxy day-in and day-out, it's
inevitable that she's going to go for a
little "in and out" of her own. After
several years of experience, Roxy's
developed a finely honed list of the
dos and don'ts of dormcest, which
she's proud to share with the world.
DO:
Keep it on the DL.
Roxy has never been one to
advocate keeping things quiet (in or
out of the bedroom), but dormcest
is a notable exception. The only
thing more awkward than that first
encounter with your dormmate
post-hookup is everyone else know
ing how awkward you feel. Plus,
Roxy always finds sneaking around
and hooking up in dark corners
exciting. Secret agent role-play, any
one?
Accept that it's not actually
going to stay on the DL.
Secrets at Stanford are much
like Roxy they spread quickly. If
you can't handle the heat, get out of
the kitchen, or the... lounge.
Use protection.
No one wants a dorm baby.
'Nuff said.
DON'T:
Hook up with your next-door
neighbor.
Roxy appreciates the conven
ience factor of a two-foot walk of

shame, but she also knows that no
one looks good on his or her way to
the bathroom at 8 a.m. And keep in
mind that the walls in Stanford
housing are pretty thin: hearing him
or her get over you by getting under
someone else is definitely not ideal.
Double-dormcest with room
mates.
Sexiling is a sad but necessary
part of the college experience.
Sexiling someone who's still waiting
for more than a half-assed drunken
hookup is just plain mean.
Hook up in common areas.
Just because everyone in the
dorm wants to know your business
doesn't mean they want to see it
firsthand. (And Roxy suggests you
avoid the ones who do.)
