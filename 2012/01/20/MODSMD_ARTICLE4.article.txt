## Bay Area thinkers ponder future of'life' 
### MARSHALL WATKINS STAFF WRITER 
A panel of Bay Area thinkers ad
dressed interpretations of life, the role of
technology in human existence and ethi
cal quandaries Thursday evening at
"Life," the second stage of an "Interdisci
plinary Tour of the Human Condition in

Three Stages." The panel of speakers,

moderated by Piero Scaruffi of Stanford
Continuing Studies, attracted an audience
of around 250 to Cubberley Auditorium.
The Continuing Studies series com
menced with an autumn examination of
"Time" and will conclude with a discus
sion of "Mind" in the spring. Scaruffi high
lighted the series' significance due to its
inclusion of varied experiences.

"We wanted to explore the human ex

perience through a range of perspectives
and disciplines that don't mix often," he
said.
The four panelists spanned professions
from cognitive psychology and anthropol
ogy to nanotechnology and multimedia
art. Each panelist was granted 10 minutes
for a presentation before the group collec-
tively addressed questions sub
mitted by the audience.
Jeremy Bailenson, associate
professor of communication,
drew on his experiences running
Stanford's recently revamped Vir
tual Human Interaction lab to
highlight the significance of virtu
al reality, and specifically avatars,
in behavioral conditioning.
Bailenson cited studies noting
the efficacy of avatars resembling
the participant in encouraging be
havior change, often in response
to the avatar carrying out entirely
new activities and thus demon
strating the consequences of cer
tain actions. Bailenson highlight
ed the experiment's potential
replication in fields such as adver
tising.

"People have always been able
to see reflections of themselves,"
Bailenson observed. "Now, you
can see yourself doing something
that you've never physically
done."

Christine Peterson, co-founder
and president of The Foresight In
stitute, a public interest group
seeking to educate the communi
ty on forthcoming technological
advances, emphasized the increas
ingly prominent role that nan
otechnology has come to play.

Peterson noted that nanotech
nology has the potential to create
new materials and make vast ad
vances without the side effects,
such as pollution, that would cur
rently ensue. She allowed, howev
er, that the near-invisible and
highly sensitive technology might
enable intrusions on privacy.

"We need to know what data is
collected," Peterson said, "how it
is used and how long it is retained.
We have those rights."
Peterson highlighted the med
ical benefits of nanotechnology,
noting, "The ability to control
atoms and molecules would mean
that there really isn't a physical ill

ness [that] we wouldn't be able to
address."

She acknowledged, however,
that remaining constraints on ap
plying nanotechnology to individ
uals have slowed the speed of ad
vances.

In contrast to Peterson, Lynn
Hershman Leeson, chair of the
San Francisco Art Institute film
department, noted that technolo
gy, while allowing the summariza
tion of information in data and
statistics, often fails to improve
human understanding. Hershman
Leeson hypothesized that creat
ing fabricated persons serves as a
means of exploring areas we don't
understand while simultaneously
testing reality.
Paul Rabinow, professor of an
thropology at the UC-Berkeley,
questioned the underlying role of
ethics in exploring human interac
tion. Rabinow criticized a preva
lent lack of concern, especially in
academia, for the question, "What
is a good life?" and the correspon
ding emphasis placed on material
success above all else.

Audience questions focused
on the effects of technology on
human identity, as provided by
language and social interaction.
The panel largely acknowledged
the inevitable nature of techno
logical advances and emphasized
the need to preserve and develop
positive aspects of the advances to
fully benefit society. The speakers
also noted, however, the increas
ing fragmentation of society due
to the increased personalization
and segregation of human inter
action.

Scaruffi expressed disappoint
ment at the low levels of student
attendance, but emphasized the
significance of the debate.
"These four were picked be
cause they're working with differ
ent aspects of life that will dramat
ically change," Scaruffi said.
"They discussed life as in the fu
ture, rather than life as in the
past."

to the avatar carrying out entirely
new activities and thus demon
strating the consequences of cer
tain actions. Bailenson highlight
ed the experiment's potential
replication in fields such as adver
tising.

"People have always been able
to see reflections of themselves,"
Bailenson observed. "Now, you
can see yourself doing something
that you've never physically
done."

Christine Peterson, co-founder
and president of The Foresight In
stitute, a public interest group
seeking to educate the communi
ty on forthcoming technological
advances, emphasized the increas
ingly prominent role that nan
otechnology has come to play.

Peterson noted that nanotech
nology has the potential to create
new materials and make vast ad
vances without the side effects,
such as pollution, that would cur
rently ensue. She allowed, howev
er, that the near-invisible and
highly sensitive technology might
enable intrusions on privacy.

"We need to know what data is
collected," Peterson said, "how it
is used and how long it is retained.
We have those rights."
Peterson highlighted the med
ical benefits of nanotechnology,
noting, "The ability to control
atoms and molecules would mean
that there really isn't a physical ill

ness [that] we wouldn't be able to
address."

She acknowledged, however,
that remaining constraints on ap
plying nanotechnology to individ
uals have slowed the speed of ad
vances.

In contrast to Peterson, Lynn
Hershman Leeson, chair of the
San Francisco Art Institute film
department, noted that technolo
gy, while allowing the summariza
tion of information in data and
statistics, often fails to improve
human understanding. Hershman
Leeson hypothesized that creat
ing fabricated persons serves as a
means of exploring areas we don't
understand while simultaneously
testing reality.
Paul Rabinow, professor of an
thropology at the UC-Berkeley,
questioned the underlying role of
ethics in exploring human interac
tion. Rabinow criticized a preva
lent lack of concern, especially in
academia, for the question, "What
is a good life?" and the correspon
ding emphasis placed on material
success above all else.

Audience questions focused
on the effects of technology on
human identity, as provided by
language and social interaction.
The panel largely acknowledged
the inevitable nature of techno
logical advances and emphasized
the need to preserve and develop
positive aspects of the advances to
fully benefit society. The speakers
also noted, however, the increas
ing fragmentation of society due
to the increased personalization
and segregation of human inter
action.

Scaruffi expressed disappoint
ment at the low levels of student
attendance, but emphasized the
significance of the debate.
"These four were picked be
cause they're working with differ
ent aspects of life that will dramat
ically change," Scaruffi said.
"They discussed life as in the fu
ture, rather than life as in the
past."
