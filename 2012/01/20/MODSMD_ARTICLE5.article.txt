## Financial recruiting event draws crowd 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
Lee Jackson 'l2 led a panel
Thursday evening with four other
Stanford students, each with ex
perience working for Wall Street
firms such as Morgan Stanley,
Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan,
to provide insight into the finan
cial industry for career hopefuls.
The event, titled "Recruiting in
the Financial Crisis," was held in a
packed room in the Nitery with
more than 50 students in atten
dance.
After a brief discussion of the

causes and effects of the financial
crisis, the panel opened up to
questions from the audience, hop
ing to inform audience members
about how to apply for various in
ternships in the financial field.
Several students questioned
whether the low hiring and bonus
rates of banking firms worry the
panelists for the future.
"You do need banking servic
es, despite what Occupy Wall
Street says," said Miles Penn 'l2, a
member of the panel who worked
at Goldman Sachs in investment
banking.
"They generally protect ana

lysts, too," Jackson said, as Penn
agreed. According to the panel,
because new analysts' salaries are
typically much lower than those
of executives in the company, a
new analyst would be unlikely to
be fired.

The panel offered advice
about interviews and how to se
lect the right financial firm.
"Everything gets noted, and
everything gets evaluated," Penn
said in response to a question
about which part of the interview
is most important.

Lee Jackson '12 led a panel Thursday evening to address questions from
students hoping to break into the fields of finance and investment banking.
The panel addressed interviewing tips, hiring and the recession.
"You can walk into a first
round interview and already have
a second-round interview if you
network right.They're hiring peo
ple they like," he added.
Continuing to stress the im
portance of personality and inter
view skills, Penn downplayed the
importance of academic skills.
"We wanted a mix of people
from different banks, different of
fices and different divisions," said
Misha Nasrollahzadeh 'l3, direc
tor of external marketing for
Stanford Women in Business
(SWIB), which sponsored the
event.

Neither Nasrollahzadeh nor
Jackson said they have seen any
effects on campus from the Occu
py Wall Street movement or the
nationwide backlash against in
vestment banking. Both said they
have not had difficulty promoting
business or financing.
Causes of the crisis
According to Jackson, the
main problem of the financial cri
sis was debt. Caused by low inter
est rates and American spending
culture, by 2007 the U.S. savings
rate was negative, meaning peo
ple were spending more than they
were making.
Using a metaphor of "debt" as
a virus, Jackson said the country
had two options to deal with the
crisis. The first was to go to the
government, a "doctor" who
could give a specific prescription
based on a unique set of problems
in this case through cash infu

sions and/or buyouts.
Alternatively, one could go to
a central bank, the Federal Re
serve described by Jackson as
a "pharmacist" with only the
power to distribute aspirin. The
Federal Reserve was only capa
ble of loaning money, which it did
generously in the crisis; however
this failed to address the serious
problems.
As any doctor would tell you,
Jackson continued, occasionally
they catch the same virus as their
patients. The debt was transferred
to the government, which hap
pened in the United States and, in
a more disastrous way, to Euro
pean countries, such as Greece.
The Federal Reserve, howev
er, was left largely unharmed, ac
cording to Jackson. Central
banks have begun lending money
to these governments, similar to
"doctors taking aspirin," he said.
"That being said, I think fi
nance is a great industry to get
into," Jackson said to laughter
from the audience.
"It was nice to hear the pan
elists," said Adrian Rosas Ville
gas, a graduate student in man
agement science and engineering.
"It gave me a good idea of invest
ment banking."
"I thought it was well put on,
and it was the right mix of intro
ductory lecture-style talk with
questions and answers to delve
more deeply into what people's
concerns are," said Sam Paglia 'l3
of the event.
Jackson said he plans on hold
ing similar presentations about
newsworthy issues every Sunday
starting Jan. 29.

Lee Jackson 'l2 led a panel
Thursday evening with four other
Stanford students, each with ex
perience working for Wall Street
firms such as Morgan Stanley,
Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan,
to provide insight into the finan
cial industry for career hopefuls.
The event, titled "Recruiting in
the Financial Crisis," was held in a
packed room in the Nitery with
more than 50 students in atten
dance.
After a brief discussion of the

causes and effects of the financial
crisis, the panel opened up to
questions from the audience, hop
ing to inform audience members
about how to apply for various in
ternships in the financial field.
Several students questioned
whether the low hiring and bonus
rates of banking firms worry the
panelists for the future.
"You do need banking servic
es, despite what Occupy Wall
Street says," said Miles Penn 'l2, a
member of the panel who worked
at Goldman Sachs in investment
banking.
"They generally protect ana

lysts, too," Jackson said, as Penn
agreed. According to the panel,
because new analysts' salaries are
typically much lower than those
of executives in the company, a
new analyst would be unlikely to
be fired.

The panel offered advice
about interviews and how to se
lect the right financial firm.
"Everything gets noted, and
everything gets evaluated," Penn
said in response to a question
about which part of the interview
is most important.

Lee Jackson '12 led a panel Thursday evening to address questions from
students hoping to break into the fields of finance and investment banking.
The panel addressed interviewing tips, hiring and the recession.
"You can walk into a first
round interview and already have
a second-round interview if you
network right.They're hiring peo
ple they like," he added.
Continuing to stress the im
portance of personality and inter
view skills, Penn downplayed the
importance of academic skills.
"We wanted a mix of people
from different banks, different of
fices and different divisions," said
Misha Nasrollahzadeh 'l3, direc
tor of external marketing for
Stanford Women in Business
(SWIB), which sponsored the
event.

Neither Nasrollahzadeh nor
Jackson said they have seen any
effects on campus from the Occu
py Wall Street movement or the
nationwide backlash against in
vestment banking. Both said they
have not had difficulty promoting
business or financing.
Causes of the crisis
According to Jackson, the
main problem of the financial cri
sis was debt. Caused by low inter
est rates and American spending
culture, by 2007 the U.S. savings
rate was negative, meaning peo
ple were spending more than they
were making.
Using a metaphor of "debt" as
a virus, Jackson said the country
had two options to deal with the
crisis. The first was to go to the
government, a "doctor" who
could give a specific prescription
based on a unique set of problems
in this case through cash infu

sions and/or buyouts.
Alternatively, one could go to
a central bank, the Federal Re
serve described by Jackson as
a "pharmacist" with only the
power to distribute aspirin. The
Federal Reserve was only capa
ble of loaning money, which it did
generously in the crisis; however
this failed to address the serious
problems.
As any doctor would tell you,
Jackson continued, occasionally
they catch the same virus as their
patients. The debt was transferred
to the government, which hap
pened in the United States and, in
a more disastrous way, to Euro
pean countries, such as Greece.
The Federal Reserve, howev
er, was left largely unharmed, ac
cording to Jackson. Central
banks have begun lending money
to these governments, similar to
"doctors taking aspirin," he said.
"That being said, I think fi
nance is a great industry to get
into," Jackson said to laughter
from the audience.
"It was nice to hear the pan
elists," said Adrian Rosas Ville
gas, a graduate student in man
agement science and engineering.
"It gave me a good idea of invest
ment banking."
"I thought it was well put on,
and it was the right mix of intro
ductory lecture-style talk with
questions and answers to delve
more deeply into what people's
concerns are," said Sam Paglia 'l3
of the event.
Jackson said he plans on hold
ing similar presentations about
newsworthy issues every Sunday
starting Jan. 29.
