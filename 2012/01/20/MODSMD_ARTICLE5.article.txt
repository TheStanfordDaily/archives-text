## Financial recruiting event draws crowd 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
Lee Jackson 'l2 led a panel
Thursday evening with four other
Stanford students, each with ex
perience working for Wall Street
firms such as Morgan Stanley,
Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan,
to provide insight into the finan
cial industry for career hopefuls.
The event, titled "Recruiting in
the Financial Crisis," was held in a
packed room in the Nitery with
more than 50 students in atten
dance.
After a brief discussion of the

causes and effects of the financial
crisis, the panel opened up to
questions from the audience, hop
ing to inform audience members
about how to apply for various in
ternships in the financial field.
Several students questioned
whether the low hiring and bonus
rates of banking firms worry the
panelists for the future.
"You do need banking servic
es, despite what Occupy Wall
Street says," said Miles Penn 'l2, a
member of the panel who worked
at Goldman Sachs in investment
banking.
"They generally protect ana

lysts, too," Jackson said, as Penn
agreed. According to the panel,
because new analysts' salaries are
typically much lower than those
of executives in the company, a
new analyst would be unlikely to
be fired.

The panel offered advice
about interviews and how to se
lect the right financial firm.
"Everything gets noted, and
everything gets evaluated," Penn
said in response to a question
about which part of the interview
is most important.
