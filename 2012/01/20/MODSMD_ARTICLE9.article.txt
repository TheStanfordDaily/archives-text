# Rawson reigns as Daily's new MC
## 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN 
After three and a half years of
hard, soulless work, Margaret
Rawson 'l2 wanted to branch out
and make the most of her final
months at Stanford. Knowing that
nobody balances work and play
better than The Stanford Daily,
the Bethesda, Md. native figured
that a stint as Editor in chief
would be the best way to go out
with a bang.

With the votes tallied and her
victory made official early this
morning, Rawson donned mili
tary-grade safety glasses to pop
open her bottle of celebratory
champagne.

"So, how do 1 do this exactly?"
the senior asked with a smile and
a shrug. "Pop it like a blizzard,
right guys?"
Wanting to make her journey
into party-dom one step at a time,
Rawson insisted that the festivi
ties continue to the tune of
Beethoven's Fifth.

Rah-rah-Rawson
Rawson's election means that
the EIC post will be held by a
spring-quarter senior, and many
Daily staffers are eager to see her
bring that "senior spring" party
mentality into the office.
"I'm looking forward to a lot of
parties at The Daily, especially
ones with a lot of BJs" said head
copy editor Stephanie Weber 'l2.

"Who doesn't love Bartles and
Jaymes wine coolers?"

Long-time sports editor Jacob
Jaffe 'l2 wasn't too surprised with
the result, but in typical form, he
was ready to get down.

"To be honest, I knew how this
would play out a long time ago,"
the senior said. "I saw the final
vote count on the bottom of a
Snapple cap. And you know that
shit's legit."

To celebrate, Jaffe donned a
pair of stunna shades and de
clared, i'mma make it rain Skit
tles up in this place."

Former editor in chief Zach
Zimmerman 'l2 was too moved
by the moment for words, sitting
and silently staring into Jaffe's en
trancing hazel eyes.

Zimmerman then kissed his bi
ceps, tore the sleeves off his Grant
Hill t-shirt and proclaimed, "This
bro tank's for you, Mags."
Zimms then shotgunned an en
tire bottle of Johnnie Walker,
hopped in his DeLorean with Car
oline Caselli 'l2 and hit 88 miles
per hour.

Deputy editor Nathan "Flare"
Adams 'l2 was not in the office
for the vote. But he managed to
call in from his Ford Bronco to
congratulate Rawson.
"Put chyo **** on da phone,"
Adams said in a raspy growl.
Photography editor Mehmet
Inononononononu 'O9 was so

thrilled by Rawson's election that
he leapt up and ripped his shirt off,
beat his chest in a primal scream,
then ran off into the night, howl
ing at the moon to join his wolf
brothers. He later returned to fin
ish his night's work, breaking out a
round of Ouzo for the entire of
fice.

"More like Mehmet In
oyesyesyesyes," he said.

As Rawson's current co-man
ager of the news section and jort
fashion icon, Billy Gallagher 'l4
was so elated with the result that
he didn't know how to handle his
emotions.

"Margaret was practically cry
ing after the results came out," he
recalled. "But anytime feelings get
that close to me, I'm conditioned
to just shotgun a Steel Reserve.
Tall and frosty, baby."

Clueless, but swaggerful

Other staffers, though, were so
eager for The Daily's next six
month shindig that they forgot
some of the day's procedural de
tails.

Sports desk editor Jack Blan
chat 'l2 was unaware of election
day, and casually dismounted
from his steed, Dale Earnhardt Jr.
Jr., walked into the office and spat
in Rawson's celebratory glass of
champagne, proclaiming in his
southern drawl, "Rawson? I got
my first third-base while watching
Rawson's Creek. It was sixth
grade ... she was in my agricul
ture class."

Despite working at The Daily
for a fifth consecutive year, sales
manager Sam Svoboda 'll wasn't
even aware that he had submitted
a vote.

"I burned myself frying some
churros, and I just grabbed a piece
of paper to wrap my hands up,"
the fifth-year said. "If it was al
lowed, I probably would've just
voted for theTaco Bell dog."
Englishman and sports colum
nist Thomas W.R. Taylor was also
in the office for the election, but
was noticeably confused.
"Perhaps I simply do not un
derstand American elections,"
Taylor said, "but should the editor
in chiefs throne not simply be
passed to Kathleen's eldest son?
This system is, to be quite frank
with you sir, bloody bollocks com
pared to what we have in Britain,"
he said before riding off into the
night on his Revolight Troncycle.
Sports editor Miles Bennett-
Smith 'l3 strolled in two hours
after the election ended, holding a
strawberry topper and giggling to
himself as he ignored the whole
office and hurried over to his com
puter.

"Congratulations," said his
Mac√üook's text-to-speech feature
while Bennett-Smith Tebowed


THE PICS PERSON/The Stanford Daily
While she acknowledges the long-standing marriage between journalism and alcohol,
Margaret Rawson '12 struggled to open her bottle of victory champagne.
She promised to "throw down with her homies" in the future.
