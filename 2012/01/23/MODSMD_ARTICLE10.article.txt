# SHE WHO SHAPED FLOMO

Known to many as the home of
Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) and Indian Food Sun
days, Florence Moore Hall, or
FloMo, has a little known his
tory of eccentricities that date back to
the 1900s.
"Florence Moore really left behind a
legacy," said Samra Adeni 'l4, a FloMo
resident. "The story is that she demand
ed there be ice cream every day, which is
why we now have eight different flavors
to choose from all the time."
"Florence Moore must have been a
really interesting lady," Adeni added as
an afterthought.

In 1955, Moore, the widow of the
founder of a shipbuilding company,
made a 1 million dollar donation to the
University for the construction of a new
residence hall. Along with her money
came a few conditions.
One of the requirements was about
the residents themselves: although
FloMo now primarily houses SLE stu
dents and upperclassmen, Moore in
tended it to be an all-female dorm. At
the time, there was a severe shortage of
housing for female students.
Not only was FloMo constructed for
students, but students designed it as well.
"There was a huge thought process

on campus about student housing and
how students should live," said Julie
Cain, project coordinator for Stanford
Heritage Services. "I assume that FloMo
is a result of that thought process."
According to the University
Archives from March 1956, "participa
tion by women students in the planning
of Florence Moore Hall typifies the en
tire approach to the designing of the
structure [... and] much of the final Flo
rence Moore Hall will have been drawn
from the minds of the students who will
actually live there."
The collaboration of the female stu
dents and architect Milton Pflueger

gave rise to a residence hall that had
amenities including sun decks, separate
but connected dorm dining rooms and
pink bathtubs.
Though now co-ed, FloMo still has
features that are the direct result of Flo
rence Moore and the women who
helped design the dorm.
"Florence Moore apparently made
sure that every room had a full closet
that would be big enough to fit an
evening gown," Adeni said. "All these
cool quirks make FloMo an amazing
place to live."
