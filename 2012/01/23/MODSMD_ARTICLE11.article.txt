## EDITORIAL Cities and the Bay Area's environmental future 
### 
California has a rich history
of environmental activism.
When an obscure easterner
named John Muir arrived in San
Francisco in March 1868, he im
mediately asked a local carpenter
how to get out of the city. "Where
do you want to go?" asked the car
penter. "Anywhere that is wild"
replied Muir. Muir proceeded to
walk straight through the Central
Valley and into the Sierra Nevada,
where he would begin his long ca
reer as an environmental advo
cate and an important figure in the
establishment and growth of the
National Park System.
The environmentalists of
Muir's day worked tirelessly to
save beautiful places like
Yosemite and, by ensuring public
ownership and access, to make
them something that all Ameri
cans can experience. However, in
placing such a strong emphasis on
the preservation of especially sce
nic spaces, the generations that
followed Muir neglected the envi
ronmental potential of American
cities to accommodate growing
populations more economically
than new low-density develop
ments in, for example, California's
Central Valley. John Muir may
have wanted to get out of San
Francisco as fast as he could, but in
fact one of the easiest ways for
California to improve its quality of
life and achieve important envi
ronmental goals is to get people
into San Francisco.
The case for a larger San Fran
cisco is multifold, but it starts with
the basic observation that if peo
ple want to live there but cannot,
they will move somewhere else.
By constricting the supply of hous
ing and office space in highly de
sirable locations like San Francis
co, governments force would-be
residents to move to less expen
sive locations where their environ
mental impact is much greater,
and where access to city amenities
is limited. According to the Na
tional Housing Conference's Cen
ter for Housing Policy, San Fran
cisco was the nation's most expen
sive market for homebuyers and
renters in 2011. There is a tremen
dous demand for San Francisco
living that is going unmet due
largely to local regulation, and re
ducing these restrictions can be
justified economically even in the
absence of the positive environ
mental externalities entailed. Best

of all for California's cash
strapped state and municipal gov
ernments, doing so would require
no public money, and indeed
would provide relief governments
relative to the status quo by in
creasing the ratio of taxpayers to
infrastructure.
The environmental benefits of a
shift towards California's cities are
undeniable. According to a 2008
study by the Brookings Institution,
per-capita carbon dioxide emis
sions in the San Francisco-Oak
land-Fremont Metropolitan Area
are only slightly over half the aver
age of America's top 100 metro
areas. Indeed, six of the top 12
metro areas are located in Califor
nia. This in fact understates the en
vironmental benefits of city living
in California, as the unit of analysis
is the "Metropolitan Area," which
includes many low-density sub
urbs that require more energy use
per person and thus more emis
sions. Per-capita emissions in Cali
fornia are generally lower than in
other states because California
produces a relatively large share of
its electricity from renewables, and
as Stanford students can attest, the
need for air conditioning and heat
ing is mitigated by a generally mild
climate. Dense cities like San Fran
cisco emit even less per-capita than
the state average because of their
high share of trips taken on foot, by
bike or on transit relative to auto
mobiles, and due to economies of
scale in the heating and cooling of
buildings.
Accommodating more resi
dents in places like San Francisco
produces many other benefits that
are difficult to quantify. By divert
ing residents away from exurban
areas, development in cities pro
tects habitats important for the
maintenance of biodiversity and
frees space for agriculture in the
highly productive fields of the
Central Valley. The environmental
movement has over the last sever
al years hesitantly embraced cities
as away to make growth more sus
tainable. Nevertheless, efforts to
reduce restrictions on the density
of cities within the Bay Area and
beyond have been too limited in
scale to make an appreciable dif
ference. This is a goal that should
be pursued at least as strongly as
more expensive policies for curb
ing pollution like emissions taxes
or clean energy subsidies.
