# FRESHMAN '15
## How not to study 
### Bianca Chavez 
I am going to be honest: I never
studied much in high school.
The night before any test, I'd
allocate one to two hours for
studying. Approximately 70 per
cent of that time was spent star
ing at my bedroom wall and con
vincing myself that I needed to
study. The other 30 percent of the
time was spent scanning through
my textbooks (read: looking at
the pictures) and reviewing my
notes (read: looking the funny
things I drew in the margins).
For the most part, I survived
high school by doing two things:
going to class and asking ques
tions. That's it. As long as I did
both of those things, I could gain
good grades and a decent under
standing of the material.
I know my story is far from
unique; practically every kid in
my hall has a story about how he
or she used to sleep through
Spanish class or never did home
work, then still miraculously got
A's on tests.
Maybe Stanford kids are just
that smart. Maybe we're all in
sanely lucky. Or maybe our high
school teachers were so preoccu
pied with saving other students
from failing that they basically
left high-achieving kids to their
own devices. I'm thinking the real
answer is probably a dash of the
first explanation and heaping
spoonfuls of the latter two.
In any case, I pranced through
high school without many aca
demic struggles. Then I came to
Stanford.
Now and I'm sure this will
come as an Earth-shattering
statement to upperclassmen
I'm starting to realize that, um,
college is hard. For every one
hour I spend in class, I can expect
to spend at least two in the li
brary. Between hundreds of
pages of assigned reading, pa
pers, and projects, college seems
to be much more about studying
than it is about learning from
your professors.
Obviously, this change in
learning style presented a huge
challenge for me. Since I had
never done it extensively in high

school, I wasn't really sure how I
was supposed to study. Should I
just re-read the textbook? Write
down any and every bolded
word? Highlight random sen
tences that seem sort of impor
tant?
After speaking to some of my
friends, I knew they were just as
confused as I was.
Fortunately, now that I've had
one quarter of college, I've final
ly started to figure out which
study tips do NOT work. Below
are three of the worst offenders:
How Not to Study:
1. Don't study with your
friends. So three of your friends
happen to be in your IHUM
class. What a perfect situation;
this means you guys can study to
gether! Um ... or not. Nine
times out of 10, group study ses
sions devolve into chaos within
the first two minutes. Someone
asks the person next to her,
"Hey, have you seen 'Shit Col
lege Freshmen Say?"' and the
next thing you know, all plans of
studying have been thrown out
the window.
2. Don't study in a common
area. Because any attempt to
study in a lounge or a hallway

will fall apart faster than Kimmy
K's wedding.
3. Don't use your computer
unless it's absolutely necessary.
Why? Because, while the Inter
net is an amazing resource of in
formation, it is also where pro
ductiveness goes to die. You tell
yourself, "I'm just going to look
up this one quick fact," and then
suddenly it's 3 a.m. You've spent
the last two hours stumbling
through mildly amusing cartoons
and cute pictures of animals. And
you have an exam in six hours ..
. shit.
So after one quarter in col
lege, I have a decent idea of
which study habits are complete
ly unproductive. As for finding
out what tips actually work, I'm
sure that will happen within the
next quarter or two.
