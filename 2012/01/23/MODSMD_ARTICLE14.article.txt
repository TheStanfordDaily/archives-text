# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Class mobility and the end of capitalism 
### Miles Unterreiner 
On May 23,1857, the venera
ble British statesman Lord
Macaulay penned a bril
liant but little-remarked letter to
the Honorable H.S. Randall of
New York. In it, the eminent poet,
historian and politician predicted
that America's excessively demo
cratic political system would even
tually result in the nation's demise.
Tire aristocratic Macaulay fore
saw the day when America's im
poverished millions would forcibly
seize the property of the wealthy
few through taxation, to the lasting
detriment of all. "It is quite plain,"
Macaulay sniffed, "that your gov
ernment will never be able to re
strain a distressed and discontent
ed majority. For with you the ma
jority is the government, and has
the rich, who are a minority, ab
solutely at its mercy."
Sixteen years later, in a July
1873 speech to the Literary Socie
ty of Hudson College, then-U.S.
Representative and future presi
dent James A. Garfield responded
eloquently to Macaulay's charge.
Garfield, a self-made man of hum
ble origins, conceded that in a na
tion where "the hundredth may be

rich and powerful enough to hold
the 99 in subjection ... where such
permanent classes exist. . . the
conflict of which Macaulay speaks
is inevitable." Why? "Not that men
are inclined to fight the class above
them but they fight against any
artificial barrier which makes it im
possible for them to enter that
higher class, and become a part of
it."
But thankfully, declared
Garfield, there exist no such artifi
cial barriers in America. "In this
country, there are no classes... no
impassible barriers of caste. We
can truly say that through our po
litical society there run no fixed
horizontal strata through which
none can pass upward." Besides,
noted Garfield, Macaulay had neg
lected to take into account "the
great counterbalancing force of
universal education," which gave
every American the tools with
which to transcend his humble be
ginnings and strive ever upward to
a better, more prosperous future.
In America, concluded Garfield,
the poor felt that they might some
day become rich, and this hope
prevented the inception of de

structive class warfare.
But class mobility in America
has declined sharply since
Garfield's day. Extensive empirical
evidence from the Economic Mo
bility Project suggests that Ameri
can workers are now less upwardly
mobile than their counterparts in
France, Germany, Sweden, Cana
da, Norway, Finland, Denmark and
even Macaulay's famously classist
Britain.
Economist Markus Jantti has
found that 42 percent of Ameri
can men raised in the bottom fifth
of the income distribution remain
there as adults; the comparable
figure for Denmark is 25 percent,
and for Britain it's 30 percent.
Jantti further found that only 8
percent of American men born to
parents in the bottom quintile
rise to the top quintile, compared
to 12 percent of the British and 14
percent of Danes. Economist
Miles Corak has estimated that
while 16 percent of Canadians
born in the bottom tenth remain
there, 22 percent of Americans
do. In other words, one is now
more likely to live the American
Dream in Britain or Canada than

in America.
As America's famously fluid
class structure ossifies into the
"fixed horizontal strata" Garfield
so feared, American attitudes to
ward capitalism have changed for
the worse. Research by interna
tional opinions firm Globe Scan
has found that only 59 percent of
Americans now agree with the
statement that "the free market
economy is the best economic sys
tem for the future," down from 80
percent in 2002. Meanwhile,
Gallup has found that 36 percent
of Americans, including a majority
of Democrats, now hold positive
views of the previously taboo term
"socialism."
Nothing would be worse for
America than for Americans to
lose faith in capitalism. It is an in
disputable fact that free markets
are and have been the greatest en
gine for sustained economic
growth and prosperity in the histo
ry of the world. Economic freedom
launched the West to world domi
nance in the 19th century. China
has lifted hundreds of millions
from poverty since the pragmatic
Deng Xiaoping unleashed the dy
namic power of capitalism in his
country.
John Steinbeck famously wrote
that "socialism never took root in

America because the poor see
themselves not as an exploited
proletariat but as temporarily em
barrassed millionaires." But unless
the rising tide begins to lift the
dinghies of the poor along with the
luxury yachts of the rich, capital
ism as we know it will die. Unless
this nation takes concrete action to
preserve Garfield's vision of a
truly classless society in which any
one, regardless of birth, can rise to
wealth and prominence through
hard work, Macauley will be
proven right, and the majority will
seek solace in a suffocating social
ism.

It is therefore in everyone's
best interest including the very
rich that every child receive a
quality public education, adequate
health care and a fair start in life,
regardless of race, parental income
or geographic location. Class mo
bility, as Garfield knew, is capital
ism's last best hope for survival.

dinghies of the poor along with the
luxury yachts of the rich, capital
ism as we know it will die. Unless
this nation takes concrete action to
preserve Garfield's vision of a
truly classless society in which any
one, regardless of birth, can rise to
wealth and prominence through
hard work, Macauley will be
proven right, and the majority will
seek solace in a suffocating social
ism.

It is therefore in everyone's
best interest including the very
rich that every child receive a
quality public education, adequate
health care and a fair start in life,
regardless of race, parental income
or geographic location. Class mo

ism's last best hope for survival.

On May 23,1857, the venera
ble British statesman Lord
Macaulay penned a bril
liant but little-remarked letter to
the Honorable H.S. Randall of
New York. In it, the eminent poet,
historian and politician predicted
that America's excessively demo
cratic political system would even
tually result in the nation's demise.
Tire aristocratic Macaulay fore
saw the day when America's im
poverished millions would forcibly
seize the property of the wealthy
few through taxation, to the lasting
detriment of all. "It is quite plain,"
Macaulay sniffed, "that your gov
ernment will never be able to re
strain a distressed and discontent
ed majority. For with you the ma
jority is the government, and has
the rich, who are a minority, ab
solutely at its mercy."
Sixteen years later, in a July
1873 speech to the Literary Socie
ty of Hudson College, then-U.S.
Representative and future presi
dent James A. Garfield responded
eloquently to Macaulay's charge.
Garfield, a self-made man of hum
ble origins, conceded that in a na
tion where "the hundredth may be

rich and powerful enough to hold
the 99 in subjection ... where such
permanent classes exist. . . the
conflict of which Macaulay speaks
is inevitable." Why? "Not that men
are inclined to fight the class above
them but they fight against any
artificial barrier which makes it im
possible for them to enter that
higher class, and become a part of
it."
But thankfully, declared
Garfield, there exist no such artifi
cial barriers in America. "In this
country, there are no classes... no
impassible barriers of caste. We
can truly say that through our po
litical society there run no fixed
horizontal strata through which
none can pass upward." Besides,
noted Garfield, Macaulay had neg
lected to take into account "the
great counterbalancing force of
universal education," which gave
every American the tools with
which to transcend his humble be
ginnings and strive ever upward to
a better, more prosperous future.
In America, concluded Garfield,
the poor felt that they might some
day become rich, and this hope
prevented the inception of de

structive class warfare.
But class mobility in America
has declined sharply since
Garfield's day. Extensive empirical
evidence from the Economic Mo
bility Project suggests that Ameri
can workers are now less upwardly
mobile than their counterparts in
France, Germany, Sweden, Cana
da, Norway, Finland, Denmark and
even Macaulay's famously classist
Britain.
Economist Markus Jantti has
found that 42 percent of Ameri
can men raised in the bottom fifth
of the income distribution remain
there as adults; the comparable
figure for Denmark is 25 percent,
and for Britain it's 30 percent.
Jantti further found that only 8
percent of American men born to
parents in the bottom quintile
rise to the top quintile, compared
to 12 percent of the British and 14
percent of Danes. Economist
Miles Corak has estimated that
while 16 percent of Canadians
born in the bottom tenth remain
there, 22 percent of Americans
do. In other words, one is now
more likely to live the American
Dream in Britain or Canada than

in America.
As America's famously fluid
class structure ossifies into the
"fixed horizontal strata" Garfield
so feared, American attitudes to
ward capitalism have changed for
the worse. Research by interna
tional opinions firm Globe Scan
has found that only 59 percent of
Americans now agree with the
statement that "the free market
economy is the best economic sys
tem for the future," down from 80
percent in 2002. Meanwhile,
Gallup has found that 36 percent
of Americans, including a majority
of Democrats, now hold positive
views of the previously taboo term
"socialism."
Nothing would be worse for
America than for Americans to
lose faith in capitalism. It is an in
disputable fact that free markets
are and have been the greatest en
gine for sustained economic
growth and prosperity in the histo
ry of the world. Economic freedom
launched the West to world domi
nance in the 19th century. China
has lifted hundreds of millions
from poverty since the pragmatic
Deng Xiaoping unleashed the dy
namic power of capitalism in his
country.
John Steinbeck famously wrote
that "socialism never took root in

America because the poor see
themselves not as an exploited
proletariat but as temporarily em
barrassed millionaires." But unless
the rising tide begins to lift the
dinghies of the poor along with the
luxury yachts of the rich, capital
ism as we know it will die. Unless

preserve Garfield's vision of a
truly classless society in which any
