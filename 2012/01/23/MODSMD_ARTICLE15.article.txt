## HUSKIES STALL CARD STANFORD OFFENSE STRUGGLES IN LOSS 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Another strong effort from senior forward Josh
Owens was not enough for the Stanford men's
basketball team, as the squad fell to the Washing
ton Huskies in convincing fashion.
The Huskies (12-7,5-2 Pac-12) had a lot to play
for Saturday night at the Alaska Airlines Arena, as
their head coach, Lorenzo Romar, entered the
game a win away from both his 300 th career win
and 100 th career conference win. This added mo
tivation would prove all that the Huskies needed.
They got it done for their coach, swamping Stan
ford (15-5, 5-3 Pac-12) defensively en route to a
76-63 victory. The loss marked the end to a disap
pointing weekend for the Cardinal, which suffered
a loss to Washington State on Thursday.

After a surprising 10-1 start, the Card has been
unable to find its groove. With this loss, the team
fell to fifth in the Pac-12. Stanford hasn't had much
luck on the road in conference play, dropping
three of its four games. Stanford will need to right
the ship this week in practice, with a matchup
against first-place California looming.
The Cardinal stuck with the Huskies for the be
ginning of the first half, but after sophomore for
ward Josh Huestis' jumper cut the Washington
lead to 13-11, Stanford went stone cold. The Card
would only score one field goal for the next 10
minutes of play, going a miserable l-for-17 from
the floor until a nice dish from senior guard Jarrett
Mann led to a three-point play for sophomore for
ward Dwight Powell. Despite the scoring drought,
the Card faced just a seven-point halftime deficit.
Stanford could not stop Washington's guard
play in the second half, as sophomore Terrence
Ross and freshman Tony Wroten combined for 26
points. For the game, Wroten led all scorers with 21
points, while Ross, who was most recently named
Pac-12 Player of the Week, finished with 18.
After a Mann layup pulled the Cardinal to
within five with 14:48 remaining, the Huskies went
on an 18-2 run to lead 61-40. Stanford would not
be able to overcome this deficit, as the team strug
gled to find an offensive rhythm.

Sophomore guard Aaron Bright tied for the team lead with 14 points, but the Stanford
men's basketball team struggled to score all game in a 76-63 loss at Washington.
Stanford was outrebounded
for only the third time this year, as
Washington burned the Cardinal
with offensive rebounds and sec
ond-chance points. A very solid
16-to-nine turnover margin in the
Cardinal's favor was equalized by
the teams' shooting performanc
es. Stanford shot a lowly 35.9 per
cent from the field and 15.8 per
cent from beyond the arc, while

Washington shot 50.8 percent and
35.7 percent from three.
Owens was the only Stanford
player to shoot above the 50-per
cent clip, going 7-for-13 from the
floor for 14 points. Sophomore
guard Aaron Bright added 14
points of his own on 5-of-13
shooting.
The win was more than just a
milestone for Romar, as his team
leapfrogged Stanford in the Pac
-12 standings, improving to just a
half game out of first place. With
10 conference games remaining,
the Cardinal will have to make
the most of its schedule if it in

tends to put forward a strong case
for the NCAA Tournament in
March.
Stanford will look to get the
ball rolling again this Sunday
when it travels to Berkeley. The
Golden Bears currently sit in a tie
for first in the Pac-12, just a game
ahead of the Cardinal. A win next
weekend would put Stanford to
regain its footing in the Pac-12,
while a loss would be a major
blow for a struggling team.

WASHINGTON 76
1/21, Seattle, Wash.


LAN GARCIA-DOTY/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore guard Aaron Bright tied for the team lead with 14 points, but the Stanford
men's basketball team struggled to score all game in a 76-63 loss at Washington.
Stanford was outrebounded
for only the third time this year, as
Washington burned the Cardinal
with offensive rebounds and sec
ond-chance points. A very solid
16-to-nine turnover margin in the
Cardinal's favor was equalized by
the teams' shooting performanc
es. Stanford shot a lowly 35.9 per
cent from the field and 15.8 per
cent from beyond the arc, while

Washington shot 50.8 percent and
35.7 percent from three.
Owens was the only Stanford
player to shoot above the 50-per
cent clip, going 7-for-13 from the
floor for 14 points. Sophomore
guard Aaron Bright added 14
points of his own on 5-of-13
shooting.
The win was more than just a
milestone for Romar, as his team
leapfrogged Stanford in the Pac
-12 standings, improving to just a
half game out of first place. With
10 conference games remaining,
the Cardinal will have to make
the most of its schedule if it in

tends to put forward a strong case
for the NCAA Tournament in
March.
Stanford will look to get the
ball rolling again this Sunday
when it travels to Berkeley. The
Golden Bears currently sit in a tie
for first in the Pac-12, just a game
ahead of the Cardinal. A win next
weekend would put Stanford to
regain its footing in the Pac-12,
while a loss would be a major
blow for a struggling team.
