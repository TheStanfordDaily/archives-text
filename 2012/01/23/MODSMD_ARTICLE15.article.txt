## HUSKIES STALL CARD STANFORD OFFENSE STRUGGLES IN LOSS 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Another strong effort from senior forward Josh
Owens was not enough for the Stanford men's
basketball team, as the squad fell to the Washing
ton Huskies in convincing fashion.
The Huskies (12-7,5-2 Pac-12) had a lot to play
for Saturday night at the Alaska Airlines Arena, as
their head coach, Lorenzo Romar, entered the
game a win away from both his 300 th career win
and 100 th career conference win. This added mo
tivation would prove all that the Huskies needed.
They got it done for their coach, swamping Stan
ford (15-5, 5-3 Pac-12) defensively en route to a
76-63 victory. The loss marked the end to a disap
pointing weekend for the Cardinal, which suffered
a loss to Washington State on Thursday.

After a surprising 10-1 start, the Card has been
unable to find its groove. With this loss, the team
fell to fifth in the Pac-12. Stanford hasn't had much
luck on the road in conference play, dropping
three of its four games. Stanford will need to right
the ship this week in practice, with a matchup
against first-place California looming.
The Cardinal stuck with the Huskies for the be
ginning of the first half, but after sophomore for
ward Josh Huestis' jumper cut the Washington
lead to 13-11, Stanford went stone cold. The Card
would only score one field goal for the next 10
minutes of play, going a miserable l-for-17 from
the floor until a nice dish from senior guard Jarrett
Mann led to a three-point play for sophomore for
ward Dwight Powell. Despite the scoring drought,
the Card faced just a seven-point halftime deficit.
Stanford could not stop Washington's guard
play in the second half, as sophomore Terrence
Ross and freshman Tony Wroten combined for 26
points. For the game, Wroten led all scorers with 21
points, while Ross, who was most recently named
Pac-12 Player of the Week, finished with 18.
After a Mann layup pulled the Cardinal to
within five with 14:48 remaining, the Huskies went
on an 18-2 run to lead 61-40. Stanford would not
be able to overcome this deficit, as the team strug
gled to find an offensive rhythm.
