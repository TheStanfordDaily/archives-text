What a difference 24 hours make.
Just a night after one of the team's worst
offensive outputs in some time, the Stanford
men's volleyball team put on a clinic and re
bounded from a tough loss to UCLA with a
road win over UC-Santa Barbara in four sets
on Saturday, an important early season split in

Sophomore outside hitter Brian Cook de
served much of the credit for the quick turn
around on offense, notching a career-high 17

kills against the No. 14 Gauchos (2-4, 0-2
MPSF) with an otherworldly .682 hitting per
centage on the night.
Against No. 3 UCLA (7-1, 2-0 MPSF),
Cook was one of many Cardinal players to
struggle on the attack his -.167 hitting per
centage was not too far behind the team's
anemic .179 overall percentage in a 3-0 sweep.
