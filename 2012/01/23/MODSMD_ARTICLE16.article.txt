# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL Cook leads bounce-back over UCSB

What a difference 24 hours make.
Just a night after one of the team's worst
offensive outputs in some time, the Stanford
men's volleyball team put on a clinic and re
bounded from a tough loss to UCLA with a
road win over UC-Santa Barbara in four sets
on Saturday, an important early season split in

Sophomore outside hitter Brian Cook de
served much of the credit for the quick turn
around on offense, notching a career-high 17

kills against the No. 14 Gauchos (2-4, 0-2
MPSF) with an otherworldly .682 hitting per
centage on the night.
Against No. 3 UCLA (7-1, 2-0 MPSF),
Cook was one of many Cardinal players to
struggle on the attack his -.167 hitting per
centage was not too far behind the team's
anemic .179 overall percentage in a 3-0 sweep.

STANFORD 3
UC-SANTA BARBARA 1
1/21, Santa Barbara, Calif.
"Brian did a great job of refo
cusing himself," said head coach
John Kosty after the UC-Santa
Barbara victory. "He saw the
block and the court very well and
took some really smart swings."
But most of the Cardinal at
tack was on the same page on Sat
urday. Sophomore Steven Irvin
and senior Brad Lawson joined
Cook with double-digit kills, and
Stanford hit .421 as a team.
It wasn't all that easy to slow
Santa Barbara, however.
As Stanford racked up the
kills, the Gaucho duo of Evan
Licht and Miles Evans had its way
with the Cardinal defense. Al
though Santa Barbara hit just .161
in the first set, the Cardinal could
not pull away. A late kill by Licht
tied the score at 21, and three er
rors from the Gauchos allowed
Stanford to take the first set 25-
22.
The second game followed a
similar tack, as neither team real
ly distanced itself from the other
even as Stanford hit .419 and
Santa Barbara only .258. Five late
kills from the Cardinal put the
game out of reach, however, tilt
ing the match in Stanford's favor
with a 25-21 set win.
The Gauchos finally put things
together in the third set, hitting
.484 with just three attack errors
to slip past Stanford and cut the
deficit to 2-1, but the Cardinal
nearly matched that effort with a
.455 fourth set to finish Santa Bar
bara off with a 25-18 victory.
With much of the attention de
servedly going to the offense, it
would be easy to overlook one of
Stanford's best defensive efforts
of the young season. Although
Gauchos Licht and Evans had im
pressive games, the Cardinal had
11.5 total team blocks and limited
several of Santa Barbara's best at
tackers to negative offensive out
puts.
That was in stark contrast to
Friday's match against the Bruins,
when Stanford managed just two
team blocks and could not stop
UCLA's offense from hitting .376
over the three sets.
The two-time Ail-American
Lawson had 13 kills and a .333 hit
ting percentage, but UCLA
proved why it is one of four unde
feated teams in MPSF play and
the No. 3 team in the country be
hind No. 1 BYU and No. 2 UC-
Irvine.
Stanford continues a 10-match
road swing which will span 40

days when all is said and done
with a trip to Columbus, Ohio, for
the Ken & Dave Dunlap Invita
tional. The Cardinal will take on
No. 6 Penn State in a rematch of
the 2010 NCAA final on Friday's
first day of the tournament, then
follow that up with a match
against No. 10 Ohio State, the de-

fending national champion, on
Saturday.

Then it's back to MPSF play on
the road for Stanford, with a
looming double against BYU on
the first weekend of February and
two more weekends of conference
matches before the Cardinal re
turns home to play Pepperdine on
Feb. 24.
