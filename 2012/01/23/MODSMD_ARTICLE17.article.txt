# SLOW START NO PROBLEM FOR LADIES
## STANFORD CRUISES IN SECOND HALF 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Despite an ugly first half against Washington
on Saturday, the Stanford women's basketball
team rallied with a stronger second-half effort to
top the Huskies, 65-47.

After not being able to find the bottom of the
net effectively for the first 20 minutes, the Cardi
nal finally found away to separate itself from the
Huskies the three-point shot of freshman
Taylor Greenfield, who hit four three-pointers
over an eight-minute span to spark a 17-3 run.
The Huxley, lowa native helped stretch Stan
ford's lead from just seven points at halftime into
a 21-point lead with 8:45 left to put the game well
out of reach.
"Taylor came in and knocked down big shots
for us," said head coach Tara VanDerveer. "She's
an extremely intelligent player and she under
stands what we need from her."
Stanford shot a paltry 30.3 percent from the
field in the first half, mostly due to the Huskies
holding the Ogwumike sisters in check
Nnemkadi and Chiney combined for just nine
points in the first half. But after Greenfield start
ed dropping everything from outside, the sisters

women's basketball team rebound from a poor first half to blow out Washington, 65-47.
were able to work more effective
ly inside, with senior Nnemkadi
eventually finishing with 17 points
and seven rebounds and sopho
more Chiney ending up with 15
points and 11 rebounds, her eighth
consecutive double-double.
"The discussion at halftime
was about coming in and hitting
open shots," Greenfield said.
"Thankfully my shot was going
today. [Washington] was too fo
cused on Nneka and Chiney, like
they should be. I tried to find the
right spot at the right time, I was
noticing they were flocking inside
and they totally forgot about us
half the time."
With her 15 points, Nnemkadi
Ogwumike moved into fifth place
on Stanford's career scoring list
with 2,082 points. With five more,
Ogwumike can vault herself into
fourth place, and with 11 regular
season games remaining, as well
as the Pac-12 and NCAA Tourna
ments, Ogwumike has an excel
lent chance to pass Val Whiting,
Jayne Appel, Kate Starbird and

Candice Wiggins for first place all
time.
The Huskies were led by guard
Jazmine Davis, who had 16 points,
followed by fellow guard Mer
cedes Wetmore, who added 11.
However, Wetmore turned the
ball over a team-high seven times,
a substantial portion of the 22
turnovers the Huskies had during
the game.
After the efforts of the Ogwu
mikes and Greenfield, the Cardi
nal didn't have a great offensive
game, shooting less than 30 per
cent from beyond the arc, but it
did redeem a 30.3 shooting per
centage in the first half with a
46.7-percent conversion rate from
the floor in the second frame. The
Stanford defense did its part to
pick up the slack, though, holding
the Huskies to 33.3-percent
shooting from the floor.
The Cardinal now has a full
week off before welcoming Cal
into Maples Pavilion on Saturday
in a matchup of the top two teams
in the Pac-12 Conference. The
Bears are 6-2 in conference play,
just two games behind the Cardi
nal, which is still a perfect 8-0.
