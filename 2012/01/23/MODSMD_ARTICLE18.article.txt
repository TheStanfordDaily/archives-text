# Unexpected guys decide title games

Football is a team game.
It's a simple saying, and its
sheer obviousness makes it
a cliche that everyone
seems to feel the need to
say. Of course, on days like Sunday,
you start to remember where that
cliche came from.
Sunday was the second-most im
portant day of the NFL year: confer
ence championship Sunday. And al
though sports analysts spent hun
dreds of hours dissecting the ins and
outs of the teams, there isn't a person
in the world that expected the two de
ciding figures in the action to be Billy
Cundiff and Kyle Williams.
Yep. Tom Brady, Ed Reed, Frank
Gore and Eli Manning all did their
thing, but in the end the two spots in
the Super Bowl came down to the
right foot of Cundiff and the right
hand (and right knee) of Williams.
In case you live under a sports
free, ESPN-free, NFL-free, news
free, Facebook-free rock, here's a
brief summary of what happened.
The Ravens and Patriots went
back and forth in a very closely con
tested affair in Foxboro, Mass. Nei
ther team led by more than a touch
down, and the Patriots held a slim
23-20 lead in the final minutes. The
Ravens drove down the field and ap
peared to take the lead with just sec
onds left when quarterback Joe
Flacco threaded the needle to find
his receiver Lee Evans in the end
zone. However, Patriot comerback
Sterling Moore knocked the ball out
of Evans' hands at the last second,
preventing the touchdown.
Overtime was still virtually as
sured, though, as Cundiff lined up
for the game-tying kick with almost
no time left on the clock. It was only
a 32-yard kick, and Cundiff was 22-
for-24 inside 40 yards and hadn't
missed a kick inside 50 yards in the
second half all year. Naturally, he
hooked it wide left, and just like that,
the Patriots lucked in to the Super
Bowl.
If you're thinking no one could pos
sibly feel worse than Cundiff. you only
needed to wait about four hours to
find a great candidate. The NFC
Championship Game was just as
down-to-the-wire as the AFC version,
as the 49ers and Giants were impossi
ble to separate for 60 minutes of ac
tion, sending the game to overtime.
After each team punted in the extra
period, the Giants were stopped near
midfield and forced to punt again.
Williams, a second-year receiver out
of Arizona State, was filling in for the
injured Ted Ginn, Jr., as punt returner.
Regulation wasn't kind to Williams,
who had no catches on four targets
and also let a punt bounce off his knee
before the Giants' Devin Thomas re
covered. That muff led to the Giants'
second touchdown, but it wouldn't
even end up being the most memo
rable gaffe for Williams. That's be
cause he fumbled another punt in
overtime, and again Thomas recov
ered, this time at the San Francisco 24-
yard line. A few runs later set up New
York kicker Lawrence Tynes, and un
like Cundiff he didn't miss the short
field goal.
So here we are: Patriots-Giants,
round two. It'll happen almost exactly
four years to the day after the two
teams met in the famous Super Bowl
XT IT.
And that means we'll get two weeks
of David Tyree helmet catch clipsTwo
weeks of 18-1 talk. Two weeks of Tom
Brady vs. the Giants' pass rush. Two
weeks of comparing Eli Manning to
his brother Peyton. Two weeks of Bill
Belichick, Victor Cruz and the Gronk.
But will any of that really matter?
The Ravens had more rushing yards,
more passing yards, fewer fumbles
and fewer interceptions than the Pa
triots. Baltimore probably wins that
game 99.9 times out of 100. But Sun
day was the 0.1, and New England
gets to take the trip to Indy.The Nin
ers' offense had no turnovers, its de
fense held Manning to five yards per
attempt, and the Giants had to punt
an unbelievable 12 times. Yet it's New
York that gets to represent the NFC
on Feb. 5.
Games don't always go the way the
statistics say, and that's one of the great
things about football. Fans of the
Ravens and 49ers are all too familiar
with Cundiff and Williams than they
ever wanted to be, and fans of the Pa
triots and Giants had better take no
tice.
Football is the team game. It takes
