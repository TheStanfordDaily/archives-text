# TENNIS OFF TO QUICK START
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis
team started out its dual-match
season in style over the weekend,
sweeping a pair of matches
against highly-ranked opponents
on the road in Tulsa, Okla. Stan
ford was able to weather the ab
sence of two-time Ail-American
Bradley Klahn out for a month
with an injury and claim its
first two wins of the young season.
The Cardinal, ranked No. 6 in the
preseason polls, beat the No. 23
Tulsa Hurricanes 4-3 on Friday af
ternoon and followed that victory
up with a 5-2 beat-down of the No.
20 North Carolina Tar Heels on

Friday's match against Tulsa
began inauspiciously for the Stan
ford squad as the Cardinal was de
feated in all three doubles match
es, providing Tulsa with the impor
tant first point of the day. The new
doubles matchups for the Cardi
nal, which had to shuffle its lineup
without Klahn, were unable to
adapt to the more seasoned Hur
ricane tandems.
The six subsequent singles
matches were mostly close from
the start, and it was clear that this
contest was going to go right
down to the wire. True to form, the
meet was tied at three points
apiece entering the third and final

set on the first court, where senior
Ryan Thacher was battling sopho
more Japie De Klerk as Thacher
looked to avenge his loss to De
Klerk a year ago. In the pivotal
third set, De Klerk jumped out to
a commanding 4-1 lead, but
Thacher would amp up his game
and storm to victory by winning
the set's final five games to close
out the match for the Stanford
victory. Freshmen Robert Stine
man and John Morrissey, both
playing in their first collegiate
dual matches, also contributed
greatly to the victory by both win
ning their singles matches.
Saturday's match against
North Carolina was a more one
sided affair. The Cardinal got off
to a good start in the neutral-site
contest by clinching the tightly
contested doubles point when the
No. 1 team of Thacher/Morrissey
defeated its Tar Heel opponents
8-6.
From then on, the outcome of
the match was never really in
doubt as, after a loss by junior
Denis Lin at the hands of UNC's
Esben Hess-Olesen on the No. 3
court, Stanford rattled off four
straight points to cement the vic
tory. Thacher and Stineman both
won again for the Cardinal and
were joined in the winners' circle
by junior Matt Kandath and soph
omore Daniel Ho.
Head coach John Whitlinger
spoke about the difficulty and im
portance of this early road trip
and stressed the testing nature it
was sure to have on his team:
