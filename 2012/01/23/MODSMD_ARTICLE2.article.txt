## Library begins digital archiving Collections dominated by Stanford history collected in online databases 
### MARY HARRISON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the face of challenges posed by an in
crease in social media, archivists at the Stan
ford University Libraries have adapted new
technologies to digitally archive a traditional
ly community-driven database of Stanford
documents.
Library Archivist Daniel Hartwig said that
documents have been traditionally collected
from Stanford staff or alumni who feel that
they have something to contribute to the
study of the history of Stanford. The catalog
includes personal letters of former University
President Donald Tresidder, lecture notes
from students in the 1960s and materials from
the controversial work of psychology profes
sor Philip Zimbardo.
"We're lucky in that our focus is limited to
Stanford so we have a kind of built-in mecha
nism there for alumni to donate things,"
Hartwig said.
However, now that correspondence and
official documents are often in digital form,
collecting materials for the archives has be
come more difficult.
"We've known how to archive paper for
quite some time," said Andrew Herkovic, di
rector of communications and development
for the Stanford Libraries. "There's a lot of
new art and science that needs to be devel
oped for digital archiving. We've been doing a
lot of web archiving for Stanford websites.
There's no copyright issues there ... so we've
captured well over 300 discrete websites to
taling, I think, close to half a terabyte of data."
Major challenges in digitizing the archives
include collecting documentation of student
life from email and on websites like Facebook
and Twitter.
"Right now we've set up an electronic
drop box so rather than, say, mailing things
physically to us, you can just log in, put some
thing in a folder and you're done," Hartwig
said.
However, issues of legality complicate dig
ital archiving when personal correspondenc
es take place over third-party websites such
as Facebook or Twitter. If a member of Face
book posts content, it becomes the property
of Facebook.
"Definitely for those third-party propri
etary products [such as social networks and
image sharing sites], the main issue is copy
right," Hartwig said. "We would like to cap
ture those [websites], but we don't really have
permission."
"Copyright colors everything we do,"
Herkovic said.
The library has recognized the importance
of social networking in driving recent move
ments such as the Arab Spring, thus motivat
ing archivists' search for this data.
"When things pop up like [the Occupy
Movement], we try to be proactive and go
after them," Hartwig said. "These tools really
aren't set up for outsiders to capture easily."
Stanford Archives is now using tools such
as Archive Facebook to save records of Face
book activities.
"It's a plug-in you install through your
Firefox browser," Hartwig said. "It creates a
local copy of basically your entire Facebook
presence and then you can copy that over to
our drop box."
Patti Hanlon-Baker, a lecturer in the Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR), has ex
perienced first-hand through her research the
challenges that are occurring in
the Stanford archives.
Hanlon-Baker said that having
first-person material has often
been more helpful in her research
than official documents or news
paper articles, "just to understand
the depth of the conversation."
"As someone who teaches
rhetoric and thinks about struc
ture of rhetoric ... to not have
first person documents like fliers I
find troubling," Hanlon-Baker
said.
Other large organizations such
as Google and the Library of Con
gress are on the cutting edge of
archiving digitized information.
According to Hartwig, Google
is "building these tools to get your
data or your material out of their
services and to import them into
someplace else. They're a little bit
ahead of the curve in terms of
portability of material."
The Library of Congress is tak
ing in the entire archive of Twitter.
The archives are also using a
tool called digital forensics, nor
mally used in the context of law
enforcement, to "authenticate and
make readable things that may be
of interest from a particular com
puter or server," according to
Herkovic.
"It's always a catch-up game, a
reactive effort," Hartwig said,
"[Students] are always going to
use what is easiest or what makes
most sense to them, so we kind of
have to bite the bullet and see if it
can work for us."

The amount of digital informa
tion available to archivists is in
creasing exponentially, Herkovic
said.
"This also has the effect that it
will swamp a lot of researchers be
cause there's so much more stuff
available," he added.
Herkovic attributed this in
crease in material to the fact that
people save more information on
a computer than they would on
paper.
"Archiving is getting more
challenging . . . fast," Herkovic
said.
Both Hartwig and Herkovic
agreed that the digitalization of in
formation will have a major effect
on the jobs of archivists and re
searchers.
"I think this all will have a pro
found effect on the way people do
research," Herkovic said.
