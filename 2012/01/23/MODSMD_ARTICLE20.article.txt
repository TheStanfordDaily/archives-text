# ARIZONA TEAMS LEFT IN WAKE

### GEORGE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's and women's swim
ming and diving teams had an im
pressive showing in back-to-back
dual meets against Arizona and
Arizona State at the Avery
Aquatic Center this past week
end.
The tough two-day stretch did
not seem to faze the women's
team at all as No. 6 Stanford start
ed off by soundly defeating No. 24
Arizona State 132.5-97.5 on Fri
day. The Cardinal then followed
up that performance with an even
more impressive upset over No. 5
Arizona the next day, winning
164-136 and improving its dual
meet record to 6-1.

Against Arizona State, the
women's team did not use its best
lineup in an effort to save most of
its firepower against a more fear
some Arizona team. The Cardinal
relied on depth to defeat the for
midable but clearly overmatched
Sun Devils. In three classic exam

pies, Stanford swept Arizona
State in the 50 freestyle, 400 indi
vidual medley and 100 freestyle in
1-2-3 fashion. In those events
alone, the Cardinal outscored the
Sun Devils 48-8.
In both the 1-meter and 3-
meter springboard events, Ari
zona State's standout diver Elina
Eggers edged out Stanford's
sophomore Stephanie Phipps.
However, Eggers was the sole
diver for the Sun Devils, allowing
the Cardinal's depth to match her
two victories and tie Arizona
State in diving at 18 points apiece.
As a result of the win on Fri
day, the women's team carried
some momentum going into its
matchup against Arizona. Even
with this momentum, however, a
victory over the No. 5 team in the
country would be a difficult feat
considering that Arizona was had
not competed the previous day.
But on Saturday afternoon, the
Cardinal stunned the Wildcats
with an almost 30-point victory.
It seemed as if Arizona would
gain the upper hand early by
touching out Stanford in the first
event of the meet, the 400 medley
relay, by just over one-tenth of a

second. But the Cardinal took
control in the next event,finishing
1-2-4 in the 1000 freestyle. The
two teams would trade off events
until around the halfway point of
the meet, at the 50 freestyle, when
Stanford took the lead and never
looked back. Senior Sam Wood
ward and sophomore Maya Di-
Rado led the way with each swim
mer winning two individual
events. Woodward took the 100
butterfly and 50 freestyle while

Dißado won the 200 individual
medley and 200 backstroke an
event where Stanford notched a
1-2-3 sweep over Arizona.
On the men's side, the No. 3
Cardinal swimmers and divers
easily took care of Arizona State
on Friday, winning by a lopsided
score of 160-71. Stanford domi
nated in every aspect of the meet,
winning all 13 events. The men's
team took a similar approach to
the meet as the women's team by
saving its best lineup for a much
faster Arizona team the next day.
The Cardinal relied on the talent
ed freshman class to do most of
the swimming. The strategy clear
ly worked, as 12 of the 13 event

winners were Stanford freshmen.
Stanford faced a tremendously
tough turnaround, going from
beating a 0-5 Arizona State team
on Friday to facing Arizona, the
No. 1 team in the nation, on Satur
day. The men's team was unable
to duplicate the women's team's
success in what was otherwise a
flawless weekend, narrowly los
ing to Arizona by a score of 153-
145. Things went awry right off
the bat when Wildcat relays swam
a 1-2 sweep over the Cardinal in
the first event of the meet, the 400
medley relay. It also didn't help
that Stanford's "A" relay team
was disqualified.
Senior distance specialist

Chad La Tourette was the only
double individual event winner
for the Cardinal, notching victo
ries in both the 1,000 freestyle and
500 freestyle. In the process, La
Tourette extended his undefeated
dual-meet streak to 21 events a
streak that dates back to his fresh
man year. Freshman David Nolan
won the 200 freestyle but took
second to Arizona's senior Cory
Chitwood by almost one full sec
ond in the 200 backstroke. Like
wise, senior Bobby Bollier domi
nated the 200 butterfly but fin
ished third in the shorter 100 but
terfly event.
Despite this loss, the Cardinal
proved that it will be a national
title contender by hanging with
the top team in the country. On
another positive note, the men's
divers showed their continued
dominance on the board. The
Cardinal finished 1-2-4 on both
the 1-meter and 3-meter spring
board, with freshman Kristian
Ipsen sweeping the two events.
The divers helped the team to stay
within striking distance of the
Wildcats. In fact, with just two
events left in the meet, the score
was tied at 131 apiece. It wasn't
until the 400 individual medley,
the second-to-last event, that Ari
zona drew the dagger with a 1-2-3
sweep.
The men's next dual will be on
Feb. 3 and 4 at USC, while the
women will travel to UCLA and
USC on Friday and Saturday.

1-2-4 in the 1000 freestyle. The
two teams would trade off events
until around the halfway point of
the meet, at the 50 freestyle, when
Stanford took the lead and never
looked back. Senior Sam Wood

Dißado won the 200 individual

event where Stanford notched a
1-2-3 sweep over Arizona.
On the men's side, the No. 3
Cardinal swimmers and divers
easily took care of Arizona State
on Friday, winning by a lopsided
score of 160-71. Stanford domi

the meet as the women's team by

faster Arizona team the next day.
The Cardinal relied on the talent

the swimming. The strategy clear

winners were Stanford freshmen.
Stanford faced a tremendously
tough turnaround, going from
beating a 0-5 Arizona State team
on Friday to facing Arizona, the
No. 1 team in the nation, on Satur
day. The men's team was unable
to duplicate the women's team's
success in what was otherwise a
flawless weekend, narrowly los
ing to Arizona by a score of 153-
145. Things went awry right off
the bat when Wildcat relays swam
a 1-2 sweep over the Cardinal in
the first event of the meet, the 400
medley relay. It also didn't help
that Stanford's "A" relay team
was disqualified.
Senior distance specialist

Chad La Tourette was the only
double individual event winner
for the Cardinal, notching victo
ries in both the 1,000 freestyle and
500 freestyle. In the process, La
Tourette extended his undefeated
dual-meet streak to 21 events a
streak that dates back to his fresh
man year. Freshman David Nolan
won the 200 freestyle but took
second to Arizona's senior Cory
Chitwood by almost one full sec
ond in the 200 backstroke. Like
wise, senior Bobby Bollier domi
nated the 200 butterfly but fin
ished third in the shorter 100 but
terfly event.
Despite this loss, the Cardinal
proved that it will be a national
title contender by hanging with
the top team in the country. On
another positive note, the men's
divers showed their continued
dominance on the board. The
Cardinal finished 1-2-4 on both
the 1-meter and 3-meter spring
board, with freshman Kristian
Ipsen sweeping the two events.
The divers helped the team to stay
within striking distance of the
Wildcats. In fact, with just two
events left in the meet, the score
was tied at 131 apiece. It wasn't
until the 400 individual medley,
the second-to-last event, that Ari
zona drew the dagger with a 1-2-3
sweep.
The men's next dual will be on
Feb. 3 and 4 at USC, while the
women will travel to UCLA and
