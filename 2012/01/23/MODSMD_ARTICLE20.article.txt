The men's and women's swim
ming and diving teams had an im
pressive showing in back-to-back
dual meets against Arizona and
Arizona State at the Avery
Aquatic Center this past week
end.
The tough two-day stretch did
not seem to faze the women's
team at all as No. 6 Stanford start
ed off by soundly defeating No. 24
Arizona State 132.5-97.5 on Fri
day. The Cardinal then followed
up that performance with an even
more impressive upset over No. 5
Arizona the next day, winning
164-136 and improving its dual
meet record to 6-1.

Against Arizona State, the
women's team did not use its best
lineup in an effort to save most of
its firepower against a more fear
some Arizona team. The Cardinal
relied on depth to defeat the for
midable but clearly overmatched
Sun Devils. In three classic exam

pies, Stanford swept Arizona
State in the 50 freestyle, 400 indi
vidual medley and 100 freestyle in
1-2-3 fashion. In those events
alone, the Cardinal outscored the
Sun Devils 48-8.
In both the 1-meter and 3-
meter springboard events, Ari
zona State's standout diver Elina
Eggers edged out Stanford's
sophomore Stephanie Phipps.
However, Eggers was the sole
diver for the Sun Devils, allowing
the Cardinal's depth to match her
two victories and tie Arizona
State in diving at 18 points apiece.
As a result of the win on Fri
day, the women's team carried
some momentum going into its
matchup against Arizona. Even
with this momentum, however, a
victory over the No. 5 team in the
country would be a difficult feat
considering that Arizona was had
not competed the previous day.
But on Saturday afternoon, the
Cardinal stunned the Wildcats
with an almost 30-point victory.
It seemed as if Arizona would
gain the upper hand early by
touching out Stanford in the first
event of the meet, the 400 medley
relay, by just over one-tenth of a
