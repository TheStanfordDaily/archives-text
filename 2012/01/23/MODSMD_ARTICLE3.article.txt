# Occupy Stanford expands
## Scope includes Occupy Education with UC-Berkeley Davis 
### JOSH HOYT STAFF WRITER 
The Occupy Stanford movement is ex
tending its efforts beyond Meyer Library
with new on-campus initiatives, in addition
to participation in neighboring city protests
and collaboration with other universities on
a new Occupy Education movement.
On Friday, Occupy Stanford members
took part in Occupy Wall Street West, in
which more than 1,500 protesters marched
in the San Francisco financial district. The
San Francisco protest intentionally coincid
ed with Occupy the Courts, a national
protest of the anniversary of the Citizens
United ruling.

On Saturday, Occupy organizers from
Stanford and other area schools met at the
University of California, Berkeley to plan
"Occupy Education."The effort will include
a weeklong protest beginning with a student
walk out on Mar. 1. Students and faculty
then plan to march from UC-Berkeley to
Sacramento to "Occupy the Capital."
"At the meeting today we decided on
calling it 'The 99-Mile March for Education
and Social Justice,"' said Anna McConnell
'l4, a member of Occupy Stanford.
The idea for Occupy Education has
taken off in Northern California, where UC
tuition hikes have focused the movement's
attention on those at the top of the UC sys
tem. Students at Occupy Stanford see this

new protest as an effort to strengthen the
movement across schools.
"1 have become really good friends with
Rob Slaughter, who experienced severe po
lice brutality at Cal, and now he is in Wash
ington, D.C. occupying in front of the White
House," McConnell said. "You form these
natural connections all over the country."
The movements are careful to avoid hi
erarchical relationships, and the result is
that connections are often made on an indi
vidual basis.
Occupy UCDavis member Artem
Raskin, class of 2013, said he believes this
kind of organization is challenging, but that
