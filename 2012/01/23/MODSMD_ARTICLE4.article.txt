# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Education for women is paramount, says Kristof 
### REBECCA HANLEY 
New York Times columnist and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner
Nicholas Kristof identified gender discrimination as the century's
paramount moral challenge when he spoke Saturday evening in
Cubberley Auditorium. Kristof compared gender inequality to slav
ery in the 19th century and to totalitarianism in the 20th.
"Women and girls aren't the problem," Kristof said. "They are
the solution."
Kristof argued that education, particularly for girls and young
women, holds the key to enacting change in impoverished and de
veloping countries. Educating a girl, Kristof stated, inspires dramat
ic changes and deteriorates other social issues.
On the topic of gender discrimination leading to deaths, Kristof
said it is an issue that both men and women must address together.
"Just as the Holocaust was not just a Jewish problem, this is a
global rights issue, and it needs to be handled as such," he said.
In response to a student's question about why global issues may
receive more attention than local concerns, Kristof said there is a
misconception that gender discrimination is only an international
issue.
He explained that the issue is pertinent throughout the United
States, as girls who run away from home become the responsibility
of society.
"We don't have the moral authority to criticize or offer our aid to
other countries unless we can clean up our act in the U. 5.," he said.
However, Kristof also made the point that on the issue of pover-

ty, "the issue abroad is truly a differ
ent kind."
"It is an issue of a different order
or magnitude in other aspects of
the world," Kristof said.
In the question and answer por
tion of the event, Kristof answered
questions on topics ranging from
his personal opinion of China's
one-child policy to his favorite war
story.
"Kristof gave a dynamic and
thought-provoking talk that elabo
rated on the topic of gender inequal
ity and third world poverty with
Stanford students in an exceptional
ly candid and funny lecture," sad
Dylan Bulkeley-Krane 'l3, director

of the Speakers Bureau, which co
sponsored the event along with
Stanford In Government (SIG) and
FACE AIDS. "We are lucky to have
experienced such a sincere and ac
complished speaker."
"Kristofs visit to campus has
been almost a year in the making,"
said Otis Reid 'l2, SIG Chair. "We
chose Kristof because of his strong
passion for humanitarian issues
and his emphasis on inspiring
young people to engage in a life of
service."
To conclude his discussion,
Kristof posed a question to the au
dience,
"We, sitting here, have truly won
the lottery of life, but with it comes
responsibility," he said. "What will
you do with your responsibility?"
