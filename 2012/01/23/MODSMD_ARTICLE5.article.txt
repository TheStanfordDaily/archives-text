## High-speed rail project faces setbacks 
### ILEANA NAJARRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
California's High-Speed Rail
(HSR) project has suffered set
backs recently, including the resig
nation of its director Roelof van
Ark, effective in two months, on
Thursday, Jan. 12. Chair of the High
Speed Rail's Board of Directors
Thomas Umberg also stepped
down.
While Umberg will be replaced
by two-time Bay Area Rapid Tran
sit Board member Dan Richard,
the project's leadership and sus

tainability will now depend on sup
port from California Governor
Jerry Brown.
The project aims to construct
the nation's first high-speed rail,
connecting Los Angeles to San
Francisco on an 800-mile track. As
the track would stretch through
Menlo Park and Palo Alto, 36.2
acres of Stanford-owned land
would be affected.
Voters approved the project in
2009, but expenses have doubled to
$98.5 billion, causing voters to scru
tinize the project.
Van Ark, who played a major

role in spearheading the project, re
signed for personal reasons, report
ed The Sacramento Bee and the
Palo Alto Weekly.
"I need to focus myself more on
my family, and maybe some other
interests," he said to both The Bee
and the Weekly.
In a Jan. 12 press release, Cali
fornia assemblywoman Cathleen
Galgiani emphasized the roles both
Van Ark and Umberg played in the
initial conception of the project.
"Mr. Van Ark and Mr. Umberg
have worked with stakeholders to
address everything from whether

'wind speed' from the train will af
fect bee pollination in agricultural
areas, the importance of respecting
sacred sites and Native American
burial grounds near the Grapevine,
the value we place on involving
small emerging business enterpris
es during the engineering and con
struction contracting process, build
ing the first public private partner
ship of this scope in California and
navigating the political turbulence
associated with building the na
tion's first high-speed rail system,"

Galgiani wrote.
"I have deep respect and owe
my deepest gratitude to both Mr.
Van Ark and Mr. Umberg," she
continued.
Alain Enthoven, professor
emeritus of public and private
management, co-authored a re
port published Oct. 12 that ana
lyzed 12 misleading statements
found in the California High
Speed Rail Authority's 2012
Drafted Business Plan. En
thoven's report critically analyzed
each proposal in the plan and elab
orated on the low likelihood of the
proposals coming to fruition.
The report also predicted the
critical financial consequences.
"Without all that becoming
true, and if the Governor insists
the project go forward, the State
will require voters to approve at
least another $5O billion — $9O

billion of bonds; plus face the costs
of annual operating subsidies,"
Enthoven's report stated.
Enthoven expressed his own
understanding of the rationale be
hind Van Ark's resignation.
"I think that Van Ark decided
this ship was sinking what with ex
ploding costs, declining public con
fidence in what they say or in the
project [and] rising public opposi
tion," he wrote in an email to The
Daily. "I am amazed that Jerry
Brown is continuing to support this
money-loser at a time when we are
cutting education spending."
Despite the increasing negative
feedback, Brown declared his full
support for the project at his State
of the State speech on Jan. 18.
"Critics of the high-speed rail
project abound, as they often do
when something of this magnitude
is proposed," he said. "The Panama
Canal was for years thought to be
impractical, and Benjamin Disraeli
himself said of the Suez Canal, 'To
tally impossible to be carried out.'
The critics were wrong then, and
they're wrong now."

Galgiani also stated in her press
release that she trusts Brown to
continue his support for the rail
and that it will allow him to "put
his stamp on the project."
"I remain committed to work
ing with Governor Brown and
Chair Richard to move this project
forward and put California's econ
omy on a fast-track to recovery
with "high speed jobs,'" Galgiani
wrote.
As to whether Brown's
strengthened and renewed ac
tivism will have a positive effect on
the rail's delayed progress, State
Senator Ted W. Lieu stated that the
project is entirely dependent on
the governor's efforts.
"He is a much more practical
governor now than maybe 30
years ago, but he is still a dreamer,"
Lieu said in an interview with The
New York Times. "High-speed rail
is very evocative and is one of
those things that I think he would
like to be part of his legacy."

California's High-Speed Rail
(HSR) project has suffered set
backs recently, including the resig
nation of its director Roelof van
Ark, effective in two months, on
Thursday, Jan. 12. Chair of the High
Speed Rail's Board of Directors
Thomas Umberg also stepped
down.
While Umberg will be replaced
by two-time Bay Area Rapid Tran
sit Board member Dan Richard,
the project's leadership and sus

tainability will now depend on sup
port from California Governor
Jerry Brown.
The project aims to construct
the nation's first high-speed rail,
connecting Los Angeles to San
Francisco on an 800-mile track. As
the track would stretch through
Menlo Park and Palo Alto, 36.2
acres of Stanford-owned land
would be affected.
Voters approved the project in
2009, but expenses have doubled to
$98.5 billion, causing voters to scru
tinize the project.
Van Ark, who played a major

role in spearheading the project, re
signed for personal reasons, report
ed The Sacramento Bee and the
Palo Alto Weekly.
"I need to focus myself more on
my family, and maybe some other
interests," he said to both The Bee
and the Weekly.
In a Jan. 12 press release, Cali
fornia assemblywoman Cathleen
Galgiani emphasized the roles both
Van Ark and Umberg played in the
initial conception of the project.
"Mr. Van Ark and Mr. Umberg
have worked with stakeholders to
address everything from whether

'wind speed' from the train will af
fect bee pollination in agricultural
areas, the importance of respecting
sacred sites and Native American
burial grounds near the Grapevine,
the value we place on involving
small emerging business enterpris
es during the engineering and con
struction contracting process, build
ing the first public private partner
ship of this scope in California and
navigating the political turbulence
associated with building the na
tion's first high-speed rail system,"

"I have deep respect and owe
my deepest gratitude to both Mr.
Van Ark and Mr. Umberg," she
continued.
