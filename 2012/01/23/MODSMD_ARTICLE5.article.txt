## High-speed rail project faces setbacks 
### ILEANA NAJARRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
California's High-Speed Rail
(HSR) project has suffered set
backs recently, including the resig
nation of its director Roelof van
Ark, effective in two months, on
Thursday, Jan. 12. Chair of the High
Speed Rail's Board of Directors
Thomas Umberg also stepped
down.
While Umberg will be replaced
by two-time Bay Area Rapid Tran
sit Board member Dan Richard,
the project's leadership and sus

tainability will now depend on sup
port from California Governor
Jerry Brown.
The project aims to construct
the nation's first high-speed rail,
connecting Los Angeles to San
Francisco on an 800-mile track. As
the track would stretch through
Menlo Park and Palo Alto, 36.2
acres of Stanford-owned land
would be affected.
Voters approved the project in
2009, but expenses have doubled to
$98.5 billion, causing voters to scru
tinize the project.
Van Ark, who played a major

role in spearheading the project, re
signed for personal reasons, report
ed The Sacramento Bee and the
Palo Alto Weekly.
"I need to focus myself more on
my family, and maybe some other
interests," he said to both The Bee
and the Weekly.
In a Jan. 12 press release, Cali
fornia assemblywoman Cathleen
Galgiani emphasized the roles both
Van Ark and Umberg played in the
initial conception of the project.
"Mr. Van Ark and Mr. Umberg
have worked with stakeholders to
address everything from whether

'wind speed' from the train will af
fect bee pollination in agricultural
areas, the importance of respecting
sacred sites and Native American
burial grounds near the Grapevine,
the value we place on involving
small emerging business enterpris
es during the engineering and con
struction contracting process, build
ing the first public private partner
ship of this scope in California and
navigating the political turbulence
associated with building the na
tion's first high-speed rail system,"
