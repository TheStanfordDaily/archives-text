## Med school Dean Pizzo wins top APS award 
### ALLY ARRIETA 
Dean of the Stanford School
of Medicine Philip Pizzo is this
year's recipient of the John How
land Award, the top award given
by the American Pediatric Socie
ty-
Pizzo, 67, joined the Stanford
faculty in 2001. He previously
spent over two decades at the Na
tional Institutes of Health re
searching childhood cancer, and
has served as an advocate for pa
tients and families in need of pe
diatric care.
"I've tried to focus on those
aspects of pediatrics where the
outcomes are dire and where re
search can particularly make a
difference in the lives of young
people," Pizzo said. "There are
tremendous unmatched needs in
the care of children with cancer
and HIV and AIDS."
Pizzo played an important
role in the passage of the Best
Pharmaceuticals for Children
Act, which promotes clinical tri
als on drugs targeted toward chil
dren. His advocacy at the Food
and Drug Administration has ac
celerated the development of
drugs for children with AIDS.
"He has changed the para
digm for understanding and man
agement of these diseases and
has been an advocate for the
changes that have translated pe
diatric research to practice," said
David Stevenson, professor of
pediatrics, who nominated Pizzo
for the award.
Pizzo also lead an initiative to
secure federal funding for resi
dent training at children's hospi
tals in the late 19905. He has over
500 published articles and 16
books about his findings in oncol
ogy and infectious disease.
"I have been so privileged to
be part of a wonderful career
path involving both the educa
tion of students and trainees and
research that has hopefully im
pacted the lives of people with
catastrophic disease, and I have
done that because it is so deeply
meaningful in its own right, never
really seeking any recognition for
it," Pizzo said.
"Just to know that others see
that as valuable and that they see
the work I've done over my ca

reer as worthy of an award of life
time achievement is deeply hum
bling," he continued.
The John Howland Award,
named in honor of the first pro
fessor of pediatrics at John Hop
kins University, is awarded to one
individual each year. The last in
dividual from Stanford to receive
the award was Harold K. Faber,
one of the first chairmen of the
Department of Pediatrics, who
was honored in 1956.
Pizzo grew up in the Bronx
and was the first in his family to
attend college, graduating from
Fordham University and the Uni
versity of Rochester School of
Medicine. Before coming to Stan
ford, Pizzo served as physician
in-chief at the Children's Hospi
tal in Boston and as chair of the
Harvard Medical School's De
partment of Pediatrics.
At Stanford, Pizzo has worked
to revolutionize how physicians
are trained through the construc
tion of the Li Ka Shing Center for
Learning and Knowledge.
"Oftentimes people are re
viewed for many years before
being selected, so it is extremely
unusual for Phil to receive this
award so early," Stevenson said.
"John Howland was a remark
able clinician, scientist, mentor
and visionary leader who empha
sized patient care in an environ
ment of lab research and clinical
study, and I recognized that Phil
shared these attributes."
Pizzo will receive his award at
the American Pediatric Associa
tion's annual meeting in Boston
on April 29.
"Among the challenges exist
ing in pediatric medicine going
forward are how to preserve
health and how to utilize knowl
edge that might predict outcomes
of illness that might occur during
childhood or during adulthood,"
Pizzo said. "Here the intersection
of genomic medicine and other
technologies that serve as early
diagnostic indicators is enor
mously important."
" [I have] always been motivat
ed by a sense of mission seeing
what are the things we can do to
make the world a better place,"
