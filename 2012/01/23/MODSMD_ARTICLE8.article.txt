## Algorithm maps cancer trajectory 
### SARAH MOORE 
Researchers at the Stanford
University School of Medicine have
developed a mathematical algo
rithm to help predict the severity of
bladder cancer.
The results were published on
line Mondayjan. 16, in the Proceed
ings of the National Academy of
Sciences, and may influence treat
ment plans for patients with blad
der cancer.
"There were two main findings,"
said Chad Tang, a medical student
who contributed to the study. The
researchers "divided up the bladder
cancer into different subtypes,
which have different prognostic im
plications. Second, one of the mark
ers they used was a robust predictor
of clinical outcomes."
Before applying the algorithm,
the team also researched bladder
cancer stem cells.
"The algorithm was originally
published in the context of predict
ing genes in development and dif
ferentiation," said co-author De
bashis Sahoo, instructor at the
Pathology Stem Cell Center. "What
we have now is an application to
cancer."
The work with the algorithm

started approximately two years
ago after a 2009 paper identified
three different types of bladder can
cer: basal, intermediate and differ
entiated. These subgroups are iden
tified by markers of the keratin
(KRT) protein family. The basal
subtype is marked by KRTI4, inter
mediate is identified by KRTS and
differentiated is identified by
KRT2O.
The most severe cases of bladder
cancer are consistently related to
the basal subgroup. This knowledge
will allow doctors to plan the treat
ment of patients diagnosed with this
type of cancer.
"The clinician has to remove
the bladder in the case of certain
patients because of the progress of
the cancer, and the way they do it
now is based on state and the grade
of the cancer, which is very subjec
tive," Sahoo said. "This would be
the first time that a molecular mark
er, which is very objective, can guide
the clinician."
Removing the bladder is a com
plicated operation. Markers identi
fied by this algorithm will provide
better indication of whether sur
gery is necessary when compared to
traditional methods.
"I was motivated to do research

where I could use my expertise in
computer science to contribute to
healthcare, in particular cancer,"
Sahoo said. "Some of the relatives
in my family were victims of can
cer."
Tang cited intellectual interest as
motivating his involvement.
"I got involved because I was in
terested in cancer and biology,"
Tang said. "I knew the post docs
pretty well, and I was really interest
ed in stem cell studies."
The study will motivate further
research on the subject.
"So far, breast cancer is the only
kind with a similar way of subtyp
ing," said Keith Chan, assistant pro
fessor at the Baylor College of
Medicine and a co-author of the
2009 paper. "Hopefully we can ex
tend it to other types of cancer and
provide better prognostic informa
tion for the patients."
"The next step is to try to move it
to a prospective clinical trial to vali
date its results," Chan said. "The
second thing is to try to understand
the biology of these cells, so we can
target them. That's what we're
working on right now."
