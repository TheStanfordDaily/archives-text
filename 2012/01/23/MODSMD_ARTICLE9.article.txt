## The
						Claw IN PERSPECTIVE 
### â€” Ann Tyler Moses 
w f you see a fountain,
I you go to it. That's
I just natural in us,"
said Aristides
Demetrios, sculptor
of Stanford's iconic White Me
morial Fountain. Students know
it better as "the Claw."
The urge, innate or not, is visi
ble virtually all times of day. It is a
site for studying, swimming,
kayaking, conversing, playing
music and, before Big Game,
skewering the Cal mascot, Oski
the Bear.
"People are just drawn to that
space," said Julie Cain, project co
ordinator for Stanford Heritage
Services. "You see people in it
and enjoying it, or just sitting and
reading and hearing the sound of
the water, because it's like music.
It does everything a fountain
should do."
The design for Demetrios'
sculpture, which was installed in
1964, was selected in a competi
tion. To come up with the blue
prints, he went to campus each
day for a month straight, he said,
studying the proposed site from
every angle and at all times of
day.
"What I noticed was that
every hour, on the hour, all the
students came by; and whatever
you put there, the lower six feet
of it would be masked," he said.
To keep the blur of bicycles
and hurried pedestrians from ob
scuring it, Demetrios made sure
the sculpture was as meaningful
when seen above the heads of
passersby.

"I made something that, if you
cut it off at six feet, it'll make two
sculptures, one little one and one
big one," he said. "In the normal
course of the day, you could have
a sculpture that was at once tall,
at once short."
One of the most powerful as
pects of the Claw, Demetrios ar
gued, is the seemingly constant
change in its shape and thus in a
viewer's experience with it.
"It is different no matter
which way you come at it," he
said.
In the umpteen-way-inter
section that is White Plaza, the
possibilities for new views are
endless.
The fountain was commis
sioned by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond
B. White to honor their sons,
William N. White '49 and John B.
White II '49, who died in separate
accidents before they graduated.
"The tragedy of people dying
young is that you never knew
what they might be," Demetrios
said. "So every form starts with
something solid, and ends in
water, which is not solid; it's
amorphous. The wind blows it, it
goes this way and that way."
The fountain is nearing its
50th anniversary on campus. It
has been upgraded over the
years: its jets were retuned last
spring and the steps leading into
it have been removed.
According to Demetrios, "It's
more humanly accessible now
than it was when it was first dedi
cated."
