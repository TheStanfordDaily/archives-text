## RON SPOGLI: Stanford to San Marino 
### NATASHA WEASER 
Standing at six feet, four inches tall and
dressed in a sharp black suit, Ronald
Spogli '7O, former U.S. Ambassador
to Italy and San Marino, appeared a
firm, powerful character. But his
warmth emerged as he fondly recalled his
time on the Farm and its profound impact on
his life.

Spogli was a first-generation college stu
dent and is a third-generation Italian-Ameri
can. He was raised in an English-speaking
household in Los Angeles and knew no Ital
ian before arriving at the Farm.
"We had a lot of Italian customs, but the
language was not something I knew," he said.
At Stanford, Spogli learned Italian and
studied in Florence as a junior. There, he said,
he understood the value of learning about
other cultures.

"It was a true adventure," Spogli said. "I
learned how to live in another culture, to meet
its challenges and to thrive in those challeng
ing circumstances. I got out of my comfort
zone, and it was a great personal growth op
portunity."

At Stanford, Spogli majored in history, but
he was also interested in both Italian Renais
sance studies and East Asian studies. After
graduating, he spent a year in the East Asian
studies graduate program, worked as an assis
tant for the Florence program and went to
Milan to research the social impact of labor
migration in Italy.

After years of academia, though, Spogli
said he felt ready to enter the corporate
world, so he went to study at Harvard Busi
ness School. After graduating in 1975, Spogli
worked in investment banking for Dean Wit
ter Reynolds before co-founding Freeman
Spogli & Co., a private equity firm, in 1983.
Forty years after his graduation, Spogli's
ties to Stanford remain strong. He partici
pates in various Stanford awareness and
fundraising campaigns, currently serves on

the Board of Trustees and is a member of the
eponymous Freeman Spogli Institute's advi
sory board. From 2000 to 2004 he was in
volved in the Campaign for Undergraduate
Education, and from 2002 to 2005, he also
served on the Bing Overseas Studies Program
Council.

Norman Naimark, who served as the direc
tor of the Bing Overseas Studies Program
(BOSP) at a time when Spogli was not on the
Council, remarked on Spogli's lasting impact
on the Program. Spogli advised her on how to
"deal with a Council of donors and friends of
BOSP that focused on the importance of
sharing the inputs of decision-making with
the Council and using their collective wisdom
to help me resolve BOSP issues," Naimark
wrote in an email to The Daily.
In addition, Spogli continued to support
BOSP while he was U.S. Ambassador to Italy.

"He often invited the Florence students to
visit the embassy and even his residence in
Rome," Naimark said. "He helped us think
through the issues surrounding the move of

Being a diplomat is one
of the most wonderful
experiences I've had...l
would do it again a
thousand times over.
RONALD SPOGLI

the Florence program to a more
attractive location."

Although he is proud of his
many accomplishments, Spogli
said that the highlight of his ca
reer was his role as U.S. Ambassa
dor to Italy and San Marino.
"The wonderful thing about
being an ambassador to a country
like Italy is that you are limited
only by your energy, enthusiasm
and creativity," he said.
One of his major tasks as am
bassador was to battle chronic
low economic growth in Italy. Ac
cording to Spogli, for Italy to at
tract investment and grow, the
government needs to make fun
damental reforms to the labor
market, educational system and
legal system.
Spogli also had to strengthen
political ties between the United
States and Italy and reinforce the

cultural link between the two
countries. This proved a chal
lenge: in 42 months, he saw three
different parliaments and two
different presidents.
In 2006, President George W.
Bush appointed Spogli the first
U.S Ambassador to San Marino,
a small enclave located within
Italian borders. Its citizens speak
Italian and also use the Euro as
currency, but maintain political
independence from Italy.
San Marino is "a fascinating
country because it claims to be
the oldest democratic republic in
the world," he said.

He left the post in 2009.
Spogli credited Stanford with
helping him find his passion in
diplomacy.

"Being a diplomat is one of
the most wonderful experiences
I've had in a life where I've been
blessed with incredible things,"
he said. "I would do it again a
thousand times over."

Although he is proud of his

"The wonderful thing about
being an ambassador to a country

and creativity," he said.
One of his major tasks as am

legal system.
Spogli also had to strengthen
political ties between the United
States and Italy and reinforce the

cultural link between the two
countries. This proved a chal

different parliaments and two
different presidents.
In 2006, President George W.
Bush appointed Spogli the first
U.S Ambassador to San Marino,
a small enclave located within
Italian borders. Its citizens speak
Italian and also use the Euro as
currency, but maintain political
independence from Italy.
San Marino is "a fascinating
country because it claims to be
the oldest democratic republic in
the world," he said.

He left the post in 2009.
Spogli credited Stanford with

Standing at six feet, four inches tall and
dressed in a sharp black suit, Ronald
Spogli '7O, former U.S. Ambassador
to Italy and San Marino, appeared a
firm, powerful character. But his
warmth emerged as he fondly recalled his
time on the Farm and its profound impact on
his life.

Spogli was a first-generation college stu
dent and is a third-generation Italian-Ameri
can. He was raised in an English-speaking
household in Los Angeles and knew no Ital
ian before arriving at the Farm.
"We had a lot of Italian customs, but the
language was not something I knew," he said.
At Stanford, Spogli learned Italian and
studied in Florence as a junior. There, he said,
he understood the value of learning about
other cultures.

"It was a true adventure," Spogli said. "I
learned how to live in another culture, to meet
its challenges and to thrive in those challeng
ing circumstances. I got out of my comfort
zone, and it was a great personal growth op
portunity."

At Stanford, Spogli majored in history, but
he was also interested in both Italian Renais
sance studies and East Asian studies. After
graduating, he spent a year in the East Asian
studies graduate program, worked as an assis
tant for the Florence program and went to
Milan to research the social impact of labor
migration in Italy.

After years of academia, though, Spogli
said he felt ready to enter the corporate
world, so he went to study at Harvard Busi
ness School. After graduating in 1975, Spogli
worked in investment banking for Dean Wit
ter Reynolds before co-founding Freeman
Spogli & Co., a private equity firm, in 1983.
Forty years after his graduation, Spogli's
ties to Stanford remain strong. He partici
pates in various Stanford awareness and
fundraising campaigns, currently serves on

the Board of Trustees and is a member of the
eponymous Freeman Spogli Institute's advi
sory board. From 2000 to 2004 he was in
volved in the Campaign for Undergraduate
Education, and from 2002 to 2005, he also
served on the Bing Overseas Studies Program
Council.

Norman Naimark, who served as the direc
tor of the Bing Overseas Studies Program
(BOSP) at a time when Spogli was not on the
Council, remarked on Spogli's lasting impact
on the Program. Spogli advised her on how to
"deal with a Council of donors and friends of
BOSP that focused on the importance of
sharing the inputs of decision-making with
the Council and using their collective wisdom
to help me resolve BOSP issues," Naimark
wrote in an email to The Daily.
In addition, Spogli continued to support
BOSP while he was U.S. Ambassador to Italy.

"He often invited the Florence students to
visit the embassy and even his residence in
Rome," Naimark said. "He helped us think
through the issues surrounding the move of
