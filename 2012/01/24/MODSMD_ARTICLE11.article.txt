# SOCIAL MEDIA NOT SO NEW
## 
### AMRITA RAO 
Although some may call
social media unique to
the 21st century, two
researchers at Stan
ford say this predica
ment reveals nothing fundamen
tally new. In 17th and 18th centu
ry France, social media stirred up
society and played as much of a
role in individual lives as it does
today.
"Social networks have been
around as long as we have," said
Anai's Saint-Jude, M.A. 'O3, Ph.D.
'll, one of the researchers. A net
work need not be virtual, or even
based on a means of communica
tion, to bring together people who
might not have otherwise known
each other. Physical spaces like
Masonic lodges, courts or theaters
created social networks of their
own.
Seventeenth-century Paris
marked the beginning of modern
day media in many ways. Accord
ing to Saint-Jude, the birth of jour
nalism, literary critique and even
the concepts behind blogs and
tweets can be traced back to that
age. Social elites hired individuals

to follow and report on events.
Billets, leaflets of paper cast
anonymously into the street, in
habited the niche now filled by
Twitter.
Seventeenth-century students
also felt the weight of social
media. Early modern universities
revolved around tight-knit net
works of student societies and
served as hubs of publication.

for 'posting' something," said as
sociate professor of French and
Italian Dan Edelstein, the other
main researcher.

For example, a student might
be expelled for association with
an atheistic publication.
Comparative literature pro
fessor Hans Gumbrecht, Saint-
Jude's Ph.D. advisor, highlighted
a particular way in which social
media has evolved.

"While I agree with the basic
take that the subjective feeling of
informational overload was not
so different, what's more interest
ing is the feeling of acceleration
today," he said.
An email today might receive
a response in minutes whereas a
letter would certainly require
days.

With electronic media, "you get
the most current developments in

stantaneously, which affects how
you go about your day," said Cody
Behan 'l5, a student in the class
Media, Culture and Society.
Publications and pamphlets
could have the same effect over
time, but would have to be passed
from person to person, while
media today enjoy simultaneous
viewership on a one-to-many
scale.

Both Edelstein and Saint-
Jude recognize that innovation
creates new phenomena and that
the social media of today have
unique features that create par
ticular challenges that would not
have existed in the early modern

period.
"Certainly the scale has
changed . . . the volume has
changed," Saint-Jude said.
She thought of these changes
as an effect of the shift from phys
ical to virtual spaces, which in
crease scale and speed and allow
people to explore their identities
in new ways. While these ad
vances make transmission easier
and more efficient, she said, they

also create problems of their own.
Edelstein agreed.
"Back then, you wouldn't get
the accidental posts where you
forget you're friends with your
boss," he said.

The deliberateness of physical
forms of media made people
more thoughtful about what they
chose to say in published form.
Saint-Jude argued the media
might have also differed due to
differing societal focuses: in the
17th century, people knew they
were being watched, and there
fore lived up to societal ideals
when using social media. Saint-
Jude advised social media users
today to think back to those of the
17th century and understand the
roles they play in the public
sphere.

"Think about your persona,"
Saint-Jude said. "No one's check
ing, but consequences still exist in
terms of people's perception of
you."

The deliberateness of physical
forms of media made people

chose to say in published form.
Saint-Jude argued the media

differing societal focuses: in the
17th century, people knew they
were being watched, and there
fore lived up to societal ideals
when using social media. Saint-
Jude advised social media users
today to think back to those of the
17th century and understand the
roles they play in the public
sphere.

"Think about your persona,"
Saint-Jude said. "No one's check
ing, but consequences still exist in
terms of people's perception of
you."
