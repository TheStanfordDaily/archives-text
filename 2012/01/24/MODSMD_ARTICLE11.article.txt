# SOCIAL MEDIA NOT SO NEW
## 
### AMRITA RAO 
Although some may call
social media unique to
the 21st century, two
researchers at Stan
ford say this predica
ment reveals nothing fundamen
tally new. In 17th and 18th centu
ry France, social media stirred up
society and played as much of a
role in individual lives as it does
today.
"Social networks have been
around as long as we have," said
Anai's Saint-Jude, M.A. 'O3, Ph.D.
'll, one of the researchers. A net
work need not be virtual, or even
based on a means of communica
tion, to bring together people who
might not have otherwise known
each other. Physical spaces like
Masonic lodges, courts or theaters
created social networks of their
own.
Seventeenth-century Paris
marked the beginning of modern
day media in many ways. Accord
ing to Saint-Jude, the birth of jour
nalism, literary critique and even
the concepts behind blogs and
tweets can be traced back to that
age. Social elites hired individuals

to follow and report on events.
Billets, leaflets of paper cast
anonymously into the street, in
habited the niche now filled by
Twitter.
Seventeenth-century students
also felt the weight of social
media. Early modern universities
revolved around tight-knit net
works of student societies and
served as hubs of publication.
"You could still get in trouble

Social networks
have been around
as long as we
have.
