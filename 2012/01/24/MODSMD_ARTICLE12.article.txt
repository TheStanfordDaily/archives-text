## THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION Zero and one 
### Nina Chung 
Last Wednesday, I attended
the first week's meeting of
my history class discussion
section. We started our 50 minutes
with an innocent icebreaker, in
which every student went up to
the chalkboard, said their name
and then wrote it down where
their birthplace might be if the
board were actually a map, albeit
blank and borderless. We were
supposed to reference where the
students before us had placed
their names and estimate where
our own belonged.
The point is, I was born in
Maryland. And I didn't know
where that would be relative to
Connecticut. Yeah. Well, now I
know. But also, 15 other students I
don 'fknow now know that I didn't
know. Of course, now you, the one
reading this column, know as well.
Alright... we're all on the same
page.

I'm sure that most everyone
found it pretty shameful. (Though
a laugh may have gurgled its way
out of me, to a quiet classroom
and a TA murmuring southwest)
As I sat down, I knew immediate
ly that this five-second event had
the potential to put me in conver
sational history, particularly
under that ever-entertaining sub
ject entitled, "The stupidest thing
I've ever heard." We all love that
one. I used to tell a story about a
boy in high school who tried con
firming that London was in Paris.
(Notice purposeful past tense,
please!) My cheap reward was an
astonished, briefly captivated au
dience and someone else's follow
up story about yet another aston
ishingly dim person. "It's crazy!
These people do exist!" I've said
hundreds of times. Me, on the
other hand I could argue the
definition of "race" versus "eth
nicity," knew what "social justice"
actually means and had experi
enced intellectual highs after two
hour class discussions. And the
thing is, I'm sure you have, too. If
you are a student here, I'm almost
positive I could have had this con
versation with you, too. Jokes
about others' stupidity seemed
sufficiently distant in the academ
ic context of this campus . . .
though now it's almost mortifying
for me to say so.

Contrast last week to the first
long break I returned back home
from college, when I met some
friends with whom I spent a lot of
time in high school. There, unex
pectedly, it was the "intellectual"
label that seemed too closely plas
tered to everything I said. I felt a

deep, distracting pressure to re
strain myself from debate, analy
sis, complications, bigger ques
tions words that suddenly car
ried less positive connotations in
casual conversations. I didn't want
to hail so obviously from a school
that, from home, seemed lofty and
pretentious. Is that what I was
then?

In both cases, a spotlight threw
a harsh light in my direction,
pointing out a spectrum of quali
ties I hadn't noticed in myself be
fore. Less culturally aware? More
snooty? Less smart? More inse
cure? All of them, simultaneous
ly? I realized that these words
have values that are contingent on
context, and our context changes
constantly. We don't live in novels
alongside character foils that ex
pose what we are and are not. And
we're no longer children learning
adjectives by their opposites.
After all, being a fish out of water
depends on the water; feeling out
of place depends on the place. It's
complex. We are all every mar and
mistake, to varying degrees, at dif
ferent times, in different places.
There's no point in summarizing
the flaws of others when the next
right setting will probably reveal
it in ourselves. (See: paragraph
two.)
I guess I'm growing more and
more suspect of my own binary
statements. I'm not sure if any
self-description of choice is a
trustworthy anchor at all. They're
all constructions of human peo
ple, and human beings don't ever
make things that last forever. Per
haps we are victims of our own at
tempts to self-determine, often at
the expense of others who we
imply are totally opposite. But it
doesn't matter an ounce: sooner
or later, we all find ourselves
falling off our pedestals to the
same humble grounds, anyway.
The tricky part then just seems to
be staying there. Or, at least for
me it is.

The bottom line is, Nina still has ex
treme U.S. geography issues. Maybe
you want to help her. Better yet,
make her day and respond to this
column. Until then, she'll be waiting
at ninamc@stanford.edu.
