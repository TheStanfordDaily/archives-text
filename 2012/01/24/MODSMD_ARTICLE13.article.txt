# I'M DONE WITH MY LIFE
## What if? What if I had stayed in the fall? 
### Camira Powell 
Since coming back to campus,
adjusting to the Stanford
lifestyle hasn't been always
been easy. I thought it would like
learning how to ride a bike again,
you know, it comes right back to
you just like that. However, what I
failed to remember is how difficult
it is for me especially to ride
a bike, and that it takes a little trial
and error before you get going
again. And of course, looking
around at everyone whizzing past
me and doing loops around the
Circle of Death, I had to believe it
was just me who was struggling to
just stay on a bike.
So I found myself beginning to
do something I hate something
I absolutely detest. I began won
dering, "What if?" And I'm not
talking about that super theoreti
cal, fantastical kind of "what if?"
(like, "What if I met Drake? Would
there be a song called Houstalanta
calil"). No. This kind of wondering
"what if?" has more to to do with
things not accomplished than
things wished for; it has to do with
regrets. For me, it started off with:
What if I had never left? What if I
had stayed in the fall? How would
things been different? Would I be
more actively involved in certain
organizations? Where would I live
on campus? Would I feel more or
less feel obligated to see certain
people? And from there it snow
balled — having me question my
entire Stanford career.
While I was having this kind of
existential crisis, I found myself
going on a trip down memory lane. It

started when I promised a friend
that we'd have a sleepover like the
good oP days of sophomore year.
However, my plans got sidetracked
a little when we ended up visiting an
other friend a homie since Admit
Weekend who happens to live in
the same dorm. Although we had in
tended to only stop by and catch up
for a few minutes, we spent the rest
of the night recapping our lives.
At times, I had wondered if our
friendship with each other was just
a result of the fact that we had lived
in closed proximity during the very
formative freshman year.
One thing that you notice when
you return to somewhere you have
left is what or who you care
about. Everything is put into per
spective. I find myself making
more of an effort to see certain
people or do certain things. Yet
other things, like going to Green,
don't seem worth the effort. It's
hard to admit that there are people
that you don't care if you see be
cause it makes you sound kind of
mean, but it's just being honest.
You start to think how many con
nections are arbitrary versus the
ones that are fated to happen.
Maybe it was the free-flowing
juice or the all-you-can-eat fruit
snacks, but at some point during
the conversation, it hit me. I really
like these people. As our talk con
tinued, it felt like it was old times
again. The ease and familiarity I
have with these people can't be
faked. Even though I don't see
them all the time, and I sometimes
wonder if any of it mattered or

made some kind of difference,
when I'm surrounded by them, I
can't help but think that I was
placed there for a reason.
There are people ready, willing
and waiting to reach out to me, and
all I have to do is reach out to them
in return. And that's a wonderful
thing to know, because it's easy to
forget that and get jaded. The con
nections that I make now are
worth the effort of cultivating be
cause they are not ones that I want
to ever see disappear. Though I
have to be willing to keep working
at it if I want to keep what I have.
The fact that I can look back
upon so many experiences with a
smile on my face shows that I've
made some pretty good decisions. I
know I that I'll never stop wonder
ing "what if?" a girl's gotta keep
dreaming that she'll get a hit song
made about her but I realize
that there are some things that I
won't ever wonder about.

While I was having this kind of
existential crisis, I found myself
going on a trip down memory lane. It

started when I promised a friend
that we'd have a sleepover like the
good oP days of sophomore year.
However, my plans got sidetracked
a little when we ended up visiting an
other friend a homie since Admit
Weekend who happens to live in
the same dorm. Although we had in
tended to only stop by and catch up
for a few minutes, we spent the rest
of the night recapping our lives.
At times, I had wondered if our
friendship with each other was just
a result of the fact that we had lived
in closed proximity during the very
formative freshman year.
One thing that you notice when
you return to somewhere you have
left is what or who you care
about. Everything is put into per
spective. I find myself making
more of an effort to see certain
people or do certain things. Yet
other things, like going to Green,
don't seem worth the effort. It's
hard to admit that there are people
that you don't care if you see be
cause it makes you sound kind of
mean, but it's just being honest.
You start to think how many con
nections are arbitrary versus the
ones that are fated to happen.
Maybe it was the free-flowing
juice or the all-you-can-eat fruit
snacks, but at some point during
the conversation, it hit me. I really
like these people. As our talk con
tinued, it felt like it was old times
again. The ease and familiarity I
have with these people can't be
faked. Even though I don't see
them all the time, and I sometimes
wonder if any of it mattered or

made some kind of difference,
when I'm surrounded by them, I
can't help but think that I was
placed there for a reason.
There are people ready, willing
and waiting to reach out to me, and
all I have to do is reach out to them
in return. And that's a wonderful
thing to know, because it's easy to
forget that and get jaded. The con
nections that I make now are
worth the effort of cultivating be
cause they are not ones that I want
to ever see disappear. Though I
have to be willing to keep working
at it if I want to keep what I have.
The fact that I can look back
upon so many experiences with a
smile on my face shows that I've
made some pretty good decisions. I
know I that I'll never stop wonder
ing "what if?" a girl's gotta keep
dreaming that she'll get a hit song
made about her but I realize
that there are some things that I
won't ever wonder about.
