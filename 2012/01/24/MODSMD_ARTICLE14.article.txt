on to win 3-0. Against Southern

Patrick's match was particularly exciting.
He faced an early 2-1 deficit but was able to
fight back and take a 4-2 lead going into the

third period. Although he did give up an es
cape in the third, his neutral defense was ex
cellent, and he secured a 4-3 decision.
Patrick has now won five straight matches, a
season high, and is 14-9 overall (10-3 in
duals). He has been wrestling extremely
well lately from all positions top, bottom
and neutral.

Stanford's two ranked wrestlers
Amuchastegui and Mango continued
their successful seasons with great weekends.
Amuchastegui did not wrestle against San
Francisco State, but he wrestled a flawless
match against Southern Oregon. The redshirt

points, an escape and a point for riding time.
There were no points in the match in which
he wasn't dominating. Amuchastegui is now

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
The Stanford wrestling team won two matches in impressive fashion over the weekend. The Cardinal lost just three individual matches all weekend,
beating San Francisco State 25-12 and blowing out Southern Utah 25-3. Stanford has now won three straight and four of its last five.
has 109 wins, the fifth-most in pro
gram history.
Mango won two close matches
and showed his opponents how
scary he is on his feet. In his
match against Julian Perez of San
Francisco State, Mango secured a
takedown in the final period to
break a scoreless tie, and he went
on to win 3-0. Against Southern
Oregon he took down his oppo

nent, Mitchell Lofstedt, four
times and won 13-6. Mango has a
team-high 22 wins and is an un
defeated 13-0 in duals.

All weekend long, Stanford
was able to get takedowns from
neutral in key situations, ride
tough on top and put together
multiple moves from bottom.
The team has improved greatly
in its ability to put together a
complete match, wrestling well
from start to finish in all facets.
The Cardinal has momentum
on its side, as the team has won
three straight and four out of
five. Its only loss in that span was

a one-point heartbreaker to top
-25 American. But Stanford has to
make sure not to get complacent.
There are four duals and a tour
nament left before the Pac-12
Championships in late February.
The team needs to wrestle well in
the two remaining Pac-12 duals
to ensure good seeding in that
tournament.

This Sunday, Stanford hits the
mat for a huge Pac-12 match
against Oregon State at 2 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
