# GYMNASTS WIN IN STYLE
## 
### CONNOR SCHERER 
Coming off a victory in the
NorCal Quad Meet, the Stanford
women's gymnastics team con
tinued its success by beating the
Washington Huskies in its sec
ond meet of the season. Howev
er, unlike last week, this victory
was not so comfortable.
While the Cardinal never
trailed in last week's meet and
had a relatively easy time putting
away its three opponents, Sun
day's meet was a nail-biter to the
very end, which makes it all the
more gratifying. The Cardinal,
despite trailing early in the meet,
ultimately pulled out a 195.925-
195.725 victory over its in-con
ference opponents to keep its
perfect record intact.
Starting on the vault, the Car
dinal was led by junior Ashley
Morgan's 9.850 score and fresh
man Ivana Hong's 9.800. Hong,
coming off an ankle injury that
kept her from competing in last
week's match, was making her
collegiate debut on Sunday, but
is certainly no stranger to pres
sure.

A member of the 2009 U.S.
team that won a gold medal at
the World Championships, Hong
earned a bronze medal on the
beam in the event. Though she
competed in just the vault on
Sunday, she is expected to partic
ipate in more events as the sea
son continues and her ankle im
proves.

Through the first event, the
Cardinal trailed by 0.300 points,
as the Huskies put up a very
strong performance on the bars
with a 49.050 team score. Com
peting on the bars, Stanford

looked to narrow the deficit as
the Huskies took to the vault.

Stanford posted its best score
on the bars, thanks to freshmen
Rebecca Wing (9.900) and Sam
Shapiro (9.850), as well as senior
Nicole Pechanec (9.850). Wing,
who made her collegiate debut
last week, has also had her fair
share of pressure situations, as
she competed for Great Britain
in the 2008 Olympics. She was
the team's first competitor in the
bars, as well as on the beam and
floor in the later rounds, a re
sponsibility designated generally
for the more consistent perform
ers, but one that does not faze
her.

"It's definitely an honor to
have the leadoff position, espe
cially as a freshman," Wing said.
"It's always been my favorite po
sition though, and it's where I
feel most comfortable." Her
9.900 score was tied for the team
high on the afternoon and
helped cut Washington's lead to
just 0.175 as the third round
began.

Wing also excelled on the
beam, earning a 9.875 to improve
her score by 0.300 from last
week. Morgan's 9.900 led the
team in the event, as they put to
gether a team score 0f49.100 and
took a 147.000-146.975 lead
going into the fourth event.
Morgan and Pechanec helped
the Cardinal seal its victory in its
final event as the team scored a
combined 48.925. Morgan's
9.900 (her second 9.900 on the
floor in as many weeks) gave her
a score of 9.850 or above in three
of the four events she competed

Senior Alyssa Brown anchored the Stanford women's gymnastics team
on the beam and scored a crucial 9.700 to help the Cardinal come back
from an early deficit to defeat Washington by 0.2 to remain perfect.
