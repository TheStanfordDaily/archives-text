# Billionaire owners come with a price
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Every soccer fan dreams of
the day his or her club gets
taken over by a billion
aire; that instant transfor
mation from financial
also-ran to filthily rich global force.
The very best players in the world
demand salaries that are far out of
the reach of all but a tiny handful of
soccer teams, or even of sensibly
wealthy owners, so the only way to
compete for their signatures is to
have more money than sense a
lot more.

Take, for example, Manchester
City. A club that barely a few years
ago was no more than an average
Premier League team, and 12 years
back wasn't even in the top flight of
English soccer. Four years ago,
though, it was bought by Sheikh
Mansour bin Zayed A1 Nahyan, a
member of the Abu Dhabi royal
family, and since then he has lav
ished hundreds of millions of dollars
on player transfers. Fie has even
bought players when there is no
space for them in the squad, simply
because he can.

The Man City experiment seems
to be bearing some fruit the team
currently sits on top of the Premier
League but life is rarely that per
fect, and if there is one thing soccer
fans fear more than anything else,
ironically, it is probably their club
getting taken over by a billionaire.
Even if they grew up in the real
world, most of the incredibly rich
aren't used to not having things
their own way, or to admitting fail
ure. The soccer world, though, is a
tougher place to be, and it often
doesn't play by the usual rules of
business. The best-laid plans easily
go awry, the best team doesn't al
ways win and money doesn't guar
antee success. But more than all
that, they aren't playing with mere
toy companies here, but with the
lives and loves of thousands
maybe millions of fans.
Far too often, these tycoons get it
wrong, very wrong sacking expe
rienced staff, renaming iconic stadi
ums and buying a host of prima
donna players and a few years
into their ownership, when they are
still hemorrhaging money into a
struggling team, their patience
quickly runs dry. Some take disas
trous personal responsibility, sack
ing more people and making further
ill-advised player transfers, some
make the cold, hard business deci
sion to drop the club like a brick. Ei
ther way recent English soccer his
tory is littered with the carcasses of
failed or failing teams.

The Asia Football Investments
consortium bought Leicester City
two years ago, renamed the home
ground the King Power Stadium
and brought in ex-England manag
er Sven-Goran Eriksson. The team
was a preseason favorite for promo
tion, but since then Eriksson has left,
and it lies in 15th place in the second
tier of English football. Another ex
ample is Liverpool: in the 2006-07
season, American businessmen
George Gillett and Tom Hicks
bought the club, and, after their dis
astrous leadership took it to the
brink of bankruptcy, its creditors
forced a sale in 2010.
Some of the fear comes down to
the nationality of these billionaire
playboys. Partly this may be a xeno
phobic view of the increasing
amount of foreign ownership in
English football, but there are defi
nitely different categories of for
eignness. The most sought-after are
probably Arab sheikhs, with their
seemingly bottomless pots of
money, and next to those maybe
Russian oil tycoons, since they have
almost as deep pockets, but can't
seem to shake the image of corrup
tion and criminality. And the least
desirable, I have to admit, are often
Americans. Old stereotypes die
hard, and we struggle to really be
lieve you understand or care
enough about soccer to be trusted.
And finally it seems this
dream/nightmare scenario has
come to my club, Reading FC. Last
week a mysterious group called
Thames Sport Investment surfaced
with plans of investing. Worryingly,
this organization seems to fail the
basic modern test of legitimacy: hav
ing a website, or at least a few in
formative hits on Google. It seems,
though, that a 29-year-old Russian
tycoon, Anton Zingarevich, is be
hind this deal. On the upside, he ap
parently has links to the area as he
went to school near Reading, and
the current owner, John Madejski, is
reportedly going to retain a signifi
cant share and influence at the club.
Plus, money will also offer the
chance to strengthen the team and
push for promotion.
On the downside, though, hav
ing been under the same manage

ment for 21 years, this is a leap into
the unknown. Big decisions are
being made that will determine the
future of my club, and unfortunate
ly I don't have the sufficient billions
to get a place at the table.

Tom Taylor has one teeny, tiny re
quest for all you loyal readers. All
he wants are a few billion dollars to
buy his favorite team. Show your
support with a little dough at
torn. taylor@stanford. edu.
