## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
After spending two years on
loan at the North Carolina Muse
um of Art, a cast of Auguste
Rodin's "The Thinker" is back at
Stanford, according to a Cantor
Arts Center press release. The
one-ton, 79-inch tall sculpture
will be made available for public
viewing at the museum starting
this Wednesday.

Art collector B. Gerald Can
tor gave Stanford the sculpture
back in 1988 as a promised gift,
which means it is still technically
owned by the Iris and B. Gerald
Cantor Foundation, but is prom
ised to become the property of
the University in the future. The
sculpture, one of 12 casts author
ized by the Musee Rodin in
Paris, will return to the Cantor
Arts Center's Susan and John
Diekman Gallery its home
since 2006. Previously, the cast

could be seen in front of Meyer
Library.
"The Thinker" was first con
ceived as a figure at the top of a
larger work called "The Gates of
Hell," which was sculpted by
Rodin around 1880 and depicts a
scene from Dante's "The Infer
no."This figure, alternately called
"The Poet" or "The Poet-
Thinker," was originally intended
to represent Dante himself.
Today, however, "The
Thinker" has become an iconic
representation of intellect, phi
losophy and mediation.
A cast of "The Gates of Hell"
can also been seen at the Cantor
Arts Center, along with a collec
tion of around 200 other Rodin
sculptures.
This is not the first time that
"The Thinker" has left the Farm.
The sculpture also returned to
the campus in 2002 after a year
long tour of Australia and Singa
pore.
The Cantor Arts Center is
open to visitors 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
from Wednesday to Friday and
until 8:00 p.m. on Thursdays. Ad
mission is free.
