# WOMEN'S GOLF
## Cardinal hopes improvements are enough in rugged Pac-12 
### AUSTIN BLOCK 
It didn't take long for freshman golfer
Mariko Tumangan to make her presence
felt on the Stanford women's golf team. On
Oct. 28, barely a month into her college ca
reer, she shot a women's course record 63
on the Stanford course. It was two shots bet
ter than the previous record, which had
been set six years earlier by Duke golfer Liz
Janangelo now a professional on the
LPGA Futures Tour.

Led by Tumangan, the lone freshman,
and junior captains Sally Watson and Krish
na Wong, the team should be stronger than
it was last year. In the fall, the Cardinal took
third in the Rainbow Wahine Invitational
and finished second in the Cougar Cup.
Watson won the individual title at the
Cougar Cup, sinking a 40-foot putt on the
last hole to clinch first place. However, the
team did not perform well in its other two
fall tournaments.

But although the team seems to have im
proved, the Cardinal's results in major tour
naments may not fully reflect that improve
ment.The Pac-12 Conference is perhaps the
most competitive in the country, with three
teams ranked in the top 10 in the nation and
eight in the top 20 Stanford is currently
No. 42. Among those top teams are No. 4
USC and top-ranked, defending national
champion UCLA, which won the Rainbow
Wahine Invitational by 20 shots and is led by

two of the top six players in the nation.
"We're in a conference that I would say
is absolutely the strongest in the country.
The SEC is sometimes there to rival us, but
[the Pac-12 is] a tough conference," said
head coach Caroline O'Connor. "We have
to be on our games every single day, every
single event when we get out there ... We
haven't been to an event yet where we
haven't seen a bunch of top-10 programs."

Last season, the Cardinal tied for fifth in
the Pac-10 Championships and finished sev
enth in the NCAA Regional Tournament
before stumbling in the national tourna
ment.

"There were flashes of brilliance we
were tied for the lead after one round of the
Pac-10 Championship, and I think at the
time there were six teams ranked in the top
10, not including Stanford," O'Connor said.
"We went in, and we shot six under in the
first round, and we were leading, and we
were I think two or three strokes back going
into the final round and didn't play great in
the final round of the conference champi
onship. [We] sort of played OK to get out of
regionals, finishing seventh ... and then
just didn't play great at nationals."
"I think that we learned a lot," she con
tinued. "Now we'll have more experience
we'll know what it feels like again to be
there, and I think that those lessons will
serve us well come this spring."
Last year marked the Cardinal's second

straight trip to nationals after a two-year
hiatus. Prior to that period, the team had
made the national championship for 12
straight years.

In preparation for their first tournament,
the Arizona Wildcat Challenge in early Feb
ruary, team members have been playing
qualifying rounds to simulate the pressure
of competitive golf and to determine the
order in which members of the team will be
seeded.

Five players will represent Stanford in
the tournament, and a sixth player will play
individually. Sophomore Marissa Mar, Wat
son and O'Connor agreed that this type of
competitive practice is important, especial
ly since the team has not played in a tourna
ment since early November.
"I think qualifying definitely brings a
sense that every shot counts, every mental
process counts toward your shot as well.
Making the most of each shot is a main goal
for preparing ourselves mentally for the
tournament," Mar said.

Following the Wildcat Challenge, the
Cardinal will play at home in the Peg
Barnard Invitational before heading to Los
Angeles to play in the Bruin Wave Invita
tional on March 5 and 6. The Pac-12 Cham
pionship begins on April 27, and NCAA re
gional play begins on May 10. If the Cardi
nal finishes in the top 8 in the 24-team re
gional tournament, it will advance to the 24-
team national tournament in Tennessee in

late May.
Watson said that the team has difficulty
under pressure. To remedy this weakness,
players work with a golf psychologist and
with the coaches and imitate pressurized sit
uations in practice.

"I think everyone has the skill and the
ability to compete with the best in the coun
try, it's just a matter of building up our con
fidence as a team, building up our confi
dence as individuals and going to tourna
ments with the right attitude to allow our
selves to perform," she said.
O'Connor was optimistic that the team
could capitalize this year on what she be
lieves characterized as an ample helping of
potential.

"We've got some really, really talented
players," she said. "[Sally Watson has] had a
win this year. Krishna [Wong] finished off
the fall with, I think, a fourth-place finish
down in Hawaii. Krishna had a run last year
where, for six months, she didn't finish out of
the top seven, so if we can get those two
playing to where we know they can play and
where they have played in addition to [get
ting] Mariko Tumangan, our freshman,
playing where we know she should be play
ing then I think that we're competing with
all of those schools.
"There's not a doubt in my mind."
