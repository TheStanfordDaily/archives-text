# SIEPR talks conflict of interest policy
## Critics of a recent study question SIEPR's corporate sponsorship

Critics of a study published last
December by the Stanford Insti
tute for Economic Policy Re
search (SIEPR) which con
cluded that the state of California
has underfunded pensions for
government employees anywhere
between $142.6 billion and $498
billion have recently ques
tioned the academic integrity of
SIEPR, accusing the nonpartisan

economic research organization
of being partial to corporate spon
sors.
In a joint email to The Daily,
SIEPR Director John Shoven and
Deputy Director Greg Rosston
reaffirmed that SIEPR's research
is not influenced by its corporate
support, which made up approxi
mately 8 percent of the organiza

academic year.
"When we talk with donors, we

emphasize faculty independence
we always tell donors that we
not only can't tell faculty what
conclusions to come to, we can't
even tell faculty what projects to
work on," Shoven and Rosston
wrote. "We care very much about
academic independence."
Debate over public pensions re
search
A Dec. 13 SIEPR report, au

Joe Nation and titled "Pension
Math: How California's Retire

State Budget," examined the state
of three of California's public em
ployee pension systems: the Cali
fornia Public Employees' Retire
ment System (CaIPERS), Califor
nia State Teachers' Retirement
System (CaISTRS) and the Uni
versity of California Retirement
Plan (UCRP).
The study concluded that debt

on public pensions was larger than
the state is currently reporting, un
derfunded by anywhere from $498
billion, using a 4.5 percent "risk
free" rate, to $142.6 billion, using a
7.5 to 7.75 percent rate.
California Treasurer Bill Lock

on a SIEPR pension advisory
panel, but resigned from his posi
