# SIEPR talks conflict of interest policy
## Critics of a recent study question SIEPR's corporate sponsorship 
### JAMIE KIM 
Critics of a study published last
December by the Stanford Insti
tute for Economic Policy Re
search (SIEPR) which con
cluded that the state of California
has underfunded pensions for
government employees anywhere
between $142.6 billion and $498
billion have recently ques
tioned the academic integrity of
SIEPR, accusing the nonpartisan

economic research organization
of being partial to corporate spon
sors.
In a joint email to The Daily,
SIEPR Director John Shoven and
Deputy Director Greg Rosston
reaffirmed that SIEPR's research
is not influenced by its corporate
support, which made up approxi
mately 8 percent of the organiza
tion's income during the 2009-10
academic year.
"When we talk with donors, we

emphasize faculty independence
we always tell donors that we
not only can't tell faculty what
conclusions to come to, we can't
even tell faculty what projects to
work on," Shoven and Rosston
wrote. "We care very much about
academic independence."
Debate over public pensions re
search
A Dec. 13 SIEPR report, au
thored by public policy professor

Joe Nation and titled "Pension
Math: How California's Retire
ment Spending is Squeezing the
State Budget," examined the state
of three of California's public em
ployee pension systems: the Cali
fornia Public Employees' Retire
ment System (CaIPERS), Califor
nia State Teachers' Retirement
System (CaISTRS) and the Uni
versity of California Retirement
Plan (UCRP).
The study concluded that debt

on public pensions was larger than
the state is currently reporting, un
derfunded by anywhere from $498
billion, using a 4.5 percent "risk
free" rate, to $142.6 billion, using a
7.5 to 7.75 percent rate.
California Treasurer Bill Lock
yer had previously agreed to serve
on a SIEPR pension advisory
panel, but resigned from his posi
tion on the panel in protest of last
month's report, which called for
reducing the benefits of current
state workers and reforming the
public pension system in Califor
nia.

While attempting to discredit
the study in an op-ed than ran in
the Sacramento Bee on Dec. 25,
Lockyer called SIEPR a "Wall
Street-supported think tank." In
particular, Lockyer wrote that he
believed the study may have been
influenced by corporate sponsors
who "make a lot of money when
workers invest in 401(k)s."
Nation, the study's author, ad
dressed Lockyer's original com
plaints against the research and
decision to resign in a Dec, 16 op
ed in the Sacramento Bee.

"The advisory panel members
who resigned seem fixated on just
one issue, insisting that we pres
ent the numbers assuming only a
long-term investment return of
7.75 percent," Nation wrote. "No
tably, even at that rate, all three
pension systems remain substan
tially underfunded."
David Crane, a Stanford public
policy lecturer, would later come

to the study's defense. In a Jan. 8
op-ed in the Bee, Crane wrote that
the California financial officials
opposed to the report were mak
ing "ad hominem responses."
According to Shoven and
Rosston, Nation's report is a "per
fect example" of research not in
fluenced by corporate sponsors.
"The report expresses his re
search and opinions, not
SIEPR's," Shoven and Rosston
wrote, "And it was funded directly
as a research project through
SIEPR by the James Irvine Foun
dation and California Forward."
Dean of Research Ann Arvin
and Stanford's Sponsored Proj
ects Office also approved the
sponsored project, Shoven and
Rosston added.
They noted that all faculty
must abide by both codes of con
duct written by the University
and the dean and research.
How SIEPR is funded
According to its 2009-10 annu
al report, corporate support ac
counted for 8.6 percent of
SIEPR's approximately $13.5
million in income that academic
year.

Of the money raised from cor
porate sponsorship that year,
$806,954 was dedicated to "pro
ject support" while $356,000 went

toward "general support." Corpo
rations that donated $20,000 or
more included Exxon Mobil,
Cisco Systems and Charles R.
Schwab. Bank of the West, Gold
man Sachs, Google, JPMorgan
and Wells Fargo each contributed
between $lO,OOO and $20,000.

The rest of SIEPR's income
comes from (in decreasing order)
foundations, the U.S. govern
ment, endowment, individual
donors and University support.
Foundations such as the William
and Flora Hewlett Foundation,
the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation,
the Ewing Marion Kauffman
Foundation and the Koret Foun
dation make up around 25 per
cent of SIEPR's income. Grants
from government agencies like
the National Science Foundation
and National Institutes of Health
are the second-largest compo
nent, making up 18 percent of
SIEPR's income.
17 percent then comes from
endowment, 13 percent from indi
vidual donors and 13 from the
University.
According to Shoven and
Rosston, "no corporate support
paid for our new building," refer
ring to the John A. and Cynthia
Fry Gunn Building, which was
dedicated in March of 2010.

A majority of SIEPR's 2009-

2010 expenditures was devoted to
research, supporting faculty and
graduate students and funding
conferences. Ten-percent of the
budget over $1 million was
committed to running Stanford's
public policy program, and the
rest was expended on develop
ment, communications and ad
ministration

The SIEPR advisory board
SIEPR's advisory board
defined on its website as a "board
of directors for the Institute" that
"helps to guide and support
SIEPR" includes 49 members,
some with links to business
world, such as Eff Martin, adviso
ry director of Goldman Sachs;
Susan Bostrom, senior vice presi
dent and chief marketing officer
at Cisco Systems; and John Gunn,
who chairs the advisory board
and is chairman at Dodge & Cox.
Members of the advisory
board "make both an intellectual
and financial commitment" and
"are active in helping to facilitate
and disseminate research," ac
cording to SIEPR's website.
"SIEPR's Advisory Board is
just that an advisory board,"
Shoven and Rosston wrote. "It is
not a governing board. It does
have very impressive members
successful business people, aca

demies and policymakers who
provide guidance and fundraising
assistance"

"By bringing together academ
ics, policymakers and business
people," they added, "SIEPR can
have a positive influence on the
policy process."
The mixture of academics, pol
icymakers and business people,
they said, creates a "positive influ
ence on the policy process."

The University stance
In an email to The Daily, Uni
versity spokesperson Lisa Lapin
wrote that corporate contribu
tions, which are received by enti
ties throughout the University,
"represent a very small percent
age of overall giving to Stanford
(less than 10 percent)."

She added that Stanford has
strong policies that serve to pre
vent instances of conflict of inter
est across all fields of the Univer
sity, not just SIEPR.

"Stanford has some of the most
thorough and complete conflict of
interest policies and practices
among U.S. universities," Lapin
wrote. She said these "thoroughly
address inferences about corpo
rate giving [being questions]."

December by the Stanford Insti
tute for Economic Policy Re
search (SIEPR) which con
cluded that the state of California
has underfunded pensions for
government employees anywhere
between $142.6 billion and $498
billion have recently ques
tioned the academic integrity of
SIEPR, accusing the nonpartisan

economic research organization
of being partial to corporate spon
sors.
In a joint email to The Daily,
SIEPR Director John Shoven and
Deputy Director Greg Rosston
reaffirmed that SIEPR's research
is not influenced by its corporate
support, which made up approxi
mately 8 percent of the organiza
tion's income during the 2009-10
academic year.
"When we talk with donors, we

emphasize faculty independence
we always tell donors that we
not only can't tell faculty what
conclusions to come to, we can't
even tell faculty what projects to
work on," Shoven and Rosston
wrote. "We care very much about
academic independence."
Debate over public pensions re
search
A Dec. 13 SIEPR report, au
thored by public policy professor

Joe Nation and titled "Pension
Math: How California's Retire
ment Spending is Squeezing the
State Budget," examined the state
of three of California's public em
ployee pension systems: the Cali
fornia Public Employees' Retire
ment System (CaIPERS), Califor
nia State Teachers' Retirement
System (CaISTRS) and the Uni
versity of California Retirement
Plan (UCRP).
The study concluded that debt

on public pensions was larger than
the state is currently reporting, un
derfunded by anywhere from $498
billion, using a 4.5 percent "risk
free" rate, to $142.6 billion, using a
7.5 to 7.75 percent rate.
California Treasurer Bill Lock
yer had previously agreed to serve
on a SIEPR pension advisory
panel, but resigned from his posi
tion on the panel in protest of last
month's report, which called for
reducing the benefits of current
state workers and reforming the
public pension system in Califor
nia.

While attempting to discredit
the study in an op-ed than ran in
the Sacramento Bee on Dec. 25,
Lockyer called SIEPR a "Wall
Street-supported think tank." In
particular, Lockyer wrote that he
believed the study may have been
influenced by corporate sponsors
who "make a lot of money when
workers invest in 401(k)s."
Nation, the study's author, ad
dressed Lockyer's original com
plaints against the research and
decision to resign in a Dec, 16 op
ed in the Sacramento Bee.

"The advisory panel members
who resigned seem fixated on just
one issue, insisting that we pres
ent the numbers assuming only a
long-term investment return of
7.75 percent," Nation wrote. "No
tably, even at that rate, all three
pension systems remain substan
tially underfunded."
David Crane, a Stanford public
policy lecturer, would later come

to the study's defense. In a Jan. 8
op-ed in the Bee, Crane wrote that
the California financial officials
opposed to the report were mak
ing "ad hominem responses."
According to Shoven and
Rosston, Nation's report is a "per
fect example" of research not in
fluenced by corporate sponsors.
"The report expresses his re
search and opinions, not
SIEPR's," Shoven and Rosston
wrote, "And it was funded directly
as a research project through
SIEPR by the James Irvine Foun
dation and California Forward."
Dean of Research Ann Arvin
and Stanford's Sponsored Proj
ects Office also approved the
sponsored project, Shoven and
Rosston added.
They noted that all faculty
must abide by both codes of con
duct written by the University
and the dean and research.
How SIEPR is funded
According to its 2009-10 annu
al report, corporate support ac
counted for 8.6 percent of
SIEPR's approximately $13.5
million in income that academic
year.

Of the money raised from cor
porate sponsorship that year,
$806,954 was dedicated to "pro
ject support" while $356,000 went

toward "general support." Corpo
rations that donated $20,000 or
more included Exxon Mobil,
Cisco Systems and Charles R.
Schwab. Bank of the West, Gold
man Sachs, Google, JPMorgan
and Wells Fargo each contributed
between $lO,OOO and $20,000.

The rest of SIEPR's income
comes from (in decreasing order)
foundations, the U.S. govern
ment, endowment, individual
donors and University support.
Foundations such as the William
and Flora Hewlett Foundation,
the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation,
the Ewing Marion Kauffman
Foundation and the Koret Foun
dation make up around 25 per
cent of SIEPR's income. Grants
from government agencies like
the National Science Foundation
and National Institutes of Health
are the second-largest compo
nent, making up 18 percent of
SIEPR's income.
17 percent then comes from
endowment, 13 percent from indi
vidual donors and 13 from the
University.
According to Shoven and
Rosston, "no corporate support
paid for our new building," refer
ring to the John A. and Cynthia
Fry Gunn Building, which was
dedicated in March of 2010.

A majority of SIEPR's 2009-

2010 expenditures was devoted to
research, supporting faculty and
graduate students and funding
conferences. Ten-percent of the
budget over $1 million was
committed to running Stanford's
public policy program, and the
rest was expended on develop
ment, communications and ad
ministration

The SIEPR advisory board
SIEPR's advisory board
defined on its website as a "board
of directors for the Institute" that
"helps to guide and support
SIEPR" includes 49 members,
some with links to business
world, such as Eff Martin, adviso
ry director of Goldman Sachs;
Susan Bostrom, senior vice presi
dent and chief marketing officer
at Cisco Systems; and John Gunn,
who chairs the advisory board
and is chairman at Dodge & Cox.
Members of the advisory
board "make both an intellectual
and financial commitment" and
"are active in helping to facilitate
and disseminate research," ac
cording to SIEPR's website.
"SIEPR's Advisory Board is
just that an advisory board,"
Shoven and Rosston wrote. "It is
not a governing board. It does
have very impressive members
successful business people, aca

demies and policymakers who
provide guidance and fundraising
assistance"

"By bringing together academ
ics, policymakers and business
people," they added, "SIEPR can
have a positive influence on the
policy process."
The mixture of academics, pol
icymakers and business people,
they said, creates a "positive influ
ence on the policy process."

The University stance
In an email to The Daily, Uni
versity spokesperson Lisa Lapin
wrote that corporate contribu
tions, which are received by enti
ties throughout the University,
"represent a very small percent
age of overall giving to Stanford
(less than 10 percent)."

She added that Stanford has
strong policies that serve to pre
vent instances of conflict of inter
est across all fields of the Univer
sity, not just SIEPR.

"Stanford has some of the most
thorough and complete conflict of
interest policies and practices
among U.S. universities," Lapin
wrote. She said these "thoroughly
address inferences about corpo
rate giving [being questions]."
