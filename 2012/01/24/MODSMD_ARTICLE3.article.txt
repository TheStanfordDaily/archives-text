Artist Sandow Birk presented his Amer
ican Qur'an project as part of the Abbasi
Program in Islamic Studies event series
"We the People: Islam and U.S. Politics."
The project is Birk's attempt to hand-tran
scribe the entire Qur'an, illuminating the
text with scenes from contemporary Amer

tor of South Asian Art at the San Francisco
Asian Art Museum, and a Q&A session.
Throughout the event,Birk projected pages
of his work overhead.

Each page features chapters or parts of
chapters of the Our'an. in its 1861 J. M. Rod
well translation, set against scenes of con
temporary American life. The scenes in
cluded museum visitors at a dinosaur exhib
it, customers at a grocery store checkout
line and diners in a Chinese restaurant as
well as war images featuring American sol
diers.

The pages are in the standard size of an
cient Qur'an manuscripts. Birk said he also
used the border motifs and system of verse
numbering present in traditional Qur'ans.

Abbasi Program, listed Burk's illustrious
credentials, which include a Guggenheim
Fellowship in 1996, a Fulbright Fellowship
in 1997 and posts as artist in residence at the
