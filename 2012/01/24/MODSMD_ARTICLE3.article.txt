## Artist presents interpretive Qur'an project Traditional Qur'an illustrated with images from modem American life 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Artist Sandow Birk presented his Amer
ican Qur'an project as part of the Abbasi
Program in Islamic Studies event series
"We the People: Islam and U.S. Politics."
The project is Birk's attempt to hand-tran
scribe the entire Qur'an, illuminating the
text with scenes from contemporary Amer
ican life.

The event consisted of a presentation by
Birk on his influences, a discussion with
Qamar Adamjee, who is the associate cura
tor of South Asian Art at the San Francisco
Asian Art Museum, and a Q&A session.
Throughout the event,Birk projected pages
of his work overhead.

Each page features chapters or parts of
chapters of the Our'an. in its 1861 J. M. Rod
well translation, set against scenes of con
temporary American life. The scenes in
cluded museum visitors at a dinosaur exhib
it, customers at a grocery store checkout
line and diners in a Chinese restaurant as
well as war images featuring American sol
diers.

The pages are in the standard size of an
cient Qur'an manuscripts. Birk said he also
used the border motifs and system of verse
numbering present in traditional Qur'ans.
Vincent Barletta, interim director of the
Abbasi Program, listed Burk's illustrious
credentials, which include a Guggenheim
Fellowship in 1996, a Fulbright Fellowship
in 1997 and posts as artist in residence at the
Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C.,
and at the Cit Internationale des Arts in
Paris in 2008.

Burk, however, introduced himself as a
"mere painter."
He continued to describe his
upbringing, education and dedica
tion to surfing, mentioning his
early work depicting the 1992 Los
Angeles riots and a fictional war
between San Francisco and Los
Angeles.
His first step toward the Amer
ican Qur'an project came when he
stumbled upon a used copy of
Dante's "Divine Comedy" in a
bookstore, and embarked on five
year project to illustrate and
rewrite the entire work into con
temporary American slang.
"I became interested in the idea
of text and imagery, and that the
pictures weren't really illustration,
but sort of commentary on a text
the opposite of what illustra
tions are," Birk said.
After creating a series of etch
ings on the Iraq war, Birk became
aware that the image of Islam in
America differed from what he
had experienced on his surfing
travels to Islamic regions of the
world.
He picked up a paperback copy
of the Qur'an and began entertain
ing the idea of creating an illumi
nated manuscript version of the
ancient Islamic text.

"1... intentionally went about
this project with a false naivet," he
said. "I said to myself, 'Let's just

forget everything I know or have
been told about the Qur'an and
take it at face value."'

"I read the verses and I think,
'What is there in my life as an
American, as a Californian, that is
metaphorical to this or that is con
nected to it somehow?'" he said. "I
start by transcribing the words and
building the framework, and over
the course of a number of days
pondering the words of the chap
ter I've read."

He presented a few of his pages,
commenting on the connections
he made between text and image.
To accompany a passage about
the Prophet Mohammed's role as
a messenger to the world, Birk
chose to depict a printing press
showing modern day communica
tion. To accompany a passage
mentioning the Virgin Mary, Birk
drew a corner store from his His
panic Los Angeles neighborhood
where the Virgin Mary is painted
on the side of the store. Passages
on the flood of Noah were accom
panied by images of Hurricane
Katrina.

"It's hard to comprehend de
struction of that scale," Birk said of
the catastrophes in both the Qur'an
and the Bible. "But then you think I
do remember what it's like when a
whole city is wiped out by flood."
He explained his approach of
juxtaposing the sacred text against
scenes of daily life, describing his in
tended audience as average Amer
icans who "might not necessarily
know anything about the Qur'an."

"So often your brain is thinking
about these enormous beyond
worldly things," he said. "You're
thinking about life, you're thinking
about life after life; but as your
brain is thinking these things you're
standing in line at the ATM ma
chine."

Birk plans to complete all 220
pages and compile them in a book,
as well as hold exhibitions of all
the works in the next 18 months.

The artwork prompted mixed
responses from the audience, with
some members taking offense of
the perceived insensitivity to
wards the sacred text. Audience
members also questioned the as
sociation of violence with the
Qur'an in a response to the war
images accompanying some of the
text. Several audience members
said they were "disturbed" by the
pieces.

Others, however, insisted that the
project brought the Qur'an to Amer
icans in an accessible manner.
Birk repeatedly emphasized his
role as an artist and not a religious
scholar.
"The images aren't meant to be
didactic," he said. "They're not
meant to tell you anything. They're
meant to be my own ponderings."
"The images aren't illustrations
of the text they're not pictures of
what the text says. They're
metaphors for what could possibly
be suggested by the text," he contin
ued.
He also touched on the poten
tial cross-cultural understanding
his project could spark.
"My happiness and wonder at
the Qur'an since I've started read
ing it is it's just so familiar," Birk
said. "Coming from a Western
Christian culture, it's the same sto

ries...lt's Adam and Eve, it's Noah's
Ark ... It's such a familiar mes
sage. It's so astonishing to me the
clash between the two cultures."
A member of the audience
Qamar Adamjee closed the talk
commenting on the role of art.
"One of the things that artworks
do is create questions, force us to
look along at things that are taken
for granted that are often taken
over by a mainstream dialogue,"
Adamjee said. "That's what keeps
us active and keeps us engaged...

We need this type of artwork to
generate conversation to generate
dialogue; we need these types of
jolts to our system every so often."
The event was co-sponsored by
the Stanford Humanities Center
and the Cantor Arts Center.
