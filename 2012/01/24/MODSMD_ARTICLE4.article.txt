the Levinthal Fellows program in creative

in 1952.
Levinthal moved on to become a
founding employee at Varian Associates,
and would eventually become the director
of the company. Under his guidance, Vari
ance helped commercialize nuclear reso
nance, allowing it to be used as a tool in
chemistry and biochemistry.
In 1953 Levinthal founded Levinthal
Electronics Products, which went on to
produce some of the earliest pacemakers
and cardiac monitors.
Early in 1960 Levinthal joined
Stanford Medical School and be
came involved in the search for ex
traterrestrial life, joined several
NASA committees and helped in
terpret photos from the Mariner 9
Mars Orbiter mission.
Levinthal also served as the di
rector for the Defense Sciences
Office for the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency
(DARPA).
After returning to Stanford
from DARPA, Levinthal went on
to become the director of the Stan
ford Institute for Manufacturing
and Automation (SIMA), and
later the associate dean of research
at the School of Engineering.

In addition to his involvement
at Stanford, Levinthal helped start
the first venture capital fund in Sil
icon Valley. He was an avid trav
eller, reaching all seven continents
in his lifetime; he also initiated
projects to help low-income stu
dents reach their goal of attending
Stanford.
In addition to a dedicated to
science, Levinthal was known to
have a soft spot in his heart for the
humanities. Levinthal founded the
