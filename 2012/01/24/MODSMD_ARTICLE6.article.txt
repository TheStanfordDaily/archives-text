## PA City Council debates AT&T antennas 
### SARAH MOORE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At last night's Palo Alto City Council
meeting, council members held a public
hearing to decide whether to approve or re
ject AT&T's plans to install 20 new antennas
on city utility poles after four residents had
filed appeals against the plans.
Curtis Williams, the city's director of
planning, had previously approved AT&T's
proposal during the summer of 2011, but
backlash from residents inhibited plans
from continuing until the hearing.
The hearing featured inquiries from
council members as well as statements
from Palo Alto's director of planning, the
four appellants, the general public, represen
tatives of the Architectural Review Board
(ARB) and AT&T.
"We all want better coverage, but I filed
my appeal because I thought our city had
some right to self-determination and the
right to consider alternate technologies,"
said appellant Paula Rantz. "Our power to
determine the character of our community
has been taken away by state and federal
limitations."

The ARB worked with city and AT&T to
ensure the antennas and related equipment
were aesthetically acceptable.
"We wish the [wireless] service to be al
lowed to come to the community," said ARB
representative Heather Young. "Service, es
pecially in times of emergency, is a very im
portant issue and our hope was to make rec
ommendations that would allow the equip
ment to have as little intrusion on the envi
ronment as possible."
Thirty letters and emails sent to the city,
either in favor or opposition to AT&T's
plans, were presented for the public to read
at the hearing. Twenty-four of the docu
ments supported the plans while six object
ed to them. All letters and emails had been
sent within the past week.
A noise report by Hammett & Edison,

Inc., consulting engineers, was also available
for review. Palo Alto limits "increases in
noise levels originating from property" in
residential zones to six dBA, and the study
found than noise increases from AT&T's
distributed antenna system nodes by 3.3
dBA.
Most emails in support of the new an
tennas cited the need for improved wireless
service and coverage, calling it embarrass
ing that they have so many dropped calls in
this hub of the Silicon Valley. Those oppos
ing the antennas referenced inappropriate
placement, noise pollution, radiation, costs
and the preference for a citywide compre
hensive voice, video and data plan instead
of segmented expansion like the AT&T
strategy.
Councilmember Sid Espinosa brought

up the possibility of this comprehensive
plan. In reality, the addition of these 20 an
tennas is part of an expansion plan by AT&T
that has the goal of eventually adding 80 an
tennas total in Palo Alto.
"It seems we're talking about 20 anten
nas, but actually we're setting a precedent
for 80 [antennas], and this is without having
that strategic discussion," said council mem
ber Greg Schmid.
Council member Karen Holman focused
her concerns on the aesthetic effects of an
tenna installation, asking the ARB why a
truly artistic design is not being considered.
Aesthetic concerns were one of the main is
sues raised by appellants and other residents
opposed to AT&T's plan.

Members of the Palo Alto City Council held a public hearing Monday night to discuss
whether or not the city should approve AT&T's plan to install 20 new antennas.
"The reason I decided to ap
peal was because I was frustrated
with the conclusion that the bat
tery back up was a good idea. I
think it's the bigger intrusion aes
thetically," said appellant Tench
Coxe. "The other reason I wanted
to appeal was because I've been
really frustrated the process, espe
cially the way in which AT&T has

pitted the city against each other
over the issue of cell coverage
[when] we are all in agreement
that we need better coverage,"
The possibility of using tree
canopy to help conceal equipment
and the antennas on the utility
poles was discussed. Williams con
firmed that AT&T would have to
pay for any trees planted. Howev
er, more mature trees that block
antennas can inhibit signals that
are emitted.

A similar hearing was held
April 4,2011 concerning the addi
tion of two Wi-Fi antennas to the

front facade of the Hotel President
at 488 University Avenue,
In this case, councilmembers
voted 8-1 to uphold the director
of planning's decision and ap
prove a permit for the antennas'
installation. Stipulations includ
ed that the residents be notified
at least three days in advance of
the installation and that the ap
plicant receive written permis
sion from residents to install and
maintain the antennas.
