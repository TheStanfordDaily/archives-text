# Study shows women report feeling more intense pain than men
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
Using a vast database of elec
tronic medical records, researchers
at the Stanford School of Medicine
were able to show "to a high level
of statistical significance" that
women report feeling pain more
intensely than men regardless of
the source of such pain, according
to a medical school press release.
The study, which was published
on Jan. 23 in the Journal of Pain,
took advantage of the Stanford
Translational Research Integrated
Database Environment
(STRIDE) a warehouse of
electronic patient records aggre
gated from both the Lucile
Packard's Children Hospital and
Stanford Hospital and Clinics. Re
searchers were able to search
through this data to find more than
160,000 instances in which a pain
score was recorded, coming from
around 72,000 adult patients.
A pain score ranges from zero
to 10, a number that represents
how patients respond when asked
to rank the intensity of their pain.
Zero indicates if one reports "no
pain," while 10 indicates "worse
than imaginable" pain.

The data was then whittled

down to a sample of more than
11,000 individual adult patients.
This sample consisted of 47 sepa
rate diagnostic categories in which
there were more than 40 pain re
ports for each gender. Researchers
then compressed the 47 diagnostic
categories into 16 different disease
clusters.
The average pain scores in each
of these disease clusters was high
er for women than for men, with
the most profound difference in
pain recorded coming from the
category of "musculoskeletal- and
connective tissue-" related pain.
"We saw higher pain scores for
female patients practically across
the board," said Atul Butte, associ
ate professor pediatrics and the
study's lead author, in the press re
lease. He added that these differ
ences were clinically significant.
"In many cases, the reported
difference approached a full point
on the l-to-10 scale," Butte said.
"How big is that? A pain-score im
provement of one point is what
clinical researchers view as indi
cating that a pain medication is
working."

The researchers also said that
there were several assumptions to
the study that should be explored:
could the patient's pain already
have been treated before he or she
arrived in the hospital? Could pa
tients respond differently about
their pain depending on who is in
the room? And do women actual
ly feel more pain or simply report
feeling more pain?

In an interview with the San
Jose Mercury News, Jeffrey Mogil,
a pain expert at McGill University
in Montreal, who was not involved

in the study, talked about the sig
nificance of the report.
"What this paper does above
and beyond what came before is a
matter of sheer size," Mogil said.
"In my mind, it puts the story to
bed forever."
The study's first authors were
graduate student in the School of
Medicine Linda Liu and pediatrics
postdoctoral scholar David Ruau.
Professors of anesthesia Martin
Angst and David Clark were co
authors.
