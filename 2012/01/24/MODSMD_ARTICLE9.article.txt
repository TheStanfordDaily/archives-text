# SAL transfers data to new student group management system
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
Late Sunday night, Student Ac
tivities and Leadership (SAL)
transferred data over from an old
student group registration system
to a new one, momentarily causing
some student officials to be locked
out of their privileges on the site.
Monday morning, several stu
dent group leaders reported expe
riencing problems accessing My-
Groups 2 a student group man
agement tool that assists with
banking, funding and event plan
ning. According to SAL Dean
Nanci Howe, this was a logistical
issue, caused by the transfer of in
formation to a new system.
SAL launched a new system
for managing student groups last
November called OrgSync. The

old application, called MyGroups,
had its functions divided into two
parts: MyGroupsl handled stu
dent group registration while My-
Groups 2 dealt with event planning
and banking. Last night, OrgSync
took over the functions of My-
Groupsl.
This transfer of information,
however, caused a temporary hic
cup for certain group leaders. Ac
cording to SAL peer adviser Brad
Moylan 'l3, MyGroupsl allowed
student organizations to name as
many officers as they wished and
designate them certain privileges.
The only officers whose informa
tion was transferred over to
OrgSync though were those in the
positions of president, vice presi
dent or financial manager.

"The normal officers have been
transferred from the old system to
OrgSync," Howe said. "But there
are other students that had been
given special access like party
planners that have not."

Howe said she noticed the
problem soon after midnight in the
early hours of Monday. Since
OrgSync was now linked to My-
Groups 2, the officers who were
not transferred over to the new
OrgSync system had lost their
privileges in MyGroups2.
Monday evening, several stu
dent group leaders reported that
their access to MyGroups2 had
been restored. Howe wrote in a
follow-up email to The Daily that
the problem had indeed been re
solved.

"There still may be a few glitch
es, but the main problem has been
fixed," Howe said.
According to Moylan, the in
formation in MyGroups2 will
eventually be migrated over to
OrgSync as well, consolidating all
of the functions for student man
agement into one system.
