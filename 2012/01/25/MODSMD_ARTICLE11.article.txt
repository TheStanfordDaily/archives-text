# ON THE MARGINS, BETWEEN THE LINES
## Combating racism by recognizing privilege 
### Jamie Solomon 
Last Monday was Martin
Luther King Jr. Day, a day
that never fails to highlight
how little progress we have made
on racial inequality since the 19605.
Although this is troubling, it's hard
to know what one person can to do
to change things. In some ways, as a
white person, it's doubly hard for
me to figure out how to effect
change on this issue because, al
though I might see racism directed
towards my friends, it's not some
thing I really experience myself.
However, I still recognize that
it's a problem and, along with a
whole number of other "isms," it's
an issue on which I would rather
be part of the solution. Over the
last few years, I've become aware
of a different way to frame the dis
cussion about racism, one that I
have found helpful. This approach
situates the white experience fully
within the issue and in relation to
the experiences of others, giving
me a new way to understand both
my relationship with racism and
the role and responsibility I have
in combating it.

This reframing focuses on the
idea of understanding one's privi
lege. Privilege is the acknowl
edgement that some groups of
people get rights and advantages
given to them while others are de
nied the same rights and advan
tages. These benefits, especially
when talking about issues such as
race, are unearned, because no
one chooses what racial group
they are born into. Examples of
white privilege might include
being perceived by some as more
competent and hardworking than
people of most other races and
the assumption that your admis
sion to college is based on your
qualifications instead of the need
to fill an affirmative action quota.
Although I am discussing this
in terms of race, this concept ap
plies to a number of issues such as
gender, sexual orientation, age,
economic status, educational
background, gender expression,
physical ability and citizenship
status. Your level of privilege is
not always simple; it may depend
on the context, and your privi

leges in different categories may
intersect in nuanced ways. You
may be black and thus unprivi
leged racially or be heterosexual
and thus privileged with regard to
sexual orientation. Most people
belong to some groups with high
privilege and some with low. This
does not mean that they cancel
each other out; rather, they are
facets of an identity to be aware of
that intersect and shape the ways
in which you are able to move
through society.
You are probably barely aware
of the ways in which your areas of
privilege benefit you, because priv
ilege often makes itself invisible to
those who have it (on the other
hand, it is generally easy to recog
nize the privilege of others.) If your
privilege is in terms of race, part of
this is because being white in
America is too often considered to
be the neutral and universal Amer
ican experience, when in many
ways our society makes it a posi
tion of power. This leads to ideas
such as white people not having a
culture and the ability of whites to

deny the fact that people of differ
ent races may not share their expe
rience.
Consciously making the effort
to recognize privilege and under
stand how it shapes your life (and
the lives of those around you) al
lows you to combat these invisible
assumptions that help to maintain
the racial hierarchy that we live in.
Recognizing that you are privi
leged means, in part, becoming
aware that your lived experience
is not a baseline normality; it is
one of heightened advantage.
Knowing that we live our lives
within a structure of racism re
futes the idea that when people of
racial privilege do well it is solely
because of their personal effort,
and also refutes the notion that
when people of color do not do as
well it is because they didn't try
hard enough.
And yes, acknowledging your
privilege is a hard thing to do. It's
hard to admit that in the United
States, a country that places so
much emphasis on hard work and
individuality, structural racism

may have played a greater role in
determining where you are in life
than your own effort. We all want
to believe that we have earned the
opportunities we've had. This is
why discussions about privilege
often inspire guilt or defensive -
ness; however, recognizing privi
lege is not about blame. Just as
someone born into low privilege
did not choose it, neither did
someone born into high privilege.
But denying and ignoring your
own privilege only means that you
are further allowing the system of
inequality to disenfranchise oth
ers. So don't pretend it doesn't
exist; instead, acknowledge and
embrace the fact that you under
stand you have privilege. Then it
becomes a tool, helping you own
your role in combating racism and
increasing your ability to play a
part in dismantling the racist hier
archy in which we live.

not always simple; it may depend
on the context, and your privi

leges in different categories may
intersect in nuanced ways. You
may be black and thus unprivi
leged racially or be heterosexual
and thus privileged with regard to
sexual orientation. Most people
belong to some groups with high
privilege and some with low. This
does not mean that they cancel
each other out; rather, they are
facets of an identity to be aware of
that intersect and shape the ways
in which you are able to move
through society.
You are probably barely aware
of the ways in which your areas of
privilege benefit you, because priv
ilege often makes itself invisible to
those who have it (on the other
hand, it is generally easy to recog
nize the privilege of others.) If your
privilege is in terms of race, part of
this is because being white in
America is too often considered to
be the neutral and universal Amer
ican experience, when in many
ways our society makes it a posi
tion of power. This leads to ideas
such as white people not having a
culture and the ability of whites to

deny the fact that people of differ
ent races may not share their expe
rience.
Consciously making the effort
to recognize privilege and under
stand how it shapes your life (and
the lives of those around you) al
lows you to combat these invisible
assumptions that help to maintain
the racial hierarchy that we live in.
Recognizing that you are privi
leged means, in part, becoming
aware that your lived experience
is not a baseline normality; it is
one of heightened advantage.
Knowing that we live our lives
within a structure of racism re
futes the idea that when people of
racial privilege do well it is solely
because of their personal effort,
and also refutes the notion that
when people of color do not do as
well it is because they didn't try
hard enough.
And yes, acknowledging your
privilege is a hard thing to do. It's
hard to admit that in the United
States, a country that places so
much emphasis on hard work and
individuality, structural racism

may have played a greater role in
determining where you are in life
than your own effort. We all want
to believe that we have earned the
opportunities we've had. This is
why discussions about privilege
often inspire guilt or defensive -
ness; however, recognizing privi
lege is not about blame. Just as
someone born into low privilege
did not choose it, neither did
someone born into high privilege.
But denying and ignoring your
own privilege only means that you
are further allowing the system of
inequality to disenfranchise oth
ers. So don't pretend it doesn't
exist; instead, acknowledge and
embrace the fact that you under
stand you have privilege. Then it
becomes a tool, helping you own
your role in combating racism and
increasing your ability to play a
part in dismantling the racist hier
archy in which we live.

Last Monday was Martin
Luther King Jr. Day, a day
that never fails to highlight
how little progress we have made
on racial inequality since the 19605.
Although this is troubling, it's hard
to know what one person can to do
to change things. In some ways, as a
white person, it's doubly hard for
me to figure out how to effect
change on this issue because, al
though I might see racism directed
towards my friends, it's not some
thing I really experience myself.
However, I still recognize that
it's a problem and, along with a
whole number of other "isms," it's
an issue on which I would rather
be part of the solution. Over the
last few years, I've become aware
of a different way to frame the dis
cussion about racism, one that I
have found helpful. This approach
situates the white experience fully
within the issue and in relation to
the experiences of others, giving
me a new way to understand both
my relationship with racism and
the role and responsibility I have
in combating it.

This reframing focuses on the
idea of understanding one's privi
lege. Privilege is the acknowl
edgement that some groups of
people get rights and advantages
given to them while others are de
nied the same rights and advan
tages. These benefits, especially
when talking about issues such as
race, are unearned, because no
one chooses what racial group
they are born into. Examples of
white privilege might include
being perceived by some as more
competent and hardworking than
people of most other races and
the assumption that your admis
sion to college is based on your
qualifications instead of the need
to fill an affirmative action quota.
Although I am discussing this
in terms of race, this concept ap
plies to a number of issues such as
gender, sexual orientation, age,
economic status, educational
background, gender expression,
physical ability and citizenship
status. Your level of privilege is
not always simple; it may depend
on the context, and your privi

leges in different categories may
intersect in nuanced ways. You
may be black and thus unprivi
leged racially or be heterosexual
and thus privileged with regard to
sexual orientation. Most people

privilege and some with low. This
