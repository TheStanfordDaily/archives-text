## PEAKS AND VALLEYS RECENT LOSSES IN OREGON, WASHINGTON RAISE QUESTIONS 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
After a 15-3 start, the Stanford
men's basketball team appeared
to have stepped up into the top
tier of the Pac-12, and all signs
pointed toward a fight to make
the NCAA Tournament. Two
games later, and there are sudden
ly questions of whether the Cardi
nal has even improved very much
since head coach Johnny
Dawkins' first year on the Farm.
That may be a bit of an overre
action, but a come-from-ahead,
double-digit loss to mediocre
Washington State and an uncom
petitive beat down by Washington
don't inspire very much confi
dence.

Of course, the 15 wins so far
are already as many as the team
had last year and more than in 'O9-
'lO, but success in major college
basketball is measured by post
season success. And so far,
Dawkins has led Stanford to one
postseason tournament the
lowly CBI three years ago and
lost to a conference foe that year.
The quick start this year has given
Stanford fans hope of making it
back to the Big Dance, and that

hope is certainly still there. But
the team's struggles in the Ever
green State are worrisome for
those chances.

For much of the season, the
Cardinal's calling cards have been
defense and rebounding. Against
foes from the Pacific Northwest,
however, those have been flaws
instead of strengths. Case in point:
in the 16 games against teams out
side Oregon and Washington, the
Cardinal allowed 72 points or
fewer in every game and outre
bounded its opponent in every
game but one. Not surprisingly,
Stanford's record in those 16
games is 14-2. In Stanford's four
contests against Oregon, Oregon
State, Washington State and
Washington, though, the Cardinal
has allowed more than 72 points
in every game and has failed to
outrebound any of its four oppo
nents. Stanford's record in those
four games: 1-3, with the one win
coming in quadruple overtime.
All this is not to say that the
problem is confined to those par
ticular teams. The other trait that
those four games share is that all
four were on the road, and this

takes on cross-bay rival and conference frontrunner California.
could be the biggest issue. In six
road games, Stanford is 3-3, but
only one of those wins came
against a team with an RPI above
280 (the quadruple-overtime win
over OSU).
This is particularly notable be
cause the Cardinal's next game
comes on the road against the
likely favorite to win the confer
ence: Cal. The Golden Bears are
13-0 at Haas Pavilion, and Stan
ford has lost its last three games
there by a combined 52 points.
With how bad the Pac-12 is this
year, the Cardinal cannot afford a
poor showing against the confer
ence's current top dog.
On the positive side, Stanford
sits just a game out of first place
in the Pac-12 and has ample op
portunity to move up in the
standings. Six teams have two or
three conference losses, and the

Cardinal gets to play five games
against those teams in its final 10
games, so winning the confer
ence is fully in Stanford's con
trol. And even as bad as the Pac
-12 has been, the team that wins
the regular-season title par
ticularly if its conference record
is around 13-5 or 14-4 will al
most definitely make the NCAA
Tournament in March.
Stanford has shown flashes of
the ability necessary to win the
conference, and its schedule
going forward sets up well for a
run at the Pac-12 title. In order to
have any shot at doing so and
making the first major postseason
tournament in the Dawkins era,
though, the Cardinal desperately
needs to become more consistent,
particularly on the road. Stanford
will get its toughest road test of
the year on Sunday, and the
team's performance against Cal
will be very telling about its post
season chances.

Stanford fans hope of making it
back to the Big Dance, and that

hope is certainly still there. But
the team's struggles in the Ever
green State are worrisome for
those chances.

For much of the season, the
Cardinal's calling cards have been
defense and rebounding. Against
foes from the Pacific Northwest,
however, those have been flaws
instead of strengths. Case in point:
in the 16 games against teams out
side Oregon and Washington, the
Cardinal allowed 72 points or
fewer in every game and outre
bounded its opponent in every
game but one. Not surprisingly,
Stanford's record in those 16
games is 14-2. In Stanford's four
contests against Oregon, Oregon
State, Washington State and
Washington, though, the Cardinal
has allowed more than 72 points
in every game and has failed to
outrebound any of its four oppo
nents. Stanford's record in those
four games: 1-3, with the one win
coming in quadruple overtime.
All this is not to say that the
problem is confined to those par
ticular teams. The other trait that
those four games share is that all
four were on the road, and this

could be the biggest issue. In six
road games, Stanford is 3-3, but
only one of those wins came
against a team with an RPI above
280 (the quadruple-overtime win
over OSU).
This is particularly notable be
cause the Cardinal's next game
comes on the road against the
likely favorite to win the confer
ence: Cal. The Golden Bears are
13-0 at Haas Pavilion, and Stan
ford has lost its last three games
there by a combined 52 points.
With how bad the Pac-12 is this
year, the Cardinal cannot afford a
poor showing against the confer
ence's current top dog.
On the positive side, Stanford
sits just a game out of first place
in the Pac-12 and has ample op
portunity to move up in the
standings. Six teams have two or
three conference losses, and the

Cardinal gets to play five games
against those teams in its final 10
games, so winning the confer
ence is fully in Stanford's con
trol. And even as bad as the Pac
-12 has been, the team that wins
the regular-season title par
ticularly if its conference record
is around 13-5 or 14-4 will al
most definitely make the NCAA
Tournament in March.
Stanford has shown flashes of
the ability necessary to win the
conference, and its schedule
going forward sets up well for a
run at the Pac-12 title. In order to
have any shot at doing so and
making the first major postseason
tournament in the Dawkins era,
though, the Cardinal desperately
needs to become more consistent,
particularly on the road. Stanford
will get its toughest road test of
the year on Sunday, and the
team's performance against Cal
will be very telling about its post
season chances.
