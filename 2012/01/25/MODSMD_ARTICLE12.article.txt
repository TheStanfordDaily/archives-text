## PEAKS AND VALLEYS RECENT LOSSES IN OREGON, WASHINGTON RAISE QUESTIONS 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
After a 15-3 start, the Stanford
men's basketball team appeared
to have stepped up into the top
tier of the Pac-12, and all signs
pointed toward a fight to make
the NCAA Tournament. Two
games later, and there are sudden
ly questions of whether the Cardi
nal has even improved very much
since head coach Johnny
Dawkins' first year on the Farm.
That may be a bit of an overre
action, but a come-from-ahead,
double-digit loss to mediocre
Washington State and an uncom
petitive beat down by Washington
don't inspire very much confi
dence.

Of course, the 15 wins so far
are already as many as the team
had last year and more than in 'O9-
'lO, but success in major college
basketball is measured by post
season success. And so far,
Dawkins has led Stanford to one
postseason tournament the
lowly CBI three years ago and
lost to a conference foe that year.
The quick start this year has given
Stanford fans hope of making it
back to the Big Dance, and that

hope is certainly still there. But
the team's struggles in the Ever
green State are worrisome for
those chances.

For much of the season, the
Cardinal's calling cards have been
defense and rebounding. Against
foes from the Pacific Northwest,
however, those have been flaws
instead of strengths. Case in point:
in the 16 games against teams out
side Oregon and Washington, the
Cardinal allowed 72 points or
fewer in every game and outre
bounded its opponent in every
game but one. Not surprisingly,
Stanford's record in those 16
games is 14-2. In Stanford's four
contests against Oregon, Oregon
State, Washington State and
Washington, though, the Cardinal
has allowed more than 72 points
in every game and has failed to
outrebound any of its four oppo
nents. Stanford's record in those
four games: 1-3, with the one win
coming in quadruple overtime.
All this is not to say that the
problem is confined to those par
ticular teams. The other trait that
those four games share is that all
four were on the road, and this

The Stanford men's basketball team had a discouraging weekend in
Washington, falling to both schools in double-digit losses. The Cardinal
will look to harness its strong defense and rebound this weekend when it
takes on cross-bay rival and conference frontrunner California.
