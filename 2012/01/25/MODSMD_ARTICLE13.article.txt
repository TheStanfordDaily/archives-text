# Q&A
## Catching up with Chasson Randle 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Chasson Randle, the Class of
2015's lone men's basketball re
cruit, has comfortably settled into
his starting role on the Pac-12
stage. This past summer, the 6-
foot-1 guard from Rock Island,
111., received numerous accolades
from opposing teams' coaches on
the squad's trip to Spain, and he
has been an integral part of the
Cardinal's 15-5 start.

Statistically he has made an in
stant impact: he currently aver
ages the second-most minutes on
the team (30.1 per game, close be
hind sophomore Aaron Bright
with 30.2), leads the team in steals
(23), ranks second-best, again to
Bright, in both assists (44) and
three-pointers made (39) and has
taken more shots than any of his
teammates (190). In the team's
Jan. 7 quadruple-overtime 103-

101 win over Oregon State, Ran
dle was unstoppable; he led all
players on the floor with 24 points,
including the first five points in
the fourth overtime and the
game-clinching points with 37 sec
onds remaining.
Randle, a soft-spoken leader,
recently sat down with The Stan
ford Daily to discuss his experi
ences donning a Cardinal jersey
thus far.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
drew you to Stanford over schools
closer to home?

Chasson Randle (CR): Really I
felt that I could get the best of
both worlds, both academically
and on the basketball court. And I
have an opportunity to do some
thing special here as far as basket
ball goes.
TSD: What do you mean by
"something special"?
CR: Like win championships
Pac-12 championships. And make
the Tournament and go far.
TSD: The team hasn't gone to the
NCAA Tournament in four years.
What would a Tournament berth
mean to you, as a freshman, and to
the program as a whole?
CR: First of all, I think it would be a
great accomplishment for the pro
gram, starting up a legacy that we
want to build here again. And as a
freshman, it would mean a lot be
cause hopefully I can go all four
years that I'm here and do some
thing special while I'm here.
TSD: Before the school year had
even started, you went to Spain with
the team. Can you talk about the en
tire Spain trip experience?
CR It was a great learning experi
ence, playing against grown men
over there they were all in their
late twenties and early thirties. It's
very physical over there. And also
getting a chance to play with these
guys, my teammates, and kind of
learning how they play and learning
about the coaches and how they
coach, really becoming acclimated
with everything as far as the basket
ball thing goes.
TSD: Was it lonely being the only
freshman?
CR During the summer it was a lit
tle bit. But my teammates all have
helped me out, like Anthony
[Brown] and those guys, they're like
my big brothers.
TSD: Now that you're well into the
conference season, what would you
say has been the biggest difference
between high school basketball and
Pac-12 basketball?
CR I'd say everyone is a lot quicker
from the big players, the fours and
the fives, to the guards everyone's
a lot quicker. And you have to think
about the game a lot more at this
level.
TSD: You're the only freshman in
the rotation right now, but you are
getting the second-most minutes on
the team and lead the team in shot
attempts. How are you balancing
being a freshman with being a team
leader already?
CR I feel like a leader, but really, I'm
just trying to help my team out as
best as I can, and grow as a player
and person while I'm doing it. It's
been a great experience so far, and

my teammates are finding me in the
right spots, and I'm able to get shots
off. And then, as far as the minutes
go,l'm just thankful that my coaches
believe in me, and so do my players.
TSD: What is Coach Dawkins in
structing you to do when you get
open looks?
CR: He's not really telling me what
to do he's just telling me to stay
aggressive whenever I'm out there
on the floor, just look to make plays,
to help either myself or my team
mates on both ends of the floor.
TSD: A couple of weeks ago, your
team won a crazy four-overtime
game at Oregon State, and you led
everyone in scoring. What's it like to
play in a game like that and to come
away with the win?
CR: Well, it was my first time in a
four-overtime game. The atmos
phere was crazy up there. It was very
intense. Honestly, I felt like I could
have kept playing. I wasn't really
tired. You just get caught up in the
moment. But it was just a great game
and to come out with the win, it
means a lot for our team, and it
showed that we have a lot of heart
and character to stick things out
when things get tough especially
on the road.
TSD: How are road games?
CR [Laughs.] A lot more challeng
ing than home games, I can tell you
that.The other crowd, they get into it,
the away team. A lot of [personal at
tacks], things like that. You have to
be focused.
TSD: Up to this point, the team has
struggled with turnovers and free
throws. How do you see that turning
around as the season progresses?
CR Really, we've been working on
that in practice a lot, and really just
trying to correct that as best as we
can. I think we'll start seeing better
results as we keep playing games.
TSD: What has been the highlight of
your freshman experience thus far?
CR Where should I start? It's all
been a great experience so far, but I
have to say the first game that I
played was a big moment for me,you
know, starting as a freshman. And
the game we played against Oregon
State, just going into four overtimes,
and the way everyone played, it was
great for our team, and hopefully we
can just build on that and keep play
ing good basketball.

TSD: Well, thanks for sitting down
with me.
CR: No problem... thanks for talk
ing to me.

everyone in scoring. What's it like to
play in a game like that and to come
away with the win?
CR: Well, it was my first time in a
four-overtime game. The atmos
phere was crazy up there. It was very
intense. Honestly, I felt like I could
have kept playing. I wasn't really
tired. You just get caught up in the
moment. But it was just a great game
and to come out with the win, it
means a lot for our team, and it
showed that we have a lot of heart
and character to stick things out
when things get tough especially
on the road.
TSD: How are road games?
CR [Laughs.] A lot more challeng
ing than home games, I can tell you
that.The other crowd, they get into it,
the away team. A lot of [personal at
tacks], things like that. You have to
be focused.
TSD: Up to this point, the team has
struggled with turnovers and free
throws. How do you see that turning
around as the season progresses?
CR Really, we've been working on
that in practice a lot, and really just
trying to correct that as best as we
can. I think we'll start seeing better
results as we keep playing games.
TSD: What has been the highlight of
your freshman experience thus far?
CR Where should I start? It's all
been a great experience so far, but I
have to say the first game that I
played was a big moment for me,you
know, starting as a freshman. And
the game we played against Oregon
State, just going into four overtimes,
and the way everyone played, it was
great for our team, and hopefully we
can just build on that and keep play
ing good basketball.

TSD: Well, thanks for sitting down
with me.
CR: No problem... thanks for talk
ing to me.

Chasson Randle, the Class of
2015's lone men's basketball re
cruit, has comfortably settled into
his starting role on the Pac-12
stage. This past summer, the 6-
foot-1 guard from Rock Island,
111., received numerous accolades
from opposing teams' coaches on
the squad's trip to Spain, and he
has been an integral part of the
Cardinal's 15-5 start.

Statistically he has made an in
stant impact: he currently aver
ages the second-most minutes on
the team (30.1 per game, close be
hind sophomore Aaron Bright
with 30.2), leads the team in steals
(23), ranks second-best, again to
Bright, in both assists (44) and
three-pointers made (39) and has
taken more shots than any of his
teammates (190). In the team's
Jan. 7 quadruple-overtime 103-

101 win over Oregon State, Ran
dle was unstoppable; he led all
players on the floor with 24 points,
including the first five points in
the fourth overtime and the
game-clinching points with 37 sec
onds remaining.
Randle, a soft-spoken leader,
recently sat down with The Stan
ford Daily to discuss his experi
ences donning a Cardinal jersey
thus far.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
drew you to Stanford over schools
closer to home?

Chasson Randle (CR): Really I
felt that I could get the best of
both worlds, both academically
and on the basketball court. And I
have an opportunity to do some
thing special here as far as basket
ball goes.
TSD: What do you mean by
"something special"?
CR: Like win championships
Pac-12 championships. And make
the Tournament and go far.
TSD: The team hasn't gone to the
NCAA Tournament in four years.
What would a Tournament berth
mean to you, as a freshman, and to
the program as a whole?
CR: First of all, I think it would be a
great accomplishment for the pro
gram, starting up a legacy that we
want to build here again. And as a
freshman, it would mean a lot be
cause hopefully I can go all four
years that I'm here and do some
thing special while I'm here.
TSD: Before the school year had
even started, you went to Spain with
the team. Can you talk about the en
tire Spain trip experience?
CR It was a great learning experi
ence, playing against grown men
over there they were all in their
late twenties and early thirties. It's
very physical over there. And also
getting a chance to play with these
guys, my teammates, and kind of
learning how they play and learning
about the coaches and how they
coach, really becoming acclimated
with everything as far as the basket
ball thing goes.
TSD: Was it lonely being the only
freshman?
CR During the summer it was a lit
tle bit. But my teammates all have
helped me out, like Anthony
[Brown] and those guys, they're like
my big brothers.
TSD: Now that you're well into the
conference season, what would you
say has been the biggest difference
between high school basketball and
Pac-12 basketball?
CR I'd say everyone is a lot quicker
from the big players, the fours and
the fives, to the guards everyone's
a lot quicker. And you have to think
about the game a lot more at this
level.
TSD: You're the only freshman in
the rotation right now, but you are
getting the second-most minutes on
the team and lead the team in shot
attempts. How are you balancing
being a freshman with being a team
leader already?
CR I feel like a leader, but really, I'm
just trying to help my team out as
best as I can, and grow as a player
and person while I'm doing it. It's
been a great experience so far, and

my teammates are finding me in the
right spots, and I'm able to get shots
off. And then, as far as the minutes
go,l'm just thankful that my coaches
believe in me, and so do my players.
TSD: What is Coach Dawkins in
structing you to do when you get
open looks?
CR: He's not really telling me what
to do he's just telling me to stay
aggressive whenever I'm out there
on the floor, just look to make plays,
to help either myself or my team
mates on both ends of the floor.
TSD: A couple of weeks ago, your
team won a crazy four-overtime
game at Oregon State, and you led
everyone in scoring. What's it like to
play in a game like that and to come
away with the win?
CR: Well, it was my first time in a
