# Q&A
## Catching up with Chasson Randle 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Chasson Randle, the Class of
2015's lone men's basketball re
cruit, has comfortably settled into
his starting role on the Pac-12
stage. This past summer, the 6-
foot-1 guard from Rock Island,
111., received numerous accolades
from opposing teams' coaches on
the squad's trip to Spain, and he
has been an integral part of the
Cardinal's 15-5 start.

Statistically he has made an in
stant impact: he currently aver
ages the second-most minutes on
the team (30.1 per game, close be
hind sophomore Aaron Bright
with 30.2), leads the team in steals
(23), ranks second-best, again to
Bright, in both assists (44) and
three-pointers made (39) and has
taken more shots than any of his
teammates (190). In the team's
Jan. 7 quadruple-overtime 103-

101 win over Oregon State, Ran
dle was unstoppable; he led all
players on the floor with 24 points,
including the first five points in
the fourth overtime and the
game-clinching points with 37 sec
onds remaining.
Randle, a soft-spoken leader,
recently sat down with The Stan
ford Daily to discuss his experi
ences donning a Cardinal jersey
thus far.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
drew you to Stanford over schools
closer to home?

Chasson Randle (CR): Really I
felt that I could get the best of
both worlds, both academically
and on the basketball court. And I
have an opportunity to do some
thing special here as far as basket
ball goes.
