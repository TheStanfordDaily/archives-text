# Andrew, please don't go

### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
It feels more and more like
young people today are losing
touch with reality. Well,
maybe not reality, but we are
more and more reliant on the
virtual world to communicate and
find our news and gossip.
Take, for instance, this message I
received from one of my room
mates earlier this afternoon: "Hey
bro, did u c prince 2 D-troit? Ur Sox
r in trouble lol." This wasn't just a
text message, but rather an instant
message he sent while Skyping me.
While we were on the phone. And
he was in his room next door.

Like I said, we are losing touch
with the physical world. Which is
why every week I take a few mo
ments to sit down and put pen to
paper with a letter to an athlete I ad
mire, but who I hope will listen to
some words of wisdom.

The following is what I came up
with for this week:
Dear Andrew...

As I write this letter, I am simul
taneously watching highlights of
these past few glorious seasons on
the Farm. There is the strike you
threw to Doug Baldwin while being
pulled to the ground, followed by
the one-handed take-your-breath
away grab you made against
UCLA. Who could forget the 51-
yard touchdown scamper against
Washington and 52-yarder against
Wake Forest?

Ah, there are my personal fa
vorites the absolute beat-downs
you handed Cal's Sean Cattouse
and USC's Shareece Wright (ac
companied by a great call from the
broadcast team).

And of course there are several

minutes devoted to the masterpiece
you painted against Oregon in the
2009 upset and the surgical preci
sion with which you dissected Vir
ginia Tech's vaunted defense in the
Orange Bowl.
That leaves out the incredible
comeback you led against USC mo
ments after being picked off. leaving
hordes of distraught Stanford fans
worried they would once more
have to suffer the wrath of the most
obnoxious fans and fight song
in the land.
But enough of singing your
praises, because you have plenty of
people to do that in the months
leading up to your coronation as the
NFL's No. 1 pick in April Phil
Simms' insanity notwithstanding.
Actually, that's kind of why I'm
writing to you, Austen (note how
my personal relationship allows me
to call you by your uniquely spelled
middle name.)
I want you to shock the world,
make a terrible business decision
and suit up a few more times for the
Cardinal. I realize that this is, in fact,
impossible. You hired an agent,
passed the deadline for withdraw
ing from the draft and by all ac
counts are knee-deep in workouts
to show people why Heisman vot
ers certainly did not pick the better
NFL quarterback prospect.
But there is so much more work
to be done on this campus, Andrew!
I am afraid of what the future
holds in store for Stanford football.
Definitely not next season, when I
believe Barry Sanders Jr. and Step
fan Taylor will lead the Cardinal's
stable of running backs, and a hun
gry Shayne Skov will leave his mark
on players and the program.
That should also keep the ball
rolling for 2013, when I expect big
things from Brett Nottingham. Seri
ously.
And I don't even think there will
be an exodus of fans from the
games just because there is no No.
12 running around making plays
with a beehive on his neck.
No, I am afraid because I fear
that the greatness of the past three
years of Stanford football will fade
into obscurity with all the great

things going on at this campus in
any one moment.
Surrounded by Nobel Prize win
ners, and amongst the multitude of
NCAA championships because of
the quantity of quality athletes that
bike these streets, Stanford football
had a chance to stick it to the SEC,
the East Coast haters and the igno
rant citizens all across the country
who do not realize that Stanford is
not just a place for nerds.
Sure, #Revengeofthenerds is a
great sign to show off on College
Game Day, but it feels like we were
just one or two wins away from
spawning the type of freshmen that
flock to USC.
We will rarely have the kind of
players that normally suit up for
Troy or LSU or Alabama. But that
is because we do not want them.
They would not get in.
But I was hoping that a BCS
Championship or at least another
BCS bowl game win would finish
off the job that Harbaugh began
cultivating and that you and your
crew took to heart in just a few short
years on the Farm: make Stanford a
perennial power in the most popu
lar college sport in the country.
I applaud David Shaw for the
job he has done in out-recruiting
Harbaugh and setting Stanford on a
solid track to try to continue the
winning ways of these last seasons.
However, I had even bigger
dreams for us. Call me Don
Quixote, but I dreamt of a campus
actually enthralled with college
football from September through
January. A campus that was able to
pack not only the USC and Oregon
games but also the San Jose State
and Washington State games
staying until the final whistle.
Which is why I want you to avoid
the Colts and all that insanity and
sue the NCAA to regain your final
year of eligibility. Sure, it didn't
work out for Maurice Clarett, but
you're a whole lot smarter.
Wouldn't it feel good to hoist up
that crystal trophy in Miami next
January and finally put a Heisman
on your mantle? But hey, what do I
know?

MVP trophy on his mantel. Email

Cardinal. I realize that this is, in fact,
impossible. You hired an agent,
passed the deadline for withdraw
ing from the draft and by all ac
counts are knee-deep in workouts
to show people why Heisman vot
ers certainly did not pick the better
NFL quarterback prospect.
But there is so much more work
to be done on this campus, Andrew!
I am afraid of what the future
holds in store for Stanford football.
Definitely not next season, when I
believe Barry Sanders Jr. and Step
fan Taylor will lead the Cardinal's
stable of running backs, and a hun
gry Shayne Skov will leave his mark
on players and the program.
That should also keep the ball
rolling for 2013, when I expect big
things from Brett Nottingham. Seri
ously.
And I don't even think there will
be an exodus of fans from the
games just because there is no No.
12 running around making plays
with a beehive on his neck.
No, I am afraid because I fear
that the greatness of the past three
years of Stanford football will fade
into obscurity with all the great

things going on at this campus in
any one moment.
Surrounded by Nobel Prize win
ners, and amongst the multitude of
NCAA championships because of
the quantity of quality athletes that
bike these streets, Stanford football
had a chance to stick it to the SEC,
the East Coast haters and the igno
rant citizens all across the country
who do not realize that Stanford is
not just a place for nerds.
Sure, #Revengeofthenerds is a
great sign to show off on College
Game Day, but it feels like we were
just one or two wins away from
spawning the type of freshmen that
flock to USC.
We will rarely have the kind of
players that normally suit up for
Troy or LSU or Alabama. But that
is because we do not want them.
They would not get in.
But I was hoping that a BCS
Championship or at least another
BCS bowl game win would finish
off the job that Harbaugh began
cultivating and that you and your
crew took to heart in just a few short
years on the Farm: make Stanford a
perennial power in the most popu
lar college sport in the country.
I applaud David Shaw for the
job he has done in out-recruiting
Harbaugh and setting Stanford on a
solid track to try to continue the
winning ways of these last seasons.
However, I had even bigger
dreams for us. Call me Don
Quixote, but I dreamt of a campus
actually enthralled with college
football from September through
January. A campus that was able to
pack not only the USC and Oregon
games but also the San Jose State
and Washington State games
staying until the final whistle.
Which is why I want you to avoid
the Colts and all that insanity and
sue the NCAA to regain your final
year of eligibility. Sure, it didn't
work out for Maurice Clarett, but
you're a whole lot smarter.
Wouldn't it feel good to hoist up
that crystal trophy in Miami next
January and finally put a Heisman
on your mantle? But hey, what do I
know?

Well, Miles may not know much,
but he has the freaking Ink Bowl
MVP trophy on his mantel. Email

It feels more and more like
young people today are losing
touch with reality. Well,
maybe not reality, but we are
more and more reliant on the
virtual world to communicate and
find our news and gossip.
Take, for instance, this message I
received from one of my room
mates earlier this afternoon: "Hey
bro, did u c prince 2 D-troit? Ur Sox
r in trouble lol." This wasn't just a
text message, but rather an instant
message he sent while Skyping me.
While we were on the phone. And
he was in his room next door.

Like I said, we are losing touch
with the physical world. Which is
why every week I take a few mo
ments to sit down and put pen to
paper with a letter to an athlete I ad
mire, but who I hope will listen to
some words of wisdom.

The following is what I came up
with for this week:
Dear Andrew...

As I write this letter, I am simul
taneously watching highlights of
these past few glorious seasons on
the Farm. There is the strike you
threw to Doug Baldwin while being
pulled to the ground, followed by
the one-handed take-your-breath
away grab you made against
UCLA. Who could forget the 51-
yard touchdown scamper against
Washington and 52-yarder against
Wake Forest?

Ah, there are my personal fa
vorites the absolute beat-downs
you handed Cal's Sean Cattouse
and USC's Shareece Wright (ac
companied by a great call from the
broadcast team).

And of course there are several

minutes devoted to the masterpiece
you painted against Oregon in the
2009 upset and the surgical preci
sion with which you dissected Vir
ginia Tech's vaunted defense in the
Orange Bowl.
That leaves out the incredible
comeback you led against USC mo
ments after being picked off. leaving
hordes of distraught Stanford fans
worried they would once more
have to suffer the wrath of the most
obnoxious fans and fight song
in the land.
But enough of singing your
praises, because you have plenty of
people to do that in the months
leading up to your coronation as the
NFL's No. 1 pick in April Phil
Simms' insanity notwithstanding.
Actually, that's kind of why I'm
writing to you, Austen (note how
my personal relationship allows me
to call you by your uniquely spelled
middle name.)
I want you to shock the world,
make a terrible business decision
and suit up a few more times for the
Cardinal. I realize that this is, in fact,
impossible. You hired an agent,
passed the deadline for withdraw
ing from the draft and by all ac
counts are knee-deep in workouts
