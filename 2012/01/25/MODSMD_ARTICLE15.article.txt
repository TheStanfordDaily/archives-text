Collegiate Player of the Year
Ashley Hansen, the Cardinal

ished 42-17 and was one win
away from a berth in the
Women's College World Series.

Pac-12. Seven of the confer
ence's nine teams are in the top

15 in the rankings, headlined by

comes in at No. 3, with No. 8 Ari
zona, No. 11 Oregon, No. 13
UCLA and No. 14 Washington
the other conference squads ex
pected to contend with the Card.

the country's top competition,
opening the season at the Ka
jikawa Classic on Feb. 10 and
setting up a potential top-10
showdown with No. 5 Oklahoma
at the Cathedral City Classic two
weeks later on Feb. 24.
