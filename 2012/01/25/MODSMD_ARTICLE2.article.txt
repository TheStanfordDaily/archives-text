# PA responds to 'achievement gap'
## Parents, teachers and officials address stratification in test scores, graduation 
### JUDITH PELPOLA NEELTHAKKAR 
Palo Alto parents called for a
reduction last week of the
achievement gap between mi
nority and non-minority stu
dents in the Palo Alto Unified
School District (PAUSD). Frus
trated guardians voiced their
complaints to the PAUSD Board
of Education at a meeting on
Tues., Jan. 17.

One of those parents was
Michele Dauber, who is also a
Stanford law professor and head
of the organization We Can Do
Better Palo Alto.

Dauber cited the teaching
and counseling in Palo Alto as a
prime factor of the trend, claim
ing counselors and teachers fail
to encourage minority students
to take courses beyond current
requirements.
"I think they're basically
steered off the college track,"
said Dauber in an interview with
The Daily.
The 'achievement gap'
The achievement gap refers
to a gap in scores, the number of
students matriculating to college
and overall academic perform
ance between ethnic and income
groups. There has been a long
history of such a gap between

white and Asian students and
black and Hispanic students in
Palo Alto and a similar gap be
tween affluent and economically
disadvantaged students.
Those gaps are embarrassing
for the district, which ranks 147 th
and 114 th in California by the
percentage of African-American
and economically disadvantaged
students proficient in Algebra 11,
according to Stanford education
professor Jo Boaler.

By contrast, white students
are 10th and Asian students are
third.

The rate of minority Palo Alto
students eligible to attend a Uni
versity of California (UC) or
California State University
(CSU) school is significantly
lower than that of non-minority
students. Most minority students
in Palo Alto fail to complete an
A-G curriculum, the curriculum
required by the UC and CSU
systems to be eligible to attend.
Last year, almost 80 percent
of students in the district gradu
ated having met the A-G re
quirements. But there are vast
racial divides. Only 40 percent of
Latinos graduated meeting those
same requirements. For African-
Americans, that number was 15
percent.

"That's pretty shocking,"
Boaler said.

Low test scores
According to 2011 California
Star Test (CST) scores, only 7
percent of black students passed
the CST for Algebra II with a
proficient or above. The rate
among Hispanic students was 33
percent, while white students
passed with 65 percent and
Asian students passed with 86
percent.
Only 33 percent of students
classified as economically disad
vantaged passed the CST for Al
gebra 11. Compared to the 275
Asian students and 461 white
students, only 15 black students
and 30 Hispanic students sat for
the test.
Current PAUSD initiatives to
bridge the gap include counsel
ing, intervention classes and ex
panding preschools for at risk
students.
"Solving these issues is like
curing cancer; it's going to take a
lot of different issues and there
are no magic bullets here," said
Kevin Skelly, superintendent of
PAUSD.

Dauber called for more pro
fessional development for Palo
Alto teachers.

"They have very low expecta
tions for these kids and that's re
flected in the performance that
the kids give, so we need to

change the expectations,"
Dauber said.
Graduation requirements
Parents raised the issue of this

'bifurcation' of schools in Palo
Alto in December, when they re
sponded to an ongoing debate


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
2011 California Star Test data showed only 7 percent of black students,
33 percent of Hispanic students and 33 percent of economically disadvantaged
Palo Alto Unified School District students passed the CST for
Algebra 11. The district is debating how to address the achievment gap.
