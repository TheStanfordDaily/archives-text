## Nat'l identity from history, says fellow 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
"Our images of other people, of our
selves, reflect the history we are taught as
children. This history marks us for life,"
said Mario Carretero, quoting French his
torian Marc Ferro before an audience in
Levinthal Flail on Tuesday evening.
Carretero, a professor of psychology at
Autonomous University of Madrid, gave a
presentation on "Historical Narratives
and the Construction of National Identi
ties" at the Stanford Humanities Center,
where he is currently a research fellow.
Carretero is studying how young peo
ple develop historical consciousness and
how they understand history. Instead of
dissecting textbooks to analyze this con
cept, he conducts interviews with adoles
cents and observes them in real-life situa
tions to understand the dynamics of cul
tural transmission and resistance,

place when we are children," Car
retero said.
According to Carretero, histo
ry education encompasses more
than textbooks: museums, nation
al attractions and even television
series are mediums that relay his
torical information to children. In
fact, the history written in school
textbooks is not necessarily the
history that children and young
adults know, Carretero said.

Carretero mentioned the dif
ference between the histories of
wars as accounted in various
countries.
"It might seem obvious, but it is
actually much more interesting
than it first appears, because that
means millions and millions of
children in the world are getting
different narratives for the same
historical event."
Carretero had three different
classifications for history: every
day history, school history and ac
ademic history.
"Everyday history" is a collec
tive narrative of common stories
from everyday people that are not

covered by "academic history," he
said. "School history" is the mate
rial covered in primary and sec
ondary education.
"School history has a lot to do
with everyday history and nation
al identities," Carretero ex
plained.
In school, the nation is present
ed in a very static way, instead of as
a changing entity, Carretero said.
He found that national narrative
in schools is based on a number of
factors: 1) a preliminary identifi
cation process (using the word
"we" in a sentence such as, "We
defeated the British during the
American Revolution"); 2) exclu

sion-inclusion logical operations
(using the word "they" when talk
ing about other nations or coun-
a heroic character (where
the problem is when the historical
characters become myth); 4) the
search for freedom and territory
as a main and common theme; and
5) the use of the narratives as
moral cues and models.
Carretero's research found that
there is not much difference in the
historical perspective of adoles
cents between 12 and 18, which is
why an understanding of the con
cept of a nation is so important.
"If there is no conceptual
change, our minds will not change,

and there will be no progress,"
Carretero concluded.

Carretero's recent book, "Con
structing Patriotism: Teaching His
tory and Memories in Global
Worlds," discusses the ways in
which historical knowledge is un
derstood by students from ages 12
to 18. The book was published in
Spanish but has been translated
into English, Portuguese and
French.

Carretero's residency at Stan
ford will continue through Febru
ary.
