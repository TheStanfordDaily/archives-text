## Faculty react to State of the Union address 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
"We can either settle for a country where
a shrinking number of people do really well,
while a growing number of Americans barely
get by. Or we can restore an economy where
everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their
fair share and everyone plays by the same set
of rules," said President Barack Obama in
Tuesday's State of the Union address, identi
fying income inequality as the "defining issue
of our time."

About 100 freshmen gathered in Wilbur
Dining to hear about this defining issue, and
others issues President Obama touched upon
in his address to Congress, through a panel
discussion with Stanford faculty members
from various disciplines.

The panel, organized by Otero Residen
tial Assistant (RA) Adrienne Pon 'l2 and
supported by Residential Education, fol
lowed a viewing of the Presidential address in
the Otero lounge.

Among the discussion participants were:
Nobel Prize-winning economist and Profes
sor Emeritus Kenneth Arrow; Associate Pro
fessor of Political Science Adam Bonica; Vis
iting Scholar at the Hoover Institution and
Assistant Professor of Political Science at the
University of North Florida Michael Binder;
Director of the Martin Luther King, Jr., Re
search and Education Institute and Professor
of History Clayborne Carson; former Special
Adviser to Gov. Schwarzenegger and Lectur
er in Public Policy David Crane; Research
Fellow at the Hoover Institution and Lectur
er in Political Science Tammy Frisby; former
Assistant to the President for Economic Pol
icy and Director of the National Economic
Council Keith Hennessey; and Pulitzer Prize
winning history and Professor of History
David Kennedy.

Kennedy opened the discussion by com
menting on the high turnout.
"Your response in these numbers is a pow
erful antidote to my nagging suspicion that
this generation does not care about politics,"

Kennedy said.
Kennedy moved to frame Obama's
speech within the historical framework of the
State of the Union address. The speech, deliv
ered by George Washington and John Adams
in person later became a written report under
Thomas Jefferson, and remained so until
Woodrow Wilson's 1913 address.

Kennedy also commented on the change
in function of the tradition.

"Virtually everything else in the address
was not reportorial about the state of the
union it was aspirational about where the
president wants to go," Kennedy said. "This
address has become less a retrospective re
flection on the state of the union and more a
platform for the president to lay out his pro
gram for the future."
Carson, who missed the first 15 minutes of
the address due to the birth of his first grand
son, was not optimistic about the address'
prospects for change.
