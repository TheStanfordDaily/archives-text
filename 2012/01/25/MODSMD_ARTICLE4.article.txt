## Faculty react to State of the Union address 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
"We can either settle for a country where
a shrinking number of people do really well,
while a growing number of Americans barely
get by. Or we can restore an economy where
everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their
fair share and everyone plays by the same set
of rules," said President Barack Obama in
Tuesday's State of the Union address, identi
fying income inequality as the "defining issue
of our time."

About 100 freshmen gathered in Wilbur
Dining to hear about this defining issue, and
others issues President Obama touched upon
in his address to Congress, through a panel
discussion with Stanford faculty members
from various disciplines.

The panel, organized by Otero Residen
tial Assistant (RA) Adrienne Pon 'l2 and
supported by Residential Education, fol
lowed a viewing of the Presidential address in
the Otero lounge.

Among the discussion participants were:
Nobel Prize-winning economist and Profes
sor Emeritus Kenneth Arrow; Associate Pro
fessor of Political Science Adam Bonica; Vis
iting Scholar at the Hoover Institution and
Assistant Professor of Political Science at the
University of North Florida Michael Binder;
Director of the Martin Luther King, Jr., Re
search and Education Institute and Professor
of History Clayborne Carson; former Special
Adviser to Gov. Schwarzenegger and Lectur
er in Public Policy David Crane; Research
Fellow at the Hoover Institution and Lectur
er in Political Science Tammy Frisby; former
Assistant to the President for Economic Pol
icy and Director of the National Economic
Council Keith Hennessey; and Pulitzer Prize
winning history and Professor of History
David Kennedy.

Kennedy opened the discussion by com
menting on the high turnout.
"Your response in these numbers is a pow
erful antidote to my nagging suspicion that
this generation does not care about politics,"

Kennedy said.
Kennedy moved to frame Obama's
speech within the historical framework of the
State of the Union address. The speech, deliv
ered by George Washington and John Adams
in person later became a written report under
Thomas Jefferson, and remained so until
Woodrow Wilson's 1913 address.

Kennedy also commented on the change
in function of the tradition.

"Virtually everything else in the address
was not reportorial about the state of the
union it was aspirational about where the
president wants to go," Kennedy said. "This
address has become less a retrospective re
flection on the state of the union and more a
platform for the president to lay out his pro
gram for the future."
Carson, who missed the first 15 minutes of
the address due to the birth of his first grand
son, was not optimistic about the address'
prospects for change.

Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winners, former gubernatorial and presidential advisers and Hoover Institute fellows were among the Stanford faculty invited to speak in Wilbur
Dining following President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday night. Roughly 100 freshmen attended the event organized by Otero staff.
"I would agree with practically
everything he proposed but I'm not
at all that hopeful that it's going to
have any dramatic impact," said
Carson.
Hennessey spoke next, com
menting on the phenomenon of a
Congressional "date night" at the
address. This recent trend, in which
a Republican and a Democrat sit
together as a show of bipartisan
ship, drew his attention during
Obama's speech.
"One thing to remember is that
this is an election year and typically
in election year state of the union
addresses you will hear the word
'choice' a lot," he said. "When the
president is talking about 'we can
move forward ... or we can go
back' to the horrible things that
caused the financial crisis he is
framing that choice."
Hennessey also commented on
Obama's "signals," singling out
taxes on the rich, alternative ener
gy, education and American manu
facturing.
"He [Obama] was prioritizing
things that he would argue are im
portant over what I think are the ur
gent concerns that are facing people
right now and that I think is a strate
gic choice," Hennessey said.
Obama's remarks on interna
tional trade prompted some dis
agreement between the panelists.
Hennessey held that they were
"very provocative," "dangerous"
and "risked a trade war," whereas
Arrow described them as a natural
reaction in a time of depression.
Frisbee criticized Obama's
speechwriters and the "clunky" na
ture of some parts of the speech
but favorably noted his closing
"grand narrative" about Ameri
cans "having each others' backs."
"A lot of Republicans are un
derestimating the challenge that
lies ahead in campaigning against
President Obama," Frisbee said.
"This is going to be a tough elec
tion, in my view."
Against Hennessey and Fris
bee's Republican backgrounds.
Crane compared his relationship
with Obama as a "devoted Demo
crat" to a relationship with an old
girlfriend.

"I fell in love with him in 2008,1
saw in him exactly what I wanted
to see," Crane said. "It was mad
dening over the next few years
when he didn't turn out to be the

person I thought he was."
He agreed with Frisbee about
the strength of Obama's final pas
sage, "This Nation is great because
we built it together. This Nation is
great because we worked as a
team. This Nation is great because
we get each other's backs."
Yet Crane returned to his girl
friend metaphor, saying of his in
ternal dialogue, "I quickly recov
ered to say 'Don't be fooled
again!"'
He criticized Obama's intro
duction of a Financial Crimes Unit
as a late fix.
"Tonight's speech was nothing
but a reelection speech," Crane
said. "He pretty much hit every
constituency he had to hit... he
hit a lot of electoral districts in the
country, hit Iran, hit Israel, hit the
troops, the veteran's administra
tion, teachers student loans, out
sourcing."
The last speaker, Mike Binder,
took a forward-looking approach
to the speech, expanding on the
lessons it gave for the upcoming
Presidential election.
"From a Democrat perspective,
the grand vision of American ex
ceptionalism at the end is like fell
back in love with my ex-girlfriend,"
said Binder, borrowing Crane's
metaphor.
"From a Republican perspec
tive, you look and say 'This guy's
serious, how are we going to run
against this in the fall?"' Binder
added. The lesson to be drawn, he
argued, was that Obama is at his
best when talking about "grand vi
sions," but faltered when it came to
the minutiae.
"If the Republicans can frame
this debate on policy, specific poli
cy technical issues then I think the
Republicans are in much better
shape," Binder said.
"What does this mean for the
republican primary? Who might
be best at framing the debate that
way?" Binder added. "It might be
worth considering Newt Gingrich."
The panel was followed by a
Q&A session in which the panelists
stressed to the mainly freshman au
dience the value of taking advan
tage of opportunities at Stanford to
interact with faculty outside the
classroom.

platform for the president to lay out his pro
gram for the future."
Carson, who missed the first 15 minutes of
the address due to the birth of his first grand
son, was not optimistic about the address'
prospects for change.

Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winners, former gubernatorial and presidential advisers and Hoover Institute fellows were among the Stanford faculty invited to speak in Wilbur
Dining following President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday night. Roughly 100 freshmen attended the event organized by Otero staff.
"I would agree with practically
everything he proposed but I'm not
at all that hopeful that it's going to
have any dramatic impact," said
Carson.
Hennessey spoke next, com
menting on the phenomenon of a
Congressional "date night" at the
address. This recent trend, in which
a Republican and a Democrat sit
together as a show of bipartisan
ship, drew his attention during
Obama's speech.
"One thing to remember is that
this is an election year and typically
in election year state of the union
addresses you will hear the word
'choice' a lot," he said. "When the
president is talking about 'we can
move forward ... or we can go
back' to the horrible things that
caused the financial crisis he is
framing that choice."
Hennessey also commented on
Obama's "signals," singling out
taxes on the rich, alternative ener
gy, education and American manu
facturing.
"He [Obama] was prioritizing
things that he would argue are im
portant over what I think are the ur
gent concerns that are facing people
right now and that I think is a strate
gic choice," Hennessey said.
Obama's remarks on interna
tional trade prompted some dis
agreement between the panelists.
Hennessey held that they were
"very provocative," "dangerous"
and "risked a trade war," whereas
Arrow described them as a natural
reaction in a time of depression.
Frisbee criticized Obama's
speechwriters and the "clunky" na
ture of some parts of the speech
but favorably noted his closing
"grand narrative" about Ameri
cans "having each others' backs."
"A lot of Republicans are un
derestimating the challenge that
lies ahead in campaigning against
President Obama," Frisbee said.
"This is going to be a tough elec
tion, in my view."
Against Hennessey and Fris
bee's Republican backgrounds.
Crane compared his relationship
with Obama as a "devoted Demo
crat" to a relationship with an old
girlfriend.

"I fell in love with him in 2008,1
saw in him exactly what I wanted
to see," Crane said. "It was mad
dening over the next few years
when he didn't turn out to be the

person I thought he was."
He agreed with Frisbee about
the strength of Obama's final pas
sage, "This Nation is great because
we built it together. This Nation is
great because we worked as a
team. This Nation is great because
we get each other's backs."
Yet Crane returned to his girl
friend metaphor, saying of his in
ternal dialogue, "I quickly recov
ered to say 'Don't be fooled
again!"'
He criticized Obama's intro
duction of a Financial Crimes Unit
as a late fix.
"Tonight's speech was nothing
but a reelection speech," Crane
said. "He pretty much hit every
constituency he had to hit... he
hit a lot of electoral districts in the
country, hit Iran, hit Israel, hit the
troops, the veteran's administra
tion, teachers student loans, out
sourcing."
The last speaker, Mike Binder,
took a forward-looking approach
to the speech, expanding on the
lessons it gave for the upcoming
Presidential election.
"From a Democrat perspective,
the grand vision of American ex
ceptionalism at the end is like fell
back in love with my ex-girlfriend,"
said Binder, borrowing Crane's
metaphor.
"From a Republican perspec
tive, you look and say 'This guy's
serious, how are we going to run
against this in the fall?"' Binder
added. The lesson to be drawn, he
argued, was that Obama is at his
best when talking about "grand vi
sions," but faltered when it came to
the minutiae.
"If the Republicans can frame
this debate on policy, specific poli
cy technical issues then I think the
Republicans are in much better
shape," Binder said.
"What does this mean for the
republican primary? Who might
be best at framing the debate that
way?" Binder added. "It might be
worth considering Newt Gingrich."
The panel was followed by a
Q&A session in which the panelists
stressed to the mainly freshman au
dience the value of taking advan
tage of opportunities at Stanford to
interact with faculty outside the
classroom.

"We can either settle for a country where
a shrinking number of people do really well,
while a growing number of Americans barely
get by. Or we can restore an economy where
everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their
fair share and everyone plays by the same set
of rules," said President Barack Obama in
Tuesday's State of the Union address, identi
fying income inequality as the "defining issue
of our time."

About 100 freshmen gathered in Wilbur
Dining to hear about this defining issue, and
others issues President Obama touched upon
in his address to Congress, through a panel
discussion with Stanford faculty members
from various disciplines.

The panel, organized by Otero Residen
tial Assistant (RA) Adrienne Pon 'l2 and
supported by Residential Education, fol
lowed a viewing of the Presidential address in
the Otero lounge.

Among the discussion participants were:
Nobel Prize-winning economist and Profes
sor Emeritus Kenneth Arrow; Associate Pro
fessor of Political Science Adam Bonica; Vis
iting Scholar at the Hoover Institution and
Assistant Professor of Political Science at the
University of North Florida Michael Binder;
Director of the Martin Luther King, Jr., Re
search and Education Institute and Professor
of History Clayborne Carson; former Special
Adviser to Gov. Schwarzenegger and Lectur
er in Public Policy David Crane; Research
Fellow at the Hoover Institution and Lectur
er in Political Science Tammy Frisby; former
Assistant to the President for Economic Pol
icy and Director of the National Economic
Council Keith Hennessey; and Pulitzer Prize
winning history and Professor of History
David Kennedy.

Kennedy opened the discussion by com
menting on the high turnout.
"Your response in these numbers is a pow
erful antidote to my nagging suspicion that
this generation does not care about politics,"

Kennedy said.
Kennedy moved to frame Obama's
speech within the historical framework of the
State of the Union address. The speech, deliv
ered by George Washington and John Adams
in person later became a written report under
Thomas Jefferson, and remained so until
Woodrow Wilson's 1913 address.

Kennedy also commented on the change
in function of the tradition.

"Virtually everything else in the address
was not reportorial about the state of the
union it was aspirational about where the
president wants to go," Kennedy said. "This
address has become less a retrospective re
flection on the state of the union and more a
platform for the president to lay out his pro
gram for the future."
