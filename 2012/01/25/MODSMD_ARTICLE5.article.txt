### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
(UGS) held a closed, informal session be
fore an abbreviated formal meeting Tues
day evening. In the informal session, the
senators discussed recent money disburse
ments from the ASSU student fees buffer
fund.

Senate chair Rafael Vazquez 'l2 asked
The Daily to leave for the informal meet-

ing, which was attended by senators as well
as Nanci Howe, director of Student Activi
ties and Leadership (SAL), Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 and Cameron Henry 'l2 and
Ashley Lyle 'l3. Trusheim and Henry are
both responsible for independently acquir
ing significant funding from the ASSU
buffer fund through Senate bills for a

spring concert series and Blackfest, respec
tively.

Senator Dan DeLong 'l3 said that the
meeting was to discuss the lack of guide
lines about how the buffer fund should be
used and the perceived inequity between
giving the spring concert $35,000 in funding
while deciding to loan Blackfest $40,000
