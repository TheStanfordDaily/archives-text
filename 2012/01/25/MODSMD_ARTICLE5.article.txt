## ASSU Senate discusses buffer fund inequity 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
(UGS) held a closed, informal session be
fore an abbreviated formal meeting Tues
day evening. In the informal session, the
senators discussed recent money disburse
ments from the ASSU student fees buffer
fund.

Senate chair Rafael Vazquez 'l2 asked
The Daily to leave for the informal meet-

ing, which was attended by senators as well
as Nanci Howe, director of Student Activi
ties and Leadership (SAL), Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 and Cameron Henry 'l2 and
Ashley Lyle 'l3. Trusheim and Henry are
both responsible for independently acquir
ing significant funding from the ASSU
buffer fund through Senate bills for a

spring concert series and Blackfest, respec
tively.

Senator Dan DeLong 'l3 said that the
meeting was to discuss the lack of guide
lines about how the buffer fund should be
used and the perceived inequity between
giving the spring concert $35,000 in funding
while deciding to loan Blackfest $40,000
and require repayment.
For each of the events, revenue
will be used to help fund future
concerts at Stanford, DeLong
confirmed.
Trusheim wanted an assurance
from the Senate about the
$35,000 grant he received because
the concert organizers are cur
rently working on booking artists
and need an exact budget.

The Senate assured Trusheim
that the $35,000 allocation would
remain, and also agreed to re-ex
amine the $40,000 loan to Black

fest in light of the inequity.
The official meeting started
with a brief update from ASSU
Executive Michael Cruz 'l2. Sen
ator Ben Laufer 'l2 asked Cruz
about how the governing docu
ments commission is progressing.
Cruz said he did not feel com
fortable sharing details of the pro
visional plans for the new consti
tution in a public forum; however,
he said he hopes to have a private
version available to the Senate
and several other individuals in
two weeks.
When Howe raised concerns
about the ASSU elections sched
ule and how it may conflict with
the new constitution, Cruz as
sured her that the constitution
would go into effect after this

year's elections.
DeLong updated Senators on
his recently launched One-on-
One Advocacy Program, which
he said has already fielded and re
solved a few concerns.
The only bill passed at the
meeting was to approve three
representatives to the Vaden Ad
visory Council. Tara Trujillo 'l4,
Lily Fu 'l4 and Baffour Kyere
maten 'l5 were approved to the
positions. Trujillo and Fu are both
Senators, and Kyerematen is a
mentee in the Leadership Devel
opment Program (LDP), a men
torship program organized by the
UGS.
