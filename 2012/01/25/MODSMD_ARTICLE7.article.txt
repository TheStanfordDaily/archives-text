## PROFILE FLYING THE CO-OP 
### CHRIS FREDERICK 
Nicole Heinl 'l3 was
turned off by what
she heard about co
ops as a freshman.
"Something about communal
showering and excessive drug
use," she wrote in an email to The
Daily.
Now, as co-op manager of
Hammarskjold House, Heinl has
a different perspective.
"In no other place on campus
have I found a group of people so
willing to have a conversation
about anything or go do wacky
things," she said.
While each co-op has a unique
reputation, they all offer what the
Office of Residential Education
calls "an alternative to Stanford
dorm life." On campus, there are
seven of them: Columbae, Syner
gy, Hammarskjold, Terra, Chi
Theta Chi (XOX), Kairos and En
chanted Broccoli Forest (EBF).
One of the first co-ops, Colum
bae, was named after the Latin
word for "dove" and was founded
in 1970 to promote nonviolence
and counter the turbulent tem
perament that helped spawn mas
sive protests and violence on cam
pus.
"Non-violence is more a style
of life than a theme," Dave De-
Wolf '7l said to The Daily in May
1970.
"The central idea of the house
is to live at a materially simple
level; to reflect beliefs that people
shouldn't exploit each other and
the natural environment," De-
Wolf said. "We don't want to live
off of other people's backs."
Synergy came next, in 1972, in
spired by a class on alternative
lifestyles.
Bringing alternative housing

to Stanford wasn't easy, however,
and not all attempts were success
ful. One early co-op organizer
complained to The Daily in May
1970, "It has been a long and
drawn-out process to get Univer
sity approval for the house and to
hassle out subsequent red tape."
Of course, there has always
been more to co-ops than peace
and love. From the beginning, co
ops were motivated by a more
mundane concern: money. Early
co-op organizers sought to "save
money" as much as to achieve "a
sense of community living by hav
ing everyone work together," ac
cording to Dan Kent '73, M. A. '74,
P.D. 'Bl, one of the first co-op or
ganizers.

Today, those savings can be
considerable. At UCLA, for ex
ample, students save $6,700 on
room and board by choosing a co
op over a dorm, according to a
2007 U.S. News article. Co-ops

have gained popularity among
college students in the wake of the
economic crisis, and today there
are at least 240 cooperative hous
es near at least 51 United States
campuses. However, by the num
bers, UC-Berkeley remains the
indisputable champion, with 1,300
students housed in the Berkeley
Student Cooperative system.
Yet not all colleges have such
options. This fall, students at the
University of Pennsylvania
opened Penn Haven, the school's
first co-op, where eight members
share the rent of an apartment in
West Philadelphia.
"It's tough starting things from
scratch," wrote Penn junior
Meghna Chandra in an email to
The Daily.
To get some help, Chandra at
tended the annual North Ameri
can Students of Cooperation
(NASCO) Institute in Ann Arbor,
Mich.The Institute runs dozens of
workshops for co-op organizers,
including a series called "From
Roots to Shoots: Developing New
Co-ops," which, according to their
website, aspires to "walk future
co-op founders through the
process of starting a new housing
co-op."
Students tend to have similar
motivations for joining a co-op.
"I wanted to cook my own
food," wrote Synergy resident
Brittany Rymer 'l3 in an email to
The Daily. "Clean my own space.
Feel independent. You can't really
get that in a self-op or a dorm."
Steven Crane 'l2, a Synergy
resident and cooperative living
peer advisor, described a similar
experience.
"I actually had no idea [co-ops]
existed until my drawmate really
wanted to live in EBF sophomore
year," he said. "Now I thrive on
the freedom and unconventional
ity that's possible when you live in
a co-op."
Although students must per
form chores such as cooking and
cleaning, the time commitment is
relatively small about four to
five hours per week. Indeed, most
residents find chores to be an en
joyable part of the co-op experi
ence.
"They're actually a really good
way to make friends and a nice
break from class and studying,"
Rymer said.
"There's something truly satis
fying about watching a huge pile
of grimy pots and dishes trans
form into sparkling clean before
your eyes," Heinl added.
While most Stanford students
live on campus, where all seven of
ficial co-ops are located, some stu
dents seek similar arrangements
off campus. For them, the Dead
Houses are one option. Rob Lev
itsky, a wealthy electrical engi
neer, owns 10 houses in Palo Alto
that he rents to Stanford students
at below-market rates. Each
house is named after a song by the
Grateful Dead.
"As my electronics business
was successful, I put money into
buying more houses," Levitsky
said to Palo Alto Online. "It's not
necessarily the best investment,
but it's something I enjoy."
Stanford's co-op community
members find clear value in the
cooperative lifestyle, just as then
freshman Martin Keogh 'BO did in
1977, when his co-op, Columbae,
was at risk of termination. Keogh
wrote a letter to the editor of this
paper, expressing his strong opin
ion.
"Columbae offers me all the
things this school cannot; thus I
hereby state that if Columbae is
dropped I will resign from the

cookbooks, has functioned as a co-operative house since 1991.

Kairos, famous for its weekly event "Cheese," informally known as "Wine
and Cheese," moved from being a self-op to being a co-op in 1988.
