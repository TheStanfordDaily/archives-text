## EDITORIAL Restoring the prestige of teaching 
### 
Ask the Stanford Class of
2012 what they plan to do
next year, and you will re
ceive many impressive responses.
There are countless students as
piring to prestigious professions as
doctors, lawyers and academics.
There are those entering the high
tech industries of software, pro
gramming and engineering. There
are also those choosing to enter
the arenas of business, consulting
and investment banking. All of
these fields are united in their high
salaries and resultant prestige, and
it is generally no surprise when an
other bright and high-achieving
Stanford student chooses one of
these career pathways.
One answer you are less likely
to hear is that of "teacher," a pro
fession that popular opinion does
not quite equate with the others
mentioned above. Unfortunately,
the status afforded to elementary,
middle and high school teachers is
not very high, both on the Stan
ford campus as well as around the
country. A recent University news
article explores the differences be
tween the Finnish school system
and U.S. education, noting that
teachers in Finland are compared
to lawyers and doctors while
teachers in the U.S. are perceived
to be more on par with "nurses
and therapists," according to
Finnish education expert Pasi
Sahlberg.

students certainly use TEA as a
springboard to either professional
schools or different career paths,
but one should not generalize the
motives of those well-intentioned
students admitted to the TFA
corps. A study published in Octo
ber 2011 on Education Week finds
that 60.5 percent of TFA teachers
continue as public school teachers
beyond their two-year commit
ment. Whether this means that
TFA members take up a long
term career in teaching or merely
one additional year past their two
year TFA contract is unclear, but it
suggests that they are not neces
sarily ending their tenure as teach
ers with their completion of TFA.
Still, the popularity of tempo
rary teaching fellowships does not
address the root problem of low
teacher status in U.S. society. Sev
eral means of addressing teach
ing's lack of prestige have been
proffered. Kristof s suggested so
lution, based upon findings of a
McKinsey study, calls for an in
crease in teacher salaries.
Sahlberg, referring to teaching
qualifications in Finland, points
out that candidates must com
plete a three-year master's degree
before teaching. He notes that
teachers in Finland are highly cov
eted, and primary school teaching
positions are harder to obtain than
entrance to medical school.

Other authors have also ad
dressed the diminished prestige of
teachers. Pulitzer prize-winning
New York Times columnist
Nicholas Kristof remarked in a
March 2011 piece that, "We
should be elevating teachers, not
throwing darts at them." At a time
when the U.S. educational system
is losing its competitive edge
against the schools of other coun
tries, it is lamentable that the
choice to enter the teaching pro
fession is not always highly re
garded by students graduating
from elite colleges.
By "the teaching profession,"
we do not mean temporary stints
in education, such as those provid
ed by Teach For America (TFA).
Skeptics of the program remind us
that participation in TFA does not
indicate that students seek to be
teachers; indeed, last year this Ed
itorial Board highlighted the ap
peal of TFA as an organization
that "has turned education reform
into a status symbol" ("Teach for
America's Rise Reveals Need for
Options," March 9, 2011). Some

All of these possibilities
more selective admission to teach
ing positions, more stringent edu
cational requirements for teach
ers and higher teacher salaries
are essentially methods of elevat
ing status. And for better or worse,
this may be the most effective way
to make the job more appealing to
graduates of elite colleges such as
Stanford. But if we want results
that will not take their toll upon
the current educational system,
we cannot suddenly restrict ad
mission to master's programs in
education or increase the number
of years in the program. The cur
rent nationwide shortage of quali
fied teachers renders these op
tions incredibly damaging in the
short-term. Nor can schools sim
ply offer higher salaries without
cutting costs elsewhere.
More important is a shift in
mindset, a shift that will hammer
home the point to Stanford stu
dents that teaching is as noble a
profession as any other and cer
tainly one that is crucial at this

March 2011 piece that, "We

when the U.S. educational system
is losing its competitive edge

By "the teaching profession,"
we do not mean temporary stints

Skeptics of the program remind us
that participation in TFA does not
indicate that students seek to be

All of these possibilities
more selective admission to teach

are essentially methods of elevat

this may be the most effective way
to make the job more appealing to
graduates of elite colleges such as
Stanford. But if we want results
that will not take their toll upon
the current educational system,
we cannot suddenly restrict ad
mission to master's programs in
education or increase the number
of years in the program. The cur
rent nationwide shortage of quali

short-term. Nor can schools sim

cutting costs elsewhere.
More important is a shift in
mindset, a shift that will hammer
home the point to Stanford stu

these are just some possibilities.
Those students pursuing degrees
at such programs as STEP, offered

by the Stanford School of Educa
tion, should be no less proud than
their peers of their interest in a
teaching career. And for those stu
dents who would raise a question
ing eyebrow at a peer who aspires
to be a high school teacher this
is the attitude holding back the US
educational system. The change
must begin now, and it certainly
must begin at the level of elite in
stitutions such as Stanford.
Ask the Stanford Class of
2012 what they plan to do
next year, and you will re
ceive many impressive responses.
There are countless students as
piring to prestigious professions as
doctors, lawyers and academics.
There are those entering the high
tech industries of software, pro
gramming and engineering. There
are also those choosing to enter
the arenas of business, consulting
and investment banking. All of
these fields are united in their high
salaries and resultant prestige, and
it is generally no surprise when an
other bright and high-achieving
Stanford student chooses one of
these career pathways.
One answer you are less likely
to hear is that of "teacher," a pro
fession that popular opinion does
not quite equate with the others
mentioned above. Unfortunately,
the status afforded to elementary,
middle and high school teachers is
not very high, both on the Stan
ford campus as well as around the
country. A recent University news
article explores the differences be
tween the Finnish school system
and U.S. education, noting that
teachers in Finland are compared
to lawyers and doctors while
teachers in the U.S. are perceived
to be more on par with "nurses
and therapists," according to
Finnish education expert Pasi
Sahlberg.

students certainly use TEA as a
springboard to either professional
schools or different career paths,
but one should not generalize the
motives of those well-intentioned
students admitted to the TFA
corps. A study published in Octo
ber 2011 on Education Week finds
that 60.5 percent of TFA teachers
continue as public school teachers
beyond their two-year commit
ment. Whether this means that
TFA members take up a long
term career in teaching or merely
one additional year past their two
year TFA contract is unclear, but it
suggests that they are not neces
sarily ending their tenure as teach
ers with their completion of TFA.
Still, the popularity of tempo
rary teaching fellowships does not
address the root problem of low
teacher status in U.S. society. Sev
eral means of addressing teach
ing's lack of prestige have been
proffered. Kristof s suggested so
lution, based upon findings of a
McKinsey study, calls for an in
crease in teacher salaries.
Sahlberg, referring to teaching
qualifications in Finland, points
out that candidates must com
plete a three-year master's degree
before teaching. He notes that
teachers in Finland are highly cov
eted, and primary school teaching
positions are harder to obtain than
entrance to medical school.
