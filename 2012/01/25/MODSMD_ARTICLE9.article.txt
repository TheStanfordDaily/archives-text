## Back to the futurist As a senior in college, my future has never been as unclear, or as terrifying, as it is now. 
### Amanda Ach 
There are many scary things in
the world birds, small
spaces, the thought of run
ning out of Doritos but the
scariest of all might be the future.
And coming from me, that's really
saying something, because I have a
legitimate bird phobia. I think they
are terrifying creatures (pigeons
especially), and I strongly dislike
them. But back to my point the
fact of the matter is, the future can
be scary. As a senior in college, my
future has never been as unclear,
and therefore as terrifying, as it is
now. For most of my life, I've pretty
much known what was coming
next. In kindergarten, it was first
grade. In high school, there was col
lege. But now, there are a million
options, and as exciting as that is, it's
also just as scary. As I'm sure I've
mentioned many times, I have no
idea what I will be doing next year.
Right now, it seems like my life is
just going to drop off into some
kind of a black hole come June, and
that's not the most comforting
thought. Most of us want to know
what life has in store for us, and
we're not alone. Plenty of people
dedicate their lives to knowing the
future psychics, fortune-tellers
but unfortunately (pun intend
ed), most of these people can't ac
tually see into the future. That is,
with one exception: the futurist,
which will be this week's column
topic.

I'm aware that a futurist sounds
like a made-up job from a bad sci-fi
movie, but it's really not. Essential
ly, the job of a futurist is to analyze
data from the present and past to
form theories about the future of
humanity (no big deal). As a futur
ist, you would work in a consulting
role with companies or the govern
ment, helping them prepare for
where the human race is headed.

One of the great things about a
career as a futurist is that because
people want to know so many dif
ferent things about the future, you
can focus on almost anything, from
population issues and human
health to economics and climate
change policy. Anything with po
tential impact on humanity is fair
game. Your job would be to identi
fy the future problems in whatever
field you're interested in and sug

gest ways for humans, companies
or the government to adapt that
will prevent those problems from
arising.

This isn't some crystal-ball
holding, tarot-card-reading gig
it's a highly academic discipline.
There's a Twitter account and
everything. But in all seriousness, a
career as a futurist is both intellec
tually stimulating and demanding.
This means you will need at least an
undergraduate degree in a relevant
field, and certain concentrations
will require even more schooling,
such as economics and health-re
lated issues. Given the nature of the
job you'll be doing, a good futurist
will be someone who enjoys cre
ative problem-solving, recognizing
patterns in data and seeing both the
big and little pictures. Also, some
interest in the future of humanity
could be considered a bonus.

In the end, though, it's worth it.
Not only will you be making a six
figure salary within your first few
years as a futurist, but you will also
be applying all that academic
knowledge you've acquired over
your years here at Stanford to real
life problems. It's no wonder the
field of future-consulting has ex
ploded recently, with literally
dozens of future-consulting firms
in the United States alone, not to
mention several in Europe. This
means that if you see yourself as a

future futurist (I couldn't help my
self), you will have the luxury of
choosing not only your focus area
but where you want to live as well.
Ultimately, being a futurist isn't
so much a job title as it is away of
turning an academic interest into a
successful career. With the salary
and flexibility, not to mention the
field's unique growth in this econo
my, it's a great path to pursue. Last
ly and this is just a tiny little in
significant side note you'll be
helping to ensure the future of our
species.

Right now, it seems like my life is
just going to drop off into some
kind of a black hole come June, and
that's not the most comforting
thought. Most of us want to know
what life has in store for us, and
we're not alone. Plenty of people
dedicate their lives to knowing the
future psychics, fortune-tellers
but unfortunately (pun intend
ed), most of these people can't ac
tually see into the future. That is,
with one exception: the futurist,
which will be this week's column
topic.

I'm aware that a futurist sounds
like a made-up job from a bad sci-fi
movie, but it's really not. Essential
ly, the job of a futurist is to analyze
data from the present and past to
form theories about the future of
humanity (no big deal). As a futur
ist, you would work in a consulting
role with companies or the govern
ment, helping them prepare for
where the human race is headed.

One of the great things about a
career as a futurist is that because
people want to know so many dif
ferent things about the future, you
can focus on almost anything, from
population issues and human
health to economics and climate
change policy. Anything with po
tential impact on humanity is fair
game. Your job would be to identi
fy the future problems in whatever
field you're interested in and sug

gest ways for humans, companies
or the government to adapt that
will prevent those problems from
arising.

This isn't some crystal-ball
holding, tarot-card-reading gig
it's a highly academic discipline.
There's a Twitter account and
everything. But in all seriousness, a
career as a futurist is both intellec
tually stimulating and demanding.
This means you will need at least an
undergraduate degree in a relevant
field, and certain concentrations
will require even more schooling,
such as economics and health-re
lated issues. Given the nature of the
job you'll be doing, a good futurist
will be someone who enjoys cre
ative problem-solving, recognizing
patterns in data and seeing both the
big and little pictures. Also, some
interest in the future of humanity
could be considered a bonus.

In the end, though, it's worth it.
Not only will you be making a six
figure salary within your first few
years as a futurist, but you will also
be applying all that academic
knowledge you've acquired over
your years here at Stanford to real
life problems. It's no wonder the
field of future-consulting has ex
ploded recently, with literally
dozens of future-consulting firms
in the United States alone, not to
mention several in Europe. This
means that if you see yourself as a

future futurist (I couldn't help my
self), you will have the luxury of
choosing not only your focus area
but where you want to live as well.
Ultimately, being a futurist isn't
so much a job title as it is away of
turning an academic interest into a
successful career. With the salary
and flexibility, not to mention the
field's unique growth in this econo
my, it's a great path to pursue. Last
ly and this is just a tiny little in
significant side note you'll be
helping to ensure the future of our
species.
