We invite you to join us for an unforgettable concert with
world music fusionist Hamed Nikpay. At the forefront of
experimental music, Nikpay has a passion for his innovative
genre that is embedded in his solid knowledge of the
fundamentals of Persian music, his ability to perform on
numerous Eastern instruments masterfully, and his incisive
interpretation and selection of Persian poetry for his songs.
His love of Persian music motivated him to learn and play
many musical instruments revered in the culture—tar, setar,
tanbour, oud, and daf, all of which he plays expertly and
soulfully. Nikpay has also performed as a fusion vocalist,
and has produced three albums: Soto Passage, All Is Calm,
and Spellbound,
