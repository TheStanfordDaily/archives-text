# Study spot scoop
## 
### â€”Ann Tyler Moses 
Come exam time, the
second floor cubbies in
Green Library and the
booths of Meyer are
overflowing, and a bit
more creativity than usual is re
quired when choosing a place to
hunker down and hammer out
looming assignments. Asking a
Stanford student about his or her
favorite study spot can be like ask
ing a magician to reveal his secrets,
but some were willing to divulge
their cherished study spaces for the
greater good.
Privacy and quiet are key fac
tors for most students in choosing
their perfect location. Libraries
other than Green and Meyer can
be good choices: distractions can
be avoided without descending
into the spine-tingling depths of
the South Stacks.

"The Cubberley Library is an
intense environment to get work
done," said Kersten Schnurle 'll
M.S. 'l2. "There aren't that many
people there, and it's centrally lo
cated."

Another peaceful, relatively
under-utilized spot is the patio on
the second floor of the Law

School.
"I like to study there, next to the
fountain," said Chana Rabinovitz
'l3. "The trickling sound is nice.
The first floor with all the tables is
usually social and noisy, but it
seems like the second floor is un
derstood to be a place to study."
Students seeking more isola
tion might do well to think even
further outside the box and out
side the confines of a building.
"I don't really study that often,"
joked Theo Roth 'l4. "But when I
do, it's in a nook or on the roof."
Seclusion does, however, in
crease the chance of succumbing
to the bane of all college studying:
falling asleep. For students who
need to be held publicly account
able to stay awake, a busy and visi
ble location like campus eater
ies or outdoor spots that put peo
ple on display may be the best
choice.

"I think any of the counters at
CoFlo are pretty good, because
people can see if you're actually
working," said Akiko Kozato 'l3.
"Any place you can fall asleep is a
trap."
