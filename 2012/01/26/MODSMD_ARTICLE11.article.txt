# OPINIONS
## DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF The 						weight 
### Leslie Brian 
As you'll recall by now,
my illustrious powers of
rhetorical charm have
you all fawning over my every
word two weeks ago, I wrote
on New Years resolutions. In a
slick 800-word essay, I extolled
the virtue of taking things in
stride, so that one turbocharged
week of adrenaline wouldn't
leave you burned out for the rest
of the year. "Start slowly, and
give yourself time to adjust to
new habits," was the exact word
ing, I believe.

A mere one week later, the
title of my Jan. 12 column (any
one?) has come back to haunt
me: "The More Things Change,
the More Things Stay the Same."
Last Thursday, I found myself up
to my ears in hyper-anxiety. Once
again, history was repeating itself
and I had taken on too much. For
once in my life, I wasn't procras
tinating (that much) or prioritiz
ing the wrong tasks. No matter
how much I accomplished, this
monstrous wave of to-dos and as
signments and meetings kept
looming larger and larger behind
me, and it was only a matter of
time before its crest broke and
swept me out to sea with it.
Okay, a little dramatic, I
admit. But I literally felt like I
was drowning.

I started to freak out. Quite
simply, there wasn't enough time
in the day to do it all. If only my
life existed on two separate
tracks. My jam-packed schedule
of 20 units and two thousand ex
tracurriculars would work out
swimmingly if I could just get my
social and personal life to exist in
some parallel universe. With two
24-hour clocks running side by
side, I'd be golden.
I knew something had to give.
But part of me was still desper
ately trying to hold onto all my
classes and activities and outside
interests and do it all.
But then I started to think
about it more. Why was I doing
this to myself? What was I trying
to prove? What was the point?
Would dropping a class or back
ing out of a club symbolize that I
was a slacker?

I was making things harder on
myself than they needed to be.
But that's not too unusual. Tak
ing the easier path is not some
thing people at Stanford choose
to do. We live at the extremes. If
things are comfortable, we must
not be pushing hard enough. If
there's free time in our day, we
need to fill it with something
productive. After all, why take 15
units when you could take 18?
It's the old Puritan work ethic,
applauding the virtue in working
yourself to the bone and tough
ing out hardship. The more we
can endure, the stronger, better
and more moral we are.

But is taking on an additional
challenge always the right an-

swer? After all, life throws us
enough curveballs without our
insisting that we bat left-handed
(if you get what I'm trying to
say). Trust me, life will present its
fair share of challenges. When
they come, we must struggle
valiantly and fight the good fight;
but to struggle for the sake of
struggling is just, well, pointless.
In that way, we are our own
worst enemies, seeking out bat
tles that don't necessarily need
to be fought. In love, in life, in
school, we sabotage ourselves.
(Why do you think we're attract
ed to people we seemingly can't
have instead of what's right in
front of us?) It seems that com
fortable living is a luxury we
can't afford.
I know I write about the same
thing every single week (hey,
that's part of my charm, right?),
but that's because living in bal
ance is one of the most difficult
things to do. We all need remind
ing to stay centered, especially
when it's easier and more normal
to live in a world of extremes.
And we all need reminding, day
to-day and week-to-week. Per
haps no one more so than myself.
When I do my weekly variations
on the theme of balance, it's as
much to keep myself on track as
it is for everyone else.
So with that in mind, here's
something to take away for the
week: let your life be easy when
it can be. Just because you can
take something on doesn't nec
essarily mean you should. Like
wise, just because something is in
your power doesn't mean you
have to do it. We deserve to be
relaxed enough every day to stop
for a five-minute impromptu
conversation in the halls or to
enjoy dinner with a friend in
stead of working in the library.
That doesn't make us compla
cent or "weak;" that's what
makes us happy. That's some
thing I'm trying to learn that
there can be equal strength and
intensity and purpose in declin
ing a challenge as there is in ac
cepting one. At the end of the
day, it all comes down to choice
and the motivation behind your
actions, as I've probably said up
ward of a dozen times.

It's a work in progress. And
you can bet I'll be back next week,
updating you on the journey.

But don't worry, dear reader, Leslie
always has time for you. Help her
procrastinate a little bit more by
