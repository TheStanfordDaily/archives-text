# Do's AND Doo-Doo's
## Finding joy in a hamster-eat-hamster world 
### Chase Ishii 
On Oct. 20, 2011, after (not
so) careful consideration
and (little to no) planning,
my roommate and I decided to
commit entirely to our friendship
and adopt two adorable, healthy
Syrian hamsters. (Well, one was
healthy, and one was incredibly
fat.) They were named Gov'na,
(pronounced "Governor," but as if
a British person is pronouncing it,)
and Emilio (as in "Emilio Estevez!
The 'Mighty Ducks' Guy!").

We loved these hamsters with
all our hearts. We stayed up late
watching them fight over their lit
tle wheel and try to chew their way
out of their tiny jail-I-mean-cage.
We worried whether they would
get teased by their little hamster
classmates once they started ham
ster school. (Not for having two
multi-racial fathers, but for having
two multi-racial fathers that gave
them incredibly ridiculous names.)
But on winter quarter's eve,
tragedy struck. (Disclaimer: if you
are squeamish, you should proba
bly skip to the next paragraph. You
also probably shouldn't text me
asking for a picture.) I awoke to
find that Emilio, to put it bluntly,
had eaten Gov'na's head. I don't
know if it was in self-defense or for
survival or some alpha-hamster
complex, but what I do know is
that Mr. Pet Smart Guy, who prom
ised us they would be fine in a cage
together, was bloody wrong. Which
brings us to this week's Do's and
Doo-Doo's...

DO: Attend the campus-wide
memorial for Gov'na this Monday
Night at Yost. Please wear all
black. (I don't know if memorial
gifts are a thing, but they will be
gladly accepted.)

DOO-DOO: Consume the
people around you.
Without drawing too many par
allels to human nature out of a
story about hamsters, I think there
is an element of truth here. We all

act harshly and destructively to
ward others out of our own pride,
fear, jealousy, comfort and desire
for personal gain. (Or at least I
think we all do. Right? Shoot, I
hope it's not just me,)

And a lot of times, it's not even
intentional. There are so many
times I've been impatient and
short with people ("short" refer
ring to temper) because I want to
do things my way. I've let relation
ships fizzle out because I don't
want to apologize or admit that
I'm wrong. And I've given the cold
shoulder to people because I feel
too busy and overwhelmed to give
some of my time away. I honestly
try my best to love the people
around me, but far too often and
far too easily, the concept of "me"
and "my needs" gets overinflated
and consumes the needs of the
people around me. (I naively de
scribed this as "swallowing the
people around me" until someone
wisely criticized my word choice.)
I'm writing a short film right
now where the main character
wakes up every day in a different
person's life. He/she (I'm not sure
even what to call them) literally
lives life day-to-day a new life
each day. Nothing lasts conse
quences or rewards. The character
initially feels invincible and lives
selfishly; they recklessly spend
money that is not theirs in the first
place. They act inconsiderately,
knowing that the consequences
won't last past the day.
The turning point comes when
the character grows unhappy be
cause none of these immediate
joys from selfish behavior carries
from day to day. Further, they
wake up one day in the life of a per
son that has been negatively affect
ed by one of their past life's irre
sponsible behaviors. The character
suddenly realizes that his or her ac
tions have lasting consequences on
others. They begin to strive for the

betterment and happiness of oth
ers, though with the selfish aim of
bettering their future position, not
knowing who they will be the next
day. Ultimately, the character dis
covers that they receive the most
lasting joy from positively impact
ing the permanent lives of those
around them. End scene.

It requires some imagination,
but it is the best way for me to com
municate the lesson that I've
learned and continue to keep
learning (because I continually
forget.) The more we focus on the
happiness and betterment of oth
ers and the less we focus on our
own situation, the happier we will
be, I don't have the philosophical
arguments or sociological statistics
for why this works. (If someone
does, send them my way!) But I do
know that on the lucky days and
lucky moments when I can push
my joy and my truth and my fulfill
ment aside, I enter into joy, truth
and fulfillment that is so much big
ger than me.

If you count slightly cannibalistic
hamsters amongst your turn-ons,
then email Chase forthwith (RIP
Gov'na) atninjaish@stanford.edu.

We all act harshly
and destructively
toward others.

bly skip to the next paragraph. You
also probably shouldn't text me
asking for a picture.) I awoke to
find that Emilio, to put it bluntly,
had eaten Gov'na's head. I don't
know if it was in self-defense or for
survival or some alpha-hamster
complex, but what I do know is
that Mr. Pet Smart Guy, who prom
ised us they would be fine in a cage
together, was bloody wrong. Which
brings us to this week's Do's and
Doo-Doo's...

DO: Attend the campus-wide
memorial for Gov'na this Monday
Night at Yost. Please wear all
black. (I don't know if memorial
gifts are a thing, but they will be
gladly accepted.)

DOO-DOO: Consume the
people around you.
Without drawing too many par
allels to human nature out of a
story about hamsters, I think there
is an element of truth here. We all

act harshly and destructively to
ward others out of our own pride,
fear, jealousy, comfort and desire
for personal gain. (Or at least I
think we all do. Right? Shoot, I
hope it's not just me,)

And a lot of times, it's not even
intentional. There are so many
times I've been impatient and
short with people ("short" refer
ring to temper) because I want to
do things my way. I've let relation
ships fizzle out because I don't
want to apologize or admit that
I'm wrong. And I've given the cold
shoulder to people because I feel
too busy and overwhelmed to give
some of my time away. I honestly
try my best to love the people
around me, but far too often and
far too easily, the concept of "me"
and "my needs" gets overinflated
and consumes the needs of the
people around me. (I naively de
scribed this as "swallowing the
people around me" until someone
wisely criticized my word choice.)
I'm writing a short film right
now where the main character
wakes up every day in a different
person's life. He/she (I'm not sure
even what to call them) literally
lives life day-to-day a new life
each day. Nothing lasts conse
quences or rewards. The character
initially feels invincible and lives
selfishly; they recklessly spend
money that is not theirs in the first
place. They act inconsiderately,
knowing that the consequences
won't last past the day.
The turning point comes when
the character grows unhappy be
cause none of these immediate
joys from selfish behavior carries
from day to day. Further, they
wake up one day in the life of a per
son that has been negatively affect
ed by one of their past life's irre
sponsible behaviors. The character
suddenly realizes that his or her ac
tions have lasting consequences on
others. They begin to strive for the

betterment and happiness of oth
ers, though with the selfish aim of
bettering their future position, not
knowing who they will be the next
day. Ultimately, the character dis
covers that they receive the most
lasting joy from positively impact
ing the permanent lives of those
around them. End scene.

It requires some imagination,
but it is the best way for me to com
municate the lesson that I've
learned and continue to keep
learning (because I continually
forget.) The more we focus on the
happiness and betterment of oth
ers and the less we focus on our
own situation, the happier we will
be, I don't have the philosophical
arguments or sociological statistics
for why this works. (If someone
does, send them my way!) But I do
know that on the lucky days and
lucky moments when I can push
my joy and my truth and my fulfill
ment aside, I enter into joy, truth
and fulfillment that is so much big
ger than me.

If you count slightly cannibalistic
hamsters amongst your turn-ons,
then email Chase forthwith (RIP
Gov'na) atninjaish@stanford.edu.

We all act harshly
and destructively
toward others.

On Oct. 20, 2011, after (not
so) careful consideration
and (little to no) planning,
my roommate and I decided to
commit entirely to our friendship
and adopt two adorable, healthy
Syrian hamsters. (Well, one was
healthy, and one was incredibly
fat.) They were named Gov'na,
(pronounced "Governor," but as if
a British person is pronouncing it,)
and Emilio (as in "Emilio Estevez!
The 'Mighty Ducks' Guy!").

We loved these hamsters with
all our hearts. We stayed up late
watching them fight over their lit
tle wheel and try to chew their way
out of their tiny jail-I-mean-cage.
We worried whether they would
get teased by their little hamster
classmates once they started ham
ster school. (Not for having two
multi-racial fathers, but for having
two multi-racial fathers that gave
them incredibly ridiculous names.)
But on winter quarter's eve,
tragedy struck. (Disclaimer: if you
are squeamish, you should proba
bly skip to the next paragraph. You
also probably shouldn't text me
asking for a picture.) I awoke to
find that Emilio, to put it bluntly,
