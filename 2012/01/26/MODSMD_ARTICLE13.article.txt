## TIME TO PARTY IN THE BACKFIELD 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Everybody already knows that you can't
replace Andrew Luck. Your offense can't
lose a two-time Heisman runner-up and still
put up more than 40 points per game the
next season. So how exactly will the 2012
Stanford football team make up for it? With
a defense that returns seven starters and
its best player.
The 2012 Stanford defense will lose three
of its top six tacklers from 2011, but the Car
dinal likely won't experience much of a drop

off from last season, when it finished as the
second-best defense in the Pac-12 and the
best against the run.
The Cardinal defense won't experience
the same kind of dramatic turnover that the
offense will experience in 2012, but, like its
counterpart on the other side of the ball, it
will lose four crucial starters from last season
defensive tackle Matt Masifilo, corner
back Johnson Bademosi and safeties
Michael Thomas and Delano Howell. But
the defense does gain back two of its most
disruptive defenders in linebackers Chase
Thomas and Shane Skov, with Thomas elect

ing to return to school for his redshirt senior
season and Skov returning to the field after
missing 2011 with a knee injury, leaving al
most the entire front seven intact.
Thomas was the Cardinal's most devas
tating defender in 2011, as he led the team in
both tackles for loss, with 17.5, and sacks,
with 8.5. Skov only tallied five tackles for
loss and one-and-a-half sacks in the three
games before his knee injury against Ari
zona, but should he stay healthy, he could
have another season like 2010, where he had
84 tackles, 10 and a half tackles for loss and
seven and a half sacks.

But the defense doesn't begin and end
with just Skov and Thomas. The Cardinal
linebacker corps will probably be the best
linebacker corps in the Pac-12 conference,
and possibly the best in the nation. While
Skov's injury was indeed a devastating loss
for the defense last season, the ripple effect
of his injury paid great dividends by prepar
ing AJ Tarpley and Jarek Lancaster to come
in and contribute once again in 2012. The
duo came in and played very well in Skov's
stead, combining for 122 total tackles and

finishing with the third-most and
the most tackles on the team, re
spectively.

In addition to those four, out
side linebackers Trent Murphy,
Alex Debniak and Blake Lueders
and inside linebackers James
Vaughters and Joe Hemschoot all
return, making this far and away
the deepest positional group on
the team. As an added bonus, the
Cardinal's top recruiting prospect,
linebacker Noor Davis, is ranked
as the fourth-best linebacker
prospect in the country, although
he could be redshirted with so
many talented players ahead of
him.

On the defensive line, junior
Terrence Stephens returns to his
spot at defensive tackle, but the
Cardinal will miss Matt Masifilo,
who had eight tackles for loss from
his spot along the line last season.
Junior Josh Mauro and sopho
mores David Parry and Henry An
derson, who all logged time on the
line last season, are possible re
placements for Masafilo. The Car
dinal also will add incoming fresh
man Jordan Watkins, a four-star
defensive tackle from College
Park, Ga.
On the ends of the line, Ben
Gardner returns after an outstand
ing sophomore season where he
had 10 tackles for loss and four and
a half sacks, while Anderson could
also compete for a spot on the out
side as well. Junior Jacob Gowan

and sophomore Eddie Plantaric
are in the conversation after they
notched a small amount of playing
time last year. The Cardinal is also
bringing in recruit Luke Kaumat
ule, a 6-foot-7,268-pound end who
is the No. 1 player in the state of
Hawaii and the nation's 15th-best
defensive end. With his massive
size, Kaumatule might figure into
the defensive line right away next
season.

All in all, the defensive line and
linebackers can build on last year's
success, when the Cardinal was the
best in the Pac-12 against the run,
only giving up 84.4 yards per game
on the ground. But as the defend
ers get further away from the line
of scrimmage, the picture becomes
less clear.
Stanford's clear weakness on
defense last season was against the
pass one only needed to look at
Justin Blackmon's performance in
the Fiesta Bowl to see that. On the
whole, opposing offenses threw for
278.8 yards per game against the
Cardinal, the seventh-ranked pass
defense in the conference, only
ahead of Colorado, USC, Arizona

State, Washington and Arizona.
It's not a stretch to think that this
group could continue to struggle
next season, when the Cardinal
lose senior starters Michael
Thomas, Delano Howell and John
son Bademosi, as well as Corey
Gatewood, who started several
games near the end of the season.
The one redeeming quality for
the defensive backfield, though, is
that injuries in 2011 did help pre
pare the pass defenders for 2012.
Howell missed several games with
a hand injury, opening the way for
junior Myles Muagututia and
sophomore Devon Carrington to
play some safety. It's likely that the
two of them could fill into the
shoes of Thomas and Howell.

As a replacement for
Bademosi on the outside, the job
likely will fall to one of four play
ers: sophomore Barry Browning,
freshman Jordan Richards and
juniors Terrence Brown and Usua
Amanam. The one wild card that
could make a big difference for the
Cardinal's pass defense is Wayne
Lyons, who had to redshirt in 2011
after a foot injury. Lyons was re-

cruited as a safety —he was the
sixth-best safety in the 2011 re
cruiting class and has received
praise from all of the Cardinal de
fenders as one of the most dynam
ic players on the team, when
healthy.
Altogether, the Cardinal de
fense certainly has the pieces in
place to continue to be one of the
best in the conference, especially
because of the depth and talent of
the linebackers. Perhaps the only
thing that could hamper the Cardi
nal defense will be the fact that the
Stanford offense will likely spend
less time on the field than it did last
season, when it had the highest
time of possession in the confer
ence. But the Stanford defense has
made its goal clear for next season:
"Party in the Backfield" (at least
according to Ben Gardner's Twit
ter account). And thanks to the re
turn of Thomas and Skov, the Car
dinal can already start sending out
RSVPs.

Cardinal's top recruiting prospect,
linebacker Noor Davis, is ranked
as the fourth-best linebacker
prospect in the country, although
he could be redshirted with so
many talented players ahead of
him.

On the defensive line, junior
Terrence Stephens returns to his
spot at defensive tackle, but the
Cardinal will miss Matt Masifilo,
who had eight tackles for loss from
his spot along the line last season.
Junior Josh Mauro and sopho
mores David Parry and Henry An
derson, who all logged time on the
line last season, are possible re
placements for Masafilo. The Car
dinal also will add incoming fresh
man Jordan Watkins, a four-star
defensive tackle from College
Park, Ga.
On the ends of the line, Ben
Gardner returns after an outstand
ing sophomore season where he
had 10 tackles for loss and four and
a half sacks, while Anderson could
also compete for a spot on the out
side as well. Junior Jacob Gowan

and sophomore Eddie Plantaric
are in the conversation after they
notched a small amount of playing
time last year. The Cardinal is also
bringing in recruit Luke Kaumat
ule, a 6-foot-7,268-pound end who
is the No. 1 player in the state of
Hawaii and the nation's 15th-best
defensive end. With his massive
size, Kaumatule might figure into
the defensive line right away next
season.

All in all, the defensive line and
linebackers can build on last year's
success, when the Cardinal was the
best in the Pac-12 against the run,
only giving up 84.4 yards per game
on the ground. But as the defend
ers get further away from the line
of scrimmage, the picture becomes
less clear.
Stanford's clear weakness on
defense last season was against the
pass one only needed to look at
Justin Blackmon's performance in
the Fiesta Bowl to see that. On the
whole, opposing offenses threw for
278.8 yards per game against the
Cardinal, the seventh-ranked pass
defense in the conference, only
ahead of Colorado, USC, Arizona

State, Washington and Arizona.
It's not a stretch to think that this
group could continue to struggle
next season, when the Cardinal
lose senior starters Michael
Thomas, Delano Howell and John
son Bademosi, as well as Corey
Gatewood, who started several
games near the end of the season.
The one redeeming quality for
the defensive backfield, though, is
that injuries in 2011 did help pre
pare the pass defenders for 2012.
Howell missed several games with
a hand injury, opening the way for
junior Myles Muagututia and
sophomore Devon Carrington to
play some safety. It's likely that the
two of them could fill into the
shoes of Thomas and Howell.

As a replacement for
Bademosi on the outside, the job
likely will fall to one of four play
ers: sophomore Barry Browning,
freshman Jordan Richards and
juniors Terrence Brown and Usua
Amanam. The one wild card that
could make a big difference for the
Cardinal's pass defense is Wayne
Lyons, who had to redshirt in 2011
after a foot injury. Lyons was re-

cruited as a safety —he was the
sixth-best safety in the 2011 re
cruiting class and has received
praise from all of the Cardinal de
fenders as one of the most dynam
ic players on the team, when
healthy.
Altogether, the Cardinal de
fense certainly has the pieces in
place to continue to be one of the
best in the conference, especially
because of the depth and talent of
the linebackers. Perhaps the only
thing that could hamper the Cardi
nal defense will be the fact that the
Stanford offense will likely spend
less time on the field than it did last
season, when it had the highest
time of possession in the confer
ence. But the Stanford defense has
made its goal clear for next season:
"Party in the Backfield" (at least
according to Ben Gardner's Twit
ter account). And thanks to the re
turn of Thomas and Skov, the Car
dinal can already start sending out
RSVPs.

Everybody already knows that you can't
replace Andrew Luck. Your offense can't
lose a two-time Heisman runner-up and still
put up more than 40 points per game the
next season. So how exactly will the 2012
Stanford football team make up for it? With
a defense that returns seven starters and
its best player.
The 2012 Stanford defense will lose three
of its top six tacklers from 2011, but the Car
dinal likely won't experience much of a drop

off from last season, when it finished as the
second-best defense in the Pac-12 and the
best against the run.
The Cardinal defense won't experience
the same kind of dramatic turnover that the
offense will experience in 2012, but, like its
counterpart on the other side of the ball, it
will lose four crucial starters from last season
defensive tackle Matt Masifilo, corner
back Johnson Bademosi and safeties
Michael Thomas and Delano Howell. But
the defense does gain back two of its most
disruptive defenders in linebackers Chase
Thomas and Shane Skov, with Thomas elect

ing to return to school for his redshirt senior
season and Skov returning to the field after
missing 2011 with a knee injury, leaving al
most the entire front seven intact.
Thomas was the Cardinal's most devas
tating defender in 2011, as he led the team in
both tackles for loss, with 17.5, and sacks,
with 8.5. Skov only tallied five tackles for
loss and one-and-a-half sacks in the three
games before his knee injury against Ari
zona, but should he stay healthy, he could
have another season like 2010, where he had
84 tackles, 10 and a half tackles for loss and
seven and a half sacks.

But the defense doesn't begin and end
with just Skov and Thomas. The Cardinal
linebacker corps will probably be the best
linebacker corps in the Pac-12 conference,
and possibly the best in the nation. While
Skov's injury was indeed a devastating loss
for the defense last season, the ripple effect
of his injury paid great dividends by prepar
ing AJ Tarpley and Jarek Lancaster to come
in and contribute once again in 2012. The
duo came in and played very well in Skov's
stead, combining for 122 total tackles and

finishing with the third-most and
the most tackles on the team, re
spectively.

In addition to those four, out
side linebackers Trent Murphy,
Alex Debniak and Blake Lueders
and inside linebackers James
Vaughters and Joe Hemschoot all
return, making this far and away
the deepest positional group on
the team. As an added bonus, the
