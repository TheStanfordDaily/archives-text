## TIME TO PARTY IN THE BACKFIELD 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Everybody already knows that you can't
replace Andrew Luck. Your offense can't
lose a two-time Heisman runner-up and still
put up more than 40 points per game the
next season. So how exactly will the 2012
Stanford football team make up for it? With
a defense that returns seven starters and
its best player.
The 2012 Stanford defense will lose three
of its top six tacklers from 2011, but the Car
dinal likely won't experience much of a drop

off from last season, when it finished as the
second-best defense in the Pac-12 and the
best against the run.
The Cardinal defense won't experience
the same kind of dramatic turnover that the
offense will experience in 2012, but, like its
counterpart on the other side of the ball, it
will lose four crucial starters from last season
defensive tackle Matt Masifilo, corner
back Johnson Bademosi and safeties
Michael Thomas and Delano Howell. But
the defense does gain back two of its most
disruptive defenders in linebackers Chase
Thomas and Shane Skov, with Thomas elect

ing to return to school for his redshirt senior
season and Skov returning to the field after
missing 2011 with a knee injury, leaving al
most the entire front seven intact.
Thomas was the Cardinal's most devas
tating defender in 2011, as he led the team in
both tackles for loss, with 17.5, and sacks,
with 8.5. Skov only tallied five tackles for
loss and one-and-a-half sacks in the three
games before his knee injury against Ari
zona, but should he stay healthy, he could
have another season like 2010, where he had
84 tackles, 10 and a half tackles for loss and
seven and a half sacks.

But the defense doesn't begin and end
with just Skov and Thomas. The Cardinal
linebacker corps will probably be the best
linebacker corps in the Pac-12 conference,
and possibly the best in the nation. While
Skov's injury was indeed a devastating loss
for the defense last season, the ripple effect
of his injury paid great dividends by prepar
ing AJ Tarpley and Jarek Lancaster to come
in and contribute once again in 2012. The
duo came in and played very well in Skov's
stead, combining for 122 total tackles and

The 2012 Stanford defense loses four starters from last season's 11-2 Fiesta Bowl team, but the Cardinal still expects to have one of the most talented defenses in the Pac-12.
