# CARDINAL VENTURES EASTWARD
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Every February, the San Antonio
Spurs pack up and hit the road for what
has become known as the annual Rodeo
Road Trip, so called because the Spurs'
home arena is occupied by the San Anto
nio Stock Show & Rodeo for close to a
month.

While Maples Pavilion has no plans to
host a rodeo any time soon, the Stanford
men's volleyball team seems to find itself
away from home rather often this time of
year.

Last season, the Cardinal played
seven games in seven cities and traveled
9,227 miles to do so.
And this weekend, Stanford is set to
play at the Ken and Dave Dunlap Invita
tional, the team's third and fourth match
es of a 10-game road trip that will span
five consecutive weekends and 40 days
between home matches.
If the No. 4 Cardinal (4-1) needs an
added boost to get rid of some of the fa
tigue that comes with flying cross country,
it won't have to look much further than
the other side of the net on Friday, where
the No. 8 Penn State Nittany Lions will
certainly be upset-minded in the rematch
of the 2010 NCAA Championship. That
game saw Stanford win its first NCAA
title in 13 years, largely on the back of one
of the greatest hitting performances of
NCAA Final Four history from senior
outside hitter Brad Lawson.
Then a sophomore, Lawson had a re
markable 24 kills in 28 swings with only
one error, posting an .824 hitting percent
age that is a still a Stanford record for an
outside hitter and ranks as one of the top
performances of any kind in the NCAA
finals.
Friday's match against the Nittany
Lions will be a different affair entirely,
however. Penn State (2-1) comes into the
weekend after a tough loss to No. 9 Lewis,
and despite making the NCAA final in
four of the past 13 years, faces a tough
road to the Galen Center in 2012.
And Stanford has just two starters left
from that championship team seniors
Lawson and libera Erik Shoji. Instead, the
Cardinal has gotten much of its firepower

from a strong sophomore class, which
holds down four spots in the starting line
up — outside hitters Brian Cook and
Steven Irvin and middle blockers Denny
Falls and Eric Mochalski.

Cook and Mochalski in particular
have come on strong in their second sea
sons on the Farm. Cook, a Santa Cruz na
tive, had a career-high 17 kills in the
team's most recent victory over No. 13
Santa Barbara, and Mochalski set the
school's single-match hitting-percentage
record in the rally-scoring era with an .833
mark earlier this season against Loyola.
Both players will be tested against
Penn State's lineup, and there won't be
any rest on Saturday when the Cardinal
takes on No. 10 Ohio State.

The Buckeyes (5-3) are heating up
lately after winning three consecutive
matches following a sweep at the hands of

Penn State. Stanford's middle blockers
will be hard pressed to slow senior Shane
Sangrey, the reigning Midwestern Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association Player
of the Week and an NCAA All-Tourna
ment selection last year.
Historically the Cardinal hasn't had
too much trouble with Ohio State, dis
patching them all nine times the two have
met which includes a Stanford victory
in the 2010 NCAA semifinal.

But the series with the Nittany Lions
has been a seesaw affair, with the teams
currently deadlocked at 5-5 overall.
The game against Penn State is sched
uled for Friday at 2 p.m. PST from Colum
bus, Ohio, with Saturday's matchup setfor
4 p.m. PST against the Buckeyes.

Historically the Cardinal hasn't had
too much trouble with Ohio State, dis
patching them all nine times the two have
met which includes a Stanford victory
in the 2010 NCAA semifinal.

But the series with the Nittany Lions
has been a seesaw affair, with the teams
currently deadlocked at 5-5 overall.
The game against Penn State is sched
uled for Friday at 2 p.m. PST from Colum
bus, Ohio, with Saturday's matchup setfor
4 p.m. PST against the Buckeyes.
