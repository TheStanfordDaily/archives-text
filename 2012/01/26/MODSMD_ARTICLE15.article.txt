# Luck and Appel may make pair of firsts
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
We at Stanford are used to doing
things that have never been done
before. Things that students at other
schools dream of starting billion
dollar companies, competing in the
Olympics or becoming an influential politician are
all somewhat common for Stanford grads.
But this year, two Stanford students could achieve
something that has never been done before: be the first
classmates picked first in the NFL and MLB drafts.
It's pretty obvious to everyone who has watched
Andrew Luck play football that he will (and should) be
the top pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, but he may not be
the only No. 1 pick on campus this season.
After an excellent sophomore year and a phenome
nal performance this summer in the elite Cape Cod
league, junior righthanded pitcher Mark Appel is wide
ly considered to be the best prospect for this year's
MLB draft. And if the Astros decide that they want an
ace righty to help them struggle through their switch to
the American League in 2013, it will be the first time in
history that one school has had the first picks in the
NFL and MLB drafts.
