# Luck and Appel may make pair of firsts
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
We at Stanford are used to doing
things that have never been done
before. Things that students at other
schools dream of starting billion
dollar companies, competing in the
Olympics or becoming an influential politician are
all somewhat common for Stanford grads.
But this year, two Stanford students could achieve
something that has never been done before: be the first
classmates picked first in the NFL and MLB drafts.
It's pretty obvious to everyone who has watched
Andrew Luck play football that he will (and should) be
the top pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, but he may not be
the only No. 1 pick on campus this season.
After an excellent sophomore year and a phenome
nal performance this summer in the elite Cape Cod
league, junior righthanded pitcher Mark Appel is wide
ly considered to be the best prospect for this year's
MLB draft. And if the Astros decide that they want an
ace righty to help them struggle through their switch to
the American League in 2013, it will be the first time in
history that one school has had the first picks in the
NFL and MLB drafts.
This feat is particularly im
pressive because MLB teams can
(and often do) draft prospects
straight out of high school, so they
don't have to always take the
most talented college player
available. The draft pool for the
MLB draft is larger than any
other professional sports league,
so having a player from your
school picked first overall is far
less likely to happen in the MLB
than in any other professional
sports league.
Perhaps the only fly in the oint
ment for the Stanford, though, is
that if Luck and Appel both go
first overall, it wouldn't be the first
time in sports history that two stu
dents from the same school were
the first picks overall for two pro
fessional sports leagues. The first
school to achieve this feat was the
University of Utah back in 2005,
when the Milwaukee Bucks select
ed forward Andrew Bogut with
the first pick in the NBA draft and
the San Francisco 49ers made
quarterback Alex Smith the first
pick in the NFL draft.
The Colts have already come
out and said that they definitely
will choose Luck with the first pick
on April 26. Thankfully, the Colts
have their heads on straight, so
that leaves just one question: how
likely are the Astros to pick Appel
and complete the first-pick duo?
Appel's measurable statistics
are pretty darn impressive. Lie's 6-
foot-5, throws a fastball that reach
es 99 miles an hour and has two
other nasty pitches with a low-80s
change up and a high-80s slider. As
the Friday night starter last season
pitching against every team's
best starter every week he com
piled a 6-7 record with a 3.02 ERA
and struck out 86 batters com
pared to just 29 walks in 110.1 in
nings of work. And after spending
a summer playing with Team USA
and in the Cape Cod baseball
league, he's put together a body of
work that many major league
teams covet.

Aside from those stats, though,
Appel should have special appeal
to the Astros, making him very
likely to be the first overall pick
even if he should struggle this sea
son. Appel has ties to Houston
he lives in Houston, his grandpar
ents live in Houston and his uncle
is the dean of the architecture
school at Rice University.
Additionally, the Astros have a
recent history of picking Stanford
players. In 2008, the Astros took
Cardinal catcher Jason Castro
with the 10th overall pick in the
draft, and it would provide some
synergy in the battery if both the
ace pitcher and the guy behind the
plate could bond about spending
three years under the rule of head
coach Mark Marquess.
It seems like the only things
that could swing the Astros away
from picking Appel are that four
of their top 10 prospects are right
handed pitchers or the nightmare
case that Appel gets injured in
2012.

But should Appel stay healthy
and put together another good
season which seems likely con
sidering the Cardinal returns its
top eight hitters he and Luck
could make a pair that's never
been seen before. And even for a
place like Stanford, which is used
to greatness, that'd be pretty dang
impressive.

Jack Blanchat can't throw 99 mph
and has never been known for his
pocket poise. But if you need some
one to partner with, Jack definitely
can bowl a mean game of bocci
ball. Send your requests to blan

We at Stanford are used to doing
things that have never been done
before. Things that students at other
schools dream of starting billion
dollar companies, competing in the
Olympics or becoming an influential politician are
all somewhat common for Stanford grads.
But this year, two Stanford students could achieve
something that has never been done before: be the first
classmates picked first in the NFL and MLB drafts.
It's pretty obvious to everyone who has watched
Andrew Luck play football that he will (and should) be
the top pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, but he may not be
the only No. 1 pick on campus this season.
After an excellent sophomore year and a phenome
nal performance this summer in the elite Cape Cod
league, junior righthanded pitcher Mark Appel is wide
ly considered to be the best prospect for this year's
MLB draft. And if the Astros decide that they want an
ace righty to help them struggle through their switch to
the American League in 2013, it will be the first time in
history that one school has had the first picks in the
NFL and MLB drafts.
This feat is particularly im
pressive because MLB teams can
(and often do) draft prospects
straight out of high school, so they
don't have to always take the
most talented college player
available. The draft pool for the
MLB draft is larger than any
other professional sports league,
so having a player from your
school picked first overall is far
less likely to happen in the MLB
than in any other professional
sports league.
Perhaps the only fly in the oint
ment for the Stanford, though, is
that if Luck and Appel both go
first overall, it wouldn't be the first
time in sports history that two stu
dents from the same school were
the first picks overall for two pro
fessional sports leagues. The first
school to achieve this feat was the
University of Utah back in 2005,
when the Milwaukee Bucks select
ed forward Andrew Bogut with
the first pick in the NBA draft and
the San Francisco 49ers made
quarterback Alex Smith the first
pick in the NFL draft.
The Colts have already come
out and said that they definitely
will choose Luck with the first pick
on April 26. Thankfully, the Colts
have their heads on straight, so
that leaves just one question: how
likely are the Astros to pick Appel
and complete the first-pick duo?
Appel's measurable statistics
are pretty darn impressive. Lie's 6-
foot-5, throws a fastball that reach
es 99 miles an hour and has two
other nasty pitches with a low-80s
change up and a high-80s slider. As
the Friday night starter last season
pitching against every team's
best starter every week he com
piled a 6-7 record with a 3.02 ERA
and struck out 86 batters com
pared to just 29 walks in 110.1 in
nings of work. And after spending
a summer playing with Team USA
and in the Cape Cod baseball
league, he's put together a body of
work that many major league
teams covet.

Aside from those stats, though,
Appel should have special appeal
to the Astros, making him very
likely to be the first overall pick
even if he should struggle this sea
son. Appel has ties to Houston
he lives in Houston, his grandpar
ents live in Houston and his uncle
is the dean of the architecture
school at Rice University.
Additionally, the Astros have a
recent history of picking Stanford
players. In 2008, the Astros took
Cardinal catcher Jason Castro
with the 10th overall pick in the
draft, and it would provide some
synergy in the battery if both the
ace pitcher and the guy behind the
plate could bond about spending
three years under the rule of head
coach Mark Marquess.
It seems like the only things
that could swing the Astros away
from picking Appel are that four
of their top 10 prospects are right
handed pitchers or the nightmare
case that Appel gets injured in
2012.

But should Appel stay healthy
and put together another good
season which seems likely con
sidering the Cardinal returns its
top eight hitters he and Luck
could make a pair that's never
been seen before. And even for a
place like Stanford, which is used
to greatness, that'd be pretty dang
impressive.
