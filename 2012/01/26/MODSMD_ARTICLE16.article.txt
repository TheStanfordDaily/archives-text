## Nnemkadi Ogwumike a finalist for Lowe's Senior CLASS Award 
### 
Two-time All-American Nnemkadi Ogwumike was
one of 10 finalists announced Wednesday for the
Lowe's Senior CLASS Award.

According to its website, the award is given to a stu
dent-athlete who must be classified as an NCAA Divi
sion I senior and have notable achievements in four
areas of excellence community, classroom, charac
ter and competition.

The finalists were chosen by a media committee
from a list of 60 candidates announced in November,
and nationwide fan voting now through March 18 will
be combined with media and Division I men's and
women's basketball head coaches' votes to determine
the winner.

The Cypress, Texas, native Ogwumike has put up
impressive stats in her final year on the Farm. She leads
the Pac-12 in scoring (22.9 ppg) and rebounding (11.2
rpg) and has helped the No. 4 Cardinal to a 17-1 over
all record, putting it on track to win its 12th consecu
tive conference title.

Additionally, Ogwumike is busy rewriting the Stan
ford record books, moving into fifth place all-time on
the Cardinal's career scoring and
rebounding lists while becoming
just the fourth player in Stanford
history to join the 2,000
point/1,000 rebound club on Jan.
7.
Stanford will take on rival Cal
ifornia at Maples Pavilion on Sat
urday with a chance to increase its
lead in the conference with a little
over a month to go before the
NCAA Tournament.
