# READY TO DOUBLE-DIP
## 
### GEORGE CHEN CONTRIBUTING EDITOR 
The women's swimmers and
divers are coming off impressive
performances last weekend, de
feating two national top-25 teams,
No. 5 Arizona and No. 24 Arizona
State, in two consecutive days. But
No. 6 Stanford (6-1) isn't being re
warded with any rest as it prepares
for another tough weekend. The
next two days will consist of an all
too-familiar back-to-back dual
meet as the Cardinal faces UCLA
(2-2) on Friday and undefeated
No. 3 USC (5-0) on Saturday.
This weekend could prove to
be even more difficult than last
weekend, as both meets will be
away for Stanford. And as if trav
eling, unfamiliar pools and stellar
opponents didn't already make up
a challenge, the women's team will
have competed against four quali
ty Pac-12 teams, three of which are
ranked in the national top 25, in

just one week.
But rather than complaining
about the tough schedule, the
team is using the adversity as mo
tivation and, perhaps more impor
tantly, as preparation for the much
bigger Pac-12 Championship and
NCAA Championship meets at
the end of the season.

"The Pac-12 is really competi
tive, and we have meet after meet
after meet starting with last week
end and going right through to the
NCAA meet," said women's
swimming and diving head coach
Lea Maurer. "I'm not sure people
understand that at the NCAA
meet we swim from 7 in the morn
ing until 2, then we swim again
from 4:30 in the afternoon until
about 10 in the night. And we do
that for three straight days."
"The dual meets are challeng
ing, but they simply prepare us for
the physical and mental chal
lenges of the Pac-12 and the
NCAA championship meet," she

continued. "We prepare by train
ing doubles and doing the work
that prepares us mentally and
physically for the challenges that
are in front of us."

Recent history is certainly on
Stanford's side against the two
Pac-12 opponents. The Cardinal
has beaten UCLA five years in a
row. Against USC, Stanford has
won 11-straight dual meets a
streak that dates back to 2001.

Although the matchup against
the Bruins should not be over
looked, the Trojans will likely be a
much tougher opponent for the
Cardinal. Senior Sam Woodward
has been dominant all season for
Stanford, holding the second
fastest time in the 100 butterfly
and fifth-fastest time in the 50
freestyle in the country. This week
end, however, Woodward may
have to race against USC's sopho
more Kasey Carlson, a national
caliber sprinter whose 50 freestyle
time this season is three hun

dredths of a second faster than
Woodward's.

Stanford's sophomore Maya
Dißado is another key swimmer
for the team, owning the nation's
fastest time in the 200 backstroke
and second-fastest time in the 200
individual medley. She, however,
will likewise be tested against USC.
Should Coach Maurer put her in
the 200 individual medley against
the Trojans, she will have to face
senior Katinka Hosszu, the na
tion's fastest swimmer in that event
so far this season. Beating Hosszu
would be an impressive feat, con
sidering that she represented Hun
gary at the 2008 Olympics and fin
ished in the top 20 in both of the
events that she swam.
While Woodward and Dißado
are essential to the team's success,
the Cardinal's depth may be their
most powerful weapon of all. Stan
ford's remarkable depth, especial
ly in the sprint events, explains
why the team's 200 freestyle relay
currently owns the fastest time in
the country by almost half a sec
ond. Winning relays will be critical
against both UCLA and USC, as
winning a relay event gives a team
11 points while winning an indi
vidual event is only worth nine.
The Cardinal should have plen
ty of confidence going into the two
meets, as the team has been rack
ing up dual-meet victories on a
consistent basis. In fact, Stanford's
only loss of the season came
against SEC powerhouse No. 6
Florida in a tri-meet at Michigan
back in early November.

"I believe confidence conies
from day-to-day preparation,"
Maurer said. "It's always nice to
see when the team can capitalize
on their preparation and execute
when the pressure is on. That is the
real challenge."
Stanford will swim against the
Bruins at UCLA at 1 p.m. on Fri
day and then travel to USC to face
the Trojans at 12 p.m. on Saturday
