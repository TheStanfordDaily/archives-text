## Divestment debate continues Group meets to encourage Stanford to stop investments in 'unethical' corporations 
### NATASHA WEASER 
Stanford Students for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER) hosted a divestment campaign
event Wednesday evening in the Oak Lounge at
Tresidder, attended by approximately 30 Stan
ford students, affiliates and community mem
bers.

The divestment campaign calls for Stanford to
stop investing its endowment in companies that
contribute to what the group labels "the oppres
sion of the Palestinian people,"

"Divestment is a tried and true tactic," said
founder and co-president Omar Shakir 'O7. "It is
a powerful symbol and the best non-violent
method to effectuate change."
The date of the event, Jan. 25, marked the one
year anniversary of the beginning of the Egypt
ian Arab Spring revolution.

"This choice of date was not a coincidence,"
Shakir said, who is currently studying at Stanford
Law School. "It fits in with our idea of grassroots
movements and tackling human rights violations
from the ground."

The event started with a tribute to the Egypt
ian revolution followed by a PowerPoint presen-

tation outlining the history of the
conflict and the aims of the cam
paign.

The campaign calls on Stanford
University to divest from eight
specific companies: Ahava, Mo
torola, Roadstone Holdings,
Riwal, Lockheed Martin, Meko
rot, Caterpillar and Veolia Trans
portation, all of whom SPER
claims either facilitate or support
institutional discrimination, col
lective punishment, operation of
Israeli-only settlements and main
tenance of the separation barrier
in the Palestinian territory.
Shakir founded the group,
originally called Students Con
fronting Apartheid by Israel
(SCAI), in the fall of 2006. They
changed their name this year.

"The new name reflects a new
strategic aim we have," Shakir
said. "There is now more of an
awareness of the apartheid in Is
rael, so we have decided to focus
on the rights of the Palestinians."
SPER's divestment campaign
petition has over 1,000 signatures
from Stanford students, faculty,
alumni, affiliates and student or
ganizations.

Shakir stated that Stanford
has a policy to not invest in com
panies that engage in substantial
social injury and claims the Uni
versity has a history of divesting
from companies that do.
Examples include divesting

from Sinopec and PetroChina in
May 2005 due to their involve
ment in the Darfur conflict and
adopting an ethical investment
policy toward conflict minerals in
May 2010 due to the conflict in
Congo.

Stanford students launched a
successful divestment campaign
during the apartheid in South
Africa.

According to Shakir, the
Board of Trustees has been recep
tive toward SPER's message, and
the group is preparing to make its
first formal presentation to the
Board at an undecided time this
year.

Shakir emphasized that the or
ganization's current focus is to
build awareness and mobilize dif
ferent segments of the Stanford
community before proceeding
with the formal presentation to
the Board.
The event ended with candid
conversation and debate between
audience members who posed
questions and challenged each
other.

"It was a very powerful pres
entation but definitely more than
that; it's a really important way
that Stanford students can get in
volved in direct action," said
Anna McConnell 'l4. "This is cer
tainly something that we have the
power and responsibility to do."
"It educated me and inspired
me to take action to help the cam
paign," said audience member
Karl Kumodzi 'l4.
