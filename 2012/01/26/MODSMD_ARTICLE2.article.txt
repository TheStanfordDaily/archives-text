Stanford Students for Palestinian Equal

event Wednesday evening in the Oak Lounge at
Tresidder, attended by approximately 30 Stan

stop investing its endowment in companies that

movements and tackling human rights violations
from the ground."

The event started with a tribute to the Egypt
ian revolution followed by a PowerPoint presen-
