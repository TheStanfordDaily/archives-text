# Hillard's FDA vote scrutinized
## Med School professor defends against allegations from watchdog 
### MARSHALL WATKINS STAFF WRITER 
Paula Hillard, a professor at the
Stanford School of Medicine, has be
come the subject of an ethics contro
versy following her involvement
with and voting record on an FDA
advisory committee. Hillard voted
on the safety of two drugs that were
created by a company she had exten
sive ties with, according to California
Watch, an investigative journalism
group founded by the Center for In
vestigative Reporting.

The FDA committee was con
vened to evaluate the significance of
recent studies showing that Yaz and
Yasmin, popular oral contraceptives
manufactured by Bayer Health Care
Pharmaceuticals, statistically in
creased the risk of potentially dan
gerous blood clots. The elevated risk
has been linked to the presence of
drospirenone in the contraceptives.
Yaz, Yasmin and related contra
ceptives constituted Bayer's second
best-selling franchise last year, with
global sales of $1.6 billion. This por
tion of company's market share has
been falling recently, at least in part
because of ongoing lawsuits against
Bayer, citing deceptive marketing
and harmful effects from its prod
ucts.

Three studies, all sponsored by
Bayer, suggested that the risks posed

by Yaz or Yasmin, and other contra
ceptives not containing
drospirenone, were comparable.
Seven other studies, however, assert
ed that Yaz and Yasmin did indeed
pose an elevated risk of harmful
blood clots.

The committee voted 15 votes to
11 that the benefits of Yaz and Yas
min continued to outweigh the risks
documented in the studies. The com
mittee did, however, support a
change in labeling to advise physi
cians of the higher risk.
The Project on Government
Oversight (POGO), a watchdog
group, was not happy with the result
and has called on the FDA to throw
out the verdict on the basis of com
mittee members' prior involvement
with Bayer, citing the existence of
multiple conflicts of interest.
Four committee members, in
cluding Hillard and the committee's
chair, had prior affiliations with
Bayer or the manufacturers of simi
lar generic contraceptives. All four
voted in support of the contracep
tives but denied any link to their
prior ties to Bayer or the existence of
any conflict of interest.
POGO's Director of Investiga
tions Nick Schwellenbach stated that
the watchdog's scrutiny was prompt
ed by the small margin by which the
contraceptives' continued sale
was approved. Without the four
members' affirmative voting, the
committee would have been un
able to reach a majority opinion
on whether consumer welfare was
unduly endangered by the contra
ceptives.

Schwellenbach noted that po
tential conflicts of interest are rel
atively common in the FDA's ad

visory process and that there is
often a correlation between mem
bers' industry ties and their voting
records.

Schwellenbach singled out
Hillard, however, for the extent of
her links with Bayer. A POGO
open letter to the FDA cited con
sulting arrangements between
Hillard and Bayer that continued
up to 2010. Schwellenbach also
emphasized the conflict of inter
est posed by internal Bayer docu
ments identifying Hillard as a
valuable advocate as early as
2003.

"Hillard had sufficient ties to

Bayer, and those ties were suffi
ciently recent to question her ob
jectivity," Schwellenbach said.
Hillard acknowledged that she
had periodically served as a con
sultant to Bayer and other phar
maceutical firms, but said that she
had done no such work during the
12 months preceding the commit
tee's decision. She argued that she
bore no responsibility for Bayer's
internal portrayals of her rela
tionship with the firm.
Hillard emphasized that she had
satisfied all requirements for the
disclosure of potential conflicts of
interest to the FDA, as well as mak
ing prior consulting affiliations
available to the public through the
medical school website.
"It was the FDA's decision that
I satisfied the process for report
ing conflicts of interest," Hillard
said. "The FDA allowed me to sit
on the committee ... I'm in favor
of disclosure of potential con
flicts, and I feel that I can be ob
jective."

Hillard said that she had sat on
several advisory committees in
preceding years and had each
time completed a confidential
form regarding conflicts of inter
est for the FDA.

According to Hillard, her deci

sion to support Yaz and Yasmin's
continued sale stemmed from
flaws in some of the studies link
ing the contraceptives to a higher
risk of clots. She said that the dis
proportionate inclusion in the
survey of women diagnosed with
polycystic ovary syndrome, which
elevates the base risk of blood
clots, likely distorted results.

This led Hillard to conclude
that, while all contraceptives con
taining estrogen carried some
risk, Yaz and Yasmin posed no
more risk than other contracep
tives and less than the risks posed
by pregnancy.
Schwellenbach emphasized
that POGO didn't consider
Hillard to have breached any ex
isting legal or ethical restrictions
and credited Hillard's disclosure
of industry affiliations through
the University.
He suggested, however, that
the FDA change its policy toward
a more expansive and stringent
interpretation of conflicts of in
terest and that information on po
tential conflicts of interest be
made more apparent and accessi
ble to the general public.

clots, likely distorted results.

This led Hillard to conclude
that, while all contraceptives con
taining estrogen carried some
risk, Yaz and Yasmin posed no
more risk than other contracep
tives and less than the risks posed
by pregnancy.
Schwellenbach emphasized
that POGO didn't consider
Hillard to have breached any ex
isting legal or ethical restrictions
and credited Hillard's disclosure
of industry affiliations through
the University.
He suggested, however, that
the FDA change its policy toward
a more expansive and stringent
interpretation of conflicts of in
terest and that information on po
tential conflicts of interest be
made more apparent and accessi
ble to the general public.

Paula Hillard, a professor at the
Stanford School of Medicine, has be
come the subject of an ethics contro
versy following her involvement
with and voting record on an FDA
advisory committee. Hillard voted
on the safety of two drugs that were
created by a company she had exten
sive ties with, according to California
Watch, an investigative journalism
group founded by the Center for In
vestigative Reporting.

The FDA committee was con
vened to evaluate the significance of
recent studies showing that Yaz and
Yasmin, popular oral contraceptives
manufactured by Bayer Health Care
Pharmaceuticals, statistically in
creased the risk of potentially dan
gerous blood clots. The elevated risk
has been linked to the presence of
drospirenone in the contraceptives.
Yaz, Yasmin and related contra
ceptives constituted Bayer's second
best-selling franchise last year, with
global sales of $1.6 billion. This por
tion of company's market share has
been falling recently, at least in part
because of ongoing lawsuits against
Bayer, citing deceptive marketing
and harmful effects from its prod
ucts.

Three studies, all sponsored by
Bayer, suggested that the risks posed

by Yaz or Yasmin, and other contra
ceptives not containing
drospirenone, were comparable.
Seven other studies, however, assert
ed that Yaz and Yasmin did indeed
pose an elevated risk of harmful
blood clots.

The committee voted 15 votes to
11 that the benefits of Yaz and Yas
min continued to outweigh the risks
documented in the studies. The com
mittee did, however, support a
change in labeling to advise physi
cians of the higher risk.
The Project on Government
Oversight (POGO), a watchdog
group, was not happy with the result
and has called on the FDA to throw
out the verdict on the basis of com
mittee members' prior involvement
with Bayer, citing the existence of
multiple conflicts of interest.
Four committee members, in
cluding Hillard and the committee's
chair, had prior affiliations with
Bayer or the manufacturers of simi
lar generic contraceptives. All four
voted in support of the contracep
tives but denied any link to their
prior ties to Bayer or the existence of
any conflict of interest.
POGO's Director of Investiga
tions Nick Schwellenbach stated that
the watchdog's scrutiny was prompt
ed by the small margin by which the
contraceptives' continued sale
was approved. Without the four
members' affirmative voting, the
committee would have been un
able to reach a majority opinion
on whether consumer welfare was
unduly endangered by the contra
ceptives.

Schwellenbach noted that po
tential conflicts of interest are rel
atively common in the FDA's ad

visory process and that there is
often a correlation between mem
bers' industry ties and their voting
records.

Schwellenbach singled out
Hillard, however, for the extent of
her links with Bayer. A POGO
open letter to the FDA cited con
sulting arrangements between
Hillard and Bayer that continued
up to 2010. Schwellenbach also
emphasized the conflict of inter
est posed by internal Bayer docu
ments identifying Hillard as a
valuable advocate as early as
2003.

"Hillard had sufficient ties to

Bayer, and those ties were suffi
ciently recent to question her ob
jectivity," Schwellenbach said.
Hillard acknowledged that she
had periodically served as a con
sultant to Bayer and other phar
maceutical firms, but said that she
had done no such work during the
12 months preceding the commit
tee's decision. She argued that she
bore no responsibility for Bayer's
internal portrayals of her rela
tionship with the firm.
Hillard emphasized that she had
satisfied all requirements for the
disclosure of potential conflicts of
interest to the FDA, as well as mak
ing prior consulting affiliations
available to the public through the
medical school website.
"It was the FDA's decision that
I satisfied the process for report
ing conflicts of interest," Hillard
said. "The FDA allowed me to sit
on the committee ... I'm in favor
of disclosure of potential con
flicts, and I feel that I can be ob
jective."

Hillard said that she had sat on
several advisory committees in
preceding years and had each
time completed a confidential
form regarding conflicts of inter
est for the FDA.

According to Hillard, her deci

sion to support Yaz and Yasmin's
continued sale stemmed from
flaws in some of the studies link
ing the contraceptives to a higher
risk of clots. She said that the dis
proportionate inclusion in the
survey of women diagnosed with
polycystic ovary syndrome, which
elevates the base risk of blood
clots, likely distorted results.

This led Hillard to conclude
that, while all contraceptives con
taining estrogen carried some
risk, Yaz and Yasmin posed no
more risk than other contracep
tives and less than the risks posed
by pregnancy.
