# Hillard's FDA vote scrutinized
## Med School professor defends against allegations from watchdog 
### MARSHALL WATKINS STAFF WRITER 
Paula Hillard, a professor at the
Stanford School of Medicine, has be
come the subject of an ethics contro
versy following her involvement
with and voting record on an FDA
advisory committee. Hillard voted
on the safety of two drugs that were
created by a company she had exten
sive ties with, according to California
Watch, an investigative journalism
group founded by the Center for In
vestigative Reporting.

The FDA committee was con
vened to evaluate the significance of
recent studies showing that Yaz and
Yasmin, popular oral contraceptives
manufactured by Bayer Health Care
Pharmaceuticals, statistically in
creased the risk of potentially dan
gerous blood clots. The elevated risk
has been linked to the presence of
drospirenone in the contraceptives.
Yaz, Yasmin and related contra
ceptives constituted Bayer's second
best-selling franchise last year, with
global sales of $1.6 billion. This por
tion of company's market share has
been falling recently, at least in part
because of ongoing lawsuits against
Bayer, citing deceptive marketing
and harmful effects from its prod
ucts.

Three studies, all sponsored by
Bayer, suggested that the risks posed

by Yaz or Yasmin, and other contra
ceptives not containing
drospirenone, were comparable.
Seven other studies, however, assert
ed that Yaz and Yasmin did indeed
pose an elevated risk of harmful
blood clots.

The committee voted 15 votes to
11 that the benefits of Yaz and Yas
min continued to outweigh the risks
documented in the studies. The com
mittee did, however, support a
change in labeling to advise physi
cians of the higher risk.
The Project on Government
Oversight (POGO), a watchdog
group, was not happy with the result
and has called on the FDA to throw
out the verdict on the basis of com
mittee members' prior involvement
with Bayer, citing the existence of
multiple conflicts of interest.
Four committee members, in
cluding Hillard and the committee's
chair, had prior affiliations with
Bayer or the manufacturers of simi
lar generic contraceptives. All four
voted in support of the contracep
tives but denied any link to their
prior ties to Bayer or the existence of
any conflict of interest.
POGO's Director of Investiga
tions Nick Schwellenbach stated that
the watchdog's scrutiny was prompt
ed by the small margin by which the
