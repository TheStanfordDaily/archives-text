## Frost Amphitheater to host spring concert 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
Frost Amphitheater has a long history as a
venue for raucous music festivals and famous
artists. Jefferson Airplane played there in the
late 19605, and the prominent space has also
seen Miles Davis, Joan Baez and the Grateful
Dead, the latter of whom played there more
than a dozen times.
According to an article written by Ivan
Maisel 'Bl in Stanford Magazine, the venue
was shut down for several years during the
height of the Vietnam War after several alter
cations broke out among concert attendees.
Frost is now largely unused, plagued by a lack
of modern equipment and lingering fears
over safety.

That long drought will come to an end this
May when a "Spring Fling" the official
name is not yet decided will take place on
Frost's grassy field.

The concert which has an artist sugges
tion list that includes MGMT, Beirut, Vam
pire Weekend, Black Keys and many more
has been in the works for more than a year
now.

"There was a lot of student interest in it
last spring, between op-eds in The Daily and
student groups forming with the explicit in
tention of making this concert happen," said
Stephen Trusheim 'l3, one of the members of
the organizing committee for the event
The concert, which will take place in the
late afternoon or early evening on May 19,
has yet to sign a headliner. An email was sent

out to many of the campus email lists with in
formation about the event, as well as a survey
asking students to choose which artists they
would like to see.

"We have a lot of great recommendations
for artists that weren't on our list," Trusheim
said, noting that over 1,500 students had
taken the survey by Wednesday evening. In
addition, he noted that many of the com
ments have been very positive and encourag
ing, urging the committee to make this an an
nual event.

That may prove to be a daunting task
given the budget of the concert $150,000 at
its lowest estimate and the amount of
work required to plan such an -event. Exter-
