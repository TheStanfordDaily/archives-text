## Frost Amphitheater to host spring concert 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
Frost Amphitheater has a long history as a
venue for raucous music festivals and famous
artists. Jefferson Airplane played there in the
late 19605, and the prominent space has also
seen Miles Davis, Joan Baez and the Grateful
Dead, the latter of whom played there more
than a dozen times.
According to an article written by Ivan
Maisel 'Bl in Stanford Magazine, the venue
was shut down for several years during the
height of the Vietnam War after several alter
cations broke out among concert attendees.
Frost is now largely unused, plagued by a lack
of modern equipment and lingering fears
over safety.

That long drought will come to an end this
May when a "Spring Fling" the official
name is not yet decided will take place on
Frost's grassy field.

The concert which has an artist sugges
tion list that includes MGMT, Beirut, Vam
pire Weekend, Black Keys and many more
has been in the works for more than a year
now.

"There was a lot of student interest in it
last spring, between op-eds in The Daily and
student groups forming with the explicit in
tention of making this concert happen," said
Stephen Trusheim 'l3, one of the members of
the organizing committee for the event
The concert, which will take place in the
late afternoon or early evening on May 19,
has yet to sign a headliner. An email was sent

out to many of the campus email lists with in
formation about the event, as well as a survey
asking students to choose which artists they
would like to see.

"We have a lot of great recommendations
for artists that weren't on our list," Trusheim
said, noting that over 1,500 students had
taken the survey by Wednesday evening. In
addition, he noted that many of the com
ments have been very positive and encourag
ing, urging the committee to make this an an
nual event.

That may prove to be a daunting task
given the budget of the concert $150,000 at
its lowest estimate and the amount of
work required to plan such an -event. Exter-
nal sources of revenue, such as
sponsorship, are going to be ex
plored after an artist is signed.
Funding will largely come
from the Stanford Concert Net
work (SCN), which has given
$75,000 of its special fees money
to the event. In addition, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
gave the concert committee a
$35,000 grant from a rarely used
buffer fund. Several University
offices notably the Office of
Special Events and Planning
(OSEP) and the Office of Alco
hol Policy and Education
(OAPE) have also given
money to the event.
More than their funding how
ever, Trusheim stressed the criti
cal importance of the time and
dedication many University ad
ministrators have given to the
project.

The executive board in charge
of planning the event consists of
Trusheim, Director of SCN Emily
Pollock 'l3, Associate Director of
Student Activities and Leader
ship (SAL) Snehal Naik, Execu
tive Director of OSEP Elaine
Enos, Events Manager of OSEP
Rachel Mizenko and former
ASSU Executive Angelina Car
dona 'll.

"Students bring a lot of money
to the table, but we don't have the
expertise to hold a concert of this
magnitude," Trusheim said,
whereas administrators have ex
tensive experience in planning
such events.
Trusheim went into detail re
garding the arduous process of
trying to book a high-profile
artist. In addition to expensive
fees, many bands require other fi
nancial or hospitality arrange
ments that can put a strain on the
organizing committee.
Despite the difficulties,
Trusheim is confident the concert
will be a success for the entire
campus.
"We're trying as much as pos
sible to make a spring concert
that we can all be proud of and
capstone our year together," he
said.
