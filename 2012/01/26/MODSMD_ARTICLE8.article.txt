## Ford to open research center in PA Move part of larger initiative to bring innovation to the industry 
### KATE ABBOTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Silicon Valley's potential newest
industry may be cars. Automotive
company Ford recently announced
plans to open a research innovation
center in Palo Alto, joining a growing
community of vehicle manufacturers
tapping into the Valley's resources.
The company announced in early
January that it plans to open the lab
near Stanford's campus and would
employ about 15 people. The center is
scheduled to open in the beginning
months of 2012.

Ford is currently a member of the
Center for Automotive Research at
Stanford (CARS) affiliate pro
gram, which is run through the
University's Mechanical Engi
neering Department. Companies
that serve as affiliates are granted
access to shared research and edu
cation initiatives on campus.
According to CARS Executive
Director Sven Beiker, Ford's part
nership with the program may
have been "part of a strategy" to
enter the Silicon Valley.
"The center of gravity is shift
ing in the automotive world," he
said. "It used to be about horse
power and speed and those are
still important but it's also now
megabytes and bits per second.
These things are starting to matter
in the car world."
Some of Ford's newer model
cars feature applications such as
Sync, a voice-activated entertain
ment system and a touch-screen
dashboard developed in conjunc
tion with Microsoft. Beiken said
the move out west is away for the
company to keep in touch with
other "leading-edge technologies
being explored here."
"The automobile is seen as the

final frontier in the connected
lifestyle," Beiken said.
"On the one hand, the car is al
ready a computer on wheels...
but this so far has mainly been to
control the vehicle itself; it's not so
much a computer for the driver to
play with.
"And all of these things are
now in cars because we're bringing
smartphones to the car. The re
search is now focusing on how we
do this safely."
Ford's Chief Technical Officer
Paul Mascarenas said in a press
conference that the center is "a
very natural extension into one of
the most innovative communities
in the world."
Beiken warned that it is signifi
cantly more expensive to conduct
business in Silicon Valley and that
corporate executives back at
headquarters may reject the new
ideas that come out of the research
center. Fie called the mindset of
the Valley "a little bit of a trouble
maker."
"But this is what these compa
nies want and need: to get fresh
thinking, detour from the thinking
corporate mindset," he said.
Representatives for Ford could
not be reached for comment.
