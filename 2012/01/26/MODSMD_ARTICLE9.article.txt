## Picturing Nature 
### CARA REICHARD 
One Saturday morning
this fall, a cluster of
Stanford students
stood, knelt and
crouched with cam
eras strapped around their necks,
exploring the California red
woods. They peered down into the
grass and up the enormous trunks
in search of the perfect photo
and for students enrolled in the
sophomore seminar "Photograph
ing Nature" fall quarter, this was
just a typical day in the classroom.
"The objective of the class was
to explore the use of the camera as
a tool for understanding the natu
ral world around us," said Robert
Siegel, associate professor of mi
crobiology and immunology, who
taught the class. "The key to the
class was combining a lot of sci
ence with photography."
Every weekend, the class went
on a field trip to somewhere new.
They explored different parts of
the Stanford campus and traveled
to the Baylands, Pescadero State
Beach and other parts of the Bay
Area.

One week, they were instructed
to pick an object as the subject of
their photographs and then change
every setting on the camera. An
other week, they had to change the
perspective with which they fo
cused on a particular object
from close up, far away, under
neath or more and the assign
ment changed each trip.
"My favorite part of the class
was going on these excursions and
getting to know Northern Califor
nia better and learning to take bet
ter nature photos," said Zack Gold
'l5.

On Thursdays, the class would
meet to share their photos from
the previous weekend.
"We would choose five or six to
make into a PowerPoint," said
Sushmita Sridhar 'l4. "We would
use those to talk about a particular
plant or animal."
Along with presenting their
photographs, students were ex
pected to have done research on
whatever aspect of nature these
photos were showing.
"The actual products that the
students were producing were
weekly reports on some aspect of

nature that they would use to com
municate information," Siegel
said.
Within the bounds of the as
signment, the students were free to
photograph whatever they want
ed.
"One week, someone did a
whole presentation on clouds,"
Siegel said. "One person did a
presentation on bird feed. It's fas
cinating to me what sort of things
they pick up on."
Because of this freedom of
focus topic, students were able to
work on subject matter that really
interested them.
"I was really fond of more
macro photos, when I was able to
get really close to something,"
Sridhar said. "There was this west
ern spotted cucumber beetle that I
was following around that was
really cool because of its colors and
how close I was able to get to that."
In addition to shaping students'
perspectives of nature, the presen
tations sometimes affect Siegel's
as well.

"We were up at Jasper Ridge
and somebody did a report on
hover flies," Siegel said. "Hover
flies were not in my radar screen;
but now whenever we go out, I'm
very conscious of hover flies."
According to Siegel, what often
made the photographs most inter
esting was the perspective.

"One of the most memorable
ones was a picture of this rabbit
outside," Siegel said. "It's through
a window, and then you realize
there's a silhouette of a cat looking
outside at the rabbit. It's sort of the
perspective of the cat. You would
immediately be struck by the emo
tion of it."

While the class sought to em
phasize the thematic aspects of the
photos taken for assignments, the
photography naturally was a key
component.

"The most challenging part was
learning to use the camera, figur
ing out the technical aspects of it,"
Sridhar said. "I've never taken a

digital SLR [single-lens reflex
camera] photography class; I've
never used one before."
Nonetheless, Siegel hoped to
distance the course from just
learning the mechanics of operat
ing a camera, emphasizing that
this was much more than simply a
digital photography class.
"Only about half the class had
their own SLR," Siegel said. "Al
though we did a lot of how-to
things, they were how-to in terms
of communicating your message."
The course's focus on photog
raphy had more to do with under
standing the way in which a pic
ture can communicate a message
or idea than it did with the techni
cal aspects of photography.

"We understand how to com
municate in a written fashion,"
Siegel said. "But we live in a world
that is more and more dominated
by pictures. One of the things we
tried to do was deconstruct a pic
ture. We were looking at those ele
ments of a picture in conjunction
with trying to communicate about
science."
