Stanford's Information Security Office Memo #23
Backups are a lifesaver because they enable
recovery of your assignments, saved email,
pictures, essays, and other local PC files when
your data is lost due to:
• Accidential Deletion • Fire, flood, etc.
• Hardware failure • Hacking
Avoid headaches! Plan ahead by visiting:
