# SEEING GREEN
## Speak softly, for you carry a scientific stick 
### Holly Moeller 
LINCOLN, N.Z. THERE'S
nothing like finding your
self 7,000 miles from home,
biking to work on the "wrong"
side of the road and scrambling to
mobilize a 10-week field project,
to make you reevaluate where
your research is going.
I find myself doing such hard
thinking at odd intervals, usually
when science is treating me either
very poorly or very well, or when
some environmental catastrophe
rouses the media. Mostly, I ask
myself, "Does this research mat
ter? Am I doing enough?"
Such questions abound among
young ecologists, who balance be
tween two supposed extremes:
"pure science" and "applied re
search." The former generally
refers to so-called "basic science,"
or knowledge for knowledge's
sake. Meanwhile, "applied" work
leverages this knowledge to, for
example, arm policymakers with
data.

I find applied research easier
to explain (and justify, since my
funding comes out of national tax
coffers) to others. It's often more
personally fulfilling too, since I
know how badly the world needs
ecologists to help find a new equi
librium between humans and fi
nite planetary resources. Still, I
don't study ecology because I
want to calculate rates of species
loss as a function of urbanization:
I mostly want to do basic science.
Somehow, personal interest has to
balance with social responsibility.
Every senior scientist has an
opinion on how applied a Ph.D.
thesis should be. When I first filed
graduate applications four years
ago, my advisors cautioned me
against the numerous interdisci
plinary programs that merged sci
ence and policy. (The traditional
view holds that one should
demonstrate pure-science re
search potential before dabbling
in the murky waters of policy.)

Since then, times have
changed. Academic job prospects
for interdisciplinary alumni have
improved, alongside growing re
spect for the programs and grow
ing demand for professionals who
can move between the ivory
tower and Capitol Hill. (That did

n't stop one Harvard professor
from telling me that "Ph.D.s
should only be given for hard sci
ence, At least then you can claim
to be an expert in something." My
rejection letter arrived two
months later.)
The beauty of science, of
course, is that you never know
what you're going to get. That's
why we do basic research: it's pro
duced some of our greatest ap
plied discoveries. But if you stum
ble upon such a discovery in envi
ronmental science, you face more
ethical questions.
Publicly funded scientists gen
erally believe that scientific work
is not complete unless it's commu
nicated to others. The most widely
accepted indeed, demanded

form of such communication is
the scientific paper, an artifact of
scientific inbreeding generally
about as comprehensible (and as
likely to be read) as a legal brief.
Sure, precis of some papers make
the popular rounds, but for the
most part, the science that reaches
the public eye came from scien
tists who felt their ethical respon
sibility didn't end with talking to
their peers. These are the scien
tists who brought us testimonials
on the ozone hole, ocean acidifi
cation and overfishing.
Many of these scientists have
rallied public support and moti
vated policy changes. Yet no good
deed goes unpunished. For exam
ple, as the climate change "de
bate" continues in the public
sphere, climate scientists have
borne the brunt of jokes, had rep
utations smeared and even re
ceived death threats from people
too set in their beliefs to acknowl
edge scientific consensus.
If public censure weren't bad
enough, speaking up can have un
fortunate professional conse
quences. You see, the thing that
scientists value most is objectivity:
the scientific method only works
if we can set up and interpret ex
periments with an open mind. The
most serious accusation you can
level at a researcher is that of bias,
because bias means he or she may
be deliberately or subconsciously
manipulating results.
Ignoring the fact that we all

have at least some degree of bias
towards one thing or another,
some argue that by raising their
voices in the public sphere, scien
tists expose themselves as biased
observers, undermining society's
trust in their expertise. "Advoca
cy" has become a dirty word, im
plying a loss of impartiality and,
heaven forbid, an opinion.
Since scientists are people too,
it seems frightfully unfair to cen
sor their opinions. In the last few
years, most ecologists have agreed
that opinions are acceptable, so
long as you clearly distinguish be
tween your personal values and
the meaning of your scientific re
sults results that should be im
partially presented quickly and
unambiguously without overstep
ping the bounds of your expertise.
Here's where I fret briefly
about the non-expert content of
my columns, and remind you that
these are just the opinions of a
graduate student who really
hopes she's not ruining her career
with weekly rants about the state
of our planet.
As for my scientific soul
searching, I recite my elevator
pitch every morning: all over the
world, plant and animal species
are introduced by humans to
places that they don't belong
sometimes with really nasty con
sequences, like here in New
Zealand, where foreign trees car
pet the hills. We think their suc
cess might depend on mycor
rhizae, soil fungi that help the tree
gather critical nutrients. Figure
out the below-ground story, figure
out the aboveground landscape.
Plus, what's cooler than photo
synthesis and mushrooms on the
other side of the world?

ronmental science, you face more
ethical questions.
Publicly funded scientists gen
erally believe that scientific work
is not complete unless it's commu
nicated to others. The most widely
accepted indeed, demanded

form of such communication is
the scientific paper, an artifact of
scientific inbreeding generally
about as comprehensible (and as
likely to be read) as a legal brief.
Sure, precis of some papers make
the popular rounds, but for the
most part, the science that reaches
the public eye came from scien
tists who felt their ethical respon
sibility didn't end with talking to
their peers. These are the scien
tists who brought us testimonials
on the ozone hole, ocean acidifi
cation and overfishing.
Many of these scientists have
rallied public support and moti
vated policy changes. Yet no good
deed goes unpunished. For exam
ple, as the climate change "de
bate" continues in the public
sphere, climate scientists have
borne the brunt of jokes, had rep
utations smeared and even re
ceived death threats from people
too set in their beliefs to acknowl
edge scientific consensus.
If public censure weren't bad
enough, speaking up can have un
fortunate professional conse
quences. You see, the thing that
scientists value most is objectivity:
the scientific method only works
if we can set up and interpret ex
periments with an open mind. The
most serious accusation you can
level at a researcher is that of bias,
because bias means he or she may
be deliberately or subconsciously
manipulating results.
Ignoring the fact that we all

have at least some degree of bias
towards one thing or another,
some argue that by raising their
voices in the public sphere, scien
tists expose themselves as biased
observers, undermining society's
trust in their expertise. "Advoca
cy" has become a dirty word, im
plying a loss of impartiality and,
heaven forbid, an opinion.
Since scientists are people too,
it seems frightfully unfair to cen
sor their opinions. In the last few
years, most ecologists have agreed
that opinions are acceptable, so
long as you clearly distinguish be
tween your personal values and
the meaning of your scientific re
sults results that should be im
partially presented quickly and
unambiguously without overstep
ping the bounds of your expertise.
Here's where I fret briefly
about the non-expert content of
my columns, and remind you that
these are just the opinions of a
graduate student who really
hopes she's not ruining her career
with weekly rants about the state
of our planet.
As for my scientific soul
searching, I recite my elevator
pitch every morning: all over the
world, plant and animal species
are introduced by humans to
places that they don't belong
sometimes with really nasty con
sequences, like here in New
Zealand, where foreign trees car
pet the hills. We think their suc
cess might depend on mycor
rhizae, soil fungi that help the tree
gather critical nutrients. Figure
out the below-ground story, figure
out the aboveground landscape.
Plus, what's cooler than photo
synthesis and mushrooms on the
other side of the world?

LINCOLN, N.Z. THERE'S
nothing like finding your
self 7,000 miles from home,
biking to work on the "wrong"
side of the road and scrambling to
mobilize a 10-week field project,
to make you reevaluate where
your research is going.
I find myself doing such hard
thinking at odd intervals, usually
when science is treating me either
very poorly or very well, or when
some environmental catastrophe
rouses the media. Mostly, I ask
myself, "Does this research mat
ter? Am I doing enough?"
Such questions abound among
young ecologists, who balance be
tween two supposed extremes:
"pure science" and "applied re
search." The former generally
refers to so-called "basic science,"
or knowledge for knowledge's
sake. Meanwhile, "applied" work
leverages this knowledge to, for
example, arm policymakers with
data.

I find applied research easier
to explain (and justify, since my
funding comes out of national tax
coffers) to others. It's often more
personally fulfilling too, since I
know how badly the world needs
ecologists to help find a new equi
librium between humans and fi
nite planetary resources. Still, I
don't study ecology because I
want to calculate rates of species
loss as a function of urbanization:
I mostly want to do basic science.
Somehow, personal interest has to
balance with social responsibility.
Every senior scientist has an
opinion on how applied a Ph.D.
thesis should be. When I first filed
graduate applications four years
ago, my advisors cautioned me
against the numerous interdisci
plinary programs that merged sci
ence and policy. (The traditional
view holds that one should
demonstrate pure-science re
search potential before dabbling
in the murky waters of policy.)

Since then, times have
changed. Academic job prospects
for interdisciplinary alumni have
improved, alongside growing re
spect for the programs and grow
ing demand for professionals who
can move between the ivory
tower and Capitol Hill. (That did

n't stop one Harvard professor
from telling me that "Ph.D.s
should only be given for hard sci
ence, At least then you can claim
to be an expert in something." My
rejection letter arrived two
months later.)
The beauty of science, of
course, is that you never know
what you're going to get. That's
why we do basic research: it's pro
duced some of our greatest ap
plied discoveries. But if you stum
ble upon such a discovery in envi
ronmental science, you face more
ethical questions.
