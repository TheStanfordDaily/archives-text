# THE
						MIXED MESSAGES OF MODERNISM
## Piracy in perspective 
### D.S. Nelson 
The intricacies of law
those giant red books that
law students tote around, or
the very phrase "tort reform"
are about as interesting to most
people as 1920s Hungarian silent
film. The Stop Online Piracy
(SOPA) and Protect IP (PIPA)
Acts brought to the fore today's
most meaningful legal issue.
Many websites (Google, Face
book and Reddit, among others)
responded forcefully, in part for
their own survival, to the prospect
of increased regulation.
Wikipedia's daylong blackout, the
most prominent of the protests,
embodied the passionate assault
on SOPA and PIPA. The Inter
net's users and providers, as dis
united and disorganized as they
are, managed to string together a
strong, collective response.
The battle between Congress
and our loyal search engines,
stalking-enablers and informa
tion-providers was styled like this:
entrepreneurs against the enter
tainment titans, providers of ab
surd salaries to equally absurd fig

ures like the Kardashians; a battle
of the new and just versus the old
and stubborn.
It's true that the entertainment
industry is off. It's a massive busi
ness. It makes enormous sums. Its
stars are paid in millions, often
for doing little more than show
ing a cameraman their lavish
lifestyle. I find myself wondering
why certain celebrities are fa
mous. Sometimes even trusty
Wikipedia can't provide a solid
answer. Those who criticize Wall
Street for absurd pay scales can
find ready targets on the silver
screen. Finding its enemy, the
Web unleashed its anger with fe
rocity. They claimed it to be a de
fense of freedom. To some ex
tent, they had the right to. Link
ing to illegal content probably
should not be made illegal.
The content, however, re
mains a problem. Piracy is rarely
discussed as an ethical issue, but
it is one. It was created by people
who rely on its purchase for in
come and who have the right to
expect it. As commercialism has

crept into art and the markets for
music, movies and TV grown, the
personal connections we held
with rock stars and actors have
diminished. No longer would one
feel bad for shortchanging an
artist, a producer or a studio.
Thinking in the short term, it
does not pain me when Justin
Bieber loses income or when
Steven Spielberg's movies lose a
small part of their attendance.
They will make millions with or
without my patronage.
Many take umbrage with the
proliferation of artists who
achieve fame merely on their
ability to appeal, if only provid
ing modest pleasure, to the
widest audiences and therefore
be more profitable. That per
ceived lack of intrinsic value
often provides the little justifica
tion Web users need to download
relentlessly why should they
have to pay for things whose
prices are driven up in pursuit of
profits, and whose worth is so lit
tle? Some, not concerned with
the quality of the work but with
the motivations of its producers,
simply feel no obligation to pay.
The Free Culture movement and
others believe that copyright
laws simply detract from our cul

ture and our freedoms. Most,
however, take the motivations
and manners of the entertain
ment industry to be an unspoken
justification for piracy.
The practice of piracy has per
haps made the entertainment in
dustry the monolith it is. The dis
tortion of the market that is
caused by people downloading
instead of buying contributes to
that as well. In legal consump
tion, consumers wield immense
power. In buying products, con
sumers lend approval, funds and
encouragement for future proj
ects. Downloading content for
feits that power. It absents con
sumers from economic dialogue.
It is a comfort that the market for
media is so large that mere scale
prevents this from largely dis
torting social interests.
But on the margins, those ac
tions can push smaller producers,
especially of niche content, out of
the market. Producers lose their
incentive to produce up-and-com
ing artists. New genres and artistic
adventure are reduced when com
panies realize that being adventur
ous in their actions is much less
economically rational than pro
ducing typical content for guaran
teed markets. Our public culture

becomes vapid and boring because
monetary concerns overpower
artistic ones, in large part due to
the reduced overall market.

The piracy market is just like
any other illegal one: black, off the
grid and difficult to analyze or
track. As such, its contribution to
society's tastes is greatly dimin
ished. The overall consumer base
is reduced. The content produced,
the choices in creative thought re
quire greater consideration of the
commercial element. Maximally
profitable content will be pushed
to the front, diminishing the diver
sity and adventurousness of our
media. So maybe we, as conscious
consumers, should change our
habits and realize the effect they
have on culture, which we hope to
entertain us for years to come.
