## TIME TO REBOUND 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Following a devastating road trip through
Washington, the Stanford men's basketball
team hopes to right the ship Sunday when it
travels across the Bay to take on rival Califor
nia.
The Cardinal (15-5,5-3 Pac-12) has cooled
off considerably following its 10-1 start, going
just 5-4 since beating USC at home on Dec. 31.
The recent struggles have dropped Stanford to
fifth in the conference, although the weakness
of the league leaves the Card just one game
back of first place.
Stanford has suffered from the injury woes
of sophomore forward Dwight Powell, who has
not been able to progress as expected. The ab
sence of a healthy Powell has noticeably hurt
the Card's frontcourt depth. However, Stan
ford head coach Johnny Dawkins is confident
that his highly touted recruit will be able to con
tribute during the latter half of the conference
schedule.
"We don't like to make excuses, but the
young man has gone through a lot with his
ankle, with his heel," Dawkins said. "He hadn't
re-injured it in quite some time, so it's been able
to heal properly. He's starting to get back to
form, which is exciting for us."
Cal (16-5,6-2), which currently holds a share
of the Pac-12 lead, had won four consecutive
conference games before losing a shocker to
Washington State on Saturday. The Golden
Bears are led by sophomore star Allen Crabbe,
who averages nearly 16 points per game on 45-
percent shooting from behind the arc. Crabbe
has eclipsed the 20-point mark six times this
season.
Stanford must improve its three-point
shooting this weekend. The Card has connect
ed on just seven of its previous 32 attempts
from distance.
The lone bright spot for the team last week
end, senior forward Josh Owens, did not miss a

shot from the field against Washington State
but managed just eight attempts. Look for
Stanford to feed Owens early in order to limit
its reliance on perimeter scoring.
"Josh is having a terrific season," Dawkins
said. "He's been a senior leader for us. He's re
ally been our most consistent player night-in
and night-out. And he's really happy with his
overall development. He's worked extremely
hard this off-season, and I think it shows in his
play."
Owens and the rest of the squad will need to
bring their top game against the Bears. Despite
its five losses, Cal which boasts three players
averaging at least 13 points per game is the

most talented team the Cardinal has faced
since its six-point loss to No. 4 Syracuse in No
vember.
"Cal is a good basketball team," Dawkins
said. "You know they're going to execute very
well offensively. They're a very good defensive
team. They just play sound basketball."
Incredibly, with a win on Sunday and a little
bit of help, Stanford can find itself back atop
the conference as quickly as it surrendered its
lead. The game tips off in Haas Pavilion at 5:30
p.m.

Senior guard Jarrett Mann was held to nine points in two games against Cal last year. Even
though his playing time has dropped this season, Mann will have to contribute strongly Sunday.
