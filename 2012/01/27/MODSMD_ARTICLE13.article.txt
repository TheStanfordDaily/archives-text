# MEN'S TENNIS
## Card hosts three teams in ITA Kickoff 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team returns
home to a flurry of dual matches this week
end after kicking off its season last week in
Oklahoma. The Cardinal, which won both its
matches on the road trip, will participate in
the ITA Kick-Off Weekend, which features
four schools at each of 15 host locations vying
to advance to next month's prestigious Na
tional Team Indoor Championships. Joining
the No. 6 Cardinal at the Taube Family Tennis
Center will be No. 48 Boise State, No. 50

Santa Clara and No. 64 Saint Mary's.
Play will begin Friday morning at 10 a.m.
with a matchup of Broncos: the Boise State
Broncos taking on the team with the same
name from Santa Clara. The Stanford match
will begin at 2 p.m. when they will face off
against the Saint Mary's Gaels. The tourna
ment is a simple two-round event: The losers
of Friday's matches square off at 10 a.m. on
Saturday, the winners at 2 p.m.
All four of these teams are familiar with
one another in fact, Boise State and Saint
Mary's played this past Sunday, with Boise
State taking down the Gaels 5-2. Last season

Stanford easily defeated both Boise State
and Santa Clara. This familiarity is sure to be
a blessing for the Stanford squad that is still
missing its best player, senior Bradley Klahn.
The absence of Klahn, who is out for about
another month with an injury, could turn out
to be a blessing in disguise for a young Cardi
nal team that is trying to define itself.
"Without Brad, it's going to be a challenge
for the guys," said head coach John
Whitlinger. "Brad's absence means that some
of the other guys are going to have to step up,
which could be a good thing."
In last weekend's matches
against Tulsa and North Carolina,
the two youngest members of
Whitlinger's team, freshmen
John Morrissey and Robert
Stinemann, did just what their
coach wanted and helped fill the
void, going a combined 3-1 in sin
gles matches. The two freshmen
are both highly touted recruits
from opposite sides of the world
Morrissey is from Dublin,
Stineman is from Illinois and
stand to be stalwarts for
Whitlinger's squad for four years
to come.
Their performance has already
garnered praise from some of the
team's elder players.
"Our freshmen played awe
some," said sophomore Jamin
Ball. "You wouldn't have known it
was their first dual matches. We
have a lot of team chemistry and
are looking to build off this mo
mentum."
Morrissey's formative first
matches in collegiate team tennis
were a clearly positive experience.
"It was an amazing experience
to play for the Stanford tennis
team and one that I will remem
ber for a long time," he said. "As a
tennis player I am used to compet
ing individually so it was an amaz
ing experience to be part of a
team, to all be working and fight
ing together to achieve the same
goal."

Whitlinger is certainly hoping
that his team continues to build on
its momentum in this weekend's
two matches. The play of his two
star freshmen will surely play a
large part in deciding that out
come.

Senior Ryan Thacher has taken over as the Cardinal's resident veteran
in the absence of star senior Bradley Klahn, who is still out for about a
month with an injury. Stanford's younger players will continue to gain
valuable experience as the squad progresses without Klahn.
