# FENDING OFF THE BEARS

### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This weekend the Stanford
women's basketball team faces
cross-Bay rival California in a cru
cial contest at home.

On a 14-game undefeated
streak that stretches back to an
early-season loss to Connecticut,
the Cardinal (17-1, 8-0 Pac-12) is
guaranteed to still lead the Pac-12
on Saturday, but this could be the
toughest test at Maples so far this
season. After recovering from two
losses in Los Angeles in the open
ing weekend of Pac-12 play, Cali
fornia (15-5, 6-2 Pac-12) has won
six straight and sits in the second
spot in the conference.
Should Cal want to keep
dreams of an inaugural Pac-12
conference title alive, it will surely
need to defeat Stanford on Satur
day. A win would put the Golden
Bears just one game behind the
leaders with the return leg of
the Battle of the Bay still to play in
March and the would keep its
fate still in Cal's hands, but a
three-game deficit against a team
like the Cardinal would seem al
most impossible to get back.
Though the Golden Bears hold
the honor of being both the last
Pac-12 team to have beaten the
Card, in a 57-54 win in Berkeley in
January 2009, and the last Pac-12
team to have left Maples Pavilion
victorious, after a 72-57 victory in
February 2007. Stanford has not
lost three or more games in the
conference since the 2003-04 sea
son.
Due to the Pac-12's 18-game
schedule the Card played the two
Washington schools for the only
time last weekend, and so, as the
ninth game Stanford will have
played, this contest also marks the
half-way point in the conference.
The clock is definitely ticking for
any team that wants to take the
title away from the Farm.
While the Bears are led in
points-per-game by junior guard
Layshia Clarendon, who is 15th in
scoring in the Pac-12 with 10.9,
Stanford can rely on its dominant
sisters senior forward

Nnemkadi Ogwumike and sopho
more forward Chiney Ogwumike,
first with 22.9 points per game and
seventh with 19.1, respectively.
However, a key area where Cal
may have an advantage could be
rebounding. Golden Bear red
shirt sophomore Gennifer Bran
don is only narrowly second in

boards per game (11.0) to
Nnemkadi Ogwumike (11.2), and
Berkeley leads the Pac-12 in both
offensive and defensive rebound
ing percentages.

Lindsay Gottlieb will still need to

find away to deal with Stanford's
star sisters. Chiney Ogwumike
recorded her seventh and eighth
double-doubles against the Wash
ington schools last weekend and
was named Bank of the West Pac
-12 Women's Basketball Player of

the Week for the second-straight
week. The player she deposed a
fortnight back was her sibling
Nnemkadi Ogwumike, who
comes into the rivalry game this
weekend needing just five points
to tie for fourth on Stanford's all
time scoring list with Val Whiting.
Even holding these two quiet
might not work, however. When
Oregon attempted that, the Card
punished the Ducks from outside,
sinking 14 three-pointers. Since

that contest the Card has strug
gled from beyond the arc, but
freshman forward Taylor Green
field's 4-for-5 from outside
against Washington perhaps sig
nals that the drought is coming to
an end.
Stanford is set to take on Cal at
2 p.m. this Saturday at Maples
Pavilion.
