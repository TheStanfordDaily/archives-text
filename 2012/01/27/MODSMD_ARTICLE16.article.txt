# Tim Thomas talks too tough

The traditional White
House visit for the de
fending Stanley Cup
(yes, that's hockey)
Champions is always a
sight to see. Even though each
year's MLB, NFL and NBA cham
pions along with a host of
NCAA-title-winning teams
also get to meet America's com
mander in chief, the NHL's rendi
tion is quite unique. It's known for
kooky mispronunciations, the
usual lack of presidential hockey
knowledge and its tendency to set
annual records for the highest con
centration of "eh's" in White
House history.
As such, there's always a spot
light on the few visiting players who
actually happen to be American, es
pecially if they played a key part in
their team's title run. This year was
no different, and Flint, Mich, native
Tim Thomas the Boston Bruins'
starting goalie who became just the
second American in history to win
the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff
MVP got by far the most media
attention when the team visited
Washington, D.C. this Monday.
That's because, as one of only
two Americans on Boston's 2011
Cup-winning squad, Thomas decid
ed that he didn't want to visit the
White House, shake the president's
hand and go through with the requi
site photo-op. Explaining on Face
book that "the Federal government
has grown out of control, threaten
ing the Rights, Liberties, and Prop
erty of the People," Thomas denied
that his decision was partisan but
cited his "right as a Free Citizen" to
skip the event.
Instead, he sat around until the
Bruins' Tuesday matchup with the
Washington Capitals, a game for
which he was promptly and proper
ly benched.
Since then, Thomas has been
widely criticized in the media for let
ting his teammates down and creat
ing widespread embarrassment for
the Bruins organization. Even Mas
sachusetts governor Deval Patrick
chimed in about how "we're losing
in this country basic courtesy and
grace."
I'm not so concerned with how
polite Thomas was; President
Obama has to deal with Washing
ton's cutthroat political landscape
on a daily basis, so I doubt he's going
to be all that offended by a hockey
player's political beliefs. And of
course, as an American, Thomas has
every right to do as he pleases and
have his own political identity.
But this whole act has been a
complete abuse of Thomas' power
as a prominent sports figure. If he
wants to make political statements
he should throw away the skates,
run for office and remove any fa
cade that he should be idolized by
the people of Boston.
Sports fans have an inherent,
blind trust in athletes. We know their
personal lives aren't perfect. I'm
well aware of the steroid allegations
against Barry Bonds, the marriage
scandal Tiger Woods is dealing with
and the second-degree vehicular
homicide on Dany Heatley's
record. But because of their (albeit
severed) connections to the Giants,
Cardinal and Sharks, I can't help but
feeling a soft spot for them. Sports
just couldn't work any other way
fans wouldn't pay to cheer for ath
letes they couldn't get behind.
So as public figures that we have
decided to identify ourselves with
(and contribute to their bankroll),
professional athletes have a profes
sional responsibility to keep their
mouths shut on political issues. Sure,
players can do a whole lot of good
by openly supporting charitable
causes. But taking disestablishmen
tarian political stances on a public
stage is hardly that. At this point,
you probably have a whole bunch of
naive, five-year-old Bostonians who
are scared to death by the "threat"
to their "Rights, Liberties, and Prop
erty." And the only way to stop them
from marching on Washington is to
tell them that you shouldn't listen to
the man wearing that jersey, that
he's wrong, that he was rude to the
president of the United States.
Tim Thomas is no monster hid
ing in the closet, but for parents of
young Bruins fans that don't hap
pen to be members of the Tea Party,
that's the only way they can treat
him if they don't want their kids de
veloping random political ideolo
gies. Thomas has set up the kids of
