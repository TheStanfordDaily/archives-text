# TOP-10 FOES AWAIT

Coming off a win over rival Cal
ifornia last Friday, the Stanford
men's gymnastics team looks to
continue its success this Saturday in
the Stanford Open at 7 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion. Despite having
competed against Cal twice in its
first two meets of the season with
the season series tied now at one
apiece, the Cardinal is not done
with the Bears just yet, as No. 6
Stanford will host No. 5 Cal, No. 9
Nebraska and unranked Washing
ton in Saturday's meet.
While playing the same team
three times in three meets may be
repetitive for sure, Stanford head
coach Thorn Glielmi does not mind
it too much.
"As long as both teams are
good, they both push each other to
be better," he said. "Especially if it's
a rivalry."
The only real negative to this sit
uation, Glielmi believes, is that
Stanford gets less exposure to the
national media by only playing on
the West Coast to start out the sea
son.
What has been clear this far
through the season has been the
importance of competing in a
team's home gym. Stanford lost to
Cal by 6.100 points in the first meet
in Berkeley, yet came away with a

4.750-point victory in Burnham last
week. Glielmi mentions that it is "a
definite advantage" to compete at
home, as most Stanford meets fill
the stands and are loud and ener
getic.

The Cardinal carries fewer play
ers on its roster than most teams
do, which forces certain players to
compete in more events than they
normally might. While Stanford
has plenty of talent in each event, it
cannot always put up the six play
ers to compete in each event, which
gives the Cardinal fewer chances to
maximize its score when it takes
the four best scores out of six com
petitors for each event. However,
the Cardinal remains unfazed by
the lack of depth.
"There is definitely more pres
sure on each of the competitors, but
the guys handle it well," Glielmi
said.
The men will improve to 3-1 if
they come away with a first place
finish in the Open.
With a thrilling start to its sea
son, the Stanford women's gymnas
tics team brings its 4-0 record to No.
4 Oregon State University in a Fri
day-night meet. Stanford won the
NorCal Quad Meet in Burnham
Pavilion to start the season strong,
but had more difficulty putting
away conference opponent Wash
ington in its most recent come
from-behind victory last Sunday.

The Cardinal likely has an even
bigger challenge ahead of it on Fri
day, however, as the team goes on
the road for the first time to face a
Beavers team that won the Pac-10
last year. The Beavers are high
lighted by senior Leslie Mak, the
Pac-f 0 Gymnast of the Year in 2011
who specializes in the balance
beam. Last year the Cardinal split
its season series with Oregon State,
though the Beavers did come away
with a victory in the last two meets,
including the Pac-10 Champi
onships.
Oregon State, like Stanford, has
not lost yet this year, earning it the
No. 4 ranking in the country in the
process. The Beavers beat No. 13
Arizona State on the road last
week by 0.450 points, led by Mak's
career-high 9.950 score on the
beam.
Stanford, however, has its fair
share of impressive performances
so far this year as well. Senior
Nicole Pechanec won the all
around competition against Wash
ington last week with a 39.250 score,
highlighted by her 9.875 on the
floor. Junior Ashley Brown has also
had a very noteworthy start to the
year, posting two 9.900's in the
beam and floor in last week's com
petition.

Senior Nicole Pechanec's 39.250 all-around score against Washington
was the best at the meet, and the Cardinal could use another high score
from her as it looks to knock off No. 4 Oregon State on the road.
