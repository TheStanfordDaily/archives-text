## Marquee matchup comes to Burnham UNDEFEATED PAC-12 SQUADS MEET 
### PALANI ESWARAN STAFF WRITER 
This Sunday afternoon, Stan
ford men's wrestling will take to
the mat against the No. 17 Ore
gon State Beavers at Burnham
Pavilion. This dual is undoubt
edly the most important of the
season for both the Cardinal (8-
5, 4-0 Pac-12) and the Beavers
(7-2, 4-0), as the winner of this
match will likely claim the Pac
-12 regular season title.
Thus far, Oregon State has
had a very successful season.
Their only two losses are to No.
15 Missouri by three points and
No. 12 Wyoming by one. Oregon
State and Stanford have had
four common dual opponents:
Boise State, Missouri, Cal State-
Bakersfield and Cal Poly. Both
teams are 3-1 against those
squads, their only losses coming
against Missouri. However,
Oregon State looked much
more impressive in those four
matches than Stanford. While
the Cardinal wrestled close
matches against Cal Poly and
Boise State, the Beavers blew
both teams out. In the dual
against Missouri, Stanford lost
handily, but Oregon State al
most pulled the upset.

The two teams have also
wrestled in two of the same
tournaments: the Cliff Keen Las
Vegas Invitational and the Reno
Tournament of Champions.
Oregon State finished fifth in
Las Vegas and third in Reno.
Stanford, on the other hand, fin
ished 25th in Vegas and 16th in
Reno.

All of these statistics point to
Oregon State being the heavy
favorite on Sunday. However,
Stanford has improved im
mensely since those tourna
ments. In Reno and Las Vegas
the Cardinal was without its
best wrestler, top-ranked 174-
pounder Nick Amuchastegui.
Since his return the Card has
wrestled extremely well and

won four out of five meets.
Lately all of the Stanford
wrestlers have been excellent at
putting together complete
matches and scoring points in
key situations, such as at the end
of the period or on the edge of
the mat. If they keep that going,
then they have a good chance at
upsetting the Beavers.
In its last few duals, Stanford
has not sent out a wrestler at 125
pounds, choosing instead to for
feit that match and give the
other team six points. Against
Oregon State those six points
will be huge: it will be interest
ing to see what head coach
Jason Borrelli decides to do for
that weight class.
At 133 pounds, Stanford will
send out junior No. 8 Ryan
Mango. Mango is 22-5 on the
year and has yet to lose a match
in a dual. He will wrestle the
Beavers' Garrett Drucker.
Drucker has had a successful
season with 18 wins and six loss
es, but Mango already beat him
12-7 in Las Vegas.
The Beavers' 141-pounder is
No. 4 Mike Mangrum, (28-2)
who has qualified twice for the
NCAA Tournament and has
twice finished third at the Pac
-12 Tournament. Stanford will
likely have freshman Alex Man
ley or sophomore Donovan
Halpin go up against him.
Oregon State has three other
ranked wrestlers: sophomore
No. 18 Scott Sakaguchi at 149
pounds, sophomore No. 17 R.J.
Pena at 157 pounds and redshirt
senior No. 5 Clayton Jack at
heavyweight. Jack is a three
time NCAA Tournament-quali
fier and won the Pac-12 Tourna
ment last season. He has lost
just one match all season.
Two days before coming to
Stanford, Oregon State will go to
Boise to take on Boise State. It
will be interesting to see if that
match takes a toll on the Beaver
wrestlers heading into this Sun
day, but regardless of the out
come, Stanford needs to be ready
to wrestle in this crucial dual.
