## Steinem outlines future of feminism, activism myths 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
Students, professors and com
munity members packed into
Cemex Auditorium on Thursday
night to hear Gloria Steinem dis
cuss the future of the feminist
movement and to commemorate
the 40th anniversary of Ms. Maga
zine.

Steinem focused on the in
equalities that still exist between
genders while pulling apart myths
about activism and calling for the
protection of reproductive rights.
Over 35 groups, such as the
American Studies Program, the
Clayman Institute for Gender Re
search and the Program in Gender
Studies, sponsored the talk.
Steinem spoke to a crowd that
sold out Cemex Auditorium in
only three minutes after tickets
went on sale. The crowd consisted
of women of all ages: from middle
school Girl Scout troops to elderly
retirees. The audience also includ
ed many men.
Shelley Fisher Fishkin, director
of the American Studies program
at Stanford, introduced Steinem.

"Ms. Magazine was about en
larging the canvas on which both
men and women can paint their

lives," Fisher Fishkin said.
Although she is probably best
known for her work in the feminist
movement in the 19705, Steinem
stated that she did not want to talk
about the past.
"I want to focus on the future be
cause I live in the future," she said.
Steinem began her speech by
describing various myths about the
feminist movement. One of these
myths was the idea that there are
no young feminists or that the fem
inist movement has become obso
lete because we have entered an
age of equality.
"A reporter once asked me,
'What are you most proud of?'"
Steinem said. "And I said, 'I
haven't done it yet.'"
"The idea that it [the feminist
movement] used to be necessary
but not anymore ... is just another
form of obstructionism," Steinem
said.
Another myth that Steinem ad
dressed was that various social jus
tice movements should remain
separate.
"I think that those of us in social
justice movements need to take re
sponsibility for failing to acknowl
edge links between our groups,"
