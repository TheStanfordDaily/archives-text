## Steinem outlines future of feminism, activism myths 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
Students, professors and com
munity members packed into
Cemex Auditorium on Thursday
night to hear Gloria Steinem dis
cuss the future of the feminist
movement and to commemorate
the 40th anniversary of Ms. Maga
zine.

Steinem focused on the in
equalities that still exist between
genders while pulling apart myths
about activism and calling for the
protection of reproductive rights.
Over 35 groups, such as the
American Studies Program, the
Clayman Institute for Gender Re
search and the Program in Gender
Studies, sponsored the talk.
Steinem spoke to a crowd that
sold out Cemex Auditorium in
only three minutes after tickets
went on sale. The crowd consisted
of women of all ages: from middle
school Girl Scout troops to elderly
retirees. The audience also includ
ed many men.
Shelley Fisher Fishkin, director
of the American Studies program
at Stanford, introduced Steinem.

"Ms. Magazine was about en
larging the canvas on which both
men and women can paint their

lives," Fisher Fishkin said.
Although she is probably best
known for her work in the feminist
movement in the 19705, Steinem
stated that she did not want to talk
about the past.
"I want to focus on the future be
cause I live in the future," she said.
Steinem began her speech by
describing various myths about the
feminist movement. One of these
myths was the idea that there are
no young feminists or that the fem
inist movement has become obso
lete because we have entered an
age of equality.
"A reporter once asked me,
'What are you most proud of?'"
Steinem said. "And I said, 'I
haven't done it yet.'"
"The idea that it [the feminist
movement] used to be necessary
but not anymore ... is just another
form of obstructionism," Steinem
said.
Another myth that Steinem ad
dressed was that various social jus
tice movements should remain
separate.
"I think that those of us in social
justice movements need to take re
sponsibility for failing to acknowl
edge links between our groups,"

Noted feminist Gloria Steinem spoke about gender equality Thursday
evening in Cemex Auditorium. Tickets to her talk, commemorating the
launch of Ms. Magazine, sold out within three minutes of availability.
she said.
The interconnectedness of var
ious social justice movements, ac
cording to Steinem, does not water
down their various messages, but
rather makes them stronger.
"Categories can be the ene
mies of connection," she noted.
Movements such as the femi
nist movement, the environmen
tal movement, the gay rights
movement and the civil rights
movement should acknowledge
their commonalities and use
them to lobby more powerfully,
Steinem said.
"We need to move from de
pendence to independence to in
terdependence."
Steinem expressed her belief
that social movements must
"overcome these crazy cate
gories of race or sexual orienta
tion or class."
She also stressed the impor
tance of reproductive freedom
saying that "all movements are
damaged when reproductive
freedom is taken away."
According to Steinem, "cults
of masculinity and femininity
grew" out of men taking away re
productive rights from women.
She was particularly bothered
by the efforts of certain groups in
the United States who are trying
to curtail women's reproductive
rights.
"Backlash against reproduc
tive freedom which, in essence, is
an attempt to nationalize
women's bodies," Steinem said is
a sign of the troubling times she
observes today.
"We have a right to be wor
ried," she said. "I think we live in
a very scary time in our country
right now."
The situation, however, is not
without hope.
"This is a time of maximum
danger ... and also we have to
understand that we are not going
to stop [organizing] because this
country is about to be free," she
said.

Following the speech was a
question and answer session
with the audience. Steinem en
couraged audience members
with both questions and poten
tial answers to share their
thoughts.
Sally Lieber spoke about or
ganizing efforts for her cam
paign for California State Sen
ate. Lieber stated that she was
inspired to run by the unequal
number of female representa
tives in American government.
Organizers from a hotel
workers labor union told
Steinem that two housekeepers
from the Santa Clara Hyatt were
recently fired for complaining to
upper management about pic
tures of housekeepers wearing
bikinis that were posted on an
employee bulletin board.
When asked by audience
members how to inspire others to
action, Steinem replied, "I think
what works in all movements is
true stories. Each person telling
what happened to them and shar
ing it with others who thought it
had only happened to them."
"It is the stories that get us out
onto the street and get us into
physical action," she added. "Fear
is contagious, courage is conta
gious, humor is contagious."
Audience members seemed
won over by Steinem's sincerity
and humor.
Kathryn Green, a resident of
Los Altos Hills, said that she was
amazed at Steinem's ability to be
"knowledgeable on a huge variety
of topics and be able to still affect
people's lives."
Marianne Cooper, a research
associate at the Clayman Institute,
said Steinem was "amazing, inspir
ing and insightful."
"[Steinem] is reinvigorating a
lot of people's sense of how to
change things," Cooper added.
Steinem offered the audience
her philosophy on how to change
the state of the world: "The answer
is still blowing in the wind, but we
must not just hold our fingers to
the wind; we must become the
wind."
