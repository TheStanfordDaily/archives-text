## CONFUSING SONG TITLES 
### 
Being a songwriter is a tough business. The mainstream audience is surprisingly fick
le, albeit not particularly discerning. Assuming you manage to navigate the pitfalls of
pop songwriting and churn out something at least 60-percent original(ish), there's still
one more hurdle to clear. Your next big hit needs a big title, one audiences can
instantly identify with. As masterpieces "I'm Too Sexy" by Right Said Fred, "Hero" by
Enrique Iglesias and "Hero" by Mariah Carey demonstrate, the best name is a word
or phrase from the chorus around which the song revolves. It's a simple concept,
which is why it's so amazing that these five songs screwed it up so badly.
"Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana
Fun fact: Teen Spirit is a brand of deodorant. Kurt Cobain's friend made fun of him for
smelling like it one day. In response, he named a song after it. He claimed that he was
unaware of the connection and just thought it sounded badass, but he was probably just
trying to be counterculture. So here we are now, entertained by this amusing anecdote,
and we forget that the song has absolutely nothing to do with teen spirit, badassery or
otherwise. Dropping the ball, Kurt.
"Absolutely" by Nine Days
This is the story of a band who became famous across the land for a song about a girl.
Except actually, the tale of the girl who cried a river and drowned the whole world was
named after an unimportant adverb that modifies an equally unimportant verb. Full disclo
sure: the official title of the song is "Absolutely (Story of a Girl)," but that just makes it
worse; why bother making the other title if you're going to openly acknowledge that it's
dumb immediately afterward?
"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" by Green Day
Another parenthesized title that prompts serious questions about the mysteries of the
song title universe, this song has the added bonus of having its "true" title be a badge of
honor for people who fancy themselves as cosmopolitan. "I really like that song 'Time of
Your Life'!" you might say. Your ex-friend might reply, "Oh, you mean 'Good Riddance'?"
Just like that, a fork stuck in the road, and you've lost yourself a friend.
"No Such Thing" by John Mayer
No parentheses here, but it's still a head-scratcher. Intuitively, the title would be "The Real
World." That phrase is mentioned much more noticeably than "no such thing," which is
glossed over in favor of a more prominent phrase ("the real world," in fact). So the good
boys and girls take the so-called wrong title, Google it and find John Mayer has named it
"No Such Thing." Condescendingly.
"Since U Been Gone" by Kelly Clarkson
Just... I mean ... why is it a letter? Letters aren't words!
