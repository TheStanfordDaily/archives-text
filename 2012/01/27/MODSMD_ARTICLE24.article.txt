With over 34 million views on You Tube with
in a year of its upload, "The Crazy
Nastyass Honey Badger" has done
everything from spark water-cooler conversation to
inspire the nickname of a Heisman Trophy candidate.
The video couples National Geographic footage of a
honey badger with hilarious narration by a man who
simply goes by "Randall." Its success has led to a pub
lishing deal for Randall, who stopped by the Stanford
bookstore yesterday to sign his debut book "Honey
Badger Don't Care: Randall's Guide to Crazy, Nastyass
Animals." Viewers are left curious, however who
exactly is Randall? Our requests for official photos of

the man behind the
video were met with
simply more high
quality photos of
honey badgers.
Intermission sat
down for a Q&A
with this incognito
character to answer
this pressing ques
tion. It must be
mentioned, howev
er, that Randall is
(very likely) the fic
tional brainchild of

another man: comedian Christopher Gordon (or at
least, so we suspect). However, the interview was all
Randall.
Intermission: Who is Randall?
Randall: I [Randall] was born on a tiny island known
as Manhattan. I went to St. Olaf College for a while,
where I studied theater. I grew up with a love and a
deep affinity for animals. My papa was the cameraman
for Mutual of Omaha's "Wild Kingdom," so since a
very early age I was exposed to and always loved ani
mals. The playwriting thing wasn't really working out,
and I had to do something, so I just fell back on my
natural talent for narration. I mean, ever since I was
little I've been narrating things.
Where did your inspiration for the honey
badger video come from?
In the '9os, I met my assistant, and we worked off
Broadway together. Years later, he showed me that
video, and I just thought it was amazing. So, it was just
one of those things that was like, this is a no-brainer!
I'd say about 85 percent of that was just natural reac
tion to what was going on. It just caught on! It sud
denly became my mission to educate people through
humor about animals. The take-home message is that
we're not alone on this planet, and there's got to be a
better way to get this message out.
