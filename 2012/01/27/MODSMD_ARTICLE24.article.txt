With over 34 million views on You Tube with
in a year of its upload, "The Crazy
Nastyass Honey Badger" has done
everything from spark water-cooler conversation to
inspire the nickname of a Heisman Trophy candidate.
The video couples National Geographic footage of a
honey badger with hilarious narration by a man who
simply goes by "Randall." Its success has led to a pub
lishing deal for Randall, who stopped by the Stanford
bookstore yesterday to sign his debut book "Honey
Badger Don't Care: Randall's Guide to Crazy, Nastyass
Animals." Viewers are left curious, however who
exactly is Randall? Our requests for official photos of

the man behind the
video were met with
simply more high
quality photos of
honey badgers.
Intermission sat
down for a Q&A
with this incognito
character to answer
this pressing ques
tion. It must be
mentioned, howev
er, that Randall is
(very likely) the fic
tional brainchild of

another man: comedian Christopher Gordon (or at
least, so we suspect). However, the interview was all
Randall.
Intermission: Who is Randall?
Randall: I [Randall] was born on a tiny island known
as Manhattan. I went to St. Olaf College for a while,
where I studied theater. I grew up with a love and a
deep affinity for animals. My papa was the cameraman
for Mutual of Omaha's "Wild Kingdom," so since a
very early age I was exposed to and always loved ani
mals. The playwriting thing wasn't really working out,
and I had to do something, so I just fell back on my
natural talent for narration. I mean, ever since I was
little I've been narrating things.
Where did your inspiration for the honey
badger video come from?
In the '9os, I met my assistant, and we worked off
Broadway together. Years later, he showed me that
video, and I just thought it was amazing. So, it was just
one of those things that was like, this is a no-brainer!
I'd say about 85 percent of that was just natural reac
tion to what was going on. It just caught on! It sud
denly became my mission to educate people through
humor about animals. The take-home message is that
we're not alone on this planet, and there's got to be a
better way to get this message out.

How did this book come about?
For years, I noticed that a lot of wildlife,
nature and animal picture books weren't
telling their readers the real story about these
animals. I said, 'You know what? It's about
time someone writes a book about wildlife
nature and just tells it like it is.' It was just sort
of natural. The video took off, and I saw this
as a great opportunity to expose other crazy,
nastyass animals to the public. I think people
questioned whether or not the transition
would be a smooth one, you know, how do
you take someone's voice and then put it into
a book? I said, 'Don't worry about that, stupid,
please. Let me just write this thing!' So,
Andrews McMeel believed in what I was here
to do, and the rest is just history!
Is it a children's book?
I have a very salty mouth. Writing this book, I
tried so hard to censor myself, and I was hav
ing a really hard time doing it, and I realized
I've just got to tell it like it is. My goal was
kind of to make a "tell-all" about these crazy,
nastyass animals. It's like a gossipy animal
book. Initially, I think the adult is my reader,
but, looking ahead I am planning on doing
something for the kids at some point, in the
"Randall" form.
Any thoughts on Tyrann Mathieu, the
LSU cornerback and Heisman candidate
nicknamed "The Honey Badger"?
When I found out that [Mathieu] had adopt
ed that nickname, to me, it made sense. Once

I saw him play, there wasn't a lot I could do in
terms of being upset or angry, I just totally
agreed with that nickname. He's amazing! I
think I reached a whole new level of viewers
with the collegiate folk, so for me, I think it was
great exposure for both Mathieu and myself.
What is your spirit animal? What animal
embodies "Randall"?
I'd probably have to say... a lion. I really relate
to and adore and worship big cats and cats in
general. Lions, to me, are fantastic, and I think
they represent me best just because they sleep
like up to 14 hours a day, and I think that's fab
ulous! And everyone listens to them! I'll take it, I
love lions!
Is there a reason the honey badger just
does not give a shit?
The reason why the honey badger doesn't give a
shit, is because ... it doesn't have to. They're
about the size of a little Jack Russell, and they
have to deal with so much in their environment
that there's really no reason for them to give a
shit. I think even a lion would feel guilty about
eating a zebra, but honey badger will feel no
remorse about demolishing a little fox's family.
Also, as a honey badger, you're just kind of
raised with that mentality. First off, your father
leaves. Boom, off the bat, you're a baby honey
badger raised by a single mommy, and your
mommy doesn't really give a shit about you
either. She's just kind of dragging your ass
along, you know? She'll throw you down in a
burrow while she goes hunting, and before you

know it, you're a teenager, and now you're really
alone! Why should you care?
Given your theater career, have you con
sidered creating a Honey Badger musi
cal?
I don't know who in their right mind would
invest, but it depends on who you cast. Out of
the gate, I would pick Charlie Sheen, but I don't
think he can sing a lick. I think the best choice,
which was actually suggested to me at a book
signing in Santa Monica, would be Hugh
Jackman. Oh, my God, he'd be perfect! He sings,
he dances and he's Wolverine!
