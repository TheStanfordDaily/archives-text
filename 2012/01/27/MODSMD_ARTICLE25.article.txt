## Q&A: WILCO 
### â€“ ben LABOY contact ben: blaboy@stanford. edu 
This week, Intermission sat down with Glenn Kotche, the drum
mer for the alternative rock band Wilco. Promoting their recently
released album "The Whole Love", Wilco is bringing their tour
to the Bay Area with four sold-out performances in San Jose, San
Francisco, Oakland and Davis over the next week. Trained in classical per
cussion, Kotche has played with Wilco for more than 10 years and has also
released several solo works. He talked to us about the new album, touring
in the Bay Area and future performances at Stanford.
Intermission: The album is structured with the seven-minute "Art
of Almost" at the beginning and the 12-minute acoustic ballad
"One Sunday Morning (Song for Jane
Smiley's Boyfriend)" at the end, with 10
average-length songs in the middle. Did
you go in with the intention of doing
that?
Kotche: Usually with any record we'll mess
with the sequences, listen to them and see
what seems to flow the best. With this last
record, it was pretty obvious when we finished
"Art of Almost" that [it] was an opening track.
Where else would we put it? And the same
thing with "One Sunday Morning" ... it has
such a great feel to it of closing everything up,
it's almost too long and too quiet to go first,
and I think anywhere else in the record it
would just kill the flow. Those two were the
obvious bookends, so then it came to filling
everything else.
Would you say that this album is more
experimental than the last two Wilco has
put out?
Well, we always experiment in the studio;
that's just the way we work because most of
the time [recording is] done in our studio,
and so we have the luxury of time. I would say
[with] this record more than the last few, we
really did make a point to try any idea that
anyone had. Since we were setting up our own
label, we had a lot of time, and we were going
to be off the road, we weren't just fitting it in
between tours ... I think ["The Whole Love"]
had more freedom in the studio than neces
sarily an intent for it to sound experimental.
Wilco is known for putting on amazing
live performances. Does touring ever
get exhausting or grueling, or can you
find every night a renewed sense of
energy?
We've all been touring for a long, long time, in
various bands and in this band, and this band
tours pretty much as much as any band out
there. And we play places a lot of bands our
size never go near; multiple cities in Montana
and Arkansas, you know, places like that that a
lot of bands just skip over. So we are playing a
lot, we're playing a lot of countries, which can
get grueling. Four of the six guys have fami
lies, five of us are married, so it's always tough
to leave your kids. But at the same time, I

think we all believe in what we're doing
enough to where, when it gets to the show
and onstage, we definitely give it our all. And I
think that's where, as you said that reputation
of being a good live band, I think it's because

we don't hold it in. Every night we're emo
tionally invested in the performance, even if
it's in the middle of nowhere, and I think that
translates to the audience as part of the show.
Do you change the types of songs
depending on the venue?
Of course, we're now supporting a new
record, so a lot of those songs are going to be
on there regardless. But no, it's dependent on
the venue as well, like last night we played a
place that was mostly standing; it was very
big, and you could tell it was going to be loud,
it was going to be more of a rock type of
show, and so we left some of the more inti
mate, quiet acoustic numbers off the set list..
. Definitely the venue, we've just done this
enough to learn that you can't fight the venue.
Is the Bay Area special to Wilco in any
way?
Yeah, actually, it is. It's always been. Early on it
was one of the places where we were most
popular. There was always Chicago because
we're based there, and then the San Francisco
Bay Area. Starting out at the Fillmore, the
American Music Hall, places like those, we've
always had a really great showing and could
sell out shows there a lot faster than other
places. So yeah, it's always been a special area
for us ... in '9B after we were married, my
wife got transferred and we lived in Palo Alto
for a little spell there right up the street from
Stanford, so that was cool. I love that area.
Favorite song off the new album?
For me it's "Art of Almost." I like that one
because that was one when we were recording

in the studio and I was doing a drum pass,
and at the end I was just messing around after
the song was over and played that beat that
happens throughout the song. When the guys
heard it, they said "Wait, hold on!" and Jeff
[Tweedy] tried to see if he could sing over it.
He could, so I re-tracked, and played that over
the whole song, and then John [Stirratt]
changed his bass, and Mike [Jorgensen]
changed the synth part and then came up
with the whole ending. So that's one that was
extremely collaborative in the way it sounds
on the record... That one's really fun for all
of us to play live, and it's a big workout, and
it's challenging, so I'd say that's my favorite to
play from the new record.
Glenn, thanks so much for your time, do
you have anything else to add?
In early 2013 I'll be out at Stanford for a week
doing a residency premiering a new piece by
the Alaskan composer John Luther Adams.
He's my favorite composer, and he wrote a 50-
minute solo percussion piece that I'm going to
be playing, and I'm also going to be doing the
"Monkey Chant," one of my solo pieces... I'll
be there giving some workshops, hanging out
with students and then doing the concert.
