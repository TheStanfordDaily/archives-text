The Stanford Theatre Activist
Mobilization Project (STAMP)'s
rendition of "The Merchant of
Venice" was, above all else, infinitely earnest.
The setting was an intimate one: a small,
dimly lit stage, one whose lighting cast shad
ows on the faces of its players and whose
sound work felt a bit amateurish at times
(though to be fair, the show I saw was their
first full run-through in the space.)

The finest aspect of the show was portrayal
of the famously villainous Jewish moneylender,
Shylock. Played by Natasha Mmonatau 'l5,
Shylock is written as cold, vengeful, greedy and
merciless. Mmonatau s rendition, on the other
hand, showed us a woman who had long been
oppressed and who had finally reached her

breaking point; she
was relatable and infi
nitely human—and
maybe I'm just a good
capitalist, but I found
myself entirely agree
ing with much of
what she had to say
about economics and
justice. This was the
greatest strength of
the show: it took what
may be the most con
troversial of
Shakespeare's works

and used it as away to open up dialogue on the
effects of faith and intolerance, making a tragic
hero of its traditional villain.
Other characters to keep an eye out for:
Portia (Safiya Nygaard 'l4), whose ad-libbed
reactions and body language was more believ
able than anyone else's on-set, and Bassanio
(graduate student Vin Misra), who was less

loudly charismatic but
whose earnestness
could win over the
most cynical of viewers.
As always, the
otherwise charming
show featured a few
major weaknesses.
Shakespeare's works
have been performed in
a thousand different
time periods and set
tings, to various degrees
of effectiveness, and in
this case, the modern-

ization of the piece felt like nothing more than a
gimmick. I got their intention; it was meant to
make the characters more rati to the audience
or to somehow hold a mirror up to society, but
they went about it by adding a few cheesy
sounding ringtones and car homs and little else.
Even so, these low points were counteract
ed by some absolutely fabulous high points. A

few scenes to look out for: a delightfully girly
chat between the lovely Portia and her maid
Nerissa (Lauren Janas 'l2), who were absolutely
brilliant at bringing relatability to their two
characters; the delightful bromance of Bassanio
and Gratiano (Jimmy Lee 'l4), whose interac
tions were frequently hilarious; and above all
else, the final confrontation scene between
Portia, Nerissa, Bassanio and Gratiano.
All in all, though, STAMP's "Merchant of
Venice" is an extremely accessible version of
Shakespeare's work and definitely worthwhile
for those who want to watch the Bard without
growing bored.
"Merchant of Venice" runs from Jan. 26-28 in the
Nitery Theater at 7p. m.
