One might have predicted
that Ingrid Michaelson's
new album would come
out as Valentine's Day edges closer.
After all, a narrow view of
Michaelson shows that she has
essentially cornered the market on
"how-delightfully-romantic!"
songs, particularly thinking about
her most successful single, "The
Way I Am."
This is not to say that there

isn't a place in the music industry
for kitschiness, and to be fair,
Michaelson has successfully walked
the fine line between serious and
sickeningly sweet for several albums
now. However, "Human Again",
her fifth studio album, represents
the misguided decision to tip the
balance entirely towards the former.
The result is unexceptional.
Michaelson misses the mark in
several spots by making the same

crucial mistake that so many artists
these days make forgetting what
they're good at. "The Way I Am,"
for instance, shines because of its
pared-down melody, memorable
lyrics and passably good vocals. In
"Human Again," a few songs meet
these criteria. For instance, "I'm
Through" showcases the heights
that Michaelson's new style can
reach, with a four-chord piano pro
gression and heart-wrenching sin
cerity.
But for the most part,
Michaelson's three best qualities are
markedly absent throughout
"Human Again." Most of the album
is lyrically, as well as musically,
repetitive "Fire," for example,
utilizes about three notes through
the whole song as well as incredibly
cliche "emotional" lyrics ( "I'm

walking in a Gre with you"). Hey
Ingrid, Adele and John Mayer
called they want their romantic
(and superior) fire metaphors back
(see "Set Fire to Rain" and "Slow
Dancing in a Burning Room").
Similarly, "Ghost" goes the
entirely expected route of "haunt
ing," excessive discordant violins
and a somewhat jarring chorus.
Gone is the happiness of
Michaelson's former work, replaced
with a sound that is probably sup
posed to be "darker" but comes
across as somewhat miserable.
Think Selena Gomez aiming for
(and missing) Adele-level heights of
emotional melodrama.

An artist's evolution can often
be a necessary change and the
defining moment of his or her
career. For hit producers, a new

sound is away to appeal to an even
larger audience while still retaining
the fans that lust after their original
tones. Michaelson, however, is not a
traditional chart-climber, and per
haps for this reason becomes the
exception rather than the rule. Her
new record would have benefitted
most from more of her old style
rather than less. Instead,
"Human Again" seems to be an
attempt at pandering to a new
audience combined with her gen
uine evolution as a more mature
artist. If this is humanity encapsu
lated in an album, other species
might just be more advanced than
we are.
