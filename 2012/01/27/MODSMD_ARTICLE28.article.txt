## Browncoats take the stage

"Y A That is it about TV shows that
\/\ / inspire such mad devotion? Sure,
V V fandoms arise to support stellar
movies, but they never seem to match the
intensity that some TV shows manage to
draw in. Something about the continuous,
serial nature of a TV show just lends itself
well to causing obsession in away that isn't
really seen that much elsewhere (although
book series can certainly cause a similarly
widespread fixation).
You can't really talk about devoted
groups of fans without talking about the
Browncoats, the dedicated group of followers
who fell in love with Joss Whedon's "Firefly"
as soon as it aired. The space western (I
swear, it's better than it might sound) may
have gotten cancelled with only 14 episodes
produced, but that did not by any means
temper the fans' enthusiasm. It's hard to talk
about what makes "Firefly" so special without
repeating what hundreds of fans and critics
have said before, but the show has a unique
aesthetic and a well-written case of flawed,
but relatable characters that gave the crew of
the ship Serenity a real sense of family.

It took a few years after the series' can
cellation, but the Browncoats' devotion has
led to more than a few fan sequels, a tabletop
RPG, a series of comics and a canonical

sequel in the form of the movie "Serenity."
Now the Stanford Savoyards, a student-run
theater company that exclusively performs
Gilbert and Sullivan shows, has decided to
bring the 'verse to life in a unique way —by
setting "The Pirates of Penzance" in the
"Firefly" universe.

Most of the "Firefly" flavor is in the cos
tumes and the set dressing, which I unfortu
nately didn't get to see, but it's still easy to see
how well the two universes mesh together.
The crew of "Serenity" was morally ambigu
ous; they were pirates for sure, but they
worked against the oppressive Alliance and
took care to make amends when they hurt
innocent bystanders. Likewise, the pirates
don't attack ships weaker than they are, and
they spare anyone who says they're an
orphan. And while the character analogues
fall apart somewhat in the specifics (Zoe
would never fall for Simon), it's easy to see
how the Pirate King and Captain Mai are, at

their core, similar
characters.
In a weird
way, pairing "The
Pirates of
Penzance" with
"Firefly" recap
tures a lot of what
I thought "Serenity"
missed out on.

"Firefly" was a very personal show about the
unlikely family that came about in the space
ship "Serenity"; it was about fighting unlikely
odds and barely scraping by in time for the
next fight. "Serenity" was all about being Big
Damn Heroes and taking a stand against the
evil empire; not necessarily a bad plot, and
outside of a few key moments, most of that
sense of family, what I really loved about the
show, was lost. The story of "Pirates" is far
closer to the warm, comfortable feeling of
"Firefly" than the epic scope of "Serenity",
even if it does veer off in a much sillier direc
tion at times.
It's really nice to see the crew of

"Serenity" back in action, even if it's in such
an indirect way. I rarely need an excuse to
revisit the 'verse, but it's nice eveiy once in a
while to have a reminder. Its brevity tends to
anger any fan (don't even think about men
tioning Fox around most Browncoats), but at
least in its brevity it never suffers the fate of
TV shows that last long beyond their expira
tion date; there's rarely a moment of "Firefly"
that isn't worth watching.
