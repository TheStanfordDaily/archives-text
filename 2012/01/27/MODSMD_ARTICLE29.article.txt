## Stuff We Love: 'THE VAMPIRE DIARIES' 
### â€“ halle EDWARDS contact halle: halle@stanford. edu 
As a self-proclaimed "Twilight" hater, I
saw previews for "The Vampire
Diaries" back in 2009 and rolled my
eyes at the CW Network's attempt to cash in
on the nation's vampire hysteria. I only started
watching the series because I thought it would
provide the same unintentional laughs
"Twilight" did. At first, the plot even seemed
lazily similar to that of "Twilight": mopey
human girl Elena meets broody vampire
Stefan and falls in love, while mysterious "ani
mal attacks" plague their gloomy small town
of Mystic Falls.
I couldn't have been more wrong. As I
got into the series, I realized I wasn't watching
some soapy CW drama. I'd found one of the
best shows on TV.
First of all, the TV series is based on a
book series of the same name, which was
published in 1991 more than a decade
before "Twilight." So it turns out all the plot
material that felt like rehashing of "Twilight,"
"Diaries" had done first. The fact that
"Diaries" can claim some fun mythology of
its own (a vampire who lives olf animal
blood, vampires that can walk around during

daytime, secret families of witches) makes it
that much more intriguing. "Diaries" is every
thing that my "Twilighf'-hating self had
hoped that series was going to be before I read
it: suspenseful, bloody and romantic.
However, the best thing about the series
has to be Damon Salvatore, the resident "evil"
vamp. Played enthusiastically by "Lost" alum
nus lan Somerhalder, Damon is a shamelessly
evil vampire who has no qualms about killing
innocents or using people for his dirty work.
The fact that his life centers around making
his fellow vampire brother Stefan's life miser
able adds tons of tension to the series and
makes for wonderfully witty and danger
ous interactions between the two.
The series also embraces non-conven
tional relationships between the various cast
members, which makes for some fun, steamy
television. Although the show's central
romance between Stefan and Elena is believ
able and much easier to stomach than Bella
and Edward's, the real fun comes between all
the other links between characters, like evil
Damon's soft spot for Elena, older guardian
Jenna's string of creepy exes and best of all,

sweet younger brother Jeremy's relationship
with vampire Anna. Things get even better
when werewolves, witches and even ghosts are
added to the romantic mix.
"Diaries" also benefits from a consistent
ly fast pace. Whereas many other TV series
suffer from plot points that drag on endlessly
and get dull, "Diaries" introduces fresh mate
rial in every episode and wraps it up by the
following one resulting in several jaw
dropping moments and cliffhangers. Since the
plot moves so fast, the supernatural world of
Mystic Falls gets more and more layered,
becoming more engaging to watch with each
passing episode.
Finally, although "Diaries" indulges in
lots of angsty moments, it earns them by cre
ating characters with real depth. The show
explores some of the harder parts of vampire
life. You see vampires struggle with the urge
for human blood, which begs connections to
more human addictions like food, alcohol

and drags that viewers can relate to. You also
see them question their humanity (they are
dead after all) or dissolve their relationships to
protect others. You see Elena straggling with

her parents' death and her brother Jeremy
coping with it in an entirely different, and
more destructive, way. Even though "Diaries"
focuses on the supernatural, its human ele
ment is what really sets it apart.
If you have yet to experience the magic
that is "The Vampire Diaries," be sure to check
it out. Previous seasons are available on
Netflix, and new episodes air Thursdays on
theCW.
