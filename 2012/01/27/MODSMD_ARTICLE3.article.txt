## IHUM may be replaced, IntroSems required 
### KURT CHIRBAS MARGARET RAWSON 
The Faculty Senate heard the culmination of
two years of work by the Study on Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES) Thursday, a report
of more than 100 pages that examines the methods
and goals of a Stanford education. The study con
cluded with 55 recommendations to improve un
dergraduate education, such as the replacement of
the Introduction to Humanities (IHUM) program
and a new, non-disciplinary system of breadth re
quirements.
Co-chairs James Campbell, the Edgar E. Robin
son Professor in U.S. history, and Susan McConnell,
the Susan B. Ford Professor in biology, led the 17-
member committee and presented the study's find
ings to the Senate.
Ways of Thinking, Ways of Doing

primarily on seven skills deemed essential for stu

quiry; scientific analysis; formal and quantitative
reasoning; engaging difference; moral and ethical

reasoning; and creative expression. Under the rec
ommended plan, titled, "Ways of Thinking, Ways of
Doing," either one or two courses will be required
for each skill.

"In conceiving breadth in a non-disciplinary
way, we are not suggesting that disciplinary knowl
edge is unimportant," the report reads. "We see
knowledge and capacities as inextricable and re
ciprocal."
The report discusses a need for both integrative
and adaptive learning, with the former exemplified
by the fact that general education requirements,
freshman-year Thinking Matters courses and
major requirements will be permitted to overlap.
The report noted that under the current system,
students seem to view general education require
ments as "tick boxes" and do not consider the
meaning behind the selected requirements.
"It is characteristic of faculty, on hearing all this,
to condemn students for their cynicism, but the
fault is more ours than theirs," the report reads. "If
they choose general education courses with little
thoughtfulness of purpose, it is because we have
failed to communicate to them why we believe
