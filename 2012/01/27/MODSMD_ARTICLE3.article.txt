# Faculty Senate hears, debates SUES report
## IHUM may be replaced, IntroSems required 
### KURT CHIRBAS MARGARET RAWSON 
The Faculty Senate heard the culmination of
two years of work by the Study on Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES) Thursday, a report
of more than 100 pages that examines the methods
and goals of a Stanford education. The study con
cluded with 55 recommendations to improve un
dergraduate education, such as the replacement of
the Introduction to Humanities (IHUM) program
and a new, non-disciplinary system of breadth re
quirements.
Co-chairs James Campbell, the Edgar E. Robin
son Professor in U.S. history, and Susan McConnell,
the Susan B. Ford Professor in biology, led the 17-
member committee and presented the study's find
ings to the Senate.
Ways of Thinking, Ways of Doing
SUES undertook an examination of the breadth
requirements of a current undergraduate educa
tion. The report recommends a new system based
primarily on seven skills deemed essential for stu
dents: esthetic and interpretive inquiry; social in
quiry; scientific analysis; formal and quantitative
reasoning; engaging difference; moral and ethical

reasoning; and creative expression. Under the rec
ommended plan, titled, "Ways of Thinking, Ways of
Doing," either one or two courses will be required
for each skill.

"In conceiving breadth in a non-disciplinary
way, we are not suggesting that disciplinary knowl
edge is unimportant," the report reads. "We see
knowledge and capacities as inextricable and re
ciprocal."
The report discusses a need for both integrative
and adaptive learning, with the former exemplified
by the fact that general education requirements,
freshman-year Thinking Matters courses and
major requirements will be permitted to overlap.
The report noted that under the current system,
students seem to view general education require
ments as "tick boxes" and do not consider the
meaning behind the selected requirements.
"It is characteristic of faculty, on hearing all this,
to condemn students for their cynicism, but the
fault is more ours than theirs," the report reads. "If
they choose general education courses with little
thoughtfulness of purpose, it is because we have
failed to communicate to them why we believe
these courses are important, what
we hope they will gain from them
and how they relate to the broad
er aims of a Stanford education."
Included in the report appen
dix is a comparison of Stanford's
breadth requirements with those
of Yale, Princeton and Harvard.
IHUM: Replaced, or rebranded?
The report recommends re
placing the Introduction to Hu
manities program, a yearlong re
quirement for freshmen since
1996, with a one-quarter "Think
ing Matters" course.
"Few topics elicited as much
discussion with the SUES com
mittee, and fewer still provoked
such ambivalent feelings," the
study said of its examination of
the controversial IHUM series,
which is currently mandatory for
all freshmen not enrolled in the
alternative program, Structured
Liberal Education (SLE).
The report initially compli
ments the IHUM program and
notes the resources that have
gone into its development, but
quickly changes tune due to stu
dent dissatisfaction.
"IHUM's sustained attention
to student learning and effective
pedagogy makes it a model not
only for future freshman pro
grams, but also for other units in
the University," the report reads.
"All these distinctions only make
the response of students more dis
appointing."
"We found a troubling pattern
of student alienation from
IHUM, manifested in (relatively)
low course evaluations, poor at
tendance at lectures and a wide
spread failure to engage deeply
with course materials."

The report comments on low
student approval of IHUM and
described a phenomenon known
as "IHUM kid" students
mocked by others for deep inter
est in the course material.

"Paradoxically, the very pro
gram we intend to fire students'
imaginations and awaken them to
the possibilities of university
level learning has become the
paradigmatic 'tick box' require
ment," the report reads.
As a result, the committee rec
ommends replacing IHUM with a
one-quarter Thinking Matters
course, which would be devel
oped and overseen by a gover
nance board made up of faculty
across the University. A pilot pro
gram of these courses would
begin during the upcoming 2012
to 2013 academic year.
"Our idea is that by taking a
Thinking Matters course, students
can have some of the experiences
that are exemplified by fall quar
ter IHUM," McConnell said. "But
that you can choose whether to do
that in the humanities, the sci
ences, the social sciences. You can
choose the idea that you want to
explore."

The report lists possible Think
ing Matters courses such as "Evil"
taught by philosophy professor
Chris Bobonich; "The Nature of
Law" with Dean of Stanford Law
School Larry Kramer; and a
course entitled "Social Animals,
Social Revolutions, Social Revo
lutions," which would be co
taught by French professor Dan
Edelstein, biology professor Deb
orah Gordon and professor of
computer science Eric Roberts.
Faculty members have not yet
committed to these courses, ac
cording to the report.

The new courses would be
smaller in size than most IFIUM
classes and would not be restrict
ed to humanities-related topics.
While mandatory for freshman,
Thinking Matters would be open
to all four classes.

"All students are required to
take one, but they have the incen
tive to take more if they want be
cause it will count towards breadth
requirements," said Aysha Bagchi
'll, one of the two student mem
bers of the committee.

Bagchi, a recent recipient of
the Rhodes scholarship and a for
mer Daily columnist, said her own
IHUM experience was mostly
positive, but could understand
some of the resentment directed
at the program by students.
"It does take up a big part of
your freshman year, and it does
make it hard to explore," she said.
Bagchi said that a minor rec
ommendation of the committee is
to alter the grading system that
was previously used IHUM. The
report referenced, "the severity
and seeming arbitrariness of the
grading system," and the fact that
"many students referred to the
program as 'B-HUM.'"
Some have questioned
whether the new program will dif
fer substantially from IHUM.
Many of the proposed courses are
current fall-quarter IHUM class
es, such as "The Poet Remaking
the World," "Can the People
Rule?" and "Epic Journeys." Ac
cording to ASSU Senator Dan
DeLong 'l3, some students that
he has talked to are worried that
the new program is simply an
"IHUM name-change."

English professor and SUES
committee member Jennifer
Summit, who has previously
taught in the IHUM program,
said that Thinking Matters will
focus less on specific content and
more on the learning process. She
added that instead of simply
being an introduction to humani
ties, the curriculum would be "an
introduction to college-level

analysis."
Introductory Seminars
One of the most contentious
recommendations of the report is
to require each freshman to take
at least one introductory seminar,
to provide a variety of learning
environments to students in the
first year of study.
"On one hand, we want every
freshman to get to know a faculty
member, in all of our quirkiness
and our passion for what we do,"
McConnell said. "We think the
advantages of being in a seminar
are really worth the requirement.
That's a subset of the committee,
and a small majority. There is an
other set of people both in the
committee and in the University
who worry. They agree with the
goals, but they worry that by re
quiring the seminar that the semi
nars will lose some of their attrac
tiveness to students. And the last
thing we want to do is to damage
a great program."
McConnell compared the pro
posed requirement to the Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR) which, while a require
ment, receives mostly positive
feedback from students, Mc-
Connell said, due to a wide variety
of course options.
"We had a huge debate in the
committee about this issue,"
Bagchi said. "I think most people
were initially divided, so we had a
really open debate."
Bagchi noted that most com
mittee members are very positive
about IntroSems but fear the ef
fect of making them a require
ment.

A student representative of
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Standards and Policies (C
-USP), Stephen Trusheim 'l3,
voiced his concerns on Thursday
in an email sent to the undergrad
uate ASSU Senate list.

"I worry that, no matter what,
a requirement will lead to people
getting stuck in classes that they
don't want to take, which will ruin
the class for everyone else,"
Trusheim wrote, arguing that the
best aspect of IntroSems is found
in the enthusiasm of students to
be present and learn about a topic
of interest in a close setting.
Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education Flarry Elam ad
dressed an issue of supply and de
mand concerning Introductory
Seminars but said that he believes
that shifting to a requirement
would be possible, both because
faculty members enjoy teaching
the seminars and being able to
choose their students through ap
plications. Elam said there are
currently 120 IntroSems offered
per year.
Residential learning
McConnell noted in the Facul
ty Senate meeting that there is a
perceived "disconnect between
the academic and residential
lives" of Stanford students. The
report heralded SLE as "a model
of integrated residential learn
ing," a program through which
freshmen students attend classes
and discussions in their East Flo
rence Moore dormitory.
"The kind of moniker of
'IHUM kid' for somebody that
tries to bring up something that
he's learned in IHUM when
we went to SLE, we didn't find
that," Campbell said. "We found
that students are living together.
They're learning together.

They're arguing about stuff over
dinner."

While the report does not rec
ommend mandating SLE stat
ing that the program "flourishes
precisely because it is a small, al
ternative program that students
choose to join" it does call for
the creation of similar programs
where students can choose to
learn in their residential environ-

ments. The report advises organ
izing these new residential pro
grams around a variety of themes,
so they would attract a diverse
body of students.

According to the report, one
possibility is to organize these
programs around the five themes
of the Stanford Challenge Initia
tive: human health, the environ
ment, international studies, edu
cation and the arts. The report
adds, however, that it is important
that these themes grow "organi
cally" out of student and faculty
interest.

The report also notes the diffi
culty of recruiting faculty mem

bers to serve as Residential Fel
lows (RFs), tasked with living in
undergraduate dormitories and
engaging with student residents.
According to the report, only 14
of the 62 RFs on campus are
members of the Academic Coun
cil. While the report did not con
clude that this was significant
problem, it did recommend find
ing new ways to encourage facul-

ty members to take on the post.
The committee recommended
that the University also explore
how faculty members could en
gage in residential life in other,
less time-intensive ways. One
suggestion was for professors to
give talks, participate in discus
sions and teach seminars in un
dergraduate residences.
Focusing on residential living
after freshman year, the report
expressed some concerns about
the trend of seniors choosing to
live in Row houses, a collection of
student-run houses, noting that
these students "largely pass out
of the orbit of the Office of Resi

dential Education."
In his email to the public
ASSU Senate list-serve,
Trusheim took offense to the re
port's conclusion that "for many
seniors, the appeal of the Row
clearly has less to do with self
government than with the oppor
tunity to host parties with less
stringent supervision than in non-
Row houses."
"This is particularly insulting
because I think it expresses a de
sire to do away with self-ops/co
ops in favor of a much more cen
tralized program under tight con
trol of ResEd," Trusheim wrote.
Bagchi, who lived in the self
op Xanadu last year, said the re
port was not recommending any
significant changes to the Row
program, but recognizing a possi
ble cultural issue to address.
"The recommendations don't
involve suddenly inserting faculty
members in Row houses that's
not going to happen," she said.
Instead, one solution that the
committee proposed was giving
seniors more housing options
such as a "residential research
college," which would provide
mentoring for students complet
ing a honors theses or capstone
project. Summit said this idea was
inspired by the September Hon
ors College.
What's next?
"The SUES report is a radical
document, less because it propos
es to redesign undergraduate ed
ucation than because it tries to
get at the root of teaching and
learning," wrote James J. Shee
han, chair of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education
(CUE) from 1993 to 1994, in the
document's preface. "The report
is also a conservative document
because it is tightly connected to
Stanford's distinctive character
and traditions."
The Committee on Under
graduate Standards and Policies
(C-USP) will make recommen
dations in response to the report
at a Feb. 23 Faculty Senate meet
ing. The Senate will then vote on
the final recommendations at its
next meeting on March 8.
