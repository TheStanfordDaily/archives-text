In her new release, "The
Baker's Daughter", Sarah
McCoy weaves together the
stories of two very different
women who, in attempting to out
run their pasts, end up in El Paso,
Texas. Reba Adams is a lonely jour
nalist whose latest assignment, a
Christmas feature, leads her to
Elsie's German bakery. In research
ing her piece, she finds a kindred
spirit in the proprietress, Elsie
Schmidt, whose story began six
decades previous in Germany as a
teenaged girl under the oppressive
rule of the Third Reich.
McCoy weaves together her
two timelines in a manner reminis
cent of the recent bestseller "Hotel
on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet"

by Jamie Ford. Adding the narra
tive of the 16-year-old Elsie, as
opposed to rendering her story as a
series of oral recollections or flash
backs by her now elderly self in
Texas, McCoy cleverly invites com
parison between the two characters
as young women. The reader expe
riences the horrors of the Nazi

Germany as Elsie, the relatively
sheltered daughter of a baker,
comes of age and discovers a side
of the regime she has suspected,
but never known, to exist. Reba's
childhood is also profoundly
shaped by the effects of war her
father is a Vietnam veteran suffer
ing from depression and post-trau
matic stress disorder. The very dif
ferent ghosts in their pasts draw

the two women together and cause
them to reveal to each other the
deepest parts of themselves, those
that they thought they had laid to
rest.

"The Baker's Daughter" is
ultimately a story about courage in
its myriad forms: the courage of
one's convictions, the strength nec
essary to survive amid pain and
difficult choices and the capacity
for forgiveness. McCoy's novel,
while squarely in the women's fic
tion corner of historical fiction, is
darker than the average feel-good,
book club fare as World War II
stories generally are and the

extensive research evident
throughout the story bolsters its
grim realism, especially in Elsie's
timeline; the author unflinchingly
tackles such difficult topics as Nazi
eugenics and the Holocaust. She
switches gears seamlessly, for the
most part, portraying Reba's much
quieter personal demons with
great emotional literacy.
The book falls short predomi
nately in terms of technique, which
is disappointing, as "The Baker's
Daughter" is not McCoy's first
published novel. She is a compe
tent but not especially scintillating
prose stylist; her third-person nar
ration is smooth, but her first-per
son perspective, seen in "The
Baker's Daughter" in the form of
letters between Elsie and her sister,

Hazel, is stilted. The book's pacing,
too, leaves something to be desired
(also stalling primarily during the
epistolary scenes), though pacing a
dual-timeline story is admittedly
much more difficult than conven
tional novels.
"The Baker's Daughter" is
worth reading for enthusiasts of
women's or historical fiction. A
more diverse readership, however,
is likely to find it less satisfying
than other books of its kind.
