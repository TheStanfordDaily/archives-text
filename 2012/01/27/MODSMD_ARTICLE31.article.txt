A couple
weeks
ago, I laid

" out a handful of predictions

for the year ahead. We're far
enough into January that this second batch is
inexcusably late, but hey... I also predict
that you'll need a few homework extensions
before this quarter is over. Don't judge.

"Bio Ware" gets more money and less
love

Despite a long history as one of the
industry's most consistently impressive stu
dios, Bio Ware is on notice for a lot of fans
this year. Some of that criticism is fair; some
of it isn't. The developer's owner, Electronic
Arts, seems to be aware that Bio Ware's name
moves units like craz/and is slapping it on as
many studios as possible it isn't long

before "Bio Ware Tiburon" brings us Madden
DLC. That puts Bio Ware's core fans, already
somewhat alienated by the less-than-stellar
Dragon Age 2 and a perplexing Command &
Conquer reveal, in the unusual position of
not really knowing what the studio's name
means (hence the somewhat cryptic quota
tion marks in the subhead above). That will
continue in 2012. Star Wars: The Old

Republic will become a cash cow despite
underwhelming many MMO fans (it's Star
Wars, and that's enough), Dragon Age 3

won't please any
k body as Bio Ware
attempts to
' please each of
' the disparate but
sizeable fan bases

from the franchise's
first two entries and Mass

Effect fans will continue to complain about

the finale's inclusion of multi-

player. The dilution of the
Bio Ware name is subjec-
V tive in some ways and
W deserved in others, but
either way, a lot of people are

going to take it off their list of
favorite developers this year.

3DS Quickies
Three dimensions. Three predictions.
The 3DS will continue its phoenix-like
ascent out of mediocrity. Did you know it's
outpacing first-year Wii and DS sales, at 4
million units since last March? (Yes, that's
mostly because of last summer's outrageous
ly massive price cut.) Expect a rollout of big
announcements in June and as long as
I'm going out on limbs, I'll say the 3DS sells
a cool 8 million units worldwide.
The 3DS's inevitable hardware redesign
will come before long, but not in 2012. The
most compelling feature of said update
would be a built-in right circle pad, but
given Nintendo's lack of enthusiasm for its
ugly, Gamestop-exclusive add-on, it doesn't
seem like they're very keen on making dual
analog control a übiquitous standard on 3DS
anytime soon.
Nintendo will announce a new Metroid
game on 3DS. My money's on a return to
the series' 2D roots ... and when I say "2D,"
of course, I'm talking about the plane of
Samus' movement, not the way the graphics
are rendered. Parallax for the win! At the risk
of taking wild guesses, I'll go ahead and say
that whatever Metroid project Nintendo
unveils this year will be handled by Texas
based Retro Studios. Team Ninja's controver-

sial take on the franchise
wasn't a complete deba
cle, but Nintendo
knows that another
left-of-center take on

Metroid could irreparably sully the fran
chise's good name. In the meantime, Retro
has shown it can take Nintendo's most treas
ured franchises Metroid, Donkey and
Mario Kart and add Western sensibilities
without tarnishing what makes them so spe
cial.

A Vita(l) Year for Sony
Ah, the Play Station Vita. It's sexy as hell,
but not unlike the 3DS, I get the feeling that
the Vita will run into the biggest problem
that Sony Computer Entertainment has
wrestled with since it was founded in 1993: it
has solid franchises everywhere, but no true
blockbusters. Sony can ship off a few million
copies of Uncharted, God of War or Gran
Turismo with no problem, but it rarely
breaks through with Halos or Marios.
Sure, the Vita will launch with eye-pop
pers and critic-pleasers like Gravity Rush,
Little Deviants and Uncharted: Golden
Abyss. But the 3DS has Mario Kart 7, a game

you'll still see on sales charts in
2013. And in Japan, the only
market where the Vita is cur
rently available, Nintendo just

happened to secure a 3DS-exclusive Monster
Hunter title that released just before Sony's
new handheld did, undoubtedly contribut
ing to the Vita's poor first-week sales, which
clocked in at about 500,000.
Of course, that's ignoring the elephant
in the room. Whether Sony admits it or not,
the Vita will have to provide compelling rea
son for Joe iPhone to carry an extra screen in
his pocket. Considering that last year's total
3DS sales failed to match the number of iOS
devices activated on Dec. 25 alone, it's clearly
an uphill battle for both companies. The
3DS is turning around, like most Nintendo
systems, with the just-in-time arrival of
excellent first-party software. In America, at
least, Vita won't have that advantage. If I had
to take a stand on it, I'd say that Sony will be
seriously rethinking its handheld strategy 12
months from now.

in the room. Whether Sony admits it or not,
the Vita will have to provide compelling rea
son for Joe iPhone to carry an extra screen in
his pocket. Considering that last year's total
3DS sales failed to match the number of iOS
devices activated on Dec. 25 alone, it's clearly
an uphill battle for both companies. The
3DS is turning around, like most Nintendo
systems, with the just-in-time arrival of
excellent first-party software. In America, at
least, Vita won't have that advantage. If I had
to take a stand on it, I'd say that Sony will be
seriously rethinking its handheld strategy 12
months from now.



A couple
weeks
ago, I laid

" out a handful of predictions

for the year ahead. We're far
enough into January that this second batch is
inexcusably late, but hey... I also predict
that you'll need a few homework extensions
before this quarter is over. Don't judge.

"Bio Ware" gets more money and less
love

Despite a long history as one of the
industry's most consistently impressive stu
dios, Bio Ware is on notice for a lot of fans
this year. Some of that criticism is fair; some
of it isn't. The developer's owner, Electronic
Arts, seems to be aware that Bio Ware's name
moves units like craz/and is slapping it on as
many studios as possible it isn't long

before "Bio Ware Tiburon" brings us Madden
DLC. That puts Bio Ware's core fans, already
somewhat alienated by the less-than-stellar
Dragon Age 2 and a perplexing Command &
Conquer reveal, in the unusual position of
not really knowing what the studio's name
means (hence the somewhat cryptic quota
tion marks in the subhead above). That will
continue in 2012. Star Wars: The Old

Republic will become a cash cow despite
underwhelming many MMO fans (it's Star
Wars, and that's enough), Dragon Age 3

won't please any
k body as Bio Ware
attempts to
' please each of
' the disparate but
sizeable fan bases

from the franchise's
first two entries and Mass

Effect fans will continue to complain about

the finale's inclusion of multi-

player. The dilution of the
Bio Ware name is subjec-
V tive in some ways and
W deserved in others, but
either way, a lot of people are

going to take it off their list of
favorite developers this year.

3DS Quickies
Three dimensions. Three predictions.
The 3DS will continue its phoenix-like
ascent out of mediocrity. Did you know it's
outpacing first-year Wii and DS sales, at 4
million units since last March? (Yes, that's
mostly because of last summer's outrageous
ly massive price cut.) Expect a rollout of big
announcements in June and as long as
I'm going out on limbs, I'll say the 3DS sells
a cool 8 million units worldwide.
The 3DS's inevitable hardware redesign
will come before long, but not in 2012. The
most compelling feature of said update
would be a built-in right circle pad, but
given Nintendo's lack of enthusiasm for its
ugly, Gamestop-exclusive add-on, it doesn't
seem like they're very keen on making dual
analog control a übiquitous standard on 3DS
anytime soon.
Nintendo will announce a new Metroid
game on 3DS. My money's on a return to
the series' 2D roots ... and when I say "2D,"
of course, I'm talking about the plane of
Samus' movement, not the way the graphics
are rendered. Parallax for the win! At the risk
of taking wild guesses, I'll go ahead and say
that whatever Metroid project Nintendo
unveils this year will be handled by Texas
based Retro Studios. Team Ninja's controver-

sial take on the franchise
wasn't a complete deba
cle, but Nintendo
knows that another
left-of-center take on

Metroid could irreparably sully the fran
chise's good name. In the meantime, Retro
has shown it can take Nintendo's most treas
ured franchises Metroid, Donkey and
Mario Kart and add Western sensibilities
without tarnishing what makes them so spe
cial.

A Vita(l) Year for Sony
Ah, the Play Station Vita. It's sexy as hell,
but not unlike the 3DS, I get the feeling that
the Vita will run into the biggest problem
that Sony Computer Entertainment has
wrestled with since it was founded in 1993: it
has solid franchises everywhere, but no true
blockbusters. Sony can ship off a few million
copies of Uncharted, God of War or Gran
Turismo with no problem, but it rarely
breaks through with Halos or Marios.
Sure, the Vita will launch with eye-pop
pers and critic-pleasers like Gravity Rush,
Little Deviants and Uncharted: Golden
Abyss. But the 3DS has Mario Kart 7, a game

you'll still see on sales charts in
2013. And in Japan, the only
market where the Vita is cur
rently available, Nintendo just

happened to secure a 3DS-exclusive Monster
Hunter title that released just before Sony's
new handheld did, undoubtedly contribut
ing to the Vita's poor first-week sales, which
clocked in at about 500,000.
Of course, that's ignoring the elephant
in the room. Whether Sony admits it or not,
the Vita will have to provide compelling rea
son for Joe iPhone to carry an extra screen in
