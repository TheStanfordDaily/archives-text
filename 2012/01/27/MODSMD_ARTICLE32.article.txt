Loosely centered on one cou
ple's messy divorce, Iranian
writer-director Asghar
Farhadi's "A Separation" deftly
weaves together class, religious
and gender issues to create a nar-

ratively simple yet morally com
plex story set in contemporary
Tehran.
After 14 years of marriage,
Simin (Leila Hatami) files for
divorce from husband Nader

(Peyman Moadi) so that she and
her 11-year-old daughter Termeh
(Sarina Farhadi) can leave the
country in search of a better
future. Nader, however, insists
upon staying in order to take care
of his aging father, who suffers
from Alzheimer's and lives with
the family in their upper-middle
class urban high-rise. But when
the judge deems the couple's
problems insufficient to warrant
divorce, an angry Simin decides to
move out.
Following his estranged wife's

advice, Nader hires Razieh (Sareh
Bayat), a young pregnant woman
and poor devout Muslim, to care
for his father during the day.
Despite Razieh's best intentions,
she soon finds herself over
whelmed by the work. Tension
between Nader and Razieh reach
es a boiling point when he returns
home to find her gone and his
father unconscious on the floor
with one arm tied to a bedpost. A
heated argument ensues when
Razieh returns, resulting in Nader
angrily shoving her and Razieh
falling on the stairs in the midst of
a hasty exit.
When Razieh ends up in the
hospital shortly thereafter to be
treated for a miscarriage, Nader

becomes embroiled in even
greater legal troubles. Razieh and
her hot-headed husband accuse
Nader of causing the miscarriage,
an act punishable by several years
in prison, while Nader maintains
his innocence and suggests that
Razieh neglected his father. Simin
attempts to negotiate a settlement,
but by now the he-said-she-said
situation has begun to spiral out
of control.
Like a metaphor for the tacit
social rules that govern the char
acters' lives, the film's set consists
almost exclusively of interiors.
