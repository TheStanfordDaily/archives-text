Pina Bausch was a German modern dance chore
ographer, famous for bringing elements of the
real world onto her stage, incorporating water,
dirt, rocks, city streets and cafes into her choreography.
In "Pina 3D", director Wim Wenders brings Bausch's
choreography seamlessly offstage into the real world
shooting parts of the dances on city streets, in the forest,
on a tram, in an industrial park and on the beach
while still giving us glimpses of the performances on
stage.
In "Pina," Wenders works with Bausch's dancers to
bring segments of her "Cafe Muller," "The Rite of
Spring" and "Vollmond" vividly to the big screen.
Cinematographer Helene Louvart shoots effectively in
3D, which is all oriented behind the screen, creating the
effect of watching dance occurring in a three-dimen
sional space. It's as close to theatre or live dance as you
can get on film. Here, you have the advantage of being
able to get close to the dancers, to clearly see their facial
expressions or the details of a particular move.
Wenders makes modern dance, which can easily be
alienating until you get accustomed to it, accessible to
the dance neophyte. Each of the three pieces are shown
in relatively short segments, no more than 10 minutes
each, and are interspersed both with one another and
between the stage and the outside world. The advantage
is that if a certain number doesn't quite click for you, it is
normally finished before you are too bored.
The disadvantage is that too often, the segments
that you love are too short. For more seasoned dance
appreciators, this can be frustrating throughout:

Wenders may cut away
from a particular angle
or move of interest at an
inopportune time, and
you can't see entire num
bers in sequence. In a

way, this is pop dance for the masses, in the same way
that symphonies perform "pop" classical numbers where
they play the months highlights instead of famous pieces
in their entirety.
Nevertheless, "Pina" still brings a new dimension to
the work of Pina Bausch by bringing it onto the streets
and onto the beach. It gives the dance an added sense of
urgency and spontaneity. It's invigorating to see Pina
Bausch's choreography performed by the ocean, with the
dancers kicking around in the water, and then to see

how Bausch translated that setting and immediacy to
the stage. It is equally exciting to see Bausch's work re
imagined in the real settings that she re-creatled indoors.
One of the best dance numbers, which epitomizes
how Bausch's choreography is dance, theatre and life, all
at once, comes from "Cafe Mueller." It is dance, but there
is a story arc that makes it theatre and a familiarity that
makes it a great reflection of life. And up close, with the
camera right in the space with the actors, whether on
stage or on location, it exists not as just a reflection of life
but as life itself. Suddenly, Bausch's mantra, "Dance,
dance, otherwise we are lost," makes perfect sense.
