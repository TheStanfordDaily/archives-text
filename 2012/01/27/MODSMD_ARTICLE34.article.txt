January may be nearing its end,
and you may have already
given up on your New Year's
resolutions, but that's no excuse to
shirk your pop culture responsibil
ities. In case you've been under a
rock or buried in winter quarter p
sets, here's what you need to know.
And remember you weren't one
of 7 percent selected to just turn
out a philistine, even if you are
pursuing your CS degree. Read on,
you uncultured yahoo!
The Nike+ Fuelband counts.
Nike's latest technological project, a
bracelet that measures everyday fit
ness "fuel" and promotes a
healthy lifestyle, is almost as cool as
its promotional material. In addi
tion to the "#makeitcount" hashtag
for the fitness equipment complete
with its own Apple-engineered

iPhone app, You Tube videos have
caught the eyes of slothy bloggers
and fitness gurus alike. The best of
these videos, "Counts," lists all the
activities that count in terms of
Nike+ fuel data, set to videos clips
of Serena Williams, "Rocky,"
"Edward Scissorhands" and a myr
iad of other popular and obscure
titles and characters. Groove
Armada's "I See You Baby" hypes
the band with appropriate intensity
and playfulness. If not for the fit
ness benefits and the chance of
actually keeping up with your New
Year's goals, get this Fuelband and
resolve to stay stylish.
Re-cut trailers revive old
favorites. Remixes to old videos
are no new phenomenon in a
world of You Tube, but re-cut trail
ers for familiar favorites provide a

unique pleasure when the genre
morphs completely. "The Shining
Trailer" by FinalCut6 encapsulates
the magic of re-cut trailers, with a
genial voiceover fit for a '9os family
flick and the mellifluousness of
Peter Gabriel's "Solsbury Hill."
Heck, if we didn't know that

Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" is
one of the most celebrated horror
films ever, we might have taken our
kid nephew to the Sunday matinee
of this happy "Shining." But let's be
honest, knowing just how psycho
Jack Torrance goes and the burn
ing image of Jack Nicholson pop
ping through a door makes this re
cut trailer that much more satisfy
ing.
"The Dark Knight Rises" is up
for grabs. Yes, Disney recently re
released "Lion King 3D," and, yes,
Christopher Nolan's "The Dark
Knight Rises" will complete the
revamped trilogy this summer, but
this trailer is about neither and
both of those movies at the same
time. Brad Hanson synced the
audio of the "DKR" trailer with
visuals from "Lion King" and from
that embryo came sweet, mashed
up film nectar. While our fancy for
literary criticism compels us to
draw extensive comparisons
between "Batman", "Hamlet" and
"The Lion King", we'll leave it at

the wonders of parody. Other than
the hilarious pairing of indulgent
melodrama and animated inno
cence, "The Lion King Rises"
proves that much like its record
breaking predecessor, "TDR" is fair
game for lionizing and lampoon
ing alike. Also see "Tangerine: Fall
On Your Sword."
We're still listening to "Sh*t
Girls Say." You might still have a
flip phone if you still aren't aware
of the "Sh*t s Say" meme hap
pening (see our cover story last
week on Stanford's own incarna
tion), in which case, put the
scrunchie down and get yourself to
the 2010s. If you are aware of this
phenomenon, click over a few
You Tube channels and start surfing
the update: it's all about the sh*t
people say to specific groups. "Sh*t
White Girls Say... to Black Girls"
offers first-person political com
mentary on friendships between
white and black girls, but with the
same humor and candor as the
most frivolous of You Tube vids. As

with any "Sh*t" video, the deepest
of laughs come from the humbling
realization that you have actually
said many of the satirized com
ments, which in this case may offer
some racial insight. Warning: upon
viewing, you may consider yourself
a white girl. Consult sequel.
Lana Del Rey Bombed on SNL.
But we still love her. In our first
edition of this year, we called that
Del Rey would be big on oh-12.
Unfortunately, so far it's for wailing
worse than Kanye West after that
whole "808s & Heartbreak" singing
stint. She may have sounded like a
drunk girl passing out in the back
of a cab, but with her first album
"Born to Die" set to release on Jan.
30, we're waiting until the lady
sings on the album before we
count her out. Hey, Kanye's still
popular. Right?
