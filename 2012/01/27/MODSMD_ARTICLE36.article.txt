In 1762, playboy Earl John Montagu was on
another one of his marathon gambling ben
ders. Displaying humility and a work ethic typ
ical of the British gentry, Montagu ordered his per
sonal chef to make his meals in away that would
n't interrupt his game of Blackjack. With the inge
nuity befitting a class long obligated to fulfill frivo
lous requests from degenerate blue bloods for

barely any pay, the earl's personal chef gave him
meat in between two pieces of toasted bread. The
idea went viral, and the Brits soon named the pop
ular creation in honor of Mr. Montagu, the fourth
Earl of Sandwich (obviously deserved... had it
not been for the earl's admirable gambling habit,
the foodstuff would have never materialized). Such
was the genesis of the modern sandwich.
Today, the sandwich is much more than the
meal of choice for gambling addicted earls and
their personal staffs. It's become the official food of
elementary school students and the elderly alike
according to Google, the average American cur
rently eats a staggering 193 sandwiches a year. To
borrow "30 Rock's" Liz Lemon's official worldview,
"All of humankind has one thing in common. The
sandwich. I believe that all anyone really wants in
this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich."
But the sandwich has also experienced a culi
nary renaissance in the past decade or so. It's bro
ken beyond the Wonder Bread, baloney and Little
Mermaid lunchbox paradigms. Today, the sand
wich is having its very own "cupcake moment"

joining the Food Network-driven trend of gussying
up otherwise unremarkable American staples with
creative flavor combinations, artisan ingredients
and a barrage of relevant reality TV programming.
Nowhere is this more obvious than the
Stanford campus, where sandwich places and
sandwich fans abound. Going off-campus to get a
Saturday "morning" (read: 1 p.m.) sandwich is a
social ritual arguably as sacrosanct as pre-gaming.
The Sunday afternoon line at Cheese House is
often a bigger scene than the line to get into Theta
Delt the night before.
For those of you uninitiated into the world of
campus sandwich-ing, here's a brief guide:
The Village Cheese House
Often considered the gold standard of the
Stanford sandwich scene, The Village Cheese
House has been serving happy customers in Palo
Alto since 1959. Like many Palo Alto natives, I'll
never forget the Cheese House's old funky wood
paneled space, which always smelled vaguely like
pickled herring and sold strange, inedible Danish
snacks. The newly renovated Cheese House bears
none of its old eccentricities, but the sandwiches
are as good as they've always been stuffed with
fresh produce, incredible roast beef and the myste
rious but wonderful "original spread." A typical
sandwich costs $7.99; the store is open 10 a.m.-6
p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m.-5 p.m.
