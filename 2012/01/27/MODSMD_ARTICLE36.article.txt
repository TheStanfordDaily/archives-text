## The 						best bets for sandwiches 
### â€“ evie DANFORTH contact evie: erdanfor@stanford. edu 
In 1762, playboy Earl John Montagu was on
another one of his marathon gambling ben
ders. Displaying humility and a work ethic typ
ical of the British gentry, Montagu ordered his per
sonal chef to make his meals in away that would
n't interrupt his game of Blackjack. With the inge
nuity befitting a class long obligated to fulfill frivo
lous requests from degenerate blue bloods for

barely any pay, the earl's personal chef gave him
meat in between two pieces of toasted bread. The
idea went viral, and the Brits soon named the pop
ular creation in honor of Mr. Montagu, the fourth
Earl of Sandwich (obviously deserved... had it
not been for the earl's admirable gambling habit,
the foodstuff would have never materialized). Such
was the genesis of the modern sandwich.
Today, the sandwich is much more than the
meal of choice for gambling addicted earls and
their personal staffs. It's become the official food of
elementary school students and the elderly alike
according to Google, the average American cur
rently eats a staggering 193 sandwiches a year. To
borrow "30 Rock's" Liz Lemon's official worldview,
"All of humankind has one thing in common. The
sandwich. I believe that all anyone really wants in
this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich."
But the sandwich has also experienced a culi
nary renaissance in the past decade or so. It's bro
ken beyond the Wonder Bread, baloney and Little
Mermaid lunchbox paradigms. Today, the sand
wich is having its very own "cupcake moment"

joining the Food Network-driven trend of gussying
up otherwise unremarkable American staples with
creative flavor combinations, artisan ingredients
and a barrage of relevant reality TV programming.
Nowhere is this more obvious than the
Stanford campus, where sandwich places and
sandwich fans abound. Going off-campus to get a
Saturday "morning" (read: 1 p.m.) sandwich is a
social ritual arguably as sacrosanct as pre-gaming.
The Sunday afternoon line at Cheese House is
often a bigger scene than the line to get into Theta
Delt the night before.
For those of you uninitiated into the world of
campus sandwich-ing, here's a brief guide:
The Village Cheese House
Often considered the gold standard of the
Stanford sandwich scene, The Village Cheese
House has been serving happy customers in Palo
Alto since 1959. Like many Palo Alto natives, I'll
never forget the Cheese House's old funky wood
paneled space, which always smelled vaguely like
pickled herring and sold strange, inedible Danish
snacks. The newly renovated Cheese House bears
none of its old eccentricities, but the sandwiches
are as good as they've always been stuffed with
fresh produce, incredible roast beef and the myste
rious but wonderful "original spread." A typical
sandwich costs $7.99; the store is open 10 a.m.-6
p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m.-5 p.m.


on Sundays.
Ike's Place
A splashy newcomer to the
Stanford sandwich scene (it opened
on campus in fall of 2010), Ike's
place has been a huge success.
Located on the ground floor of the
Huang Engineering Center, the
Stanford Ike's is a peninsula outpost
of a franchise made famous by
wildly popular locations in San
Francisco. The original San
Francisco Ike's was in fact so popu
lar that the neighborhood com
plained, forcing its removal.
Stanford's Ike's suffers a similar fate;
lines can be long and pre-ordering
services unreliable. But if you can
stomach the wait, Ike's delivers. The
sandwiches are the most nouveau
and innovative of anything around
campus; this isn't the plain turkey

sandwich of your elementary school
days. Rather, the menu at Ike's is
notable for its great sauces, random
ingredients (like mozzarella sticks)
and panoply of meat-free options.
I'll always be a fan of the Menage a
Trois all the standard sandwich
fixings plus shredded chicken with
barbeque sauce, honey (really) and
three kinds of cheese on a Dutch
Crunch roll. A full Menage a Trois
will set you back $9.99, a half, $5.95;
Ike's is open 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday
through Friday and 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
on weekends.
JJ & F Food Store
JJ & F sandwiches have a cult
following on campus. It might not
have instant name recognition, but
frequent customers have a fierce
loyalty to the place. "If the state of
California allowed for marriage

between a man and a sandwich,"
said weekly JJ & F patron Tristan
Kruth 'l2, "I would marry a JJ & F
sandwich."
Disciples say these sandwiches
(although less daring in composi
tion than alternatives) have an edge
over all the rest for fresfiness of
ingredients. Plus, JJ & F is located
just off El Camino Real, only a few
doors down from the so-called
"Sorority Starbucks" (convenient if

you've just spent the night in the
Cowell Cluster!). A sandwich runs
$6.99; JJ & F is open 8 a.m. 9 p.m.
Monday through Friday, 8 a.m.-8
p.m. on Saturday and 9 a.m.-8 p.m.
on Sunday.
Draeger's Supermarket
Draeger's is a proverbial dark
horse on the sandwich scene; it's a lit
tle bit farther away from campus (a
10-minute drive into lovely Menlo
Park), and I've personally never seen

another Stanford student there.
Rather, on Sunday mornings,
Draeger's is a sea of moms in
Lululemons buying paper towels
marked up to twice what Safeway
would charge. But the small deli
counter in the front produces really,
really wonderful sandwiches in
the mold of JJ & F, but with more
diversified meat options and the phe
nomenal "Draeger's Spread" (chipo
tle and mayonnaise). Added bonus:
Draeger's also makes awesome
chocolate chip cookies the perfect
post-sandwich indulgence. A stan
dard sandwich is $6.99; Draeger's is
open daily 7 a.m.-10 p.m.

the foodstuff would have never materialized). Such
was the genesis of the modern sandwich.
Today, the sandwich is much more than the
meal of choice for gambling addicted earls and
their personal staffs. It's become the official food of
elementary school students and the elderly alike
according to Google, the average American cur
rently eats a staggering 193 sandwiches a year. To
borrow "30 Rock's" Liz Lemon's official worldview,
"All of humankind has one thing in common. The
sandwich. I believe that all anyone really wants in
this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich."
But the sandwich has also experienced a culi
nary renaissance in the past decade or so. It's bro
ken beyond the Wonder Bread, baloney and Little
Mermaid lunchbox paradigms. Today, the sand
wich is having its very own "cupcake moment"

joining the Food Network-driven trend of gussying
up otherwise unremarkable American staples with
creative flavor combinations, artisan ingredients
and a barrage of relevant reality TV programming.
Nowhere is this more obvious than the
Stanford campus, where sandwich places and
sandwich fans abound. Going off-campus to get a
Saturday "morning" (read: 1 p.m.) sandwich is a
social ritual arguably as sacrosanct as pre-gaming.
The Sunday afternoon line at Cheese House is
often a bigger scene than the line to get into Theta
Delt the night before.
For those of you uninitiated into the world of
campus sandwich-ing, here's a brief guide:
The Village Cheese House
Often considered the gold standard of the
Stanford sandwich scene, The Village Cheese
House has been serving happy customers in Palo
Alto since 1959. Like many Palo Alto natives, I'll
never forget the Cheese House's old funky wood
paneled space, which always smelled vaguely like
pickled herring and sold strange, inedible Danish
snacks. The newly renovated Cheese House bears
none of its old eccentricities, but the sandwiches
are as good as they've always been stuffed with
fresh produce, incredible roast beef and the myste
rious but wonderful "original spread." A typical
sandwich costs $7.99; the store is open 10 a.m.-6
p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m.-5 p.m.


on Sundays.
Ike's Place
A splashy newcomer to the
Stanford sandwich scene (it opened
on campus in fall of 2010), Ike's
place has been a huge success.
Located on the ground floor of the
Huang Engineering Center, the
Stanford Ike's is a peninsula outpost
of a franchise made famous by
wildly popular locations in San
Francisco. The original San
Francisco Ike's was in fact so popu
lar that the neighborhood com
plained, forcing its removal.
Stanford's Ike's suffers a similar fate;
lines can be long and pre-ordering
services unreliable. But if you can
stomach the wait, Ike's delivers. The
sandwiches are the most nouveau
and innovative of anything around
campus; this isn't the plain turkey

sandwich of your elementary school
days. Rather, the menu at Ike's is
notable for its great sauces, random
ingredients (like mozzarella sticks)
and panoply of meat-free options.
I'll always be a fan of the Menage a
Trois all the standard sandwich
fixings plus shredded chicken with
barbeque sauce, honey (really) and
three kinds of cheese on a Dutch
Crunch roll. A full Menage a Trois
will set you back $9.99, a half, $5.95;
Ike's is open 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday
through Friday and 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
on weekends.
JJ & F Food Store
JJ & F sandwiches have a cult
following on campus. It might not
have instant name recognition, but
frequent customers have a fierce
loyalty to the place. "If the state of
California allowed for marriage

between a man and a sandwich,"
said weekly JJ & F patron Tristan
Kruth 'l2, "I would marry a JJ & F
sandwich."
Disciples say these sandwiches
(although less daring in composi
tion than alternatives) have an edge
over all the rest for fresfiness of
ingredients. Plus, JJ & F is located
just off El Camino Real, only a few
doors down from the so-called
"Sorority Starbucks" (convenient if

you've just spent the night in the
Cowell Cluster!). A sandwich runs
$6.99; JJ & F is open 8 a.m. 9 p.m.
Monday through Friday, 8 a.m.-8
p.m. on Saturday and 9 a.m.-8 p.m.
on Sunday.
Draeger's Supermarket
Draeger's is a proverbial dark
horse on the sandwich scene; it's a lit
tle bit farther away from campus (a
10-minute drive into lovely Menlo
Park), and I've personally never seen

another Stanford student there.
Rather, on Sunday mornings,
Draeger's is a sea of moms in
Lululemons buying paper towels
marked up to twice what Safeway
would charge. But the small deli
counter in the front produces really,
really wonderful sandwiches in
the mold of JJ & F, but with more
diversified meat options and the phe
nomenal "Draeger's Spread" (chipo
tle and mayonnaise). Added bonus:
Draeger's also makes awesome
chocolate chip cookies the perfect
post-sandwich indulgence. A stan
dard sandwich is $6.99; Draeger's is
open daily 7 a.m.-10 p.m.

In 1762, playboy Earl John Montagu was on
another one of his marathon gambling ben
ders. Displaying humility and a work ethic typ
ical of the British gentry, Montagu ordered his per
sonal chef to make his meals in away that would
n't interrupt his game of Blackjack. With the inge
nuity befitting a class long obligated to fulfill frivo
lous requests from degenerate blue bloods for

barely any pay, the earl's personal chef gave him
meat in between two pieces of toasted bread. The
idea went viral, and the Brits soon named the pop
ular creation in honor of Mr. Montagu, the fourth
Earl of Sandwich (obviously deserved... had it
not been for the earl's admirable gambling habit,
the foodstuff would have never materialized). Such
was the genesis of the modern sandwich.
