## Kiefer's magic TOUCH'

CCT ouch" is a show about
how we're all connected. It
really, really wants you to
know that.
The latest brainchild of Tim Kring,
the creator of "Heroes,""Touch" treads
on territory that's familiar to fans of
that show and others like "Lost" and
"Fringe." "Heroes" took on more than it
can handle. A simple-enough plot took
a convoluted turn and sank into a tan
gled, canceled mess. Somewhere, a les
son was learned: the pilot of "Touch"
gives us a plot that's pretty easy to fol
low. Sure, its hinting about some meta
physical connection between human
beings and a league of people who can
connect all the dots is a bit mind-dizzy
ing, but all told, the show revolves
around a familiar dynamic: a down-on
his-luck dad, Martin Bohm (Kiefer
Sutherland), struggles to relate to his
11-year-old son Jake (David Mazouz).
The problem with Jake is that he hasn't
spoken a word in his life and refuses to
be touched. He buries himself in a note
book, writing down numbers in endless
concentric circles.

Sutherland is the show's saving
grace. He's believable as both a widower
whose wife died on 9/11 and a father
who's both exasperated and defensive of
his incomprehensible son. He brings a
realism that helps distinguish "Touch"

from like-minded network shows
whose characters' inner struggles seem
manufactured for emotional effect. For
instance: when a social worker (Gugu
Mbatha-Raw) comes into the picture
and points out that he's been working a
string of low-paying jobs, I was tempted
to scoff at his stylish apartment. But to
the show's credit, Sutherland fires back
that his wife was a stockbroker whose
family had a lot of money.
The same can't be said of the show
as a whole. If Sutherland wasn't there to
anchor it, it would be tempting to write
off "Touch" as another entry in a breed
of modern network television dramas
in which the lighting is attractively nat
ural, the people all good-looking and
the action coated in some aspirational
message about how "we're all connect
ed." Kudos to "Touch" for dipping into
international waters, and in its defense,
it doesn't have the liberty to give us grit
ty portraits in the same way Alejandro
Gonzalez Inarritu's 2006 film "Babel"
does. So far, the characters it's intro
duced us to, besides Martin and Jake,
are another American man who collects
lottery tickets, an aspiring singer in
Ireland, a prostitute in Japan, a young
Englishman and a teenage boy in
Baghdad. The last one is the most com-

pelling and ambitious. As a
show about connections,
"Touch" manages to draw coin
cidental relationships between
all of them. Somewhat annoy
ingly, it keeps reminding us of
that fact. It doesn't help that

some of these connections are
far-fetched, like a phone that
passes hands and in the process
manages to catapult a video of
the Irish woman singing to
You Tube stardom.
After bouncing around
variations of "we're all connect
ed" too many times to count,
the pilot builds to a conclusion
that can only be described as
inevitable. Like many an ensem
ble piece, the strangers ultimate
ly connect in what are supposed
to be startling and inspiring
ways. If you've managed to not
be slightiy off-put by its heavy
handed use of "coincidences,"
you may not have the same
stomach for its emotionally
pandering climax. Its message
about universal connectivity is a
nice thought just not when
you're being hit over the head
with it.
Overall, "Touch" is a decent
attempt at what it aimed to
accomplish. It's a little air
brushed and too overtly "heart
tugging." If it tones down the
sentimentality and fleshes out
its potentially interesting narra
tives, it may have some longevi
ty. If nothing else, Sutherland's
presence will sustain it for at
least a season or two.
