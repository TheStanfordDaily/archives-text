## Kiefer's magic TOUCH'

CCT ouch" is a show about
how we're all connected. It
really, really wants you to
know that.
The latest brainchild of Tim Kring,
the creator of "Heroes,""Touch" treads
on territory that's familiar to fans of
that show and others like "Lost" and
"Fringe." "Heroes" took on more than it
can handle. A simple-enough plot took
a convoluted turn and sank into a tan
gled, canceled mess. Somewhere, a les
son was learned: the pilot of "Touch"
gives us a plot that's pretty easy to fol
low. Sure, its hinting about some meta
physical connection between human
beings and a league of people who can
connect all the dots is a bit mind-dizzy
ing, but all told, the show revolves
around a familiar dynamic: a down-on
his-luck dad, Martin Bohm (Kiefer
Sutherland), struggles to relate to his
11-year-old son Jake (David Mazouz).
The problem with Jake is that he hasn't
spoken a word in his life and refuses to
be touched. He buries himself in a note
book, writing down numbers in endless
concentric circles.

Sutherland is the show's saving
grace. He's believable as both a widower
whose wife died on 9/11 and a father
who's both exasperated and defensive of
his incomprehensible son. He brings a
realism that helps distinguish "Touch"

from like-minded network shows
whose characters' inner struggles seem
manufactured for emotional effect. For
instance: when a social worker (Gugu
Mbatha-Raw) comes into the picture
and points out that he's been working a
string of low-paying jobs, I was tempted
to scoff at his stylish apartment. But to
the show's credit, Sutherland fires back
that his wife was a stockbroker whose
family had a lot of money.
The same can't be said of the show
as a whole. If Sutherland wasn't there to
anchor it, it would be tempting to write
off "Touch" as another entry in a breed
of modern network television dramas
in which the lighting is attractively nat
ural, the people all good-looking and
the action coated in some aspirational
message about how "we're all connect
ed." Kudos to "Touch" for dipping into
international waters, and in its defense,
it doesn't have the liberty to give us grit
ty portraits in the same way Alejandro
Gonzalez Inarritu's 2006 film "Babel"
does. So far, the characters it's intro
duced us to, besides Martin and Jake,
are another American man who collects
lottery tickets, an aspiring singer in
Ireland, a prostitute in Japan, a young
Englishman and a teenage boy in
Baghdad. The last one is the most com-
