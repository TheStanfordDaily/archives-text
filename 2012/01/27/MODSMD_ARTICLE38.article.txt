## ROXY SASS ON THE PROWL 
### 
As you may have
realized by now,
Roxy has seen (and
done) many of the boys at
Stanford during her time
here. And after three-plus
years, she's ready for some.
.. ahem, fresh meat.
Though she's considered
grad students, Roxy prefers
men who'd rather do her
than their dissertation.
Instead, she's decided to
emulate the animal king
dom, or at least one of its
most majestic creatures
the cougar.
Why is Roxy choosing
to "do it like they do on the
Discovery Channel"? The
merits of cougar-ing are,
like the men in Roxy's life,
numerous. For one thing,

Roxy, ever the Stanford student, is a
little type-A and tends to boss peo
ple around, in and out of the bed
room. As the older, wiser and more.
.. experienced half of a relationship,
Roxy gets to be the clear "top" dog.
And though Roxy is rarely ashamed
of her hookup history, she some
times prefers keeping boys in the
dark both literally and metaphori
cally. What they don't know can't
hurt them, right? (Unless they don't
know about the whip Roxy keeps in
her closet for special occasions. That
could hurt them.)
But Roxy would never be selfish;
cougaring involves more than your
typical predator-prey relationship.
What's in it for the cougar-ees? For
one thing, unlike that girl down the
hall in Wilbur, Roxy has long since

forgotten her high school prom
date (with the help of many
other nights she can't entirely
remember). Roxy has also
picked up a few tricks over the
years that she's willing to pass
on to the next generation of
Stanford students (Roxy cares
about the youth, of course).
And, just as Roxy has gotten
over wearing leggings as pants
and other phases she went
through before college, she's
also moved past feelings. Roxy,
preparing to leave in a matter of
months, is all about the no
strings-attached hookups
(unless those strings are tying
someone to a bedpost).
To all prospective cougars
and cougar-ees: Roxy wishes
you happy hunting. Rawr.

prom date? Try getting under Roxy.
