# STUDENT LIFE
## Panel reflects on life at Stanford with a disability Students share stories, perspective about undergraduate experience 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford students with physical dis
abilities discussed and answered ques
tions about their lives and the assistive
technologies that help them overcome liv
ing difficulties that result from their con
ditions in a public panel discussion on
Thursday.
The presentation, titled "Perspectives
of Stanford Students with a Disability,"
was part of Engineering 110, a course de
signed to expose students to the difficul
ties that people with physical disabilities
face and inspire innovation in assistive
technologies.
Vivian Wong 'l2 and Aubrie Lee 'l4
described their disabilities and how the
conditions affect their lives to an audience
of around 30 students and com
munity members.
Lee, whose condition prevents
her from moving her face mus
cles, said she began riding in a
wheelchair at age eight when she
could no longer walk.
"When normal muscles are
used, they are supposed to get
stronger," she explained. "But
when my muscles are used, they
get weaker."
When asked how accessible
Stanford was to people in a
wheelchair, Lee said that "over
all, it's very accessible."
"So far, there have not been
any classrooms that I have not
been able to get to that I need to
get to," she said. "There are some
instances once in a while, like
when Igoto an event... that's
being held after hours and the
power in the elevator doesn't
work or it has been blocked; so
you have to go up the stairs to get
into the building."

"The one thing ... is that the
campus is so huge that it takes me
a long time to get from one class
to another," Lee added. "So, I try
to map out my classes so that
they're close to each other."
Wong is mobile and doesn't
require an assistive machine,
however she was born with a con
genital spinal disorder, called
spondylothoracic dysplasia,
which results in a truncated torso,
forward curvature of her spine,
limited neck rotation and re
duced lung capacity. She agreed
with Lee that, generally, the Stan
ford culture is accepting and non
judgmental.
"Fellow students are really
nice," she said. "I would say that
the only trouble I get. . . [is]
around a little kid. I get questions
like, 'Are you a child or are you a
mommy?'... It's interesting how
the parents react actually. Either
they are like 'Whoa, stop,' or they
just say, 'Aw, isn't that funny?"'
Professor Drew Nelson, who
teaches the class titled "Perspec
tives in Assistive Technology,"
also talked about one of his stu
dents, Nicole Torcolini 'l2, who
could not attend the panel be

cause she was sick. Torcolini lost
most of her eyesight just after her
fourth birthday due to cancer in
her optic chasm.The cancer treat
ment also caused her to be slight
ly hard of hearing in both ears.
With the help of a Braille
notetaker, hearing aids, a com
puter screen-reader and a seeing
eye dog named Alexi, Torcolini is
now a successful Stanford senior.
Majoring in computer science
with a concentration on the inter
action between humans and ma
chines, Torcolini wrote software
that back-translates Braille into
readable text, and is now operat
ing a web-based business to make
that software available to others.
Her latest project is designing a
program that allows the blind to
picture the shape of the graph
using sound frequencies.
Lee said that the accessibility
of the Stanford campus which
was an important factor in her
choice of university and the
work that the Office of Accessi
ble Education does plays an im
portant role by ensuring she has
the appropriate accommoda
tions.
She recounted a time when

she was stranded on the second
floor of the art library, having
gone up the elevator just before
they shut the power off, and re
ceived helped when she called
the hotline number that the office
gives to students with a physical
disability.
The students on the panel
agreed that Stanford allowed
them to do extraordinary things
and accommodated their lifestyle
needs so that they could take ad
vantage of the University's op
portunities. In addition to Uni
versity resources, Wong said the
accommodating atmosphere is in
part due to the kindness and tol
erance of its students, faculty and
staff.

"I really appreciate when my
friends take [my condition] into
account," she said. "These friends,
especially the ones I've made
here, have been super helpful.
They've never made it a thing... I
know they notice it, but they
would do anything to accommo
date me. And it wouldn't be out of
the way or an obstacle."
