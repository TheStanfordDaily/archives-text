### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Humanities Center was overflow
ing with eager listeners Wednesday evening as John
M. Cooper, a professor in the department of philos
ophy at Princeton, delivered the first of two talks as
this year's Tanner lecturer. Students sat on the floor
near his lectern as Cooper discussed ancient
philosophies as ways of life, focusing primarily on
the work of Socrates. Thursday evening Cooper de
livered his second talk on the work of Plotinus.
Cooper is the author of "Reason and Human
Good in Aristotle," which was awarded the Ameri
can Philosophical Association's Franklin Matchette
Prize, and of two collections of essays, "Reason and
Emotion: Essays on Ancient Moral Psychology"
and "Ethical Theory and Knowledge, Nature and
the Good: Essays on Ancient Philosophy."
The Tanner Lectures are presented by the Cen
ter for Ethics and Society, in collaboration with the
Office of the President. Stanford is one of nine uni
versities that hosts Tanner Lectures.
Cooper specializes in ancient
Greek philosophy, focusing on
metaphysics, moral psychology
and ethics.
"Philosophy is not only uncov
ering ancient knowledge," Coop
er stated. "But is also understand
ing what the ancients thought was
true."
According to Cooper, the field
of philosophy as away of life gives
it three essential roles: informing
people how to live, or what to do
and what not to do; steering a per
son's whole life, or manifesting in
a person's every choice and action
making up life; and telling people
that philosophical study is a good
thing and should be included in
life.
Throughout his lecture series,
Cooper discussed the ideas of
philosophers and the role and
value they attributed to the act of
philosophy itself.
During the first lecture
Wednesday evening Cooper dis
cussed historical divisions of phi
losophy and noted the inclusion of
ethics in all major frameworks.
"Virtue is wisdom," Cooper
said, rephrasing one of Socrates'
ideas in philosophy. "Virtue
makes one's life fulfilled and
happy, and is necessary for com
plete human fulfillment and hap
piness."
Cooper continued to lecture
about happiness in his second lec
ture, in which he mostly focused
on philosopher Plotinus, dis

cussing Plotinus' theories of the
human person, the human good or
happiness, and the character and
role of human virtues which en
able us to attain our good.

"Philosophy illustrates away
of life, and we should consider liv
ing by and from it," he concluded.
"Our life lies in the activity of pure
thinking, which we all do to some
extent whether we are conscious
of it or not. Our task is to become
as self-conscious of this activity as
possible and focus on it."
Cooper will be hosting a dis
cussion section to follow his sec
ond lecture Friday morning at 10
a.m. in the Landau Economics
Building.
According to the program's
website, The Tanner Lectures are
"a collection of educational and
scientific discussions relating to
human values." The lectures are
organized and funded by the hu
manities department of the Uni
versity of Utah.
