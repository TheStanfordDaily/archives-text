## EDITORIAL SOPA/PIPA and 21st century education 
### 
As the University is in the
process of reforming its
undergraduate educa
tion requirements, mainly the In
troduction to the Humanities
program, we see at least one aca
demic field that is currently
under-addressed at Stanford: the
Internet. As college students, we
tend to spend hours per week on
the Internet, but many of us have
little formal knowledge of the
technology and its consequences
for America and the broader
world.

The Internet may very well be
the defining innovation for the
21st century. If the goal of liberal
education is to prepare students
for a lifetime of critical thinking, it
is crucial that students gain a
deeper understanding of not only
the technical details, but also the
political, legal and social implica
tions for the technology that is
sweeping the world. For those
who already know a lot about the
technical aspects of the Internet,
providing a broader education on
the subject can be empowering.
Take, for instance, the promises of
online education in remote areas.
On the other side, it is also neces
sary that future political leaders,
and the voters who elect them,
have an adequate working
knowledge of the Internet.
Given the recent floundering
of the Protect IP Act and Stop
Online Piracy Act (PIPA and
SOPA, respectively) on Capitol
Hill, the case for widespread In
ternet education only becomes
stronger. Regardless of whether
one agrees with the general goals
of the legislation, the general con
sensus is that they are vaguely
worded and misguided in their
approach. Politicians have never
been regarded as experts on the
Internet. Some Congressmen
even bragged about how they
were not "nerds" and therefore
could not critique the legislation,
yet many of these legislators were
supporters of the initial bill.
Whereas once it may have been
endearing for George W. Bush to
refer to the technology as "the In
ternets," it is now simply reckless
for politicians to hold so much
power over the future course of a
technology they admit to know
ing little about. The general igno
rance of these legislators leaves
them particularly vulnerable to
the influence of corporate lobby
ists interested in promoting their

industries with little regard for
others. Although it is reasonable
to hope that future politicians will
be more thoroughly informed on
the Internet, why leave this to
chance?
Many believe that politicians
were, at least initially, misled by
lobbyists from Hollywood and
the pharmaceutical industries.
But one should also realize that
the vast majority of citizens, many
of whom possess about the same
knowledge on the Internet as the
aforementioned politicians, were
predominantly informed by
sources on the Internet which,
unsurprisingly, have a strong
stake to keep the Internet as un
regulated as possible. The cover
age on SOPA/PIPA was domi
nated by online entities like Red
dit and the cyber-libertarian
Electronic Frontier Foundation.
Cary Sherman, the president of
the Recording Industry Associa
tion of America, argued,"lt's very
difficult to counter the misinfor
mation when the disseminators
also own the platform." Regard
less of whether one thinks Inter
net powerhouses were promul
gating "misinformation," one
should be apprehensive that
thousands of citizens were in
formed predominantly by pro-
Internet interests who have al
most nothing to gain by govern
ment involvement in their pre
ferred medium.
For these reasons, it is not only
crucial that the traditional media
narrow the information gap with
tech journalists, but that citizens
across the board gain enough flu
ency to understand future Inter
net legislation and form their
own opinions on the proper role
of government involvement on
the Internet. For now, we should
probably be glad that the Inter
net leaders opposed the legisla
tion as strongly as they did in
order to stall the momentum of
the legislation. But these debates
will not stop. And future legisla
tion, though it may harm some
Internet corporations, might ac
tually improve the Internet as a
whole. In those instances, the gen
eral populace will benefit greatly
from having politicians who are
well versed in the Internet, expert
journalists who do not have a sig
nificant financial or ideological
stake in the technology, and a cit
izenry that is able to decipher the
arguments made by both sides.
