# Digitizing the diagnosis
## 
### STEPHANIE WANG MOELYVORWERCK 
Generations of children
have walked into the
doctor's office to be
greeted by a white-coat
ed physician with a
stethoscope and a folder in his hand.
But the last detail, if a trend at Stan
ford Hospital and Lucille Packard
Children's Hospital is any indication,
is about to change. Medical centers
across the country, Stanford's among
them, are adopting electronic medical
records (EMRs) in response to some
pragmatic concerns and financial in
centives from the federal govern
ment.
Dr. Scott Sutherland, clinical assis
tant professor of pediatrics at Lucille
Packard, believes that EMRs are a
positive addition to the medical pro
fession.
"It used to be that blood pressures
were charted on paper flow sheets,
and it was easy to look at the past 24
hours' worth of blood pressures," he
said. "Now, the flow sheet goes on for
ever, so I can look at the past seven
days' worth of blood pressures and
[chart] those trends."
With the capability to essentially
"Google search" the information they
need, doctors now have easy access to
more data than ever when assessing
the proper treatment for their' pa
tients.

In addition to UC-Los Angeles
and Harvard University, Stanford is
one of the leading universities to
adopt EMR use in their facilities.
"In the past, patients would have
volumes and volumes of paper
records that were not very well or
ganized," Sutherland said. "Elec
tronic medical records allow you to
keep all the information in one
spot."
Along with Dr. Christopher
Longhurst, Lucille Packard chief
medical information officer, and Dr.
Jennifer Frankovich, Lucille
Packard pediatrics instructor, at
Stanford Hospital, Sutherland re
cently used EMRs to determine the
proper treatment for a girl who had
a rare case of lupus, an autoimmune
disorder. By using these digitized
records, the team of physicians was
able to statistically determine the
best treatment for the girl rather
than rely on anecdotal evidence
from their own experiences and
those of their colleagues.
"These EMR systems will allow us
to do clinical research based on aggre
gated patient data," Frankovich said.
Dr. David Blumenthal, the
Obama Administration's former na
tional coordinator for health informa
tion technology and a physician at
Massachusetts General Hospital, was
one of the vanguards of EMR advo
cacy, and continues to promote the
electronic records within the broader
scope of American healthcare re

form.
"Massachusetts General Hospital
has been implementing an electronic
health record since probably more
than a decade ago," Blumenthal said.
The hospital "has a combination of
systems that were self developed, and
they were deployed in the early 2000s
... when I first started using electronic
health records."
And the benefits of these records,
according to Blumenthal, are many.
"At the simplest level it means
that records are more easily accessi
ble and not lost," he said. "They're
available at the time the patient is
seen and you don't have to request
for them in advance."
And the advantages reach be
yond expedient access, he argued.
"At a more complex and impor
tant level, the records are more com
plete and the data is easier to assem
ble," he said. "It improves the com
pleteness, quality and safety of care,
and I think over time will save in ex
penses."
However, Blumenthal admits
that there are a series of challenges
that come with adopting such
records, even if the pros might even
tually outweigh the cons.
"There is more data entry re
quired because the chart is structured
and therefore every physician doesn't
create his or her own template," he
said. "Information is more complete,
therefore it is more time-consuming
to digest... Physicians and other

caretakers don't have that
problem to that extent when
is the information is written."
Since 2009, the Obama
Administration has encour
aged the use of EMRs in hos
pitals and doctors' offices
across the country. As part of
the American Recovery and Rein
vestment Act, a series of provisions
entitled the High Tech Act set aside
up to $29 billion dollars to prompt
physicians and other professionals to
adopt electronic records in lieu of tra
ditional paper ones.
Hospitals and physicians "could
receive the funding if they used so
called certified electronic health
records in a meaningful way," Blu
menthal said.' 'That gives importance
to the term meaningful use. Physi
cians can get extra money if they be
come users of electronic health
records."
Dr. David Feinberg of the UCLA
Medical Center, like Blumenthal, ar
gues that there are both advantages
and disadvantages to using these
types of records.
According to Feinberg, EMRs
have not been pivotal in diagnosing a
specific case at UCLA, however they
are currently in the process of imple
menting EMRs throughout their four
hospitals and 200-plus clinics in
Southern California, which might
bode more promising results. This
process should be done in about a
year.

EMRs "allow us to manage quality
in a more robust way," Feinberg wrote
in an email to The Daily.They' 'allow us
to become even an even greater learn
ing organization."
Ultimately, physicians like Suther
land, Feinberg and Blumenthal feel
that EMRs will be more widely
adopted over time, so long as they are
used in a manner that supports their
overarching goal.
"It won't happen automatically;
they must be used to their full capaci
ty," Blumenthal said. "They certainly
have some potential to reduce spend
ing in ways that would not be possible
with paperwork."
