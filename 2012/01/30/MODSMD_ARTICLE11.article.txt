## FRESHMAN '15 The 						ski trip from hell 
### Bianca Chavez 
It would be majorly difficult
for me to pick my favorite
Stanford tradition. Sure, Full
Moon was fun in a very strange
Can't-Believe-Stanford-Allows-
This-Orgy-to-Happen kind of
way (The Great Mono Outbreak
of 2011 that hit my dorm soon
after was not so fun, but that's
another story.) And all the
events of Big Game week es
pecially Gaieties were defi
nitely cray.
But, if forced to decide, I
would say ski trip has been the
best experience of my year thus
far. For two days, my dormmates
and our fabulous RAs spent
time relaxing in the beautiful
mountains of Lake Tahoe. It was
a perfectly peaceful weekend
full of fuzzy ski socks, hot choco
late, skiing and plenty of naps.
Oh wait, did I say it was relax
ing? I'm sorry, I meant crazy as
hell.
From before we even left cam
pus, our trip seemed doomed.
Due to weather conditions, one of
our bus drivers cancelled on us a
mere 30 minutes before our
scheduled departure time of 6
p.m. (Apparently the driver was
not prepared to drive through
snow. Even though he obviously
knew we were headed to a ski re
sort. Let's pause let that irony
sink in for a moment, shall we?)
With no way to secure more
buses due to the weather, the
chances of our trip happening at
all looked slim.
Fortunately, my RA Aleena
stepped in to save the day. She
was forceful enough to convince
the transportation company to
send us another bus. My dorm re
joiced at this new development
and quickly piled onto the bus
and headed to Tahoe less than
two hours behind schedule.
The rest of that night and Sat
urday passed without event
except for our food situation.
Stanford Dining provided us with
enough food for seven meals,
which, in theory, should have
been just enough. Unfortunately,
the kids in my dorm majorly suck
at rationing food. By Saturday
morning, less than 12 hours after
we had arrived in Tahoe, most of
our sandwich bread and all of our
snacks were completely gone. We
spent the rest of the weekend on
a Regina George All-Carb Diet
of bagels, breakfast pastries and
frozen lasagna.
But this tiny little first-world
problem paled in comparison to
the epic journey that was our
trip back to Stanford. This time,
one of our buses got stuck in a
snowdrift while it was en route
to pick us up. Bruce the bus driv
er reacted in a logical way by

calling a snowplow to come free
the bus. (Actually, this very
nearly ended in tragedy, as the
snowplow came dangerously
close to falling off a cliff while it
was attempting to dig the bus
out.) However, Bruce made one
tiny mistake: he forgot to call
our RAs and tell them he was
stuck. After several hours had
passed, we were still one bus
and one bus driver short, and
our RAs were close to calling
the police and filing a missing
persons report. Apart from the
fact that we misplaced Bruce,
our RAs still had one more
major problem to solve: how
were we going to get home?
Given the icy roads, low visibili
ty and the fact that our bus driv
er was lost on the frozen tundra,
it was decided that half of the
dorm would stay in the rental
house for another night if we
could not secure another bus.
That would have been a fine
idea, except for the minor fact
that we only had cake and
frozen lasagnas left to feed 40
people. (I'm pretty sure that was
exactly how the Donner Party
started, by the way.)
Fortunately, before any of us
resorted to cannibalism, Bruce
and the missing bus were locat
ed. He quickly made his way
over to our house, and each
member of my dorm made it
home safely by 4 a.m. only
eight hours after our original
ETA.
So, in one word, Twain ski trip
was a shitshow. And yet, those
were still some of the best 48
hours of my life. Why? Because
through all of the challenges we
faced, our dorm forged a tight
bond. It would have been easy to
whine and complain about our
lack of real food, or the fact that
our rental house was insanely
crowded, or the fact that our bus
driver went AWOL and we came
dangerously close to being
stranded. But instead these set
backs became ways to form
friendships with people in the
dorm who we didn't typically
talk to. After all, it's pretty im
possible not to bond with some
one if you're sharing a twin bed
with her and three other people.

frozen lasagna.
But this tiny little first-world
problem paled in comparison to
the epic journey that was our
trip back to Stanford. This time,
one of our buses got stuck in a
snowdrift while it was en route
to pick us up. Bruce the bus driv
er reacted in a logical way by

calling a snowplow to come free
the bus. (Actually, this very
nearly ended in tragedy, as the
snowplow came dangerously
close to falling off a cliff while it
was attempting to dig the bus
out.) However, Bruce made one
tiny mistake: he forgot to call
our RAs and tell them he was
stuck. After several hours had
passed, we were still one bus
and one bus driver short, and
our RAs were close to calling
the police and filing a missing
persons report. Apart from the
fact that we misplaced Bruce,
our RAs still had one more
major problem to solve: how
were we going to get home?
Given the icy roads, low visibili
ty and the fact that our bus driv
er was lost on the frozen tundra,
it was decided that half of the
dorm would stay in the rental
house for another night if we
could not secure another bus.
That would have been a fine
idea, except for the minor fact
that we only had cake and
frozen lasagnas left to feed 40
people. (I'm pretty sure that was
exactly how the Donner Party
started, by the way.)
Fortunately, before any of us
resorted to cannibalism, Bruce
and the missing bus were locat
ed. He quickly made his way
over to our house, and each
member of my dorm made it
home safely by 4 a.m. only
eight hours after our original
ETA.
So, in one word, Twain ski trip
was a shitshow. And yet, those
were still some of the best 48
hours of my life. Why? Because
through all of the challenges we
faced, our dorm forged a tight
bond. It would have been easy to
whine and complain about our
lack of real food, or the fact that
our rental house was insanely
crowded, or the fact that our bus
driver went AWOL and we came
dangerously close to being
stranded. But instead these set
backs became ways to form
friendships with people in the
dorm who we didn't typically
talk to. After all, it's pretty im
possible not to bond with some
one if you're sharing a twin bed
with her and three other people.

It would be majorly difficult
for me to pick my favorite
Stanford tradition. Sure, Full
Moon was fun in a very strange
Can't-Believe-Stanford-Allows-
This-Orgy-to-Happen kind of
way (The Great Mono Outbreak
of 2011 that hit my dorm soon
after was not so fun, but that's
another story.) And all the
events of Big Game week es
pecially Gaieties were defi
nitely cray.
But, if forced to decide, I
would say ski trip has been the
best experience of my year thus
far. For two days, my dormmates
and our fabulous RAs spent
time relaxing in the beautiful
mountains of Lake Tahoe. It was
a perfectly peaceful weekend
full of fuzzy ski socks, hot choco
late, skiing and plenty of naps.
Oh wait, did I say it was relax
ing? I'm sorry, I meant crazy as
hell.
From before we even left cam
pus, our trip seemed doomed.
Due to weather conditions, one of
our bus drivers cancelled on us a
mere 30 minutes before our
scheduled departure time of 6
p.m. (Apparently the driver was
not prepared to drive through
snow. Even though he obviously
knew we were headed to a ski re
sort. Let's pause let that irony
sink in for a moment, shall we?)
With no way to secure more
buses due to the weather, the
chances of our trip happening at
all looked slim.
Fortunately, my RA Aleena
stepped in to save the day. She
was forceful enough to convince
the transportation company to
send us another bus. My dorm re
joiced at this new development
and quickly piled onto the bus
and headed to Tahoe less than
two hours behind schedule.
The rest of that night and Sat
urday passed without event
except for our food situation.
Stanford Dining provided us with
enough food for seven meals,
which, in theory, should have
been just enough. Unfortunately,
the kids in my dorm majorly suck
at rationing food. By Saturday
morning, less than 12 hours after
we had arrived in Tahoe, most of
our sandwich bread and all of our
snacks were completely gone. We
spent the rest of the weekend on
a Regina George All-Carb Diet
of bagels, breakfast pastries and
frozen lasagna.
