# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## The
						boy who cried war 
### Miles Unterreiner 
America's last "good war"
that is, a war the vast majori
ty of the population could
agree was worth fighting formal
ly ended on the second of Septem
ber, 1945, aboard the USS Missouri.
Since the Japanese surrender that
day, the American people have be
come ever more reluctant to go to
war, less and less likely to agree
about when and where we ought to
fight, and ever less unanimous in our
collective determination to keep on
fighting once we decide to start.
Conservatives tend to interpret
this gradual march toward pacifism
as a symptom of American decline,
to attribute this dearth of fighting
spirit to the enervating influence of a
cowardly, degenerate liberalism.
This interpretation of history attrib
utes our lack of national unity on
Vietnam, on Iraq, on Afghanistan
and now on Libya to the weakening
resolve and increasingly craven will
of a people no longer prepared, as
we once were, to suffer and die for
freedom's sake.
But I disagree. Our troops are no
less brave, our national character no
more degraded. We are certainly no
less patriotic or caring for our sol
diers than we used to be, even if we

still do not care quite as much as we
should; I have yet to hear about a re
turning soldier being spit upon or
mocked, as Vietnam vets often were,
and the national celebration of bin
Laden's death-by-SEAL was near
unanimous, even here at notoriously
liberal Stanford.
No, the American people are un
willing to fight because we have
been lied to too often, for too long
and to the great and irreparable loss
of too many. The nation has become
skeptical about war because, like the
proverbial townspeople guarding
their sheep, we feel we can no longer
trust the people calling us to action.
The lies started in Vietnam, when
presidents, policymakers and pun
dits fed the American people a series
of falsehoods that would eventually
kill millions. They told us that the war
would be easy; that, once we had
started to fight, we were winning;
and that if Vietnam fell to commu
nism, the rest of Asia would follow.
The war was not easy; we did not
win; and the rest of Asia did not turn
red. But as the last American heli
copter left South Vietnam, the lies
began to take their toll, and disillu
sionment, discord and a distrust of
government began to set in.

When the time came for war in
Iraq, so also came more lies.
Here is former deputy ambassa
dor to the U.N. Ken Adelman in Feb
ruary of 2002: "I believe that demol
ishing Hussein's military power and
liberating Iraq would be a cake
walk."
Here is Dick Cheney on Aug. 26,
2002: "Simply stated, there is no
doubt that Saddam Hussein now has
weapons of mass destruction."
Here's Cheney again, in March:
"My belief is we will, in fact, be greet
ed as liberators... I think it'll go rel
atively quickly ... Weeks rather
than months."
Here is George W. Bush, standing
proudly in front of a banner reading
"Mission Accomplished" on May 1,
2003: "We do not know the day of
final victory, but we have seen the
turning ... In the Battle of Iraq, the
United States and our allies have
