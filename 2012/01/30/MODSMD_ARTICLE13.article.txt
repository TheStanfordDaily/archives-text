## Men's hoops needs to fight like Nadal 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Late Saturday night, or
more accurately early
Sunday morning, I
watched one of the most
fascinating sporting events
I'd ever seen. It kept me up until 7
a.m. even though it was my first time
watching the sport in several months.
I had no strong rooting interest, but it
was still one of the most rewarding
experiences I've had watching sports
in a long time.
The event was the Australian
Open final between Novak
Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. The top
two players in the world played one
of the best tennis matches ever, oblit
erating the record for the longest
Grand Slam final in history by squar
ing off for nearly six hours. Six hours.
You could watch the entire third sea
son of Arrested Development in that
time and still have enough time to
watch a whole basketball game, too.
It wasn't just the length of the
match that made it fascinating.
Djokovic and Nadal are two of the
best players in tennis history, and
they showed why in this match. Even
after five hours of running, diving,
jumping and smacking the Wilson
logo off the ball, these two guys were
still peppering blistering shots all
over the court. Some of the best
points I've ever seen were at the tail
end of this match, when any mortal
person would have been fainting
from exhaustion.
For a while, a six-hour marathon
seemed very unlikely. Djokovic
looked flat early, allowing Nadal to
take the first set 7-5. After that,
Djokovic took control, winning the
next two sets and appearing to cruise
toward victory. As the fourth set wore
on, though, Nadal just kept hanging
around, and a late spurt allowed him
to win the fourth and nearly take the
match in the fifth. Djokovic ended up
winning, but anyone watching the
match had to be impressed with
Nadal's fight in that match.
Now, it may have just been the
sleep deprivation in me, but the
match got me thinking about some
thing several thousand miles closer
to home: the Stanford men's basket
ball team. Yep, the Cardinal is like
Nadal. I know it seems like a stretch,
but bear with me.
This year, Stanford got off to a
quick start, winning 10 of its first 11
games and nearly knocking off Syra
cuse. The Cardinal has since hit a
rough patch, going just 5-5 over its
past 10 games, including a bad home
loss to Butler and four road losses by
double digits. Just like Nadal, Stan
ford looks to be down and out. Of
course, Stanford is nowhere near as
good at basketball as Nadal is at ten
nis, but thankfully the Pac-12 is no
Djokovic. And that's exactly where
the parallel comes in.
We're halfway through the Pac
-12 season, and even with the poor
performances by Stanford, the Car
dinal can look up at the standings and
see a golden opportunity to get right
back in contention. Nadal saw his op
portunity and parlayed it into a near
win in the Aussie Open. Whether or
not Stanford is able to finish strong
and contend, the opening is there for
the taking.
This was particularly evident in
last night's game at Cal. Stanford was
very flat early, shooting below 30 per
cent for much of the first half The
Golden Bears couldn't build a very
big lead, though, and an unexpected
boost from Stefan Nastic allowed the
Cardinal to hang around. Stanford
got virtually nothing from its back
court duo of Chasson Randle and
Aaron Bright (two points, no field
goals in the first 34 minutes), yet the
Cardinal actually took the lead in the
second half and was still just one
small run from taking control for
much of the game.
Stanford is a very inconsistent
team, as evidenced by the sudden
outbursts from role-players and the
equally frequent disappearances
from starters. Even with these woes,
the Cardinal is still in position to con
tend in the Pac-12, two games behind
co-leaders Washington and Cal. Just
nine games remain, and five of them
will be at Maples Pavilion, where
Stanford is 11-1. The Cardinal does
n't have to play the Washington
schools anymore, and two of the four
remaining road games are against
bottom-feeders Utah and USC.
Of course, just like Nadal against
Djokovic, Stanford didn't have
enough down the stretch against Cal.
