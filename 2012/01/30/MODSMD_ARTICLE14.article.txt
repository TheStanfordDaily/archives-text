# BEARS BULLY CARDINAL
## STANFORD LOSES THIRD STRAIGHT ROAD GAME 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hoping to rebound from a
tough journey through Washing
ton that saw it drop from first to
fifth in the Pac-12, the Stanford
men's basketball team (15-6, 5-4
Pac-12) traveled to Berkeley
Sunday night to take on the rival
California Golden Bears. De
spite a strong first half, the Cardi
nal was not able to stick with the
Bears, ending a disappointing
road trip with its third straight
loss, 69-59.

Cal (17-5,7-2) was coming off
a surprising defeat at the hands of
Washington State, but had been
utterly dominant at home, enter
ing the matchup with a sterling
13-0 record at Haas Pavilion.
Sophomore forward Dwight
Powell made his second straight
appearance in the starting lineup

after being hampered by injuries
for much of the season, and he
immediately made his presence
felt. Powell had scored 20 points
in Stanford's last meeting with
the Bears and seemed poised for
another big game, scoring nine of
the Cardinal's first 14 points.
Die rest of the Stanford team,
however, couldn't buy a bucket,
and the Bears roared to a 25-16
lead 15 minutes into the first half.
At this point, sophomore center
Stefan Nastic took over. The big
man, who had played over 10
minutes just once this season,
scored eight of his career-high 11
points in the last five minutes as
Stanford stormed back to take a
33-32 lead into the half.
Both teams came out of the
locker room weakly, combining for
just five points in the first five min
utes. The poor shooting continued,
leaving Cal clinging to a slim 44-43
lead at the 10-minute mark.
At that point the wheels start
ed to come off for the Cardinal.
Stanford shot 6-for-14 from the
field to close the game, as well as
a horrendous 4-for-9 from the

charity stripe. The Cardinal also
committed nine of its 25 fouls
over that time frame, with Powell
fouling out at the 4:55 mark.
Poor shooting has been a re
curring theme for the Cardinal,
as it suffered from its third
straight horrible performance,
hitting just 38.5 percent from the
field, 63 percent from the line and
13.3 percent from three-point
range. It marked Stanford's sev
enth straight game making fewer
than 70 percent of its free throws,
a terrible figure that head coach
Johnny Dawkins needs to work
on correcting as the Cardinal falls
further and further from NCAA
Tournament contention.
Stanford was outrebounded
for just the fourth time this year
(yet second time in a row). The
Cardinal was especially hurt by a
weak performance on the offen
sive boards, as it managed just
four to Cal's 10.
Cal's senior point guard Jorge
Gutierrez managed to snag 12 re
bounds, more than doubling his
season average and equaling the
number of boards grabbed by

Stanford's leading rebounders
Josh Owens and Josh Huestis
combined.
The Bears pulled away after
halftime due primarily to an im
pressive effort from senior for
ward Harper Kamp. Kamp
scored 13 of his 15 points in the
last 15 minutes while taking just
five shots from the field the en
tire game.
For the second straight game,
Stanford was unable to stop the
opposing guard play. Gutierrez,
Allen Crabbe and Justin Cobbs
combined for 42 of the Bears' 69
points, with Crabbe leading all
scorers with 18.
With another loss, Stanford
has now fallen into a tie for fifth
in the conference, two games
back from leaders Cal and Wash
ington. The Card will return to
Maples Pavilion this week to take
on Arizona State and Arizona,
needing wins in order to stay in
the hunt for the Pac-12 crown
and an NCAA Tournament bid.

straight horrible performance,
hitting just 38.5 percent from the
field, 63 percent from the line and
13.3 percent from three-point
range. It marked Stanford's sev
enth straight game making fewer
than 70 percent of its free throws,
a terrible figure that head coach
Johnny Dawkins needs to work
on correcting as the Cardinal falls
further and further from NCAA
Tournament contention.
Stanford was outrebounded
for just the fourth time this year
(yet second time in a row). The
Cardinal was especially hurt by a
weak performance on the offen
sive boards, as it managed just
four to Cal's 10.
Cal's senior point guard Jorge
Gutierrez managed to snag 12 re
bounds, more than doubling his
season average and equaling the
number of boards grabbed by

Stanford's leading rebounders
Josh Owens and Josh Huestis
combined.
The Bears pulled away after
halftime due primarily to an im
pressive effort from senior for
ward Harper Kamp. Kamp
scored 13 of his 15 points in the
last 15 minutes while taking just
five shots from the field the en
tire game.
For the second straight game,
Stanford was unable to stop the
opposing guard play. Gutierrez,
Allen Crabbe and Justin Cobbs
combined for 42 of the Bears' 69
points, with Crabbe leading all
scorers with 18.
With another loss, Stanford
has now fallen into a tie for fifth
in the conference, two games
back from leaders Cal and Wash
ington. The Card will return to
Maples Pavilion this week to take
on Arizona State and Arizona,
needing wins in order to stay in
the hunt for the Pac-12 crown
and an NCAA Tournament bid.
