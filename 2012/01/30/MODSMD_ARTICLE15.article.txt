# WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Stanford sweeps SoCal road trip 
### GEORGE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The dual meets may pile up
weekend after weekend, but the
Cardinal women's swimming and
diving team just keeps on rolling.
For the second weekend in a row,
No. 8 Stanford (8-1, 5-0 Pac-12)
took tough back-to-back meets in
stride, beating UCLA 164-134
and No. 7 USC 160.5-139.5 on the
road.
Against the Bruins on Friday,
the Cardinal swam to a record-set
ting night, shattering pool and
meet records left and right. Senior

sprint specialist Sam Woodward
continued to make the best of her
senior season by breaking both
the pool and meet record in the 50
freestyle. En route to a victory in
that event, Woodward's time of
22.67 seconds easily shattered
UCLA Spieker Aquatic Center's
previous pool record 0f22.90. Sen
ior teammate Betsy Webb also
broke the old pool and meet
record in the 50 freestyle, but fin
ished second behind Woodward
by two-tenths of a second. Die 50
freestyle was one of two individual
event wins for Woodward, who
also won the 100 butterfly with a

come-from-behind performance
to touch out UCLA's Yasi Jahan-

But Woodward wasn't alone on
the action. Junior Andi Murez
likewise broke the pool and meet
record in the 100 freestyle, holding
off Bruin swimmer Kathryn Mur
phy down the stretch. Sophomore
Felicia Lee also broke the meet
record in the 200 backstroke a

record that had been untouched
since 1994 and in the process,
smoked the competition field by
almost three seconds.
While these Cardinal swim
mers showed terrific mid-season
speed, the toughest swimmer of
the meet might have been sopho
more Andie Taylor. Not only did
Taylor win three individual
events, but she also posted times
that were faster than the NCAA
"B" cut in two of the three events
the 200 freestyle and 400 indi
vidual medley.

1/28, Los Angeles, Calif
On the diving board, sopho
more Stephanie Phipps continued
her dual-meet consistency by
sweeping the 1-meter and 3-
meter springboard events. Her
efforts on the board helped the
Cardinal outscore a deep Bruins
diving squad by a collective score
of 21-17.
A day later, Stanford went
into No. 7 USC's McDonald's
Swim Stadium as a slight under
dog according to the national
rankings. But the Cardinal would
have none of it, as the team start
ed off the meet with a huge win in
the 200 medley relay. The 1-3 fin
ish in that event gave the Cardi
nal a 13-4 lead that was never re
linquished.
Woodward had another stel
lar performance by winning a
total of four events, including two
relays. The senior led a critical
Cardinal 1-2-3 sweep in the 50
freestyle. Six events later, Wood
ward dove into the pool again and
essentially sealed the meet for the
Cardinal with a victory in the 100
butterfly.
But the most intriguing
matchup of Saturday was probably
between Stanford's Maya Dißado
and USC's Katinka Hosszu. The
senior Trojan swimmer is one of
the fastest and most versatile
swimmers in the country. Hosszu is
an Olympian who represented
Hungary in 2008, a World Champi
onship gold medalist, an eight-time
Ail-American, a three-time
NCAA champion in one year and
the 2011 NCAA Swimmer of the
Meet.

But swimming unfazed, the
sophomore Dißado held her own
in the three events that she raced

against Hosszu. In the 200 individ
ual medley, Dißado was just
touched out by Hosszu, but the
Cardinal swimmer defended her
status as the country's current
fastest swimmer in the 200 back
stroke by defeating Hosszu in that
event by over a full second.
Although Stanford dominated
most of the meet, there were a few
events where USC put up a tough
fight. USC certainly took advan
tage Stanford's weak spot in the
breaststroke events as the Trojans
outscored the Cardinal 30-8 in
those races. USC diver Victoria
Ishimatsu swept the diving events,
which helped the Trojans stay at
least in contention throughout the
meet. But even those advantages
could not cancel out the Cardinal's
1-2-3 sweep of the Trojans in three
events.
"I was most pleased with our
team's toughness and their enthu
siasm. We are a process-focused
team but obviously we are pleased
with the outcome," said head
coach Lea Maurer. "We are fo
cused on the Pac-12 and the
NCAA championship. Every
week our goal is to get better as in
dividuals and as a team."
Stanford's current five-meet
winning streak is a testament to its
ability to respond under heavy
pressure, limited rest and tough
adversity. The team will now have
two weeks of uninterrupted train
ing before the showdown with its
biggest rival, California. As luck
would have it, Cal is currently the
No. 1 team in the nation. But the
past two weekends have shown
that the Cardinal is capable of
beating a higher-ranked opponent
on any given day. If Stanford can
beat Cal, the women's team will
end the regular season undefeated
in Pac-12 competition.

almost three seconds.
While these Cardinal swim
mers showed terrific mid-season
speed, the toughest swimmer of
the meet might have been sopho
more Andie Taylor. Not only did
Taylor win three individual
events, but she also posted times
that were faster than the NCAA

the 200 freestyle and 400 indi

1/28, Los Angeles, Calif
On the diving board, sopho
more Stephanie Phipps continued
her dual-meet consistency by
sweeping the 1-meter and 3-
meter springboard events. Her
efforts on the board helped the
Cardinal outscore a deep Bruins
diving squad by a collective score
of 21-17.
A day later, Stanford went
into No. 7 USC's McDonald's
Swim Stadium as a slight under
dog according to the national
rankings. But the Cardinal would
have none of it, as the team start
ed off the meet with a huge win in
the 200 medley relay. The 1-3 fin
ish in that event gave the Cardi
nal a 13-4 lead that was never re
linquished.
Woodward had another stel
lar performance by winning a
total of four events, including two
relays. The senior led a critical
Cardinal 1-2-3 sweep in the 50
freestyle. Six events later, Wood
ward dove into the pool again and
essentially sealed the meet for the
Cardinal with a victory in the 100
butterfly.
But the most intriguing
matchup of Saturday was probably
between Stanford's Maya Dißado
and USC's Katinka Hosszu. The
senior Trojan swimmer is one of
the fastest and most versatile
swimmers in the country. Hosszu is
an Olympian who represented
Hungary in 2008, a World Champi
onship gold medalist, an eight-time
Ail-American, a three-time
NCAA champion in one year and
the 2011 NCAA Swimmer of the
Meet.

But swimming unfazed, the
sophomore Dißado held her own
in the three events that she raced

against Hosszu. In the 200 individ
ual medley, Dißado was just
touched out by Hosszu, but the
Cardinal swimmer defended her
status as the country's current
fastest swimmer in the 200 back
stroke by defeating Hosszu in that
event by over a full second.
Although Stanford dominated
most of the meet, there were a few
events where USC put up a tough
fight. USC certainly took advan
tage Stanford's weak spot in the
breaststroke events as the Trojans
outscored the Cardinal 30-8 in
those races. USC diver Victoria
Ishimatsu swept the diving events,
which helped the Trojans stay at
least in contention throughout the
meet. But even those advantages
could not cancel out the Cardinal's
1-2-3 sweep of the Trojans in three
events.
"I was most pleased with our
team's toughness and their enthu
siasm. We are a process-focused
team but obviously we are pleased
with the outcome," said head
coach Lea Maurer. "We are fo
cused on the Pac-12 and the
NCAA championship. Every
week our goal is to get better as in
dividuals and as a team."
Stanford's current five-meet
winning streak is a testament to its
ability to respond under heavy
pressure, limited rest and tough
adversity. The team will now have
two weeks of uninterrupted train
ing before the showdown with its
biggest rival, California. As luck
would have it, Cal is currently the
No. 1 team in the nation. But the
past two weekends have shown
that the Cardinal is capable of
beating a higher-ranked opponent
on any given day. If Stanford can
beat Cal, the women's team will
end the regular season undefeated
in Pac-12 competition.

The No. 8 Stanford women's swimming and diving team had a very
successful weekend road trip to the Los Angeles schools, setting several
pool records in a win over UCLA before a tough victory at No. 7 USC.
The dual meets may pile up
weekend after weekend, but the
Cardinal women's swimming and
diving team just keeps on rolling.
For the second weekend in a row,
No. 8 Stanford (8-1, 5-0 Pac-12)
took tough back-to-back meets in
stride, beating UCLA 164-134
and No. 7 USC 160.5-139.5 on the
road.
Against the Bruins on Friday,
the Cardinal swam to a record-set
ting night, shattering pool and
meet records left and right. Senior

sprint specialist Sam Woodward
continued to make the best of her
senior season by breaking both
the pool and meet record in the 50
freestyle. En route to a victory in
that event, Woodward's time of
22.67 seconds easily shattered
UCLA Spieker Aquatic Center's
previous pool record 0f22.90. Sen
ior teammate Betsy Webb also
broke the old pool and meet
record in the 50 freestyle, but fin
ished second behind Woodward
by two-tenths of a second. Die 50
freestyle was one of two individual
event wins for Woodward, who
also won the 100 butterfly with a

come-from-behind performance
to touch out UCLA's Yasi Jahan-

But Woodward wasn't alone on
the action. Junior Andi Murez
likewise broke the pool and meet
record in the 100 freestyle, holding
off Bruin swimmer Kathryn Mur
phy down the stretch. Sophomore
Felicia Lee also broke the meet
record in the 200 backstroke a

record that had been untouched
since 1994 and in the process,
smoked the competition field by
almost three seconds.
