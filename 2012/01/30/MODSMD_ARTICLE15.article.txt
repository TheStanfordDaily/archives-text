# WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Stanford sweeps SoCal road trip 
### GEORGE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The dual meets may pile up
weekend after weekend, but the
Cardinal women's swimming and
diving team just keeps on rolling.
For the second weekend in a row,
No. 8 Stanford (8-1, 5-0 Pac-12)
took tough back-to-back meets in
stride, beating UCLA 164-134
and No. 7 USC 160.5-139.5 on the
road.
Against the Bruins on Friday,
the Cardinal swam to a record-set
ting night, shattering pool and
meet records left and right. Senior

sprint specialist Sam Woodward
continued to make the best of her
senior season by breaking both
the pool and meet record in the 50
freestyle. En route to a victory in
that event, Woodward's time of
22.67 seconds easily shattered
UCLA Spieker Aquatic Center's
previous pool record 0f22.90. Sen
ior teammate Betsy Webb also
broke the old pool and meet
record in the 50 freestyle, but fin
ished second behind Woodward
by two-tenths of a second. Die 50
freestyle was one of two individual
event wins for Woodward, who
also won the 100 butterfly with a

come-from-behind performance
to touch out UCLA's Yasi Jahan-

But Woodward wasn't alone on
the action. Junior Andi Murez
likewise broke the pool and meet
record in the 100 freestyle, holding
off Bruin swimmer Kathryn Mur
phy down the stretch. Sophomore
Felicia Lee also broke the meet
record in the 200 backstroke a

record that had been untouched
since 1994 and in the process,
smoked the competition field by
almost three seconds.
While these Cardinal swim
mers showed terrific mid-season
speed, the toughest swimmer of
the meet might have been sopho
more Andie Taylor. Not only did
Taylor win three individual
events, but she also posted times
that were faster than the NCAA
"B" cut in two of the three events
the 200 freestyle and 400 indi
vidual medley.
