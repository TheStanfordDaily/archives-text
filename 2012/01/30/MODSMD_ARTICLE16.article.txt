# CARD EKES OUT WIN OVER CAL
## 
### DEAN MCARDLE 
Sophomore forward Chiney
Ogwumike tallied career highs
with 27 points and 18 rebounds to
lead the No. 4 Cardinal to a 74-71
overtime victory against rival
California on Saturday.

Chiney's sister, junior
Nnemkadi, contributed 12
points, jumping ahead of Val
Whiting for fourth place on the
all-time scoring list. Sophomore
Toni Kokenis added 16 points,
sinking two free throws with 23
seconds left in overtime to seal
the game for Stanford.
With the win, the Cardinal
(18-1, 9-0 Pac-12) remains per
fect in conference play and builds
a three-game lead in the Pac-12
over the Golden Bears (15-6, 6-
3), who are tied for second with
Arizona State. Stanford has won
15 straight overall and has yet to
lose at Maples Pavilion this sea
son, stretching its home winning
streak to 74 games.
Cal was the last team to beat
the Cardinal at home, doing so in
2007, and almost repeated the
feat on Saturday. The Golden
Bears surged for the final nine
points of regulation to force the
game into overtime.
In the overtime period the
Cardinal defense held Cal to two
points on l-for-9 shooting. Cal
had late opportunities to tie the
game with two potential game
tying three-pointers, but both
missed the mark.
Freshman Brittany Boyd
paced the Golden Bears with 19
points and junior Layshia
Clarendon chipped in 17. Claren
don, who started the day with 999
career points, became the 22nd
Cal player in history to reach the
1,000-point milestone.
This was the first overtime
game for the Cardinal this sea
son. "All of us, players, coaches,
we can all learn from a game like
this," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "Coaches and
players will really benefit from

this type of environment. This
was a tournament environment
and I'm really proud of our
team."
Both teams struggled shoot
ing in the first half, going 1-for-16
combined from beyond the arc.
Stanford made up for its poor
shooting by capitalizing on Cal
mistakes. The Cardinal scored 10
points off turnovers to climb
ahead by halftime.
The Cardinal led 38-29 at the
half and held that lead late into
the game. The Golden Bears
trailed by as many as 14, but they
clawed back and the lead was
only nine with 2:27 remaining in
regulation.
Clarendon, Cal's leading scor
er on the season, took over in the
final two minutes.
The junior accounted for
seven of the nine points during
Cal's late run, including two free
throws with 27 seconds left to tie
the game. Nnemkadi Ogwumike
missed a jumper for Stanford in
the final seconds to send the
game into overtime.
The late miss reflected a diffi
cult game offensively for Stan
ford's senior leader. "They were
doubling, that's it, it's as simple as
that," Nnemkadi Ogwumike
said, "but once they double me,
that leaves one other person
open. And clearly they took their
chances, and Chiney can take
care of business, and" that's how
we work."
Nnemkadi's sister Chiney
more than picked up the slack.
Chiney Ogwumike's layup
early in the extra period was the
only field goal for the Cardinal in
overtime, and she later added the
front-end of a one-and-one to
give the Cardinal a one-point
lead.
Stanford dominated the in
side game, notching 44 points in
the paint to just 24 for the Gold
en Bears.The Cardinal shot poor
ly from three-point range, how
ever, going just 3-for-20 on the
night. Freshman Bonnie Samuel
son was the only bright spot for
the Cardinal from beyond the
arc, making both of her three
point attempts.
"We have great three-point
shooters. They've been working

really hard in the gym this week.
I think that they're maybe just
putting a little pressure on them
selves," VanDerveer said after
the game. "We can win other
ways. When our threes start
falling then we'll be really good."
Both head coaches were
pleased with their teams' effort,
expressing admiration for how
well the game was played.
"It was quite a basketball
game," said first-year Cal head
coach Lindsay Gottlieb. "I think
[the game was] really good for
women's college basketball, and
for the Bay Area. I told our players
when I walked in our locker room
that I've never been more happy
to be their coach, and the only

thing that could have made me
happier is if they were jumping up
and down celebrating with a win."
VanDerveer articulate a simi
lar sentiment. "This is great for
us. This is great for Bay Area
women's basketball. The saddest
thing for me is the fact that it was
n't on television."
Stanford travels south for two
Pac-12 games in the Grand
Canyon State this week. Arizona
State hosts the Cardinal on
Thursday and Arizona does the
same on Saturday. Stanford's
next home game is Feb. 9 against
use.

Tara VanDerveer. "Coaches and
players will really benefit from

this type of environment. This
was a tournament environment
and I'm really proud of our
team."
Both teams struggled shoot
ing in the first half, going 1-for-16
combined from beyond the arc.
Stanford made up for its poor
shooting by capitalizing on Cal
mistakes. The Cardinal scored 10
points off turnovers to climb
ahead by halftime.
The Cardinal led 38-29 at the
half and held that lead late into
the game. The Golden Bears
trailed by as many as 14, but they
clawed back and the lead was
only nine with 2:27 remaining in
regulation.
Clarendon, Cal's leading scor
er on the season, took over in the
final two minutes.
The junior accounted for
seven of the nine points during
Cal's late run, including two free
throws with 27 seconds left to tie
the game. Nnemkadi Ogwumike
missed a jumper for Stanford in
the final seconds to send the
game into overtime.
The late miss reflected a diffi
cult game offensively for Stan
ford's senior leader. "They were
doubling, that's it, it's as simple as
that," Nnemkadi Ogwumike
said, "but once they double me,
that leaves one other person
open. And clearly they took their
chances, and Chiney can take
care of business, and" that's how
we work."
Nnemkadi's sister Chiney
more than picked up the slack.
Chiney Ogwumike's layup
early in the extra period was the
only field goal for the Cardinal in
overtime, and she later added the
front-end of a one-and-one to
give the Cardinal a one-point
lead.
Stanford dominated the in
side game, notching 44 points in
the paint to just 24 for the Gold
en Bears.The Cardinal shot poor
ly from three-point range, how
ever, going just 3-for-20 on the
night. Freshman Bonnie Samuel
son was the only bright spot for
the Cardinal from beyond the
arc, making both of her three
point attempts.
"We have great three-point
shooters. They've been working

really hard in the gym this week.
I think that they're maybe just
putting a little pressure on them
selves," VanDerveer said after
the game. "We can win other
ways. When our threes start
falling then we'll be really good."
Both head coaches were
pleased with their teams' effort,
expressing admiration for how
well the game was played.
"It was quite a basketball
game," said first-year Cal head
coach Lindsay Gottlieb. "I think
[the game was] really good for
women's college basketball, and
for the Bay Area. I told our players
when I walked in our locker room
that I've never been more happy
to be their coach, and the only

thing that could have made me
happier is if they were jumping up
and down celebrating with a win."
VanDerveer articulate a simi
lar sentiment. "This is great for
us. This is great for Bay Area
women's basketball. The saddest
thing for me is the fact that it was
n't on television."
Stanford travels south for two
Pac-12 games in the Grand
Canyon State this week. Arizona
State hosts the Cardinal on

1/28, Maples Pavilion


MEHMET INONU/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore guard Toni Kokenis had 16 points, including the final two
points of the game, to help No. 4 Stanford hold off archrival Cal in a
surprisingly close 74-71 overtime victory Saturday at Maples Pavilion.
Sophomore forward Chiney
Ogwumike tallied career highs
with 27 points and 18 rebounds to
lead the No. 4 Cardinal to a 74-71
overtime victory against rival
California on Saturday.

Chiney's sister, junior
Nnemkadi, contributed 12
points, jumping ahead of Val
Whiting for fourth place on the
all-time scoring list. Sophomore
Toni Kokenis added 16 points,
sinking two free throws with 23
seconds left in overtime to seal
the game for Stanford.
With the win, the Cardinal
(18-1, 9-0 Pac-12) remains per
fect in conference play and builds
a three-game lead in the Pac-12
over the Golden Bears (15-6, 6-
3), who are tied for second with
Arizona State. Stanford has won
15 straight overall and has yet to
lose at Maples Pavilion this sea
son, stretching its home winning
streak to 74 games.
Cal was the last team to beat
the Cardinal at home, doing so in
2007, and almost repeated the
feat on Saturday. The Golden
Bears surged for the final nine
points of regulation to force the
game into overtime.
In the overtime period the
Cardinal defense held Cal to two
points on l-for-9 shooting. Cal
had late opportunities to tie the
game with two potential game
tying three-pointers, but both
missed the mark.
Freshman Brittany Boyd
paced the Golden Bears with 19
points and junior Layshia
Clarendon chipped in 17. Claren
don, who started the day with 999
career points, became the 22nd
Cal player in history to reach the
1,000-point milestone.

game for the Cardinal this sea
son. "All of us, players, coaches,
