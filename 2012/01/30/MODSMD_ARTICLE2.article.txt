# ResEd reinstates Kappa Sigma house
## 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
Kappa Sigma fraternity will be
reinstated to its former house at
1035 Campus Drive for the 2012-
13 academic year, announced
Deborah Golder, Dean of Resi
dential Education (ResEd), Fri
day afternoon.
The decision comes nine
months after ResEd removed
Kappa Sigma from the house, fol
lowing two years of behavior that
Golder called "dangerous," in an
interview with The Daily last
March.
"They have more work to do
and they're not done yet, but we
were very impressed with the
amount of work they've done and
want to show good faith in their

projected trajectory," Golder said.
"We were really looking for a pro
found shift in attitude and cul
ture."
"The guys have put in a lot of
work over the past couple of
months," said incoming Kappa
Sigma President Malcolm Mc-
Gregor 'l3. "We've been taking a
critical look at ourselves and cre
ating an organization that re
flects what we want as members
of the fraternity and what the
campus wants from us."
"It's a decision we've worked
hard for," said Brian Barnes 'l2,
outgoing Kappa Sigma presi
dent. "We're happy to be back."

ResEd actions
ResEd gave Kappa Sigma a
yearlong hiatus from its house in

March 2011, after the fraternity
violated its alcohol and party
probation and students com
plained about feeling unsafe in
the house.
ResEd also gave Kappa Sigma
a list of seven criteria for im
provement last March. The crite
ria were:"l) vision and organiza
tional identity; 2) shared ac
countability and responsibility;
3) stewardship and financial re
sponsibility; 4) role of alcohol in
the house and organization; 5)
partnerships; 6) community mem
bership and responsible citizen
ship; and 7) learning and engage
ment," according to a ResEd doc
ument.
Res Ed's actions against the or
ganization came just months after
the group came under review

from the national Kappa Sigma
Supreme Executive Committee
(SEC).
Along with an advisory panel
of faculty, administrators and stu
dents, ResEd judged Kappa
Sigma based on a rubric of these
criteria, in addition to a two-hour
"formal relevancy presentation"
that 10 members of the fraternity
gave Thursday night.
The review panel consisted of:
ResEd staff; Robinson House
Resident Fellow Rod Taylor; An
gela Exson, assistant dean of the
Office of Sexual Assault and Re
lationship Abuse (SARA) Edu
cation and Response; and student
representatives from the Greek
community. Golder, ResEd Asso
ciate Dean Nate Boswell and
ResEd Greek Advisor Amanda

Rodriguez also contributed to the
process.

Fraternity progress
Since losing its house in
March, Kappa Sigma has reorgan
ized its internal structure and
partnered with University offices
and campus groups on communi
ty-based projects.
"Some of the weaknesses we
identified with the former struc
ture of Kappa Sigma was the lack
of internal accountability and that
our lack of a concrete vision
stemmed from a lack of organiza
tional structure," McGregor said.
According to McGregor,
Kappa Sigma has replaced a pre
vious structure that included
