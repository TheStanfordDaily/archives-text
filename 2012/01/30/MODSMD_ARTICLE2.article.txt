# ResEd reinstates Kappa Sigma house
## 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
Kappa Sigma fraternity will be
reinstated to its former house at
1035 Campus Drive for the 2012-
13 academic year, announced
Deborah Golder, Dean of Resi
dential Education (ResEd), Fri
day afternoon.
The decision comes nine
months after ResEd removed
Kappa Sigma from the house, fol
lowing two years of behavior that
Golder called "dangerous," in an
interview with The Daily last
March.
"They have more work to do
and they're not done yet, but we
were very impressed with the
amount of work they've done and
want to show good faith in their

projected trajectory," Golder said.
"We were really looking for a pro
found shift in attitude and cul
ture."
"The guys have put in a lot of
work over the past couple of
months," said incoming Kappa
Sigma President Malcolm Mc-
Gregor 'l3. "We've been taking a
critical look at ourselves and cre
ating an organization that re
flects what we want as members
of the fraternity and what the
campus wants from us."
"It's a decision we've worked
hard for," said Brian Barnes 'l2,
outgoing Kappa Sigma presi
dent. "We're happy to be back."

ResEd actions
ResEd gave Kappa Sigma a
yearlong hiatus from its house in

March 2011, after the fraternity
violated its alcohol and party
probation and students com
plained about feeling unsafe in
the house.
ResEd also gave Kappa Sigma
a list of seven criteria for im
provement last March. The crite
ria were:"l) vision and organiza
tional identity; 2) shared ac
countability and responsibility;
3) stewardship and financial re
sponsibility; 4) role of alcohol in
the house and organization; 5)
partnerships; 6) community mem
bership and responsible citizen
ship; and 7) learning and engage
ment," according to a ResEd doc
ument.
Res Ed's actions against the or
ganization came just months after
the group came under review

from the national Kappa Sigma
Supreme Executive Committee
(SEC).
Along with an advisory panel
of faculty, administrators and stu
dents, ResEd judged Kappa
Sigma based on a rubric of these
criteria, in addition to a two-hour
"formal relevancy presentation"
that 10 members of the fraternity
gave Thursday night.
The review panel consisted of:
ResEd staff; Robinson House
Resident Fellow Rod Taylor; An
gela Exson, assistant dean of the
Office of Sexual Assault and Re
lationship Abuse (SARA) Edu
cation and Response; and student
representatives from the Greek
community. Golder, ResEd Asso
ciate Dean Nate Boswell and
ResEd Greek Advisor Amanda

Rodriguez also contributed to the
process.

Fraternity progress
Since losing its house in
March, Kappa Sigma has reorgan
ized its internal structure and
partnered with University offices
and campus groups on communi
ty-based projects.
"Some of the weaknesses we
identified with the former struc
ture of Kappa Sigma was the lack
of internal accountability and that
our lack of a concrete vision
stemmed from a lack of organiza
tional structure," McGregor said.
According to McGregor,
Kappa Sigma has replaced a pre
vious structure that included
loosely-defined executives and
non-executive roles with little
oversight.
The fraternity now has four
executive positions in addition to
the president, he said. Together,
these five roles will provide over
sight for non-executive positions.
"In this new structure, each of
[ResEd's] seven criteria to ad
dress corresponded with the job
description of one of those execu
tive members," McGregor said.
"The criteria are things we'll be
incorporating into our daily oper
ations for years to come."
'Divide and conquer'
The fraternity took a 'divide
and conquer approach,' to ad
dress issues of accountability and
improvement, according to
Barnes.
Barnes split the fraternity's
60 members into 11 groups, each
focused on a different facet of
fraternal life. Topics included
community outreach, the pledge
process, the treatment of women
and the role of alcohol in the
house. Tie tasked each group
with completing a proposal for
what the best practices in each of
those fields would look like, and
the fraternity presented these
projects to the review panel
Thursday.
Additionally, Kappa Sigma
will host a themed-service project
each quarter, McGregor said.
"Every winter we have decid
ed to focus on 'Student Aware
ness Events,"' wrote Kappa
Sigma community service chair
Danny Organ 'l3 in an email to
The Daily.
Last winter, the fraternity
hosted the Kappa Sigma Save the
Music Benefit Concert, as well as
a Safe and Open Spaces at Stan
ford (SOSAS) panel. The events
raised money for music education
in public schools and awareness
for issues facing LGBT students
and their allies, respectively.
"This quarter, we are partner
ing with SARA to co-sponsor an
event hosting Kevin Powell to
speak about issues of masculinity
and relationship abuse aware
ness," Organ said.
According to McGregor,
Kappa Sigma may also co-host a
SOSAS event for the entire
Greek community.
The fraternity plans to host one
lecture by an alumnus every fall as
part of 'The Stanford Family'
theme and to do service off the
Farm every spring in an effort to

go 'Beyond the Stanford Campus.'
As a result of the program
ming, U.S. Ambassador to Japan
John Roos '77 J.D. 'BO came to
campus in the fall to discuss the
implications of the March 2011
tsunami.
Kappa Sigma is also looking to
host a more Stanford-specific ver
sion of the 'Say Something' pro
gram that works to discourage by
stander apathy in situations of
high-risk drinking.
The Office of Alcohol Policy &
Education (OAPE) first hosted a
'Say Something' event in Septem
ber that was largely attended by
Kappa Sigma members, accord
ing to Barnes.
Barnes said he views these re
lationships as beneficial to Kappa
Sigma, partnering organizations
and the University at-large.
"We'd like to use OAPE and
SARA to build a partnership be
cause they are much more spe
cialized than we are," Barnes said.
"We'd like to bring up our level of
understanding and to give them
the manpower to put on bigger
events."

'No babysitting'
Golder warned Kappa Sigma
members that they should not
take her decision lightly.
"I explained to them that on
the one hand, it feels great to be
the guys who got the house back,
but that it is with very clear expec
tations and zero tolerance for any
of the behaviors that got them re
moved from the house in the first
place," Golder said.
"We are not planning on
babysitting Kappa Sigma
[they] have to take responsibility
for themselves as an organiza
tion," Golder said. "If they don't
do those things we will get in
volved."
McGregor said he under
stands being a housed organiza
tion is a privilege from the Uni
versity.
"With that devotion [from the
University], there is an obligation
to contribute back to campus,"
McGregor said. "This is some
thing we hadn't really considered
in the past and something the en
tire Greek community can take to
heart a little more."
ResEd will be working with
Kappa Sigma over the coming
months to identify benchmarks to
reflect on how the fraternity is at
tempting to meet these standards.
Golder said ResEd will devel
op a supplemental process in
coming weeks to hire student res
idential staff to live in the house
next year.

"They have more work to do
and they're not done yet, but we
were very impressed with the
amount of work they've done and
want to show good faith in their

projected trajectory," Golder said.
"We were really looking for a pro
found shift in attitude and cul
ture."
"The guys have put in a lot of
work over the past couple of
months," said incoming Kappa
Sigma President Malcolm Mc-
Gregor 'l3. "We've been taking a
critical look at ourselves and cre
ating an organization that re
flects what we want as members
of the fraternity and what the
campus wants from us."
"It's a decision we've worked
hard for," said Brian Barnes 'l2,
outgoing Kappa Sigma presi
dent. "We're happy to be back."

ResEd actions
ResEd gave Kappa Sigma a
yearlong hiatus from its house in

March 2011, after the fraternity
violated its alcohol and party
probation and students com
plained about feeling unsafe in
the house.
ResEd also gave Kappa Sigma
a list of seven criteria for im
provement last March. The crite
ria were:"l) vision and organiza
tional identity; 2) shared ac
countability and responsibility;
3) stewardship and financial re
sponsibility; 4) role of alcohol in
the house and organization; 5)
partnerships; 6) community mem
bership and responsible citizen
ship; and 7) learning and engage
ment," according to a ResEd doc
ument.
Res Ed's actions against the or
ganization came just months after
the group came under review

from the national Kappa Sigma
Supreme Executive Committee
(SEC).
Along with an advisory panel
of faculty, administrators and stu
dents, ResEd judged Kappa
Sigma based on a rubric of these
criteria, in addition to a two-hour
"formal relevancy presentation"
that 10 members of the fraternity
gave Thursday night.
The review panel consisted of:
ResEd staff; Robinson House
Resident Fellow Rod Taylor; An
gela Exson, assistant dean of the
Office of Sexual Assault and Re
lationship Abuse (SARA) Edu
cation and Response; and student
representatives from the Greek
community. Golder, ResEd Asso
ciate Dean Nate Boswell and
ResEd Greek Advisor Amanda

Rodriguez also contributed to the
process.

Fraternity progress
Since losing its house in
March, Kappa Sigma has reorgan
ized its internal structure and
partnered with University offices
and campus groups on communi
ty-based projects.
"Some of the weaknesses we
identified with the former struc
ture of Kappa Sigma was the lack
of internal accountability and that
our lack of a concrete vision
stemmed from a lack of organiza
tional structure," McGregor said.
According to McGregor,
Kappa Sigma has replaced a pre
vious structure that included
loosely-defined executives and
non-executive roles with little
oversight.
The fraternity now has four
executive positions in addition to
the president, he said. Together,
these five roles will provide over
sight for non-executive positions.
"In this new structure, each of
[ResEd's] seven criteria to ad
dress corresponded with the job
description of one of those execu
tive members," McGregor said.
"The criteria are things we'll be
incorporating into our daily oper
ations for years to come."
'Divide and conquer'
The fraternity took a 'divide
and conquer approach,' to ad
dress issues of accountability and
improvement, according to
Barnes.
Barnes split the fraternity's
60 members into 11 groups, each
focused on a different facet of
fraternal life. Topics included
community outreach, the pledge
process, the treatment of women
and the role of alcohol in the
house. Tie tasked each group
with completing a proposal for
what the best practices in each of
those fields would look like, and
the fraternity presented these
projects to the review panel
Thursday.
Additionally, Kappa Sigma
will host a themed-service project
each quarter, McGregor said.
"Every winter we have decid
ed to focus on 'Student Aware
ness Events,"' wrote Kappa
Sigma community service chair
Danny Organ 'l3 in an email to
The Daily.
Last winter, the fraternity
hosted the Kappa Sigma Save the
Music Benefit Concert, as well as
a Safe and Open Spaces at Stan
ford (SOSAS) panel. The events
raised money for music education
in public schools and awareness
for issues facing LGBT students
and their allies, respectively.
"This quarter, we are partner
ing with SARA to co-sponsor an
event hosting Kevin Powell to
speak about issues of masculinity
and relationship abuse aware
ness," Organ said.
According to McGregor,
Kappa Sigma may also co-host a
SOSAS event for the entire
Greek community.
The fraternity plans to host one
lecture by an alumnus every fall as
part of 'The Stanford Family'
theme and to do service off the
Farm every spring in an effort to

go 'Beyond the Stanford Campus.'
As a result of the program
ming, U.S. Ambassador to Japan
John Roos '77 J.D. 'BO came to
campus in the fall to discuss the
implications of the March 2011
tsunami.
Kappa Sigma is also looking to
host a more Stanford-specific ver
sion of the 'Say Something' pro
gram that works to discourage by
stander apathy in situations of
high-risk drinking.
The Office of Alcohol Policy &
Education (OAPE) first hosted a
'Say Something' event in Septem
ber that was largely attended by
Kappa Sigma members, accord
ing to Barnes.
Barnes said he views these re
lationships as beneficial to Kappa
Sigma, partnering organizations
and the University at-large.
"We'd like to use OAPE and
SARA to build a partnership be
cause they are much more spe
cialized than we are," Barnes said.
"We'd like to bring up our level of
understanding and to give them
the manpower to put on bigger
events."

'No babysitting'
Golder warned Kappa Sigma
members that they should not
take her decision lightly.
"I explained to them that on
the one hand, it feels great to be
the guys who got the house back,
but that it is with very clear expec
tations and zero tolerance for any
of the behaviors that got them re
moved from the house in the first
place," Golder said.
"We are not planning on
babysitting Kappa Sigma
[they] have to take responsibility
for themselves as an organiza
tion," Golder said. "If they don't
do those things we will get in
volved."
McGregor said he under
stands being a housed organiza
tion is a privilege from the Uni
versity.
"With that devotion [from the
University], there is an obligation
to contribute back to campus,"
McGregor said. "This is some
thing we hadn't really considered
in the past and something the en
tire Greek community can take to
heart a little more."
ResEd will be working with
Kappa Sigma over the coming
months to identify benchmarks to
reflect on how the fraternity is at
tempting to meet these standards.
Golder said ResEd will devel
op a supplemental process in
coming weeks to hire student res
idential staff to live in the house
next year.

reinstated to its former house at
1035 Campus Drive for the 2012-

Deborah Golder, Dean of Resi

The decision comes nine

Golder called "dangerous," in an
