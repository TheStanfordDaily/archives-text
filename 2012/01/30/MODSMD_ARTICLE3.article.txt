## NBC reporters escorted from Crothers 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF Ellora Israni 
The Stanford University
Department of Public Safety
(SUDPS) was called to es
cort National Broadcasting
Company (NBC) reporters
out of Crothers Hall Sunday
evening around 5:15 p.m., ac
cording to an email sent to
dorm residents by Resident
Fellow Corinne Thomas.
NBC was interviewing
residents about several inci
dents in the dorm earlier this
month. Earlier this week, the
Stanford Police sent an all
campus alert after a female,
Crothers Hall resident re
ported a subject reaching his
hand under a shower curtain
and attempting to photo
graph her on Monday
evening. That was the fourth
such incident in Crothers this
month, though the previous
three incidents were not re
ported until Monday.
The NBC interviews
including one with Stephanie
Goss 'l4 aired at 11 P.M.
Sunday evening.
In the email, Thomas re
quested that anyone who
saw the reporters again noti
fy the police, and that stu
dents interacting with the
media do so outside the
dorm.
"[NBC reporters] are not
allowed in the dorms to solic
it interviews: this is your
home and it is a private resi
dence," she said. "If anyone
wants to be interviewed
and find themselves on the
evening news by NBC or
other media, you can meet
them elsewhere."
She also noted that all re
porters should "go through
the Stanford News Service."
