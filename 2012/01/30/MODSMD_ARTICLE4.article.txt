## Political groups weigh in on Republican race 
### EDWARD NGAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Student leaders of the Stanford Republicans and
Stanford Democrats predict that Republican Mitt
Romney is most likely to win the party nomination,
even after losing by 12 points in the recent South
Carolina primary.
"Almost all the talk of [Stanford College Repub
licans] is about Romney," wrote Mary Ann Toman-
Miller 'l4, president of the Stanford College Repub
licans, in an email to The Daily. [Toman-Miller is a
Daily staffer.]

She also noted that College Republicans are en
thusiastic about the election as a whole and are ac
tively engaged in the nominating contest.
"Everybody that I have talked to in our group is
preparing to strongly support whoever is our...
nominee," she wrote. "Our members have been very
active watching the debates and feel that debating all
the issues is vital for the country."
Vice President of the Stanford Democrats Rahul
Sastry 'l3 agreed.
"In the long run Romney will win out," he said.
"He seems like he has a better-organized campaign
that's less prone t0... volatility, and more substan

tial backing by party insiders."
However, in a volatile race that has seen three dif
ferent candidates win in each of the three states that
have held votes so far, Romney is far from securing
the nomination.
"It's been really interesting to see the campaign.
.. with so many ups and downs," Sastry said. "It's
made for some great entertainment for people on
both sides of the aisle."
The Republican primary has had five national
poll leaders in 2011, including Texas Governor Rick
Perry, businessman Herman Cain,
former House Speaker Newt Gin
grich and Romney. Each has en
joyed momentary front-runner sta
tus in the press.
Perry and Cain have since
dropped out of the race.
This kind of volatility has led
news media outlets to dub the 2012
race the "most fluid" Republican pri
mary ever.
Some believe this volatile pri
mary may benefit Democratic nom
inee President Barack Obama come
November.
"I think half [of Stanford Democ
rats' membership] would like to see
a drawn out race, where Romney, or
the eventual candidate, is weakened
by the people that are competing
against him, so that makes it easier

for Obama to campaign," Sastry
said. "But there's the other argument
that a drawn-out and competitive
primary season will result in a
stronger nominee, which was cer
tainly the case between Hillary
[Clinton] and Obama in 2008."
Romney holds commanding
leads in Florida polls, which will close
on Tuesday. An NBC News/Marist
poll conducted between Jan. 25 and
Jan. 27 puts Romney ahead by 15
points in Florida. Despite this, Gin
grich leads recent national polls by as
much as nine points.
According to Sastry, there is a
reason why Stanford students favor
Romney.
"I think Gingrich is a bit of an ex
treme candidate, even by the party's
own measure," he said. "I think peo
ple gravitate to Romney because
he's more moderate than Gingrich
or Santorum."
