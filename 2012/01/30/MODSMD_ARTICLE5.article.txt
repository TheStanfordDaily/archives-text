## Stanford officials reflect on NYC proposal 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This is the first in a series of articles by
The Daily News Staff exploring Stan
ford's bid and subsequent withdrawal
from the competition for an applied sci
ences and engineering campus in New
York City. The next article will weigh
the costs and gains of Stanford's partic
ipation in the competition.

Stanford withdrew its bid for a New
York applied sciences and engineering
campus because the city repeatedly re
vised the terms of its offer and could
not be trusted as a reliable partner, said

Stanford administrators, responding to
media reports that Stanford was not
adequately prepared for the tough ne
gotiation style of New York officials.
Stanford's sudden withdrawal on
Dec. f 6 surprised many, as the Univer
sity was considered a frontrunner in
the competition. The University press
release announced that Stanford had
decided, "it would not be in the best in
terests of the University to continue to
pursue the opportunity," but did not
provide any details or explanation.
Cornell, Stanford's main competi
tor and the ultimate competition win
ner, announced a $350 million gift
hours after Stanford's withdrawal,

prompting speculations that Stanford
had pulled out after hearing about
Cornell's donation in advance, an alle
gation that Stanford administrators
have denied.
Meanwhile, The New York Times
reported that "the University, with no
experience building in New York, re
coiled at meeting terms laid down by
the city after its proposal was submit
ted, while Cornell, with extensive expe
rience in the city its medical school
is in Manhattan expected such ne
gotiations."The New York Times quot

Stanford surprised many when it withdrew its proposal for an applied sciences and engineering campus in New York
City on Dec. 16. The city awarded the opportunity to Cornell University, Stanford's main competitor in the process.
could not or would not keep up."
Up until now, Stanford officials
have not spoken publicly about spe
cific details of the failed negotiations.
Last Thursday, President John
Hennessy discussed his decision with
the Faculty Senate. "The city made a
set of requirements which from our
perspective, would increase the risk
and cost, and decrease some of the
long term benefits," he said. "While
we believed we could win the pro

posal, it would require us to make
concessions which would reduce fu
ture opportunities for the core cam
pus ... and compromise the univer
sity campus."
Officials at both the New York
Mayor's office and the New York
City Economic Development Cor
poration refused to comment on the
negotiation process and whether
they had played a "bait and switch"
game with Stanford.
"All schools were competing on
the same terms and all of the terms
were outlined specifically in the RFP
(Request for Proposal). It's that sim
ple," said one city official, who asked
to remain anonymous and declined

to comment further.
"Nothing about the RFP was
firm," said University spokesperson
Lisa Lapin. "The city was making
changes to all of the terms of the
project."
For instance, Lapin said that the
city required Stanford to proceed
with the project even if the city re
voked the $ 100 million it promised to
the competition winner.
"There were issues about liability
for... the environmental risks in
volved in the site," Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 told The
Daily. "They wanted us to indemnify
them for anything they had done,
anything that had happened. So for

example, if somebody sued about ex
posure to chemicals 20 years ago, we
would have been liable; and that's an
example."
Hennessy added that the city also
backtracked on the amount of land
they had promised. Originally, Stan
ford believed they would be granted
land from shore to shore on Roo
sevelt Island. But New York cut back
the land offer, which meant that
Stanford would have to pay to buy
additional land if they wanted to
build the campus for which they orig
inally planned.
Finally, Hennessy said Stanford
could not see eye to eye with the city
on how quickly the campus could
scale up.
"We would not compromise our
faculty hiring standards," Hennessy
said. "Particularly when many facul
ty already believe they live in Nir
vana ... [that] increased some of the
issues for us in terms of how to scale
up."
Hennessy and the faculty com
mittee resisted the city's push to
ramp up quickly.
"This needs to be one university,
two campuses, not an A campus and
a B campus," Hennessy said. "Clear
ly, a smaller campus but it can't be dif
ferent quality-wise. And that I think
was a real point of differentiation be
tween Stanford and what the city
wanted."
Besides the changing terms of the
RFP, it seems that Stanford was
turned off by the tone of the negotia
tions, which led the University to feel
that it could not work successfully
with the city.
"I think Stanford wanted very
much to do this, if we had a willing
partner in New York City," said Jim
Plummer, dean of the School of En
gineering. "I think that it became
clear as we went through the negoti
ations that it was more of a city talk

ing to a land developer kind of dis
cussion, rather than a partner talking
to a partner."
All together, these aspects made
Stanford feel that success could not
be guaranteed.
"If we could not succeed in
achieving everything that NYC
wanted, then we would have had a
campus 3,000 miles away that would
end up being an albatross around
our neck," Etchemendy said.
In New York, Roosevelt Is
landers said they were shocked to
hear that Stanford was withdrawing.
"Everybody was completely
stunned beyond imagination; the
news flew through the community
like wildfire," said Denise Shull, a
common councilor on Roosevelt Is
land's Residents Association Silicon
Island Subcommittee.
Schull said she was disappointed
that Stanford dropped their bid.
"From my perspective... the is
land was much more in support of
Stanford. They just have a fabulous
reputation. There's just no two ways
about it," she said.
On the other hand,residents have
also welcomed Cornell enthusiasti
cally.
"In reflection, now that Cornell is
going to be here, New York is going
to be able to do it's own thing, rather
that be a satellite to Silicon Valley,"
said Jonathan Kalkin, former direc
tor of the Roosevelt Island Operat
ing Corporation.
At the end of the day, Stanford
maintains that the bid was worth
while, even though the proposal cost
the University $3 million.
"The saying 'nothing ventured,
nothing gained' is most apt," read the
University press release at the time
of Stanford's withdrawal.
