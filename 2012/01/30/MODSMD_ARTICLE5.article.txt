### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This is the first in a series of articles by
The Daily News Staff exploring Stan
ford's bid and subsequent withdrawal
from the competition for an applied sci
ences and engineering campus in New
York City. The next article will weigh
the costs and gains of Stanford's partic
ipation in the competition.

Stanford withdrew its bid for a New
York applied sciences and engineering
campus because the city repeatedly re
vised the terms of its offer and could
not be trusted as a reliable partner, said

Stanford administrators, responding to
media reports that Stanford was not
adequately prepared for the tough ne
gotiation style of New York officials.
Stanford's sudden withdrawal on
Dec. f 6 surprised many, as the Univer
sity was considered a frontrunner in
the competition. The University press
release announced that Stanford had
decided, "it would not be in the best in
terests of the University to continue to
pursue the opportunity," but did not
provide any details or explanation.
Cornell, Stanford's main competi
tor and the ultimate competition win
ner, announced a $350 million gift
hours after Stanford's withdrawal,

prompting speculations that Stanford
had pulled out after hearing about
Cornell's donation in advance, an alle
gation that Stanford administrators
have denied.
Meanwhile, The New York Times
reported that "the University, with no
experience building in New York, re
coiled at meeting terms laid down by
the city after its proposal was submit
ted, while Cornell, with extensive expe
rience in the city its medical school
is in Manhattan expected such ne
gotiations."The New York Times quot
