## Stanford hospital enters NorCal medical alliance 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Hospital & Clinics has
partnered with several Bay Area
medical practices to form the Uni
versity Health Care Alliance
(UHA), a not-for-profit medical
foundation that manages medical
groups.
UHA was founded on Jan. 1,
2011, and is co-sponsored by Stan
ford Hospital & Clinics and the
Stanford University School of

Medicine. According to the medical
foundation model, UHA owns, op
erates and provides staff to medical
clinics in Northern California. It
also contracts with several individ
ual medical groups who employ
physicians and advanced practi
tioners to provide medical care to
patients at UHA clinics.
According to the San Francisco
Business Times, this alliance may
pose "increased competition for
other health systems," including
Kaiser Permanente and Sutter

Health.
"Health care is undergoing
many changes from a regulatory
perspective, making it more impor
tant than ever for doctors and hos
pitals to work together," said
Kanani Quijano, a marketing and
communications specialist for
UHA. "Our mission is to deliver
value to our patients. An affiliation
between SHC and community
physicians enables us to provide co
ordinated preventive, chronic,
acute and long-term care,"

According to Quijano, UHA's
goals include providing "high quali
ty clinical care and continuing to
make significant advances in medi
cine,"
"In action and attitude, the pa
tient will be at the center of every
thing," Quijano added.
The alliance was formed under
the premise that that having multi
ple providers and facilities would
help the customer's experience.
