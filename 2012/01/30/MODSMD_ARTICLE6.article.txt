## Stanford hospital enters NorCal medical alliance 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Hospital & Clinics has
partnered with several Bay Area
medical practices to form the Uni
versity Health Care Alliance
(UHA), a not-for-profit medical
foundation that manages medical
groups.
UHA was founded on Jan. 1,
2011, and is co-sponsored by Stan
ford Hospital & Clinics and the
Stanford University School of

Medicine. According to the medical
foundation model, UHA owns, op
erates and provides staff to medical
clinics in Northern California. It
also contracts with several individ
ual medical groups who employ
physicians and advanced practi
tioners to provide medical care to
patients at UHA clinics.
According to the San Francisco
Business Times, this alliance may
pose "increased competition for
other health systems," including
Kaiser Permanente and Sutter

Health.
"Health care is undergoing
many changes from a regulatory
perspective, making it more impor
tant than ever for doctors and hos
pitals to work together," said
Kanani Quijano, a marketing and
communications specialist for
UHA. "Our mission is to deliver
value to our patients. An affiliation
between SHC and community
physicians enables us to provide co
ordinated preventive, chronic,
acute and long-term care,"

According to Quijano, UHA's
goals include providing "high quali
ty clinical care and continuing to
make significant advances in medi
cine,"
"In action and attitude, the pa
tient will be at the center of every
thing," Quijano added.
The alliance was formed under
the premise that that having multi
ple providers and facilities would
help the customer's experience.
"Our team is a diverse group of
people with a wealth of skills and ex
periences, joined together by a
shared set of values," Quijano said.
"We value our patients and take
pride in ensuring they are provided
with compassionate care and serv
ice. We put the patient first in all we
do and always remember that caring
for the individual patient and their
family is at the heart of our mission
and philosophy. Through the collec
tive and coordinated efforts of our
team, we apply our diverse experi
ence to benefit patients."
Currently, the medical founda
tion includes multi-specialty med
ical practices with over 110 physi
cians and 15 advanced practitioners.
UHA has 10 locations, with two clin
ics in Menlo Park and others in Hay
ward, Castro Valley, Danville,
Pleasanton, San Jose, San Pablo,
Alameda and Pinole,
The Bay Valley Medical Group
(BMVG) partnered with UHA last
year in October, representing over
350 physicians that provide primary
and specialty medical care, with 27
physicians and four office locations
in the East Bay.
According to the Bay Valley
Medical Group News website, "The
affiliation of UHA and BVMG
helps both partners flourish in the
complex, increasingly competitive
and rapidly changing health care en
vironment. It will strengthen
BVMG's ability to adapt to local, re

gional and national forces while en
hancing growth and supporting the
community-based service model
here in the East Bay."
BMVG notes that, although the
affiliation will not impact its avail
ability to take care of its patients, and
that individuals and families can
continue to see the physicians they
have been seeing, patients may ob
serve changes in the management
support because "UHA brings new
information technology."
This includes the addition of an
electronic health record and more
online communication tools for
BMVG.
UHA expects that the Affinity
Medical Group (AMP) will join the
alliance later this year in February.
AMP includes more than 25 physi
cians, and is a growing multi-special
ty group comprised of AMP itself)
Alameda Pediatrics Associates and
other groups in the East Bay.
UHA's Board of Directors in
cludes members of Stanford Hospi
tal & Clinics, the Stanford School of
Medicine and community members
and physicians. Stanford Hospital &
Clinics Vice President of Network
Development Bruce Harrison
serves as chief administrative officer
for the alliance.
"We believe that by fostering
more cohesive working relation
ships between high quality commu
nity physicians and SHC, we can ul
timately enhance customer value
for patients and their families, and
improve clinical practice across a
broader enterprise," Quijano said.
