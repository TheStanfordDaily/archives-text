## Research examines tobacco ads 
### ROB FRANKLIN 
A recent School of Medicine
study chronicles the intricate ad
vertising campaign crafted by
cigarette companies using doc
tors' endorsements to promote
their products as healthful, start
ing in the 1920s and continuing
for half a century.
Senior author Robert Jack
ler, professor of otolaryngology,
called the advertisements uncov
ered by the study "outrageous."
"Tobacco science used pseu
doscientific experiments to ar
rive at a preordained conclu
sion," he said.
The advertisements used en
dorsements by celebrities
Mickey Mantle for Viceroys,
John Wayne for Camels and
even Santa Claus for Marlboro
and Lucky and throat doctors
to validate their claims.
"At that time, people weren't
so concerned about lung can
cer," Jackler said. "People were
concerned about throat irrita
tion. So throat doctors would en
dorse their products."
Memos from companies such
as Philip Morris reveal that to
bacco companies recruited doc
tors from Columbia University
and the University of Pennsylva
nia to promote their product.
They also used slogans such as
Lucky Strike's, "the Finest Fla
vor and protects the throat," and
Old Gold's, "ask your dentist
why Old Golds are better for the
teeth."
The study, published in the
January issue of The Laryngo
scope, also determined that
physicians were paid about
$ll,OOO annually, making an ad
ditional $5,000 in endorsements
a substantial incentive to comply
with industry rhetoric. In addi
tion, companies funded extrava
gant dinners for those throat
doctors willing to comply.
"Not only would [doctors]
recommend smoking, they actu
ally prescribed cigarettes, saying
smoke this brand because
they're better for your throat,"
Jackler said.
The Journal of the American
Medical Association stopped pub
lishing tobacco advertisements in
1953, but "a number of state and
local medical journals continued
advertising cigarettes into the late
19605," wrote Robert Proctor, pro
fessor of history, in an email to The
Daily.
Proctor, who teaches a class ti
tled, "Global Tobacco Science and
Shenanigans," also noted that de
spite changes in legislation prevent

ing historical marketing techniques,
tobacco companies continue to ad
vertise their product as "sexy, glam
orous, adventurous, liberating and
fun."
"You don't see unattractive or
overweight people in tobacco ads,
do you?" Proctor asked. "The fact is
that Americans still smoke about
350 billion cigarettes every year,
enough to circle the globe some 800
times."
The study was conducted as a
part of Stanford Research into the
Impact of Tobacco Advertising,
with additional funding from the
department of otolaryngology.
