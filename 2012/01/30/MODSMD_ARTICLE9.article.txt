£ £ ~w" can see it's
f kind of funky
and disorgan
ized, but I kind of
know where
things are," said Kenneth Fields
Ph.D. '67, a longtime professor of
English and creative writing.
"Once in a while, I discover some
thing I'd forgotten about."
The room features a rustic
looking armchair, an oft-used
couch and a desk stacked with
knick knacks in charming disar
ray. There are books everywhere:
on shelves, on the desk, on the
floor. In fact, the floor space is

nearly non-existent, which makes
the room both look and feel even
more chaotic. Also present are
Fields' energetic miniature Aus
tralian shepherds, Dot and Jinx,
compounding the room's mis
matched aura of homeliness and
anarchy.
The eccentric and cluttered na
ture of Fields's office he claims
there is a trumpet stashed some
where in the room, as well as an
Australian Aboriginal didgeridoo
mirrors his unique upbringing
and education, which inspires
much of his writing.
Fields was born to a pair of
farmers in Texas. He had a twin
brother who died when they were

only a day old.
"He's buried in this little coun
try cemetery in Texas, [and] I've
been back there a couple of times,"
he said. "It turned out that that had
something to do with my psycholo
gy as it comes through in my
poems."
Fields moved to California as a
young boy, and after finishing high
school, he attended UC-Santa
Barbara.
"I went there with no particular
interests," Fields said. "I wanted to
play football; I didn't think very far
along the line like could I be
playing this when I was 70 or some
thing."
It was at UCSB that Fields
found his two main passions in life,
reading and writing, through the
people he encountered.
These individuals included
Homer Swander, a "wonderful"
professor of Shakespeare, as well
as Edgar Bowers M.A. '49, Ph.D.
'53, a poet who studied at Stanford
under the famous critic Yvor Win
ters. Through the encouragement
of these mentors, Fields decided
that he wanted to study English at
Stanford.

After two years in the Army as
part of his involvement with Re
serve Officers' Training Corps
(ROTC), Fields finally moved to
the Farm, where he has remained
for 45 years, first as a graduate stu
dent, then as a professor and poet.
"There were lots of people
around who were interested in
writing, and I guess I just stayed
with it," Fields said. "I thought I
was good at it, and it's what I loved
doing."
Fields has numerous books of
poetry, including a collection of
blank verse sonnets entitled "Clas
sic Rough News." Now, Fields is
working on a novel, tentatively
called "Father of Mercies."
"I essentially consider myself a
poet," he said. "Flow I got into the
novel, I don't know probably
half of the English professors in
the world have a secret novel in
their desk drawers."
With this breezy spirit as a
writer, one might argue it follows
that Fields appreciates improvisa
tion as an important aspect of writ
ing. In fact, improvisation is a big
part of one of Fields's other hob
bies: photography.

"I love the sense of shooting
from the hip and seeing what the
camera sees as an artist," he said.
At the same time, Fields's
image of himself as a writer has
never been clear-cut, he said, and
his encounters and relationships
with a wide variety of individuals
during his long tenure at Stanford
have affected his perspective.
"Lots of different people have
come and gone," Fields said. "Just
being around other writers, the
combination of younger writers
coming in as fellows and my col
leagues, has had a big effect on how
I think of myself as a writer."
The most important time to
Fields, however, was his years in
college that sparked and nurtured
his still-developing passion for
writing. Fie holds that teachers
need to model the excitement they
have for their disciplines so that
students can truly become en
thralled by their experiences in the
classroom, as he once was.
"The key is to look for some
thing that moves you," he said.
