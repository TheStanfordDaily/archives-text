## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR Editor's Farewell: From service to self-discovery 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI Editor in chief President, Vol. CCXXXX 
As a student journalist, I
have found that it can be
extremely gratifying to
receive individual feedback from
readers. There is one email I re
ceived during my freshman year
which stands out clearly in my
mind. To me, it signifies the time
at which I began seriously consid
ering journalism in the context of
public service.
In the third article I published
in The Daily, I wrote about Stan
ford students coping with a se
ries of suicides of Gunn High
School students. After some
time, local school administrators
and psychologists collectively
chose to stonewall media. A
week after unsuccessfully trying
to reach those sources, this arti
cle emerged when Gunn gradu
ates told me about close-knit
communities which were begin
ning to form on the Stanford
campus to promote healing after
the deaths.

The day my story published, a
University librarian wrote in an
email to me that he felt the story
conveyed a human perspective
on a topic that is often shrouded
in silence or reduced to statistics.
He described his hope that with
more awareness of mental
health, the community might
promote successful change. This
was the first time I saw the poten
tial for my reporting to serve as a
platform for social change. The
response was an affirmation of
the purpose I found in gaining
sources' trust to discuss issues
that mattered. It helped reaffirm
my passion for understanding
the world through words.
During this 2011-12 academic
year, our campus has grappled
with questions of what it means
for Stanford and for individuals
of this community to meaning
fully serve society. The proposed
New York City applied sciences
campus represented a possibility
for the University to serve our
nation with a new source of cut
ting-edge research and innova
tion. The Occupy movement
probed the implications of our
career choices and reinforced
our responsibility to challenge
social inequalities. Develop
ments in Internet legislation

prompted a closer examination
of the right to access informa
tion, as well as citizens' stake in
its future.

During the past seven months
of this volume of The Daily, I
have attempted to embrace the
concept of service to the commu
nity, which has been a such a
defining feature of campus news.
In doing so through story
telling and through listening
my curiosity and fascination with
the human experience has grown
exponentially.

A Stanford advisor once told
me that the Farm is a place to
learn about the parts of you that
you did not know existed. Writ
ing narratives of students' grief
and reflections was the begin
ning of my own experience of
growth and self-discovery at
The Daily and at Stanford.
It is my sincere hope that
The Daily can offer the same
opportunities for service and
self-discovery to any of the un
dergraduate and graduate stu
dents on our campus who have
an interest in trying out student

journalism.
Readers and community
members also play a critical, di
rect role in our publication by
sending The Daily news tips,
op-eds and letters to the editor. I
hope that you continue to engage
with content through this dia
logue, as well as through contact
with our reporters.
I would like to thank you, the
reader, for picking up The Daily
in the dining hall and chatting
about its pages with friends. I am
also grateful to our own staff and
Board of Directors.

I have great confidence in our
rising leadership at The Daily,
and I wish the staff of Vol.
CCXXXXI the best of luck in
directing Stanford's largest
independent news source, which
has published a record of this
community for 122 years. Your
commitment and care astound
me.
With many thanks.
