# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## Lost in articulation 
### Nina Chung 
£ £ | "v ut, what, specifically,
I—£ do you want to do?"
1 -J the high-ranking exec
utive of Fox Searchlight Pictures
asked me over the phone.
"Ah, well, yeah, that's a really
good question ... As I men
tioned, I have that broad, abstract
idea of what I'd like to be doing,
but I suppose, I guess, the issue is
what that looks like realistically
in, well, an actual job title," I total
ly sputtered.
"... Nina. You need to do
your homework get on
Google, and do your homework.
No one's giving you a job if you
don't even know what job you
want."
And that is a concise summary
of a 15-minute conversation I had
on a planter in the quad with a
woman who got straight to the
point about the fact that I wasn't
getting the point. It was a reality
check treatment I hadn't yet had
the honor of experiencing from
anyone else I had spoken to about
post-grad work. By the end of that
call, my only remaining thought
was to thank her for her time (she
had to "be at a meeting now") and
for being so direct (I decided
against "cutthroat") with advice.
But then, after we hung up, my
lasting realization was how diffi
cult it had been to articulate my
self, even when I thought I knew
how. I hadn't realized how lost I
was.

Fumbling over words is, gener
ally, not enjoyable. At a place like
Stanford, where rhetoric skills are
acknowledged as necessary and
thus require two quarters of train

ing, most of us take for granted
that smooth speech equates with
intelligence. We are aware that
being able to explain something
well often means knowing it well,
too.

Now, if we take the above and
stick it in a discussion section
even here at Stanford what do
you get? You get professors who
say the following:
"I don't get these kids. I know
they can talk they start bab
bling as soon as class is over. But
in class, they're completely silent.
They must be smart, but this is
ridiculous."
That's a comment I overheard
last year in the Department of
History, where discussion sections
are common. And we are those
kids. Obviously no single section
can fully characterize a student,
since we all attend classes that we
personally find utterly fascinating
or downright dozy. But I know
that in many, there are students
who have something to say but are
furiously editing it in their heads
lest it accidentally exit in run-on
form and make them feel "stu
pid." We hold a pervasive fear of
that feeling especially on the
stage we often make section out
to be. So ideas don't get to inter
act, and nothing gets figured out.
Other times, we are the willing
center of attention and take
charge in a conversation or a heat
ed debate. Unexpectedly, I've
found that this is the birthplace of
so many little lies at the mo
ment we realize we're on a charis
matic roll, and "I'm not sure" or "I
don't know" would interrupt it.

There seems to exist a tiny junc
ture in most energetic talks, per
haps most often with acquain
tances, where we decide whether
to hesitate honestly over our
opinion, or move right along with
something easy and plain oF un
true. And we may feel a twinge of
inward embarrassment afterward
but it fades, right? Ultimately,
this habit emphasizes how much
we value the image of coherency,
even at the expense of truth.
But through a volume's worth
of writing this column and talking
about confusing questions with
confused people (including me,
you and maybe someone else),
I'm consistently reminded of why
conversations are great (There
are many reasons: 1. You can have
one over coffee. 2. You can have
one over tea. 3. The other person
is awesome.) One of the reasons is
that it forces us to construct some
thing legitimate out of a mental
mess. Communication is ambi
tious it demands to be under
stood.
Instantaneously, right as our
words roll off of our tongues, we
feel if they fumble. When we con
fuse ourselves, when we get
tongue-tied, when we can't make

logical sense of our own senti
ments we know. When our
thoughts go public, we see them
for what they are, and sometimes
they're fine, and sometimes they
fail.

But wait is it "failure," real
ly? Is being lost for words or hesita
tion or thinking silence really so
painful? Or are we finally giving
our crazy, potentially damaging
thoughts a chance to get fine
tuned, probably with the help of

someone else, too? Sometimes we
need to hear our inner nonsense
out in the air before we ever realize
it was unnecessary nonsense at all.
Not everything has to be
shared, of course. But, sometimes,
it's in the struggle to articulate
ourselves that we see ourselves in
real terms. And for that, I think
we first have to know how com
pletely, hopelessly lost we are be
fore anything can be found at all.

Nina likes to talk it out, and hope
fully you've gotten the non-subtle,
weekly hint that she wants to talk to
you, too. She's asking for your
thoughts. So email her at ninamc@

mess. Communication is ambi
tious it demands to be under
stood.
Instantaneously, right as our
words roll off of our tongues, we
feel if they fumble. When we con
fuse ourselves, when we get
tongue-tied, when we can't make

logical sense of our own senti
ments we know. When our
thoughts go public, we see them
for what they are, and sometimes
they're fine, and sometimes they
fail.

But wait is it "failure," real
ly? Is being lost for words or hesita
tion or thinking silence really so
painful? Or are we finally giving
our crazy, potentially damaging
thoughts a chance to get fine
tuned, probably with the help of

someone else, too? Sometimes we
need to hear our inner nonsense
out in the air before we ever realize
it was unnecessary nonsense at all.
Not everything has to be
shared, of course. But, sometimes,
it's in the struggle to articulate
ourselves that we see ourselves in
real terms. And for that, I think
we first have to know how com
pletely, hopelessly lost we are be
fore anything can be found at all.

1 -J the high-ranking exec
utive of Fox Searchlight Pictures
asked me over the phone.
"Ah, well, yeah, that's a really
good question ... As I men
tioned, I have that broad, abstract
idea of what I'd like to be doing,
but I suppose, I guess, the issue is
what that looks like realistically
in, well, an actual job title," I total
ly sputtered.
"... Nina. You need to do
your homework get on
Google, and do your homework.
No one's giving you a job if you
don't even know what job you
want."
And that is a concise summary
of a 15-minute conversation I had
on a planter in the quad with a
woman who got straight to the
point about the fact that I wasn't
getting the point. It was a reality
check treatment I hadn't yet had
the honor of experiencing from
anyone else I had spoken to about
post-grad work. By the end of that
call, my only remaining thought
was to thank her for her time (she
had to "be at a meeting now") and
for being so direct (I decided
against "cutthroat") with advice.
But then, after we hung up, my
lasting realization was how diffi
cult it had been to articulate my
self, even when I thought I knew
how. I hadn't realized how lost I
was.

Fumbling over words is, gener
ally, not enjoyable. At a place like
Stanford, where rhetoric skills are
acknowledged as necessary and
thus require two quarters of train

ing, most of us take for granted
that smooth speech equates with
intelligence. We are aware that
being able to explain something
well often means knowing it well,
too.

Now, if we take the above and
stick it in a discussion section
even here at Stanford what do
you get? You get professors who
say the following:
"I don't get these kids. I know
they can talk they start bab
bling as soon as class is over. But
in class, they're completely silent.
They must be smart, but this is
ridiculous."
That's a comment I overheard
last year in the Department of
History, where discussion sections
are common. And we are those
kids. Obviously no single section
can fully characterize a student,
since we all attend classes that we
personally find utterly fascinating
or downright dozy. But I know
that in many, there are students
who have something to say but are
furiously editing it in their heads
lest it accidentally exit in run-on
form and make them feel "stu
pid." We hold a pervasive fear of
that feeling especially on the
stage we often make section out
to be. So ideas don't get to inter
act, and nothing gets figured out.
Other times, we are the willing
center of attention and take
charge in a conversation or a heat
ed debate. Unexpectedly, I've
found that this is the birthplace of
so many little lies at the mo
ment we realize we're on a charis
matic roll, and "I'm not sure" or "I
don't know" would interrupt it.

There seems to exist a tiny junc
ture in most energetic talks, per
haps most often with acquain
tances, where we decide whether
to hesitate honestly over our
opinion, or move right along with
something easy and plain oF un
true. And we may feel a twinge of
inward embarrassment afterward
but it fades, right? Ultimately,
this habit emphasizes how much
we value the image of coherency,
even at the expense of truth.
But through a volume's worth
of writing this column and talking
about confusing questions with
confused people (including me,
you and maybe someone else),
I'm consistently reminded of why
conversations are great (There
are many reasons: 1. You can have
one over coffee. 2. You can have
one over tea. 3. The other person
is awesome.) One of the reasons is
that it forces us to construct some
thing legitimate out of a mental
mess. Communication is ambi
