# I'M DONE WITH MY LIFE
## What do you want to do with the rest of your life? 
### Camira Powell 
Okay, time's up! Got an an
swer? Well, if you do, then
you're doing much better
than I am, because I have no idea.
Figuring out what I want to do
with my life is like trying to make
out what's playing on my grand
ma's old antenna television dur
ing a blackout; it's very fuzzy and
constantly changing. Since I find it
almost impossible to answer this
question, I tend to avoid thinking
about it. However, as I climb the
ranks of upperclassmen-hood,
that gets harder to do, since every
one wants to know what I have
planned for the future.
As I said before, I do everything
humanely possible to not dwell on
the fact that I have no clue what
I'm going to do in life, but every
once in a while the question creeps
up on me, and I'm stuck struggling
to find a suitable response. It start
ed off with a meeting with John
Prendergast. If you don't know
who this man is, you must Google
him right now. I'm serious. Stop
reading and look up all the re
markable stuff he's done ... fin
ished? Good. Isn't he impressive?
As the co-founder of the Enough
Project, he completely reinvents
the concept of human rights ac
tivism, partnering with celebrities
to bring attention to atrocities hap
pening in African countries like
the Congo. He's just one of the
coolest guys ever. How do I know
this? Because I had the fortune of
not just meeting him, but actually
having a conversation with him
about life, social service and Ryan
Gosling (apparently the two are
about to write a book together.)
During my little talk with John
(yeah, we're on a first-name basis),

he asked me that question. I
paused, feeling like any answer
would seem inadequate in the eyes
of a man who managed to help end
the war between Ethiopia and Er
itrea. Eventually I said that one of
my many goals is to work in for
eign countries reporting on issues
surrounding women and children.
However, that answer really didn't
feel like it encapsulated my true
calling in life.
Being the quick-witted girl I
am, I turned the question back on
John, asking how he figured out
what he wanted to do with his life.
He laughed and told me that when
he was younger he was just as lost
as I was. He continued by saying it
was a time-tested clich that got
him to where he is now; he fol
lowed his passion. At this point, I
just nodded my head and went "uh
huh" like that made perfect sense,
but all the while I was thinking,
what do you do if you don't know
what your "passion" is? Thankful
ly, he broke it down for me further
by saying he just did things that
made him happy. In his younger
years, he didn't always make sense
to his friends and family, and he
didn't always make the smartest
decisions, but he did what felt right.
He had some ups and downs, some
twists and turns, but now John's
doing exactly what he wants to be
doing and making a huge differ
ence in thousands of lives.

Thus, I started to think about
what makes me happy. There's a
lot to choose from (eating and
sleeping are at the top of the list),
but honestly ... I love making
people feel great. I know it's
cheesy, but I thoroughly enjoy giv
ing pep talks. I'm not gonna lie, I
think no, I know I'm pretty
fly. Therefore, I think it's crucial
that everyone around me feels
just as fly as me. When it comes to
helping someone else, I have (al
most) no shame. My friends make

fun of me all the time for saying
some pretty outlandish things to
make them see themselves the
way I see do.
After John finished telling me
about his incredible life, he en
couraged me to do what he did.
Not so much saving African ba
bies (though I totally would), but
more like doing whatever rocks
my world. When I mentioned this
nifty column, he implored me to
use this space to write about
things that matter to me. He

helped me realize that there are
so many ways that I can make a
positive impact, and this can be
one of them.
If I've made you laugh, made
you think or made you smile then
I've done my job, and that makes
me feel amazing.
Hmmm, maybe I do have a
passion after all.
