## KORDIC LEADS COMEBACK 
### DANIEL LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's volleyball team
headed to the Midwest over the weekend to
take on a pair of powers: No. 8 Penn State in a
rematch of the 2010 national championship
match and No. 10 Ohio State in a matchup of
the past two national champions. The Cardi
nal came away with a split in the third and
fourth matches of its 10-match road stretch,
falling to Penn State (3-1) in four sets (26-24,
16-25, 25-17, 25-17) before defeating Ohio
State (6-4) in five sets (25-22,23-25,24-26,25-
22,15-12).
For the Cardinal (5-2), the Penn State
match was a tale of two halves. During the
first two sets, the Cardinal went toe-to-toe
with the Nittany Lions, even dominating
Penn State at times. The second two were a
different story, despite strong nights from
senior outside hitter Brad Lawson (12 kills),
sophomore outside hitter Steven Irvin (10
kills) and senior middle blocker Gus Ellis
(seven kills on seven attempts).

Stanford came out ready to prove to
Penn State that the rematch would be no
different than the last meeting between
these two teams, jumping out to a 10-5 lead
in the first set. However, the Nittany Lions
countered with a 7-2 run of their own to
even the score at 12.The rest of the set was a
back-and-forth affair, with the Cardinal
even gaining a set point at 24-23. However,
Penn State senior outside hitter Joe Sunder
came up huge with consecutive kills, and the
Nittany Lions closed out the Cardinal on a
block by middle blocker Nick Turko and op
posite Tom Comfort.

The second set went decidedly in Stan
ford's favor. The Cardinal again raced out to
a 10-5 lead, mostly thanks to some sloppy
serving by Penn State. This time, the Cardinal
did not give the lead get away, never letting
Penn State get any closer than four points.
Due to some good adjustments by Penn
State, the Cardinal was not able to maintain
the same level of play during the last two sets,
falling behind early in the third and giving up
a 15-7 run to end it in the fourth.

"This year's match against Penn State cer
tainly conjured up memories of our champi
onship match. We had equally high expecta
tions, but unfortunately didn't play up to our
potential," Lawson said. "I thought our com
munication and determination in general
were lacking on Friday night, but it was en
couraging to see us turn it around against
Ohio State on Saturday."

Turn it around they did. While the story on
Friday night may have been a lack of energy,
there was certainly no shortage of that on Sat
urday, thanks in large part to setter Dylan Ko

rdic. The senior, who had played just five ca
reer matches before Saturday night's contest,
came up with a clutch 23-assist performance
after relieving an injured Evan Barry in the
third set, rallying the Cardinal to fourth- and
fifth-set victories.

As good as he was, he certainly did not do
it alone. Lawson, Irvin and sophomore out
side hitter Brian Cook each shared the team

lead in kills with 17, sophomore middle block
er Eric Mochalski turned in a typically effi
cient performance with 11 kills on 17 at
tempts for a .529 hitting percentage and sen
ior libero Erik Shoji led the defensive effort
with a season-high 16 digs.
Stanford was able to win the first set, never

trailing after evening the score at
two points apiece. Both squads
hurt themselves with six service
errors each during the set, though
Stanford finally closed out the
Buckeyes, 25-22, on an Ellis kill.
During the second set, the
Buckeyes were able to keep the
Cardinal at bay after using a 7-2
run to take a 13-9 lead, from
which they never looked back.
Stanford was able to battle back,
erasing two set points to draw
within one after consecutive kills
from Irvin and Lawson, but was
done in on the next point.

Kordic would enter center
stage for Barry in the third with
Stanford trailing 20-17, promptly
rallying the Cardinal to a tie at 24

after a kill by Cook. Stanford was
not able to finish the job at hand,
however, as Ohio State closed out
the set on consecutive kills by
senior opposite Shawn Sangrey.
The Cardinal, thanks to Ko
rdic and Irvin, would win the
back-and-forth affair in the final
two sets, using a 10-4 run to deci
sively close out the match.

Kordic thanked his teammates
for his success during the match, a
trend not uncommon among this
close group. "We were successful
because the guys stepped up big,"
he said. "Semi-jokingly, I told
them they really needed to help
me out by passing perfectly and
hitting bad sets. But that's exactly
what they did."

The Cardinal is back on the
road this weekend, taking on
BYU on back-to-back nights.
