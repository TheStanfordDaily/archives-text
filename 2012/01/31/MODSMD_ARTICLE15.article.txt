# CARDINAL FIAT ON ITS BACK
## 
### PALANI ESWARAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 20 Stanford wrestling team dropped
a close 22-14 dual to No. 13 Oregon State in
Maples Pavilion on Sunday. With the win, the
Beavers will now likely take the Pac-12 regular
season title.

Stanford (8-6,3-1 Pac-12) wrestled well, but
Oregon State (9-2, 4-0) was too much for the
Cardinal. Five Beaver wrestlers came into the
dual ranked in the top 25, and all five won
matches. The winning wrestlers for the Cardinal
were junior No. 8 Ryan Mango at 125 pounds,
redshirt sophomore Bret Baumbach at 165
pounds, redshirt senior No. 1 Nick
Amuchastegui at 174 pounds and redshirt jun

ior Spence Patrick at 184 pounds.
Baumbach looked very good on his feet. His
single leg was working well, and he reacted well
to his opponent with good defense and re-shots.
What was most impressive about the match was
that Oregon State's Joe Latham kept electing to
go neutral, and Baumbach kept taking him
down; he beat Latham at his own game.
With Sunday's win, Mango improved to 23-5
overall and 14-0 in duals. He looked very im
pressive on his feet, taking good shots, quickly
converting them into throws and earning near
fall points. Sunday marked the first time this
year that Mango has wrestled 125 pounds. Last
season he was an All-American at 125, but this
season he has wrestled exclusively at 133
pounds. It will be interesting to see how this
transition goes.

Amuchastegui once again looked dominant.
On his feet, he got extremely deep on every
shot, not giving his opponent any room to

breathe. And on top, the top
ranked 174-pounder in the nation
looked unstoppable, punishing
Oregon State's Cody Weishoff
with a deadly turk.
Amuchastegui's technical fall was
the only non-minor decision for
the Card on Sunday. He is now 16-
0 overall and 13-0 in dual meets.

But the most exciting match of
the day was definitely Patrick's.
Patrick entered the third period
trailing the Beavers' Ty Vinson 2-
0 (effectively 3-0 with Vinson's
riding time). Through the first two
periods, it didn't seem like
Patrick's match he wasn't
doing much on his feet and could
n't find away to counter Vinson
putting in legs on top. But in the
third period, Patrick took his op
ponent down, let him up and took
him down again to tie the match
and force overtime. At that point,
it was clear that his opponent's
will was broken, and Patrick se
cured a takedown within the first
10 seconds of the sudden death
period to lock up the win.

Patrick is now 15-9 overall and
11-3 in duals. He has looked very
impressive lately, and this match
shows how much determination
he has.

Another Stanford wrestler

who wrestled extremely well was
sophomore heavyweight Dan
Scherer. Although he lost, he put
up a good fight and showed
toughness. Scherer wrestled No. 5
Clayton Jack, and when the two
wrestlers stepped onto the mat,
everyone could see that Scherer
had a 50-pound disadvantage.
Despite the large size discrepan
cy, Scherer entered the third peri
od up 1-0. But Jack secured a re
versal to go up 2-1 and used his
weight to prevent Scherer from
escaping and tying the match.
Scherer is now 18-9 overall and
11-3 in duals.

Despite four good individual
wins, the team still lost. In all of
Stanford's six losses, the Cardinal
was dominated on the mat. When
Oregon State was in top position,
the Stanford wrestlers rarely es
caped, and the scoreboard often
showed riding time in favor of the
Beavers.

But a loss to Oregon State
should not make any of the
wrestlers hang their heads. Ore
gon State has multiple ranked
wrestlers, and Stanford needs to
stay positive moving forward to
the home stretch of the season.
There are only a few duals and
one tournament left before the
Pac-12 Tournament.

Stanford wrestles Cal Poly and
Utah Valley at home on Friday.
