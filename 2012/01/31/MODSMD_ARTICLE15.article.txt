# CARDINAL FIAT ON ITS BACK

### PALANI ESWARAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 20 Stanford wrestling team dropped
a close 22-14 dual to No. 13 Oregon State in
Maples Pavilion on Sunday. With the win, the
Beavers will now likely take the Pac-12 regular
season title.

Stanford (8-6,3-1 Pac-12) wrestled well, but
Oregon State (9-2, 4-0) was too much for the
Cardinal. Five Beaver wrestlers came into the
dual ranked in the top 25, and all five won
matches. The winning wrestlers for the Cardinal
were junior No. 8 Ryan Mango at 125 pounds,
redshirt sophomore Bret Baumbach at 165
pounds, redshirt senior No. 1 Nick
Amuchastegui at 174 pounds and redshirt jun

ior Spence Patrick at 184 pounds.
Baumbach looked very good on his feet. His
single leg was working well, and he reacted well
to his opponent with good defense and re-shots.
What was most impressive about the match was
that Oregon State's Joe Latham kept electing to
go neutral, and Baumbach kept taking him
down; he beat Latham at his own game.
With Sunday's win, Mango improved to 23-5
overall and 14-0 in duals. He looked very im
pressive on his feet, taking good shots, quickly
converting them into throws and earning near
fall points. Sunday marked the first time this
year that Mango has wrestled 125 pounds. Last
season he was an All-American at 125, but this
season he has wrestled exclusively at 133
pounds. It will be interesting to see how this
transition goes.

Amuchastegui once again looked dominant.
On his feet, he got extremely deep on every
shot, not giving his opponent any room to
