Traveling for the first time this sea
son, the Stanford women's gymnastics
team suffered its first loss against the
No. 10 Oregon State Beavers on Friday.
Oregon State, the defending Pac-10
champions, pulled out a 196.800-194.525
win over the No. 12 Cardinal, extending
its winning streak over the Cardinal to
three, including meets last season.

Starting on the uneven bars, Stan
ford scored a 48.875, led by a pair of
9.850's by junior Ashley Morgan and
sophomore Shona Morgan. But Oregon
State put up a season-high 48.975 to
gain a one-tenth lead going into the sec
ond round.
The Cardinal put up a 48.950 on
vault in the second round, highlighted
by a 9.900 by junior Nicole Dayton, who
was making a return from injury after
missing last week's meet against Wash
ington.
"Having Nicole Dayton back in the
lineup was huge. She anchors our vault
and leads off on bars and floor. It was
great to have her stability in the lineup,"
said head coach Kristen Smyth.
Ashley Morgan scored an impres
sive 9.850 to add on, but the Beavers
were still able to extend their lead to
98.225-97.825, thanks in part to a 9.875
by Leslie Mak, defending Pac-10 Gym
nast of the Year, on the bars.

Ashley Morgan posted another
9.850 on the floor, her third 9.850 on the

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
