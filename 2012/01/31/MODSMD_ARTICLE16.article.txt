## Gymnasts split matches over the weekend Men beat cal, women fall 
### CONNOR SCHERER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Traveling for the first time this sea
son, the Stanford women's gymnastics
team suffered its first loss against the
No. 10 Oregon State Beavers on Friday.
Oregon State, the defending Pac-10
champions, pulled out a 196.800-194.525
win over the No. 12 Cardinal, extending
its winning streak over the Cardinal to
three, including meets last season.

Starting on the uneven bars, Stan
ford scored a 48.875, led by a pair of
9.850's by junior Ashley Morgan and
sophomore Shona Morgan. But Oregon
State put up a season-high 48.975 to
gain a one-tenth lead going into the sec
ond round.
The Cardinal put up a 48.950 on
vault in the second round, highlighted
by a 9.900 by junior Nicole Dayton, who
was making a return from injury after
missing last week's meet against Wash
ington.
"Having Nicole Dayton back in the
lineup was huge. She anchors our vault
and leads off on bars and floor. It was
great to have her stability in the lineup,"
said head coach Kristen Smyth.
Ashley Morgan scored an impres
sive 9.850 to add on, but the Beavers
were still able to extend their lead to
98.225-97.825, thanks in part to a 9.875
by Leslie Mak, defending Pac-10 Gym
nast of the Year, on the bars.

day, to help the Cardinal post a
team score of 48.750. But, as was a
common trend throughout the
meet, the Beavers were just a little
bit better, as they extended their
lead to 0.900 going into the fourth
and final round. It would take a
very strong round on the beam for
Stanford to overcome the deficit in
the last round.
However, the Cardinal was un
able to put together its best round
on the beam, scoring just a 47.950,
its worst score in an event all sea
son. The team struggled on the
beam, falling three times through
out the event.
"Obviously I didn't prepare the
team on the balance beam well
enough. We're going to have to
have a lot more repetitions and a
lot more numbers," Smyth said.
She added that "there's no greater
pressure than that type of atmos
phere," but that the team should
be able to handle, and be excited
for, that kind of moment.
Senior Alyssa Brown was able
to put up Stanford's season-high
score of 9.925 on the beam. Smyth,
however, was not surprised by
Brown's performance: "Alyssa,
you expect that from our senior
leader. That's who she is."
Stanford will continue its five
game Pac-12 road streak on Sun
day at UCLA.
Men's Gymnastics
Facing California for the third
time in a row to start its season, the
No. 6 Stanford men's gymnastics
team looked to take control of the
season series Saturday night in the
Stanford Open. The Cardinal lost
to the Bears by 6.100 points at
Berkeley to open its season, but
was able to come away with a
4.750-point victory last Saturday
at Burnham Pavilion to tie the
season series. Thus, Saturday's
meet against No. 5 Cal, No. 9 Ne
braska and Washington was an
important one to establish the
Cardinal as the team to fear in the
Pac-12.
Stanford was able to do just
that, as it came away with a total
team score of 348.400, its highest
score of the season, to beat Cal
(339.000), Nebraska (332.600) and
Washington (251.200) and im
prove its record to 4-1. The Cardi
nal never trailed throughout the
entire match.
Key to Stanford's sweep was
junior Eddie Penev, who was the
all-around winner of the meet for

the third time in a row to open the
season. While many considered
his performance in last week's
meet to be the best of his career,
Penev bettered that with a career
high 89.200 on Sunday, including
personal-best scores in floor exer
cise (16.200), still rings (14.500)
and parallel bars (15.000).
The Cardinal's lack of depth,
one of the main reasons cited by
the coaching staff after the loss at
Berkeley, did not appear to affect
Stanford much in Saturday's
meet. Prior to the match, head
coach Thorn Glielmi claimed that
the team was able to handle the
extra pressure associated with this
lack of depth, and his gymnasts
agreed. While Penev mentioned
that there was definitely added
pressure, he went on to say that "it

doesn't change the gymnastics," in
that they all still have to go out
and execute the routine just as
they would anyway.
Freshman Brian Knott, who
finished third overall for the third
straight meet, mentioned that this
added pressure could even help
the team: "It forces you to do bet
ter; it adds some more incentive to
do well."

Stanford has now improved its
total score for each of the first
three meets and will look to con
tinue this trend as the team next
competes on Feb. 12 at Cal. This
week, several individual gymnasts
will take part in the Winter Cup
Challenge in Las Vegas.

The Cardinal put up a 48.950 on
vault in the second round, highlighted
by a 9.900 by junior Nicole Dayton, who
was making a return from injury after
missing last week's meet against Wash
ington.
"Having Nicole Dayton back in the
lineup was huge. She anchors our vault
and leads off on bars and floor. It was
great to have her stability in the lineup,"
said head coach Kristen Smyth.
Ashley Morgan scored an impres
sive 9.850 to add on, but the Beavers
were still able to extend their lead to
98.225-97.825, thanks in part to a 9.875
by Leslie Mak, defending Pac-10 Gym
nast of the Year, on the bars.

day, to help the Cardinal post a
team score of 48.750. But, as was a
common trend throughout the
meet, the Beavers were just a little
bit better, as they extended their
lead to 0.900 going into the fourth
and final round. It would take a
very strong round on the beam for
Stanford to overcome the deficit in
the last round.
However, the Cardinal was un
able to put together its best round
on the beam, scoring just a 47.950,
its worst score in an event all sea
son. The team struggled on the
beam, falling three times through
out the event.
"Obviously I didn't prepare the
team on the balance beam well
enough. We're going to have to
have a lot more repetitions and a
lot more numbers," Smyth said.
She added that "there's no greater
pressure than that type of atmos
phere," but that the team should
be able to handle, and be excited
for, that kind of moment.
Senior Alyssa Brown was able
to put up Stanford's season-high
score of 9.925 on the beam. Smyth,
however, was not surprised by
Brown's performance: "Alyssa,
you expect that from our senior
leader. That's who she is."
Stanford will continue its five
game Pac-12 road streak on Sun
day at UCLA.
Men's Gymnastics
Facing California for the third
time in a row to start its season, the
No. 6 Stanford men's gymnastics
team looked to take control of the
season series Saturday night in the
Stanford Open. The Cardinal lost
to the Bears by 6.100 points at
Berkeley to open its season, but
was able to come away with a
4.750-point victory last Saturday
at Burnham Pavilion to tie the
season series. Thus, Saturday's
meet against No. 5 Cal, No. 9 Ne
braska and Washington was an
important one to establish the
Cardinal as the team to fear in the
Pac-12.
Stanford was able to do just
that, as it came away with a total
team score of 348.400, its highest
score of the season, to beat Cal
(339.000), Nebraska (332.600) and
Washington (251.200) and im
prove its record to 4-1. The Cardi
nal never trailed throughout the
entire match.
Key to Stanford's sweep was
junior Eddie Penev, who was the
all-around winner of the meet for

the third time in a row to open the
season. While many considered
his performance in last week's
meet to be the best of his career,
Penev bettered that with a career
high 89.200 on Sunday, including
personal-best scores in floor exer
cise (16.200), still rings (14.500)
and parallel bars (15.000).
The Cardinal's lack of depth,
one of the main reasons cited by
the coaching staff after the loss at
Berkeley, did not appear to affect
Stanford much in Saturday's
meet. Prior to the match, head
coach Thorn Glielmi claimed that
the team was able to handle the
extra pressure associated with this
lack of depth, and his gymnasts
agreed. While Penev mentioned
that there was definitely added
pressure, he went on to say that "it

doesn't change the gymnastics," in
that they all still have to go out
and execute the routine just as
they would anyway.
Freshman Brian Knott, who
finished third overall for the third
straight meet, mentioned that this
added pressure could even help
the team: "It forces you to do bet
ter; it adds some more incentive to
do well."

Stanford has now improved its
total score for each of the first
three meets and will look to con
tinue this trend as the team next
competes on Feb. 12 at Cal. This
week, several individual gymnasts
will take part in the Winter Cup
Challenge in Las Vegas.
