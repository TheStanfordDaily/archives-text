# Frat guys put the team on their back
## 
### Tom Taylor 
If you're an undergrad, you
probably already know that
the Kappa Sigma fraternity got
its house back; if you're a grad
student, you might not care. Ei
ther way, you might be wondering
why I feel I can justify writing about
this in my sports column. Prior to the
Fiesta Bowl, I would have agreed.
The way that tickets were distrib
uted to students in Glendale meant
that seating was randomly assigned,
and there was no guarantee you'd get
to sit next to your friends. Anyone
who has been to the Red Zone in
Stanford Stadium knows that that is
not exactly the way we do things, and
so, by some happy coincidence, we
ended up, at first, sitting in a row in
front of a handful of Kappa Sigs. But
their presence steadily grew as num
bers of them and their friends surged
in for the kickoff.

Quickly the rows around us
filled up, and then began to over
flow. We were lined up almost two
abreast, and there was a row of un
dergrads behind us standing on our
seats. A couple of times during the
game, security attempted to organ
ize the chaos and send everyone
back to their allocated places, but it
didn't work. New occupants
streamed in faster than they could
eject even those in the seats closest
to the aisle.

In case you think I'm complain
ing about the disorder, though, I'm
not. While it was, admittedly, a little
cramped, it was awesome.
The fiat boys and their friends
around us were loud and nothing if
not dedicated to the cause. We were
just a few seats from the divide be
tween the Cardinal and Oklahoma
State fans, and all game long there
was a healthy amount of abuse
being traded with them my fa
vorite of which childishly adopted
the chant of the Cowboys' in-state
rivals Oklahoma: "Boomer Soon
er." Whether or not the players on
the field heard much of what was
going on, the atmosphere in the
stands was one of the highlights of
the contest for me.

Kappa Sig had their house taken
away from them due to "patterns of
behavior that g0... to a level that
was dangerous" and "an alcohol cul
ture that was dangerous," according
to Dean of Residential Education
(ResEd) Deborah Golder in March
2011. While I can't support anything
that may have actually been danger
ous, I can't deny that the atmosphere
brought by groups like fraternities is
an integral part of college life, and al
cohol legal or illegal, and whether
you partake or not is a necessary
evil that lubricates the social gears of
campus.

Few would want to attend a com
pletely dry university, because, the
truth is, students don't go to college
just to learn what they are taught in
lectures. The extracurricular activi
ties and parties are just as impor
tant. In the same way, fans don't just
go to games purely to watch the on
field action. If you really wanted to
study the game, you'd tune into it
from the quiet of your living room
on your HDTV and perhaps log in
on the Internet to get a detailed
breakdown of the statistics. Live
sports are all about the atmosphere,
and the atmosphere in college
sports is all about the students. Why
else would we get free entry to all
athletic events on campus, and why
else did we get such a significant dis
count to the Fiesta Bowl?
But not all student fans are creat
ed equal. I will happily "make some
noise" at games and join in with the
chants, but I know I'm not the most
raucous fan out there; I'm not going
to strip down and paint my chest.
That is where groups like fraternities
come in, and why it matters that
Kappa Sig got their house back.
Without somewhere to meet up,
it is harder for these organizations to
bond, and over time, they and their
influence might slowly fade, both on
campus and in the stadium, where it
matters most to Cardinal fans of all
ages. You don't have to be in a frat,
be an undergrad or even like the
idea of Greek life the concept
still seems weird to me to benefit
from their existence. Home-field
advantage can make a crucial differ
ence in tight games, and as Stanford
struggles to create the same intense
atmosphere that some other schools
take for granted, there is even
greater emphasis placed on the few
who are willing to be sufficiently
noisy and mischievous, those who
put the team on their back.

Without somewhere to meet up,
it is harder for these organizations to
bond, and over time, they and their
influence might slowly fade, both on
campus and in the stadium, where it
matters most to Cardinal fans of all
ages. You don't have to be in a frat,
be an undergrad or even like the
idea of Greek life the concept
still seems weird to me to benefit
from their existence. Home-field
advantage can make a crucial differ
ence in tight games, and as Stanford
struggles to create the same intense
atmosphere that some other schools
take for granted, there is even
greater emphasis placed on the few
who are willing to be sufficiently
noisy and mischievous, those who
put the team on their back.

If you're an undergrad, you
probably already know that
the Kappa Sigma fraternity got
its house back; if you're a grad
student, you might not care. Ei
ther way, you might be wondering
why I feel I can justify writing about
this in my sports column. Prior to the
Fiesta Bowl, I would have agreed.
The way that tickets were distrib
uted to students in Glendale meant
that seating was randomly assigned,
and there was no guarantee you'd get
to sit next to your friends. Anyone
who has been to the Red Zone in
Stanford Stadium knows that that is
not exactly the way we do things, and
so, by some happy coincidence, we
ended up, at first, sitting in a row in
front of a handful of Kappa Sigs. But
their presence steadily grew as num
bers of them and their friends surged
in for the kickoff.

Quickly the rows around us
filled up, and then began to over
flow. We were lined up almost two
abreast, and there was a row of un
dergrads behind us standing on our
seats. A couple of times during the
game, security attempted to organ
ize the chaos and send everyone
back to their allocated places, but it
didn't work. New occupants
streamed in faster than they could
eject even those in the seats closest
to the aisle.

In case you think I'm complain
ing about the disorder, though, I'm
not. While it was, admittedly, a little
cramped, it was awesome.
The fiat boys and their friends
around us were loud and nothing if
not dedicated to the cause. We were
just a few seats from the divide be
tween the Cardinal and Oklahoma
State fans, and all game long there
was a healthy amount of abuse
being traded with them my fa
vorite of which childishly adopted
the chant of the Cowboys' in-state
rivals Oklahoma: "Boomer Soon
er." Whether or not the players on
the field heard much of what was
going on, the atmosphere in the
stands was one of the highlights of
the contest for me.

Kappa Sig had their house taken
away from them due to "patterns of
behavior that g0... to a level that
was dangerous" and "an alcohol cul
ture that was dangerous," according
to Dean of Residential Education
(ResEd) Deborah Golder in March
2011. While I can't support anything
that may have actually been danger
ous, I can't deny that the atmosphere
brought by groups like fraternities is
an integral part of college life, and al
cohol legal or illegal, and whether
you partake or not is a necessary
evil that lubricates the social gears of
campus.

Few would want to attend a com
pletely dry university, because, the
truth is, students don't go to college
just to learn what they are taught in
lectures. The extracurricular activi
ties and parties are just as impor
tant. In the same way, fans don't just
go to games purely to watch the on
field action. If you really wanted to
study the game, you'd tune into it
from the quiet of your living room
on your HDTV and perhaps log in
on the Internet to get a detailed
breakdown of the statistics. Live
sports are all about the atmosphere,
and the atmosphere in college
sports is all about the students. Why
else would we get free entry to all
athletic events on campus, and why
else did we get such a significant dis
count to the Fiesta Bowl?
But not all student fans are creat
ed equal. I will happily "make some
noise" at games and join in with the
chants, but I know I'm not the most
raucous fan out there; I'm not going
to strip down and paint my chest.
That is where groups like fraternities
come in, and why it matters that
Kappa Sig got their house back.
