### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis
team cruised through its two
matches this weekend, looking
every bit like the nation's No. 6
team. A hallmark of good teams is
that they handily take care of less
er opponents, and that is exactly
what the Cardinal (4-0) did this
weekend against No. 64 Saint
Mary's and No. 50 Santa Clara.
Neither of the matches was
ever close or in doubt, leading to
the simple statement by Santa
Clara head coach Derek Mills,
"We played hard today but lost to
a better team."

Friday's match, the first round
of the qualifying tournament for
the National Team Indoor Cham
pionships against the Gaels, start
ed with the quick acquisition of
the doubles point for the Cardinal
as the teams of Ryan
Thacher/John Morrissey and
Matt Kandath/Robert Stineman
took care of their opponents in a
speedy fashion. Stanford also
started strongly in the singles
matches, led again by Thacher
a senior who is filling in admirably
for his injured two-time ail-
American teammate, Bradley
Klahn. Thacher trounced his op
ponent 6-1, 6-0, and from that
point, the rout was on.
Stanford's only dropped point
in the contest came on court three,
where junior Denis Lin was out
played in three sets by Saint Mary's
Sherif Hamdy. The other Cardinal
singles winners were Kandath,
sophomore Jamin Ball and the po
tent freshman duo of Morrissey
and Stineman, who both won for
the combined fifth time in six dual
matches. In the end, Stanford came
away with a 6-1 win.
Saturday's second round of the
ITA Kick-Off Weekend pitted the
Cardinal against the Santa Clara
Broncos, who knocked off the
Boise State Broncos in their
matchup on Friday afternoon. A
ticket to February's National
Team Indoor Championships

awaited the winner of the match.

As in Friday's match, Stanford
started off strong, rushing out to a
similar demolition by the duos of
Thacher/Morrissey and Kan
dath/Stineman. Staked to this 1-0
lead, the Cardinal had to work a
bit harder in its singles matches to
secure the victory.
Thacher cruised past his oppo
nent again, winning 6-3, 6-0, and
Lin, exacting some revenge for his
loss on Friday, won in straight sets
as well, putting Stanford on the
brink of victory with a 3-0 lead.
The remaining four matches had
all split the first two sets, so all
were forced to play a decisive
third set, a rarity in college tennis.
Stanford proved its superior en
durance by winning three of the
four three-set matches and secur
ing the same lopsided margin of vic
tory 6-1 as it had on Friday.
"We played tough and didn't let
ourselves get satisfied with our

wins from last weekend," Ball said.
"Santa Clara gave us a tough chal
lenge but our guys were prepared,
both physically and mentally."

This weekend's wins will add
to the momentum that the Cardi
nal achieved on last weekend's
road trip to Oklahoma, where the
team defeated the highly regard
ed North Carolina Tar Heels and
Tulsa Hurricanes both ranked
in the top 25.
This momentum, along with
the depth of a Stanford team that
is competing without its best play
er in Klahn, will surely be tested
when the Cardinal next takes to
the court in next weekend's high
ly anticipated home matches
against Stanford's perennial Pac
-12 rivals from Southern Califor
nia: USC on Friday and UCLA on
Saturday.

both physically and mentally."

This weekend's wins will add
to the momentum that the Cardi
nal achieved on last weekend's
road trip to Oklahoma, where the
team defeated the highly regard
ed North Carolina Tar Heels and
Tulsa Hurricanes both ranked
in the top 25.
This momentum, along with
the depth of a Stanford team that
is competing without its best play
er in Klahn, will surely be tested
when the Cardinal next takes to
the court in next weekend's high
ly anticipated home matches
against Stanford's perennial Pac
-12 rivals from Southern Califor
nia: USC on Friday and UCLA on
Saturday.

at the No. 1 position, winning his two matches while dropping only four
games in his four sets. The Cardinal cruised to victories in both matches.
