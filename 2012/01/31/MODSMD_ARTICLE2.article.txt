# Stanford plans collaboration with FDA
## Institutions sign memorandum of understanding, seek to improve regulatory process 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
On Jan. 12, the Stanford biode
sign program and the Stanford
School of Medicine signed a
memorandum of understanding
(MOU) with the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). This
memorandum gives both organi
zations a foundation that allows
future collaboration on projects,
such as working to improve the
regulatory process for innova
tions in medical technology.
Paul Yock, a medical professor
and director of the biodesign pro
gram, said that the partnership
was inspired by a mutual consen

sus that the FDA regulatory
process is too "burdensome."
Yock noted that Jeff Shuren, the
director of the FDA's Center for
Devices and Radiological Health
(CDRH), has been spearheading
an outreach effort to speak with
universities about possible collab
orations and new projects for
"regulatory science."
Yock said that he believes
Stanford was chosen as a partner
"because we are in a hotbed of
tech innovation out here" and be
cause of Stanford's national repu
tation.
When asked if he thought the
FDA was pursing similar agree
ments elsewhere, Yock said that

"their intention is absolutely to
work with other universities," but
that he did not know which uni
versities these might include.
While the MOU promises
more collaboration in the future,
its concrete provisions are yet to
be developed. Describing the
memorandum as "a first level of
agreement," Yock said that it al
lows Stanford and the FDA "to
jointly pursue projects... as a
formal partnership, so that we can
fundraise together, for example."
"It gives us the legal clear
ance," he added.
The memorandum goes into
effect immediately and was
signed by a panel of medical de

vice and technology experts, in
cluding Shuren and Yock. Al
though the FDA has interacted
most closely with the biodesign
program so far, Yock said the pro
gram is "a kind of the conduit"
and that members of the FDA
"are absolutely interested in
reaching into the medical school."
Harry Greenberg, professor in
the School of Medicine and direc
tor of Spectrum, an independent
research group funded in part by
an award from the National Insti
tutes of Health, was also present
at the signing of the memoran
dum. Greenberg noted that the
Stanford biodesign program
which he said focuses on "medical

devices and how best to sharpen
the skills and train young people
who are interested in being inno
vators in that field" â€”has gar
nered "a great reputation around
the country and around the
world."
"The memorandum of under
standing provides a sort of agree
ment to say, 'What should we
do?'" Greenberg said. "The feder
al government... likefs] to have
memorandums of understanding
as sort of a baseline thing, [certify
ing that] 'we agree to work togeth
er.' Now, specifics need to be
added to the MOU if it's going to
do anything."
According to Greenberg, the
MOU does suggest the founda
tion of what Yock calls a "bilater
al education" program. Yock and
the biodesign program expect to
expand their joint fellowship pro
gram with the FDA, which has
hosted around 16 Stanford stu
dents since its inception in 2004.
Yock anticipates both
"expand[ing] the educational im
pact for Stanford students be
yond just this fellowship," as well
as "creat[ing] a mechanism for
the reviewers at the FDA [to
come to Stanford] to understand
a little bit what it's like to develop
a new technology."
Although Stanford has
worked with the FDA before,
both on investigating regulatory
processes and bringing new de
vices through it, this will be the
first time that the biodesign pro
gram has established an educa
tional partnership with them.
"It's complicated; but at its
heart, I think, I would say that the
FDA realizes that to best do its
job in the 21st century, it has to

have a deeper understanding of
some of the scientific break
throughs and new types of sci
ence that are going to ... [be]
brought to them," Greenberg
said of the new partnership. "The
FDA, I think, reached out to us
and said, 'We [want] ... an
agreement with Stanford to real
ly take advantage of the innova
tive stuff you're doing there ...
and our people at the FDA can
get a better feel of what's actual
ly happening now in the real
world that they'll have to deal
with.'"

Yock said he also looks for
ward to "developing some case
studies of local companies...
and what their experience was in
going to the FDA."
"This will be just the start of
what we hope will be a series of
teaching models that are avail
able nationally and international
ly that talk about the regulatory
process, that look at aspects of
regulatory science and how it can
be improved," he added.
Other plans, Greenberg said,
have "just started" and are no
more than "a gleam in the dean,
and my and several other peo
ple's eye."
