## Eikenberry discusses Afghanistan Former U.S. Ambassador speaks on nation's transition 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
"We've done a lot there. We
haven't done it all well, but we
should be proud of what we have
done," former U.S. Ambassador to
Afghanistan Karl W. Eikenberry
M.A. '94 said during his closing
assessment of the United States'
role in Afghanistan.
Eikenberry spoke to approxi
mately 140 attendees about the
transition to Afghan sovereignty
in the Central Asian state Mon
day in Encina Hall's Bechtel Con
ference Center.
Eikenberry, retired United
States Army Lieutenant General,
drew on his experiences in
Afghanistan to assess progress
and identify expected challenges
in the transition period while
delivering the 2012 Payne Distin
guished Lecture. Previous lec
tures have been delivered by edi
tor in chief of The Economist John
Micklethwait, Bill Gates and for
mer Director General of the In
ternational Atomic Energy
Agency Mohamed El√üaradei.
Eikenberry started his lecture
by discussing the beginning of his
involvement in Afghanistan, cit
ing the 9/11 attacks and American
Airlines Flight 77, which crashed
into the Pentagon "literally un
derneath" his office.
"Little did I know that my en
tire life, my career, like it was for
so many Americans, was to take a
very dramatic change," he said.
Eikenberry's academic focus
had been East Asian Studies, but
the 2001 attacks and the declara
tion of war on Afghanistan in Oc
tober of the same year constituted
a "sharp departure" for him.
At the beginning of the talk, he
maintained that despite serving as
the Commander of the Ameri
can-led Coalition forces from
2005 to 2007 and the U.S. Ambas
sador from May 2009 to July 2011,
he was "not an expert on
Afghanistan." The statement
elicited chuckles from the audi
ence.
Four phases of U.S. involvement
in Afghanistan
After following with a number
of humorous anecdotes featuring
mistranslations and ironic situa
tions, Eikenberry spoke about the
four phases of U.S. involvement in
Afghanistan to establish context
for his discussion of challenges in
moving forward.
He divided the stages chrono
logically, 2001 to 2003, 2004 to
2008,2009 to 2011 and the current
to future transition stage.
He described the first stage as
one of urgency.
"At the time of course, the
Bush administration was eager to
quickly launch a counter-offen
sive into Afghanistan and strike at
A1 Qaeda," he said. "Not a lot of
thought at this point was about a
comprehensive kind of state
building program, or a compre
hensive stabilization and recon
struction program."
Some of the actions taken by
the United States during this
stage, he said, would come back to
"complicate policy," particularly
the formation of local alliances
with militia to fight the Taliban.
The second stage was distin
guished by deterioration in the se
curity situation, marked by a drop
in security in 2007.
"You started to now see in pol
icy statements more discussion of
what you could call the hardening
of Afghanistan," Eikenberry said,
mentioning public declarations of
frustration with President of
Afghanistan Hamid Karzai and
critiques of Taliban sanctuaries in
Pakistan.

The third phase Eikenberry
described began with the election
of President Obama, and Eiken
berry's own appointment as am
bassador. The military and civil
ian counterinsurgency surges
marked this phase, following an
assessment of the situation and
General McChrystal's recom
mendation for an increase in mil
itary troops.
In Nov. 2009, The New York
Times published two classified ca
bles by Eikenberry, which indicat
ed his belief that a troop buildup
would hurt the war effort, that
were leaked. Eikenberry did not
mention these objections in his
talk.

"Gen. McChrystal's assess
ment [was] that we're getting to a
tipping point in terms of security,"
he said. "It's starting to move very
much in the Taliban's direction,
and so the response to this will
have to be a recommended surge
of military troops to help regain
the momentum from the Tal
iban."

"There was no question at that
time that more military troops
would be needed," he added.

Eikenberry led the civilian
surge, which he said "was de
signed to give a choice between
the Taliban which could pro
vide justice but not services
and a better more accountable
government of Afghanistan."
This strategy included U.S. sup
port for developing the rule of
law, democratization and the
economy of Afghanistan. He said
it led to an increase in the number
of civilians present at the U.S. em
bassy in Afghanistan from 325 to
1300, making it the largest U.S.
embassy in the world.
Eikenberry argued that the
surge was successful, "unques
tionably" in the case of its military
impact.

"There was absolutely no
question that the Taliban momen
tum was shifted back against
them and that we regained the
momentum," he said.
Special Operations Forces
conducted a series of raids against

Taliban mid-level and senior
level leadership that "absolutely
decimated the Taliban's ... com
mand control," he said.
"On the civilian side," he
added, "There's no question that
gains were made in terms of poli
tics in Afghanistan or in the build
ing of political institutions."

He also mentioned results of
the Asia Foundation Survey of
2011 as evidence that the surge
had positive effects.
"If we did not have the pres
ence in Afghanistan, our military,
our intelligence and our civilian
teams ... we would not be mak
ing steady progress against A1
Qaeda," he said. "You cannot
think of Afghanistan ... without
thinking of the enablement that
comes from Afghanistan."
The final phase in U.S. involve
ment in Afghanistan was the
focus of the remainder of his talk:
the strategy of transition to
Afghan sovereignty.
"What we've embarked upon .

.. is a very ambitious program
which over time will lead to the
transfer of responsibility for secu
rity to Afghan policy and to the
Afghan army," he said, outlining a
transition plan that will end
NATO combat operations in
Afghanistan in 2014. President
Karzai announced the second
wave of transition on Nov 27 of
last year.

"I would say at this point in
time that we're doing reasonably
well," Eikenberry said. "With
transition now we've got, on the
military side, a renewed focus on

the Afghan National Security
Forces development. . . and a
continuing focus against A1
Qaeda.

He also mentioned Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton's call for a
"diplomatic surge" in February
2011 as part of the transition strat
egy-

Eikenberry then moved to as
sess challenges to the transition
strategy, mentioning Pakistan, the
Afghan National Security Forces
(ANSF), economic challenges
and corruption as the four main
potential obstacles.
He described corruption as a
"massive," "rampant" and "can
cerous" problem in the country.
"Looking ahead to 2014, we're
not seeing the necessary steps
being taken to ensure a better elec
tion," he said. "There are no signs
of electoral reform emerging."
Implications of U.S. involvement
overseas
Eikenberry ended by dis
cussing the implications of U.S.
campaigns in Afghanistan and
Iraq for American power over
seas, drawing upon American his
torian Townsend Hoopes' 1969
reflections on the United States'
role in Vietnam.
"If we think that we can con
tinue to avoid discussions of cost
and complexity, and try to contin
ue to impose order on our terms
without thinking through ... con
sequences, I frankly have to say in
leaving Afghanistan that I worry
more and more about our own
country experiencing our own
East of Suez moment of over
reaching," he said, drawing a par
allel with the end of the British
empire after the Suez Crisis of
1956.
He also stressed the impor
tance of reinvigorating the U.S.
economy.
"We have the anomaly that
we've got the best military in the
world that is making Afghanistan
safe for Chinese and Indian in
vestments," he said.
He told a story of his experi
ence in the Southern Afghan
province of Helmand, when tribal
leaders asked him about Peace
Corps and U.S. Aid workers who
had assisted the region in the
1950s and 60s.

"The need for us, as Ameri
cans, is to remember what our
roots of greatness were in the last
century," he said.
Audience members posed
questions about the problems of
narco-trafficking, American busi
ness interests, Pakistan and iden
tity concerns in ethnically diverse
Afghanistan.
"Although Afghanistan pro
duces about 90 percent of the
world's poppy it consumes about
1 percent of that total," Eikenber
ry said. "Look around, where's
the demand? To be angry and ac
cusatory with the Afghans ... we
don't have a very good grip on our
demand problem either."

Director of the Center on
Democracy, Development and
the Rule of Law (CDDRL) Larry
Diamond, described the talk as
"riveting, compelling, lucid, ana
lytically powerful and honest."

There was no
question at that
time that more
military troops
would be needed.
