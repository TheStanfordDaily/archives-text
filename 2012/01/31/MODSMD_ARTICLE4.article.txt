## Prendergast calls for 'informed activism' 
### NATASHA WEASER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
U.S. President Barack Obama said student
groups were the key to putting the conflicts in
Darfur and Sudan on the radar screen of pol
icymakers, according to John Prendergast, a
prominent human rights activist, author and
former Director for African Affairs at the Na
tional Security Council. Prendergast spoke
Monday afternoon to a group of 40 Stanford
students, staff and community members at
the Arrillaga Family Dining Commons Study
Room.
Prendergast praised the efforts of youth
and student movements, such as anti-geno
cide movement STAND, which has a Stan
ford chapter, for its advocacy efforts. He en
couraged students who are passionate about
activism to use new media tools to craft per
sonal stories that can mobilize the public and
policymakers.
"I am amazed by criticism that activists
have undermined the peace process," he said.
"These groups have had a great deal of influ

ence in putting the issue on the agenda of pol
icymakers who are the ones responsible,"
"Informed activism can make a huge dif
ference," he added. "We cannot tell the U.S.
how to conduct foreign policy but we can help
drive its focus on forgotten human rights is
sues where literally millions of lives are at
stake."
The discussion, titled "Why South Sudan
Succeeded and Why Darfur Failed: Lessons
About Activism," is part of a guest lecture se
ries on various human rights issues by Pren
dergast, which had its first event last Tuesday
and will have its last event this Thursday.
Crothers Global Citizenship, the Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Education and the
Residential Education's Charles F. Riddell
Fund co-sponsored the talk.
Prendergast co-founded the Enough Proj
ect, an initiative to end genocide, with
Crothers' Resident Fellow Steve Stedman.
Prendergast began his talk by applying
what he called the "Four Ps" of external en
gagement consisting of Policy, Personnel,
Process and Political Will to both South

ern Sudan and Darfur.
Prendergast warned that there are still key
issues to resolve between Sudan and South
ern Sudan including the distribution of oil
revenues, border demarcation and territory
disputes as well as internal communal
fighting in both areas.
However, he considers the formation of
Southern Sudan as an independent state to be
a success, crediting it to international pres
sure and the efforts of the Obama administra
tion in reasserting a firm U.S. leadership role
in the region.
"The international community was able to
zero in on the essential issue of self-determi
nation for the people in the south," Prender
gast said. "There were a lot of hiccups, but
they essentially got it right."
In comparison, he called the U.S. and inter
national involvement in the Darfur conflict
"literally a case study of how not to undertake
peace."
"The utterly fatal flaw in Darfur was send-
