## $30 million donation funds Stanford-Columbia new media institute 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
Stanford's School of Engineering and
Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism
announced Monday a new institute that will
span both campuses and explore the rela
tionship between technology and journal
ism.
A joint press release heralded the plans
as "groundbreaking in that they are de
signed to encourage and support new en

deavors with the potential to inform and en
tertain in transformative ways."
Long-time Cosmopolitan editor in chief
Helen Gurley Brown donated $3O million, in
memory of her belated husband David
Brown B.A. '36, to make the bicoastal insti
tute possible. The new center will bear both
their names: the David and Helen Gurley
Brown Institute for Media Innovation.
This $3O million donation will be divided
in thirds. Both Stanford and Columbia will
receive a gift of $l2 million, intended to fund
a director for the institute on the West Coast
and a separate director on the East Coast.
The remaining $6 million will finance the
construction of an addition to Columbia's
current journalism building, which will in
clude "a state-of-the-art high-tech" news
room.

Bernd Girod, a Stanford professor of
electrical engineering, has been appointed
as the institute's founding director. Colum
bia has yet to choose its counterpart direc
tor.
"New York City, as the major center for
television, music, print media and advertis
ing, is profoundly affected by rapidly evolv
ing digital technology," Girod said in the
press release. "The Brown Institute will
bring together creative innovators skilled in
production and delivery of news and enter
tainment with the entrepreneurial re
searchers at Stanford working in multime
dia technology."
At both Stanford and Columbia, the in
stitute will award "Magic Grants," which will
financially support "the most innovative and
promising ideas" by graduate and postgrad

uate fellows. The press release stressed that
the new center will focus on actually realiz
ing ideas through the creation of prototypes
and establishing links with the business
world.
"David and I have long supported and
encouraged bright young people to follow
their passions and to create original con
tent," Brown said in the press release. "Great
content needs useable technology. Sharing a
language is where the magic happens. It's
time for two great American institutions on
the East and West Coasts to build a bridge."
Mr. Brown graduated from Stanford with
a B.A. in communications and would later
attend Columbia School of Journalism. He
was an Academy Award-nominated produc-
