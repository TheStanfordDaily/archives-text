## PROFILE IAN MORRIS UNEARTHING THE PAST FOR CLUES ABOUT THE FUTURE 
### SHIRLEY YARIN 
A square meter of any archaeo
logical dig tends to unearth
bones, stone tools, ceramics,
textiles a little of every
thing and a lot of dirt. Some
might call it playing in the dirt. Others just
dig for expensive artifacts. For history and
classics professor lan Morris, it is an op
portunity to unearth the past in away that
helps explain trends of the present.
After many such digs and a large
amount of research, Morris formulated
some ideas as to why the Western world
has become so successful. His most recent
book, "Why the West Rules ... For Now,"
explains the effects geography and natu
ral resources have on the distribution of
wealth and power.

For his book, Morris conducted re
search projects and excavations to ana
lyze the gradual decline of indigenous cul
tures.

He directed one such excavation in
Mote Polizzo, Italy, where native Sicilian
society arose. His team focused on what
happened when Greeks settled on the
coast. Morris discovered that the indige
nous Sicilian population grew after the
Greeks arrived because they were able to
connect to bigger economic networks.
Morris explained how he analyzed ar
chaeological artifacts to help him arrive at
these conclusions.

"One way to distinguish archeological
artifacts is form and function," Morris
said. "Different vessels are good for dif
ferent things. Another common method
ology is residue analysis, through which
archeologists are able to discern what liq
uid soaked into the material."

Because the cups are almost indistin
guishable from the Greek originals and
made from clay found at the site, Morris
concluded that the Sicilians actually
adopted the Greek's heating process,
much like they adopted a variety of other
cultural traditions. Thus, the culture of the

indigenous population gradually col
lapsed after the appearance of the Greeks.
While conducting research for his
book, he said his perspective changed
drastically. Morris looked at a large span
of history while comparing the develop
ment of the West with that of other parts
of the world.
"That helped me to understand that
the West's success in projecting its power
around the world wasn't driven by some
innate superiority of European culture,
but rested on ... geographical forces,"
Morris wrote in an email to The Daily.
"People have the same motives, same de
sires, urges and shortcomings. What
makes a real difference in how societies
flourish is the geography they are in."
This quarter at Stanford, Morris brings
his archaeological experience to the class
room in an Introduction to the Humani
ties course, A Human History, a Global
Approach.
