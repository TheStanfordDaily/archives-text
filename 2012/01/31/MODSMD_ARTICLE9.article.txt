In sociology professor Gi-Wook Shin's
sunny room in Encina Hall, a black
and white drawing of Seoul, circa 1965,
hangs next to the door and golden stat
uettes from Korea perch on smaller
shelves. Shin's book collection of Korean
documents and his own writings, expansive
and neatly organized, spans most of his of
fice wall. As the director of Stanford's Kore
an Studies Program (KSP), Shin's interest in
Korean studies is vast.

Shin left UC-Los Angeles for Stanford in
2001 to create Stanford's Korean Studies
Program. He wanted to carve out a niche for
a program that would focus specifically on
Korea's current issues. As director, Shin's
mission would focus on social science, con
temporary issues and policy implementa
tion.

Despite its relatively young age the
KSP celebrated its tenth birthday in 2011
the program has experienced marked suc
cess, Shin said. It has acquired significant

funding and increased its faculty base, serv
ing the niche Shin had hoped.
Four years ago, Stanford's program led
the New Beginnings Project, in which 10
American experts on Korea drafted policy
recommendations concerning U.S.-Korean
affairs, which were sent to the Obama Ad
ministration. The KSP has also started a
semi-annual dialogue between American
and Korean experts, in which they discuss
the South Korea-U.S. alliance and shared
concerns of both countries.

The Korean Studies Program has been
particularly active since former North Kore
an leader Kim Jong-Il's recent death. On
Jan. 18, they organized the panel discussion
"The Korean Peninsula After Kim Jong-Il:
Challenges and Opportunities," featuring
Shin alongside Katharina Zellweger, the
Asia-Pacific Research Center's (APARC)
Pantech Fellow; former Korean Ambassa
dor to the European Union Park Joon-woo,
APARC's Koret Fellow; David Straub, the

associate director of the KSP; and
Daniel Sneider, associate director
of research for APARC. The pan
elists discussed a variety of North
Korean affairs, including its future
relationship with the U.S.
At the discussion. Shin said
that he didn't expect there to be
any major changes this year. How
ever, he anticipated a shifting rela
tionship between North and
South Korea next year, especially
if the Progressive Party comes
into power.
He also speculated that South
Korea "might pursue a very ag
gressive policy engagement with
North Korea."
Zellweger agreed.
"I don't think that in the short
or medium-term there will be po
litical change," she said. "As far as
the economy is concerned, [there
will probably be] more experi
menting rather than major eco
nomic reform ... The new situa
tion could also be an opportunity
for renewed dialogue for those
countries with an interest for
peace and stability on the Korean
peninsula."
Shin's work with KSP focuses
on the bridge between the U.S.
and Korea.
"As a Korean-American schol
ar, I have a sense of mission to ac

complish: improving the relations
of the two countries to which I am
most attached," he said.

Since childhood. Shin pos
sessed a deeply ingrained sense of
purpose. His father, a church min
ister, often worked with impover
ished men and women. Shin said
that he hopes to bring about posi
tive social change like his father.

In 1979, when Shin was a fresh
man at Yonsei University in South
Korea, Korean president Park
Chung-hee was assassinated. The
death of the long-time authoritar
ian leader prompted a student-led
initiative between Shin and his
peers at South Korea's elite uni
versities. This catalyzed Shin's ex
isting interest in Korean social
movements.

When asked about his motiva
tion to choose his particular field,
Shin mentioned the influence of
South Korean culture on social
works.

"In Confucian culture, you be
come [an] elite to serve the state,"
he said. "If you see social injustice,
then you are supposed to speak
out. So there's a sense of mission.
So if you go to an elite school, you
have to do something against the
social injustice."
As a professor, Shin hopes to
extend his sense of mission and
purpose to his students.
"I try to make them under
stand Korea," he said.
