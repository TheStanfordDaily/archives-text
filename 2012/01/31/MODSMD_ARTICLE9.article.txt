In sociology professor Gi-Wook Shin's
sunny room in Encina Hall, a black
and white drawing of Seoul, circa 1965,
hangs next to the door and golden stat
uettes from Korea perch on smaller
shelves. Shin's book collection of Korean
documents and his own writings, expansive
and neatly organized, spans most of his of
fice wall. As the director of Stanford's Kore
an Studies Program (KSP), Shin's interest in
Korean studies is vast.

Shin left UC-Los Angeles for Stanford in
2001 to create Stanford's Korean Studies
Program. He wanted to carve out a niche for
a program that would focus specifically on
Korea's current issues. As director, Shin's
mission would focus on social science, con
temporary issues and policy implementa
tion.

Despite its relatively young age the
KSP celebrated its tenth birthday in 2011
the program has experienced marked suc
cess, Shin said. It has acquired significant

funding and increased its faculty base, serv
ing the niche Shin had hoped.
Four years ago, Stanford's program led
the New Beginnings Project, in which 10
American experts on Korea drafted policy
recommendations concerning U.S.-Korean
affairs, which were sent to the Obama Ad
ministration. The KSP has also started a
semi-annual dialogue between American
and Korean experts, in which they discuss
the South Korea-U.S. alliance and shared
concerns of both countries.

The Korean Studies Program has been
particularly active since former North Kore
an leader Kim Jong-Il's recent death. On
Jan. 18, they organized the panel discussion
"The Korean Peninsula After Kim Jong-Il:
Challenges and Opportunities," featuring
Shin alongside Katharina Zellweger, the
Asia-Pacific Research Center's (APARC)
Pantech Fellow; former Korean Ambassa
dor to the European Union Park Joon-woo,
APARC's Koret Fellow; David Straub, the
