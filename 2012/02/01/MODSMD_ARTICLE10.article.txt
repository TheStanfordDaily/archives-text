## PROFILE GE WANG IN CONCERT WITH TECHNOLOGY 
### LINDA YU 
Ge Wang has regretted spending
too much time coding and
playing Star Craft, but he has
never regretted playing a sec
ond of music.
He is the mastermind behind the music
app start-up Smule, which has released a
number of wildly successful apps, including
"Ocarina," "Magic Piano" and "I Am T-
Pain." Dedicated to sharing his love of
music and pushing the boundaries of com
puter music, Wang is also an assistant pro
fessor of music and, by courtesy, of comput
er science. He also finds time to stay in
volved with a number of musical groups on
campus, including the Stanford Laptop Or
chestra (SLOrk) and Stanford Mobile
Phone Orchestra (MoPho).
Wang's first exposure to music came
when he was living in Beijing with his
grandparents.
"My grandmother loved Beijing opera,

my grandfather loved Western classical
music, and since both were well versed in
their respective musical loves, there was al
ways music happening at home," he said.
Following this initial stimulus, Wang
started playing the accordion and the elec
tric guitar. In high school he stumbled into
working with music and computers.
"I was writing little ditties, and it just
seemed really fun to write music with com
puters," Wang said.
He didn't have any technical experience
or programming knowledge at the time, but
he made use of whatever notation and pro
duction software he could get his hands on,
whether it was shareware, freeware or
cracked to remove copy protections.
In college, Wang chose to study comput
er science at Duke University, which he
credits to his interest in video games.
"It seemed to me that the one thing
more fun than playing video games was
making them," he said. "Software is a good
way to express ideas you may have, and it's
easy to get together people around the

world to use it. That's magical."
Though he had wanted to somehow
combine music and computer science in his
studies, Wang didn't realize how he could
do so until he took an electronic music class
his junior year. Shortly thereafter, he heard
a composition by Paul Lansky called "Ta
bles Clear," which inspired him to pursue
computer music in his graduate studies.
"Lansky recorded sounds in the kitchen,
from pots and pans to children screaming,
and then somehow transformed them so
that they magically self-organized into this
music," he said. "It was something you
couldn't make without computers and I
knew after hearing it that I wanted to learn
how to do it."
After completing his graduate studies at
Princeton, Wang applied for an assistant
professor position at Stanford's Center for
Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics (CCRMA) in early 2007.
"I had known how instrumental Stan
ford has been in the short history of com
puter music," he said. "CCRMA is a place

for serendipitously awesome stuff to hap
pen, and the people at CCRMA set the
tone for me to move forward."
One such step forward was founding the
iOS music software developer Smule in
2008, which Wang undertook with one of his
graduate students, Jeffrey Smith 'B9 M.S. 'B9
Ph.D. 'l3. Though Wang was already simul
taneously working on a number of different
projects, he was drawn in by the potential
academic and social benefits of Smule.
"From a researcher's point of view, to
truly study mobile music, you have to study
it from a large scale in the hundreds of
thousands or millions so a startup made
sense," he said.
Wang also hoped Smule would increase
the accessibility of music. Frustrated by the
current "few-to-many" state of music mak
ing, where a few people are creating music
and most people are consuming it, he envi
sions a future where making music is more
widespread.
