## PROFILE GE WANG IN CONCERT WITH TECHNOLOGY 
### LINDA YU 
Ge Wang has regretted spending
too much time coding and
playing Star Craft, but he has
never regretted playing a sec
ond of music.
He is the mastermind behind the music
app start-up Smule, which has released a
number of wildly successful apps, including
"Ocarina," "Magic Piano" and "I Am T-
Pain." Dedicated to sharing his love of
music and pushing the boundaries of com
puter music, Wang is also an assistant pro
fessor of music and, by courtesy, of comput
er science. He also finds time to stay in
volved with a number of musical groups on
campus, including the Stanford Laptop Or
chestra (SLOrk) and Stanford Mobile
Phone Orchestra (MoPho).
Wang's first exposure to music came
when he was living in Beijing with his
grandparents.
"My grandmother loved Beijing opera,

my grandfather loved Western classical
music, and since both were well versed in
their respective musical loves, there was al
ways music happening at home," he said.
Following this initial stimulus, Wang
started playing the accordion and the elec
tric guitar. In high school he stumbled into
working with music and computers.
"I was writing little ditties, and it just
seemed really fun to write music with com
puters," Wang said.
He didn't have any technical experience
or programming knowledge at the time, but
he made use of whatever notation and pro
duction software he could get his hands on,
whether it was shareware, freeware or
cracked to remove copy protections.
In college, Wang chose to study comput
er science at Duke University, which he
credits to his interest in video games.
"It seemed to me that the one thing
more fun than playing video games was
making them," he said. "Software is a good
way to express ideas you may have, and it's
easy to get together people around the

world to use it. That's magical."
Though he had wanted to somehow
combine music and computer science in his
studies, Wang didn't realize how he could
do so until he took an electronic music class
his junior year. Shortly thereafter, he heard
a composition by Paul Lansky called "Ta
bles Clear," which inspired him to pursue
computer music in his graduate studies.
"Lansky recorded sounds in the kitchen,
from pots and pans to children screaming,
and then somehow transformed them so
that they magically self-organized into this
music," he said. "It was something you
couldn't make without computers and I
knew after hearing it that I wanted to learn
how to do it."
After completing his graduate studies at
Princeton, Wang applied for an assistant
professor position at Stanford's Center for
Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics (CCRMA) in early 2007.
"I had known how instrumental Stan
ford has been in the short history of com
puter music," he said. "CCRMA is a place

for serendipitously awesome stuff to hap
pen, and the people at CCRMA set the
tone for me to move forward."
One such step forward was founding the
iOS music software developer Smule in
2008, which Wang undertook with one of his
graduate students, Jeffrey Smith 'B9 M.S. 'B9
Ph.D. 'l3. Though Wang was already simul
taneously working on a number of different
projects, he was drawn in by the potential
academic and social benefits of Smule.
"From a researcher's point of view, to
truly study mobile music, you have to study
it from a large scale in the hundreds of
thousands or millions so a startup made
sense," he said.
Wang also hoped Smule would increase
the accessibility of music. Frustrated by the
current "few-to-many" state of music mak
ing, where a few people are creating music
and most people are consuming it, he envi
sions a future where making music is more
widespread.

The main difficulty in realizing
this goal lies in the barriers that
keep people from making and
sharing their music. Wang thinks
social pressure is the biggest cul
prit.

"People either consider them
selves to be a musician or not," he
said. "But, as Picasso said, 'Every
one is born an artist,' and I really
do believe that."

"As children, we don't have
much inhibition to try new things
or be embarrassed, so therefore
there is no failure," Wang added.
"At some point, people start clas
sifying themselves, and they al
most sell themselves short. I'm
wondering if there's away to
undo that."

Wang speculates that fear of
negative or insincerely positive
feedback holds people back from

sharing their music.
"Wouldn't it be nice if the con
ditions could be set so that you
would feel much freer about mak
ing music?" he said. "People sing
alone in the car or in the shower.
How can we get people to socially
share that?"

Current Smule app users are
already a part of Wang's strategy
to help people get over the initial
hump of making music: present
ing it as a game in an anonymous
setting.

"It's like benignly tricking
people into making music," he
said. "People may think musical
instruments are for specialists, but
everyone can play a game. Music
is human, music is social, and once
you have it, you'll want more."
Music apps are varied and
plenty, but the Smule apps stand
out because of Wang's musical
philosophy in sculpting the user
interaction. Aside from stellar
graphics and the gaming mechan
ics built into the apps, Wang also
makes sure to not shortchange

the music-making experience.
"We don't want to lose that true
expression," he said. "There's a
balance between ease of entry into
the experience and leaving enough
room for personal expression."
Drawing from that philosophy,
many Smule apps set up a balance
between the human and machine
by hinting to users how to play
certain songs, without penalizing
them for stepping outside of the
guidelines. Wang compared the
structure to "Rock Band," which
he feels is more rigid and less per
sonal. The main difference in
Smule's approach, he argued, is
that the app fully preserves the
user's music rather than encour
aging perfect imitation of a prede
termined piece of music.
Wang is also cognizant of the
dangers of instant gratification,
which technology often provides.
Mastering an instrument requires
hundreds or thousands of hours
of diligent practice, and he doesn't
want to remove the effort from
learning. He described the apps as

more like a "gateway drag" a
way to give users the feeling that
playing music is worthwhile.
"If it weren't for a vision, you
can't really justify the process of
going through it," he said. "Hope
fully we can still instill this sense
that if you put more time into it,
you can get better at it. In the end,
it's up to the person. We're just
making it easier for people to get
pumped about doing these things
in the first place,"

In addition to his work with
Smule, Wang is also involved with
computer music research at
CCRMA, where he studies new
possibilities in music due to tech
nology.
He pointed out that computer
music is not about recreating ex
isting types of music with comput
ers, and will not replace tradition
al music. Instead, the intersection
of music and technology com
bines elements of the past and fu
ture.
"There's so much room for
everything to coexist, and we con
tinue to add to the palette," Wang
said. "You need instruments and
ways to make music we've always
had."

With technology's powerful

capabilities, it presents multiple
paths for musical exploration.
One area of development is mo
bile phones.

"Hundreds of millions of
phones will be connected, and be
fore long, billions," he said. "What
kinds of new music can we make?
Can we create an instrument for a
million people to join in on and
create music meaningfully? I
don't know what that is right now,
but it was simply impossible be
fore because the technology was
n't there to support it."
This sense of uncertainty is in
herent in his research, but Wang is
driven by the belief that there is
no doubt of the need for music in
our lives. Earlier last March, fol
lowing the earthquake in Japan,
more than 3,500 users of Smule's
"Glee Karaoke" app uploaded
their versions of "Lean on Me,"
creating an international chorus
of support.
"Music is entirely different
from everything else," Wang said.
"It defies the need for logic, but
it's not illogical. It makes sense in
its own way."

makes sure to not shortchange

the music-making experience.
"We don't want to lose that true
expression," he said. "There's a
balance between ease of entry into
the experience and leaving enough
room for personal expression."
Drawing from that philosophy,
many Smule apps set up a balance
between the human and machine
by hinting to users how to play
certain songs, without penalizing
them for stepping outside of the
guidelines. Wang compared the
structure to "Rock Band," which
he feels is more rigid and less per
sonal. The main difference in

that the app fully preserves the
user's music rather than encour

Wang is also cognizant of the
dangers of instant gratification,
which technology often provides.
Mastering an instrument requires
hundreds or thousands of hours
of diligent practice, and he doesn't
want to remove the effort from
learning. He described the apps as

more like a "gateway drag" a
way to give users the feeling that
playing music is worthwhile.
"If it weren't for a vision, you
can't really justify the process of
going through it," he said. "Hope
fully we can still instill this sense
that if you put more time into it,
you can get better at it. In the end,
it's up to the person. We're just
making it easier for people to get
pumped about doing these things
in the first place,"

In addition to his work with
Smule, Wang is also involved with
computer music research at
CCRMA, where he studies new
possibilities in music due to tech
nology.
He pointed out that computer
music is not about recreating ex
isting types of music with comput
ers, and will not replace tradition
al music. Instead, the intersection
of music and technology com
bines elements of the past and fu
ture.
"There's so much room for
everything to coexist, and we con
tinue to add to the palette," Wang
said. "You need instruments and
ways to make music we've always
had."

With technology's powerful

capabilities, it presents multiple
paths for musical exploration.
One area of development is mo
bile phones.

"Hundreds of millions of
phones will be connected, and be
fore long, billions," he said. "What
kinds of new music can we make?
Can we create an instrument for a
million people to join in on and
create music meaningfully? I
don't know what that is right now,
but it was simply impossible be
fore because the technology was
n't there to support it."
This sense of uncertainty is in
herent in his research, but Wang is
driven by the belief that there is
no doubt of the need for music in
our lives. Earlier last March, fol
lowing the earthquake in Japan,
more than 3,500 users of Smule's
"Glee Karaoke" app uploaded
their versions of "Lean on Me,"
creating an international chorus
of support.
"Music is entirely different
from everything else," Wang said.
"It defies the need for logic, but
it's not illogical. It makes sense in

Ge Wang has regretted spending
too much time coding and
playing Star Craft, but he has
never regretted playing a sec
ond of music.
He is the mastermind behind the music
app start-up Smule, which has released a
number of wildly successful apps, including
"Ocarina," "Magic Piano" and "I Am T-
Pain." Dedicated to sharing his love of
music and pushing the boundaries of com
puter music, Wang is also an assistant pro
fessor of music and, by courtesy, of comput
er science. He also finds time to stay in
volved with a number of musical groups on
campus, including the Stanford Laptop Or
chestra (SLOrk) and Stanford Mobile
Phone Orchestra (MoPho).
Wang's first exposure to music came
when he was living in Beijing with his
grandparents.
"My grandmother loved Beijing opera,

my grandfather loved Western classical
music, and since both were well versed in
their respective musical loves, there was al
ways music happening at home," he said.
Following this initial stimulus, Wang
started playing the accordion and the elec
tric guitar. In high school he stumbled into
working with music and computers.
"I was writing little ditties, and it just
seemed really fun to write music with com
puters," Wang said.
He didn't have any technical experience
or programming knowledge at the time, but
he made use of whatever notation and pro
duction software he could get his hands on,
whether it was shareware, freeware or
cracked to remove copy protections.
In college, Wang chose to study comput
er science at Duke University, which he
credits to his interest in video games.
"It seemed to me that the one thing
more fun than playing video games was
making them," he said. "Software is a good
way to express ideas you may have, and it's
easy to get together people around the

world to use it. That's magical."
Though he had wanted to somehow
combine music and computer science in his
studies, Wang didn't realize how he could
do so until he took an electronic music class
his junior year. Shortly thereafter, he heard
a composition by Paul Lansky called "Ta
bles Clear," which inspired him to pursue
computer music in his graduate studies.
"Lansky recorded sounds in the kitchen,
from pots and pans to children screaming,
and then somehow transformed them so
that they magically self-organized into this
music," he said. "It was something you
couldn't make without computers and I
knew after hearing it that I wanted to learn
how to do it."
After completing his graduate studies at
Princeton, Wang applied for an assistant
professor position at Stanford's Center for
Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics (CCRMA) in early 2007.
"I had known how instrumental Stan
ford has been in the short history of com
puter music," he said. "CCRMA is a place

for serendipitously awesome stuff to hap
pen, and the people at CCRMA set the
tone for me to move forward."
One such step forward was founding the
iOS music software developer Smule in
2008, which Wang undertook with one of his
graduate students, Jeffrey Smith 'B9 M.S. 'B9
Ph.D. 'l3. Though Wang was already simul
taneously working on a number of different
projects, he was drawn in by the potential
academic and social benefits of Smule.
"From a researcher's point of view, to
truly study mobile music, you have to study
it from a large scale in the hundreds of
thousands or millions so a startup made
sense," he said.
Wang also hoped Smule would increase
the accessibility of music. Frustrated by the
current "few-to-many" state of music mak
ing, where a few people are creating music
and most people are consuming it, he envi
sions a future where making music is more
widespread.

The main difficulty in realizing
this goal lies in the barriers that
keep people from making and
sharing their music. Wang thinks
social pressure is the biggest cul
prit.

"People either consider them
selves to be a musician or not," he
said. "But, as Picasso said, 'Every
one is born an artist,' and I really
do believe that."

"As children, we don't have
much inhibition to try new things
or be embarrassed, so therefore
there is no failure," Wang added.
"At some point, people start clas
sifying themselves, and they al
most sell themselves short. I'm
wondering if there's away to
undo that."

Wang speculates that fear of
negative or insincerely positive
feedback holds people back from

sharing their music.
"Wouldn't it be nice if the con
ditions could be set so that you
would feel much freer about mak
ing music?" he said. "People sing
alone in the car or in the shower.
How can we get people to socially
share that?"

Current Smule app users are
already a part of Wang's strategy
to help people get over the initial
hump of making music: present
ing it as a game in an anonymous
setting.

"It's like benignly tricking
people into making music," he
said. "People may think musical
instruments are for specialists, but
everyone can play a game. Music
is human, music is social, and once
you have it, you'll want more."
Music apps are varied and
plenty, but the Smule apps stand
out because of Wang's musical
philosophy in sculpting the user
interaction. Aside from stellar
graphics and the gaming mechan
ics built into the apps, Wang also
makes sure to not shortchange

the music-making experience.
"We don't want to lose that true

his junior year. Shortly thereafter, he heard
a composition by Paul Lansky called "Ta
bles Clear," which inspired him to pursue
computer music in his graduate studies.
"Lansky recorded sounds in the kitchen,
from pots and pans to children screaming,
and then somehow transformed them so
that they magically self-organized into this
music," he said. "It was something you
couldn't make without computers and I
knew after hearing it that I wanted to learn
how to do it."
After completing his graduate studies at
Princeton, Wang applied for an assistant
professor position at Stanford's Center for
Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics (CCRMA) in early 2007.
"I had known how instrumental Stan
ford has been in the short history of com
puter music," he said. "CCRMA is a place

for serendipitously awesome stuff to hap
pen, and the people at CCRMA set the
tone for me to move forward."
One such step forward was founding the
iOS music software developer Smule in
2008, which Wang undertook with one of his
graduate students, Jeffrey Smith 'B9 M.S. 'B9
Ph.D. 'l3. Though Wang was already simul
taneously working on a number of different
projects, he was drawn in by the potential
academic and social benefits of Smule.
"From a researcher's point of view, to
truly study mobile music, you have to study
it from a large scale in the hundreds of
thousands or millions so a startup made
sense," he said.
Wang also hoped Smule would increase
the accessibility of music. Frustrated by the
current "few-to-many" state of music mak
ing, where a few people are creating music
and most people are consuming it, he envi
sions a future where making music is more
widespread.

The main difficulty in realizing
this goal lies in the barriers that
keep people from making and
sharing their music. Wang thinks
social pressure is the biggest cul
prit.

"People either consider them
selves to be a musician or not," he
said. "But, as Picasso said, 'Every
one is born an artist,' and I really
do believe that."

"As children, we don't have
much inhibition to try new things
or be embarrassed, so therefore
there is no failure," Wang added.
"At some point, people start clas
sifying themselves, and they al
most sell themselves short. I'm
wondering if there's away to
undo that."

Wang speculates that fear of
negative or insincerely positive
feedback holds people back from

sharing their music.
"Wouldn't it be nice if the con
ditions could be set so that you
would feel much freer about mak
ing music?" he said. "People sing
alone in the car or in the shower.
How can we get people to socially
share that?"

Current Smule app users are
already a part of Wang's strategy
to help people get over the initial
hump of making music: present
ing it as a game in an anonymous
setting.

"It's like benignly tricking
people into making music," he
said. "People may think musical
instruments are for specialists, but
everyone can play a game. Music
is human, music is social, and once
you have it, you'll want more."
Music apps are varied and
plenty, but the Smule apps stand
out because of Wang's musical
philosophy in sculpting the user
interaction. Aside from stellar
graphics and the gaming mechan
ics built into the apps, Wang also
makes sure to not shortchange

the music-making experience.
"We don't want to lose that true
expression," he said. "There's a
balance between ease of entry into
the experience and leaving enough
room for personal expression."
Drawing from that philosophy,
many Smule apps set up a balance
between the human and machine
by hinting to users how to play
certain songs, without penalizing
them for stepping outside of the
guidelines. Wang compared the
structure to "Rock Band," which
he feels is more rigid and less per
sonal. The main difference in
Smule's approach, he argued, is
that the app fully preserves the
user's music rather than encour
aging perfect imitation of a prede
termined piece of music.
Wang is also cognizant of the
dangers of instant gratification,
which technology often provides.
Mastering an instrument requires
hundreds or thousands of hours
of diligent practice, and he doesn't
want to remove the effort from
learning. He described the apps as

more like a "gateway drag" a
way to give users the feeling that
playing music is worthwhile.
"If it weren't for a vision, you
can't really justify the process of
going through it," he said. "Hope
fully we can still instill this sense
that if you put more time into it,
you can get better at it. In the end,
it's up to the person. We're just
making it easier for people to get
pumped about doing these things
in the first place,"

In addition to his work with
Smule, Wang is also involved with
computer music research at
CCRMA, where he studies new
possibilities in music due to tech
nology.
He pointed out that computer
music is not about recreating ex
isting types of music with comput
ers, and will not replace tradition
al music. Instead, the intersection
of music and technology com
bines elements of the past and fu
ture.
"There's so much room for
everything to coexist, and we con
tinue to add to the palette," Wang
said. "You need instruments and
ways to make music we've always
had."

With technology's powerful

capabilities, it presents multiple
paths for musical exploration.
One area of development is mo
bile phones.

"Hundreds of millions of
phones will be connected, and be
fore long, billions," he said. "What
kinds of new music can we make?
Can we create an instrument for a
million people to join in on and
create music meaningfully? I
don't know what that is right now,
but it was simply impossible be
fore because the technology was
n't there to support it."
This sense of uncertainty is in
herent in his research, but Wang is
driven by the belief that there is
no doubt of the need for music in
our lives. Earlier last March, fol
lowing the earthquake in Japan,
more than 3,500 users of Smule's
"Glee Karaoke" app uploaded
their versions of "Lean on Me,"
creating an international chorus
of support.
"Music is entirely different
from everything else," Wang said.
"It defies the need for logic, but
it's not illogical. It makes sense in
its own way."
