### CARA REICHARD 
Powerhouse high schools
hardly bring to mind vir
tual spaces, but an on
line high school operat
ed by Stanford could
alter that perception.
The Stanford Online High
School (OHS), previously called
the Education Program for Gifted
Youth (EPGY), was established
in 2006 and currently serves more
than 400 students, including both
full- and part-time students.
EPGY was founded to provide
classes that academically talented
students could use to supplement
their regular high school curricu
lum.
"Typically students who come
to us are students who haven't
been able to get [a] level of chal
lenge academically wherever they
have been," said Jovana Knezevic,
OHS director of information and
communication."
"It is also students for whom
this schedule is far more appeal
ing and conducive," she added.
"They have no illusions about the
amount of time they're going to
spend doing their work but at
least they can take it with them
wherever they go."
In 2006, EPGY expanded into
a fully accredited, independent
school and updated its name. The
standard class holds sessions for
two hours per week, conducted
through real-time video confer
ences. Raymond Ravaglia, the ex
ecutive director of EPGY, com
pared the classes to undergradu
ate seminars.
Students and the teachers all
log in to a central system that is
similar to the video conferencing
program Skype, adapted to a
teaching environment.
Within the video chat, there is
a whiteboard on which the
teacher and students can write.
The teacher can also upload
slides, as in a PowerPoint presen
tation. There are icons for the stu
dents to press that are the equiva
lent of raising their hands, or an
swering yes or no to a question.
Additionally, there is a text chat
that students use to make short

contributions to the class discus
sion.
"We're looking for academi
cally advanced students who are
looking for a rigorous course of
study," Ravaglia said. "The thing
they all have in common is that
they are academically advanced
[and] serious minded in their
studies."
OHS senior Nick Benson
made the decision to attend be
cause the schedule was more flex
ible and therefore better able to
accommodate his acting career.
"I've done alternative online
programs simply because I need
flexibility in school," Benson said.
"The online nature got me to look
at the school but it also seemed
like it would be a quality educa
tion."
The Stanford Online High
School emphasizes the quality of
its education, like the institution
from which it takes its name.
"Students who come and think
this is an easy alternative that
illusion is quickly dispelled,"
Knezevic said. "The work is very
hard. The students who do best
are students who are intellectual
ly curious, students who really do
like to learn."
One of the biggest differences
between an online high school
such as this one and a typical
brick-and-mortar school is the so
cial experience. Not only are all of
the classes and extracurricular ac-
