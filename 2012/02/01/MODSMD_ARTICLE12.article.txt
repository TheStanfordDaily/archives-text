## EDITORIAL The future of IHUM, breadth requirements
### 
Since 1996, the Introduction
to Humanities (IHUM)
program has been a defin
ing feature of undergraduate ed
ucation at Stanford. Disciplinary
breadth requirements have like
wise been the University's vehi
cle of encouraging students to
engage with subjects outside of
their preferred fields and to
think in ways orthogonal to how
they are accustomed. Now, the
futures of both IHUM and disci
plinary breadth requirements
are increasingly uncertain. A re
cent report to the Faculty Senate
by the Study on Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES)
has argued for replacing IHUM
with a one-quarter "Thinking
Matters" course that would be
smaller in size and not necessari
ly a humanities course. Discipli
nary breadth requirements,
meanwhile, would be replaced
by breadth requirements based
on the development of certain
skills: esthetic and interpretive
inquiry; social inquiry; scientific
analysis; formal and quantitative
reasoning; engaging difference;
moral and ethical reasoning; and
creative expression.
We applaud SUES for its re
sponsiveness to students' com
plaints about the current IHUM
and disciplinary breadth require
ments. The SUES report notes
what most students probably al
ready know: IHUM is unpopular.
While many students enjoy
IHUM, there is no hiding from
generally low course evaluation
scores and lecture attendance
numbers that can become quite
depressing by the end of the
quarter. No matter how well indi
vidual IHUM courses may be
taught, it is difficult to feed stu
dents' enthusiasm for learning in
a class they don't want to take.
Much the same arguments can be
made against the current discipli
nary breadth requirements, and
the SUES report does not hesi
tate to make them.
Nevertheless, important ques
tions remain unanswered: why
would students who dislike or fail
to engage with the IHUM re
quirement welcome a one-quar
ter "Thinking Matters" course?
Broadening the scope of the re
quirement beyond traditional
humanities material is certainly a
step toward this goal, but the
main change from before seems
to be cutting the requirement it
self from three quarters to one.
The cumulative nature of many
majors along with the stresses of

adjusting to college life can be
stressful for freshmen, and there
is certainly a case to be made for
reducing required coursework to
allow such students more time to
explore their academic and ex
tracurricular interests. Make no
mistake, the move from three
quarters to one will mark a much
greater change in the experience
of Stanford undergraduates than
whatever changes take place
within the classroom.
The change from breadth re
quirements focused on discipli
nary diversity to ones geared in
stead toward development of the
above-mentioned reasoning
styles lends itself to similar criti
cism. Will classes fulfilling the
"quantitative reasoning" or "sci
entific analysis" requirements be
substantially different from ful
filling plain-old "math" or "sci
ence" requirements? It would be
rather surprising if they were.
While it is difficult to see how this
change will substantially improve
undergraduate education, it is
also unlikely to do any harm.
Over the years, Stanford has
constantly reinvented the course
or program that is the keystone of
the freshman year academic ex
perience. The gradual shift from
the post-WWI ideal of a student
grounded in knowledge of West
ern civilization to the current sys
tem with its focus on methodolo
gy and arguments before content
represents a major shift in the
inner-workings of the classes and
a reconsideration of what society
considers important. The round
of changes proposed by SUES
looks to build on this, but only in
a minor way. While requirements
would now be explicitly based on
thinking strategies whether in
the form of the new breadth re
quirements or the "Thinking
Matters" course the focus
they epitomize has pervaded the
classroom for a long time. The
promise of the SUES recommen
dations lies in a freshman year
that affords students more time
to explore classes of their own
choosing at the expense of a two
quarter immersion within a par
ticular humanities discipline,
which currently features promi
nently in students' winter and
spring schedules. If this plan is
adopted, we hope that future ad
ministrators continue to consider
feedback and ways to improve it
in the never-ending quest to find
the best way to balance compet
ing objectives in undergraduate
education.
