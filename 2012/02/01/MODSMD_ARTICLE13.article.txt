# JOBBERISH
## Never say never 
### Amanda Ach 
I realize that I'm about to ruin
your day/week/life, but I have
to be honest with you this is
the last installment of Jobberish.
I'm sure you're devastated, and
I'm really sorry about that, but
hopefully you've at least enjoyed
learning about the incredible va
riety of jobs out there over the
past few months. Now, I feel like
I've given a pretty good range of
ideas, but let's say for a moment
that none of the jobs I've suggest
ed thus far have caught your
fancy what do you do? Turns
out, you have several options. Op
tion one, of course, is the Mrs. de
gree (Mrs., like marry someone.
Get it?). With the GSB just a few
minutes away on your bicycle,
you can be at Coupa scouting the
talent in no time. And let me add,
in the interest of being fair, that a
Mr. degree is just as valid. But if
that doesn't sound like an intel
lectually fulfilling lifestyle, you
have another option make up
your own job, which is this week's
topic.
No, this isn't a cop-out because
I couldn't think of any more cre
ative jobs (okay, maybe a little).
As much as I find the various jobs
I've suggested interesting, I know
that none of them are right for me
well, with the exception of the
boner one, perhaps. Still, the fact
of the matter is, even with so
many wonderful and sometimes
bizarre careers out there, there's a
chance your dream job doesn't
exist... yet.
As you can tell from the dra
matic ellipsis placement, "yet" is
the operative word here. It's okay
if there are no jobs out there for
you right now, because you can
make one for yourself. Countless
super-successful people have done
this, and there's no reason why you
can't do it, too. In fact, most of the
people we consider most success
ful in our society have done this in
one way or another. They knew
what they wanted to do and made
it happen. I mean, Oprah doesn't
have a job title she's Oprah.
Surprisingly, even with the
economy the way it is, this kind of
entrepreneurship is in style. Gen
eration Y is quickly becoming
known as the start-up generation
and, as I learned very early on in
life, if everyone else is doing some
thing, you probably should, too.

But in all seriousness, start-ups and
other entrepreneurial ventures are
apparently good for the economy,
and while it's definitely the riskiest
career option I've presented, it has
arguably the highest potential re
ward.
Embarking on this kind of ad
venture in this economy might
seem intimidating, but a recession is
actually not a bad time to start
something new. And if anyone can
do it, it's one of us I mean, we go
to Stanford. We're smart and hard
working (and some of us are also
funny and cute to boot!). We're
going to be successful, and there's
no reason why we can't be success
ful at something brand new.
The point is, if you can't find a
job out there that you're excited
about, make one for yourself! Fig
ure out what you love to do, and
then start thinking about how to
turn that passion into a career, and
just as importantly, into money. It's
no secret that the people who are
happiest are the ones who do what
they love for a living, so why not at
least try to make that happen for
you? After all, it's only your life
we're talking about here.
For fear of sounding like one of
those tacky motivational posters
they have in elementary school
classrooms, I'll avoid telling you to
believe in yourself and never give

up on your dreams. That's been
done. But what I will say, and what
I hope my columns have showed, is
that you should let yourself be
open to the idea of an unconven
tional career path. There is nothing
wrong with pursuing your dream of
becoming a doctor or a lawyer, but
there's no point in forcing yourself
down a path you don't want be
cause it seems like a safe choice.
There are so many exciting possi
bilities out there, and I know that if
you look around enough, you'll
find or create the job you're
looking for.

then start thinking about how to
turn that passion into a career, and
just as importantly, into money. It's
no secret that the people who are
happiest are the ones who do what
they love for a living, so why not at
least try to make that happen for
you? After all, it's only your life
we're talking about here.
For fear of sounding like one of
those tacky motivational posters
they have in elementary school
classrooms, I'll avoid telling you to
believe in yourself and never give

up on your dreams. That's been
done. But what I will say, and what
I hope my columns have showed, is
that you should let yourself be
open to the idea of an unconven
tional career path. There is nothing
wrong with pursuing your dream of
becoming a doctor or a lawyer, but
there's no point in forcing yourself
down a path you don't want be
cause it seems like a safe choice.
There are so many exciting possi
bilities out there, and I know that if
you look around enough, you'll
find or create the job you're
looking for.

I realize that I'm about to ruin
your day/week/life, but I have
to be honest with you this is
the last installment of Jobberish.
I'm sure you're devastated, and
I'm really sorry about that, but
hopefully you've at least enjoyed
learning about the incredible va
riety of jobs out there over the
past few months. Now, I feel like
I've given a pretty good range of
ideas, but let's say for a moment
that none of the jobs I've suggest
ed thus far have caught your
fancy what do you do? Turns
out, you have several options. Op
tion one, of course, is the Mrs. de
gree (Mrs., like marry someone.
Get it?). With the GSB just a few
minutes away on your bicycle,
you can be at Coupa scouting the
talent in no time. And let me add,
in the interest of being fair, that a
Mr. degree is just as valid. But if
that doesn't sound like an intel
lectually fulfilling lifestyle, you
have another option make up
your own job, which is this week's
topic.
No, this isn't a cop-out because
I couldn't think of any more cre
ative jobs (okay, maybe a little).
As much as I find the various jobs
I've suggested interesting, I know
that none of them are right for me
well, with the exception of the
boner one, perhaps. Still, the fact
of the matter is, even with so
many wonderful and sometimes
bizarre careers out there, there's a
chance your dream job doesn't
exist... yet.
As you can tell from the dra
matic ellipsis placement, "yet" is
the operative word here. It's okay
if there are no jobs out there for
you right now, because you can
make one for yourself. Countless
super-successful people have done
this, and there's no reason why you
can't do it, too. In fact, most of the
people we consider most success
ful in our society have done this in
one way or another. They knew
what they wanted to do and made
it happen. I mean, Oprah doesn't
have a job title she's Oprah.
Surprisingly, even with the
economy the way it is, this kind of
entrepreneurship is in style. Gen
eration Y is quickly becoming
known as the start-up generation
and, as I learned very early on in
life, if everyone else is doing some
thing, you probably should, too.

But in all seriousness, start-ups and
other entrepreneurial ventures are
apparently good for the economy,
and while it's definitely the riskiest
career option I've presented, it has
arguably the highest potential re
ward.
Embarking on this kind of ad
venture in this economy might
seem intimidating, but a recession is
actually not a bad time to start
something new. And if anyone can
do it, it's one of us I mean, we go
to Stanford. We're smart and hard
working (and some of us are also
funny and cute to boot!). We're
going to be successful, and there's
no reason why we can't be success
ful at something brand new.
The point is, if you can't find a
job out there that you're excited
about, make one for yourself! Fig
ure out what you love to do, and
then start thinking about how to
turn that passion into a career, and
just as importantly, into money. It's
no secret that the people who are
happiest are the ones who do what
they love for a living, so why not at
least try to make that happen for
you? After all, it's only your life
we're talking about here.
