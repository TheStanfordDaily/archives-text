# ON THE MARGINS, BETWEEN THE LINES
## Attrition of women from techie majors 
### Jamie Solomon 
My mother is a structural
engineer; my dad is a
computer scientist. When
I entered Stanford, I was sure I
was going to be techie. I didn't
know what I wanted to major in
(although science seemed like a
good bet), so I started off my
freshman year with all of the in
troductory math and science
classes I could take. Now, five
years later, I've ended up with a
degree in ... sociology.
How did that happen? I wish I
could say it was because I discov
ered this great new field I never
knew existed and fell in love with
it. Although I have enjoyed my
major, the truth is that in many
ways I'm a sociology major be
cause I got too fed up with techie
classes to major in them.
Despite jumping into techie
courses with much enthusiasm
freshman year, I soon came to re
alize that the classes themselves
were just not that enjoyable. I fre
quently encountered professors

whose English I could not under
stand and who lacked the ability
to command a classroom or ex
plain concepts at a student's level.
I disliked feeling like just a num
ber in a class, the inaccessibility of
the professors and most of all, the
tests designed to produce an av
erage grade of 40 percent so that
everyone feels as though he or
she has failed.
For me, the kid who adored
calculus in high school and who
spent a summer taking physics be
cause she was sad she didn't have
time to take it in high school, this
was a problem. I love learning and
I love going to school, so my col
lege years just seemed too pre
cious to be spent in classes that I
didn't enjoy. I fled from these un
satisfying courses and found a
human-centered, student-cen
tered department in which I could
actively enjoy my education.
In and of itself, this story of
how I chose my major holds little
significance. However, when

looked at in light of national
trends, I am one of millions of
women who have opted out of
science, technology, engineering
and math (STEM) fields. This
phenomenon is often called the
"leaky pipeline" to describe the
way that women and non-Asian
minorities drop out of these
fields at greater rates than white
and Asian men at every educa
tional and professional level. The
problem is that this attrition is
not due to skill or competence;
women who drop out of STEM
majors earn equivalent grades to
men who decide to stay in those
majors. This means that STEM
fields, often heralded as the sec
tor most important for economic
growth in the United States, are
losing out on a number of talent
ed women and minorities and the
innovations that they may bring
to these fields. For Stanford, this
is especially troubling because
the alumni who bring the most
prestige and donate the most

money to the school are often
techies. By driving women away
from techie fields, we are reduc
ing both the future earning
power of alumni and publicity for
the school.
There have been many studies
that address the problem of how
to keep women in STEM majors
in college and a large number of
them propose solutions that
had they already been imple
mented at Stanford would
have made a difference in my ed
ucational journey. Many of the
solutions suggest altering peda
gogical methods in ways that
make classes more accessible to
women. Group work, female TAs
and examples of women and mi
norities making a difference in
their field all help reduce the feel
ing of tokenism. Interactive class
es with hands-on work and an
emphasis on the applicability and
potential social impacts of the
material help to sustain interest
and make classes more enjoyable.

Personal interaction with profes
sors and re-tooling weeder class
es can counter attrition due to
low self-confidence. Women
often believe that they are doing
worse than the average student in
STEM classes a perception
that has no correlation to their ac
tual performance. This is especial

I disliked feeling
like just a number
in a class.
