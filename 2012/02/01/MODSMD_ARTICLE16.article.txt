## SIGN ON THE LINE CARD HOPES TO INK TOP RECRUITS 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
On Wednesday, the nation's best high school
football recruits will sign on the dotted line and
commit themselves to the top programs in the
country and four of the nation's best recruits
could take their talents to the Farm, including the
nation's top quarterback prospect.
Head coach David Shaw and the Stanford
coaching staff have already inked 10 four-star re
cruits in the 2012 recruiting class, and are in the
running to sign four five-star recruits on Wednes
day.
Jameis Winston, a five-star quarterback from
Hueytown, Ala., who is rated as the best quarter
back in the nation, could be the biggest recruit to
join the Cardinal in years. Although Winston is
currently committed to Florida State, he recently
hinted that he could change his mind since learn
ing of his acceptance to Stanford. Winston is the
nation's lOth-best overall prospect according to
Rivals.com, and would provide a major boost to a
team that will be looking for a replacement for
Andrew Luck.
In addition to the Cardinal possibly finding a
successor to Luck, it could also score several big
commitments that could help replace NFL-bound
linemen Jonathan Martin and David DeCastro.
Kyle Murphy, a five-star offensive tackle from San
Clemente, Calif., has narrowed his choices down
to USC and Stanford, and has said that the oppor
tunity to step into either Jonathan Martin or Matt
Kalil's spot right away will be the major determin
ing factor in where he ends up. Murphy, who is 6-
foot-7,275 pounds, is the nation's third-best offen
sive lineman and the 19th-best prospect in the
country.
Andrus Peat, the nation's sixth-best offensive
line prospect, could also be headed to Palo Alto.
Peat, a 6-foot-7,305-pound behemoth from Tempe,
Ariz., will choose between Stanford, Nebraska,
