## SIGN ON THE LINE CARD HOPES TO INK TOP RECRUITS 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
On Wednesday, the nation's best high school
football recruits will sign on the dotted line and
commit themselves to the top programs in the
country and four of the nation's best recruits
could take their talents to the Farm, including the
nation's top quarterback prospect.
Head coach David Shaw and the Stanford
coaching staff have already inked 10 four-star re
cruits in the 2012 recruiting class, and are in the
running to sign four five-star recruits on Wednes
day.
Jameis Winston, a five-star quarterback from
Hueytown, Ala., who is rated as the best quarter
back in the nation, could be the biggest recruit to
join the Cardinal in years. Although Winston is
currently committed to Florida State, he recently
hinted that he could change his mind since learn
ing of his acceptance to Stanford. Winston is the
nation's lOth-best overall prospect according to
Rivals.com, and would provide a major boost to a
team that will be looking for a replacement for
Andrew Luck.
In addition to the Cardinal possibly finding a
successor to Luck, it could also score several big
commitments that could help replace NFL-bound
linemen Jonathan Martin and David DeCastro.
Kyle Murphy, a five-star offensive tackle from San
Clemente, Calif., has narrowed his choices down
to USC and Stanford, and has said that the oppor
tunity to step into either Jonathan Martin or Matt
Kalil's spot right away will be the major determin
ing factor in where he ends up. Murphy, who is 6-
foot-7,275 pounds, is the nation's third-best offen
sive lineman and the 19th-best prospect in the
country.
Andrus Peat, the nation's sixth-best offensive
line prospect, could also be headed to Palo Alto.

Ariz., will choose between Stanford, Nebraska,

Florida State and USC on
Wednesday. Peat's older brother,
Todd Peat Jr., is a defensive tackle
for the Cornhuskers, and conse
quently, the Huskers are likely the
frontrunner for the younger Peat's
talents.
Nabbing Peat would be a huge
coup for the Cardinal, but should
Murphy and Peat both come to
Stanford, the Cardinal would po
tentially have the nation's best
group of offensive linemen in the
country. Stanford already has
four four-star offensive line
prospects committed for next
season, including Joshua Garnett,
the nation's 33rd-best prospect
and second-best guard.
The Cardinal could also add
depth along the defensive line
should Aziz Shittu, a defensive
end from Atwater, Calif., pick the
Cardinal over California, USC
and UCLA. Shittu verbally com
mitted to Stanford in April 2011,
then backed off his commitment
in June, but has still consistently
listed the Cardinal as one of his
top choices. Shittu's top two
choices are most likely Stanford
and USC, as Cal has been steadi
ly losing commitments over the
past few weeks after the Bears
underwent major changes to their

coaching staff. Shittu is the na
tion's third-best defensive end
prospect.
Currently, Stanford has the na
tion's 16th-best class, just behind
Pac-12 foes USC and UCLA,
whose classes are ranked 11th
and 13th, respectively, and just
ahead of Oregon, who has the
country's 17th-best class.
Should any or all of these four
five-star prospects decide to
bring their talents to Palo Alto,
the Cardinal could end up with
one of the nation's top 10 recruit
ing classes, and the best recruiting
class in the school's history.
