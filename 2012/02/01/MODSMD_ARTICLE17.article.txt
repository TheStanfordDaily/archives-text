# SWINGING INTO SPRING
## 
### AUSTIN BLOCK 
Last spring, the Stanford men's
golf team saw its season end in dis
appointment. Four years removed
from a national championship,
and three years after finishing as
the nation's runner-up, the Cardi
nal finished sixth in the NCAA
Central Regionals last year. In a
tournament that saw the top five
teams move on to the NCAA
Championship, the Cardinal,

seeded fourth heading into the
tournament, stayed home.
But if the fall season is any indi
cation, the Cardinal will not falter
again this spring. In its first tourna
ment of the fall, the team dominat
ed a strong field, winning the
Olympia Fields/Fighting Illini In
vitational by 16 shots. Freshman
Patrick Rodgers stormed onto the
college golf scene, shooting 68-70-
68 to win the individual title in his
first intercollegiate competition.

Close behind were teammates
junior Andrew Yun and sopho
more Cameron Wilson, who fin
ished third and fourth, respective
ly-
Three weeks later, the Cardi
nal, then ranked No. 1 in the na
tion, took third place at The Pres
tige tournament in Palm Springs.
Although the Cardinal cooled off
in its next few tournaments, team
captain Wilson Bowen is con
vinced that the team is ready to
make a statement this spring.
"We kind of showed everyone
right off the bat that we're the
team to beat, so that was good,"
Bowen, a senior, said. "It was a
good start and then kind of disap
pointing the way we played the
last three tournaments, but I think
we'll learn from the experience."
"Any time you go out [and] you
don't play well, as long as you
learn from it, it can be a positive,"
he added. "So I think we're going
to draw on that and go forward
and have a great spring."
Currently ranked No. 7 in the
nation, the team is loaded with tal
ent and has been boosted by three
strong freshmen Rodgers,
Patrick Grimes and Marcel Puyat.
Rodgers, who recently played on
the U.S.Walker Cup team, has yet
to finish outside the top 10 in a col
lege tournament and is ranked No.
4 in the country as an individual.
He has compiled a gaudy 70.5
scoring average through four tour
naments and will play in the
team's No. 1 slot in the upcoming
University of Hawaii-Hilo tourna
ment.
Senior captain David Chung is
also projected to have a solid year.
In 2010, Chung won the Western
Amateur and the Porter Cup be
fore finishing second in the U.S.
Amateur. He went on to earn
spots in the 2011 Masters and U.S.
Open tournaments.
Wilson, junior Steve Kearney
and Yun, a 2010-2011 PING Ail-
American who collected seven
top-10 finishes last year, round out
the team's lineup for the UH-Hilo
tournament.
"This first event of the new
year is a big one," head coach Con
rad Ray said. "There's [sic] a lot of
teams from all over the country
that will be there, teams that we'll
eventually have to come up
against if we want to win the
championship this year."

Senior captain David Chung and the No. 7 Stanford men's golf team are
looking to follow up on a strong fall campaign this spring, beginning with
the University of Hawaii-Hilo tournament, which tees off today.
Ray added that most of all, the
team needs to work on its consis
tency. Bowen emphasized the im
portance of getting into a winning
habit and peaking at the right
time.
"One of the key things for us is
to start winning tournaments, be
cause it's going to be evidence to
us that we're putting the time in
on the right things and practicing
correctly," Bowen said.
"I think when we won our last
national championship in [2007]
we won like six or seven times
during the year," he added.
"When you are in a pressure situ
ation [and] you have to make par
on the last hole to win, or you have
to make a birdie, you have the
confidence that you can do that
because you've done it before.
You can draw on that previous ex
perience."
Adding to the Cardinal's
bright outlook for the season is
the fact that the team will play this
year's NCAA Regional at the
Stanford Golf Course. Aided by
home-course advantage, the Car
dinal can count on familiarity and

fans in its bid for a berth to the
NCAA Championship, which will
be held at Riviera Country Club
in Los Angeles.
"We can go all the way for
sure," Bowen said. "We have an
unbelievably talented team. We
won our first event at Olympia
Fields this year by a bunch of
strokes over one of the best fields
in the country, so anytime you can
do that, you obviously have a
great chance to win a national
title. So that's our goal, that's what
we're going to work towards all
spring, and then I think we'll be
ready come June."
Ray is equally enthusiastic
about the team's national title
hopes, but recognizes that June is
still several months, and many
tournaments, away.

"I'm excited about our
chances," Ray said. "There's so
much that needs to happen before
we can really get to the ultimate
prize, but we have a competitive
team, we have some depth, we
have a good schedule lined up, the
guys are a close-knit group, which
always helps ... We feel like we
have a chance, and at the end of
the day, that's all you can really
ask for."
