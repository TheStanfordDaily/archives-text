# Less BCS, more Super Bowl
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
The Super Bowl is sup
posed to be the pinnacle of
sporting events. It's the
best of the best a day
for all of us regular folks to
pig out on millions of pounds of
wings, chips, pizza, pasta, soda and
everything else that will ensure we
become diabetics by age 40.
And much like the Madden
curse, the ratings border on mythi
cal. Many of the most-watched tele
vision programs or events in U.S.
history are Super Bowls, led by last
year's Super Bowl XLV, which drew
an average audience of 111 million
viewers according to Nielsen.
Once again, the event is upon us
if you are able to sort through the
weeks of media days, interviews,
analysis and hoopla that the NFL
has taken to dumping on the gener
al public in the two-week gap be
tween the conference champi
onships and the game itself
All of this hype, however, got me
thinking about just how great the
Super Bowl is because of what it
stands for: a do-or-die chance at
glory, nearly unduplicated any
where across the American sports
landscape.
I'm a baseball fanatic, and will
defend the game to my grave be
cause I love watching my team
and pretty much any team every
night from April until October. But
the playoff series are best-of-five or
best-of-seven affairs, with plenty of
chances for a team to lose a game
here and there but still win the
crown.
The same is true of basketball,
with the NBA being an even worse
offender because it drags its playoffs
out for more than a month before

crowning a champion.
The genius of the Super Bowl
lies in having one game that means
so much, but only after a regular
season and playoff system that is
designed to weed out non-con
tenders.
Which brings me to the Bowl
Championship Series.
Yes, you got me I'm a BCS
hater.
And while the college football
season may be on hiatus right now
although tomorrow's National
Signing Day is arguably one of the
most important 24-hour periods of
the entire college season and could
mean big things for the Stanford
program if a couple of recruits de
cide to come to the Farm I can't
help but think about how badly the
BCS is failing us in the face of the
Super Bowl's success.
The BCS is supposed to give us
the same kind of winner-takes-all
sweepstakes that keeps us glued to
our television sets for hours of
pregame, postgame, in-game, out
of-game, super-game, sub-game
and sideways-game analysis. Poten
tially hilarious commercials
notwithstanding, people tune in be
cause they know there will be an
undisputed champion clutching
that Lombardi Trophy at the end of
the night, and no computers' or
pollsters' opinions can get in the
way of what happens on the field.
If only the BCS could be so wise.
Instead, we get a mess of a col
lege football season that has a mil
lion exciting and amazing games
that ultimately may end up mean

ing nothing because a machine does
not like how a particular school has
set up its schedule in a particular
year even if that schedule was al
most certainly decided at least five
years prior.
Wouldn't it be nice if we could
be upset that Stanford's loss to
Oklahoma State cost us a shot at the
national championship game in
stead of just being a chance for igno
rant fans to rip into Jordan
Williamson? Sure, it might hurt
more, but I think there would cer
tainly be more value in at least some
kind of playoff or plus-one format
that could make the college football
season's "Super Bowl" more like a
Super Bowl.
Yes, No. 1 Alabama tore up No. 2
LSU, and I guess since they beat the
Tigers earlier this season that
makes them the best team in the
country. Except that didn't happen.
The season series finished at an un
satisfying 1-1, while Oklahoma
State and other suitors like the Car
dinal were left clamoring for more,
I know that the bowl system is
based on money, and I know that
the BCS has a vice-like grip over the
chancellors of many of the most
powerful football schools in the
country. But maybe, just maybe, one
of them will be watching Tom Brady
go to work on Sunday afternoon
and think to himself, "You know,
they might be onto something here
with this playoff thing."
Until then, I'm off to Jetblue
Park at Fenway South.
