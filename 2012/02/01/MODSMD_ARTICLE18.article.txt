# Less BCS, more Super Bowl

The Super Bowl is sup
posed to be the pinnacle of
sporting events. It's the
best of the best a day
for all of us regular folks to
pig out on millions of pounds of
wings, chips, pizza, pasta, soda and
everything else that will ensure we
become diabetics by age 40.
And much like the Madden
curse, the ratings border on mythi
cal. Many of the most-watched tele
vision programs or events in U.S.
history are Super Bowls, led by last
year's Super Bowl XLV, which drew
an average audience of 111 million
viewers according to Nielsen.
Once again, the event is upon us
if you are able to sort through the
weeks of media days, interviews,
analysis and hoopla that the NFL
has taken to dumping on the gener
al public in the two-week gap be
tween the conference champi
onships and the game itself
All of this hype, however, got me
thinking about just how great the
Super Bowl is because of what it
stands for: a do-or-die chance at
glory, nearly unduplicated any
where across the American sports
landscape.
I'm a baseball fanatic, and will
defend the game to my grave be
cause I love watching my team
and pretty much any team every
night from April until October. But
the playoff series are best-of-five or
best-of-seven affairs, with plenty of
chances for a team to lose a game
here and there but still win the
crown.
The same is true of basketball,
with the NBA being an even worse
offender because it drags its playoffs
out for more than a month before
