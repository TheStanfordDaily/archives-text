## iDedare showcases majors Sophomore class presidents deem program 'successful' 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's second iDeclare
week, an event series designed to
assist sophomores with the
process of declaring a major, took
place last week from Jan. 23 to
Jan. 27.

The week included a range of
events geared toward offering the
Class of 2014 resources and infor
mation about potential major
tracks and requirements.
"This year's week was high
lighted by a Sophomore Faculty
Dinner featuring President Hen
nessy to kick it off, a "Faculty
Meet Fourteen" event on Tuesday
and an alumni panel featuring
Time Magazine columnist Joel
Stein on Friday," said Dhruv
Amin 'l4, a sophomore class co
president. Other events in the
program included a senior-sopho
more mentorship program as well
as internship and research work
shops.
Phounsouk Sivilay 'l4, sopho
more class co-president, said that
attendance at the events, while
difficult to assess accurately, was
generally impressive. Sivilay cited
the over-attendance at interview
workshops and alumni panels as
evidence of sophomore interest in
the week's programming.
"The kickoff Sophomore Fac
ulty Dinner featuring President
Hennessy was definitely the most
popular event," Amin said, noting
that the allocation of 300 student
seats was filled within 90 minutes
of sending out the RSVP link.
That response was "faster than
the past three years this event has
been thrown," Amin said.
In addition to President Hen
nessy's opening remarks, Sivilay
noted the presence of Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Edu
cation Flarry Elam and three fac
ulty Nobel Laureates at the event.
All of the University's depart
ments were invited for the week's
events, and those departments
that decided to hold open houses
during the week were wrapped up
