## iDedare showcases majors Sophomore class presidents deem program 'successful' 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's second iDeclare
week, an event series designed to
assist sophomores with the
process of declaring a major, took
place last week from Jan. 23 to
Jan. 27.

The week included a range of
events geared toward offering the
Class of 2014 resources and infor
mation about potential major
tracks and requirements.
"This year's week was high
lighted by a Sophomore Faculty
Dinner featuring President Hen
nessy to kick it off, a "Faculty
Meet Fourteen" event on Tuesday
and an alumni panel featuring
Time Magazine columnist Joel
Stein on Friday," said Dhruv
Amin 'l4, a sophomore class co
president. Other events in the
program included a senior-sopho
more mentorship program as well
as internship and research work
shops.
Phounsouk Sivilay 'l4, sopho
more class co-president, said that
attendance at the events, while
difficult to assess accurately, was
generally impressive. Sivilay cited
the over-attendance at interview
workshops and alumni panels as
evidence of sophomore interest in
the week's programming.
"The kickoff Sophomore Fac
ulty Dinner featuring President
Hennessy was definitely the most
popular event," Amin said, noting
that the allocation of 300 student
seats was filled within 90 minutes
of sending out the RSVP link.
That response was "faster than
the past three years this event has
been thrown," Amin said.
In addition to President Hen
nessy's opening remarks, Sivilay
noted the presence of Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Edu
cation Flarry Elam and three fac
ulty Nobel Laureates at the event.
All of the University's depart
ments were invited for the week's
events, and those departments
that decided to hold open houses
during the week were wrapped up
into the rest of the iDeclare
events.
"I feel that we had a good bal
ance [of departments]," Sivilay
said. "We did provide the oppor
tunity for any department that
wanted to be involved to get in
volved."
Sivilay commented that this
year's iDeclare week marked sig
nificantly closer collaboration
with other University institutions,
such as The Stanford Fund and
Undergraduate Advising and Re
search, than last year's event. He
credited the larger budget avail
able to iDeclare organizers as
contributing to the week's en
hanced impact on sophomores,
citing the increased access to in
formation offered by iDeclare
pamphlets and online resources.
Sivilay added that the cost of
the week was largely borne by the
sophomore class presidency's
partnerships with University in
stitutions and academic depart
ments.
"It was a collaboration," said
Ashley Williams 'l4, a sophomore
class cabinet member. "We had
our initial ideas of what our peers
thought would be helpful and
useful, and we worked with the
other parties and incorporated
what they thought would be ben

eficial."
The week's timing in winter
rather than in the fall or spring
when sophomores traditionally
declare their major is deliber
ate, Amin said.
"In the fall, students are just
beginning to search for a major
and may still not have experience
with multiple departments yet,"
he said. "In the spring, most stu
dents are ready to declare and
having a week of information
about the various departments
would no longer be useful."
Sivilay added that, in addition
to assisting sophomores with
finding information about vari
ous majors, iDeclare is intended
to help sophomores plan ahead.
"This week is meant to inform
you and give you access to all
these resources, and allow you to
be ahead on things that you don't
know that you'll need yet," Sivilay
said.
Reflecting on the week, Sivilay
noted that the iDeclare program
still has potential for growth
through incorporating more de
partments into the event series.
He remained positive, however,
about the week's impact on soph
omores.
"I think it was a very successful
event," Sivilay said. "The people
who attended the events found
them extremely valuable and in
formative."

wanted to be involved to get in
volved."
Sivilay commented that this
year's iDeclare week marked sig
nificantly closer collaboration
with other University institutions,
such as The Stanford Fund and
Undergraduate Advising and Re
search, than last year's event. He
credited the larger budget avail
able to iDeclare organizers as
contributing to the week's en
hanced impact on sophomores,
citing the increased access to in
formation offered by iDeclare
pamphlets and online resources.
Sivilay added that the cost of
the week was largely borne by the
sophomore class presidency's
partnerships with University in
stitutions and academic depart
ments.
"It was a collaboration," said
Ashley Williams 'l4, a sophomore
class cabinet member. "We had
our initial ideas of what our peers
thought would be helpful and
useful, and we worked with the
other parties and incorporated
what they thought would be ben

eficial."
The week's timing in winter
rather than in the fall or spring
when sophomores traditionally
declare their major is deliber
ate, Amin said.
"In the fall, students are just
beginning to search for a major
and may still not have experience
with multiple departments yet,"
he said. "In the spring, most stu
dents are ready to declare and
having a week of information
about the various departments
would no longer be useful."
Sivilay added that, in addition
to assisting sophomores with
finding information about vari
ous majors, iDeclare is intended
to help sophomores plan ahead.
"This week is meant to inform
you and give you access to all
these resources, and allow you to
be ahead on things that you don't
know that you'll need yet," Sivilay
said.
Reflecting on the week, Sivilay
noted that the iDeclare program
still has potential for growth
through incorporating more de
partments into the event series.
He remained positive, however,
about the week's impact on soph
omores.
"I think it was a very successful
event," Sivilay said. "The people
who attended the events found
them extremely valuable and in
formative."
