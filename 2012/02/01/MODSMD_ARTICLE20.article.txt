# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Diving in with Kiley Neushul 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's water
polo team is coming off an NCAA
title and is currently ranked No. 1
in the country. Freshman driver
Kiley Neushul who had hat
tricks in back-to-back games over
the weekend sat down with The
Daily to talk all things Stanford, in
and out of the water.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
were your expectations going into
this season?
Kiley Neushul: Coming in, espe
cially with the quality of my re
cruiting class, the goal for the sea
son is to take each game as it
comes. We have to remember that
we are a team and we need to play
as a team. I think especially for the
players returning, we know we're
a very good team and are seeded
first going into the season, and
even though we'll be missing play
ers going to the Olympics, we are
looking to win a national champi
onship.
TSD: What was it about Stanford
that made you choose to come
here over someplace closer to
home, or at UC-Santa Barbara
where your mom is now the
coach?
KN: I think I decided I wanted to
go to Stanford in seventh grade
when I saw them play in Santa
Barbara, my hometown. Ironical
ly, [Stanford assistant coach]
Susan Ortwein was my babysitter
when I was younger, but that did
n't really have anything to do with
me coming here. Really, you just
can't find anything like this any
where else. I was initially deciding
between UCSB and Stanford.
Then my dad said I would have to
live in my room at home if I went
to UCSB, so I said no way. But I
felt pretty much all along that if I
got into Stanford, I was coming
here. Other schools had a lot to
offer, but I feel like I've been on
this team since I started playing
water polo. It's a very good fit for
me both academically and athleti
cally.
TSD: What is your favorite part
about being on the Farm?
KN: I'd have to say it's just been
meeting so many amazing people
in my dorm, in my classes; on the

water polo team I've gotten close
with a lot of the girls. And it was
kind of unexpected. I grew up in a
college town, and I wasn't expect
ing it to be like this. Everyone's
just so nice here, and sometimes it
makes doing school work hard.
But you're at Stanford so you have
to get your stuff done, even though
I do procrastinate occasionally.

TSD: How has the transition been
for you going from high school to
college polo?
KN: I came from a water polo
background, my mom taught me
how to play, she's been my coach
since forever. But I played a very
free style of water polo, very loose
without all that much of a specific
plan. Coming here, I thought it was
going to be much more structured,
like the national team is, but Stan
ford I've found really is not and
you can be very innovative on the
team. And that's what I was most
concerned about, not being able to
play how I wanted to play. And the
coaches have made it clear I can do
that, which has made the transition
much easier.
TSD: What was it like to suit up
and jump in the pool for your first
match with the Cardinal?
KN: I was expecting a close game,
we were playing [Loyola Mary
mount University], and they've
made it to the final four in NCAAs
before, so I prepared really heavily.
I was just really excited, I mean,
I've been dreaming of wearing this
Stanford cap since I was in seventh
grade. And then we got in the
water; I didn't know how things
were going to be. It was just fun. I
had a good time. Even though we

won by a few more than I expect
ed, it was really amazing.

TSD: I know you've said you like
to play golf. What intrigued you
about such an individual sport?

KN: I played golf for two years in
high school, and I didn't really like
it. It was more of a humbler. I was
bad. I was not good at golf when I
first started. My parents really
wanted me to fail at something. My
freshman year I didn't play in any
matches, and then as a sophomore
I opened the season as a starter,
and our team hadn't lost in 112
matches and we lost that first
match of the season. It taught me
to be levelheaded, and was really
preparation for what was to come.
But yeah, I definitely failed at golf
for a long time.
TSD: What are your goals in water
polo?
KN: I used to really want to go to
the Olympics, that was my goal. I
still do, but I'm focusing mainly just
on the now. Playing at Stanford is so
much fun, and I don't want to really
take things too fast, I kind of want to
just progress as I'm here, and we
will see what happens. The
Olympics is obviously the goal of
many water polo players and if that
goal presents itself, then yes, I would
love to go to the Olympics, but it's
been tough so far in that regard.
TSD: How did it feel getting your
first collegiate award as Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation New
comer of the Week?
KN: It's always nice to be recog
nized for that, for my play, knowing
that I worked really hard, but it
should really be a team award.
Water polo is a team sport, and I'm
pushed every day in practice. In the
water, I'm not the one passing my
self the ball or getting open for a
shot, so that really is an award for
the entire team.
TSD: Best place to eat on campus,
and what is your go-to meal?
KN: I'd sayTressider and that salad
place [in Union Square], And the
southwestern chicken salad is real
ly good when they make it fresh for
you [laughing], I get that on Mon
days and Wednesdays after my
psych lecture.
