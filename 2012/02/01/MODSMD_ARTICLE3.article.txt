# Debate continues for PAUSD
## District hosts board meeting to discuss 'achievement gap' 
### SARAH MOORE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At Tuesday night's Palo Alto
Unified School District
(PAUSD) meeting, the district
board continued its discussion of
an achievement gap at the dis
trict's two high schools, compar
ing minority student perform

ance with that of white and Asian
American students.

The board also hosted the
high schools' principals Tuesday
morning to hear their "High
School Single Plans for Student
Achievement." Themes ad
dressed at the meeting included
social health and academic inter
vention.

"We have a challenge when it
conies to achievement of kids
with different racial and ethnic
backgrounds," PAUSD Superin
tendent Kevin Skelly said.
"We've discussed the issue many,
many times, so this meeting pro
vides one other way to look at it."

As a whole, African American
and Hispanic PAUSD high

school students are currently
scoring worse and meeting fewer
graduation requirements than
their white and Asian American
peers.

Skelly refuted the idea that
the system has become bifurcat
ed, noting that both students of
color and non-minority students
have access to the same unique
advantages in their school dis
trict.

The district's graduating class
of 2011 self-identified as 57 per
cent white, 29 percent Asian
American, eight percent Hispan
ic, two percent African American
and four percent students of a
separate racial category.

The students who did not
meet the A-G Requirements nec
essary to be eligible for admis
sion to a University of California
(UC) were 51 percent white, 12
percent Asian American, 23 per
cent Hispanic and 10 percent
African American. Students of a
separate racial category formed
the only group that held a con
stant rate at four percent.
A-G requirements include
two years of history or social sci
ence, four years of English, three
years of mathematics, two years
of laboratory science, two years
of a language other than English,
one year of visual and perform
ing arts and one year of an elec
tive. All classes must be at the col
