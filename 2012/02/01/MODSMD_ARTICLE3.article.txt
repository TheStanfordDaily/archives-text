# Debate continues for PAUSD
## District hosts board meeting to discuss 'achievement gap' 
### SARAH MOORE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At Tuesday night's Palo Alto
Unified School District
(PAUSD) meeting, the district
board continued its discussion of
an achievement gap at the dis
trict's two high schools, compar
ing minority student perform

ance with that of white and Asian
American students.

The board also hosted the
high schools' principals Tuesday
morning to hear their "High
School Single Plans for Student
Achievement." Themes ad
dressed at the meeting included
social health and academic inter
vention.

"We have a challenge when it
conies to achievement of kids
with different racial and ethnic
backgrounds," PAUSD Superin
tendent Kevin Skelly said.
"We've discussed the issue many,
many times, so this meeting pro
vides one other way to look at it."

As a whole, African American
and Hispanic PAUSD high

school students are currently
scoring worse and meeting fewer
graduation requirements than
their white and Asian American
peers.

Skelly refuted the idea that
the system has become bifurcat
ed, noting that both students of
color and non-minority students
have access to the same unique
advantages in their school dis
trict.

The district's graduating class
of 2011 self-identified as 57 per
cent white, 29 percent Asian
American, eight percent Hispan
ic, two percent African American
and four percent students of a
separate racial category.

The students who did not
meet the A-G Requirements nec
essary to be eligible for admis
sion to a University of California
(UC) were 51 percent white, 12
percent Asian American, 23 per
cent Hispanic and 10 percent
African American. Students of a
separate racial category formed
the only group that held a con
stant rate at four percent.
A-G requirements include
two years of history or social sci
ence, four years of English, three
years of mathematics, two years
of laboratory science, two years
of a language other than English,
one year of visual and perform
ing arts and one year of an elec
tive. All classes must be at the col

lege preparatory level to fulfill re
quirements.

Last spring, Skelly proposed
modifying some of the district's
graduation requirements to align
with standards for UCs and Cali
fornia State Universities. The cur
rent PAUSD graduation require
ments that would be affected are
those for two years of mathemat
ics, two years of science (not nec
essarily laboratory science) and
one year of either foreign lan
guage orvisual or performing arts.
At last night's meeting, Skelly
presented a PowerPoint entitled
"Graduation Requirements: Pre
liminary Thinking on a New Ap
proach," outlining his proposal
and the rationale behind it. He
also presented "Algebra II Per
formance and Learning," which
showed lower results for African
American and Hispanic students
in California Standards Tests
(CST) scores than their white and
Asian American peers.
Board members and speakers
from the community emphasized
that high school success is also a
reflection of elementary and mid
dle school learning.
"The effects of stereotypes can
be so costly," PAUSD Vice Presi
dent Dana Tom said. "I wish this
were a simple issue to address. It
requires vigilance, attention and a
multi-pronged approach. This is a

pre-K to 12 issue, not just a high
school issue. The gap exists in ele
mentary school as well."
Although a specific plan has
not been implemented at this
point, the PAUSD community ex
pressed a clear desire to address
this disparity problem. The board
said it has taken full note of the
concerns of residents of Palo
Alto.

"There are two gaps here,"
said Ken Dauber of We Can Do
Better Palo Alto when time was
allotted for comments from the
public. "We are ranked quite low
for African American and His
panic students while we are
ranked quite high for white and
Asian students. The hidden
achievement gap is the one be
tween Palo Alto District and
other high achieving schools."
According to PAUSD Presi
dent Camille Townsend, Gunn
High School principal Katya Vil
lalobos spoke at the morning
meeting about additional coun
selors and ways of intervening
when students are not perform
ing well academically. Townsend
said she feels that further meas
ures are also necessary for signifi
cant improvements to be made.
"I think we're going to have a
much better success rate if we
start at the elementary school
level," PAUSD Board Member
Melissa Baten Caswell said. "We
can't just attack it at the high
school level."

At last night's meeting, Skelly
presented a PowerPoint entitled
"Graduation Requirements: Pre
liminary Thinking on a New Ap
proach," outlining his proposal
and the rationale behind it. He
also presented "Algebra II Per

showed lower results for African
American and Hispanic students
in California Standards Tests
(CST) scores than their white and
Asian American peers.
Board members and speakers
from the community emphasized
that high school success is also a
reflection of elementary and mid

"The effects of stereotypes can
be so costly," PAUSD Vice Presi
dent Dana Tom said. "I wish this
were a simple issue to address. It
requires vigilance, attention and a
multi-pronged approach. This is a

pre-K to 12 issue, not just a high
school issue. The gap exists in ele
mentary school as well."
Although a specific plan has
not been implemented at this
point, the PAUSD community ex
pressed a clear desire to address
this disparity problem. The board
said it has taken full note of the
concerns of residents of Palo
Alto.

"There are two gaps here,"
said Ken Dauber of We Can Do
Better Palo Alto when time was
allotted for comments from the
public. "We are ranked quite low
for African American and His
panic students while we are
ranked quite high for white and
Asian students. The hidden
achievement gap is the one be
tween Palo Alto District and
other high achieving schools."
According to PAUSD Presi
dent Camille Townsend, Gunn
High School principal Katya Vil
lalobos spoke at the morning
meeting about additional coun
selors and ways of intervening
when students are not perform
ing well academically. Townsend
said she feels that further meas
ures are also necessary for signifi
cant improvements to be made.
"I think we're going to have a
much better success rate if we
start at the elementary school
level," PAUSD Board Member
Melissa Baten Caswell said. "We
can't just attack it at the high
school level."

At Tuesday night's Palo Alto
Unified School District
(PAUSD) meeting, the district
board continued its discussion of
an achievement gap at the dis
trict's two high schools, compar
ing minority student perform

ance with that of white and Asian
American students.

The board also hosted the
high schools' principals Tuesday
morning to hear their "High
School Single Plans for Student
Achievement." Themes ad
dressed at the meeting included
social health and academic inter
vention.

"We have a challenge when it
conies to achievement of kids
with different racial and ethnic
backgrounds," PAUSD Superin
tendent Kevin Skelly said.
"We've discussed the issue many,
many times, so this meeting pro
vides one other way to look at it."

As a whole, African American
and Hispanic PAUSD high

school students are currently
scoring worse and meeting fewer
graduation requirements than
their white and Asian American
peers.

Skelly refuted the idea that
the system has become bifurcat
ed, noting that both students of
color and non-minority students
have access to the same unique
advantages in their school dis
trict.

The district's graduating class
of 2011 self-identified as 57 per
cent white, 29 percent Asian
American, eight percent Hispan
ic, two percent African American
and four percent students of a
separate racial category.

The students who did not
meet the A-G Requirements nec
essary to be eligible for admis
sion to a University of California
(UC) were 51 percent white, 12
percent Asian American, 23 per
cent Hispanic and 10 percent
African American. Students of a
separate racial category formed
the only group that held a con
stant rate at four percent.
A-G requirements include
two years of history or social sci
ence, four years of English, three
years of mathematics, two years
of laboratory science, two years
of a language other than English,
one year of visual and perform
ing arts and one year of an elec
tive. All classes must be at the col

lege preparatory level to fulfill re
quirements.

Last spring, Skelly proposed
modifying some of the district's
graduation requirements to align
with standards for UCs and Cali
fornia State Universities. The cur
rent PAUSD graduation require
ments that would be affected are
those for two years of mathemat
ics, two years of science (not nec
essarily laboratory science) and
one year of either foreign lan
guage orvisual or performing arts.
