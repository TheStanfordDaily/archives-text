## SLAC announces first atomic X-ray laser 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Scientists at the SLAC Na
tional Accelerator Laboratory
announced last Wednesday their
involvement in an experiment
that created the first successful
atomic X-ray laser.

Such a laser was predicted to
be possible as long ago as 45
years, according to Science Now.
The vast amount of energy re
quired for a functioning atomic
X-ray laser, however, led past
physicists to attempt even nu
clear explosions in order to gen
erate the requisite power. SLAC
broke through by using the Linac

Coherent Light Source (LCLS)
laser to power the atomic X-ray
laser.
SLAC scientist John Bozek
said that the LCLS, which has
been operational since August
2009, is the only X-ray free elec
tron laser in the world that would
have been powerful enough to
power the atomic X-ray laser
being tested in the experiment.
The $4lO million LCLS emits
light 10 billion times brighter
than other X-rays.

The experiment, which has
been in the works for approxi
mately two years, pumped X-rays
into a cell of neon gas. The neon
molecules' electrons entered an

excited state lasting five fem
toseconds (sxl0 15 seconds).
"There are as many femtosec
onds in a minute as there are min
utes in the age of the universe,"
Bozek said. "It's a very small frac
tion of a second."

In order to read whether the
atomic X-ray laser beam was
working, a team of SLAC,
Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL) and Col
orado State University scientists
set up a spectrometer down
stream of the laser. The spec
trometer, which was furnished by
Colorado State, was able to
measure the intensity of light em
anating from the atomic X-ray

laser and then display its readings
in real-time on a monitor in an in
strument room.

"[LLNL and Colorado State]
brought in some very different
pieces of equipment that we had
n't used before, including this
high pressure gas cell of neon and
this X-ray spectrometer nei
ther of which are exceptionally
unique, but we hadn't used them
before," Bozek said. "It's an in
teresting facility in the sense that
you're always doing a new exper
iment every week."

For the first three of five 12-
hour shifts â€”or three-fifths of
the team's "beam-time" the
group was not getting the results
it was looking for on the moni
tors, according to the SLAC sci
entists. The display was only read
ing one line, whereas a second
line on the readout would indi
cate that the atomic X-ray laser
was up and running. When the
readings started to match the
group's expectations, the scien
tists quickly realized the magni
tude of their success.
"People were really jumping
up from the chairs, saying 'There
it is,' getting really excited and
pointing at the monitors," said
Christoph Bostedt, a SLAC scien
tist. "It definitely was kind of a
moon-landing situation when we
saw the first signal."
Led by lead authors Nina
Rohringer, formerly of LLNL
and now with the Max Planck Ad
vanced Study Group in Germany,
and Colorado State professor of
electrical and computer engineer
ing Jorge Rocca, the group pub
lished its findings in the Jan. 26
issue of Nature.
"This scheme provides greatly
increased wavelength stability,
monochromaticity and improved
temporal coherence by compari
son with present-day X-ray free
electron lasers," the report stated.

"The atomic X-ray lasers realized
here may be useful for high-reso
lution spectroscopy and nonlin
ear X-ray studies."

While the scientific communi
ty is eager to use the new technol
ogy and explore its potential,
Bozek said he expects it to be
years until anybody begins to
fully utilize the atomic X-ray laser
in non-preliminary ways.
"We have received proposals
that want to take advantage of
this," Bostedt said. "It doesn't say
that they will take advantage of it,
but we have received proposals."
Atomic X-ray laser technolo
gy could be applied in materials
science, the investigation of dy
namics, matter, spectroscopy or in
fields that are not known today.
For example, traditional laser
technology was not invented
specifically to read CDs or oper
ate radar, Bozek said. Rather,
those applications followed the
invention.
"The creativity of scientists is
such that somebody is going to
come up with a great idea of how
we can use it to do something that
we haven't even thought of yet,"
Bozek said.
"It's like we've walked
through a forest and all of a sud
den there's this beautiful pas
ture," he added. "The possibilities
are huge, and we don't even know
what they are yet."
