## SLAC announces first atomic X-ray laser 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Scientists at the SLAC Na
tional Accelerator Laboratory
announced last Wednesday their
involvement in an experiment
that created the first successful
atomic X-ray laser.

Such a laser was predicted to
be possible as long ago as 45
years, according to Science Now.
The vast amount of energy re
quired for a functioning atomic
X-ray laser, however, led past
physicists to attempt even nu
clear explosions in order to gen
erate the requisite power. SLAC
broke through by using the Linac

Coherent Light Source (LCLS)
laser to power the atomic X-ray
laser.
SLAC scientist John Bozek
said that the LCLS, which has
been operational since August
2009, is the only X-ray free elec
tron laser in the world that would
have been powerful enough to
power the atomic X-ray laser
being tested in the experiment.
The $4lO million LCLS emits
light 10 billion times brighter
than other X-rays.

The experiment, which has
been in the works for approxi
mately two years, pumped X-rays
into a cell of neon gas. The neon
molecules' electrons entered an

excited state lasting five fem
toseconds (sxl0 15 seconds).
"There are as many femtosec
onds in a minute as there are min
utes in the age of the universe,"
Bozek said. "It's a very small frac
tion of a second."

In order to read whether the
atomic X-ray laser beam was
working, a team of SLAC,
Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL) and Col
orado State University scientists
set up a spectrometer down
stream of the laser. The spec
trometer, which was furnished by
Colorado State, was able to
measure the intensity of light em
anating from the atomic X-ray

laser and then display its readings
in real-time on a monitor in an in
strument room.

"[LLNL and Colorado State]
brought in some very different
pieces of equipment that we had
n't used before, including this
high pressure gas cell of neon and
this X-ray spectrometer nei
ther of which are exceptionally
unique, but we hadn't used them
before," Bozek said. "It's an in
teresting facility in the sense that
you're always doing a new exper
iment every week."

For the first three of five 12-
hour shifts â€”or three-fifths of
