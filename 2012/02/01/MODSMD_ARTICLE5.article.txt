## GSB tops MBA rankings 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Marshall Watkins 
The Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB) has topped the Financial
Times' (FT) Global MBA rankings for the
first time.
In achieving this ranking, Stanford be
came only the fourth institution to top the
FT's tables since the competition's inception
in 1999.The GSB's rise came at the expense
of the London Business School and the
Wharton School at the University of Penn
sylvania, which were joint winners in 2011.
The FT rankings combine assessments
of MBA programs spanning 20 categories,
but Stanford's MBA program was primari
ly differentiated from rivals by alumni
earning power.The average salaries earned
by alumni three years after graduation
have increasingly distinguished Stanford:
GSB alumni have reported the highest
post-MBA salaries of any comparable pro
gram for the past six years.
For the 2012 rankings, Stanford alumni
salaries three years after graduation aver
aged $191,657 almost $14,000 more
than the GSB's closest rival, Harvard Busi
ness School, which came in first in 1999 and
2000. Higher salaries after graduation con
tinue, however, to be accompanied by the
steep cost of attaining an MBA, with the
average total cost of studying for an MBA
in the United States cited at $99,000 by the
Financial Times.

The GSB's triumph is more broadly re
flective of a shift in influence and earnings
potential toward American universities at

the expense of European peer institutions,
according to the FT article. American uni
versities included in the FT's rankings
moved up between 2011 and 2012 at a sig
nificantly higher rate than their European
counterparts. Top U.S. MBA programs also
noted increases in the percent salary
growth attained by graduates, which was
tracked from enrolment to three years
after graduation.
