### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
James Spudich, Stanford professor of
biochemistry, will receive this year's Wiley
Prize in Biomedical Science, the Wiley
Foundation announced Tuesday.
Spudich won the award along with Co
lumbia professor Michael Sheetz and Uni
versity of California, San Francisco
(UCSF) professor Ronald Vale for their
work on "explaining how cargo is moved
by molecular motors along two different
systems of tracks within cells," said Gtinter
Blobel, chairman of the Wiley Prize awards
jury, in a press release.
The award, which will be pre
sented during a ceremony on April
6, in New York City, includes a
$35,000 prize. According to the
Wiley Foundation website, a five
member jury, including two Nobel
Prize winners, selected the recipi
ents.

"The Wiley Prize in Biomedical
Sciences is intended to recognize
breakthrough research in pure or
applied life science research that is
distinguished by its excellence, orig
inality and impact on our under
standing of biological systems and
processes," the website states. "The
award may recognize a specific con
tribution or series of contributions
that demonstrate the nominee 's sig
nificant leadership in the develop
ment of research concepts or their
clinical application."
Last year, recipients Lily Jan and
Yuh Nung Jan of UCSF won for
identifying the founding member of
potassium ion channels that control
the nerve cell activity of animals.
