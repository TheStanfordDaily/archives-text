## ASSU FM critiques buffer fund use 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
Against the advice of Neveen Mahmoud
'll, the CEO of Stanford Student Enterpris
es (SSE) and the financial manager for the
ASSU, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
passed a bill Tuesday authorizing the alloca
tion of $35,000 from the Undergraduate
Special Buffer Fund to the Stanford Con
cert Network. The Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC) will consider the bill tomorrow.
Mahmoud expressed her concern that dip
ping into the buffer fund for student group
funds might set a detrimental precedent.
"The buffer fund in my interpretation
of the way it is outlined in the constitution
is there essentially to account for ASSU's
mistakes," she said. "I don't believe that this
should be a regular use for buffer-fund
money."

Mahmoud also asserted that drawing
special fees from the buffer fund compro
mises the integrity of the special fees
process by robbing students of their agency
in the financial decisions and putting an ad
ditional burden on legislators.
"I think you would see a huge outcry
from students, [with] higher waiver rates,"
she said of any future in which groups were
funded from the buffer fund rather than
through the [special fees] election process.
It's not about these groups in particular get
ting funding; it's about how this all hap
pened, what this all means [and] what are
the implications of this."

Mahmoud's opinion may have contra

dieted her advice during a previous Senate
meeting when she seemed to endorse the
withdrawal of student group funding from
the buffer fund.

"The senses that I got were that you were
okay with these funds being used from the
buffer fund," said Senator Dan DeLong 'l3.
"Have you ever indicated that it wouldn't
be okay to use these funds?"
Mahmoud answered by explaining that,
although she still believes that the buffer
fund can handle the $35,000 loss, she now
has reconsidered its implications for future
uses. She also noted, again, that she is not re
sponsible for making decisions on policy.
The Senators acknowledged the impor
tance of regulating the buffer funds, saying
that they plan to propose a bill in the near
future concerning its appropriate uses and
emphasizing that the current funding is
more of a "loophole" than a trend.

The Senate decided to move forward on
the question of present funding, however,
since future use of the buffer fund is an issue
separate from its current appropriation.The
body approved the $35,000 request unani
mously.

The Senate also discussed a bill concern
ing the language department's attendance
policy. Referred to by DeLong as the
"CARDINAL Act," the legislation urges
the language center to take urgent action to
change their mandatory attendance policy.
The policy currently deducts two percent
age points from a student's final grade for
every class they miss, regardless
of the justification.
"We feel that it discriminates
against people with chronic med
ical conditions or disabilities,"
Senator Janani Ramachandran 'l4
said.
DeLong added that the policy
doesn't have an official stance on
how the department works with
students with a disability, and said
that he knew at least three people
who have been negatively affect
ed by this policy because of a

medical condition.
This policy "is in violation of
the spirit of the American Civil
Liberties Act. . . and does not
comply with the University's
commitment to 'ensure equal ac
cess to educational programs for
students with disabilities,'" De-
Long argued. He also said that
the policy jeopardizes students'
well-being because sick students
are encouraged to go to class, put
ting their own health in danger as
well as that of their peers.
The Senate tabled the bill until
next week to allow for greater dis
cussion.
