# Stanford scientists transform skin cells into nerve cells
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Alice Phillips 
A research group at the Stan
ford University School of Medi
cine found that skin cells from mice
can be repurposed as cells that can
later become any of the three germ
layers of the nervous system. This
finding contradicts the prevalent
notion that a cell must be a pluripo
tent stem cell in order to develop
into any of the three primary tissue
layers.

The finding that non-stem cells
can change function indicates that
it may be possible to produce neu
ral cells for transplantation that
specifically match the human pa
tient's genetics. The cells swapped
function over just three weeks with
the assistance of specialized tran
scription factors in a process
known as transdifferentiation.

This process is advantageous, in
contrast with the process of induc
ing pluripotency in a cell, because it
produces a homogeneous popula
tion of converted cells. Induced

pluripotency can result in leftover
pluripotent cells that, if transplant
ed into a patient, may cause cancer
because the cells can still differen
tiate their function.
While the Stanford research
group is working toward replicat
ing the cell-swapping ability with
human cells, the process and its re
sulting cells are far from being test
ed with human transplantation
subjects due to the preliminary na
ture of the research. The ability to
produce rapidly large quantities of
neural cells in a laboratory setting,
however, is immediately valuable
for research into diseases and drug
targeting, the study said.
The Stanford research group
has previously shown skin cells of
both mice and humans to be capa
ble of direct conversion into func
tioning neurons.
Marius Wernig, assistant profes
sor of pathology, is the lead author
of the study, which was published
online in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences on
Jan. 30. The first author is Ernesto
Lujan, a graduate student in genet
ics. Wernig is a member of Stan
ford's Institute for Stem Cell Biol
ogy and Regenerative Medicine.
