## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
The Stanford Cancer Institute
opened a new clinic this week with
the intention of providing better
care for patients after cancer treat
ment. The clinic, which will initial
ly to be open only to gynecologic
cancer survivors, will focus on as
sisting patients through issues

such as fatigue, anxiety, body
image, sexual function and rela
tionships, according to a press re
lease from the Stanford School of
Medicine.
"We've done a beautiful job of
helping rid people of their can
cer," said Kelly Bugos, a nurse
practitioner and manager of the
Stanford Cancer Survivorship
Program, in the press release.
"The piece that's been missing is
helping them to return to well
ness after treatment. It's time for
us to give people tools to make
that transition and extend the
treatment safety net a little bit
longer."
David Spiegel, director of
Stanford's Center for Integrative
Medicine, said that the clinic will
provide both "emotional and
medical support" for cancer sur
vivors.
Patients treated at the clinic
are expected to be cancer-free or
have a high probability of achiev
ing long-term remission. These
survivors will be seen by nurse
practitioners with which they
have already interacted during
the treatment process. The nurse
practitioners will help patients
cope with any of the ongoing
physical or psychological pain fol
lowing treatment and direct them
to physicians or support groups if
necessary.
"We know that when treat
ment ends, the cancer experience
continues," Bugos said.
The clinic has been in develop
ment for more than a year, and
the press release identified
LIVESTRONG Survivorship
Center for Excellence Network
as a source that Stanford utilized
during the planning stage. The
LIVESTRONG Survivorship
Center, which was founded in
2005, provides up to $250,000 per
year for five years through a com
petitive request-for-proposal
process to institutions that prom
ise to increase access to and qual
ity of survivorship care. Stan
ford's Survivorship Clinic is not
listed on the LIVESTRONG Sur
vivorship Center's website as a
sponsored network member.
According to the press release,
there are currently more than 12
million Americans that have had
cancer, a number that is growing.
"Our health care system is
much more geared to acute rather
than chronic care, and we haven't
had a good transition back to rou
tine care," Spiegel said. "People
develop significant issues after
cancer the question becomes
how to live with this for the rest of
your life."
