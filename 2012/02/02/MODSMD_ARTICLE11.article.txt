## COSAT LEADING WAY IN NOTES FROM ABROAD 
### â€“ Irteza Binte-Farid 
Almost all the South Africans I have
met here in Cape Town have been
filled with a radiant energy and a will
ingness to share. This attitude was
clearest on our trip to Khayelitsha,
one of the poorest townships in the Cape Flat
area, a region outside of Cape Town. Our group
visited Rosie, a local woman who runs a soup
kitchen. She charges 60 cents per meal, but those
who cannot pay this price can provide kitchen
labor in exchange for food. Even amidst the rows
of shacks and mounds of trash, there are initia
tives to provide ways in which the poor can pro
cure cheap but quality food.
When we got off the bus at Rosie's, a group of
20 to 30 children came to greet us. Some of the

Stanford boys played
soccer with them, while a
group of 15 boys aged
between 6 and 15 came
over and wrote their
names down in my jour
nal, because they wanted
me to remember them.
This page of names is
going to be one of my
most valuable posses
sions from this trip.
Seeing the children
playing and laughing re
minded me that children
everywhere are happy

creatures: they need only guidance and a safe,
loving environment. It saddens me that lack of
opportunity allows so many of them to fall prey
to drugs, violence and teenage pregnancy.
There is, however, reason to hope for the chil
dren of Khayelitsha. We visited the Center of Sci
ence and Technology (COSAT), a school that has
been declared one of the best in South Africa.
COSAT educates the poor children of Khayelit
sha free of charge, using funding from non-gov
ernmental organizations (NGOs). Adolescents
from grades eight to 12 are given rigorous educa
tional training they attend school from Mon
day to Saturday and receive subsidized trans
portation and free lunch. The funding, teacher
dedication and student passion for learning, de-

spite parental apathy
in many cases, ensures
that these children
have a chance to at
tend tertiary educa
tional institutions once
they graduate from
COSAT. The school's
matriculation rate is 83
percent! COSAT has
set an example in the
region, with other
schools attempting to
copy its model.
