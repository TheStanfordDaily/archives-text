# SEARCHING THE STACKS
## PROFILE 
### CHRIS FREDERICK 
Picture yourself in a li
brary. As you walk down
row after row of books,
panic begins to set in. If
this were the moment
for a casual stroll through the
stacks, breathing in the smell of
weathered pages and perusing an
intriguingly titled volume, per
haps you would enjoy the sight of
such grandeur, but at this mo
ment, all you can think about is
the 10-page paper you have due
lpmorrow and how you have no
lllea where to find your next
I source.
This is where Search Works en
ters the picture.
' "One of the primary functions
>M a library is to enable people to
discover information that might
be useful," said Tom Cramer '94,
associate director of digital li
brary systems and services at
Stanford.
This is an especially demand
ing job at Stanford, a university
with collections made of 6,825,821
information resources. To organ
ize such a vast quantity of infor
mation, librarians have needed to
collaborate and think creatively.
The result is Search Works, Stan
ford's next-generation library cat
alog.
At the heart of Search Works is
Blacklight, a software project de
veloped at the University of Vir
ginia. Blacklight is powered by
Apache Solr and Apache Lucene,
the same open-source search en
gine software used by Netflix and
Ticketmaster. While Stanford was
the first university outside of Vir
ginia to adopt Blacklight, about
eight other universities, including
Columbia, Johns Hopkins and the
University of Wisconsin, now use
the project.
At first, libraries relied on
commercial software, which often
simply replicated the traditional
card catalog in an online form.
These commercial solutions
proved inadequate, however, so li

braries decided to collaborate and
create new software for them
selves. This approach matches the
historical behavior of libraries, ac
cording to Cramer.
"There are more books than li
brarians in the world, and labor is
expensive, so libraries have been
very good about figuring out how
to share and cooperate with each
other for centuries," he said.
Search Works debuted in the
fall of 2010. It took three years
and a team of about 16 people to
produce a replacement for the
previous catalog, Socrates. While
developing Search Works, the
team made a special effort to con
sider the unique needs of the
Stanford community. For exam
ple, Chris Bourg, assistant Univer
sity librarian for public services,
drew from her experience work
ing with undergraduates while a
graduate student at Stanford.
"I represent the scholar's
point of view, the student's point
of view," Bourg M.A. '9B Ph.D. 'O3
said.
A feature Search Works has
that Socrates lacked is relevancy
ranking, which makes results ap
pear in order of their relevance to
a search. Because Search Works is
open-source, librarians can tweak
the ranking to suit an academic
environment.
"For example, journal titles
show up higher in the list than
they would otherwise; they get a
little boost," Bourg said.
A student who runs a search
using the keyword "science,"
therefore, will find the journal Sci
ence included near the top of the
results.
Faceted search, another im
portant feature, allows users to
limit their search to particular
kinds of items. For example, a user
can search only for videos located
in the music library.
"If you look at the interface, it
has a similar feel to Amazon or
Zappos, or other kinds of online
