## DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF Last but not least... 
### Leslie Brian 
We all remember the "firsts."
Pasted into scrapbooks,
framed on the wall, docu
mented in writing, they surround us
with memories of the beginning. First
word, first step, first day of school,
first kiss, first love, first loss. These are
the stuff of stories, easily recalled at
family reunions and dinner parties.
But how often do we remember
the "lasts"?
Whether I like it or not, my time
for "firsts" at college is coming to a
close. Halfway through senior year,
the moment I never thought would
actually come graduation is
barreling toward me. Where did all
that time go? I remember thinking
about high school graduation in a
similar way: one of those oh-so-dis
tant events that I knew would have
to happen in theory but couldn't pic
ture in reality. Only this time
around, college graduation is that
much more of a surreal milestone;
it's practically hitting me between
the eyes, and I still can't fully process
the reality.
Thethoughtof my last day of col
lege is a little terrifying. But what re
ally scares me, more than gradua
tion itself, are all the other "lasts"
that get lost along the way. At least I
can ready myself for my last day as a
Stanford undergraduate. But will I
really remember the last time I walk
through the Quad? Or buy coffee
from the Bookstore? Or say "hi" to
those same two cashiers atTresEx?
Those are the little moments that I
won't realize are happening until
they're over.
Where do all the "lasts" go? They
are elusive, hard to pin down or
identify. There's no way to know
when the last time we see our par
ents will be. Or the last time we kiss
our boyfriend or girlfriend goodbye.
Or the last time we'll sit down for
coffee with a best friend. Or the last
time we'll think of ourselves as chil
dren.
Certain "lasts" are out of our
control. But there are others we
have more of a say in. As hard as it is
to know that the end point is ap
proaching, at least we have more op
portunities to make each preceding
moment count. We can choose to fill
our time with more firsts and more
meaning. We can take advantage of
every moment on hand, so that
when the "last" is finally here, we're
content with what came before.
It's a challenge, to say the least.

I'll be the first one to admit not
being particularly adept at it. I
mean, let's be real: once I finish my
columnist stint, my sanity will more
than likely go down the tubes with
out these obligatory weekly re
minders. As much as I've griped
over deadlines and column ideas, I'll
actually be sad to let this huge time
suck go. Now that I only have one
last shot, I can't believe I was ever at
a loss for words. There's so much I
left unsaid.
I've been thinking a lot about
this last column. Number 13 to be
precise. What I wanted it to say, and
what I wanted to leave you with. So,
in the spirit of "lasts," please indulge
me in a short take-away moment. If
you (or I!) get anything out of this
column, I hope it's this:
Life isn't a constant trajectory.
It has its ups and downs. It zigzags.
It bobs and weaves and traverses
shaky terrain. We can never know
for certain where we'll be 15 years
down the road or where we're ulti
mately heading. But every mo
ment is a step in a given direction.
And as long as you take each step
with purpose, chances are that
you'll end up where you want to
be. When you live a life of satisfy
ing moments, you'll end up with a
satisfying life.
I feel like this column has been
a bit of a downer, but that really
wasn't what I intended. The point
was that it's never too late to turn a
year of lasts into a year of more
firsts. I don't have a choice about
graduating on June 17. That date is
set in stone. But I do have a choice
in how to live my life up until that
point. There may only be half a year
left at Stanford, but what a half a
year it will be.
So, until then, wish me luck on
the journey! I wish you the same.
Let's see if we can both follow my
own advice.

Luckily for you, this isn't the last time
you'll have to hear from Leslie. You

I've been thinking a lot about
this last column. Number 13 to be
precise. What I wanted it to say, and
what I wanted to leave you with. So,
in the spirit of "lasts," please indulge
me in a short take-away moment. If
you (or I!) get anything out of this
column, I hope it's this:
Life isn't a constant trajectory.
It has its ups and downs. It zigzags.
It bobs and weaves and traverses
shaky terrain. We can never know
for certain where we'll be 15 years
down the road or where we're ulti
mately heading. But every mo
ment is a step in a given direction.
And as long as you take each step
with purpose, chances are that
you'll end up where you want to
be. When you live a life of satisfy
ing moments, you'll end up with a
satisfying life.
I feel like this column has been
a bit of a downer, but that really
wasn't what I intended. The point
was that it's never too late to turn a
year of lasts into a year of more
firsts. I don't have a choice about
graduating on June 17. That date is
set in stone. But I do have a choice
in how to live my life up until that
point. There may only be half a year
left at Stanford, but what a half a
year it will be.
So, until then, wish me luck on
the journey! I wish you the same.
Let's see if we can both follow my
own advice.

Luckily for you, this isn't the last time
you'll have to hear from Leslie. You

We all remember the "firsts."
Pasted into scrapbooks,
framed on the wall, docu
mented in writing, they surround us
with memories of the beginning. First
word, first step, first day of school,
first kiss, first love, first loss. These are
the stuff of stories, easily recalled at
family reunions and dinner parties.
But how often do we remember
the "lasts"?
Whether I like it or not, my time
for "firsts" at college is coming to a
close. Halfway through senior year,
the moment I never thought would
actually come graduation is
barreling toward me. Where did all
that time go? I remember thinking
about high school graduation in a
similar way: one of those oh-so-dis
tant events that I knew would have
to happen in theory but couldn't pic
ture in reality. Only this time
around, college graduation is that
much more of a surreal milestone;
it's practically hitting me between
the eyes, and I still can't fully process
the reality.
Thethoughtof my last day of col
lege is a little terrifying. But what re
ally scares me, more than gradua
tion itself, are all the other "lasts"
that get lost along the way. At least I
can ready myself for my last day as a
Stanford undergraduate. But will I
really remember the last time I walk
through the Quad? Or buy coffee
from the Bookstore? Or say "hi" to
those same two cashiers atTresEx?
Those are the little moments that I
won't realize are happening until
they're over.
Where do all the "lasts" go? They
are elusive, hard to pin down or
identify. There's no way to know
when the last time we see our par
ents will be. Or the last time we kiss
our boyfriend or girlfriend goodbye.
Or the last time we'll sit down for
coffee with a best friend. Or the last
time we'll think of ourselves as chil
dren.
Certain "lasts" are out of our
control. But there are others we
have more of a say in. As hard as it is
to know that the end point is ap
proaching, at least we have more op
portunities to make each preceding
moment count. We can choose to fill
our time with more firsts and more
meaning. We can take advantage of
every moment on hand, so that
when the "last" is finally here, we're
content with what came before.
It's a challenge, to say the least.

I'll be the first one to admit not
being particularly adept at it. I
mean, let's be real: once I finish my
columnist stint, my sanity will more
than likely go down the tubes with
out these obligatory weekly re
minders. As much as I've griped
over deadlines and column ideas, I'll
actually be sad to let this huge time
suck go. Now that I only have one
last shot, I can't believe I was ever at
a loss for words. There's so much I
left unsaid.
