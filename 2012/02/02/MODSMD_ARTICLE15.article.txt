# DO's AND DOO-DOO's

### Chase Ishii 
Let's talk about entitlement. (I
had about three paragraphs
of witty humor and back
ground on the issue of piracy in
cluding a killer Sir Francis Drake
joke to provide a topical and rel
evant introduction before I pulled
the ol' bait-and-switch, as usual, but
due to my limited word count, I was
forced to reduce those paragraphs
to this one, long, most likely run-on
explanatory sentence.)
We all place expectations upon
others and ourselves which color
the way we operate and behave
throughout the day. These expecta
tions become our normative stan
dard for what is fair and deserved.
If I give the lady at Chipotle $6.55
plus tax, and she gives me a deli
cious steak quesarrito (quesadilla +
burrito) then everything is kosher
(well, at least in the non-Jewish
sense of the word; I'm not sure by
what dietary laws Chipotle pre
pares their meat).
But expectations and entitle

ment become messier than a deli
cious steak quesarrito when we view
it within the context of relationships.
Everyone has their own subjective
expectations of reality that create
their definition of fair and deserving.
European imperialists may have un
derstood their actions in the 19 th
century as fair. (The "take-what-is
yours" mentality is extremely ap
pealing when you are the one that
defines what is "yours.")
And this is the problem. We've
been imprisoned within in a world
of entitlement. Some fail to see the
doors are locked. Others fail to see
the bars at all. But we all, to some
degree or another, have become
slaves to our own sense of fairness
and what we believe we deserve, I
would argue that living your life ac
cording to fairness and entitle
ment, for both yourself and others,
is captivity rather than freedom.
I see a great example in roman
tic relationships. Let's say one per
son gives loving gestures, reaches a

certain level of honest vulnerabili
ty or even lets the other person's
mistakes slide over and over.
These are very normal and neces
sary things to maintain a relation
ship, and if they are done purely
out of love and appreciation,
everything is fine. But, sometimes
they are done less out of love and
more out of an unspoken expecta
tion that things will be reciprocat
ed because that is what is fair.
The first person will begin to feel
they deserve the actions to be re
ciprocated, and if they are not,
then the person grows resentful.
Ultimately, our desire to always
get what we deserve is an attempt
to grasp an illusion of control on
the world around us. If I study so
many hours, then I will get a good
grade, because that is what I de
serve. If I sacrifice my time helping
others or go to church or am a good
person, then good things will hap
pen to me, because that is what I
deserve. But it is just an illusion of

control.
I have a good friend from high
school that was recently involved in
a serious car accident. Broken
bones, collapsed lung, internal
bleeding and signs of brain dam
age, He didn't deserve that. He was
a great person, but regardless of
moral characteristics, no 21-year
old deserves that. No person de
serves that. But it happened. Be
yond anything that he or I or any
one could control, it happened.
Suddenly, even the little things
seem like a blessing —an act of
grace.
I believe there is a world free of
entitlement if only for moments
and instances at a time. If I wake up
every day feeling entitled to a cer
tain career, a certain quality of
friends and a certain level of happi
ness for whatever reason, then any
thing less is the taunting cry of dis
satisfaction.
But, if I wake up everyday and
tear up the scorecard of the things
I've done and the things I deserve,
then the act of waking up in itself is
already more than I am entitled.
Everything else is icing on the cake.
The good things are that much bet
ter, and the bad things don't seem as
bad. I can do the really hard things,
like forgiving and being grateful and
sacrificing and loving in the most dif
ficult of times. You know, the things
that are worthwhile the things
that are, by definition, unfair.
I have the words "nothing is al
right" written on the cover of the
journal I carry. Sometimes "noth
ing is alright" is my answer to how
things are going with the world, and
sometimes, if I'm lucky, "nothing is
alright" is my answer to what I am
expecting of the world. In the end,
we are beggars a11...

And ladies, Chase knows that you 're
begging for his love. In this case, he
thinks reciprocation is fair. So why
not email him at ninjaish@stanford.

out of love and appreciation,
everything is fine. But, sometimes
they are done less out of love and
more out of an unspoken expecta
tion that things will be reciprocat
ed because that is what is fair.
The first person will begin to feel
they deserve the actions to be re
ciprocated, and if they are not,
then the person grows resentful.
Ultimately, our desire to always
get what we deserve is an attempt
to grasp an illusion of control on
the world around us. If I study so
many hours, then I will get a good
grade, because that is what I de
serve. If I sacrifice my time helping
others or go to church or am a good
person, then good things will hap
pen to me, because that is what I
deserve. But it is just an illusion of

control.
I have a good friend from high
school that was recently involved in
a serious car accident. Broken
bones, collapsed lung, internal
bleeding and signs of brain dam
age, He didn't deserve that. He was
a great person, but regardless of
moral characteristics, no 21-year
old deserves that. No person de
serves that. But it happened. Be
yond anything that he or I or any
one could control, it happened.
Suddenly, even the little things
seem like a blessing —an act of
grace.
I believe there is a world free of
entitlement if only for moments
and instances at a time. If I wake up
every day feeling entitled to a cer
tain career, a certain quality of
friends and a certain level of happi
ness for whatever reason, then any
thing less is the taunting cry of dis
satisfaction.
But, if I wake up everyday and
tear up the scorecard of the things
I've done and the things I deserve,
then the act of waking up in itself is
already more than I am entitled.
Everything else is icing on the cake.
The good things are that much bet

bad. I can do the really hard things,
like forgiving and being grateful and
sacrificing and loving in the most dif

that are worthwhile the things
that are, by definition, unfair.
I have the words "nothing is al
right" written on the cover of the
journal I carry. Sometimes "noth

things are going with the world, and

alright" is my answer to what I am
expecting of the world. In the end,
we are beggars a11...

Let's talk about entitlement. (I
had about three paragraphs
of witty humor and back
ground on the issue of piracy in
cluding a killer Sir Francis Drake
joke to provide a topical and rel
evant introduction before I pulled
the ol' bait-and-switch, as usual, but
due to my limited word count, I was
forced to reduce those paragraphs
to this one, long, most likely run-on
explanatory sentence.)
We all place expectations upon
others and ourselves which color
the way we operate and behave
throughout the day. These expecta
tions become our normative stan
dard for what is fair and deserved.
If I give the lady at Chipotle $6.55
plus tax, and she gives me a deli
cious steak quesarrito (quesadilla +
burrito) then everything is kosher
(well, at least in the non-Jewish
sense of the word; I'm not sure by
what dietary laws Chipotle pre
pares their meat).
But expectations and entitle

ment become messier than a deli
cious steak quesarrito when we view
it within the context of relationships.
Everyone has their own subjective
expectations of reality that create
their definition of fair and deserving.
European imperialists may have un
derstood their actions in the 19 th
century as fair. (The "take-what-is
yours" mentality is extremely ap
pealing when you are the one that
defines what is "yours.")
And this is the problem. We've
been imprisoned within in a world
of entitlement. Some fail to see the
doors are locked. Others fail to see
the bars at all. But we all, to some
degree or another, have become
slaves to our own sense of fairness
and what we believe we deserve, I
would argue that living your life ac
cording to fairness and entitle
ment, for both yourself and others,
is captivity rather than freedom.
I see a great example in roman
tic relationships. Let's say one per
son gives loving gestures, reaches a

certain level of honest vulnerabili
ty or even lets the other person's
mistakes slide over and over.
These are very normal and neces
sary things to maintain a relation
ship, and if they are done purely
out of love and appreciation,
everything is fine. But, sometimes
they are done less out of love and
more out of an unspoken expecta
tion that things will be reciprocat
ed because that is what is fair.
