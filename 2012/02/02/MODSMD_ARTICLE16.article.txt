## CARD STARTS FAST STANFORD KICKS OFF SEASON WITH EASY VICTORY 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team reap
peared on the Taube Family Tennis Center
courts to kick off its 2012 campaign without a
home winning streak, without former No. 1
player Hilary Barte and without holding the
top spot in the ITA national rankings. Even
with the new flavor, however, the No. 2 Cardi
nal (1-0) breezed past No. 58 UC-Davis (1-3)
to capture the win, 6-1. The match had sever
al firsts, with sophomore Nicole Gibbs debut
ing at No. 1 on the ladder, top-recruited fresh
man Ellen Tsay participating in her inaugural
collegiate dual match and three doubles
teams consisting of completely new pairings.
"First" didn't translate into "foreign"
though, as Stanford demonstrated its familiar
powerful doubles play with three straight vic
tories to gain the first point of the match. The
No. 1 team of junior Mallory Burdette and
Gibbs pumped up the Cardinal's spirits as the
duo crushed the Aggies' Chui/Heneghan 8-1
in the first match.

"We've had great results together so far
and we're looking forward to improving our
chemistry and match play," Gibbs said. "It's a
privilege to be on court with her, and I'm
going to continue to work on getting closer to
the net, finishing points more effectively and
making more returns."
The other two courts followed suit, as jun
ior Stacey Tan and Tsay defeated Koehly/Za
mudio of UC-Davis 8-5, and sophomore
Amelia Herring and senior captain Veronica
Li also beat Curry/Edles 8-3.
Singles matches began soon after, as
Gibbs remained on court one to compete in
her opening match as the Cardinal's top play
er.
"It was definitely an honor to be playing at
this spot in the lineup, but in terms of strate
gy, it was the exact same," Gibbs said." I was

just trying to put a win up on the board for my
team as I tried to do all of last year."
Gibbs gave her team more than just a win
as she delivered a devastating blow to Dahra
Zamudio of the Aggies, 6-0,6-1. She finished
at about the same time as Li, who blanked
Nicole Koehly, 6-0,6-0. The two victories col
lectively gave the Cardinal the morale boost
it needed to close out the match. Although
junior Natalie Dillon fell to Ellie Edles in a
tight, three-set match, 6-0, 4-6,1-0 (7), Stan
ford managed to pull out the victory with
wins from Burdette on court two, 6-7 (6), 6-2,
1-0 (8), Tan on court three, 6-3,6-1, and Tsay,
in her first dual singles match, on court four,
6-1,6-2.
"We were all really impressed with her
performance and her constant positive out
look throughout the match," Gibbs said of
Tsay's triumph. "It's tough to step into your
first dual match as a freshman, but she defi
nitely took advantage of the opportunity."
Stanford's victory over the Aggies was the

Junior Stacey Tan (above) won both her singles and doubles matches in the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis team's season-opening 6-1 win
over No. 58 UC-Davis on Wednesday. Tan lost just four games in her singles match as the Cardinal had no trouble dispatching the Aggies.
first step in its journey to fulfill an
obvious season goal: winning the
NCAA Tournament.
"I think we see our goals in
terms of the big picture," Gibbs
said. "We are narrow-minded in
that we are looking for a champi
onship. We won't be perfect on
day one, but we hope to be as
close to perfect as possible come
May."
The Cardinal heads north this
weekend to face Oregon and will

have its second opportunity to de
velop and improve. Even though
Stanford cleaned up last year with
a 7-0 win against the Ducks, the
women are not entering the
match with a lackadaisical men
tality.
"Our expectation is always to
win, and I think we'll be able to do
that," Gibbs said. "Individually,
though, we always have to expect
a battle, I'm looking forward to
matching up to a higher-ranked
team and continuing to build."
The action continues in Eu
gene this Saturday at 12 p.m.

The Stanford women's tennis team reap
peared on the Taube Family Tennis Center
courts to kick off its 2012 campaign without a
home winning streak, without former No. 1
player Hilary Barte and without holding the
top spot in the ITA national rankings. Even
with the new flavor, however, the No. 2 Cardi
nal (1-0) breezed past No. 58 UC-Davis (1-3)
to capture the win, 6-1. The match had sever
al firsts, with sophomore Nicole Gibbs debut
ing at No. 1 on the ladder, top-recruited fresh
man Ellen Tsay participating in her inaugural
collegiate dual match and three doubles
teams consisting of completely new pairings.
"First" didn't translate into "foreign"
though, as Stanford demonstrated its familiar
powerful doubles play with three straight vic
tories to gain the first point of the match. The
No. 1 team of junior Mallory Burdette and
Gibbs pumped up the Cardinal's spirits as the
duo crushed the Aggies' Chui/Heneghan 8-1
in the first match.

"We've had great results together so far
and we're looking forward to improving our
chemistry and match play," Gibbs said. "It's a
privilege to be on court with her, and I'm
going to continue to work on getting closer to
the net, finishing points more effectively and
making more returns."
The other two courts followed suit, as jun
ior Stacey Tan and Tsay defeated Koehly/Za
mudio of UC-Davis 8-5, and sophomore
Amelia Herring and senior captain Veronica
Li also beat Curry/Edles 8-3.
Singles matches began soon after, as
Gibbs remained on court one to compete in
her opening match as the Cardinal's top play
er.
"It was definitely an honor to be playing at
this spot in the lineup, but in terms of strate
gy, it was the exact same," Gibbs said." I was

just trying to put a win up on the board for my
team as I tried to do all of last year."
Gibbs gave her team more than just a win
as she delivered a devastating blow to Dahra
Zamudio of the Aggies, 6-0,6-1. She finished
at about the same time as Li, who blanked
Nicole Koehly, 6-0,6-0. The two victories col
lectively gave the Cardinal the morale boost
it needed to close out the match. Although
junior Natalie Dillon fell to Ellie Edles in a
tight, three-set match, 6-0, 4-6,1-0 (7), Stan
ford managed to pull out the victory with
wins from Burdette on court two, 6-7 (6), 6-2,
1-0 (8), Tan on court three, 6-3,6-1, and Tsay,
in her first dual singles match, on court four,
6-1,6-2.
"We were all really impressed with her
performance and her constant positive out
look throughout the match," Gibbs said of
Tsay's triumph. "It's tough to step into your
first dual match as a freshman, but she defi
nitely took advantage of the opportunity."
