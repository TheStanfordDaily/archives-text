# TROJANS, BRUINS COME TO FARM
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
At No. 6 in the nation, the Stanford
men's tennis team heads into its most
important weekend of the young season
with a lot of momentum. This weekend
promises to be full of action as two of the
Cardinal's biggest rivals UCLA and
USC visit the Taube Family Tennis
Center. Stanford is coming off two dom
inant wins against Saint Mary's and
Santa Clara, but No. 1 USC and No. 9
UCLA will surely provide a fierce early
season test for head coach John
Whitlinger's team.
Stanford (4-0) is still awaiting the re
turn of its two-time All-American No. 1
player Bradley Klahn, who is out for the
next couple of weeks with an injury, so
the Cardinal will be without some of its
top firepower against the tough South
ern California teams. Klahn's absence
has, however, provided an opening in the
lineup for a couple of the team's new
faces: freshmen John Morrissey and
Robert Stineman.
The two freshmen have already
proved that they are not players to be
trifled with, regardless of their age.
"Our freshmen played awesome. You
wouldn't have known it was their first
dual matches," sophomore Jamin Ball
remarked after last weekend's wins.
Surely the mental resolve of these rook
ies will be tested against by far the Car
dinal's toughest opponents of the young
season.
On Friday afternoon, the highly con
tested rivalry between Stanford and
USC will resume. Last season, the teams
played twice in some of the fiercest
matches of the season. USC escaped
both times with victories, but during the
teams' second match, the Cardinal had
several chances to win before ultimately
falling 4-3.
USC is the three-time defending na
tional champion including last year's
national championship victory on the
Farm. This will be the Trojans' first trip
back to Taube since winning the nation-

al championship over Virginia.
On the court, USC is led by de
fending NCAA singles champion
Steve Johnson, who played as an
amateur on the pro tour in the
fall, making him ineligible for the
current collegiate rankings. John
son and Klahn are old rivals and
have played several scintillating
matches against each other over
their college careers, but with
Klahn's injury, the task of neutral
izing Johnson will now fall to Car
dinal senior Ryan Thacher,
ranked No. 46 nationally.
UCLA is 4-0 in the early sea
son and will play Stanford on Sat
urday at 1 p.m. The Bruins are a
perennial top-10 squad and have

been worthy rivals of Stanford for
several decades. Last year, how
ever, the Cardinal easily handled
the Bruins, defeating them 6-1 at
Taube.

The Bruins are led by a core of
underclassmen that are supple
mented by more seasoned play
ers at the lower singles positions.
Their top three singles players
No. 72 Clay Thompson, No. 86
Marcus Giron and No. 94 Adrien
Puget are two sophomores
and a freshman. Before playing
Stanford on Saturday, UCLA will
do battle against Cal on Friday.
Historically, whenever these
Southern California schools ven
ture up the coast to the Farm, great
tennis matches are waged at the
Taube Family Tennis Center. This
year promises to be no different.
