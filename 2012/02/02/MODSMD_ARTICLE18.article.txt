# Stanford's recruits here to stay

uiz time. What's the
best way to remove
all questions about
the future stability of
your program when
you've l'i rst-ycar head coach
and your three best players headed
to the NFL? Answer: sign the best re
cruiting class in school history.
By signing the nation's fifth-best
class (and the country's best class of
offensive linemen) on National
Signing Day, the Stanford Cardinal
announced to the college football
world that its recent success will not
be short-lived.
But perhaps the most interesting
thing about Wednesday, other than
the Cardinal's massively successful
day, was the Cal Bears' rapid fall
from the top of the nation's recruit
ing rankings.Together, the rise of the
Cardinal and the fall of the Bears re
vealed something interesting about
the Cardinal's recruiting and
how much more stable the Cardi
nal's future is when compared to
every other program in the country.
Less than a month ago, Cal was
expected to bring in the best recruit
ing class in the Pac-12 and one of the
top 10 classes in the country. After se
curing commitments from safety
Shaq Thompson, defensive tackle
Ellis McCarthy and receiver Jordan
Payton, head coach Jeff Tedford and
the Bears were the talk of the Pac-12.
Then it all came crashing down.
When Cal head recruiting coordi
nator Tosh Lupoi left to take a job on
Steve Sarkisian's staff at Washington,
the Bears started losing top recruits
faster than a snake sheds its skin. On
Wednesday, Thompson followed
Lupoi to Washington and McCarthy
and Payton both went south to
UCLA. JJigh school athletes are
fickle, and they didn't want to be a
part of a program that didn't have the
guy that recruited them still on staff
Meanwhile, across the Bay, the
Cardinal also saw its recruiting co
ordinator head off for greener pas
tures this January. Brian Polian, the
Stanford special teams coach and
chief recruiting coordinator, joined
the Texas A&M staff in January, but,
unlike Cal's recruits, the Cardinal's
prospects didn't stay away. Instead,
they flocked to the Farm. At the
same time that the Bears' recruiting
class fell apart, the Cardinal crystal
lized the best class in school history.
When asked if the Cardinal
coaches had to change their ap
proach to recruiting when Polian
departed, head coach David Shaw's
answer contained some interesting
revelations.
"No offense to Brian, who did an
outstanding job here, but there was
absolutely no change to our recruit
ing," Shaw said. "That's because
these kids are attracted to this place,
to Stanford University, to our style
of football, and that's not going to
change. A lot of things happen like
that at other places, but for here,
what we've got going here, if one or
two guys left, they're not going to
deter what we've got going and the
style that we play."
All year long, Shaw said that Stan
ford was the only place that had a top
five BCS team and a top-five educa
tion, and that's what set the school
apart from anywhere else. And if
Wednesday's recruiting results are
any indication, that top-five educa
tion coupled with a top-five football
team was such a big advantage that
losing a critical coach didn't make any
difference to the Cardinal's recruiting
class. In essence, Stanford can now
claim something that no other school
can claim: it is impervious to losing re
cruits strictly because of coaches.
Every year, coaches like Lupoi
switch schools and recruits follow
them. But as Shaw said, that same
kind of exodus from the Farm isn't
likely to occur just because one guy
moves along. While it might not be
smart to draw grandiose conclu
sions from just one recruiting class,
instead of no longer being a school
where you can get a great education
and, oh yeah, there's a football team
too, Stanford is now a truly great
football school where you can get a
great education and no one guy
can make or break a recruiting class.
That makes it different from any
other place in the country.
Make no mistake, college foot
ball world as weird as it might
seem, Stanford is a football school
now. And it's going to stay that way
for a long time.

Brian Polian may have left, but Jack
Blanchat's columns are staying on the
Farm. Ask Jack how he singlehand
edly convinced so many top recruits
to attend Stanford at blanchat@stan
ford.edu or follow him on Twitter at

uiz time. What's the
best way to remove
all questions about
the future stability of
your program when
you've l'i rst-ycar head coach
and your three best players headed
to the NFL? Answer: sign the best re
cruiting class in school history.
By signing the nation's fifth-best
class (and the country's best class of
offensive linemen) on National
Signing Day, the Stanford Cardinal
announced to the college football
world that its recent success will not
be short-lived.
But perhaps the most interesting
thing about Wednesday, other than
the Cardinal's massively successful
day, was the Cal Bears' rapid fall
from the top of the nation's recruit
ing rankings.Together, the rise of the
Cardinal and the fall of the Bears re
vealed something interesting about
the Cardinal's recruiting and
how much more stable the Cardi
nal's future is when compared to
every other program in the country.
Less than a month ago, Cal was
expected to bring in the best recruit
ing class in the Pac-12 and one of the
top 10 classes in the country. After se
curing commitments from safety
Shaq Thompson, defensive tackle
Ellis McCarthy and receiver Jordan
Payton, head coach Jeff Tedford and
the Bears were the talk of the Pac-12.
Then it all came crashing down.
When Cal head recruiting coordi
nator Tosh Lupoi left to take a job on
Steve Sarkisian's staff at Washington,
the Bears started losing top recruits
faster than a snake sheds its skin. On
Wednesday, Thompson followed
Lupoi to Washington and McCarthy
and Payton both went south to
UCLA. JJigh school athletes are
fickle, and they didn't want to be a
part of a program that didn't have the
guy that recruited them still on staff
Meanwhile, across the Bay, the
Cardinal also saw its recruiting co
ordinator head off for greener pas
tures this January. Brian Polian, the
Stanford special teams coach and
chief recruiting coordinator, joined
the Texas A&M staff in January, but,
unlike Cal's recruits, the Cardinal's
prospects didn't stay away. Instead,
they flocked to the Farm. At the
same time that the Bears' recruiting
class fell apart, the Cardinal crystal
lized the best class in school history.
When asked if the Cardinal
coaches had to change their ap
proach to recruiting when Polian
departed, head coach David Shaw's
answer contained some interesting
revelations.
"No offense to Brian, who did an
outstanding job here, but there was
absolutely no change to our recruit
ing," Shaw said. "That's because
these kids are attracted to this place,
to Stanford University, to our style
of football, and that's not going to
change. A lot of things happen like
that at other places, but for here,
what we've got going here, if one or
two guys left, they're not going to
deter what we've got going and the
style that we play."
All year long, Shaw said that Stan
ford was the only place that had a top
five BCS team and a top-five educa
tion, and that's what set the school
apart from anywhere else. And if
Wednesday's recruiting results are
any indication, that top-five educa
tion coupled with a top-five football
team was such a big advantage that
losing a critical coach didn't make any
difference to the Cardinal's recruiting
class. In essence, Stanford can now
claim something that no other school
can claim: it is impervious to losing re
cruits strictly because of coaches.
Every year, coaches like Lupoi
switch schools and recruits follow
them. But as Shaw said, that same
kind of exodus from the Farm isn't
likely to occur just because one guy
moves along. While it might not be
smart to draw grandiose conclu
sions from just one recruiting class,
instead of no longer being a school
where you can get a great education
and, oh yeah, there's a football team
too, Stanford is now a truly great
football school where you can get a
great education and no one guy
can make or break a recruiting class.
That makes it different from any
other place in the country.
