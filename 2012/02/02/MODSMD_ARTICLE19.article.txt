# MEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Card preps for California tri-meet 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Three of the top six men's
swimming and diving teams in the
country are set to compete at the
USC McDonald's Swim Stadium
this weekend with regular-season
bragging rights on the line. In this
matchup of California schools, No.
3 Stanford (6-1), No. 5 USC (3-1)
and No. 6 Cal (3-1) will have the
chance to display some fast swims
and also make a case for the Pac-12
to be the best men's swimming and
diving conference in the country.
Conference pride aside, Stan
ford's main priority will be to
bounce back from a close loss
against No. 1 Arizona, another
Pac-12 foe, two weekends ago. This
Friday, Cal will square off against
USC while Stanford will swim ex

hibition, meaning that the Cardi
nal's swims will not be officially
scored. The day after, it will be the
Cardinal's turn to battle the Tro
jans with Cal swimming exhibi
tion. This means that Stanford will
not officially compete against Cal
at this quasi tri-meet. The much
anticipated matchup between the
two cross-Bay rivals will not come
until Feb. 18, the last meet before
the Pac-12 and NCAA Champi
onships.
Looking at the possible
matchups against USC, the Cardi
nal's strongest events also seem to
be the Trojans' forte. Both teams
have already posted some speedy
times earlier this season. In the 200
backstroke, Stanford has three of
the eight fastest swimmers in the
country, with freshman David
Nolan leading the way. But the

Trojans also have three top-12
swimmers in that event. One of
them is junior co-captain Alex
Lendrum, who owns the second
fastest time in the country

about a second faster than Nolan's
time.

The same scenario holds true
for the 200 individual medley.
Stanford has four swimmers in the
top 12, but the fact that two USC
swimmers have the third- and
fourth-fastest times in the country
may very well nullify the Cardi
nal's strength in that event. Stan
ford's best bet seems to be in the
distance events, which have always
been a consistent source of points
for the team. In the 500 freestyle,
Stanford has five of the nation's
top-10 fastest swimmers compared
