## DOE selects Stanford solar team Student team to compete in solar house competition 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The U.S. Department of Ener
gy (DOE) selected a Stanford
team last week as one of 20 colle
giate teams set to compete in the
biennial Solar Decathlon compe
tition.

The Decathlon, hosted by the
DOE, offers participating teams
$lOO,OOO in seed money to design,
build and operate solar-powered
homes with a zero net energy
footprint. The Stanford team will
have two years to build its home,
which the team will assemble in
Orange County in 2013 for a
DOE panel to assess.
Stanford progressed through a
selection process that pitted the
team against around 40 different
universities from both the U.S.
and abroad. Each university sub
mitted a 30-page proposal that
outlined the team's concept, or
ganization, fundraising and
scheduling. The Stanford team
submitted its proposal in Novem
ber and received word of the ap
plication's success last Wednes
day.

Derek Ouyang 'l3, co-founder
of the Stanford Solar Decathlon
team, noted that the Stanford
team faces an inherent disadvan
tage in numbers due to the Uni
versity's small undergraduate
population relative to competing
engineering-focused schools.
While typical Decathlon teams
number in the hundreds, Ouyang
currently expects a committed
Stanford team of around 40 stu
dents.

"We expect that our team will
be composed of about 25 percent
graduate students, 75 percent un
dergraduate [students]," said Tay
lor Brady 'l3, co-founder of the
Stanford team, in an email to The
Daily. Brady said most of these
students will be from the School
of Engineering, but the team will
also include "a fair portion" of
students studying business, eco
nomics and marketing, as well.
Brady added that he antici
pates the team splitting up into
smaller groups, each focusing on
an aspect of the house's design
