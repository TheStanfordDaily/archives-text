## DOE selects Stanford solar team Student team to compete in solar house competition 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The U.S. Department of Ener
gy (DOE) selected a Stanford
team last week as one of 20 colle
giate teams set to compete in the
biennial Solar Decathlon compe
tition.

The Decathlon, hosted by the
DOE, offers participating teams
$lOO,OOO in seed money to design,
build and operate solar-powered
homes with a zero net energy
footprint. The Stanford team will
have two years to build its home,
which the team will assemble in
Orange County in 2013 for a
DOE panel to assess.
Stanford progressed through a
selection process that pitted the
team against around 40 different
universities from both the U.S.
and abroad. Each university sub
mitted a 30-page proposal that
outlined the team's concept, or
ganization, fundraising and
scheduling. The Stanford team
submitted its proposal in Novem
ber and received word of the ap
plication's success last Wednes
day.

Derek Ouyang 'l3, co-founder
of the Stanford Solar Decathlon
team, noted that the Stanford
team faces an inherent disadvan
tage in numbers due to the Uni
versity's small undergraduate
population relative to competing
engineering-focused schools.
While typical Decathlon teams
number in the hundreds, Ouyang
currently expects a committed
Stanford team of around 40 stu
dents.

"We expect that our team will
be composed of about 25 percent
graduate students, 75 percent un
dergraduate [students]," said Tay
lor Brady 'l3, co-founder of the
Stanford team, in an email to The
Daily. Brady said most of these
students will be from the School
of Engineering, but the team will
also include "a fair portion" of
students studying business, eco
nomics and marketing, as well.
Brady added that he antici
pates the team splitting up into
smaller groups, each focusing on
an aspect of the house's design

and construction and meeting
multiple times each week. The
team has already begun to plan
and design the house, a stage that
is scheduled to continue into win
ter quarter of 2013. Construction
will take place on campus during
spring quarter of the same aca
demic year, before the Sept. 2013
competition.

The team has received assis
tance from faculty from a variety
of departments and is currently
looking to develop partnerships
with the Graduate School of
Business (GSB) for marketing
support and with the School of
Engineering for facilities and
funds. Both University President
John Hennessy and Dean of En
gineering Jim Plummer wrote
letters of support for the team
during the selection process.
Richard King, director and
founder of the Solar Decathlon,
noted that the overall cost of
competing for teams could rise to
multiples of the DOE seed
money. Teams are expected to in
dependently raise funding for the
design, construction and trans
portation to the testing site.

"It's almost a small business
endeavor," King said. "Not only
are you designing the house and
organizing a team, but you're
raising the funds and reaching
out to corporations and other en
tities for support."

The Stanford team has al
ready identified potential finan
cial, material and mentoring
partnerships with large firms
such as General Electric (GE)
and Facebook.

Ouyang added that the team
intends to develop partnerships
with Silicon Valley companies
and local construction firms as
well as solar panel manufactur
ers. Ouyang emphasized that the
University's close ties with Cali
fornia firms may help provide a
competitive advantage. The

house will, however, be con
structed entirely by students.

The Decathlon assesses com
peting teams' houses through 10
equally weighted categories, with
the highest cumulative score de
termining the competition win
ner. Grading categories include
market appeal, feasibility, con
cept presentation and perform
ance. The latter is assessed by
having six team members live in
the house and perform tasks,
such as cooking or watching tele
vision, over a 10-day period while
only using solar energy.

The DOE has credited the
competition with workforce de
velopment in the energy sector as
well as educating the public. King
noted that teams' concepts and
blueprints are made available to
the general public and have in the
past sparked interest from the
private sector, with some teams
from previous years going on to
form successful companies in the
energy sector.

Brady and Ouyang noted that
the project's future after the De
cathlon will depend largely on
public reception and competitive
success, but they envision poten
tially returning the house to cam
pus to serve educational, residen
tial and research functions. Past
competitors have toured their
projects for educational and
commercial outreach or sold or
donated their houses to home
owners and museums.

Brady noted that the princi
ples developed and utilized in the
house's construction represent
the future of the building indus
try. He highlighted the opportuni
ty for innovation and social im
pact provided by participation in
the Decathlon.

"Stanford is in a great position
to excel at this competition, being
at the heart of Silicon Valley and
an innovator in green technolo
gy," wrote Ouyang in an email to
The Daily. "We've built solar cars
before; it's about time we built a
solar home."

blueprints are made available to
the general public and have in the
past sparked interest from the
private sector, with some teams
from previous years going on to
form successful companies in the
energy sector.

Brady and Ouyang noted that
the project's future after the De
cathlon will depend largely on
public reception and competitive
success, but they envision poten
tially returning the house to cam
pus to serve educational, residen
tial and research functions. Past
competitors have toured their
projects for educational and
commercial outreach or sold or
donated their houses to home
owners and museums.

Brady noted that the princi
ples developed and utilized in the
house's construction represent
the future of the building indus
try. He highlighted the opportuni
ty for innovation and social im
pact provided by participation in
the Decathlon.

"Stanford is in a great position
to excel at this competition, being
at the heart of Silicon Valley and
an innovator in green technolo
gy," wrote Ouyang in an email to
The Daily. "We've built solar cars
before; it's about time we built a
solar home."

The U.S. Department of Ener
gy (DOE) selected a Stanford
team last week as one of 20 colle
giate teams set to compete in the
biennial Solar Decathlon compe
tition.

The Decathlon, hosted by the
DOE, offers participating teams
$lOO,OOO in seed money to design,
build and operate solar-powered
homes with a zero net energy
footprint. The Stanford team will
have two years to build its home,
which the team will assemble in
Orange County in 2013 for a
DOE panel to assess.
Stanford progressed through a
selection process that pitted the
team against around 40 different
universities from both the U.S.
and abroad. Each university sub
mitted a 30-page proposal that
outlined the team's concept, or
ganization, fundraising and
scheduling. The Stanford team
submitted its proposal in Novem
ber and received word of the ap
plication's success last Wednes
day.

Derek Ouyang 'l3, co-founder
of the Stanford Solar Decathlon
team, noted that the Stanford
team faces an inherent disadvan
tage in numbers due to the Uni
versity's small undergraduate
population relative to competing
engineering-focused schools.
While typical Decathlon teams
number in the hundreds, Ouyang
currently expects a committed
Stanford team of around 40 stu
dents.

"We expect that our team will
be composed of about 25 percent
graduate students, 75 percent un
dergraduate [students]," said Tay
lor Brady 'l3, co-founder of the
Stanford team, in an email to The
Daily. Brady said most of these
students will be from the School
of Engineering, but the team will
also include "a fair portion" of
students studying business, eco
nomics and marketing, as well.
Brady added that he antici
pates the team splitting up into
smaller groups, each focusing on
an aspect of the house's design

and construction and meeting
multiple times each week. The
team has already begun to plan
and design the house, a stage that
is scheduled to continue into win
ter quarter of 2013. Construction
will take place on campus during
spring quarter of the same aca
demic year, before the Sept. 2013
competition.

The team has received assis
tance from faculty from a variety
of departments and is currently
looking to develop partnerships
with the Graduate School of
Business (GSB) for marketing
support and with the School of
Engineering for facilities and
funds. Both University President
John Hennessy and Dean of En
gineering Jim Plummer wrote
letters of support for the team
during the selection process.
Richard King, director and
founder of the Solar Decathlon,
noted that the overall cost of
competing for teams could rise to
multiples of the DOE seed
money. Teams are expected to in
dependently raise funding for the
design, construction and trans
portation to the testing site.

"It's almost a small business
endeavor," King said. "Not only
are you designing the house and
organizing a team, but you're
raising the funds and reaching
out to corporations and other en
tities for support."

The Stanford team has al
ready identified potential finan
cial, material and mentoring
partnerships with large firms
such as General Electric (GE)
and Facebook.

Ouyang added that the team
intends to develop partnerships
with Silicon Valley companies
and local construction firms as
well as solar panel manufactur
ers. Ouyang emphasized that the
University's close ties with Cali
fornia firms may help provide a
competitive advantage. The

house will, however, be con
structed entirely by students.

The Decathlon assesses com
peting teams' houses through 10
equally weighted categories, with
the highest cumulative score de
termining the competition win
ner. Grading categories include
market appeal, feasibility, con
cept presentation and perform
ance. The latter is assessed by
having six team members live in
the house and perform tasks,
such as cooking or watching tele
vision, over a 10-day period while
only using solar energy.

The DOE has credited the
competition with workforce de
velopment in the energy sector as
well as educating the public. King
noted that teams' concepts and
blueprints are made available to
the general public and have in the
past sparked interest from the
private sector, with some teams
from previous years going on to
form successful companies in the
