# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Stanford travels to face No. 1 BYU 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A year that began with national
title aspirations hasn't gone ac
cording to plan recently for the
Stanford men's volleyball team.
After suffering an early-season loss
to No. 3 UCLA, the Cardinal
dropped another match to the No.
5 Penn State Nittany Lions last Fri
day. However, the No. 7 Cardinal
redeemed itself with an impressive
win over the defending national
champion No. 9 Ohio State Buck
eyes at their arena. The Cardinal
will look to take this momentum
into Provo, Utah, as the team gets
set to face off against a very tough
BYU squad.
After losing to UC-Irvine in the
first game of the year, the No. 1
BYU Cougars (6-1, 4-0 MPSF)
have been nearly unstoppable.

They have won their last six match
es in a row, most recently beating
USC 3-1 and 3-2 in a pair of week
end matches. This streak includes
two payback wins over the former
ly No. 1 Anteaters.The Cardinal (5-
2, 2-1) will look to hand the
Cougars their second and third
losses of the year this weekend in a
highly anticipated matchup be
tween two men's volleyball jugger
nauts.
Leading a balanced offensive
attack for the Cougars are sopho
more outside hitter Taylor Sander
and senior opposite Robb Stowell.
Sander is posting an unprecedent
ed 4.90 kills-per-set mark, while the
6-foot-7 Stowell is not far behind
with 3.58. The pair has wreaked
havoc on opposing defenses, using
their above-average height and
athleticism to overwhelm their op
ponents. In their last match against
USC, the duo combined for 46 kills.
Stanford will need to step up on
defense to stop the talented BYU
attack. This daunting task rests pri
marily on the shoulders of Stanford
middle blockers Gus Ellis and
Denny Fells. However, the team
will also need a strong effort from
sophomore outside hitter Eric
Mochalski, who leads the team in
blocks this season with 15.
While the Cougars are known
for their offensive firepower, they
boast one of the nation's best de

fensive units as well. Junior middle
blocker Russ Lavaja leads the team
with 42 blocks and a 1.45 blocks
per-set average. Lavaj a is one of the
nation's best defensive middle
blockers, and he will not make
things easy for the Stanford of
fense.
Still, the Cardinal players like
their chances. Senior captain Brad
Lawson summed it up, saying,
"we've been watching them on film
all week. We know they have great
blocking, great attacking, but we're
ready for the challenge."
Lawson, who has easily been
Stanford's most dominant player
this year, will lead the offensive
charge. Lawson leads the Card in
total kills (170) and kills per set
(3.52). He is clearly looking to earn
a spot on this year's AVCA Ail-
American First Team, just as he did
last season. A strong effort against
the No. 1 Cougars would certainly
help his case, but Lawson is more
concerned with his team. Pitching
in for the Card is sophomore out
side hitter Brian Cook. He leads
the team in hitting percentage at a
solid .350 mark and is not far be
hind Lawson in kills per set with
3.20. Both Cook and Lawson
recorded 17 kills in their last match
against USC, propelling Stanford
to a much-needed victory. The pair
will need to bring their A-game if
the Card wants to upset BYU.
"It's a test, but I think [we] are
excited to play such a talented vol
leyball team," Lawson said.
As far as tests are concerned, a
midterm exam may more accu
rately describe this contest. Stan
ford has yet to play a team as tal
ented as BYU, and might not for
the rest of the year. Still, the Cardi
nal has the discipline and talent to
beat any team in the country, in
cluding the Cougars, and a sweep
of BYU this weekend would cer
tainly turn some heads in the
world of men's volleyball. These
two matches start a stretch of 18-
straight conference matches to fin
ish the regular season, so position
ing in the MPSF will be on the line
as well.

The Cougars and Cardinal
square off on Friday and Saturday
night. Both matches will begin at 6
p.m. P.T.
