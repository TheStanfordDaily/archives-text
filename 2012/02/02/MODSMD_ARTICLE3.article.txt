# BEST CLASS EVER
## CARDINAL SIGNS TOP RECRUITING CLASS IN SCHOOL HISTORY 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
It's not often that the sweetest
sound on the Stanford campus is
that of a screeching fax machine.
But that was the story on
Wednesday's National Signing
Day, when the Stanford football
team signed its best recruiting
class in school history.
The Cardinal signed 22 play
ers from 14 different states on
Wednesday, including three five
star prospects and three of the
top eight offensive line prospects
in the country. Altogether, the
Cardinal finished with the na
tion's fifth-best recruiting class
according to Rivals.com, trailing
only Alabama, Texas, Florida and
Ohio State,

"I think we've got probably

one of the best classes in the his
tory of the school," said head
coach David Shaw. "But it's not
just about the rankings or the
stars, it's about the quality of the
individuals that we added to our
team. Needless to say, we are ex
cited about this."
Shaw and his coaching staff
had already compiled an excel
lent class of commits before
Wednesday, but National Signing
Day saw three five-star recruits
all commit themselves to the Car
dinal.

Stanford's biggest grab came
early in the day, when offensive
tackle Andrus Peat, a 6-foot-7,
307-pound native of Tempe,
Ariz., spurned Nebraska, Florida
State and USC to come to the
Farm. Peat, the country's sixth
best offensive lineman, was ex

pected to join the Cornhuskers in
Lincoln, where his brother is cur
rently a defensive tackle.
The Cardinal offensive line
then got another boost when
Kyle Murphy, the third-best tack
le in the country, promised him
self to Palo Alto. When Murphy
added his name to a list that al
ready included Peat, Joshua Gar

nett the nation's second-best
guard and three other four
star offensive linemen (Nick
Davidson, Brandon Fanaika and
Graham Shuler), the Cardinal
had pieced together the nation's
most talented and promising
group of offensive line prospects.

Shaw said he and the coaching
staff knew long ago that this crew
of linemen would be more than
capable of replacing NFL-bound
offensive linemen Jonathan Mar
tin and David DeCastro.
"[The coaches] had a conver
sation last spring that I'll never
forget . . . The comment was
made in the room that this could
potentially be one of the best of
fensive line classes in modern
football history," Shaw said. "It's
just the combination of size, ath
letic ability, toughness ... it's rare
that you get that many guys that
can play this well."
Shaw said that getting a big
class of offensive linemen was the
Cardinal coaching staffs number
one goal this year and that the
Cardinal's ground-based offen
sive philosophy made it easy to se
cure such a good class.
"We have a great offensive line
here, but we haven't had the vol
ume of guys that we needed in the
last two classes, to be honest,"
Shaw said. "We needed to make a
big push this year not just for
quality, which you always want,
but for quantity as well.
"I think we've got outstanding
teachers here in [offensive line
coaches] Mike Bloomgren and
Ron Crook, as far as the tech
niques that help these guys to be
successful on this level and the
next," Shaw continued. "We play a
scheme that translates very well
to the NFL. I think that's extreme
ly attractive [to recruits]."

In addition to the Cardinal's
big commitments along the offen
sive line, Stanford got a boost to
an already-solid defensive class
when defensive end Aziz Shittu,
the third-best defensive end in the
country, became the third five
star player to sign with the Cardi
nal. Shittu committed to the Car
dinal last year, then decommitted
in June 2011, but finally wound up
back where he originally started
on Wednesday.
While Peat, Murphy and Shittu
stole the show and the headlines
on Wednesday by choosing the
Cardinal, Stanford also (finally)
officially secured the services of
players like Barry J. Sanders, Noor
Davis and Alex Carter, who all
committed to the Cardinal
months ago.
Sanders, the son of football leg

end Barry Sanders and the nation's
ninth-best running back, will bring
his 4.4 speed and shifty moves to an
already-deep backfield.
"We didn't need a running
back, we've got a great group of
running backs, so [the coaching
staff] said, if we're going to take
one, we're going to take a guy
that's a difference maker, a guy
that's special. And we found one
in Barry Sanders," Shaw said.
Davis, the nation's fourth-best
linebacker, adds to a corps of line
backers that is already stacked for
next season.

"We've got a really good group
of inside linebackers and outside
linebackers, but when you run
across a guy like Noor Davis, you
can't pass him up," Shaw said.
"He's that good as a football play

er, and the high character as an in
dividual that you want to surround
yourself with guys like that."
Finally, Carter, the nation's
third-best defensive back, could
fill in right away in the defensive
backfield for the Cardinal, which
will lose three senior starters from
2011.

"We're always looking for de
fensive backs, there's been years
where we've gone through classes
without a single one," Shaw said
"But to get a guy like Alex Carter,
who's that big physical corner that
NFL teams are looking for."
While the Cardinal already has
one of the nation's finest groups
of recruits assembled for 2012, it
could get even better this Friday
or next Wednesday if Jameis Win
ston, the nation's top quarterback

prospect, decides to switch his
commitment from Florida State
and come to the Farm instead.
Winston committed to the Semi
noles some time ago but recently
has wavered in his commitment
since learning of his acceptance to
Stanford and decided to delay
signing his letter of intent to later
this week.

Altogether, Shaw assembled a
class that topped the Pac-12 in his
first-ever recruiting class as a
head coach and a class that far
outranked any of the recruiting
classes of his predecessor, Jim
Harbaugh. However, Shaw didn't
hint that his new group of players
would come in with any special
privileges in 2012 some will
earn their way onto the field, oth
ers will be redshirted.

"There is a possibility that
these guys can come in and com
pete," Shaw said. "But at the same
time, guys that come in ready to
play, those are the guys that are
going to play. I tell the guys all the
time, I don't care what year they
are. True freshmen, fifth-year sen
iors, the best guy's going to get on
the field."

With a recruiting class this tal
ented and deep, Shaw's biggest
problem might just be finding
enough spots for his best players.
And with the new precedent he's
set in the recruiting game, that job
might get even harder when the
fax machines start screeching
again next February.

The Stanford football team, fresh off the best two-season stretch in program history, welcomed 22 members of the recruiting class of 2012 on
Wednesday. The Cardinal signed the highest-rated class in school history, including multiple five-star recruits and one of the best offensive line
classes in college football history. Head coach David Shaw expects many of the incoming freshmen to compete for jobs in all three phases of the game.
