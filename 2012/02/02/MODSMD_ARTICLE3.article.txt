# BEST CLASS EVER
## CARDINAL SIGNS TOP RECRUITING CLASS IN SCHOOL HISTORY 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
It's not often that the sweetest
sound on the Stanford campus is
that of a screeching fax machine.
But that was the story on
Wednesday's National Signing
Day, when the Stanford football
team signed its best recruiting
class in school history.
The Cardinal signed 22 play
ers from 14 different states on
Wednesday, including three five
star prospects and three of the
top eight offensive line prospects
in the country. Altogether, the
Cardinal finished with the na
tion's fifth-best recruiting class
according to Rivals.com, trailing
only Alabama, Texas, Florida and
Ohio State,

"I think we've got probably

one of the best classes in the his
tory of the school," said head
coach David Shaw. "But it's not
just about the rankings or the
stars, it's about the quality of the
individuals that we added to our
team. Needless to say, we are ex
cited about this."
Shaw and his coaching staff
had already compiled an excel
lent class of commits before
Wednesday, but National Signing
Day saw three five-star recruits
all commit themselves to the Car
dinal.

Stanford's biggest grab came
early in the day, when offensive
tackle Andrus Peat, a 6-foot-7,
307-pound native of Tempe,
Ariz., spurned Nebraska, Florida
State and USC to come to the
Farm. Peat, the country's sixth
best offensive lineman, was ex

pected to join the Cornhuskers in
Lincoln, where his brother is cur
rently a defensive tackle.
The Cardinal offensive line
then got another boost when
Kyle Murphy, the third-best tack
le in the country, promised him
self to Palo Alto. When Murphy
added his name to a list that al
ready included Peat, Joshua Gar

nett the nation's second-best
guard and three other four
star offensive linemen (Nick
Davidson, Brandon Fanaika and
Graham Shuler), the Cardinal
had pieced together the nation's
most talented and promising
group of offensive line prospects.
