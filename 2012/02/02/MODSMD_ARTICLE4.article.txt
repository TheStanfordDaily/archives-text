## Freedom Riders inspire, encourage activism 
### EDWARD NGAI STAFF WRITER 
Black History Month kicked
off at Stanford Monday evening
with a panel of three of the origi
nal Freedom Riders, civil rights
activists who participated in the
iconic Freedom Rides, a series of
bus trips from Washington, D.C.,
to the Deep South in 1961.
Freedom Ride participants
Rip Patton, Helen Singleton and

Dr. Bob Singleton joined moder
ator Clayborne Carson, profes
sor of history, on a panel hosted
by the Stanford NAACP, Black
Student Union, History Depart
ment and the Martin Luther
King, Jr., Research and Educa
tion Institute.

"We want to get the student
body to think about [the history
of our civil rights] and to get stu
dents to see they can influence
the system," said Shawn Dye 'l4,

chair of the Stanford NAACP
political action committee. "The
Freedom Riders were our age
when they were [fighting for our
civil rights]."
During the half-hour panel,
the Freedom Riders shared per
sonal stories and reasons for em
barking on their history-making
journey.

Helen Singleton recounted
how traveling with her family in
formed her participation in the

Rides.
"We were happy until we got
to Washington, D.C.," Flelen Sin
gleton said. "And as we pulled
out of Washington and headed
into Virginia, we could feel the
tension in the car, because here
was my father who was nervous
because he was going into territo
ry where he couldn't protect his
family."
So when the opportunity came
in the spring of 1961 for students
to protest racial discrimination,
the Singletons and Patton decided
to join.
"When the [first] bus got
burned and the second bus got
beat up and the third bus got beat
up and they called for more be
cause they wanted the Rides to
continue and show that violence
would not overcome non-vio
lence, it was a no-brainer for me,"
Helen Singleton said.
Little deterred the panelists or
their fellow activists from contin
uing the Rides.
"Each group that was arrested,
they would be put in the paddy
wagon," Patton said. "And they
would sing 'We Shall Overcome.'"
The panelists also had words of
advice for young idealists seeking
to change the injustices they wit
ness in the world.
"There's no love in iPods;
there's no love in computers. We

didn't have those things ... we
had each other, we had love," Pat
ton said. "We need to get away
from [the gadgets], either get
away from them or learn how to
use them to find away for this
country to move forward."
"What was overt at that time is
covert now. Many of the discrimi
nations, we could stare them
down. Now, they're hidden," Bob
Singleton said. "They still discrim
inate ... [so] you have to get to
gether and ask yourself, 'How do
we combat [this]?'"
His wife had a more direct ad
vice.
"Whatever pisses you off,
that's your issue," she said to
laughter and applause.
Finally, the speakers called on
young people to remember that
much remains to be improved in
racial equality.
"Dr. King didn't die getting a
civil rights bill," Carson reminded
the audience at the end of the
panel. "He died fighting for sani
tation in Memphis. And those are
issues we still haven't dealt with."
