"We want to get the student
body to think about [the history
of our civil rights] and to get stu

the system," said Shawn Dye 'l4,

chair of the Stanford NAACP
political action committee. "The
Freedom Riders were our age
when they were [fighting for our
civil rights]."
During the half-hour panel,
the Freedom Riders shared per
sonal stories and reasons for em
barking on their history-making
journey.

Helen Singleton recounted
how traveling with her family in
formed her participation in the

Rides.
"We were happy until we got
to Washington, D.C.," Flelen Sin
gleton said. "And as we pulled
out of Washington and headed
into Virginia, we could feel the
tension in the car, because here
was my father who was nervous
because he was going into territo
ry where he couldn't protect his
family."
