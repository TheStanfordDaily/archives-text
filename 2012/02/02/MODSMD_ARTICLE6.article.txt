## Founder Soup aims to combine ideas and technical talent 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Roberto Vargas 
Founder Soup a collaboration between
Stanford, the venture capital (VC) firm An
dreesen-Horowitz and Founder Soup presi
dent Michael Dorsey MBA 'lO, M.S. 'll is a
new organization aiming to bring talented in
novators and entrepreneurs together to
change the now standard startup cycle into a
more collaborative process.
Founder Soup seeks to reverse the typical

VC funding cycle, "turning this process on its
head," according to the group's website.
Founder Soup seeks to bring together the tech
nical talent necessary for putting ideas into
practice instead of following the traditional
founding route of a company.
The idea for a simplified founder search
started when Dorsey began to receive in
quiries from entrepreneurs looking for techni
cal talent to round out their teams. This simple
idea grew into Founder Soup, which had its
first event of the year last Thursday at the In
stitute of Design at Stanford (d.school).
More than 170 Stanford students were in
attendance, eager to hear pitches and network
after the event. Fifty founders submitted their
ideas for review, and 20 were given the oppor
tunity to make a 90-second pitch to the group.

Aside from giving founders the stage to
present their ideas, Founder Soup also provid
ed "pitch practice sessions" to help perfect
founders' presentations through constructive
feedback.
