## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Matt Bettonville 
More than 125 prints of the works by
Great Depression photographer
Walker Evans went on display
Wednesday at the Cantor Arts
Museum. The collection, meant to
juxtapose the struggles of the De
pression era with the economic
struggles of the present day, will
remain on display until April 8,
according to a University press
release.
Evans, who passed away in
1975 at the age of 71, resented de
veloping social programs of the
era. According to English profes
sor Gavin Jones in the press re
lease, the purpose of Evans' art is,
"respecting the moral integrity of
the poor while recognizing in
these tenants something transcen
dentally human."
Jones will host a free book dis
cussion on Feb. 25, as part of the
exhibit. His book titled, "Ameri
can Hungers: The Problem of
Poverty in U.S. Literature," which
examines the works of Evans and
others in the era, will be the sub
ject of the event.
The display, entitled, "Walker
Evans," also holds the work of
James Agee, a Depression-era au
thor who worked and traveled
with Evans while reporting for
Fortune magazine. Agee's writing
helps enlighten Evans' photo
graphs and provides context, ac
cording to the press release.
Agee "sees the poor as beauti
ful but does not believe they are
capable of recognizing their own
beauty," Jones said in the release.
"Sometimes it seems that he finds
them beautiful not despite but be
cause they cannot appreciate their
own value."
The display also features an on
line photography series, Walker
Evans of the Week.
