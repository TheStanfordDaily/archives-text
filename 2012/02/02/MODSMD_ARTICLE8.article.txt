# WORLD & NATION
## Knight Fellow alumni start Egypt project 
### MARWA FARAG MANAGING EDITOR 
At a moment when technology
and journalism increasingly inter
sect, two former Stanford Knight
Journalism Fellows have launched
#lBDayslnEgypt, a collaborative
documentary project about the
Egyptian Revolution. Co-creator
Jigar Mehta and story producer
Hugo Soskin are members of the
Knight Fellowship class of 2011.
On Jan. 19, a group of about 400
people gathered in Tahrir Square
to launch the project's public beta,
which relies on contributors to
submit self-generated media to
create a crowd-sourced documen
tary about the 18 days in early
2011 that resulted in the resigna
tion of former Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak. The documen
tary will also cover developments
in the nation since Feb. 2011.

"During the revolution, I was
impressed by how much media
was being created by people on
the front lines," Mehta said in a
Skype interview with The Daily
from Egypt. He cited images of
protestors recording events on cell
phones and the use of social media
during the revolution.
"I posed the academic ques
tion: is it possible to do a docu
mentary based on all the footage
being created?" Mehta said.
After multiple iterations, the
project became #lBDayslnEgypt.
"It is a documentation process
about the ongoing revolution,"
Mehta said. "It's a living, breathing
... toolkit that allows people to
tell stories of any moment of the
last year or the ongoing revolution
through their media."
The project receives 15 to 20
streams of material a day. Most re
cently, users have contributed
media streams to document
Egypt's Port Said soccer riots on
Feb. 1.
The tool allows contributors to
compile photos, social media in
puts and videos into a slideshow.
The site currently supports Face
book, You Tube, Flickr and Twit
ter, as well as user-uploaded pho
tos, videos and text. Tags identify
ing place, date and other informa
tion are then added to the stream.
The final slideshow creates a
"story of the moment" in a man
ner that allows for "group story
telling," according to Mehta.
"It's not the journalists who
are taking photos; it's everyone,"
he said, explaining the focus on
citizen journalism and crowd
sourcing. "It's kind of crazy how
much media is being created."
The Tribeca Film Institute of
New Media Fund awarded
$lOO,OOO to #lBDayslnEgypt in
Oct. 2011. #lBDayslnEgypt has
since launched a Kickstarter
campaign to fund fellowships for
Egyptian journalists and stu
dents to travel through Egypt to

collect stories.
"I've always been about mak
ing a project that was accessible ..
. that could be a place for Egyp
tians to tell their own stories,"
Mehta said. "We can build what
we think is the perfect product in
Silicon Valley ... but coming to
Cairo is like You Tube coming to
life."
Mehta outlined the next steps
for #lBDayslnEgypt as increasing
the number of contributors and
retaining them, as well as recruit
ing "high-profile media creators"
to contribute streams.

"The next turning point for us
is how to get people to continually

use the site," he said, highlighting
the role of the local fellows in de
veloping this aspect of the project.
Group Stream, a private, beta,
collaborative storytelling plat
form similar to Storify, powers the
venture.
The interactive project has at
tracted the attention of tech mag
azines, while Group Stream has
been named one of the 50 finalists
for Start with Google, a Google
organized competition for the
best technology start-ups in
Egypt.
Mehta, however, focused on
the "iterative process of building a
better product" based on user
feedback.
"We understand that it's [in its]
early days," he said. "We're really
learning along the way."
At the same time, Mehta said
he sees potential in documenting
the revolution through user-creat
ed media.
"Egyptians are recording his
tory that they're participating in,"
Mehta said. "And that's some
thing that we've never seen be
fore."
