## Knight Fellow alumni start Egypt project 
### MARWA FARAG MANAGING EDITOR 
At a moment when technology
and journalism increasingly inter
sect, two former Stanford Knight
Journalism Fellows have launched
#lBDayslnEgypt, a collaborative
documentary project about the
Egyptian Revolution. Co-creator
Jigar Mehta and story producer
Hugo Soskin are members of the
Knight Fellowship class of 2011.
On Jan. 19, a group of about 400
people gathered in Tahrir Square
to launch the project's public beta,
which relies on contributors to
submit self-generated media to
create a crowd-sourced documen
tary about the 18 days in early
2011 that resulted in the resigna
tion of former Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak. The documen
tary will also cover developments
in the nation since Feb. 2011.

"During the revolution, I was
impressed by how much media
was being created by people on
the front lines," Mehta said in a
Skype interview with The Daily
from Egypt. He cited images of
protestors recording events on cell
phones and the use of social media
during the revolution.
"I posed the academic ques
tion: is it possible to do a docu
mentary based on all the footage
being created?" Mehta said.
After multiple iterations, the
project became #lBDayslnEgypt.
"It is a documentation process
about the ongoing revolution,"
Mehta said. "It's a living, breathing
... toolkit that allows people to
tell stories of any moment of the
last year or the ongoing revolution
through their media."
The project receives 15 to 20
streams of material a day. Most re
cently, users have contributed
media streams to document
