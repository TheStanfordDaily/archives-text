Science and Religion: A Dialogue Sermon
Douglas Osheroff, Professor Emeritus of Physics and
Rev. Scotty McLennan, Dean for Religious Life
University Public Worship
at Stanford Memorial Church
Sunday, February 5,10:00 am
University Public Worship will observe Science and Religion Sunday, a day set aside to
recognize that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science can
comfortably coexist.
Memorial Church has historically been an important center
of spiritual and ceremonial life at Stanford University and
University Public Worship has been a Sunday
morning tradition since the church was dedicated
in 1903. It is open to anyone, wherever
you may be on your spiritual journey.
All are welcome to the service and lunch â„¢
discussion in the Round Room after the service.
