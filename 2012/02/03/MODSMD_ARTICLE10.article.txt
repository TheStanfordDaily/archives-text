# SEEING GREEN
## The 						extremity exchange 
### Holly Moeller 
CHRISTCHURCH, New
Zealand I'd been in New
Zealand two days, and
there'd been two shark attacks in
Australian waters. The latest vic
tim, a good-looking snorkeling
guide who seemed remarkably
cheerful about the whole business
("Must have great pain meds," my
hostess said), couldn't wait for his
arm to heal so he could get back in
the water.
Like most of us ocean addicts,
this Aussie appreciated how rare
shark attacks actually are: annu
ally, only 60 are reported world
wide. Though I steadfastly refuse
to watch "Jaws" and am occasion
ally nervous in deep water, I con
fess to far greater fears of giant
anacondas in mysterious fresh
water pools than rogue tiger
sharks over coral reefs.
Actually, my first shark en
counter did more to allay my
fears than any statistic. I just hap
pened to look the right way at the
right time when a six-foot reef
shark cruised by. It took absolute
ly no interest in me whatsoever,
either as food or annoyance
surprising, considering the fuss I
kicked up pointing it out to my
dad, who was counting polyp ten
tacles a few coral heads away.
Since this was the first shark
we'd seen in our (combined)
decades of snorkeling experi
ence, we retell the story often, and
I feel safer every time we do. But
only recently have I fully appreci
ated what a privilege that shark

sighting was and why our en
counters with them are so rare.
Sharks are in serious trouble.
Whether they've been perceived
as a direct threat to human safety
(and trapped or hunted accord
ingly), indirectly suffered as our
competitors (starved by overfish
ing or snarled as bycatch in our
nets) or fed to us themselves,
sharks have known only harm at
the hands of humanity.
Worse, sharks and their sur
rounding ecosystems are ill
equipped to deal with the conse
quences. First, sharks are long
lived. It takes years for them to
reach reproductive maturity
years during which they're vul
nerable to pollution, habitat loss
and hunting —so many sharks
die without replacing themselves.
Second, sharks top the food
chain, helping maintain balance
within their community of fish. In
their absence, mid-level carni
vores boom, sometimes to the
detriment of humans, as is the
case on the Atlantic coast where
the cownose skate (whose popu
lation is normally checked by
sharks) now successfully outcom
petes humans for scallops.
The North Atlantic Ocean
alone has lost half its shark popu
lation. Globally, 110 shark species
one in five members of a group
that's swum Earth's waters for
400 million years are consid
ered vulnerable, threatened or
endangered. Most of these
species are down to 10 or 20 per
cent of their normal population
size.
And each year, while sharks
might claim one human life, hu
mans kill 100 million sharks.
Some are harvested by subsis
tence fishermen as a critical local
protein source. Though shark
meat is typically of low value,
there are markets for it in Aus
tralia, Iceland and parts of Asia. I
even remember a shark steak or
two on my plate as a child.
Nowadays, the real money
maker is the fin. Shark fin soup
basically glorified chicken soup
finished with collagenous fin
fibers was once a rare delicacy
in China. As that country's middle
class continues to rise, so too does
the demand for cultural status
symbols like shark fin soup.
While a full-grown blue shark
(the most common fin source)
weighs up to 450 pounds, its fins
amount to only 1 to 5 percent of
that total. Since shark meat is
nearly worthless compared to the
$3OO per pound that fins bring in,
fishermen are loath to waste

cargo space or fuel transporting
whole sharks. And so the practice
of shark finning cutting the fins
from a live shark, then releasing it
to sink to its death was born.
Regardless of its economic ef
ficiency, shark finning is repug
nant to most sensibilities and has
been banned by many countries,
including the United States in
2000. But these bans often go un
enforced, and sharks, highly mo
bile creatures that they are, fre
quently swim out of regulated
areas anyway.
Fishing restrictions over the
last decade have done little more
than drive the shark fin trade un
derground. So the latest attempts
to slow down the billion-dollar in
dustry have tackled the opposite
end of the line. Conservation
groups recruit celebrities like
Chinese basketball phenom Yao
Ming to publicly reject shark
fin soup. New legislation focuses
on criminalizing the fin market
rather than controlling its source.
Last year, California Governor
Jerry Brown signed Bill AB 376,
which outlaws possession and sale
of shark fins.
Restaurateurs have one year
to serve up existing stocks, so if
you ever wanted a taste of shark
fin soup, I guess now's the time to
get it. I wouldn't though it'll
run you up to $BO a bowl. Plus, like
any oceanic top predator, sharks
carry high levels of bio-accumu
lated mercury not the best
thing for your brain mid-quarter.
If you'd like to get to know
sharks on an intellectual, rather
than gastronomical, level, though,
you should check out the upcom
ing Shark Week activities on cam
pus. Plus, knowledge is free, so un
like a shark fin, this won't cost you
an arm or a leg.

400 million years are consid
ered vulnerable, threatened or
endangered. Most of these
species are down to 10 or 20 per
cent of their normal population
size.
And each year, while sharks
might claim one human life, hu
mans kill 100 million sharks.
Some are harvested by subsis
tence fishermen as a critical local
protein source. Though shark
meat is typically of low value,
there are markets for it in Aus
tralia, Iceland and parts of Asia. I
even remember a shark steak or
two on my plate as a child.
Nowadays, the real money
maker is the fin. Shark fin soup
basically glorified chicken soup
finished with collagenous fin
fibers was once a rare delicacy
in China. As that country's middle
class continues to rise, so too does
the demand for cultural status
symbols like shark fin soup.
While a full-grown blue shark
(the most common fin source)
weighs up to 450 pounds, its fins
amount to only 1 to 5 percent of
that total. Since shark meat is
nearly worthless compared to the
$3OO per pound that fins bring in,
fishermen are loath to waste

cargo space or fuel transporting
whole sharks. And so the practice
of shark finning cutting the fins
from a live shark, then releasing it
to sink to its death was born.
Regardless of its economic ef
ficiency, shark finning is repug
nant to most sensibilities and has
been banned by many countries,
including the United States in
2000. But these bans often go un
enforced, and sharks, highly mo
bile creatures that they are, fre
quently swim out of regulated
areas anyway.
Fishing restrictions over the
last decade have done little more
than drive the shark fin trade un
derground. So the latest attempts
to slow down the billion-dollar in
dustry have tackled the opposite
end of the line. Conservation
groups recruit celebrities like
Chinese basketball phenom Yao
Ming to publicly reject shark
fin soup. New legislation focuses
on criminalizing the fin market
rather than controlling its source.
Last year, California Governor
Jerry Brown signed Bill AB 376,
which outlaws possession and sale
of shark fins.
Restaurateurs have one year
to serve up existing stocks, so if
you ever wanted a taste of shark
fin soup, I guess now's the time to
get it. I wouldn't though it'll
run you up to $BO a bowl. Plus, like
any oceanic top predator, sharks
carry high levels of bio-accumu
lated mercury not the best
thing for your brain mid-quarter.
If you'd like to get to know
sharks on an intellectual, rather
than gastronomical, level, though,
you should check out the upcom
ing Shark Week activities on cam
pus. Plus, knowledge is free, so un
like a shark fin, this won't cost you
an arm or a leg.

The North Atlantic
Ocean alone has
lost half its shark
population.

CHRISTCHURCH, New
Zealand I'd been in New
Zealand two days, and
there'd been two shark attacks in
Australian waters. The latest vic
tim, a good-looking snorkeling
guide who seemed remarkably
cheerful about the whole business
("Must have great pain meds," my
hostess said), couldn't wait for his
arm to heal so he could get back in
the water.
Like most of us ocean addicts,
this Aussie appreciated how rare
shark attacks actually are: annu
ally, only 60 are reported world
wide. Though I steadfastly refuse
to watch "Jaws" and am occasion
ally nervous in deep water, I con
fess to far greater fears of giant
anacondas in mysterious fresh
water pools than rogue tiger
sharks over coral reefs.
Actually, my first shark en
counter did more to allay my
fears than any statistic. I just hap
pened to look the right way at the
right time when a six-foot reef
shark cruised by. It took absolute
ly no interest in me whatsoever,
either as food or annoyance
surprising, considering the fuss I
kicked up pointing it out to my
dad, who was counting polyp ten
tacles a few coral heads away.
Since this was the first shark
we'd seen in our (combined)
decades of snorkeling experi
ence, we retell the story often, and
I feel safer every time we do. But
only recently have I fully appreci
ated what a privilege that shark

sighting was and why our en
counters with them are so rare.
Sharks are in serious trouble.
Whether they've been perceived
as a direct threat to human safety
(and trapped or hunted accord
ingly), indirectly suffered as our
competitors (starved by overfish
ing or snarled as bycatch in our
nets) or fed to us themselves,
sharks have known only harm at
the hands of humanity.
Worse, sharks and their sur
rounding ecosystems are ill
equipped to deal with the conse
quences. First, sharks are long
lived. It takes years for them to
reach reproductive maturity
years during which they're vul
nerable to pollution, habitat loss
and hunting —so many sharks
die without replacing themselves.
Second, sharks top the food
chain, helping maintain balance
within their community of fish. In
their absence, mid-level carni
vores boom, sometimes to the
detriment of humans, as is the
case on the Atlantic coast where
the cownose skate (whose popu
lation is normally checked by
sharks) now successfully outcom
petes humans for scallops.
The North Atlantic Ocean
alone has lost half its shark popu
lation. Globally, 110 shark species
one in five members of a group
that's swum Earth's waters for
400 million years are consid
ered vulnerable, threatened or

species are down to 10 or 20 per
