## Farm now a recruiting hot spot 
### Joseph Beyda 
By now you've probably
heard about Stan
ford's (literally) gar
gantuan 2012 recruit
ing class and the strug
gles of our good ole friends in
Berkeley to keep their commits
interested. That was one fun sign
ing day.
Not only is it amazing that the
Cardinal is bringing in the best
class in school history, but it's also
amazing that Stanford did it with
out any of the things that would
have appealed most to recruits 13
months ago: the chance to be
coached by Jim Harbaugh (and his
enthusiasm, previously unknown
to mankind), the opportunity to
play alongside all-but-assured first
overall pick Andrew Luck and the
likelihood of ending up at a BCS
bowl next season.
I can't say whether the coach
ing staff's sales pitch has changed,
but Stanford now has quite differ
ent laurels to rest on: David
Shaw's soft-spoken confidence
and deep Cardinal heritage, the
appeal of a somewhat anonymous
life on the Farm and an undeni
ably world-class education. All
those things had to have weighed
heavily on the Class of 2012's
minds, and all seem much more
permanent than a coach who be
longed in the NFL, a star quarter
back whose college career eventu
ally had to end and an always-un
predictable shot at an upper-tier
postseason berth.
So as you look at Stanford's
12th-ranked recruiting class, with
its three top-10 offensive linemen,
host of potential defensive play
makers, dynamic group of re
ceivers and well-fathered running
back, all of whom are coming to
the Farm from around the country
for the things that have defined
the school since its inception,
you've just got to ask: has Stan
ford football turned a corner for
the long run?
When people talk about the
Cardinal's conversion from Pac
-10 doormat to national contender
over the past few years, usually
they bring up toughness, a blue
collar work ethic, renovated facil
ities and better coaching. But of
everything that's changed, the one
thing that few people acknowl
edge is the recruits themselves.
Their transformation or,
rather, the transformation in how
they view Stanford is why this
recruiting class was so strong, and
it's also why Stanford's going to be
a force to be reckoned with for the
foreseeable future.
First, there's the issue of the
"anonymity" of Cardinal student
athletes, who enjoy getting lost in
the crowd of Nobel laureates, cut
ting-edge researchers and suc
cessful entrepreneurs who call the
Farm home. Barry Sanders admit
ted that it was an important
(though exaggerated) considera
tion in choosing Stanford. But you
know what? Cardinal student
athletes were just as anonymous
if not more so five or 10
years ago, when the football pro
gram was struggling to stay afloat.
It seems like this only became a
consideration in the last year or
so, when Andrew Luck became a
national figure. But many recruits
have taken notice, and Stanford is
reaping the rewards of that recog
nition.
On the other hand, I'm not
sure that many linemen have to
deal with the attention a star like
Luck would garner. There have
got to be are other reasons why
high-quality players are flocking
to Stanford. The appeal of aca
demics is one likely suspect, but
again, Stanford was never really
outperformed by Division I
schools in that category.
It's safe to say that the atten
tion Stanford has earned during
the Harbaugh-Gerhart-Luck era
is carrying over just enough to
bring in top athletes and fuel this

recruiting push for the time being.
Yet the Cardinal's prospects still
look good for the long run.
Stanford's entrance require
ments have long been considered
the limiting factor for the football
team's success. When recruiting
season comes around, it's hard to
miss coaches being quoted as say
ing something along the lines of,
"There are only a few dozen good
players in the country who could
possibly get in here, and it's our
job to find them."
Fair enough. But why, then, are
those academically inclined re
cruits all of a sudden showing up
at the top of the ESPNU 150?
Shaw seemed to hint at the an
swer after the class was an
nounced. "Every single offer that
we make and everything that we
tell all of these guys is that the
offer is contingent on their admis
sion to Stanford," he told ESPN.
Stanford coaches are known to
start the recruiting process early,
working with guidance counselors
and prospective Cardinal athletes
to make sure that the recruit has
the necessary test scores and
grades to make it to the Farm.
Qualifying for Stanford admis
sion is a lot of work in and of itself,
and if you're a top-tier football re
cruit with offers from a bunch of
top-tier football schools, you
might not be inclined to put in the
effort.
Unless, of course, Stanford is a
top-tier football school. For the
past two or three years, that's what
it's been.
If Sanders and the incoming
offensive linemen live up to ex
pectations, the Cardinal is still
going to be consistently ranked
for the next few years. And if the
pieces fall into place, you're look
ing at a potential BCS bowl berth
in 2014. Stanford has drastically
outperformed its recruiting rank
ings recently; can you imagine if
the coaching staff can pull that off
again, but with a top-15 group?
All the Cardinal has to do is re
main in the national conversation
for the next few years. Then high
caliber recruits will keep working
hard in school, keep getting ad
mitted to Stanford, keep coming
to the Farm.
And keep winning here.

Joseph Beyda was so bummed to
find out that Barry Sanders never
had a nickname that he's deter
mined to find a good one for Barry
J. Sanders. Send him your ideas for
a good sobriquet at jbeyda@stan

those things had to have weighed
heavily on the Class of 2012's
minds, and all seem much more
permanent than a coach who be
longed in the NFL, a star quarter
back whose college career eventu
ally had to end and an always-un
predictable shot at an upper-tier
postseason berth.
So as you look at Stanford's
12th-ranked recruiting class, with
its three top-10 offensive linemen,
host of potential defensive play
makers, dynamic group of re
ceivers and well-fathered running
back, all of whom are coming to
the Farm from around the country
for the things that have defined
the school since its inception,
you've just got to ask: has Stan
ford football turned a corner for
the long run?
When people talk about the
Cardinal's conversion from Pac
-10 doormat to national contender
over the past few years, usually
they bring up toughness, a blue
collar work ethic, renovated facil
ities and better coaching. But of
everything that's changed, the one
thing that few people acknowl
edge is the recruits themselves.
Their transformation or,
rather, the transformation in how
they view Stanford is why this
recruiting class was so strong, and
it's also why Stanford's going to be
a force to be reckoned with for the
foreseeable future.
First, there's the issue of the
"anonymity" of Cardinal student
athletes, who enjoy getting lost in
the crowd of Nobel laureates, cut
ting-edge researchers and suc
cessful entrepreneurs who call the
Farm home. Barry Sanders admit
ted that it was an important
(though exaggerated) considera
tion in choosing Stanford. But you
know what? Cardinal student
athletes were just as anonymous
if not more so five or 10
years ago, when the football pro
gram was struggling to stay afloat.
It seems like this only became a
consideration in the last year or
so, when Andrew Luck became a
national figure. But many recruits
have taken notice, and Stanford is
reaping the rewards of that recog
nition.
On the other hand, I'm not
sure that many linemen have to
deal with the attention a star like
Luck would garner. There have
got to be are other reasons why
high-quality players are flocking
to Stanford. The appeal of aca
demics is one likely suspect, but
again, Stanford was never really
outperformed by Division I
schools in that category.
It's safe to say that the atten
tion Stanford has earned during
the Harbaugh-Gerhart-Luck era
is carrying over just enough to
bring in top athletes and fuel this

recruiting push for the time being.
Yet the Cardinal's prospects still
look good for the long run.
Stanford's entrance require
ments have long been considered
the limiting factor for the football
team's success. When recruiting
season comes around, it's hard to
miss coaches being quoted as say
ing something along the lines of,
"There are only a few dozen good
players in the country who could
possibly get in here, and it's our
job to find them."
Fair enough. But why, then, are
those academically inclined re
cruits all of a sudden showing up
at the top of the ESPNU 150?
Shaw seemed to hint at the an
swer after the class was an
nounced. "Every single offer that
we make and everything that we
tell all of these guys is that the
offer is contingent on their admis
sion to Stanford," he told ESPN.
Stanford coaches are known to
start the recruiting process early,
working with guidance counselors
and prospective Cardinal athletes
to make sure that the recruit has
the necessary test scores and
grades to make it to the Farm.
Qualifying for Stanford admis
sion is a lot of work in and of itself,
and if you're a top-tier football re
cruit with offers from a bunch of
top-tier football schools, you
might not be inclined to put in the
effort.
Unless, of course, Stanford is a
top-tier football school. For the
past two or three years, that's what
it's been.
If Sanders and the incoming
offensive linemen live up to ex
pectations, the Cardinal is still
going to be consistently ranked
for the next few years. And if the
pieces fall into place, you're look
ing at a potential BCS bowl berth
in 2014. Stanford has drastically
outperformed its recruiting rank
ings recently; can you imagine if
the coaching staff can pull that off
again, but with a top-15 group?
All the Cardinal has to do is re
main in the national conversation
for the next few years. Then high
caliber recruits will keep working
hard in school, keep getting ad
mitted to Stanford, keep coming
to the Farm.
And keep winning here.

Joseph Beyda was so bummed to
find out that Barry Sanders never
had a nickname that he's deter
mined to find a good one for Barry
J. Sanders. Send him your ideas for
a good sobriquet at jbeyda@stan
ford.edu.
By now you've probably
heard about Stan
ford's (literally) gar
gantuan 2012 recruit
ing class and the strug
gles of our good ole friends in
Berkeley to keep their commits
interested. That was one fun sign
ing day.
Not only is it amazing that the
Cardinal is bringing in the best
class in school history, but it's also
amazing that Stanford did it with
out any of the things that would
have appealed most to recruits 13
months ago: the chance to be
coached by Jim Harbaugh (and his
enthusiasm, previously unknown
to mankind), the opportunity to
play alongside all-but-assured first
overall pick Andrew Luck and the
likelihood of ending up at a BCS
bowl next season.
I can't say whether the coach
ing staff's sales pitch has changed,
but Stanford now has quite differ
ent laurels to rest on: David
Shaw's soft-spoken confidence
and deep Cardinal heritage, the
appeal of a somewhat anonymous
life on the Farm and an undeni
ably world-class education. All
those things had to have weighed
heavily on the Class of 2012's
minds, and all seem much more
permanent than a coach who be
