# BACK ON TRACK

### MIKE SCHWARTZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's the start of February,
which, in the world of college
basketball, only means one thing.
One more month until March.
With the NCAA March Mad
ness basketball tournament
looming, the Stanford Cardinal
(16-6, 6-4 Pac-12) is one of the
many teams on the bubble. With
a 68-team field, many talented
teams will surely be left out. A
win here or a loss there could de
cide the Card's fate, making
nearly every game a must-win.
This was Stanford's mindset
going into Thursday night's
matchup against the Arizona
State Sun Devils (7-15, 3-7) in
front of the Cardinal's home
crowd at Maples Pavilion, as it
blew the Sun Devils out, 68-44.
Things didn't start out
smoothly for Stanford, however,
as it fell behind 12-7 on a Chris
Colvin three-point jumper with
13:48 left in the first half.
That lead wouldn't last long
for Arizona State, as sophomore
guard Anthony Brown started
heating up. Brown finished the
night with 11 points off the
bench, all of which came in the
last 6:38 of the first half. He went
3-of-5 from the three-point line
during this stretch and added an
outside jumper. This included a
three as the shot clock expired
with just seven seconds left in the
first half, giving Stanford a 28-20
lead going into the break.
This would prove to be all the
momentum the Cardinal need
ed, as it would not fall behind
again. A pair of threes from soph
omore guard Aaron Bright and a
jumper by senior forward Josh
Owens had Stanford up 14 just
two minutes into the second half.
This would be part of a massive
16-1 run for the Cardinal, which

put the team up 44-23 with 13:27
remaining in the second half.
That early deficit was completely
forgotten, as Stanford was now
firing on all cylinders.
The Cardinal continued to
run the table, overwhelming the
Sun Devils with explosive offen
sive attacks and shutdown de
fense. Behind the stellar play of

young guards Bright and fresh
man Chasson Randle, the Stan
ford offense looked like a well
oiled machine. The Cardinal dis
tributed the ball well, recording
14 assists against only four for
Arizona State. This allowed
everyone to get into the act, as
Stanford had a very balanced
scoring attack.

A pair of free throws from
senior forward Andrew Zimmer
man gave Stanford a 27-point
lead, its biggest of the game, with
2:12 on the clock. The Cardinal
would close out the game, giving
the squad a much-needed win.

as the Cardinal improved to 12-1 on its home court with a convincing 68-44 win over Arizona State.
ford, scoring 16 points to go along
with four assists. Randle pitched
in with 14 points as well. The
young guards have been key to
Stanford's offense this year, giv
ing the fans reason to believe that
they have a good couple of years
in store. Still, they have their eyes
set on making a run this season.
After a rough stretch, this win
puts Stanford right back into the
Pac-12 mix. The Cardinal trails
the Washington Huskies, who are
8-2 in the Pac-12, by just two
games, with eight left on the
schedule.
On Saturday, Stanford will
welcome Arizona (15-8, 6-4) into

Maples, and both teams will be
looking to get back-to-back wins
and get back into the heart of the
Pac-12 conference race.
On Thursday, the Wildcats' 78-
74 upset victory over Cal pushed
them to just two games behind
conference leader Washington
and into a tie with Stanford in the
conference standings at 6-4.
If the Cardinal hopes to upset
the Wildcats, its number-one goal
will be to slow down junior forward
Solomon Hill, who leads the team
in just about every offensive cate
gory. The 6-foot-6 Hill averages
12.6 points, 8.3 rebounds and 2.7 as
sists per game, just outpacing sen
ior guard Kyle Fogg's 12.0 points
per game and senior forward Jesse
Perry's 11.6 points per game.
A win for either team would
be a significant boost for the sec
ond half of the conference season,

as the Cardinal and Wildcats are
part of a herd of six teams that
trail Washington by three or
fewer games in the Pac-12. In a
conference with so much parity
and probably only one or two
NCAA Tournament bids on the
line, every win over a quality op
ponent is critical.
The Cardinal and Wildcats tip
off this Saturday at noon at
Maples Pavilion.
