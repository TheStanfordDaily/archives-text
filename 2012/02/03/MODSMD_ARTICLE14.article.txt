And for the Stanford women's
basketball team, that fact was
never truer than on Thursday
night.
In the end, the Cardinal (18-1,
9-0 Pac-12) managed to pull out a
62-49 win over Arizona State
(15-5,6-3) thanks to a dominant
performance from the Ogwu
mike sisters, but not before the
Sun Devils pushed Stanford to
the brink of its first conference
defeat in over two years.
The Sun Devils, the second
best team in the Pac-12, got out
to an early lead thanks to a solid
start from center Kali Bennett,
while both teams struggled to
find net in the first half. A pair of
three-pointers from Cardinal
freshman forward Taylor Green
field and eight points in the last
six minutes of the half from sen
ior forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike left the game tied at 28 at
the half, though.
The pattern of sour shooting
continued for both sides early in
the second half, but Nneka and
Chiney Ogwumike teamed up to
score 10 points in the first six min
utes of the half to give the Cardi
nal a 40-34 lead. That slim lead
evaporated quickly when Sun
Devil guard Micaela Pickens
reeled off six straight points, in
cluding a steal of Nneka Ogwu
mike that led to a fast-break layup

and tied the score at 40 with less
than 12 minutes to go in the game.
Over the next five minutes
though, the Ogwumike sisters
and sophomore guard Toni Ko
kenis rose to the challenge with
strong offense and dogged de
fense, as the trio added nine
points to the Cardinal's total be
fore another Greenfield three
pointer made it 52-40 snuffing
out any upset hopes that the Sun
Devils might have still had.
When all was said and done,
the Cardinal's sister act had put
on a show once again, as Nneka
finished with a team-high 22
points and 16 rebounds and sister
Chiney added 20 points and 16
boards of her own. Greenfield
added 10 points thanks to her
three three-pointers, and Koke
nis rounded out the Cardinal's
top scorers by contributing seven
points of her own.
After a tough fight against the
Sun Devils, Stanford's road trip
does get a little easier on Satur
day. The Cardinal, which is still
leading the Pac-12 thanks to a
spotless conference record, plays
Arizona (13-8,2-7) on Saturday.
While Arizona State was able to
challenge the Cardinal, the story
won't likely be the same for the
Wildcats, who are the worst team
in the conference.
Arizona did start the season on
a scorching run, going 12-2 in its
first 14 games, but has stumbled to
a 1-6 record since then. Junior
guard Davellyn White paces the
Wildcats with 18.2 points per
game, followed by sophomores

Candice Warthen and Erica
Barnes, who add 12.8 and 12.3
points per game, respectively.
With a win over the Wildcats,
the Cardinal would have wins
against every team in the confer
ence this season, an interesting
feat in the first year of the Pac-12.
The Cardinal is a near-lock to

complete another perfect confer
ence season and capture its 12th
consecutive conference title.
Stanford and Arizona tip off
their conference showdown at 1
