# WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Card hopes to move on against UCLA 
### CONNOR SCHERER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming off a 196.800-194.525 loss
against Pac-12 rival Oregon State for its first
defeat of the season, the No. 12 Stanford
women's gymnastics team (4-1,1-1 Pac-12)
hopes to get back to its winning ways on
Sunday against No. 7 UCLA. The meet is the
second of five straight road meets against
Pac-12 opponents for the Cardinal.
UCLA (3-1, 2-1) fell to Washington, a
team Stanford beat by 0.200 points in its sec
ond meet of the season, for its first loss of the

season last Friday. Last season, UCLA was
the defending NCAA champion and had
lofty expectations heading into 2011. How
ever, after losing to the Cardinal in its open
ing meet of the season, the Bruins would go
on to lose to Stanford two more times be
fore beating them in the Pac-10 Champi
onships.
Stanford's meet against Oregon State
was its first road test of the season, and it
looked as though not being at home may
have fazed the Cardinal gymnasts, as the
team posted a season-low 194.525. This
score included a 47.950 on beam, the only

event score below 48.000 for Stanford on the
season, as senior Alyssa Brown's career-best
of 9.925 was not enough to make up for the
team's three falls on the event before her.
Head coach Kristen Smyth attributed the
Cardinal's struggles in large part to the
amount of pressure in the hostile atmos
phere, but hoped the women would be bet
ter prepared for that in the future.
Sunday could potentially mark the offi
cial collegiate debut of sophomore Amanda
Spinner. Despite never having competed in
an official collegiate meet due to
six knee surgeries throughout
her career, Spinner is a captain
and leader of the team. Spinner
scored a 9.625 out of a possible
9.8 in an exhibition routine at
Oregon State and the Cardinal
hopes she can come in and con
tribute right away, especially due
to the health problems that have
plagued the team recently.
The Cardinal and the Bruins
face off Sunday in Los Angeles at
12:30 p.m.
