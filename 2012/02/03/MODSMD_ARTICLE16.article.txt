# WRESTLING
## Packed weekend ahead 
### PALANI ESWARAN STAFF WRITER 
This weekend the Stanford
wrestling team (8-6, 3-1 Pac-12) will
wrestle in two duals, against the Utah
Valley Wolverines at home on Friday
at 6:30 p.m. and against the Arizona
State Sun Devils in Tempe, Ariz., on
Sunday at 11 a.m. The Cardinal will
also wrestle in the California Colle
giate Open on Saturday. But after
this weekend's heavy workload, the
Cardinal will get a brief respite, as it
will not wrestle again until the Pac-12
Championships on Feb. 26.
This Friday's match against Utah
Valley (3-7, 0-3 Western Wrestling
Conference) will be the final home
event for the Cardinal this season.
The Cardinal and Wolverines have
wrestled two common opponents,
Boise State and Chattanooga, and
both teams beat Boise State but lost
to Chattanooga. However, the Card
wrestled a much closer match against
Chattanooga and scored more points
than the Wolverines against Boise
State.
The two teams have also compet
ed in two of the same tournaments:
the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational
and the Midlands Championships.
Stanford finished 25th at both tour
naments without injured star Nick
Amuchastegui, while Utah Valley
finished 23rd in Las Vegas and 24th
at Midlands.
Utah Valley comes into the dual
with one ranked wrestler, No. 12 Josh
Wilson at 149 pounds. The junior is
13-6 on the year, including a victory
over Stanford junior Timmy Boone
at the Las Vegas Invitational by a
score of 3-2.
The California Collegiate Open
will take place at San Francisco State
University. Wrestlers who are red
shirting are allowed to wrestle in the
tournament but will wrestle unat
tached, meaning that their wins will
not contribute to the team score. This
will likely be the final opportunity for
most freshmen to compete in match
es this season.
Finally, Stanford will end the reg
ular season on Sunday at struggling
Arizona State (6-10,2-2 Pac-12).The
Sun Devils' only win in 2012 was a
seven-point victory over Cal State-
Bakersfield. Prior to Sunday's win
