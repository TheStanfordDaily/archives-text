# WRESTLING
## Packed weekend ahead 
### PALANI ESWARAN STAFF WRITER 
This weekend the Stanford
wrestling team (8-6, 3-1 Pac-12) will
wrestle in two duals, against the Utah
Valley Wolverines at home on Friday
at 6:30 p.m. and against the Arizona
State Sun Devils in Tempe, Ariz., on
Sunday at 11 a.m. The Cardinal will
also wrestle in the California Colle
giate Open on Saturday. But after
this weekend's heavy workload, the
Cardinal will get a brief respite, as it
will not wrestle again until the Pac-12
Championships on Feb. 26.
This Friday's match against Utah
Valley (3-7, 0-3 Western Wrestling
Conference) will be the final home
event for the Cardinal this season.
The Cardinal and Wolverines have
wrestled two common opponents,
Boise State and Chattanooga, and
both teams beat Boise State but lost
to Chattanooga. However, the Card
wrestled a much closer match against
Chattanooga and scored more points
than the Wolverines against Boise
State.
The two teams have also compet
ed in two of the same tournaments:
the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational
and the Midlands Championships.
Stanford finished 25th at both tour
naments without injured star Nick
Amuchastegui, while Utah Valley
finished 23rd in Las Vegas and 24th
at Midlands.
Utah Valley comes into the dual
with one ranked wrestler, No. 12 Josh
Wilson at 149 pounds. The junior is
13-6 on the year, including a victory
over Stanford junior Timmy Boone
at the Las Vegas Invitational by a
score of 3-2.
The California Collegiate Open
will take place at San Francisco State
University. Wrestlers who are red
shirting are allowed to wrestle in the
tournament but will wrestle unat
tached, meaning that their wins will
not contribute to the team score. This
will likely be the final opportunity for
most freshmen to compete in match
es this season.
Finally, Stanford will end the reg
ular season on Sunday at struggling
Arizona State (6-10,2-2 Pac-12).The
Sun Devils' only win in 2012 was a
seven-point victory over Cal State-
Bakersfield. Prior to Sunday's win
over Bakersfield, the Sun Devils
had lost seven duals in a row.
Arizona State doesn't have
any ranked wrestlers, but Stan
ford will have some tough
matches come Sunday. Sun
Devil senior 174-pounder Eric

Starks finished third last year in
the Pac-12 Tournament and
qualified for the NCAAs, though
he shouldn't give Amuchastegui
much trouble. Amuchastegui
hasn't wrestled many close
matches this season and has
blown out multiple ranked op
ponents.
Sun Devil heavyweight Levi
Cooper is an All-American, so he
should have a good match against
Cardinal sophomore Dan Scher

er, who is unranked but has put
together a very strong season.
Stanford is coming off a tough
loss to top-15 Oregon State, so the
squad needs to bounce back this
weekend. The Cardinal's
wrestlers will need to build on
their strong second half of the
season in the final weekend be
fore the postseason.
