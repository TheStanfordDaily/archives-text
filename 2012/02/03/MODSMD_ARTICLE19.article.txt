## THE 						5 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE OSCAR NOMINATIONS 
### 
The 2012 Oscar nominees were announced last week, with possibly one
too many surprises. Here's the lowdown on what you should know.

The Artist takes over
Even though "Hugo" has the most nominations at 11, the black-and-white
silent movie "The Artist" is the front-runner for Best Picture. It has been
sweeping up awards left and right, and nothing is going to stop it now.

The Academy likes awkward numbers
This year we have an uncomfortably-odd nine nominees for Best Picture. This
is due to a rule change in the preferential voting system, made to encourage
greater passion for the films and create a slate more representative of the
strength of the year. This experiment seems to have failed with "Extremely
Loud and Incredibly Close" getting a best picture nomination with a paltry 46
percent on Rotten Tomatoes.

Best Actor is up for grabs . . .
There are two acting categories that have inevitable winners and two with
very large question marks. Christopher Plummer ("Beginners") and Octavia
Spencer ("The Help") have won every precursor award out there and should
repeat their wins in the supporting categories on Oscar night. Best Actor is a
three-man race between George Clooney ("The Descendants"), Brad Pitt
("Moneyball") and Jean Dujardin ("The Artist"). It's anyone's game.

. . . and so is Best Actress
Best Actress has been neatly divided between Viola Davis ("The Help") and
Meryl Streep ("The Iron Lady"). Don't count either lady out yet. Meryl hasn't
won since 1982 and Viola was viciously snubbed a couple years ago for her
supporting role in "Doubt," in which Meryl Streep also starred.

Oscar nominations mean nothing
There were three big omissions from the acting categories this year. Just last
week we lauded Tilda Swinton in "We Need to Talk About Kevin," and she
had every precursor nomination for Best Actress in the bag, but was one
upped by Rooney Mara in "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo." Michael
Fassbender was also overlooked for "Shame," and Albert Brooks just barely
missed for "Drive." Though they didn't get Oscar nominations, you should
still go check out these incredible films and hold your favorite movie of 2011
dear to your heart, whether it's "The Tree of Life," "Super 8" or "Mr.
Popper's Penguins."
