## 'High demand' for Overseas Seminars 
### ILEANA NAJARRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following a two-year hiatus of its summer Overseas Semi
nars, the Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP) received
over 460 applications this past weekend for its five 2012-13 pro
grams, according to BOSP Enrollment Services Coordinator
Alyssa Geiger.
The three-week seminars, which are capped at an enroll
ment of 15 students each, will take students to Brazil, India, the
Netherlands, Tanzania and Turkey. Applications for the semi
nars were due at 11:59 p.m. this past Sunday, Jan. 29.
BOSP Director Robert Sinclair said the ratio of applica
tions to particular sites is much higher this round than com
pared to what it has been in previous years. He credits pent-up
demand for the seminars, this year's chosen locations and lead
ing faculty for the increase.
"I think the message is clear that this is a very popular pro
gram amongst the students and there's a high demand for it,"
Sinclair said.
According to Sinclair, BOSP has already sent a funding re-

quest to the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation for eight seminars in 2013-
14 and may submit one or two
more for the following year.
"We wanted to provide oppor
tunities for students complemen
tary to the regular quarter-long
programs, and so we identified lo
cations that would do that and
provide new opportunities for stu
dents," Sinclair said.
The Istanbul seminar, titled,
"City of Empires: History, Memo
ry and Global Experience in East
ern Mediterranean," received 155
applicants, making it the most
popular choice among students.
The seminar will be Stanford's
first study abroad opportunity in
the Middle East.
Ali Yaycioglu, history profes
sor and leader of the Istanbul
seminar, said there is a growing
interest in the Middle East on
campus. Yaycioglu said he is excit
ed to share the city with his stu
dents while exploring it from a
historical and anthropological
perspective.
"We are going to see how one
of the most historically complicat
ed cities of the world is function
ing and operating in postmodern
times of global expansion and
global finance," Yaycioglu said.
Students participating in the Is
tanbul trip will get a chance to
showcase photographs, writings
and sketches from the trip in an
exhibit currently being planned
for this coming fall quarter.
Yaycioglu added that since Koc
University is providing some ac
commodations for the trip, both
Stanford and Koc will gain a lot
through the mutual exposure,
"It goes beyond just Overseas
Seminars. For us it shows the inter
est of the student body towards
certain geography, culture and is
sues," Yaycioglu said.
Marilia Librandi-Rocha, assis
tant professor of Brazilian litera
ture and culture and leader of the
Brazil seminar, wrote in an email
to The Daily that long-term bene
fits apply to her class, as well.
"I believe that besides the

exact number of applicants, Stan
ford University is looking ahead:
Brazil is an important new part
ner and this is the right moment
to firm a connection [sic]," Li
brandi-Rocha said. "Brazil's
growing investments in educa
tion and in technology need Stan
ford knowledge. Both parts have
a lot to gain."
Fifty-seven students applied
to the "Rio de Janeiro: A Cultur
al History" seminar.
For Robert Siegel, associate
professor of microbiology and
immunology and leader of "Is
sues of Development in North
ern Tanzania," the hardest part
will be selecting 15 participants
from the 79 applicants for his
seminar. Nevertheless, Siegel is
still looking forward to leading
this trip again after having done
so six years ago.
"I think for a lot of the stu
dents there's an excitement to be
able to experience Africa par
ticularly East Africa and the
culture there," Siegel said. "I think
a lot of students are interested in
the topic of development."
Music Professor Mark Apple
baum will offer "The Amsterdam
Trans-Idiomatic Arts Practicum in
the Netherlands." Thomas
Hansen, Sharika Thiranagama
and Sangeeta Mediratta will lead
students in "Minority as Cultural
Form in South Asia" in New Delhi
and Mumbai, India.
Respectively, 122 and 54 stu
dents applied to the seminars.
According to Sinclair, the stu
dents will be notified of final ac
ceptance decisions on March 2.
Faculty will have until then to re
view the applications and host in
terviews if they wish, but the crite
ria for selecting students is still up
to the discretion of each individual
faculty member.
Sinclair said he is very excited
to be offering the program once
again.
"We've worked hard to pro
vide this new opportunity, and it's
terrific for us to see the response,"
Sinclair said. "We would like in
turn to respond to that level of
support and provide increasing
opportunities over the years for
students."

Netherlands, Tanzania and Turkey. Applications for the semi
nars were due at 11:59 p.m. this past Sunday, Jan. 29.
BOSP Director Robert Sinclair said the ratio of applica
tions to particular sites is much higher this round than com
pared to what it has been in previous years. He credits pent-up
demand for the seminars, this year's chosen locations and lead
ing faculty for the increase.
"I think the message is clear that this is a very popular pro
gram amongst the students and there's a high demand for it,"
Sinclair said.
According to Sinclair, BOSP has already sent a funding re-

quest to the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation for eight seminars in 2013-
14 and may submit one or two
more for the following year.
"We wanted to provide oppor
tunities for students complemen
tary to the regular quarter-long
programs, and so we identified lo
cations that would do that and
provide new opportunities for stu
dents," Sinclair said.
The Istanbul seminar, titled,
"City of Empires: History, Memo
ry and Global Experience in East
ern Mediterranean," received 155
applicants, making it the most
popular choice among students.
The seminar will be Stanford's
first study abroad opportunity in
the Middle East.
Ali Yaycioglu, history profes
sor and leader of the Istanbul
seminar, said there is a growing
interest in the Middle East on
campus. Yaycioglu said he is excit
ed to share the city with his stu
dents while exploring it from a
historical and anthropological
perspective.
"We are going to see how one
of the most historically complicat
ed cities of the world is function
ing and operating in postmodern
times of global expansion and
global finance," Yaycioglu said.
Students participating in the Is
tanbul trip will get a chance to
showcase photographs, writings
and sketches from the trip in an
exhibit currently being planned
for this coming fall quarter.
Yaycioglu added that since Koc
University is providing some ac
commodations for the trip, both
Stanford and Koc will gain a lot
through the mutual exposure,
"It goes beyond just Overseas
Seminars. For us it shows the inter
est of the student body towards
certain geography, culture and is
sues," Yaycioglu said.
Marilia Librandi-Rocha, assis
tant professor of Brazilian litera
ture and culture and leader of the
Brazil seminar, wrote in an email
to The Daily that long-term bene
fits apply to her class, as well.
"I believe that besides the

exact number of applicants, Stan
ford University is looking ahead:
Brazil is an important new part
ner and this is the right moment
to firm a connection [sic]," Li
brandi-Rocha said. "Brazil's
growing investments in educa
tion and in technology need Stan
ford knowledge. Both parts have
a lot to gain."
Fifty-seven students applied
to the "Rio de Janeiro: A Cultur
al History" seminar.
For Robert Siegel, associate
professor of microbiology and
immunology and leader of "Is
sues of Development in North
ern Tanzania," the hardest part
will be selecting 15 participants
from the 79 applicants for his
seminar. Nevertheless, Siegel is
still looking forward to leading
this trip again after having done
so six years ago.
"I think for a lot of the stu
dents there's an excitement to be
able to experience Africa par
ticularly East Africa and the
culture there," Siegel said. "I think
a lot of students are interested in
the topic of development."
Music Professor Mark Apple
baum will offer "The Amsterdam
Trans-Idiomatic Arts Practicum in
the Netherlands." Thomas
Hansen, Sharika Thiranagama
and Sangeeta Mediratta will lead
students in "Minority as Cultural
Form in South Asia" in New Delhi
and Mumbai, India.
Respectively, 122 and 54 stu
dents applied to the seminars.
According to Sinclair, the stu
dents will be notified of final ac
ceptance decisions on March 2.
Faculty will have until then to re
view the applications and host in
terviews if they wish, but the crite
ria for selecting students is still up
to the discretion of each individual
faculty member.
Sinclair said he is very excited
to be offering the program once
again.
"We've worked hard to pro
vide this new opportunity, and it's
terrific for us to see the response,"
Sinclair said. "We would like in
turn to respond to that level of
support and provide increasing
opportunities over the years for
students."
