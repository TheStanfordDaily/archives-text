## WILCO SHINES 
### â€“ lauren WILSON contact lauren: lhwilson@stanford. edu 
People who complain about how much music
sucks today need look no further than Wilco
to have their arguments squashed. While
other bands have shot to superstardom and either
flamed out or comfortably nestled in mediocrity, the
Chicago-based band has steadily chugged along,
sneakily becoming one of the most important
American rock bands around. Despite that, the
members of Wilco still maintain a relatively low pro
file. Five of the six guys are married and, when not
on the road, frontman Jeff Tweedy leads a regular life
as a middle-aged dad out in the suburbs of northern
Chicago.
Over the course of nearly two decades, these
regular-guy rock stars have cultivated a dedicated fan
base that loyally turns out in droves for Tweedy and
Co.'s live shows. Their show last Saturday night at the
San Jose Civic Auditorium, where Wilco played the
first of four sold-out Bay Area shows, was no excep
tion. The crowd was an odd mix, dominated by
older, longtime fans with younger, standard hipsters
sprinkled in between.
Wilco kicked off the night with "One Sunday
Morning," the contemplative 12-minute closer of
their newest record, "The Whole Love," before kick
ing it up a couple notches with the frenetic, water
droplet sounds of "Art of Almost." At 20 minutes
into the set, the guys had only made it through two
songs. Opening with the lengthy, elegiac "Morning"

and following it up with the experimental "Almost"
was a bold move that served as a further testament
that, at this point in their career, Wilco's all about the
music. They're willing to forgo conventions in favor
of indulging fans with the intricacies of their craft.
Just listen to the plaintive twinges of Nels Cline's gui
tar during "Morning."
Columns upon columns of knotted white fabric
hung from the stage s grating, which at first looked
like the attempts of multiple inmates to escape from
prison. However, the cloth caught the kaleidoscopic
lights in unusual ways, immediately changing its
effect from confounding to entrancing.
Wilco's genre-melding career has spawned a
diverse catalog, from the bluesy flair of "Side with the
Seeds" to the twangy groove of "California Stars."
Fans stomped and sang along to old favorites, such
as "Box Full of Letters" and "I'm Always in Love."
Tweedy and Co. only dipped into their seminal
record "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" twice, with tender
treatments of classics "Jesus, Etc." and "War on War,"
neither of which has lost its verve in the decade since
they were first released.
The band banged out a respectable 23-song set,
peppered here and there with self-deprecating banter
and corny jokes from Tweedy. High points included
