## LIVIN' LA VIDA VEGGIE

After recently switching to a plant
based (almost strictly vegetarian) diet
this summer, I realized that a vegetar
ian diet needs to function like a successful
marriage: It should be sustainable for the
long term but it also needs to stay exciting in
order to flourish. Just like marriage, vegetari
an diets make things complicated when it
comes to socializing. Where should a vege
tarian go out to eat where she won't get stuck
with either a) nothing to eat b) an iceberg
wedge or c) cheese ravioli with cream sauce?
Just like I hope to do if I one day find myself
married; I attempted to find ways to keep the
magic alive between my vegetarian diet and
me when I go out to eat. Here's what I tried:
LYFE Kitchen (Love Your Food
Everyday) recently opened on Hamilton Ave
in downtown Palo Alto. The restaurant's
concept is healthy fast food and its CEO is a
former McDonald's executive. Although this
lively spot has a bright interior complete

with a verdant herb garden, it still exudes an
air of sterile commercialism that is reminis
cent of other franchises or chain restaurants.
The menu itself is impressive in its vast
array of vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free
options. The flatbread pizzas, however, failed
to impress. Although I am usually one who
goes wild for flatbread pizza, this one was
like a cracker loaded with cheese and
pomodoro sauce. Similarly, the roasted
mushroom and goat cheese pizza was flavor
ful but a touch too sweet due to the pome
granate balsamic, caramelized onions, and
goat cheese. The daily soups are often vegan
and therefore many are made with (in my
opinion too much) coconut milk. The roast
ed beet and farro salad, however, was a deli
cious selection of seasonal produce, nuts and
fruits and I added the gardein (garden pro
tein, kind of like tofu), which tasted surpris
ingly like chicken. As far as LYFE's other
meat alternatives, the entree "Art's Unfried

Gardein"

actually tasted

almost exactly like

fried chicken. While I nor-

mally eschew diet foods that

unabashedly attempt to imi-

tate real foods, I thought that this one was
actually quite tasty. All in all, LYFE Kitchen
delivers a solid menu, but the flavors and
seasonings prove that less is more.
Verdict: Just friends.
Another spot I tried was Reposado,
also on Hamilton Avenue. Reposado, an
upscale and swanky Mexican restaurant, fea
tures unique twists on old favorites.
Reposado isn't marketed as a vegetarian
restaurant and offers various meat, fish, and
poultry options, making it an easy sell to
friends. Common dining etiquette asserts
that one should not fill up on chips before
the meal, but quite frankly the chips, gua
camole and salsas at Reposado are worth it.

The guacamole is extremely zesty, made with
liberal amounts of lime and cilantro and
topped with queso anejo (shredded cheese).
As far as vegetarian options go, Reposado
actually provides a separate vegetarian menu

something rather rare at upscale restau
rants. Instead of chastising diners for vege
tarian preferences, this restaurant offers vari
ous meatless entrees that do not leave the
meat to be desired. The vegetarian tacos are
tasty, as are the unique, bean-filled ravioli.
The only notable downside to Reposado is
the bill at the end of the meal.
Verdict: I'd be ready for a second date.
There's one restaurant, however, to
which I just can't stop returning: Oren's

Hummus Shop. This small and unpreten
tious cafe is new to the scene of trendy spots
along University Avenue, having just opened
this past summer. Oren's Hummus Shop
serves the best hummus I have ever tasted.
(Yes, at first I too was skeptical that another
pita and hummus restaurant was opening
downtown, but Oren's hummus is in a
whole different league). I particularly enjoy
the hummus topped with beans and tahini,
and both the regular pita and the whole-

wheat pita are irresistibly fluffy. Diners are
also greeted with spicy green harissa sauce, a
spicy red pepper sauce and a cabbage appe
tizer, all of which are delicious. I have tasted
most of the dips and small plates, my
favorite of which were the Moroccan carrots,
the baba ghanoush (eggplant dip), the falafel
and the Israeli chopped salad. The prices are
reasonable and the small plates make this a
perfect place to go to share bites with friends.
The only downside is the inefficient service. I

can work with that.
Verdict: Potential relationship. I wouldn't
mind going home to that hummus day after
day, year after year.
