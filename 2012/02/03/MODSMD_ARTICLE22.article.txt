Three years ago, Sameer Gadhia 'll
was a typical parent's dream a
smart kid studying Human Biology at
Stanford, getting involved in his spare time by
singing in Talisman and enjoying Greek life
in Sigma Nu. And then, like all nerdy
Stanford students with vague aspirations of

medical school, Gadhia did what any of them
would do: drop out and become a rock star.
The Irvine, Calif., native is the frontman
of Orange County band Young the Giant
who have been gaining more and more trac
tion with the modern alt-rock sheen of their
self-tided debut. 2011 was a stellar breakout

year for them with performances on "The
Tonight Show" and the MTV Video Music
Awards, which Gadhia sees as only the begin
ning.
"You know, I'm very, very happy and
very lucky that we've been put in this situa
tion," he said. "But we hope that this isn't the
climax or the peak for us."
In fact, when it comes to singling out a
particular "we've made it" moment, Gadhia
doesn't even consider his band's high profile
gigs
"lt's just [to] be able to travel around the
world and play shows to people that we've
never seen or met, who don't even speak our
language," Gadhia said. "We can't speak
theirs, but we can connect through the
songs."
However, he doesn't discount their
August showing at the VMAs. The band was

joined by fans onstage as they closed out the
ceremony with their galloping anthem "My
Body." The post-VMA boost was immediate
ly evident when the group saw themselves
trending on Twitter.
Now, the band formerly known as the
fakes is hoping to begin another banner year
by launching their second headlining tour
next week at the Fillmore in San Francisco.
This is their first foray into the big leagues,
stepping up from small-capacity venues to a
full production. Twenty-nine out of their
scheduled 45 shows are already sold-out.
It's a lot to take in for a group of guys
who have been playing together since adoles-

cence. Though big mainstream
fame and success seem immi
nent for them, in many ways, the
members of Young the Giant are
your typical young 20-some
things experiencing the real
world for the first time and try
ing to carve out a career. They all
live together in a big house in
Los Angeles and are still subject
to everyday annoyances like rent
though they'll return to the
vagabond lifestyle as soon as
they hit the road. Despite spend
ing inordinate amounts of time
together as housemates and
bandmates, the fivesome never
get sick of one another.
"It's strange because we
hang out 24/7," Gadhia admit
ted. "We're very close we'll do
four months on the road and
then we'll come back home for a
little bit, and you know, maybe
we'll spend a day or two with
families, but in two days, we'll
just start calling each other again
to hang out [laughs], and so it's
never really done for us."
Gadhia's excited for the tour
launch in San Francisco since,
outside of minor appearances in
events like Not So Silent Night,
the band hasn't played a real Bay
Area show in a while. He'll also
be close to the Farm, where he
would've been toting a degree
from by now if he hadn't left.

However, Gadhia has no regrets
about putting his studies on
hold.
"I think when I was at
Stanford, I was a little confused
like a lot of Stanford students are
as to what I wanted to major in,"
he said. "I was doing Humßio,
but I really wasn't sure what I
wanted to do. It's really been
helping me out, just being able
to experience real life and seeing
what it's like now that everything
is really going okay."
Gadhia insists he'll finish
his education someday, a notion
that can grant his beleaguered
parents some rest. Though Mr.
and Mrs. Gadhia have come to
accept their son's lifestyle, that's
not to say they wouldn't get
behind him tossing away the mic
for a degree.
"If I went to med school,
they'd be ecstatic," Gadhia
laughed. "I think at this point,
their expectations have been
dumbed down a lot. I think,
when I was at Stanford, it was
more like 'yeah you should go to
med school' like they wanted to
push me, but now it's like 'just
fucking graduate, just fucking
graduate, please.'"
But for now, Gadhia's
heart is in the studio and on
the stage doing the Wacky
Walk in Stanford Stadium will I

have to wait.

to everyday annoyances like rent
though they'll return to the
vagabond lifestyle as soon as
they hit the road. Despite spend
ing inordinate amounts of time
together as housemates and
bandmates, the fivesome never
get sick of one another.
"It's strange because we
hang out 24/7," Gadhia admit
ted. "We're very close we'll do
four months on the road and
then we'll come back home for a
little bit, and you know, maybe
we'll spend a day or two with
families, but in two days, we'll
just start calling each other again
to hang out [laughs], and so it's
never really done for us."
Gadhia's excited for the tour
launch in San Francisco since,
outside of minor appearances in
events like Not So Silent Night,
the band hasn't played a real Bay
Area show in a while. He'll also
be close to the Farm, where he
would've been toting a degree
from by now if he hadn't left.

However, Gadhia has no regrets
about putting his studies on
hold.
"I think when I was at
Stanford, I was a little confused
like a lot of Stanford students are
as to what I wanted to major in,"
he said. "I was doing Humßio,
but I really wasn't sure what I
wanted to do. It's really been
helping me out, just being able
to experience real life and seeing
what it's like now that everything
is really going okay."
Gadhia insists he'll finish
his education someday, a notion
that can grant his beleaguered
parents some rest. Though Mr.
and Mrs. Gadhia have come to
accept their son's lifestyle, that's
not to say they wouldn't get
behind him tossing away the mic
for a degree.
"If I went to med school,
they'd be ecstatic," Gadhia
laughed. "I think at this point,
their expectations have been
dumbed down a lot. I think,
when I was at Stanford, it was
more like 'yeah you should go to
med school' like they wanted to
push me, but now it's like 'just
fucking graduate, just fucking
graduate, please.'"
But for now, Gadhia's
heart is in the studio and on
the stage doing the Wacky
Walk in Stanford Stadium will I

have to wait.
Three years ago, Sameer Gadhia 'll
was a typical parent's dream a
smart kid studying Human Biology at
Stanford, getting involved in his spare time by
singing in Talisman and enjoying Greek life
in Sigma Nu. And then, like all nerdy
Stanford students with vague aspirations of

medical school, Gadhia did what any of them
would do: drop out and become a rock star.
The Irvine, Calif., native is the frontman
of Orange County band Young the Giant
who have been gaining more and more trac
tion with the modern alt-rock sheen of their
self-tided debut. 2011 was a stellar breakout

year for them with performances on "The
Tonight Show" and the MTV Video Music
Awards, which Gadhia sees as only the begin
ning.
"You know, I'm very, very happy and
very lucky that we've been put in this situa
tion," he said. "But we hope that this isn't the
climax or the peak for us."
In fact, when it comes to singling out a
particular "we've made it" moment, Gadhia
doesn't even consider his band's high profile
gigs
"lt's just [to] be able to travel around the
world and play shows to people that we've
never seen or met, who don't even speak our
language," Gadhia said. "We can't speak
theirs, but we can connect through the
songs."
However, he doesn't discount their
August showing at the VMAs. The band was

joined by fans onstage as they closed out the
ceremony with their galloping anthem "My
Body." The post-VMA boost was immediate
ly evident when the group saw themselves
trending on Twitter.
Now, the band formerly known as the
fakes is hoping to begin another banner year
by launching their second headlining tour
next week at the Fillmore in San Francisco.
This is their first foray into the big leagues,
stepping up from small-capacity venues to a
full production. Twenty-nine out of their
scheduled 45 shows are already sold-out.
It's a lot to take in for a group of guys
who have been playing together since adoles-

cence. Though big mainstream
fame and success seem immi
nent for them, in many ways, the
members of Young the Giant are
your typical young 20-some
things experiencing the real
world for the first time and try
ing to carve out a career. They all
live together in a big house in
Los Angeles and are still subject
to everyday annoyances like rent
though they'll return to the
vagabond lifestyle as soon as
they hit the road. Despite spend
ing inordinate amounts of time
together as housemates and
bandmates, the fivesome never
get sick of one another.
