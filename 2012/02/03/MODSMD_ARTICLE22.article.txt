Three years ago, Sameer Gadhia 'll
was a typical parent's dream a
smart kid studying Human Biology at
Stanford, getting involved in his spare time by
singing in Talisman and enjoying Greek life
in Sigma Nu. And then, like all nerdy
Stanford students with vague aspirations of

medical school, Gadhia did what any of them
would do: drop out and become a rock star.
The Irvine, Calif., native is the frontman
of Orange County band Young the Giant
who have been gaining more and more trac
tion with the modern alt-rock sheen of their
self-tided debut. 2011 was a stellar breakout

year for them with performances on "The
Tonight Show" and the MTV Video Music
Awards, which Gadhia sees as only the begin

"You know, I'm very, very happy and
very lucky that we've been put in this situa

climax or the peak for us."
In fact, when it comes to singling out a
particular "we've made it" moment, Gadhia
doesn't even consider his band's high profile
gigs
"lt's just [to] be able to travel around the
world and play shows to people that we've
never seen or met, who don't even speak our
language," Gadhia said. "We can't speak
theirs, but we can connect through the
songs."
However, he doesn't discount their
August showing at the VMAs. The band was

joined by fans onstage as they closed out the
ceremony with their galloping anthem "My
Body." The post-VMA boost was immediate
ly evident when the group saw themselves
trending on Twitter.
Now, the band formerly known as the
fakes is hoping to begin another banner year
by launching their second headlining tour
next week at the Fillmore in San Francisco.
This is their first foray into the big leagues,
stepping up from small-capacity venues to a
full production. Twenty-nine out of their
scheduled 45 shows are already sold-out.
It's a lot to take in for a group of guys
who have been playing together since adoles-
