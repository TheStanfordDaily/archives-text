The idea of loving Kanye West,
Kobe Bryant or Aziz Ansari
isn't foreign. But when you
put them all together alongside the
bests of business and entertainment,
in the most dapper of duds and
wrapped in self-satirizing Illuminati
pretension, that just tickles our fancy
into a whole new arena of idoliza
tion. We love Nike's ad campaign:
the Kobe System.
After watching half a dozen of these
videos minute-long You Tube pro
motions released by nikebasketball
I'm still not quite sure what
they're advertising. Premised around
a fictional seminar taught by Kobe
Bryant on achieving success beyond
success, this unabashedly absurd
mini-mini-series showcases the best
in the business, in the broadest
celebrity-sweeping marketing move
since the telethon.
The first installment, "Welcome to
the #KobeSystem" introduces the sit
uation and characters, who are all at
the top of their games in their

respective fields: Leehom Wang (Chinese
megastar), Sir Richard Branson (Virgin
Airlines) and Aziz Ansari (comedian). Kobe
promises the answer to the conundrum of
where to go if you're at the top: over the top!
A clever logo, visually and metaphorical
ly reminiscent of Mason iconography, adorns
each member to the Kobe clan, and Kobe's
ridiculous black and yellow (blackandyellow)
track suit sets the color scheme for the logo

and product as well. I think it might be bas
ketball shoes? I can't be sure.
Following the pilot, later episodes reveal
different 'levels' of the Kobe System, each
ostensibly offering some didactic commen
tary on varying areas of success, in sports and
in life. Of the seven levels released (so far), my
favorite, hands down, comes from "Kanye
West: Level 6 Beastion". In 32 succulent sec
onds, Kanye proves he has the attitude (and
maybe even acting skills) to please in any
arena. And whoever wrote this cryptic scene
has a knack for capturing that alluring sense
of enigma while simultaneously parodying
the modern trend of blind adulation. And
therein lies the secret juice to these sweet
videos: They exude pretension, and at the
same time, slap it in the face.
The absurdity seeps off the screen, but
like some meta-viewing phenomenon, only
the truly keen will grasp it in full. The cultur
ally inclined will laugh, bros and basketball
freaks will bump fists, but only the critical
cognoscenti will appreciate this work for its
comedy and artistry. Facetiously celebrating
indulgence and elitism products of hard
work rather than passive inheritance, mind
you makes a refreshing return to the world
of advertising, where in recent months gener
al opprobrium and one percent-directed
detesting has dominated the airwaves. And
whatever it is that the #KobeSystem advertises
will probably do great in sales it even has
its own hashtag.
