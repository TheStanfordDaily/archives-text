## ANN PATCHETT TALKS NOVELS AND NEWS BOOK critiqua 
### â€“ sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
It takes a bit of star power for any lecturer
to fill Cemex Auditorium on a school
night but the New York Times best
selling author Ann Patch eft spoke to a full
house on Monday evening. She was intro-

duced by Professor
Tobias Wolff, who
fondly recalled a 20-
something Patchett
just embarking on her
literary career. He
described her latest

novel, "State of Wonder," as evocative of the
myth of Orpheus in the Underworld and of
Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," praising in par
ticular the book's deep mythic structure and
Patchett's careful research. Alluding to a scene
in which a character gives birth in the middle
of the Amazon, Wolff remarked, "If I needed
a Caesarean, I think she [Patchett] could do it
for me!"
Patchett took the stage and spoke briefly
about the process of researching a novel. She
described her own methods as "composting"
learning as much as possible about the rel
evant subject and then forgetting about it,
allowing it to seep organically into her writ
ing. She drew a wave of chuckles from the
audience when she admitted her irritation
with books that flaunted just how much
research the author had done.
She then read a scene from "State of
Wonder" in which an anaconda boards the
boat that three American doctors and their
native guides are steering down the Amazon
River. (If you're looking for more snake
scenes, Patchett recommends Rudyard
Kipling's "The Jungle Book," which she read
on the plane from Nashville.) The passage was
inspired, she said, by an eventful research trip:
she was on a boat in the Amazon with a local
guide and a number of tourists when one of
the guests a professional snake handler
reached into the murky water and pulled an
anaconda from the river, providing a moment
of surreal terror for the other passengers and
instant inspiration for Patchett.
Patchett proceeded to open the floor for
questions. The first was a predictable inquiry
about her new independent bookstore,
Parnassus Books, which had garnered cover

age from numerous major media outlets,
including the New York Times and NPR.
Patchett delivered a spontaneous, impas
sioned speech about the enduring importance
of literary communities and independent

booksellers; she
explained that as
Nashville bookstores
were being shut down
at a corporate level, the
community was

increasingly concerned about the lack of
bookstores in the city. Finally, she and another
bibliophile, Karen Hayes, decided that if they
wanted a bookstore, they would have to do it
themselves and so Parnassus Books
opened for business in October.
There were many questions about her
personal process of research, writing and edit
ing. Here, Patchett's clever sense of humor
and ability to command the stage truly shone
forth, as her answers included a number of
memorable lines. Patchett mentioned having
to take the anti-malaria medication Lariam,
which her husband, a doctor, prescribed for
her aforementioned trip to the Amazon, and
she remarked that the prescription of a class
four narcotic was a sure indicator of true love.
In answering a different question, she
declined to elaborate on an incident she coyly
referred to as "when I kissed John Updike."
And when asked about inspiration and influ
ences in writing, she replied, "I can trace back
every good thing to where I stole it" a
frank and mindful quip, which earned a
hearty laugh from the audience.
Not only is Patchett a great writer
many attendees were long-time fans she is
an excellent speaker, keeping the crowd
engaged and entertained for more than an
hour. She was truly an inspired choice for the
Lane Lecture Series, and one hopes that the
program will continue to bring authors of
such caliber to campus.
