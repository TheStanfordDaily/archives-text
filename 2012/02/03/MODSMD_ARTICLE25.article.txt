In his first big screen, post-"Harry Potter"
role, Daniel Radcliffe trades wizard
robes for Victorian coattails in director
James Watkins'"The Woman in Black."
Adapted from Susan Hill's gothic novel of
the same name, the lackluster thriller thrives
on cheap scares, but never quite manages to
tap into the pathos of the story about a fami
ly's dark secret.
Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) is a young, wid
owed lawyer forced to leave his son behind in
London on a weekend visit to the countryside
in order to settle the estate of a recently
deceased client. Plagued by memories of his
wife, who died during childbirth, Arthur's
inner demons are no match for what he soon
discovers in the dreary town of Crythin
Gilford, where the reticent locals make no
effort to conceal their displeasure at his arrival.
At the aptly-named Eel Marsh House, a
secluded estate accessible only during low
tide, Arthur begins sifting through the late
Drabslow family's personal effects. He grad-

ually pieces togeti
er their tragic
story, beginning
with the untime
ly death of little
Nathaniel Drabsk

who drowned in the marsh surrounding the
house and was never found. Predictably,
strange things begin to appear around the
abandoned house, yet they are not enough
to deter Arthur from doing his job.
With the help of Sam (Ciaran Hinds),
the only person in town who doesn't seem to
mind his presence, Arthur gets closer to solv
ing the mystery connecting both the
Drabslow family's fate and the mysterious
deaths that plague the town's children. The
only question is whether he can remedy the
situation in time to save his own son.
While Radcliffe is arguably a much bet
ter actor when not portraying a boy wizard
carrying the weight of the magical world on
his shoulders, even with a suit and five

o'clock shadow he does not quite make a
plausible father. But fortunately, scenes with
Arthur and his son are sparse, and instead
Radcliffe grapples for most of the film with
balancing the pesky combination of terror
and compassion that the genre demands.
On that note, "The Woman in Black" is

filled with well-timed little scares sure to
keep audiences on the edge of their seats, but
in general relies too much on gimmicky
shots (the cinematographer seems to have a
penchant for close-ups of creepy dolls) to
make much of a lasting impression. Watkins
is clearly adept at building suspense, but the
overall effect is often sabotaged by silly
seeming dissonant elements, such as a griev
ing mother who spoon-feeds her two small
dogs at the table in lieu of babies. At other
times, the mood is disrupted by uninten
tionally humorous moments.
Most viewers probably won't see the
shocking conclusion coming, but unfortu
nately, by that point it's moot. The identity of
the titular woman in black is the story's
trump card, and once it's out on the table, lit
tle else is offered to keep the viewer engaged.
