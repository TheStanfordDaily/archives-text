Falling somewhere between predictable
romantic comedy and low-budget cop
movie, "One for the Money" adapts
best-selling author Janet Evanovich's 1994
novel into an hour and a half of bland dia
logue and Katherine Heigl's failed attempts
at a New Jersey accent.
Recently laid off from her job as a lin
gerie sales manager at Macy's, Jersey girl
Stephanie Plum (Katherine Heigl) seeks
work as a bounty hunter in her cousin's bail
bond company. The assignments put her on

the track of Joe Morelli (Jason O'Mara), a
former love interest from high school who
broke her heart. Attracted as much to the
$50,000 reward for turning Morelli into the
police as to the prospect of getting revenge
on her high school crush for "stealing her
canola oil," Plum haphazardly throws herself
into the chase with the help of another
bounty hunter named Ranger.
Questions regarding Morelli's guilt for
shooting an unarmed man begin to surface
shortly thereafter, and Plum finds herself

working alongside her initial antagonist to
find witnesses of the shooting. But the two
cannot properly cooperate until they have
engaged in a series of sexually charged strug
gles, the most ridiculous of which involves
Morelli handcuffing Plum, clad in nothing
but a towel, to a shower rod.
With the help of Morelli and a sassy
hooker named Lula, Plum sets out to uncov
er the mystery surrounding the shooting,
plunging into a world of heroin-dealing
thugs and violent boxers. As witnesses of the
shooting begin disappearing, Morelli and
Plum must overcome their hostilities in
order to stay alive and solve the case. All
seems in order until the end of the day when
Plum must ask herself: is she in this for the
money or for the guy?
With a fairly formulaic plot, we would
expect the film to give us some witty one-lin
ers, or at the very least some clever banter
between Plum and Morelli to make up for the
lack of narrative originality. Unfortunately, the
screenwriters fail on all accounts and resort to
bland, overused humor and banal jokes. One
of the more cringe-worthy of these is Plum's
heavy-handed double entendre that she's
going to "nail Morelli" by bringing him into
the police.

Probably
the only thing
worse than the
dialogue is
Katherine

Heigl s attempt to
speak with a New Jersey accent, a task much
better suited to any member of the Jersey
Shore cast. Luckily for us, Heigl reserves her
verbal stylization for a select few words that
can really showcase a forced Jersey accent.
The few redeeming moments come
from Plum's loud-mouthed family in the
beginning of the movie and Lula (Sherri
Shepherd), characters who get far too little
screen time considering the star's terrible
acting.
Despite the popularity of Evanovich's
book, "One for the Money" is just another
Katherine Heigl movie in a whole slew of her
films. If you're looking for a clever adapta
tion or comedy, look elsewhere. This one's
not worth your money.
