# VIDEO GAMES
## The 						place of plot in video game history 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
For most of my life and long
before it began, video games
struggled to break into the
mainstream and gain status as a
respectable art. And with good
reason: rose-tinted glasses or not,
even the gaming pioneers of the
Ford-Carter years would surely
admit that their little hobby was
just that, a curious plaything more
remarkable for simply working
than for touching the heart or
soul. The Atari and Intellivision
era brought higher fidelity to the
medium as it stonewalled its way
into the American consciousness
with heavy marketing campaigns.
Development fervor exploded
before anyone knew it, and quality
control was a distant afterthought.
Games were everywhere, and so
were their dedicated, magazine
reading fans. But to the unin
formed masses picking up a sleek
looking cartridge off the shelf, the
chances of going home with
something fun or even non
embarrassing were about the
same as finding gold doubloons in
a barrel of dead fish. Games were
broken and shallow, and it wasn't
long before the novelty wore off
for most Americans. The affair
was over. That's probably why
there are still 20 truckloads of

unsold "E.T. the Extra Terrestrial"
cartridges for the Atari 2600
buried in Alamogordo, N.M.
R.I.P. Video Games, 1947-
1983.
In the oft-retold miracle of
the industry, of course, the arc of
history has kindly turned most of
the medium's main obstacles into
laughably false cliches. Games
today are no more inherently shal
low, vulgar or childish than any
other brand of storytelling. But
that very framework seeing
games as storytelling devices is
a vestigial descendant of that same
misunderstanding that, back in the
'7os and 'Bos, relegated games to
the artistically impotent sideline of
comics and anime in the first
place. Despite expectations to the
contrary, games aren't inherently
about stories, per se. They're inter
active experiences from which sto
ries can sometimes emerge,
whether they're totally scripted or
unique to every player.
When Nintendo reinvigorat
ed American gamers in 1983, it
made a smart decision. It put sto
ries aside and made them entirely
subservient to gameplay (it kills
me to say it, but I suppose there's a
potential comparison to adult
films there: focus on the good

stuff). As it turned out, making
games with gameplay in mind was
a winning formula, and the most
successful titles of the time basical
ly didn't have stories at all
"Mario," "Final Fantasy," "Zelda"
and so on. They didn't need to. By
having only the most basic of
premises, they also blazed the trail
for one of the signatures of the
medium letting players tell
their own story, in their mind,
based on simple actions. That
could've been the redemptive trait
that games "needed," at least for
the mainstream consumer who
would never have known it any
way. But much of the time, games
stepped into what many people
considered the sacred, story-driven
province of books, film and the
atre. That, of course, typically
resulted in them being lambasted
or ignored.
Today, the script has been
reversed. Like one might've
expected in 1985, people can sit
down and watch their son or
daughter play a game like
"Uncharted" or "Call of Duty"
(notice that I said watch ) and have
nearly the same experience as the
person holding the controller. For
better or worse, mainstream
games today tend to mimic

Hollywood more

than ever. It might be inevitable,
really. That's mostly because devel
opers can finally take that
approach without falling embar
rassingly short of the mark, at least
in terms of visuals if it looks
good at a glance and has a story
pitch that can dance with com
mercials for ABC's fall lineup, then
armchair quarterbacks and soccer
moms across the country will have
a much better chance of picking it
up.

It's not a tragedy by any
stretch, and I'll always accept the
way the market rolls the dice. But
even so, we find ourselves in an era
when the common perception of
what a video game is, exactly, is
once again radically divided
between the people who play them
and those who don't. Being who I
am, though, I feel increasingly
removed from the days of my
youth, in the quiet years between
the crash of 'B3 and the dawn of
movie-quality rendering on home
consoles. Back then, games that
reigned supreme had stark but
inspiring presentation and
engaged my imagination like a
masterful novel.

Even if they're not on top
anymore, those games are still out
there. So let me close this tale with
a shout-out to the little guys
the indie developers, the college
guys making iOS games, the pub
lishers still willing to bring this
stuff to Steam and XBLA and
even the folks making motion
control into something meaning
ful. Keep your heads high and do
your thing. People still notice,
even if the sales charts don't
always show it.

medium as it stonewalled its way
into the American consciousness
with heavy marketing campaigns.
Development fervor exploded
before anyone knew it, and quality
control was a distant afterthought.
Games were everywhere, and so
were their dedicated, magazine
reading fans. But to the unin
formed masses picking up a sleek
looking cartridge off the shelf, the
chances of going home with
something fun or even non
embarrassing were about the
same as finding gold doubloons in
a barrel of dead fish. Games were
broken and shallow, and it wasn't
long before the novelty wore off
for most Americans. The affair
was over. That's probably why
there are still 20 truckloads of

unsold "E.T. the Extra Terrestrial"
cartridges for the Atari 2600
buried in Alamogordo, N.M.
R.I.P. Video Games, 1947-
1983.
In the oft-retold miracle of
the industry, of course, the arc of
history has kindly turned most of
the medium's main obstacles into
laughably false cliches. Games
today are no more inherently shal
low, vulgar or childish than any
other brand of storytelling. But
that very framework seeing
games as storytelling devices is
a vestigial descendant of that same
misunderstanding that, back in the
'7os and 'Bos, relegated games to
the artistically impotent sideline of
comics and anime in the first
place. Despite expectations to the
contrary, games aren't inherently
about stories, per se. They're inter
active experiences from which sto
ries can sometimes emerge,
whether they're totally scripted or
unique to every player.
When Nintendo reinvigorat
ed American gamers in 1983, it
made a smart decision. It put sto
ries aside and made them entirely
subservient to gameplay (it kills
me to say it, but I suppose there's a
potential comparison to adult
films there: focus on the good

stuff). As it turned out, making
games with gameplay in mind was
a winning formula, and the most
successful titles of the time basical
ly didn't have stories at all
"Mario," "Final Fantasy," "Zelda"
and so on. They didn't need to. By
having only the most basic of
premises, they also blazed the trail
for one of the signatures of the
medium letting players tell
their own story, in their mind,
based on simple actions. That
could've been the redemptive trait
that games "needed," at least for
the mainstream consumer who
would never have known it any
way. But much of the time, games
stepped into what many people
considered the sacred, story-driven
province of books, film and the
atre. That, of course, typically
resulted in them being lambasted
or ignored.
Today, the script has been
reversed. Like one might've
expected in 1985, people can sit
down and watch their son or
daughter play a game like
"Uncharted" or "Call of Duty"
(notice that I said watch ) and have
nearly the same experience as the
person holding the controller. For
better or worse, mainstream
games today tend to mimic

Hollywood more

than ever. It might be inevitable,
really. That's mostly because devel
opers can finally take that
approach without falling embar
rassingly short of the mark, at least
in terms of visuals if it looks
good at a glance and has a story
pitch that can dance with com
mercials for ABC's fall lineup, then
armchair quarterbacks and soccer
moms across the country will have
a much better chance of picking it
up.

It's not a tragedy by any
stretch, and I'll always accept the
way the market rolls the dice. But
even so, we find ourselves in an era
when the common perception of
what a video game is, exactly, is
once again radically divided
between the people who play them
and those who don't. Being who I
am, though, I feel increasingly
removed from the days of my
youth, in the quiet years between
the crash of 'B3 and the dawn of
movie-quality rendering on home
consoles. Back then, games that
reigned supreme had stark but
inspiring presentation and
engaged my imagination like a
masterful novel.

Even if they're not on top
anymore, those games are still out
there. So let me close this tale with
a shout-out to the little guys
the indie developers, the college
guys making iOS games, the pub
lishers still willing to bring this
stuff to Steam and XBLA and
even the folks making motion
control into something meaning
ful. Keep your heads high and do
your thing. People still notice,
even if the sales charts don't
always show it.


For most of my life and long
before it began, video games
struggled to break into the
mainstream and gain status as a
respectable art. And with good
reason: rose-tinted glasses or not,
even the gaming pioneers of the
Ford-Carter years would surely
admit that their little hobby was
just that, a curious plaything more
remarkable for simply working
than for touching the heart or
soul. The Atari and Intellivision
era brought higher fidelity to the
medium as it stonewalled its way
into the American consciousness
with heavy marketing campaigns.
