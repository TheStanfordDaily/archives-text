# DANCE
## Chocolate Heads traverse the cosmos 
### â€“ holly FETTER contact holly: hfetter@stanford. edu 
When I first meet the Chocolate
Heads crew they're backstage,
buzzing with laughter as they do
their pre-show warm-ups. They carry that
energy onto the stage as they flutter out the
door and into the spacious Roble Dance
Studio.
The driving beat of a tUnE-yArDs song
fills the room as dancers prance across the
floor. People are doing sprints, stretches and
spontaneous dance moves as the tech folks
adjust the lights and prepare the sound
board. I'm scribbling a description in my
notebook: "hipster frat party meets colorful
kindergarten classroom."
We unite in a circle, holding hands, and
as we sway back and forth, take turns declar
ing our role in the production. The choreog
rapher and director, Aleta Hayes '9l, starts
speaking in an exaggerated British accent.
I'm holding the hand of a homeschooled
eight-year-old who loves linguistics, litera
ture and astrophysics.
This is an unconventional rehearsal for
an even less conventional performance. The
Chocolate Heads Movement Band is an
interdisciplinary group to say the least
Hayes prides herself in incorporating multi
ple art forms into her super-funky dance
troupe. Their latest show, "Red Shift," epito
mizes the Heads' unique approach to per
forming.
The show is about dark energy and dark
matter. It "exploits the principle that gravita
tion brings matter together and dark energy

forces matter apart." I see you, humanities
majors don't worry, you're invited too. As
their press release states, the group incorpo
rates "themes of repulsion, attraction, dis
tance, proximity, isolation, community,
enmity and anomie into the piece." It's a per
fect blend of science and art, successfully
transcending the techie/fuzzie divide.
What sounds like an extremely ambi
tious project is actually a provocative per
formance that's unexpectedly concise it
wraps up in under an hour. Part astrophysics
lecture, part dance show and part poetry
slam, this piece is quintessentially Stanford.
Dance can be hard for some of us to access,
but this particular performance draws us in
with its use of poetry and prose that comple

ments the dancers' movements.
It demands our attention, too, as it chal
lenges our perceptions of performance. This
dynamic show brings us into the process,
asking us to constantly change our perspec
tive on the piece as the dancers move on and
off stage from all angles, the musician creates
his tunes alongside the performers and a
multicolored mobile spins just outside the
traditional borders of the stage.
Music is an integral element of this
piece. Freelance musician Ben Juodvalkis
provides a live electronic score that is an
exact reflection of the dancers' versatility. He
and the performers effortlessly glide between
bass-thumping hip-hop beats and ethereal
synthetic strings.
The dancers are incredibly skilled, but
they never look stiff or restrained their
movements are both fluid and precise, and
they truly seem to be enjoying the perform
ance. Their movements are simultaneously
scientific and sensuous, as they explore the
mystery of physics. They turn the vastness of
the universe into something intimate, creat
ing constellations and clusters that display
the interconnectedness of our galaxy and the
real beings within it.
This sense of collaborative empower
ment extends beyond the stage. Janani
Balasubramanian 'l2, one of the members of
the Chocolate Heads, tells me that she digs the
"more than democratic" motto of the group.
"Everyone's a Chocolate Head,"
Balasubramanian said.

It's that camaraderie and equality that
attract performers and viewers alike. The
audience can sense that these dancers are
part of a unified collective with a shared
artistic vision, and we, too, become a part of
the show.

The Chocolate Heads will be performing "Red
Shift"Feb. 3 and 4at Bp.m. in Roble Gym,
Studio 38. The show is free and open to the
public.
