# Media lab to open in fall
## $3O million tech-journalism institute expected 2012-13 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
The David and Helen Gurley
Brown Institute for Media Innovation
the result of a $3O million gift to the
Stanford School of Engineering and
the Columbia School of Journalism
(J-School) from former Cosmopoli
tan editor Helen Gurley Brown
will be up and running on both cam
puses by the start of the 2012-13 aca
demic year.
Stanford and Columbia will each
receive $6 million to sustain a director
on each campus and a fellow on each
location to support the director. Each

school will have an additional $6 mil
lion endowment to support "magic
grants" collaborative student proj
ects related to technology and digital
journalism.
"[The Institute] reflects a great
promise, which is still unfulfilled
namely that people who work on con
tent and people who work on technol
ogy will invent the next generation of
media together," said Electrical Engi
neering Professor Bernd Girod, who
will serve as the Stanford director of
the program. "It's been long recog
nized that this is how it should be
done, but it hasn't really happened
yet."

The endowment will annually pay
out roughly five percent or
$300,000 each year for grants on
each campus, according to Girod.
Columbia received an extra $6 mil
lion to support the development of a
high-tech newsroom.
Each campus will choose its
Brown Fellow by July and will begin a
competition for magic grants in
March, so that the selected students
can prepare to develop their projects
at the start of the next school year,
Girod said.
