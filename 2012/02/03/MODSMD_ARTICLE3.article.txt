# Media lab to open in fall
## $3O million tech-journalism institute expected 2012-13 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
The David and Helen Gurley
Brown Institute for Media Innovation
the result of a $3O million gift to the
Stanford School of Engineering and
the Columbia School of Journalism
(J-School) from former Cosmopoli
tan editor Helen Gurley Brown
will be up and running on both cam
puses by the start of the 2012-13 aca
demic year.
Stanford and Columbia will each
receive $6 million to sustain a director
on each campus and a fellow on each
location to support the director. Each

school will have an additional $6 mil
lion endowment to support "magic
grants" collaborative student proj
ects related to technology and digital
journalism.
"[The Institute] reflects a great
promise, which is still unfulfilled
namely that people who work on con
tent and people who work on technol
ogy will invent the next generation of
media together," said Electrical Engi
neering Professor Bernd Girod, who
will serve as the Stanford director of
the program. "It's been long recog
nized that this is how it should be
done, but it hasn't really happened
yet."

The endowment will annually pay
out roughly five percent or
$300,000 each year for grants on
each campus, according to Girod.
Columbia received an extra $6 mil
lion to support the development of a
high-tech newsroom.
Each campus will choose its
Brown Fellow by July and will begin a
competition for magic grants in
March, so that the selected students
can prepare to develop their projects
at the start of the next school year,
Girod said.

"We want to tap into the creativity
and new and original ideas that
our graduate and post-graduate
students have," Girod said. "If a
pair of students has a game-chang
ing and original idea, we will fund
them for a year."
Preparing for the institute
Columbia is currently conduct
ing a search for the Institute's east
coast director but is more con
cerned with finding the most qual
ified person than "meeting an arti
ficial deadline," according to
William Grueskin '77, dean of aca
demic affairs at the Columbia
School of Journalism.
After soliciting applications
and interviewing top candidates, a
committee of Journalism School
faculty will recommend a candi-

date to the J-School's dean,
Nicholas Lemann.
"We expect to make the hire
later this year," Grueskin said,
adding that Girod will be involved
in the search process.
"We're looking for someone
who can compliment an engineer,"
Girod said. "That person will like
ly be technology-sawy, but will
focus on content."
Columbia does not yet have an
exact timeline for construction of
its technology newsroom but an
ticipates its completion in 2014.
"We expect the new newsroom
will be a center for real innovation
in multimedia, using tools in visual,
aural and data-driven journalism,"
Grueskin said. "The architectural
plans aren't complete, but we ex
pect the space will include class
rooms, offices and open areas for
collaboration."
In terms of Stanford space for
the Institute, Girod said Stanford
is currently in the process of iden

tifying suitable space.
"We will likely convert some
space in the School of Engineer
ing," Girod said.
Girod envisions the Institute
having a similar style to that of the
Institute of Design at Stanford
(d.school), which has open spaces
that "inspire people to work to
gether."
Connecting East and West
Though the programs will be
anchored in the School of Engi
neering at Stanford and in the
School of Journalism in New York,
Girod says the magic grants will be
open to the entire community on
each campus.
Girod stressed that a multidis
ciplinary approach is necessary to
solving the problems facing 21st
century journalism.
"It's not something that's just
going to happen for engineering
students," Girod said. "The more
surprising the ideas are, the better.
Often the best out of the box
thinking comes when people with
different backgrounds come to
gether."
Participants on both campuses
will see each other at regular inter
vals, according to Girod.

"There will be a mechanism in
place to connect people east and
west fellows and grant recipi
ents," Girod said.
"Bridging the gap"
Columbia and Stanford an
nounced Brown's donation and
the creation of the Institute on
Monday in a joint press release,
along with Cosmopolitan's parent
company, Hearst Corporation.
"[The Institute] will recognize
the increasingly important con
nection between journalism and
technology, bringing the best from
the East and West Coasts," the re
lease said.
The gift had been in prepara
tion for roughly two years, accord
ing to Girod, who has been in
volved since September.
Brown gave the gift in honor of
her late husband David, who com
pleted a B.A. in communication at
Stanford, before attending the Co
lumbia School of Journalism to re
ceive an M.S. in Journalism in
1937.
That the Institute is among the
first of its kind is mostly due to the
shortcomings of technology, ac
cording to Girod.
"Technology is just not sophis

ticated enough to extract meaning
from text, or recognize the story of
a movie," Girod said. "But we are
at the cusp of bridging what people
call 'the semantic gap,' of unify
ing the worlds of content and tech
nology," Girod said.
The J-School has been working
with its Columbia engineering col
leagues since it started work on a
joint degree master's program in
computer science and journalism,
Grueskin said.
Columbia enrolled its first class
of students in the program last fall
and will be hosting a hackathon this
coming weekend with ScraperWi
ki, an online tool that helps users
gather data from the Internet.
"We've seen a number of jour
nalism initiatives at Columbia, and
beyond, designed to bolster the
role that universities have often
played in solving problems in soci
ety, business and other fields,"
Grueskin said. "We want to be sure
that the Brown Institute is relevant
to the challenges journalists face
and that we produce genuinely
useful research, tools and training
in the years to come,"

and will be hosting a hackathon this
coming weekend with ScraperWi
ki, an online tool that helps users
gather data from the Internet.
"We've seen a number of jour
nalism initiatives at Columbia, and
beyond, designed to bolster the
role that universities have often
played in solving problems in soci
ety, business and other fields,"
Grueskin said. "We want to be sure
that the Brown Institute is relevant
to the challenges journalists face
and that we produce genuinely
useful research, tools and training
in the years to come,"

The David and Helen Gurley
Brown Institute for Media Innovation
the result of a $3O million gift to the
Stanford School of Engineering and
the Columbia School of Journalism
(J-School) from former Cosmopoli
tan editor Helen Gurley Brown
will be up and running on both cam
puses by the start of the 2012-13 aca
demic year.
Stanford and Columbia will each
receive $6 million to sustain a director
on each campus and a fellow on each
location to support the director. Each

school will have an additional $6 mil
lion endowment to support "magic
grants" collaborative student proj
ects related to technology and digital
journalism.
"[The Institute] reflects a great
promise, which is still unfulfilled
namely that people who work on con
tent and people who work on technol
ogy will invent the next generation of
media together," said Electrical Engi
neering Professor Bernd Girod, who
will serve as the Stanford director of
the program. "It's been long recog
nized that this is how it should be
done, but it hasn't really happened
yet."

The endowment will annually pay
out roughly five percent or
$300,000 each year for grants on
each campus, according to Girod.
Columbia received an extra $6 mil
lion to support the development of a
high-tech newsroom.
Each campus will choose its
Brown Fellow by July and will begin a
competition for magic grants in
March, so that the selected students
can prepare to develop their projects
at the start of the next school year,
Girod said.

"We want to tap into the creativity
and new and original ideas that
our graduate and post-graduate
students have," Girod said. "If a
pair of students has a game-chang
ing and original idea, we will fund
them for a year."
Preparing for the institute
Columbia is currently conduct
ing a search for the Institute's east
coast director but is more con
cerned with finding the most qual
ified person than "meeting an arti
ficial deadline," according to
William Grueskin '77, dean of aca
demic affairs at the Columbia
School of Journalism.
After soliciting applications
and interviewing top candidates, a
committee of Journalism School
faculty will recommend a candi-

date to the J-School's dean,
Nicholas Lemann.
"We expect to make the hire
later this year," Grueskin said,
adding that Girod will be involved
in the search process.
"We're looking for someone
who can compliment an engineer,"
Girod said. "That person will like
ly be technology-sawy, but will
focus on content."
Columbia does not yet have an
exact timeline for construction of
its technology newsroom but an
ticipates its completion in 2014.
"We expect the new newsroom
will be a center for real innovation
in multimedia, using tools in visual,
aural and data-driven journalism,"
Grueskin said. "The architectural
plans aren't complete, but we ex
pect the space will include class
rooms, offices and open areas for
collaboration."
In terms of Stanford space for
the Institute, Girod said Stanford
is currently in the process of iden

tifying suitable space.
"We will likely convert some
space in the School of Engineer
ing," Girod said.
Girod envisions the Institute
having a similar style to that of the
Institute of Design at Stanford
(d.school), which has open spaces
that "inspire people to work to
gether."
Connecting East and West
Though the programs will be
anchored in the School of Engi
neering at Stanford and in the
School of Journalism in New York,
Girod says the magic grants will be
open to the entire community on
each campus.
Girod stressed that a multidis
ciplinary approach is necessary to
solving the problems facing 21st
century journalism.
"It's not something that's just
going to happen for engineering
students," Girod said. "The more
surprising the ideas are, the better.
Often the best out of the box
thinking comes when people with
different backgrounds come to
gether."
Participants on both campuses
will see each other at regular inter
vals, according to Girod.

"There will be a mechanism in
place to connect people east and
west fellows and grant recipi
ents," Girod said.
"Bridging the gap"
Columbia and Stanford an
nounced Brown's donation and
the creation of the Institute on
Monday in a joint press release,
along with Cosmopolitan's parent
company, Hearst Corporation.
"[The Institute] will recognize
the increasingly important con
nection between journalism and
technology, bringing the best from
the East and West Coasts," the re
lease said.
The gift had been in prepara
tion for roughly two years, accord
ing to Girod, who has been in
volved since September.
Brown gave the gift in honor of
her late husband David, who com
pleted a B.A. in communication at
Stanford, before attending the Co
lumbia School of Journalism to re
ceive an M.S. in Journalism in
1937.
That the Institute is among the
first of its kind is mostly due to the
shortcomings of technology, ac
cording to Girod.
"Technology is just not sophis

ticated enough to extract meaning
from text, or recognize the story of
a movie," Girod said. "But we are
at the cusp of bridging what people
call 'the semantic gap,' of unify
ing the worlds of content and tech
nology," Girod said.
The J-School has been working
with its Columbia engineering col
leagues since it started work on a
joint degree master's program in
computer science and journalism,
Grueskin said.
Columbia enrolled its first class
of students in the program last fall
and will be hosting a hackathon this
coming weekend with ScraperWi
ki, an online tool that helps users
