## SEXY CAN I? ROXY SASS 
### 
Roxy's heard it said that relation
ships are like a five-unit class,
and over the years she's had to
pull plenty of all-nighters. Fortunately
for those of you with a full course
load, Roxy's prepared a quick and dirty
guide to the kinds of relationships
you'll find at Stanford.
Friends without benefits
A relationship category with all the
makings of a terrible rom-com, seem
ingly platonic friendships abound at
Stanford. Roxy's seen it many times
before: two friends who essentially act
like they're dating without any of the
perks. Call her a cynic, but Roxy
believes that —much like the cheesy
pickup lines she heard last pub
night—these relationships just don't
work. In her experience, at least one of
the two wants the friendship to be a
little ... friendlier. If you've found
yourself as a friend without benefits,
Roxy suggests you think long and hard
about the relationship if you
haven't thought about anything else
getting long and hard, it's probably the
other 50 percent of the friendship
who'd like to see you with 50 percent
less clothes on. And if you're trying to
move out of the friend zone and into
the erogenous zones, Roxy suggests
you make your move already.
Casual hookups
Roxy has heard many people bemoan
the prevalence of the random hookup
at Stanford, but to be honest, she does
n't understand why they would oppose
anything that makes them moan. As a
busy Stanford student, Roxy hardly has
time for meals let alone feelings. With
so many constraints on our time, ran
dom hookups are a matter of effrcien

cy we have a population of 3,500
male and 3,300 female undergrads (in
the spirit of science, Roxy did her
research) and only four years where
guilt-free, fiat-party hookups are
socially acceptable. That's what they
mean by getting the most out of col
lege, right?
Not-so-casual hookups
Ultimately, hookups are more about
quality than quantity, and Roxy recog
nizes that a one-time encounter may
grow into something more. While she
believes that feelings, like STIs and
pregnancy, are an unpleasant outcome
to be avoided at all costs, many others
on this campus don't have Roxy's hard
resolve. Often, these people claim to be
completely devoid of feelings when all
observers with a pulse could tell you
otherwise. Reality check: If you're tex
ting that often and the messages don't
include pics (or setting a time to see
the real thing), Roxy suggests you stop
lying to yourself and accept that it's no
longer just about getting laid.
Old, married couples
While Roxy has taken to the rare silver
fox, she finds few other "old" things
sexy, and couples that begin to act like
they've been married for 50-plus years
are no exception. Perhaps Roxy's least
favorite type of relationship on cam
pus, the old, married couple started
dating and immediately stopped hav
ing fun of any kind. If you find your
self leaving your room only for food,
class and the occasional shower and/or
spend most of your time in bed
together but haven't done anything
but cuddle for more than a week, it's
time for an intervention. Your friends
may not have said anything to you, but
Roxy is the best friend of all: If you're
not getting action, it's time to get out.
Or at least, you know, leave the dorm
room once in a while.
