## NYC bid informs future, admins say 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This is the second in a series of articles
by The Daily News Staff exploring
Stanford's bid and subsequent with
drawal from the competition for an ap
plied sciences and engineering campus
in New York City.
After Stanford withdrew from the
competition for a tech campus in New
York, administrators and faculty have
maintained that the $3 million Stan
ford spent on the proposal was not

wasted, and that Stanford gained
much valuable experience from the
venture.
Until mid-December last year,
Stanford administrators were eager to
list the benefits that would come from
building a campus in New York not
only would it bring Stanford's name
and entrepreneurial culture to the
East Coast, but it would also allow
Stanford to expand the undergradu
ate population by an estimated 400
students and give Stanford students
the chance to study and work in New

York. But now that Stanford has with
drawn from the competition, what, if
anything, has Stanford gained from
over a year's worth of hard work and
$3 million spent on the proposal?
The process of considering what a
remote campus would look like was a
crucial exercise for Stanford, accord
ing to Jim Plummer, dean of the
School of Engineering.
"The fundamental question that
drove all of this is, what is a research
university in the 21 st century going
to look like?" Plummer said. "Can
we be geographically distributed?
Should we be? To what degree is
distance education going to be a
solution? So I actually think that
while we're sorry we didn't win,
the impact on Stanford will still be
pretty profound because of the
thought process that we went
through and the ideas that were
generated."
Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. 'B2 also noted that while
Stanford has been "constantly ap
proached by institutions, individu
als and countries asking ... for us
to start up a campus," this is the
first time that Stanford has seri
ously considered working out all
the logistics of designing a remote
campus.
"We became very clear in our
own minds under what circum
stances it would make sense to do
a remote campus, and that was
something that we needed to
think through," Etchemendy said.
In this case, Stanford decided
that the risks involved in building
a New York campus would be too
great to take on.
While some students objected
to the lack of campus-wide consul
tation in the initial stages of the
competition process, all the stu
dents interviewed by The Daily
agreed that the experience was
valuable.
"I think it was definitely worth

looking into," said material sci
ence and engineering graduate
student Scott Himmelberger
Ph.D. 'l5. "I think a lot of universi
ties are starting to do that and are
going to do so more in the future."
Himmelberger wrote a letter
to the editor in October express
ing his support for the project.
"I guess you could just see this
as a new venture that Stanford
was experimenting with and they
were testing the waters," says
Alyson Yamada 'l2, president of
Stanford Women in Engineering.
"Stanford teaches its students to
be entrepreneurial like that...
practice what you preach, right?"
Stanford has also enhanced its
reputation and raised its profile
on the East Coast by participating
in the competition, said Universi
ty spokesperson Lisa Lapin.
"From my standpoint, as a pub
lic relations official who cares a lot
about Stanford's reputation, we
had positive press and attention
from February to December,"
Lapin noted. "There was nobody
in NYC who didn't know about it,
and there was very broad, wide
spread acceptance of Stanford on
the East Coast. A marketing cam
paign ... would have cost us 20
times the proposal."
Stanford's reputation may have
been bruised by the withdrawal
and subsequent press speculation
that Stanford was unprepared for
the tough negotiation style of New
York, but Sharath Chandra, a New
York entrepreneur and founder of
startup company My Memory
Lane, said he believes that any
negative effects will not be long
lasting.

"Residents here are asking
what really happened, and it's easy
to blame the one that's farther
away, [but] I don't think it'll
change what Stanford stands for,
beyond the short term," Chandra
said.
Within individual departments
on campus that would have been
involved with the tech campus,
there are varying assessments of
how much was gained from the
bid.
The School of Engineering had
put together a proposal for a class
on sustainable urban environ
ments, which would use New York
as its testing ground. While the
course cannot take place in Palo
Alto in the same way, the School of
Engineering is hoping to adapt the
idea so that a similar course can be
held focusing on nearby cities.
"The ideas can well live on
without the physical presence of
the city," Plummer said.
Computer Science Depart
ment representatives said, on the
other hand, that they did not feel
their department had benefited in
any concrete way.
"I think the whole process was
not a bad exercise, and we had a lot
of fun talking about it," said De
partment Chair Jennifer Widom,
though she added that most of the
department talks had to do with
logistics and faculty hiring and
would not be applicable to the fu
ture of the department's work on
campus.

involved with the tech campus,
there are varying assessments of
how much was gained from the
bid.
The School of Engineering had
put together a proposal for a class
on sustainable urban environ
ments, which would use New York
as its testing ground. While the
course cannot take place in Palo
Alto in the same way, the School of
Engineering is hoping to adapt the
idea so that a similar course can be
held focusing on nearby cities.
"The ideas can well live on
without the physical presence of
the city," Plummer said.
Computer Science Depart
ment representatives said, on the
other hand, that they did not feel
their department had benefited in
any concrete way.
"I think the whole process was
not a bad exercise, and we had a lot
of fun talking about it," said De
partment Chair Jennifer Widom,
though she added that most of the
department talks had to do with
logistics and faculty hiring and
would not be applicable to the fu
ture of the department's work on
campus.

This is the second in a series of articles
by The Daily News Staff exploring
Stanford's bid and subsequent with
drawal from the competition for an ap
plied sciences and engineering campus
in New York City.
After Stanford withdrew from the
competition for a tech campus in New
York, administrators and faculty have
maintained that the $3 million Stan
ford spent on the proposal was not

wasted, and that Stanford gained
much valuable experience from the
venture.
Until mid-December last year,
Stanford administrators were eager to
list the benefits that would come from
building a campus in New York not
only would it bring Stanford's name
and entrepreneurial culture to the
East Coast, but it would also allow
Stanford to expand the undergradu
ate population by an estimated 400
students and give Stanford students
the chance to study and work in New

York. But now that Stanford has with
drawn from the competition, what, if
anything, has Stanford gained from
over a year's worth of hard work and
$3 million spent on the proposal?
The process of considering what a
remote campus would look like was a
crucial exercise for Stanford, accord
ing to Jim Plummer, dean of the
School of Engineering.
"The fundamental question that
drove all of this is, what is a research
university in the 21 st century going
to look like?" Plummer said. "Can
we be geographically distributed?
Should we be? To what degree is
distance education going to be a
solution? So I actually think that
while we're sorry we didn't win,
the impact on Stanford will still be
pretty profound because of the
thought process that we went
through and the ideas that were
generated."
Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. 'B2 also noted that while
Stanford has been "constantly ap
proached by institutions, individu
als and countries asking ... for us
to start up a campus," this is the
first time that Stanford has seri
ously considered working out all
the logistics of designing a remote
campus.
"We became very clear in our
own minds under what circum
stances it would make sense to do
a remote campus, and that was
something that we needed to
think through," Etchemendy said.
In this case, Stanford decided
that the risks involved in building
a New York campus would be too
great to take on.
While some students objected
to the lack of campus-wide consul
tation in the initial stages of the
competition process, all the stu
dents interviewed by The Daily
agreed that the experience was
valuable.
"I think it was definitely worth

looking into," said material sci
ence and engineering graduate
student Scott Himmelberger
Ph.D. 'l5. "I think a lot of universi
ties are starting to do that and are
going to do so more in the future."
Himmelberger wrote a letter
to the editor in October express
ing his support for the project.
"I guess you could just see this
as a new venture that Stanford
was experimenting with and they
were testing the waters," says
Alyson Yamada 'l2, president of
Stanford Women in Engineering.
"Stanford teaches its students to
be entrepreneurial like that...
practice what you preach, right?"
Stanford has also enhanced its
reputation and raised its profile
on the East Coast by participating
in the competition, said Universi
ty spokesperson Lisa Lapin.
"From my standpoint, as a pub
lic relations official who cares a lot
about Stanford's reputation, we
had positive press and attention
from February to December,"
Lapin noted. "There was nobody
in NYC who didn't know about it,
and there was very broad, wide
spread acceptance of Stanford on
the East Coast. A marketing cam
paign ... would have cost us 20
times the proposal."
Stanford's reputation may have
been bruised by the withdrawal
and subsequent press speculation
that Stanford was unprepared for
the tough negotiation style of New
York, but Sharath Chandra, a New
York entrepreneur and founder of
startup company My Memory
Lane, said he believes that any
negative effects will not be long
lasting.

"Residents here are asking
what really happened, and it's easy
to blame the one that's farther
away, [but] I don't think it'll
change what Stanford stands for,
beyond the short term," Chandra
said.
