## The 						Stanford Clock is ticking... slower 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Observant students may have noticed
that the Stanford Clock Tower has been
about six minutes behind schedule this
quarter.
The truth is, the clock was actually a full
12 hours off, as well.
Gibson Anderson '67, a Bonair Siding
employee who volunteers to fix the clock
when necessary, noticed that the chimes
set to sound each morning on the quarter
hour had not been going off Anderson
came to campus Thursday afternoon to
check on the clock and realized that it was
running off by a half day.
Anderson began to fix the clock
around 5 p.m., accounting for the numer
ous cycles of the Westminster chimes and
the fast-moving hands observers heard
and saw on the clock yesterday afternoon.
Anderson will return today, having been
unable to continue working after sunset.
"The clock hasn't been maintained in a

while because the Ph.D. student doing that
finished his degree and went to Europe,"
Anderson chuckled.
"But what he would do is come in
every now and then to check on the clock
and either add or take away weights to
fine-tune the pendulum," Anderson said,
motioning toward some small metal chips
on top of the clock's pendulum.
In accordance with Jane Stanford's re
quest, the Seth Thomas Clock Company,
at the time one of two leading tower clock
makers built the clock in 1901, Anderson
said.
The clock was originally housed in Me
morial Church; however, when a 1906
earthquake hit campus, the clock was not
replaced. Instead, it was held temporarily
near the church.
Then, in 1983, William Kimball, an
alumnus of Stanford University, donated
enough money to build a clock tower at
the corner of Escondido and Lasuen
Malls, right next to the "Circle of Death,"
where it remains today. The face of the

original clock is on the inside of the clock
tower.
"At some point, the Mechanical Engi
neering Department took over," Ander
son said. "There was some minor damage
on the clock, but the engineering depart
ment did some really great renovation to
it. You can't even notice it," Anderson con
tinued, pointing down at the pendulum,
"but the pendulum was changed as well."
One of the major problems with such
large timepieces is the fluctuation in the
swing of the pendulum due to changes in
the temperature, Anderson said. Heat
would cause the metal in the pendulum to
expand.
So in 1997, the pendulum was replaced
with a new one that uses two kinds of
metal. The metals expand in different di
rections at different rates, thereby leaving
the length of the pendulum unchanged
and temperature-compensated.
The clock still has to be wound up

clock was 12 hours off on Thursday afternoon. Anderson will finish recalibrating the Clock Tower this afternoon.
every four days, however. Three
cranks are on one side of the gears,
with one operating the time, one
operating the hour intervals and
the last operating the quarter inter
vals. On the other side are pro
pellers, with blades set to a very spe
cific slope in order to get just the
right amount of air resistance to
keep time.
A yellowed logbook lies at the
ladder of the clock tower, where
names, dates and the accuracy of
the clock have been recorded. Until
about Jan. 7, of this year, the clock
had only been 10 to 15 seconds off
the actual time. The clock is recali
brated according to an atomic
clock, which lies in the corner of the
bottom of the clock tower.
The clock was cleaned about
two years ago completely taken

apart and put back together again
and every so often someone
goes up the tower to clean the bells.
Today, the clock tower remains
the most complete mechanical
clock displayed in the Bay Area,
telling time, ringing on the hour and
chiming at every quarter. All the
gears that run it are still the origi
nals, except for one gear that was
recast by the Engineering Depart
ment.
"A clock is nothing but a big
gear. It's all mechanical," Anderson
concluded. "The first mechanical
clock was built in 1000 A.D., but
there haven't been any revolution
ary changes in the creation of
clocks. There have only been incre
mental changes in the making of
clocks. The clock's lost about a
minute each week that's actual
ly pretty good. For a big machine,
this is as accurate as it's going to
get."
