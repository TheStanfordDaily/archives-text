## The
						Stanford Clock is ticking... slower 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Observant students may have noticed
that the Stanford Clock Tower has been
about six minutes behind schedule this
quarter.
The truth is, the clock was actually a full
12 hours off, as well.
Gibson Anderson '67, a Bonair Siding
employee who volunteers to fix the clock
when necessary, noticed that the chimes
set to sound each morning on the quarter
hour had not been going off Anderson
came to campus Thursday afternoon to
check on the clock and realized that it was
running off by a half day.
Anderson began to fix the clock
around 5 p.m., accounting for the numer
ous cycles of the Westminster chimes and
the fast-moving hands observers heard
and saw on the clock yesterday afternoon.
Anderson will return today, having been
unable to continue working after sunset.
"The clock hasn't been maintained in a

while because the Ph.D. student doing that
finished his degree and went to Europe,"
Anderson chuckled.
"But what he would do is come in
every now and then to check on the clock
and either add or take away weights to
fine-tune the pendulum," Anderson said,
motioning toward some small metal chips
on top of the clock's pendulum.
In accordance with Jane Stanford's re
quest, the Seth Thomas Clock Company,
at the time one of two leading tower clock
makers built the clock in 1901, Anderson
said.
The clock was originally housed in Me
morial Church; however, when a 1906
earthquake hit campus, the clock was not
replaced. Instead, it was held temporarily
near the church.
Then, in 1983, William Kimball, an
alumnus of Stanford University, donated
enough money to build a clock tower at
the corner of Escondido and Lasuen
Malls, right next to the "Circle of Death,"
where it remains today. The face of the

original clock is on the inside of the clock
tower.
"At some point, the Mechanical Engi
neering Department took over," Ander
son said. "There was some minor damage
on the clock, but the engineering depart
ment did some really great renovation to
it. You can't even notice it," Anderson con
tinued, pointing down at the pendulum,
"but the pendulum was changed as well."
One of the major problems with such
large timepieces is the fluctuation in the
swing of the pendulum due to changes in
the temperature, Anderson said. Heat
would cause the metal in the pendulum to
expand.
So in 1997, the pendulum was replaced
with a new one that uses two kinds of
metal. The metals expand in different di
rections at different rates, thereby leaving
the length of the pendulum unchanged
and temperature-compensated.
The clock still has to be wound up
