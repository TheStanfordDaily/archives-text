### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER DESK EDITOR 
"We're in the middle of a crisis . . . that has
been going largely unnoticed a worldwide cri
sis in education," said philosopher Martha Nuss
baum Thursday evening to a near-capacity audi
ence at Cubberley Auditorium. "There are radical
changes in what democratic societies teach young
people, and these changes have not been well
thought through."
"If this trend continues, we will be producing
generations of narrow technically-trained work
ers rather than complete citizens who can think
for themselves, criticize tradition and authority
and understand the significance of another per
son's suffering and achievements," Nussbaum
added.
Nussbaum, who is a professor of law and ethics
at the University of Chicago, spoke about the im
plications of the narrow, technical education stu

Needs the Humanities."
Nussbaum emphasized that democracies need
citizens with well-rounded educations. She said
that courses in the humanities teach citizens the
needed, "ability to deliberate well the ability
to think about the good of nation as a whole, not
just one's group."
Debra Satz, director of the Center for Ethics in
Society and senior associate dean for humanities
and arts at Stanford, introduced Nussbaum, em
phasizing how Stanford is also concerned about
the state of the humanities.
Satz noted that enrollment in humanities
courses has "fallen on hard times."
"It makes sense to re-gauge our priorities," she
added.
Satz also noted that in England and India, the
humanities are seen by students and administra
tors as a luxury. She noted that there are pressures
to make classes larger and teaching more cost-ef
fective.
Nussbaum emphasized how the thinking about
economic development must change to accom
modate a broader education view.
"What does it mean for a nation to advance, to
improve its quality of life?" Nussbaum asked.
While noting that some developmental models
emphasize GDP, she warned that such an empha
sis, "doesn't take into account social equality,
equality of race, gender relations and other as
pects such as health and education."
Nussbaum agreed with Indian educator Ra-
