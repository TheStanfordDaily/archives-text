## EDITORIAL Being intellectual at Stanford 
### 
Countless adjectives may be
used to describe students
at elite educational institu
tions. They may be "driven","mo
tivated," or "smart," or they may
be labeled as "nerds" or "geeks".
Another label is "intellectual",
perhaps more balanced in its no
tion of stimulating students' intel
lect without implicitly passing
judgment on their social skills.
Where might Stanford fit in? A
September 2010 Huffington Post
ranking highlights the top ten
most intellectual colleges, and
Stanford is nowhere to be found.
Eight of the schools on the list
are characterized in one marked
ly different way: unlike Stanford,
they are small, liberal arts col
leges that do not function as re
search powerhouses or institu
tions serving graduate students.
Slightly more similar to Stanford
are the two universities on the
list: Brown and University of
Chicago. So what might differen
tiate the intellectual institution
from its non-intellectual counter
part? Given that universities are
comprised of self-selected stu
dent bodies for example, some
students might shy away from the
unofficial slogan that University
of Chicago is "where fun goes to
die" certain characteristics
might distinguish the typical (if
that term can be used) Stanford
student from a more "intellectu
al" student.
One possible difference high
lights the divergence of intellec
tual and practical. Some might be
quick to suggest that subjects in
the humanities are more intellec
tual, and Stanford's renown in en
gineering, science, and social sci
ences attracts students preparing
for delineated professional ca
reers. Of course, another set of re
cent rankings provided by the
Times Higher Education places
the Humanities at Stanford at
number two in the world.

Another possibility is loca
tion. Some students who choose
to go to school within Silicon Val
ley seek almost immediate em
ployment and immersion in an
entrepreneurial environment.
And other students who seek a
different experience may then
shy away.
None of this is to say that Stanford
lacks intellectual character. Clear
ly, Stanford undergraduates can
not be lumped into one category
or affixed with one large label.
There are surely many students in
the philosophy department who
would gladly debate Nietzsche
with students from University of
Chicago. Moreover, the kinds of
learning we consider to be "intel
lectual" are part of an arbitrary,
fluid category.
Stanford has another slightly
different priority in the form of
athletics. The front page of the
February 2nd Stanford Daily did,
after all, devote itself to a story on
the top recruiting class in Stanford
football history. Other statistics
have cited that, were Stanford its
own country, it would rank quite
highly on the lists of countries that
have amassed the most medals in
the Olympics. In contrast, both the
University of Chicago and Brown
do not boast a particularly impres
sive athletics record.
Whether it is seen as an "intel
lectual" institution or not, Stan
ford certainly offers a wide vari
ety of experiences to its under
graduates. The diverse nature of
the student body, the activities
available to it, and the variety of
academic focuses promoted by
Stanford enable any undergradu
ate to make what they will of their
undergraduate years. And while
you may raise a few eyebrows
with a conversation about Niet
zsche at the Tresidder Student
Union, there is certainly still the
possibility that someone will en
gage with you.

Whether it is seen as an "intel
lectual" institution or not, Stan
ford certainly offers a wide vari
ety of experiences to its under
graduates. The diverse nature of
the student body, the activities
available to it, and the variety of
academic focuses promoted by
Stanford enable any undergradu
ate to make what they will of their
undergraduate years. And while
you may raise a few eyebrows
with a conversation about Niet
zsche at the Tresidder Student
Union, there is certainly still the
possibility that someone will en
gage with you.
