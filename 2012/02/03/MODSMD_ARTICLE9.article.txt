# THE 						MIXED MESSAGES OF MODERNISM
## I'd say 
### D.S. Nelson 
This is my last column, for a
while at least, and one of the
last in Vol. 240 of The Daily. I
thought it would be fitting to provide
some commentary about just why I
have done my best to avoid saying
4tJ 5?

Using the third person is a long
held journalistic convention. But like
many conventions, it can be broken,
and nowhere are journalistic norms
more often flaunted than in opinions
sections. Dispassion and objectivity
are not required, and sometimes li
cense is taken to defy Strunk, White
and the AP guidelines. Some of the
unconventional behavior is justified:
it brings out more substance at the
cost of less space, oftentimes. It can be
distracting and irritating, too. But the
use of "I" in serious opinions writing,
I take profound umbrage with.

"I" serves as a consistent re
minder of the person writing the col
umn. Like a brushstroke on a paint
ing, it calls out the human origin of
the ideas discussed. That, in my opin
ion, distracts and detracts from a col
umn's purpose and potential.
If anything, I'd rather distance my
opinions from who I am. I would like
to let an opinion stand on its own.
When I write, I am not trying to make
my opinion known.The intention be
hind the action is not expressive. I am
hoping to make a solidly constructed
opinion known, so others can make a
judgment on it. The more I can ab
sent myself from that process, the
better. If I wanted everyone to know
what I thought and do that alone, I
could bring a soapbox to White
Plaza, stand on it and yell. But I do
not want the origin of the opinion to
be a significant fact, nor do I want the
manner of delivery to be intrusive. It
is my hope that readers will en
counter the work on their own terms,

taking it as though it were an idea
pulled from the air. The degree of
separation between my column and
myself might seem vaguely absurd,
but it does have purpose.
Nothing in my life has ever made
me as frustrated as the sentence," You
only say that because you're..."
When writing about the value of club
sports, the knee-jerk reaction on the
part of those in opposition is to say
that I am, in fact, a club sports player
and could not be expected to say any
thing else. That, however, is a blatant
misstep. When people speak, it is a re
flexive defense to typecast them, to
disparage their opinions on account
of who they are and to assume that
their opinions are formed merely as
direct reactions to one circumstance
or another. When this happens, cari
catures replace serious belief and per
sonal diatribes take the place of dia
logue. I find that the ad hominem at
tack lies at the basis of much theoret
ical agreement. When the mouth is
disagreeable, many find its product
likewise distasteful. The absence of
"I" forces a reader to assail my argu
ments, not my person.

But the ultimate reason why I
don't use "I" is that "I" is unimpor
tant. If my self were influential in how
you evaluate my arguments, you
would be failing us both (unless you
suspected me of factual inaccuracy).
What does "I" add? A face and a rep
utation, to be sure. But never should
those things figure into your stance
toward an opinion or argument. I
would never want someone to be
lieve in my arguments by force of
who I am. That is mimicry, not
thought.
In writing this, I have tried "I" on
for size and found that it adds noth
ing. Perhaps it makes a piece more
personable and relatable, but it is
never my intention to provide that
sort of personal satisfaction. Fiction
writers traffic in the currency of per
sonal fulfillment,but it is for opinions

writers to help clarify and introduce
new means of looking at the world
and its problems. To be sure, this does
not mean that dryness need be the
order of the day. Columnists should
have passion for their subjects but
imbue their writing with fervor in
stead of declaring their sympathies.
Columnists should strive for persua
sion, not commiseration, not to ex
press passion, but to help others to di
rect their own.

it brings out more substance at the
cost of less space, oftentimes. It can be
distracting and irritating, too. But the
use of "I" in serious opinions writing,
I take profound umbrage with.

"I" serves as a consistent re
minder of the person writing the col
umn. Like a brushstroke on a paint
ing, it calls out the human origin of
the ideas discussed. That, in my opin
ion, distracts and detracts from a col
umn's purpose and potential.
If anything, I'd rather distance my
opinions from who I am. I would like
to let an opinion stand on its own.
When I write, I am not trying to make
my opinion known.The intention be
hind the action is not expressive. I am
hoping to make a solidly constructed
opinion known, so others can make a
judgment on it. The more I can ab
sent myself from that process, the
better. If I wanted everyone to know
what I thought and do that alone, I
could bring a soapbox to White
Plaza, stand on it and yell. But I do
not want the origin of the opinion to
be a significant fact, nor do I want the
manner of delivery to be intrusive. It
is my hope that readers will en
counter the work on their own terms,

taking it as though it were an idea
pulled from the air. The degree of
separation between my column and
myself might seem vaguely absurd,
but it does have purpose.
Nothing in my life has ever made
me as frustrated as the sentence," You
only say that because you're..."
When writing about the value of club
sports, the knee-jerk reaction on the
part of those in opposition is to say
that I am, in fact, a club sports player
and could not be expected to say any
thing else. That, however, is a blatant
misstep. When people speak, it is a re
flexive defense to typecast them, to
disparage their opinions on account
of who they are and to assume that
their opinions are formed merely as
direct reactions to one circumstance
or another. When this happens, cari
catures replace serious belief and per
sonal diatribes take the place of dia
logue. I find that the ad hominem at
tack lies at the basis of much theoret
ical agreement. When the mouth is
disagreeable, many find its product
likewise distasteful. The absence of
"I" forces a reader to assail my argu
ments, not my person.

But the ultimate reason why I
don't use "I" is that "I" is unimpor
tant. If my self were influential in how
you evaluate my arguments, you
would be failing us both (unless you
suspected me of factual inaccuracy).
What does "I" add? A face and a rep
utation, to be sure. But never should
those things figure into your stance
toward an opinion or argument. I
would never want someone to be
lieve in my arguments by force of
who I am. That is mimicry, not
thought.
In writing this, I have tried "I" on
for size and found that it adds noth
ing. Perhaps it makes a piece more
personable and relatable, but it is
never my intention to provide that
sort of personal satisfaction. Fiction
writers traffic in the currency of per
sonal fulfillment,but it is for opinions

writers to help clarify and introduce
new means of looking at the world
and its problems. To be sure, this does
not mean that dryness need be the
order of the day. Columnists should
have passion for their subjects but
imbue their writing with fervor in
stead of declaring their sympathies.
Columnists should strive for persua
sion, not commiseration, not to ex
press passion, but to help others to di
rect their own.
