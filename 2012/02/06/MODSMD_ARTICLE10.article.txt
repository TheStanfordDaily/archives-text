# SCBM A STUDENTRUN SHOW
## PROFILE 
### ETHAN KESSINGER 
cc ~W" t started with just a cou-
I pie of guys in the '9os,
I and has grown into
.A. what it is today."
This statement could describe
many legacies of the '9os, from
bands such as The Wallflowers to
dot-com start-ups and the first
MP3 players. It also happens to be
how Emily Song 'l3 describes the
beginning of the Stanford Cardinal
Broadcasting Network (SCBN).
SCBN, Stanford's only television
station, has made big strides since
those "couple of guys" back in the
day.
On the surface, SCBN seems
like many other college television
stations. Viewership is not high,
and the station focuses more on
the experience of making televi
sion programs than the commer
cial success of the finished prod
uct, but the similarities end there.
SCBN is an entirely student
run organization. While this cre
ates challenges in student com
mitment and campus-wide adver
tisement, it allows motivated stu
dents the opportunity to experi
ence all aspects of running a tele
vision station.
Song, the current station man
ager, knows firsthand how diffi
cult it is to get students committed
to the group, whether they are
group members or recruits.

"There was one moment when I
was tabling at White Plaza for four
hours yelling at people about
SCBN by myself," she said. "But I
got a lot of people to sign up and
got amazing interns from that day."
Fortunately for Song, this year
SCBN has gained significantly
more student involvement. There
are eight student executives who
cater to administrative needs, in
addition to determining and edit
ing show content. This work
would be in vain without the hun
dreds of other students affiliated
with the station, which include
show producers, actors, hosts and
cameramen.
The station broadcasts panels
from the Career and Develop
ment Center, student-led talk
shows and, in the past, comedy sit
coms.
"There are never really any
strict requirements or quotas,"
said Victoria Shantrell Asbury
'll. "If you have some interesting
content and want to put it on, you
could."
Asbury has hosted "The Dia
logue" for the past two years. The
program is a talk show that tries to
initiate conversations throughout
campus on subjects ranging from
dating to homophobia. Asbury
made it clear that to her, it matters
more what her guests have to say
than who they are.
'"The Dialogue' is about hav
ing regular, everyday people get
together and have a conversa
tion," she said. "It was never about

having just the popular or famous
people on."

SCBN works with students
who want experience in the enter
tainment industry through the
media of television and opens its
doors to nearly everyone on cam
pus. All Stanford students are wel
come to submit material to be
placed on SCBN, even if just an
idea. Those more interested in be
hind-the-scenes work can also
find their niches. For instance, stu
dents can intern with the execu
tive team, work as cameramen,
stagehands, editors or producers.
SCBN also gives back to the
Stanford community by offering
equipment for rental to students.
As long as they credit the station,
anyone with a vision or an im
pending class project has access
to professional quality equipment.
Beyond students, SCBN teams
up with on-campus groups to pro
mote their activities.
This past fall the station fea
tured a video by the Stanford jug
gling troupe, Down with Gravity,
titled, "Juggling Revolution."
These features allow students
to get a closer look at the variety
of activities that they may never
have an opportunity to experi
ence firsthand, in addition to ful
filling one of SCBN's greatest re
sponsibilities: broadcasting the
unique voices and talents of
the Stanford community.
