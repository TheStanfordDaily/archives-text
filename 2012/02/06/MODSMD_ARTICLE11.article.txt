## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN I find your lack of faith disturbing 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Newt Gingrich has gotten a
lot of flak recently for ag
gressively promoting his
vision of a permanent U.S. base on
the moon, populated by a suffi
cient number of citizens to make
it America's 51st state. Politicians
and pundits on both sides of the
aisle seemed to find the idea more
loony than lunar.
Republicans lamented the
high costs such a big government
program would inevitably entail,
arguing that Leviathan had grown
large enough on Earth without
spreading its nefarious tentacles
into outer space.

Mitt Romney, ever the cost
cutting businessman, snorted that,
"If I had a business executive
come to me and say, 'I wanted to
spend a few hundred billion dol
lars to put a colony on the moon,'
I'd say, 'You're fired.'" A satellite
radio ad by the Santorum cam
paign called Gingrich's moon
base idea "fiscal insanity" and
"another reason true conserva
tives are uniting behind Rick San
torum." In a separate op-ed, Mr.
Santorum again appealed to the
Tea Party shibboleth of fiscal aus
terity, declaring "it's hard to take
the Speaker seriously as a fiscal
conservative when he puts these
extravagant expensive ideas over
the economic well-being of the
next generation."
Liberals, wary about the diver
sion of valuable federal funds
away from the fraying threads of
the social safety net, also took
pains to ensure that Mr. Gin
grich's scheme never leaves the
launch pad. In the New York
Times, Charles Blow lambasted
the former Speaker's plan to
launch billions of dollars into
space at the expense of much
needed social programs here at
home, calling Gingrich a "virtual
supernova of megalomaniacal
madness." Mr. Blow spoke for
many space-skeptical liberals
when he opined that "the last
thing that people who can't hold
on to their jobs and houses here
on Earth want to hear about is a
colony on the Moon ... Earth to
Newt: phone home."
But I'm with Mr. Gingrich on
this one. A collective, national
venture of grandiose ambition, in
which we accomplish something
great together, may be exactly
what this country needs right now.
Everywhere one looks, espe
cially this campaign season, one
sees an America riven by partisan
bickering, squabbling viciously
over entitlement cuts and tax re
form and furiously dividing and
subdividing itself into percentage
points and classes. We fight over,
in the parlance of political science,
"who gets what, when and how."
But lost in all this is any sense of
collective purpose a sense that
the country can accomplish great
things through the sustained appli
cation of determined national will.

In some regard, this is simply a
loss of faith conditioned by time
and wearying experience. For the
last half-century, nearly all of
America's great national projects
have concerned either guns and
ammo wars in Vietnam, Iraq
and Afghanistan —or exhaust
ing, enervating battles of another
sort in programs like Lyndon
Johnson's failed War on Poverty.

But it doesn't have to be that
way. National pride can be har
nessed for good, as it was with the
interstate highway system, the

Peace Corps and the planting of
an American flag on the moon.
As early as June 1978, when he
delivered his now-famous com
mencement speech at Harvard, So
viet dissident and writer Alexander
Solzhenitsyn diagnosed the funda
mental problems of the West as
hyper-individualism, a paralyzing
narrowness of vision and the de
cline and fall of "civil courage"
the willingness of individuals to
sacrifice for the greater good. By
persistent recourse to an unin
spired legalism, he declared, Amer
icans had precluded the opportuni
ty to "urge self-restraint, sacrifice
and selfless risk: it would sound
simply absurd." He concluded with
a passage that sounds as if it could
have easily come directly from a
description of the Gingrich space
campaign:
"A statesman who wants to
achieve something important and
highly constructive for his country
has to move cautiously and even
timidly; there are thousands of
hasty and irresponsible critics
around him, parliament and the
press keep rebuffing him ... Ac
tually an outstanding and particu
larly gifted person who has unusu
al and unexpected initiatives in
mind hardly gets a chance to as
sert himself; from the very begin
ning, dozens of traps will be set
out for him. Thus mediocrity tri
umphs with the excuse of restric
tions imposed by democracy."
As mercurial, unstable, lecher
ous and wholly unfit for the presi
dency as Mr. Gingrich may be, I
admire him for his unparalleled
courage to dream and dare, to
think big and to transcend the
confines of "mediocrity ... with
the excuse of restrictions imposed
by democracy." America could
use a symbolic victory to unite us
behind something constructive
to be confident, as we once were,
that this country can get some
thing done besides drop bombs
and squabble.
I look forward to the day when
America regains its "civil courage"
the audacity to reach literally
for the stars and to individually
sacrifice for the achievement of
something we do together.

As mercurial, unstable, lecher

America regains its "civil courage"
the audacity to reach literally

sacrifice for the achievement of
something we do together.

day America
regains its
« • *i
civil
courage."

Newt Gingrich has gotten a
lot of flak recently for ag
gressively promoting his
vision of a permanent U.S. base on
the moon, populated by a suffi
cient number of citizens to make
it America's 51st state. Politicians
and pundits on both sides of the
aisle seemed to find the idea more
loony than lunar.
Republicans lamented the
high costs such a big government
program would inevitably entail,
arguing that Leviathan had grown
large enough on Earth without
spreading its nefarious tentacles
into outer space.

Mitt Romney, ever the cost
cutting businessman, snorted that,
"If I had a business executive
come to me and say, 'I wanted to
spend a few hundred billion dol
lars to put a colony on the moon,'
I'd say, 'You're fired.'" A satellite
radio ad by the Santorum cam
paign called Gingrich's moon
base idea "fiscal insanity" and
"another reason true conserva
tives are uniting behind Rick San
torum." In a separate op-ed, Mr.
Santorum again appealed to the
Tea Party shibboleth of fiscal aus
terity, declaring "it's hard to take
the Speaker seriously as a fiscal
conservative when he puts these
extravagant expensive ideas over
the economic well-being of the
next generation."
Liberals, wary about the diver
sion of valuable federal funds
away from the fraying threads of
the social safety net, also took
pains to ensure that Mr. Gin
grich's scheme never leaves the
launch pad. In the New York
Times, Charles Blow lambasted
the former Speaker's plan to
launch billions of dollars into
space at the expense of much
needed social programs here at
home, calling Gingrich a "virtual
supernova of megalomaniacal
madness." Mr. Blow spoke for
many space-skeptical liberals
when he opined that "the last
thing that people who can't hold
on to their jobs and houses here
on Earth want to hear about is a
colony on the Moon ... Earth to
Newt: phone home."
But I'm with Mr. Gingrich on
this one. A collective, national
venture of grandiose ambition, in
which we accomplish something
great together, may be exactly
what this country needs right now.
Everywhere one looks, espe
cially this campaign season, one
sees an America riven by partisan
bickering, squabbling viciously
over entitlement cuts and tax re
form and furiously dividing and
subdividing itself into percentage
points and classes. We fight over,
in the parlance of political science,
"who gets what, when and how."
But lost in all this is any sense of
collective purpose a sense that
the country can accomplish great
things through the sustained appli
cation of determined national will.

In some regard, this is simply a
loss of faith conditioned by time
and wearying experience. For the
last half-century, nearly all of
America's great national projects
have concerned either guns and
ammo wars in Vietnam, Iraq
and Afghanistan —or exhaust
ing, enervating battles of another
sort in programs like Lyndon
Johnson's failed War on Poverty.

But it doesn't have to be that
way. National pride can be har
nessed for good, as it was with the
interstate highway system, the

Peace Corps and the planting of
an American flag on the moon.
As early as June 1978, when he
delivered his now-famous com
mencement speech at Harvard, So
viet dissident and writer Alexander
Solzhenitsyn diagnosed the funda
mental problems of the West as
hyper-individualism, a paralyzing
narrowness of vision and the de
cline and fall of "civil courage"
the willingness of individuals to
sacrifice for the greater good. By
persistent recourse to an unin
spired legalism, he declared, Amer
icans had precluded the opportuni
ty to "urge self-restraint, sacrifice
and selfless risk: it would sound
simply absurd." He concluded with
a passage that sounds as if it could
have easily come directly from a
description of the Gingrich space
campaign:
"A statesman who wants to
achieve something important and
highly constructive for his country
has to move cautiously and even
timidly; there are thousands of
hasty and irresponsible critics
around him, parliament and the
press keep rebuffing him ... Ac
tually an outstanding and particu
larly gifted person who has unusu
al and unexpected initiatives in
mind hardly gets a chance to as
sert himself; from the very begin
ning, dozens of traps will be set
out for him. Thus mediocrity tri
umphs with the excuse of restric
