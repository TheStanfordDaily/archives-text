# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## Skepticism and simple stories 
### I Nina Chung 
You know that one elderly
couple sitting together on
the bench by the waterfront
in that one chick flick that you
swear you're never going to see?
"I would rather have gone to
the quad, I think," he said.
"Yes, we'll have to do that next
time," she responded. "Oh, I got
those cherry muffins we wanted,
but they're a bit dry ..."
I was sitting on the light brown
bench at Lake Lag with that cou
ple yesterday. My friend beside me
was reading a book with a protag
onist named "Hiro Protagonist."
Two separate students I knew
strolled by, each holding the hand
of a significant other I had no idea
they had.
The elderly couple continued
on about someone's kids, after
leaving once and returning to the
bench. The woman turned to me
then, with a very happy face:
"Excuse me do you know
when the Superbowl is playing
today?"
And the playlist of that one fra
ternity house went from "Hakuna
Matata" to "Don't Stop Believin'."

All I could think was how while
I sometimes convince myself that
life is excruciatingly dramatic, I
forget how it can be so timelessly
simple.

I got thirsty, so we ventured into
the ceramics building behind us for
a water fountain. We ran into a mu
tual friend who was spending the
afternoon sketching with two
other girls at a table on the porch.
"Does it help? Drawing some
thing so simple?" one of them
asked, as her friend shaded in a
three-dimensional shape.

"Yeah, I don't have to draw
complicated arms for once."
I thought it was funny that I was
hearing this dialogue in the midst
of thinking about why this day
seemed so effortless, so I interrupt
ed no better word for it their
conversation to ask for permission
to reprint their words, as I've done
just now.

Then my friend and I headed
back to our original bench, passing
that elderly couple as they left the
lake. The woman smiled broadly at
me.

The interesting thing about
writing is its ability to condense life
into digestible stories. And we
often resent it. Did this pleasant
story seem real to you? Or did it
seem removed and thus unreal?
Because in some stories, couples
do stay married until they're old.
Characters run into each other in
unexpected, out-of-context situa
tions. Strangers meet strangers
that voice the thoughts they were
literally just thinking. In the
movies, these things happen, and
oh, do we scoff. Life is complicated.
Don't be naive.

But my mom is right, as she usu
ally is, though I don't know how
much so until later: "Those things
do happen in real life!!!" (My mom
has recently taken to great repeti
tion of this statement.) The fact,
though, that the statement exists at
all, often with incredulity and an
exclamation point, says something:
namely, we don't believe it. Indeed,
history courses have taught me
that a good dose of skepticism is
healthy. But more and more I'm
realizing how easily I can over
dose.
"Love is cliche" and "I hate
cliches" were the catch phrases I
used to stamp all over my note

books and binders in high school.
And, until recently, "I hate ro
mantic comedies." (But, seriously
"When Harry Met Sally"?!
How could I think I wouldn't like
"When Harry Met Sally"?!) At
least in part, this self-branding
campaign was an effort to prove I
was more complex than any easy
movie montage or oft-stated
song line. I thought I was suffi
ciently old and jaded enough to
conquer simplicity, pish-tosh.
Skepticism was sophisticated, so
phisticated was cool and, in this
world, being "cool" is really im
portant even if the word's
exact definition is in constant
flux. But, oh, the irony of think
ing I could hate a "cliche" like
love , when I soon learned how
much of a gift it actually is.
My default setting to general
skepticism caused and causes
problems. It's a tiresome position
that has forced me to play devil's
advocate and say things simply be
cause another person didn't. It's
useless controversy in casual con
versation, poison for so many of
my family relationships. Skepti
cism is what keeps me from a par
ticular relationship, a future I
might reject, my trust in someone.
And the fact is, for all of the ways
we say we're not hopeless roman
tics, we are. Every time we ask a
new acquaintance if they by
chance know another friend of
ours, or take a chance on someone
we keep thinking about that is
us permitting, finally, belief in
something pure and simple, with
out letting reason or logic inter
fere.

In a skeptical world, slow after
noons are cliche, the elderly couple
is picturesque, the soundtrack is
completely coincidental in this col
umn. In a skeptical world, my day
was all of those things. But, if my
day was going to stay my day, I
would have to choose otherwise.
So I would choose to believe in
something simpler.

This is the first column of the new
volume. Nina's hopeful for it, but
wants to hear you first. She's waiting
literally!â€”for a thought or two,
