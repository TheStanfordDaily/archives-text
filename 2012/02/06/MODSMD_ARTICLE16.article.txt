# Researchers investigate how humor activates kids'brains
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Alice Phillips 
Researchers at the Stanford
University School of Medicine
have shown that parts of the brain
network that react to humor in an
adult are already present in chil
dren ages six to 12. These neural
circuits, while present in children,
develop into more sophisticated
networks as children mature, ac
cording to a statement on the
School of Medicine's website.
The research team studied the

functional magnetic resonance im
aging (fMRI) brain scans of six- to
12-year-old children who watched
short video clips. The children in
the study were of average intelli
gence or higher and did not have
any psychiatric or developmental
problems. The researchers used
videos in three categories to evalu
ate the brain activity: funny, posi
tive and neutral.

According to the School of
Medicine's statement, the funny
videos were intended to be re
warding and positive to watch
while the positive videos were only
intended to be rewarding.The neu
tral videos were intended to be nei
ther funny nor rewarding.

The researchers found that the
funny videos activated two regions
in the children's brains that are also
activated in adults' brains when
they view funny material. Howev
er, an area of the brain known as
the temporal-occipital-parietal
junction, which processes per
ceived incongruities, was activated
in both the left and right hemi
spheres of the children's brains.
This area is only activated on the
left side of the brain in adult sub
jects reacting to similar material.
Humor also activated the brain's
mesolimbic regions, which process

rewards.
The research team included
Allan Reiss, director of the Center
for Interdisciplinary Brain Sci
ences Research at Stanford, and
Michelle Neely 'll, currently a
Cornell medical student. The study
was published in the Feb. 1 issue of
the Journal of Neuroscience.
