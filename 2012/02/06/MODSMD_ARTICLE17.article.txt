## ROUTING THE CATS TINKLE'S DOUBLE-DOUBLE KEEPS CARD ROLLING 
### DEAN McARDLE STAFF WRITER 
After struggling to a win against a tough
Arizona State team on Thursday, the Stanford
women's basketball team completed its sweep
of the Arizona schools with a 91-51 blowout
over Arizona on Saturday.
The superstar of Saturday's game surpris
ingly was not one of the Ogwumike sisters, but
instead junior Joslyn Tinkle, who led the Car
dinal with a career-high 22 points along with 11
rebounds. Tinkle was one of five players in
double-digits for Stanford (20-1,11-0 Pac-12),
which picked up its 17th win in a row and 21st
straight victory over Arizona (13-10,2-9).
Stanford's starting forwards made their in
side presence felt, accounting for 55 points
and 27 rebounds enough to outscore Ari
zona on their own. Sophomore Chiney Og
wumike poured in 18 points, and her sister,
senior Nnemkadi Ogwumike, added 15 for
the Cardinal.
The 40-point margin stands in stark con
trast to Stanford's pair of previous down-to

the-wire contests. Cal pushed the Cardinal to
overtime on Jan. 28, and Arizona State had
Stanford knotted at 40 apiece in the second
half on Thursday before Stanford pulled away.
"We've kind of been playing people closer
than we wanted to," Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer said of the squad's previous
games.
On Saturday, though, Stanford was clicking
on all cylinders offensively, shooting just over
50 percent from the field.
The Cardinal also started to find its stroke
from behind the arc, hitting eight three-point
ers. The team had struggled recently from
three-point land, shooting just 24 percent from
deep in its last three contests.
When Stanford was off the mark it cleaned
up its misses, accumulating 22 second-chance
points, mostly due to the fact that the Cardinal
out-rebounded the Wildcats by a margin of
48-33.
Arizona can look to its youth as a sign of
better things to come. Freshman center Aley
Rohde scored nine points and grabbed 11 re
bounds, while sophomore guard Candice

Warthen came off the bench for 13 points to
pace the Wildcats.
Stanford came out swinging and leaped to a
10-0 lead in the opening three minutes. Ari
zona responded with seven straight points be
fore the Cardinal went on an 18-2 run to make
the score 31-9 with 9:46 left in the first half.
From there, the outcome was never in
doubt.
Stanford capitalized on Wildcat mistakes
with 12 points off turnovers in the first half, and
the Cardinal's lead was 20 points at the break.
The second half would prove to be more of
the same. Sophomore Toni Kokenis splashed
in a three on an assist from freshman Amber
Orrange on Stanford's first possession of the
half and finished the game with 11 points,
going 4-8 on field goals. Meanwhile, Orrange
was perfect from the floor, gathering 10 points
on 5-5 shooting.
Rohde sunk a free throw at the 15:45 mark
to cut the Stanford lead to 27. The Cardinal re
sponded by racking up 16 unanswered points


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Junior Joslyn Tinkle had a career-high 22 points at Arizona Saturday and was one of two Cardinal players with double-doubles in the 91-51 rout
of the Wildcats. Stanford improved to 20-1 and a perfect 11-0 in the Pac-12 and will host the L.A. schools at Maples Pavilion this week.
to make the score 79-36 and put
the game out of reach.
The Cardinal stepped up its de
fense in the second half as well. A
swarm of Stanford jerseys greeted
Arizona on every possession,
holding the Wildcats to 21 percent
shooting and just 20 points in the
second half.The Ogwumike sisters
walled off the paint and combined
to block six Arizona shots on the
day.
Fresh legs contributed to the
stifling defense as well. The bench
saw significant time for Stanford
with 10 players getting more than
10 minutes in the game.
"I like the fact we were able to
get everybody in and everyone
contributed," VanDerveer said.

Freshman forwards Erica

Payne and Taylor Greenfield both
tallied six points for Stanford off
the bench, and senior guard Lindy
La Rocque dished out four assists.
Despite the margin of victory,
Arizona coach Niya Butts saw
progress from her squad.
"I didn't like the outcome, but
the team did a lot of things this
weekend that we really improved
on," Butts said.
Tinkle described the win as a
statement game for the Cardinal.
"We really knew coming into
this game what we had to do to
prove to everyone to prove to
ourselves that we are more ca
pable, and we can reach to a high
er level," she said
The Cardinal returns home this
week to face the L.A. schools at
Maples Pavilion, tangling with
USC on Thursday night and
UCLA Sunday.

The superstar of Saturday's game surpris
ingly was not one of the Ogwumike sisters, but
instead junior Joslyn Tinkle, who led the Car
dinal with a career-high 22 points along with 11
rebounds. Tinkle was one of five players in
double-digits for Stanford (20-1,11-0 Pac-12),
which picked up its 17th win in a row and 21st
straight victory over Arizona (13-10,2-9).
Stanford's starting forwards made their in
side presence felt, accounting for 55 points
and 27 rebounds enough to outscore Ari
zona on their own. Sophomore Chiney Og
wumike poured in 18 points, and her sister,
senior Nnemkadi Ogwumike, added 15 for
the Cardinal.
The 40-point margin stands in stark con
trast to Stanford's pair of previous down-to

the-wire contests. Cal pushed the Cardinal to
overtime on Jan. 28, and Arizona State had
Stanford knotted at 40 apiece in the second
half on Thursday before Stanford pulled away.
"We've kind of been playing people closer
than we wanted to," Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer said of the squad's previous
games.
On Saturday, though, Stanford was clicking
on all cylinders offensively, shooting just over
50 percent from the field.
The Cardinal also started to find its stroke
from behind the arc, hitting eight three-point
ers. The team had struggled recently from
three-point land, shooting just 24 percent from
deep in its last three contests.
When Stanford was off the mark it cleaned
up its misses, accumulating 22 second-chance
points, mostly due to the fact that the Cardinal
out-rebounded the Wildcats by a margin of
48-33.
Arizona can look to its youth as a sign of
better things to come. Freshman center Aley
Rohde scored nine points and grabbed 11 re
bounds, while sophomore guard Candice

Warthen came off the bench for 13 points to
pace the Wildcats.
Stanford came out swinging and leaped to a
10-0 lead in the opening three minutes. Ari
zona responded with seven straight points be
fore the Cardinal went on an 18-2 run to make
the score 31-9 with 9:46 left in the first half.
From there, the outcome was never in
doubt.
Stanford capitalized on Wildcat mistakes
with 12 points off turnovers in the first half, and
the Cardinal's lead was 20 points at the break.
The second half would prove to be more of
the same. Sophomore Toni Kokenis splashed
in a three on an assist from freshman Amber
Orrange on Stanford's first possession of the
half and finished the game with 11 points,
going 4-8 on field goals. Meanwhile, Orrange
was perfect from the floor, gathering 10 points
on 5-5 shooting.
Rohde sunk a free throw at the 15:45 mark
to cut the Stanford lead to 27. The Cardinal re
sponded by racking up 16 unanswered points

Junior Joslyn Tinkle had a career-high 22 points at Arizona Saturday and was one of two Cardinal players with double-doubles in the 91-51 rout
of the Wildcats. Stanford improved to 20-1 and a perfect 11-0 in the Pac-12 and will host the L.A. schools at Maples Pavilion this week.
to make the score 79-36 and put
the game out of reach.
The Cardinal stepped up its de
fense in the second half as well. A
swarm of Stanford jerseys greeted
Arizona on every possession,
holding the Wildcats to 21 percent
shooting and just 20 points in the
second half.The Ogwumike sisters
walled off the paint and combined
to block six Arizona shots on the
day.
Fresh legs contributed to the
stifling defense as well. The bench
saw significant time for Stanford
with 10 players getting more than
10 minutes in the game.
"I like the fact we were able to
get everybody in and everyone
contributed," VanDerveer said.

Freshman forwards Erica

Payne and Taylor Greenfield both
tallied six points for Stanford off
the bench, and senior guard Lindy
La Rocque dished out four assists.
Despite the margin of victory,
Arizona coach Niya Butts saw
progress from her squad.
"I didn't like the outcome, but
the team did a lot of things this
weekend that we really improved
on," Butts said.
Tinkle described the win as a
statement game for the Cardinal.
"We really knew coming into
this game what we had to do to
prove to everyone to prove to
ourselves that we are more ca
pable, and we can reach to a high
er level," she said
The Cardinal returns home this
week to face the L.A. schools at
Maples Pavilion, tangling with
USC on Thursday night and
UCLA Sunday.
