# Mourinho and England: Made to be
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Maybe it's because I'm
finally starting to get
the hang of Ameri
can sports, or that I'm
mellowing in my old
age, but it seems like a while since I re
ceived any good hate mail in re
sponse to my columns.

I used to get about one complaint
every week, mostly attacking me for
being a foreigner and informing me
that I have no place daring to have an
opinion about U.S. sports. Admitted
ly. that opinion was often that football
games take far too long (like the
Super Bowl) and that the catcher's
mitt in baseball is a comically-giant
hand, but now five of my last six
columns have been firmly centered
on things this side of the Atlantic...
and nothing.

In fact, the most insulting thing
anyone said to me last week was
when a Mend asked very much
mistakenly I hasten to add why I
wasn't a big soccer fan because I ap
parently only talk about football and
basketball anymore.

So let's talk about soccer even
though I might be upsetting people. It
came out recently that the English
Football Association may be consid
ering none other than Jose Mario dos
Santos Felix Mourinho as the re
placement for England manager
Fabio Capello after the European
Football Championship this summer.
In case you know nothing about
Mourinho, he is a controversial fig
ure.Though clearly a talented manag
er, he has done little to win the hearts
and minds of opposing fans or the au
thorities, and is a walking definition of
the words "arrogant" and "outspo
ken." If I need any pointers in upset
ting people, I should turn to the self
declared "special one," a man who
once boasted he had no equals, saying
the world's hierarchy was "God, and
after God, me."

As an England soccer fan, it has
been frustrating how the English
Football Association has picked for
eigners over English managers in re
cent years, and worse because the ex
periment so far doesn't appear to be
working. We certainly don't look like
a team worthy of winning another
World Cup anytime soon. It is also
hard to believe that a non-English
boss, even with all the credentials in
the world, will really care enough
