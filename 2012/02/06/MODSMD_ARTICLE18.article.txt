# Mourinho and England: Made to be
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Maybe it's because I'm
finally starting to get
the hang of Ameri
can sports, or that I'm
mellowing in my old
age, but it seems like a while since I re
ceived any good hate mail in re
sponse to my columns.

I used to get about one complaint
every week, mostly attacking me for
being a foreigner and informing me
that I have no place daring to have an
opinion about U.S. sports. Admitted
ly. that opinion was often that football
games take far too long (like the
Super Bowl) and that the catcher's
mitt in baseball is a comically-giant
hand, but now five of my last six
columns have been firmly centered
on things this side of the Atlantic...
and nothing.

In fact, the most insulting thing
anyone said to me last week was
when a Mend asked very much
mistakenly I hasten to add why I
wasn't a big soccer fan because I ap
parently only talk about football and
basketball anymore.

So let's talk about soccer even
though I might be upsetting people. It
came out recently that the English
Football Association may be consid
ering none other than Jose Mario dos
Santos Felix Mourinho as the re
placement for England manager
Fabio Capello after the European
Football Championship this summer.
In case you know nothing about
Mourinho, he is a controversial fig
ure.Though clearly a talented manag
er, he has done little to win the hearts
and minds of opposing fans or the au
thorities, and is a walking definition of
the words "arrogant" and "outspo
ken." If I need any pointers in upset
ting people, I should turn to the self
declared "special one," a man who
once boasted he had no equals, saying
the world's hierarchy was "God, and
after God, me."

As an England soccer fan, it has
been frustrating how the English
Football Association has picked for
eigners over English managers in re
cent years, and worse because the ex
periment so far doesn't appear to be
working. We certainly don't look like
a team worthy of winning another
World Cup anytime soon. It is also
hard to believe that a non-English
boss, even with all the credentials in
the world, will really care enough
when push comes to shove. But
maybe, just maybe, Mourinho could
be the elusive case that proves histo
ry wrong.
While in charge of Chelsea he
made enough enemies in the world
of English soccer to last a lifetime
including my hometown, Reading,
after alleging that the local medical
services did not do all they could to
care for goalkeeper Petr Cech after a
serious head injury.
It's no secret that everyone hates
the English, particularly on the pitch.
Soccer rivalries, history and attempts
to draw attention to the serious cor
ruption at the heart of the soccer
world have created enemies every
where. From countries like Scotland
and Argentina to key figures like
FIFA President Sepp Blatter and
UEFA President Michel Platini,
everyone delights in our downfall. So
deep does the dislike go that some
have even attempted to cast doubt
on the indisputable fact that soccer
was born in England.
Already, then, Mourinho has
something in common with us: he
knows what it's like to be the bad guy.
He wouldn't be a diplomatic figure
on the world stage, and he's not going
to make us any friends, but I'm not
sure if I care about that anymore. Ap
parently, nothing England does is ap
preciated. When we play by the
(flawed and corrupt) system we get

shunned; when we complain, we get
ostracized.

I don't think England is going to
be winning any trophies for a long
time due to a critical lack of invest
ment and de velopment of young tal
ent, so the chance of getting our own
back on FIFA and UEFA on the
field is practically non-existent. As
good as Mourinho or any of his Eng
lish counterparts may be, I'm not ex
pecting any miracles. I've been down
that route again and again, and had
my heart crushed every time.
But, on the bright side, if we are
going to go down in flames, at least
with Mourinho we'll go down fight
ing. He would take no prisoners, and
I think many England fans would
enjoy seeing him tear into the oppo
sition, the authorities and even the
press. He would whine and moan and
complain, but always for us. His en
thusiasm would spill overâ€”he once
stepped across the sideline to pass a
ball back to his team and he
would occasionally get banned. He
might even flaunt that ban by hiding
in a laundry cart so he could still give
talk to his team at the halftime (al
legedly).
If we can't beat them on the field
and we won't join them in their shady
and corrupt deals, let's be the thorn in
their side and just do whatever we
can to annoy the hell out of world
soccer.

Like all the greatest English kings,
Tom Taylor welcomes your hatred
for his work. Threaten to do off with
his head at tom.taylor@stanford.
