# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Card upsets No. 1 BYU two times 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
It's not often you get a chance to
knock off number one. It's even more
rare to get a chance to knock off num
ber one twice in the same weekend. But
that was no problem for the Stanford
men's volleyball team.
The No. 7 Cardinal (7-2, 4-1 MPSF)
rode a wave of brilliant performances
from several different players over the
weekend to knock off top-ranked BYU
(6-3, 4-2) in consecutive nights, 25-21,
20-25,25-20,25-18 and 35-33,25-23,25-
22, resulting in Stanford's first-ever
road sweep of BYU.
"We played well, and it was fun in
front of 4,500 people," head coach John
Kosty replied when asked to sum up the
weekend.
On Friday, a pair of career-best
nights from sophomores Steven Irvin
and Brian Cook propelled the Cardinal
to victory. The emergence of Stanford's
supremely talented sophomores has
been a theme this season, and against
the Cougars, it was no different. Irvin
finished with a double-double of 14
kills and 12 digs, hitting at an impressive
.476 clip, while Cook went for a career
high 20 kills at a .390 hitting percentage,
adding seven digs and two solo blocks.
"The sophomores have to play
well," Kosty said. "I thought Steven
Irvin had an incredible Friday match.
He played some of the best volleyball
he has played as a Stanford Cardinal."
Senior setter Evan Barry also set the
Cardinal up for success in his return
from injury, as he finished with 54 as
sists to go along with seven digs and
three kills. Stanford hit .358 as a team, a
reflection of Barry's outstanding per-
formance.
"To be honest, I didn't know
about the career high," Cook
said. "The matches flowed very
easily for us because Evan Barry
ran such a balanced offense. Our
hitters all had confidence be
cause we knew the opposing
blockers couldn't focus in on any
one of us."
Not to be forgotten in the ex
citement of the career-best
nights were the always-consis
tent seniors Brad Lawson and
Erik Shoji. Lawson finished with
a solid 15 kills, five digs and an
ace while Shoji had 10 digs.
Saturday proved to be just as
exciting for this improving Stan
ford squad, which outlasted the
Cougars in a marathon first set
before holding them off in the
final two. The Cardinal once
more featured a balanced attack
that resulted in four players fin
ishing with double-digit kills:
Lawson (14), Irvin (12), sopho
more Eric Mochalski (11) and

Cook (10). Stanford was once
more extremely efficient on the
attack, hitting .337 as a team be
hind 47 assists from Barry.
Despite missing sophomore
outside hitter Taylor Sander
the Cougars' leading hitter this
season with nearly five kills per
set BYU did not go down
without a fight. The first set fea
tured an unusually high point
total (68) and saw the two teams
fight off a combined 10 set
points, including seven by BYU.
Stanford was finally able to fin
ish off the Cougars thanks to a
combined block by Lawson and
senior Gus Ellis. The momentum
of winning the first set carried
the Cardinal through the second
and third sets.
"Our bench had so much en
ergy, it was amazing," Mochalski
said. "You could hear them over
4,000-plus fans. Unreal."
Was playing the No. 1 team in
the country extra motivation for
Stanford?
"Of course," Mochalski said.
"Playing the No. 1 team is one
thing. Playing them on their
home court in front of that many
people is another. It is so easy to
get motivated for a match like

that."
Kosty was slightly more ana
lytical in his assessment.
"We play in such a tough
league, and we understand that
No. 1 could be there for any
where between a week and the
whole season," he said. "BYU is a
very good team, and we knew we
had to play at a really high level
to beat them, especially when
they are at home."
While the results of these two
matches are obviously big for the
Cardinal, Kosty is hoping that
the turnaround actually came
last weekend in the squad's loss
to Penn State.
"The Penn State loss may
have kicked us into gear, allow
ing us to win twice at BYU, espe
cially because not many people
are going to be able to do that
this year," Kosty said. "These two
wins are going to be huge for us
down the stretch."
The Cardinal continues its
grueling 10-game road stretch
this weekend in Southern Cali
fornia against Long Beach State
and Cal State Northridge,

Sophomore Steve Irvin's Friday night double-double got the Cardinal's weekend off to a good start, as
Stanford went on to upend No. 1 BYU twice on the road, and moved to second place in the MPSF standings.
It's not often you get a chance to
knock off number one. It's even more
rare to get a chance to knock off num
ber one twice in the same weekend. But
that was no problem for the Stanford
men's volleyball team.
The No. 7 Cardinal (7-2, 4-1 MPSF)
rode a wave of brilliant performances
from several different players over the
weekend to knock off top-ranked BYU
(6-3, 4-2) in consecutive nights, 25-21,
20-25,25-20,25-18 and 35-33,25-23,25-
22, resulting in Stanford's first-ever
road sweep of BYU.
"We played well, and it was fun in
front of 4,500 people," head coach John
Kosty replied when asked to sum up the
weekend.
On Friday, a pair of career-best
nights from sophomores Steven Irvin
and Brian Cook propelled the Cardinal
to victory. The emergence of Stanford's
supremely talented sophomores has
been a theme this season, and against
the Cougars, it was no different. Irvin
finished with a double-double of 14
kills and 12 digs, hitting at an impressive
.476 clip, while Cook went for a career
high 20 kills at a .390 hitting percentage,
adding seven digs and two solo blocks.
"The sophomores have to play
well," Kosty said. "I thought Steven
Irvin had an incredible Friday match.
He played some of the best volleyball
he has played as a Stanford Cardinal."
Senior setter Evan Barry also set the
Cardinal up for success in his return
from injury, as he finished with 54 as
sists to go along with seven digs and
three kills. Stanford hit .358 as a team, a
reflection of Barry's outstanding per-
formance.
"To be honest, I didn't know
about the career high," Cook
said. "The matches flowed very
easily for us because Evan Barry
ran such a balanced offense. Our
hitters all had confidence be
cause we knew the opposing
blockers couldn't focus in on any
one of us."
Not to be forgotten in the ex
citement of the career-best
nights were the always-consis
tent seniors Brad Lawson and
Erik Shoji. Lawson finished with
a solid 15 kills, five digs and an
ace while Shoji had 10 digs.
Saturday proved to be just as
exciting for this improving Stan
ford squad, which outlasted the
Cougars in a marathon first set
before holding them off in the
final two. The Cardinal once
more featured a balanced attack
that resulted in four players fin
ishing with double-digit kills:
Lawson (14), Irvin (12), sopho
more Eric Mochalski (11) and

Cook (10). Stanford was once
more extremely efficient on the
attack, hitting .337 as a team be
hind 47 assists from Barry.
Despite missing sophomore
outside hitter Taylor Sander
the Cougars' leading hitter this
season with nearly five kills per
set BYU did not go down
without a fight. The first set fea
tured an unusually high point
total (68) and saw the two teams
fight off a combined 10 set
points, including seven by BYU.
Stanford was finally able to fin
ish off the Cougars thanks to a
combined block by Lawson and
senior Gus Ellis. The momentum
of winning the first set carried
the Cardinal through the second
and third sets.
"Our bench had so much en
ergy, it was amazing," Mochalski
said. "You could hear them over
4,000-plus fans. Unreal."
Was playing the No. 1 team in
the country extra motivation for
Stanford?
"Of course," Mochalski said.
"Playing the No. 1 team is one
thing. Playing them on their
home court in front of that many
people is another. It is so easy to
get motivated for a match like

that."
Kosty was slightly more ana
lytical in his assessment.
"We play in such a tough
league, and we understand that
No. 1 could be there for any
where between a week and the
whole season," he said. "BYU is a
very good team, and we knew we
had to play at a really high level
to beat them, especially when
they are at home."
While the results of these two
matches are obviously big for the
Cardinal, Kosty is hoping that
the turnaround actually came
last weekend in the squad's loss
to Penn State.
"The Penn State loss may
have kicked us into gear, allow
ing us to win twice at BYU, espe
cially because not many people
are going to be able to do that
this year," Kosty said. "These two
wins are going to be huge for us
down the stretch."
