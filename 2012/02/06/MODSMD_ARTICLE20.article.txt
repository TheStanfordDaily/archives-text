### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's basketball team entered its Satur
day matchup with the Arizona Wildcats knowing it needed
a win to stay on the bubble for next month's NCAA tour
nament. The Cardinal put up a great fight in front of an en
ergetic home crowd, but ultimately the Wildcats proved to
be too much, pulling away at the end for a 56-43 victory.
Stanford (16-7,6-5 Pac-12) had its worst shooting per
formance of the season, shooting just 25.4 percent from the
field and scoring its fewest points in a home game in over
25 years. Despite the offensive woes, the Cardinal kept the
game close through tremendous defense.The Wildcats (16-
8,7-4) were held to just 38.3 percent shooting and only put
up 56 points, their second-lowest total of the season.
At the start of the game, an Arizona blowout seemed
likely, as the Wildcats stormed to an early lead. However,
down 20-12 with six minutes left in the half, Stanford red
shirt senior forward Josh Owens took over.
The captain recorded a massive block, then got an of
fensive rebound on the other end and converted the
jumper. On the very next possession, Owens blocked an
other shot, which led to a three by freshman guard Chas
son Randle. With the Wildcat's lead down to just three, the
momentum had clearly shifted Stanford's way.
The Cardinal eventually tied the game at 23 and found
itself down only 24-23 at the half. Stanford's attack contin
ued after the break, as sophomore guard Aaron Bright's
incredible dart into the lane for a layup gave the Cardinal
its first lead of the game since the early first half.
The two teams traded buckets until the nine-minute
mark, when an Owens offensive board and putback gave
Stanford a 37-35 lead although it would prove to be the
Cardinal's final lead of the game. At this point, Stanford
began to struggle from the field. The Cardinal did not hit
another field goal until Bright's layup at the 2:36 mark, a
drought that lasted long enough for the Wildcats to grab
the lead for good.
With just two minutes left, the Cardinal was down eight,
and Randle attempted to lead a dramatic comeback. The
freshman had proven himself to be utterly fearless
throughout the game, constantly slashing into the paint
and using his superior speed and acrobatic moves to get to
the rim.
