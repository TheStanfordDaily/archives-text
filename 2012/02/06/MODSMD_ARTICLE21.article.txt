# DUCKS DOMINATED
## EASY WIN OPENS PAC-12 PLAY 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
It may have been just its second
match of the year, but the Stanford
women's tennis team was in midsea
son form against the Oregon Ducks
on Saturday.
The No. 2 Cardinal (2-0, 1-0 Pac
-12) had little trouble dusting off the
Ducks (3-2,0-1) in Eugene, cruising to
a 6-1 victory in its first Pac-12 confer
ence matchup of the season.The Stan
ford victory was punctuated by espe
cially strong performances from
sophomore Nicole Gibbs, junior
Stacey Tan and senior Veronica Li.

The Cardinal won all three dou
bles matches to take the early lead,
and Gibbs, who paired with junior
Mallory Burdette for the doubles

matchup, authored a particularly
dominant 8-1 victory over the Duck
duo of Sofia Hager and Patricia
Skowronski.

Stanford's dominant play carried
over into the singles matchups, as the
Cardinal had little trouble in any of its
first five matches. Tan was the first off
the courts with a 6-0, 6-0 win over
Hager, followed closely by compatri
ot Li, who also recorded a 6-0,6-0 win
over Haley Driver.

Gibbs was next off the courts with
a 6-1,6-0 victory over Julia Metzger in
the number one spot, putting a bow
on the Cardinal victory as early as
possible.

With the win already in tow, fresh
man Ellen Tsay cleaned up a victory
by taking down Trudie DuToit, 6-4,6-
1, followed by Burdette, who man
aged her second victory of the day
against Skowronski, 6-3,6-3. The only
blemish on the Cardinal's score came
from junior Natalie Dillon, who split
the first two sets, 6-3, 3-6, before

falling 10-8 in a third set tiebreaker.
After hitting the road to Eugene
for its first conference matchup, the
Cardinal now returns home for five
consecutive matches at the Taube
Family Tennis Center. The biggest
matchup of the five is undoubtedly a
showdown with No. 1 Florida on Sun
day, Feb. 12.
Not only is the match a huge show
down between the top two teams in
the country, but the Cardinal will also
be seeking revenge against the same
Gator team that took home the na
tional championship last season by
beating the Cardinal on its home
court with a 4-3 comeback victory.
But before Stanford gets its show
at revenge on Sunday, the Cardinal
must go through Pepperdine, which
comes to the Farm on Saturday. The
Waves and Cardinal face off on Satur
day at noon.

Senior Veronica Li had a near-perfect trip to Oregon, winning
her singles match 6-0, 6-0 after earning the Cardinal's first
doubles win alongside sophomore Kristie Ahn.
