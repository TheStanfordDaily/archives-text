# RUDE AWAKENING AT TAUBE
## TROJANS, BRUINS THRASH CARDINAL 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team
suffered its first losses of the young
dual-match season this past weekend
as Stanford was clobbered by visiting
No. 1 USC and No. 9 UCLA. The two
losses 7-0 against USC on Friday
and 6-1 against UCLA on Saturday
were Stanford's most lopsided de
feats over the past two years.
Luckily for the No. 6 Cardinal (4-2,
0-0 Pac-12), however, these matches
will not count towards Pac-12 stand
ings; the conference matches will take
place in mid-April at the Southern
California homes of the two rival
schools.

The match against USC started
out badly and then went from bad
to worse. The Trojans, three-time de
fending national champions, locked
up the initial doubles point with ease,
winning eight games to two on courts
one and three. The No. 1-ranked Tro
jans then summarily dismantled their
Cardinal opponent, winning the four
singles matches in straight sets and

clinching the contest before the Car
dinal could even take a single set off
them.

The single bright spot for Stanford
was the final and most exciting
match of the day: a firepower-filled
showdown between USC's Steve
Johnson and Stanford's Ryan
Thacher on the No. 1 court. Johnson,
the No. f ranked player in the coun
try, is the defending NCAA singles
champion and a main rival of Stan
ford senior (and fellow NCAA sin
gles champion) Bradley Klahn, the
man Thacher was filling in for on the
No. 1 court. Thacher, a bona fide top
player in his own right, battled tooth
and nail in a fierce and serve-domi
nated match against Johnson before
ultimately falling in a third-set
tiebreaker.

Saturday afternoon's match
against UCLA proved just as disap
pointing as Friday's. Stanford actually
got off to a fine start in this one, win
ning the doubles point behind strong
play from Thacher and freshman John
Morrissey. But, just like the day before,
the singles play was just not quite good
enough as the Cardinal was defeated
in all six matches.
The match was closer than the lop
sided score would suggest, as four of
the six singles matches went the dis

tance to three sets, but the Cardinal
consistently could not come up big on
the most crucial points.
The season is still very young
and Stanford is playing without its best
player in Klahn but there is surely
little doubt that these two losses hurt
for head coach John Whitlinger's
squad. The Trojans and Bruins will be
two of the teams that Stanford will
have to get through in April's Pac-12
Championships and then in May's
NCAA Championships if the Cardinal
is to realize its annual goals of winning
the conference and national titles.

Though the losses hurt, the Cardi
nal players refuse to let it get them
down.

"We're not going to dwell on the
losses but try and move forward from
them," said sophomore Jamin Ball. "If
anything, we were exposed to some of
the best competition in the country
and realized where we need to get to in
order to compete at the highest level."
The Cardinal will have ample op
portunity to prove its resilience and re
solve immediately as the team has a
match on Tuesday against unranked
Hawaii and another on Saturday
against No. 36 BYU.
