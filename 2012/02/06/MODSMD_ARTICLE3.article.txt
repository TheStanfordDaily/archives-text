## Freshmen to reflect in pilot seminars 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Next week, Stanford leaders will pilot Reflec
tions Seminars, a new initiative offering freshmen
the opportunity to reflect on their lives, identities
and time at Stanford. The project, spearheaded by
the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) and the Vice Provost for Student Affairs
(VPSA), is a collaboration of faculty, administrators
and ASSU leaders.

"The initiative has been something that the dif
ferent administrators in [Undergraduate Advising
and Research] and other departments around the
University have been thinking about for a number
of years," said Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3,
ASSU vice president.

Over the past 18 months, more than three dozen
faculty, staff and students from across the Universi
ty have been in dialogue about the need to create a
"Stanford 101" in order to better help students take
full advantage of all that Stanford offers both aca
demically and in terms of support and resources.
These meetings have been led by Dean of Fresh
man and Undergraduate Advising Julie Lythcott-
Haims 'B9 and Associate Vice Provost for Student
Affairs and Dean of Residential Education Debo
rah Colder, with Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Flarry Elam and Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Greg Boardman also jointly overseeing
the effort.
The committee concluded that a Stanford 101
curriculum should have two com
ponents to it, which Lythcott-
Haims described as "Reflection"
and "Navigation." Newly formed
task forces composed of faculty,
staff and students are currently ex
ploring programming for these
two components.

"Each task force will run a
process of prototype and iteration
which will last two to three quar
ters," Lythcott-Haims said. "By
Jan. 2013, we hope to have a clear
sense of how to integrate these
concepts of 'Reflection' and 'Nav
igation' into the undergraduate
experience for offering in the
2013-14 school year."
Lythcott-Haims said that the
"Reflection" idea originated from
the notion that students should
have the chance to pause and re
flect upon big questions: "Who am
I?" "What are my ideals and
dreams?" "What is important to
me?" "How am I going to spend
my time?" "What do I want to do
with my life?"
Students will be encouraged to
think about how to integrate their
answers to those questions with
the myriad of opportunities of
fered by a Stanford education.
"Students will be encouraged to
think further about their Stanford
experience, not just the four years
they have on campus, but also the
years afterward," Macgregor-Den
nis said. "It's to reflect on their cur
rent involvement on campus, not to
add more on their plate."
"The goal would be that stu
dents would end up having a clear
er sense of self as they make their
way through their undergraduate
experience and would more inten
tionally and more thoughtfully
make choices about course selec
tion, major declaration and the
types of activities they pursue here
as a result," Lythcott-Haims said.

This winter's Stanford Reflec
tions Seminar is only open to cur
rent freshmen. At the moment, 75
freshmen have signed up to be
placed into small groups, each of
which will be led by two people
from either the faculty or adminis
tration and one upperclassman
mentor. Each student group will
consist of approximately eight to
12 students and will host three 90-
minute sessions over the course of
the quarter. The small group expe
rience was designed to foster trust
and community and to benefit stu
dents' mental health and wellness.

Involved faculty members
hope to continue to test the pro
gram to see whether or not sopho
mores would benefit from the ex
perience as well.

"Our counterparts at Harvard
have been running a program like
this for three to four years, and we
are excited to compare notes with
them once our pilot gets under
way," Lythcott-Haims said.
The later "Navigation" piece of
the project stems from one of the
major concerns that was brought
up over the committee meetings
namely that students often
don't seem to know about or know
how to utilize the numerous re
sources that already exist on our
campus, she said.
According to Lythcott-Haims,
"Navigation" will likely be a 10-
week course attempting to demys
tify the University's structure and
introduce students to some of its
key resources, opportunities and
support. The program will include
teaching students how to find
good places to study, manage time
effectively, take advantage of fac
ulty office hours, gain awareness of
mental health and wellness re
sources, get involved in research,
write a resume and cover letter,
get advice from upperclassmen
and use Axess, Course√üank and
Explore Courses.

Courses of this sort are current
ly offered to different degrees at
the University, such as through
UAR's Expanded Advising Pro
gram, with partners in the commu
nity centers and in athletics, and
through a student-initiated course
on "Navigating the University,"
taught by Maya Amoils 'l2 and
Alex Wittenberg 'l2 this fall. A
course taught by former Arroyo
Resident Fellow Todd Davies to
his freshmen last spring also ad
dressed the topic.
The job of the Navigation Task
Force will be to design a 10-week
curriculum drawing upon the best
that is already offered, in order to
scale current offerings up to hun
dreds of students, Lythcott-Haims
said.

"While it is too soon to draw
conclusions, our hope is that both
the 'Reflections' and 'Navigation'
pieces will prove to be exciting
new offerings on the Stanford un
dergraduate landscape. We envi
sion that they will be voluntary
and perhaps credit-bearing," Lyth
cott-Haims said.

"I've been blown away by all
the faculty and how much care and
effort they've put into the pro
gram," Macgregor-Dennis said.
"The work of the administrators
and faculty members who I've
seen working to put on the Stan
ford Reflection project makes me
proud to be working with them.
They have total commitment for
making this a breakthrough proj
ect and I'm really excited to see
their efforts come to realization."
