# Stanford apps outpace Ivy rivals
## Harvard, Yale applications drop, Farm experiences record numbers 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford set a University record
when it received 36,744 applica
tions before the Jan. 1 deadline this
year, while Harvard, Yale and
Princeton all experienced a slight
dip in applications compared to the
previous year.
Stanford's Class of 2016 admis
sions pool represents a seven per
cent increase from the 34,348 ap
plications for the Class of 2015.
"You know, I expected this year
actually that [the number of appli
cants] might hit a ceiling, and it did
n't," Dean of Undergraduate Ad
mission and Financial Aid Richard
Shaw said. "It kept moving up and .
.. I think that's a compliment to
the university."
When asked why he thought
Stanford continued to see more ap
plications this year than ever, Shaw
pointed to the University's five
Rhodes Scholars of 32 total
for 2012.

"That's not bad in one year," he
said.

Additionally, Shaw attributed
some of Stanford's popularity to
the ease of the Common Applica
tion, national news articles and
even the success of Stanford's foot
ball and women's soccer teams.

Shaw noted he expects to even
tually see a plateau in the size of
Stanford's applicant pool given
the national high school demo
graphics.

"But right now, the trend is up

ward," Shaw said. "It's been up
ward for the last five years or so."

While Stanford received 49
fewer early action applications this
year (5,880) as compared to last
year (5,929), its early admission
rate was still marginally lower than
that of Harvard, Yale or Princeton.
Stanford admitted 12.8 percent of
its early applicants whereas Yale,
Harvard and Princeton accepted
15.7,18.2 and 21.0 percent, respec
tively. Both Harvard and Prince
ton reinstated their restrictive
early action programs this past
year after a four-year hiatus.
"We expected they'd impact us,
but they didn't. They may be shar
ing common candidates in the
Northeast. They probably are shar
ing them with us, but we have other
people interested, so ... we went
up more precipitously than they
did in terms of applications," Shaw
said.

"In our case, Princeton and Har
vard joining Yale in our restrictive
early action to me, that creates
even a level of greater sanity," he
added. "Young people applying
early to those programs should be
doing so because it's their first
choice or close to it, and they get
out of the applicant pools of every
body else."
Indeed, Harvard saw a record
amount of applications for the
Class of 2015 last year, reaching
34,950 interested students, and re
ceived fewer applications this year,
even after reinstating its early ac
tion program. Of the 34,285 ap
plications submitted by the regu
lar decision deadline, only the
772 students who were accepted
early action have been guaran
teed their spot in the Class of
2016, potentially drawing them
out of the applicant pool for
other elite universities.
Princeton released statistics
confirming the same trend as
Harvard. Last year, Princeton re
ceived 27,189 applications for the
Class of 2015, as compared to
26,663 applications this year for
the Class of 2016. While this ap
plicant pool is still the second
largest in the school's history, the
increase may be reflective of
Princeton's 2005 initiative to
swell its student body from 4,700
to 5,200. On Dec. 15,2011, Prince
ton accepted the first 726 stu
dents into its Class of 2016.

"When we were by ourselves
in the restrictive program, and
Princeton and Harvard were out,
their candidates might have ap
plied to us, and then they would
apply to them later and have to
wait until the spring. But we'd lose
some of those kids. We'd also
gained some [from early pro
grams] and [Princeton and Har
vard] knew that," Shaw said, re
flecting on the effect Ivy League
admissions might have on Stan
ford's yield. "But I think [the early

program] distributes the students
if these are the institutions they're
interested in. If it takes them out
of the pool, and they're not col
lecting trophies of admissions,
then that's a good thing."
The reinstitution of early pro
grams might mean that there is
more space for other applicants
after several "trophy-collectors"
are taken out of the pool by an
acceptance from their top choice
school, Shaw said.
With application numbers in
creasing and additional students
vying for a place in the Stanford
student body, Shaw encouraged
high school seniors to take their
applications seriously by making
sure that they can be competitive
among the rest of the applicant
pool.

"Students should really be
clear about and know that they
are competitive for a place in the
class," Shaw said. "They should
pay attention in all these institu
tions in terms 0f... the competi
tive characteristics of those
places, the grade point averages,
and pay attention to what they
read in their applications, the ap
plication instructions and so
forth."

Despite his warning, Shaw
does not discourage interested
applicants from applying to Stan
ford.

"We're really excited about
the fact that there's a lot of inter
est," he said. "It's very extraordi
nary. We've been discovered."
