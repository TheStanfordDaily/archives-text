## Police issue more tickets to cut crashes Board of dins tees worried about bicycle crashes, injuries 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Bill Larson, spokesman for the
Stanford Department of Public
Safety (SUDPS), confirmed that
the Stanford police department has
recently increased its efforts re
garding bicycle safety and educa
tion in an effort to reduce the num
ber of collisions on campus.
Larson noted, however, that
"bike enforcement is [an ongoing]
part of our education of the Stan
ford community to obey traffic
laws," and that enforcement efforts
periodically increase throughout
the year, especially during times
such as New Student Orientation
(NSO).
SUDPS Chief Laura Wilson
said an in email to The Daily that
the increased patrols by Stanford
sheriffs are in response to concerns
raised by, among others, members
of the Board of Trustees and the
University Cabinet. According to
Wilson, education-based bike safe
ty programs had previously failed
to change the actual behavior of
bikers around campus.
Enforcement has increased
around the intersections of Campus
Drive and Escondido Road, Lomi
ta Drive and Santa Teresa Street
and Serra Street and Galvez Street.
Larson emphasized that the in
creased time spent on bicycle safety
has not necessitated redeployment
of deputies from other tasks a
particularly salient point following
two assaults reported on campus
this past weekend.
Larson said that enforcement
efforts have been predominantly
situated in response to observa
tions and complaints from the com
munity.

While cycling violations, the
most common of which are stop
sign infringements, can be penalized
by fines ranging from $lOO to $2OO,
students are often offered a choice
between paying a monetary fine
and attending a bike "diversion"
program intended to educate stu
dents about bike safety.

"We have always enforced cy
cling laws on campus," said Deputy
Allen James, the program's coordi
nator and developer. "We hope that
by enforcing the laws and educat
ing the community, we can change
the whole bicycling environment."
The hour-long class, which is of
fered twice a month, is a collabora
tion between the SUDPS and Park
ing & Transportation and was cre
ated in 2011. The program is free
and open to all students, but repeat
offenders are barred from attend
ing the class again within 18
months.
John Burke 'l4 was at the most
recent class in the Parking and
Transportation building, along with

about 50 other students.
"They talked a bunch about var
ious rules involving lane changes
and what to do at intersections,"
said Burke, who received a ticket
for not having a bike light. The in
structor "told a couple stories of
bad accidents he'd seen, and told us
it's not that uncommon to have
bike accidents and get hurt in
them."
Burke noted that the class didn't
teach him anything new, however it
did serve to remind him that biking
is not as safe as students sometimes
think it is.

"The bike diversion program of
fers an opportunity," James said, "to
change a punitive endeavor into an

educational situation."
James noted that a significant
majority of students cited on cam
pus choose to attend the class rather
than pay a fine. He added that, while
there is no data to suggest conclu
sively that ticketing levels have fall
en, feedback for the program has
been almost entirely positive,
"The program's been very suc
cessful for the University," James
said. "It's good for our community,
and we're very proud of it."
