## Lobbyists disclose 2011 expenditures 
### JOSEE SMITH 
Stanford University spent $420,000 on
lobbying in 2011, according to the quarterly
lobbying reports filed by Larry Horton '62
M.A. '66, director of government and com
munity relations at Stanford.
In comparison, the University of South
ern California reported spending $580,000
last year lobbying the local, state and federal
government. According to the Center for
Responsive Politics, the University of Cali
fornia system spent $770,000 last year on lob
bying.
Horton is one of two registered lobbyists
for Stanford, along with Ryan Adesnik. Ac
cording to Horton, he and Adesnik lobby the
federal government on behalf of Stanford's
interests.

"All the things we work on are all the
things that Stanford University as an institu
tion has an interest in and is qualified to
speak on," Horton said, adding that he and
Adesnik do not lobby on individual projects.
Instead, Horton said, he and Adesnik
lobby on issues such as education, intellectu
al property and federally sponsored re
search. In the case of federally sponsored re
search, Stanford representatives lobby to en
sure that there is adequate funding for Uni
versity research.
According to the quarterly reports, Stan
ford also lobbied on issues such as student fi
nancial aid, immigration and stem cell re
search. These lobbying reports record both
the expenses related to lobbying and the lob
bying activity. Horton must report what was
lobbied and how the money was spent. Re
porting incorrectly is a criminal offense, he
noted.

When asked how the lobbying expenses
for 2011 compared with previous years, Hor
ton said that the expenses were about the
same.
