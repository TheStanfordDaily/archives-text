## Lobbyists disclose 2011 expenditures 
### JOSEE SMITH 
Stanford University spent $420,000 on
lobbying in 2011, according to the quarterly
lobbying reports filed by Larry Horton '62
M.A. '66, director of government and com
munity relations at Stanford.
In comparison, the University of South
ern California reported spending $580,000
last year lobbying the local, state and federal
government. According to the Center for
Responsive Politics, the University of Cali
fornia system spent $770,000 last year on lob
bying.
Horton is one of two registered lobbyists
for Stanford, along with Ryan Adesnik. Ac
cording to Horton, he and Adesnik lobby the
federal government on behalf of Stanford's
interests.

"All the things we work on are all the
things that Stanford University as an institu
tion has an interest in and is qualified to
speak on," Horton said, adding that he and
Adesnik do not lobby on individual projects.
Instead, Horton said, he and Adesnik
lobby on issues such as education, intellectu
al property and federally sponsored re
search. In the case of federally sponsored re
search, Stanford representatives lobby to en
sure that there is adequate funding for Uni
versity research.
According to the quarterly reports, Stan
ford also lobbied on issues such as student fi
nancial aid, immigration and stem cell re
search. These lobbying reports record both
the expenses related to lobbying and the lob
bying activity. Horton must report what was
lobbied and how the money was spent. Re
porting incorrectly is a criminal offense, he
noted.

When asked how the lobbying expenses
for 2011 compared with previous years, Hor
ton said that the expenses were about the
same.
"We are a very small staff,"
Horton said. "We have five profes
sional people to handle all of Stan
ford's community, state and feder
al relations."

Stanford lobbyists do not have
a Washington, D.C., office, some
thing that many other, bigger
schools, such as the University of
California, Berkeley and the Uni
versity of Michigan, do have.
According to the Political Ac
tivities section of the Administra
tive Guide Memo, approved by
President Hennessy and applica
ble to all members of the Univer
sity community, all members are
"free to express their political
opinions and engage in political
activities to whatever extent they
wish." However, they "must avoid
even the appearance that they are
speaking or acting for the Univer
sity in political matters."

The memo lists the officials
who can lobby on behalf of the
University without specific au
thorization: the President,
Provost, Deans of the Seven
Schools, Vice Provost and Dean of
Research, Vice Provost for Grad
uate Education, Vice President
for Business Affairs and Chief Fi
nancial Officer, Vice President of
Human Resources, Director of
the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory, Director of the
Hoover Institute, General Coun
sel and the Vice President for Pub
lic Affairs.

Any faculty member who
wishes to lobby on behalf of the
University for specific purposes
must be granted permission from
the Vice Provost and Dean of Re
search and Graduate Policy. The
Vice President for Public Affairs
may grant permission to staff
members to lobby on behalf of the
University, and all lobbying on be
half of the University must be co
ordinated with the Vice President
for Public Affairs, according to the
guide memo.
Most of the money recorded in
the quarterly reports is a percent
age of the salary of the person
who did the lobbying and any re
lated expenses, such as travel and
hotel costs.

"From time to time, Stanford

does hire resources from Wash
ington or from Sacramento to
help us," Horton said. "The
amounts we pay for them would
be included in our reports."
According to Horton, Stanford
mostly lobbies on federal govern
ment issues primarily issues
before Congress. Lobbying at the
local or state level involves a dif
ferent type of reporting require
ments. For instance, no one at
Stanford, not even Horton, is a
registered lobbyist in Sacramento
because nobody meets the thresh
old required to be a lobbyist in
Sacramento politics.
"When it comes to local gov
ernment, county government, city
government... there is a differ
ent set of rules," Horton said.
Occasionally Stanford does get
involved in issues in Palo Alto if
they have the potential for a sig
nificant effect on students and fac
ulty at Stanford. For instance,
Stanford takes interest in trans
portation and school board issues
if they involve the interests of the
school.

There is only one restriction on
the kind of lobbying in which
Stanford is allowed to participate:
partisan politics.
"We cannot support a candi
date or partisan activity," Horton
said. He added that Stanford
never takes positions on "popular
interests" of the day, instead fo
cusing on issues that concern the
school. Stanford can permit indi
viduals to speak on campus, but
campaign speeches are off limits,
according to Horton.
The Center for Responsive
Politics reported that Stanford
University individuals con
tributed $595,716 to then-Senator
Barack Obama's campaign in
2008. These contributions did not
come from the school directly; in
stead, they came from individual
members who support a particular
candidate and contribute their
own money to campaigns. This
number was the sum of money
contributed by individual faculty
and students, but not money do
nated on behalf of the school.

"When we take positions, we
take positions on behalf of the
University," Horton said. "We only
involve ourselves on issues that af
fect education and research."

members to lobby on behalf of the
University, and all lobbying on be
half of the University must be co
ordinated with the Vice President
for Public Affairs, according to the
guide memo.
Most of the money recorded in
the quarterly reports is a percent
age of the salary of the person
who did the lobbying and any re
lated expenses, such as travel and
hotel costs.

"From time to time, Stanford

does hire resources from Wash
ington or from Sacramento to
help us," Horton said. "The
amounts we pay for them would
be included in our reports."
According to Horton, Stanford
mostly lobbies on federal govern
ment issues primarily issues
before Congress. Lobbying at the
local or state level involves a dif
ferent type of reporting require
ments. For instance, no one at
Stanford, not even Horton, is a
registered lobbyist in Sacramento
because nobody meets the thresh
old required to be a lobbyist in
Sacramento politics.
"When it comes to local gov
ernment, county government, city
government... there is a differ
ent set of rules," Horton said.
Occasionally Stanford does get
involved in issues in Palo Alto if
they have the potential for a sig
nificant effect on students and fac
ulty at Stanford. For instance,
Stanford takes interest in trans
portation and school board issues
if they involve the interests of the
school.

There is only one restriction on
the kind of lobbying in which
Stanford is allowed to participate:
partisan politics.
"We cannot support a candi
date or partisan activity," Horton
said. He added that Stanford
never takes positions on "popular
interests" of the day, instead fo
cusing on issues that concern the
school. Stanford can permit indi
viduals to speak on campus, but
campaign speeches are off limits,
according to Horton.
The Center for Responsive
Politics reported that Stanford
University individuals con
tributed $595,716 to then-Senator
Barack Obama's campaign in
2008. These contributions did not
come from the school directly; in
stead, they came from individual
members who support a particular
candidate and contribute their
own money to campaigns. This
number was the sum of money
contributed by individual faculty
and students, but not money do
nated on behalf of the school.

"When we take positions, we
take positions on behalf of the
University," Horton said. "We only
involve ourselves on issues that af
fect education and research."

Stanford University spent $420,000 on
lobbying in 2011, according to the quarterly
lobbying reports filed by Larry Horton '62
M.A. '66, director of government and com
munity relations at Stanford.
In comparison, the University of South
ern California reported spending $580,000
last year lobbying the local, state and federal
government. According to the Center for
Responsive Politics, the University of Cali
fornia system spent $770,000 last year on lob
bying.
Horton is one of two registered lobbyists
for Stanford, along with Ryan Adesnik. Ac
cording to Horton, he and Adesnik lobby the
federal government on behalf of Stanford's
interests.

"All the things we work on are all the
things that Stanford University as an institu
tion has an interest in and is qualified to
speak on," Horton said, adding that he and
Adesnik do not lobby on individual projects.
Instead, Horton said, he and Adesnik
lobby on issues such as education, intellectu
al property and federally sponsored re
search. In the case of federally sponsored re
search, Stanford representatives lobby to en
sure that there is adequate funding for Uni
versity research.
According to the quarterly reports, Stan
ford also lobbied on issues such as student fi
nancial aid, immigration and stem cell re
search. These lobbying reports record both
the expenses related to lobbying and the lob
bying activity. Horton must report what was
lobbied and how the money was spent. Re
porting incorrectly is a criminal offense, he
noted.

When asked how the lobbying expenses
for 2011 compared with previous years, Hor
ton said that the expenses were about the
same.
"We are a very small staff,"
Horton said. "We have five profes
sional people to handle all of Stan
ford's community, state and feder
al relations."

Stanford lobbyists do not have
a Washington, D.C., office, some
thing that many other, bigger
schools, such as the University of
California, Berkeley and the Uni
versity of Michigan, do have.
According to the Political Ac
tivities section of the Administra
tive Guide Memo, approved by
President Hennessy and applica
ble to all members of the Univer
sity community, all members are
"free to express their political
opinions and engage in political
activities to whatever extent they
wish." However, they "must avoid
even the appearance that they are
speaking or acting for the Univer
sity in political matters."

The memo lists the officials
who can lobby on behalf of the
University without specific au
thorization: the President,
Provost, Deans of the Seven
Schools, Vice Provost and Dean of
Research, Vice Provost for Grad
uate Education, Vice President
for Business Affairs and Chief Fi
nancial Officer, Vice President of
Human Resources, Director of
the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory, Director of the
Hoover Institute, General Coun
sel and the Vice President for Pub
lic Affairs.

Any faculty member who
wishes to lobby on behalf of the
University for specific purposes
must be granted permission from
the Vice Provost and Dean of Re
search and Graduate Policy. The
Vice President for Public Affairs
may grant permission to staff
members to lobby on behalf of the
University, and all lobbying on be
half of the University must be co
ordinated with the Vice President
for Public Affairs, according to the
guide memo.
