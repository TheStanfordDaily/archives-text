## MAN OF MATHEMATICS 
### JUSTINE ZHANG 
In Stanford's math corner, a
building housing hundreds of
years of mathematical
progress, Professor Kannan
Soundararajan is in his ele
ment. On any given day, his black
board quickly fills with expressions
and equations, detailing material
from the classes he teaches and his
research interests. His bookshelf
displays several groundbreaking
publications by famous mathemati
cians, all members of the great tra
dition of unearthing new mathe
matical insights.
Soundararaj an's track record in
dicates his own role in continuing
this tradition. He recently received
the 2011 Infosys Prize in Mathe
matical Sciences for his work in
proving a significant result called
the Quantum Unique Ergodicity
Conjecture.
Soundararajan's mathematical
inclinations were evident even in
his childhood. In middle school, his
teachers identified his talent for the
subject and put him in touch with a
research institute in the city of
Madras (now Chennai), India.
He employed his mathematical
talent to represent India at the 1991
International Math Olympiad, win
ning a silver medal.
Soundararaj an's teachers en
couraged him throughout high
school to pursue mathematics, and
it was in this environment that his
specific mathematic focus
emerged: analytic number theory.
Analytic number theory is the
study of integers using the tech
niques of calculus and analysis a
field of mathematics pursued by
many of Soundararaj an's mentors.
One of Soundararajan's most influ
ential instructors, Ramachandran
Balasubramanian proved in 1992
that every sufficiently large integer
can be written as the sum of 19
fourth powers.
Soundararaj an's mentorship by
leading mathematicians, combined
with his own affinity for analysis,

steered him toward analytic num
ber theory. According to
Soundararajan, the guiding prob
lem in modern number theory is the
notoriously unresolved Riemann
hypothesis, and much of his mathe
matical effort is devoted toward de
veloping the tools needed to prove
or disprove the hypothesis.
Filling much of Soundararajan's
blackboard, for instance, are L-func
tions, which are closely related to the
key players in the Riemann hypoth
esis. For distilling the characteristics
of these functions, and providing in
sight into how prime numbers are
distributed, Soundararajan received
the 2003 Salem Prize and the 2005
SASTRA Ramanujan Prize.
For the most part, Soundarara
jan describes his mathematical ap
proach as relatively streamlined.
"My own strengths lie in attack
ing the problem itself and develop
ing tools unique to solving the par
ticular problem," he said.
Nevertheless, he characterized
"eureka" moments as the almost
serendipitous instances when two
disparate conjectures connect to
form a proof.
This idea of looking beyond the
immediate scope of a problem to
make incisive connections played a
key role in Soundararajan's most
recent award-winning advance
ment.

To the seasoned academic, the
Quantum Unique Ergodicity Con
jecture might sound like more of a
physics problem. In fact, quantum
ergodicity is a branch of physics that
aims to apply quantum mechanical
laws to the macroscopic scale of
classical mechanics, another fa
mous but unresolved problem.
This conjecture in particular ex
amines how the shape of their en
closures influences waves. In place
of waves, Soundararajan offered
the example of pool balls enclosed
on a frictionless pool table. If a pool

ball is hit in certain directions, it will
bounce in one consistent, limited
path around the pool table. Hitting
it in other directions, however, will
cause the ball to bounce in a more
disorderly manner, covering paths
that span more of the pool table.
While Soundararajan is not a
physicist, he was exposed to this
problem as a graduate student at
Princeton University. The experi
ence eventually caused him to real
ize that a major portion of this idea
could be equated to properties of
shapes derived from L-functions, a
subject squarely in his area of math
ematical expertise. With Roman
Holowinsky of the University of

Toronto, he was able to prove that
for a large class of enclosure shapes,
the "pool ball" never gets stuck in
one track, and its path evenly spans
the area of the "pool table."
In an email to The Daily,
Soundararajan noted the surprising
nature of this melding of physics
and abstract mathematics.

"The connection with quantum
chaos is a feature that has made this
problem attractive to many peo
ple," he said. "It's a little unusual to
find such a connection which has
genuine interest for people work
ing in very different areas."
The groundbreaking nature of
such results runs parallel to his con

tinued enjoyment of the mathemat
ical process. Soundararajan's cru
cial and counterintuitive realization
that the Quantum Unique Ergodic
ity Conjecture could be reformulat
ed to a problem involving L-func
tions exemplifies his favorite aspect
of mathematics.

"In working on math problems,
often one starts out in the dark,"
Soundararajan said. "For me, the
most fun is when there is a key piece
to be found, and once one finds the
rest, the proof falls easily into
place."

Kannan Soundararajan won the 2011 Infosys Prize in Mathematical Sciences for his groundbreaking work.
In Stanford's math corner, a
building housing hundreds of
years of mathematical
progress, Professor Kannan
Soundararajan is in his ele
ment. On any given day, his black
board quickly fills with expressions
and equations, detailing material
from the classes he teaches and his
research interests. His bookshelf
displays several groundbreaking
publications by famous mathemati
cians, all members of the great tra
dition of unearthing new mathe
matical insights.
Soundararaj an's track record in
dicates his own role in continuing
this tradition. He recently received
the 2011 Infosys Prize in Mathe
matical Sciences for his work in
proving a significant result called
the Quantum Unique Ergodicity
Conjecture.
Soundararajan's mathematical
inclinations were evident even in
his childhood. In middle school, his
teachers identified his talent for the
subject and put him in touch with a
research institute in the city of
Madras (now Chennai), India.
He employed his mathematical
talent to represent India at the 1991
International Math Olympiad, win
ning a silver medal.
Soundararaj an's teachers en
couraged him throughout high
school to pursue mathematics, and
it was in this environment that his
specific mathematic focus
emerged: analytic number theory.
Analytic number theory is the
study of integers using the tech
niques of calculus and analysis a
field of mathematics pursued by
many of Soundararaj an's mentors.
One of Soundararajan's most influ
ential instructors, Ramachandran
Balasubramanian proved in 1992
that every sufficiently large integer
can be written as the sum of 19
fourth powers.
Soundararaj an's mentorship by
leading mathematicians, combined
with his own affinity for analysis,

steered him toward analytic num
ber theory. According to
Soundararajan, the guiding prob
lem in modern number theory is the
notoriously unresolved Riemann
hypothesis, and much of his mathe
matical effort is devoted toward de
veloping the tools needed to prove
or disprove the hypothesis.
Filling much of Soundararajan's
blackboard, for instance, are L-func
tions, which are closely related to the
key players in the Riemann hypoth
esis. For distilling the characteristics
of these functions, and providing in
sight into how prime numbers are
distributed, Soundararajan received
the 2003 Salem Prize and the 2005
SASTRA Ramanujan Prize.
For the most part, Soundarara
jan describes his mathematical ap
proach as relatively streamlined.
"My own strengths lie in attack
ing the problem itself and develop
ing tools unique to solving the par
ticular problem," he said.
Nevertheless, he characterized
"eureka" moments as the almost
serendipitous instances when two
disparate conjectures connect to
form a proof.
This idea of looking beyond the
immediate scope of a problem to
make incisive connections played a
key role in Soundararajan's most
recent award-winning advance
ment.

To the seasoned academic, the
Quantum Unique Ergodicity Con
jecture might sound like more of a
physics problem. In fact, quantum
ergodicity is a branch of physics that
aims to apply quantum mechanical
laws to the macroscopic scale of
classical mechanics, another fa
mous but unresolved problem.
This conjecture in particular ex
amines how the shape of their en
closures influences waves. In place
of waves, Soundararajan offered
the example of pool balls enclosed
on a frictionless pool table. If a pool

ball is hit in certain directions, it will
bounce in one consistent, limited
path around the pool table. Hitting
it in other directions, however, will
cause the ball to bounce in a more
disorderly manner, covering paths
that span more of the pool table.
While Soundararajan is not a
physicist, he was exposed to this
problem as a graduate student at
Princeton University. The experi
ence eventually caused him to real
ize that a major portion of this idea
could be equated to properties of
shapes derived from L-functions, a
subject squarely in his area of math
ematical expertise. With Roman
Holowinsky of the University of

Toronto, he was able to prove that
for a large class of enclosure shapes,
the "pool ball" never gets stuck in
one track, and its path evenly spans
the area of the "pool table."
In an email to The Daily,
Soundararajan noted the surprising
nature of this melding of physics
and abstract mathematics.

"The connection with quantum
chaos is a feature that has made this
problem attractive to many peo
ple," he said. "It's a little unusual to
find such a connection which has
genuine interest for people work
ing in very different areas."
