## DIGGING UP HISTORY 
### ARUSHIJAIN 
Before Allen Ginsberg's famous
"Howl" became the archetypal
poem of the Beat Generation, it
first went through multiple revi
sions. The original manuscript
containing Ginsberg's handwritten revi
sions is part of the extensive collection of
Ginsberg's correspondence, notebooks,
journals,photographs and videos housed in
Stanford Archive's Special Collections.
The Ginsberg collection is only one of
the many resources available in the Stan
ford Archives, whose vast historical records
offer new opportunities for students. The
Archives consist of three main collecting
areas: official administrative records of the
University, faculty papers and materials
documenting the Stanford family.
" [The archives] are very broad and have
a variety of formats," Stanford University
Archivist Daniel Hartwig said. "Currently,
we have over 30,000 linear feet of material
and dozens of terabytes of electronic
records."

Last year, at least three award-winning
honors theses were based on topics cen
tered on research from the archives. Dono
van Ervin 'll, who graduated last June, was
awarded the Robert M. Golden Medal
for Excellence for his thesis "We Shall
Overcome: The Anti-Apartheid Move
ment and Its Effects on the Stanford
Community." Ervin focused on how the
anti-apartheid movement was used on
campus to fight injustice in South Africa
and as away for black students at Stan
ford to gain a political voice.
"I had another project that I had start
ed working on as a junior, but it didn't
work out since it was too difficult to get
primary source documents," Ervin said.
"For this one, I knew that all the primary
source documents I needed would be
right here on campus."

Ervin's research relied on materials
from the archives, including personal in
terviews with alumni and professors, old
newspaper articles, flyers from school ral
lies, papers written by past activists and
articles from The San Francisco Chroni
cle and The Stanford Daily.
"The archives gave me the foundation

to create a story," Ervin said. "This al
lowed me to go into deeper analysis of
what I was eventually finding in my re
search."
Ryan Mac 'll, a former Daily editor,
wrote "The Long History of ROTC at
Stanford: From Precursors to the Present,"
focusing on the history of the Reserve Of
ficer Training Corps and the reasons it left
campus during the Vietnam Era. To devel
op his thesis, Mac used the Special Collec
tions, several old records, original docu
ments, primary sources and ROTC files
dating back to the establishment of the
Special Collections in the 1890s.
"The reason why I agreed to do this the
sis is, unlike a topic you have to travel to, all
I had to do was go over to Special Collec
tions and walk back to my dorm," Mac said.
Like Ervin and Mac, Hartwig spoke of
the popularity of the archives among stu
dents in finding materials for the arts,
drama, dance, publishing, exhibitions and
audio and video collections. Trends in stu
dent work vary from interest in the wars,
women's rights and minority issues dur
ing the '6os and '7os to the growth of the
University during the '4os and 'sos. Stu
dents frequently address these topics in
research, Ph.D. dissertations and senior
honors theses.
Hava Mirell 'l2 first used the archives
to write a 25-page research paper for a
class on the history of women at Stanford
and its implications for the campus. Mirell
began by looking through diaries, letters
and albums.

"One day, one really helpful archivist
told me about the card-filing system,
which is way better than anything online,"
Mirell said. "You look up "w" for women,
and it has a card for every article pub
lished by women or for coeducation at
Stanford, showing students' opinions and
giving a dialogue from that."
From there, Mirell's research expand
ed to include presidents' reports and bul
letins of courses made specifically for
women. For the past two months, Mirell
said she has spent an average of three to
four hours at the archives three days a
week.
"Archival research adds a lot of color
to whatever paper you are doing," Mirell
said. "It is very valuable to incorporate

actual pictures, cartoons and quotations.
The language is so rich, and this [re
search] gives you more respect and au
thority as a writer."
While writing her paper, Mirell is also
working on her senior honors thesis on
conflict diamonds in Zimbabwe.

"The problem is, I can't travel there to
collect primary resources, so I am mostly
depending on secondary information,"
Mirell said. "It is less exciting because you
don't really hear the people's voices, un
like when I am sitting here reading this
diary and knowing that this is a woman
who was here 100 years before me. Get
ting to see what women like me had to
overcome is personally gratifying."
With the increasing amount of stu
dents using the collections for research,
the archivists continue to expand the
availability and accessibility of the
archives. According to Hartwig, almost 90
percent of the materials is searchable
through Google, and aids and guides are
available online. Several audio, video and
oral histories have been digitized as well.
However, the archives offer something

digital versions cannot.
"Knowing that the exact same things

that I am touching in my hands were actu
al articles of history makes it tangible,"
Ervin said. "There is a certain level of au
thenticity that makes it easier to relate to
and less abstract."

Both Mac and Mirell agreed, noting
the differences between viewing docu
ments in person and on a screen.
"On Google, I found a digitized Stan
ford review, and it wasn't the same expe
rience as in the archives because you are
just scrolling instead of looking at every
page," Mirell said. "Even with advertise
ments that are online, you are prone to
skip over it, but when you see it in a book,
you think about what it is saying about
the culture of women."

In the case of material that can only be
found in the archives, the information is
unique to Stanford.
"The archives are the most incredibly
helpful and underutilized resources on
campus," Mirell said. "The archivists
themselves go above and beyond to an
swer any question you may have. They are
just the best."
