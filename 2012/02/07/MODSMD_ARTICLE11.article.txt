# COUPA, COFFEE AND COMMUNITY
## 
### JAMES LANCASTER 
On a Monday morning at
the Coupa Cafe outside
of Green Library, loyal
regulars wait in line for
carefully crafted lattes
and cappuccinos. The aroma of fresh
ly prepared Venezuelan dishes and
the sound of lively Latin music en
sconce passersby. Baristas attend to
the hissing espresso machine, trying
to keep up with the seemingly endless
queue of drink orders from sleepy pa
trons seeking a morning boost.
Known for its bold coffee and espres
so drinks as well as its affordable
and authentic Venezuelan fare
Coupa Cafe has become an integral
part of the Stanford community in its
four years on campus.
Jean Paul Coupal 'O7, who graduat
ed from Stanford with a degree in eco
nomics, opened the first Coupa Cafe in
Palo Alto in 2004 with his mother
Nancy Coupal. Coupal's initial philoso
phy behind Coupa was simple: to pro
vide fresh, high-quality and affordable
coffee.
"The idea is to get great coffee di
rectly from the source to you," Coupal
said. "We purchase the highest quality
beans from farmers in Venezuela and
then brew and ship them out to Califor
nia next-day air."
In addition to its bold, fresh coffee,
Coupa Cafe is also known for its exten
sive menu, which includes dishes such
as authentic Venezuelan arepas, sweet
and savory crepes and paninis featuring
local ingredients served on freshly
baked organic wheat breads.
"We want Coupa to be a place
where you can go and not only get a
great cup of coffee, but also get a great
meal," Coupal said. "I think that having
both high quality coffee and food has
really allowed us to be successful at
Stanford."
Coupa Cafe's success on campus
began with its opening in the Yang and
Yamazaki Environment and Energy
(Y2E2) building in 2008. Upon open
ing, Coupa Y2E2 quickly became a fa

vorite spot for students and professors.
In 2010, Green Library also awarded
Coupa Cafe a lease to replace Moon-
Bean's Coffee, which had occupied the
neighboring kiosk for 10 years. Coupal
said that he largely drew from his own
experiences at Stanford in drafting a
proposal for a Coupa location at Green
Library.
"I was an undergrad here, so I really
understand the value of having a Coupa
right at Green Library," Coupal said.
In 2011, Coupa Cafe further ex
panded to the Graduate School of Busi
ness and opened an "express" branch at
the Huang Engineering Center. The ex
pansion of Coupa at Stanford, Coupal
describes, can be attributed to its pro
gressive and innovative mindset.
"We constantly aim to improve our

product, and I think that's why people
have responded to Coupa so favor
ably," Coupal said. "I want people to re
ally recognize Coupa for its quality."
Coupal also noted how his experi
ences as a Stanford student have been
an immense help in his ventures as a
restaurateur.
"Economics definitely gave me a
specific mindset for solving problems,"
Coupal said. "A lot of the questions and
decisions I face are modeled by the
skills I learned in econ classes."
Though he graduated in 2007,
Coupal continues to remain active in
the Stanford community and often pro
vides advice to students who are form
ing their own startups. Coupa Cafe has
served as a testing ground for several
restaurant-related startups.

"Many entrepreneurs create a prod
uct, and they can get a lot of exposure at
Coupa," Coupal said. "Whether it's a
survey or loyalty or communication
tool, I like to give tips and advice given
my own experiences starting Coupa."
Coupal's interactions with the Stan
ford community have largely shaped
the growth of Coupa Cafe, and Coupal
sees a continued dialogue with Coupa's
patrons as the key to its future growth
and success.
"Coupa was really born out of Stan
ford," Coupal said. "We can always be
improving, and we will continue to turn
to the Stanford community to better
our product."
