## FROM FARM TO FORK Creating a food movement at Stanford 
### Jenny Rempel 
Welcome to the burgeon
ing local food movement.
By local, I do not mean
the Bay Area, nor even the Stan
ford campus, but a certain bed
room in Synergy Cooperative
House. In preparation for a recent
room warming, my roommates
and I took a trip to Common
Ground, a nearby garden supply
store. We picked up potting soil,
lavender, chamomile, mint and
thyme, and now the most exciting
part of our room is a set of planter
boxes hanging outside our third
floor windows.
It was a pretty simple act and
relatively inexpensive, too. Since
they're already outside in the sun
shine, all the plants need is a little
water. I like to think of our win
dow boxes as a romantic state
ment in favor of local food. They
emphasize my belief that, because
of our campus culture of innova
tion, Stanford students are
uniquely situated to begin advo
cating for more just and sustain
able food practices.
It's useful to step back from
Stanford for a moment and re
member the state of our national
food systems. Several author-ac
tivists, including Michael Pollan
and Eric Schlosser, have detailed
the problems associated with food
and farming in America; these
range from conventional agricul
ture's obsessive reliance on fossil
fuels to ongoing inequalities in ac
cess to nutritious, affordable, cul
turally appropriate food. The sys
temic nature of these challenges
and disparities demands action at
many different levels, spanning
the extremely personal to the
global.
Silicon Valley encourages a
culture of innovation and rapid
prototyping at Stanford, and
these startup staples can be useful
tools for improving our broken
food systems. For example, a win
ter quarter class in the Institute of
Design at Stanford (d.school),
Designing for Sustainable Abun
dance, embraces the type of ex
perimental design thinking that
considers not only the environ
mental implications of our food
choices, but also their power to af
fect our physical and emotional
wellbeing. Last year, students in
the course established a novel
collaboration between the
d.school, Stanford Dining and the
Stanford Prevention Research
Center to ideate, prototype and
implement strategies to reduce
meat consumption in dining halls.
This research highlights another
carefully cultivated Stanford
characteristic: collaboration.
The problems in our food sys
tems are multifaceted, ranging
from the biophysical to the socio
cultural, but food activists often
neglect to collaborate or even rec
ognize the deeper issues of pover
ty, race, access and power that
allow hunger and food inequali
ties to persist in America. To ad
dress these problems, we need

multi-level solutions that recog
nize the economic, environmental
and social justice framework in
which food activism is situated.
Stanford faculty and students are
beginning to do this through an
emphasis on interdisciplinary ap
proaches to change.
This past fall, Stanford hosted
its second annual Food Summit,
which was attended by over 400
scholars and activists. These sum
mits, spearheaded by Dr. Christo
pher Gardner of the Stanford
Medical School, brought together
individuals from each of Stan
ford's seven different schools.
They even featured undergradu
ates, such as Janani Balasubra
manian 'l2, who established a new
ASSU Food Cabinet this year.
Both Balasubramanian and
Gardner are working to garner in
stitutional support for the food
movement at Stanford. There are
already many indications of this
institutional momentum toward
establishing a curriculum and cul
ture around food at Stanford
row house and dining hall gardens,
a dedicated Farm Manager de
signing a new on-campus educa
tion farm, a Sustainable Food Pro
gram Manager working to bring
more real food to the dining halls
and even the newly-formed Stan
ford Intuitive Eating Group.
The opportunities for student
engagement in this movement are
countless. There are farm work
days, gleaning groups, nutrition
education programs in East Palo
Alto, cooking workshops and a
whole host of student groups from
the Stanford Farm Project to the
Stanford Project for Hunger. With
Chez Panisse and the People's
Grocery just across the Bay, Stan
ford is in the hub of the sustainable
food movement, and because of
the University's dedication to col
laboration and innovative, inter
disciplinary solutions, Stanford
students are uniquely empowered
to achieve change. It could be as
simple as planting some thyme
outside your dorm room.
