The case for an ice
arena on campus

Dear Editor,
As an alumnus and prime
mover behind the development of
an independent non-profit skat
ing facility in my current home
state of Maine (with both indoor
and outdoor refrigerated sur
faces), I enthusiastically support
the construction of an ice rink on
the Stanford campus ("Ice rink
proposal advances," Jan. 17).
One early lesson in creating
the Family Ice Center was that ice
arenas need not be, nor should be,
all about hockey. Ice and the
many activities it supports offer a
unique recreational experience,
even more so in a California set
ting. It is also a great way to beat
the heat.
In addition to providing a
home for Stanford hockey teams
(women and men), a rink could
offer figure skating (singles, pairs
and synchronized teams), learn to
skate classes, short track speed
skating, public skates, intra-mural
broom ball and coed hockey, and
even curling.
An on-campus skating facility
could also provide a valuable in
terface with the community by
hosting youth programs managed
by Stanford students (and facul
ty), as well as an out-reach to local
organizations that service disad

vantaged and disabled youth. At
Family Ice, Opportunity Skate of
fers free ice and skates (even
hockey equipment) to a variety of
non-profits and helps to coordi
nate volunteers yet another
chance for Stanford undergrads
to get involved.
An intriguing opportunity for
the University, from both an envi
ronmental and recreational
standpoint, would be to combine
the rink with a pool. This may be a
more practical and valuable op
tion than the two sheets of ice that
have been proposed. The waste
heat from the compressors that
refrigerate the ice surface can be
captured not only to dehumidify
the air in the rink but also to heat
the pool water, saving significant
ly on carbon-based fuel. With the
absence of Lake Lagunita, a pool
on the West Campus committed
to recreational use (and intra
mural sports) would be a tremen
dous asset for the student body
and greater college community.
In the idyllic landscape of Stan
ford, with its Ã¼biquitous palm and
eucalyptus trees, the last thing you
would expect to find is a sheet of
indoor ice. But that is exactly the
point. Imagine the impact and im
pression an ice rink could have on
the University's diverse student
population, many of whom have
never strapped on a pair of skates.
