# HALF INVENTED
## An introduction (to your new best friend!) 
### Chase Ishii 
Why hello there, Tuesday
Reader! Fancy meeting
you here.

Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Chase Ishii, and for the
next four months, I will be your
new best friend. (If you are reading
this next to your current best
friend, don't worry. Just breathe
slowly and act natural, and they
won't have a clue. Unless, of course,
they are reading this with you, in
which case,you have been replaced
as well, so everything is fine.)
Some of you may know me as
"the Thursday Poop Newspaper
Guy" from last volume (which is
actually one of the better nick
names I've received. Much better
than Squishy Ishii... I immediate
ly regret putting that in print.) But
with a new volume and a new day
comes a new theme. This column
will not be a traditional Opinions
column, but you will forgive me for
it (because that's what best friends
do.)

I will not be addressing contro
versial topics, such as politics, the
economy or whether or not the E!
Channel is ruining America's rep
utation more than any act of for
eign intervention ever could. (It is.)
The older I get, the more I real
ize how gray black-and-white is
sues really are and how important
it is to hear all sides (especially the
minority) before taking a firm
stance. (So, if I ever do write an
overly political column, it probably
means I have been kidnapped by
the North Koreans and am writing
at gunpoint. Rather than assessing
the persuasiveness and rhetorical
strength of my argument, you
should write a letter to your con
gressman petitioning for my re
lease.)
Ivan Illich, an Australian
philosopher, wrote, "Neither revo
lution nor reformation can ulti
mately change a society, rather you
must tell a new powerful tale, one
so persuasive that it sweeps away
the old myths and becomes the
preferred story, one so inclusive
that it gathers all the bits of our
past and our present into a coher
ent whole, one that even shines
some light into our future so that
we can take the next step ... If you
want to change a society, then you

have to tell an alternative story."

This column will be about
telling that alternative story. I be
lieve that with everything we do
our actions, our conversations, our
attitudes and our relationships
we are all telling a story to the rest
of the world about who we are,
what we believe and what we
value. It is not a question of if we
are telling a story, but what kind of
story we are telling. Is it exciting?
Does it have twists and tensions? Is
there a happy ending? Is my story
worth reading?
And what better way to talk is
sues of identity, belief and worth
than through stories and art? Self
awareness is the goal. We can an
swer the "who?" and "why?" and
"how?" and "what next?" ques
tions much better if we bring the
same level of analysis to our own
lives that we bring to stories and
artistic endeavors. I hope that the
honesty and vulnerability in this
column will allow for a dialogue, a
response in addition to an opinion,
on the more abstract and more
personal aspects of life, the kind of
things you really only share with a
best friend.

In maintaining the dialogue, I
invite, encourage and beg you to
use your voice. If you have opin
ions or questions about my views,
email me. If you want to know why
I don't drink or how I can be "intel
lectual" and still a Christian, or if
you want a 15-page single-spaced

explanation of why the Angels are
the greatest baseball team in the
MLB, email me. If you have your
own story you want to share that
you think can change (or shift) so
ciety, email me. This column is a
platform, and your voice in the
conversation is the difference be
tween "talking at" and "talking to"
the Stanford community. And I'm
all ears.
Half-Invented refers to the
way we experience the world.
Without getting into the meta
physics of it all (mainly because
I don't understand the meta
physics of it all), your reality is
just that your reality. It is the
way you, and you alone, per
ceive the world. We hypothesize
to fill in the inevitable gaps we
can never really know the
motivations of others, their per
ceptions of us and what we think
is "capital-T Truth" and then
we respond accordingly. We may
be right or wrong in these as
sumptions, but either way, it's all
we really have to go on. And in
that way, our lives the stories
we experience and the stories
we tell are always half-in
vented.
See you next week, new best
friend. I'm looking forward to it.

If you want your new best friend to
be your new more-than-just-friends,
email Chase at ninjaish@stanford.
edu. Cheers!

ize how gray black-and-white is
sues really are and how important
it is to hear all sides (especially the
minority) before taking a firm
stance. (So, if I ever do write an
overly political column, it probably
means I have been kidnapped by
the North Koreans and am writing
at gunpoint. Rather than assessing
the persuasiveness and rhetorical
strength of my argument, you
should write a letter to your con
gressman petitioning for my re
lease.)
Ivan Illich, an Australian
philosopher, wrote, "Neither revo
lution nor reformation can ulti
mately change a society, rather you
must tell a new powerful tale, one
so persuasive that it sweeps away
the old myths and becomes the
preferred story, one so inclusive
that it gathers all the bits of our
past and our present into a coher
ent whole, one that even shines
some light into our future so that
we can take the next step ... If you
want to change a society, then you

have to tell an alternative story."

This column will be about
telling that alternative story. I be
lieve that with everything we do
our actions, our conversations, our
attitudes and our relationships
we are all telling a story to the rest
of the world about who we are,
what we believe and what we
value. It is not a question of if we
are telling a story, but what kind of
story we are telling. Is it exciting?
Does it have twists and tensions? Is
there a happy ending? Is my story
worth reading?
And what better way to talk is
sues of identity, belief and worth
than through stories and art? Self
awareness is the goal. We can an
swer the "who?" and "why?" and
"how?" and "what next?" ques
tions much better if we bring the
same level of analysis to our own
lives that we bring to stories and
artistic endeavors. I hope that the
honesty and vulnerability in this
column will allow for a dialogue, a
response in addition to an opinion,
on the more abstract and more
personal aspects of life, the kind of
things you really only share with a
best friend.

In maintaining the dialogue, I
invite, encourage and beg you to
use your voice. If you have opin
ions or questions about my views,
email me. If you want to know why
I don't drink or how I can be "intel
lectual" and still a Christian, or if
you want a 15-page single-spaced

explanation of why the Angels are
the greatest baseball team in the
MLB, email me. If you have your
own story you want to share that
you think can change (or shift) so
ciety, email me. This column is a
platform, and your voice in the
conversation is the difference be
tween "talking at" and "talking to"
the Stanford community. And I'm
all ears.
Half-Invented refers to the
way we experience the world.
Without getting into the meta
physics of it all (mainly because
I don't understand the meta
physics of it all), your reality is
just that your reality. It is the
way you, and you alone, per
ceive the world. We hypothesize
to fill in the inevitable gaps we
can never really know the
motivations of others, their per
ceptions of us and what we think
is "capital-T Truth" and then
we respond accordingly. We may
be right or wrong in these as
sumptions, but either way, it's all
we really have to go on. And in
that way, our lives the stories
we experience and the stories
we tell are always half-in
vented.
See you next week, new best
friend. I'm looking forward to it.

be your new more-than-just-friends,

Why hello there, Tuesday
Reader! Fancy meeting
you here.

Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Chase Ishii, and for the
next four months, I will be your
new best friend. (If you are reading
this next to your current best
friend, don't worry. Just breathe
slowly and act natural, and they
won't have a clue. Unless, of course,
they are reading this with you, in
which case,you have been replaced
as well, so everything is fine.)
Some of you may know me as
"the Thursday Poop Newspaper
Guy" from last volume (which is
actually one of the better nick
names I've received. Much better
than Squishy Ishii... I immediate
ly regret putting that in print.) But
with a new volume and a new day
comes a new theme. This column
will not be a traditional Opinions
column, but you will forgive me for
it (because that's what best friends
do.)

I will not be addressing contro
versial topics, such as politics, the
economy or whether or not the E!
Channel is ruining America's rep
utation more than any act of for
eign intervention ever could. (It is.)
The older I get, the more I real
ize how gray black-and-white is
sues really are and how important
it is to hear all sides (especially the
minority) before taking a firm
stance. (So, if I ever do write an
overly political column, it probably
means I have been kidnapped by
the North Koreans and am writing
at gunpoint. Rather than assessing

gressman petitioning for my re
