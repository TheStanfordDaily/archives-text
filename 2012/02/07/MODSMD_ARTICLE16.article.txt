## Spare me all the legacy nonsense 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
It has now been over 24 hours
since Super Sunday, so by
now you are probably aware
that, in between the M.I.A.
bird-flip and the sadly sub
par commercials, there was actually
a football game between the New
York Giants and the New England
Patriots.
And, from a relatively neutral
perspective, it was... decent. There
were moments: the penalty-induced
safety on Tom Brady's first pass, the
fumbles the Patriots couldn't recov
er, the iconic Manning-to-Manning
ham connection on the final drive
and, of course, the most awkward
Super Bowl-winning touchdown of
all time, courtesy of Ahmad Brad
shaw. Plus, the game did come down
to the final moments, which is, in
many ways, all you can ask for from
any football game.
Then again, it wasn't exactly the
most thrilling game. Unless you are a
diehard fan of the Giants or Patriots,
or someone who bet a large amount
of money on the game, you probably
can't remember much that hap
pened between the opening safety
and the last five minutes of the game.
Except maybe the new Volkswagen
Star Wars ad.
As a stats nut, I love dissecting
box scores, but this one is fairly dull
as big-game scorelines go. There was
only one turnover (which was the
equivalent of a punt anyway), only
one player with more than 73 yards
rushing or receiving and only one
play of more than 24 yards (the
aforementioned pass to Manning
ham).
The game's MVP (Eli Manning)
accounted for exactly one touch
down; the supposed best player in
the game (Brady) looked off and
missed some crucial throws.The sup
posed genius coach (Bill Belichick)
wasted a timeout on a dumb chal
lenge, and the most talked-about
and prolific pass-catchers (Rob
Gronkowski and Victor Cruz) had
51 receiving yards combined.
Yes, there were great plays and
great performances, but even 24
hours later, it's starting to be forget
table for me.
Yet if we ignore the Super Bowl,
then we have to accept the reality
that we have over 200 days until the
next meaningful football game. And
that is scary.
Perhaps it is because of this fear,
or maybe it's just the nature of sports
media, but within .02 milliseconds of
the final Hail Mary hitting the
ground, you could hear the "legacy"
whispers begin around the country.
The first topic on everyone's minds
after running through the highlights
seemed to be about the legacies of
the players, coaches and teams in
volved.
If you're the kind of person that
only watches the occasional game

and not the 400 hours of pre- and
postgame coverage surrounding it,
here's a typical legacy debate: "After
winning this game, does [insert win
ning team's best player] now belong
among the all-time greats?" "Well,
he won [the game], so he is now def
initely better than [insert historically
famous player that everyone knows
is better than the current player] be
cause he won [the game].""ls [insert
winning coach] now a sure-fire Hall
of Famer?" "Does this loss tarnish
[insert losing team's best
player/coach]'s legacy?" "Yes, he
can't win the big one/No, he just did
n't have the weapons around him
this year."
You can tweak a word or two, but
those templates can basically give
you an entire daily sports show for
the next two weeks. Just fill in Eli
Manning, his second Super Bowl,
Peyton Manning, Joe Namath, Dan
Marino, Tom Coughlin, Bill Be
lichick and Tom Brady where ap
propriate.
By far the most popular question
seems to be if Eli is an elite, surefire
Hall of Famer. Brady and Belichick,
as the World's Perfect Player and
World's Perfect Coach, are immune
from insult, and Coughlin is an old
guy who won two Super Bowls
when people thought he'd be fired.
Go him. But what about Eli? Did he
really put the "Eli" in "elite"?
The general consensus seems to
be that he did. I'm fine with that. He
won his second Super Bowl, and he
was the MVP in both. That seems
elite to me. What I can't stand is that
the conversation instantly goes to
his legacy. A common refrain is "if he
retired today, he'd go down as an all
time great and a definite Hall of
Famer."

No way. If Eli Manning retired
today, he'd go down as a guy who
was really good and then randomly
retired at age 31. He's played eight
years. Let's leave the legacy talk for
when he's actually done.

This is nothing against him. I
don't think it diminishes Eli at all to
say that his legacy isn't something to
discuss right now. Merriam-Webster
says that legacy is "something trans
mitted from the past." Eli's career,
and that of his brother Peyton,
Brady, Belichick. Coughlin and
everyone else in that Super Bowl, is
still going. Let's save those discus
sions for when their careers actually
are in the past.
Instead of talking about if Eli is
now better than his brother Peyton,
talk about how incredible his throw
to Manningham was on that final
drive. Instead of blaming the Patri
ots' loss on everyone but Brady and
Belichick, hold them accountable
for not stepping up in the biggest
game of the year. You can worry
about how it'll all look to future peo
ple when the future actually comes
around.

Yet if we ignore the Super Bowl,
then we have to accept the reality
that we have over 200 days until the
next meaningful football game. And
that is scary.
Perhaps it is because of this fear,
or maybe it's just the nature of sports
media, but within .02 milliseconds of
the final Hail Mary hitting the
ground, you could hear the "legacy"
whispers begin around the country.
The first topic on everyone's minds
after running through the highlights
seemed to be about the legacies of
the players, coaches and teams in
volved.
If you're the kind of person that
only watches the occasional game

and not the 400 hours of pre- and
postgame coverage surrounding it,
here's a typical legacy debate: "After
winning this game, does [insert win
ning team's best player] now belong
among the all-time greats?" "Well,
he won [the game], so he is now def
initely better than [insert historically
famous player that everyone knows
is better than the current player] be
cause he won [the game].""ls [insert
winning coach] now a sure-fire Hall
of Famer?" "Does this loss tarnish
[insert losing team's best
player/coach]'s legacy?" "Yes, he
can't win the big one/No, he just did
n't have the weapons around him
this year."
You can tweak a word or two, but
those templates can basically give
you an entire daily sports show for
the next two weeks. Just fill in Eli
Manning, his second Super Bowl,
Peyton Manning, Joe Namath, Dan
Marino, Tom Coughlin, Bill Be
lichick and Tom Brady where ap
propriate.
By far the most popular question
seems to be if Eli is an elite, surefire
Hall of Famer. Brady and Belichick,
as the World's Perfect Player and
World's Perfect Coach, are immune
from insult, and Coughlin is an old
guy who won two Super Bowls
when people thought he'd be fired.
Go him. But what about Eli? Did he
really put the "Eli" in "elite"?
The general consensus seems to
be that he did. I'm fine with that. He
won his second Super Bowl, and he
was the MVP in both. That seems
elite to me. What I can't stand is that
the conversation instantly goes to
his legacy. A common refrain is "if he
retired today, he'd go down as an all
time great and a definite Hall of
Famer."

No way. If Eli Manning retired
today, he'd go down as a guy who
was really good and then randomly
retired at age 31. He's played eight
years. Let's leave the legacy talk for
when he's actually done.

This is nothing against him. I
don't think it diminishes Eli at all to
say that his legacy isn't something to
discuss right now. Merriam-Webster
says that legacy is "something trans
mitted from the past." Eli's career,
and that of his brother Peyton,
Brady, Belichick. Coughlin and
everyone else in that Super Bowl, is
still going. Let's save those discus
sions for when their careers actually
are in the past.
Instead of talking about if Eli is
now better than his brother Peyton,
talk about how incredible his throw
to Manningham was on that final
drive. Instead of blaming the Patri
ots' loss on everyone but Brady and
Belichick, hold them accountable
for not stepping up in the biggest
game of the year. You can worry
about how it'll all look to future peo
ple when the future actually comes
around.

It has now been over 24 hours
since Super Sunday, so by
now you are probably aware
that, in between the M.I.A.
bird-flip and the sadly sub
par commercials, there was actually
a football game between the New
York Giants and the New England
Patriots.
And, from a relatively neutral
perspective, it was... decent. There
were moments: the penalty-induced
safety on Tom Brady's first pass, the
fumbles the Patriots couldn't recov
er, the iconic Manning-to-Manning
ham connection on the final drive
and, of course, the most awkward
Super Bowl-winning touchdown of
all time, courtesy of Ahmad Brad
shaw. Plus, the game did come down
to the final moments, which is, in
many ways, all you can ask for from
any football game.
Then again, it wasn't exactly the
most thrilling game. Unless you are a
diehard fan of the Giants or Patriots,
or someone who bet a large amount
of money on the game, you probably
can't remember much that hap
pened between the opening safety
and the last five minutes of the game.
Except maybe the new Volkswagen
Star Wars ad.
As a stats nut, I love dissecting
box scores, but this one is fairly dull
as big-game scorelines go. There was
only one turnover (which was the
equivalent of a punt anyway), only
one player with more than 73 yards
rushing or receiving and only one
play of more than 24 yards (the
aforementioned pass to Manning
ham).
The game's MVP (Eli Manning)
accounted for exactly one touch
down; the supposed best player in
the game (Brady) looked off and
missed some crucial throws.The sup
posed genius coach (Bill Belichick)
wasted a timeout on a dumb chal
lenge, and the most talked-about
and prolific pass-catchers (Rob
Gronkowski and Victor Cruz) had
51 receiving yards combined.
Yes, there were great plays and
great performances, but even 24
hours later, it's starting to be forget
table for me.
