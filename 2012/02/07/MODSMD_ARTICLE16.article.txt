## Spare me all the legacy nonsense 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
It has now been over 24 hours
since Super Sunday, so by
now you are probably aware
that, in between the M.I.A.
bird-flip and the sadly sub
par commercials, there was actually
a football game between the New
York Giants and the New England
Patriots.
And, from a relatively neutral
perspective, it was... decent. There
were moments: the penalty-induced
safety on Tom Brady's first pass, the
fumbles the Patriots couldn't recov
er, the iconic Manning-to-Manning
ham connection on the final drive
and, of course, the most awkward
Super Bowl-winning touchdown of
all time, courtesy of Ahmad Brad
shaw. Plus, the game did come down
to the final moments, which is, in
many ways, all you can ask for from
any football game.
Then again, it wasn't exactly the
most thrilling game. Unless you are a
diehard fan of the Giants or Patriots,
or someone who bet a large amount
of money on the game, you probably
can't remember much that hap
pened between the opening safety
and the last five minutes of the game.
Except maybe the new Volkswagen
Star Wars ad.
As a stats nut, I love dissecting
box scores, but this one is fairly dull
as big-game scorelines go. There was
only one turnover (which was the
equivalent of a punt anyway), only
one player with more than 73 yards
rushing or receiving and only one
play of more than 24 yards (the
aforementioned pass to Manning
ham).
The game's MVP (Eli Manning)
accounted for exactly one touch
down; the supposed best player in
the game (Brady) looked off and
missed some crucial throws.The sup
posed genius coach (Bill Belichick)
wasted a timeout on a dumb chal
lenge, and the most talked-about
and prolific pass-catchers (Rob
Gronkowski and Victor Cruz) had
51 receiving yards combined.
Yes, there were great plays and
great performances, but even 24
hours later, it's starting to be forget
table for me.
Yet if we ignore the Super Bowl,
then we have to accept the reality
that we have over 200 days until the
next meaningful football game. And
that is scary.
Perhaps it is because of this fear,
or maybe it's just the nature of sports
media, but within .02 milliseconds of
the final Hail Mary hitting the
ground, you could hear the "legacy"
whispers begin around the country.
The first topic on everyone's minds
after running through the highlights
seemed to be about the legacies of
the players, coaches and teams in
volved.
If you're the kind of person that
only watches the occasional game
