# NEED TO REBOUND
## CARD COMING OFF TWO LOSSES 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
After getting waxed in two
matches this weekend at home,
the Stanford men's tennis team
will try to bounce back against
Hawaii on Tuesday.
The No. 6 Cardinal dropped
lopsided contests to USC and
UCLA this past weekend, getting
handed 7-0 and 6-1 losses, respec
tively, and needs a bounce-back
victory in a major way.

"The best way to describe it
was painful," said senior captain
Bradley Klahn about the Cardi
nal's performance. "It leaves a bit
ter taste in our mouths. USC and
UCLA are such a big rivalry, and
in my three years, every match has
been hotly contested ... So to
come out and lose 12 singles
matches this weekend and to put
one point on the board, it hurts."
Klahn, who has been sidelined
so far this season with a back in
jury, said the disappointing week
end should act as a major wake
up call for the Cardinal as it
launches into the heart of its
spring schedule.
"I hope everyone takes away
from this that they don't want to
see that happen again, especially
on our home courts," Klahn said.
"1 think it'd be hard to find a time
where Stanford's lost 7-0 at home
in their history.
"Just to see USC taking a pic
ture of the scoreboard, it's irritat
ing, and it should irritate all the
guys on the team," he continued.
"I hope it motivates us to dig a lit
tle deeper and gut out one or two

more balls late in that third set the
next time we play them."

In contrast to the Cardinal's
recent performances, Hawaii is
coming off its biggest win of the
season, a 4-3 upset of No. 61 Saint
Mary's on Sunday but history
suggests that Stanford should
have little trouble in this
matchup.
Over Thanksgiving, the Cardi
nal dominated the Rainbow War
riors, 7-0, in an exhibition match
in Hawaii. Stanford was missing
its top two players seniors
Ryan Thacher and Klahn and
still came away with the victory in
a dominant performance. Addi
tionally, Hawaii had dropped
three straight matches before its
upset of Saint Mary's, including a
7-0 defeat at the hands of the No.
14 Mississippi State Bulldogs.
Klahn said that even though
the Cardinal has a good history
against the squad from the Aloha
State, the team should understand
the gravity of Tuesday's match.
"We had a good start to the
season, winning two matches in
Tulsa against a good Tulsa and
North Carolina team, and we got
knocked down pretty hard this
weekend," he said. "So I think it's
pretty important for the guys to
not overlook anyone at this point
and come prepared for the match
tomorrow."
The Cardinal and the Rainbow
Warriors square off today at 1:30
p.m. at the Taube Family Tennis
Center.
