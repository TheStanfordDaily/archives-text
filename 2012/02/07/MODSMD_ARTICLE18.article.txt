## Tarver leaves to run Raiders' defense 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
After leaving the NFL to join the Stanford foot
ball coaching staff in 20f 0, co-defensive coordinator
Jason Tarver is headed back to the NFL this time,
as the defensive coordinator for the Oakland
Raiders.
Tarver, who coached for the San Francisco 49ers
for 10 years before joining head coach David Shaw's
staff last season, couldn't pass up the opportunity to
return to the NFL.
Tarver joins the staff of new head coach Dennis
Allen, who took over the Raiders' head job after
spending last season as the Denver Broncos defen
sive coordinator. Allen had the authority to hand
pick his own staff and, after former defensive coordi
nator Chuck Bresnahan wasn't retained by the
Raiders, he didn't have to look very far to find his
new defensive coordinator.
Tarver's tutelage helped spearhead an impres
sive Cardinal defense this season Stanford's de
fense finished the season ranked either first or sec
ond in the Pac-12 in eight categories, including first in
total defense and rushing defense.
Even with his impressive credentials, though,
Tarver has his work cut out for him across the Bay.
The Raiders are certainly a team in transition, with

the death of longtime owner A1 Davis last fall and
the firing of head coach Hue Jackson and his staff
after finishing last season with an 8-8 record and
that doesn't even begin to sum up their on-field
problems.
The Raiders were not only the most-penalized
team in NFL history, but also the NFL's fourth-worst
defense last season. The Raiders gave up franchise
worsts in touchdown passes allowed, yards per carry,
yards passing and total yards. Additionally, the
Raiders gave up the third-most points in team histo
ry, all of which led to the major house cleaning in
Oakland.


DON FERIA/The Stanford Daily
Co-defensive coordinator Jason Tarver, a former
assistant with the San Francisco 49ers, is leaving
Stanford to take the defensive coordinator post
with another NFL team, the Oakland Raiders.
The move across the Bay means
that Tarver will have spent essen
tially his entire life coaching in the
Bay Area.The 37-year-old graduat
ed high school in nearby Pleasan
ton, attended Santa Clara Universi
ty for college and had his first
coaching job at West Valley College
in Saratoga before spending a
decade with the Niners.
With Tarver departing for the
Raiders, Shaw and the Cardinal will
now need to replace three coaches
on staff after special teams coach
and recruiting coordinator Brian
Polian's departure for Texas A&M
and the death of defensive assistant
Chester McGlockton.
