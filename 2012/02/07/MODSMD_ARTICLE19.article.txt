# SEASON BEST NOT ENOUGH

### CONNOR SCHERER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sunday's meet against the No. 7
UCLA Bruins was full of highs and
lows for the Stanford women's gym
nastics team. Despite putting up a
season-high score of 196.450, the
Cardinal suffered its second straight
loss as UCLA put up 197.250.

Stanford and UCLA have long
been rivals in gymnastics, as they
have combined for 14 of the last 15
conference championships. Last
year, Stanford controlled the season
series, beating UCLA three of the
four times they met (though the one
loss came in the Pac-10 Champi
onships). The Cardinal looked to get
an early lead on the season series
against the Bruins on Sunday, but
was unable to do so.
Stanford started on bars, posting
a team score of 49.125 and led by

senior Nicole Pechanec, who tied
her season-high score of 9.900.
Sophomore Shona Morgan and
freshman Samantha Shapiro also
had impressive contributions in the
event, as they both posted career
high scores of 9.875. However,
UCLA's 49.475 on vault gave the
Bruins an early lead that they would
hold for the rest of the meet.
The Cardinal would then go on to
put up a season-high score of 49.300
on bars, the first time the team has
eclipsed the 49-point mark in this
event all season. This strong per
formance was thanks in large part to
junior Nicole Dayton, who scored a
9.900 for the second-straight week
after missing a meet against Wash
ington due to injury. Dayton was
matched by freshman Ivana Hong,
whose 9.900 was the best score of
her young collegiate career. Stan
ford managed to narrow its deficit to
98.650-98.425 with its impressive
vault performance, but still had
work to do going into the last two
rounds.

STANFORD 196.450

2/5, Los Angeles, Calif.


NICK SALAZAR/The Stanford Daily
The Stanford women's gymnastics team had a bittersweet dual meet
against UCLA in Los Angeles. The Cardinal put up its best score of
the season, 196.450, but it was not enough to top the host Bruins,
who scored 197.250 to hand Stanford its second straight loss.
On the floor exercise, Pechanec
scored a season-best 9.900, her sec
ond of the day, and freshman
Pauline Hanset matched her ca
reer best on the floor with a 9.850.
They helped contribute to the Car
dinal's 49.000 in the event, its sea
son best on floor. However, de
spite such a strong performance in
the event, UCLA extended its lead
to 0.475 going into the final round.
Having had its fair share of
problems on the beam last week
against Oregon State (posting a
season-low score of just 47.750 due
to three falls), the Cardinal hoped
to have a better performance than
last week despite a similar pres
sure scenario as was the case in

last week's meet, the team was on
the road and needed a strong
beam performance to narrow its
deficit.

Unlike last week, however, the
Cardinal had an impressive outing
on the beam, posting a score of
49.025, its second best of the sea
son. Shona Morgan put up her sec
ond 9.875 on the day, and junior
Ashley Morgan also scored a 9.875
to improve her score by 0.650
points from last week. Unfortu
nately, the 49.025, despite being
the Cardinal's second-best beam
score on the season, was not
enough to catch the Bruins, whose
49.350 sealed the victory 197.250-
196.450.

Impressive individual perform
ances highlighted the day for the
Cardinal, as two Stanford gym
nasts posted very strong scores in
Sunday's loss. Pechanec's two
9.900 scores helped her put up a

career-best 39.325 in the all
around competition, while Ashley
Morgan also posted a career-high
39.300 on the day. Unfortunately
for the Cardinal, UCLA sopho
more Samantha Peszek also post
ed the best all-around score of her
career with a 39.550.

Stanford drops to 4-2 on the
season (1-2 in the Pac-12) with the
loss, while UCLA improves to 4-1
(2-1 in the Pac-12). The Cardinal
next meets the Bruins at the Pac
-12 Championships on March 24,
where the team will look to even
the season series and take the
more important matchup between
the two. Next up for Stanford is the
team's first meeting with archrival
Cal in Berkeley, where Stanford
continues its five-game road swing
on Sunday.
