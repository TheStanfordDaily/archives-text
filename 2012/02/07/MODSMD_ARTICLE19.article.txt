# SEASON BEST NOT ENOUGH

### CONNOR SCHERER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sunday's meet against the No. 7
UCLA Bruins was full of highs and
lows for the Stanford women's gym
nastics team. Despite putting up a
season-high score of 196.450, the
Cardinal suffered its second straight
loss as UCLA put up 197.250.

Stanford and UCLA have long
been rivals in gymnastics, as they
have combined for 14 of the last 15
conference championships. Last
year, Stanford controlled the season
series, beating UCLA three of the
four times they met (though the one
loss came in the Pac-10 Champi
onships). The Cardinal looked to get
an early lead on the season series
against the Bruins on Sunday, but
was unable to do so.
Stanford started on bars, posting
a team score of 49.125 and led by

senior Nicole Pechanec, who tied
her season-high score of 9.900.
Sophomore Shona Morgan and
freshman Samantha Shapiro also
had impressive contributions in the
event, as they both posted career
high scores of 9.875. However,
UCLA's 49.475 on vault gave the
Bruins an early lead that they would
hold for the rest of the meet.
The Cardinal would then go on to
put up a season-high score of 49.300
on bars, the first time the team has
eclipsed the 49-point mark in this
event all season. This strong per
formance was thanks in large part to
junior Nicole Dayton, who scored a
9.900 for the second-straight week
after missing a meet against Wash
ington due to injury. Dayton was
matched by freshman Ivana Hong,
whose 9.900 was the best score of
her young collegiate career. Stan
ford managed to narrow its deficit to
98.650-98.425 with its impressive
vault performance, but still had
work to do going into the last two
rounds.
