## UN. official pessimistic about peace Special rapporteur grim, on Middle East peace process 
### MARWA FARAG MANAGING EDITOR 
Richard Falk, the United Na
tions special rapporteur on the sit
uation of human rights in the
Palestinian territories occupied
since 1967, spoke Monday at Stan
ford Law School on the "funda
mental" flaws in the Israeli-Pales
tinian peace process. In the talk, ti
tled, "Imagining Israeli-Palestin
ian Peace: Why International Law
Matters," Falk expressed his pes
simism at the possibility of peace
emerging from the Israeli-Pales
tinian peace process in its current
form.
The peace process refers to a
Quartet-mediated and U.S.-led
negotiation process between Is
rael and Palestine that has taken a
number of forms since its birth in
1991. Falk called for an Israeli-
Palestinian solution that goes "be
yond" the Quartet and the peace
process.
Falk began the talk by reflect
ing on a speech he gave in 2009, in
which he said he could not "imag
ine peace" out of the current
process, highlighting "structural
and substantial flaws."
"The flaw in its structure was
that a negotiated process of con
flict resolution in which the un
conditional ally of the strongest
party in the conflict also purports
to play a mediating neutral party
role is just unacceptable as a form
of conflict resolution," he said, re
ferring to the United State's role
as a conflict mediator in the nego
tiations.
The other "flaw" Falk men
tioned was the excision of interna
tional law from the diplomatic
process. He argued that Israel has
used its diplomatic leverage, "to ex
clude any consideration of the in
ternational law bearing on such is
sues as refugees, borders,
Jerusalem, water and settlements."
"What in fact was the political
foundation of the negotiations was
the so-called 'facts on the ground,'
which is a euphemism for convert
ing unlawful developments into a
political premise on which negotia
tions are supposed to proceed,"
Falk said.
He deemed this process, "a rati
fication of illegality in the name of
realism."
Moving to explain his pes
simism at the possible results of the
peace process, Falk said the kind of
peace process he imagines as hav
ing the potential to produce, "a sus
tainable and somewhat just" peace
was "never given any opportunity
to develop."
Falk did, however, emphasize
the importance of finding a resolu
tion to the conflict.
"So long as this conflict contin
ues, it produces a cycle of intense
tension... it produces war-gener
ating situations as now seem to be
the case in relation to Iran... it
keeps the whole region in a perpet
ual pre-war condition," he said.
"One would've supposed that
something more imaginative than
this futile process would have
emerged at this stage, and yet what
does one find from our leaders?" he

asked. "A unified plea to the parties
to resume these fruitless negotia
tions."
Falk attributed this continued
return to the conventional diplo
matic framework to the "delusion
that a peace process exists through
this negotiating charade."
"There is this sense that some
thing constructive can possibly
emerge, and it removes any pres
sure to do something else," he said.
"It creates this closure of the imag
ination and... takes our attention
away from the ordeal of suffering
that has been imposed on the Pales
tinian people."
After painting a bleak picture of
the peace process, Falk called for
thinking outside the "conventional
box."
"I can't envision how [the situa
tion] will be transformed in a con
structive way without moving from
the domain of reason and analysis
to the domain of the imagination,"
he said.
Falk stressed that multiple alter
natives are possible, but focused on
a region-wide solution incorporat
ing Israel and Palestine, coupled
with the establishment of a nuclear
free zone in the Middle East.
"It does seem to be the one kind
of orientation that could really
change the negative expectations
on all sides and produce, with a little
give on the part of several of the ac

tors, a genuine win-win outcome for
all the participants in the region," he
said, mentioning the Arab Peace
Initiative of 2002 as an example.
Falk made remarks on the con
textual changes that have affected
the peace process more recently.
He highlighted the Arab Spring, de
velopments within the Palestinian
movement and changing public
opinion.
He described the Arab Spring as
"encouragement for increased de
mocratization in the region, which
inevitably works in favor of the
Palestinian struggle." He also
praised the "great potential" he saw
in nonviolent military in the Pales
tinian resistance movement.
"Perhaps the most important
development within the Palestinian
movement itself is a strong shift in
tactical emphasis from armed re
sistance to popular resistance and a
reliance on a global solidarity
movement of the sort that was so
effective in opposing apartheid
South Africa," he said. "The Pales
tinians have increasingly been wag
ing what I call a 'legitimacy war' to
occupy the high moral and legal
ground in relation to the conflict."
Following the talk, John Felstin
er, English professor emeritus,
commented that Falk's talk pre
sented "half the truth, historically."
"I provided an interpretation
based on my understanding of how

to see the essential issue," Falk
replied. "I would stand behind my
view that the essential character of
the conflict represents this denial..
. of Palestinian rights, the expan
sion of Israel [and] the uncondi
tional way in which the U.S. has
handled the conflict."

"Regardless of where you stand
on the conflict... hearing some
one with such high academic stand
ing and rank in the international
world ... spend most of the time
not imagining peace but shooting
down peace at an event called
'lmagining Israeli-Palestinian
Peace' was quite frustrating," audi
ence member Daniel Bardenstein
'l3 said.
Other members of the audience
posed questions on population
transfer issues, grassroots social
movements, Hamas' charter and its
viability as a partner for peace and
the inevitability of a one state solu
tion.

The event was co-sponsored by
The International Law Society, Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal Rights,
the Stanford International Human
Rights and Conflict Resolution
Clinic, the Advanced Degree Stu
dents Association and the Stanford
Association for Law in the Middle
East.
