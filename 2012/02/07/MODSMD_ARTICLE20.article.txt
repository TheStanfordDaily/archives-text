## Stanford demolishes USC in LA 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's swimming
and diving team took a trip down
to USC this past weekend, hoping
for some fast individual swims
and a team win. The Cardinal ac
complished both of those goals as
No. 3 Stanford (7-1, 3-1 Pac-12)
swam some eye-popping times
while defeating No. 5 USC 175-
118 on Saturday.

STANFORD 175
USC 118
2/4, Los Angeles, Calif.

Coming into the meet, there
was little doubt that USC McDon
ald's Swim Stadium was going to
be the site of some of the fastest
performances in the nation so far
this season. The quality of competi
tion was top-notch as Stanford,
USC and Cal teams all ranked
in the top six nationally met for
a quasi-tri-meet.
USC and Cal squared off first
on Friday while Stanford swam ex
hibition. On Saturday, Stanford du
eled against USC while Cal's
swims were not officially scored.
Although the Cardinal swimmers
could have just taken it easy on the
first day, they instead used this
golden opportunity to put up some
fast times against national-caliber
teams. Stanford would carry this
momentum and take it to an even
higher level the next day against
USC.
The Cardinal made a statement
from the beginning by winning the
400 medley relay against the Tro
jans. Junior Aaron Wayne was able
to hold off the fastest sprinter in the
nation, USC's Vladimir Morosov,
in the last leg of the relay. Immedi
ately after, senior Chad La
Tourette maintained his dual-meet
dominance by winning the 1650
freestyle, the longest event in colle
giate competition. La Tourette
would eventually finish the meet as
a two-event winner by also notch
ing a victory in the 500 freestyle
albeit by a much smaller margin.
Head coach Skip Kenney was
"very pleased" with his team's
overall performance. He also at
tributed La Tourette's success in
dual-meet competition to his "hard
work and talent as a leader of the
team."
Stanford ended up winning 11
of the 16 events in which it compet
ed. But it was the combination of
those first-place finishes with the
team's outstanding depth that
helped it quickly pull away from
USC. The Cardinal managed to
swim a 1-2-3 sweep in four events
and finish 1-2 in four others.
The first of these 1-2-3 sweeps,
led by senior Bobby Bollier,
came in the 200 butterfly. This
event was crucial, as it was near
the middle of the meet and essen
tially made a USC win very un
likely. From that point on, the gap
between the Cardinal and the
Trojans kept on widening. With
four events left in the meet, Stan
ford started swimming exhibi

tion, meaning that some of the
team's scored points were not of
ficially counted.
On the diving board, the fresh
man duo of Kristian Ipsen and
Connor Kuremsky respectively
finished 1-2 on both springboard
events a feat that's been seen
quite a lot throughout this season.
The duo led the way for the Cardi
nal diving squad to collectively
outscore their Trojan counterparts
by a score of 26-10.
In USC's defense, the Trojans
may have been feeling the after ef
fects of a tough meet against Cal
the day earlier. USC's Morosov
held his own against the Cardinal
with two individual wins. But even
his two victories were not easy to
come by. Morosov barely held off
Cardinal junior Aaron Wayne in
the 100 freestyle and freshman
David Nolan in the 100 breast

stroke.
The race between Morosov and
Nolan was especially interesting
because the event was somewhat
of an unfamiliar territory for both
swimmers. Morosov specializes in
the freestyle events, while Nolan's
weakest stroke is the breaststroke.
In the end, Morosov was able to
edge out Nolan by just two-tenths
of a second.
On top of leaving Southern Cal
ifornia with a win, Stanford also got
a good preview of Cal, even though
the two rivals did not officially
compete against each other. It's
only fitting that the two teams will
meet for the last dual meet of the
regular season. The Cardinal's
showdown against the Golden
Bears will be at home on Feb. 18.

edge out Nolan by just two-tenths
of a second.
On top of leaving Southern Cal
ifornia with a win, Stanford also got
a good preview of Cal, even though
the two rivals did not officially
compete against each other. It's
only fitting that the two teams will
meet for the last dual meet of the
regular season. The Cardinal's
showdown against the Golden
Bears will be at home on Feb. 18.

The Stanford men's swimming
and diving team took a trip down
to USC this past weekend, hoping
for some fast individual swims
and a team win. The Cardinal ac
complished both of those goals as
No. 3 Stanford (7-1, 3-1 Pac-12)
swam some eye-popping times
while defeating No. 5 USC 175-
118 on Saturday.

MEN'S SWIMMING
STANFORD 175
USC 118
2/4, Los Angeles, Calif.

Coming into the meet, there
was little doubt that USC McDon
ald's Swim Stadium was going to
be the site of some of the fastest
performances in the nation so far
this season. The quality of competi
tion was top-notch as Stanford,
USC and Cal teams all ranked
in the top six nationally met for
a quasi-tri-meet.
USC and Cal squared off first
on Friday while Stanford swam ex
hibition. On Saturday, Stanford du
eled against USC while Cal's
swims were not officially scored.
Although the Cardinal swimmers
could have just taken it easy on the
first day, they instead used this
golden opportunity to put up some
fast times against national-caliber
teams. Stanford would carry this
momentum and take it to an even
higher level the next day against
USC.
The Cardinal made a statement
from the beginning by winning the
400 medley relay against the Tro
jans. Junior Aaron Wayne was able
to hold off the fastest sprinter in the
nation, USC's Vladimir Morosov,
in the last leg of the relay. Immedi
ately after, senior Chad La
Tourette maintained his dual-meet
dominance by winning the 1650
freestyle, the longest event in colle
giate competition. La Tourette
would eventually finish the meet as
a two-event winner by also notch
ing a victory in the 500 freestyle
albeit by a much smaller margin.
Head coach Skip Kenney was
"very pleased" with his team's
overall performance. He also at
tributed La Tourette's success in
dual-meet competition to his "hard
work and talent as a leader of the
team."
Stanford ended up winning 11
of the 16 events in which it compet
ed. But it was the combination of
those first-place finishes with the
team's outstanding depth that
helped it quickly pull away from
USC. The Cardinal managed to
swim a 1-2-3 sweep in four events
and finish 1-2 in four others.
The first of these 1-2-3 sweeps,
led by senior Bobby Bollier,
came in the 200 butterfly. This
event was crucial, as it was near
the middle of the meet and essen
tially made a USC win very un
likely. From that point on, the gap
between the Cardinal and the
Trojans kept on widening. With
four events left in the meet, Stan
ford started swimming exhibi

tion, meaning that some of the
team's scored points were not of
ficially counted.
On the diving board, the fresh
man duo of Kristian Ipsen and
Connor Kuremsky respectively
finished 1-2 on both springboard
events a feat that's been seen
quite a lot throughout this season.
The duo led the way for the Cardi
nal diving squad to collectively
outscore their Trojan counterparts
by a score of 26-10.
In USC's defense, the Trojans
may have been feeling the after ef
fects of a tough meet against Cal
the day earlier. USC's Morosov
held his own against the Cardinal
with two individual wins. But even
his two victories were not easy to
come by. Morosov barely held off
Cardinal junior Aaron Wayne in
the 100 freestyle and freshman
David Nolan in the 100 breast

stroke.
The race between Morosov and
Nolan was especially interesting
because the event was somewhat
of an unfamiliar territory for both
swimmers. Morosov specializes in
the freestyle events, while Nolan's
weakest stroke is the breaststroke.
In the end, Morosov was able to
edge out Nolan by just two-tenths
of a second.
