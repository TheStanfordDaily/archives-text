## Stanford demolishes USC in LA 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's swimming
and diving team took a trip down
to USC this past weekend, hoping
for some fast individual swims
and a team win. The Cardinal ac
complished both of those goals as
No. 3 Stanford (7-1, 3-1 Pac-12)
swam some eye-popping times
while defeating No. 5 USC 175-
118 on Saturday.

STANFORD 175
USC 118
2/4, Los Angeles, Calif.

Coming into the meet, there
was little doubt that USC McDon
ald's Swim Stadium was going to
be the site of some of the fastest
performances in the nation so far
this season. The quality of competi
tion was top-notch as Stanford,
USC and Cal teams all ranked
in the top six nationally met for
a quasi-tri-meet.
USC and Cal squared off first
on Friday while Stanford swam ex
hibition. On Saturday, Stanford du
eled against USC while Cal's
swims were not officially scored.
Although the Cardinal swimmers
could have just taken it easy on the
first day, they instead used this
golden opportunity to put up some
fast times against national-caliber
teams. Stanford would carry this
momentum and take it to an even
higher level the next day against
USC.
The Cardinal made a statement
from the beginning by winning the
400 medley relay against the Tro
jans. Junior Aaron Wayne was able
to hold off the fastest sprinter in the
nation, USC's Vladimir Morosov,
in the last leg of the relay. Immedi
ately after, senior Chad La
Tourette maintained his dual-meet
dominance by winning the 1650
freestyle, the longest event in colle
giate competition. La Tourette
would eventually finish the meet as
a two-event winner by also notch
ing a victory in the 500 freestyle
albeit by a much smaller margin.
Head coach Skip Kenney was
"very pleased" with his team's
overall performance. He also at
tributed La Tourette's success in
dual-meet competition to his "hard
work and talent as a leader of the
team."
Stanford ended up winning 11
of the 16 events in which it compet
