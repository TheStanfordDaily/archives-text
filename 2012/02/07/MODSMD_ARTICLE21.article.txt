## Card loses two to sub-.500 teams 
### PALANI ESWARAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 16 Stanford wrestling
team had a disappointing weekend,
dropping duals to the Utah Valley
Wolverines and the Arizona State
Sun Devils, two teams that have los
ing records in dual meets. The Car
dinal (8-8,3-2 Pac-12) lost to Utah
Valley on Friday by a score of 25-10
and lost to Arizona State on Sunday
by a score of 22-15. Some wrestlers,
mostly freshmen, wrestled in the
California Collegiate Open in San
Francisco on Saturday, and two
Cardinal wrestlers placed.

In the match against Utah Val
ley, Stanford forfeited at 125
pounds once again. Head coach
Jason Borrelli has chosen to do this
numerous times this season. This
past weekend, Borrelli likely want
ed to give No. 8 Ryan Mango some
time off after a tough, physical
match against Oregon State. But
forfeiting that weight class put the
Card down by six to start the match.
The Wolverines then won three
consecutive matches, two by deci
sion and one by major decision, to go
up 16-0. Stanford won three of the

final six matches. At 157 pounds,
sophomore Garrett Schaner won by
decision; at 174 pounds, redshirt sen
ior No. 1 Nick Amuchastegui won by
major decision; and at 184 pounds,
redshirt junior Spence Patrick won
by decision.

The match against Arizona
State was much closer —if the
Card had won one more individual
match, it might have won the dual.
Once again, however, Stanford got
off to a slow start, digging itself into
a 22-3 hole. The only win in the
team's first seven matches was an
8-1 victory by redshirt junior Matt
Sencenbaugh, who was wrestling
for the first time in a month. The
team finished the match with three
consecutive major decisions by
Schaner, redshirt sophomore Bret
Baumbach at 165 pounds and
Amuchastegui.
At the California Collegiate
Open, freshmen 125-pounder
Evan Silver and 197-pounder
Michael Sojka placed fourth and
third, respectively. Silver won three
matches,including a major decision
and a pin. Sojka won four matches
and looked very impressive,
recording two major decisions and
a pin in the match for third place.
This past weekend was definite
ly a tough one for Stanford, espe
cially for a team that started off
2012 looking very impressive. The
Cardinal won four of its first five

matches in the new year, but has
lost three straight since. Last week
end, the Card lost a close match to
a very good Oregon State team,
and, despite the loss, the team
looked poised to bounce back and
win at least one of its final two
duals. But in both duals, Stanford
lost a lot of close matches, and in
the end those losses added up.
Despite the tough losses, there
are some positives to take away
from this weekend. If Mango had
wrestled, both matches would
have likely been much closer; in
fact, Stanford would likely have
beaten Arizona State.
Amuchastegui remained unde
feated by winning both of his
matches. He is now 18-0 overall
and finishes the regular season
with a perfect 15-0 dual record.
The team will have plenty of
time to learn from its mistakes this
weekend, as it does not have anoth
er match until the Pac-12 Champi
onships in Boise, Idaho on Feb. 26.
That tournament will determine
which wrestlers go to the NCAA
Tournament in March, and there is
a good chance that many wrestlers
will have rematches against Ari
zona State wrestlers in Boise, mak
ing the next few weeks even more
important.
