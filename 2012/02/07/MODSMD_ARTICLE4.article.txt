## SPER extends divestment push 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Students for Palestinian Equal Rights
(SPER) has continued its divestment campaign on
and beyond campus in recent weeks, most notably
sending delegates to a national conference on the
issue in Philadelphia this past weekend.
The divestment campaign seeks to encourage
Stanford to cease further and prevent new
endowment investment in companies that are
"profiting from the Israeli occupation [of Pales
tine]," according to SPER founder and co-presi
dent Omar Shakir 'O7, a current Stanford law stu
dent.
"Divestment has been recognized as the most
effective, moral, non-violent method of effectuat
ing change, especially within the context of human
rights abuses," Shakir said. He added that divest
ment allows students to address the Middle East
ern conflict actively.
While acknowledging that Stanford, as a pri
vate university, is not obliged to and does not
disclose its endowment investments, Shakir
noted a Stanford policy of not investing in compa
nies that cause "substantial social injury" as a basis
for SPER's appeals to the University.
Shakir cited student-prompted divestment
from apartheid South Africa as a model that
SPER is seeking to emulate. More recently, Stan
ford divested from Sinopec and PetroChina in

2005 after the companies' association with the
Darfur conflict, and in 2010, the University adopt
ed an ethical investment policy in regards to con
flict minerals as a response to the ongoing conflict
in the Congo.
SPER's campaign seeks divestment from eight
companies that, SPER alleges, violate human
rights by operating on Israeli-occupied settle
ments, enabling collective punishment, facilitating
the construction of the barrier separating Israeli
and Palestinian territories and supporting institu
tional discrimination. The eight companies listed
are Ahava, Caterpillar, Lockheed Martin, Meko
rot. Motorola, Riwal,Roadstone Holdings andVe
olia Transportation.
While the extent to which the University's en
dowment is currently invested in the eight compa
nies if at all is unknown, Shakir said mem
bers of the University's Advisoiy Panel on Invest
ment Responsibility have noted that at least some
ongoing investment in the eight firms is likely, con
sidering the endowment's vast scale,
Shakir said he is largely optimistic about the
degree of community support for the SPER cam
paign, noting that a petition first circulated in 2007
garnered more than 1,000 signatures from stu
dents, faculty, alumni and University affiliates. A
revised petition that has been recently circulated
currently has approximately 200 signatures, Shakir
estimated.
SPER anticipates making its
first formal presentation to the
Board of Trustees later in the year.
Shakir emphasized the group's cur
rent focus on making the Stanford
community more aware of an issue
he considers "relatively misunder
stood" among students.
The group is in the process of
putting on a series of public events
and student outreach initiatives in
conjunction with other student
groups focusing on human rights
and social justice.
"We're going dorm to dorm,
holding student events," Shakir
said. "We see the campaign grow
ing, and our goal is for students, fac
ulty and staff to continue to raise
their concerns about this issue."
Two delegates from SPER at
tended a "Boycott, Divestment and
Sanctions" (BDS) event at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania this past
weekend. The event incorporated
both keynote speakers and panel
discussions on how to force Israel
to comply with the movement's

perception of international law.
Both delegates, speaking on
condition of anonymity citing risk
of academic conflicts, asserted that
SPER is currently seeking to dis
tance itself from the broader BDS
movement in certain policy areas.
One delegate emphasized that
SPER supports selective rather
than wholesale divestment and
lacks a position on calls to boycott,
sanction and divest from Israel en
tirely. The delegate said these
stances distinguish the Stanford
group from its counterparts at peer
institutions.

The delegate, a Stanford sopho
more, cited the diverse range of par
ticipating individuals and organiza
tions as proof of the conference's
success, while Shakir praised the
concept behind the weekend's
events.

"The campaign is increasingly
gaining momentum across the
country," Shakir said. "We're proud
to be a part of this movement, and
we want to strategize about how we
can get more of the country in
volved in [our] activities."
The BDS conference sparked
controversy on the Penn campus,
with students and faculty sharply
and publicly divided.
Comparisons of pro-Israel cam

paigners to apartheid South Africa
and BDS supporters to Nazi Ger
many, respectively, persisted
throughout the weeks leading up to
the conference.

In an op-ed that ran in the Daily
Pennsylvanian, University of Penn
sylvania President Amy Gutmann
declared that the University has,
"repeatedly, consistently and force
fully expressed" its opposition to
the BDS campaign's goals. She
added that, "just because we dis
agreeâ€” in this case strongly and
deeply with a group's message
does not mean that they lose their
right to voice that message."
Noah Feit, president of Penn
Friends of Israel, said in an inter
view with The Daily that BDS
speakers made some "legitimate"
points and that free speech should
prevail, but criticized the confer
ence's lack of policy prescriptions
and his perception of a dependence
on fringe support.
"Every political issue has to be de
bated," said Ania Loomba, an Eng
lish professor at Penn, to The Daily
Pennsylvanian. "If you just out-of
hand dismiss it, that's also shutting
down the debate."
