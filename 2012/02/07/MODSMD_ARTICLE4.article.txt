## SPER extends divestment push 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Students for Palestinian Equal Rights
(SPER) has continued its divestment campaign on
and beyond campus in recent weeks, most notably
sending delegates to a national conference on the
issue in Philadelphia this past weekend.
The divestment campaign seeks to encourage
Stanford to cease further and prevent new
endowment investment in companies that are
"profiting from the Israeli occupation [of Pales
tine]," according to SPER founder and co-presi
dent Omar Shakir 'O7, a current Stanford law stu
dent.
"Divestment has been recognized as the most
effective, moral, non-violent method of effectuat
ing change, especially within the context of human
rights abuses," Shakir said. He added that divest
ment allows students to address the Middle East
ern conflict actively.
While acknowledging that Stanford, as a pri
vate university, is not obliged to and does not
disclose its endowment investments, Shakir
noted a Stanford policy of not investing in compa
nies that cause "substantial social injury" as a basis
for SPER's appeals to the University.
Shakir cited student-prompted divestment
from apartheid South Africa as a model that
SPER is seeking to emulate. More recently, Stan
ford divested from Sinopec and PetroChina in

2005 after the companies' association with the
Darfur conflict, and in 2010, the University adopt
ed an ethical investment policy in regards to con
flict minerals as a response to the ongoing conflict
in the Congo.
SPER's campaign seeks divestment from eight
companies that, SPER alleges, violate human
rights by operating on Israeli-occupied settle
ments, enabling collective punishment, facilitating
the construction of the barrier separating Israeli
and Palestinian territories and supporting institu
tional discrimination. The eight companies listed
are Ahava, Caterpillar, Lockheed Martin, Meko
rot. Motorola, Riwal,Roadstone Holdings andVe
olia Transportation.
While the extent to which the University's en
dowment is currently invested in the eight compa
nies if at all is unknown, Shakir said mem
bers of the University's Advisoiy Panel on Invest
ment Responsibility have noted that at least some
ongoing investment in the eight firms is likely, con
sidering the endowment's vast scale,
Shakir said he is largely optimistic about the
degree of community support for the SPER cam
paign, noting that a petition first circulated in 2007
garnered more than 1,000 signatures from stu
dents, faculty, alumni and University affiliates. A
revised petition that has been recently circulated
currently has approximately 200 signatures, Shakir
