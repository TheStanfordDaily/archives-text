## Linebacker arrested on DUI charge Shayne Skov booked and transported to San Jose main jail Jan. 29 
### BILLY GALLAGHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Star linebacker Shayne Skov 'l3 was trans
ported to the San Jose main jail and bookedfor
driving under the influence at 2 a.m. Sunday,
Jan. 29, according to a report by the Stanford
University Department of Public Safety
(SUDPS).
"We have an expected standard of excel
lence and conduct for our football players and
Shayne failed to adhere to those standards,"
head football coach David Shaw said Monday
in a statement tolhe Daily through Jim Young,
senior assistant athletic director of communica
tions and media relations.
"It's a matter we are taking very seriously,"
Shaw said. "Shayne will be responsible to ad
here to any legal responsibilities regarding this
event, along with internal ramifications, which
will be determined by the program."
Young declined to comment on how this in
cident may affect Skov's standing with the
team.
The SUDPS incident report named Skov as
the arrestee and noted that the incident oc
curred at "Blackwelder Court @ Escondido
Road," which is near Skov's on-campus resi
dence.
The junior inside linebacker led the team in
tackles in the 2010 season, despite missing the
first two games due to injury. He recorded 12
tackles and three sacks against Virginia Tech in
Stanford's Orange Bowl victory in Jan. 2011.
Skov had 19 tackles and two sacks in just two
and a half games this past fall before injuring his
knee and missing the rest of the season.
Frequently described by teammates and
media as the soul of the defense, Skov made
pre-season watch lists for several awards, in
cluding the Bednarik Award and NagurskiTro
phy, both of which honor the best defensive
player in college football, and for the Butkus
Award, which rewards the best linebacker in
the country. Skov also earned a Pac-12 Confer
ence All-Academic honorable mention in
2011, meaning he maintains at least a cumula
tive 3.0 CPA.
SUDPS spokesman Bill Larson said that
Skov's case is in the process of being referred by
SUDPS to the Palo Alto District Attorney's of
fice. The Palo Alto District Attorney's office
could not be reached for comment at the time
of publication.
Recent history has shown that Stanford has
not shied away from suspending or dismissing
key players on championship caliber teams.
In 2007, forward Brook Lopez was sus
pended indefinitely from the men's basketball
team after being ruled academically ineligible
by the NCAA. Lopez missed nine games be
fore returning later that season. He was select
ed 10th overall that spring by the New Jersey
Nets in the 2008 NBA draft.
In Oct. 2009, shooting guard Jeremy Green
was suspended indefinitely from the men's bas
ketball team after being arrested and spending
a night in jail for suspicion of felony domestic vi
olence. No charges were filed, and Green was
reinstated just one day before the start of the
2009 season. Green went on to forego his sen
ior season and was not selected in the 2011
NBA draft.
In 2010, point guard JJ Hones was dis
missed from the women's basketball team after
being arrested for driving under the influence,
reckless driving, evading a police officer and re
sisting arrest on Stanford's campus. Hones was
dismissed just one month after the women's
team lost the national championship game to
Connecticut.
These incidents stand out among
recent history of Stanford Athletics.
A 2010 Sports Illustrated-CBS News
investigation ran criminal back
ground checks on the players in every
top-25 Division I football program, as
ranked by Sports Illustrated during
the preseason. The University of
Pittsburgh led the list with 22 players
on its roster found to have police
records, while Stanford came in sec
ond to last with only one player with
a police record. Texas Christian Uni
versity (TCU) was the only top-25
school with no players with police
records
Three other Pac-10 schools were
in the top-25 at the time of the inves
tigation: Oregon (seven players),
USC (seven) and Oregon State
(four). Utah (five) was not in the Pac
-10 at the time of the investigation, but
is now a member of the Pac-12,
formed in 2011.
Stanford's linebackers are likely
to be one of the strongest units on the
team next season, with Skov and red
shirt junior Chase Thomas attracting
serious NFL attention.
ESPN NFL Draft analyst Mel
Kiper rated Skov as the No. 3 senior
inside linebacker for next year, writ
ing, "Skov is an interesting prospect,
and if he's fully healthy the Stanford
defense is going to be quite good."

In 2007, forward Brook Lopez was sus
pended indefinitely from the men's basketball
team after being ruled academically ineligible
by the NCAA. Lopez missed nine games be
fore returning later that season. He was select
ed 10th overall that spring by the New Jersey
Nets in the 2008 NBA draft.
In Oct. 2009, shooting guard Jeremy Green
was suspended indefinitely from the men's bas
ketball team after being arrested and spending
a night in jail for suspicion of felony domestic vi
olence. No charges were filed, and Green was
reinstated just one day before the start of the
2009 season. Green went on to forego his sen
ior season and was not selected in the 2011
NBA draft.
In 2010, point guard JJ Hones was dis
missed from the women's basketball team after
being arrested for driving under the influence,
reckless driving, evading a police officer and re
sisting arrest on Stanford's campus. Hones was
dismissed just one month after the women's
team lost the national championship game to
Connecticut.
These incidents stand out among
recent history of Stanford Athletics.
A 2010 Sports Illustrated-CBS News
investigation ran criminal back
ground checks on the players in every
top-25 Division I football program, as
ranked by Sports Illustrated during
the preseason. The University of
Pittsburgh led the list with 22 players
on its roster found to have police
records, while Stanford came in sec
ond to last with only one player with
a police record. Texas Christian Uni
versity (TCU) was the only top-25
school with no players with police
records
Three other Pac-10 schools were
in the top-25 at the time of the inves
tigation: Oregon (seven players),
USC (seven) and Oregon State
(four). Utah (five) was not in the Pac
-10 at the time of the investigation, but
is now a member of the Pac-12,
formed in 2011.
Stanford's linebackers are likely
to be one of the strongest units on the
team next season, with Skov and red
shirt junior Chase Thomas attracting
serious NFL attention.
ESPN NFL Draft analyst Mel
Kiper rated Skov as the No. 3 senior
inside linebacker for next year, writ
ing, "Skov is an interesting prospect,
and if he's fully healthy the Stanford
defense is going to be quite good."

Star linebacker Shayne Skov 'l3 was trans
ported to the San Jose main jail and bookedfor
driving under the influence at 2 a.m. Sunday,
Jan. 29, according to a report by the Stanford
University Department of Public Safety
(SUDPS).
"We have an expected standard of excel
lence and conduct for our football players and
Shayne failed to adhere to those standards,"
head football coach David Shaw said Monday
in a statement tolhe Daily through Jim Young,
senior assistant athletic director of communica
tions and media relations.
"It's a matter we are taking very seriously,"
Shaw said. "Shayne will be responsible to ad
here to any legal responsibilities regarding this
event, along with internal ramifications, which
will be determined by the program."
Young declined to comment on how this in
cident may affect Skov's standing with the
team.
The SUDPS incident report named Skov as
the arrestee and noted that the incident oc
curred at "Blackwelder Court @ Escondido
Road," which is near Skov's on-campus resi
dence.
The junior inside linebacker led the team in
tackles in the 2010 season, despite missing the
first two games due to injury. He recorded 12
tackles and three sacks against Virginia Tech in
Stanford's Orange Bowl victory in Jan. 2011.
Skov had 19 tackles and two sacks in just two
and a half games this past fall before injuring his
knee and missing the rest of the season.
Frequently described by teammates and
media as the soul of the defense, Skov made
pre-season watch lists for several awards, in
cluding the Bednarik Award and NagurskiTro
phy, both of which honor the best defensive
player in college football, and for the Butkus
Award, which rewards the best linebacker in
the country. Skov also earned a Pac-12 Confer
ence All-Academic honorable mention in
2011, meaning he maintains at least a cumula
tive 3.0 CPA.
SUDPS spokesman Bill Larson said that
Skov's case is in the process of being referred by
SUDPS to the Palo Alto District Attorney's of
fice. The Palo Alto District Attorney's office
could not be reached for comment at the time
of publication.
