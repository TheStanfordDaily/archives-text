## Stanford engineers use light to weld nanowires 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF Marshall Watkins 
A team of Stanford engineers developed a
new means of welding nanowires together,
using a simple blast of light to fuse the wires
into an electrically conductive mesh, accord
ing to a press release from the School of En
gineering.
The welding process employs the physics
of plasmonics, which is the interaction of light
and metal, to create a lattice of nanowires
without the risk of damage induced by heat
ing or pressing the wires into a mesh. Using

light allows the welding to automatically stop
once the nanowires are fused together, mini
mizing the risk of damage to the mesh.
The refined technique also causes no dam
age to the underlying material supporting the
mesh, and the precise heating in nanoscale
welding enables more control, speed and en
ergy efficiency.
The Stanford team's discovery has signifi
cant potential in fields such as video displays,
solar cells, LEDs and touch-screens. The
mesh formed by the fused nanowires offers
exceptional electrical throughput, low cost
and easy processing.
The new technique also allows mesh elec
trodes to be bound to flexible or transparent
plastics and polymers. The mesh will retain its
electrical properties even after the support

ing material is distorted, and could potential
ly be employed as an inexpensive window
coating generating solar power while dim
ming glare.
