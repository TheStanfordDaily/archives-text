### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
Newark, N.J. Mayor Cory Booker '9l M.A.
'92 will serve as the 2012 Commencement
speaker, the senior class presidents an
nounced Monday.

The announcement came after the senior
class presidents posted clues about the identi
ty of the Commencement speaker as part of a
guessing contest on the Class of 2012 Face
book page. The first three clues, which were
posted last Friday, mentioned Booker's birth
place in Washington, D.C., his status as a Stan
ford alumnus and his appearance in an Acad
emy Award-nominated movie.
Within 22 minutes, a senior had correctly
identified Booker. Later clues identified him
as a "Twitter power user" and referenced his

Rhodes scholar, and after attending
Oxford University, graduated from
Yale Law School in 1996.

Newark mayor against 16-year in
cumbent Sharpe James was the

year's Academy Award for Best
Documentary. While Booker lost
that year's election, he would win
the position in 2006 after James de
cided not to run for another term.

Currently serving his second
term as Newark mayor, Booker was

Oprah Winfrey wrote about Book
er in the magazine when he re

work reforming Newark schools, in
cluding raising $lOO million as the
result of a gift from Facebook
founder Mark Zuckerberg.
The senior class presidents also
announced that Hoover Institute
Senior Fellow Larry Diamond, se
lected by a survey of Stanford sen
