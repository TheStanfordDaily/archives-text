# Confronting face blindness
## 
### LESLIENGUYEN-OKWU DESK EDITOR 
During a polite conversa
tion in Stern dining hall,
Sceth Ramlagan 'l3 casu
ally asked for his neigh
bor's name. To his mild
surprise, he had already asked him be
fore nine different times. While
some people struggle to remember
names, Ramlagan can hardly recog
nize faces.
Born and raised in Trinidad and To
bago, Ramlagan suffers from
prosopagnosia, a disorder more com
monly known as face blindness. The
disorder is an impairment of the abili
ty to identify and remember faces. Ac
cording to a German study from the
American Journal of Medical Genetics
in 2006, it is estimated that one in 50
people suffer from at least a mild form
of prosopagnosia.
Additionally, Ramlagan has been
diagnosed with autism. The combina
tion of autism and prosopagnosia has
created a unique set of circumstances
for him to cope with throughout his
life, forcing him to teach himself the
basic social cues most people take for
granted. Ramlagan said he learned
how to socialize using books, including
Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends
and Influence People."
"Many people don't necessarily de
tect that I have my high-functioning
autism just off the bat, but I do get re
marks that I am very strange," Ramla
gan said.
The sense of being an outsider has
not deterred him from interacting with
others. He hugs dormmates and
friends when they approach him and
occasionally signs his emails with
"Huggles, Scethy Poo." While part of
his gregariousness may be due to the
fact that he does not notice social
boundaries, Ramlagan often purpose
fully supersedes these boundaries as
an intentional act of friendship.

"I smile a lot and I'm nice," Ramla
gan said. "I'm not defensive, I ask peo
ple about themselves. I try to paint
things in terms of other people's inter
ests as opposed to my own. I use inclu
sive language like 'we.' It may be im
portant to recognize that, for me, there
is no difference between genuinely
wanting to do these things and just per
forming them. I am as sincere as I act."
Although he can recognize the shape
of a face and other objects, Ramlagan
cannot recognize a face's distinct fea
tures. To compensate, he instead memo
rizes others' visual cues, such as manner
isms, voice and even style of dress.
"One of the things that having
prosopagnosia ... develops is a sense
of knowing how other people act phys
ically," Ramlagan said. "I can tell when
someone's style of dress has changed,
and if I recognize you by your style of
dress and not your face, which is often
easier to learn, then I may simply not
recognize you when you change what
you're wearing."
Ramlagan credits his social and
communication skills to his upbringing.
As a child, Ramlagan learned from his
mother, who painstakingly taught him
the fundamentals of social interaction.
"When I was small, my mom beat
the practice of looking people in the
eye into me," Ramlagan said. "Eye
gaze is not necessarily something that
comes naturally to an autistic person.
It was a habit that was enforced with
corporal punishment. So I do look peo
ple in the eye out of very entrenched
habit."
In some ways, Ramlagan is grateful
for his family and community back
home. However, the environment he
grew up in was not conducive to his ac
ademic interests in mathematics. In ad
dition to his autism and face blindness,
Ramlagan had to overcome the hard
ships associated with being a low-in
come student.
"My academic drive is hardly moti
vated or a consequence of the people I
grew up around or the family I was in,"

Ramlagan said. "It would have been
probably discouraged given my up
bringing and socioeconomic class."
"I grew up in a particularly anti-in
tellectual milieu in a small village," he
added. "I liked books much more than
I liked people, I only decided to start
talking to people when I was 15."
Ramlagan's passion for math came
out of his love for learning and reading
books, something he continues to do at
Stanford. He hopes to finish his major
in mathematics and possibly minor in
music.
Ramlagan cited a quote by mathe
matician Dean Schlicter as a descrip
tion of his love for math: "Go down
deep enough into anything and you
will find mathematics."
"That is what fuels my attraction to
mathematics," Ramlagan said. "I spent
most of my time on [math] for a lot of
years, and I'm just doing it to enjoy my
self. Math is one of those few things
you can do with just paper and pen, or
often just nothing at all."
Though face blindness and autism
play formative roles in his life, these
conditions do not define Ramlagan. In
fact, he explained, he wouldn't have it
any other way.
"I wouldn't say I'm just an autistic
person," Ramlagan said. "But in the
metrics that I have come to value, I
would say my life would be worse
[without it]. I'm glad to have it. I've
never felt a need to be like other peo
ple."
Over time, Ramlagan has come to
appreciate his autism and face blind
ness as learning experiences. He uses
his struggles to inform his empathy to
ward others, especially those with so
cially debilitating disorders.
"It may have played a critical role in
making me what I am, but I do not ro
manticize it," Ramlagan said. "I don't
idolize it. I don't think of it as some
thing to which I should be faithful."

isms, voice and even style of dress.
"One of the things that having
prosopagnosia ... develops is a sense
of knowing how other people act phys
ically," Ramlagan said. "I can tell when
someone's style of dress has changed,
and if I recognize you by your style of
dress and not your face, which is often
easier to learn, then I may simply not
recognize you when you change what
you're wearing."
Ramlagan credits his social and
communication skills to his upbringing.
As a child, Ramlagan learned from his
mother, who painstakingly taught him
the fundamentals of social interaction.
"When I was small, my mom beat
the practice of looking people in the
eye into me," Ramlagan said. "Eye
gaze is not necessarily something that
comes naturally to an autistic person.
It was a habit that was enforced with
corporal punishment. So I do look peo
ple in the eye out of very entrenched
habit."
In some ways, Ramlagan is grateful
for his family and community back
home. However, the environment he
grew up in was not conducive to his ac
ademic interests in mathematics. In ad
dition to his autism and face blindness,
Ramlagan had to overcome the hard
ships associated with being a low-in
come student.
"My academic drive is hardly moti
vated or a consequence of the people I
grew up around or the family I was in,"

Ramlagan said. "It would have been
probably discouraged given my up
bringing and socioeconomic class."
"I grew up in a particularly anti-in
tellectual milieu in a small village," he
added. "I liked books much more than
I liked people, I only decided to start
talking to people when I was 15."
Ramlagan's passion for math came
out of his love for learning and reading
books, something he continues to do at
Stanford. He hopes to finish his major
in mathematics and possibly minor in
music.
Ramlagan cited a quote by mathe
matician Dean Schlicter as a descrip
tion of his love for math: "Go down
deep enough into anything and you
will find mathematics."
"That is what fuels my attraction to
mathematics," Ramlagan said. "I spent
most of my time on [math] for a lot of
years, and I'm just doing it to enjoy my
self. Math is one of those few things
you can do with just paper and pen, or
often just nothing at all."
Though face blindness and autism
play formative roles in his life, these
conditions do not define Ramlagan. In
fact, he explained, he wouldn't have it
any other way.
"I wouldn't say I'm just an autistic
person," Ramlagan said. "But in the
metrics that I have come to value, I
would say my life would be worse
[without it]. I'm glad to have it. I've
never felt a need to be like other peo
ple."
Over time, Ramlagan has come to
appreciate his autism and face blind
ness as learning experiences. He uses
his struggles to inform his empathy to
ward others, especially those with so
cially debilitating disorders.
"It may have played a critical role in
making me what I am, but I do not ro
manticize it," Ramlagan said. "I don't
idolize it. I don't think of it as some
thing to which I should be faithful."

During a polite conversa
tion in Stern dining hall,
Sceth Ramlagan 'l3 casu
ally asked for his neigh
bor's name. To his mild
surprise, he had already asked him be
fore nine different times. While
some people struggle to remember
names, Ramlagan can hardly recog
nize faces.
Born and raised in Trinidad and To
bago, Ramlagan suffers from
prosopagnosia, a disorder more com
monly known as face blindness. The
disorder is an impairment of the abili
ty to identify and remember faces. Ac
cording to a German study from the
American Journal of Medical Genetics
in 2006, it is estimated that one in 50
people suffer from at least a mild form
of prosopagnosia.
Additionally, Ramlagan has been
diagnosed with autism. The combina
tion of autism and prosopagnosia has
created a unique set of circumstances
for him to cope with throughout his
life, forcing him to teach himself the
basic social cues most people take for
granted. Ramlagan said he learned
how to socialize using books, including
Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends
and Influence People."
"Many people don't necessarily de
tect that I have my high-functioning
autism just off the bat, but I do get re
marks that I am very strange," Ramla
gan said.
The sense of being an outsider has
not deterred him from interacting with
others. He hugs dormmates and
friends when they approach him and
occasionally signs his emails with
"Huggles, Scethy Poo." While part of
his gregariousness may be due to the
fact that he does not notice social
boundaries, Ramlagan often purpose
fully supersedes these boundaries as
an intentional act of friendship.

"I smile a lot and I'm nice," Ramla
gan said. "I'm not defensive, I ask peo
ple about themselves. I try to paint
things in terms of other people's inter
ests as opposed to my own. I use inclu
sive language like 'we.' It may be im
portant to recognize that, for me, there
is no difference between genuinely
wanting to do these things and just per
forming them. I am as sincere as I act."
Although he can recognize the shape
of a face and other objects, Ramlagan
cannot recognize a face's distinct fea
tures. To compensate, he instead memo
rizes others' visual cues, such as manner
isms, voice and even style of dress.
"One of the things that having
prosopagnosia ... develops is a sense
of knowing how other people act phys
ically," Ramlagan said. "I can tell when
someone's style of dress has changed,
and if I recognize you by your style of
dress and not your face, which is often
easier to learn, then I may simply not
