## 
### â€“ Erika Alvero Koski 
Matt Olson 'l4, a Daily copy editor, pro
gressed to the semifinals of the "Jeop
ardy!" College Championship after win
ning his quarterfinal game, which aired
Feb. 6.The symbolic systems major com
peted in the televised round against Monica Thieu from
the University of North Texas and Zach McDonnell
from the College of William and Mary. The prize for the
final round of the college championship is $lOO,OOO.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did you get to be a
"Jeopardy!" contestant?
Matt Olson (MO): I took an online test in the spring of
last year that was 50 questions [long]. People who do
well on that [test] get a call, so Jeopardy! called in Octo
ber for me to go to L.A. The other contestants and I
took a test with another 50 questions and then played a
mock game, just to make sure we could talk on TV.
TSD: Why did you want to be a contestant?
MO: Well, I 've always been a fan of "Jeopardy!". I start
ed watching when I was six or seven, and Ken Jennings
[74-time "Jeopardy!" winner] was my hero. I tried out
for it in high school, but this was the first time I got
called.
TSD: How did you prepare for the competition?
MO: I didn't really do anything special. Because there
are so many categories, you have to acquire the knowl
edge throughout your life. I did memorize world capi
tals, though.
TSD: Did you get to talk to Alex Trebek? What was he
like?
MO: Contestants actually aren't allowed to talk to him
outside of the awkward interview segment and post
game talk, but we did learn that he drives a white pick
up truck. Also, when the crew counts down right before
the game begins, he makes weird facial movements and
"woop" noises to warm up.
TSD: Did you have a strategy for this round?
MO: 1 ... had planned a few things, but once you get up
there you forget that! I wanted to bet a lot of money on
the Daily Doubles, to build up a lead. I wanted more
than double my opponents' scores going into Final
Jeopardy! because no one knows what's going to hap
pen then.
TSD: Did you get to talk to the other competitors?
MO: Yeah, they were cool. On the day of taping we got
to know each other a bit when we were all hanging out,
getting make-up put on and signing contracts in the
green room. Beforehand, we do a rehearsal game, and
after the tournament we had a little party.
TSD: What was your favorite category?
MO: I liked the math one, and the women's sports. Not
so much the dog one.
Olson will next appear in the college Jeopardy! semi
finals Friday, Feb. 10, at 7 p.m.
