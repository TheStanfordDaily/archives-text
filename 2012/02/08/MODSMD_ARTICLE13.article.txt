## EDITORIAL Rethinking STEM education at Stanford 
### 
In November of last year, the New
York Times published an article
attempting to answer the ques
tion of "why science majors change
their minds." The author cited the
results of a UCLA-led study that
found that across the nation, fresh
men originally intending to major in
engineering or follow the pre-med
route switch to non-STEM majors at
alarmingly high rates.
Almost invariably, Stanford stu
dents know at least a few peers who
changed their minds about being a
chemist or engineer after taking in
organic chemistry, linear algebra or
some other difficult introductory
class. Indeed, the author of the
Times piece concludes that attri
tion rates in engineering and sci
ences are higher than those in other
disciplines, because STEM classes
are "so darn hard." While true to an
extent, we do not think this accu
rately portrays the whole picture.
Take the introductory sequence
in computer science at Stanford,
for instance (CS 106A and B/X).
According to Course√üank, the av
erage grade and hours of work per
week in these classes are compara
ble to introductory classes in other
STEM fields.
If, as the Times article suggests,
high attrition rates are due to the
rigor of such classes, we would ex
pect Stanford freshmen intending
to major in computer science to
change their minds as often as
their peers in other STEM fields.
But the opposite seems to be the
case; from many accounts, the in
troductory CS sequence actually
attracts students to the major who,
prior to Stanford, had scarcely en
tertained the thought of being a
programmer. Is computer science
simply a more interesting subject
than, say, mechanical engineering?
Perhaps. But this Board believes
that variations in attrition rates
among similarly rigorous STEM
disciplines are more a result of dif
ferences in the presentation of
course content and its application
in homework.
In a landmark piece on engineer
ing education, chemical engineer
ing professor and STEM-educa
tion expert Richard Felder argues
that induction also called in
quiry or discovery learning is
the most effective me thod of teach
ing applied science to undergradu
ates. An example of inductive
learning, defined broadly, is the
trial and error in designing a com
puter program to complete a cer
tain task; over time, the student
learns which approaches work and
utilizes these effective practices

when confronted with similar
problems in the future. According
to Felder, this type of learning leads
to "increased academic achieve
ment and enhanced abstract rea
soning skills; longer retention of in
formation; and improved ability to
apply principles" (among other
benefits). According to Worcester
Polytechnic Institute, incorporat
ing inductive learning into its fresh
man year curriculum has served to
"hook" its students into STEM ma
jors.
We would hope, then, that induc
tive learning is fundamental to
Stanford's science and engineering
curriculums. On the contrary, it
seems that Stanford is more aligned
with what Felder labels the "tradi
tional college teaching method [of]
deduction, starting with "fundamen
tals' and proceeding to applica
tions." Although it is beyond the
scope of this editorial to study the
content of every STEM class at
Stanford, the standard problem set
model is certainly deductive; theory
presented in lecture must be ap
plied to solve homework problems
that generally have only one correct
solution. The inductive element is
often lacking.
Certainly, there are classes at
Stanford that incorporate an in
ductive approach to learning. In
troductory design and computer
science classes, for instance, assign
tangible problems where the de
sired result can be reached in vari
ous ways. It should come as no sur
prise that these classes tend to be
significantly more popular than
their purely deductive counter
parts.
Although focusing on technical
fundamentals is crucial to many
STEM classes, there are various
ways in which some aspect of in
ductive learning can be introduced.
This fusion, however, demands that
professors adopt less straightfor
ward methods of presenting the
material and, when formulating
homework, assign more than just
conventional textbook problems. It
is certainly no easy task for profes
sors, especially those with limited
formal training in education. Ac
cordingly, this Board recommends
that STEM departments work with
professors to incorporate more in
ductive elements in their course
work. It is imperative, especially in
disciplines that attempt to either
explain the world or design solu
tions to improve it, that classes at
Stanford and across the nation en
gage students in truly understand
ing what lies at the heart of these
disciplines.
