# BURSTING THE BUBBLE
## The 						teenager who changed hockey 
### Edward Ngai 
This week marks two years
since the tragic car-accident
death of Brendan Burke, son
of Toronto Maple Leafs general
manager Brian Burke and a stu
dent video assistant for the Miami
University (Ohio) hockey team.
Brendan also happened to be
gay
it wasn't an easy environment
for him. Canada is a country where
hockey is the national religion, the
Toronto Maple Leafs its holiest
shrine. Team general managers, es
pecially those running the center
of the hockey world, are celebri
ties.
And the Canadian hockey
world spins a certain way. Grit.
Testosterone. Pugilism. The coun
try is indelibly infused with "hock
ey culture," a quite unexplainable
mix of honor, toughness and man
hood. Brian Burke, himself not a fi
nessed goal scorer, was a career
minor leaguer who kept himself
relevant through toughness. When
he built teams as a general manag
er, he described them as "trucu
lent." You knew when a Brian
Burke team was on the ice: you'd
feel the pain.
The homophobic atmosphere
in many locker rooms is common
knowledge. There is no room for a
gay man there certainly not in
hockey, where machismo courses
through the identity of the sport,
and certainly not for the son of the
ultimate hockey alpha-male.
Yet when Brendan Burke very
publicly came out at age 19 in an
ESPN article, he was roundly, if
hesitantly, embraced. His hard
nosed father Brian, arguably the
toughest and most influential man
in hockey, stood at his side the
whole way.
It was uncomfortable at times.
The two received mixed reactions
when they did a joint interview be
tween periods of a nationally tele
vised hockey game. Some TV com
mentators were visibly disquieted
discussing it. Even James Duthie,

an award-winning anchor on
Canadian national sports network
TSN, fumbled the word "gay,"
which got stuck in his throat like it
does every time one tries to come
out of the closet.
But the issue remains. Gay men
play professional sports. Gay men
are in the NHL. And yet the most
prominent openly gay figure in
hockey is the son of a general man
ager. No active professional ath
lete from the four major American
leagues has come out of the closet.
And professional sports can hard
ly be considered a bastion of ac
ceptance for gays and lesbians.
Leßron James has gone on the
record saying that "if you're gay
and not admitting that you are,
then you are not trustworthy."
Braves pitching coach Roger Mc-
Dowell was suspended for slurs
and lewd gestures at fans. Kobe
Bryant was fined $lOO,OOO last
spring for dropping a homophobic
f-bomb on camera.
But what would or wouldn't
have happened if the TNT cam
eras didn't happen to be pointing
at Kobe? Aren't these remarks
tossed around all the time? They
certainly haven't been scarce in the
high school locker rooms I've been
in.
Surprisingly, it is the NHL, the
most homogeneous sports league
in America, a community steeped
in inflexible and time-honored tra
ditions, which is leading the charge
against homophobia in sports.
New York Rangers forward Sean
Avery has partnered with the
Human Rights Campaign to pub
licly advocate for same-sex mar
riage. The gruff, hard-nosed Brian
Burke marched in two gay pride
parades. And former Blackhawks
defenseman Brent Sopel spent his
one day with the Stanley Cup,
viewed in Canada with a reverence
befitting the Holy Grail, not in his
hometown, but at the Chicago Gay
Pride Parade.
As the hockey world turns, so

too does the country that lives for
it. Canada's most revered sports
figures, from Burke to outspoken
(and famously conservative) com
mentator Don Cherry, have, with
varying degrees of enthusiasm, de
nounced homophobia in sports.
In a country where gay mar
riage is politically uncontroversial,
the last hurdle for acceptance re
mains in sports, which, in the Cana
dian psyche, is very little more than
ice hockey.
And as hockey players began to
realize they must change from their
self-admitted homophobic culture,
so has the country that looks up to
their hockey stars like they do the
real ones.
To think it all began with one
brave story from a 19-year-old
video assistant.
"Sports isn't all homophobic...
there are plenty of people in sports
who accept people for who they
are," Brendan said, urging young
gay athletes to keep hold of their
dreams.
Wise words from an inspira
tional young man who was taken
from us too soon.

This week marks two years
since the tragic car-accident
death of Brendan Burke, son
of Toronto Maple Leafs general
manager Brian Burke and a stu
dent video assistant for the Miami
University (Ohio) hockey team.
Brendan also happened to be
gay
it wasn't an easy environment
for him. Canada is a country where
hockey is the national religion, the
Toronto Maple Leafs its holiest
shrine. Team general managers, es
pecially those running the center
of the hockey world, are celebri
ties.
And the Canadian hockey
world spins a certain way. Grit.
Testosterone. Pugilism. The coun
try is indelibly infused with "hock
ey culture," a quite unexplainable
mix of honor, toughness and man
hood. Brian Burke, himself not a fi
nessed goal scorer, was a career
minor leaguer who kept himself
relevant through toughness. When
he built teams as a general manag
er, he described them as "trucu
lent." You knew when a Brian
Burke team was on the ice: you'd
feel the pain.
The homophobic atmosphere
in many locker rooms is common
knowledge. There is no room for a
gay man there certainly not in
hockey, where machismo courses
through the identity of the sport,
and certainly not for the son of the
ultimate hockey alpha-male.
Yet when Brendan Burke very
publicly came out at age 19 in an
ESPN article, he was roundly, if
hesitantly, embraced. His hard
nosed father Brian, arguably the
toughest and most influential man
in hockey, stood at his side the
whole way.
It was uncomfortable at times.
The two received mixed reactions
when they did a joint interview be
tween periods of a nationally tele
vised hockey game. Some TV com
mentators were visibly disquieted
discussing it. Even James Duthie,

an award-winning anchor on
Canadian national sports network
TSN, fumbled the word "gay,"
which got stuck in his throat like it
does every time one tries to come
out of the closet.
But the issue remains. Gay men
play professional sports. Gay men
are in the NHL. And yet the most
prominent openly gay figure in
hockey is the son of a general man
ager. No active professional ath
lete from the four major American
leagues has come out of the closet.
And professional sports can hard
ly be considered a bastion of ac
ceptance for gays and lesbians.
Leßron James has gone on the
record saying that "if you're gay
and not admitting that you are,
then you are not trustworthy."
Braves pitching coach Roger Mc-
Dowell was suspended for slurs
and lewd gestures at fans. Kobe
Bryant was fined $lOO,OOO last
spring for dropping a homophobic
f-bomb on camera.
But what would or wouldn't
have happened if the TNT cam
eras didn't happen to be pointing
at Kobe? Aren't these remarks
tossed around all the time? They
certainly haven't been scarce in the
high school locker rooms I've been
