## Sorry, I can't get your kid into Stanford! 
### Ravali Reddy 
I live for winter break, that re
freshing breath of cold air at
the end of fall quarter. It's so
much better than Thanksgiving
break because the guilt of know
ing that there is work to be done
doesn't exist. It's long enough for
me to remember why I missed my
family, but not quite long enough
for me to remember why I was
looking forward to college. Winter
break and I have our own person
al love affair every year.
However, despite my desire to
sleep all day and re-watch "The
Office," my parents always feel
the need to take me out in public
when I'm home. Birthday parties,
office parties, Christmas parties
â€”if it takes place during the
three weeks that I happen to be
present, my mother insists that I
attend. So I plaster on my biggest
smile, put on my nicest sweater
and head out with the family.
I've been attending these gath
erings since I was a kid, and they
usually consist of the same rou
tine: various adults I've known
since birth walk over, hug me
while exclaiming how much taller
I have gotten (which is fooling no
one I've grown half an inch in
the last four years) and then
quickly lapse into talking to my
parents about work or what hap
pened on the last episode of "Ram
Milaayi Jodi" (quite possibly the
worst, and most addicting, Indian
soap opera in the world).

The moment I started going to
Stanford though, all this changed.
Suddenly, people at parties would
approach my parents, slowly
broach the topic of Stanford in
order to confirm that I do indeed
go there and then shift over to me
while shouting, "You must meet
my son/daughter/offspring/pet!
They're applying to Stanford!"
Before I know it, I find myself
standing face to face with a clear
ly embarrassed high schooler,
with his or her overeager parent
hovering. Awkward introductions
ensue and then, the questions
start.
They usually start off simple
enough, questions about what I'm
majoring in and how I like the
campus, but it's obvious that this
isn't what they really care about.
The real Q&A begins when the
parents start to ask about my high
school career what extracur
ricular I participated in, whether
or not I took four consecutive
years of a language and what I got
on my SAT, you know, just out of
"curiosity." The adults take notes
and nudge their kids, and they
tend to end the conversation by
asking for my email.

Normally, the conversations
are harmless enough. They give
me a reason to blab on until the
party winds down and I can go
home to watch the episode where
Dwight's stapler winds up in Jello.
There's always one question I
dread though, and that's the mo
ment when the parent jokingly
looks at me and goes, "So, what's
your secret? How does one get
into Stanford?" See, here's the
problem: it's clearly not in jest;
this parent wants an answer, and
they're usually not pleased when I
tell them I don't have one.
I have yet to figure out what to
say to someone who wants to
know the secret to getting in. Ever
since I got my acceptance, every
one around me seems to think I
have all the answers. I've been
asked to review applications, read
personal statements and give ad
vice to kids I barely know. People
seem to think I'm hiding some
thing from them when I tell them
I'm not qualified to review their
kid's materials.

I'm not quite sure how to make
it clear that there is no surefire
recipe for getting into Stanford.
Coming here has only proven that
to me. I am vastly different from
my friends here. We have different
interests, come from different
backgrounds and are pursuing
different career paths, but at the
end of the day, we all go to Stan
ford.

Instead of boring my new audi
ence with my thoughts though,
I've settled for a much easier an
swer. I respond to the question
with a smile and the most cliched
line in the book: "Just be yourself.

I'm still not sure why I got in, but I
know that I'm happier at Stanford
than I would be anywhere else."
