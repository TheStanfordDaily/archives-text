## Searching for Stanford's next superstar 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
There's little doubt in my
mind that Tiger Woods has
never shown up for a tour
nament thinking he was
not the favorite. Sure, he
has had all sorts of setbacks ranging
from the mundane various swing
changes to the crazy winning
a U.S. Open on a stress fracture
to the insane allegedly cheating
on his now-ex-wife with upwards of
10 mistresses.
Through it all, however, Tiger re
mains Tiger. This week, he is just
down the coast in Pebble Beach
opening his 2012 PGA Tour cam
paign at the AT&T Pro-Am. It's the
first time he's played at Pebble since
the U.S. Open in 2010, and he hasn't
won on tour since 2009.
But man, does he look happy.
And that's good for the game of
golf Although Woods was recently
revealed to be one of America's
most disliked athletes coming in
just behind Michael Vick, with 60
percent of those polled disapprov
ing of both high-profile sports fig
ures â€” there is simply something

about the man that makes people
tune in to see him play.
In an individual sport that has
plenty of "stars" you might not
recognize if they were taking
your order at The Axe and Palm
Kyle Stanley, Spencer Levin,
every other golfer not named
Phil Tiger is the rock that an
chors the tour and allows the
other players to reap the benefits
when millions tune in.
After watching Tiger's press
conference yesterday when he
finally seemed to be emerging
from his shell and showing off the
same smile that captivated audi
ences while he fist-pumped his
way to victory after victory earli
er in his career I got to think
ing: when will Stanford turn out
the next superstar?
Will it be football player An
drew Luck? How about baseball
stars Mark Appel and Stephen
Piscotty? Might freshman swim
ming sensation David Nolan
have what it takes to captivate
audiences in an Olympic sport?
It's hard to say, particularly
because Tiger and John Elway
and stars like them often follow
very different paths to success.
Woods has yet to graduate
from Stanford but has main
tained that he will eventually
earn his degree to fulfill a prom
ise he made to his mother when
he left the Farm after two years in
1996.
Elway stayed all four years
and then took another four be
fore finally taking the Broncos to
a Super Bowl.
With the 24-hour ESPN news

cycle, Twitter and the constant ac
cess to athletes even at the colle
giate level, I think it could be a lit
tle while longer before we see the
next star emerge from the Farm.
Increasingly, the players who
make an instant impact in the
headlines and in the rarified air
of stardom are players who are
less mature and rawer than the
caliber of student-athlete I think
this school produces.
We don't have one-and-done
players on our basketball teams
(at least not since the Lopez
twins), and the baseball players
looking to make it to the Show
have all been here for at least
three years. The football guys
heading to the NFL are almost all
seniors set to walk across the
stage at Radio City Hall, but also
to shake President Hennessy's
hand at Commencement.
The players like Tiger are the
anomaly, which is why I think me
and other people flock to them
just like people went to watch
Justin Bieber when he was a
young unknown flipping his hair
and belting out pop songs.
And even with all that, maybe
Stanford's next superstar could
come from outside of the sports
world. It's probably more likely
that another Stanford grad will
end up as President before another
grad wins the Masters. And with all
the impressive people on this cam
pus, the next Stanford superstar
could even be you. As Justin Bieber
would say, "Never say never."

Only Miles Bennett-Smith would
think a two-time Heisman runner
up and future number one draft
pick doesn't count as "superstar
status." Tell him why you'll be the
biggest thing since Kanye at miles
