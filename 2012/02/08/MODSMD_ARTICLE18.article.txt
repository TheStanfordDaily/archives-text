## Football assistant Anderson named nation's top recruiter 
### â€“ Jacob Jaffe 
Less than a week after welcoming
the best recruiting class in team history,
the Stanford football program was hon
ored for its efforts, as assistant coach
Lance Anderson was named the Na
tional Recruiter of the Year by
Scout/FOXSportsNext.
Anderson, who coaches outside
linebackers, took on the role of recruit
ing coordinator after that position was
vacated by Brian Polian in January. De
spite Polian's departure for Texas
A&M, Stanford had anything but a
drop-off, in large part thanks to Ander
son.
Head coach David Shaw empha
sized that Polian's departure would not
derail the team's recruiting efforts,
telling ESPN.com, "Losing Brian does
hurt because he was a good recruiter,
but he wasn't recruiting everybody ...
Lance has the best relationship with
our admissions people as far as making
sure these kids are taking the classes
and finishing strong and re-taking tests,
etc."
Since coming to Stanford from the
Jim Harbaugh-coached University of
San Diego in 2007, Anderson has been
the team's liaison to the admissions of
fice and has held various recruiting po
sitions in addition to his work on the
defensive side of the ball.
Anderson's work helped the Cardi
nal bring in the nation's sixth-best re
cruiting class according to Scout.com,
including five-star linemen Andrus
Peat, Joshua Garnett and Kyle Murphy,
five-star defensive lineman Aziz Shittu
and several four-star recruits, including
running back Barry J. Sanders and line
backer Noor Davis. Stanford was able
to draw several high-profile recruits
away from rivals like Cal and USC,
helping the Cardinal notch the best
class in the Pac-12.
