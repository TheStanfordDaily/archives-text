# Spring Game returns to San Francisco's Kezar Stadium
## 
### â€“ Jack Blanchat 
For the third year in a row, the Stan
ford football team will take its annual
Cardinal and White Spring Game on
the road to the city by the bay.
On Saturday, April 14, the Cardinal
will wrap up its spring practice schedule
with a contest at San Francisco's his
toric Kezar Stadium.
Last season, the Andrew Luck-led
Cardinal squad blew out the White
team 42-3 in front of over 6,000 fans, but
this year's contest should be compelling
for entirely different reasons like
finding out which quarterback is most
likely to replace Luck as the starter.
The competition for Luck's spot, as
well as 10 other starting spots on both
sides of the ball, will conclude at Kezar
after the Cardinal's spring practices.
Stanford will split its workouts into two
sessions, with the first seven workouts
beginning February 27 and ending
March 10. The Cardinal will resume
workouts after finals and spring break
on April 2 and wrap up the spring on
April 14 in San Francisco.
