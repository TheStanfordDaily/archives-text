## Ghonim analyzes uprisings in Egypt 
### MARWA FARAG MANAGING EDITOR 
Egyptian revolutionary Wael
Ghonim spoke Tuesday on the sit
uation in Egypt one year after the
uprisings that toppled former
President Hosni Mubarak.
Ghonim was joined on the
speaker panel by history profes
sor Joel Beinin and Dr. Ossama
Hassanein, chair of the board at
TechWadi, a Silicon Valley-based
nonprofit that promotes entrepre
neurship in the Middle East. All
three expressed optimism about
developments in Egypt.
Moderator Omar Shakir 'O7
J.D. 'l3 highlighted the timeliness
of the event in his introduction.
The talk marked exactly one year

since Ghonim's release from a 12-
day detention by Egyptian state
security during the early 2011 up
risings, and a little more than one
year since the beginning of
protests on Jan. 25.
"It's a time to reflect back on
the accomplishments of the
Egyptian people, reflect on where
we are today and how we can look
forward," Shakir said.
Beinin spoke first, highlighting
two main changes Egypt has expe
rienced over the past year.
"The most important thing ...
which cannot be reversed is that
the Egyptian people recovered
[their] voice and ... dignity," he
said.
