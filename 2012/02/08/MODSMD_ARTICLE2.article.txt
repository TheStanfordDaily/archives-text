## Ghonim analyzes uprisings in Egypt 
### MARWA FARAG MANAGING EDITOR 
Egyptian revolutionary Wael
Ghonim spoke Tuesday on the sit
uation in Egypt one year after the
uprisings that toppled former
President Hosni Mubarak.
Ghonim was joined on the
speaker panel by history profes
sor Joel Beinin and Dr. Ossama
Hassanein, chair of the board at
TechWadi, a Silicon Valley-based
nonprofit that promotes entrepre
neurship in the Middle East. All
three expressed optimism about
developments in Egypt.
Moderator Omar Shakir 'O7
J.D. 'l3 highlighted the timeliness
of the event in his introduction.
The talk marked exactly one year

since Ghonim's release from a 12-
day detention by Egyptian state
security during the early 2011 up
risings, and a little more than one
year since the beginning of
protests on Jan. 25.
"It's a time to reflect back on
the accomplishments of the
Egyptian people, reflect on where
we are today and how we can look
forward," Shakir said.
Beinin spoke first, highlighting
two main changes Egypt has expe
rienced over the past year.
"The most important thing ...
which cannot be reversed is that
the Egyptian people recovered
[their] voice and ... dignity," he
said.

Egyptian revolutionary Wael Ghonim spoke Tuesday evening one year
after his release from a 12-day detention by Egyptian state security. He
was joined by professor Joel Beinin and Dr. Ossama Hassanein.
The second change, he said,
was the repudiation of the idea
that Egypt and the Arab world
face a "democracy deficit."

Beinin named four forces on
the ground that he believes will
determine the outcome in Egypt:
the Facebook youth, liberals, the
oppositional middle class intelli
gentsia and the workers, whom
he believes are an overlooked
force in the balance of power.
Behind these four forces stands
the U.S. government, Beinin
added.

"I am very much a believer in
the notion that we have had a
revolutionary upsurge in Egypt;
we haven't yet had a revolution,"
Beinin said. "In the next few
months . . . keep your seatbelts
strapped it's going to be a
very rough and, I think, exhila
rating ride."
Ghonim stressed the impor
tance of optimism when looking
at the situation in Egypt, despite
recent events such as the Feb. 1
Port Said football riots, which left
74 dead.

"I see [that] despite all the
challenges ... we have to look at
what's happening from a positive
side," Ghonim said. "We have
achieved a lot."
Ghonim also addressed the
domination of Islamist parties in
parliamentary elections, empha
sizing that he had "full respect"
for the results of the democratic
elections.

"I personally [took] to the
street not to replace a dictator
with another one," he said. "I be
lieve Egyptians have been denied
the right to choose whoever gov
erns them."

"Egypt is going to have a
bright future if we all unite, forget
our differences and have the

Tahrir Square spirit that we are all
one," he added.
Hassanein delivered a person
al, patriotic narrative of Egyptian
history. He credited Ghonim with
uniting the youth and creating a
revolution that gave "the power
back to the people."
"We have toppled the regime;
now we need to clean up the
mess," he said. Hassanein closed
on a message as optimistic as that
of Beinin and Ghonim: "What
does not kill us makes us stronger
... Egypt will rise."

Audience members posed
questions on the transition peri
od, the role of the Supreme Coun
cil of the Armed Forces (SCAF),
education and social media.

"The discussion signaled dis
comfort with the dominant role of
the SCAF in Egypt today, and the
need to end the era of military
rule that Egypt has been under
for decades," wrote Lina Khatib,
program manager for the Pro
gram on Arab Reform and
Democracy at the Center for
Democracy, Development and
the Rule of Law, in an email to
The Daily. "However, what was
missing from the debate was the
method and mechanism through
which Egypt's youth aim to
achieve this."
"Ghonim hinted that the ac
tivists and the people are 'learn
ing democracy' through trial and
error ... but there remains an ad
ditional need for strategic politi
cal planning that is currently lack
ing," she added.
