# DIEKROEGER DUO
## Brothers look for breakout 2012 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Stanford has benefited from
its fair share of sisterly love re
cently, with the Ogwumikes dom
inating the hardwood, the up

and-coming Payne sisters emerg
ing on the soccer pitch and the
pitcher-catcher combination of
the Cardinal's two Gerhart
triplets ready to kick off another
softball season.
But with baseball season just
over a week away, it's a pair of
brothers that could help take the
No. 2 Stanford baseball team to
its next national title.
The Diekroeger brothers

junior shortstop Kenny and
sophomore infielder Danny
are both hoping to rebound from
somewhat underwhelming 2011
seasons. Kenny Diekroeger saw
his batting average fall 60 points
after a first-team All-Pac-10 per
formance in 2010 that also
earned him Freshman All-Amer
ica honors. Danny Diekroeger,
on the other hand, playing spar
ingly behind other members of

the Cardinal's top-ranked fresh
man class and appeared in only
19 games.
With a top-10 group of re
cruits coming in for the third
straight year, Danny Diekroeger
has kept his nose to the grind
stone over the offseason.
"You can't worry about it be
cause there's nothing you can do
other than work hard," he said.
"Positions might open up, and
you just can never predict stuff
like that. It's awesome to have so
much experience on the team,
but that also makes it harder to
crack the lineup, I guess. But it
doesn't change my approach."
His development included a
summer stint with Morehead
City of the Coastal Plain League,
where he made 39 starts and was
fourth on the Marlins in batting
average.
Kenny Diekroeger, mean
while, has also been getting used
to his increasing role as a leader
on the team after the graduation
of catcher Zach Jones espe
cially as the only starting upper
classman position player from
the squad a year ago.
"Our class has really been
able to help the freshmen and
sophomores get acclimated to
Pac-12 baseball," Kenny
Diekroeger said. "It's also been
great just setting a tone and an at
titude for the team, just building
that chemistry. You're not going
to see that in the stats or anything

Brothers Kenny (above) and Danny Diekroeger both hope to rebound from forgettable 2011 seasons and
possibly be a big part of the Cardinal's run to its first College World Series since the 2008 season.
