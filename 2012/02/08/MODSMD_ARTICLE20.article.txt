# DIEKROEGER DUO
## Brothers look for breakout 2012 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Stanford has benefited from
its fair share of sisterly love re
cently, with the Ogwumikes dom
inating the hardwood, the up

and-coming Payne sisters emerg
ing on the soccer pitch and the
pitcher-catcher combination of
the Cardinal's two Gerhart
triplets ready to kick off another
softball season.
But with baseball season just
over a week away, it's a pair of
brothers that could help take the
No. 2 Stanford baseball team to
its next national title.
The Diekroeger brothers

junior shortstop Kenny and
sophomore infielder Danny
are both hoping to rebound from
somewhat underwhelming 2011
seasons. Kenny Diekroeger saw
his batting average fall 60 points
after a first-team All-Pac-10 per
formance in 2010 that also
earned him Freshman All-Amer
ica honors. Danny Diekroeger,
on the other hand, playing spar
ingly behind other members of

the Cardinal's top-ranked fresh
man class and appeared in only
19 games.
With a top-10 group of re
cruits coming in for the third
straight year, Danny Diekroeger
has kept his nose to the grind
stone over the offseason.
"You can't worry about it be
cause there's nothing you can do
other than work hard," he said.
"Positions might open up, and
you just can never predict stuff
like that. It's awesome to have so
much experience on the team,
but that also makes it harder to
crack the lineup, I guess. But it
doesn't change my approach."
His development included a
summer stint with Morehead
City of the Coastal Plain League,
where he made 39 starts and was
fourth on the Marlins in batting
average.
Kenny Diekroeger, mean
while, has also been getting used
to his increasing role as a leader
on the team after the graduation
of catcher Zach Jones espe
cially as the only starting upper
classman position player from
the squad a year ago.
"Our class has really been
able to help the freshmen and
sophomores get acclimated to
Pac-12 baseball," Kenny
Diekroeger said. "It's also been
great just setting a tone and an at
titude for the team, just building
that chemistry. You're not going
to see that in the stats or anything

possibly be a big part of the Cardinal's run to its first College World Series since the 2008 season.
like that, but showing up to the
field every day is a lot of fun for
us."
Kenny Diekroeger has more
than enough experience in setting
an example on the baseball dia
mond, having played alongside his
younger brother since T-ball.
When he graduated from Menlo
School in nearby Woodside, Calif.,
to come to the Farm, Danny
picked up the slack at shortstop,
hitting .462 and being named
league MVP, like his brother be

fore him.
It might not have measured up
to his older brother's state MVP
honor as a senior, but after playing
beside him for so long, Danny
Diekroeger doesn't feel like he has
to match Kenny stride for stride.
"It's definitely cool to have
someone to look up to like that, to
see what you can accomplish and
try to be like him, but I don't feel
pressured at all," he said. "It's
more that I'm just trying to do my
best, and he's just doing his best,
and we're happy for each other."
So when Danny Diekroeger
chose to come to Stanford two
years ago, he didn't do so just to
follow in his older brother's foot
steps.

"[Kenny being here] was defi
nitely something I thought about,
but it wasn't the biggest part of my
decision," Danny Diekroeger said.
"I think ultimately the reason we
ended up at the same place was be
cause we had a similar attraction to
Stanford, in the combination of
athletics and academics."
Danny Diekroeger understood
that combination well from the
start, according to Kenny, who said
he was most useful in giving his
younger brother insight into the
day-to-day life of Cardinal base
ball players.
And Danny hasn't struggled to
carve out his own identity at Stan
ford, either; after arriving on the
Farm as a management science

and engineering major just like
his brother he later made the
switch to computer science and be
came the team's CS tutor. Kenny
enjoys playing old Nintendo 64
games and lives in a dorm; Danny
likes to recreate tunes he hears on
the piano and lives in a fraternity.
But make no mistake: on the
playing field the Diekroegers' goal
remains the same, and their broth
erly connection doesn't end at the
dugout steps.
"We know what it's like to play
with each other, but at the same
time ... we get along really well,"
Kenny Diekroeger said. "Us inter
acting with each other, that rubs
off on other guys too, just the ener
gy that can spark between us."

"It's nothing new to us,"
Danny Diekroeger explained,
"But I know other guys on the
team think it's funny that we're
not afraid to argue with each
other about stupid little things the
way brothers do. We can be argu
ing one second and the next
minute we'll be laughing about
something else."
With any luck they will be
doing a lot of laughing in the com
ing weeks, as the Cardinal takes
on a series of top-tier foes to start
the season. Opening night is next
Friday, with Stanford hosting No.
10 Vanderbilt.
