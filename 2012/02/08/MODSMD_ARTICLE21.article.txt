## Kicking offspring against nation's best 
### SARAH MAISEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After an impressive 16-3 regular season
last spring, the Stanford women's lacrosse
team looks to build off its recent success to
further establish the Cardinal as a national
force in 2012.
The Card finished the 2011 season unde
feated at home and in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF), capturing its
seventh straight conference championship.
It went on to earn its second consecutive
berth to the NCAA Tournament before a
loss in the first round to Florida.
This year, expectations remain high for
the No. 6 Cardinal, despite the graduation of
the 2011 team's four leading scorers: first
team All-American Leslie Foard, third
team Ail-American Lauren Schmidt, All-
MPSF Sarah Flynn and All-MPSF Karen
Nesbitt. With many key starters returning,
the holes in the roster should not devastate
the team, and head coach Amy Bokker
noted that new leaders have already
stepped up to the plate,
"I'm really excited about our team and
the commitment level they put into presea
son," she said. "We've had good leadership

throughout the whole preseason from our
seniors Catherine Swanson, Maria Fortino
and Emilie and Anna Boeri."
Catherine Swanson, who earned All-
MPSF honors last season, is joined by re
turning starters sophomore Nina Swanson
and junior Liz Adam in the backfield. Soph
omores Anna Kim and Rachel Ozer both
started as freshmen and will provide the
team with valuable offensive experience.
Kim, the reigning MPSF Newcomer of the
Year, should help offset the inexperience of
the Cardinal's midfield.
"You'll see a lot of new midfielders in the
mix, [but] what's nice about our team is that
we run midfield lines," Bokker said. "These
players still have experience because they
ran on lines with those players that graduat
ed."
Another relatively new face is sopho
more Lyndsey Munoz, the Cardinal's new
starting goalkeeper. Munoz replaces Annie
Read, who graduated after starting in goal
the past three years. Munoz did receive
some playing time last season and she, along
with Swanson and Adam, should give the
team a great defensive advantage.
"I think you're going to see a lot of ex
citement coming from the goal cage.

[Munoz] is a dynamic, athletic player,"
Bokker said. "She actually made an appear
ance in our MPSF championship game last
year and ultimately was named MVP, so she
does have some experience under her belt.
She's really confident she has a ton of re
spect from her teammates because of her
commitment to lacrosse and our program,
so we're really excited to see the year that
she has."
The Cardinal will have to prove itself
early and often, as it faces several elite non
conference opponents, including five top-20
teams in its first five games. The tough
schedule opens at home Friday against last
year's NCAA champion, No. 1 Northwest
ern. After Northwestern, the Cardinal will
face No. 18 Ohio State, No. 20 Notre Dame,
No. 9 James Madison and No. 19 Vanderbilt.
Every one of the games against the top op
ponents will take place at Stanford in Cagan
Stadium, except for Notre Dame, and the
home field advantage could be a differ
ence-maker in close games. The Cardinal
will then make its way east to face No. 16
Albany and Harvard, two other teams con
sistently ranked in the top 20.
