# ROCKING THE RAINBOW WARRIORS

### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
After a long weekend that
saw the Stanford men's tennis
team drop a pair of matches, the
Cardinal proved it was not suf
fering from a hangover on Tues
day, dusting off Hawaii by a
score of 6-1.
Needing a big win after falling
to USC and UCLA on Friday
and Saturday, the No. 9 Cardinal
(5-2) started off the day the right
way by blowing through the
Rainbow Warriors in doubles.
Behind an 8-5 win from the duo
of freshman John Morrissey and
senior Ryan Thacher, coupled
with a pair of 8-4 wins from jun
iors Matt Kandath and Denis
Lin and sophomore Jamin Ball
and freshman Robert Stineman,
the Cardinal swept its way to an
early 1-0 lead.
The Cardinal didn't en
counter much trouble after that
either, even with ace player
Thacher sitting out the singles
matches. Stanford's tennis qual
ity was highlighted by especially
strong performances from Mor
rissey and Stineman in singles.
Stineman was the first off the
courts with a dominant 6-1, 6-0
win over Carter Lam, with Mor
rissey following shortly after by
cruising to a 6-1,6-1 victory over
Nils Schuhmann.
Ball, playing at the No. 5
spot, wrapped up the Cardinal
win as early as possible when he
blew past Jared Spiker, 6-2,6-0.
Lin, who was the only Cardi

nal player not to end up in the
win column, was the next to fin
ish, and then Kandath, who
toughed out a 7-5,6-4 win over
Dmytro Kovalyov, the Rainbow
Warriors' No. 1 player. Junior
Walker Keher rounded out the
day for the Cardinal with a
third-set tiebreak win over
Danilo Casanova.

Stanford now has two days to
rest up for another big contest,
as it welcomes No. 52 BYU to

the Farm on Friday for its only
match of the weekend. The
Cougars (3-4) are coming off
consecutive blowout victories
against Idaho State and Mon
tana State, but only after they
lost their last four matches. So
far, the Cougars have fallen to
every ranked opponent they
have played this season, includ
ing No. 9 UCLA, No. 36 Vander
bilt and No. 52 Cal Poly.
After the Cougars come to

town this weekend, the Cardinal
has only one more home match
before it heads to Char
lottesville, Va., for the National
Team Indoor Championships
the next Friday.
The Cardinal and the
Cougars will face off Friday at
1:30 p.m. at the Taube Family
Tennis Center.
