# Stanford Challenge raises $6.2 billion
## Results of five-year fundraising initiative released 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DEPUTY EDITOR 
Stanford University announced the conclusion of
The Stanford Challenge (TCS), its five-year fundrais
ing initiative, Wednesday. The project, a comprehen
sive fundraising push that raised $6.2 billion in
pledges to the University, aimed to broadly improve
the Stanford educational experience and better pre
pare future leaders.
TCS provided funding for 130 new faculty posi
tions, 360 graduate fellowships, $1.5 billion worth of
facility construction and improvement and over $250
million in need-based financial aid for undergradu
ates, according to a press release.
In addition, over 38 buildings were added or im

proved on Stanford campuses as part of the initiative
including the Huang Engineering Center, Arrilla
ga Dining Commons, Knight Management Center
and the Stanford Center at Peking University in Bei
jing-
"The response from the extended Stanford family
was tremendous," University President John Hen
nessy said in a press release, "This was a community
joining together for something they believe in."
Martin Shell, vice president of the Office of Devel
opment at Stanford, said the idea for TCS came to
gether not long after Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 took office.
Combining efforts with faculty members, adminis-
trators "identified a variety of im
portant needs and potential new
initiatives, refined them into a set of
overarching principles and began
to determine what it would take to
fund them," Shell said. While at first
these served as wish lists, funding
soon came pouring in.
The original goal of raising $4.3
billion was easily met by the Uni
versity, much of it through large do
nations from alumni. Most of the
money came from donations total
ing over $1 million donations
typically earmarked for specific
projects.
"Historically, you don't see
multi-million dollar, unrestricted
gifts," Shell said. "That's pretty un
common."
While $1.5 billion was donated
for facility improvement, one sixth
of that amount $253.7 million
was donated to supplement
need-based financial aid.
The TCS press release stated
that before 2006, 40 percent of
Stanford students were on financial
aid from the University, while now
80 percent receive aid from Stan
ford "and other sources."

However, Rebecca Vogel, assis
tant vice president for the Office of
Development, noted that these sta
tistics are "comparing apples and
oranges." Only 49 percent of stu
dents currently receive need-based
financial aid from Stanford, a figure
9 percent higher than before TCS.
Funding from TCS created
many of the institutes on campus,
such as the Woods Institute for the
Environment, the Precourt Insti
tute for Energy Efficiency and the
Tomkat Center for Sustainable En
ergy. The institutes are part of the
University's recent push for inter
disciplinary research.
The arts also received a boost
from TCS, with significant gifts and
funding going toward the creation
of an "arts district" on campus near
the Cantor Arts Center. The Bing
Concert Hall, Anderson Collection
at Stanford University and the Mc-
Murtry Building will be located on
the northeast side of the Oval.

The McMurtry Building will ac
commodate the art and art history
departments at Stanford when it
opens in 2015. Although the Bing
Concert Hall has also not yet been
completed, it is scheduled to open
for public performances at the start
of 2013.
