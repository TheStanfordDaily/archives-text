## Chappell Lougee receives record apps Scholarship grants sophomores up to $6,000 for summer research projects 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The Chappell Lougee Scholarship for summer
research projects received a record number of appli
cations by the Feb. 1 deadline, according to Christi
na Mesa, an Undergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR) academic director and the scholarship's new
coordinator. Winners can receive grants up to
$6,000.
More than 60 students discussed applications
one-on-one with her, and nearly 40 applied this year,
according to Mesa. Last year, 26 Chappell Lougee
Scholarships were awarded to 15 women and 11
men.
The scholarship, open solely to sophomores, was
designed to give students in the humanities, creative
arts and qualitative sciences an opportunity to spend
the full summer between their sophomore and jun
ior years pursuing independent research topics of
their choosing. The topics need not be related to stu
dents' majors.

"Students working in the humanities and social
sciences ought to have the same opportunity as sci
entists to remain on campus or go somewhere to do
research projects in a natural lab setting," Mesa said.
Mesa added that students proposed a wide range
of interesting topics, from social media to the
Olympics to the history of railroads. A Facebook
page for 2011 Chappell Lougee Scholars offers a
space for the researchers who call themselves
"chaps" to chronicle their experiences.
The Chappell Lougee Scholarships were estab
lished in 1987 to honor history professor Carolyn
Chappell Lougee's work as dean of undergraduate
studies from 1982 to 1987.The original funding came
from Stanford's Centennial Campaign fundraising
and the Chappell Lougee family.
"It was our hope that engaging undergraduates
in research with faculty members would offer stu
dents the advantages of being at a research universi
ty," Lougee said in an email to The Daily. "The Chap
pell Lougee scholarships targeted sophomores as a
way of involving students early on in their under
graduate years."
Winning a Chappell Lougee scholarship does not
affect a student's other financial aid. Although facul-
ty mentors are required, academic
advisors are familiar with this pro
gram and serve to guide students
toward appropriate faculty to help
develop research projects.
Mesa noted that the grant is ap
propriate for students who can
proceed with a high degree of in
dependence and autonomy.
"Good research is responsive
and allows itself to be shaped by
resources at hand, so curious,
open-minded, teachable students
who are willing to be wrong and do
leg work are the most effective in
this type of endeavor," Mesa said.
Research can be conducted in
the United States or abroad and

the scholarship is open to interna
tional students.
Megan Winkelman 'l3 spent
her summer at Oxford writing a
short novella about women and
mental illness.
"Working on my Chappell
Lougee project was the best sum
mer of my life it was rigorous
and eye-opening," Winkelman
said. "I got the space to ... experi
ment with history and literature
and settle into a place that fit me
the best, a narrative-based health
story telling the feelings of women.
Mesa nurtured me and suggested I
look at this my freshman year."
Brittany Rymer 'l3 researched
urban farming in the Bay Area, ex
ploring the motivations behind the
new concept of urban farmers dur
ing the past five to 10 years. Rymer
noted that her project evolved sig
nificantly from her initial proposal.

"The ability to change the focus
of your proposal is one of the best
things about the Chappell
Lougee," Rymer said. "It's nice to
have the freedom to be able to
change and shift focus. As sopho
mores, we're new to research and
it's hard to design a proposal, so
the flexibility is great."
Rymer said she hopes to ex
pand her research into an honors
thesis.

Mesa said she has witnessed
Chappell Lougee scholars bloom
into Fulbright scholars.
"People don't always start off
amazing; they start off curious,"
Mesa said. "Many students come
into my office in Lagunita Court to
just have a conversation, with no
idea of what they want to do."

mer of my life it was rigorous
and eye-opening," Winkelman
said. "I got the space to ... experi
ment with history and literature
and settle into a place that fit me
the best, a narrative-based health
story telling the feelings of women.
Mesa nurtured me and suggested I
look at this my freshman year."
Brittany Rymer 'l3 researched
urban farming in the Bay Area, ex
ploring the motivations behind the
new concept of urban farmers dur
ing the past five to 10 years. Rymer
noted that her project evolved sig
nificantly from her initial proposal.

"The ability to change the focus
of your proposal is one of the best
things about the Chappell
Lougee," Rymer said. "It's nice to
have the freedom to be able to
change and shift focus. As sopho
mores, we're new to research and
it's hard to design a proposal, so
the flexibility is great."
Rymer said she hopes to ex
pand her research into an honors
thesis.

Mesa said she has witnessed
Chappell Lougee scholars bloom
into Fulbright scholars.
"People don't always start off
amazing; they start off curious,"
Mesa said. "Many students come
into my office in Lagunita Court to
just have a conversation, with no
idea of what they want to do."
