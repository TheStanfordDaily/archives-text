## Chappell Lougee receives record apps Scholarship grants sophomores up to $6,000 for summer research projects 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The Chappell Lougee Scholarship for summer
research projects received a record number of appli
cations by the Feb. 1 deadline, according to Christi
na Mesa, an Undergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR) academic director and the scholarship's new
coordinator. Winners can receive grants up to
$6,000.
More than 60 students discussed applications
one-on-one with her, and nearly 40 applied this year,
according to Mesa. Last year, 26 Chappell Lougee
Scholarships were awarded to 15 women and 11
men.
The scholarship, open solely to sophomores, was
designed to give students in the humanities, creative
arts and qualitative sciences an opportunity to spend
the full summer between their sophomore and jun
ior years pursuing independent research topics of
their choosing. The topics need not be related to stu
dents' majors.

"Students working in the humanities and social
sciences ought to have the same opportunity as sci
entists to remain on campus or go somewhere to do
research projects in a natural lab setting," Mesa said.
Mesa added that students proposed a wide range
of interesting topics, from social media to the
Olympics to the history of railroads. A Facebook
page for 2011 Chappell Lougee Scholars offers a
space for the researchers who call themselves
"chaps" to chronicle their experiences.
The Chappell Lougee Scholarships were estab
lished in 1987 to honor history professor Carolyn
Chappell Lougee's work as dean of undergraduate
studies from 1982 to 1987.The original funding came
from Stanford's Centennial Campaign fundraising
and the Chappell Lougee family.
"It was our hope that engaging undergraduates
in research with faculty members would offer stu
dents the advantages of being at a research universi
ty," Lougee said in an email to The Daily. "The Chap
pell Lougee scholarships targeted sophomores as a
way of involving students early on in their under
graduate years."
Winning a Chappell Lougee scholarship does not
affect a student's other financial aid. Although facul-
