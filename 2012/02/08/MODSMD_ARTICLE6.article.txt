### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER DESK EDITOR 
"In education, it is the worst of times and
the best of times," said Claude Steele, dean of
the Stanford School of Education, at a
lunchtime presentation Tuesday that discussed
a partnership between Stanford and the San
Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD).
Steele opened the event by stating that this
"partnership is a model for how schools of ed
ucation can relate to real school districts."
The panelists said that though school dis
tricts are facing budget cuts, changes in tech
nology and educational research can make it
possible to get rid of old deadwood method
ologies that no longer work.
"Finland, with the most equitable education
system, improved their schools using Ameri
can research," Steele said. He noted the impor
tance of coordination and the need to grapple
with practical problems.
Steele emphasized the need for a broader
recognition of the importance of education to
quality of life and the economy. He said he
would like to see a proper "distribution of good
education into all communities the entire
population."
SFUSD Superintendent Carlos Garcia
took time to thank Stanford for the partnership
and referenced the often political nature of de
bate about education.
"After 37 years in the business, I learned
that we all make a lot of assumptions, many of
them wrong... and the world changes," Gar
cia said. He also noted that he believes facts
should be regarded as the most important indi
cator in debate, saying, "the data does not take
political sides."
Garcia added that because of the economic
crisis, it is important that school systems do not
"spend resources on places that don't get us re
sults."
Nancy Waymack, SFUSD's executive direc
tor of policy and operations, agreed, saying, "If

you're sitting on a dead horse, get off."
Waymack referenced the idea that if an old
curriculum isn't working, it should be replaced,
not constantly retooled.
"The goals for this event were twofold: first,
we wanted to bring a larger awareness to the
Stanford community about the
Stanford/SFUSD partnership," wrote Laura
Wentworth, director of the Stanford/SFUSD
partnership, in an email to The Daily. "Second,
we also wanted to share an exemplar of a suc
cessful partnership to inspire others on campus
and beyond who are attempting similar types
of partnerships where research, practice and
policy meet."
Wentworth added that this partnership was
formalized during the 2009-10 academic school
year to pursue the potential of "making the
Stanford projects in SFUSD more strategic
and aligned with the district goals."
Wentworth presented a detailed slide listing
the 28 current joint projects between Stanford
and SFUSD. She broke them into three cate
gories: access and equity, achievement and ac
countability.
