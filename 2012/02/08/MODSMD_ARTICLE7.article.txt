## Bill urges change in dept. policy Senate criticizes Language Centers attendance standards 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
unanimously passed the Calling for Action
to Restore Decency and Equality in Non
accessible Language Courses (CARDI
NAL) Act Tuesday. The bill urges the Lan
guage Center to take immediate action in
revising its attendance policy, which
deducts two percentage points from a stu
dent's final grade for every absence, regard
less of the justification for missing class.
The CARDINAL Act, co-sponsored by
Michael Cruz 'l2, ASSU executive presi
dent, and the Senate's Academic Affairs
Committee, was authored by Elections
Commissioner Adam Adler 'l2 and six sen
ators.
The bill's central premise is that the cur
rent attendance policy violates the "spirit of
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
and Stanford's Nondiscrimination Policy"
by not "accommodatfing] students who
miss classes as a result of a disability or med
ical condition."
Senator lan Chan 'l4, who co-authored
the bill and presented it at Tuesday's meet
ing, stressed that automatic grade deduc
tions discriminate against certain groups of
students.
In their discussion of the bill both this
week and last, the senators also noted what
they termed the policy's inconsistent imple
mentation across departments.
Senate Dan DeLong 'l4 emphasized
that, because of confusion over
what constitutes an excused ab
sence, instructors apply the policy
inconsistently.
"Not all of the instructors feel
comfortable enforcing this policy,"
DeLong said. "These [rules] are
coming down from the powers that
be. And if they don't enforce this
policy, which this quarter and last
quarter they've... been forced to
enforce, then they are insubordi
nate, and insubordination is
grounds for termination."
By not excusing absences due to
extracurricular events, court dates,
illness or any foreseen or unfore
seen event, the stringency of the
policy also forces students to drop
classes, the bill's supporters said.
The bill also argued that the
Language Center policy "pressures
students to attend class when doing
so may jeopardize their health and
wellness," and that of their peers.
"I've had to skip class because
I've been sick and have been penal
ized, which I personally think is

ridiculous," said Senator Alon El
hanan 'l4.

Although he said he believes
that the Language Center has "not
[been] too cooperative" in its meet
ings with the senators, Delong re
minded the senators that the poli
cy's intention is good.
"They want to encourage stu
dents to show up to class," he said.
"To learn a language, you have to be
in an immersion course."
Earlier in the meeting, the Sen
ate also debated a bill granting an
exemption to the Stanford Daily to
bank with an institution other than
Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE). The Daily has historically
banked independently of SSE on a
University waiver, without receiv
ing a distinct waiver from the ASSU
legislative bodies. This year, Adler
found a previously overlooked sec
tion of the ASSU constitution re
quiring action from the ASSU leg
islative bodies in deciding how to
grant an ASSU banking waiver to
student groups, suggesting that stu
dent groups must receive both an
ASSU and University waiver. Sen
ate Chair Rafael Vazquez 'l2 and
Appropriations Chair Brianna
Pang 'l3 authored the bill to grant
an exemption to The Daily.

Senators expressed their con
cern that public financial reports
and refund requests for students
may be less accessible if The Daily
continues to bank externally to
SSE. Daily Editor in Chief Mar
garet Rawson 'l2 responded by
noting that copies of The Daily's
audit are available upon request, as
legally required of the non-profit in
stitution, and The Daily complies
with all transparency requirements
of the special fees process. Rawson
cited The Daily's status as the
largest independent campus publi
cation as a key factor making exter
nal banking crucial to maintain the
integrity of the paper, which fre
quently reports on the ASSU and,
subsequently, SSE.
"Long-term practice has been
that the only banking that was done
was the fee itself' Nanci Howe, di
rector of Student Activities and
Leadership (SAL), said. "[The
Daily is] audited; the ASSU gets a
copy of that audit... That seemed
to work."
The bill was on previous notice
Tuesday and will face a vote next
week.

deducts two percentage points from a stu
dent's final grade for every absence, regard
less of the justification for missing class.
The CARDINAL Act, co-sponsored by
Michael Cruz 'l2, ASSU executive presi
dent, and the Senate's Academic Affairs
Committee, was authored by Elections
Commissioner Adam Adler 'l2 and six sen
ators.
The bill's central premise is that the cur
rent attendance policy violates the "spirit of
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
and Stanford's Nondiscrimination Policy"
by not "accommodatfing] students who
miss classes as a result of a disability or med
ical condition."
Senator lan Chan 'l4, who co-authored
the bill and presented it at Tuesday's meet
ing, stressed that automatic grade deduc
tions discriminate against certain groups of
students.
In their discussion of the bill both this
week and last, the senators also noted what
they termed the policy's inconsistent imple
mentation across departments.
Senate Dan DeLong 'l4 emphasized
that, because of confusion over
what constitutes an excused ab
sence, instructors apply the policy
inconsistently.
"Not all of the instructors feel
comfortable enforcing this policy,"
DeLong said. "These [rules] are
coming down from the powers that
be. And if they don't enforce this
policy, which this quarter and last
quarter they've... been forced to
enforce, then they are insubordi
nate, and insubordination is
grounds for termination."
By not excusing absences due to
extracurricular events, court dates,
illness or any foreseen or unfore
seen event, the stringency of the
policy also forces students to drop
classes, the bill's supporters said.
The bill also argued that the
Language Center policy "pressures
students to attend class when doing
so may jeopardize their health and
wellness," and that of their peers.
"I've had to skip class because
I've been sick and have been penal
ized, which I personally think is

ridiculous," said Senator Alon El
hanan 'l4.

Although he said he believes
that the Language Center has "not
[been] too cooperative" in its meet
ings with the senators, Delong re
minded the senators that the poli
cy's intention is good.
"They want to encourage stu
dents to show up to class," he said.
"To learn a language, you have to be
in an immersion course."
Earlier in the meeting, the Sen
ate also debated a bill granting an
exemption to the Stanford Daily to
bank with an institution other than
Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE). The Daily has historically
banked independently of SSE on a
University waiver, without receiv
ing a distinct waiver from the ASSU
legislative bodies. This year, Adler
found a previously overlooked sec
tion of the ASSU constitution re
quiring action from the ASSU leg
islative bodies in deciding how to
grant an ASSU banking waiver to
student groups, suggesting that stu
dent groups must receive both an
ASSU and University waiver. Sen
ate Chair Rafael Vazquez 'l2 and
Appropriations Chair Brianna
Pang 'l3 authored the bill to grant
an exemption to The Daily.

Senators expressed their con
cern that public financial reports
and refund requests for students
may be less accessible if The Daily
continues to bank externally to
SSE. Daily Editor in Chief Mar
garet Rawson 'l2 responded by
noting that copies of The Daily's
audit are available upon request, as
legally required of the non-profit in
stitution, and The Daily complies
with all transparency requirements
of the special fees process. Rawson
cited The Daily's status as the
largest independent campus publi
cation as a key factor making exter
nal banking crucial to maintain the
integrity of the paper, which fre
quently reports on the ASSU and,
subsequently, SSE.
"Long-term practice has been
that the only banking that was done
was the fee itself' Nanci Howe, di
rector of Student Activities and
Leadership (SAL), said. "[The
Daily is] audited; the ASSU gets a
copy of that audit... That seemed
to work."
The bill was on previous notice
Tuesday and will face a vote next
week.
