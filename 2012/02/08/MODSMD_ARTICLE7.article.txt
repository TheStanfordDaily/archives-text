to Restore Decency and Equality in Non

NAL) Act Tuesday. The bill urges the Lan

deducts two percentage points from a stu

The CARDINAL Act, co-sponsored by
Michael Cruz 'l2, ASSU executive presi

Committee, was authored by Elections
Commissioner Adam Adler 'l2 and six sen
ators.
The bill's central premise is that the cur

miss classes as a result of a disability or med

Senator lan Chan 'l4, who co-authored
the bill and presented it at Tuesday's meet

students.

week and last, the senators also noted what
they termed the policy's inconsistent imple
mentation across departments.
