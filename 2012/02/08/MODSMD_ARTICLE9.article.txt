## OXFORD LITERARY DEPTHS 
### â€” Jenny Thai 
~w" hereby undertake
I not to remove from
I the Library, or to
I mark, deface or in
-A-jure in any way, any
volume, document or other object
belonging to it or in its custody;
nor to bring into the Library or
kindle therein any fire or flame,
and not to smoke in the Library;
and I promise to obey all rules of
the Library."
This is the oath that all new
readers must formally read aloud
and sign before being permitted
access to the Bodleian Library, the
main library of Oxford University.
Established in 1602, the
Bodleian, which is housed in sever
al buildings scattered all across
campus, is one of the oldest li
braries in Europe and a fundamen
tal part of my studies at Oxford.
I spend most of my time in the
Radcliffe Camera, a classy old cir
cular library that houses books
mainly in English literature, histo
ry and theology. Like most of the
buildings here, the building's gor
geous Palladian architectural de

sign emanates an ancient and
scholarly aura of European so
phistication. Even after four
weeks, I'm still learning my way
around Radcliffe Camera.
Three or four days of the week
I trek over to the Radcliffe Cam
era to read and take notes. After
the security guard at the front
desk gives my library card a quick
check, I descend the spiraling
staircase and pass through the
doors. My eyes feast upon the
books, nestled in bookshelves so
high that readers can only reach
the top shelves by climbing lad
ders provided by the library. I take
in the sweet smell of old books be
fore scurrying down to the tables,
crossing my fingers for an avail
able seat.
Book learning is vital to the
typical undergraduate teaching
model of the "tutorial," so it's not
surprising to see the library reach
its maximum reader occupancy. If
you don't arrive early enough on
some afternoons, it's impossible to
find a place to sit.
The impressive collection of

books here at Radcliffe Camera is
only an infinitesimal fraction of the
total books the Bodleian Library
holds. The Bodleian receives a free
copy of every book and periodical
published in the United Kingdom,
amounting to over 100,000 new
books a year. Most of these books are
stored in large underground tunnels.
Miles and miles of shelved books are
tucked away from the light of day,
only accessible by a file request.
Even storage of books on the
open shelves maximizes every
possible bit of space. In addition to
the ten-foot-high bookshelves,
stairs connect the Radcliffe to the
Gladstone Link, Oxford's version
of Green Library's south stacks
only better lit and less creepy.
To access a shelf, you merely
turn the wheel of the shelf you
want to access. I always double
check to make sure no one's in the
aisle before I start cranking on the
wheel. Only at Oxford is the great
est hazard two rolling book
shelves!
