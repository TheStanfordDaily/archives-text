# STUDENT LIFE
## Stanford Memes page goes viral Local jokes become overnight Facebook sensation 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DEPUTY EDITOR 
Ralph Nguyen 'l2 started the
Stanford Meme Facebook page at
2 a.m. Wednesday. A few hours
later, the page had one hundred
"likes." By 5 p.m., 15 hours after it
began, the page had more than
1,000 likes and most Stanford stu
dents' Facebook pages were lit
tered with friend's reposting and
liking the images.
The memes poke fun at various
stereotypes and aspects of Stanford
life, often referencing popular in
side jokes or Stanford-specific phe
nomena. Originally popular prima
rily on Internet message boards
such as Reddit and 4chan, memes
have increasingly leaked into main
stream social sites, and in recent
months have become more com
monplace on Facebook.
While Nguyen has been receiv
ing calls from friends congratulating
him, he said he is more surprised by
calls from potential investors.
"It's kinda like a fucked-up ver
sion of a start-up," Nguyen said.
"Kids are showing their parents,
parents do the whole investment
thing, and now they're giving me
calls."
University meme pages mark a
significant shift to a hyper-local
form of this type of comedy and
satire, narrowing the memes' audi

ence and often playing on issues
much more personal or unique.
This is by no means a Stanford
specific phenomenon many stu
dents at other universities have
started pages in recent days and
weeks. Discussions on Reddit serve
as forums for the more sophisticat
ed to complain about people misus
ing memes on Facebook pages.
The response to the Stanford
meme page has been overwhelm
ingly positive and enthusiastic.
Near the end of Wednesday, dozens
of new memes were being posted
every hour with topics ranging
from head football coach David
Shaw ("Has best QB in country:
field goal") to University President
John Hennessy ("Raises $4.3 bil
lion: announces 3% tuition hike
same day.") Many of the memes
sport hundreds of likes and dozens
of shares, the type of social engage
ment any corporation would drool
over.
"I've used the Internet for these
types of purposes for several years
now and worked this summer as a
viral consultant,but to take initiative
and have your own stuff blow-up is
really liberating," Nguyen said.
Several of the memes play off of
potentially offensive stereotypes,
such as an always-disappointed
Asian father who has trouble under
standing English ("CSIO6B teach
you C++? Why CSIO6A no teach
you A++?"). While several com
plaints have been voiced on the
Facebook page, so far responses
have mostly been complimentary.

Many of the memes serve as in
teresting and unique insights into
aspects of life at Stanford not al
ways vocalized by students. One
student suggested Nguyen make an
account on the popular micro-blog
ging site Tumblr to gather all the
pictures in the same place (which
they later did), and Nguyen has
been contacted about putting all
the pictures on Pinterest, a popular
photo-blogging site.
Nguyen has reached out to sev
eral of his internet-sawy friends to
help him handle the page. Shane
Savitsky 'l2 (a Daily staffer) and
Kazuma Gunning 'l2 are helping
create memes and set up the Twit
ter andTumblr accounts.
It's been a good year for
Nguyen so far. His "Shit College
Freshmen Say" video garnered
more than one million views on
You Tube, and his comedy channel
"JustCallMeMrßight" is the No. 1

viewed channel in the "Comedi
ans" category.
While making money from this
endeavor might be difficult,
Nguyen has other concerns, as
well. When asked whether the pop
ularity has changed his life,Nguyen
shrugged and smiled.
"Love life is still terrible," he
said. As one of the Stanford memes
that twists Boromir's famous
quote in Lord of the Rings pointed
out, "One does not simply date at
Stanford."
