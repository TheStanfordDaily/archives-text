## LIGHTING UP LIVES 
### LUCAS OSWALD 
More than 5,014 compa
nies founded in the last
several decades have
been the progeny of
Stanford community
members, according to the Wellspring of
Innovation Project. While many of these
companies fall squarely in the tech in
dustry of Silicon Valley, several Stanford
graduates have founded organizations
that tackle social and environmental is
sues elsewhere.
One of these graduates is Ned Tozun
8.5.'01, MBA'O7, who found his true
calling by utilizing his entrepreneurial
skills to found d.light, which designs af
fordable and durable solar powered
LED lights for people in developing
countries with no or limited access to
electricity.
As a computer science and earth sys
tems double major, and later a graduate
of the Graduate School of Business
(GSB), Tozun never saw the need to
narrow down his interests into a single
profession. Instead he decided to use his
interdisciplinary education and diverse
skill set in design, engineering and busi
ness to create his own start-up.
After obtaining his undergraduate
degrees, Tozun worked as an engineer
for seven months before dabbling in a
few start-up ideas. During the same time
period, Tozun and his fiance did volun
teer work with HIV/AIDS patients in
Africa.
"I found doing work that had a social
impact to be deeply meaningful and ful
filling," Tozun said, explaining that his
work had "a very significant impact" on
his view of the world.
Tozun described how returning to
Silicon Valley to work on technology
startups failed to give him the same feel
ing of fulfillment.
"I started to look for away to blend
my skills in the start-up tech world with

what I really felt I was called to do," he
said.
While Tozun was researching the
needs of the developing world, he met
his future co-founder Sam Goldman
MBA'O7, a former Peace Corps volun
teer.
Goldman had discovered a need in
the developing world that could be filled
by modern technology. In slums and vil
lages around the world, he noticed, inef
ficient, dangerous and expensive
kerosene lamps are the main source of
light. With innovations in LED and solar
technology, Goldman found that better
solutions existed.
With experience from a few start-ups
and a greater familiarity with issues in
the developing world under their belts,
Tozun and Goldman attended the GSB
to explore their entrepreneurial ideas.
Tozun said he chose the GSB for its
social entrepreneurship focus and for a
single class at the Institute of Design,
"Design for Extreme Affordability."
After taking the class, Tozun and
Goldman went to Southeast Asia to as
sess the need for affordable technology
in the region.
"The amount of money people were
spending on kerosene lighting was in
sane,"Tozun said. "People really wanted
better technologies, but they weren't
well distributed or available [at] afford
able prices."
The pair decided to spend their year
designing a business strategy to meet
this demand for modern lighting in the
developing world. They launched d.light
in 2008.
Last year, Tozun and Goldman were
featured on the Impact 30, Forbes' first
ever list of 30 top social entrepreneurs.
What has proved the most challeng
ing for the pair is operating in distant
markets and catering to customers who
have very particular needs for their
products. These needs can prove almost
impossible to conceive from behind a

desk in Silicon Valley.
When Tozun and Goldman realized
that their company would not be able to
reach its full potential from the United
States, the pair split. Tozun is based
Shenzhen, China, overlooking produc
tion and design, and Goldman is based
in India working on marketing and dis
tribution.
Tozun emphasized human-centered
design, effective distribution networks
and targeted marketing as key pillars in
d.light's operation.
According to Tozun, marketing was
crucial because customers, especially
those living below the poverty line in
rural areas, were unlikely to be aware of
the benefits of a solar-powered portable
lamp.
Tozun mentioned that even those
customers that had seen solar powered
technology before were disenchanted
by their unreliability. It was through cus

tomer education on the part of d.light
that the company gained a footing in the
developing world.
d.light's products are distinguished
by their durability and simplicity.
"I think our products are the best
products in the market," Tozun said.
"But in the end it's the distribution and
the marketing side of the business that
will really give us long-term value."
Tozun credits his success to the time
he spent at Stanford.
"At Stanford, you have such an
amazing diversity of world-class depart
ments," he said. "To have people coming
together from different backgrounds
and disciplines, but with a shared sense
of wanting to change the world, that's
how the really good stuff ends up getting
started."

One of these graduates is Ned Tozun
8.5.'01, MBA'O7, who found his true
calling by utilizing his entrepreneurial
skills to found d.light, which designs af
fordable and durable solar powered
LED lights for people in developing
countries with no or limited access to
electricity.
As a computer science and earth sys
tems double major, and later a graduate
of the Graduate School of Business
(GSB), Tozun never saw the need to
narrow down his interests into a single
profession. Instead he decided to use his
interdisciplinary education and diverse
skill set in design, engineering and busi
ness to create his own start-up.
After obtaining his undergraduate
degrees, Tozun worked as an engineer
for seven months before dabbling in a
few start-up ideas. During the same time
period, Tozun and his fiance did volun
teer work with HIV/AIDS patients in
Africa.
"I found doing work that had a social
impact to be deeply meaningful and ful
filling," Tozun said, explaining that his
work had "a very significant impact" on
his view of the world.
Tozun described how returning to
Silicon Valley to work on technology
startups failed to give him the same feel
ing of fulfillment.
"I started to look for away to blend
my skills in the start-up tech world with

what I really felt I was called to do," he
said.
While Tozun was researching the
needs of the developing world, he met
his future co-founder Sam Goldman
MBA'O7, a former Peace Corps volun
teer.
Goldman had discovered a need in
the developing world that could be filled
by modern technology. In slums and vil
lages around the world, he noticed, inef
ficient, dangerous and expensive
kerosene lamps are the main source of
light. With innovations in LED and solar
technology, Goldman found that better
solutions existed.
With experience from a few start-ups
and a greater familiarity with issues in
the developing world under their belts,
Tozun and Goldman attended the GSB
to explore their entrepreneurial ideas.
Tozun said he chose the GSB for its
social entrepreneurship focus and for a
single class at the Institute of Design,
"Design for Extreme Affordability."
After taking the class, Tozun and
Goldman went to Southeast Asia to as
sess the need for affordable technology
in the region.
"The amount of money people were
spending on kerosene lighting was in
sane,"Tozun said. "People really wanted
better technologies, but they weren't
well distributed or available [at] afford
able prices."
The pair decided to spend their year
designing a business strategy to meet
this demand for modern lighting in the
developing world. They launched d.light
in 2008.
Last year, Tozun and Goldman were
featured on the Impact 30, Forbes' first
ever list of 30 top social entrepreneurs.
What has proved the most challeng
ing for the pair is operating in distant
markets and catering to customers who
have very particular needs for their
products. These needs can prove almost
impossible to conceive from behind a

desk in Silicon Valley.
When Tozun and Goldman realized
that their company would not be able to
reach its full potential from the United
States, the pair split. Tozun is based
Shenzhen, China, overlooking produc
tion and design, and Goldman is based
in India working on marketing and dis
tribution.
Tozun emphasized human-centered
design, effective distribution networks
and targeted marketing as key pillars in
d.light's operation.
According to Tozun, marketing was
crucial because customers, especially
those living below the poverty line in
rural areas, were unlikely to be aware of
the benefits of a solar-powered portable
lamp.
Tozun mentioned that even those
customers that had seen solar powered
technology before were disenchanted
by their unreliability. It was through cus

tomer education on the part of d.light
that the company gained a footing in the
developing world.
d.light's products are distinguished
by their durability and simplicity.
"I think our products are the best
products in the market," Tozun said.
"But in the end it's the distribution and
the marketing side of the business that
will really give us long-term value."
Tozun credits his success to the time
he spent at Stanford.
"At Stanford, you have such an
amazing diversity of world-class depart
ments," he said. "To have people coming
together from different backgrounds
and disciplines, but with a shared sense
of wanting to change the world, that's
how the really good stuff ends up getting
started."

companies fall squarely in the tech in

that tackle social and environmental is
sues elsewhere.
