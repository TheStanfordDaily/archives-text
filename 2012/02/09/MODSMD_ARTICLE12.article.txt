# FROM RESEARCH TO RETAIL
## National Science Foundation program trains students to bring ideas from lab to market, bridging commercialization gap 
### ARIELLA AXLER 
With projects such as im
plantable drug infu
sions to control chron
ic pain and laser-treat
ed hydrophobic sur
faces to reduce ice buildup on aircraft
wings, the Innovation Corps (I-Corps)
is taking scientific innovation from the
lab to the market.
The federally funded National Sci
ence Foundation (NSF) program made
its debut on the Stanford campus in the
fall. I-Corps is the first NSF program that
assists scientists and engineers in creat
ing start-ups by transitioning their ideas
and inventions into a viable business.
"I-Corps takes the most promising
research projects in American univer
sity laboratories and turns them into
start-ups, translating them from re
search with business potential to the
market," said program director Errol
Arkilic.
When the NSF launched I-Corps in
July 2011, it selected lab projects from
around the country that it identified as
the best candidates for commercializa
tion and tapped Stanford, as a world
renowned Silicon Valley innovation
powerhouse with expertise in turning
research into business success, to help
lead the program.
The NSF approached Stanford
management science and engineering
professors Steve Blank and John

Feiber to lead the I-Corps training pro
gram. Collectively, the professors have
more than 70 years of venture capital
experience. Blank and Feiber co-teach
Engineering 245: Technology Entre
preneurship and Lean Startups, a class
recognized by the NSF as one of the
best examples of course instruction
and methodology for start-up develop
ment in the nation.
"There has always been a gap be
tween studies in a lab and commercial
ization," Blank said. "Stanford is profi
cient at turning research into commer
cialization."
According to Blank, bridging the
gap between science and engineering is
increasingly becoming a common
framework for the commercialization
of new technologies. The intermediary
step between lab research and com
mercialization has fallen in the domain
of the private sector, with minimal gov
ernment interaction in the process of
company development.
Engineering 245 is based on the
Lean Launch Pad approach to start-ups
advocated by Blank. Lean Launch Pad
is a strategy of applying the scientific
method to entrepreneurial business
development.
This "lean method" involves plot
ting out a canvas for the business
model, and then testing the hypotheses
in a real-world setting. Similar to a sci
entific experiment, groups then review
and assess the efficacy of the technique,

refine the method and repeat the
process until they find success.
"The only truth is market truth,"
Arkilic said. "The course that Professor
Blank has constructed is the vanguard
of how to teach entrepreneurship and
help companies reach commercial
recognition."
Engineering 245 was taught to the I-
Corps participants online, but the class
is also offered to the Stanford commu
nity in winter quarter. The course fo
cuses on topics such as value proposi
tions and core ideals, which Feiber and
Blank emphasize form the fundamen
tal groundwork for successful start-ups.
After outlining practical expense mod
els and combining demand, revenue,
resource and expense considerations,
teams can begin building profitable
companies.
"The goal wasn't to get funding, it
was to change the trajectory of the
teams' development," Blake said. "We
want to get inventions to a state where
they can commercialize, license or start
a company."
This fall, the first I-Corps program
included 21 teams from across the
country. Participants represented
schools including the University of
Pennsylvania, the University of Ne
braska, UCLA, the University of
Southern California and the University
of Connecticut.
While some start-up incubators
concentrate on specific industries, I-

Corps business prototypes are from a
wide range of sectors strategically as
sembled by NSF. These sectors include
environmental efficiency solutions,
economic data collection tools, medical
gadgets and aerospace engineering.
Through the program, teams gain
the support system to turn test models
into tangible products and enterprises.
"The way to increase the success
rate of a company is to put a network
around a particular project," Arkilic
said. "Advisors, mentors and people
with scar tissue keep companies from
making stupid mistakes."
The course concentrated not on a
tangible success measurement, but
rather sought to foster a new skill set in
the participants.
"We want students to focus on the
marketplace and on the customers, not
on the science," Feiber said. "Students
have said to us that they now feel profi
cient at doing a set of things they didn't
appreciate before the course."
Feiber is enthusiastic about the
progress I-Corps has made thus far,
given that 19 teams participating in the
first I-Corps program have gone for
ward with company development.
"NSF was ecstatic," Feiber said.
"They think it is one of the best things
that has ever happened to the scientific
community."

ernment interaction in the process of
company development.
Engineering 245 is based on the
Lean Launch Pad approach to start-ups
advocated by Blank. Lean Launch Pad
is a strategy of applying the scientific
method to entrepreneurial business
development.
This "lean method" involves plot
ting out a canvas for the business
model, and then testing the hypotheses
in a real-world setting. Similar to a sci
entific experiment, groups then review
and assess the efficacy of the technique,

refine the method and repeat the
process until they find success.
"The only truth is market truth,"
Arkilic said. "The course that Professor
Blank has constructed is the vanguard
of how to teach entrepreneurship and
help companies reach commercial
recognition."
Engineering 245 was taught to the I-
Corps participants online, but the class
is also offered to the Stanford commu
nity in winter quarter. The course fo
cuses on topics such as value proposi
tions and core ideals, which Feiber and
Blank emphasize form the fundamen
tal groundwork for successful start-ups.
After outlining practical expense mod
els and combining demand, revenue,
resource and expense considerations,
teams can begin building profitable
companies.
"The goal wasn't to get funding, it
was to change the trajectory of the
teams' development," Blake said. "We
want to get inventions to a state where
they can commercialize, license or start
a company."
This fall, the first I-Corps program
included 21 teams from across the
country. Participants represented
schools including the University of
Pennsylvania, the University of Ne
braska, UCLA, the University of
Southern California and the University
of Connecticut.
While some start-up incubators
concentrate on specific industries, I-

Corps business prototypes are from a
wide range of sectors strategically as
sembled by NSF. These sectors include
environmental efficiency solutions,
economic data collection tools, medical
gadgets and aerospace engineering.
Through the program, teams gain
the support system to turn test models
into tangible products and enterprises.
"The way to increase the success
rate of a company is to put a network
around a particular project," Arkilic
said. "Advisors, mentors and people
with scar tissue keep companies from
making stupid mistakes."
The course concentrated not on a
tangible success measurement, but
rather sought to foster a new skill set in
the participants.
"We want students to focus on the
marketplace and on the customers, not
on the science," Feiber said. "Students
have said to us that they now feel profi
cient at doing a set of things they didn't
appreciate before the course."
Feiber is enthusiastic about the
progress I-Corps has made thus far,
given that 19 teams participating in the
first I-Corps program have gone for
ward with company development.
"NSF was ecstatic," Feiber said.
"They think it is one of the best things
that has ever happened to the scientific
community."

With projects such as im
plantable drug infu
sions to control chron
ic pain and laser-treat
ed hydrophobic sur
faces to reduce ice buildup on aircraft
wings, the Innovation Corps (I-Corps)
is taking scientific innovation from the
lab to the market.
The federally funded National Sci
ence Foundation (NSF) program made
its debut on the Stanford campus in the
fall. I-Corps is the first NSF program that
assists scientists and engineers in creat
ing start-ups by transitioning their ideas
and inventions into a viable business.
"I-Corps takes the most promising
research projects in American univer
sity laboratories and turns them into
start-ups, translating them from re
search with business potential to the
market," said program director Errol
Arkilic.
When the NSF launched I-Corps in
July 2011, it selected lab projects from
around the country that it identified as
the best candidates for commercializa
tion and tapped Stanford, as a world
renowned Silicon Valley innovation
powerhouse with expertise in turning
research into business success, to help
lead the program.
The NSF approached Stanford
management science and engineering
professors Steve Blank and John

Feiber to lead the I-Corps training pro
gram. Collectively, the professors have
more than 70 years of venture capital
experience. Blank and Feiber co-teach
Engineering 245: Technology Entre
preneurship and Lean Startups, a class
recognized by the NSF as one of the
best examples of course instruction
and methodology for start-up develop
ment in the nation.
"There has always been a gap be
tween studies in a lab and commercial
ization," Blank said. "Stanford is profi
cient at turning research into commer
cialization."
According to Blank, bridging the
gap between science and engineering is
increasingly becoming a common
framework for the commercialization
of new technologies. The intermediary
step between lab research and com
mercialization has fallen in the domain
of the private sector, with minimal gov
ernment interaction in the process of
company development.
