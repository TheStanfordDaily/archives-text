# OPINIONS
## MODERN MANNERS Are you friends with the Internet? 
### Jeff Mandell 
I recently got an email from
Word Press.com. "Howdy," it
began. After the substantive
content, I was granted permission
to disregard it: "If you don't care,
just ignore this email. :)"The mes
sage closed with "Cheers, Word-
Press.com."
This is what business commu
nication has become in the 21st
century.
One could argue that an infor
mal tone is natural for such a blog
host. But 10 years ago before
the word blog entered our vocab
ulary —we might have called
Word Press.com a web publishing
service, in which case its business
would have sounded a lot fancier.
It seems the Internet is casual be
cause we have made it that way.
Internet companies are collo
quial in away that traditional
businesses rarely are. Pay Pal is a
company that I have trusted for fi
nancial transactions and the stor
age of very personal information.
The only brick-and-mortar insti
tution that receives this level of
trust from me is my bank. When I
go to the bank, they call me Mr.
Mandell even though I am only
21. This feels weird because I am
not used to it, but at least I know
that they respect me. Pay Pal be
gins its emails to me with "Hello
Jeffrey Mandell," an incongruous
mix of the formal (my full name)
and the informal ("Hello").
Is Pay Pal going along with the
relaxed culture of the Internet, or
do they simply have no idea how
to begin a letter? You're supposed
to start with, "Dear So and so."
For a more respectful tone, say,
"Dear Mr./Ms./Dr. So and so,"
and for a more intimate one, write,
"Dear So" —but not "Hello." It
would seem somebody at the Pay-
Pal headquarters has to know
these rules.
Then again, there's Facebook.
In addition to always greeting you
with "Hi", Facebook has the silly
habit of ending its emails with
"Thanks," even though there is
nothing in the content of the mes
sage that indicates what they are
thanking you for. The word
"thanks" does not actually mean
anything to them; it is just how
they end emails. This stylistic
quibble is probably not worth
harping on too much, but I do
think that excessive thanking di
lutes the meaning of gratitude and
encourages a false and unearned
sense of closeness.
It's obviously okay to say "hey
guys" or whatever else you want
when you are greeting your
friends by email. My friends say
things like "sup baby dogs" and
"what up fellow soldiers." But
when businesses are communicat
ing with clients, the style should be
a little more restrained. Luckily,
the protocol for more formal writ
ing has already been invented. So
why doesn't it get used?
My theory is that Internet
companies, from Pay Pal to Face
book to Amazon, feel that their
relationships with us have gotten
close enough to dispense with for
malities. Collectively, they know
almost everything about us from
spying on our browsing behavior,
purchase history, ad clicks and
friend networks. The communica
tion lines between company and
client are always open, and an
email to a user is just a drop next

to a steady stream of personal in
formation flowing the other way.
From the perspective of these
companies, writing "Dear User"
would be like writing "Dear Big
Toe"; the electrical tendrils that
connect us have created an inti
macy where a simple "hello" suf
fices.
As the Internet becomes ever
more central in our culture and
our daily lives, we should ask for a
healthy distance from the virtual
businesses we patronize. I don't
want to be on first name terms
with Facebook or any other non
human entity. We appreciate web
companies, and in some cases we
like and even admire them, but
that does not mean that we are
friends.

plaints about etiquette at Stanford

It seems the
Internet is casual
because we have
made it that way.

Pal headquarters has to know
these rules.
Then again, there's Facebook.
In addition to always greeting you
with "Hi", Facebook has the silly
habit of ending its emails with
"Thanks," even though there is
nothing in the content of the mes
sage that indicates what they are
thanking you for. The word
"thanks" does not actually mean
anything to them; it is just how
they end emails. This stylistic
quibble is probably not worth
harping on too much, but I do
think that excessive thanking di
lutes the meaning of gratitude and
encourages a false and unearned
sense of closeness.
It's obviously okay to say "hey
guys" or whatever else you want
when you are greeting your
friends by email. My friends say
things like "sup baby dogs" and
"what up fellow soldiers." But
when businesses are communicat
ing with clients, the style should be
a little more restrained. Luckily,
the protocol for more formal writ
ing has already been invented. So
why doesn't it get used?
My theory is that Internet
companies, from Pay Pal to Face
book to Amazon, feel that their
relationships with us have gotten
close enough to dispense with for
malities. Collectively, they know
almost everything about us from
spying on our browsing behavior,
purchase history, ad clicks and
friend networks. The communica
tion lines between company and
client are always open, and an
email to a user is just a drop next

to a steady stream of personal in
formation flowing the other way.
From the perspective of these
companies, writing "Dear User"
would be like writing "Dear Big
Toe"; the electrical tendrils that
connect us have created an inti
macy where a simple "hello" suf
fices.
As the Internet becomes ever
more central in our culture and
our daily lives, we should ask for a
healthy distance from the virtual
businesses we patronize. I don't
want to be on first name terms
with Facebook or any other non
human entity. We appreciate web
companies, and in some cases we
like and even admire them, but
that does not mean that we are
friends.

Jeff would like to incorporate your
questions, comments and com
plaints about etiquette at Stanford
into future columns. He appreciates
your thoughts, which can be sent to

It seems the
Internet is casual
because we have
made it that way.
