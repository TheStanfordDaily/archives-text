# SEEING GREEN
## First mis-impressions 
### Holly Moeller 
KAIKOURA, N.Z. After address
ing my postcard to Julie, I read the
caption one last time. "Mountain
lupin is a beautiful, but highly dam
aging, introduced weed," it began,
describing the purple flowers
forming the foreground of the
card's mountain scene.
When I first found the card, I'd
debated its purchase. As an ecolo
gist, shouldn't I be sending images
of native New Zealand species?
But Kaikoura is a tiny town with
limited gift shops, each with a limit
ed postcard selection. Plus it was a
beautiful photo, and representative
of what I'd seen in New Zealand.
Honestly, I was impressed the
card even mentioned lupin's for
eign nature. Despite how often
non-native species feature in repre
sentative images of a place, we
rarely acknowledge that they really
shouldn't be there.
Sometimes introduced species
even become iconic, Hawaii's
guava trees are nasty weeds;
plumeria comes from Central
America. Although we expect pork
at luaus and shade from palm trees,
we forget that pigs (introduced by

native Hawaiians more than 1,000
years ago) demolish the native for
est floor and that coconut palms
probably accompanied the first
human settlers.
Back home, I associate Califor
nia with the smell of eucalyptus
trees, and I think iceplant (which
carpets the coast) is beautiful. I find
it hard to accept that these two
species are among our worst
weeds, and that I should revile
them accordingly. Imprints of sight
and smell are hard to shake.
Now, here in New Zealand, a
new twist: Some of my favorite
North American conifers Dou
glas-fir, Monterey pine and Lodge
pole pine are nasty invaders.
Pines in particular are taking off
through New Zealand's grasslands
like wildfire.
Except that there's hardly any
wildfire in New Zealand. Indeed,
that's why pines are so successful.
When the Maori burned parts of
the native forests to clear the land,
the original trees, having evolved in
a nearly fire-free environment,
were slow to return. The grasslands
that replaced them are now iconic:

They've persisted for 500 years or
more, predating European settle
ment and acquiring a novel set of
human-introduced plants and self
introduced birds.
Enter the foreign pines, many of
which were planted to stabilize the
steepest slopes in the wake of the
Europeans' wave of fire clearing.
But once the pines started creeping
into grasslands, they became
species non grata.
Never mind the human origins
of those very grasslands: They've
been ingrained into the Kiwi sense
of place, and must therefore be de
fended.
The practical ecologist in me
wonders how much I'd be willing to
pay to clear whole hillsides of pine,
as New Zealand's Department of
Conservation is doing now. If the
area was originally forested, why
not let pines settle there? Pines are
fire-followers their seedlings
grow fast but require high light and
all but absent tree cover. So the
pine forests will last only for a sin
gle generation. Perhaps, though,
they'll form a sheltered stepping
stone back to native forest.

Fortunately, this decision isn't
mine to make. I'll happily avoid the
mess of conflicting practical mat
ters, scientific opinions and cultural
identities. Still, such issues raise
questions for all of us who grew up
in a human-modified world that's
changed perceptibly within our
own lifetimes.
Often, managers marshal crews
of weed whackers and brigades of
rodent trappers to chase an ideal
ized image of a place that's neither
practical nor appropriate. Some
times the goal is the most "natural
looking" system; other times aes
thetics favor charismatic species.
Recently, we've begun managing
for "functional" ecosystems, which
cycle nutrients or photosynthesize
or interconnect in ostensibly
"ideal" ways.
There seems to be a common
theme, though, and that's the de
sire to reproduce some fixed vision
of how things "should" be. We want
to restore places to match a glori
fied memory, and hold them un
changed indefinitely. What could
be more human than wishing to
hold the places dearest to our
hearts constant?
What could be more human
than wanting something we can't
have?
As Ben Franklin quipped, noth
ing's certain in life but death and
taxes. Everything else changes
including our natural systems.
Plants and animals evolve
sometimes unpredictably.They ad
just their behaviors and ranges ac
cording to shifting environmental
conditions (with a new twist
thrown in by climate change). And
as we know from Hawaii, Califor
nia and New Zealand, our views
change too. We form new baselines
from our observations as we grow
up, and as we travel to places out
side our former experience.
So we are confronted with two
extremes: to fight desperately and in
vain for constancy, or to surrender to
global homogenization, accepting
the attendant waves of species inva
sion and native extinction.
Obviously, the answer lies
somewhere in between. And it's
different in every case, depending
on how you feel about the smell of
eucalyptus.

vain for constancy, or to surrender to
global homogenization, accepting
the attendant waves of species inva
sion and native extinction.
Obviously, the answer lies
somewhere in between. And it's
different in every case, depending
on how you feel about the smell of
eucalyptus.

KAIKOURA, N.Z. After address
ing my postcard to Julie, I read the
caption one last time. "Mountain
lupin is a beautiful, but highly dam
aging, introduced weed," it began,
describing the purple flowers
forming the foreground of the
card's mountain scene.
When I first found the card, I'd
debated its purchase. As an ecolo
gist, shouldn't I be sending images
of native New Zealand species?
But Kaikoura is a tiny town with
limited gift shops, each with a limit
ed postcard selection. Plus it was a
beautiful photo, and representative
of what I'd seen in New Zealand.
Honestly, I was impressed the
card even mentioned lupin's for
eign nature. Despite how often
non-native species feature in repre
sentative images of a place, we
rarely acknowledge that they really
shouldn't be there.
Sometimes introduced species
even become iconic, Hawaii's
guava trees are nasty weeds;
plumeria comes from Central
America. Although we expect pork
at luaus and shade from palm trees,
we forget that pigs (introduced by

native Hawaiians more than 1,000
years ago) demolish the native for
est floor and that coconut palms
probably accompanied the first
human settlers.
Back home, I associate Califor
nia with the smell of eucalyptus
trees, and I think iceplant (which
carpets the coast) is beautiful. I find
it hard to accept that these two
species are among our worst
weeds, and that I should revile
them accordingly. Imprints of sight
and smell are hard to shake.
Now, here in New Zealand, a
new twist: Some of my favorite
North American conifers Dou
glas-fir, Monterey pine and Lodge
pole pine are nasty invaders.
Pines in particular are taking off
through New Zealand's grasslands
like wildfire.
Except that there's hardly any
wildfire in New Zealand. Indeed,
that's why pines are so successful.
When the Maori burned parts of
the native forests to clear the land,
the original trees, having evolved in
a nearly fire-free environment,
were slow to return. The grasslands
that replaced them are now iconic:

They've persisted for 500 years or
more, predating European settle
ment and acquiring a novel set of
human-introduced plants and self
introduced birds.
Enter the foreign pines, many of
which were planted to stabilize the
steepest slopes in the wake of the
Europeans' wave of fire clearing.
But once the pines started creeping
into grasslands, they became
species non grata.
Never mind the human origins
of those very grasslands: They've
been ingrained into the Kiwi sense
of place, and must therefore be de
fended.
The practical ecologist in me
wonders how much I'd be willing to
pay to clear whole hillsides of pine,
as New Zealand's Department of
Conservation is doing now. If the
area was originally forested, why
not let pines settle there? Pines are
fire-followers their seedlings
grow fast but require high light and
all but absent tree cover. So the
pine forests will last only for a sin
gle generation. Perhaps, though,
they'll form a sheltered stepping
stone back to native forest.

Fortunately, this decision isn't
mine to make. I'll happily avoid the
mess of conflicting practical mat
ters, scientific opinions and cultural
identities. Still, such issues raise
questions for all of us who grew up
in a human-modified world that's
changed perceptibly within our
own lifetimes.
Often, managers marshal crews
of weed whackers and brigades of
rodent trappers to chase an ideal
ized image of a place that's neither
practical nor appropriate. Some
times the goal is the most "natural
looking" system; other times aes
thetics favor charismatic species.
Recently, we've begun managing
for "functional" ecosystems, which
cycle nutrients or photosynthesize
or interconnect in ostensibly
"ideal" ways.
There seems to be a common
theme, though, and that's the de
sire to reproduce some fixed vision
of how things "should" be. We want
to restore places to match a glori
fied memory, and hold them un
changed indefinitely. What could
be more human than wishing to
hold the places dearest to our
hearts constant?
What could be more human
than wanting something we can't
have?
As Ben Franklin quipped, noth
ing's certain in life but death and
taxes. Everything else changes
including our natural systems.
Plants and animals evolve
sometimes unpredictably.They ad
just their behaviors and ranges ac
cording to shifting environmental
conditions (with a new twist
thrown in by climate change). And
as we know from Hawaii, Califor
nia and New Zealand, our views
change too. We form new baselines
from our observations as we grow
up, and as we travel to places out
side our former experience.
So we are confronted with two
extremes: to fight desperately and in
vain for constancy, or to surrender to
global homogenization, accepting
the attendant waves of species inva
sion and native extinction.
