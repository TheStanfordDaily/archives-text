## ROLLING SOUTH CARD TRIES TO STAY HOT AGAINST SOCAL FOES 
### DANIEL LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
Last weekend, the Stanford
men's volleyball team got exactly
what the doctor ordered: a road
sweep of the previously top
ranked BYU Cougars.
Despite having dropped its

previous two Friday night match
es against now No. 1 UCLA and
No. 5 Penn State, the No. 4 Cardi
nal has shown resilience on Sat
urdays, outlasting top-15 oppo
nents No. 14 UC-Santa Barbara
and No. 8 Ohio State in consecu
tive weekends. Following the im
pressive sweep of BYU, Stanford

(7-2, 4-1 MPSF) now hopes to
continue its momentum and
avoid the ever-pesky letdown
match this weekend in southern
California against conference
foes No. 9 Long Beach State (5-4,
1-3) and No. 11 Cal State North
ridge (3-6,1-4).
"We had a big weekend

against BYU and we're certainly
proud of the two wins we got in
Provo, but like our coach always
says, it's the MPSF and every
match is just as important as the
next," said senior captain Brad
Lawson.
A balanced attack, run
smoothly and efficiently by sen
ior setter Evan Barry, has been
the calling card for Stanford thus
far this season. Lawson and soph
omores Brian Cook, Eric
Mochalski and reigning MPSF
Player of the Week Steven Irvin
all average at least two kills per
set and have a hitting percentage
above .300. As a result, Stanford
has easily outhit its opponents
thus far this season, landing 36
percent of its swings in contrast
to its opponents' 29.2 percent
age. Barry leads the NCAA with
12.26 assists per game.
Led by senior libero Erik
Shoji, Stanford has out-dug its
opponents, averaging nearly a
dig and a half more per set (9.00
to 7.55). Shoji currently ranks
third in the nation at a 2.73 digs
per-set clip.
Long Beach State figures to
present a challenge this Friday
night in a rematch of last year's
MPSF quarterfinal, which the
49ers won. LBSU has a stingy de
fense thanks to a starting lineup
that features three players 6-
foot-7 or taller, helping to hold
opponents to a lowly .236 hitting
percentage this season.
Seniors Jim Baughman and
Brad Hemmerling, as well as
sophomore Taylor Crabb lead
the 49ers' attack, with each aver
aging better than 2.5 kills per set.
Running the show is sophomore
setter Connor Olbright, who as
sists on an impressive 62.5 per
cent of his sets. He, along with
Crabb, was a teammate of Cook,
Irvin and Mochalski this summer
on the U.S. Men's Junior Nation
al Team that placed fourth at the
Junior World Championships in
Brazil.
Although the 49ers have
struggled somewhat in league
play thus far this season, Long
Beach State is a different team at
home. Stanford will have to be
the first team to defeat the 49ers
inside the iconic Walter Pyramid
this season, and snapping Long
Beach's three-match win streak
will clearly be no easy chore.
"We'll be facing Long Beach
in a rematch of last year's MPSF
quarterfinal, and for those of us
who were on last year's squad,
that's a strong motivating fac

tor," Lawson said of the Cardi
nal's season-ending defeat a year
ago.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will
be charged with the task of slow
ing down the Cal State-North
ridge Matadors, a team that plays
two setters and has six players av
eraging at least a kill per set. The
Matadors are led by freshman
Julius Hoefer, who ranks third in
the NCAA among freshmen with
3.53 kills per set. Northridge's
other featured hitter is senior
Matt Stork, who averages 2.63
kills per set.
Like Long Beach State, North
ridge has found much more suc
cess at home this season. The
Matadors are 2-0 in Northridge
despite having lost all five of their

true road games.
If Stanford has MPSF- and na
tional-title aspirations, this week
end should be one where the Car
dinal takes care of business. On
paper, Stanford has too many
weapons for either Long Beach
State or Cal State-Northridge to
contend with, even while on the
road. Beating teams in the lower
half of the conference standings
on the road will be a crucial task
moving forward, especially con
sidering the Cardinal gets to fin
ish with 11 of its final 13 matches
at home.
Stanford will take on Long
Beach State on Friday and Cal
State-Northridge on Saturday,
with both matches beginning at 7
p.m. It is the team's second-to
last road trip before returning to
the Farm for a six-match home
stand.
