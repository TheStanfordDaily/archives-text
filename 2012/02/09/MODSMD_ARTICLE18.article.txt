# DESPERATE CARD TRAVELS TO UCLA
## STANFORD FACES CRUCIAL ROAD TEST 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fresh off a disappointing
home loss to Arizona, the Stan
ford men's basketball team is
back on the road for rematches
with UCLA and USC. The Car
dinal (16-7,6-5 Pac-12) currently
sits three games back of confer
ence-leading Washington and
needs to complete a season
sweep over both teams to stay in
the hunt for the Pac-12 title.
First up for Stanford is
UCLA. The Bruins (13-10, 6-5)
have been one of the most disap
pointing teams in the country so
far. As the preseason pick to win
the Pac-12 and the No. 17 team in
the nation, they were expected
to cruise to the NCAA Tourna
ment. Yet between the 1-4 start
to the season and the dismissal
from the team of Reeves Nelson,
UCLA's leading scorer and re
bounder last season, the poten
tial dream season has instead
turned into a nightmare for the
Bruins.
UCLA's last meeting with the
Cardinal ended in dramatic fash
ion, with Stanford forward Josh
Huestis blocking a potential
game-winning jumper by
UCLA's Lazeric Jones with
three seconds left on the clock.
Stopping Jones will definitely
be a priority for the Cardinal.
The guard leads UCLA in both
points per game and assists per
game, with 13.3 and 4.4 respec
tively. Jones scored a career-high
26 points in the teams' last meet

ing and will be looking to put on
another show in front of his
home crowd.
For Stanford to beat the Bru
ins again, it must continue its
strong work on the boards. The
Cardinal has been outrebound
ed just four times this season,
and has been especially domi
nant in terms of offensive re
bounding.
Stanford may catch a break,
as UCLA forward Travis Wear
missed the team's last game with
an ankle sprain and is question
able for tonight. The big man is
second on the team in both scor
ing and rebounding. His absence
would be a major blow to the
Bruins, as Wear, his twin brother
David Wear, and center Joshua
Smith provide frontcourt depth
few can match. The three aver
age 16.3 rebounds combined per
game, and would definitely put
up a fight for control over the
boards.
With Travis Wear hobbled,
Smith has stepped up in a big
way. The sophomore had the
best game of his college career
last Thursday against Washing
ton, posting a career-high 24
points to go with nine rebounds.
Two nights later, he had 19
points and five rebounds to lead
the Bruins over Washington
State.
After tonight's test against
UCLA, the Cardinal will travel
to USC to take on the bottom
dwelling Trojans. USC (6-18, 1-
10) has been a far cry from the
team that made the NCAA
Tournament last year, posting
the program's worst season in re
cent memory. The Trojans have

Sophomore guard Aaron Bright (above) and the Stanford men's
basketball team have struggled of late, losing four of the past five
games. The Cardinal now must hit the road to play UCLA and USC.
