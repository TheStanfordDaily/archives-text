# Jacobs needs to follow his own advice
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
So here we are in mid-Feb
ruary, the most awful time
of the sports year. Football
season is over, the eternity
that is the NBA season is
only half-over and we're still a few
weeks away from March Madness.
But despite the fact that nothing
that interesting is going on in the
sports world, that doesn't mean
there's any shortage of athletes say
ing stupid things, most notably Gi
ants running back Brandon Jacobs.
After Tom Brady's receivers
(read: Wes Welker) couldn't quite
hang on to his perfect passes on Sun
day, Brady's wife, supermodel Gise
le Bundchen, was caught on video
saying. "My husband cannot f-ing
throw the ball and catch the ball at
the same time. I can't believe they
dropped the ball so many times." To
anyone who watched the game, this
was a reasonable (albeit passionate)
critique of the Patriots' receivers'
performance.
Enter Brandon Jacobs. During
the Giants championship parade on
Tuesday, Jacobs offered his critique
of Bundchen's comments, saying,
"She just needs to continue to stay
cute and shut up."
You go, Brandon. You're the
man. Everybody knows that when
you rush for a whopping 37 yards in
the Super Bowl, you get to say what
ever petty, sexist things you want to
the national media.
After all, Jacobs is the NFL's ar
biter of telling people to shut up.
After the Giants beat the Jets in
week 16 this season, Jacobs told the
media that he told Jets' head coach
Rex Ryan, "Wait till we win the
Super 80w1... And I told him I'll
punch him in the face."
" [Ryan] needs to shut up," Jacobs
added later. "He's a great coach, I
take nothing away from him. He
comes from a great coaching family.
But he needs to shut up."
Now, Jacobs has at least stood
up and apologized for his com
ments, but after running his mouth
all season long, you'd think that he
would know better than to say
something so patently stupid to the
New York media. He of all people
should know just how viral and
gossipy things are in the City That
Never Sleeps, considering how he
set off the Giants-Jets firestorm
that dominated ESPN's airwaves
in December.
Personally, I don't see where Ja
cobs got the chip on his shoulder
that allows him to talk so big. Per
haps he knows that he's one of the
softest running backs in the NFL
and needs to justify his awful play on
the field with his even worse trash
talk. His 571 rushing yards this sea
son were good enough for the 40th
most yards in NFL, well behind guys
like Darren McFadden, who played
in seven games this year. Jacobs
even finished with fewer rushing
yards this year than Timothy
Richard Tebow (and Jacobs some
how managed to finish with an even
worse completion percentage than
Tebow as well).
Altogether, Jacobs' dumb com
ments should be a reminder to all
athletes that you can't just talk trash
about whatever you want. Just like a
politician or a businessman, if you
talk to the media and you say some
thing that would make a "Mad
Men" character blush, you will get
excoriated for it, and you deserve to
be raked over the coals. Just because
you "backed up your trash talk" and
ended up with your second Super
Bowl ring in five years doesn't mean
you get to say whatever you want
in fact, you should be far more cir
cumspect about what you say to re
porters, considering that they are
now putting a mic in your face and
expecting that you will say some
thing dumb.
So Brandon, I have just one
more thing to say. You've been run
ning your mouth a lot this year, so let
me run mine: Stop acting like a 14-
year-old and start using that mouth
to kiss the shoes of everybody who
actually contributed to the Giants'
Super Bowl run this year. You might
want to start with Eli Manning,
Justin Tuck, Mario Manningham
and Jason Pierre-Paul. Then give
your appreciation to Wes Welker,
Kyle Williams, Tony Romo and
Jason Garrett's clock management
skills.
And after you're done doing
that, you'd be best served to take
your own advice: Shut up.
