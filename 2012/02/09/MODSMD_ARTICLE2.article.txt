"We are playing with fire by thinking
that this is all over," warned former Sen
ator Russ Feingold in a speech yester
day evening titled, "While America
Sleeps: A Wake-Up Call for the Post
-9/11 Era."
Feingold delivered the speech to an
audience of more than 200 people at
Cemex Auditorium in the Knight Man
agement Center.
Larry Diamond, director of the Cen
ter for Democracy, Development, and
the Rule of Law (CDDRL), introduced
Feingold as "someone who is deeply
troubled by incivility in American poli
tics" and "has experience that reflects
his distinctive blend of concerns in
world issues."
Feingold, a Wisconsin senator for 18
years, is currently at Stanford as a distin
guished visitor at the Haas Center for
Public Service during winter quarter.
Throughout the quarter he will lead a
weekly seminars, mentor students, par
ticipate in faculty discussions and give

two public lectures.
Throughout his speech, Feingold re
peatedly criticized the lack of attention
paid to foreign policy in the United
States.
"We are obsessed with the current
election over who is up and down," he
said. "Precious little is being said about
our position in the rest of the world."
According to Feingold, "big money"
and corruption dominate the U.S. gov
ernment, which is characterized by divi
siveness and stubbornness on both do
mestic and international issues.
"If we cannot work on both domes
tic and international policy, we won't be
safe," he warned. "We will continue to
stumble as other nations use their re
sources to strategically assert them
selves in the world."
Feingold advocated a surgical ap
proach to handling international issues,
citing a strategy of intervening in Libya
as "an example that you do not need
boots on the ground or complete inter
vention to complete a goal."
