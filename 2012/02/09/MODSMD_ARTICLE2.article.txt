## Feingold speaks at CEMEX 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
"We are playing with fire by thinking
that this is all over," warned former Sen
ator Russ Feingold in a speech yester
day evening titled, "While America
Sleeps: A Wake-Up Call for the Post
-9/11 Era."
Feingold delivered the speech to an
audience of more than 200 people at
Cemex Auditorium in the Knight Man
agement Center.
Larry Diamond, director of the Cen
ter for Democracy, Development, and
the Rule of Law (CDDRL), introduced
Feingold as "someone who is deeply
troubled by incivility in American poli
tics" and "has experience that reflects
his distinctive blend of concerns in
world issues."
Feingold, a Wisconsin senator for 18
years, is currently at Stanford as a distin
guished visitor at the Haas Center for
Public Service during winter quarter.
Throughout the quarter he will lead a
weekly seminars, mentor students, par
ticipate in faculty discussions and give

two public lectures.
Throughout his speech, Feingold re
peatedly criticized the lack of attention
paid to foreign policy in the United
States.
"We are obsessed with the current
election over who is up and down," he
said. "Precious little is being said about
our position in the rest of the world."
According to Feingold, "big money"
and corruption dominate the U.S. gov
ernment, which is characterized by divi
siveness and stubbornness on both do
mestic and international issues.
"If we cannot work on both domes
tic and international policy, we won't be
safe," he warned. "We will continue to
stumble as other nations use their re
sources to strategically assert them
selves in the world."
Feingold advocated a surgical ap
proach to handling international issues,
citing a strategy of intervening in Libya
as "an example that you do not need
boots on the ground or complete inter
vention to complete a goal."


ALISA ROYER/The Stanford Daily
Former Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold, distinguished visitor at the Haas Center
for Public Service, delivered a lecture Wednesday evening on the importance
of foreign policy in post-911 United States.
"We have a single-by-single
country approach of tackling is
sues," he said. "The discussion was
never focused on the broad land
scape."
Feingold emphasized Africa's
importance in the fight against ter
rorism, bringing attention to ex
tremist groups in Africa such as al-
Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb
(AQIM). Feingold cited Somalia as
a state tainted with piracy and also
discussed the emergence of an al-
Qaeda chapter and strong connec
tions to Yemen, an example of a fail
ure in U.S foreign policy.
According to Feingold, there has
been a trivialization and neglect of
foreign policy, particularly by the
right in U.S. politics. He pointed to
how the idea of American excep
tionalism is often linked to Ameri
can foreign policy, something he
deemed "foolish."
"I believe that the U.S. can re
main the leading nation in the
world," he said. "But we cannot

keep briefly waking up from our
slumber to yell out, 'We are number
one!' and then go back to sleep."
Feingold encouraged Ameri
cans to be more involved as global
citizens, particularly by learning lan
guages.
After the talk, audience mem
bers posed questions on an array of
topics ranging from the U.S. role in
Egypt to intervention in Syria to the
possibility of an Iranian attack.
In response to a question on
why the United States is disliked in
some regions of the world, Fein
gold responded saying, "I think it
has to do with the U.S. support of
nations with tyrannical regimes. It
breeds a situation where people
can be sucked into protest or
worse, violence."
"Mr. Feingold's sincerity was ob
vious and he gave a number of co
gent reasons for greater engage
ment beyond our borders," said
Aaron Sekhri 'l5, who attended the
lecture. "His emphasis on the need
to become world citizens and chal
lenge ourselves in spheres alien to
us was inspiring."

rorism, bringing attention to ex
tremist groups in Africa such as al-
Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb
(AQIM). Feingold cited Somalia as
a state tainted with piracy and also
discussed the emergence of an al-
Qaeda chapter and strong connec
tions to Yemen, an example of a fail
ure in U.S foreign policy.
According to Feingold, there has
been a trivialization and neglect of
foreign policy, particularly by the
right in U.S. politics. He pointed to
how the idea of American excep
tionalism is often linked to Ameri
can foreign policy, something he
deemed "foolish."
"I believe that the U.S. can re
main the leading nation in the
world," he said. "But we cannot

keep briefly waking up from our
slumber to yell out, 'We are number
one!' and then go back to sleep."
Feingold encouraged Ameri
cans to be more involved as global
citizens, particularly by learning lan
guages.
After the talk, audience mem
bers posed questions on an array of
topics ranging from the U.S. role in
Egypt to intervention in Syria to the
possibility of an Iranian attack.
In response to a question on
why the United States is disliked in
some regions of the world, Fein
gold responded saying, "I think it
has to do with the U.S. support of
nations with tyrannical regimes. It
breeds a situation where people
can be sucked into protest or
worse, violence."
"Mr. Feingold's sincerity was ob
vious and he gave a number of co
gent reasons for greater engage
ment beyond our borders," said
Aaron Sekhri 'l5, who attended the
lecture. "His emphasis on the need
to become world citizens and chal
lenge ourselves in spheres alien to
us was inspiring."
