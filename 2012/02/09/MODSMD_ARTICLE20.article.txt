# WOMEN HOST TROJANS
## STANFORD, USC MEET AT MAPLES 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Pac-12 Conference comes
full circle at Maples Pavilion
tonight, with the USC women's bas
ketball team visiting the Farm for a
rematch of the opening game,
which took place in Los Angeles at
the end of December.
Since that 61-53 victory for Stan
ford at the Galen Center, the two
teams have had very different sea
sons. In tonight's contest the No. 4
Cardinal (20-1,11-0 Pac-12) will be
looking for its 17th straight win and
the opportunity to tighten its grip
on the top spot in the conference,
while the Trojans (12-10, 6-5) are
coming off a narrow home loss to
Washington and are currently in a
three-way tie for fourth place.
Stanford leads the all-time series

against USC 48-19, and has won the
last nine meetings, stretching back
to the 2007-08 season when the Tro
jans edged the Cardinal with a 73-
72 in Los Angeles.
In the Cardinal's last time out,
Stanford destroyed Arizona 91-51
in Tucson. For the third time this
season, junior forward Joslyn Tin
kle outscored the Ogwumike sis
ters, setting a new career high of 22
points and tying her career best
with 11 rebounds. It is hard, though,
to ignore what senior forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike and sopho
more forward Chiney Ogwumike
bring to the Card. They may not
have made the headlines in the Ari
zona game, but still hit double fig
ures in points, with Chiney Ogwu
mike grabbing her fifth straight
double-double.
USC also has its own sister act to
count on in senior guard Briana
Gilbreath and redshirt junior guard
Stefanie Gilbreath, but the compar
ison to the Ogwumikes is perhaps
unfair. Briana Gilbreath leads the

Trojans in points with 12.2 per
game, but her sister is only playing
in her first full season after sitting
out three full years due to two ACL
tears and playing only limited time
last season as a result of additional
injuries. Unfortunately, Stefanie
Gilbreath is not the only Trojan to
have struggled with serious knee in
juries, and graduate student guard
Jacki Gemelos, a northern Califor
nia native in her sixth year (and the
nation's top recruit in 2006), will
again be absent from the lineup
after suffering her fourth ACL tear
last December.
The Ogwumike sisters each
have three Pac-12 Player of the
Week awards this season and are
first and third in both shooting and
rebounding in the Pac-12, with
Nneka ahead in points per game,
20.3 to 16.8, and Chiney leading in
rebounds per game, 12.4 to 12.1.
The Trojans, however, may have
greater depth in shooting. While the
Ogwumikes are the only Stanford
players shooting in the top 30 of the
Pac-12, USC has more balanced
scoring with four players in the top
30: senior guard Ashley Corral,
sophomore forward Cassie Har
berts, Briana Gilbreath and junior
forward Christina Marinacci. With
13.0,12.1,11.3 and 10.1 points per
game, respectively, their combined
contribution outweighs that from
Stanford's sisters.

On three-point shooting, too,
USC could look for an advantage.
It currently leads the Pac-12 in
shooting percentage from outside
the arc at 35 percent, nine places
ahead of Stanford's 26.4. USC hits
6.36 shots from downtown per
game compared to Stanford's 4.73,
and Corral leads the conference
with 2.91 threes per contest. She
now tops USC's all-time list with
282 three-pointers.
Interestingly, the situation in
three-point defense is the com
plete oppositeiThe Cardinal is first,
allowing only 24.1 percent, and the
Trojans are 10th with 32.1. Should
USC manage to nullify the pres
ence of Stanford's forwards and
succeed in keeping it outside, or
should the Card achieve the same
with the Trojans, these two statistics
will be directly tested.
Across the Bay, in the other
game tonight between southern
and northern California teams,
third-place UCLA (12-10,7-4) will
face second-place Cal (17-6, 8-3).
While fans of Stanford women's
basketball may be focused on the
action on campus, the result of this
other contest could be significant.
Should the Card win and Cal lose,
Stanford would have a four-game
lead with just six to play.
The contest between Stanford
and USC starts at Maples at 6 p.m.
tonight.

Stanford leads
the all-time
series against
USC 48-19


MEHMET INONU/The Stanford Daily
Senior guard Lindy La Rocque (above) and the No. 4 Stanford women's basketball team look to continue their
recent hot streak when USC comes to town. The Cardinal has won 16 straight and is 11-0 in Pac-12 play.
The Pac-12 Conference comes
full circle at Maples Pavilion
tonight, with the USC women's bas
ketball team visiting the Farm for a
rematch of the opening game,
which took place in Los Angeles at
the end of December.
Since that 61-53 victory for Stan
ford at the Galen Center, the two
teams have had very different sea
sons. In tonight's contest the No. 4
Cardinal (20-1,11-0 Pac-12) will be
looking for its 17th straight win and
the opportunity to tighten its grip
on the top spot in the conference,
while the Trojans (12-10, 6-5) are
coming off a narrow home loss to
Washington and are currently in a
three-way tie for fourth place.
Stanford leads the all-time series

against USC 48-19, and has won the
last nine meetings, stretching back
to the 2007-08 season when the Tro
jans edged the Cardinal with a 73-
72 in Los Angeles.
In the Cardinal's last time out,
Stanford destroyed Arizona 91-51
in Tucson. For the third time this
season, junior forward Joslyn Tin
kle outscored the Ogwumike sis
ters, setting a new career high of 22
points and tying her career best
with 11 rebounds. It is hard, though,
to ignore what senior forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike and sopho
more forward Chiney Ogwumike
bring to the Card. They may not
have made the headlines in the Ari
zona game, but still hit double fig
ures in points, with Chiney Ogwu
mike grabbing her fifth straight
double-double.
USC also has its own sister act to
count on in senior guard Briana
Gilbreath and redshirt junior guard
Stefanie Gilbreath, but the compar
ison to the Ogwumikes is perhaps
unfair. Briana Gilbreath leads the

Trojans in points with 12.2 per
game, but her sister is only playing
in her first full season after sitting
out three full years due to two ACL
tears and playing only limited time
last season as a result of additional
injuries. Unfortunately, Stefanie
Gilbreath is not the only Trojan to
have struggled with serious knee in
juries, and graduate student guard
Jacki Gemelos, a northern Califor
nia native in her sixth year (and the
nation's top recruit in 2006), will
again be absent from the lineup
after suffering her fourth ACL tear
last December.
The Ogwumike sisters each
have three Pac-12 Player of the
Week awards this season and are
first and third in both shooting and
rebounding in the Pac-12, with
Nneka ahead in points per game,
20.3 to 16.8, and Chiney leading in
rebounds per game, 12.4 to 12.1.
The Trojans, however, may have
greater depth in shooting. While the
Ogwumikes are the only Stanford
players shooting in the top 30 of the
Pac-12, USC has more balanced
scoring with four players in the top
30: senior guard Ashley Corral,
sophomore forward Cassie Har
berts, Briana Gilbreath and junior
forward Christina Marinacci. With
13.0,12.1,11.3 and 10.1 points per
game, respectively, their combined
contribution outweighs that from
Stanford's sisters.

On three-point shooting, too,
USC could look for an advantage.
It currently leads the Pac-12 in
shooting percentage from outside
the arc at 35 percent, nine places
ahead of Stanford's 26.4. USC hits
6.36 shots from downtown per
game compared to Stanford's 4.73,
and Corral leads the conference
with 2.91 threes per contest. She
now tops USC's all-time list with
282 three-pointers.
Interestingly, the situation in
three-point defense is the com
plete oppositeiThe Cardinal is first,
allowing only 24.1 percent, and the
Trojans are 10th with 32.1. Should
USC manage to nullify the pres
ence of Stanford's forwards and
succeed in keeping it outside, or
should the Card achieve the same
with the Trojans, these two statistics
will be directly tested.
Across the Bay, in the other
game tonight between southern
and northern California teams,
third-place UCLA (12-10,7-4) will
face second-place Cal (17-6, 8-3).
While fans of Stanford women's
basketball may be focused on the
action on campus, the result of this
other contest could be significant.
Should the Card win and Cal lose,
Stanford would have a four-game
lead with just six to play.
The contest between Stanford
and USC starts at Maples at 6 p.m.
tonight.
