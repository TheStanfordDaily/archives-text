# WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Season finale pits Card vs. Cal 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
The stage has been set.
In the grand finale of the regu
lar season, the No. 8 Stanford
women's swimming and diving
team will square off against No. 1
California at the Avery Aquatic
Center this Saturday. The Golden
Bears are coming into the meet
with an undefeated dual-meet
record while the Cardinal is 8-1,
with the sole loss coming against
No. 2 Florida.
Despite Cal's current status as
the best team in the nation, Stan
ford's lower ranking doesn't re
flect the team's recent tenacity in
defeating higher-ranked oppo
nents. Two weeks ago, the
women's swimmers upset No. 5
Arizona at home, and just a week
ago they took down No. 7 USC on
the road. What's even more im
pressive is that in both of these
wins, the Cardinal had already
competed in another meet the
previous day. The upset-minded
Cardinal hopes to pull off one last

shocker against the top team in
the country and end Cal's bid for
its first undefeated regular season
since 2006.
Cal's lineup certainly looks
formidable across the board.
Three Golden Bear swimmers al
ready have automatic NCAA
qualifying times a feat that not
many college swimmers have ac
complished during the regular
season.
Leading the way for Cal is jun
ior Caitlin Leverenz, considered
to be one of the best swimmers in
the nation. At the 2011 NCAA
Championships, she placed in the
top five in three individual events.
She also swam the breaststroke
legs of the team's 200 and 400
medley relays, both of which won
the national title. So far this sea
son, Le verenz has already clocked
automatic NCAA qualifying
times in five individual events.
One of the best matchups in
Saturday's showdown will be be
tween Leverenz and Stanford's
sophomore Maya Dißado. As
elite national swimmers, the two

stars are alike in many ways. Al
though Dißado and Leverenz
specialize in different strokes,
they both own some of the na
tion's fastest times. Dißado is cur
rently the fastest swimmer in the
200 backstroke by more than
seven-tenths of a second while
Leverenz co-owns the fastest time
in the 200 breaststroke.
What's even more interesting
is that Dißado and Leverenz
overlap in their strengths. As two
of the country's premier individ
ual medley swimmers, Dißado
has the nation's second-fastest
time in the 200 individual medley,
a full second ahead of fourth
ranked Leverenz. In the longer
400 individual medley event, Lev
erenz ranks second, just one place
ahead of Dißado. Drawing out
their similarities even further, Di-
Rado was named the 2011 Pac-10
Freshman of the Year while her
slightly older competitor won the
same award in 2010.
Another key matchup to
watch for will be the sprint-off
between Stanford senior Sam
Woodward and Cal senior Liv
Jensen. The two accomplished
veterans have both been critical
to their respective teams' success
in dual-meet situations and are
expected to be individual nation
al title contenders come March.
In comparison to each other,
both swimmers are ranked in the
top five in the 50 freestyle, with
Jensen second and Woodward
fifth. But not to be outdone,
Woodward has the country's sec
ond-fastest time in the 100 but
terfly.
On the diving board, Stanford
sophomore Stephanie Phipps
will carry the burden against a
deep Cal diving squad. At the
Cardinal Diving Invitational in
mid-January, Phipps outscored
senior Molly Hayes, Cal's top
diver, in both the one-meter and
three-meter springboard events.
Considering that Cal has three
divers who already have NCAA
regional-qualifying scores,
Phipps will likely have to repeat
those victories if Stanford hopes
to cancel out Cal's depth.
The showdown between Stan
ford and Cal will begin at 1 p.m.
this Saturday at the Avery Aquat
ic Center.
