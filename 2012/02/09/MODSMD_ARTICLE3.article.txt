# Co-terms strong as honors theses decline
## SUES report proposes capstone projects for seniors 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
In recent years, the number of undergraduates
pursuing co-terminal degrees has remained
steady; by contrast, the number writing honors
theses has steadily declined.
In response to this data, the Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford (SUES) has pro
posed several measures to encourage seniors to
complete capstone projects before graduation,
whether in the form of an honors thesis or anoth
er endeavor.
Ayodele Thomas, an assistant dean in the
School of Humanities and Sciences said in an
email to The Daily that the number of students

pursuing co-terminal degrees has "remained sta
ble" over the past 10 years.
"The 10 year trend indicates a decline in the
number of students completing honors in the
School of Humanities and Sciences," Thomas
noted.
There is no consensus as to the reason for the
drop in students writing honors theses.
"I think there hasn't been enough study of
what factors influence the numbers of students ap
plying for or completing these programs to say
with any confidence what contributes to the
trends," said Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation Harry Elam.
