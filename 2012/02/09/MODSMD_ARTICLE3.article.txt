# Co-terms strong as honors theses decline
## SUES report proposes capstone projects for seniors 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
In recent years, the number of undergraduates
pursuing co-terminal degrees has remained
steady; by contrast, the number writing honors
theses has steadily declined.
In response to this data, the Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford (SUES) has pro
posed several measures to encourage seniors to
complete capstone projects before graduation,
whether in the form of an honors thesis or anoth
er endeavor.
Ayodele Thomas, an assistant dean in the
School of Humanities and Sciences said in an
email to The Daily that the number of students

pursuing co-terminal degrees has "remained sta
ble" over the past 10 years.
"The 10 year trend indicates a decline in the
number of students completing honors in the
School of Humanities and Sciences," Thomas
noted.
There is no consensus as to the reason for the
drop in students writing honors theses.
"I think there hasn't been enough study of
what factors influence the numbers of students ap
plying for or completing these programs to say
with any confidence what contributes to the
trends," said Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation Harry Elam.
"Over the same period of time
[as the honors declined], there has
been an increase in two other pro
grams: co-terminal degrees and mi
nors," said Susan McConnell, biolo
gy professor and co-chair of SUES,
referring to an increase in co-termi
nal degrees and minors over the
past two decades, despite the high
numbers stabilizing in the past 10
years.
McConnell also stated that one
would need to conduct a more in
depth study into honors programs
to be sure of the reasons behind
their decline in popularity.
The Commission Undergradu
ate Education (CUE) report pub
lished 17 years ago stated that
about one in four students wrote
an honors thesis. This figure is now
closer to one in five, according to
McConnell.
"[The SUES report] is not sug
gesting in any way that every stu
dent should do an honors thesis,"
McConnell said.
"My main interest is in ensuring
that as many students as possible
have the opportunity to engage in
a culminating experience . . .
rather than in increasing the num
ber of honors students per se,"
Elam said.
McConnell echoed Elam's sen
timent.
"We would like to see every
senior do some sort of capstone ...
that doesn't have to be a research
based honors thesis," McConnell
said.
"There are a number of ways in
which students can have this kind
of experience, including honors
and other kinds of final project ex
periences," Elam said. He noted

that there are already many engi
neering programs that require stu
dents to complete some sort of
final project.
Both Elam and McConnell em
phasized the fact there is no move
ment to require senior honors the
ses.
"In keeping with Stanford's cul
ture and students, the emphasis
will be on multiple options that stu
dents can choose from according
to their interests rather than man
dating particular forms or discipli
nary distributions," Elam said.
The SUES report, presented to
the Faculty Senate on Jan. 26, sug
gested the creation of a "residen
tial research college" which would
have an atmosphere conducive to
collaborative learning and writing
research-based theses.
McConnell said that responses
thus far from faculty regarding the
SUES proposals have been very
positive.
"[ln] both the faculty and the
University administration there's a
lot of excitement, a lot of energy,"
McConnell said.
The SUES report cited the new
format of the political science hon
ors thesis as a potential model for
the rest of the University. The pro
gram is different from other hon
ors programs in that it takes place
over the course of two years as op
posed to just one.
"[Reviewing the curriculum] is
a new way of infusing energy into
the curriculum and that's clearly
happening," McConnell said of the
potential for positive change from
the SUES report.
"Overall," she added, "the re
sponse has been that there is ener
gy, enthusiasm, and a renewed
commitment to undergraduates at
Stanford."

that as many students as possible
have the opportunity to engage in
a culminating experience . . .
rather than in increasing the num
ber of honors students per se,"
Elam said.
McConnell echoed Elam's sen
timent.
"We would like to see every
senior do some sort of capstone ...
that doesn't have to be a research
based honors thesis," McConnell
said.
"There are a number of ways in
which students can have this kind
of experience, including honors
and other kinds of final project ex
periences," Elam said. He noted

that there are already many engi
neering programs that require stu
dents to complete some sort of
final project.
Both Elam and McConnell em
phasized the fact there is no move
ment to require senior honors the
ses.
"In keeping with Stanford's cul
ture and students, the emphasis
will be on multiple options that stu
dents can choose from according
to their interests rather than man
dating particular forms or discipli
nary distributions," Elam said.
The SUES report, presented to
the Faculty Senate on Jan. 26, sug
gested the creation of a "residen
tial research college" which would
have an atmosphere conducive to
collaborative learning and writing
research-based theses.
McConnell said that responses
thus far from faculty regarding the
SUES proposals have been very
positive.
"[ln] both the faculty and the
University administration there's a
lot of excitement, a lot of energy,"
McConnell said.
The SUES report cited the new
format of the political science hon
ors thesis as a potential model for
the rest of the University. The pro
gram is different from other hon
ors programs in that it takes place
over the course of two years as op
posed to just one.
"[Reviewing the curriculum] is
a new way of infusing energy into
the curriculum and that's clearly
happening," McConnell said of the
potential for positive change from
the SUES report.
"Overall," she added, "the re
sponse has been that there is ener
gy, enthusiasm, and a renewed
commitment to undergraduates at
Stanford."
