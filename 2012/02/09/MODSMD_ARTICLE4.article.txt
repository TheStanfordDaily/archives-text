## Thrun starts webbased university 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Computer science professor Sebastian
Thrun announced the launch last month of
his new online university, Udacity, inspired
by the massive response to his Stanford
course, Introduction to Artificial Intelli
gence, which was open to the public online
this past fall. Contrary to widespread re
ports otherwise, Thrun will maintain his po
sition as a research professor in the Stanford
Computer Science Department.
Thrun decided to offer "Intro to A.1." on
line last quarter as an experiment, expecting
a turnout of around 500. When more than
160,000 people enrolled in the course,Thrun
adapted the course content to the web for
mat using an interactive platform called
Know Labs. In a speech last month at the
Digital Life Design (DLD) Conference in
Munich, Thrun described the experience as
life changing, saying that after teaching on
such a large and far-reaching scale, he
couldn't return to Stanford classes.
