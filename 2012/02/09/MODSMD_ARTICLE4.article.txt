## Thrun starts webbased university 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Computer science professor Sebastian
Thrun announced the launch last month of
his new online university, Udacity, inspired
by the massive response to his Stanford
course, Introduction to Artificial Intelli
gence, which was open to the public online
this past fall. Contrary to widespread re
ports otherwise, Thrun will maintain his po
sition as a research professor in the Stanford
Computer Science Department.
Thrun decided to offer "Intro to A.1." on
line last quarter as an experiment, expecting
a turnout of around 500. When more than
160,000 people enrolled in the course,Thrun
adapted the course content to the web for
mat using an interactive platform called
Know Labs. In a speech last month at the
Digital Life Design (DLD) Conference in
Munich, Thrun described the experience as
life changing, saying that after teaching on
such a large and far-reaching scale, he
couldn't return to Stanford classes.
In his DLD speech, Thrun de
tailed emails he received from stu
dents all over the world, including
accounts from people claiming the
class had changed their careers,
saved their lives or kept them mo
tivated during hard times.
"There was a guy in the fields
of Afghanistan under mortar at
tack running for his life every
day, but he spent an hour at night
to do his homework assignments
and to learn about A.1.," Thrun
said in the DLD speech. "That's
unbelievable."
Udacity, a rebranding and re
purposing of Know Labs, is
Thrun's attempt to reach an even
larger audience with his teaching.
Currently, the site hosts courses
that focus on projects a student
can undertake, starting with "CS
101: Building a Search Engine"
and continuing to topics as ad
vanced as driverless vehicle pro
gramming.
Following the Udacity an
nouncement, confusion arose
about whether Thrun would
leave Stanford. Thrun resigned
his tenure last spring due to his
dual roles at Stanford and
Google but remains on staff as a
research professor, accountable
for 20 percent work time, mostly
to advise graduate students.
Jennifer Widom, chair of the
Computer Science Department,
said that Stanford enforces a
strict limit of two years of ab
sence in any seven-year period
for tenured professors. Thrun
reached this limit in various
leaves of absence spent as a
Google Fellow, working on re
search projects including his fa
mous autonomous car project.
He resigned his tenure in April of
last year to move into the less-in
volved research role and contin

ue at Google.
In his DLD speech, Thrun de
scribed the effects of the online
A.I. experience saying, "Having
done this, I can't teach at Stan
ford again." Many interpreted
this as a resignation from Stan
ford, but, in fact, the teaching as
pect of Thrun's professorship was
already purely voluntary.
"Nothing he said was false, but
sometimes it's misleading,"
Widom said. "He probably won't
teach at Stanford again, but his 20
percent research appointment
has no expectation of teaching
anyway."
Rather, Thrun meant that he
intends to redirect his voluntary
teaching efforts toward only the
new online effort.
"I feel like there's a red pill
and a blue pill," Thrun said in the
speech, alluding to a scene in
"The Matrix." "I've taken the red
pill, and I've seen Wonderland.
We can really change the world
with education."
Although Stanford has of
fered some courses available on
line for years, the trend toward
online courses has recently
grown. In addition to Thrun's
course, the Computer Science
Department offered machine
learning and introduction-to
databases classes through the
same program, and Stanford has
partnered with Apple to include
courses in the company's recent
iTunes U revamp.
The recently published Study
of Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES) report cited on
line distribution of courses as an
area to address in the near future,
as very limited policies currently
exist on the matter.
"There's huge stuff happening
with courses going online and no
body knows what they're doing
yet," Widom said of the report's
call for new policies.
