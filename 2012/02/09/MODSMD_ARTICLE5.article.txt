## Units reflect workload, admins say Despite student gripes, units found to correlate to difficulty 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
A somewhat-frequent student
gripe is the seemingly weak correla
tion between number of units and
class difficulty or time expectation.
However, according to Susan
McConnell, professor of biology
and co-chair of the Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford
(SUES), a surprisingly strong corre
lation exists between the number of
units a class earns and the time stu
dents spend each week on that class.
But what exactly is a unit?
"The bulletin sets out that the av
erage amount of time per unit is
three hours; one hour in class and
two hours outside of class," said
Kirsti Copeland, director of residen
tially based advising. "Of course, in
practice the amount of time a stu
dent spends on a class varies from
student to student, based on a stu
dent's preparation and investment,
and to a certain extent from class to
class."
Copeland further explained that
the instructor of a given course de
termines the number of units for a
course in consultation with others in
his or her department.
