## Units reflect workload, admins say Despite student gripes, units found to correlate to difficulty 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
A somewhat-frequent student
gripe is the seemingly weak correla
tion between number of units and
class difficulty or time expectation.
However, according to Susan
McConnell, professor of biology
and co-chair of the Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford
(SUES), a surprisingly strong corre
lation exists between the number of
units a class earns and the time stu
dents spend each week on that class.
But what exactly is a unit?
"The bulletin sets out that the av
erage amount of time per unit is
three hours; one hour in class and
two hours outside of class," said
Kirsti Copeland, director of residen
tially based advising. "Of course, in
practice the amount of time a stu
dent spends on a class varies from
student to student, based on a stu
dent's preparation and investment,
and to a certain extent from class to
class."
Copeland further explained that
the instructor of a given course de
termines the number of units for a
course in consultation with others in
his or her department.
"Some departments have a typ
ical number of units for each class
and instructors then gear the
amount of work they assign to that
unit load," she said.
Sharon Palmer, associate vice
provost for undergraduate educa
tion, recently conducted a study
that looked at student reports of
hours per week spent on work
outside of class per unit of credit.
These were based on end quarter
evaluations, and the study was
limited and preliminary.
"The overall average for all un
dergraduate courses was very
close to the Registrar's guideline
of two hours per week outside of
class per unit of credit," Palmer
stated in an email. "There was, of
course, some variation between

department or program averages,
and considerable variation be
tween individual class averages
even within the same department.
But overall there was much less
discrepancy between units than
anecdote would suggest."
However, Copeland noted,
"any advisor hears anecdotally
that particular courses are more
or less work than their allotted
units."
This year, ME 101, an engi
neering class that is notoriously
one of the most time-intensive
classes at Stanford, was upgraded
from three units to four units. This
process has no standard operat
ing procedure, however, and
Copeland stated that there is no
established frequency for the
reevaluation of units.
"Units would be likely be
reevaluated if the faculty become
aware that their course is radically
more or less work than is expected
per unit," she said.

When asked about how this
would impact the engineering de
partment, Copeland answered,
"From my perspective as an advi
sor, the more profound impact of
raising the units in a particular
course is encouraging students to
take fewer courses in the quarter
when they have that course, and
therefore creating a more bal
anced and reasonable schedule."
"In my personal experience, it
is better to use the unit count as an
initial suggested guideline and to
work with each student individual
ly to help him or her determine if
what he or she has chosen for the
quarter is a reasonable load,"
Copeland said. "So with most stu
dents, I don't have a conversation
about the equity of units per se,
rather what is appropriate for them
in that quarter after they have re
viewed the syllabi."
