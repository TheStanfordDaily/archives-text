## Students flock to CS major, classes 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following a near-doubling in 2010, the number
of undergraduates majoring in computer science
(CS) continues to rise rapidly, with 429 Stanford un
dergraduates currently declared in a CS major ac
cording to an automatically generated list on the
Stanford CS website.
This increase follows a trend that has been visi
ble since the late '7os and is composed of numerous
ups and downs, according to computer science pro
fessor Eric Roberts. Roberts attributed the popular
ity in the 'Bos and '9os to the idea that no matter
what a student was majoring in, he or she would
benefit from some kind of computer science back
ground, increasing the number of students who
took CS courses.
"Now, students are majoring in CS because they
are excited and engaged," Roberts said. He added
that about 90 percent of all Stanford undergradu
ates enroll in at least one introductory CS class be
fore they graduate. He continued, "These students
get excited and decide to major in CS."
Roberts also confirmed that computer science is
the second most popular major at Stanford, after
human biology. In an email to The Daily, Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education Harry Elam
added psychology, biology, economics, English, his
tory, international relations and political science to
the list of the largest majors by degree conferred in
2010-11.
"Overall, the School of Humanities and Sciences
has seen a slight decrease in degrees conferred in
the past twenty years (mostly in humanities and so
cial sciences), with engineering and earth sciences
each up," Elam wrote.
The Computer Science Department overhauled
its curriculum in 2008. Mehran Sahami, an associate
professor of computer science, explained some of
these curriculum changes.
"We modified the CS major to allow students to
choose a track ... in CS after completing a small set
of core classes," Sahami said. "This structure pro
vides students with much more flexibility in the
courses they can take for their major. We also al
lowed for more interdisciplinary work by allowing
courses from other departments that are relevant to
particular tracks in CS to also count toward the
major."
Both Roberts and Sahami noticed an increase in
undergraduates taking CS courses after the over
haul.
"We wanted to measure the impact of the cur
riculum change, so we started paying very close at
tention to changes in enrollment," Sahami said. "We
noticed the interest in the department and the num
ber of majors increased substantially."
