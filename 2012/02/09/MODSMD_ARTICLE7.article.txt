## Students flock to CS major, classes 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following a near-doubling in 2010, the number
of undergraduates majoring in computer science
(CS) continues to rise rapidly, with 429 Stanford un
dergraduates currently declared in a CS major ac
cording to an automatically generated list on the
Stanford CS website.
This increase follows a trend that has been visi
ble since the late '7os and is composed of numerous
ups and downs, according to computer science pro
fessor Eric Roberts. Roberts attributed the popular
ity in the 'Bos and '9os to the idea that no matter
what a student was majoring in, he or she would
benefit from some kind of computer science back
ground, increasing the number of students who
took CS courses.
"Now, students are majoring in CS because they
are excited and engaged," Roberts said. He added
that about 90 percent of all Stanford undergradu
ates enroll in at least one introductory CS class be
fore they graduate. He continued, "These students
get excited and decide to major in CS."
Roberts also confirmed that computer science is
the second most popular major at Stanford, after
human biology. In an email to The Daily, Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education Harry Elam
added psychology, biology, economics, English, his
tory, international relations and political science to
the list of the largest majors by degree conferred in
2010-11.
"Overall, the School of Humanities and Sciences
has seen a slight decrease in degrees conferred in
the past twenty years (mostly in humanities and so
cial sciences), with engineering and earth sciences
each up," Elam wrote.
The Computer Science Department overhauled
its curriculum in 2008. Mehran Sahami, an associate
professor of computer science, explained some of
these curriculum changes.
"We modified the CS major to allow students to
choose a track ... in CS after completing a small set
of core classes," Sahami said. "This structure pro
vides students with much more flexibility in the
courses they can take for their major. We also al
lowed for more interdisciplinary work by allowing
courses from other departments that are relevant to
particular tracks in CS to also count toward the
major."
Both Roberts and Sahami noticed an increase in
undergraduates taking CS courses after the over
haul.
"We wanted to measure the impact of the cur
riculum change, so we started paying very close at
tention to changes in enrollment," Sahami said. "We
noticed the interest in the department and the num
ber of majors increased substantially."

"Two years after the overhaul,
there was a near-doubling of CS
majors," he added.
Both Roberts and Sahami
talked about the appeal of intro
ductory CS courses, such as
CSIO6A, that pull undergradu
ates in and result in them deciding
to major in CS.
"These courses change some
one's efficacy," Roberts said. "So
that they can do more things at
once,"
Roberts added that the intro
ductory courses allow for a very
tangible way for the students to
see change and improvement in
their skills, especially when creat
ing applications for the class.
Sahami expressed a similar
view.
"It is about the notion of em
powerment of what someone can
do in computing," he said. "Some
one with an idea and computer
skills can build something."
James Nam 'l4 said he enjoyed
CSIO6A when he took it last year.
"I wanted to do more research
in CS so I declared my first year,"
Nam said. He attributed the num
ber of job opportunities available
for CS majors as a reason for de
claring.
Jay Pat el, 'l4, was thinking
about majoring in CS when he
came to Stanford.
"I've been playing around
with computers for a long time
now, since fourth grade," he said,
"so I came in knowing I wanted to
do something with computers."
"Right from the beginning,
CSIO6A did a really good job of
making people excited about CS,"

Patel added. "I have many friends
who became majors because of
that class. Some of my friends take
CS because they want to do a start
up in the future."
Both professors also attrib
uted part of this increase in stu
dents choosing to major in CS to
the economy.
"There are tremendous eco
nomic opportunities in computer
science," Sahami said, adding that
there is an enormous demand for
those who graduate with CS skills.
"After the economic crash in
2007, computer science was the
only option for some students,"
Roberts said, adding that other
options for students disappeared
as demand for jobs in business de
creased during the downturn.
While many students are
choosing this major and graduat
ing with this degree, "the demand
is still outstripping the supply," Sa
hami said. "We still see the num
bers continue to grow."
"It's amazing how few people
we are training relative to the jobs
available," Roberts said. He added
that the CS department doesn't
drive anyone away because of this
high demand.
According to a Daily article
published Jan. 11, the CS depart
ment has been trying to increase fe
male student involvement in CS
courses after CSIO6A. While he
said he is not sure if there has been
a noticeable increase in interest
from female students, Roberts said
that the courses are becoming
more balanced in enrollment be
tween the sexes.
"It is important to raise the
numbers . . . and have more
women entering the field," Roberts
said.

that class. Some of my friends take
CS because they want to do a start
up in the future."
Both professors also attrib
uted part of this increase in stu
dents choosing to major in CS to
the economy.
"There are tremendous eco
nomic opportunities in computer
science," Sahami said, adding that
there is an enormous demand for
those who graduate with CS skills.
"After the economic crash in
2007, computer science was the
only option for some students,"
Roberts said, adding that other
options for students disappeared
as demand for jobs in business de
creased during the downturn.
While many students are
choosing this major and graduat
ing with this degree, "the demand
is still outstripping the supply," Sa
hami said. "We still see the num
bers continue to grow."
"It's amazing how few people
we are training relative to the jobs
available," Roberts said. He added
that the CS department doesn't
drive anyone away because of this
high demand.
According to a Daily article
published Jan. 11, the CS depart
ment has been trying to increase fe
male student involvement in CS
courses after CSIO6A. While he
said he is not sure if there has been
a noticeable increase in interest
from female students, Roberts said
that the courses are becoming
more balanced in enrollment be
tween the sexes.
"It is important to raise the
numbers . . . and have more
women entering the field," Roberts
said.

Following a near-doubling in 2010, the number
of undergraduates majoring in computer science
(CS) continues to rise rapidly, with 429 Stanford un
dergraduates currently declared in a CS major ac
cording to an automatically generated list on the
Stanford CS website.
This increase follows a trend that has been visi
ble since the late '7os and is composed of numerous
ups and downs, according to computer science pro
fessor Eric Roberts. Roberts attributed the popular
ity in the 'Bos and '9os to the idea that no matter
what a student was majoring in, he or she would
benefit from some kind of computer science back
ground, increasing the number of students who
took CS courses.
"Now, students are majoring in CS because they
are excited and engaged," Roberts said. He added
that about 90 percent of all Stanford undergradu
ates enroll in at least one introductory CS class be
fore they graduate. He continued, "These students
get excited and decide to major in CS."
Roberts also confirmed that computer science is
the second most popular major at Stanford, after
human biology. In an email to The Daily, Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education Harry Elam
added psychology, biology, economics, English, his
tory, international relations and political science to
the list of the largest majors by degree conferred in
2010-11.
"Overall, the School of Humanities and Sciences
has seen a slight decrease in degrees conferred in
the past twenty years (mostly in humanities and so
cial sciences), with engineering and earth sciences
each up," Elam wrote.
The Computer Science Department overhauled
its curriculum in 2008. Mehran Sahami, an associate
professor of computer science, explained some of
these curriculum changes.
"We modified the CS major to allow students to
choose a track ... in CS after completing a small set
of core classes," Sahami said. "This structure pro
vides students with much more flexibility in the
courses they can take for their major. We also al
lowed for more interdisciplinary work by allowing
courses from other departments that are relevant to
particular tracks in CS to also count toward the
major."
Both Roberts and Sahami noticed an increase in
undergraduates taking CS courses after the over
haul.
"We wanted to measure the impact of the cur
riculum change, so we started paying very close at
tention to changes in enrollment," Sahami said. "We
noticed the interest in the department and the num
ber of majors increased substantially."

"Two years after the overhaul,
there was a near-doubling of CS
majors," he added.
Both Roberts and Sahami
talked about the appeal of intro
ductory CS courses, such as
CSIO6A, that pull undergradu
ates in and result in them deciding
to major in CS.
"These courses change some
one's efficacy," Roberts said. "So
that they can do more things at
once,"
Roberts added that the intro
ductory courses allow for a very
tangible way for the students to
see change and improvement in
their skills, especially when creat
ing applications for the class.
Sahami expressed a similar
view.
"It is about the notion of em
powerment of what someone can
do in computing," he said. "Some
one with an idea and computer
skills can build something."
James Nam 'l4 said he enjoyed
CSIO6A when he took it last year.
"I wanted to do more research
in CS so I declared my first year,"
Nam said. He attributed the num
ber of job opportunities available
for CS majors as a reason for de
claring.
Jay Pat el, 'l4, was thinking
about majoring in CS when he
came to Stanford.
"I've been playing around
with computers for a long time
now, since fourth grade," he said,
"so I came in knowing I wanted to
do something with computers."
"Right from the beginning,
CSIO6A did a really good job of
making people excited about CS,"

Patel added. "I have many friends

that class. Some of my friends take
