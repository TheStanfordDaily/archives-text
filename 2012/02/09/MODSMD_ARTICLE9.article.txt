## New Manzanita dorm in the works 
### TAYLOR GROSSAAAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford University plans to
begin construction of a new dorm
in the Manzanita complex, sched
uled to open in 2013, according to
the Study of Undergraduate Edu
cation at Stanford (SUES) report.
The report also suggests that the
Manzanita dorm may have a
theme, although discussions are
ongoing and no final decision has
been made.
"The construction of the new
dorm in Manzanita represents a
confluence of the need for more
undergraduate living space and
the desire to create residential
spaces conducive to reflective and
creative work," said Jonathan
Berger, music professor and
SUES committee member. Berger
was the chair of the SUES sub
committee on residential learning.
According to other committee
members, residence overcrowd
ing is a serious issue at Stanford.
The SUES report addresses this
problem in its section on the resi
dential life and the state of the
current residential facilities.
Starting in the 19905, "stuffing"
became a common practice: Sin
gles were renovated into doubles,
and many doubles would be ad
justed into triples. Open spaces,
such as common rooms, were con
verted into dorm rooms as well.

The SUES report attributes
this problem to the decision to
guarantee undergraduates four
years of housing, which was not
always true of University policy.
The University has begun trying
to "unstuff" many residences. For
example, the construction of the
Munger graduate housing com
plex enabled Crothers and
Crothers Memorial to be shifted
to undergraduate use. However,
the problem remains acute.
According to the report, "the
significant issue is less the supply
of beds than the loss of shared
space." In order to improve resi
dential education, SUES has pro
posed the need to create these
communal areas in dorms that
enable conversation and activity.
"Dorms provide both rooms
with bed space for students but
also common areas for studying,
seminars, workgroups, socializ
ing, thinking about life, practicing
music, working on creative proj
ects and so on," said Nadeem
Hussain, associate professor of
philosophy. Hussain has been ap
pointed chair of the task force on
residential education. This com
mittee was established by Harry
Elam, vice provost for undergrad
uate education, and Deborah
Golder, associate vice provost
and dean of Residential Educa
tion, and has been charged with
developing a residential educa

tion plan for the new Manzanita
Dorm.
"The new dorm will have
state-of-the-art spaces of its own
for such purposes," Hussain said,
"but by providing more bed space
it will also allow us eventually to
free up common space in other
dorms across campus."
The SUES report suggests that
the design of any new undergrad
uate housing focus on creating
residential learning spaces, an ini
tiative which will begin with the
Manzanita residence.
Other dorms are also in need of
adjustment. The SUES report rec
ommends that "existing dorms
should be retrofitted to reclaim
and expand such spaces, including
multipurpose common areas, spe
cialized facilities (e.g., rehearsal
rooms, dance and digital arts stu
dios), and classrooms with appro
priate technology. Where that is
not possible, the university should
create 'neighborhood facilities.'
Dining areas should likewise be
designed and administered with
the goals of residential education
in view."
Depending on how seriously
the University takes the SUES
proposals, dorms around campus
may begin to undergo renova
tions to enact these changes.
