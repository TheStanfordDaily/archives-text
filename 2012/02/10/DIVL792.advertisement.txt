Stanford's Information Security Office Memo #11
Malevolent hackers probe Stanford's
network about one million times per day.
That works out to eleven probes per second.
On average, if takes hackers about two
minutes to start probing a computer once it
connects to Stanford's network.
Make sure your computer is up-to-date for
security patches and virus protection.
