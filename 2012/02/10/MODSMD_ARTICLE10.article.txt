Priya Satia 8.A., B.S. '95 delivered a
talk entitled "The Defense of Inhu
manity: Air Control and the British
Idea of Arabia" Thursday at An
nenberg Auditorium. The talk was
part of the Ethics and War Series
sponsored by the Bowen H. McCoy
Family Center for Ethics in Society.

Satia discussed the British in
vention of air control as a military
surveillance tactic in Iraq during the

interwar years. She said British per
ceptions of the region, which they
called "Arabia," allowed British of
ficials to reconcile their ethical scru
ples with the violence of the tactic,
and she added that these British ex
periences in Iraq have influenced
Americans' thinking about the re
gion today.
Once proven successful in Iraq,
Satia said, the tactic was exported to
the rest of the British Empire and
eventually found a place in conven
tional warfare.

Satia began her lecture dis

cussing the League of Nation's 1919
establishment of the mandate sys
tem after the First World War, fo
cusing on the British Mandate of
Mesopotamia (Iraq), which cob
bled together the former Ottoman
provinces of Mosul, Baghdad and
Basra in 1920.

Iraqis began resisting the British
involvement almost immediately, at
a time when mass nationalist resist
ance had started threatening the
British Empire at large, Satia said.
"Historians tended to empha
size [British] 'peaceableness' be
tween the wars... compared to the
more openly violent rivals on the
world stage at the time," Satia said.
"This indulgent view takes British
self-perceptions about the period a
bit too much at face value."
Satia contended that the "vio
lent system of aerial policing" im
plemented by the British in Iraq
was one of the solutions the British
used to counter the Iraqi rebellion.

Air control entailed policing
Iraq through Royal Air Force
(RAF) squadrons patrolling the
country, coordinating information
with ground forces to bombard sub
versive villages and tribes. The tac
tic, Satia said, was invented by the
British in Iraq.
The way in which British offi
cials managed to run a "successful
public relations" campaign to en
sure public ignorance of, or support
for, the air campaign was a main
focus of Satia's talk.

"[Positive public perception
was] part of a mode of imperial
statecraft that the British designed
to cope with the fact that they were
pursuing empire in an increasingly
anti-imperial world," Satia said.

Satia added that cultural rea
sons related to the British idea of
Arabia a romanticized construc
tion, rather than a geographic or
cultural reality explained why
the unprecedented air control

scheme was first devised in Iraq.
"Arabia was deemed a spy space
... a space where professional,
methodological and ethical stan
dards did not apply," Satia said, fol
lowing an exposition on the British
explorers of Arabia, including T. E.
Lawrence.

This perception allowed the Air
Force and officials to recast the air
control tactic as a humanitarian,
morally scrupulous act, guided by
the empathy the British explorers
had for the Arab tribes.

"Willful ignorance at the out
come [of bombing campaigns]
made air control sit more easily in
the British mind," Satia said. "Only
in Arabia did such fecklessness
make sense and thus make air con
trol acceptable."
Satia relied heavily on primary
sources of explorers and actors of
the period, shocking the audience
at points with quotes from British
military on the positive effect
bombing the Arabs had on them.
"The transposition of real Ara
bia into the Arabia of myth made
bombing palatable," Satia said.
"[As not] merely a simple racist de
humanization of Arabs but also of
long-circulating ideas about Arabia
as a place exempt from... 'this
worldliness.'"

"At the end of the day, this claim
to empathy was based literally on
sand," Satia said.

Satia went on to argue that the
United States learned the "wrong
lessons" from the British experi
ence in Iraq, highlighting U.S. use of

drones.
"Air control was a mechanism of
control for a region where a more
overt form of control was a political
impossibility," Satia said, drawing
parallels between the British expe
rience and the American.

On Feb. 7, the New York Times
reported that the number of staff in
the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad
16,000, costing $6 billion annually
would be slashed by as much as
half.
The article mentioned Iraqi sus
picion that the decision indicates a
U.S. move towards a discreet pres
ence in Iraq.
"It's 1932 all over again an

other chapter in the long history
of covert empire," Satia said, re
flecting on the development.
"The very thinness of the U.S.
presence continues to stoke wide
spread suspicions about a hidden
man guiding their country's
forces."
