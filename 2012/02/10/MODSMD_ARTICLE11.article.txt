## EDITORIAL Evaluating the 2012 Commencement speaker 
### 
r ■ ihe senior class presidents
announced this week that
J- Stanford's 2012 Com
mencement speaker will be
Newark Mayor Cory Booker '9l
MA '92. Although many of the
responses from members of the
Class of 2012 and others have
been positive, there has also been
a vocal sense of disappointment
at the selection of Mayor Booker.
Anecdotally, at least, there is a
feeling that this year's Com
mencement speaker is "just" the
mayor of Newark.

be someone momentous, some
one who they may never have the
chance to hear address them in
person again. Viewed through
this lens, having Cory Booker
here for the second time this aca
demic year may seem somewhat
anticlimactic.

This Board, however, believes
that the content of the Com
mencement address is far more
important than the name of the
speaker, or how many times he or
she has spoken on campus. The
members of the Class of 2012 are
closing one chapter in their lives
for many, the end of their for
mal education and beginning
another. A Commencement
speaker ought to be able to en
gage the class and speak to the
graduates' excitement and fears.
He or she should be able to draw
from his or her own struggles and
accomplishments in order to im
part a message about what is to
come.

There are perhaps two major
reasons for this feeling.The first is
that Booker is not as widely
known or well recognized as
other Commencement speakers
Stanford has had, from Steve
Jobs (2005) to Oprah Winfrey
(2008) to last year's Felipe
Calderon, president of Mexico.
But once one looks past this
name recognition, it is clear that
Mayor Booker is a strong selec
tion. He has a variety of distin
guished accomplishments —he
played football for Stanford, won
a Rhodes scholarship, attended
Yale Law School, and is now serv
ing a second term in a very chal
lenging job as mayor of Newark.
Those still doubting the import of
Mayor Booker need look no fur
ther than the 2011 "TIME 100," a
listing by the magazine of the
most influential people in the
world. Mayor Booker is in im
pressive company with a glowing
write-up by none other than Ms.
Winfrey.

The hope is that Cory Booker
will be able to do those things.
The variety of experiences in his
own life, we hope, will mean that
he can relate to more than just the
aspiring politicians of the Class of
2012. It helps, of course, that he is
known to be an engaging public
speaker with a strong sense of
humor clips of his speeches on
You Tube have singularly positive
comments. It helps, too, that
Mayor Booker was himself sit
ting at Commencement not all
that long ago, and that he can re
late to the unquestionable impact
Stanford has had on each gradu
ating senior. Lastly, his numerous
appearances at Stanford ought to
be seen as a positive sign. Clearly,
various members of this institu
tion hold Mayor Booker in high
esteem, and he seems to have
maintained a strong connection
with the Farm.

The second concern is that
Mayor Booker is not unknown to
this campus; he has spoken on a
variety of occasions, most recent
ly participating in the 2011 Re
union Homecoming Roundtable
at Stanford on redefining K-12
education in the United States.
This year's seniors had the
chance to see him lecture during
their freshman year as part of the
Haas Center's Voices in Public
Service Leadership series. This
concern is somewhat more un
derstandable. Many seniors want
their Commencement speaker to

Ultimately, a "good" or "bad"
Commencement speaker can
only really be judged as such by
the speech he or she delivers. As
of now, this Board feels the senior
class presidents have chosen well
for their class.
