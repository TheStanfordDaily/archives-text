## "Post" game analysis 
### Miriam Maks 
Even as I write this column,
my first since the poignant
close of Volume 239 in June
2011,1 am exceedingly nervous. I
had a good run at that time: I
wrote a few good columns, a few
mediocre ones and some that I
dared not take the initiative to
show anyone. When I was proud
of a column, I would take extra
steps to spread my messages
across cyberspace and, in addition
to my typical posting in The Daily,
I would post my article to my
Facebook wall. Once I had copied
and pasted the link, hit the return

key and confirmed that the link
was visible on my wall, I would sit
and wait.
Each minute was always more
agonizing than the last. Each time I
was at a moment of my greatest
vulnerability. How long before the
first "like" would surface? How
long until a comment? In an ideal
world, did I want more likes than
comments, or vice versa? Every
time I saw someone else with a post
whether of a cute kitten video or
interesting news article that had
garnered some couple dozen likes,
I panicked. Was my column no bet
ter than the latest Morgan Free
man meme? No more likeable than
a picture of a sunset that was prob
ably photoshopped?
I'll be honest. The thought of a
link on my wall, posted by me, that
was naked, bare and devoid of
likes or comments terrified me to
the core. And this insecurity is not
limited to my column, but extends
to most of what I choose to put on
Facebook pictures, posts,
check-ins, you name it. As a result
of my paranoia, I have thought
long and carefully about how to
garner more feedback. Perhaps
you have too. And while we are
not necessarily in control of oth
ers' opinions regarding our con
tent, we can at least make sure
that our friends see our posts, our
uploads, our tags. In other words,
we are in control of only one
thing: when to post.

So, when do you post? Vast
amounts of information flood
Facebook newsfeeds at every hour
of the day, and yet all you want is
to make sure that your friends see
your link. You want to post at an
hour when people are on Face
book so they can see what you're
doing. But you also want to catch
them at a time when they're busy
and hopefully not posting their
own things, because your mobile
upload of a pizza covered in garlic
cloves (but really, have you ever
seen garlic pizza?!) should not
have to compete with some pic
ture about how to make a panda
cake. You matter, and your friends
had better acknowledge that by
liking your Facebook activity.

I consulted with several others
and decided to post more strategi
cally. At first I assumed Sunday
morning would be best: very few

people are usually awake, and if I
were to wake up just ahead of the
larger student body and edge my
material onto Facebook, my post
would be the first thing that my
friends see when they log on. I
could almost imagine their thought
processes: "Oh, look, the only thing
on my newsfeed is something Miri
am just posted! LIKE."
Unfortunately, my empirical
tests showed that students will
wake up anywhere from 10 a.m. to
about 5 p.m. on Sundays, and
newsfeeds are packed by noon.
Rather than have my posts jos
tle for space with others, I turned
to Sunday evening, when students
are usually panic-stricken and
doing their homework after a
weekend of procrastination. As a
result, while they are still likely to
browse their newsfeeds, they're
less likely to post things. For my
own posts and uploads, this means
a bigger audience and less compe
tition. Success . . . for now. But
this doesn't even begin to take
into account time zones, three
day weekends and the post-col
lege lifestyle (when there is no
homework on Sunday nights).
Sometimes I wonder if my ob
session is unique, I see statuses
and posts that no one has deigned
to like, and I wonder if the poster
of such items is mildly disappoint
ed. I browse past a new profile pic
ture that remains unacknowl
edged or a mobile upload left
without comments, and I feel pity
for the poster. Then I remind my
self that I'm the exception to the
norm, and I feel just a bit better.

you've "liked" this article on the

a bigger audience and less compe

for the poster. Then I remind my

norm, and I feel just a bit better.

How long before
the first "like" would
surface?

Even as I write this column,
my first since the poignant
close of Volume 239 in June
2011,1 am exceedingly nervous. I
had a good run at that time: I
wrote a few good columns, a few
mediocre ones and some that I
dared not take the initiative to
show anyone. When I was proud
of a column, I would take extra
steps to spread my messages
across cyberspace and, in addition
to my typical posting in The Daily,
I would post my article to my
Facebook wall. Once I had copied
and pasted the link, hit the return

key and confirmed that the link
was visible on my wall, I would sit
and wait.
Each minute was always more
agonizing than the last. Each time I
was at a moment of my greatest
vulnerability. How long before the
first "like" would surface? How
long until a comment? In an ideal
world, did I want more likes than
comments, or vice versa? Every
time I saw someone else with a post
whether of a cute kitten video or
interesting news article that had
garnered some couple dozen likes,
I panicked. Was my column no bet
ter than the latest Morgan Free
man meme? No more likeable than
a picture of a sunset that was prob
ably photoshopped?
I'll be honest. The thought of a
link on my wall, posted by me, that
was naked, bare and devoid of
likes or comments terrified me to
the core. And this insecurity is not
limited to my column, but extends
to most of what I choose to put on
Facebook pictures, posts,
check-ins, you name it. As a result
of my paranoia, I have thought
long and carefully about how to
garner more feedback. Perhaps
you have too. And while we are
not necessarily in control of oth
ers' opinions regarding our con
tent, we can at least make sure
that our friends see our posts, our
uploads, our tags. In other words,
we are in control of only one
thing: when to post.

So, when do you post? Vast
amounts of information flood
Facebook newsfeeds at every hour
of the day, and yet all you want is
to make sure that your friends see
your link. You want to post at an
hour when people are on Face
book so they can see what you're
doing. But you also want to catch
them at a time when they're busy
and hopefully not posting their
own things, because your mobile
upload of a pizza covered in garlic
cloves (but really, have you ever
seen garlic pizza?!) should not
have to compete with some pic
ture about how to make a panda
cake. You matter, and your friends
had better acknowledge that by
liking your Facebook activity.

I consulted with several others
and decided to post more strategi
cally. At first I assumed Sunday
morning would be best: very few

people are usually awake, and if I
were to wake up just ahead of the
larger student body and edge my
material onto Facebook, my post
would be the first thing that my
friends see when they log on. I
could almost imagine their thought
processes: "Oh, look, the only thing
on my newsfeed is something Miri
am just posted! LIKE."
Unfortunately, my empirical
tests showed that students will
wake up anywhere from 10 a.m. to
about 5 p.m. on Sundays, and
newsfeeds are packed by noon.
Rather than have my posts jos
tle for space with others, I turned
to Sunday evening, when students
are usually panic-stricken and
doing their homework after a
weekend of procrastination. As a
result, while they are still likely to
browse their newsfeeds, they're
less likely to post things. For my
own posts and uploads, this means
a bigger audience and less compe
tition. Success . . . for now. But
this doesn't even begin to take
into account time zones, three
day weekends and the post-col
lege lifestyle (when there is no
