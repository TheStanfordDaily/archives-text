## LOS ANGELES BLUES CARDINAL DROPS 13TH STRAIGHT GAME IN L.A. 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
On a Thursday night in Los Angeles, it only
seemed fitting that the Stanford men's basket
ball team decided to wear its black uniforms
against UCLA, as the Cardinal likely saw its
chances at a Pac-12 title vanish thanks to a 72-
61 defeat at the hands of the Bruins.
The Bruins (14-10,7-5 Pac-12) got out to a
massive lead early and then held on for dear
life, blowing open a 25-9 lead in the first 11
minutes of the game and then fending off
every Cardinal parry for the rest of the game.

While the Cardinal (16-8,6-6) did respond
with a good rally to put itself back into the
game by cutting the deficit to 56-53 with just
4:45 left in the game, it was never able to grab
a lead and fully swing the momentum back its
way.
Senior guard Lazeric Jones led the way for
UCLA with 21 points, while Travis Wear
added 13 and Jerime Anderson contributed
12. Altogether, the Bruins improved to 11-3 at
home and notched their fourth victory in their
last five games.
Freshman guard Chasson Randle was the
brightest star on a dark night for the Cardinal,

tallying 16 points. As a whole, Stanford com
mitted 22 costly turnovers that led to 28 points
for UCLA.
The Bruins turned in the eleven-point mar
gin of victory due to some late fouling by the
Cardinal, and with the loss, Stanford has now
lost two games in a row and five of its last six
after it was tied for first back in mid-January.
From here on out, the Cardinal's chances at
a regular season Pac-12 title are likely dashed,
and its only chance at making the NCAA tour-

Freshman guard Chasson Randle (above) was the only Cardinal scorer in double figures, with 16 points on the night, but Stanford committed
22 turnovers and fell short against UCLA, 72-61. Stanford has fallen to .500 in Pac- 12 play after leading the conference in mid-January.
