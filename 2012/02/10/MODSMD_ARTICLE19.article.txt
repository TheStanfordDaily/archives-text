# SOFTBALL READY TO MAKE A RUN
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If you listen to the pundits, the key to
success at the collegiate level in almost
all team sports is experience. Michi
gan's Fab Five notwithstanding, it is the
holy grail of veteran leadership that
turns talent and expectations into titles
and crowns.

Therefore, when the Stanford soft
ball team kicks off its season today at
the Kajikawa Classic with just seven
upperclassmen on the roster and
eight true freshman suiting up for
coach John Rittman the Cardinal's
No. 10 preseason ranking might seem a
bit high.
But when your upperclassmen in
clude the reigning USA Softball Colle
giate Player of the Year, a potential
pitcher of the year and two other all
conference honorees in the toughest
league in the country, things might not
be so bad.

Despite being picked to finish fifth
in the Pac-12 in the annual preseason
coaches poll a detail that speaks
more about the unbelievable collection
of talent in the conference this year
with No. 1 Arizona State, No. 3 Califor
nia and No. 8. Arizona all ranked ahead
of the Cardinal in the national polls
Stanford is a popular darkhorse nation
al title contender, thanks to that small
but talented group of veterans and
some highly touted newcomers.
Senior shortstop Ashley Hansen
has to be at the forefront of any conver
sation concerning the Cardinal's
chances. Hansen had one of the great
est single seasons in Stanford history
last season, finishing third in the coun
try with an otherworldly .495 batting
average on top of 25 doubles, nine
home runs and 45 RBI.

Plenty of people took notice, as
Hansen was named Pac-10 Player of
the Year and earned her second All-
American honors in addition to the
USA Softball Player of the Year award.

She will need the same kind of pro
tection that the rest of Stanford's lineup
afforded last season if the Cardinal is to
challenge for the Pac-12 crown.

Fellow senior Sarah Hassmann had
a breakout year as well, setting a single
season record with 35 steals, and also
finding her way at the plate with a .398
batting average, which was .123 points
higher than her previous career high.

Junior second baseman Jenna Rich
also built on a solid freshman campaign
with a standout sophomore season in
which she led the team in with 10 home
runs and 49 RBI.

The rest of Stanford's lineup doesn't
lack for talent or pop, however. Senior
outfielder and catcher Maya Burns has
started 159 games in three seasons, and
senior Jenna Becerra is the likely candi
date to start at first base after primarily
playing at the hot corner last season.
In addition, Rittman is looking to a
fresh wave of new talent to make an im
pact. Sophomores Corey Hanewich,
Danielle Miller and Michelle Prong all
saw frequent action last season with
Hanewich and Miller earning All-Pac
-10 Freshman Team honors and
classmate Caitlyn Pura came on strong
towards the end of the year to earn
playing time in the outfield.
Among the rookies, freshman
Hanna Winter is expected to get some
looks at third base, but she will likely
face competition from redshirt sopho
more Tegan Schmidt, who missed the
past two seasons with knee injuries.
Winter has plenty of range and
speed she was a track star in high
school in Thousand Oaks, Calif. an
asset that abounds across the incoming
class of freshmen. That includes Leah
White and Cassandra Roulund, who
could both see action in the outfield.

But one of the most impactful re
cruits who will make her Stanford
debut this weekend is pitcher Nyree
White. A Marist High School star from

Senior shortstop Ashley Hansen (above), who was the USA
Softball National Player of the Year in 2011 with a .495
batting average, leads the Cardinal into the 2012 season in
the Kajikawa Classic in Tempe, Ariz., this weekend.
