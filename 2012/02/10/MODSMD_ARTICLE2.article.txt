# Zimbra to be axed, replaced by Gmail
## Full transition pending business agreement 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
Stanford signed a contract with Google
last month to have Google Apps including
Gmail replace the communication servic
es Zimbra offers to the campus.

The move came after an 18-month evalua
tion period, during which time Stanford, as
part of an informal consortium of 10 research
universities, scanned the marketplace for
comprehensive collaboration solutions for
combining email, calendar, instant messaging,
document sharing and more, according to Ex
ecutive Director of Information Technology
Services (ITS) Matthew Ricks in an email to
The Daily.

"This consortium issued a Request For
Proposal (RFP) to multiple vendors, evaluat
ed responses and entered into contract nego
tiations with selected vendors," Ricks wrote.
The transition will begin during spring
quarter, allowing undergraduate students to
self-select the timing for the switch to Gmail.
Google Docs will be enabled for the entire
campus in the summer including faculty,
staff and graduate students. A full transition

cannot happen until Google enters a Business
Associate Agreement (BAA) with the Uni
versity.

"In delivering Google Apps to Stanford,
we're responding to the desires of the majori
ty of our community," Ricks said. "Both Stan
ford's Law School and Graduate School of
Business have migrated to Google Apps suc
cessfully, as well as members of the Stanford
Alumni Association."

According to Ricks, the transition is neces
sary due to consistent feedback from the stu
dent body preferring Gmail to Zimbra. Ricks
said that 95 percent of students who currently
send their email outside Stanford forward
their messages to Gmail.

Ricks also said that while Zimbra has been
a viable platform for email and calendar for
the past three years since implementation,
cloud-based solutions such as Google Apps
provide unique advantages and familiarity.
"Cloud-based solutions offer greater scal
ability, higher availability, greater storage
quota, continual feature enhancements and
greater business continuity capabilities,"
Ricks said.

ties tor a transition to Google Apps because it
was something that he said strongly aligned
with his own sense of what students should
have.

Macgregor-Dennis also said that the num
ber of students already forwarding email to
personal Gmail accounts demonstrated a
need for such a transition.

"If the two email services were pretty
much equivalent, you would expect very few
students to transition, but the proportion of
the Stanford student body that has transi
tioned to Google Apps means that most stu
dents see it as a superior service," he said.

dents who currently forwards his Zimbra
emails to a Gmail account. He said he agrees
