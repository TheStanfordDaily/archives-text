# Zimbra to be axed, replaced by Gmail
## Full transition pending business agreement 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
Stanford signed a contract with Google
last month to have Google Apps including
Gmail replace the communication servic
es Zimbra offers to the campus.

The move came after an 18-month evalua
tion period, during which time Stanford, as
part of an informal consortium of 10 research
universities, scanned the marketplace for
comprehensive collaboration solutions for
combining email, calendar, instant messaging,
document sharing and more, according to Ex
ecutive Director of Information Technology
Services (ITS) Matthew Ricks in an email to
The Daily.

"This consortium issued a Request For
Proposal (RFP) to multiple vendors, evaluat
ed responses and entered into contract nego
tiations with selected vendors," Ricks wrote.
The transition will begin during spring
quarter, allowing undergraduate students to
self-select the timing for the switch to Gmail.
Google Docs will be enabled for the entire
campus in the summer including faculty,
staff and graduate students. A full transition

cannot happen until Google enters a Business
Associate Agreement (BAA) with the Uni
versity.

"In delivering Google Apps to Stanford,
we're responding to the desires of the majori
ty of our community," Ricks said. "Both Stan
ford's Law School and Graduate School of
Business have migrated to Google Apps suc
cessfully, as well as members of the Stanford
Alumni Association."

According to Ricks, the transition is neces
sary due to consistent feedback from the stu
dent body preferring Gmail to Zimbra. Ricks
said that 95 percent of students who currently
send their email outside Stanford forward
their messages to Gmail.

Ricks also said that while Zimbra has been
a viable platform for email and calendar for
the past three years since implementation,
cloud-based solutions such as Google Apps
provide unique advantages and familiarity.
"Cloud-based solutions offer greater scal
ability, higher availability, greater storage
quota, continual feature enhancements and
greater business continuity capabilities,"
Ricks said.

ties tor a transition to Google Apps because it
was something that he said strongly aligned
with his own sense of what students should
have.

Macgregor-Dennis also said that the num
ber of students already forwarding email to
personal Gmail accounts demonstrated a
need for such a transition.

"If the two email services were pretty
much equivalent, you would expect very few
students to transition, but the proportion of
the Stanford student body that has transi
tioned to Google Apps means that most stu
dents see it as a superior service," he said.

dents who currently forwards his Zimbra
emails to a Gmail account. He said he agrees

that Google has several advan
tages over Zimbra.
"I do really like Google prod
ucts in general because the for
matting of Gmail is pretty intu
itive, and I can find anything real
ly smoothly," O'Neal said. "I
found the old Zimbra program to
be almost blocky and not as easy
to navigate and I'd always had
Gmail, so I knew it better."
According to Macgregor-Den
nis, Stanford is also moving for
ward with the transition because
of financial savings to the Univer
sity due to ending investments
with Zimbra.

According to ITS Computing
Support Specialist Christopher
Boshers at Vanderbilt University,
Vanderbilt made the full transi
tion to Google Apps for Educa
tion in mid-2010 due in part to the
superior service Google offered,
but also due to expenses.

"We transitioned because the
cost of storing emails is a great
cost to us and because it's really
effective for all student emails to
be stored on Google servers
rather than ours," Boshers said.
According to a case study re
leased by Google Apps for Edu
cation, Vanderbilt saved approxi
mately $750,000 due to the transi
tion. Boshers confirmed that the
student responses were overall
positive.

While Ricks said that, "[Stan

ford's] switch is more of a pro
grammatic effort than a cost in
tensive effort," Macgregor-Den
nis said there will be a lower cost
for maintaining an email server
after the transition.

According to Boshers, Vander
bilt had no issue with privacy con
cerns during the transition.
"Google has sound security
standards, but the lack of a BAA
prevents a large portion of the
University from adopting Gmail
at this time," Ricks said.
"For all Stanford Google Apps
core services, privacy of Stan
ford's data is contractually as
sured," he added. "The opera
tional access to Stanford at
Google Apps is subject to the
same policies, and Stanford em
ployees are still the service admin
istrators."

Macgregor-Dennis said that,
moving forward, there will still be
some issues to work out with han
dling the transition.
"I think the main issue is, how
do we communicate this to the
student body, and how do we tran
sition students in away that's min
imally disruptive and maximally
beneficial to their experience,"
Macgregor-Dennis said.
Overall, Ricks said that Zim
bra was still an accomplishment
for ITS and that Google Apps is a
move forward.

"Stanford IT Services is very
proud of the email and calendar
ing services we provide to our user
community," he said.
