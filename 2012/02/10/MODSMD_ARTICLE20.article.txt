# AT&T worth the early wake-up call
## 
### Joey Beyda 
College students just
aren't supposed to get up
before 6 a.m. Not on a
Saturday. Not to watch
golf.

But of course, I'm going to be
doing all of that tomorrow, when my
dad and I take our annual trip to
Monterey for the AT&T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am.

Why, you ask? It's not the breath
taking views, though those are al
ways a huge plus. And it's not just to
watch world-class professional
golfers, with everyone from Vijay
Singh and Phil Mickelson (who hit
me in the knee a few years back with
an errant sixth-hole drive) to Zach
Johnson and Tiger Woods (who is fi
nally returning to Pebble after a 10-
year hiatus).
No, the biggest attractions at the
event are by far the celebrities. If
you're not familiar with the pro-am
format, each foursome contains two
professional golfers who compete in
dividually to win the tournament but
are also paired with an amateur, who
could be a famous athlete, musician,
CEO, actor or otherwise successful
human being. The pro-am team also
competes for a separate title, taking
the best score between the two part
ners as the team score for that hole.

In other words, you don't have to
be a golf fan to have fun at Pebble.
Do you like college football?
Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops tees
off at 8 a.m., with Alabama's Nick
Saban about an hour behind.

Are you more of an NFL fan?
Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo
(paired with Tiger this year) will pull
out a driver on hole 10 at 8:22, while
Packers quarterback Aaron
Rodgers simultaneously reaches for
that long iron on the first tee. Super
Bowl-losing coach Bill Belichick of
the Patriots follows at 9:06 (together
with BCS Championship-winning
coach Saban), and ESPN analyst and
former coach/cornerback Herm Ed
wards is set for 10:01.

Could you be a fellow Bay Area
sports nut, by any chance? Giants
pitcher Matt Cain and our old friend
Jim Harbaugh headline the 9:39
foursome.

And if you aren't impressed by
sports at all (yet still happen to be
reading this column), the tourna
ment always hosts its fair share of ac
tors: Josh Duhamel, Ray Romano,
Andy Garcia and George Lopez in
less than an hour. Wow.

But by far the best memories
come from Bill Murray, the guy from
Caddyshack, Groundhog Day and
Ghostbusters. He indisputably does
the best on-course stand-up comedy,
and he's known for snagging the
crowd some snacks from the player's
tent (I scored a banana once as a kid).
He's become the tournament's
headliner year in and year out and
he's a pretty darn good golfer, too.
Last year, my dad and I were sit
ting at the fifth-hole grandstands for
the third round. A tricky par-3 guard
ed by bunkers and the coastline, hole
five was playing even trickier than
normal thanks to Pebble's pre
dictably unpredictable wind. We
watched dozens of players pros
and amateurs alike miss in every
way imaginable: long, short, left,
right, bunker, trees, rough, ocean.
Anything on the green was a good
shot, and anything within 20 feet of
the hole was far above average.
Murray was the last player in his
foursome to hit his tee shot. Wearing
an Elmer Fudd hat (he and partner
D.A. Points were "in the hunt," after
all), Murray walked into the tee box,
took two practice swings baseball
style and nailed a shot to within a foot
or two of the pin. It was 11 a.m., and
there were at most a hundred of us
sitting in the grandstand, but we were
all yelling like Andrew Luck had just
thrown a game-winning touchdown.
Of course, Murray took a few sec
onds to get down and line up his putt
once he got to the green. And along
side Points, Murray won the 2011
tournament for the first time in his 20
years entering the event.
Murray adds a sorely needed de
gree of levity to a sport that most
non-players see as too drawn-out,
too uneventful and too pretentious.
Some members of the golf establish
ment don't appreciate his rabble
rousing ways, but, at the end of the
day, it's the fans writing the golfers'
paychecks, and the AT&T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am is giving ca
sual golf fans what they want.
Maybe some of the other sports
that the American market sees as
"boring" tennis, soccer and in
creasingly even baseball —can take
a hint from Bill Murray. If you want
your sport to be entertaining your
athletes have to know what they're
doing. But sometimes, they Ve got to
bring an Elmer Fudd hat to the party
as well.

are also paired with an amateur, who
could be a famous athlete, musician,
CEO, actor or otherwise successful
human being. The pro-am team also
competes for a separate title, taking
the best score between the two part
ners as the team score for that hole.

In other words, you don't have to
be a golf fan to have fun at Pebble.
Do you like college football?
Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops tees
off at 8 a.m., with Alabama's Nick
Saban about an hour behind.

Are you more of an NFL fan?
Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo
(paired with Tiger this year) will pull
out a driver on hole 10 at 8:22, while
Packers quarterback Aaron
Rodgers simultaneously reaches for
that long iron on the first tee. Super
Bowl-losing coach Bill Belichick of
the Patriots follows at 9:06 (together
with BCS Championship-winning
coach Saban), and ESPN analyst and
former coach/cornerback Herm Ed
wards is set for 10:01.

Could you be a fellow Bay Area
sports nut, by any chance? Giants
pitcher Matt Cain and our old friend
Jim Harbaugh headline the 9:39
foursome.

And if you aren't impressed by
sports at all (yet still happen to be
reading this column), the tourna
ment always hosts its fair share of ac
tors: Josh Duhamel, Ray Romano,
Andy Garcia and George Lopez in
less than an hour. Wow.

But by far the best memories
come from Bill Murray, the guy from
Caddyshack, Groundhog Day and
Ghostbusters. He indisputably does
the best on-course stand-up comedy,
and he's known for snagging the
crowd some snacks from the player's
tent (I scored a banana once as a kid).
He's become the tournament's
headliner year in and year out and
he's a pretty darn good golfer, too.
Last year, my dad and I were sit
ting at the fifth-hole grandstands for
the third round. A tricky par-3 guard
ed by bunkers and the coastline, hole
five was playing even trickier than
normal thanks to Pebble's pre
dictably unpredictable wind. We
watched dozens of players pros
and amateurs alike miss in every
way imaginable: long, short, left,
right, bunker, trees, rough, ocean.
Anything on the green was a good
shot, and anything within 20 feet of
the hole was far above average.
Murray was the last player in his
foursome to hit his tee shot. Wearing
an Elmer Fudd hat (he and partner
D.A. Points were "in the hunt," after
all), Murray walked into the tee box,
took two practice swings baseball
style and nailed a shot to within a foot
or two of the pin. It was 11 a.m., and
there were at most a hundred of us
sitting in the grandstand, but we were
all yelling like Andrew Luck had just
thrown a game-winning touchdown.
Of course, Murray took a few sec
onds to get down and line up his putt
once he got to the green. And along
side Points, Murray won the 2011
tournament for the first time in his 20
years entering the event.
Murray adds a sorely needed de
gree of levity to a sport that most
non-players see as too drawn-out,
too uneventful and too pretentious.
Some members of the golf establish
ment don't appreciate his rabble
rousing ways, but, at the end of the
day, it's the fans writing the golfers'
paychecks, and the AT&T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am is giving ca
sual golf fans what they want.
Maybe some of the other sports
that the American market sees as
"boring" tennis, soccer and in
creasingly even baseball —can take
a hint from Bill Murray. If you want
your sport to be entertaining your
athletes have to know what they're
doing. But sometimes, they Ve got to
bring an Elmer Fudd hat to the party
as well.

College students just
aren't supposed to get up
before 6 a.m. Not on a
Saturday. Not to watch
golf.

But of course, I'm going to be
doing all of that tomorrow, when my
dad and I take our annual trip to
Monterey for the AT&T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am.

Why, you ask? It's not the breath
taking views, though those are al
ways a huge plus. And it's not just to
watch world-class professional
golfers, with everyone from Vijay
Singh and Phil Mickelson (who hit
me in the knee a few years back with
an errant sixth-hole drive) to Zach
Johnson and Tiger Woods (who is fi
nally returning to Pebble after a 10-
year hiatus).
No, the biggest attractions at the
event are by far the celebrities. If
you're not familiar with the pro-am
format, each foursome contains two
professional golfers who compete in
dividually to win the tournament but
are also paired with an amateur, who
could be a famous athlete, musician,
CEO, actor or otherwise successful
human being. The pro-am team also
competes for a separate title, taking
the best score between the two part
ners as the team score for that hole.
