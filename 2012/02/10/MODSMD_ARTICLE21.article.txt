# OGWUMIKES SMASH USC
## 
### DEAN MCARDLE TOM TAYLOR 
Both Stanford and USC fea
tured a pair of sisters in their start
ing lineup.The sister duos hail from
neighboring suburbs of Houston.
But that was where the similarities
stopped on Thursday as the Ogwu
mike sisters dominated the sibling
battle against USC's Gilbreath sis
ters to lead Stanford to a 69-52 vic
tory at Maples Pavilion.
Nnemkadi, the older Ogwu
mike, rewrote the history books in
the process, passing Jayne Appel
for third on the all-time scoring
list. She teamed up with younger
sister Chiney to overpower USC
on the block.

The Cardinal outscored the
Women of Troy 34-14 in the paint,
as Nneka paced Stanford's scoring
attack with 22 points. The older Og
wumike was joined in double fig
ures by Chiney, who had 21, as well
as sophomore guard Toni Kokenis,
who added 15. Chiney also set a ca
reer-high for blocked shots with six
and talked her sixth-straight dou
ble-double, pulling down 12 re
bounds.

Sophomore Briana Gilbreath
and senior Ashley Corral led the
Women of Troy with 11 points
apiece. Stanford (21-1,12-0 Pac-12)
remained undefeated in the Pac-12
and firmly in control of first-place in
the conference. USC (12-11, 6-6)
came into the game tied for fourth
in the Pac-12, and the loss dropped
them to .500 in conference play.
With a 12-2 run midway
through the first half, Stanford
pulled firmly ahead in a contest
that had looked close for the first
few minutes. Back in December at
the Galen Center in Los Angeles,
Stanford squandered the same 12-
point advantage and led USC by
just three points at the half, inspir
ing the Trojans to push hard at the
start of the second. But this time
around, the Cardinal did not
make the same mistake, holding
its 33-22 halftime lead.
Corral, USC's all-time leading

three-point shooter and the Pac
12's leader this season, had 14 of
her 21 points in the first half of the
December matchup between the
two schools, but was held to just
four in the first 20 minutes last
night. By the time the final buzzer
sounded, Corral had managed just
11 points.
In contrast, Stanford's own star
senior, forward Nneka Ogwu
mike, hit a jumper and drew a foul
with 13:35 left in the first half to
first tie and then pass her old Stan
ford teammate forward Jayne
Appel on the all-time points list.
Her 22 points pushed her total to
2,143. Next on the list is guard
Kate Starbird, in second place,
with 2,215 points.

USC came out of the locker
room firing in the second half.
Corral tickled the twine with a
deep three-pointer to cut the
Stanford lead to six just over a
minute into the half, but the Car
dinal responded quickly with
back-to-back inside buckets by
the Ogwumikes.
Minutes later, Chiney grabbed
a defensive rebound and dished
the ball to Kokenis, who launched
a pass to a streaking Nneka for a
fast-break layup. The basket
stretched the Stanford advantage
to 14 points.
Free throws were key down the
stretch for the Cardinal. The team
hit five of six over the final three
minutes to ice the game. Just as
crucial was the stifling Cardinal
defense that limited USC to 29
percent shooting on the night.
"I thought it was our defense,"
said Stanford head coach Tara
Vanderveer. "We really worked
hard defensively, and we got out
running. We got some nice breaks
that opened things up a little bit."

The win was Stanford's 75th in
a row at home dating back to 2007,
and the Cardinal has not lost a
regular-season game at Maples
since 2004.

The Cardinal next grapples
with the Bruins of UCLA Sunday
at noon in the friendly confines of
Maples Pavilion. UCLA is coming
off a 58-67 loss at Cal on Thursday.
