# MEN'S TENNIS
## Card welcomes Cougars to Farm 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
After grabbing a big rebound win against
Flawaii on Tuesday, the Stanford men's tennis
team looks to continue its win streak this Fri
day against BYU.

The No. 9 Cardinal (5-1) dropped its two
biggest matches of the season last weekend
to USC and UCLA and heads to the ITA In
door National Championships in Char
lottesville, Va., next week, so regaining the
momentum lost to the L.A. schools will be
the major goal of this weekend.

Stanford does have a 19-2 all-time record
against BYU, but if the Cardinal wants to

overcome the Cougars (3-4) this weekend, it
will have to overcome three ranked players
at the top of the lineup who are all off to hot
starts in the spring season.

Senior Georgy Batrakov, who plays at the
number one spot, is the nation's 43rd-ranked
player thanks to his 12-6 record this season.
Batrakov's doubles partner, sophomore
Patrick Kawka, is the 106th-best player in the
country, and the two have combined to notch
an 11-6 doubles record this year.
Rounding out the three ranked BYU
players is freshman Keaton Cullimore, who
has risen to No. 67 in the country thanks to a
14-7 start to his year.

Aside from the three ranked players, sen

ior Spencer Smith, the Cougars' number-two
player, holds the best singles record on the
team with an 18-6 record this season.

Getting a big win over a ranked player will
certainly be important for Stanford's No. 1
player, Ryan Thacher, who fell to two ranked
players in tough third sets last weekend and
sat out Tuesday's singles matches against
Hawaii to rest up for the long road ahead.
An added subplot to the weekend's
matches is the health issues of ace player
Bradley Klahn, whose back injury has kept
him off the courts so far this season. Klahn,
the 2010 NCAA singles champion, said his
health has been steadily improv
ing, but isn't completely sure
when he'll return to the courts.
"Obviously, it's a hard injury
to diagnose when I can play ex
actly," Klahn said. "The biggest
thing is just trying to minimize
my pain level on the court and
then also speed up my recovery
time once I'm done, so that I'm

able to not feel any effects after
practice or a match â€”to the
point where I can train and prac
tice at my full capabilities and
then be able to do it the next day.
"I feel like I'm improving in
that respect, and I'm hoping it's
one of those things where dou
bles may come first. I can build
myself back that way, start by
playing doubles and then sin
gles," he continued.

The return of Klahn would be
a big boost to an already solid
Cardinal squad that could use its
best player to help it down the

stretch, but Klahn said he wants
to make sure he's at full strength
before he gets back in the lineup.
"Obviously the goal is to be
ready as soon as possible I'd
like to be ready for Indoors if
possible," he said. "But its one of
those things where you never
know where setbacks may
occur."
Stanford and BYU hit the
courts today at 1:30 p.m at the
Taube Family Tennis Center.
