## Card welcomes Cougars to Farm 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
After grabbing a big rebound win against
Flawaii on Tuesday, the Stanford men's tennis
team looks to continue its win streak this Fri
day against BYU.

The No. 9 Cardinal (5-1) dropped its two
biggest matches of the season last weekend
to USC and UCLA and heads to the ITA In

lottesville, Va., next week, so regaining the
momentum lost to the L.A. schools will be
the major goal of this weekend.

Stanford does have a 19-2 all-time record
against BYU, but if the Cardinal wants to

at the top of the lineup who are all off to hot
starts in the spring season.

Senior Georgy Batrakov, who plays at the
number one spot, is the nation's 43rd-ranked
player thanks to his 12-6 record this season.
Batrakov's doubles partner, sophomore
Patrick Kawka, is the 106th-best player in the
country, and the two have combined to notch
an 11-6 doubles record this year.
Rounding out the three ranked BYU
players is freshman Keaton Cullimore, who
has risen to No. 67 in the country thanks to a
14-7 start to his year.

Aside from the three ranked players, sen

ior Spencer Smith, the Cougars' number-two
player, holds the best singles record on the
team with an 18-6 record this season.

Getting a big win over a ranked player will
certainly be important for Stanford's No. 1
player, Ryan Thacher, who fell to two ranked
players in tough third sets last weekend and
sat out Tuesday's singles matches against
Hawaii to rest up for the long road ahead.
An added subplot to the weekend's
matches is the health issues of ace player
Bradley Klahn, whose back injury has kept
him off the courts so far this season. Klahn,
the 2010 NCAA singles champion, said his
