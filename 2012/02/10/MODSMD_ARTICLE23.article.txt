# REDEMPTION ON THE LINE
## 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
It's been almost 8 and a half
months since the then-ranked
No. 1 Stanford women's tennis
team lost in the NCAA Champi
onship to the then-ranked No. 2
Florida Gators. That loss
snapped both the Cardinal's
hopes for a second straight na
tional title and its NCAA-record
streak of 184 consecutive home
wins, which spanned 12 seasons.
This Sunday, with the tables
turned, No. 2 Stanford (2-0, 1-0
Pac-12) gets a chance at revenge
against top-ranked Florida (4-0).
Last year's championship
came down to Stanford junior co
captain Mallory Burdette's nail
biting three-setter against Lau
ren Embree. Tennis aficionados
will be in for a treat, as Burdette
will most likely face her familiar
foe once again.
"I've played [Embree] count
less times throughout our ca
reers, so I know exactly what to
expect from her," Burdette
pointed out. "I'm really excited
for the matchup, and I think it
will come down to how well I ex
ecute my aggressive game plan."
Though the taste of defeat is
still bitter in their mouths, Bur
dette and the rest of the squad
have worked assiduously on im

proving and returning this season
with a positive attitude.
"It was obviously a heart
breaker for us because we had
been through so much as a team
leading up to NCAAs and we still
came so close winning another
championship," Burdette said.
"But the opportunity to square
off against the top team in the na
tion has been the light at the end
of the tunnel for me. It's still very
early in the season, so whether
we win or lose, there will be a lot
to learn."

One challenge the team faced
leading up to last year's final
match was the loss of key player
and current sophomore Kristie
Ahn, who suffered an ankle in
jury and has yet to play in a dual
match since facing Cal last April.
"Naturally I was bummed that
I wasn't able to play in front of
the home crowd in the finals, but
I was just as happy to root on my
teammates," Ahn said of last
year's match. "It was absolutely
nerve-wracking, watching from
the sidelines, and I think I finally
understood what it's like to be a
'tennis parent.' Although we did
n't come out with the win, I
couldn't be more proud of my
team and the way we competed."

Senior Veronica Li (above) and the Stanford women's team will look to
avenge its loss to the Florida Gators in last year's national championship
on Sunday. This time around, the Cardinal will try to upset the Gators,
who are ranked as the number-one team in the nation.
and return for this season, aided
by the guidance of her coaches,
her teammates and her trainers.

"The process was a bit tedious
at times, inching my way forward,
but I knew that in the long run it
would pay off," she explained. "I
actually had to be fed balls for a
while, and it felt like I was learn
ing to play tennis again, but on
crack. There was a lot of commu
nication among many parties
who constantly reassessed my
situation so as not to lose track of
my progress."

While Coach Lele Forood and
the players alike are excited
about Ahn's return, they realize
that outstanding play from every
member will be required to
avenge their loss.
"[Florida] is definitely the
team to beat," Forood said, "but
we want to see where we are at in
only the second week of Febru

ary, in the fourth match of our
regular season."
Though the other match of
the weekend is less highlighted,
Stanford first must pass a test on
Saturday when they face No. 27
Pepperdine just one day before
the Cardinal takes on the Gators.
This will serve as another chance
for the group's still-shaping dy
namic to become even stronger.
"We're a small team this year
with just eight girls, but it's al
ways different year to year" she
said. "This team feels more like a
circle and less like a pyramid."
With the graduation of three
seniors last year and the addition
of sole freshman Ellen Tsay, she
explained there's naturally less
of a hierarchy.
"We've got really experienced
players despite being a young
team, and they know how to get
up for big matches," Forood said.
"Everyone knows how to pre
pare themselves. I do think it
starts with the doubles though,
and we have new doubles teams
from last year, which we are still
trying to gel. It's important in the

early season to see how our
teams are playing together and
to hope that we've got the right
teams."

One formidable pair to watch
this weekend consists of sopho
more Nicole Gibbs and Bur
dette. In their first two matches
on court one, they've won both
with ease, 8-1.
"We're feeling great in dou
bles," Burdette said. "Just like in
singles, we're still working on
several things and just trying to
improve with every match."
Both matches take place at
noon on the Taube Family Tennis
Courts Pepperdine on Satur
day and Florida on Sunday.
