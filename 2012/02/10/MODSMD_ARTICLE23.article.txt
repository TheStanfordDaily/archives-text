# REDEMPTION ON THE LINE
## 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
It's been almost 8 and a half
months since the then-ranked
No. 1 Stanford women's tennis
team lost in the NCAA Champi
onship to the then-ranked No. 2
Florida Gators. That loss
snapped both the Cardinal's
hopes for a second straight na
tional title and its NCAA-record
streak of 184 consecutive home
wins, which spanned 12 seasons.
This Sunday, with the tables
turned, No. 2 Stanford (2-0, 1-0
Pac-12) gets a chance at revenge
against top-ranked Florida (4-0).
Last year's championship
came down to Stanford junior co
captain Mallory Burdette's nail
biting three-setter against Lau
ren Embree. Tennis aficionados
will be in for a treat, as Burdette
will most likely face her familiar
foe once again.
"I've played [Embree] count
less times throughout our ca
reers, so I know exactly what to
expect from her," Burdette
pointed out. "I'm really excited
for the matchup, and I think it
will come down to how well I ex
ecute my aggressive game plan."
Though the taste of defeat is
still bitter in their mouths, Bur
dette and the rest of the squad
have worked assiduously on im

proving and returning this season
with a positive attitude.
"It was obviously a heart
breaker for us because we had
been through so much as a team
leading up to NCAAs and we still
came so close winning another
championship," Burdette said.
"But the opportunity to square
off against the top team in the na
tion has been the light at the end
of the tunnel for me. It's still very
early in the season, so whether
we win or lose, there will be a lot
to learn."

One challenge the team faced
leading up to last year's final
match was the loss of key player
and current sophomore Kristie
Ahn, who suffered an ankle in
jury and has yet to play in a dual
match since facing Cal last April.
"Naturally I was bummed that
I wasn't able to play in front of
the home crowd in the finals, but
I was just as happy to root on my
teammates," Ahn said of last
year's match. "It was absolutely
nerve-wracking, watching from
the sidelines, and I think I finally
understood what it's like to be a
'tennis parent.' Although we did
n't come out with the win, I
couldn't be more proud of my
team and the way we competed."

Senior Veronica Li (above) and the Stanford women's team will look to
avenge its loss to the Florida Gators in last year's national championship
on Sunday. This time around, the Cardinal will try to upset the Gators,
who are ranked as the number-one team in the nation.
