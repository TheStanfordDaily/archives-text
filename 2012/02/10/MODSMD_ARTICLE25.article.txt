## TOP 5 ROM-COMS OF THE PAST DECADE 
### 
It's Valentine's Day, and that means
either it's time to receive hundreds of
dollars worth of gifts that will wilt or go
bad in a week, or that now's your chance
to spend some quality time staring at
your computer screen watching bad
movies. If option two sounds more like
your life, here are five flicks that aren't
as pitiful to watch on Valentine's Day as
"Titanic."

"Away We Go"
"Away We Go" picks up where most
romantic comedies end: with a couple
very much in love, committed and preg
nant. The couple is Burt (John Krasinski)
and Verona (Maya Rudolph), who
embark on a road trip across the coun
try. They meet up with friends all over,
each with their own hilarious parenting
philosophies, such as Maggie
Gyllenhaal's character's distaste for
strollers: "Why would I want to push my
baby away from me?"

"Dan In Real Life"
In "Dan in Real Life," Steve Carell plays
Dan, a widower and parent of three lov
able daughters, who unwittingly finds
love in a chance encounter with a beau
tiful and sophisticated woman in a book
store, Marie (Juliette Binoche).
Unfortunately, she's his brother's girl
friend. And they're all on a weekend
family retreat together. He handles the

situation like a grown-up, but of course
over the weekend, they fall in love. His
daughters are adorable: The eldest is a
newly-licensed driver preparing to leave
for college, the middle one has a knack
for falling in love and tying cherry stems
in a knot in her mouth and the youngest
is just about the sweetest kid you could
hope for without being naive. Ultimately,
the movie revolves around family, and
while a touching romance ensues, Dan
doesn't have to prove that he's Prince
Charming; he's a single dad who loves
his brother and his kids, and that's per
fect enough for Marie.

"Friends with Benefits"
"Friends with Benefits" shares its prem
ise with "No Strings Attached" —two
friends decide to have emotionless sex
but ultimately fall in love in the process
but it's smart, funny and sweet. It's
about two clever, career-oriented people
so emotionally damaged by their fami
lies that they can't handle the mess of a
relationship. And it updates the rom
com fairytale; what these characters
want is an equal, a best friend and a
partner. It's a film very conscious of its
genre there's even a fake romantic
comedy film within a film that the char
acters poke fun at but it transcends
and reinvents it. Yes, there are many
frank (though well-concealed) sex
scenes, and the outcome is horribly pre
dictable, but the cleverness and strength
of characters make this film everything a
modern romantic comedy should be.

"Definitely, Maybe"

In "Definitely, Maybe," recently divorced
Will Haynes (Ryan Reynolds) decides to
tell his incredibly cute daughter Maya
(Abigail Breslin) the story of how he met
her mother, but he tells it as a mystery.
He changes all the names and tells the
story of the three most important
women (Isla Fisher, Elizabeth Banks and
Rachel Weisz) who graced his life, and
it's up to Maya to decipher which one is
her mother. We understand why each
pair would have fallen for each other,
even though the relationships all ulti
mately ended. There are some very
funny moments, like when Will acciden
tally slips in a detail about having

smoked in the '9os or when he shows
up on Weisz's doorstep, only to be
greeted by her drunken boyfriend (Kevin
Kline), who Will assumes is her father
and gives him lessons in what it means
to be a real man apparently, it
involves a lot of scotch. When Will finally
does figure out which woman he should
be with, when the many layers of all of
the characters have been peeled off and
revealed, it's a corny but realistic happy
ending.

"Easy A"
"Easy A" is a high school romantic com
edy in the tradition of John Hughes
films, with the biting wit and religious
satire of "Saved" and the quips of
"Juno." It's the film that launched Emma
Stone into stardom as Olive
Penderghast, the wise-cracking, confi
dent and lovable outsider who acciden
tally finds herself in the middle of a
rumor that she slept with someone
who is, in fact, imaginary on a first
date. As they are reading "The Scarlet
Letter" in class, she decides to embroi
der an "A" on her own clothing in a
show of irony that's lost on her class
mates. The premise is dubious but the
execution flawless. It's ultimately about a
strong young woman who's too smart
for her classmates, and whose very lik
able parents (Patricia Clarkson and
Stanley Tucci) explain her completely.
The movie delivers many well-deserved
laughs and a sweet ending when she
finds the boy who's her match.

his brother and his kids, and that's per
fect enough for Marie.

"Friends with Benefits"
"Friends with Benefits" shares its prem
ise with "No Strings Attached" —two
friends decide to have emotionless sex
but ultimately fall in love in the process
but it's smart, funny and sweet. It's
about two clever, career-oriented people
so emotionally damaged by their fami
lies that they can't handle the mess of a
relationship. And it updates the rom
com fairytale; what these characters
want is an equal, a best friend and a
partner. It's a film very conscious of its
genre there's even a fake romantic
comedy film within a film that the char
acters poke fun at but it transcends
and reinvents it. Yes, there are many
frank (though well-concealed) sex
scenes, and the outcome is horribly pre
dictable, but the cleverness and strength
of characters make this film everything a
modern romantic comedy should be.

"Definitely, Maybe"

In "Definitely, Maybe," recently divorced
Will Haynes (Ryan Reynolds) decides to
tell his incredibly cute daughter Maya
(Abigail Breslin) the story of how he met
her mother, but he tells it as a mystery.
He changes all the names and tells the
story of the three most important
women (Isla Fisher, Elizabeth Banks and
Rachel Weisz) who graced his life, and
it's up to Maya to decipher which one is
her mother. We understand why each
pair would have fallen for each other,
even though the relationships all ulti
mately ended. There are some very
funny moments, like when Will acciden
tally slips in a detail about having

smoked in the '9os or when he shows
up on Weisz's doorstep, only to be
greeted by her drunken boyfriend (Kevin
Kline), who Will assumes is her father
and gives him lessons in what it means
to be a real man apparently, it
involves a lot of scotch. When Will finally
does figure out which woman he should
be with, when the many layers of all of
the characters have been peeled off and
revealed, it's a corny but realistic happy
ending.

"Easy A"
"Easy A" is a high school romantic com
edy in the tradition of John Hughes
films, with the biting wit and religious
satire of "Saved" and the quips of
"Juno." It's the film that launched Emma
Stone into stardom as Olive
Penderghast, the wise-cracking, confi
dent and lovable outsider who acciden
tally finds herself in the middle of a
rumor that she slept with someone
who is, in fact, imaginary on a first
date. As they are reading "The Scarlet
Letter" in class, she decides to embroi
der an "A" on her own clothing in a
show of irony that's lost on her class
mates. The premise is dubious but the
execution flawless. It's ultimately about a
strong young woman who's too smart
for her classmates, and whose very lik
able parents (Patricia Clarkson and
Stanley Tucci) explain her completely.
The movie delivers many well-deserved
laughs and a sweet ending when she
finds the boy who's her match.

It's Valentine's Day, and that means
either it's time to receive hundreds of
dollars worth of gifts that will wilt or go
bad in a week, or that now's your chance
to spend some quality time staring at
your computer screen watching bad
movies. If option two sounds more like
your life, here are five flicks that aren't
as pitiful to watch on Valentine's Day as
"Titanic."

"Away We Go"
"Away We Go" picks up where most
romantic comedies end: with a couple
very much in love, committed and preg
nant. The couple is Burt (John Krasinski)
and Verona (Maya Rudolph), who
embark on a road trip across the coun
try. They meet up with friends all over,
each with their own hilarious parenting
philosophies, such as Maggie
Gyllenhaal's character's distaste for
strollers: "Why would I want to push my
baby away from me?"

"Dan In Real Life"
In "Dan in Real Life," Steve Carell plays
Dan, a widower and parent of three lov
able daughters, who unwittingly finds
love in a chance encounter with a beau
tiful and sophisticated woman in a book
store, Marie (Juliette Binoche).
Unfortunately, she's his brother's girl
friend. And they're all on a weekend
family retreat together. He handles the

situation like a grown-up, but of course
over the weekend, they fall in love. His
daughters are adorable: The eldest is a
newly-licensed driver preparing to leave
for college, the middle one has a knack
for falling in love and tying cherry stems
in a knot in her mouth and the youngest
is just about the sweetest kid you could
hope for without being naive. Ultimately,
the movie revolves around family, and
while a touching romance ensues, Dan
doesn't have to prove that he's Prince
Charming; he's a single dad who loves
his brother and his kids, and that's per
fect enough for Marie.
