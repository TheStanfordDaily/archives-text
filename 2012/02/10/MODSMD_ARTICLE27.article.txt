Chances are anyone who has attended
freshman year at Stanford has
encountered the work of the
Stanford Improvisors, known as the Simps
for short and as Stanford's only improvisa
tional performing troupe. The Simps' winter
showings last Friday and Saturday night
brewed an uncalculated mastery satisfying
loyal fans and those less familiar with the
group's work.
To start the show, the Simps tackled
Super Scene, a formula allowing student
choice to whittle down from an array of
improvised scenes, each directed by a Simp,
until the "winner" performed the final scene,
capping off the show. Among other plots, the
billing included a drama-suspense-thriller
about an eavesdropping telephone operator
in WWII America and a 1930s French circus
stirred by infidelity. The show ultimately fin
ished with a musical between two aspiring
high school musical stars auditioning for a
part in "High School Musical Stars." After
each of the scenes played out, the audience
voted by applause until one by one, a winner
was reached.
The Oscars should be chosen like this.
While spontaneously scripting their own
scene, the improvisers took cues and the spo

dlers in a horse and pony show, took the
improv and comedy out in strides. The
scenes developed in turn, usually escalating in
stakes and silliness, with the director pausing
and changing plots and lines. The ripe scenes
pleased the crowd with refreshing comedy,
but the real joy came from watching the fum
bles and recoveries. The audience sympa
thized, reveled in the awkward and absurd
and relished the rewinds and do-overs. And
the direction was as funny as what became of
