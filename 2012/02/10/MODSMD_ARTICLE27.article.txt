## IMPROV SImps shine in winter show

Chances are anyone who has attended
freshman year at Stanford has
encountered the work of the
Stanford Improvisors, known as the Simps
for short and as Stanford's only improvisa
tional performing troupe. The Simps' winter
showings last Friday and Saturday night
brewed an uncalculated mastery satisfying
loyal fans and those less familiar with the
group's work.
To start the show, the Simps tackled
Super Scene, a formula allowing student
choice to whittle down from an array of
improvised scenes, each directed by a Simp,
until the "winner" performed the final scene,
capping off the show. Among other plots, the
billing included a drama-suspense-thriller
about an eavesdropping telephone operator
in WWII America and a 1930s French circus
stirred by infidelity. The show ultimately fin
ished with a musical between two aspiring
high school musical stars auditioning for a
part in "High School Musical Stars." After
each of the scenes played out, the audience
voted by applause until one by one, a winner
was reached.
The Oscars should be chosen like this.
While spontaneously scripting their own
scene, the improvisers took cues and the spo
radic line from their directors who, like han
dlers in a horse and pony show, took the
improv and comedy out in strides. The
scenes developed in turn, usually escalating in
stakes and silliness, with the director pausing
and changing plots and lines. The ripe scenes
pleased the crowd with refreshing comedy,
but the real joy came from watching the fum
bles and recoveries. The audience sympa
thized, reveled in the awkward and absurd
and relished the rewinds and do-overs. And
the direction was as funny as what became of
it. The show progressed, and the

audience found itself reluctant to
cast a vote that would eliminate any
of the superb options. The jaunty
performances, so tightly wound but
delightfully turbulent, had everyone
suspecting the group planned the
scenes and reveling in the fact that
they didn't.
As the scenes developed, the
players' respective talents grew to fit
the scene. Max Sosna-Spear 'll
ended the show on a high note, as
his lyrical acumen strung together
several impressive songs with lyrics
as fixed and mawkish as any
Broadway melodramedy. Graduate
student Mathias Crawford's narra
tion of the bizarre circus, inter
spersed with cuckoldry, spiked the
fabulous accents with a sense of sar
castic irony that kept the audience
in stitches: an inside joke for the
whole crowd. Chris Young 'lO
scored the show with his impro
vised piano work. From what must
be a fully stocked repertoire of gen
res and tunes, Young simultaneously
followed and guided the improvis
er's inclinations, almost instructing
the audience what to feel and what
to expect.
But of all these entertainers,
one stood out as the crowd favorite,
motivating plots and bringing an
unmatched playfulness as a genuine
scene-saver. James Mannion 'l3 is
the funniest male on Stanford's
campus. Somewhere between his
accents and composure, Mannion
proved himself an asset to any scene
he can slip into, commanding roar
ing laughter with even obvious lines
or kitschy body movements.
With no scripted lines or pre
planned plot, the Simps rely on
each other to keep the show going
and the audience interested, and
Mannion certainly embodies the
Simps at the top of their game
responsive and supportive.

The second installment of the
show, "Spontaneous Broadway," had
several Simps propose musicals to
the producer-audience based on
their spontaneous renderings of
songs extracted from the musical.
The performers conjured up lyrics

against Young's tunes with only the
title of a song to go on; the audience
provided fake song titles before the
show, which were then drawn out
of a hat and ranged from the soulful
"Meatloaf Monday Blues" to the
tale of licentiousness in "My Lover's
Name is Jose." Before each number, J
the Simp would cue in Young as to "
the tone of the song and the plot of
the musical. By audience vote,
"There's a Fire in My Loins," an aria
by Lindsey Toiaivao 'l3 from the
"'musical" "Amazon on Top,"
received the most funding, and the
full-length Broadway show com
menced.
A 10-minute pause to work-

shop the play and the land of
women resumed, revealing a struc
ture to the play but the substance
undecided. The female ensemble
played against a male trio in what
seemed like an endless upstaging,
leaving all its players winners. The
songs satisfied the audience's antici
pation as the players grappled for
harmony and humor. With only
their eye contact, the improvisers
communicated their hopes and
needs for the scene. There is beauty
in the struggle. They continually
raised the stakes in this tale of the
Amazon women and patriarchal
invaders, suspending the play on the
verge of cultural and sexual collision
the audience grasps at the next
scene, yet to be determined.
But the best was that when the
audience knew the improvisers had
faulted, the performers acknowl
edged it and threw it back to the
audience, inciting even greater
laughter. Those beautiful moments
of nonplussed short circuits spark
into obvious "Aha!" moments that
neither script nor plan could pro
duce.

leaving all its players winners. The
songs satisfied the audience's antici
pation as the players grappled for
harmony and humor. With only
their eye contact, the improvisers
communicated their hopes and
needs for the scene. There is beauty
in the struggle. They continually
raised the stakes in this tale of the
Amazon women and patriarchal
invaders, suspending the play on the
verge of cultural and sexual collision
the audience grasps at the next
scene, yet to be determined.
But the best was that when the
audience knew the improvisers had
faulted, the performers acknowl
edged it and threw it back to the
audience, inciting even greater
laughter. Those beautiful moments
of nonplussed short circuits spark
into obvious "Aha!" moments that
neither script nor plan could pro
duce.

Chances are anyone who has attended
freshman year at Stanford has
encountered the work of the
Stanford Improvisors, known as the Simps
for short and as Stanford's only improvisa
tional performing troupe. The Simps' winter
showings last Friday and Saturday night
brewed an uncalculated mastery satisfying
loyal fans and those less familiar with the
group's work.
To start the show, the Simps tackled
Super Scene, a formula allowing student
choice to whittle down from an array of
improvised scenes, each directed by a Simp,
until the "winner" performed the final scene,
capping off the show. Among other plots, the
billing included a drama-suspense-thriller
about an eavesdropping telephone operator
in WWII America and a 1930s French circus
stirred by infidelity. The show ultimately fin
ished with a musical between two aspiring
high school musical stars auditioning for a
part in "High School Musical Stars." After
each of the scenes played out, the audience
voted by applause until one by one, a winner
was reached.
The Oscars should be chosen like this.
While spontaneously scripting their own
scene, the improvisers took cues and the spo
radic line from their directors who, like han
dlers in a horse and pony show, took the
improv and comedy out in strides. The
scenes developed in turn, usually escalating in
stakes and silliness, with the director pausing
and changing plots and lines. The ripe scenes
pleased the crowd with refreshing comedy,
but the real joy came from watching the fum
bles and recoveries. The audience sympa
thized, reveled in the awkward and absurd
and relished the rewinds and do-overs. And
the direction was as funny as what became of
it. The show progressed, and the

audience found itself reluctant to
cast a vote that would eliminate any
of the superb options. The jaunty
performances, so tightly wound but
delightfully turbulent, had everyone
suspecting the group planned the
scenes and reveling in the fact that
they didn't.
As the scenes developed, the
players' respective talents grew to fit
the scene. Max Sosna-Spear 'll
ended the show on a high note, as
his lyrical acumen strung together
several impressive songs with lyrics
as fixed and mawkish as any
Broadway melodramedy. Graduate
student Mathias Crawford's narra
tion of the bizarre circus, inter
spersed with cuckoldry, spiked the
fabulous accents with a sense of sar
castic irony that kept the audience
in stitches: an inside joke for the
whole crowd. Chris Young 'lO
scored the show with his impro
vised piano work. From what must
be a fully stocked repertoire of gen
res and tunes, Young simultaneously
followed and guided the improvis
er's inclinations, almost instructing
the audience what to feel and what
to expect.
But of all these entertainers,
one stood out as the crowd favorite,
motivating plots and bringing an
unmatched playfulness as a genuine
scene-saver. James Mannion 'l3 is
the funniest male on Stanford's
campus. Somewhere between his
accents and composure, Mannion
proved himself an asset to any scene
he can slip into, commanding roar
ing laughter with even obvious lines
or kitschy body movements.
With no scripted lines or pre
planned plot, the Simps rely on
each other to keep the show going
and the audience interested, and
Mannion certainly embodies the
Simps at the top of their game
responsive and supportive.

The second installment of the
show, "Spontaneous Broadway," had
several Simps propose musicals to
the producer-audience based on
their spontaneous renderings of
songs extracted from the musical.
The performers conjured up lyrics

against Young's tunes with only the
title of a song to go on; the audience
provided fake song titles before the
show, which were then drawn out
of a hat and ranged from the soulful
"Meatloaf Monday Blues" to the
tale of licentiousness in "My Lover's
Name is Jose." Before each number, J
the Simp would cue in Young as to "
the tone of the song and the plot of
the musical. By audience vote,
"There's a Fire in My Loins," an aria
by Lindsey Toiaivao 'l3 from the
"'musical" "Amazon on Top,"
received the most funding, and the
full-length Broadway show com
menced.
A 10-minute pause to work-

shop the play and the land of
women resumed, revealing a struc
ture to the play but the substance
undecided. The female ensemble
played against a male trio in what
seemed like an endless upstaging,
leaving all its players winners. The
songs satisfied the audience's antici
pation as the players grappled for
harmony and humor. With only
