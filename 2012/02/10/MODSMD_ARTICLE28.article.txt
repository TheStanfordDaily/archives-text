# THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM FOR
## SNOWCHELLA 
### â€“ louis LAGALANTE contact louis: lagalant@stanford. edu 
What do professional sound men,
three up-and-coming artists from
disparate genres and an incon
gruous gazebo-shielded stage on Mayfield
Avenue have in common? They all were part
of Sigma Nu and Kappa Kappa Gamma's
third annual Snowchella benefit concert.

"It [was] a massive event this year,"
admitted Joey Mezzatesta 'l2, one of Sigma
Nu's organizers. Co-organizer James Honsa
'l4 clarified, saying, "We started thinking
about the show in August, reaching out to
the artists in November, and the contracts
were finalized over Christmas break."

Such an ambitious project required
more funding than in the past. While previ
ous years' events were primarily powered by
the Stanford Concert Network, this year's pri
mary benefactors were Residential Education,
coordinated by Amanda Rodriguez, and the
Office of Alcohol Policy and Education, coor
dinated by director Ralph Castro as well as
Angelina Cardona 'll.
The grander scale, however, was not
meant simply to wow party-fatigued stu
dents. Rather, the concert's goal was to raise
funds for Support for International Change,
an NGO devoted to fighting HIV/AIDS in
Tanzania. Caroline Smith 'l2, the event
organizer from Kappa, spearheaded the
fundraising efforts due to a long-standing
relationship with the organization.
"I volunteered in Tanzania two years
ago," she explained, "and last year, I was the
campus coordinator [for recruitment]." This

year, she is the U.S. Operations Manager,
responsible for organizing the group's 13 col
lege campus chapters across the country.
Her devotion to the cause did not go
unrewarded: the event raised over $6,000
far exceeding the proceeds of past years.

Of course, that success could not have
occurred without the participation of
Myndset, After the Smoke and Bassj ackers,
the three artists who brought the night to
life. Before the show, Myndset, an electronic
dance DJ, spoke about why he chose to do
this particular show.
"They [Sigma Nu] actually offered me
two events," he offered, "and I chose this one
because of the charity aspect." Even though
he has no personal connection to HIV/AIDS,

for him, "It doesn't matter what the cause is;
[it's] just [about] promoting the longevity of
life at all."

After the Smoke, a Florida-based band
that falls loosely into the category of hip-hop,
had a similar take. When asked why they

chose Snowchella as their first show on the
West Coast, group member Woozy identified
the cause, saying, "What we do and what we
represent is about... helping people..."
Producer Anthony X 2 added that he and
the group "represent people thinking for
themselves and thinking globally."
In addition to empathizing with the
cause, all three artists are trying to increase
their exposure. Anthony X 2 hopes to "evolve
to the next level."

Meanwhile Myndset wants to perpetu
ate a producing culture "the way [l] grew up
with it" and expand his fan base, with a
particular focus on college students because
they are more loyal and more open-minded
than other listeners.

As the night began, though, and hun
dreds of students crowded around the stage to
get even closer to the performers, it became
difficult to think of the future. Instead, it was a
night that existed solely in the present, a pres
ent in which, for one night, artist and con
sumer could unite with Support for
International Change and one another to
"preserve the longevity of life" for everyone.
