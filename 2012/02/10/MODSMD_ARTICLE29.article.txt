## STUFF WE LIKE: 'SHERLOCK'

One of the pit
falls of being
on this side of
the pond is not being
able to readily access
the gems of British tel
evision such as
"Doctor Who" and
"Sherlock" some
thing about these
shows makes for great
television. The
anglophiles are certain
ly to blame for this, but
there's more than that
responsible, though it's

hard to say what. (Forbidden fruit? Greener
grass on the other side?)
Fortunately, "Doctor Who" has gained
a broader viewership in America, so wait
ing for episodes to air in the States while
avoiding spoilers floating on the Internet
isn't nearly as big of an issue anymore. The
same cannot be said for the BBC's modern
day rendition of the Arthur Conan Doyle
series, "Sherlock," which has an air delay of
a few months.
Written and produced by Steven
Moffat and Mark Gatiss, who also are the
masterminds behind "Doctor Who," the
show makes up for what it lacks in quantity
in its quality. The first season of the show
aired in three 90-minute episodes in 2010.
Leave it to the Sherlockians to take screen
caps of virtually every second of the first
season, hyper-analyze every minute detail
and squeal over every meaningful look
shared between Sherlock Holmes and his
blogger, John Watson. (There is a remark
able amount of speculation regarding the
allusion that Holmes and Watson are in a
romantic relationship.)
Benedict Cumberbatch (yes, that's his
real name) and Martin Freeman star as
Holmes and Watson, respectively. Both men
are remarkable actors; the fans will wax
poetic about Cumberbatch's cheekbones
and deep "jaguar with a cello" voice, and
they'll invariably try to persuade you that
Martin Freeman is, in fact, made of kittens.
(Not everything that comes from this fan-

dom is necessarily coherent or normal.)
The show itself, while absolutely bril
liant, wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable if the
fan base wasn't as active and passionate as it
is. A show that has, in total, only six
episodes, 18 cumulative hours of footage
and airs about every year and a half, has
managed to capture an audience that
wholesomely appreciates what the writers
and production crew have put together.
The fans' dedication to the show, despite an
18-month hiatus, cliffhangers and a pro
duction team that delights in trolling the
fans, is resoundingly evident in how many
fan-fictions there are for the show, the bril
liant fan art and the constant dissection of
scenes.
During the hiatus between the first
and second seasons (the latter of which has
already aired in the UK but will debut in
the US in May), the fandom went insane.
I'm a recent newcomer, but during the
months between first seeing the show and
the second season premiere, I've been
sucked into the "Sherlock" fandom. I've
been exposed to some of the battiest fans
I've ever encountered. And let me tell you:
it's been amazing.
"Sherlock" is one of those things that
won't find its complete value simply in the
source. It is truly the perception of the
show that makes it great, which is why we
love "Sherlock."
