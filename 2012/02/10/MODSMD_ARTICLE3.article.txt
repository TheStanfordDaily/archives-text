## University admins terminate Chi Theta Chi lease 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE MARGARET RAWSON 
Stanford moved Wednesday to revoke
the lease of Chi Theta Chi (XOX), one of
two non-University operated houses on
campus, citing lease violations, liability con
cerns and "pressing life safety issues."
"Stanford hereby elects to terminate the
lease pursuant to the termination right set
forth in...the Lease," read a letter delivered

to the Alpha Epsilon Alumni Association of
Theta Chi Fraternity, Inc.
The University will take control of the
house on April 2, due to "the Lessee's failure
to adequately respond to multiple and chron
ic breaches of the Lease," read the letter,
signed by Vice Provost of Student Affairs
Greg Boardman and Senior Associate Vice
Provost of Residential and Dining Enterpris
es Shirley Everett.
Chi Theta Chi, a house known for its inde

pendent spirit, began functioning as a co-op
erative in 1973 but did not officially split
from Theta Chi Fraternity until the late 'Bos.
XOX is one of two houses, the other being
Sigma Chi, that are not operated directly by
Stanford University, but rather have lease
hold agreements. The University owns the
land on which XOX sits, but rents the plot on
a long-term contract with a land-use fee. In
the past, this agreement has al
lowed students more autonomy
regarding administrative deci
sions. A May 1990 report on "Co
operative Living at Stanford" de
scribes the house as "a haven for
groups seeking to avoid Univer
sity red tape."
"We are confused and sad
dened by the University's at
tempt to remove ownership of
the property from the house's
alumni board, which has con
trolled the property for decades,"
said a press release from Chi
Theta Chi. "This transfer of own
ership would directly undermine
the diversity of the living options
available to to undergraduates -

counter to the University's stated
goal."

Boardman, Dean of Residen
tial Education Deborah Golder,
Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney and
other administrators attended a
regularly-scheduled meeting be
tween XOX representatives and
Stanford Housing Wednesday.

Former XOX Resident Assis
tant (RA) Bear Douglas 'O9 M.A.
'lO and former Resident Comput
er Consultant Abel Allison 'OB,
both members of the XOX alum
ni board, described the meeting as
an "ambush" in an email to a XOX
alumni email list.
The administrators informed
XOX that after deliberation, the
University decided not to renew
the house's lease for this coming
fall and to take control of the
house on the first day of spring
quarter. Students will begin pay
ing rent to the University at the
start of spring quarter this year.
The house, which normally re
mains open, will be closed this
coming summer to allow for
University renovations.
According to the email from
Douglas and Allison, the Uni
versity provided several reasons
for its decision. University offi
cials cited that XOX has been
using the tax identification num
ber of Theta Chi Fraternity, de
spite the receipt of a cease-and
desist letter from the organiza
tion. Both Allison and Douglas
denied any knowledge of this vi
olation or such a letter.
The email also said adminis
trators allege that XOX has

failed multiple fire safety inspec
tions, is both financially and ad
ministratively incapable of
avoiding ongoing defaults and
has failed to maintain corporate
status in California.
Administrators also cited con
cerns that the University is ulti
mately responsible in the event of
any lawsuits against the house,
according to the email. A portion
of students living in XOX are as
signed to the house through the
University draw, a factor that cre
ates additional concerns for ad
ministrators worried about the
experience of students who did
not actively choose to live in the
house.

The University is "committed
to working with the [XOX]
alumni board and the residents
of the house to continue a co-op
in the Chi Theta Chi house,"
Whitney said, emphasizing that
the University is concerned fore
most with ensuring the well
being of students and "the long
and short-term stewardship of the
house."

ership would directly undermine
the diversity of the living options
available to to undergraduates -

counter to the University's stated
goal."

Boardman, Dean of Residen
tial Education Deborah Golder,
Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney and
other administrators attended a
regularly-scheduled meeting be
tween XOX representatives and
Stanford Housing Wednesday.

Former XOX Resident Assis
tant (RA) Bear Douglas 'O9 M.A.
'lO and former Resident Comput
er Consultant Abel Allison 'OB,
both members of the XOX alum
ni board, described the meeting as
an "ambush" in an email to a XOX
alumni email list.
The administrators informed
XOX that after deliberation, the
University decided not to renew
the house's lease for this coming
fall and to take control of the
house on the first day of spring
quarter. Students will begin pay
ing rent to the University at the
start of spring quarter this year.
The house, which normally re
mains open, will be closed this
coming summer to allow for
University renovations.
According to the email from
Douglas and Allison, the Uni
versity provided several reasons
for its decision. University offi
cials cited that XOX has been
using the tax identification num
ber of Theta Chi Fraternity, de
spite the receipt of a cease-and
desist letter from the organiza
tion. Both Allison and Douglas
denied any knowledge of this vi
olation or such a letter.
The email also said adminis
trators allege that XOX has

failed multiple fire safety inspec
tions, is both financially and ad
ministratively incapable of
avoiding ongoing defaults and
has failed to maintain corporate
status in California.
Administrators also cited con
cerns that the University is ulti
mately responsible in the event of
any lawsuits against the house,
according to the email. A portion
of students living in XOX are as
signed to the house through the
University draw, a factor that cre
ates additional concerns for ad
ministrators worried about the
experience of students who did
not actively choose to live in the
house.

The University is "committed
to working with the [XOX]
alumni board and the residents
of the house to continue a co-op
in the Chi Theta Chi house,"
Whitney said, emphasizing that
the University is concerned fore
most with ensuring the well
being of students and "the long
and short-term stewardship of the
house."
