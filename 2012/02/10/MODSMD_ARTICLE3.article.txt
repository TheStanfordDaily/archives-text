## University admins terminate Chi Theta Chi lease 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE MARGARET RAWSON 
Stanford moved Wednesday to revoke
the lease of Chi Theta Chi (XOX), one of
two non-University operated houses on
campus, citing lease violations, liability con
cerns and "pressing life safety issues."
"Stanford hereby elects to terminate the
lease pursuant to the termination right set
forth in...the Lease," read a letter delivered

to the Alpha Epsilon Alumni Association of
Theta Chi Fraternity, Inc.
The University will take control of the
house on April 2, due to "the Lessee's failure
to adequately respond to multiple and chron
ic breaches of the Lease," read the letter,
signed by Vice Provost of Student Affairs
Greg Boardman and Senior Associate Vice
Provost of Residential and Dining Enterpris
es Shirley Everett.
Chi Theta Chi, a house known for its inde

pendent spirit, began functioning as a co-op
erative in 1973 but did not officially split
from Theta Chi Fraternity until the late 'Bos.
XOX is one of two houses, the other being
Sigma Chi, that are not operated directly by
Stanford University, but rather have lease
hold agreements. The University owns the
land on which XOX sits, but rents the plot on
a long-term contract with a land-use fee. In
