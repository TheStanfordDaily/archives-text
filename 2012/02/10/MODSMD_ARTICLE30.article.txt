Oh, brunch. Anyone who has spent
more than 15 minutes with me on a
Friday, Saturday or Sunday knows
that brunch is my favorite weekend leisure
activity. It would also be my favorite week
day activity were it not for "being enrolled in
classes." Plus, most restaurants annoyingly
refuse to serve staple brunch foods Monday
through Friday. I'm still reeling from a

recent attempt to get bacon and

pancakes at Mayfield Cafe on
A f . ' T .1 T7" T

Martin Luther King, Jr.

day, foiled when the wait-

ress informed our table that

only the banal "lunch" menu is

available on Mondays. To quote one of my
disappointed brunching companions (by

way of Thomas Paine), "these are the times
that try men's souls."
In my mind, brunch combines all the
best possibilities of the restaurant-going
experience: long, leisurely hours spent at the
table, high calorie foods you would never
cook for yourself (Hollandaise sauce) and a
tacit social sanction to drink alcohol before
noon. Plus, most brunch dishes include
bacon. Bacon tastes really good.
So given that "brunching" is one of my

core competences,
it shouldn't come
as a surprise that
I'm always on the
lookout for a new
spot to further
refine my branch
ing talents. This
weekend, I was
happy to discover
Joanie's Cafe, an
unassuming but
popular restaurant
on California
Avenue, fust a five
minute drive from
campus, Joanie's is

a convenient option for lazy Stanford stu
dents. Plus, the atmosphere is casual enough
that you could literally walk in wearing foot
sie pajamas (or an especially sloppy iteration
of the standard Stanford basketball shorts
and frat tank uniform), and I doubt anyone
would care. On Sunday mornings, the
California Avenue Farmers' Market takes

place right outside Joanie's. Given that both
times I've been, the wait was well over half
an hour, the farmers' market provides a
much-needed diversion. (As an aside, the
only thing a pack of hung-over, straight men
turn out to like less than "branching" is
being forced to wait for a brunch table by
strolling through a farmers' market. Learned
that lesson the hard way.)

But the wait for foanie's is totally

worth it. The menu is packed
•.ii i . 1 rn

with brunch staples waffles,

French toast, a bevy of Eggs

Benedict varietals and more omelet

combinations than you can shake a

stick at. My first time at Joanie's, I

ordered brioche French toast with

strawberries. Although having to separately
order strawberries (an extra $2), real maple
syrup (an extra $1.25), bacon (an extra $3)
and brioche rather than regular bread (an
extra $1.50) was truly irritating, the combi
nation was totally worth it. Also wonderful
was an omelet of smoked salmon, chives and
cream cheese, topped with Hollandaise
sauce. As an added bonus, the coffee is
insanely good, and the waiters come by
about every twenty seconds with free refills.

The archetypically
mediocre Palo
Alto restaurant
suffers from
unnecessarily fan
ciful embellish
ments on already
good dishes, exe
cuted poorly and
with weird ingre
dients. Joanie's
classic, comfort
food-laden menu
is a breath of
fresh air for the
near-campus din
ing scene. All the

ingredients are fresh, the cooking is authen
tic and the atmosphere is far from preten
tious. Just add a few good friends, and you've
got the perfect brunch.
