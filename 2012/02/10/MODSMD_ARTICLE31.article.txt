## YOUNG THE GIANT lights up SF 
### – lauren WILSON contact lauren: lhwilson@stanford. edu 
Modern rock neophytes Young the Giant
launched their second headlining tour
Wednesday night with the first of two sold-out
shows at the historic Fillmore in San Francisco. Sound
quality at the Fillmore is top-notch — some of the best
I've ever experienced in a live venue — and the music
didn't disappoint.
The band started off strong with "Apartment," the
first track off their self-titled debut, followed by the
melodic finesse of "I Got." Lead singer (and former
Stanford student) Sameer Gadhia' 11 opened the num
ber with a slow, almost a cappella line of its cheerful,
swooping hook before the rest of the band kicked in.
During each tune of the night, Gadhia hopped back and
forth between a regular mic and a vintage-looking one
that amplified the reverb effect on his voice. He turned to
it particularly often to elongate the winsome high notes
of "Guns Out." Gadhia's effortlessly smooth vocals are
one of Young the Giant's greatest assets; his distinct tone
sets the band apart and elevates their songs from the
work of their whinier contemporaries.
The night's high point was their second single,
"Cough Syrup," probably the best track off their record.
Everyone in the venue chimed in for the song's incessant
ly catchy chorus. Appropriately, a guy near me whipped
out a bottle of prescription cough syrup and started
chugging it nonchalantly.

Gadhia promised to play some of the
new songs the band had been working on in
their L.A. studio and delivered on it with
"Camera," a slow-starting tune featuring
organ-like keyboard stylings.
For a first night out, everything flowed
pretty smoothly. However, the one kink
Young the Giant still needs to work out is the
pacing of their set. The first half of the show
was stacked with fun sing-alongs like
"Apartment" and "Cough Syrup" but tapered
off after the latter song. The second part
wasn't really a terrible lull, but was certainly
a step down from a stellar start.
The set also felt rather short with its
modest 14-song span. Granted, the band has

only released one album, but they shouldn't
discount fan favorites from their first couple
EPs like "Texas Tea." They particularly
shouldn't do so at West Coast shows, where
followers are more likely to be familiar with
the band's days as the Jakes (for the uniniti
ated, they're originally from Southern
California). They only delved into their Jakes
catalog once with "Shake My Hand," but

regardless of fan deep-cuts, if you're on tour
in support of the only album you've put out
so far, why not play the whole thing? To be
fair, they may have been saving some stuff to
keep things fresh in between their two nights
at the Fillmore. It's a small quibble, but one
that will likely work itself out over the course

of the tour.
The second half was not without its
own merits. A rousing rendition of "God
Made Man" ended the main portion of their
set. The band revels in its ambient jams and
did so here, slowly biding their time and
building up the melody before finally crest
ing with the hook. They closed out the night
with their most recognizable hit, "My Body."
Though a predictable move, it's impossible
to deny the song's infectiousness, with its
charging beat and power chords. Needless to
say, the Fillmore's ceilings were shaking.
Musicians tend to pick opening acts
that complement the main act, and Ohio
up-and-comers Walk the Moon were no

exception. If opening acts are generally in the
same vein as headliners, the pop-rock quar
tet may have come from the same blood cell
(excuse the poor metaphor). Nonetheless,
the openers clearly had a great time warming
up the crowd with a fun, upbeat cover of
Fleet Foxes' "White Winter Hymnal" and the
descending harmonies of the cheekily titled
"I Can Lift a Car." The highlight was "Anna
Sun," an exuberantly youthful ditty that
brought their set to a satisfying end.
