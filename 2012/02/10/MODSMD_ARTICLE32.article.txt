With Laurence Olivier
and Kenneth Branagh
before him as the gods
of modern Shakespeare, Ralph
Fiennes has a lot to live up to. In
"Coriolanus," he proves he just
might be the master of
Shakespeare on film for the 21st
century.
In "Coriolanus," Fiennes skill
fully transports the Shakespearean
play into a convincing modern
piece all without changing the
language. While Branagh's
Shakespearean adaptations favored
long, ten-minute shots, allowing
the scenes to play out as if on stage,
Fiennes daringly transforms the
play into the language of film and
of the film genres that best suit the
material. The scenes never last
more than a few minutes, giving
the film energy and momentum
and making it feel like we are
watching a war or revenge film, not
a work of classical theatre.
Working with a significantly
pared-down screenplay by John
Logan, there is time to savor the

important dialogue that does
remain, and to let images and film
conventions fill in the blanks. The
television broadcast is used fre
quently and very effectively for
exposition in the film: Coriolanus
(played by Fiennes) is a powerful
political figure, so we expect that
this is how the masses would get
their information about him. What
better way to stage monologues
criticizing his actions than on a tel
evision talk show, with the intona
tion of TV commentators?
Coriolanus never soliloquizes,
never connects personally with the
audience, so all that matters in cre
ating his character for us is his
image as broadcast on television.
"Coriolanus" is a play about
an angry man whose hubris
trumps his political ambitions and
whose rash temper causes him to
team up with his enemy to wage
war on his own country in defense
of his pride. He responds viscerally
to everything he is, after all, a
military man and Fiennes situ
ates the play within film genres

where
this makes sense. It's a cross
between a war film, a political
thriller and a revenge picture, with
enough physical brutality and
honor not to be out of place in a
Western. When Coriolanusis
exiled, the first image of his depar
ture is his large black boots pound
ing on the ground as he walks. We
get many close-ups of Coriolanus's
scarred face and body, scars he
refuses to put on spectacle for polit
ical gain, and of his mouth, spitting
out words in a fury.
When we change locations,
titles flash on the screen to tell us
where we are, much like the globe
trotting action flicks of today such
as "The International" or
"Haywire." When Coriolanus cam
paigns for consul, he speaks to the

commoners and shakes their hands
in a montage that would feel just as
at home in "Primary Colors" or
"The Ides of March." The political
discussions are set in cold business
offices, with Coriolanus's opposi
tion dressed in fancy suits, effort
lessly emphasizing their mind-over
body mentality

These cinematic feats would be
worthless if Fiennes got the language
wrong, but he and his cast nail it.

bly lucid line readings, with tones
that fits the modern setting. The
words maybe in iambic pentameter,
but the quality of the acting brings
them to life; it's a faithful
Shakespearean adaptation.
But this is Fiennes's first fea
ture as a director, and his inexperi
ence shows. The film is shot almost
entirely, and misguidedly, with a
handheld camera, to give the work
immediacy and disorient us.
However, it mostly comes off as

lazy directing: Fiennes is still
uncertain where to put the camera,
what to focus on, or for how long.
"Coriolanus" is a thoughtful,
though imperfect, rendering of an
often-overlooked Shakespeare play,
and it's proof that Fiennes is going
to be a force to reckon with not
just in front of the camera, but also
behind it.
