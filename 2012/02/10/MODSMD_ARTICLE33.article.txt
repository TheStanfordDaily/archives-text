## Stanley Clarke Band delivers jazzy performance

Stanley Clarke Band recently
swung through San Francisco,
playing a fantastic show with a
familiar repertoire re-imagined. From
the album "Return to Forever," the song
"No Mystery" was recreated for an
acoustic ensemble, full of energy and
spunk but with no signs of fusion, and
with space made for the violin to play a
key part in sharing the melody with the
piano. The Band transforms pieces from
Clarke's relaxed, cool jazz trio album
"Jazz in the Garden," such as "Paradigm
Shift," "Sakura Sakura" and "Three

Wrong Notes," into something closer to
bebop. They've got the energetic rock
sensibilities, but thankfully and gratify

ingly, they stuck to their jazz and fusion
free roots.
There is no other jazz bassist quite
like Stanley Clarke. Though his main
stream fame comes from his rock-star
fusion electric bass playing from "Return
to Forever," it's his upright bass work
where he's a true visionary. He has the
uncanny ability to play the bass like a cel
list, equally comfortable leading the
melody or backing it up with bass lines
that do so much more than walk the
chords. He can also transform his bass
into a percussion instrument in what are

always crowd-pleasing turns, slap
ping it up and down like a drum,
making use of the differences in
pitch depending on where he hits
the neck and fingerboard.
Although missing frequent
guest pianist Fliromi, the Stanley
Clarke Band was in top form with
its current lineup. Ruslan Sirota's
move from electric keyboards to a
Steinway grand has led him to find
a new lucidity, allowing for crisper,
more articulated sounds, so neces
sary in allowing him to build com
plex parts in both hands and have
them heard by the audience.

Violinist Zach Brock has great

chemistry with Clarke; the two are
able to play off and accentuate each
other's work, making these two
stringed instruments anything but
stiff. Ronald Bruner, Jr. on drums is
also a notch above your average
drummer, taking the time to build
rhythms in his solos, using the base
rhythms of the piece and only
sometimes resorting to haphazard
loud banging, the usual pitfall of
the drum solo. At times, Bruner's
solos turned into a marvelous

rhythmic call-and-response with
himself.

This was a concert without
lows: It started off well and, by the

end, reached even greater heights.
Stanley Clark Band can seamlessly
piece together a melody on multi
ple instruments: one phrase on the
piano, the next on violin and the
next on bass, sometimes with a

couple of instruments leading the
melody in tandem. In the first

piece, "No Mystery," I was so satis
fied by the Stanley Clarke Band's
playing and their solos that by the
time we hit Clarke's solos, it was a
shock that things were certain to
get better. There's an unmatched
fullness of sound and complexity
to Clarke's playing, created by care
fully chosen rhythms, punctuated

with silence and rests which help
create focal points and enhance the
melodic riffs. In his "No Mystery"
solo, Clarke explored the melody
and found similarities to other

pieces, quoting from funk to pop
and ending with a few bars of "My
Girl," which Bruner even added to
with a bit of vocals.

The Stanley Clarke Band is
solid; Clarke's solos never fail to be
the zenith of any piece. But what
makes the band great, more than
just adequate backup for the great
Clarke, is the way they play off
each other. They improvise togeth
er, they collaborate on melodies

and rhythms across instruments,
they have synergistic energy and
they do it all so smoothly that you
might mistake the bass for drums
or the violin for the upper register
of the bass. They work hard to
make the most of what each
instrument has to offer to enhance
a piece: it's democratic and nothing
short of awe-inspiring.
