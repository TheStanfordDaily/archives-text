Gina Gionfriddo s recent work displayed
at the SF Playhouse, Pulitzer Prize
finalist "Becky Shaw," is the best piece
of theatre in San Francisco at the moment, and
indeed, in the last few months. Gionfriddo s

script is trenchant and clever, with enough
laugh-out-loud epigrams to fill an Oscar Wilde
play. But the play has more in common with
early Woody Allen movies like "Annie Flail" that
mix pathos with comedy than with "The

Importance of Being Earnest."
The death of Suzanna's father has left the
family penniless not broke, but without sav

multiple sclerosis, has taken a younger lover, her
house painter, which disgusts Suzanna (Liz
Sklar). Her cynical, adopted brother Max (Brian
Robert Bums), on the other hand, sees this as a
reasonable business deal; she simply can't afford
to hire help to deal with her illness. It has also
left Suzanna severely depressed, unable to get
off the couch and glued to trashy television sto

too much free time" to be depressed; Suzanna
replies, "I'm a graduate student!"
Becky Shaw is the MacGuffin of the play,

(Lauren English), a temp at Andrew's (Lee
Dolson) office, is the seemingly unfortunate
recipient of a blind date with Max, a cold
blooded New York finance guy. Max is judg
mental, and when Becky shows up by taxi with

out a cell phone, he asks if she's Amish or just
one of those crazy environmental freaks.
Unsurprisingly, their date goes badly: they get
mugged, have bad sex and he kicks her out pre
maturely.
What transpires is the unraveling of every
relationship in the play. Suzanna's husband,
Andrew, who saved her from depression after her
father's death, feels responsible for Becky's post
date trauma and is drawn to nurse yet another
sick puppy to health. Is he legitimately and
