Gina Gionfriddo s recent work displayed
at the SF Playhouse, Pulitzer Prize
finalist "Becky Shaw," is the best piece
of theatre in San Francisco at the moment, and
indeed, in the last few months. Gionfriddo s

script is trenchant and clever, with enough
laugh-out-loud epigrams to fill an Oscar Wilde
play. But the play has more in common with
early Woody Allen movies like "Annie Flail" that
mix pathos with comedy than with "The

Importance of Being Earnest."
The death of Suzanna's father has left the
family penniless not broke, but without sav
ings. Her mother, Susan (Lorri Holt), who has
multiple sclerosis, has taken a younger lover, her
house painter, which disgusts Suzanna (Liz
Sklar). Her cynical, adopted brother Max (Brian
Robert Bums), on the other hand, sees this as a
reasonable business deal; she simply can't afford
to hire help to deal with her illness. It has also
left Suzanna severely depressed, unable to get
off the couch and glued to trashy television sto
ries about prostitutes. As Max puts it, "She has
too much free time" to be depressed; Suzanna
replies, "I'm a graduate student!"
Becky Shaw is the MacGuffin of the play,
which is really a study of relationships and their
forms platonic, romantic and familial
that can sometimes bleed together. Becky
(Lauren English), a temp at Andrew's (Lee
Dolson) office, is the seemingly unfortunate
recipient of a blind date with Max, a cold
blooded New York finance guy. Max is judg
mental, and when Becky shows up by taxi with

out a cell phone, he asks if she's Amish or just
one of those crazy environmental freaks.
Unsurprisingly, their date goes badly: they get
mugged, have bad sex and he kicks her out pre
maturely.
What transpires is the unraveling of every
relationship in the play. Suzanna's husband,
Andrew, who saved her from depression after her
father's death, feels responsible for Becky's post
date trauma and is drawn to nurse yet another
sick puppy to health. Is he legitimately and


harmlessly kind? Or is this kind of
damage something he gets off on? As
Max notes to Suzanna, Andrew mar
ried the last helpless woman he met
Meanwhile, Suzanna and Max's semi
incestuous tryst and her dependency
on him—which her mother claims
he cultivated starting at a young age
—start to interfere with her marriage.
Do they have a relationship? Is it alto
gether okay that Susan uses her
boyfriend with the understanding that
he's using her, too?
The play is rife with moral
ambiguity and asks many questions
without really passing judgment on
any of its flawed, richly drawn char
acters. The SF Playhouse proves a
wonderful space for this intimate
family comedy of "middle-class man
ners," as it has been called. Wherever
you're sitting, you get a clear view of
all of the actors' faces and move
ments. The stage is small, too, which
adds a level of claustrophobia to their
interactions: the discomfiture within
the family is exacerbated by the lack
of space to flee from one another.
There is a lot of talent onstage: great
comedic timing, motivated blocking
with seamless movement on the stage
and the ability of all the actors to play
the gamut of emotions, from fear to
joy to dismissive insecurity. But too
often did the actors stumble over
their lines, jumbling them up; the
play needs to run for a couple more
weeks to become fully polished.

Soon, it will be not just a wonderful
piece of theatre, but a masterful one.
