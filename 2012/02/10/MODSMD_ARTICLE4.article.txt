## SSE late on student payments ASSU financial branch plagued by understaffing 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Student-group leaders and fi
nancial officers have increasingly
voiced their frustration concerning
Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE) banking process, with some
students reporting delays of up to
four months before receiving com
pensation for expenses they paid
out-of-pocket on behalf of a group.
Feross Aboukhadijeh 'l2,
founder and leader of the Stanford
Association for Computing Ma
chinery (ACM), bought iPads last
spring quarter as prizes for a hack
ing competition that ACM organ
ized and independently funded.
According to Aboukhadijeh, his
request for reimbursement has
been rejected three times for small
mistakes in documentation.

Once, SSE put the group's re
quest on hold because the amount
filed for was exactly one cent less
than what was on the receipt,
Aboukhadijeh said.

Each time his request for reim
bursement was rejected,
Aboukhadijeh said he had to wait
five to six weeks for the requests to
be evaluated before he could refile.
It took four months for SSE to re
imburse $6OO from the funds his
club had independently raised.
"Dealing with the reimburse
ment process and ... SSE with all
their finances has been the worst
part of my job," he added.
