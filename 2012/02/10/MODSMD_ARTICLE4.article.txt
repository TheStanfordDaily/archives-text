## SSE late on student payments ASSU financial branch plagued by understaffing 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Student-group leaders and fi
nancial officers have increasingly
voiced their frustration concerning
Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE) banking process, with some
students reporting delays of up to
four months before receiving com
pensation for expenses they paid
out-of-pocket on behalf of a group.
Feross Aboukhadijeh 'l2,
founder and leader of the Stanford
Association for Computing Ma
chinery (ACM), bought iPads last
spring quarter as prizes for a hack
ing competition that ACM organ
ized and independently funded.
According to Aboukhadijeh, his
request for reimbursement has
been rejected three times for small
mistakes in documentation.

Once, SSE put the group's re
quest on hold because the amount
filed for was exactly one cent less
than what was on the receipt,
Aboukhadijeh said.

Each time his request for reim
bursement was rejected,
Aboukhadijeh said he had to wait
five to six weeks for the requests to
be evaluated before he could refile.
It took four months for SSE to re
imburse $6OO from the funds his
club had independently raised.
"Dealing with the reimburse
ment process and ... SSE with all
their finances has been the worst
part of my job," he added.

More than 35 users "liked" a sta
tus Aboukhadijeh posted Jan. 23
on his Facebook wall, which ex
pressed his frustration with the
SSE banking process. SSE, an in
dependent branch of the ASSU,
manages the finances for all stu
dent groups.
Internal setbacks
Dylan Plofker 'l2, director of
SSE's Capital Group, acknowl
edged the backlog.
"We are working to speed [the
reimbursement process] up,"
Plofker said this week. "We have
actually caught up half of the
backlog in the last few weeks."
According to Plofker, the
backlog was caused when several
crucial SSE components fell apart
in a short time span.
At the end of the 2010-11 aca
demic year, SSE lost one of its
full-time accountants and has
struggled to replace her through a
slow recruitment and training
process, he said. At the begin
ning of this academic year, SSE's
documentation server crashed,
causing them to lose access to
their system for several days, as
well as deleting all of the requests
that were being processed at the
time.
In addition, due to a new docu
mentation policy instituted last
spring requiring both a credit card
statement and a line-by-line re
ceipt, reimbursement requests
take more time to process, ac
cording to SSE's Chief Executive
Officer Neveen Mahmoud 'll.
"[We] have realized that the
main issue is that requests actual
ly take a lot longer than they used
to in the past, with the same
amount of staffing," Mahmoud
said at an ASSU Undergraduate
Senate meeting on Jan. 30. "[But]
I think we should be fully caught
up, definitely by the end of this
quarter."
Students experience delay in
process

Students interviewed by The
Daily disagreed with Plofker's
claim that over the past two years
requests typically took three to
five days.
Aaron Acosta 'l3, drum major
for the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band
(LSJUMB), estimated that over
his two years as a band section
leader, reimbursements took an

average of six to seven months
after a request was filed.
Acosta said he is still waiting
for one payment of $251 from the
beginning of the academic year
when he bought new drumsticks
and replaced old equipment.
Acosta filed the reimbursement
request in October, he said.
"It's frustrating because if our
student group were to just process
all of our finances through a nor
mal bank like Wells Fargo or
Bank of America, everything that
we do would be ready the next
business day or the same business
day," said Wesley Ford 'l3, who
has served as the financial officer
for both the Stanford Cycling
Club and the Solar Car Project.
"But somehow, because we have
a student bank, transactions take
a month. If you had to wait for a
month for Wells Fargo ... it
would be unacceptable . . . but
somehow it's different here."

Ford who has lodged for
mal complaints against the SSE
and met with officials from Capi
tal Group last spring said that
other University departments
that fund student projects don't
take nearly as long to process re
quests.

"Other University depart
ments usually have a hierarchy
above them so they're actually ac
countable to someone, whereas
[for] the SSE, as far as I know ...

there is [not] that much over
sight," Ford said.

Several students have com
plained about the minute particu
lars that cause the SSE to reject
reimbursement requests. For in
stance, Acosta said SSE rejected a
reimbursement request because
his last name hadn't been printed
on the receipt, despite being on
the scan of his attached credit
card statement.

Fleet Street singer Andrew
Forsyth 'l4 said he purchased
tuxedos for the group's new mem
bers in late September, an ex
pense of about $7OO. Despite re
filing almost immediately when a
problem with his paperwork was
reported, Forsyth said he has still
not received reimbursement.

Voluntary student organiza
tions (VSOs) are required to
bank through SSE in order to use
Stanford's name and retain their
non-profit status, according to the
ASSU Constitution.

Forsyth said, however, that the
lengthy and complex reimburse
ment process has led Fleet Street
to seriously consider opening a
Wells Fargo account.
"Student groups are resorting
to other measures to get their

funds," Forsyth said. "We do not
want to put our money into the
SSE banking system ... We have
enough econ majors on this cam
pus to tell you that if you don't
have liquid assets, then they're
not worth anything. If we can't
spend our money, it is worth so
much less to us."
Understaffed, but 'looking up'
Ford argued that the SSE is
understaffed a statement with
which Plofker agreed.
"It definitely is [under
staffed]," Plofker said. "We are
currently looking for another full
time accountant... [But] since
[he or she would be] a full time
Stanford employee, it takes a lot
longer than a normal hiring
process."

According to Plofker, SSE has
been looking to fill the position
since fall quarter, and the hiring
will not be finalized until spring
quarter.

"Unfortunately it is somewhat
of a bureaucracy," he added.
Meanwhile, students say they
feel left out of the SSE loop.
Several students including
Ford, Forsyth and Aboukhadijeh,
who all approached SSE or ASSU
members with complaints about
the process said that the re
sponses they received reflected
more concern with public image
than actual reform.

"All of us student group lead
ers are trying to get stuff done,
trying to put on awesome events,"
said Aboukhadijeh, whose group
does not get any of its funds from
The Stanford Fund, general fees
or special fees.
"Even though it's our student
group who raises all the money ..
. we're stuck ... giving them our
money and then begging for them
to give it back," Aboukhadijeh
said.

Still, students said things seem
to be looking up. SSE members
said they are confident that they
will get through the backlog by
the end of the quarter and en
courage all financial officers to
come to them with problems.
"Right now, this week, things
are pretty good," Ford said.
"Things are taking two weeks,
maybe, to process."
"[But] it shouldn't take a spe
cial request to get important
transactions processed," Ford
added. "Just by default, it should
happen within a couple days, [or]
a week at most."
