## Facebook IPO inspires students 
### LINDSEY TXAKEEYANG 
Following Facebook's Feb. 1
filing for an initial public offering
(IPO), University professors and
alumni told The Daily the change
will not affect Facebook's daily
operations, but does create poten
tial for the company to become an
even bigger resource for Stan
ford.

Blake Johnson, a professor of
management science and engi
neering, said he does not believe
Facebook's financial situation will
change in any material way due to
the IPO because the company has
been able to raise as much money
as it desired in the private market.
Johnson added that although
public scrutiny increases once a
company becomes public, Face
book has always been under enor
mous amounts of public scrutiny.
"The world doesn't change
that much for Facebook," Johnson
said.

In a letter published during
the IPO filing, Facebook CEO
Mark Zuckerberg stated, "We
don't wake up in the morning
with the primary goal of making
money, but we understand that
the best way to achieve our mis
sion is to build a strong and valu
able company."

"This is how we think about
our IPO as well," Zuckerberg
continued. "We're going public
for our employees and investors."
Johnson agreed with this as
sessment.

"It's to allow their employees
to realize the value of their stock,"
Johnson said. "That's likely to be
the bigger impact for both Face-
book and Stanford."
According to The New York
Times, about 1,000 Google em
ployees became millionaires on
paper after its IPO in 2004.
"Lots and lots of people left
Google, not necessarily because
they were dissatisfied with
Google, but [because], 'Hey I
have some money, and I'm going
to start something of my own,'"
Johnson said.
He added that the chances of
this happening with Facebook's
employees are even higher, as a
lot of people after seeing the
success of companies such as
Google went to Facebook with
the knowledge this would hap
pen.

Steve Garrity 'O4, co-founder
of the social media company
Hearsay Social, said he believes
many students come to Stanford
with the idea of starting their own
company one day, calling it the
"Silicon Valley dream." Garrity
said Facebook exemplifies this
dream.

While the relationship be
tween Stanford and Facebook is
unlikely to change as Facebook
continues its move towards be

coming public, it most likely
means "more growth, more jobs
for Stanford students," Garrity
said.

Since its arrival to northern
California, Facebook has provid
ed jobs and internships to Stan
ford students.

Feross Aboukhadijeh 'l2, who
interned at Facebook during the
summer of 2010, said he was part
of a team of five people three
employees and two interns
that worked on building a new
version of Facebook groups. The
project went live in October after
four months of work.

"It was the coolest experience
in my life up to that point,"
Aboukhadijeh said. "It's a good a
way to get industry experience
and learn how a well-run compa
ny does its stuff."
"Stanford makes CS majors,
and Facebook hires them," he
added.

Alex Hoffer 'l3, president of
the Blyth Fund and a member of
the board of Stanford Finance,
wrote in an email to The Daily
that, "the IPO of Facebook shows
many aspiring entrepreneurs that
a group of young, very bright peo
ple can create a tremendous
amount of value very quickly. It's
a very inspiring story."

"Facebook and Stanford have
a long history together," Garrity
said, "and I think they'll continue
to do a lot of great things togeth
er. An IPO would just be exciting
for everybody."
"A lot of [Facebook's] employ
ees are young and do interesting
things, and a lot of these things
will involve Stanford, Stanford
students and Stanford research
projects," Johnson said.
