# STUDENT LIFE
## Students share concerns with Faculty Senate 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Student presentations by ASSU representa
tives led the agenda at the Faculty Senate's Feb. 9
meeting. The session also included a report by
Dean of Earth Sciences Pamela Matson.
President John Flennessy opened the meeting
by noting the conclusion of the Stanford Chal
lenge, a five-year fundraising initiative that raised
$6.2 billion in pledges for the University.The Chal
lenge fundraising will support areas including new
faculty positions, need-based financial aid and fa
cility construction.
ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2 opened the
segment devoted to student presentations by dis
cussing the significance of diversity at Stanford,
noting that among the vast range of issues fac
ing students the composition of the University
affects the entire campus community.
Emphasizing steps already taken, such as the
development of the Native American Communi
ty Center (NACC) and the subsequent spike in re
tention among Native American students, Cruz
credited the University with embracing diversity,
but highlighted the importance of continued
progress.

"This diversity ultimately gives students more
ways to connect with their faculty and their ad
ministrators," Cruz said.

amining office hours and advising
structures.
Noting that students often find
faculty daunting, Thompson ar
gued for "office hours where stu
dents can talk not just about the
class but also their Stanford ca
reer" and for faculty to become
more proactive in encouraging stu
dent engagement.
Thompson also said a lack of
outreach by academic advisers can
marginalize their utility to stu
dents, especially in important areas
such as recommendations and
honors theses.

Noting that the recent Study of
Undergraduate Education
(SUES) report highlighted the
falling number of honors students
as an area of concern, Thompson
suggested that increased access to
faculty advising may reverse the
trend.

Daniel DeLong 'l3, ASSU un
dergraduate representative to the
Faculty Senate, emphasized the
flawed nature of Stanford's cur
rent course evaluation system, cit
ing stress imposed on faculty
coupled with a lack of awareness
among students of the purpose and
application of evaluations and a
lack of transparency surrounding
how evaluations impact the future
of courses.

"We have an imperfect evalua
tion process, [and] one that really
affects untenured faculty," De-
Long said. "It makes them be safe
rather than challenging students."
Kamil Dada 'll, ASSU gradu
ate representative and former
Daily editor in chief, highlighted
four issues needing review. Dada
noted that co-terminal students,
trapped between undergraduate
and graduate student bodies, often
fail to integrate into the University
community. He highlighted a lack
of awareness among graduate stu
dents about the Honor Code at
Stanford and its implications for
academic work.
Dada also cited the lack of
counseling available to PhD and
post-doctoral students at the Ca
reer Development Center and the
yearlong nature of Cardinal Care
health insurance regardless of
leaves of absence as other
pressing concerns.

Faculty members largely con
curred with the ASSU representa
tives' reports, with discussion fo
cusing on the interaction between
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents and the merits of course
evaluations.
Both Cruz and Dada said the
ASSU can and should play a role in
increasing interaction between un
dergraduate and graduate stu
dents, noting that the ASSU al
ready includes leadership from
both communities.
"The barrier between under
graduate and graduate students is
co-created," Cruz said. "The ASSU
is trying to bridge that gap by
bringing them into the same loca
tion."

Caroline Hoxby, a professor in
economics, cited the move to on
line evaluations as promoting po
larized student viewpoints, noting
that students who are apathetic to
ward a class are less likely to evalu
ate it. Hoxby advocated in class
course evaluations.

"I think that it has degraded the
overall evaluation process," she
concluded, "and students don't
take them seriously."

Matson followed the student
reports with a presentation on the
School of Earth Sciences. Noting
the Earth Sciences' role in address
ing pressing global challenges,
Matson argued for the field's sus
tained prominence at Stanford and
cited the school's ability to adapt to
new challenges.
While acknowledging that en
couraging more minority appli
cants has proven a challenge, Mat
son highlighted the growth in ap
plications to the graduate program
up 64 percent from 2005-06
as among the highest in the Uni
versity.

The number of undergraduate
majors within the school has grown
similarly by 41 percent since
2005-06. Matson said that the
school has gradually created an in
tellectual community with re
sources available to the broader
University.
The Faculty Senate's next meet
ing is scheduled for Feb. 23, when
the Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policies (C-USP)
will bring the SUES report's rec
ommendations before the Senate.
The March 8 session is also re
served for discussion of the report.

Student presentations by ASSU representa
tives led the agenda at the Faculty Senate's Feb. 9
meeting. The session also included a report by
Dean of Earth Sciences Pamela Matson.
President John Flennessy opened the meeting
by noting the conclusion of the Stanford Chal
lenge, a five-year fundraising initiative that raised
$6.2 billion in pledges for the University.The Chal
lenge fundraising will support areas including new
faculty positions, need-based financial aid and fa
cility construction.
ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2 opened the
segment devoted to student presentations by dis
cussing the significance of diversity at Stanford,
noting that among the vast range of issues fac
ing students the composition of the University
affects the entire campus community.
Emphasizing steps already taken, such as the
development of the Native American Communi
ty Center (NACC) and the subsequent spike in re
tention among Native American students, Cruz
credited the University with embracing diversity,
but highlighted the importance of continued
progress.

"This diversity ultimately gives students more
ways to connect with their faculty and their ad
ministrators," Cruz said.

Reagan Thompson 'l2, ASSU representative
at-large, focused on expanding the extent and type
of faculty-student interaction in particular, ex-

amining office hours and advising
structures.
Noting that students often find
faculty daunting, Thompson ar
gued for "office hours where stu
dents can talk not just about the
class but also their Stanford ca
reer" and for faculty to become
more proactive in encouraging stu
dent engagement.
Thompson also said a lack of
outreach by academic advisers can
marginalize their utility to stu
dents, especially in important areas
such as recommendations and
honors theses.

Noting that the recent Study of
Undergraduate Education
(SUES) report highlighted the
falling number of honors students
as an area of concern, Thompson
suggested that increased access to
faculty advising may reverse the
trend.

Daniel DeLong 'l3, ASSU un
dergraduate representative to the
Faculty Senate, emphasized the
flawed nature of Stanford's cur
rent course evaluation system, cit
ing stress imposed on faculty
coupled with a lack of awareness
among students of the purpose and
application of evaluations and a
lack of transparency surrounding
how evaluations impact the future
of courses.

"We have an imperfect evalua
tion process, [and] one that really
affects untenured faculty," De-
Long said. "It makes them be safe
rather than challenging students."
Kamil Dada 'll, ASSU gradu
ate representative and former
Daily editor in chief, highlighted
four issues needing review. Dada
noted that co-terminal students,
trapped between undergraduate
and graduate student bodies, often
fail to integrate into the University
community. He highlighted a lack
of awareness among graduate stu
dents about the Honor Code at
Stanford and its implications for
academic work.
Dada also cited the lack of
counseling available to PhD and
post-doctoral students at the Ca
reer Development Center and the
yearlong nature of Cardinal Care
health insurance regardless of
leaves of absence as other
pressing concerns.

Faculty members largely con
curred with the ASSU representa
tives' reports, with discussion fo
cusing on the interaction between
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents and the merits of course
evaluations.
Both Cruz and Dada said the
ASSU can and should play a role in
increasing interaction between un
dergraduate and graduate stu
dents, noting that the ASSU al
ready includes leadership from
both communities.
"The barrier between under
graduate and graduate students is
co-created," Cruz said. "The ASSU
is trying to bridge that gap by
bringing them into the same loca
tion."

Caroline Hoxby, a professor in
economics, cited the move to on
line evaluations as promoting po
larized student viewpoints, noting
that students who are apathetic to
ward a class are less likely to evalu
ate it. Hoxby advocated in class
course evaluations.

"I think that it has degraded the
overall evaluation process," she
concluded, "and students don't
take them seriously."

Matson followed the student
reports with a presentation on the
School of Earth Sciences. Noting
the Earth Sciences' role in address
ing pressing global challenges,
Matson argued for the field's sus
tained prominence at Stanford and
cited the school's ability to adapt to
new challenges.
While acknowledging that en
couraging more minority appli
cants has proven a challenge, Mat
son highlighted the growth in ap
plications to the graduate program
up 64 percent from 2005-06
as among the highest in the Uni
versity.

The number of undergraduate
majors within the school has grown
similarly by 41 percent since
2005-06. Matson said that the
school has gradually created an in
tellectual community with re
sources available to the broader
University.
