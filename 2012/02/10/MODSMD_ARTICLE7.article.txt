## Innovation centers seek to address high textbook prices 
### SARAH MOORE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While spending hundreds of dollars on text
books and course readers written by the profes
sors teaching the related courses is a common
experience for Stanford students, Stanford re
search and innovation labs are working on proj
ects to reduce course material costs by address
ing copyright licensing.
Stanford's CodeX, also known as the Stan

ford Center for Legal Informatics, and Media X
have been working on a "Print on Demand"
system a new way to lower prices for course
materials.

"Our University pays several million dollars
to get access for our students to certain materi
als, and frequently when professors did course
readers, they didn't check what the University
had rights to," said Roland Vogl, project direc
tor of Stanford Intellectual Property Exchange
(SIPX). "We built a system that automates

many of those processes and also takes into ac
count the rights the student already has under
the library's permission."

During the 2011 spring quarter. Print on De
mand was used to print course readers for three
Stanford classes. Students paid up to 78 percent
less for the course readers produced by this new
system.

SIPX is currently developing a "Publish on
Demand" system, in which it "will
integrate with the intranet learning
management system used at Stan
ford to distribute electronic course
materials, as well as explore mobile
distribution opportunities," accord
ing to its website.
Overall, the Stanford communi
ty is clearly looking for cheaper
ways for professors to compile and
develop course materials through
projects such as SIPX and digital
coursereaders.

Professors do not usually have
any say in the prices of the books
they write, even if the materials are
published by Stanford University
Press, economics professor John
Taylor said in an email to The Daily.
"As with any book, textbook
prices are determined by cost of
physical production, payments to
editors, writers, marketing and
sales representatives, bookstore
(or online) margins and publisher
profits,"Taylor wrote. "In addition
many textbooks are accompanied
by supplements: test-banks, in
structors' manuals, course man
agement services, web pages,
slides, etc., which add to the cost."
Taylor authored the current
textbook used to instruct Eco
nomics IA. The textbook costs
$270 at the Stanford Bookstore.
According to computer sci
ence professor Eric Roberts
author of Stanford's CS 106A:
Programming Methodology text
book, which the Stanford Book
store sells for $127 new and $92.50
used there are three main
sources of cost for course readers:
production, permissions and
bookstore revenue. Roberts will

teach CS 106A this spring.
"For most courses, the largest
share is permissions," Roberts
said. "We have to pay copyright
laws. To put together a reader, you
have to get permission to use any
of the materials you have in the
reader. Those permission costs
vary. We're very fortunate here.
The bookstore does the research
for us and actually has standing
agreements with a number of the
major publishers."
Particular publishers have
standard page costs that make
permission costs easy to compute,
but copyright fees are not con
stant for all materials.

For instance, Roberts said he
taught a poetry class last year with
significantly fewer pages than the
typical course reader, but a no
tably greater price.

Production costs include what
ever the bookstore and subcon
tractors need in order to photo
copy the material. Bookstore rev
enue is the percentage of sales
that the private company on cam
pus is compensated.
Roberts is currently working to
publish the CS 1068 course read
er online. The material is also
available for sale in the bookstore,
where it costs $64.25, and Roberts
encourages students to buy it.
"Print copies are still enor
mously helpful," he said. "People
will come to office hours with the
reader all marked up with lots of
highlighter and little arrows and
post-its because it helps them."
Additionally, a print copy of
the CS 1068 course reader is also
advantageous because it is permit
ted during tests, while online
sources are not, Roberts said.
When asked why he has elected
to offer the reader online, Roberts
responded that some people simply
like having a digital copy. However,

some students would also choose
digital copies if costs were signifi
cantly lower or nonexistent,
Roberts said.

Roberts acknowledges it is a lot
more common than 25 years ago to
put course materials online simply
because technology has advanced.
Nonetheless, with this progress,
there have been issues with faculty
posting copyrighted materials on
the Internet.

"It helps prices a little, but it's
not the right thing to circumvent
those rights," Roberts said."There's
a big push in the Internet age for
free material, but I've written some
books, and they take an enormous
amount of time. I've put three years
of work into this current one, and
the publishers put time into this
project too. If you expect all that to
happen for free, the quality will go
down."

Regardless, students still look
for ways to decrease the prices they
pay for course materials.
The seventh edition of Taylor's
Principles of Economics, co-writ
ten with Akila Weerapana of
Wellesley College, was released for
purchase in time for the start of the
2012 winter quarter.

"Most new modern introducto
ry textbooks in economics, whether
used at Stanford and other univer
sities, are comparable in price,"Tay
lor said, concerning the price of his
textbook. "Savings are available
from using used books or older edi
tions. Online purchases can also
have a lower price."
"Prices have risen substantially
in the past twenty years," Taylor
said. "I think that competition from
online alternatives to physical texts
are going to drive down the price of
texts in the future. I hope so."
