## How Guttentag writes for film 
### ANN TYLER MOSES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two-time Academy Award-winning writer,
producer and director Bill Guttentag spoke
Thursday evening about his experience writing
for film and television in discussion with Stan
ford English lecturer Hilton Obenzinger.
The Hume Writing Center and Stanford
Continuing Studies sponsored the event as an
installment of their "How I Write" conversation
series.
Guttentag discussed the difference between
writing for the screen and the page. Guttentag,
who published his first novel, Boulevard, in
2010, has worked in both mediums, knowing the
demands and advantages that come with each.
In a novel, Guttentag said, one can communi
cate the contents of a person's thoughts with far
more ease and elegance than through film.
"The thing about film is that you can manipu
late time, which is really a gift," Guttentag said.
"It's the way they look at each other, how long
they hold the look before they say the line of dia
logue."
Guttentag gave the audience a glimpse at the
process by showing a page of a screenplay for his
upcoming work Knife Fight. He then treated the
audience to a brief clip from the film, which will be
released later this year.
"Screenplays have to emphasize the external
by nature," Guttentag said. "You must think,
every step of the way, about what is an actable
moment."
The writer and filmmaker also stressed the re
cursive aspect of screenwriting, noting that every
film is written three times: as a screenplay, as the

film itself and then in the editing process. There
are always aspects to fix and improve, he added.
Sometimes mistakes have proven valuable,
Guttentag said, such as when he chose not to cor
rect a historical flub in a line he wrote that was
then delivered by actress Eva Mendes, or when he
instructed his crew to intentionally let a micro
phone drop into the frame on a faux-documen
tary-style project something his veteran pro
ducer amusedly told him he had certainly never
seen before.

Guttentag also spoke extensively about the
commercial aspect of filmmaking.
"Film is a business, in addition to an art form,"
he said. "It's not called show show, it's called show
business nor is it called business business, for
that matter."

Guttentag spoke of a conversation filmed for
his recent work Nanking in which translators sud
denly cease speaking and begin to cry and said
that the entire crew soon broke down into tears.
He said his goal is to somehow capture moments
like that and then communicate them to an audi
ence in a theater.

"There's a universality to it, and that's what
you're looking for," he said.

Perhaps the most memorable moment in the
conversation was Guttentag's recollection of a
movie he had seen, which featured a talking mon
key. At one particularly clunky line, he found him
self thinking,"The monkey wouldn't say that!"
The fact that he had skipped over the impossi
bility of a monkey speaking at all was, Guttentag
said, a testament to the film's power to immerse
the viewer in a different world.
