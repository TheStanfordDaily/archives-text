## A 						FRESHMAN'S DAY OF DANCE 
### NICOLE KOFMAN 
For a full 24 hours, from 1 p.m. on Sat
urday, Feb. 11 to 1 p.m. on Sunday,
Feb. 12, the Arrillaga Alumni Cen
ter pulsated with energy and enthu
siasm as Stanford's eighth annual
Dance Marathon rocked campus all day
and all night long.
After spending months fundraising for
FACE AIDS, a student-led nonprofit com
mitted to fighting FIIV/AIDS, hundreds of
students took a literal stand for the cause and
pledged to stay on their feet for at least a por
tion of the event, if not all 24 hours.
Walking into the building for my shift, I
got a preview of the event's energy from the
welcome crew's attitudes during registration.
Their bright smiles matched their neon attire
as they signed in dancers, handing out
nametags and purple "Dancer" T-shirts to
the participants.
Inside the dance room, the enthusiasm was
contagious. Throbbing speakers flanked a
large stage, sending dance music booming
throughout the room. The beams from color
ful disco lights spun across the floor and
climbed the walls, spotlighting the cardinal red
balloons and banners made by dorms across
campus to cheer on the dancers.
Opposite the stage hung an enormous
Dance Marathon calendar, showcasing the
different holidays throughout the year that
made up the marathon's theme, "Seasons of
Love." Every three hours, the "season"
would change and dancers would receive a
bracelet to signify the amount of time they
had been dancing.
The dancers' attire reflected their high
energy. Neon tank tops, glitter spandex, pink
tutus, short shorts, knee-high socks and color
ful caps abounded. Several dancers who
stayed for the entire event even brought
enough clothes to put together different rally
outfits throughout the 24 hours.
During the first hour, I had the chance
witness a piece of the camaraderie and com
munity that would only continue to develop
during the following 23 hours. When Shaki
ra's "Waka Waka" filled the room, one at a
time we came together to learn the dance. By
the time the song ended, at least half of the
dancers were moving in sync, coordinating
our shimmies and claps with one another and
throwing our heads back at once.
As a Dance Marathon tradition, every
year the organizers choreograph a dance to a
selected song for the dancers to perform at

every "season change" that is, every three
hours. This year, participants came together
to learn a dance to Whaml's "Wake Me Up
Before You Go Go." Some dancers were so
engaged with the dance that they continued
to groove even after they were permitted to
sit down after the marathon event ended.
Though the choreographed dances were
certainly a highlight, several other moments
from the 24 hours offered breaks from the
constant movement. Talented student
groups provided entertainment throughout
the event, with not an hour going by without
some sort of encouraging performance. A
cappella groups, dance troupes and student
bands all graced the stage with their pres
ence, and the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band (LSJUMB) made a
surprise performance to get the marathoners
through their last hour. Some student groups
provided dance lessons for participants, in
cluding Los Salseros and Swing Time. Anoth
er popular event was "yoga raving," a relax
ing and reenergizing yoga session complete
with singing and a massage train.
For those who needed a break from the
loud music and endless dancing, board and
video games from Jenga to Boggle to Super
Smash Bros, to Wii Sports were on hand. For
those dedicated students who could not af
ford to give up 24 hours without studying for
upcoming midterms, the event offered tables
tall enough for student to do schoolwork
without breaking their promise to stay stand
ing. These tall tables doubled as pillows for

some dancers during the wee hours of the
morning.
While I expected there to be a significant
difference in the levels of energy in the room
between 1 p.m. on Saturday and 1 p.m. on
Sunday, I was amazed to see that the dancers
seemed to have just as much, if not more, en
ergy during their last hour of marathon-ing
than during their first.
"The Reveal," the point at which the
event organizers shared how much money
the dancers raised, took place in the last 15
minutes of the marathon. Flolding up one
digit at a time, they dramatically disclosed
that their fundraising efforts had brought in a
grand total of $60,085.97 to be donated to
Partners in Health, a nonprofit organization
that aims to deliver health and social justice
to the world's poorest communities, and Bay
Area Young Positives, a nonprofit that pro
vides support for young people with HIV.
To celebrate this feat, the dancers took
part in one more morale-dance before danc
ing to the last song, "The Final Countdown."
At exactly 1 p.m., the dancers simultaneous
ly collapsed to the floor for the first time in 24
hours, only to pop back up a few seconds
later to continue dancing this time in cele
bration.
While the dancing had come to an end,
the event proved to be the best one-night
stand of the year.

ing. These tall tables doubled as pillows for

some dancers during the wee hours of the
morning.
While I expected there to be a significant
difference in the levels of energy in the room
between 1 p.m. on Saturday and 1 p.m. on
Sunday, I was amazed to see that the dancers
seemed to have just as much, if not more, en
ergy during their last hour of marathon-ing
than during their first.
"The Reveal," the point at which the
event organizers shared how much money
the dancers raised, took place in the last 15
minutes of the marathon. Flolding up one
digit at a time, they dramatically disclosed
that their fundraising efforts had brought in a
grand total of $60,085.97 to be donated to
Partners in Health, a nonprofit organization
that aims to deliver health and social justice
to the world's poorest communities, and Bay
Area Young Positives, a nonprofit that pro
vides support for young people with HIV.
To celebrate this feat, the dancers took
part in one more morale-dance before danc
ing to the last song, "The Final Countdown."
At exactly 1 p.m., the dancers simultaneous
ly collapsed to the floor for the first time in 24
hours, only to pop back up a few seconds
later to continue dancing this time in cele
bration.
While the dancing had come to an end,
the event proved to be the best one-night
stand of the year.

Students across campus came together this weekend to participate in the eighth annual Dance Marathon, a 24-hour fundraiser.
For a full 24 hours, from 1 p.m. on Sat
urday, Feb. 11 to 1 p.m. on Sunday,
Feb. 12, the Arrillaga Alumni Cen
ter pulsated with energy and enthu
siasm as Stanford's eighth annual
Dance Marathon rocked campus all day
and all night long.
After spending months fundraising for
FACE AIDS, a student-led nonprofit com
mitted to fighting FIIV/AIDS, hundreds of
students took a literal stand for the cause and
pledged to stay on their feet for at least a por
tion of the event, if not all 24 hours.
Walking into the building for my shift, I
got a preview of the event's energy from the
welcome crew's attitudes during registration.
Their bright smiles matched their neon attire
as they signed in dancers, handing out
nametags and purple "Dancer" T-shirts to
the participants.
Inside the dance room, the enthusiasm was
contagious. Throbbing speakers flanked a
large stage, sending dance music booming
throughout the room. The beams from color
ful disco lights spun across the floor and
climbed the walls, spotlighting the cardinal red
balloons and banners made by dorms across
campus to cheer on the dancers.
Opposite the stage hung an enormous
Dance Marathon calendar, showcasing the
different holidays throughout the year that
made up the marathon's theme, "Seasons of
Love." Every three hours, the "season"
would change and dancers would receive a
bracelet to signify the amount of time they
had been dancing.
The dancers' attire reflected their high
energy. Neon tank tops, glitter spandex, pink
tutus, short shorts, knee-high socks and color
ful caps abounded. Several dancers who
stayed for the entire event even brought
enough clothes to put together different rally
outfits throughout the 24 hours.
During the first hour, I had the chance
witness a piece of the camaraderie and com
munity that would only continue to develop
during the following 23 hours. When Shaki
ra's "Waka Waka" filled the room, one at a
time we came together to learn the dance. By
the time the song ended, at least half of the
dancers were moving in sync, coordinating
our shimmies and claps with one another and
throwing our heads back at once.
As a Dance Marathon tradition, every
year the organizers choreograph a dance to a
selected song for the dancers to perform at

every "season change" that is, every three
hours. This year, participants came together
to learn a dance to Whaml's "Wake Me Up
Before You Go Go." Some dancers were so
engaged with the dance that they continued
to groove even after they were permitted to
sit down after the marathon event ended.
Though the choreographed dances were
certainly a highlight, several other moments
from the 24 hours offered breaks from the
constant movement. Talented student
groups provided entertainment throughout
the event, with not an hour going by without
some sort of encouraging performance. A
cappella groups, dance troupes and student
bands all graced the stage with their pres
ence, and the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band (LSJUMB) made a
surprise performance to get the marathoners
through their last hour. Some student groups
provided dance lessons for participants, in
cluding Los Salseros and Swing Time. Anoth
er popular event was "yoga raving," a relax
ing and reenergizing yoga session complete
with singing and a massage train.
For those who needed a break from the
loud music and endless dancing, board and
video games from Jenga to Boggle to Super
Smash Bros, to Wii Sports were on hand. For
those dedicated students who could not af
ford to give up 24 hours without studying for
upcoming midterms, the event offered tables
tall enough for student to do schoolwork
without breaking their promise to stay stand
ing. These tall tables doubled as pillows for

some dancers during the wee hours of the
morning.
