# CODING FOR A CAUSE

### NEHAN CHATOOR 
The doors of the Arrillaga Alumni
Center flew open, revealing halls
bedecked with red and white bal
loons and walls flanked by ban
ners sporting FACE AIDS in
signia.
The students, dressed in eccentric cos
tumes such as tutus and Stanford capes in a
blend of flamboyant colors, trickled into a
room thumping with electronic music.
While a huge number of students went up
to the check-in desk for Dance Marathon, a

good number went down the other end of the
hall where Code Jam, informally referred to
as the "Hackathon," was being lield.
Code Jam is a campus-wide event open to
those with coding experience. Coders volun
teer to help out with a number of program
ming projects for various nonprofit organiza
tions.
Sam King 'l2, Code Jam's director, noted
that a lack of "techie" involvement in Dance
Marathon inspired the event in the first
place.
"There were not a lot of computer scien
tists participating in Dance Marathon, and
that was probably because they wanted a

more tangible way of using their skills, so we
started within Dance Marathon as the Dance
Marathon Code Jam," King said.
"The collaboration worked really well be
cause we bring a more direct service compo
nent to Dance Marathon, and Dance
Marathon brings a lot of energy to our
event," he added.
The purpose of Code the Change's Code
Jam is to allow computer scientists to work
with non-profits in a beneficial and
unique way. Code the Change helps stu
dents accomplish this in two ways: by aiding
the nonprofits with their social change initia
tives and by raising funds for FACE AIDS

an organization dedicated to increasing
awareness about HIV/AIDS.
This year's Code Jam coded for a number
of organizations founded to improve the lives
of others, much like FACE AIDS does for the
HIV/AIDS community. For instance, a team
of four worked on developing a web-based
application for Nilsby, a non-profit that facili
tates a support system for families with spe
cial-needs children, while another team of
three coders volunteered to code for Support
ing Initiatives to Redistribute Unused Medi
cine (SIRUM), an organization that helps re
duce the supply chain gap between hospitals
with extraneous unused medicines and free
clinics that lack such supplies.
Palo Alto Mayor Yiaway Yeh and the
city's IT team were present at the event and
collaborated with Stanford students to de
velop a program which lists the streets of
Palo Alto, their conditions and the construc
tion work the city has been doing on certain
streets, along with an explanation of why this
work is needed.
Both the energetic atmosphere of Dance
Marathon and the inspiring causes for
which these students were coding encour
aged the coders during the entire 24 hours of
intense "hacking."
According to Elliot Lui'l3, leader of the
Nilsby project group, the event "[was] ex
hausting, but [we were] proud of what we
were doing."
Despite the reputation many computer
science majors have of being adept at staying
up late and pulling all-nighters, the organizers
put effort toward ensuring a good, and not
too stressful, time for the participants.
Angad Singh 'l4, project director of Code
the Change, noted that participants could
take occasional naps during the 24 hours and
were kept well-fed with an array of snacks,
chips, juice and Gatorade. In order to stay
pumped, the hackers took breaks to partici
pate in Dance Marathon, dancing to get their
blood flowing and keep their energy up for
coding.
The coders' enthusiasm and effort certain
ly did not go unnoticed outside of the Stan
ford bubble.
"It is an incredible selection of students,
and their willingness to share their skills with
all these community organizations, including
the city of Palo Alto, is inspiring," Yeh said.
"All of these organizations clearly have a
need for skills to be applied in away that has
a lot of social benefit and the students' contri
bution of their skills is completely incredible."

In conjunction with Dance Marathon, Code the Change hosted Code Jam, a 24-hour event during which students coded for nonprofits.
