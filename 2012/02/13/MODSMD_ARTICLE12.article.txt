## EDITORIAL The 						rising price of higher education 
### 
OnTuesday, Feb. 7, Stanford's
Board of Trustees an
nounced a 3 percent tuition
increase and a 3.5 percent room
and board increase for undergrad
uates. Graduate programs all saw a
similar tuition increase, with
School of Medicine tuition experi
encing the steepest rise at 3.5 per
cent. Viewed in isolation, a tuition
increase of a few percent (roughly a
thousand dollars) is not that con
cerning. At least this year, tuition
increases are roughly on par with
inflation. But consider that for the
1996-97 academic year, undergrad
uate tuition was $20,490. Now, fif
teen years later, it is almost double
that at $40,050. When adjusting for
inflation, the tuition price has gone
up more than 11,000 dollars.
Not surprisingly, when an
nouncing this year's tuition and
room and board increase, Chair of
the Board of Trustees Leslie Hume
made sure to emphasize that Stan
ford remains committed to offer

ing one of the most competitive fi
nancial aid packages in the nation.
The Daily Editorial Board ap
plauds financial aid increases for
easing the burden on many strug
gling families, making the Stanford
dream theoretically in reach for all
accepted students. However, that
fact should not excuse rising costs
that, over the years, have been sig
nificant; just above the aid cutoff,
families have to make sizable sacri
fices to pay the over $200,000 cost
for a Stanford degree. Not to men
tion that Stanford loses a portion
of accepted students to less presti
gious schools that have lower tu
ition and/or offer significant merit
scholarships.
Although tuition increases for
all colleges taken together have
risen only slightly faster than infla
tion, tuition increases in the top 20
percent of colleges have risen con
siderably. It seems that $50,000 is
becoming the norm among top
schools, and costs are only going up.

Yes, families are still apparently
willing to pay the high price. But
what other options does a high
school graduate have? The 21st
century workplace demands that
candidates have bachelor's de
grees, at minimum, to be competi
tive. Increasingly, a school's selec
tivity matters, as well. Universities
can continually raise the cost of
higher education, and families have
little alternative but to hand over
their money assuming the students
will break even on the investment.
Stanford is no exception; despite its
tuition increases, the number of ap
plications has only increased.
Top schools are caught in a vi
cious cycle to stay competitive;
each year, they must offer more
and more to attract students and
faculty, and most already spend far
more per student than the tuition
level would suggest. Stanford's
most recent tuition increase will
cover the rising costs of salaries and
health care. Were these costs to re

main constant, faculty would still
be relatively well off, but Stanford
would become a less attractive op
tion for top research talent, who
could simply choose one of Stan
ford's peer schools offering a better
package.
To attract the best students in
the face of rising tuition, Stanford
must perpetually increase its finan
cial aid packages and invest in ex
pensive new facilities and pro
grams to stay competitive. All of
this means that, to remain one of
the premier universities in the na
tion, Stanford must never regress
and must always approximately
match what its peer schools offer.
Other top schools face the same
dilemma, and these costs are being
increasingly passed on to students
and their families.
In this higher education arms
race, it is hard to see how tuition
prices can level out. To help rein in
rising costs, President Barack
Obama has recently proposed

awarding less federal funding, such
as work-study aid, to schools that
have significant tuition increases.
Some higher education experts
have criticized his plan for, among
other things, not differentiating be
tween net tuition costs (which fac
tor in financial aid) and the sticker
price.
Although his plan may be
flawed, it is correct in its assessment
that the status quo is unsustainable.
On the one hand, popular outrage
is palpable from students who can
get into the most selective schools
but have difficulty managing the in
creasing costs, even after relatively
generous financial aid. At the same
time, these schools face no shortage
of applicants, students demand
more resources and amenities from
them, and prestigious employers
reward graduates. Something
needs to be done, and the first step
is an open and honest dialogue
about how our society values an
elite college education.
