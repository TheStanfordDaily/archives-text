# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Divestment: Part I 
### Miles Unterreiner 
This is the first in a series of four
columns by the author dealing with di
vestment and the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
There's a brilliant montage in
"V for Vendetta" when In
spector Finch, the troubled
head of Scotland Yard, finally real
izes that the government he serves
is going to crumble. A premonition
of the future, interspersed with rec
ollections of the past, flashes before
his eyes fragmented visions al
most too fleeting to capture on film,
alternating flickers of memory and
augury. "I suddenly had a feeling,"
says Finch, "that it was all connect
ed. And I could see everything that
had happened ... and everything
that was going to happen. And it
was all connected."
I've started to feel much the
same premonitory dread about the
divestment question, which Stan
ford Students for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER), formerly Students
Confronting Apartheid by Israel

(SCAI), has revived again this year.
It's not hard to see what's going to
happen â€”in part because it has
happened so many times already.
SPER President Omar Shakir
will deliver an eloquent presenta
tion or two, which the same people
attend every year. The Stanford Is
rael Alliance (SIA) will once again
parade around White Plaza waving
Israeli flags and serving falafel. Par
tisans on both sides of the issue will
trade barbs in a series of op-eds in
the Daily, while a highly charged
emotional debate in the ASSU Sen
ate may or may not result in a reso
lution being passed that may or
may not have any effect on whether
the University actually divests from
any companies at all. At the end of
the day, everyone will go home hav
ing accomplished little of concrete
importance but feeling much angri
er than usual.

I would hope that we entrepre
neurial Stanford students could
come up with something better
and more innovative than that. If
there is no hope for reconciliation
here, in sunny Palo Alto, far from
the poverty-stricken streets of
Gaza and the desiccated craters of
the West Bank, among a student
body famous for its optimism and
good nature, then it is hard to see
how there can be reconciliation
anywhere.

But how? Where would we
start? How would we go about
shifting a paradigm deeply en
trenched and seemingly immov
able a diplomatic roadblock on
which political careers have
foundered and the best-laid plans
of nations gone awry?
First, reconciliation cannot
begin until each side begins to feel
the other's pain, and until both
sides agree that they find certain
things unequivocally unaccept
able, whoever the victim and who
ever the perpetrator.
Reconciliation cannot happen
unless Palestinian supporters stop
responding to Auschwitz-Birke
nau with a coldly automatic "yes,
but..." Peace cannot happen
until Palestinian supporters imag
ine themselves trapped in the slow
ly falling body of Leon Klinghof
fer, the disabled Jewish-American
shot at point-blank range and
thrown overboard from the
Achille Lauro by Palestinian ter
rorists in 1985. Peace cannot hap
pen until Palestinian supporters

imagine the nails and shrapnel
softly ripping through faces and
flesh at the Sbarro restaurant in
downtown Jerusalem on August
9th,2001, remember the babies sui
cide-bombed to pieces on the
Haifa beach in 2003 and truly think
about how it would feel to be the
child or spouse of one of the Israeli
athletes massacred at the Munich
Olympics in 1972.
But peace also cannot happen
until Israeli supporters know the
scourge of daily thirst felt by Pales
tinian children who see, from be
hind a fence, Israeli settlers drink
ing clean water on land that used to
be theirs. It cannot happen until Is
raeli supporters truly know what it
means to live under military block
ade, to huddle in squalor without
adequate food while on the other
side of a wall not far from you peo
ple live in relative comfort. Peace
cannot happen until Israel sup
porters truly feel sympathy for the
hundreds of Palestinian children
killed by Israeli fire, just as they
would for Israeli children.
In short, it all sounds hopelessly
idealistic and incredibly naive, just
another pie-in-the-sky fantasy
concocted by a foolish American.
But over the course of the next
three columns, I hope to convince
you that it can happen here, and to
offer a concrete, practical vision of
how such a movement might look.
Throughout it all, I hope very
much to hear and learn from you,
my readers. I'll listen and change
my views based on what I hear
from you.
