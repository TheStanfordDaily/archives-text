# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Divestment: Part I 
### Miles Unterreiner 
This is the first in a series of four
columns by the author dealing with di
vestment and the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
There's a brilliant montage in
"V for Vendetta" when In
spector Finch, the troubled
head of Scotland Yard, finally real
izes that the government he serves
is going to crumble. A premonition
of the future, interspersed with rec
ollections of the past, flashes before
his eyes fragmented visions al
most too fleeting to capture on film,
alternating flickers of memory and
augury. "I suddenly had a feeling,"
says Finch, "that it was all connect
ed. And I could see everything that
had happened ... and everything
that was going to happen. And it
was all connected."
I've started to feel much the
same premonitory dread about the
divestment question, which Stan
ford Students for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER), formerly Students
Confronting Apartheid by Israel

(SCAI), has revived again this year.
It's not hard to see what's going to
happen â€”in part because it has
happened so many times already.
SPER President Omar Shakir
will deliver an eloquent presenta
tion or two, which the same people
attend every year. The Stanford Is
rael Alliance (SIA) will once again
parade around White Plaza waving
Israeli flags and serving falafel. Par
tisans on both sides of the issue will
trade barbs in a series of op-eds in
the Daily, while a highly charged
emotional debate in the ASSU Sen
ate may or may not result in a reso
lution being passed that may or
may not have any effect on whether
the University actually divests from
any companies at all. At the end of
the day, everyone will go home hav
ing accomplished little of concrete
importance but feeling much angri
er than usual.
