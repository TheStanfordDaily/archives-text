# Me, my day and I
## THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION

lam at the center of most of my
problems, I've recently realized.
I'm trying not to be.
Very early in life, we started
learning phrases like "Be positive"
or "Look on the bright side." But
these isolated statements, in their
Copperplate Gothic font under
neath classroom pictures of foggy
mountains, fast became trite. They
are short and sweet, and they come
out of emotional context, which
makes them unpersuasive. They
simply aren't enough to sway the
tall psychological structures in our
heads that determine the way we
perceive our lives.
Yet we gravitate toward them,
convinced they're the best possible
coping mechanisms. We tend to
play exhausting games of forced
optimism and say bright, empty
things to other people to qualify the
difficulties we're facing. And, after
all of the drama is over, we wave it
away with "I guess it was all in my
heacf'This is how we can reminisce
on high school and mock our silly
"dramas," and then move right into
lamenting our current ones. And on
we go.
There's a subtle bit of ex post
facto pointlessness here. I don't
know if we truly expect our conven
ient, all-inclusive philosophies like
"choose happiness" and "just be
happy" to resolve any short- or
long-term dilemmas. But I've no
ticed that in this entire process of
learning how to be satisfied with
everything in life, the emphasis is al
ways on one single person and their
mind. We're constantly learning
how to have our own great days by
our own supposed mental powers.
Just me. Just you. So simple. Really?
When I was 11, my parents got
divorced, and for a while I forgot
how to live normally. Most of us

have gone through something simi
lar: an event happens, and every
thing else goes out of focus. I was
told by various people to not be so
sad, to look on the bright side, to
smile, to remember [insert buzz
word-of-choice-associated-with-
"optimistic" here]. But these ex
pressions still directed everything
back to me and my inner mental
mess (which solves few important
things on its own).
As I began earning more of my
family's trust and personal histo
ries, though, I began to see how
many other people were implicated
in an event I had assumed was ex
clusively mine. It was preposterous
to assume that all of my troubles
were, well, all of the troubles there
were. There was more, and I was
humbled. Recovery wasn't about
being "positive" about myself It
was about escaping emotional self
indulgence and considering that
there were other complications for
people beyond me to which I was
unhelpfully contributing. Years
have passed, and I'm still trying to
tone down my volatility.
Fast forward to last Friday. My
woes: little homework accom
plished, less cash in my wallet than
anticipated, annoyance that I was
tired before a ball that night, a
denser weekend than I wanted...
These aren't necessarily little con
cerns, of course; altogether, they
create the burden sustained by
many of us students. What con
cerned me most, though, was that
these thoughts, which were cen
tered completely on me, were soak
ing up the attentions of the people
around me. They gave me the spot

light and I gave them my attitude. It
wasn't that I needed to be more
positive and less negative. It was
that either way, I was all about me.
I often see my day as a pie chart,
and I feel uncomfortable knowing
that self-satisfying matters usually
color the majority of it. Yet by now,
I am quite aware of the irony
that the more I withdraw, turn in
ward and analyze my highly indi
vidual issues, the more I start self
destructing. "Self-improvement"
campaigns are my weakness: a per
sonal obsession with "healthy eat
ing" that caused my worst health is
sues, or a period of time raging self

ishly through unfair family dynam
ics that actually had little to do with
me.The world always seems like it's
ending when I forget my world is
not the world. I forget that there are
more people than me —an ex
ceedingly better place to send my
concerns.
I used to be comforted by the
fact that my life was all mine. It was
all about control and superior men
tal states and feeling great and pre
tending to be constantly upbeat.
But I would hope that there is more
that I can offer to this world than
just that. I'm sure that there's more
to the day than just feeling good
about my own day.

But to be honest, it really would make
Nina's day to hear from you. Don't be

lam at the center of most of my
problems, I've recently realized.
I'm trying not to be.
Very early in life, we started
learning phrases like "Be positive"
or "Look on the bright side." But
these isolated statements, in their
Copperplate Gothic font under
neath classroom pictures of foggy
mountains, fast became trite. They
are short and sweet, and they come
out of emotional context, which
makes them unpersuasive. They
simply aren't enough to sway the
tall psychological structures in our
heads that determine the way we
perceive our lives.
Yet we gravitate toward them,
convinced they're the best possible
coping mechanisms. We tend to
play exhausting games of forced
optimism and say bright, empty
things to other people to qualify the
difficulties we're facing. And, after
all of the drama is over, we wave it
away with "I guess it was all in my
heacf'This is how we can reminisce
on high school and mock our silly
"dramas," and then move right into
lamenting our current ones. And on
we go.
There's a subtle bit of ex post
facto pointlessness here. I don't
know if we truly expect our conven
ient, all-inclusive philosophies like
"choose happiness" and "just be
happy" to resolve any short- or
long-term dilemmas. But I've no
ticed that in this entire process of
learning how to be satisfied with
everything in life, the emphasis is al
ways on one single person and their
mind. We're constantly learning
how to have our own great days by
our own supposed mental powers.
Just me. Just you. So simple. Really?
When I was 11, my parents got
divorced, and for a while I forgot
how to live normally. Most of us

have gone through something simi
lar: an event happens, and every
thing else goes out of focus. I was
told by various people to not be so
sad, to look on the bright side, to
smile, to remember [insert buzz
word-of-choice-associated-with-
"optimistic" here]. But these ex
pressions still directed everything
back to me and my inner mental
mess (which solves few important
things on its own).
