## Baseball set to win game of numbers 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Well, I guess it's about
time we all admit
that football season
really is over. It was
another incredible
year, both in the NFL and in college.
But as sad as it makes me, we're now
over a week into our post-football
lives and over a month into the post-
Stanford football doldrums.
This means it's time for basketball
season, right? Well, yes, but with both
Stanford teams doing what they al
ways do, it's hard to find much to ana
lyze. The men's team is in the midst of
its usual conference nose-dive, losing
five of its last six to drop to the middle
of the Pac-12 before an unimpressive
win over dreadful USC yesterday.The
once-high hopes from a 10-1 start
have vanished thanks to a 7-7 stretch
that saw the Cardinal win just three
games by more than eight points
while losing six by double digits. In
stead of looking for Stanford in the
latest Bracketology, Cardinal fans are
back to looking up CBI dates.
Despite being incredibly success
ful, the women's team is equally as
predictable. Just like seemingly every
year, Stanford is running over its com
petition in the regular season with just
a lone loss to perennial nemesis Con
necticut besmirching the team's
record. The Cardinal has allowed
some teams to hang around, leading
to a staggering three games decided
by single digits. Stanford is great, and
fans of the team are incredibly
spoiled, but the fact remains that
everyone knows the Cardinal will be
one of the top seeds in the Big Dance.
You can pretty much script Stanford's
way into at least the Elite Eight, so
until then, the wins are just par for the
course.
So what is there for a Cardinal fan
to do? Well, it's Stanford, so there are
always other sports for the Cardinal to
dominate. And one of those, baseball,
starts this week. So why not check out
a few numbers, Stat on the Back-style,
to prepare you for baseball season.
13: hi 2011, head coach Mark Mar
quess' squad reached the Super Re
gionals before falling to North Caroli
na. Stanford ended the year ranked
No. 13 in the Baseball America poll.
2: This year, Stanford is expected to
surpass last season's output, as the
Cardinal is ranked in the top four in
every poll and No. 2 in the Baseball
America poll.
7: A big reason for the high expec
tations is the amount of talent return
ing to the Farm. Seven of the team's
eight starting position players from
last year returned, with just catcher
Zach Jones graduating.
79: In total, the Cardinal returns 79
percent of its at-bats, 76 percent of its
runs scored and 82 percent of its hits
from the 2011 team that hit .299. In
other words, the lineup is stacked.
8: How stacked is the lineup? Take
Saturday's Cardinal and White scrim
mage for example. In that game, the
Cardinal team was comprised of the
starters while the White team was
mostly backups. Right fielder Austin
Wilson, who hit .311 and led the team
with five home runs, was batting
eighth in the Cardinal lineup. Yes,
eighth.That's what happens when you
have speedsters Jake Stewart and
Tyler Gaffney at the top of the lineup,

followed by RBI machines Stephen
Piscotty, Brian Ragira and Kenny
Diekroeger and solid contact-hitter
Lonnie Kauppila. Let me say it again:
the lineup is stacked.
140: As mentioned before, the main
departure from the lineup is Jones,
and the hole he leaves could be a big
one. Jones has started 140 of the last
145 Stanford games behind the plate,
so the Cardinal has not developed a
clear backup for him.This year, utility
infielder Eric Smith has been moved
to catcher to compete with Christian
Griffiths who missed last year
with an injuryâ€”Trevor Penny and
Wayne Taylor, a promising freshman
who may need some more seasoning
in the field. As of now, there has not
been a clear choice for the starting
catcher job, so it will be an area to
watch throughout the season.
48: While the starting lineup is al
most all the same as in 2011, the 2012
pitching staff has had to undergo

some changes. With the departures of
Chris Reed, Jordan Pries, Danny
Sandbrink and Scott Snodgress, the
Cardinal lost 48 percent of its innings
pitched from last year's squad, not to
mention 53 percent of its strikeouts.
Pries and Sandbrink were two of the
team's top starting pitchers from last
year's squad, Snodgress was a key re
liever, and Reed was a shutdown
closer. How well Stanford can re
place them will likely determine how
far it can go in the postseason.
99: One aid to the pitching staff is
the return of left-hander Brett
Mooneyham, who missed all of last
season with a hand injury. In 2010,
Mooneyham racked up 99 strikeouts,
the most of any Stanford pitcher over
the last three seasons. If he can regain
his past form, he will form a dynamic
1-2 punch with right-hander Mark
Appel, the Friday starter who is pro
jected by many to be the No. 1 overall
pick in this year's MLB Draft.
30: The final piece of the puzzle for
any team is its schedule, because who
you play and where you play can
make all the difference. After a brutal
2011 schedule, the Cardinal can at
least make fewer travel arrange -

ments this year. Of the team's 54
games, 30 are at Sunken Diamond
(last year the Cardinal had 25), and
only three are outside the Pacific
Time Zone (the three-game set with
new conference member Utah). The
only non-conference road series is
just down the highway against Fresno
State, whereas last year Stanford
traveled to Rice, Texas and Vander
bilt.
Still, the Cardinal has to play
that same trio of highly ranked non
conference foes this year, but all will
have to travel to the Farm.The Com
modores, No. 10 in the Baseball
America poll, will have first crack at
Stanford this weekend in the season
opening series for both teams.
6/15: The College World Series be
gins on June 15 in Omaha. You might
want to start looking up flights.

Jacob Jaffe won't admit it, but he's still
in the running for the open catcher spot
after showing off his hands in a stun
ning 2011 Ink Bowl performance.
Send him some non-suggestive hand
signals for the last week of the presea
son at jwjaffe@stanford.edu and fol
