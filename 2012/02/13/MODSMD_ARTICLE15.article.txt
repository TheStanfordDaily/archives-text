## Baseball set to win game of numbers 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Well, I guess it's about
time we all admit
that football season
really is over. It was
another incredible
year, both in the NFL and in college.
But as sad as it makes me, we're now
over a week into our post-football
lives and over a month into the post-
Stanford football doldrums.
This means it's time for basketball
season, right? Well, yes, but with both
Stanford teams doing what they al
ways do, it's hard to find much to ana
lyze. The men's team is in the midst of
its usual conference nose-dive, losing
five of its last six to drop to the middle
of the Pac-12 before an unimpressive
win over dreadful USC yesterday.The
once-high hopes from a 10-1 start
have vanished thanks to a 7-7 stretch
that saw the Cardinal win just three
games by more than eight points
while losing six by double digits. In
stead of looking for Stanford in the
latest Bracketology, Cardinal fans are
back to looking up CBI dates.
Despite being incredibly success
ful, the women's team is equally as
predictable. Just like seemingly every
year, Stanford is running over its com
petition in the regular season with just
a lone loss to perennial nemesis Con
necticut besmirching the team's
record. The Cardinal has allowed
some teams to hang around, leading
to a staggering three games decided
by single digits. Stanford is great, and
fans of the team are incredibly
spoiled, but the fact remains that
everyone knows the Cardinal will be
one of the top seeds in the Big Dance.
You can pretty much script Stanford's
way into at least the Elite Eight, so
until then, the wins are just par for the
course.
So what is there for a Cardinal fan
to do? Well, it's Stanford, so there are
always other sports for the Cardinal to
dominate. And one of those, baseball,
starts this week. So why not check out
a few numbers, Stat on the Back-style,
to prepare you for baseball season.
13: hi 2011, head coach Mark Mar
quess' squad reached the Super Re
gionals before falling to North Caroli
na. Stanford ended the year ranked
No. 13 in the Baseball America poll.
2: This year, Stanford is expected to
surpass last season's output, as the
Cardinal is ranked in the top four in
every poll and No. 2 in the Baseball
America poll.
7: A big reason for the high expec
tations is the amount of talent return
ing to the Farm. Seven of the team's
eight starting position players from
last year returned, with just catcher
Zach Jones graduating.
79: In total, the Cardinal returns 79
percent of its at-bats, 76 percent of its
runs scored and 82 percent of its hits
from the 2011 team that hit .299. In
other words, the lineup is stacked.
8: How stacked is the lineup? Take
Saturday's Cardinal and White scrim
mage for example. In that game, the
Cardinal team was comprised of the
starters while the White team was
mostly backups. Right fielder Austin
Wilson, who hit .311 and led the team
with five home runs, was batting
eighth in the Cardinal lineup. Yes,
eighth.That's what happens when you
have speedsters Jake Stewart and
Tyler Gaffney at the top of the lineup,
