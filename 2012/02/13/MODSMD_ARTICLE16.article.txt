# BATTLE OF THE SISTERS
## 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team came through a tight
first half at lunch time yesterday to
soundly defeat UCLA 82-59 and
finish up a home sweep of the
Southern California schools.
It was the end of perhaps the
toughest home stand of the con
ference season for the No. 4 Car
dinal (22-1, 13-0 Pac-12), facing
teams ranked, respectively, third
and fourth in the Pac-12: the Bru
ins (12-12, 7-6) yesterday and
USC (13-11,7-6) last Thursday.
The game marked the second
time in a week that two pairs of
sisters had squared off on the
Maples hardwood; this time it was
a chance for UCLA's senior guard
Rebekah Gardner and sopho
more forward Rhema Gardner to
face off against the Ogwumikes.
The final combined performance:
44 points and 10 rebounds for
Stanford's pair versus 17 and
seven for the Bruins' siblings.
Sophomore forward Chiney Og
wumike didn't make it to her sev
enth straight double-double, but a
strong rebounding effort by jun
ior forward Joslyn Tinkle made up
for any missed boards.
The first half did not run as
smoothly as the Cardinal would
have hoped. After falling behind
on the first basket, Stanford took
early control of the game, running
out to a five-point lead with just
over five minutes gone. But the
Bruins refused to roll over, stabi
lizing the deficit reining the Cardi

nal back in.
With just over five minutes left
in the half, the Bruins took back
the lead as Stanford struggled. An
uncharacteristic turnover by sen
ior forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike that allowed UCLA sopho
more guard Thea Lemberger to
steal the ball highlighted a diffi
cult few possessions for the Cardi
nal, but Nneka quickly overcame
any distraction to take the lead
back with a fast-break layup. By
the break, Stanford had its five
point lead back.
"We knew coming in it was
going to be a big game," Tinkle
said. "And they came out of the
gun hot, they were all over us, and
we had a little bit of a lapse there
in the first half. But we caught our
selves at halftime, got that second
wind and we came out for the sec
ond half ready to take over and
push ourselves."
After the break, Stanford
stretched further ahead, and even
when UCLA managed to close
back to within seven midway
through the second half, the Car
dinal answered back with a 14-0
run that finally killed off the Bru
ins' challenge.
"Credit to Stanford," UCLA
head coach Cori Close said.
"When you let them be who they
want to be, they are the best in the
country and it was imperative for
us to force them to be something
else. If it was a pretty game, I knew
it would be in their favor. If it was
a little uglier, it would be to our
favor."
In the second half, UCLA was

also almost certainly hurt by play
ing the bulk of the game and
the Pac-12 season with just six
players. While Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer was able
to rotate her players, fatigue and
foul trouble made their mark on
the Bruins.
It wasn't just UCLA that had
problems, though. Both Chiney

Ogwumike and sophomore guard
Toni Kokenis got into early foul
trouble for Stanford, which re
duced their time on the court, and
Nneka Ogwumike had six
turnovers. VanDerveer, however,
wasn't overly concerned by these
statistics, appearing excited by

Senior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike and sister Chiney clearly outmatched the Bruins' Rebekah and Rhema Gardner, who were held to
a combined 17 points while the Ogwumikes totaled 44.
