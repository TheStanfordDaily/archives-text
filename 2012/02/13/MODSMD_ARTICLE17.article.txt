The Stanford men's basketball team was tired
of losing. Having dropped five of its last six games,
the Cardinal traveled down to USC hungry for a
win. While the Trojans put up a fight, Stanford
pulled away in the second half to emerge with a 59-
47 victory.
The Trojans (6-20, 1-12 Pac-12) have suffered
through a brutal season hindered by injuries and
were utterly outclassed by Stanford on Sunday. The
Cardinal (17-8,7-6) dominated USC in every facet of
the game, leaving no doubt as to which side would
prevail.
As a whole, the Cardinal had one of its better
shooting games in recent memory. Stanford shot 44.9
percent from the field and 40 percent from three
point range. The team also played tremendous de
fense, holding USC's leading scorer Maurice Jones
to just 10 points on 2-of-14 shooting and the team to
just 31.3 percent shooting.
Coming into the game, many expected Stanford's
big men to dominate, as injuries have reduced USC's
roster to the point that they have just one forward
and one center on the roster. The Cardinal did not
disappoint, controlling the paint for the entirety of
the game. The Trojans were out-rebounded by a
shocking 44-18 margin and mustered just one offen
sive rebound to Stanford's 12.
However, the Trojans were able to stay in the
game due to sloppy play by the Cardinal, which com
mitted 19 turnovers to USC's eight. The teams went
back and forth to start the game, with Stanford going
into the half up just two.
After the break, Stanford began to take charge.
The Cardinal scored eight unanswered points to
stretch the lead to 10. In fact, Stanford held USC
without a field goal for the first five and a half min
utes of the second hall) at which point it had taken a
commanding lead.

Freshman guard Chasson Randle led the Cardi
nal charge, dropping all 16 of his points in the second
half. The freshman shot 6-for-ll from the field and 4-
for-5 from behind the arc, continuing the hot shoot
ing he has exhibited throughout the Cardinal's road
trip to LA. Three nights earlier against UCLA, Ran
dle also had 16 points, again on 6-for-ll shooting.
Randle had a major impact on other aspects of
the game as well, notching three of the team's four
steals and committing just one turnover, proving
why he is one of the top freshmen in the Pac-12.
