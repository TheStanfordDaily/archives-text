# COUGARS TROUNCED
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team
bounced back from its miserable showing
against USC and UCLA last weekend and
secured a solid 5-2 victory over visiting
Brigham Young University. The No. 9 Car
dinal (6-2,0-0 Pac-12) handed the No. 52
Cougars (3-5) their 20th loss in 22 matches
against the Cardinal in the history of the
schools' tennis programs.
Friday afternoon's match was a back
and-forth affair that featured the Stanford
squad yet again losing the initial doubles
point in what surely is becoming a growing
concern for Head Coach John Whitlinger.
In the three doubles matches, the No. 1
team of senior Ryan Thacher and fresh
man John Morrissey continued their
strong play and provided the lone win for
the Cardinal. Courts two and three went
the way of the Cougars behind another
impressive showing from their strong
freshmen duo of Dean Ormsby and
Keaton Cullimore, who are undefeated

on the season at No. 3 doubles.
Stanford rebounded well from the dou
bles loss in singles play something the
team was unable to do in the matches
against the Southern California schools
last weekend and were quickly able to
regain control of the match. Thacher easi
ly dispatched his opponent at No. 1 singles,
dropping only four games in two sets and
setting the tone for the singles matches.
Junior Walker Kehrer, who took ad
vantage of his addition to the starting line
up with a straight-sets victory on the No. 6
court, followed up Thacher's win on the
other bookend court. With the lead now in
hand, Stanford was able to play its more
familiar role as front-runner and coasted
to victory, winning on courts three, four
and five before dropping the final match
of the day, a three-set thriller on court two
between junior Matt Kandath and BYU's
Patrick Kawka, ranked No. 106 in the
country.
Friday's win was a large improvement
