## Card gets revenge for NCAAs 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
Sometimes, all you need is a little
revenge especially against a heated
rival and there's been no better ri
valry on campus recently than the
Stanford women's tennis team and the
Florida Gators.
No. 2 Stanford (4-0,1 -0 Pac-12) had
the opportunity to play top-ranked
Florida (5-1, 0-0 SEC) this past Sun
day, trying to erase last year's heart
breaking loss in the NCAA finals
against the same team and the Car
dinal did just what it set out to do, com
ing away with a dominant 5-2 win and
momentum for the rest of the season.
The Stanford-Florida rivalry has
been heating up recently. In 2010, then
freshman Mallory Burdette clinched
Stanford's 16th national champi
onship with a 6-4, 6-7 (4), 7-5 victory
and a 4-3 overall win against the
Gators. In early 2011, Stanford was still
on top when the two teams met in the
finals of the National Team Indoors
Championships in February. Stanford
won, 4-2, with Stacey Tan clinching the
match. But Florida finally gained the
advantage when, in the finals of the
2011 NCAA tournament, Burdette
found herself on the losing side of the
clinching match, a 4-3 loss that handed
the Gators the title.
It makes sense then that fans of the
team closely watched Burdette's
match Sunday as she again faced off
against Lauren Embree of the Gators.
Clearly coming out with extra motiva
tion, Burdette dominated her oppo
nent from start to end, coming away
with a 6-1, 6-2 victory. A vocal home
crowd and Burdette's own control of
the points gave her the win.
"Honestly, I don't think I had beat
en her since I was 14 years old on clay
courts way back in the day," Burdette
said. "I've put in a lot of work on my
finishing shots, my overheads, my vol
leys and just being more aggressive in
general, and I think she didn't really
have anything to hurt me today. It was
just a matter of me executing."
Sunday's match was important for
sophomore Kristie Ahn as well, as it
was her first singles match back after a
prolonged absence due to injury. Ahn
struggled in the first set, but turned it
around in the second. In the third-set
tiebreaker, Ahn ran away with the first
four points and eventually won 10-4.
"I thought it was going to be great
at first, but it actually turned out to be
really emotional in so many ways,"
Ahn said about her return to action. "It
was remarkable though. My game has
a lot to improve on, but just in terms of
mentality, it's still there. Just remem-
