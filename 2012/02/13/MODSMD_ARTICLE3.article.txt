## Software evaluates apps for plagiarism Admissions Office uses Turnitin database on early admit essays 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions turned to computer software to
combat application fraud this past fall
when it began using Turnitin for Admis
sions to check application essays for pla
giarism. Those admitted through restric
tive early action to the Class of 2016 were
the first to have their applications submit
ted to the database, which is already being
used by approximately 100 colleges and
universities around the country.
"It's really the few that attempt to get
away with this sort of thing [plagiarism]
that should be forewarned that it's not in
their best interest," Director of Under
graduate Admissions Bob Patterson said.
"It's our expectation they're going to be
honest and open and transparent in their
application, and when they sign off that
everything is their work, that has to have
meaning."

Patterson said that while his office has
not been made aware of any instances of
plagiarism from applicants in past years, it
was "concerned there could be."
He added that the University decided
to utilize the software because of reports
in the media about higher levels of plagia
rism in applications.
"If we do see that there is plagiarism in
an application, we will definitely reach out
to the student and ask for the student's
input, and then we would make decisions
from there," he said.
The software compares submitted ad
missions documents with its extensive
database of "Internet content, subscrip
tion content and previously submitted
documents to create a comprehensive
Similarity Report," according to the Tur
nitin for Admissions website.
This Similarity Report recognizes both
word-for-word and paraphrased text
matches, which are then highlighted and
linked back to the corresponding docu
ments in the database. The Report also
gives the option of building an internal
database for all of the institution's appli
cations, as well as the option of participat

ing and submitting content to the central
Turnitin for Admissions database.
Stanford is one of only a dozen univer
sities using Turnitin for undergraduate
programs. Most admission offices cur
rently use the software to assess graduate
school applications.
Anna De Cheke Quails, director of
graduate affairs and admissions at Johns
Hopkins University, said that her office
began using the software in Sept. 2011.
According to Quails, the software is im
portant because the University requires
applicants to give complete disclosure in
their applications. If applicants don't ex
ercise that full disclosure, they are reject
ed, she said.
"Our faculty have a greater ability to
focus on applications, not authentica
tion," Quails said. "We try to safeguard
our institution and our departments from
making an inappropriate decision."
The graduate admissions office at
Johns Hopkins gives the software to vari
ous departments, which can then individu
ally decide how they wish to use it. Quails
said that while her office has heard
of anecdotal instances of the soft
ware's use, including text matches
in applications, the office needs
more data about how the plagia
rism-checking software is being
used in individual departments to
determine its functionality.
Andrew Ainslie, senior associ
ate dean at UCLA's Anderson
School of Management, said that
while faculty members have used
the software in classrooms for
many years at the graduate
school, it has only recently been
made available for admissions
use.
"Initially we used it to see what
sorts of results it would get for us,"

Ainslie said. "It seemed like a
great source of information about
people who are plagiarizing, and it
is able to verify the plagiarism."
Ainslie noted that the software
links to places from where plagia
rism is detected, such as when the
application shares a quote with
another document on the Inter
net.
"It seems like a very useful tool
to ensure that the people we allow
into the program are the right
kind of people ... It is a pretty
major offense to pass off some
one's intellectual property as your
own," Ainslie said.
"We think it is important that
students are honest in their appli
cations," Patterson said. "We just
want to make sure we are doing
everything that we can."
