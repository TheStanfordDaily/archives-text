# Dancers fundraise, fight AIDS
## 24-hour dance-a-thon raises over $60,000 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
More than 500 dancers, moralers and spectators
gathered at the Arrillaga Alumni Center over the
weekend for Stanford's eighth annual 24-hour
Dance Marathon.
The event raised $60,085.97 a nearly 7.7-
percent decline from last year's total of $65,075.50
to combat HIV/AIDS and support internation
al awareness of the disease. As in previous years,
dancers pledged to raise a target sum of $192 prior
to the event.
FACE AIDS, an organization founded in 2005
by Stanford students, previously matched funds
raised by Dance Marathon.
The event's 2011 and 2012 fundraising totals
both constitute significant drops from the 2010
high of $178,000, which Philip Tom 'l4, Dance
Marathon financial director, attributed to FACE
AIDS no longer matching Dance Marathon's
fundraising total.
Ninety percent of Dance Marathon's proceeds
will go to Partners in Health (PIH), which will use
the funds for a community health workers' pro
gram in Rwanda. $192 represents the cost of train
ing and paying a community health worker in
Rwanda for a year.
"In lots of places, $50,000 especially in
healthcare can't get you that much," Alex Cole
man 'l2, Dance Marathon's overall director, said.
"In some places like Rwanda, it is the difference
maker. It gives mothers the chance to have their
children live."
The remaining 10 percent of funds raised will
go to Bay Area Young Positives, a San Francisco
non-profit organization dedicated to serving
young people diagnosed with HIV and raising
awareness of the virus in local communities.
Approximately 300 dancers and 200
moralers, who support the dancers in three-hour
shifts registered for the event, a turnout similar
to last year. While some registrants failed to show
up at the event, event organizers commented on
participants' enthusiasm and cited particularly
strong turnouts from freshmen and Greek soci
eties.
"Those that show up actually stay," Rachel See
man 'l4, Dance Marathon's campus outreach di
rector, said. "It's really cool to see the bonding
among the group that stays from 1 p.m. to 1 p.m."
Seeman added that all funds raised go directly
to Dance Marathon's partners. Dance Marathon
was funded partially through registration fees col
lected from dancers and moralers, but largely
through ASSU special fees.
Kay Williams 'l2 emphasized the contribution
of freshmen who constituted a majority of
dancers to the event, in particular citing the ef-
