# Dancers fundraise, fight AIDS
## 24-hour dance-a-thon raises over $60,000 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
More than 500 dancers, moralers and spectators
gathered at the Arrillaga Alumni Center over the
weekend for Stanford's eighth annual 24-hour
Dance Marathon.
The event raised $60,085.97 a nearly 7.7-
percent decline from last year's total of $65,075.50
to combat HIV/AIDS and support internation
al awareness of the disease. As in previous years,
dancers pledged to raise a target sum of $192 prior
to the event.
FACE AIDS, an organization founded in 2005
by Stanford students, previously matched funds
raised by Dance Marathon.
The event's 2011 and 2012 fundraising totals
both constitute significant drops from the 2010
high of $178,000, which Philip Tom 'l4, Dance
Marathon financial director, attributed to FACE
AIDS no longer matching Dance Marathon's
fundraising total.
Ninety percent of Dance Marathon's proceeds
will go to Partners in Health (PIH), which will use
the funds for a community health workers' pro
gram in Rwanda. $192 represents the cost of train
ing and paying a community health worker in
Rwanda for a year.
"In lots of places, $50,000 especially in
healthcare can't get you that much," Alex Cole
man 'l2, Dance Marathon's overall director, said.
"In some places like Rwanda, it is the difference
maker. It gives mothers the chance to have their
children live."
The remaining 10 percent of funds raised will
go to Bay Area Young Positives, a San Francisco
non-profit organization dedicated to serving
young people diagnosed with HIV and raising
awareness of the virus in local communities.
Approximately 300 dancers and 200
moralers, who support the dancers in three-hour
shifts registered for the event, a turnout similar
to last year. While some registrants failed to show
up at the event, event organizers commented on
participants' enthusiasm and cited particularly
strong turnouts from freshmen and Greek soci
eties.
"Those that show up actually stay," Rachel See
man 'l4, Dance Marathon's campus outreach di
rector, said. "It's really cool to see the bonding
among the group that stays from 1 p.m. to 1 p.m."
Seeman added that all funds raised go directly
to Dance Marathon's partners. Dance Marathon
was funded partially through registration fees col
lected from dancers and moralers, but largely
through ASSU special fees.
Kay Williams 'l2 emphasized the contribution
of freshmen who constituted a majority of
dancers to the event, in particular citing the ef-
forts of the freshman "Morale
Committee" in mobilizing a
group of participants that the
event's upperclassmen organizers
find it harder to reach.
Differences from previous
Dance Marathons included the
introduction of a contemplation
room, which featured materials
on AIDS awareness and an
"AIDS quilt." The quilt included
sections provided by members of
the Stanford community who
have had friends or family die of
the disease.
Nineteen student groups
from DvB to the Stanford Band
as well as University adminis
trators such as Dean of Freshman
and Undergraduate Advising
Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9, sup
ported and entertained dancers
throughout the night. Dancers
were provided with snacks and
meals, as well as the presence of
paramedics in the case of any
medical issue.

Code Jam
Elsewhere in the Alumni Cen
ter, approximately 30 hackers
gathered for a 24-hour Code Jam
held at the same time as Dance
Marathon. The Code Jam shares
resources and charity partners
with Dance Marathon.
The event, now in its fourth
year and organized by Code the
Change, tasks participating hack
ers with programming for a num
ber of non-profit organizations,
with an emphasis on projects eas
ily accomplishable within the 24-
hour time frame. Coding tasks
range from web development and
web applications to specialized
projects such as a collaboration
with a Ugandan university on
agricultural tracking.
Sam King 'l2, Code Jam's di
rector, acknowledged that this
year's turnout was significantly
lower than last year's high of 65
participants, but attributed the
drop to Code the Change's deci

sion to put on two events per
quarter.

King approximated that the
scheduling change would lead to
a tripling in overall participant
numbers without much addition
al cost or planning and the ability
to scale the event to other schools.

"The reason we decided to
step it up is that there was such a
compelling demand for computer
scientists who wanted to use their
skills for social change — and
also from non-profits who need
ed technical help," King said.
In addition to raising around
$10,000 from corporate partners,
King pointed to the scarce nature
of computer scientists — and the
market price of their work — as
evidence of the value added by
events such as the Code Jam. He
added that such events bring is
sues of social justice to computer
science.
"Computer scientists need
someone to show them the con
nection with social change," King
said. "We need to get rid of the
stereotypes and show people that
it's about making the world a bet
ter place."

sion to put on two events per
quarter.

King approximated that the
scheduling change would lead to
a tripling in overall participant
numbers without much addition
al cost or planning and the ability
to scale the event to other schools.

"The reason we decided to
step it up is that there was such a
compelling demand for computer
scientists who wanted to use their
skills for social change — and
also from non-profits who need
ed technical help," King said.
In addition to raising around
$10,000 from corporate partners,
King pointed to the scarce nature
of computer scientists — and the
market price of their work — as
evidence of the value added by
events such as the Code Jam. He
added that such events bring is
sues of social justice to computer
science.
"Computer scientists need
someone to show them the con
nection with social change," King
said. "We need to get rid of the
stereotypes and show people that
it's about making the world a bet
ter place."

More than 500 dancers, moralers and spectators
gathered at the Arrillaga Alumni Center over the
weekend for Stanford's eighth annual 24-hour
Dance Marathon.
The event raised $60,085.97 a nearly 7.7-
percent decline from last year's total of $65,075.50
to combat HIV/AIDS and support internation
al awareness of the disease. As in previous years,
dancers pledged to raise a target sum of $192 prior
to the event.
FACE AIDS, an organization founded in 2005
by Stanford students, previously matched funds
raised by Dance Marathon.
The event's 2011 and 2012 fundraising totals
both constitute significant drops from the 2010
high of $178,000, which Philip Tom 'l4, Dance
Marathon financial director, attributed to FACE
AIDS no longer matching Dance Marathon's
fundraising total.
Ninety percent of Dance Marathon's proceeds
will go to Partners in Health (PIH), which will use
the funds for a community health workers' pro
gram in Rwanda. $192 represents the cost of train
ing and paying a community health worker in
Rwanda for a year.
"In lots of places, $50,000 especially in
healthcare can't get you that much," Alex Cole
man 'l2, Dance Marathon's overall director, said.
"In some places like Rwanda, it is the difference
maker. It gives mothers the chance to have their
children live."
The remaining 10 percent of funds raised will
go to Bay Area Young Positives, a San Francisco
non-profit organization dedicated to serving
young people diagnosed with HIV and raising
awareness of the virus in local communities.
Approximately 300 dancers and 200
moralers, who support the dancers in three-hour
shifts registered for the event, a turnout similar
to last year. While some registrants failed to show
up at the event, event organizers commented on
participants' enthusiasm and cited particularly
strong turnouts from freshmen and Greek soci
eties.
"Those that show up actually stay," Rachel See
man 'l4, Dance Marathon's campus outreach di
rector, said. "It's really cool to see the bonding
among the group that stays from 1 p.m. to 1 p.m."
Seeman added that all funds raised go directly
to Dance Marathon's partners. Dance Marathon
was funded partially through registration fees col
lected from dancers and moralers, but largely
through ASSU special fees.
Kay Williams 'l2 emphasized the contribution
of freshmen who constituted a majority of
dancers to the event, in particular citing the ef-
forts of the freshman "Morale
Committee" in mobilizing a
group of participants that the
event's upperclassmen organizers
find it harder to reach.
Differences from previous
Dance Marathons included the
introduction of a contemplation
room, which featured materials
on AIDS awareness and an
"AIDS quilt." The quilt included
sections provided by members of
the Stanford community who
have had friends or family die of
the disease.
Nineteen student groups
from DvB to the Stanford Band
as well as University adminis
trators such as Dean of Freshman
and Undergraduate Advising
Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9, sup
ported and entertained dancers
throughout the night. Dancers
were provided with snacks and
meals, as well as the presence of
paramedics in the case of any
medical issue.

Code Jam
Elsewhere in the Alumni Cen
ter, approximately 30 hackers
gathered for a 24-hour Code Jam
held at the same time as Dance
Marathon. The Code Jam shares
resources and charity partners
with Dance Marathon.
The event, now in its fourth
year and organized by Code the
Change, tasks participating hack
ers with programming for a num
ber of non-profit organizations,
with an emphasis on projects eas
ily accomplishable within the 24-
hour time frame. Coding tasks
range from web development and
web applications to specialized
projects such as a collaboration
with a Ugandan university on
agricultural tracking.
Sam King 'l2, Code Jam's di
rector, acknowledged that this
year's turnout was significantly
lower than last year's high of 65
participants, but attributed the
drop to Code the Change's deci

sion to put on two events per
quarter.

King approximated that the
scheduling change would lead to
a tripling in overall participant
