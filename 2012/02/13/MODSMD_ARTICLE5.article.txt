## Girls able to rewire brain to prevent depression, study finds 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF Alice Phillips 
A study by the Stanford Psychology Department has
shown that girls' brains can be rewired to not overreact to
negative stimulation, thus preventing at-risk girls from ex
periencing depressive episodes, according to a Thursday
press release. Negative stimulation can cause increased
heart rate, blood pressure and Cortisol production, which
are all factors that can precede a depressive episode.
The research team, led by professor lan Gotlib and
funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, fo
cused on 10- to 14-year-old girls who at-risk for depres
sion because their mothers are depressed or have previ
ously been depressed.
Tlie girls underwent functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) at the Richard M. Lucas Center for Imag
ing, so that the researchers could observe how much blood
flowed to the amygdala region of their brains when they
were shown negative images for example, a photo of an
accident.
The researchers then asked the girls to think about
positive experiences in order to attempt to dampen the
negative response, such as going to the beach or playing
with pets.
Participants also completed a "dot-probe task" in
which they were shown one of two pairs of faces: a neutral
and happy face pair or a neutral
and sad face pair. A dot appeared
on the computer screen, which the
participant then clicked. After
clicking, she was led from the neg
ative toward the more positive
image in order to train the brain
to not overreact to negative stim
uli, according to the press release.
Days after the experiments,
the girls returned to the Stanford
Mood and Anxiety Disorders
Laboratory to undergo an in
duced stress test so that the re
searchers could measure any
change in physiological reaction.
Thus far, the researchers have
found that girls react less to stress
following the experiments.
