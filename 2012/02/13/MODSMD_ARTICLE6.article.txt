## Administrators await effects of Obama plans 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
The Offices of Undergraduate Ad
mission and Financial Aid are waiting
to see what impact two national higher
education initiatives, set forth by Presi
dent Barack Obama in his Jan. 24 State
of the Union address, will have on the
University. University officials inter
viewed by The Daily, however, said they
are confident Stanford is already meet
ing most, if not all, of the recommenda
tions that the government may make.
Obama proposed that all colleges
be required to compile a uniform "col
lege scorecard" to provide students
with information such as the cost of at
tendance, average loan debt, ability to
repay student loans and graduation
rate. He also proposed changing how
federal financial aid is awarded so that
more aid would go to schools that ac
tively attempt to keep costs down.
Karen Cooper, director of financial
aid at Stanford, said that the University
already shares much of the information
about its financial aid program that
would be included in the proposed col
lege scorecard.
"We hope that [prospective stu

dents] know all about our financial aid
program when they're applying,"
Cooper said.
To give students a concrete idea of
how much financial aid they can expect
to receive from Stanford, the Universi
ty created a financial aid calculator on
the office's website, which Cooper said
gets more than 10,000 hits per month.
"It's not just about meeting federal
expectations," said Richard Shaw, dean
of Undergraduate Admission. "We've
had our calculator for a long time be
fore these new federal guidelines were
announced."
According to Shaw, Stanford has
been trying to implement measures
similar to the President's plan for quite
some time.
"We think we've been out ahead of
the curve," he said.
"To be honest, we're one of the most
transparent universities, and we've al
ways been transparent," Shaw added.
The University does not know ex
actly what information will be required
as part of the scorecard, but both Shaw
and Cooper said they are optimistic
that Stanford will not have to drastical
ly change its practices.
"We don't know exactly [what the

new requirements will be]... we're in
a period of watchful waiting," Cooper
said.
She said she is not concerned about
the President's second proposal to di
rect financial aid to schools that make
concerted efforts to lower their tuition
costs.
"Stanford is an expensive school,
but on the whole because of our gener
ous financial aid, [tuition] is typically
not a factor in students' ... decisions
[of whether or not to attend Stanford],"
she added.
"We think, certainly from our van
tage point, that Stanford is a model in
its opportunities given to low-income
students," Shaw said.
For the moment, the University is
waiting for the President's administra
tion to issue concrete guidelines about
what exactly this new program will en
tail.
"Even though we have a high tu
ition rate, Stanford is affordable for our
families," Cooper said. "We're just
waiting to see what the federal concept
of'affordability' is."
