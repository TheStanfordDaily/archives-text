# Researchers find Viagra may cure rare pediatric lymphatic disease

### DAILY NEWS STAFF Jordan Shapiro 
Researchers at the Stanford
School of Medicine and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital may
have discovered a surprising cure
for a rare lymphatic condition in
children, according to a School of
Medicine press release. The silde
nafil drug, commonly known as
Viagra, has shown potential to
cure these malformations and is
the subject of a new clinical trial at
the School of Medicine and
Packard Children's Hospital.
Lymphangiomas "are over
growths of the one-way lymph
channels that return extra fluid
from our tissues to the blood
stream," read the School of Medi
cine press release. "Rarely, in in
fants and children, these channels
grow abnormally large and cause
deformity and death."
While lymphangiomas are
mainly cosmetic, the risk that the
lymphangiomas could interfere
with organs such as the heart,
lungs and throats necessitates
medical action. Physicians no
ticed five months ago that silde
nafil, which was being used as a

blood pressure medication, also
had surprising affects on lymphat
ic malformations.
"There has been no medical
treatment for lymphangiomas;
now all of the sudden there may
be one," A1 Lane, a physician in
vestigating the correlation, said in
the press release. While the func
tion of the drug in treating derma
tological illness is still unknown,
Lane said he suspects that it might
help to drain the channels of the
lymphatic system.
While Viagra is most common
ly used to treat erectile dysfunc
tion, previous use of the drug to
treat pulmonary hypertension in
children reveals possible side ef
fects, including nausea, headaches
and, in a few rare cases, sponta
neous erections.
As of yet, the research team
has treated three cases of lym
phangioma, which have been doc
umented and published in the
New England Journal of Medi
cine. Before they start routinely
treating patients, however, the re
searchers will need to secure
proper U.S. Food and Drug Ad
ministration approval through a
placebo-controlled trial.
