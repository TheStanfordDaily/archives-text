# Inter-dorm water conservation competition kicks off
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Jordan Shapiro 
Florence Moore (FloMo) resi
dence halls kicked off Stanford
Water Wars, an inter-dorm water
conservation competition, Sun
day. Each hall's water consump
tion will be measured from Feb.
12 to March 12 through an
Aquacue Barnacle, a water man
agement product that claims to
record the amount of water used
with at least 99.5 percent accura
cy.
The over 450 undergraduates
living in FloMo will participate in
the month-long event, sponsored
by Stanford's Green Living
Council (GLC), Student Housing
and the Silicon Valley company
Aquacue. A similar competition
at the University of California-
Merced showed promising re
sults; students reduced their water

consumption by 14 percent and
saved 89,000 gallons of water
overall.
The winning residence hall in
FloMo will receive $l,OOO in prize
money.
The GLC, founded in 2007, se
lected Aquacue's products as the
basis of this year's competition in
order to bring a more modern,
technical approach to conserva
tion on campus, according to a
GLC press release. Students will
have access throughout the
month to real-time data covering
the water use in their dorms. Si
multaneously, the GLC will host
multiple events to educate the
residents about daily conserva
tion techniques and the impor
tance of water conservation.

The seven residence halls,
which were specifically selected
because FloMo dorms have sepa
rate water lines, will compete in
six groups to determine which
dorm can save the most water per
capita. Paloma and Mirlo resi
dents will compete together due
to the fact that they share a water

meter.
FloMo Water Wars is part one
of a two-part Stanford Conserva
tion Cup hosted by the GLC. Part
two will be an electricity conser
vation effort running March 2 to
March 23.
