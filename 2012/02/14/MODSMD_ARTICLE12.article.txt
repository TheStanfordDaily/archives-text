## VOLUNTEERS PLANT OAK TREES ON THE DISH TO FILL AGE GAP POPULATION REGENERATION 
### PINNAREE TEA-MANGKORNPAN 
David Schrom was running on the
foothills at the Stanford Dish when he
noticed something disconcerting. There
was an age gap between the oak trees
on the Dish only very young and
very old oaks were growing. He started to fix the
problem using what he called "a guerilla tree-plant
ing thing."
"I started to plant acorns in little cages, and the
cow came in and tore all those little cages," Schrom
said. "So then I took fence post and barbed wire up
there ... and got caught doing that."
Around the same time, John Hunter Thomas
M.A. '49 Ph.D. '59, professor of biology, was doing
work on the flora of surrounding areas. Thomas
and his students became interested in Schrom's
project.
Schrom, a swim instructor at the time, talked to
the students about the oaks. They decided to hire a
consultant, who, after studying the foothills, sup
ported Schrom's claims that the trees needed to be
replanted. In 1984, Schrom signed a contract with
Stanford and started "Planting for the Second
Hundred Years."
The project is run by Magic, a nonprofit corpora
tion Schrom co-founded in 1979. Magic's members
practice valuescience science applied to shed
light on questions of value, such as cooperation,
healthy living, protecting the environment and the
betterment of humankind.
Planting oaks is a sophisticated process. Aside
from digging a hole in the ground and putting the tree
in it, planters also need to build berms to prevent
water from flowing away since the oaks are planted
on a slope. Planters place protection, such as steel
bars and wire mesh, around a newly planted oak to
protect it from animals. Volunteers also place mulch
over the soil to retain moisture, reduce erosion, pro
vide nutrients and prevent weed growth and seed
germination. The volunteers plant two species of
oaks live oak and valley oak to increase the
survival rate.
A planting session usually lasts three hours. Last

December, Magic called for volunteers from 10 a.m.
until 1 p.m.
"A lot of people hung on and pitched in extra
work to make sure that it got finished up," said vol
unteer Chris Quartetti '9B.
During winter and spring, Magic and its volun
teers make sure that the tree protection remains in
place. They clear the weeds and renew the mulch.
From May to October they hold watering sessions,
when volunteers water the oaks to help them survive
the dry weather.
For the first two years, volunteers water the trees
every week. In the third year, watering sessions take
place every other week. Trees that have been in the
ground for four years or more get watered once a
month during winter and spring, and three times
during the summer.
Each watering session takes about an hour.
Magic has a regular group of volunteers but invites
Stanford community members to commit to one
hour watering sessions at any time.
Magic has planted more than 2,000 oaks, of which
1,000 have survived.
"In the early years, we were just learning,"
Schrom said. "We were among the first people in the
state to actively engage in regeneration of oaks."
Now, according to Quartetti, the oaks' survival
rate is 90 percent. Other comparable projects have
an average survival rate of 40 percent.
"The difference is that we really take care and put
in all these precautions and protections," Quartetti
said.
Schrom thinks of the project as a communal ef
fort. He is "primarily concerned with the heads and
the hearts of people who come out there," he said,
and hopes that they reconnect with other people and
the landscape itself.
"[We wanted volunteers] to get the sense that
they're part of something bigger," Schrom said.
"There's possibility in working together to achieve
things that seem daunting, but if we all pitch in, may
be quite attainable."
