While Freshman Sophomore College
(FroSoCo) may be known on cam
pus for its quiet and studious envi
ronment, on one evening every
quarter, FroSoCafe brings lively
discussion in a special format to the West Campus
dorm.
Hosted by Nadeem Hussain, dean of FroSoCo, at
his residence, FroSoCafe brings students together to
discuss a variety of intellectual and personal issues
at five to six cafe tables, each with its own unique
discussion topic.
A host, or "intellectual DJ," sits at each table,
briefing new participants on the prior discussions.
This allows newcomers to quickly build upon the
ideas previously developed.
After about a half hour of discussion at a table,
participants move to a different table to explore a
new topic.
Questions considered by participants at the Oct.
21 FroSoCafe included "Can science ever inform
moral questions?" and "How do you feel about the
'duck syndrome' that you observe around you?"
Participants also debated more personal ques
tions such as, "Who inspires you?" and practical
questions, such as, "Is Stanford worth the cost?"
Jay Patel '14 created and implemented the idea
of FroSoCafe, drawing on European and interna
tional educational models that strongly support stu
dents to cultivate the self.
Sukrit Narula '14 and Sumat Lam '14 teamed up
with Patel to bring his idea to fruition.
Patel wanted to provide a forum to discuss topics
beyond students' usual comfort zones in a non-judg
mental and calm atmosphere. He said he sees the
discussions as a means of bonding the participants
to form a tighter, more collaborative Stanford com
munity. According to Patel, students can formulate
their most original thoughts through informal con
versation and communication.

"With Frosocafe, the ultimate goal is to just bring
the community together," Narula said. "This event is
an embodiment of the idea that the whole is greater
than the sum of its parts. Considering the opportu
nity that we have ... being at Stanford, where the
sum of those individual parts is very large already,
we figured that we were doing our part for the com
munity by bringing those parts together."
"FroSoCo-ans" have responded positively to the
idea. Students described the fourth FroSoCafe on
Jan. 20 as "invigorating," "stimulating," "relaxing,"
"fun" and "deeply interesting."
"Perhaps of all its little quirks, I enjoy Stanford
most for those spontaneous opportunities to share
late-night conversations with roommates and
neighbors from all manner of subjects practical
philosophy, religion, Star Wars, entrepreneurship in
Africa and music," said Justin Lee 'l5.
"FroSoCafe is a glorious dorm-sponsored exten
sion of this fun with an engaging structure, delec
table munchies and a soothing ambiance that per
fectly complements the intellectual fire," he added.
Some residents, however, would like to see more
sophomore involvement in FroSoCafe.
"Being an event geared towards both freshmen
and sophomores, FroSoCafe could better integrate
sophomores to fully unlock its potential," said Sha
hab Fadavi 'l5.
In addition to inspiring high-minded intellectual
discussions during FroSoCafe, the program has the
potential to affect the dorm's regular culture, said
one attendee.
"Giving people space to express themselves can
be a norm we set," said Kelsie Pombo 'l2.
Looking to the future, FroSoCafe's main goal is
to spawn similar discussion events in other dorms
around campus.
According to Patel, spreading and sharing in
sights with the rest of the Stanford community in a
grand mix of ideas could unite international and
American students, as well as the east and west sides
of campus.
