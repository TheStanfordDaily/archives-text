# FROM FARM TO FORK
## Wintertime wonderings 
### Jenny Rempel 
Every Saturday morning I
wake up to a "Weekly
Kitchen Digest" email,
which is an update of what fresh
produce my house of 50 will be en
joying for the week. Sent by the
student kitchen managers at Syn
ergy, a cooperative house, these
emails tend to tickle my imagina
tion with opportunities for the next
week of chopping, steaming,
sauteing and eating. This past Sat
urday, the list featured co-op sta
ples like kale and carrots, winter
time citrus treats, a few Fuji apples
that have likely been in cold stor
age since fall and an array of pro
duce items that, though they tin
gled my taste buds, left me wary
about their origins.
I love bananas and strawberries
like no other, and I have been
known to eat whole cartons of
blueberries in one sitting. But
sadly, my inner local foodie knows
that even if it feels like summer
time outside, these fruits have trav
eled many miles to reach my
mouth in the dead of winter.
For example, this week's ba
nanas are organic fruits sourced
from Mexico and Central Ameri
ca. On the one hand, their fair
trade certification gives me some
reassurance that the plantation
workers who helped grow these
fruits were not mistreated in the
production process. Still, each ba
nana emits, on average, 80 grams of
CO2 due to travel costs and the
fossil fuels invested in production.
These conflicting tidbits of infor
mation garnered from classes at
Stanford, a fixation on food poli
tics and an obsession with environ
mental justice can make choos
ing what to eat a rather complicat
ed process.
Every time I decide what to fix
myself for lunch, I am confronted
by a series of similar dilemmas. For
instance, the strawberries this
week are from Natural Choice
Foods, which means they're certi
fied organic berries from Oxnard,
Calif. Though they've traveled a
shorter distance than the bananas,
and the company doesn't use the
pesticides associated with conven
tional berry production, the straw
berry industry still has a record of
labor and safety concerns. And
what does the company mean by
"natural" foods? Do I want to as
sume the "organic" label meets my
personal standards for sustainable
food?

I simply do not have the time or
the resources to answer each of
these questions before every meal.
Sometimes it seems like the
more I learn about food, the less I
feel qualified to make educated
decisions about what I'm choosing
to eat. But even if my knowledge of
the environmental, health and so
cial-justice implications of food
can be overwhelming, I still believe
that an informed decision is much
better than an uninformed one. In
order to facilitate decision-making
in complex, interdisciplinary sys
tems with limited information, we
need a set of basic guidelines with
in which to operate.
Begin by considering what
qualities of food matter the most to
you. Being indecisive, I still try to
seek out foods with positive envi
ronmental, health and social-jus
tice implications. Though there are
many problems associated with
the organic label, it provides me
with an easy way of guaranteeing
that certain basic environmental
and labor concerns are being ad
dressed.
Next, allow yourself some wig
gle room, because you can't always
be perfect. My eating behaviors
have changed drastically since the
days when my doctor-mother and
nurse-father dubbed me the "car
nivorous queen" of the family.
Now I try to build 70 to 80 percent
of my diet around locally sourced
vegetarian meals, ideally based
from whole food ingredients (bulk
grains like quinoa and brown rice,
dried beans, fresh produce). This
gives me the flexibility to munch
on frozen blueberries, splurge on
chocolate peanut butter ice cream
and eat locally sourced meat on oc
casion.
Finally, accept that your food
choices will probably differ from
those of others. I know that my diet
is not the "best" or "right" one.
Some of my friends urge me to
consider veganism, while others
espouse the health benefits of pro
tein-rich, lean meats. One friend
can hardly let a week pass without
tomatoes, even if all he can find in
February are, understandably, fla
vorless, rusty-colored rocks flown
in from Latin America. For the
most part, I respect each of my
friends' food choices. I don't neces
sarily agree with them, but I am
proud that they are at least making
informed decisions about their
meals.

It can be draining to contem
plate the broad-ranging implica
tions of every food we eat, but it is
important to consider the environ
mental, health and social-justice
ramifications of our eating behav
iors. I'm not advocating decision
fatigue over whether you should
reach for the strawberries or the
tangerines, but it is important to re
flect on the fact that what we
choose to eat every day has impli
cations that stretch far beyond our
individual waistlines.

Think you can teach the carnivo
rous queen a thing or two about
food choices? Let Jenny know your
suggestions by emailing her at jrem
