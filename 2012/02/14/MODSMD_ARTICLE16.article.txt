# HALF INVENTED
## Dismantle. Repair. 
### Chase Ishii 
I've heard it said that there are
essentially two types of stories:
a stranger coming to town, and
a person leaving their home on a
voyage of discovery.
In the former, the main char
acter's familiar world is shaken
and disturbed by "an outsider" to
such an alarming degree that re
turning to the status quo is no
longer possible for example,
the movie "Footloose." (I think. I
haven't actually seen "Foot
loose." Though I have seen the
scene in "Hot Rod" where Andy
Samberg angry-dances in the
woods, which I hear is an allusion
to "Footloose." I also danced to
the song "Footloose" in an 'Bos
musical in high school. And by
danced, I mean violently hip
thrusted behind everyone else
the entire song.)
The latter is an adventure
story. The main character leaves
home and must adapt and expand
his or her worldview according to
fascinatingly bizarre new interac
tions and discoveries for ex
ample, in "Alice in Wonderland,"
"Candide" or "The Odyssey" (at
least according to Spark Notes ...
just kidding, Honor Code). While
both stories follow a character's
changes and challenges, I feel the
latter heavily embodies the col
lege experience.
A lot can happen away from
home, away from familiarity and
security. The people around you
don't behave the same way, share
the same beliefs or value the
same things as the world to which
you once belonged. It is a fasci
nating new world to freely ex
plore or a menacing unknown to
fear at every turn. In this sense,
we are all nomads, pilgrims and
wanderers, all on a voyage of dis
covery.
But the more important dis
coveries to be made and tensions
to be tamed are completely inter
nal. It is the voyage of self-discov
ery. Only when we've "left home"
and divorced ourselves from the
influences and expectations of our
friends, family and familiarity can
we confidently distinguish where
their perceptions of us stop and
where we truly begin. Is this really
what I believe, or is this just what
I've always been taught and ex
pected to believe? Is this actually
what I want to do with my life or
just what my parents expect of
me? Is it wrong of me to think
Dubstep has no redeeming quali
ties? These are questions that
don't have simple answers (except
the last one, which is not just a de
finitive, resounding "no," but also
includes a "shame on you for even
second-guessing" wag of the fin
ger.)
If we treat this time in college,
our first independent steps into the
real world, as an adventure, an ex
ploration of identity and self
awareness, we gain a freedom and
forgiveness incompatible with the
stepping-stone-to-success mentali
ty. In the success framework, a test
failed or an opportunity blown is
unforgiveable. You can't get it
back, and there's no redeemable
outlook. But there are no wrong
turns in an adventure. There are
dangers, setbacks and complica
tions, but if you are seeking experi
ences that reveal who you are and
who you want to be, every situa
tion is a stepping stone. There is

grace and redemption at every
turn.
This doesn't promise or imply
that life will always be enjoyable.
Adventures often include long
treks across scorching deserts,
over blistering mountains and
through shadowed valleys. Hon
est introspection can easily lead
to feelings of frustration, shame,
inadequacy, bitterness or help
lessness. But entering into this
dangerous vulnerability is where
we truly find ourselves, who we
are deep down to the core.
It's about this time every quar
ter when I begin to feel extreme
ly restless, like Stanford is the last
place I want to be, (Dan Camp
bell would say, "I'm not sad any
more, I'm just tired of this place.")
But as I learned last year, after
spending a month at home and
then three months halfway across
the world, the restlessness really
had nothing to do with where I
was but rather how I was. I had to
peel back layer after layer of ugly
truth about myself to reach the
dark heart of the matter a lot
of unresolved bitterness. Only in
comprehending the extent of how
easily my actions could be guided
by pride and resentment could I
truly understand the necessity of
forgiveness, humility and honesty
in the person I wanted to be.
The voyage of self-discovery
constantly requires effort and in
tentionality, with many ups-and
downs, but it is an adventure
nonetheless. We must dismantle
to repair.

violently hip-thrust to "Footloose"

you once belonged. It is a fasci
nating new world to freely ex
plore or a menacing unknown to
fear at every turn. In this sense,
we are all nomads, pilgrims and
wanderers, all on a voyage of dis
covery.
But the more important dis
coveries to be made and tensions
to be tamed are completely inter
nal. It is the voyage of self-discov
ery. Only when we've "left home"
and divorced ourselves from the
influences and expectations of our
friends, family and familiarity can
we confidently distinguish where
their perceptions of us stop and
where we truly begin. Is this really
what I believe, or is this just what
I've always been taught and ex
pected to believe? Is this actually
what I want to do with my life or
just what my parents expect of
me? Is it wrong of me to think
Dubstep has no redeeming quali
ties? These are questions that
don't have simple answers (except
the last one, which is not just a de
finitive, resounding "no," but also
includes a "shame on you for even
second-guessing" wag of the fin
ger.)
If we treat this time in college,
our first independent steps into the
real world, as an adventure, an ex
ploration of identity and self
awareness, we gain a freedom and
forgiveness incompatible with the
stepping-stone-to-success mentali
ty. In the success framework, a test
failed or an opportunity blown is
unforgiveable. You can't get it
back, and there's no redeemable
outlook. But there are no wrong
turns in an adventure. There are
dangers, setbacks and complica
tions, but if you are seeking experi
ences that reveal who you are and
who you want to be, every situa
tion is a stepping stone. There is

grace and redemption at every
turn.
This doesn't promise or imply
that life will always be enjoyable.
Adventures often include long
treks across scorching deserts,
over blistering mountains and
through shadowed valleys. Hon
est introspection can easily lead
to feelings of frustration, shame,
inadequacy, bitterness or help
lessness. But entering into this
dangerous vulnerability is where
we truly find ourselves, who we
are deep down to the core.
It's about this time every quar
ter when I begin to feel extreme
ly restless, like Stanford is the last
place I want to be, (Dan Camp
bell would say, "I'm not sad any
more, I'm just tired of this place.")
But as I learned last year, after
spending a month at home and
then three months halfway across
the world, the restlessness really
had nothing to do with where I
was but rather how I was. I had to
peel back layer after layer of ugly
truth about myself to reach the
dark heart of the matter a lot
of unresolved bitterness. Only in
comprehending the extent of how
easily my actions could be guided
by pride and resentment could I
truly understand the necessity of
forgiveness, humility and honesty
in the person I wanted to be.
The voyage of self-discovery
constantly requires effort and in
tentionality, with many ups-and
downs, but it is an adventure
nonetheless. We must dismantle
to repair.

There are no
wrong turns in an
adventure. There
are dangers,
setbacks and
complications,
but every
situation is a
stepping stone.

I've heard it said that there are
essentially two types of stories:
a stranger coming to town, and
a person leaving their home on a
voyage of discovery.
In the former, the main char
acter's familiar world is shaken
and disturbed by "an outsider" to
such an alarming degree that re
turning to the status quo is no
longer possible for example,
the movie "Footloose." (I think. I
haven't actually seen "Foot
loose." Though I have seen the
scene in "Hot Rod" where Andy
Samberg angry-dances in the
woods, which I hear is an allusion
to "Footloose." I also danced to
the song "Footloose" in an 'Bos
musical in high school. And by
danced, I mean violently hip
thrusted behind everyone else
the entire song.)
The latter is an adventure
story. The main character leaves
home and must adapt and expand
his or her worldview according to
fascinatingly bizarre new interac
tions and discoveries for ex
ample, in "Alice in Wonderland,"
"Candide" or "The Odyssey" (at
least according to Spark Notes ...
just kidding, Honor Code). While
both stories follow a character's
changes and challenges, I feel the
latter heavily embodies the col
lege experience.
A lot can happen away from
home, away from familiarity and
security. The people around you
don't behave the same way, share
the same beliefs or value the
same things as the world to which
you once belonged. It is a fasci
nating new world to freely ex
plore or a menacing unknown to
fear at every turn. In this sense,
we are all nomads, pilgrims and
wanderers, all on a voyage of dis
covery.
