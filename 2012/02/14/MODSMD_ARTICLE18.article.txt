## FIVE-SET THRILLER 
### JACK BLANCHAT ZACH ZIMMERMAN 
Long Beach State's Walter
Pyramid, the eighth wonder of
the collegiate world, had been
anything but wonderful to the
Stanford men's volleyball team
in recent visits. On Friday, the
Cardinal took in the architectur
al anomaly with winning spirit.

No. 4 Stanford (9-2, 6-1
MPSF) eked out a five-set victo
ry in one of the nation's most
thrilling sagas, beating the No. 4
49ers 18-25, 25-17, 22-25, 25-20,
15-12. The victory snapped the
Card's three-match losing streak
to Long Beach State and contin
ued Stanford's recent domi
nance.
Stanford coach John Kotsy
was impressed by his team's per
formance, particularly those of
his middle blockers, Eric Mochal
ski and Gus Ellis. The two com
bined for 16 kills on .625 hitting, a
phenomenal line symbolic of a
careful team effort.
"It was an indication of our
passing," Kotsy said. "When the
middles hit at a high percentage, it
means we're passing pretty well."
Senior Brad Lawson added a
team season-high 21 kills for the
Cardinal, who battled back from
a 2-1 deficit to grab a crucial road
win. Sophomores Steven Irvin
and Brian Cook joined Lawson
in the double-digit-kills club,
adding 15 and 10, respectively.
The win was the fifth in a row
for the Cardinal, but the team

went into instant-recovery mode
in preparation for another tough
road test less than a day later.
And while Stanford had little
time to recover for another huge
contest against a ranked MPSF
foe, it continued its winning
ways against No. 11 Cal State-
Northridge (4-7, 2-5) the next
day.
The Cardinal walked away
from the Matadome with its fifth
consecutive road victory after a
25-22, 18-25, 25-22, 25-19 win,
mostly thanks to a career night
from Cook. The sophomore fol
lowed up his strong night against
Long Beach by recording a career
high 26 kills against the Matadors
the most kills by any player on
the Cardinal this season.
Cook's 26 kills surpassed his
previous career-high of 20 kills
and contributed his biggest kills
when the Cardinal needed him
most. Tied 1-1 after two sets, the
Santa Cruz native threw down
eight kills in the third set to help
win the set and swing the mo
mentum in the Cardinal's direc
tion. In addition to Cook's crazy
night, Lawson was his typical out
standing self once again, record
ing 19 kills of his own.
With just two games left on its
40-day quest away from the
Farm, Stanford has now com
piled a 6-2 record with the only
blemishes coming against UCLA
and Penn State, Kotsy said that
solid record, as well as Stanford's
current five-game win streak, in
dicated that the Cardinal is start
ing to gel at the right time.
"We see the light at the end of
the tunnel," he said. "We're
learning how to win on the road.
That's the lesson here. Those are
how conference champions are

made. You make it a routine; you
get in a groove."
After earning its second con
secutive weekend sweep, the
Cardinal will wrap up its epic 10-
game road schedule next week
end at UC-Irvine and UC-San
Diego, but the bulk of the tough
MPSF schedule still lies ahead.
With 13 games left against con
ference foes, Stanford is current
ly in second place in the MPSF,
but it will need to continue its hot
play to stay in the heart of the
race against a league stacked

with solid competitors. However,
the Cardinal will play 11 of those
13 conference games at home
over the last three months of the
season.
Stanford continues its quest
for an MPSF title on the road this
weekend in Irvine and San
Diego, with the first match
against the Anteaters at 6 p.m. on
Friday.

win the set and swing the mo
mentum in the Cardinal's direc
tion. In addition to Cook's crazy
night, Lawson was his typical out
standing self once again, record
ing 19 kills of his own.
With just two games left on its
40-day quest away from the
Farm, Stanford has now com
piled a 6-2 record with the only
blemishes coming against UCLA
and Penn State, Kotsy said that
solid record, as well as Stanford's
current five-game win streak, in
dicated that the Cardinal is start
ing to gel at the right time.
"We see the light at the end of
the tunnel," he said. "We're
learning how to win on the road.
That's the lesson here. Those are
how conference champions are

made. You make it a routine; you
get in a groove."
After earning its second con
secutive weekend sweep, the
Cardinal will wrap up its epic 10-
game road schedule next week
end at UC-Irvine and UC-San
Diego, but the bulk of the tough
MPSF schedule still lies ahead.
With 13 games left against con
ference foes, Stanford is current
ly in second place in the MPSF,
but it will need to continue its hot
play to stay in the heart of the
race against a league stacked

with solid competitors. However,
the Cardinal will play 11 of those
13 conference games at home
over the last three months of the
season.
Stanford continues its quest
for an MPSF title on the road this
weekend in Irvine and San
Diego, with the first match
against the Anteaters at 6 p.m. on

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
STANFORD 3
CAL.STATE NORTHRIDGE 1
2/1 1, Matadome


NICK SALAZAR/The Stanford Daily
Middle blocker Eric Mochalski (No. 13) and the Stanford men's
volleyball team survived a tough weekend on the road, winning close
contests against MPSF foes Long Beach State and Cal State North ridge.
Long Beach State's Walter
Pyramid, the eighth wonder of
the collegiate world, had been
anything but wonderful to the
Stanford men's volleyball team
in recent visits. On Friday, the
Cardinal took in the architectur
al anomaly with winning spirit.

No. 4 Stanford (9-2, 6-1
MPSF) eked out a five-set victo
ry in one of the nation's most
thrilling sagas, beating the No. 4
49ers 18-25, 25-17, 22-25, 25-20,
15-12. The victory snapped the
Card's three-match losing streak
to Long Beach State and contin
ued Stanford's recent domi
nance.
Stanford coach John Kotsy
was impressed by his team's per
formance, particularly those of
his middle blockers, Eric Mochal
ski and Gus Ellis. The two com
bined for 16 kills on .625 hitting, a
phenomenal line symbolic of a
careful team effort.
"It was an indication of our
passing," Kotsy said. "When the
middles hit at a high percentage, it
means we're passing pretty well."
Senior Brad Lawson added a
team season-high 21 kills for the
Cardinal, who battled back from
a 2-1 deficit to grab a crucial road
win. Sophomores Steven Irvin
and Brian Cook joined Lawson
in the double-digit-kills club,
adding 15 and 10, respectively.
The win was the fifth in a row
for the Cardinal, but the team

went into instant-recovery mode
in preparation for another tough
road test less than a day later.
And while Stanford had little
time to recover for another huge
contest against a ranked MPSF
foe, it continued its winning
ways against No. 11 Cal State-
Northridge (4-7, 2-5) the next
day.
The Cardinal walked away
from the Matadome with its fifth
consecutive road victory after a
25-22, 18-25, 25-22, 25-19 win,
mostly thanks to a career night
from Cook. The sophomore fol
lowed up his strong night against
Long Beach by recording a career
high 26 kills against the Matadors
the most kills by any player on
the Cardinal this season.
Cook's 26 kills surpassed his
previous career-high of 20 kills
and contributed his biggest kills
when the Cardinal needed him
most. Tied 1-1 after two sets, the
Santa Cruz native threw down
eight kills in the third set to help
win the set and swing the mo
mentum in the Cardinal's direc
tion. In addition to Cook's crazy
night, Lawson was his typical out
standing self once again, record
ing 19 kills of his own.
With just two games left on its
40-day quest away from the
