## Pitching perfection keys hot start at Kajikawa 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The perfect game is every pitcher's ultimate
dream: 27 batters up, 27 batters down. The
odds of throwing one is roughly 1 in 52,000
games pitched. It took Stanford Softball's Tea
gan Gerhart and Nyree White just five games,
as they threw a combined "perfecto" against
UC-Santa Barbara in Sunday's finale of the
season-opening Kajikawa Classic.
The pitching duo needed just 65 pitches to

mow down Santa Barbara's lineup in a game
that was shortened to five innings after the No.
9 Cardinal (4-1) scored four runs in the top of
the fifth and run-ruled the Gauchos.
The junior Gerhart opened with 2.2 perfect
frames, including four strikeouts, before the
freshman White took over and sealed the deal
in a performance that was so dominant that the
Gauchos failed to hit a single ball out of the in
field.

It was a nice cap to Stanford's season debut,
which saw a mixture of the promise preseason

pollsters saw in the team and the potential
weaknesses exposed against top teams.
The Cardinal got the ball rolling in the first
game of the season on Friday morning against
Cal State-Northridge, Coach John Ritmann
used 20 of his 21 players in a 13-1 rout of the
Matadors, and all eight freshmen saw action at
some point in a game shortened to five innings
by the mercy rule.
