## Pitching perfection keys hot start at Kajikawa 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The perfect game is every pitcher's ultimate
dream: 27 batters up, 27 batters down. The
odds of throwing one is roughly 1 in 52,000
games pitched. It took Stanford Softball's Tea
gan Gerhart and Nyree White just five games,
as they threw a combined "perfecto" against
UC-Santa Barbara in Sunday's finale of the
season-opening Kajikawa Classic.
The pitching duo needed just 65 pitches to

mow down Santa Barbara's lineup in a game
that was shortened to five innings after the No.
9 Cardinal (4-1) scored four runs in the top of
the fifth and run-ruled the Gauchos.
The junior Gerhart opened with 2.2 perfect
frames, including four strikeouts, before the
freshman White took over and sealed the deal
in a performance that was so dominant that the
Gauchos failed to hit a single ball out of the in
field.

It was a nice cap to Stanford's season debut,
which saw a mixture of the promise preseason

pollsters saw in the team and the potential
weaknesses exposed against top teams.
The Cardinal got the ball rolling in the first
game of the season on Friday morning against
Cal State-Northridge, Coach John Ritmann
used 20 of his 21 players in a 13-1 rout of the
Matadors, and all eight freshmen saw action at
some point in a game shortened to five innings
by the mercy rule.
Gerhart, Stanford's ace in the circle, retired
the first six batters in order and al
lowed just one batter to reach base
in three innings of work. White
took over next and allowed two
hits and one earned run in her col
legiate debut.
The Cardinal offense had its
way with Northridge's pitchers.
Stanford scored 13 runs, paced by
the usual suspects â€”junior short
stop Jenna Rich and senior Ashley
Hansen. All-Pac-10 second base
man Rich went 2-2 with three runs
scored, and Hansen, last season's
USA Softball Collegiate Player of
the Year, hit a home run to back
the pitching effort.
In the second game of the day's
doubleheader, however, the Card
ran into some trouble. No. 15 Texas
A&M locked in on Gerhart, scor
ing nine of the team's 10 runs off of
five home runs.
Stanford's offense eventually
responded, as Rich smashed a
three-run homer to left-center,

and the Cardinal took a brief lead
in the fourth inning on Rich's RBI
triple.
But the Aggies kept taking
Gerhart deep, as she gave up three
home runs in the final three innings,
allowing A&M to push past Stan
ford and take a narrow 10-9 victory.
The loss didn't linger, however,
particularly with Gerhart. She
picked up two wins in the circle on
Saturday, racking up 13 strikeouts
over 11 innings in wins over Port
land State and Texas Tech.
Against the Vikings, Gerhart es
caped from a no-out, bases-loaded
jam in the second inning with three
consecutive strikeouts, and the of
fense picked her up from there with
a steady smattering of runs.
It was more of the same against
Texas Tech, as Gerhart moved to 3-
1 on the season despite giving up
another home run to the Red
Raiders' star centerfielder, Mikey
Kenney.
Besides Rich, who has seven
RBI and a .500 batting average after
the first five games, Rittman can
take away plenty of positives from
the weekend tournament. Sopho

mores Corey Hanewich and
Danielle Miller each had multiple
extra-base hits, freshman Hanna
Winter scored five runs and redshirt
sophomore Tegan Schmidt record
ed her first career at-bat and hit
while driving in three runs over the
weekend.
The defense was very solid as
well, committing just one error in
the Classic. Although Gerhart
struggled against A&M, the home
runs were the only real blemishes
on her resume in 23 innings she
allowed just 13 hits and six walks
while striking out 27 batters.
The Cardinal will get another
chance to work out the early-sea
son jitters in a matchup with UC-
Davis on Wednesday, before host
ing the Stanford Nike Invitational
this weekend. The home opener is
scheduled for 2:30 p.m. on Friday
against Pacific.
