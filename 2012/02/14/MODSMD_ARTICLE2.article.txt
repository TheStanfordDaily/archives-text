## Maathai speaks on development, sustainability Daughter of Nobel Peace Prize recipient discusses human development in Kenya 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
Wanjira Maathai, daughter of the late 2004
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai,
discussed her mother's vision of sustainable de
velopment for Kenya, as well as the ongoing
challenges the country faces, when she spoke to
an audience of approximately 40 people at the
Y2E2 Building Monday evening.
"She is the voice of the new Africa and has
impressed her own footprints on the path of her
mother's vision," said Tanaka Mawindi 'l3, co
president of the Stanford African Students As
sociation (SASA), as she introduced Maathai to
the audience.
Wangari Maathai, mother of Wanjira, found
ed the Green Belt Movement (GBM) in Kenya
in 1977. The GBM began as a grassroots tree
planting program intended to tackle deforesta
tion and has since evolved into a global organi
zation that addresses environmental and human
development issues while fighting for female
empowerment.
To date, the organization has planted over 40
million trees in Kenya and around the world, a
number it hopes to increase to one billion.
Wanjira Maathai currently serves
on the GBM Board of Directors
and, since 2002, has been directing
International Affairs for the or
ganization.
The event, titled, "Trees for
Africa and Beyond: The Vision
Continues," focused on GBM's
vision of sustainable develop
ment for Kenya, as well as the his
tory of the organization and its fu
ture plans. The event was held in a
question-and-answer format and
was moderated by Alon Tal, a vis
iting professor at the Center for
Conservation Biology.
Maathai emphasized the wide
spread nature of GBM's work,
which extends to food security, en
ergy, education and women's rights.

"All these issues affect one an
other," she said. "We find that the
best way to address them is through
community-level projects."
"It is key to point out the dev
astating effects of deforestation

from an economic viewpoint," she
added. "It leads to things like the
destruction of water systems and
the decline of tourism. This is a
language that people under
stand."
According to Maathai, her
proudest achievement is the role
that the organization has played
in increasing environmental
awareness in Kenya.
"The biggest challenge for us
initially was that environmental
[issues] became political," she
said. "Someone had to speak for
the environment because the gov
ernment was abusing it, and that
got us into some trouble."
Maathai said that persistent
advocacy helped Kenyans be
come more aware and educated
on environmental issues and
helped the organization to "win in
the court of public opinion."
Maathai invited Stanford stu
dents to become involved in the
organization, citing her mother's
2006 visit to East Palo Alto to ini
tiate a tree-planting initiative by
Canopy, a local environmental
non-governmental organization
(NGO).To date, 1,600 trees have

been planted.
"Growing up, some people
didn't really understand the value
of trees," said East Palo Alto resi
dent Nancy Leech, who was part
of the 2006 initiative and attended
Monday's talk."Wangari inspired
the community to pay greater at
tention to the environment."
Addressing the future,
Maathai said the organization's
main goal is to anchor its position
and ensure that her mother's vi
sion lives on since her death last
September. The establishment of
the Wangari Maathai Institute for
Peace and Environmental Stud
ies in Nairobi, which she heads,
has contributed to this effort,
Maathai said.
"GBM's intertwining of
human development and the en
vironment is one of the most in
spiring stories I have seen in the
environmental sphere," said audi
ence member Michael Penuelas
'l5. "I was impressed by her in
credible drive and the pertinence
of the issues she raised."
