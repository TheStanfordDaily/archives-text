### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
Wanjira Maathai, daughter of the late 2004
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai,
discussed her mother's vision of sustainable de
velopment for Kenya, as well as the ongoing
challenges the country faces, when she spoke to
an audience of approximately 40 people at the
Y2E2 Building Monday evening.
"She is the voice of the new Africa and has
impressed her own footprints on the path of her
mother's vision," said Tanaka Mawindi 'l3, co
president of the Stanford African Students As
sociation (SASA), as she introduced Maathai to
the audience.
Wangari Maathai, mother of Wanjira, found
ed the Green Belt Movement (GBM) in Kenya
in 1977. The GBM began as a grassroots tree
planting program intended to tackle deforesta
tion and has since evolved into a global organi
zation that addresses environmental and human
development issues while fighting for female
empowerment.
To date, the organization has planted over 40
million trees in Kenya and around the world, a
number it hopes to increase to one billion.
