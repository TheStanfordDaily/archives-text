# NEW-LOOK CARD LOSES OPENERS
## 
### SARAH MAISEL STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford women's
lacrosse team dropped its first two
games of the season over the week
end, losing at home for the first
time in more than a year.

The Cardinal held its own in the
first half of Friday night's eventual
18-6 loss to No. 1 Northwestern,
the defending national champion,
with Stanford's backfield standing
strong against the Wildcats' relent
less attack. Sophomore goalkeep
er Lyndsey Munoz had eight of her
career-high 13 saves, and the de
fense forced seven turnovers. De
spite outshooting Stanford 19-8
and winning every draw control,
Northwestern only led 7-4 at the
half.
After the break, the Cardinal
defense held the Wildcats scoreless
for eight minutes, keeping its upset
hopes alive. Northwestern, winner
of six of the last seven NCAA titles,
finally broke through with 21:39
left in the game. The team scored
three more times before Stanford
sophomore Anna Kim eventually
found the net with 13:14 remain
ing. Freshman Hannah Farr pro
vided the lone other goal for the
Card, while the Wildcats added
seven more.
Northwestern played a much
cleaner game overall, committing a
total of 12 fouls and 14 turnovers to
Stanford's 34 and 20, respectively.
The Cardinal did pick up six draw
controls but could not convert on

those possessions.
Sunday's game proved to be a
better match, but Stanford again

failed to find the win column,
falling to No. 18 Ohio State 14-10.
This time, the team struggled with
possession in the first half but did
score on four of its six shots. Senior
Catherine Swanson scored twice
early on, while Farr and senior

Maria Fortino added the final two.
Stanford went into halftime trail
ing 7-4 for the second time in as
many games.
The Cardinal offense returned
to the field ready to play and tied
the score less than three minutes

in. Senior Anna Boeri scored right
away off an assist from her sister,
Emilie, who then also scored. Kim
added the last goal to make it 7-7.
Ohio State answered with three
straight goals of its own, and the
Cardinal never bounced back. Al
though the Cardinal outshot the
Buckeyes by a 22-11 margin in the
second half, Stanford simply did
not convert often enough to win.
Sophomore Rachel Ozer, junior
Carolyn Bradley and Swanson
scored the last three goals, but the
Card could not capture the lead.
The last goal gave Swanson her
first hat trick of the season.
Although this early struggle
puts the usually dominant Cardi
nal into unfamiliar territory, the
games provided the young team
with valuable experience as it
heads into another top-20
matchup this weekend against
Notre Dame in South Bend.
Many Stanford players are
starting for the first time, with sev
eral freshmen reserves seeing their
first collegiate action. The inexpe
rience should fall away as the sea
son continues, and the team will
undoubtedly benefit from compet
ing against elite programs. Starting
the season with such challenging
games should only make Stanford
more competitive in the coming
weeks as it tries to win its eighth
straight conference title and make
its third consecutive NCAA tour
nament appearance.
"We learned a lot from the
games this weekend," said junior
defender Nina Swanson. "Obvi
ously the turnout wasn't what we
wanted, but it showed us what we
have to work on for the upcoming
games. We're excited for Notre
Dame."
