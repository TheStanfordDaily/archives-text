# Love-struck by sports

### Tom Taylor 
So, in case you hadn't al
ready realized it from the
countless television ads
and store promotions, it's
Valentine's Day. Techni
cally a holiday that honors a hand
ful of early Christian martyrs
named Saint Valentine, today it is
better known as a day on which
people express their love. I'd hon
estly rather write about golf than
anything romantic, but I don't want
to be accused of being a spoilsport.
So, in my effort not to kill the
mood, I'm going to talk about my
love of sports.
My first love was Formula 1.1
started casually flicking on the TV
every other Sunday to watch the
races, but soon I was besotted. The
time I devoted to F1 spread from
the two-hour race window to the
entire weekend, from first practice
through qualifying. My relation
ship became an obsession; I never
missed a race, tuning in even while
on vacation. I scoured racing mag
azines from front to back, reading
every single word devoted to the
sport. I had an unhealthy knowl
edge of statistics, down to a lap-by
lap memory of races. I thought this
would last forever, but then F1
began to change. It started flirting
with the idea of drawing in new
fans and inadvertently lost me. I
can't quite say when, but some
where along the way we drifted
apart.

That is when I really began to
notice soccer. I can't lie and say I'd
never played or watched the game
before I am, after all, English
but outside of the World Cup and
kicking a ball around in the park, it
didn't play a huge part in my life.
Perhaps it was better that way. Soc
cer is the one sport that always
breaks my heart. There is nothing
quite like seeing your local team
relegated that desperate fall
from grace into an unknown abyss
or your national team coming
up short (yet again). When I was a
child, I guess I never quite realized
how deeply soccer runs in the fab
ric of English life and how deeply
the pain of consistent international
failure cuts. I'm not even sure if I
enjoy watching the sport it's
such a painful experience, even
when my team wins but nothing
in this world, nothing at all, matters
more than soccer.
There are others, too, probably
more than I want to mention in de
tail here. With cricket and rugby, it
was never love at first sight. I hon
estly hated the two sports as a kid.
Maybe it was some sort of rebel
lion against my family my
brother, father and grandfather
were all fans but just like
onions, when I grew up I actually
found myself enjoying them.
On this side of the Atlantic, bas
ketball was my first American
crush. Unlike other American
sports, I had actually played this
(albeit badly I always seemed to
end up sliding across the floor on
my ass), so it is the one with which
I feel I have at least some cultural
connection. My childhood best
friend also moved to Massachu
setts for a couple of years when I
was a kid, and through him and his
brothers I found out about Michael
Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal. Now,
even if it will never be able to com
pete with soccer for my affections,
the college season, especially in
March, is a highlight of my year.
And finally I get to my current
flirtation, football. This is the one
that really makes no sense, as we
share pretty much nothing in com
mon. I get frustrated by the long
breaks in play and struggle to get
excited about the very narrow
roles of many of the players. Some
might spend their entire careers
without even touching the football,
let alone actively participating. It
should also simply be genetically
impossible for me to like this game;
it's not football, it's American foot
ball. Football is soccer. And yet I
traveled to two major Stanford
road games last year, and I am al
ready thinking about visiting Notre
Dame next October and getting
back to campus ahead of the start
of term to hopefully catch another
victory over the Trojans.
I can no longer deny that I like
college football. Just don't tell soc
cer.

races, but soon I was besotted. The
time I devoted to F1 spread from
the two-hour race window to the
entire weekend, from first practice
through qualifying. My relation
ship became an obsession; I never
missed a race, tuning in even while
on vacation. I scoured racing mag
azines from front to back, reading
every single word devoted to the
sport. I had an unhealthy knowl
edge of statistics, down to a lap-by
lap memory of races. I thought this
would last forever, but then F1
began to change. It started flirting
with the idea of drawing in new
fans and inadvertently lost me. I
can't quite say when, but some
where along the way we drifted
apart.

That is when I really began to
notice soccer. I can't lie and say I'd
never played or watched the game
before I am, after all, English
but outside of the World Cup and
kicking a ball around in the park, it
didn't play a huge part in my life.
Perhaps it was better that way. Soc
cer is the one sport that always
breaks my heart. There is nothing
quite like seeing your local team
relegated that desperate fall
from grace into an unknown abyss
or your national team coming
up short (yet again). When I was a
child, I guess I never quite realized
how deeply soccer runs in the fab
ric of English life and how deeply
the pain of consistent international
failure cuts. I'm not even sure if I
enjoy watching the sport it's
such a painful experience, even
when my team wins but nothing
in this world, nothing at all, matters
more than soccer.
There are others, too, probably
more than I want to mention in de
tail here. With cricket and rugby, it
was never love at first sight. I hon
estly hated the two sports as a kid.
Maybe it was some sort of rebel
lion against my family my
brother, father and grandfather
were all fans but just like
onions, when I grew up I actually
found myself enjoying them.
On this side of the Atlantic, bas
ketball was my first American
crush. Unlike other American
sports, I had actually played this
(albeit badly I always seemed to
end up sliding across the floor on
my ass), so it is the one with which
I feel I have at least some cultural
connection. My childhood best
friend also moved to Massachu
setts for a couple of years when I
was a kid, and through him and his
brothers I found out about Michael
Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal. Now,
even if it will never be able to com
pete with soccer for my affections,
the college season, especially in
March, is a highlight of my year.
And finally I get to my current
flirtation, football. This is the one
that really makes no sense, as we
share pretty much nothing in com
mon. I get frustrated by the long
breaks in play and struggle to get
excited about the very narrow
roles of many of the players. Some
might spend their entire careers
without even touching the football,
let alone actively participating. It
should also simply be genetically
impossible for me to like this game;
it's not football, it's American foot
ball. Football is soccer. And yet I
traveled to two major Stanford
road games last year, and I am al
ready thinking about visiting Notre
Dame next October and getting
back to campus ahead of the start
of term to hopefully catch another
victory over the Trojans.
I can no longer deny that I like
college football. Just don't tell soc
cer.

Tom Taylors early love for Formu
