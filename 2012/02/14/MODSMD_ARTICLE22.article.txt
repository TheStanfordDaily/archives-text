						GOLDEN UPSET

### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Much was at stake on Saturday
afternoon, when the No. 8 Stan
ford women's swimming and div
ing team squared off against de
fending national champion and
top-ranked Cal at the Avery
Aquatic Center. In the final meet
of the regular season, which held
important implications for both
teams heading into the Pac-12
Championships, the Cardinal
pulled out a huge upset victory.

Recent history has intensified
the rivalry between the Bay Area
schools. After all, Stanford lost to
Cal in last year's regular season
dual meet a tough 10-point de
feat that came down to the final
event. The Cardinal edged out its
rival at the Pac-10 Championship,
but went on to see the Golden
Bears win the grand prize, the
NCAA title.
Fast-forward one year. The
Golden Bears came into the dual
meet as the No. 1 team in the
country, looking to clinch its first
undefeated regular season since
2006. The Cardinal made sure its

rivals had to wait at least one
more season.
Stanford (9-1, 6-0 Pac-12) de
feated Cal (7-1, 5-1 Pac-12) by a
margin of 174-126 in the highly
anticipated showdown, and in the
process, the Stanford women ac
complished an impressive feat:
upsetting three opponents ranked
higher than them in the span of
four weeks.
Without showing any signs of in
timidation, the Cardinal got off to
its usual fast start by winning the
very first event of the meet, the 200
medley relay. Cal led after the first
two legs, but senior Sam Woodward
swam a blazing butterfly to give
Stanford a half-second lead.This al
lowed freshman Maddy Schaefer to
hold off Cal senior Liv Jensen, one
of the country's fastest sprinters, in
securing the win for the Cardinal.
The win gave Stanford an 11-6 lead
that it would never relinquish.
In the very next event, sopho
more distance specialist Andie Tay
lor swam close to her season-best
time to win the 1000 freestyle. Tay
lor was neck-and-neck with Cal
freshman Catherine Breed for the
first 700 yards, but managed to pull
away in the final few laps.
No Cardinal swimmer won
more than one individual event,
but Stanford still managed to win
11 out of 16 events. Stanford's most
impressive performance may have
come in the breaststroke events,
one of the team's perceived weak

nesses. Freshman Katie Olson
edged out Cat's Yvette Yong in the
100 breaststroke by two-tenths of a
second. And although the Cardinal
was less successful in the 200, it was
outscored by just three points.
Combining the two breaststroke
events, Stanford outscored Cal 19-
18.

One of Stanford's most reliable
strengths is the backstroke, and
that strength was put on display on
Saturday. Sophomore Felicia Lee
touched out Cal's CindyTran in the
100 backstroke a remarkable
win considering that Tran is the de
fending NCAA champion in the
event. Backstroke star Maya Di-
Rado also chipped in with a victory

in the 200 backstroke and put up a
valiant effort against Cal junior
Caitlin Leverenz, one of the coun
try's fastest swimmers, in the 200 in
dividual medley.
Leverenz had a spectacular
meet, as expected, with three indi
vidual wins. In both the 200 butter
fly and 200 individual medley, she
won by an margin of five seconds.
The swimmers weren't alone in
racking up points for Stanford. On
the diving side, sophomore
Stephanie Phipps swept both the
1-meter and 3-meter springboard
events. On the 3-meter, Phipps
obliterated the competition, win
ning by nearly a 50-point margin.
The 1-meter proved to be much

closer, but Phipps still managed to
outscore Cal senior Molly Hayes
by more than ten points.
Although the Cal diving
squad's depth was able to essen
tially nullify Phipps' first-place
points, Phipps' sweep ensured
that Cal would not be able to gain
back the points it lost in the pool
by winning on the diving board.
With the regular season over,
Stanford will now take time to
prepare for the Pac-12 Champi
onships, held from Feb. 20-25, at
the King County Aquatic Center
in Federal Way, Wash.
