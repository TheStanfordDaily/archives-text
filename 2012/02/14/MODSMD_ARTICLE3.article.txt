### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Margaret Rawson 
The University Board of Trustees elected a
new chair at its February meeting, current chair
Leslie Hume '7l Ph.D. '79 announced in a press
briefing Monday. Steven A. Denning MBA '7B,
current vice chair, will replace Hume on July 1.
Hume praised the work of Denning, chairman of
General Atlantic Partners LLC, a worldwide pri
vate equity firm he co-founded in 1980.
"I could not be more pleased that Steve is
willing to take on this leadership role," Hume
said, referencing his impressive and varied lead
ership roles, including his work co-chairing The
Stanford Challenge, the Endowment Strategic
Review Committee and President Hennessy's
advisory committee on the University's propos
al for a New York City applied sciences campus.
Denning also chaired the Stanford Task Force on
Globalization.
Prior to his time at the Stanford Graduate
School of Business (GSB), Denning served six
years in the U.S. Navy and received an M.S. from
the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey,
Calif. Denning earned his B.S. from the Georgia
Institute of Technology in 1970. He lives in
Greenwich, Conn., with his wife Roberta Bow
man '75 MBA '7B, and their two children: Robert
MBA 'll and Carrie 'OB MA 'O9. Denning has
served on the Board since his 2004 appointment.
In 2008, the Dennings gifted
$l3 million to the University to
endow the Stanford Institute for
Creativity and the Arts (SICA)
directorship and to provide en
dowed funds for SICA program
ming, in addition to establishing
MFA fellowships for graduate
students in the fine arts.
Distance learning
Another significant discussion
topic of the Board's February
meetings was distance learning.
Hume characterized a panel on
the topic as the chance for the
trustees to entertain three issues;
the history of distance learning at
Stanford and elsewhere, the expe
rience of three courses offered
online this past fall and what
Stanford's mission regarding dis
tance learning will be in the fu
ture.

The trustees also heard a panel
on entrepreneurship and took a
moment to "celebrate and savor"
the successful conclusion of The
Stanford Challenge, a five-year
all-inclusive fundraising drive
that raised $6.2 billion in pledges
to the University, Hume said.
The Board also passed project
and construction approval for
several campus renovations, in
cluding the Stanford Research
Computing Facility at SLAC.
