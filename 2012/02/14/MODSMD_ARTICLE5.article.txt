# Rivera shares 19 year prison ordeal
## Wrongful imprisonment overturned with help of Stanford Law students, professor 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Juan Rivera, released last month after
serving 19 years in prison for being
wrongfully convicted of murder, spoke
yesterday afternoon at Stanford Law
School about his experience.
Speaking to an audience of over 100
students and faculty, law professor
Lawrence Marshall Rivera's lead ap
pellate counsel recounted his client's
ordeal.
Rivera's case began in 1992 when 11-
year old Holly Staker was found violent
ly raped and murdered in her home.
Rivera, in jail at the time on a minor, non
violent charge, told a fellow inmate that
he had seen a suspicious person entering
and leaving a party in the vicinity of the

murder.
On discovering that Rivera's lead was
false, investigators questioned the moti
vation for his misleading testimony.
Rivera was brought up from custody and
interrogated for three days, upon which
he eventually confessed to the crime.
"But his confession was blatantly
wrong," Marshall said.
Although the confession that Rivera
originally made didn't match up with the
evidence from the crime, according to
Marshall, "they extracted a different con
fession, correcting the various mistakes
within a few hours."
Although the state sought the death
penalty for Rivera, he was instead sen
tenced to life in prison.

Professor Lawrence Marshall discussed Juan Rivera's successful appeal after 19 years
of wrongful imprisonment. Marshall and 12 Stanford Law students led Rivera's appeal.
"I was surprised and relieved,"
Rivera sad. "But I was a young kid
and naive. Prison is still a death
penalty; it's just in one you die
quicker than the other."
Rivera's case was reopened in
1996, with his defense hinging on
an electronic tag, attached to his
ankle, which showed that Rivera
was at home the entire day of the
crime. Prosecution claimed the
tag had broken, and the evidence
was disregarded. In 2005, a lawyer
from Northwestern University
heard Rivera's story and got in
volved, pointing to a lack of DNA
evidence from the crime scene.
"Juan Rivera's DNA was not
there," Marshall said. "There was
a single perpetrator. This is a clas
sic false confession case. Instead
of dropping the case, the prosecu
tion forges ahead and says there
might have been DNA contami
nation. The prosecution claimed
that the girl was already sexually

active."
Twelve students from Stanford
Law School worked on Rivera's
successful appeal. Patricia Pei 'O4
J.D. 'lO was one of them. Pei be
came involved with the case after
reading an email about Rivera.
"We were lucky to meet Juan
and see him face to face," Pei said.
"He was struggling through life in
prison, but he was still maintain
ing overall a really positive atti
tude. I thought, if this is how the
guy in prison is doing, I better
work my ass off when I get home."
"The students showed me
what humanity was," Rivera said.
"I was wrongly convicted, and I
was in prison hoping someone
would listen."
In prison, Rivera educated
himself. He would ask the stu
dents for books to read and
thanked them for encouraging
him to learn.
"I would tie the books up with
string and use them as weights,
too," Rivera added. "You have to
be both healthy in body and
mind."
Rivera also became a vegan
during his time in prison and

helped cook food for fellow in
mates.
"After my second trial in 1993,
I thought myself a monster, but I
educated myself to show others
who I truly am as opposed to what
I'm convicted to be. I refused to
come home uneducated, come
home as Juan," Rivera said. "Not
everyone in prison is simply lost."
"There are preliminary things
this case can teach us," Marshall
said. "On the legal side, we now
understand the extent to which
confessions are tremendously
dangerous devices, especially
with the way that they can be ex
tracted. With a videotape of the
interrogation, Rivera would have
never been convicted. The jury
needs to be able to see what was
in the sausage of the confession.
"The other point that I want to
make is that lawyers were not
only part of solution but also part
of problem," Marshall added.
"Juan's prosecutors were con
demned with a case of tunnel vi
sion and became so wedded to the
idea that he was guilty that they
couldn't see what other people
could see in the evidence. We

have to remember to not be wed
ded so we can open our eyes to
new information."
Rivera received a standing
ovation as Marshall offered him a
cardinal Stanford sweater.
"Now I have the chance to go
to college, go home, meet my par
ents," Rivera concluded. "I love
the sun; I love petting the dog.
These are things we take for
granted, but I cherish every sec
ond of life."
"I think it's strange that people
talk about how monumental
these kinds of things are, because
I feel that Juan did this for him
self," Pei said. "I want to empha
size that even though this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,
stories like these exist, and they
are waiting to be told, and it's a
matter of putting yourself out
there to take on those stories.
You have the opportunities and
connections to make these
kinds of things happen. If you
have the chance to be a part of it,
be part of it."
