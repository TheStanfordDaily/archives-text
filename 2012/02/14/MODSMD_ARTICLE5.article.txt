# Rivera shares 19 year prison ordeal
## Wrongful imprisonment overturned with help of Stanford Law students, professor 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Juan Rivera, released last month after
serving 19 years in prison for being
wrongfully convicted of murder, spoke
yesterday afternoon at Stanford Law
School about his experience.
Speaking to an audience of over 100
students and faculty, law professor
Lawrence Marshall Rivera's lead ap
pellate counsel recounted his client's
ordeal.
Rivera's case began in 1992 when 11-
year old Holly Staker was found violent
ly raped and murdered in her home.
Rivera, in jail at the time on a minor, non
violent charge, told a fellow inmate that
he had seen a suspicious person entering
and leaving a party in the vicinity of the

murder.
On discovering that Rivera's lead was
false, investigators questioned the moti
vation for his misleading testimony.
Rivera was brought up from custody and
interrogated for three days, upon which
he eventually confessed to the crime.
"But his confession was blatantly
wrong," Marshall said.
Although the confession that Rivera
originally made didn't match up with the
evidence from the crime, according to
Marshall, "they extracted a different con
fession, correcting the various mistakes
within a few hours."
Although the state sought the death
penalty for Rivera, he was instead sen
tenced to life in prison.
