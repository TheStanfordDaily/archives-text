## Future of Trail funds uncertain Groups weigh in on Alpine Trad future; March decision possible 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
After San Mateo County rejected
Stanford's proposal to spend $lO million
to repair the Lower Alpine Trail in De
cember, how these funds might be spent
instead remains unclear.
Stanford Campus Residential Lease
holders (SCRL) and local environmen
tal advocacy groups testified two weeks
ago before the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors as to how the $lO
million should be spent. These leaders
spoke to The Daily about the future sta
tus of both the funds and the trail.
James Sweeney, professor of man
agement science and engineering and
president of the SCRL, highlighted a
strong push by advocates to use the
funds for a community grant program.
The initiative would provide grants for
applicants subject to a competitive
process.
Larry Horton, senior associate vice
president and director of government
and community relations, emphasized,
however, that the funds' potential appli

"Stanford and Santa Clara County
entered into a contract in 2006 that re

same contract also requires that this
money paid to Santa Clara County must
be used only to provide recreational op
portunities for Stanford campus resi
dents and facility users."
Sweeney said that he hopes the funds
will be used for projects that directly
benefit on-campus residents including
homeowners, students, faculty and staff.
He recognized, however, that the coun
ty is unlikely to make a decision quickly.
"I think the County Board of Super
visors' General Counsel is going to have
to make some judgment as to whether
that is even legal," Sweeney said, "and
then there would be the political judg
ment on whether the county board of
supervisors wants to go beyond what
were the legal requirements because
there is a lot of political pressure on
them to ignore the legal requirements."
RJ. Utz, a professor in the School of
Medicine and leader of the Committee
to Fix Lower Alpine Trail, said that sev
eral local groups such as the Com
mittee for Green Foothills have pre
sented proposals to the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors to use the
funds for various projects beyond the
