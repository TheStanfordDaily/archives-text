## Future of Trail funds uncertain Groups weigh in on Alpine Trad future; March decision possible 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
After San Mateo County rejected
Stanford's proposal to spend $lO million
to repair the Lower Alpine Trail in De
cember, how these funds might be spent
instead remains unclear.
Stanford Campus Residential Lease
holders (SCRL) and local environmen
tal advocacy groups testified two weeks
ago before the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors as to how the $lO
million should be spent. These leaders
spoke to The Daily about the future sta
tus of both the funds and the trail.
James Sweeney, professor of man
agement science and engineering and
president of the SCRL, highlighted a
strong push by advocates to use the
funds for a community grant program.
The initiative would provide grants for
applicants subject to a competitive
process.
Larry Horton, senior associate vice
president and director of government
and community relations, emphasized,
however, that the funds' potential appli
cations are limited.
"Stanford and Santa Clara County
entered into a contract in 2006 that re
quires Stanford to pay this money to
Santa Clara County if San Mateo Coun
ty did not want to use it to fix their own
badly degraded and unsafe trail," Hor
ton wrote in an email to The Daily. "That
same contract also requires that this
money paid to Santa Clara County must
be used only to provide recreational op
portunities for Stanford campus resi
dents and facility users."
Sweeney said that he hopes the funds
will be used for projects that directly
benefit on-campus residents including
homeowners, students, faculty and staff.
He recognized, however, that the coun
ty is unlikely to make a decision quickly.
"I think the County Board of Super
visors' General Counsel is going to have
to make some judgment as to whether
that is even legal," Sweeney said, "and
then there would be the political judg
ment on whether the county board of
supervisors wants to go beyond what
were the legal requirements because
there is a lot of political pressure on
them to ignore the legal requirements."
RJ. Utz, a professor in the School of
Medicine and leader of the Committee
to Fix Lower Alpine Trail, said that sev
eral local groups such as the Com
mittee for Green Foothills have pre
sented proposals to the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors to use the
funds for various projects beyond the
Stanford campus.
Meanwhile, representatives
from SCRL suggested several
ways for the funds to be used, in
cluding the development of an
inner and outer hiking and cy
cling loop trail around and with
in campus land. Other proposals
included park restorations and
the construction of a park near
the Mausoleum.
Sweeny said that, regardless
of the current proposals, the
SCRL is looking to create an in
ternal process in which they can
give a voice to all residents, in
cluding students, as to how the
fund should be used.
"These proposals are sugges
tions, but we would like a process
that allows a weighing in of those
for whom the money was intend
ed," Sweeney said.
At the public hearing, Super
visor Liz Kniss requested that
the Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors' lawyers report back
on how the county can legally
use the funds by the end of
March. While there is no set time
limit for the County's decision,
all parties must wait until the
County lawyers investigate the
legal limitations.
"It really all boils down to
what the lawyers say," Utz said.

"If the lawyers say you can build
anything you want, anywhere
you want, then I would not be
surprised if there was a descent
to going to court, but that's just
my pure speculation."
Horton said, however, that
Stanford is still willing to negoti
ate some form of compromise.

"We have testified before the
Santa Clara County Board that
Stanford would like to work with
the County to find a mutually
agreeable resolution that is satis
factory to both parties of the
contract," Horton said. "Stan
ford remains a party of interest
in this matter."
As for the Lower Alpine Trail,
which remains in a state of dan
gerous disrepair, according to
Utz, while San Mateo County
Supervisors are in contact with
Santa Clara County Supervisors
to try to receive some funding for
the trail's repair, the likelihood
of any funding relief is slim con
sidering San Mateo County's
earlier rejections of the funds in
their entirety.
"If the funding is going to be
used to build things on campus,"
Utz said, "then there will proba
bly be more discussions about
trying to bring some of the
money over to help fix the trail.
But, again, I would view the like
lihood of that happening as less
than 1 percent."

Utz, while San Mateo County

of any funding relief is slim con

earlier rejections of the funds in
their entirety.

After San Mateo County rejected
Stanford's proposal to spend $lO million
to repair the Lower Alpine Trail in De
cember, how these funds might be spent
instead remains unclear.
Stanford Campus Residential Lease
holders (SCRL) and local environmen
tal advocacy groups testified two weeks
ago before the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors as to how the $lO
million should be spent. These leaders
spoke to The Daily about the future sta
tus of both the funds and the trail.
James Sweeney, professor of man
agement science and engineering and
president of the SCRL, highlighted a
strong push by advocates to use the
funds for a community grant program.
The initiative would provide grants for
applicants subject to a competitive
process.
Larry Horton, senior associate vice
president and director of government
and community relations, emphasized,
however, that the funds' potential appli
cations are limited.
"Stanford and Santa Clara County
entered into a contract in 2006 that re
quires Stanford to pay this money to
Santa Clara County if San Mateo Coun
ty did not want to use it to fix their own
badly degraded and unsafe trail," Hor
ton wrote in an email to The Daily. "That
same contract also requires that this
money paid to Santa Clara County must
be used only to provide recreational op
portunities for Stanford campus resi
dents and facility users."
Sweeney said that he hopes the funds
will be used for projects that directly
benefit on-campus residents including
homeowners, students, faculty and staff.
He recognized, however, that the coun
ty is unlikely to make a decision quickly.
"I think the County Board of Super
visors' General Counsel is going to have
to make some judgment as to whether
that is even legal," Sweeney said, "and
then there would be the political judg
ment on whether the county board of
supervisors wants to go beyond what
were the legal requirements because
there is a lot of political pressure on
them to ignore the legal requirements."
RJ. Utz, a professor in the School of
Medicine and leader of the Committee
to Fix Lower Alpine Trail, said that sev
eral local groups such as the Com
mittee for Green Foothills have pre
sented proposals to the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors to use the
funds for various projects beyond the
Stanford campus.
Meanwhile, representatives
from SCRL suggested several
ways for the funds to be used, in
cluding the development of an
inner and outer hiking and cy
cling loop trail around and with
in campus land. Other proposals
included park restorations and
the construction of a park near
the Mausoleum.
Sweeny said that, regardless
of the current proposals, the
SCRL is looking to create an in
ternal process in which they can
give a voice to all residents, in
cluding students, as to how the
fund should be used.
"These proposals are sugges
tions, but we would like a process
that allows a weighing in of those
for whom the money was intend
ed," Sweeney said.
At the public hearing, Super
visor Liz Kniss requested that
the Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors' lawyers report back
on how the county can legally
use the funds by the end of
March. While there is no set time
limit for the County's decision,
all parties must wait until the
County lawyers investigate the
legal limitations.
"It really all boils down to
what the lawyers say," Utz said.

"If the lawyers say you can build
anything you want, anywhere
you want, then I would not be
surprised if there was a descent
to going to court, but that's just
my pure speculation."
Horton said, however, that
Stanford is still willing to negoti
ate some form of compromise.

"We have testified before the
Santa Clara County Board that
Stanford would like to work with
the County to find a mutually
agreeable resolution that is satis
factory to both parties of the
