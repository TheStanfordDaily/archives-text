# John Taylor discusses nation's economic recovery with students

### JAMIE KIM 
John Taylor, senior fellow and
former director of the Stanford
Institute for Economic Policy Re
search (SIEPR), spoke to a group
of about twenty undergraduates
Monday afternoon on how best to
revive the American economy.
In summarizing his recently
published book, "First Principles:
Five Keys to Restoring America's
Prosperity," Taylor argued that
the country's best hope of eco
nomic revival lies in a return
from its current deviation â€” to
its founding principles of econom
ic freedom in fiscal, regulatory
and monetary policy.
Taylor stressed the importance
of abandoning temporary fixes
for the ongoing recession to adopt
more substantial free-market,
non-interventionist economic
policies sustainable in the long
term.
Taylor previously served as an
economic advisor in the adminis

trations of President Gerald Ford
and President George H.W. Bush,
as well as the presidential cam
paigns of Bob Dole and George
W. Bush.
Taylor began his informal half
hour address by describing the
five key principles laid out in his
book, citing a predictable policy
framework, the rule of law, re
liance on markets, strong incen
tives and limited government.
Taylor asserted that, historically,
economic growth in the United
States has coincided with adher
ence to these principles, from
which Taylor added that recent
administrations have strayed.
Drawing the first of many com
parisons to America's economic
history in the past half-century,
Taylor noted that the current eco
nomic recovery has been slow in
comparison to recovery from the
1981 recession.
