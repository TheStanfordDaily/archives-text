# John Taylor discusses nation's economic recovery with students

### JAMIE KIM 
John Taylor, senior fellow and
former director of the Stanford
Institute for Economic Policy Re
search (SIEPR), spoke to a group
of about twenty undergraduates
Monday afternoon on how best to
revive the American economy.
In summarizing his recently
published book, "First Principles:
Five Keys to Restoring America's
Prosperity," Taylor argued that
the country's best hope of eco
nomic revival lies in a return
from its current deviation — to
its founding principles of econom
ic freedom in fiscal, regulatory
and monetary policy.
Taylor stressed the importance
of abandoning temporary fixes
for the ongoing recession to adopt
more substantial free-market,
non-interventionist economic
policies sustainable in the long
term.
Taylor previously served as an
economic advisor in the adminis

trations of President Gerald Ford
and President George H.W. Bush,
as well as the presidential cam
paigns of Bob Dole and George
W. Bush.
Taylor began his informal half
hour address by describing the
five key principles laid out in his
book, citing a predictable policy
framework, the rule of law, re
liance on markets, strong incen
tives and limited government.
Taylor asserted that, historically,
economic growth in the United
States has coincided with adher
ence to these principles, from
which Taylor added that recent
administrations have strayed.
Drawing the first of many com
parisons to America's economic
history in the past half-century,
Taylor noted that the current eco
nomic recovery has been slow in
comparison to recovery from the
1981 recession.
"The gap, or the hole, is as deep

as when we started," he said, re
ferring to the current economic
situation. "In that case, the recov
ery was much better. The average
growth rate in 10 quarters [then]
was about 6 percent; in this case
it's about 2.5 percent."
Taylor presented the country's
recent economic history in dis
tinct phases, first faulting what he
described as interventionist and
unpredictable economic policies
implemented in the mid-'6os as
contributing to economic insta
bility in the 1960s and 19705. By
contrast, Taylor cited Reagan's
return to predictable free market
policies in the early 'Bos as con
tributing to sustained growth and
a model for future U.S. policy
makers.
He then criticized the recent
regression to unpredictable poli
cies, characterizing the Federal
Reserve's lowering of the interest
rate near the beginning of the re
cession, as well as the subsequent
stimulus package and bailouts as
improvised and spontaneous.
Taylor acknowledged the diffi
culty of assigning causality and
correlation between these poli
cies and the subsequent state of
the economy.
"That's still a big struggle," he
said. "Would things have been

worse? I think it's worse because
they did those things."
Taylor disputed the concept
that economic policies are neces
sarily partisan, citing Nixon as an
example of a Republican who
"campaigned on free-market
themes and for political reasons
flipped," and Clinton's continua
tion of the free-market trend
begun by Reagan.
Student questions focused on
the economic recovery and future
government policies, with Taylor
expressing uncertainty about the
direction of the next administra
tion.
In addressing the effect of gov
ernment policy as opposed to
natural business cycles on un
employment levels in the current
recession, Taylor stressed the im
portance of avoiding temporary
and unpredictable policies enact
ed to generate short-term benefits.
"Incentives matter," he said.
"Business people talk about this
great uncertainty which holds
back hiring and therefore holds
back demand."
Taylor ended his talk by noting
that developing countries have
gone in the opposite direction
from the United States, moving
closer to these free-market prin
ciples even while America has
been moving away.
"That's why they're doing
well," he concluded.

as when we started," he said, re
ferring to the current economic
situation. "In that case, the recov
ery was much better. The average
growth rate in 10 quarters [then]
was about 6 percent; in this case
it's about 2.5 percent."
Taylor presented the country's
recent economic history in dis
tinct phases, first faulting what he
described as interventionist and
unpredictable economic policies
implemented in the mid-'6os as
contributing to economic insta
bility in the 1960s and 19705. By
contrast, Taylor cited Reagan's
return to predictable free market
policies in the early 'Bos as con
tributing to sustained growth and
a model for future U.S. policy
makers.
He then criticized the recent
regression to unpredictable poli
cies, characterizing the Federal
Reserve's lowering of the interest
rate near the beginning of the re
cession, as well as the subsequent
stimulus package and bailouts as
improvised and spontaneous.
Taylor acknowledged the diffi
culty of assigning causality and
correlation between these poli
cies and the subsequent state of
the economy.
"That's still a big struggle," he
said. "Would things have been

worse? I think it's worse because
they did those things."
Taylor disputed the concept
that economic policies are neces
sarily partisan, citing Nixon as an
example of a Republican who
"campaigned on free-market
themes and for political reasons
flipped," and Clinton's continua
tion of the free-market trend
begun by Reagan.
Student questions focused on
the economic recovery and future
government policies, with Taylor
expressing uncertainty about the
direction of the next administra
tion.
In addressing the effect of gov
ernment policy as opposed to
natural business cycles on un
employment levels in the current
recession, Taylor stressed the im
portance of avoiding temporary
and unpredictable policies enact
ed to generate short-term benefits.
"Incentives matter," he said.
"Business people talk about this
great uncertainty which holds
back hiring and therefore holds
back demand."
Taylor ended his talk by noting
that developing countries have
gone in the opposite direction
from the United States, moving
closer to these free-market prin
ciples even while America has
been moving away.
"That's why they're doing
well," he concluded.
