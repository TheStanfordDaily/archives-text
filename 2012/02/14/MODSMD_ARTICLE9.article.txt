# Stanford engineers improve solar panel technology using nanoshells
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Judith Pelpola 
A team of Stanford engineers
has pioneered the use of tiny
spheres of nanocrystalline-silicon
to increase light absorption in
solar panels.
Engineers coated small balls
of silica with silicon and etched
away the silica center using hy
drofluoric acid. This process pro
duces lightweight spheres of sili
con, which prevent light from es
caping the shell after initial ab
sorption.
Once trapped in the shell, light
circulates within the structure, al
lowing the silicon to absorb the
light as time elapses.
Three layers of nanoshells
achieved an absorption rate of 75
percent. A single layer of these
nanoshells was also found to ab
sorb a broader spectrum of light
than a regular layer of silicon.
The nanoshells are more cost
efficient, reducing both the
amount of material used for the
absorption of a unit of light and
the amount of time needed to
produce the shells. The nanoshells
can be fabricated in just a few
minutes.
The shells also absorb differ
ent light angles to a greater de
gree, allowing solar panels to ab
sorb more light from the sun even
when originating from different
points in the sky.
The flexibility of the
nanoshells further allows solar
panels to be used in areas where
incoming solar light angles are far
from ideal.
Researchers hope to extend
the use of nanoshells to sparser
materials, such as Indium and Tel
lurium, according to Vijay
Narasimhan, a current doctoral
candidate working in the lab of
professor of Yi Cui and a co-au
thor of the paper published in Na
ture Communications.
