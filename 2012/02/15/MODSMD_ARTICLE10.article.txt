# Pathways to public service
## Haas and SIG fellowships grant students opportunities in public service fields 
### ARIELLA AXLER 
With investment banking in
terviews, start-up recruit
ment and the chaos of
summer job applications,
winter quarter is a time
when many students contemplate the di
rection of their career path. For some of
these students, the private sector seems the
logical next step for post-Stanford pursuits,
but for others, the public sector has its own
appeal. For these students, the Flaas Center
and Stanford in Government (SIG) team
up together each year to offer a competi
tive summer internships program.
"I gained an international perspective
while working on things that I cared
about," said Rhodes Scholar Ishan Nath
'l2, a former member of The Daily Editori
al Board. "Because of the people I met and
the opportunities that were opened [for
me], my SIG Fellowship was one of the
most important things that happened to me
during my time at Stanford."
After his sophomore year, Nath partici
pated in an internship at the Carter Center
in Atlanta as part of the SIG and Haas Cen
ter Summer Fellowships Program. Nath, an
economics and earth systems major,
worked for Jay Hakes, director of the Na
tional Commission on the BP Deepwater
Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.
After his summer work, Nath continued to
pursue his interest in the subject through a
six-month research project he completed
while serving as a senior consultant on the
commission.
"Stanford has a tremendous tradition
dating back to Leland Stanford of prepar
ing future leaders in the world," said Megan

Fogarty, director of fellowships and post
graduate service work at the Haas Center.
"The founding platform of the University is
about making a difference in the world.
Most students come to Stanford with com
mitment to the public good."
According to the program website, SIG
and the Haas Center seek to "provide stu
dents with support to develop and imple
ment innovative, collaborative service proj
ects that address community needs."
In the past six years, the program has
worked especially hard to expand opportu
nities for students to become involved in
the public sector.
Students can work in Washington,
D.C., for government organizations, rang
ing from the Health Resources and Serv
ices Administration to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Committee, For those who
want to remain on the West Coast, the pro
gram provides internships at the California
Department of Finance and at the Envi
ronmental Defense Fund in San Francisco.
Another key element of the fellowships
program is the international fellowships
component. Students who are selected for
these fellowships spend their summers
abroad in countries such as Peru, Taiwan,
Ghana and Hungary, working on issues
ranging from human and civil rights to envi
ronmental conservation. Fellowships at the
Institute for Democracy in South Africa,
the Reserve Bank of India and the Brook
ings Doha Center in Qatar are a few of the
offered positions.
"I wanted to do something that would
immerse me in the think tank world and
allow me to deepen my interest in the Mid
dle East. This internship was the perfect
combination of that," said Miriam Marks
'll, a coterm student in public policy and

Daily columnist who participated in the
Brookings Doha Center SIG fellowship
this past summer.
Marks said that it was especially exciting
to work in the Middle East in the midst of
the Arab Spring.
In addition to pre-arranged positions,
the program offers funding for students
to design their own project proposals.
This option gives students who find a job
that interests them in the public sector
the opportunity to apply for a fellowship
stipend to reduce financial strain. Past re
cipients of this fellowship have worked on
Capitol Hill for senators and congressmen
and at policy think tanks in California.
The stipend program is a pilot initiative,
recently founded in honor of the 50th an
niversary of SIG. A survey distributed last
year indicated a high demand for funding
that would allow students to take on other
internships in the public sector, precipitat
ing the program.
"Forty percent of people [in a student
survey] said their plans would have
changed had they had funding to support
an unpaid internship in public policy," said
Lina Marie Hidalgo 'l3, SIG director of ex
pansion planning.
This year, SIG will disburse 10 stipends
following two different application dead
lines in February and April. The stipends
range from $4,000 to $6,000 and are based
on the internship location and the student's
financial aid status.
SIG hopes to expand the program in up
coming years.
"Next year we hope to have 15
[stipends], and we hope to have secured an
endowment to fund 40
internships by 2014,"
Hidalgo said.

She emphasized that students from di
verse backgrounds are encouraged to
apply.

"In terms of selection, we give prefer
ence to students who demonstrate need,
are non-majors in the field and ... younger
students [whom] we hope will continue to
pursue public policy" she said.
According to Fogarty, as a result of the
support offered by the Flaas Center and
SIG in encouraging students to pursue pro
fessions in public service, there has been a
drastic increase in postgraduate involve
ment and interest in the public sector.
Of the Class of 2012, about 260 students
have actively been to the Haas Center to ex
plore a public service job, an increase from
about 150 this time last year, Fogarty said.
The Haas Center actively networks with
alumni and the Career Development Cen
ter to make opportunities for jobs and in
ternships widely available.
While the fellowships promote profes
sional engagement in the public sector,
Nath emphasized that the private sector
work can be considered public service.
"Public service is not just NGOs and
politics, it is also anything you love that may
contribute to society in away, such as work
ing for a tech company and doing great
things for society" Nath said.
Besides summer fellowships, Haas offers
a variety of outlets for students to become in
volved in public service throughout the year.
"Any student that wants to do service
during the year or after graduation should
visit Haas,"Fogarty said "There is a wealth of
support, and I urge folks to take advantage
of it."

After his summer work, Nath continued to
pursue his interest in the subject through a
six-month research project he completed
while serving as a senior consultant on the
commission.
"Stanford has a tremendous tradition
dating back to Leland Stanford of prepar
ing future leaders in the world," said Megan

Fogarty, director of fellowships and post
graduate service work at the Haas Center.
"The founding platform of the University is
about making a difference in the world.
Most students come to Stanford with com
mitment to the public good."
According to the program website, SIG
and the Haas Center seek to "provide stu
dents with support to develop and imple
ment innovative, collaborative service proj
ects that address community needs."
In the past six years, the program has
worked especially hard to expand opportu
nities for students to become involved in
the public sector.
Students can work in Washington,
D.C., for government organizations, rang
ing from the Health Resources and Serv
ices Administration to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Committee, For those who
want to remain on the West Coast, the pro
gram provides internships at the California
Department of Finance and at the Envi
ronmental Defense Fund in San Francisco.
Another key element of the fellowships
program is the international fellowships
component. Students who are selected for
these fellowships spend their summers
abroad in countries such as Peru, Taiwan,
Ghana and Hungary, working on issues
ranging from human and civil rights to envi
ronmental conservation. Fellowships at the
Institute for Democracy in South Africa,
the Reserve Bank of India and the Brook
ings Doha Center in Qatar are a few of the
offered positions.
"I wanted to do something that would
immerse me in the think tank world and
allow me to deepen my interest in the Mid
dle East. This internship was the perfect
combination of that," said Miriam Marks
'll, a coterm student in public policy and

Daily columnist who participated in the
Brookings Doha Center SIG fellowship
this past summer.
Marks said that it was especially exciting
to work in the Middle East in the midst of
the Arab Spring.
In addition to pre-arranged positions,
the program offers funding for students
to design their own project proposals.
This option gives students who find a job
that interests them in the public sector
the opportunity to apply for a fellowship
stipend to reduce financial strain. Past re
cipients of this fellowship have worked on
Capitol Hill for senators and congressmen
and at policy think tanks in California.
The stipend program is a pilot initiative,
recently founded in honor of the 50th an
niversary of SIG. A survey distributed last
year indicated a high demand for funding
that would allow students to take on other
internships in the public sector, precipitat
ing the program.
"Forty percent of people [in a student
survey] said their plans would have
changed had they had funding to support
an unpaid internship in public policy," said
Lina Marie Hidalgo 'l3, SIG director of ex
pansion planning.
This year, SIG will disburse 10 stipends
following two different application dead
lines in February and April. The stipends
range from $4,000 to $6,000 and are based
on the internship location and the student's
financial aid status.
SIG hopes to expand the program in up
coming years.
"Next year we hope to have 15
[stipends], and we hope to have secured an
endowment to fund 40
internships by 2014,"
Hidalgo said.

She emphasized that students from di
verse backgrounds are encouraged to
apply.

"In terms of selection, we give prefer
ence to students who demonstrate need,
are non-majors in the field and ... younger
students [whom] we hope will continue to
pursue public policy" she said.
According to Fogarty, as a result of the
support offered by the Flaas Center and
SIG in encouraging students to pursue pro
fessions in public service, there has been a
drastic increase in postgraduate involve
ment and interest in the public sector.
Of the Class of 2012, about 260 students
have actively been to the Haas Center to ex
plore a public service job, an increase from
about 150 this time last year, Fogarty said.
The Haas Center actively networks with
alumni and the Career Development Cen
ter to make opportunities for jobs and in
ternships widely available.
While the fellowships promote profes
sional engagement in the public sector,
Nath emphasized that the private sector
work can be considered public service.
"Public service is not just NGOs and
politics, it is also anything you love that may
contribute to society in away, such as work
ing for a tech company and doing great
things for society" Nath said.
Besides summer fellowships, Haas offers
a variety of outlets for students to become in
volved in public service throughout the year.
"Any student that wants to do service
during the year or after graduation should
visit Haas,"Fogarty said "There is a wealth of
support, and I urge folks to take advantage
of it."
