## EDITORIAL Chi Theta Chi and University ownership 
### 
Wednesday, Feb. 8 was a
momentous day for the
residents and alumni of
Chi Theta Chi, a student run co
operative house that is one of
only two on-campus student resi
dences not owned by the Univer
sity. A collection of University of
ficials (including the Vice Provost
of Student Affairs, the Dean of
Residential Education, and the
Senior Associate Vice Provost for
Residential & Dining Enterpris
es) told Chi Theta Chi's manage
rial staff that the University
planned to not renew Chi Theta
Chi's land lease, thereby bringing
the house under University own
ership.
During the meeting, the Uni
versity cited a number of reasons
for its decision, including: Chi
Theta Chi's expired corporation
status with the State of California
(which means Chi Theta Chi can
not be held liable for incidents on
its property), fire inspection vio
lations and concerns about the
comfort and safety of students
who draw into the house but may
not wish to live there. Currently,
the University plans to begin col
lecting rent from residents start
ing spring quarter, to close the
house over the summer for reno
vations (the first summer closure
for the house in many years), and
to reopen Chi Theta Chi as a fully
integrated University co-op for
the 2012-13 academic year.
Reactions to the news across
campus were largely negative.
Students both within and outside
of the co-op community ex
pressed concern at the Universi
ty's handling of the announce
ment, which came with minimal
forewarning and little attempt to
jointly resolve the situation. Stu
dents also expressed concern at
the potential loss of one of only
two private-title student resi
dences on campus, and the only
private-title residence open to all
Stanford undergraduates via the
Draw. The other private-title
house, the all-male Sigma Chi fra
ternity, is typically only open to
fraternity members during the
academic year. As a private-title
house, Chi Theta Chi offers

unique management opportuni
ties for its residents beyond ordi
nary self-op and co-op manageri
al duties. Current and former res
idents also cite Chi Theta Chi's
"work week" a week before
classes begin in September when
all Chi Theta Chi residents work
on house projects and Chi
Theta Chi's ability to stay open to
students during the summer as
other unique advantages that
University-owned houses do not
offer.
Undoubtedly, Chi Theta Chi
needs to address some of the Uni
versity's complaints by, for in
stance, correcting fire inspection
violations. This Board, however,
wonders if the University could
have pursued less drastic meas
ures before unilaterally revoking
Chi Theta Chi's lease. We ques
tion, for instance, the University
justifying its decision by citing a
tax status issue that only arose
this past August (and has since
been resolved) and what
amounts to a straw-man argu
ment about student "comfort and
safety." Chi Theta Chi was one of
the most desirable residences in
the 2011-2012 housing draw, so
random students with poor draw
numbers are not being assigned
to Chi Theta Chi; Chi Theta Chi
could also easily convert to a 100
percent pre-assigned residence to
formally eliminate any potential
unhappy residents. Particularly in
light of the University's decision
to reinstate the Kappa Sigma fra
ternity's housing for the 2012-13
academic year, we argue that it is
equitable to give Chi Theta Chi a
similar "second chance" to allay
the University's concerns. If Chi
Theta Chi has not adequately ad
dressed the University's concerns
in a year, then revoking its land
lease may be more justified.
Chi Theta Chi's independence
produces a unique culture unlike
any other residential culture on
campus. The Facebook page in
support of Chi Theta Chi is aptly
titled "Keep XOX weird." It
would be a shame to unnecessar
ily compromise the independ
ence of such a unique mainstay of
campus culture.

could also easily convert to a 100
percent pre-assigned residence to
formally eliminate any potential
unhappy residents. Particularly in
light of the University's decision
to reinstate the Kappa Sigma fra
ternity's housing for the 2012-13
academic year, we argue that it is
equitable to give Chi Theta Chi a
similar "second chance" to allay
the University's concerns. If Chi
Theta Chi has not adequately ad
dressed the University's concerns
in a year, then revoking its land
lease may be more justified.
Chi Theta Chi's independence
produces a unique culture unlike
any other residential culture on
campus. The Facebook page in

titled "Keep XOX weird." It
would be a shame to unnecessar

ence of such a unique mainstay of
campus culture.

Wednesday, Feb. 8 was a
momentous day for the
residents and alumni of
Chi Theta Chi, a student run co
operative house that is one of
only two on-campus student resi
dences not owned by the Univer
sity. A collection of University of
ficials (including the Vice Provost
of Student Affairs, the Dean of
Residential Education, and the
Senior Associate Vice Provost for
Residential & Dining Enterpris
es) told Chi Theta Chi's manage
rial staff that the University
planned to not renew Chi Theta
Chi's land lease, thereby bringing
the house under University own
ership.
During the meeting, the Uni
versity cited a number of reasons
for its decision, including: Chi
Theta Chi's expired corporation
status with the State of California
(which means Chi Theta Chi can
not be held liable for incidents on
its property), fire inspection vio
lations and concerns about the
comfort and safety of students
who draw into the house but may
not wish to live there. Currently,
the University plans to begin col
lecting rent from residents start
ing spring quarter, to close the
house over the summer for reno
vations (the first summer closure
for the house in many years), and
to reopen Chi Theta Chi as a fully
integrated University co-op for
the 2012-13 academic year.
Reactions to the news across
campus were largely negative.
Students both within and outside
of the co-op community ex
pressed concern at the Universi
ty's handling of the announce
ment, which came with minimal
forewarning and little attempt to
jointly resolve the situation. Stu
dents also expressed concern at
the potential loss of one of only
two private-title student resi
dences on campus, and the only
private-title residence open to all
Stanford undergraduates via the
Draw. The other private-title
house, the all-male Sigma Chi fra
ternity, is typically only open to
fraternity members during the
academic year. As a private-title
house, Chi Theta Chi offers

unique management opportuni
ties for its residents beyond ordi
nary self-op and co-op manageri
al duties. Current and former res
idents also cite Chi Theta Chi's
"work week" a week before
classes begin in September when
all Chi Theta Chi residents work
on house projects and Chi
Theta Chi's ability to stay open to
students during the summer as
other unique advantages that
University-owned houses do not
offer.
Undoubtedly, Chi Theta Chi
needs to address some of the Uni
versity's complaints by, for in
stance, correcting fire inspection
violations. This Board, however,
wonders if the University could
have pursued less drastic meas
ures before unilaterally revoking
Chi Theta Chi's lease. We ques
tion, for instance, the University
justifying its decision by citing a
tax status issue that only arose
this past August (and has since
been resolved) and what
amounts to a straw-man argu
ment about student "comfort and
safety." Chi Theta Chi was one of
the most desirable residences in
the 2011-2012 housing draw, so
random students with poor draw
numbers are not being assigned
to Chi Theta Chi; Chi Theta Chi
could also easily convert to a 100
percent pre-assigned residence to
formally eliminate any potential
unhappy residents. Particularly in
light of the University's decision
to reinstate the Kappa Sigma fra
ternity's housing for the 2012-13
academic year, we argue that it is
equitable to give Chi Theta Chi a
similar "second chance" to allay
the University's concerns. If Chi
Theta Chi has not adequately ad
dressed the University's concerns
in a year, then revoking its land
lease may be more justified.
