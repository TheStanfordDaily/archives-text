## It's okay to listen to your parents 
### Ravali Reddy 
I'm going to let you in on a little
secret: I wasn't planning on
coming to Stanford.
I know, it's hard to stomach, par
ticularly after last week's column
where I publicly declared my love
for Stanford (which, for the record,
still holds true). But back when I
was in high school, I spent the ma
jority of my senior year thinking
that I would be attending a particu
lar school over on the East Coast.
I had applied to said school
early action, and once I got in, I
was on cloud nine. I had it all fig
ured out: I was going to major in
bioengineering, join a sorority
and live it up in the snow (I'm not
entirely sure how I tricked myself
into thinking this I live in Cali
fornia and own a portable space
heater). I was convinced, and I
was in the midst of packing my
bags when something happened: I
got into Stanford.
I still remember reading the
email that welcomed me to the
Class of 2014.1 was sitting on my
bed and staring at my computer
screen while my mom, who was
downstairs in the kitchen, re
mained completely unaware of
the news I had just received. It was
only after a few minutes of disbe
lief that I managed to walk over to
the stairs and yell, "Hey Mom ...
I just got into Stanford."
It was right then that my slight
ly-less-than-a-quarter-life crisis
began.
I had never really thought
about what I would do if I got into
Stanford, so when I did get in, I
had absolutely no idea what to do
with myself. I spent hours making
pro/con lists and seeking out stu
dents at both colleges in order to
try and determine who was happi-

er. I even attended both admit
weekends, but as the May 1 dead
line drew near, I found myself no
closer to making a decision.
It wasn't until one night at din
ner, when I totally freaked out
(typical crazed "But what if I
make the wrong choice?!?!"
stuff), that my parents finally
spoke up and suggested that I at
tend Stanford. I quickly shut up
and asked them for their reason
ing, which led to hours of discus
sion at the dinner table that gave
me plenty of new pros and cons
for my lists.
The next morning, after careful
deliberation, I approached my
parents and told them that I was
ready to make a deposit to secure
my place at Stanford University,
and the waterworks began. I cried,
my mom cried, we all cried, and
long story short here I am now.
Now, the only reason I was re
minded of this story was because I
am a sophomore, and I, like many
of my fellow Fourteen-ers, am cur
rently in the process of figuring
out my major. iDeclare Week was
just a few weeks ago, and at the
various events there was one par
ticular piece of advice that I re
member hearing multiple times:
"Remember,it's not your parents'
education. It's yours."
From the moment we commit
to Stanford, we are encouraged to
take advantage of the Universi
ty's vast resources and collabo
rate with the Stanford communi
ty. We are taught to seek advice
and learn from our peers, our pro
fessors, our advisors and even
alumni. Despite this, however, we
are never told or even reminded
that it is still okay to get help from
our original mentors our par-

For 18 years of our lives, before
we became Stanford students, we
were our parents' kids first. They
raised us and helped us become
the individuals we are today, indi
viduals who got into Stanford.
Doesn't raising Stanford students
qualify them as members of the
Stanford community?
Now, I'm not telling you to ori
ent yourself and head off in what
ever direction your parents point
you toward. When it comes down
to it, President Flennessy and Vice
Provost Elam are completely
right: at the end of the day, this is
your education, and more impor
tantly, your life. You should be
making your own decisions, and
you should be making ones that
make you happy.
But it's important to remember
that making your own decisions
doesn't mean you need to shut
other people out of your life. So
next time you're worried about
picking your major or stressing
about a midterm, instead of whin
ing to your roommate, try picking
up the phone and giving your par
ents a call. Regardless of whether
you take their advice, I'm sure
you'll leave them with a smile on
their faces.

love to hear about how you chose
yours. Email her at ravreddy@stan
