# BURSTING THE BUBBLE
## Lamenting the loss of IHUM 
### Edward Ngai 
Students hate IHUM. As
signed books are conspicu
ously crisp and unmarked.
There are rows of empty bike racks
in front of a half-empty auditorium
by week three. "I have so much
IHUM reading," a dormmate com
plains.
No response. A snort, and
maybe a snigger somewhere. Some
people sigh. Fact is, if you're still
doing your IHUM reading in week
six, you probably need a heavier
course load.
It's such a shame, really, that
this is the state of freshman-year
humanities at one of the world's
top-ranked humanities schools.
Because whether we like IHUM
or not, the humanities should play
some role in every college stu
dent's education, no matter what
you want to do or who you want to
be.
The humanities can teach us to
think critically and analyze conno
tations, undercurrents and con
texts as well as what is on the page.
Reading the stories of other char
acters, real or fictional, can teach us
about ethics, morality and our role
on earth. We can see the follies of
humankind in text and perhaps
even realize that, in some ways,
we're not so different here in flesh.
Those aren't skills only for hu
manities majors. Those are broad
based, critical-thinking, big-picture
skills that everyone should be fa

miliar with.
So why do we hate IHUM so
much?
Because at the end of the day,
many of us are forced to take hu
manities classes we're not interest
ed in. The very least the IHUM
program could do is let us apply
the humanities to areas we are pas
sionate about. If you're going to
force us to eat spinach at the buf
fet, at least let us heap on the ranch.
But instead of being offered
classes that address our interests
like a medical humanities
IHUM exploring the world of
bioethics, or a social sciences
IHUM relating morality to gov
ernment and economics we get
to choose between such diverse of
ferings as Poetic Justice, Epic Jour
neys, Inventing Classics and What
is a Classic?

Never mind all the other amaz
ing classes you wish you had the
units to take. You're stuck in the
salad line, the buffet consisting of
religious classics, Russian classics
and Greek and Roman classics.
Bon appetit.
Compound this with the diffi

culty of scheduling two quarters in
advance and the potential conflicts
with other classes, and you're pret
ty much dealt a hand where you
might have to take a class you
couldn't care less about.
And say in some alternate real
ity we are willing to walk into our
IHUM class and give it a fair shot.
After all, it focuses on close read
ing, rhetorical analysis and textual
arguments. These are all very im
portant skills.
But some have found that their
repeated attempts to relate the
works of antiquity to the 21st cen
tury have been rebuffed on the
grounds that it is beyond the scope
of the assignment. In the humani
ties, this is probably true. We prob
ably shouldn't extrapolate too
much and should rather focus on
how the text reads.
But for a Humßio major? Few
of us are interested in the material

to begin with. Now we can't even
relate these texts to the things we
do care about?
No wonder that however well
intentioned we are going into the
program, we inevitably end up dis
illusioned with IFfUM.
In truth, our hatred of IHUM
should not be that difficult to
change, Stanford should move
IHUM in a more interdisciplinary
direction, relating the humanities
to science, medicine, political sci
ence and fine arts.
Indeed, this would do much to
prove to skeptical college students
that the humanities are crucial and
omnipresent no matter what we in
tend to pursue in the future.
But as Stanford does away with
IHUM in the near future, replac
ing it with a waffly "thinking"
course that essentially waives the
requirement to have any exposure
to the humanities over a four-year

college career, the University is
throwing the baby out with the
bathwater. We should reaffirm the
role of the humanities in a well
rounded, elite education by using
an approach that proves their
worth and übiquity in other fields
to students; instead, we are simply
enlarging the hoops through which
freshmen are forced to jump.
Worse still, we will no longer re
quire Stanford graduates to have
at least acquainted themselves
with the humanities and their
teachings: lessons of morality, soci
ety and the human condition.
And it is the loss of those les
sons, if not necessarily the IHUM
program itself, which is worth
lamenting.
