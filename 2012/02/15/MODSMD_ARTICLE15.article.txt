## The 						ballad of great Jeremy Lin 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
Oh, what could have
been, if we had just
held onto him! With
the basketball team
quickly falling back
to earth, so soon after a hot start had
many among us dreaming of once
again watching the Cardinal in the
Big Dance, it has been hard to es
cape the incredible story of a young
man who played his high school ball
just across the street at Palo Alto
High School.
His team won a state title, and he
was named the state player of the
year by several associations. A boy
with a 4.2 GPA in high school, he
seemed like the perfect candidate
for Stanford, particularly given the
transition from Paly to the Farm,
which is literally just a few hundred
yards, wouldn't be too difficult.
But the Cardinal's then-coach
Trent Johnson dropped the ball al
most as badly as Bills wide receiver
Stevie Johnson, not offering a schol
arship to the 6-foot-3 point guard
who averaged 15 points, seven as
sists, six rebounds and five steals per
game his senior season on a team
that was 32-1.
The problem was that then-Stan
ford coach Trent Johnson reported
ly "[messed] this thing up bad, really
bad," according to Paly coach Peter
Diepenbrock.
Johnson supposedly did not
offer him a scholarship because he
had only one more offer left and was
already set to let one of two-highly
recruited players, Landry Fields or
Da'Veed Dildy, take the slot.
The local kid took off for Har
vard, and the rest, as they say, is his
tory. But the addition of the exact
thing that Stanford men's basket
ball has been missing over the past
four years, an outstanding pure
point guard, could well have
bridged the gap between the I xipcz
brothers and Fields and the current
solid sophomore class.
Instead, the Cardinal has been
an afterthought on the nation's col
lege basketball radar, not making
the NCAA Tournament or even
the NIT since 2008.
Oh, what might have been, if we
had just held onto Jeremy...
There once was a young boy
named Jeremy, he went to Paly just
across the street;
In high school he was a man
among boys, with good hands,
strong will and quick feet.
As young Jeremy got older and
bigger, his play began to make peo
ple talk:
"That boy has got quite a bright
future; to him all the colleges will
flock."
But though Paly won a state title,
poor Jeremy could not catch a
break;

No schools offered him scholar
ships, they saw flaws that he just
couldn't shake.
With no chances for him on the
West Coast, Jeremy took his game
to the East;
At Harvard he found himself
wanted, and in Ammaker's style at
peace.
In Beantown, Jeremy found a
fast rhythm, pushing the ball up the
court and down;
The Ivy League could not con
tain him: not Penn, not Princeton
and not Brown.
And soon little Jeremy became

big, scoring often and against any
one,
But the scouts still said,"No way!
In the League, you won't even score
one."
So Jeremy went back to the
drawing board, his NBA dreams
un-obscured,
Until at last the Warriors came
calling, his place on a team now as
sured.
The story almost stopped there,
in Oakland's not-so-bright lights,
But there was more to be written
(and more to be smitten); his name
was primed for new heights.
But little Jeremy as many once
knew him, isn't that same Jeremy
anymore;
He got a chance with the Knicks,
plus some flashy new kicks, and

moved off his brother's living room
floor.
All the points, the assists, the
great highlights, we watch on the
edge of our seats,
As Jeremy plays like a reckless
tiger, and we cheer his many great
feats.
In 100 years things might be
quite different, and the world might
dissolve into sin;
But one thing will be shared for
ever: the ballad of great Jeremy Lin.
Despite his love for Jeremy Lin,
Miles Bennett-Smith will never,
ever leave Tim Tebow's strong em
brace. Request to hear Miles' epic
