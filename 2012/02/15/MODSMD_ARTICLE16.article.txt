## Mixed results define first two tournaments 
### AUSTIN BLOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its first tournament of the spring season, the
Stanford men's golf team took third place at the
Amer Ari Invitational on the strength of fresh
man Patrick Rodgers' third-place finish and jun
ior Andrew Yun's final round 65.
Heading into the final round of the tournament,
held at the Kings' Course on Hawaii's Big Island,
Stanford was nine-under and tied for fifth, but the
team posted an 11-under 277 on the last day to vault
into third place and finish at -20. Yun's seven-under 65
was tied for the lowest round of the tournament. No. 1
Texas, which won the tournament by 10 shots, and No.
4 USC were the only schools to finish ahead of the
Cardinal.
"We got off to not the greatest start, but to come
back and finish the way we did with such a good field
is very promising, a good way to start the winter sea
son, so that's always nice," said senior captain Wilson
Bowen. "I think we were the low team if you look at
the last two days, so just not quite the best start."
A few days after the tournament, the Golf Coach
es Association of America honored both Yun and
Rodgers by placing them on the 28-player Ben Hogan
Award watch list. The Hogan Award, given annually
to the best men's collegiate golfer, is awarded at the
end of the spring season.
Entering this week's San Diego Intercollegiate, the
Cardinal was ranked No. 5 in the nation by Golfweek,
but the team stumbled in its opening round at the San
Diego Country Club, shooting a team score of +l9 on
Monday. This time, the Cardinal was unable to recov
er from its slow start and finished eighth, 32 shots be
hind tournament-winner No. 11 Washington.
Rodgers, currently the nation's No. 3 college golfer,
led the team with an individual score of six-over and

finished 17th. It was his
first finish outside the
top 10 in six college tour
naments. Junior Steven Kearney,
a native of San Diego, called the
course "extremely difficult."
"So far this sea
son it seems that we
* always manage to ,
have three guys play re- \
ally well, but our fourth and fifth man *
struggle to post low scores," Kearney
said. "In a game where you must count
four out of five total scores, we need to
have everyone play well on the same day.
That is how you win golf tournaments as a
team. We are only as strong as our fifth man."
The team now has a two-week break be
fore traveling to Las Vegas for the Southern
Highlands Collegiate Masters, which starts
March 9. Bowen said the event, which the Cardi
nal does not usually play attracts a strong field
every year. Following the Las Vegas tourna
ment, the Cardinal plays two more tourna
ments before competing in the Pac-12 Cham
pionship and NCAA Regionals.
Despite the team's disappointing finish
in San Diego, Kearney believes the Car
dinal can win the national champi
onship.
"There is no doubt in my mind
that we are the best
team in the country," *
Kearney said. "Many
guys on the team have had very glorified jun
ior careers, and we all know how to win. We won
our first tournament of the season by 16 shots,
which is almost unheard of in college golf." _
He pointed out the strengths of teammates like
Rodgers and Yun, who he said "play consistently well
every tournament," and the elite tournament ex
perience of the team's starting lineup as evi-

dence of the squad's potential.
"If we can all put together the
round that we are capable of, there
is no team that can beat us," Kear
ney added. "It's only a matter of
time before it happens, and I have a
feeling it is going to be very soon."
Despite the recent setback, he
defended his team's chances
come May, particularly against
those who doubt Stanford's abil
ity to perform in high-pressure
situations.

"The way I see it, we are the
underdog right now," he said.
"We haven't played our best yet
this season, and the media ques
tions our ability to play well
under pressure after not making
it through Regionals last year in
Indiana. I have seen every guy on
this team shoot in the mid-60s on
difficult courses, so there is no
doubt that we can pull it off."
"But most of all," he added,
"nothing would be better than
beating [No. 3] UCLA and USC
on their home track to bring home
an NCAA Championship."
