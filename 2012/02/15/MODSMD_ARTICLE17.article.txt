# MEN FALTER IN KLAHN'S RETURN
## CARD LOSES AT HOME TO FRESNO STATE 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team suffered a
tough defeat on Tuesday afternoon at the
hands of a resilient Fresno State squad. In a
very close, back-and-forth match, the Bulldogs
were able to rebound from losing the doubles
point and clinch the match four points to three
during a particularly intense round of singles
play.

The teams were locked in a tight match
from the very beginning of the day. After more
than three hours of play, only two points had
been decided the Cardinal with one after
winning the doubles point and the Bulldogs
with the other after a win on court five. The
three top court matches all went to three sets
all of them could have gone either way
and sounds of fierce rallies and primal screams
echoed off the stands of a sparsely populated
Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
The Stanford squad was playing without
two of its top singles players: senior Bradley
Klahn, who remains sidelined from singles play
with a back injury, and junior Dennis Lin, who
was out of the lineup with an undisclosed ail
ment. Klahn did make his highly anticipated
dual-match debut as a doubles player, teaming
up with usual partner Ryan Thacher in their
victory on the No. 1 doubles court. Klahn's dou

bles return gives Cardinal fans some positive
hope for his return to singles action, as the team
has been somewhat listless in his absence.
The unavailability of Klahn and Lin in sin
gles play resulted in the team's two freshmen,
John Morrissey and Robert Stineman, playing
on the third and fourth singles courts, their
highest assignments of the season. As has
been their tendency all year, the rookies rose
to the challenge, providing the Cardinal with
their only two singles wins of the afternoon.
The match ultimately came down to the No.
1 singles court, where Thacher was doing battle
with fellow senior Remi Boutillier. Boutillier
and Thacher have seen a lot of each other over
the years, and both are ranked in the top 40 of
the collegiate singles rankings, with Thacher at
No. 37 and Boutillier at No. 14. The match was
a classic seesaw affair, with Boutillier taking the
first set, Thacher the second and the third de
cided by a tiebreaker, which Boutillier man
aged to win, 7-5.
The Cardinal has had difficulty building
momentum this season, with just two wins
last week's victories over Hawaii and Brigham
Young University in its last five matches.
Last Friday, following the victory over BYU,
Thacher spoke of the need to "refocus and get
back on the winning track," a need that the Car
dinal will have to address in its 11-day break
from dual-match play.
In the interim, Stanford will travel to Char
lottesville, Va., this weekend to compete in the
ITA National Team Indoor Championships.
