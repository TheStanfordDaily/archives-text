# STEWART AND KAUPPILA TALK SHOP
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
With the No. 2 Stanford baseball team
kicking off its season this Friday, The
Stanford Daily sat down with sopho
more shortstop Lonnie Kauppila and
junior center fielder Jake Stewart to talk
shop before No. 10 Vanderbilt comes to
Sunken Diamond.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): First of all,
what was the team's reaction to being
ranked the country's preseason No. 2
team by Baseball America?
Lonnie Kauppila (LK): We were
stoked; we didn't really expect to be
that high. We expected to be pretty
high, but being up at No. 2 is kind of a
statement. Honestly, being No. 2 and
seeing that makes each and every one
of us work just as hard, if not harder,
just to maintain that spot.
Jake Stewart (JS): When that ranking
first came out, we were surprised. We
expected to be up there just because of
our situation last year, where we made
it to regionals and we had a lot of guys
coming back, but I didn't think that we
expected to be as high as No. 2.1 don't
think that's really changed our work

ethic coming to the field every day,
though. Our goal is to outwork every
team in the country, our coaches say it
every day, and even if we had been
ranked sixth, seventh, 10th, 12th or
15th, that still would have been our
goal.
TSD: With so many returning starters
from a quality team last season, what's
the mood been like so far for the team
this year?
LK: Personally, I feel that this is the
closest team I've ever been on. We're
all on the same page; we all work hard,
not only for the team but also for our
selves individually, because we want to
be the best that we can be. When we do
that as a team, we can ultimately come
together and try and achieve that one
goal of going to Omaha and ultimate
ly winning either a Pac-12 champi
onship or a national championship.
JS: Personally, this is the coolest team
I've ever been on because of the fact
that everybody's so close and works so
hard together ... It's cool for me be
cause it's not just the fact that every
body's such great teammates, it goes
beyond that. Everybody on the team is
the biggest fans of everybody else on

the team. We love watching each other
play as much as we love playing beside
each other. I've never been on a team
that's like that.
TSD: After losing a couple critical
parts of the bullpen last season, like
Los Angeles Dodgers' first-round pick
Chris Reed, how do you expect the
pitching staff to do this season?
LK: To be honest, I think that our
pitching staff is just as good as it was
last year. I mean we did lose Chris,
which was a big hit to our team, and
[White Sox draft pick Scott]
Snodgress, too, but I think the key this
year is just throwing strikes and letting
the other teams beat us. I feel that with
our quick outfield and with our almost
stellar infield, we can beat anyone as
long as our pitchers just get it over the
plate and as long as we hit, because we
do have probably one of the best line
ups in the country.

TSD: With seven of the team's best hit
ters returning, what are some of the
team's offensive goals for this season?

LK: We've talked about it, and we think

he has the most experience. Kauppila and the No. 2 baseball
team will kick off their season at home against Vanderbilt.
