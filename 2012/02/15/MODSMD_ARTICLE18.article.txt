# STEWART AND KAUPPILA TALK SHOP
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
With the No. 2 Stanford baseball team
kicking off its season this Friday, The
Stanford Daily sat down with sopho
more shortstop Lonnie Kauppila and
junior center fielder Jake Stewart to talk
shop before No. 10 Vanderbilt comes to
Sunken Diamond.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): First of all,
what was the team's reaction to being
ranked the country's preseason No. 2
team by Baseball America?
Lonnie Kauppila (LK): We were
stoked; we didn't really expect to be
that high. We expected to be pretty
high, but being up at No. 2 is kind of a
statement. Honestly, being No. 2 and
seeing that makes each and every one
of us work just as hard, if not harder,
just to maintain that spot.
Jake Stewart (JS): When that ranking
first came out, we were surprised. We
expected to be up there just because of
our situation last year, where we made
it to regionals and we had a lot of guys
coming back, but I didn't think that we
expected to be as high as No. 2.1 don't
think that's really changed our work

ethic coming to the field every day,
though. Our goal is to outwork every
team in the country, our coaches say it
every day, and even if we had been
ranked sixth, seventh, 10th, 12th or
15th, that still would have been our
goal.
TSD: With so many returning starters
from a quality team last season, what's
the mood been like so far for the team
this year?
LK: Personally, I feel that this is the
closest team I've ever been on. We're
all on the same page; we all work hard,
not only for the team but also for our
selves individually, because we want to
be the best that we can be. When we do
that as a team, we can ultimately come
together and try and achieve that one
goal of going to Omaha and ultimate
ly winning either a Pac-12 champi
onship or a national championship.
JS: Personally, this is the coolest team
I've ever been on because of the fact
that everybody's so close and works so
hard together ... It's cool for me be
cause it's not just the fact that every
body's such great teammates, it goes
beyond that. Everybody on the team is
the biggest fans of everybody else on

the team. We love watching each other
play as much as we love playing beside
each other. I've never been on a team
that's like that.
TSD: After losing a couple critical
parts of the bullpen last season, like
Los Angeles Dodgers' first-round pick
Chris Reed, how do you expect the
pitching staff to do this season?
LK: To be honest, I think that our
pitching staff is just as good as it was
last year. I mean we did lose Chris,
which was a big hit to our team, and
[White Sox draft pick Scott]
Snodgress, too, but I think the key this
year is just throwing strikes and letting
the other teams beat us. I feel that with
our quick outfield and with our almost
stellar infield, we can beat anyone as
long as our pitchers just get it over the
plate and as long as we hit, because we
do have probably one of the best line
ups in the country.

TSD: With seven of the team's best hit
ters returning, what are some of the
team's offensive goals for this season?

LK: We've talked about it, and we think

year, will be making the transition back to shortstop, in which
he has the most experience. Kauppila and the No. 2 baseball
team will kick off their season at home against Vanderbilt.
we should honestly be putting up
six to seven runs a game. One
through eight, one through nine, we
don't know who some of the hitters
are going to be, but one through
seven or eight is just going to be
brutal for the other pitchers. I kind
of feel bad for them, knowing that
after you face Stewart, Gaffney and
Piscotty you still have to deal with
Ragira, Wilson and Kenny, so
there's no one that you can really
look to to get an out.
JS: We feel as if Piscotty and Ragi
ra are the two best pure hitters in
the country, so having those two
guys back-to-back ... we feel like
every single time they come up,
they can get a hit. If we get on base,
we know one of those two is going
to drive us in. It's hard to get past
those two and get them both out.
It's pretty much impossible.
They're about as good as it gets in
college baseball.
TSD: Even with all the returning
starters, there are still some open
spots left in the starting lineup
who do you expect to have a
breakout season this year?
LK: I think [redshirt junior] Chris
tian Griffiths is going to make a
comeback; he hurt himself last
year, redshirted last year, so I think
he could make a big impact on our
team, especially being a switch hit
ter. As for freshmen, we expect
some of the pitchers to really step
up because they have a good op
portunity to make it in the rotation
and give the team the depth that

we need. We expect [freshmen
pitchers] David Schmidt, Spenser
Linney and John Hochstatter to
do some things that are kind of un
expected of them in their first
year.
TSD: Lonnie, you've switched
from second base last season to
shortstop this year. How has that
transition been for you, and do
you expect to stay at short this en
tire season?
LK: I 've played shortstop all my
life, so actually last year transfer
ring to second base was kind of a
big transition for me. I kind of did
n't know what to expect. Now that
I've been more on the left side of
the infield this year, it's been awe
some. I can't explain how comfort
able and how at home I feel at
shortstop. I'm hoping I can get the
playing time I want, but overall, as
long as we're winning I don't have
a problem with playing either
shortstop or second base.
TSD: Finally, how nice is it to start
with four of the first five series of
the season at home, especially
after going on the road for the first
three series of the year last sea
son?
LK: It's nice being at home; last
year was kind of hectic, especially
being a freshman. Traveling three
weekends in a row is a little rat
tling, especially dealing with
crowds and umpires and all that, so
it's kind of comforting to have
them come to our place this year
and to be in our home environ
ment. I think it's going to do a lot
more good than bad.
