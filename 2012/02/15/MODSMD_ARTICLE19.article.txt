# GYMNASTICS BATTLES IN BERKELEY
## 
### CONNOR SCHERER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Sunday, both the men's
and women's gymnastics squads
traveled to the East Bay, seeking
important victories in hostile terri
tory. While the women's team left
Cal's Haas Pavilion with a domi
nant win, ending a two-meet losing
streak, the men returned to the
Farm disappointed, falling to Cal
and top-ranked Oklahoma.
Coming into the meet against
Cal (4-3), the Stanford women's
gymnastics team (5-2) looked to
end one streak while extending an
other. The Cardinal had lost two
consecutive meets on the road to
Pac-12 opponents first at Ore
gon State and the following week
end at UCLA and faced yet an
other hostile environment at
Berkeley. However, the Card has
had impressive success against Cal
in recent history, going undefeated
against the Golden Bears since
2000, and 34-1 dating back to 1996.
Stanford achieved on both
counts, as strong performances
from veterans and younger gym
nasts alike helped the team come
away with a 196.175-194.725 deci
sion over rival Cal.
The Card took an early lead on
the floor exercise, earning a total
team score of 48.775, good enough
for a 0.150-point lead. Freshman
Pauline Hanset was especially
strong, earning her first collegiate
victory and scoring 9.850 in the

event for the third time this year.
"It was nice to see all of her hard
work pay off this weekend," said
head coach Kristen Smyth. "She
performed a beautiful floor routine
and was rewarded for her efforts."
The Cardinal held a 0.500-point
lead going into the third round,
which was extended by junior
Nicole Dayton's strong 9.875 on
vault. Dayton won the event for
Stanford, and the team put up a
total score of 48.950 in the event.
Stanford excelled on the bars,
putting up a season-best score of
49.400. Each of Stanford's gym
nasts scored a 9.800 or higher,
highlighted by senior Nicole
Pechanec, who scored a 9.925. Al
though Pechanec competed in just
one event on Sunday rather than
her usual four, the 9.925 was a per
sonal best and a team-high in the
uneven bars for the season.
With a commanding 1.125-
point lead going into the final
round, the Cardinal looked to seal
up the victory with a solid round on
the beam and did so with a team
score of 49.050. Sophomore Shona
Morgan and freshman Ivana Hong
both earned impressive scores of
9.900 to win the event. The victory
also marked the first collegiate win
for Hong, who Smyth described as
"one of the best in the country on
balance beam."

Junior Ashley Morgan took
home her first all-around victory of
the season with a score of 39.175,
while sophomore captain Amanda

Spinner made her official colle
giate debut after being sidelined
for two years by injury with a 9.750
on beam.
This Saturday, Stanford will
compete against Brown and
Bridgeport at the Metroplex Chal
lenge in Fort Worth, Texas.
The No. 5 Stanford men's gym
nastics team faced a familiar oppo
nent in No. 7 Cal (4-3), as Sunday
was the fourth time the two teams
have met this season. Also at the
meet were the No. 1 Oklahoma
Sooners (8-1), marking the first
time the two teams faced each
other this season.
Competing without freshman
Brian Knott, who is out for the sea
son due to injury, the Cardinal (4-
3) faced a daunting task: squaring
off against two of the nation's pre
mier programs with a depleted ros
ter. After beating Cal in its last two
meetings this season, Stanford
(343.700) placed third in Sunday's
meet behind both the Sooners
(351.600) and the Golden Bears
(349.400).
After two rounds, the Card was
in second place behind Oklahoma.
However, struggles on the pommel
horse prevented the Cardinal from
decreasing the deficit, instead
dropping the team to third place,
where it would stay for the rest of
the afternoon.
Stanford did defend its No. 1
ranking in vault with a strong team
score of 58.900, led by junior Eddie
Penev (15.500), redshirt freshman

Sean Senters (15.100) and sopho
more Cale Robinson (14.900).
Both Penev and Robinson posted
season-high scores in the event.
The Cardinal also put together
its best performance on high bar
for the season, posting a team
score of 57.800. Redshirt sopho
more Paul Hichwa led the team in
the event with a 14.800, his best
high bar score on the season, while
Penev was close behind with a
14.700. Another highlight for the
Cardinal was redshirt junior Jor

dan Nolff, who captured the title in
rings with a 15.300.
As a whole, the team struggled
to compete at its potential, scoring
4.700 points lower than its last
meet. However, Stanford will have
an opportunity to quickly reverse
the trend as it faces Cal yet again,
as well as the Japanese College All-
Stars, at Burnham Pavilion on Sat
urday evening at 7 p.m.
