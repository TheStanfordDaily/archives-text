# Uribe reflects on presidential term
## Former Colombian president responds to allegations of human rights violations 
### TORSTEIN HOSET 
Alvaro Uribe, former president of
Colombia, addressed security issues in
Latin America to a capacity audience of
400 people in the Knight Management
Center Cemex Auditorium Tuesday. The
South American leader acknowledged
claims of human rights violations by his
administration, but argued that these
measures were necessary to right the
course of the country in the long term.
"Colombia had many problems at the
time I took charge," Uribe said.
Noting the prevalence of poverty and
violence when he assumed power in 2002,
Uribe noted, "these problems couldn't be
addressed until the security situation was
under control." It was difficult, if not im
possible, he added, to attract foreign in
vestment to the country until order was re
stored.
When Uribe took power, his country
was on the brink of civil war, with large
portions of the countryside and rainfor
est under the control of guerillas and
paramilitary groups. Running on a plat
form of national security through mili
tary intervention and the empowerment
of the people, with the slogan "Firm hand
big heart," Uribe won the election de
spite his underdog status. During his
eight years in power, Uribe was able to
cut the country's kidnapping rate
which ranked among the world's highest
in 2002 by 90 percent.
"He brought a feeling of security to the
minds of the Colombian people," said
Clara Gomez, a Colombian expatriate liv
ing in the U.S., of Uribe's accomplish
ments during his presidency. "The work he
did was invaluable, and it allowed Colom
bians to start living their lives again."
"We were once more able to go back
and visit friends and family; it was coming
back to a totally different country,"
Gomez added.
During Uribe's tenure as president, a
significant part of the Colombian popula
tion rose out of poverty, and economic
growth enabled Colombia to reach its cur

rent position as South America's third
fastest growing economy.
Uribe appealed to other Latin Ameri
can countries to learn from the experience
of Colombia in solving their own problems

of lawlessness and stagnation. When ques
tioned about the security concerns raised
by drug trafficking in Northern Mexico,
Uribe argued that his Mexican conserva
tive counterpart, President Felipe

Calderon, who delivered the 2011 Stan
ford Commencement address, did an ex
cellent job battling the drug cartels. He
noted, however, that some of Calderon's
policies had to be adjusted.
Publio Adrianza 'l5, who was born in
Venezuela and moved to Guadalajara,
Mexico, noted that Calderon's main prob
lem was the ability to harness the power of
the people as Uribe did.
"The Mexican people don't have the
same faith in the government as did the
Colombians," Adrianza said. "They're not
convinced by what Calderon is doing."
Uribe acknowledged that the criticism
leveled against his government for human
rights violations and forced internal dis
placement of civilians is valid. He noted,
however, that some of the methods em
ployed were necessary to reach the state of
relative security that the country enjoys
today.
Uribe pointed to the bombings of the
Ecuadorian rainforest and the ensuing
diplomatic crisis as an example of the
harsh strategies needed to provide securi
ty-
One of the factors that Uribe described
as key to winning the trust of the people
was perseverance. He explained that he
had to make tough decisions that put him
under intense public scrutiny. Although
Uribe said he questioned at these pivotal
moments whether what he was doing was
right, he decided for the sake of consisten
cy and integrity to maintain his course, he
said.
Adrianza responded favorably to
Uribe's speech.
"His ideas are great, and the persever
ance he showed in staying true to his be
liefs, as well as the great faith he showed in
his people through the way he harnessed
their truthful energy and power, is just
what the Mexican people need as they go
to the polls this summer," Cerqueira said.
The Mexican general election will be
held on Sunday, July 1,2012.
