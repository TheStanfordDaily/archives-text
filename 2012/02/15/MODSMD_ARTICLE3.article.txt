## Palo Alto City Council approves Ronald McDonald expansion at Stanford 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ileana Najarro 
The Palo Alto City Council voted 6-0 Monday to add
a three-story complex to the Ronald McDonald House
at Stanford, more than doubling its size in hopes of meet
ing a growing demand for space.
The Ronald McDonald House, a nonprofit organiza
tion located at 520 Sand Hill Road, provides temporary
lodging for children receiving treatment at Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital for life-threatening illness
es, in addition to providing housing for their families.
The accepted proposal would add a 68-bed facility in
cluding a kitchen, dining room, laundry facilities and
other activity rooms. The addition would meet the needs
identified in an outside study commissioned by the non
profit and the children's hospital, which estimated that
60 to 70 more beds were necessary.
For nine years, the nonprofit has had to turn away 30
to 40 families a day due to the lack of available rooms
and an extended length of stay ranging from six to 24
days.
According to the an article in the Palo Alto Daily
News, council members said they were moved by the
heartfelt stories shared by patients, staff members and
volunteers of the hardships families face when turned
away from the facility.
While the proposal has been approved, the project
must still undergo a series of public hearings to win full
approval.
