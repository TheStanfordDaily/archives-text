### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ileana Najarro 
Sixteen domestic violence-related deaths in Santa
Clara County were reported in 2011, according to the
Santa Clara County Domestic Violence Council Death
Review Committee, which revealed the statistics Tuesday.
The 2011 total represents the high
est number since 21 deaths were
reported in 2003.
The committee typically releas
es the annual report on Valentine's
Day.
Of the county's 57 total homi
cides last year, 11 were domestic
violence-related, and six of the 11
involved guns.
The five non-homicide, domes
tic violence-related deaths were
all cases in which a domestic vio
lence suspect committed suicide.
In an article in the San Jose
Mercury News, Steven Dick, chair
of the Death Review Committee,
highlighted the importance of re
moving firearms from abusers
with restraining orders filed
against them.
One of the reported gun cases
involved Imad Ed Daou shooting
his 22-year-old son, Andrew, in his
sleep last summer with a .38 cal
iber Smith & Wesson revolver and
then committing suicide only
three weeks after receiving a re
straining order from his ex-wife.
Carmen Flamady Daou.
"It is time to take weapons out
of abusers' hands," Carmen said in
an article in the Mountain View
Voice.
In light of the increasing in
volvement of firearms in domestic
violence-related killings, Dick an
nounced a new policy in which
abusers with protective or re
straining orders will be asked to
surrender firearms and weapons
immediately instead of waiting 24
hours.
Dick said that in 2011, the end
ing of a relationship as in
Daou's case was a common
theme in domestic violence-relat
ed killings.
According to the committee,
the murders and suspected killers
in the reported cases crossed all
ethnic, socioeconomic and gender
lines.
