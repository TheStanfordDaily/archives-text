### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER DESK EDITOR 
"Human trafficking is a growing
problem nationally and globally, and
public awareness is an essential part of
any solution," declared Anne Gal
lagher, director of the Asia Regional
Trafficking in Persons Project, during a
panel discussion on the topic Tuesday
evening at the Bechtel Conference
Center.
Mexico has become a major desti
nation for human trafficking and a
supplier of human sex slaves to the
United States, according to Rosi Oroz
co, a Mexican congresswoman who
joined Gallagher in the discussion.
Orozco has supported proposed legis
lation in Mexico to curb human traf
ficking a practice she said is often
promoted by drug cartels and organ
ized crime syndicates because of the
huge profits generated.
"Trafficking isn't going away," Gal
lagher said. "We don't seem to be get

One of the reasons that human traf

ficking has been such an intractable
problem, Gallagher added, is that it is
"woven into the fabric of the global
economy. Trafficking fits into migra-

tion [patterns] and trade regimes
that free up the movement of
goods and services."
According to Gallagher, one of
the historic problems in controlling
the crisis has been the lack of a con
sistently applied definition of
human trafficking. In 1998, when
she began working on the issue,
"there wasn't even an internation
al legal agreement on what traf
ficking was," she said.
"How dramatically things have
changed," Gallagher noted. "We
now have a treaty and a definition
replicated in almost every country
in the world."
Gallagher said an important
step in addressing human traffick
ing was a shift in perspective on the
issue within the international com
munity. The topic, previously dis
cussed only in the context of
human rights, is now frequently ad
dressed in conjunction with efforts

to control drugs and crime. The
United Nations passed a treaty in
2000 barring the practice and giv
ing the U.N. Office on Drugs and
Crime responsibility for imple
menting the latest protocol.
However, a number of issues
and obstacles continue to pose
challenges to ending the practice,
Gallagher said.

"Now the concern is that the
definition is possibly too broad and
can include forced marriage or
pornography, which was not what
the drafters planned in 2000," Gal
lagher noted.
When human trafficking laws
are expanded to attempt to control
peripheral areas, it can dilute the
effectiveness of anti-trafficking
laws, she suggested.
Orozco emphasized the toll of
human trafficking.
"I think of human trafficking as
slavery," she said.
Addressing the plight of
women and children forced into
prostitution, Orozco added, "even
in their minds they are slaves." As a
result, Orozco said that human
trafficking should be a crime that is
"highly punished in every state."
Gallagher emphasized the im
portance of pragmatic solutions to
the crisis.
"We need specialized police
and prosecutors, [since this is] a
crime that is impossible to prose
cute without the victim's ap
proval," she said. She stressed the
need "to bring victims into the
criminal justice system."
Noting that the issue has be
come "very politicized," Gallagher
urged the audience "to draw on dif
ferent perspectives." She stressed
the importance for Stanford stu

dents "to think critically and to be
discerning about what they take in
and what they believe."
The members of the Stanford
community in attendance voiced
concern for the plight of victims of
human trafficking.
"I decided to attend this talk be
cause I wanted to learn more about
human rights violations and what I
can do in my daily life to bring
awareness to this issue," Makeda
Morrison 'l5 said. "I believe that as
a consumer tied into the world
market, it is my obligation to be
knowledgeable about human traf
ficking."
Helen Stacy, coordinator of the
program on human rights at the
Freeman Spogli Institute for Inter
national Studies, introduced and
mediated the panel discussion,
which was sponsored by the Cen
ter on Democracy, Development,
and the Rule of Law (CDDRL).
The presentation was part of
the Stanford Program on Human
Rights, a quarter-long series focus
ing on human trafficking as global
slavery.
