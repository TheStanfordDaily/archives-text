## Vaden addresses birth control pill recall 
### LINDSEYTXAKEEYANG 
No Stanford-bound medicine was
included in the about 1 million packs
of birth control pills voluntarily re
called by drug manufacturer Pfizer on
Jan. 31 due to incorrect packaging,
said a Stanford health administrator.
While Vaden Health Center at Stan
ford does not carry any of the affected
medication, campus Peer Health Edu
cators (PHE) have been briefed on
how to handle the recall, wrote Robyn

Tepper, director of medical services at
Vaden, in an email to The Daily.
Brands affected by the recall in
clude Lo/Ovral-28 and generic
norgestrel/ethinyl estradiol pills. Tep
per said students who obtain their
birth control pills off-campus should
check with their pharmacies to deter
mine if their prescriptions contained
the recalled lot numbers, which can be
found online.
Late last year, a customer com
plaint prompted Pfizer to conduct an

investigation on the packaging of cer
tain brands of birth control pills. The
company concluded that an estimated
30 packs might contain the incorrect
number of active or inactive pills.
"Should we identify even one pack
age that does not meet our... stan
dards, we voluntarily recall the entire
lot," a Pfizer press release stated.
"Therefore, we have voluntarily re
called the 28 lots which is approxi-
mately 1 million packs to en
sure that any possibly impacted
product is removed from pharma
cy shelves and women who use
the product are alerted."
The affected packs typically
come with 21 white birth control
pills with active ingredients and
seven pink pills that are inert.
Due to a packaging error,
there may be too many or too few
active pills in the recalled packs.
"The main thing we've been
told is, 'Don't scare residents be
cause it's not life or death,"'West
Lagunita PHE Cassie Montoya
'l3 said. "[Students] just might
not be completely protected."
Montoya noted that because

of the color distinction between
the active and inactive pills, "If
you've been taking birth control
for awhile, then you'd know that
there's a mix-up."
According to the Pfizer press
release, "As a result of this pack
aging error, the daily regimen for
these oral contraceptives may be
incorrect and could leave women
without adequate contraception
and at risk for unintended preg
nancy."
Grace Ann Arnold, director of
global media relations for Pfizer,
downplayed the potential risk of
the mix-up in an email to The
Daily.
"In three packages out of
more than 200,000 packages in
spected by Pfizer, a single inactive
placebo pill was inadvertently re
placed with an active pill," Arnold
said. "This error, even if undetect
ed, creates no increased chance of

pregnancy and little likelihood of
other adverse health effects for
the patient."
Arnold added that in two
other instances, out of over
200,000 packages inspected, only
one of the missing pills was an ac
tive one. Missing one day of an ac
tive pill, she noted, only slightly
increases the risk of pregnancy.
"In no instance was more than
a single pill found to be out of
place, and in no instance were the
placebo or active pills tainted in
any way," Arnold said.
According to the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)
Birth Control Guide, even prop
erly packaged pills may not be 100
percent effective: five out of 100
women who use oral contracep
tives may still get pregnant.
