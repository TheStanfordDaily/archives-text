feeling suited for a leading researcher on happiness.
Jennifer Aaker Ph.D. '95, the General Atlantic Profes
sor of Marketing at the GSB, is a social psychologist and
marketer. Her research is centered on the science and data behind
pursuing personal happiness. An iPhone application designed by
Aaker now allows users to track and analyze their happiness.
"Rather than trying to be happy or get happier, we work to design
environments that enable happiness," Aaker said of her team's work.
After receiving her doctorate in marketing from the GSB in 1995,
the happiness expert became interested in the relationship between
emotions and goals. In her studies of mixed emotions, she discovered
that negative emotions are often both functional and beneficial.
"We actually have some newer work that shows that people like
feeling mixed emotional appeals because it reflects real life," Aaker
said.
Aaker looked at the type of goals people pursue and how they pur
sue them, comparing the effectiveness of a variety of goals across differ
ent cultures. This research on both emotions and goals laid the ground
work for her larger stream of work on time, money and happiness.
Aaker published "The Time-Ask Effect: The Happiness of Giv
ing" in 2008 with co-writer Wendy Liu, assistant professor of market
ing at UCLA. The pair looked into participant willingness to donate
to charitable causes by comparing participant response to requests
for time with response to requests for money.
"We found that when you ask for money first, people step away,"
Aaker said. "But not if you ask them for their time."
According to Aaker's findings, people believed in a link between
happiness and donating time, and as a result were more inclined to
donate their time. This led Aaker to an even broader finding the
idea that happiness can be a mechanism that fuels action.
"The idea that something will make you happy drives powerful
decision making," Aaker said.
Aaker began to research how the meaning of personal happiness
changes as one ages. Along with Sep Kamvar from the Institute for
Computational and Mathematical Engineering at Stanford and
Cassie Mogilner from The Wharton School of the University of Penn
sylvania, Aaker identified two primary types of happiness excited
happiness and calm happiness.
Kamvar, Mogilner and Aaker found that the younger generation
defines happiness as excitement, while the older generation defines it
as calmness.
"Our research suggests that you have to define the context
their culture, their age, their setting," Aaker said. "Once you know
that, you can define happiness."
As a result, definitions of happiness shift in regular ways depend
ing on context. However, Aaker said, this does not mean that one's
happiness cannot be manipulated. She described an exercise in which
the experimenter used "small manipulations" to collect information

on varying definitions of happiness. Subjects were asked to breathe
deeply or focus on the present for a given period of time, and were
then asked what happiness meant to them.
"Your meaning of happiness can shift, and you, as a 17-, 18- or 19-
year-old, will start to view happiness as [a] 40-year-old [would],"
Aaker said.
Students can thus take control of their happiness levels to make

the most informed decisions. When
caught up in a moment of angst-rid
den excitement, Aaker recom
mends adopting a frame where
happiness and peacefulness are
more equated.
"I would expect individuals who
are more conscious of these two
states and who recognize their in
fluence would make better deci
sions," Aaker said. "Would that
make them happier overall? I'm
not sure."
Aaker's approach to happiness
differs from the clinical work done
by Dr. Fred Luskin from the Stan
ford Prevention Research Center
and Carole Pertofsky, director of
wellness and health promotion
services.
Luskin and Pertofsky teach a
class on happiness, whereas Aaker's
work focuses on designing compa
nies and brands with happiness in
mind. Students taking her GSB
course this quarter, Designing Hap
piness, take a very data-driven ap
proach to happiness, with market
ing as the main concern.
"What we try to do ... is give
students first-hand knowledge of
these types of insights and enable
them to analyze data," Aaker said.
"This in turn helps them design

stronger companies and brands."
Aaker's new iPhone application, the Designing Happiness Tool
Kit, makes quantifying happiness accessible. Users take a "moment
of happiness" and quantify it on a ten-point scale.
"Your stream starts to collect your moments of happiness all
geo-tagged and time-tagged," Aaker said. "Eventually, you can start
to see this interface and collect all your happy moments."
"A lot of times you walk around not knowing whether you're
happy or not," she added. "Just taking a moment of happiness makes
people recognize, 'Oh yeah, I am happy right now!'"
