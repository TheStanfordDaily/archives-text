## Stanford's Wiennese tradition 
### ASIACHIAO 
Billowing floor-length gowns,
sharp tuxedos, a classical waltz
played by a live orchestra and
couples turning in graceful uni
son in a classical ballroom the
scene could have jumped straight from the
pages of "Pride and Prejudice," from a time
when gentlemen asked to be added to a
lady's programme du bal and romance
blossomed on polished dance floors. For
the participants in the 35th Viennese Ball
held last Friday, social dance is still very
much a part of modern life.
Held every year during winter quarter,
the Viennese Ball is a formal event for which
attendees dress up and participate in dances
including waltz, swing, cha cha, salsa, tango
and polka. Two separate ballrooms, one for
classical waltz and the other for tango and
salsa, cater to different dance styles and mu
sical tastes, and attendees can move between
the rooms throughout the night.
Stanford's tradition of holding an annu
al Viennese Ball first began in 1978, when
students returning from the Stanford in
Austria program organized the event in
order to bring Viennese culture and social
dance to campus. Since then, despite the
closure of the overseas study program, the
annual ball has become a Stanford tradi
tion. An event that draws students, alumni
and social dance enthusiasts from all over
the Bay Area, this year the organizers ex
pected 500 to 700 attendees.
The planning process for the event usu
ally begins the June of the previous year,
with new committee members recruited at
the start of fall quarter. The "Am Abend"
committee a German term meaning
"the night of" is responsible for organiz
ing the logistics of the event itself, while the

opening committee plans and performs the
ball's opening dance, consisting of 18 cou
ples performing a carefully choreographed
Viennese waltz. The dancer's white gowns
and tuxedos pay homage to the event's Eu
ropean origins.
"The opening ceremonies have re
mained unchanged for some time," said
Rosalind Boone 'lO, one of the co-chairs of
the "Am Abend" committee. "The dress,
even the number of couples in the opening
has remained remarkably constant over the
years."
While the Ball is open to all students,
some basic dance knowledge is necessary
for participation. As a remedy to the Stan
ford population's general unfamiliarity
with formal dance steps, the Austria Fort
night was born. During the two weeks lead
ing up to the event, the organizing commit
tee holds a series of free dance workshops
on campus, introducing novices to the basic
skills of social dance.
To overcome what the organizers be
lieve to be a major deterrent to student at
tendance â€” personal doubts about dance
inexperience the Ball initiated the Gold
Ribbon Program this year. Experienced
dancers can volunteer to wear gold ribbons
around their wrist on the night of the event,
offering to lead and instruct less experi
enced dancers. The program hopes to en
courage new dancers to attend the event.
"The great thing about the dance com
munity here is that even though I've never
taken a class, I've learned a lot through peo
ple who are willing to teach," said Lauren
Sweet 'l5, who attended the Ball for the
first time this year.
The association of "formal ball" with
"romance" seems to hold true in the case of
the Viennese Ball.
"Every year we have at least five to six
couples on the opening committee ...

most of whom met through dancing," said
M.J. Ma 'l2, one of two head chairs.
While couples may enjoy the romantic
aspect of the Viennese Ball, it presents an
other major deterrent for Stanford stu
dents: the idea that a partner is necessary in
order to attend. The organizers hope to

change this perception by encouraging peo
ple to switch dance companions while at the
Ball.

"People have a misconception that you
need a date to go to the dance," Ma said. "In
fact, while at the Ball you can dance with
people you've never met before, and more
often than not you'll end up connecting
through dancing."
Richard Powers '7O, dance instructor
and historian, said he feels that Stanford
community members, in contrast to many
ballroom dancers, appreciate social dance
as a form of social interaction, not as a rigid
set of regulations.
"Social dancing is primarily for the fun
and pleasure of your partner, and if what
you're doing isn't fun for yourself and your
partner, you're missing the point," Powers
said. "Stanford students understand that."
More casual opportunities to perfect
one's waltz and swing are available. In addi
tion to the social dance classes offered by
Powers, many other social dance events are
held regularly on campus. Jammix, a cam
pus-wide dance event that includes all
forms of social dance, is held on the second
Friday of every month, while Monday night
"Dancebreak" and "Friday Night Waltz"
also provide students with opportunities to
brush up on their two-step or tango.
Perhaps social events like the Viennese
Ball really are relics of an older age, con
trasting greatly with the fast pace of most
dances on campus today, but organizers, at
tendees and alumni all believe the Ball of
fers a certain uniqueness.
"It's a very dramatic departure from
anything else you'll do at Stanford," Boone
said. "There are other events, and there's
the class formal, but none of them have the
same otherworldliness."
