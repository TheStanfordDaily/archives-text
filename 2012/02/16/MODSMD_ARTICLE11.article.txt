# Night Outreach CONNECTING WITH THE HOMELESS
## 
### ALYA NAQVI 
Night Outreach, a Stanford community service
group committed to establishing relation
ships with the homeless community of Palo
Alto, celebrated the opening of the first
women's-only homeless shelter program in
Palo Alto last week. The shelter, a joint effort between
Night Outreach and Innvision, the largest housing
provider in Santa Clara County, is a new addition to the
only homeless shelter program in Palo Alto, Hotel de
Zink.
In the new program, the Stanford students in Night
Outreach will be "running everything on the ground," ac
cording to Brenda Mutuma 'l3, the group's food and meal
coordinator.
Night Outreach members raised approximately
$22,000 to fund the project. In addition to receiving grants,
they set up an online donation system, collected donations
around campus and organized two fundraising drives with
The Counter and Panda Express.
Night Outreach members were inspired by the Har
vard Square Homeless Shelter, a Harvard University stu
dent-run shelter that has been in operation for 28 years,
providing protection from the cold winter. Night Out
reach decided to partner with Hotel de Zink to launch a
similar project in the Palo Alto community.
The 15-bed Hotel de Zink shelter rotates through 12
area churches. Each church houses 12 to 17 people for one
month. The women's shelter will be an extension of the
same format. Hotel de Zink has provided the new shelter
with case managers, some of its overnight staff and train
ing. Case managers select residents and help them find
jobs and services. Night Outreach is responsible for pro
viding the rest of the resources.
In her role as food and meal coordinator, Mutuma has
responsibilities such as ensuring that meals reach the shel
ter on time and finding volunteers to cook meals. As a po
litical science major, she is particularly interested in food
policy, hunger politics and food security.
"Food is that one thing that everybody needs to sur
vive, so why should anyone be deprived of that?" Mutu
ma said. "When you share food with someone, that's an
other opportunity for learning about someone, for

learning about yourself."
The women's shelter program is an expansion of Night
Outreach's efforts to interact with the local homeless
community. For the past ten years, members and any other
Stanford affiliates have participated in weekly Night Out
reach walks. The group goes to downtown Palo Alto to en
gage with the homeless community, "with the belief that
compassion and conversation are just as important as
food and shelter," according to the Night Outreach mis
sion.
The conversations vary in topic and length.
"[We talk about] whatever they want to talk about,
whatever we want to talk about," Mutuma said. "People
have an issue about how uncomfortable it might be, but
it's beautiful, a lot of the times. You run into a lot of their
own personal stories that are really touching."
The organization challenges participants to overcome

prejudices and stereotypes through joining the Night Out
reach walks, Mutuma said.
"When you stay in the Stanford bubble, you don't get
any exposure to what the world is really like, everything
that the world has to offer and everything that everybody
has to offer no matter their socioeconomic status," Mutu
ma added.
On one of the walks, Kurt von Laven 'l2, Night Out
reach webmaster, met a man sitting in the corner of the
train tracks, listening to the radio.
"He said that it made him feel connected to the world,"
von Laven said. "That really struck me because it didn't
seem like something that would make me feel that way. It
made me wonder how isolating his experiences had
been."
Members of Night Outreach also frequently visit the
Opportunity Center, a local service provider for the
homeless. At the Center, they lead activities such as art
workshops for children and computer training programs.
"The biggest challenge for us, but also the most reward
ing, is that it's hard to know who's going to be there," von
Laven said. "We try to make it very clear that we're com
ing back, and that's why it's very important for us when
we're recruiting volunteers to make sure they are able to
make that kind of a commitment."
This commitment to the homeless population of Palo
Alto is a central tenet of Night Outreach.
"I'm walking into this very humbled," Mutuma said of
her work with the women's shelter at Hotel de Zink. "It's
all a learning opportunity and it's a ... thank you to the
members of the [homeless] community."

seem like something that would make me feel that way. It
made me wonder how isolating his experiences had
been."
Members of Night Outreach also frequently visit the
Opportunity Center, a local service provider for the
homeless. At the Center, they lead activities such as art
workshops for children and computer training programs.
"The biggest challenge for us, but also the most reward
ing, is that it's hard to know who's going to be there," von
Laven said. "We try to make it very clear that we're com
ing back, and that's why it's very important for us when
we're recruiting volunteers to make sure they are able to
make that kind of a commitment."
This commitment to the homeless population of Palo
Alto is a central tenet of Night Outreach.
"I'm walking into this very humbled," Mutuma said of
her work with the women's shelter at Hotel de Zink. "It's
all a learning opportunity and it's a ... thank you to the
members of the [homeless] community."

Night Outreach, a Stanford community service
group committed to establishing relation
ships with the homeless community of Palo
Alto, celebrated the opening of the first
women's-only homeless shelter program in
Palo Alto last week. The shelter, a joint effort between
Night Outreach and Innvision, the largest housing
provider in Santa Clara County, is a new addition to the
only homeless shelter program in Palo Alto, Hotel de
Zink.
In the new program, the Stanford students in Night
Outreach will be "running everything on the ground," ac
cording to Brenda Mutuma 'l3, the group's food and meal
coordinator.
Night Outreach members raised approximately
$22,000 to fund the project. In addition to receiving grants,
they set up an online donation system, collected donations
around campus and organized two fundraising drives with
The Counter and Panda Express.
Night Outreach members were inspired by the Har
vard Square Homeless Shelter, a Harvard University stu
dent-run shelter that has been in operation for 28 years,
providing protection from the cold winter. Night Out
reach decided to partner with Hotel de Zink to launch a
similar project in the Palo Alto community.
The 15-bed Hotel de Zink shelter rotates through 12
area churches. Each church houses 12 to 17 people for one
month. The women's shelter will be an extension of the
same format. Hotel de Zink has provided the new shelter
with case managers, some of its overnight staff and train
ing. Case managers select residents and help them find
jobs and services. Night Outreach is responsible for pro
viding the rest of the resources.
In her role as food and meal coordinator, Mutuma has
responsibilities such as ensuring that meals reach the shel
ter on time and finding volunteers to cook meals. As a po
litical science major, she is particularly interested in food
policy, hunger politics and food security.
"Food is that one thing that everybody needs to sur
vive, so why should anyone be deprived of that?" Mutu
ma said. "When you share food with someone, that's an
other opportunity for learning about someone, for

learning about yourself."
The women's shelter program is an expansion of Night
Outreach's efforts to interact with the local homeless
community. For the past ten years, members and any other
Stanford affiliates have participated in weekly Night Out
reach walks. The group goes to downtown Palo Alto to en
gage with the homeless community, "with the belief that
compassion and conversation are just as important as
food and shelter," according to the Night Outreach mis
sion.
The conversations vary in topic and length.
"[We talk about] whatever they want to talk about,
whatever we want to talk about," Mutuma said. "People
have an issue about how uncomfortable it might be, but
it's beautiful, a lot of the times. You run into a lot of their
own personal stories that are really touching."
The organization challenges participants to overcome

prejudices and stereotypes through joining the Night Out
reach walks, Mutuma said.
"When you stay in the Stanford bubble, you don't get
any exposure to what the world is really like, everything
that the world has to offer and everything that everybody
has to offer no matter their socioeconomic status," Mutu
ma added.
On one of the walks, Kurt von Laven 'l2, Night Out
reach webmaster, met a man sitting in the corner of the
train tracks, listening to the radio.
"He said that it made him feel connected to the world,"
von Laven said. "That really struck me because it didn't
seem like something that would make me feel that way. It
made me wonder how isolating his experiences had
been."
