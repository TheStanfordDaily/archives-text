# OPINIONS
## MODERN MANNERS Our journey to greatness 
### Jeff Mandell 
When I was in Florence last
quarter, I took a bus to
the outskirts of the city,
where I had found the only base
ball diamond around. I was meet
ing with the coach of a local club
to find out if I could play with
them for a couple months. Since
baseball barely exists in Europe, I
had no idea what to expect in
terms of atmosphere or level of
play-

It turned out that I wasn't
going to play any baseball in Flo
rence. Somewhere along the line,
the Italian coach had somehow
gotten the mistaken impression
that I was going to be in the coun
try for three years, not three
months. But before we discovered
the misunderstanding, his first
question for me upon our meeting
was, in Italian, "How many cham
pionships have you won?" The
question has haunted me ever
since.

I'm pretty sure he was not re
ferring to World Series rings, but
beyond that, I don't know. Does T
ball count? If I had known the
word ( il T-ball ), I might have
asked. Though this was probably
the last time that I will be asked
this question in a job interview, it
is nevertheless an important one
to answer for my own peace of
mind. At some point in our lives, I
think that many of us have or will
look back on what we have ac
complished and wonder: Are we
champions, or are we failures?
I am deciding to not count T
ball because in my league —in
the spirit of fun there were no
outs and everyone was declared
the winner of every game, (How
ever, I always insisted that actual
ly only my team had won. )
Though in life there doesn't
have to be a loser for there to be a
winner, the same is not true of
sports. My last championship came
when I was fourteen, when the
Saratoga White Sox defeated the
heavily favored Red Sox in extra
innings in front of a crowd of tens.
As far as I was (and am) con
cerned, this victory was as mean
ingful as any in professional sports.
For years afterward, I honestly felt
that there was nothing more I
needed to prove to the world.
A championship is a mental
victory; it is a moment when we
feel that our actions have justified

our existence in the universe.
Being a champion is ultimately a
personal experience if you do
not feel like one, no one can make
you one but that does not stop
our society from conferring the
title on people we admire, particu
larly those who make founding
contributions to their fields. John
Muir, whose work led to the cre
ation of Yosemite National Park,
was a champion of natural beauty.
Alice Waters is a champion for
fresh, healthy food prepared from
high-quality, locally-produced in
gredients. And Aung San Suu Kyi,
who has stood up against military
dictatorship at great personal risk,
is a champion of Burmese democ
racy.

Being a World Series champion
or a Super Bowl winner may sound
insignificant in comparison, but
ranking people is not the goal here.
Life is not a contest of who is the
strongest, or the bravest or even
who can make the greatest positive
impact on the world. There
are many types of champions and
many ways to become one, most of
which don't involve fame. The first
step is dedicating yourself toward
something that is important to you,
regardless of the odds against you.
Your task might be something big,
like raising a kid well, or it could be
smaller, like writing a poem that
says something true. Or maybe it's
training secretly for weeks to final
ly beat your friend at ping-pong.
Don't spend all of your time
preparing for the future. It's bet
ter strategy to mix short- and
long-term goals so that, with luck,
you will have moments of glory
sprinkled throughout your life.
You can't deprive yourself for too
long, the soul always craves victo
ry. For optimal health, it should be
a frequent pursuit.

plaints about social life at Stanford

heavily favored Red Sox in extra
innings in front of a crowd of tens.
As far as I was (and am) con
cerned, this victory was as mean
ingful as any in professional sports.
For years afterward, I honestly felt
that there was nothing more I
needed to prove to the world.
A championship is a mental
victory; it is a moment when we
feel that our actions have justified

our existence in the universe.
Being a champion is ultimately a
personal experience if you do
not feel like one, no one can make
you one but that does not stop
our society from conferring the
title on people we admire, particu
larly those who make founding
contributions to their fields. John
Muir, whose work led to the cre
ation of Yosemite National Park,
was a champion of natural beauty.
Alice Waters is a champion for
fresh, healthy food prepared from
high-quality, locally-produced in
gredients. And Aung San Suu Kyi,
who has stood up against military
dictatorship at great personal risk,
is a champion of Burmese democ
racy.

Being a World Series champion
or a Super Bowl winner may sound
insignificant in comparison, but
ranking people is not the goal here.
Life is not a contest of who is the
strongest, or the bravest or even
who can make the greatest positive
impact on the world. There
are many types of champions and
many ways to become one, most of
which don't involve fame. The first
step is dedicating yourself toward
something that is important to you,
regardless of the odds against you.
Your task might be something big,
like raising a kid well, or it could be
smaller, like writing a poem that
says something true. Or maybe it's
training secretly for weeks to final
ly beat your friend at ping-pong.
Don't spend all of your time
preparing for the future. It's bet
ter strategy to mix short- and
long-term goals so that, with luck,
you will have moments of glory
sprinkled throughout your life.
You can't deprive yourself for too
long, the soul always craves victo
ry. For optimal health, it should be
a frequent pursuit.
