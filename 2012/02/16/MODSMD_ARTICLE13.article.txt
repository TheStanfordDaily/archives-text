# OP-ED
## Independence in action 
### MATT GROSSMAN "13 Capital Improvements Projects Manager, Chi Theta Chi 
A week ago, Stanford in
formed Chi Theta Chi that
it would try to revoke our
home's independence. Instead,
this week's progress, and a monu
mental outpouring of support
from the University community,
have confirmed that our home's
independence is stronger than
ever before.

This week, we resolved the
minor legal technicalities the Uni
versity cited when it tried to can
cel our lease. Our kitchen passed
its county inspection. We met with
a property manager to independ
ently ensure the continued com
fort and safety of our facility. And
an independent review has con
firmed what we knew all along:
that our house and its managing
board of alumni have maintained
an impeccable fiscal record that
guarantees our co-op's stability
for decades to come.

Before last week, our staff and
residents always believed that our
house made a positive contribu
tion to the University community.
But we never knew how much it
meant to so many people. An on
line petition of support released
Tuesday afternoon gained more
than a thousand signatures in
twelve hours. Alumni and parents
from as close as San Francisco to
as far away as Hong Kong and
London joined a letter-writing
campaign last weekend, and many
more called in to express the im
portance of our house's inde
pendence to the University offi
cials who have tried to end it.

Meanwhile, our on-campus
friends in other co-ops welcomed
us into their houses early this
week to discuss Chi Theta Chi's
important role in Stanford's co-op
community, and how different our
culture would be under university

control. We think it's a role that
everyone on campus can value:
our unique arrangement adds di
versity in away that no other
house does.

Stanford always insists that it
values such residential diversity,
but its letter last week spoke truth
to a different mission. Were Chi
Theta Chi's independence re
voked, our residents' checks
would go directly into the univer
sity's coffers, and all spending au
thority would revert to university
administrators. We would lose the
freedom to order our own food,
buy our own furniture, complete
our own renovations, and provide
affordable summer housing for all
students in short, we'd lose all
the things that make our home
unique on this campus. Under
university control, Chi Theta Chi
would be the house the university
wants it to be not the house the
Stanford community has grown to
love.

If you talk to our residents or
alumni, they might sum up our
campaign in four simple words
with a long history. One day al
most a decade ago, that year's res
idents were setting out on a group
adventure. We do that a lot. To call
everyone together, someone
shouted: "Bring us with us!" It
means that it's time for everyone
to get moving, because we so dear
ly want everyone in our communi
ty along for the trip. This week,
we've realized just how big that
community is, and how much this
fight means to so many people.
Bring us with us: we have a lot
of work to do, and we'll need all
our help.
