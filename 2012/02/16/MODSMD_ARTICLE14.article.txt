# SEEING GREEN
## Here a sheep, there a sheep 
### Holly Moeller 
LINCOLN, N.Z. Acre after
acre of pastureland scrolls
by the car window as lan
Dickie an eminent fungal
ecologist croons his rendition
of "I Am Cow."

"I am Cow, hear me moo, I
weigh twice as much as you, and I
look good upon your barbecue,"
the Arrogant Worms' parody be
gins, going on to discuss "liquid
from my udder" and how
"methane gas comes out my —"
... well, you know.

The song fits a landscape
which, once covered with sheep,
has recently been converted to
dairyland. Wherever I go in New
Zealand, I seem more likely to
run into a herd of mooing milk
producers than the skittish balls
of wool the country is known for.
Once, the joke went that for
every person in New Zealand,
there were 20 sheep. Today, with a
human population around 4.5
million and a sheep population
that's been halved to 30 million,
the ratio isn't quite so impressive.
Meanwhile, the number of
dairy cattle has doubled from 3
million in 1999 to 6 million in
2009. Simultaneously, the dairy
industry has grown by 77 percent
to become New Zealand's largest
exporter.

Today, 95 percent of New
Zealand dairy products are
shipped abroad, earning over $ll
billion annually. Most go to Asia,
where the growing markets of
China and India crave a protein
rich middle class diet. A (relative
ly) near neighbour. New Zealand
is well-positioned to meet this de
mand, producing 1.5 billion kilo
grams of milk solids (shippable
concentrate produced by evapo
rating the water from milk) each
year.

This growth has piqued for
eign interest. Harvard got in on
the action last year, purchasing
the former Big Sky Dairy Farm
for $32 million. Now Chinese
firms are buying in. It's a brilliant
investment from their perspec
tive, banking on a market driven
by their own economic growth.

But locals are balking at the latest
proposed purchase of 16 Crafar
dairy farms, citing concerns about
job loss (the Chinese firm would
import labor from overseas) and
threats to environmental quality
(foreign owners don't have to live
amid their messes).

According to some, this public
disapproval stems from subtle
racism. The media here constant
ly discusses foreign takeover and
threats to New Zealand sover
eignty from Asian buyers. Yet the
biggest foreign landholders here
are United States citizens. Amer
ican nationals purchased almost
200,000 hectares of New Zealand
land in the last five years (includ
ing the Harvard farm). The Chi
nese bought a paltry 225.

It would also be a shame to
wait for foreign ownership before
acknowledging environmental
degradation. Despite New
Zealand's reputation for for
ward-thinking environmental
ism, its dairy industry is, by all ac
counts, an ecological nightmare.
Back in 2003, in a nod to the
pollution threat dairy presented,
the Ministries of Agriculture and
Environment and Fonterra
the company with a virtual mo
nopoly on milk processing
signed an "accord" basically say
ing that they would put their best
feet forward. The government
would develop regulations, and
Fonterra would use its economic
clout to sanction noncompliant
farmers.

Among other things, the ac
cord acknowledged the threat
cattle pose to waterways —by
trampling through carrying mud
and feces and vowed to fence
off 90 percent of streams by 2012.
That's this year. Needless to
say, the goal hasn't been met.
Downstream from one farm, a
popular swimming hole is regu
larly plastered with warning
signs. Lan points out the turnoff.
It's hardly unique.

Nitrous oxide the green
house gas 300 times more potent
than carbon dioxide emissions
are also up, the result of excessive

fertilizer used to milk as much
productivity from the land as pos
sible. Cows also produce
methane, a byproduct of their ru
minant digestive tract that is an
other potent greenhouse gas. And
because so many cattle are
crowded onto each field, nutrient
loads are becoming unbalanced,
leaking effluent into local water
ways and stimulating algal
blooms and eutrophication.

As we know from our own ex
periences in the United States, in
dustrial farming is an unsustain
able practice. However, trying to
regulate a growing industry
makes for equally unsustainable
politics. Still, in a country like
New Zealand, where as a func
tion of lower population densities
and an adventurous national cul
ture — people live closer to the
land, it seems possible that some
of these issues will be addressed
sooner, rather than later.
Lan closes with a rousing cho
rus of ''l Am Cow." I gaze out the
window; a black-and-white heifer
stares back.
