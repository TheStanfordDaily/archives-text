## Struggling Card back home STANFORD HOSTS OREGON SCHOOLS 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a surprisingly strong start that had
Stanford sitting atop the Pac-12, the Cardi
nal has fallen back down to earth and al
most out of NCAA tournament contention.
Stanford (17-8,7-6 Pac-12) has lost five of its
last seven games and is currently sitting at
sixth in the conference standings. While the
Card has basically played itself out of con
tention for an at-large tournament bid,
March Madness does remain a possibility.
With five conference games remaining in
the regular season, Stanford will look to im
prove its seeding for the Pac-12 Tourna
ment. Winning that tournament guarantees
Stanford a spot in the 68-team Big Dance.
The journey begins this Thursday night,
when Stanford takes on Oregon State (15-
10,5-8) in front of its home crowd in Maples
Pavilion. Coming off a much-needed win
against a banged-up USC team, Stanford
will look to rise back up the Pac-12 stand
ings with a win against the Beavers.
The first meeting between these two
teams was a quadruple-overtime marathon
in which Stanford edged out Oregon State
103-101. Freshman guard Chasson Randle
scored the go-ahead layup with 37 seconds
remaining to give the Cardinal the win. That
game was likely Randle's best of the year, as
he torched the Beavers for a game-high 24
points.

The Beavers will be looking for revenge
this time around. Leading the way for Ore
gon State is junior guard Jared Cunning
ham. Cunningham is averaging a team-high
18.8 points per game on a solid 45 percent
shooting clip. He is also one of the NCAA's

Sophomore forward Josh Huestis (above) is one of many Stanford players that has hit a rut of late. Huestis is just 2-for-14 from the field in
his past four games after being one of the team's bright spots early in the season. The Cardinal hosts the Oregon schools this weekend.
