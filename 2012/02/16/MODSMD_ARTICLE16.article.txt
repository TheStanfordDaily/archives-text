## Struggling Card back home STANFORD HOSTS OREGON SCHOOLS 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a surprisingly strong start that had
Stanford sitting atop the Pac-12, the Cardi
nal has fallen back down to earth and al
most out of NCAA tournament contention.
Stanford (17-8,7-6 Pac-12) has lost five of its
last seven games and is currently sitting at
sixth in the conference standings. While the
Card has basically played itself out of con
tention for an at-large tournament bid,
March Madness does remain a possibility.
With five conference games remaining in
the regular season, Stanford will look to im
prove its seeding for the Pac-12 Tourna
ment. Winning that tournament guarantees
Stanford a spot in the 68-team Big Dance.
The journey begins this Thursday night,
when Stanford takes on Oregon State (15-
10,5-8) in front of its home crowd in Maples
Pavilion. Coming off a much-needed win
against a banged-up USC team, Stanford
will look to rise back up the Pac-12 stand
ings with a win against the Beavers.
The first meeting between these two
teams was a quadruple-overtime marathon
in which Stanford edged out Oregon State
103-101. Freshman guard Chasson Randle
scored the go-ahead layup with 37 seconds
remaining to give the Cardinal the win. That
game was likely Randle's best of the year, as
he torched the Beavers for a game-high 24
points.

The Beavers will be looking for revenge
this time around. Leading the way for Ore
gon State is junior guard Jared Cunning
ham. Cunningham is averaging a team-high
18.8 points per game on a solid 45 percent
shooting clip. He is also one of the NCAA's

Sophomore forward Josh Huestis (above) is one of many Stanford players that has hit a rut of late. Huestis is just 2-for-14 from the field in
his past four games after being one of the team's bright spots early in the season. The Cardinal hosts the Oregon schools this weekend.
best defenders, as his 2.8 steals per
game is the fifth-best mark in the
entire country. However, in the
teams' first meeting, Cunningham
went an abysmal 4-for-16 from
the field. He will look to avenge
this performance on Thursday.
Sophomore forward Devon
Collier has played well since as
suming a starting role. Collier, the
Beavers' second-leading scorer at
13.2 points per game, is shooting a
phenomenal 62.4 percent from
the field. At 6-foot-7, his speed
and quickness present a matchup
nightmare for opposing forwards.
Oregon State is coming off a
crushing home defeat at the
hands of the first-place Washing
ton Huskies after the Beavers
couldn't pull off the upset and
overcome a two-point deficit with
just 22 seconds remaining. After
this loss, the Beavers will look to
make a statement against the
Cardinal. A win on Thursday
would put them just a game be
hind Stanford. The Card will look
to hold off the Beavers' attack,
stepping up defensively in a criti
cal matchup of mid-tier Pac-12
teams.
On Sunday, the Oregon Ducks
(18-7, 9-4 Pac-12) roll into town
for a game that will have major
tournament-seeding implica
tions. The Ducks are currently
two games ahead of the Card, but
a win here would give Stanford a
very realistic shot of overtaking
them in the conference standings.
Unlike on Thursday night, the
Card will be the team looking to
even the season score after the
Ducks handed Stanford its first
conference loss on Jan. 5. In that
game, Oregon guard Devoe
Joseph went off, torching Stan
ford for a career-high 30 points.
The Card will look to keep Joseph
in check this time around, as the
senior guard has been the leading
man in Oregon's offensive attack
this year, averaging a team-high
15.7 points per game to go along
with 2.9 assists. Joseph's stellar
play is a large reason why the
Ducks are currently only a game
out of first place in the Pac-12.
Joseph isn't the only senior
running the show for Oregon. Fel
low guard Garrett Sim has con
tributed to Oregon's offensive
success, averaging 12 points and
almost three assists per game. The
two seniors have fed off each
other all year and will surely look
to do the same on Sunday night.
As the regular season nears its
end, every game becomes more
important for the Card. After los
ing some ground in the Pac-12
standings, Stanford will need a
few wins down the stretch to
make up ground. A pair of victo
ries this weekend would boost
both Stanford's tournament seed
ing and its confidence going into
postseason play.
Tip-off for the Oregon State
game is tonight at 7 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.
