# STANFORD ROLLS TO END OF ROAD TRIP
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
The fourth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team is hoping
to continue on its roll this week
end in Southern California, as
the team tries to extend its win
ning streak past five matches.
Wrapping up the ninth and 10th
matches of a long 10-match road
stretch, Stanford (9-2, 6-1
MPSF) will take on No. 2 UC-
Irvine (9-2, 5-2) on Friday night
before playing UC-San Diego
(3-9,1-6) on Saturday.
The Cardinal has an opportu
nity to move into a tie for first
place with a sweep this week
end, thanks to a suddenly friend
ly Long Beach State team upset
ting top-ranked UCLA on Tues
day night. With 11 of the team's
final 13 matches at home, this
weekend signifies a terrific op
portunity for the Cardinal to

seize control of the MPSF race.
The good news for those hop
ing the Cardinal will claim the
MPSF title? Stanford has been
playing at a high level lately,
winning its past five matches all
on the road. The Cardinal's at
tack features the reigning Na
tional Player of the Week in sen
ior outside hitter Brad Lawson
and the past two MPSF Players
of the Week in Lawson and
sophomore outside hitter
Steven Irvin.
Stanford also comes off a
weekend sweep that allowed the
team to exorcise some of its re
cent demons. The Cardinal
snapped a three-match losing
streak against Long Beach State
before winning for just the sev
enth time in 23 tries against Cal
State Northridge, The Cardinal

The No. 4 Stanford men's volleyball team has been on a tear the past
few weeks, winning five straight matches on the road. The Cardinal
will look to cap its 10-match road trip with two wins this weekend.
of Lawson, who was named Na
tional Player of the Week follow
ing a combined 40-kill effort in
the two matches. In addition to
Lawson, Stanford's middle block
ers, senior Gus Ellis and sopho
more Eric Mochalski, were par
ticularly effective against LBSU,
combining for 16 kills and a .625
hitting percentage. Sophomore
outside hitter Brian Cook was the
man who stepped up for the Car
dinal against Northridge, finish
ing with a career-high 26 kills in
Stanford's four-set match.
For all of Stanford's recent
success, the matches this week
end, especially on Friday, will not
be a walk in the park. UC-Irvine
features a two-headed attack in
senior Carson Clark and sopho
more Jeremy Dejno. Both aver
age over three kills per set and
maintain a hitting percentage
above .300. The Anteaters also
come into the match just as hot as
Stanford, winners of five in a row,
including a road sweep of No. 13
Hawaii last weekend. Prior to
Tuesday night, UCI was the only
team this season to have beaten
UCLA, a team that swept the
Cardinal back on Jan. 20. The
Anteaters only two losses this
season came at the hands of
BYU, a team UCI had already
beaten earlier in the season.
Regardless of what happens

to the Cardinal on Friday night,
the team will need to come out
focused and ready to play on Sat
urday. A year ago, this very same
UC-San Diego team swept Stan
ford at home, a loss the Cardinal
certainly has not forgotten. The
Tritons are lead by redshirt junior
Carl Eberts and sophomore Vaun
Lennon, who both average better
than 2.9 kills per set.
UCSD comes into the week
end having struggled thus far this
season. The Tritons were swept at
home last weekend and are actu
ally winless at home this year,
which has contributed to their 3-
9 record and a current last-place
standing in the MPSF. This does
not mean, however, that the Tri
tons are not capable of pulling off
the upset. UCSD pushed No. 3
BYU to five sets last Saturday
before falling in the fifth.
"This weekend is a huge op
portunity that you don't get in
very many lifetimes and would be
a huge boost of confidence and a
catalyst to keep playing strong,"
Irvin said. "I think the best part
would be to be No. 1 at the end of
our rigorous five-week road
trip."
Stanford will play UC-Irvine
on Friday at 7 p.m. before taking
on UC-San Diego at the same
time on Saturday. These are Stan
ford's final two matches in a 10-
match road stretch before the
team returns home for six straight
on the Farm.
