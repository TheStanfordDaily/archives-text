Irvine (9-2, 5-2) on Friday night
before playing UC-San Diego
(3-9,1-6) on Saturday.
The Cardinal has an opportu
nity to move into a tie for first
place with a sweep this week
end, thanks to a suddenly friend
ly Long Beach State team upset
ting top-ranked UCLA on Tues
day night. With 11 of the team's
final 13 matches at home, this
weekend signifies a terrific op
portunity for the Cardinal to

seize control of the MPSF race.
