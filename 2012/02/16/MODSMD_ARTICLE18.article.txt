# CARD ON VERGE OF PAC-12 TITLE
## 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team travels to Corvallis,
Ore., tonight with a chance to
clinch the inaugural Pac-12 title,
and its 12th straight conference
title overall. Should the Cardinal
defeat Oregon State, it will be
guaranteed at least a share of the
trophy with four games to go, and
Stanford can claim the title out
right if second-place Cal loses to
Oregon in Eugene,
This week, the Cardinal (22-1,
13-0 Pac-12) moved up to No. 3 in
the nation as a result of Notre
Dame's 65-63 loss to West Vir
ginia on Sunday.The team enters
tonight's game undefeated in its
last 70 conference games, on a
24-game winning streak against
the Beavers (17-7,8-5) and lead
ing the all-time series 48-6. With
last weekend's sweep of the

Southern California schools, it
also guaranteed it can't finish
outside of the top four in confer
ence and thus received a bye to
the quarterfinals of March's Pac
-12 Tournament in Los Angeles.
However, playing Oregon
State at home may prove a tricky
proposition. After finishing dead
last with a 2-16 conference
record last season and starting
slowly this year, head coach Scott
Rueck has turned this team
around in his second year at the
helm. The Beavers are now on a
six-game winning streak and cur
rently sit in third place. A strong
finish in the last five games of the
regular season could lift OSU
above Cal and possibly give the
Beavers an at-large berth into
the NCAA Tournament.
As if that was not motivation
enough for the Beavers, they

Sophomore forward Chiney Ogwumike (above) and her sister,
senior forward Nnemkadi, dominated Oregon State in the teams'
first meeting this year, a narrow 67-60 Stanford home victory. The
Cardinal and Beavers will square off again tonight in Corvallis, Ore.
know that, except for UConn and
Cal, they are the team that pushed
the Card closest all season, nar
rowly losing 67-60 at Maples Pavil
ion back in early January. There
were nine lead changes in that con
test and the score was tied a total
of 10 times. Oregon State held a
four-point lead over Stanford at
the half but could not quite hold
on for the upset.
The Beavers' top performers in
January's game were guards Ali
Gibson, Alyssa Martin and
Earlysia Marchbanks, with 16
points and six rebounds, 12 and
four and 12 and three, respectively.
Coming into tonight's game, Ore
gon State may be looking to the
same players; Gibson and March

banks currently lead OSU with av
erages of 12.5 and 12.0 points and
4.0 and 7.0 rebounds, respectively.
Two factors that made the cru
cial difference for Stanford the last
time it met Oregon State were the
Ogwumike sisters and fouls. On
their way to a pair of double-dou
bles, senior forward Nnemkadi
and sophomore forward Chiney
combined for 53 points and 26 re
bounds to lift the Card clear of the
Beavers.
OSU also committed 16 fouls
in comparison to Stanford's eight,
sending the Card to the charity
stripe 12 more times than the
Beavers, allowing Stanford to hold
a 12-point advantage on free
throws. This difference was crucial
because the final game-winning
margin was just seven. From the
floor, OSU had a considerably bet
ter shooting percentage, 49 per
cent compared to 36.4 percent, hit
ting one more field goal than the

Card and three more three-point
ers, and it is clear that fouls, and
free throws, won the game for
Stanford.
This time around, Oregon State
will need to repeat the physical
performance that kept most of the
Cardinal players quiet, but with
out sending Stanford to the free
throw line so often or letting the
Ogwumikes catch fire. The bad
news for the Beavers, though, is
that since that game, head coach
Tara VanDerveer has been able to
count on major contributions from
other parts of her team. While
OSU has turned its season around,
the Cardinal too has improved in
the last month and a half.The team
that travels to Corvallis tonight is
almost certainly better than the
one that narrowly won at the be
ginning of the year.
After the contest against OSU,
Stanford will move on to Eugene
to face the Oregon Ducks at
lunchtime on Saturday. Regard
less of results elsewhere, if the Car
dinal can engineer a sweep of the
Oregon schools it will be guaran
teed the Pac-12 regular-season
title with three games still to play.
Tonight's clash with the
Beavers tips off at 7 p.m. in Corval
lis.

the quarterfinals of March's Pac
-12 Tournament in Los Angeles.
However, playing Oregon
State at home may prove a tricky
proposition. After finishing dead
last with a 2-16 conference
record last season and starting
slowly this year, head coach Scott
Rueck has turned this team
around in his second year at the
helm. The Beavers are now on a
six-game winning streak and cur
rently sit in third place. A strong
finish in the last five games of the
regular season could lift OSU
above Cal and possibly give the
Beavers an at-large berth into
the NCAA Tournament.

Sophomore forward Chiney Ogwumike (above) and her sister,
senior forward Nnemkadi, dominated Oregon State in the teams'
first meeting this year, a narrow 67-60 Stanford home victory. The
Cardinal and Beavers will square off again tonight in Corvallis, Ore.
know that, except for UConn and
Cal, they are the team that pushed
the Card closest all season, nar
rowly losing 67-60 at Maples Pavil
ion back in early January. There
were nine lead changes in that con
test and the score was tied a total
of 10 times. Oregon State held a
four-point lead over Stanford at
the half but could not quite hold
on for the upset.
The Beavers' top performers in
January's game were guards Ali
Gibson, Alyssa Martin and
Earlysia Marchbanks, with 16
points and six rebounds, 12 and
four and 12 and three, respectively.
Coming into tonight's game, Ore
gon State may be looking to the
same players; Gibson and March

banks currently lead OSU with av
erages of 12.5 and 12.0 points and
4.0 and 7.0 rebounds, respectively.
Two factors that made the cru
cial difference for Stanford the last
time it met Oregon State were the
Ogwumike sisters and fouls. On
their way to a pair of double-dou
bles, senior forward Nnemkadi
and sophomore forward Chiney
combined for 53 points and 26 re
bounds to lift the Card clear of the
Beavers.
OSU also committed 16 fouls
in comparison to Stanford's eight,
sending the Card to the charity
stripe 12 more times than the
Beavers, allowing Stanford to hold
a 12-point advantage on free
throws. This difference was crucial
because the final game-winning
margin was just seven. From the
floor, OSU had a considerably bet
ter shooting percentage, 49 per
cent compared to 36.4 percent, hit
ting one more field goal than the

Card and three more three-point
ers, and it is clear that fouls, and
free throws, won the game for
Stanford.
This time around, Oregon State
will need to repeat the physical
performance that kept most of the
Cardinal players quiet, but with
out sending Stanford to the free
throw line so often or letting the
Ogwumikes catch fire. The bad
news for the Beavers, though, is
that since that game, head coach
Tara VanDerveer has been able to
count on major contributions from
other parts of her team. While
OSU has turned its season around,
the Cardinal too has improved in
the last month and a half.The team
that travels to Corvallis tonight is
almost certainly better than the
one that narrowly won at the be
ginning of the year.
After the contest against OSU,
Stanford will move on to Eugene
to face the Oregon Ducks at
lunchtime on Saturday. Regard
less of results elsewhere, if the Car
dinal can engineer a sweep of the
Oregon schools it will be guaran
teed the Pac-12 regular-season
title with three games still to play.
Tonight's clash with the
Beavers tips off at 7 p.m. in Corval
lis.

The Stanford women's bas
ketball team travels to Corvallis,
Ore., tonight with a chance to
clinch the inaugural Pac-12 title,
and its 12th straight conference
title overall. Should the Cardinal
defeat Oregon State, it will be
guaranteed at least a share of the
trophy with four games to go, and
Stanford can claim the title out
right if second-place Cal loses to
Oregon in Eugene,
This week, the Cardinal (22-1,
13-0 Pac-12) moved up to No. 3 in
the nation as a result of Notre
Dame's 65-63 loss to West Vir
ginia on Sunday.The team enters
tonight's game undefeated in its
last 70 conference games, on a
24-game winning streak against
the Beavers (17-7,8-5) and lead
ing the all-time series 48-6. With
last weekend's sweep of the

Southern California schools, it
also guaranteed it can't finish
outside of the top four in confer
ence and thus received a bye to
the quarterfinals of March's Pac
-12 Tournament in Los Angeles.
