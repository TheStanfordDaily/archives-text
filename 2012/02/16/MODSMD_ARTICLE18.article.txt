# CARD ON VERGE OF PAC-12 TITLE
## 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team travels to Corvallis,
Ore., tonight with a chance to
clinch the inaugural Pac-12 title,
and its 12th straight conference
title overall. Should the Cardinal
defeat Oregon State, it will be
guaranteed at least a share of the
trophy with four games to go, and
Stanford can claim the title out
right if second-place Cal loses to
Oregon in Eugene,
This week, the Cardinal (22-1,
13-0 Pac-12) moved up to No. 3 in
the nation as a result of Notre
Dame's 65-63 loss to West Vir
ginia on Sunday.The team enters
tonight's game undefeated in its
last 70 conference games, on a
24-game winning streak against
the Beavers (17-7,8-5) and lead
ing the all-time series 48-6. With
last weekend's sweep of the

Southern California schools, it
also guaranteed it can't finish
outside of the top four in confer
ence and thus received a bye to
the quarterfinals of March's Pac
-12 Tournament in Los Angeles.
However, playing Oregon
State at home may prove a tricky
proposition. After finishing dead
last with a 2-16 conference
record last season and starting
slowly this year, head coach Scott
Rueck has turned this team
around in his second year at the
helm. The Beavers are now on a
six-game winning streak and cur
rently sit in third place. A strong
finish in the last five games of the
regular season could lift OSU
above Cal and possibly give the
Beavers an at-large berth into
the NCAA Tournament.
As if that was not motivation
enough for the Beavers, they
