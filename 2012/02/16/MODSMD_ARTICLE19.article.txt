# Beane: Genius or madman?
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
Billy Beane is a genius. Or
he's a madman. I'm just
not sure which one.
Every single day, the
Oakland Athletics' gen
eral manager continues to defy all
logic. In their most recent mind
boggling move, the A's signed
Cuban defector Yoenis Cespedes to
a four-year, $36 million deal on
Monday, making the collective
baseball world scratch its head. The
A's not only have a small payroll, but
they haven't been very competitive
in the AL West since their last play
off berth in 2006 so why on earth
would the perpetually rebuilding
A's sign an unknown power hitter
most famous for a preposterous
You Tube highlight video to a deal
this big?
The natural reaction is to think
that Beane, the architect of the fan
tastic "Moneyball" A's teams of the
early 2000s, has totally lost his mind.
First, he traded away almost all
of the team's good young pitchers,
shipping Gio Gonzalez to the Na
tionals, Trevor Cahill to the Dia
mondbacks and Andrew Bailey to
the Red Sox. Next, he signed the
rapidly-falling-apart-and-laugh
ably-out-of-shape Bartolo Colon to
join his rotation. After that, he spent
big for Cespedes. Finally, he plans on
signing Manny Ramirez in the near
future to join Cespedes as the
team's other power hitter. Yes,
Manny Ramirez, the same guy who
had just one hit in 17 at-bats for the
Tampa Bay Rays before he retired
because he failed his second drug
test for performance-enhancing
drugs.
How on earth do the A's expect
to compete with in the AL West like
this? The Angels sign Albert Pujols
and C.J. Wilson, the Rangers break
the bank for Japanese sensation Yu
Darvish, and this is how Beane re
sponds? By signing a washed-up,
nutty steroid user and a guy who is
known for a video that features him
taking batting practice in slow mo
tion set to Juelz Santana's "The
Whistle Song"? Billy, have you lost
your damn mind?
But in the midst of all these
mind-boggling moves, a thought
suddenly occurred to me: Is Billy
Beane trying to tank his team on
purpose?
I know Beane is smart â€”he
somehow got the As to extend his
contract through 2019 despite the
team not making the playoffs for
five years and I think he has fi
nally found the way to revive Oak
land's franchise.
Anybody who knows baseball
knows the knock on Oakland: they
have a payroll smaller than most
WNBA teams, so they have to
make every dollar count by count
ing on young prospects. They can't
sign big free agents. But finally,

Beane has found away out of Oak
land's status quo. If he tanks the
franchise, the MLB will be forced to
let the A's build the new ballpark in
San Jose they desperately want, and
Beane and company will get a big
influx of new money with which to
bring the A's back to greatness.
Take a look at the franchise for
merly known as the Montreal
Expos, currently the Washington
Nationals. They had to become the
laughingstock of Major League
Baseball before they could finally
get into a spot where they were able
to compete, and Beane is following
their lead.

First, the Expos became one of
the worst teams in baseball, and no
body showed up to their games. It
got so bad that the team had to be
sold to Major League Baseball, and
even had to play games in San Juan,
Puerto Rico in order to get anyone
to show up to their games.
But once things got that des
perate, the MLB finally did what it
could to save the franchise.
First, they moved the fran
chise to Washington, D.C. and
changed the team name to the
Nationals. Next, the Nationals got
a big, brand-new ballpark with a
view of the United States Capitol
building. They only had to suck
for a few more years before they
could get two dynamite first over
all picks in a row Stephen
Strasburg in 2009 and Bryce
Harper in 2010 and now they
have enough money and talent to
put up a fight in the NL East.
They just had to get worse before
they could get better. And they

are definitely getting better in a
hurry.
Why does the tank-on-purpose
theory make sense to me? After all,
that's the "Moneyball" philosophy:
You zig when others zag and you
value things others don't. If Beane
pulls this great gambit off. he'll have
taken what he's been given and
done the absolute best thing for the
A's: get them out of the Coliseum,
into a new park, infused with new
money and ready to be contenders
again.
And if you think I'm the crazy
one, consider this: Beane got Brad
Pitt to play him in a movie. Do you
really need any other evidence that
Billy Beane is a genius?

Jack Blanchat is only calling Billy
Beane a genius to try to get on the
