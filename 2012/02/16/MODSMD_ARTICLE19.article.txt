# Beane: Genius or madman?
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
Billy Beane is a genius. Or
he's a madman. I'm just
not sure which one.
Every single day, the
Oakland Athletics' gen
eral manager continues to defy all
logic. In their most recent mind
boggling move, the A's signed
Cuban defector Yoenis Cespedes to
a four-year, $36 million deal on
Monday, making the collective
baseball world scratch its head. The
A's not only have a small payroll, but
they haven't been very competitive
in the AL West since their last play
off berth in 2006 so why on earth
would the perpetually rebuilding
A's sign an unknown power hitter
most famous for a preposterous
You Tube highlight video to a deal
this big?
The natural reaction is to think
that Beane, the architect of the fan
tastic "Moneyball" A's teams of the
early 2000s, has totally lost his mind.
First, he traded away almost all
of the team's good young pitchers,
shipping Gio Gonzalez to the Na
tionals, Trevor Cahill to the Dia
mondbacks and Andrew Bailey to
the Red Sox. Next, he signed the
rapidly-falling-apart-and-laugh
ably-out-of-shape Bartolo Colon to
join his rotation. After that, he spent
big for Cespedes. Finally, he plans on
signing Manny Ramirez in the near
future to join Cespedes as the
team's other power hitter. Yes,
Manny Ramirez, the same guy who
had just one hit in 17 at-bats for the
Tampa Bay Rays before he retired
because he failed his second drug
test for performance-enhancing
drugs.
How on earth do the A's expect
to compete with in the AL West like
this? The Angels sign Albert Pujols
and C.J. Wilson, the Rangers break
the bank for Japanese sensation Yu
Darvish, and this is how Beane re
sponds? By signing a washed-up,
nutty steroid user and a guy who is
known for a video that features him
taking batting practice in slow mo
tion set to Juelz Santana's "The
Whistle Song"? Billy, have you lost
your damn mind?
But in the midst of all these
mind-boggling moves, a thought
suddenly occurred to me: Is Billy
Beane trying to tank his team on
purpose?
I know Beane is smart â€”he
somehow got the As to extend his
contract through 2019 despite the
