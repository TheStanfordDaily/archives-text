## SUES calls for changes to advising Study finds current system improved from past, but still not meeting needs 
### MARWA FARAG MANAGING EDITOR 
Academic advising has been recognized as
an important part of undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford for over a century and has
been delivered poorly for just as long, accord
ing to the recent Study of Undergraduate Ed
ucation at Stanford (SUES) report. But
changes may be on the way.
The report identified student dissatisfac
tion and low faculty participation as major
problems in the current advising system,
while praising advising reforms that resulted
from the 1993-94 Commission on Undergrad
uate Education (CUE) report, including the
establishment of the office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) and the 2007-09 reorganization of
the office of Undergraduate Advising and
Research (UAR).

SUES recommendations focused on im
proving the delivery of advising services and
the "culture of advising." According to Ravi
Vakil, professor of mathematics and chair of
the SUES subcommittee on Beyond the
Freshman Year, the evaluations were based
on data from student surveys, extensive anec
dotal data and discussions with UAR.
"What struck me most was that these con
cerns have been there for a century," Vakil
wrote in an email to The Daily. "This is a huge
challenge, and there is no silver bullet. But
there are 'best practices' that we can try to
apply."
The current advising system assigns each
incoming freshman an academic director
(AD) and a pre-major advisor (PMA) until
students declare a major. UAR also employs
an additional set of advisors to provide spe
cialized advice on fellowships and pre-profes
sional interests. Varsity athletes receive sepa
rate advisors through the Athletic Academic
Resources Center (AARC).
These advisors form what UAR calls the
"multiple mentor model."
"The term ... reflects our philosophy that
no one person at Stanford can or should be
expected to answer every question a student
may have," reads the 2011 UAR Annual Re
port.
