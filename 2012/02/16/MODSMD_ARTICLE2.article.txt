## SUES calls for changes to advising Study finds current system improved from past, but still not meeting needs 
### MARWA FARAG MANAGING EDITOR 
Academic advising has been recognized as
an important part of undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford for over a century and has
been delivered poorly for just as long, accord
ing to the recent Study of Undergraduate Ed
ucation at Stanford (SUES) report. But
changes may be on the way.
The report identified student dissatisfac
tion and low faculty participation as major
problems in the current advising system,
while praising advising reforms that resulted
from the 1993-94 Commission on Undergrad
uate Education (CUE) report, including the
establishment of the office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) and the 2007-09 reorganization of
the office of Undergraduate Advising and
Research (UAR).

SUES recommendations focused on im
proving the delivery of advising services and
the "culture of advising." According to Ravi
Vakil, professor of mathematics and chair of
the SUES subcommittee on Beyond the
Freshman Year, the evaluations were based
on data from student surveys, extensive anec
dotal data and discussions with UAR.
"What struck me most was that these con
cerns have been there for a century," Vakil
wrote in an email to The Daily. "This is a huge
challenge, and there is no silver bullet. But
there are 'best practices' that we can try to
apply."
The current advising system assigns each
incoming freshman an academic director
(AD) and a pre-major advisor (PMA) until
students declare a major. UAR also employs
an additional set of advisors to provide spe
cialized advice on fellowships and pre-profes
sional interests. Varsity athletes receive sepa
rate advisors through the Athletic Academic
Resources Center (AARC).
These advisors form what UAR calls the
"multiple mentor model."
"The term ... reflects our philosophy that
no one person at Stanford can or should be
expected to answer every question a student
may have," reads the 2011 UAR Annual Re
port.

Academic Directors
SUES praised the Academic
Directors program run by UAR
since 2004 and recommended ex
panding the number of academic
directors.
"We have fewer academic di
rectors per student than our
peers," Vakil said. "The evidence
suggests that academic directors
provide good value. Hiring more
people is always expensive but
this is an important issue."
ADs are professional, Ph.D.-
level advisors placed with offices
in freshman residential complex
es, geographically close to the
residences they serve. According
to the UAR student surveys cited
in the SUES report, more than 90
percent of freshmen and sopho
mores consulted with their ADs
at least once during the last aca
demic year. Eight ADs currently
serve as advisors to approximate
ly 400 undeclared students each,
according to the UAR Annual
Report.
The UAR report stressed high
demand for AD advising as a
problem.
"Our concern now is with
their workload —at a ratio of
400:1 they exceed the national
guidelines for 1:1 advising at a re
search university and their in
creased visibility suggests de
mand for their time will only con
tinue to increase."
Pre-major advisors
According to SUES, the pre
major advisor program's main
problems include low faculty par
ticipation, lack of incentive, advi
sor-advisee matching issues and a
misunderstanding of the role of
the PMA.
Currently, 310 volunteer facul
ty and staff advisors serve as
PMAs, an increase from 240 last
year, according to Julie Lythcott-
Haims 'B9, dean of freshman and
undergraduate advising. Each
PMA advises anywhere from six
to 16 undeclared students. The
class of 2014 was the first to expe
rience "enrollments holds,"
which prevent students from en
rolling in courses unless they
meet with their PMA advisors.
While the SUES report de
scribed it as a "useful reform,"
some students have expression
frustration over the hold.

"I feel like I am a responsible
enough student that I can sign up
for classes without having to get
permission from an advisor," said
Lindsey Wilder 'l4.
Vakil described encouraging
faculty to advise more unde
clared students as a "crucial
issue."

The SUES report was skepti
cal about requiring all faculty
members to serve as freshman
advisors, as some peer institu
tions have done, and instead con
sidered making individual de
partments responsible for pro
viding pre-major advisors. Pro
viding inducements for pre
major advising was suggested as a
last resort.
"Faculty have so many com
peting demands on their time; in
UAR we're trying to strengthen
the message about why pre-major
advising is rewarding for advisors
and even beneficial to depart
ments," Lythcott-Flaims said.
SUES also endorsed recogni
tion and reward for the academic
and nonacademic staff members
who serve as PMAs to the remain
ing majority of undeclared stu
dents.
"I want to guide [advisees]
through the school year, through
their majors," said Citlalli Del Car
pio, a Spanish lecturer who serves
as PMA to eight students. "School
can be very stressful... so they
can have a person that they can
just sit down and talk and ventilate
their frustrations and depression
of not knowing what to do."
This conception of a PMA's
job, however, differs from what
some students expect from their

advisor.
"Students are often frustrated
when PMAs don't know all of the
answers about the curriculum or
how to find the answers. What we
want every student to know is
that they shouldn't expect the
PMA to know all of these de
tails," said Kirsti Copeland, direc
tor of residentially based advis
ing. "We intend to do a better job
at communicating to students
what we expect PMAs to do."
Janani Ramachandran 'l4,
chair of the academic affairs com
mittee of the ASSU Senate,
echoed this problem.
"Students don't always neces
sarily know when they should go
to a PMA, an AD, faculty mem
ber, peer advisor. ... Sometimes
students have expectations that
are too much for a PMA," Ra
machandran said.

Peer advising
SUES further recommended
exploring possibilities for rein
troducing peer advising, a pro
gram UAR discontinued and re
placed with the AD program.
Ramachandran and the aca
demic affairs committee of the
ASSU Senate have been work
ing with UAR to expand and
promote peer advising. The com
mittee intends to create a web
portal that lists contact informa
tion for peer advisors and student
service representatives in every
department for student use.
With regards to formally rein
stating a peer-advising program,
Lythcott-Haims stated that UAR
is now "in a position to think about
bringing peer advisors back."
"We know that strong recruit
ment efforts and robust training
and ongoing support will be es
sential if peer advisors are to be
successful," she said.
The student role
The SUES report's final rec
ommendation was to encourage
students to "take ownership" of
their education and to use effec
tive advising to "make considered,
reflective choices" on their own.
UAR hopes the new "Stanford
101" program is the first step to
ward this end.
Stanford 101 piloted one of its
two programs—the Stanford Re
flections Seminar—this week, ac
cording to Copeland.The seminar
will create a space for students to
engage in small, group discussions
about their Stanford experience.
"Ultimately, we hope that the
structured environment for these
reflections will increase students'
awareness of their agency in the
choices that will shape their time
here and beyond," wrote Koren
Bakkegard, UAR associate dean
in an email to The Daily.
Stanford 101's second pro
gram, the Stanford Navigations
pilot, will introduce students to
the resources available to them at
Stanford. Discussion on the pro
gram is in preliminary phases.
"I believe that [student own
ership of their education] is part
and parcel of the unique nature of
Undergraduate Advising and Re
search, in that its mission includes
not only advising but also under
graduate research grants and
helping students belong to Stan
ford," Copeland said.
