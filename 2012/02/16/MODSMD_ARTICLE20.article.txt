# DAVIS UPSETS CARD
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As often as the biblical tale has been in
voked to tell tales of great heroics on the ath
letic fields, it's still not every day that David
beats Goliath. In a midweek matchup early in
the season, however, it's sometimes better to
expect the unexpected. On Wednesday, the
No. 8 Stanford Softball team's big bats were

quieted and UC-
Davis walked off
with a 2-1 win, its
first triumph in the
annual series since
1995.

The loss dropped the Cardinal to 4-2 on the
season and was shocking for more reasons
than just the loss to the unranked Aggies (2-4).
Stanford had been averaging over nine runs
per game in the first five games of the year and
boasts several players with explosive run-scor
ing capacity.
In addition, Davis had almost been swept
while hosting its own tournament, losing its
first four games at the Aggie Stampede before
knocking off Nevada on the final day.
But UC-Davis pitcher Jessica Thweatt was
a machine in the circle, holding the Cardinal
scoreless for six innings before a timely hit and
a wild pitch allowed Stanford to tie the score at
1-1.
The Cardinal held its own on defense, as
junior pitcher Teagan Gerhart almost matched
Thweatt's zeroes with three innings of one-run
ball. In addition, freshman Nyree White held
the Aggies in check after taking over for Ger
hart in the fourth inning.
But Stanford's offense could not buy a base
runner, putting only six runners on base the
entire game.
Besides senior Ail-American Ashley
Hansen's two doubles, the Cardinal had little
going for it on the offensive side of things, until
a pinch-hit single by redshirt sophomore
Tegan Schmidt put runners on first and second
with one out in the seventh inning.

Thweatt's only real error of the afternoon,
a wild pitch, allowed junior Jenna Rich to
score from second base and tie the game.
The ran gave Stanford hope, but that hope
was to be short-lived.
In the bottom of the seventh, White struck
out the first batter and was ahead in the count
against the No. 9 hitter in Davis' lineup, catch
er JJ Wagoner. But Wagoner got a hold of
White's next offering, tripling to deep right
field. With the infield in, a clean single up the
middle scored Wagoner, and the Aggies cele
brated a walk-off victory.
The Cardinal will try and rinse the bad taste
out of its mouth very soon, however. Stanford
hosts the Stanford Nike Invitational this week
end, taking on Pacific in the team's home
opener Friday afternoon.
Games against Bradley and Nevada will
follow, as semifinal, consolation and champi
onship matchups, determined by the round
robin action, will take place on Sunday.
Pacific (0-2) has struggled out of the gate
this year, losing its only two contests so far, but
could make for an interesting game with the
Cardinal. The Tigers showed some fight in
scoring two runs off No. 12 UCLA and forcing
the Bruins to play six innings.
And while Bradley (2-3) has a losing
record, the Braves played very tough against
No. 3 California in a 5-0 loss this year. The Car
dinal has never faced the Braves, but did get a
chance to see them play at last weekend's sea
son-opening Kajikawa Classic, A very patient
team at the plate, Bradley drew 18 walks and
gave up just nine runs in four games out of five
but also had a 16-1 defeat at the hands of
Idaho State.
Madeline Lynch-Crumrine is the Braves'
ace, and she might give Stanford trouble if the
Cardinal cannot shake the ill effects of
Wednesday's defeat.
Stanford's final opponent this weekend will
be Nevada (1-4), which once again might not
be nearly as bad as its record suggests. The
Wolf Pack sports a very unsightly .177 team
batting average but has a dominant pitcher in

senior Mallary Darby (1.42 ERA, 13 strike
outs in 19.2 innings) and beat UC-Davis 6-3 in
the Aggie Stampede.
With plenty of teams that sport much more
impressive resumes looming on the near hori
zon for the Cardinal, this weekend figures to
be an important test to see how close Stanford
really is to midseason form. The Card needs to
hit its stride in order to take charge in the
daunting Pac-12 and beyond.
First pitch against Pacific from Smith Fam
ily Stadium is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. on Fri
day.
