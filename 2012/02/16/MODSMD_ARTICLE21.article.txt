### â€“ Joseph Bey da 
Six Cardinal football players will be at the
NFL combine in Indianapolis from Feb. 22 to
28, and several are currently training on cam
pus as they prepare to impress pro scouts.
Redshirt junior quarterback Andrew
Luck has long been the consensus No. 1 over
all pick in the upcoming NFL draft, and his
two best offensive linemen, Jonathan Martin
and David DeCastro, will join him in Indi
anapolis as likely first-round picks as well.
Tight end Coby Fleener, who caught a team
leading 10 touchdown passes last season, will
also be at the combine and has been men

tioned as a potential first-round selection as
well.

Safety Delano Howell is the only defen
sive player of the group. Despite missing
three games due to injury last year, he fin
ished the season with three of the best per
formances of his career, coming up with
seven, eight and seven tackles respectively
against the likes of Cal's Keenan Allen, Notre
Dame's Michael Floyd and Oklahoma State's
Justin Blackmon.

The final Stanford player heading to Indi
anapolis is receiver Chris Owusu, whose
medical clearance to continue playing foot
ball after a series of concussions was an
nounced by his agent on Thursday. Owusu
was carted off the field at Oregon State on

Nov. 5 after his third such injury in 13 months
and did not return to action last season, be
sides being inserted on the final play of the
game against Notre Dame.

Owusu's playing career on the Farm got
off to a speedy start. As a sophomore, the dy
namic receiver caught a team-leading five
touchdowns and earned first-team All-Pac-10
honors on special teams for his three scores
on kickoff returns, which tied a conference
record. Even though his injury-plagued ca
reer took a turn for the worse in 2010 and
never fully restarted in his seven games last
season, Owusu still ranks as one of the top
kick returners in Stanford history.
