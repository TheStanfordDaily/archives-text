# XOX challenges University
## UNIVERSITY 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's recent decision to revoke
Chi Theta Chi's (XOX) lease has pro
voked a firestorm of criticism from XOX
alumni and members of the Stanford
community. The University, meanwhile,
maintains that it holds student interest
paramount and that student life at Chi
Theta Chi need not change along with a
shift in house oversight.

XOX community members allege that
many of the University's reasons for ter
mination of the lease are false and that
University officials "ambushed" XOX
alumni members with the decision at a
Feb. 8 meeting, according to an email from
XOX Alumni Board members. University
officials did not address this claim in a
statement released in response to ques
tions from The Daily, including a request
to evaluate XOX's claim that University
officials gave them no forewarning about
the decision.

ChiTheta Chi is one of two on-campus

houses the other being the fraternity
Sigma Chi not operated directly by the
University, which instead owns the land
on which the houses sit. The house lease is
automatically renewed annually unless ei
ther XOX or Stanford exercises the op
tion of unilaterally terminating the rela
tionship prior to March 1. Stanford is
currently set to take control of the house
on the first day of spring quarter, at which
point residents will start paying rent di
rectly to the University.

A joint statement, representing Resi
dential Education, Student Affairs, Stu
dent Housing, Residential Dining & En
terprises and other University adminis
trative bodies, cited "legal, facility stew
ardship and fiscal/operational issues" as
the basis of the University's decision to
terminate the lease. The statement de
clined to go into detail about these issues,
"out of respect for the alumni board and
the past and current residents of the
house."

"Some of these issues have been ongo
ing for some time, but some new issues

have arisen recently and the severity of
others has escalated," the University
statement said. "The decision not to
renew this lease should not reflect on the
actions of the current or prior Chi Theta
Chi student community."

Abel Allison 'OB, president of the XOX
Alumni Board, acknowledged that some
of the reasons for the lease termination as
provided by the University to XOX
such as failing multiple fire inspections of
the house are true. However, Allison
said that XOX residents and managers
have consistently and promptly enacted
recommendations and guidance put for
ward by University officials.
Allison also disputed the administra
tors' allegation that XOX has been em
ploying the tax identification number of
Theta Chi Fraternity from which XOX
formally split in the late 1980s even
after the receipt of a cease-and-desist let
ter from that organization, which Allison
further denied ever receiving.
