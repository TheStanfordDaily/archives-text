# XOX challenges University
## UNIVERSITY 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's recent decision to revoke
Chi Theta Chi's (XOX) lease has pro
voked a firestorm of criticism from XOX
alumni and members of the Stanford
community. The University, meanwhile,
maintains that it holds student interest
paramount and that student life at Chi
Theta Chi need not change along with a
shift in house oversight.

XOX community members allege that
many of the University's reasons for ter
mination of the lease are false and that
University officials "ambushed" XOX
alumni members with the decision at a
Feb. 8 meeting, according to an email from
XOX Alumni Board members. University
officials did not address this claim in a
statement released in response to ques
tions from The Daily, including a request
to evaluate XOX's claim that University
officials gave them no forewarning about
the decision.

ChiTheta Chi is one of two on-campus

houses the other being the fraternity
Sigma Chi not operated directly by the
University, which instead owns the land
on which the houses sit. The house lease is
automatically renewed annually unless ei
ther XOX or Stanford exercises the op
tion of unilaterally terminating the rela
tionship prior to March 1. Stanford is
currently set to take control of the house
on the first day of spring quarter, at which
point residents will start paying rent di
rectly to the University.

A joint statement, representing Resi
dential Education, Student Affairs, Stu
dent Housing, Residential Dining & En
terprises and other University adminis
trative bodies, cited "legal, facility stew
ardship and fiscal/operational issues" as
the basis of the University's decision to
terminate the lease. The statement de
clined to go into detail about these issues,
"out of respect for the alumni board and
the past and current residents of the
house."

"Some of these issues have been ongo
ing for some time, but some new issues

have arisen recently and the severity of
others has escalated," the University
statement said. "The decision not to
renew this lease should not reflect on the
actions of the current or prior Chi Theta
Chi student community."

Abel Allison 'OB, president of the XOX
Alumni Board, acknowledged that some
of the reasons for the lease termination as
provided by the University to XOX
such as failing multiple fire inspections of
the house are true. However, Allison
said that XOX residents and managers
have consistently and promptly enacted
recommendations and guidance put for
ward by University officials.
Allison also disputed the administra
tors' allegation that XOX has been em
ploying the tax identification number of
Theta Chi Fraternity from which XOX
formally split in the late 1980s even
after the receipt of a cease-and-desist let
ter from that organization, which Allison
further denied ever receiving.
"We believe that we have been
filing our taxes correctly for as
long as we've been an organiza
tion," Allison said. "We're work
ing to document that and have
been communicating with Theta
Chi."

The Theta Chi fraternity had
not returned a call from The Daily
at the time of publication.
Allison also denied that XOX
was at risk of default, as charged
by University administrators.
"We are happy to show docu
mentation of our financial solven
cy," Allison said, "And [of] the
availability of funds to continue
to take care of the house."
In a Feb. 8 letter to XOX, the
University additionally cited the
house's failure to maintain corpo
rate status in California as
grounds for terminating the
house's lease. Former XOX Resi
dent Assistant (RA) Bear Dou
glas 'O9 M.A. TO told The Daily
Wednesday that having filed
and processed all relevant docu
mentation the suspension im
posed on XOX's status has been
lifted.

Keith Nelson 76 Ph.D. 'Bl, a
XOX alumnus and current pro
fessor at MIT, said that XOX's
traditional independence enables
residents to gain practical experi
ence running a functioning house
hold with a great degree of con
trol and responsibility, as well as
the ability to materially improve
the house through their own ini
tiative and resources.

"That independence won't
exist anymore," under direct Uni
versity supervision, Nelson said.
"Other types of housing have a
certain uniformity or institutional
feel... The house was able to
maintain a pretty distinctive feel
that gained substantially from the
incentives that we [students] had
in running it."

The University responded to
similar concerns in its statement,
saying, "It is our hope that the
essence of the Chi Theta Chi stu
dent experience will not change; it
is the oversight and management
of the facility that is changing, not
the program."
Allison described the Univer
sity as "extremely aggressive" in
its efforts to begin the transition
process, but said that the XOX
community is "working as hard as
we can to turn this into a discus
sion [with the University]."
Allison said that there had
been no attempt by the Universi
ty to make XOX aware of the pos
sibility of losing the lease, nor had
there been any effort to mediate
or negotiate a solution to the
problems the University cited be
yond routine communication
with administrators.
"Communication with the
University has been limited over
the past number of months," Alli
son said. "We have worked with
University officials regarding
small issues, but no prior notice
regarding the lease had been
given."

Mike Harville '92, a member
of XOX's Alumni Board, noted
that XOX's lease had been threat
ened by the University in previ
ous years and dismissed the idea
that any radical changes in XOX's
operation this year prompted the
University's intervention. He ex
pressed cautious optimism, how
ever, about the prospects of
XOX's chances for survival given
the reaction of XOX students and
alumni, a sentiment echoed by Al-

lison.
"We don't know if the Univer
sity will let this become a discus
sion," Allison said. "If it does, we
want to have the most positive
and constructive discussion we

can, including how we need to
change moving forward to ensure
this doesn't happen again while
still preserving the culture of the
house."

The University's statement ex
pressed the possibility of dialogue
concerning how best to move for
ward, though it gave no indication
that renewal of the lease might be
a topic of discussion.
"These specific issues going
forward will be discussed in the
transition meetings planned be
tween the alumni group and Stu
dent Housing and Residential
Education officials over the next
few weeks," the statement said,
referring to concerns of ChiTheta

Chi losing its unique culture.
A petition supporting Chi
Theta Chi's independence circu
lated through email chains and
Facebook on Tuesday and
Wednesday, gaining over 1,400
signatures by the time of publica
tion.

"We've had so many people
express their support for this
defining aspect of the house," Al
lison concluded. "We believe that
we're doing everything we can ...
. We're committed to doing what
ever it takes to preserve this
house."

ploying the tax identification number of
Theta Chi Fraternity from which XOX
formally split in the late 1980s even
after the receipt of a cease-and-desist let
ter from that organization, which Allison
further denied ever receiving.
"We believe that we have been
filing our taxes correctly for as
long as we've been an organiza
tion," Allison said. "We're work
ing to document that and have
been communicating with Theta
Chi."

The Theta Chi fraternity had
not returned a call from The Daily
at the time of publication.
Allison also denied that XOX
was at risk of default, as charged
by University administrators.
"We are happy to show docu
mentation of our financial solven
cy," Allison said, "And [of] the
availability of funds to continue
to take care of the house."
In a Feb. 8 letter to XOX, the
University additionally cited the
house's failure to maintain corpo
rate status in California as
grounds for terminating the
house's lease. Former XOX Resi
dent Assistant (RA) Bear Dou
glas 'O9 M.A. TO told The Daily
Wednesday that having filed
and processed all relevant docu
mentation the suspension im
posed on XOX's status has been
lifted.

Keith Nelson 76 Ph.D. 'Bl, a
XOX alumnus and current pro
fessor at MIT, said that XOX's
traditional independence enables
residents to gain practical experi
ence running a functioning house
hold with a great degree of con
trol and responsibility, as well as
the ability to materially improve
the house through their own ini
tiative and resources.

"That independence won't
exist anymore," under direct Uni
versity supervision, Nelson said.
"Other types of housing have a
certain uniformity or institutional
feel... The house was able to
maintain a pretty distinctive feel
that gained substantially from the
incentives that we [students] had
in running it."

The University responded to
similar concerns in its statement,
saying, "It is our hope that the
essence of the Chi Theta Chi stu
dent experience will not change; it
is the oversight and management
of the facility that is changing, not
the program."
Allison described the Univer
sity as "extremely aggressive" in
its efforts to begin the transition
process, but said that the XOX
community is "working as hard as
we can to turn this into a discus
sion [with the University]."
Allison said that there had
been no attempt by the Universi
ty to make XOX aware of the pos
sibility of losing the lease, nor had
there been any effort to mediate
or negotiate a solution to the
problems the University cited be
yond routine communication
with administrators.
"Communication with the
University has been limited over
the past number of months," Alli
son said. "We have worked with
University officials regarding
small issues, but no prior notice
regarding the lease had been
given."

Mike Harville '92, a member
of XOX's Alumni Board, noted
that XOX's lease had been threat
ened by the University in previ
ous years and dismissed the idea
that any radical changes in XOX's
operation this year prompted the
University's intervention. He ex
pressed cautious optimism, how
ever, about the prospects of
XOX's chances for survival given
the reaction of XOX students and
alumni, a sentiment echoed by Al-

lison.
"We don't know if the Univer
sity will let this become a discus
sion," Allison said. "If it does, we
want to have the most positive
and constructive discussion we

can, including how we need to
change moving forward to ensure
this doesn't happen again while
still preserving the culture of the
house."

The University's statement ex
pressed the possibility of dialogue
concerning how best to move for
ward, though it gave no indication
that renewal of the lease might be
a topic of discussion.
"These specific issues going
forward will be discussed in the
transition meetings planned be
tween the alumni group and Stu
dent Housing and Residential
Education officials over the next
few weeks," the statement said,
referring to concerns of ChiTheta

Chi losing its unique culture.
A petition supporting Chi
Theta Chi's independence circu
lated through email chains and
Facebook on Tuesday and
Wednesday, gaining over 1,400
signatures by the time of publica

"We've had so many people
express their support for this
defining aspect of the house," Al
lison concluded. "We believe that
we're doing everything we can ...

ever it takes to preserve this
house."

Stanford's recent decision to revoke
Chi Theta Chi's (XOX) lease has pro
voked a firestorm of criticism from XOX
alumni and members of the Stanford
community. The University, meanwhile,
maintains that it holds student interest
paramount and that student life at Chi
Theta Chi need not change along with a
shift in house oversight.

XOX community members allege that
many of the University's reasons for ter
mination of the lease are false and that
University officials "ambushed" XOX
alumni members with the decision at a
Feb. 8 meeting, according to an email from
XOX Alumni Board members. University
officials did not address this claim in a
statement released in response to ques
tions from The Daily, including a request
to evaluate XOX's claim that University
officials gave them no forewarning about
the decision.

ChiTheta Chi is one of two on-campus

houses the other being the fraternity
Sigma Chi not operated directly by the
University, which instead owns the land
on which the houses sit. The house lease is
automatically renewed annually unless ei
ther XOX or Stanford exercises the op
tion of unilaterally terminating the rela
tionship prior to March 1. Stanford is
currently set to take control of the house
on the first day of spring quarter, at which
point residents will start paying rent di
rectly to the University.

A joint statement, representing Resi
dential Education, Student Affairs, Stu
dent Housing, Residential Dining & En
terprises and other University adminis
trative bodies, cited "legal, facility stew
ardship and fiscal/operational issues" as
the basis of the University's decision to
terminate the lease. The statement de
clined to go into detail about these issues,
"out of respect for the alumni board and
the past and current residents of the
house."

"Some of these issues have been ongo
ing for some time, but some new issues

have arisen recently and the severity of
others has escalated," the University
statement said. "The decision not to
renew this lease should not reflect on the
actions of the current or prior Chi Theta
Chi student community."

Abel Allison 'OB, president of the XOX
Alumni Board, acknowledged that some
of the reasons for the lease termination as
provided by the University to XOX
such as failing multiple fire inspections of
the house are true. However, Allison
said that XOX residents and managers
have consistently and promptly enacted
recommendations and guidance put for
ward by University officials.
Allison also disputed the administra
tors' allegation that XOX has been em
ploying the tax identification number of
