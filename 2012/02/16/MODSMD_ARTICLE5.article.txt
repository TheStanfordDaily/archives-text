# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## Early ASSU candidates emerge 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU election season has just
begun, and already potential candidates
have been reminded to 'keep it clean' by
current ASSU President Michael Cruz.

"This is for everyone who is here, and for
everyone who is running," Cruz said at an
elections information session Wednesday
evening. "I want a good campaign, which
[Elections Commissioner Adam Adler 'l2]
will ensure, but I also want a clean cam
paign, which can only be ensured by the
candidates ... I don't want anybody saying
anything about anybody ... [or] crying or
cursing anyone else at the end of this."

Cruz's remarks came a day after ASSU
Senator Dan DeLong 'l3 sent an email to
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate email list
advertising the information session byway
of criticizing ASSU Vice President Stewart
Macgregor-Dennis 'l3.

The email, which was forwarded widely
across campus, encouraged students to run
for office if they "believe the Stanford com
munity deserves better."
"Otherwise, we are left with a Vice Pres
ident who pays himself a $lO,OOO annual
salary and spends his time writing a 40-page
life plan," DeLong wrote, referring to Mac
gregor-Dennis' oft-mocked proclivity for
introspection.
Within two hours, DeLong
sent out an apology for his email
to the Undergraduate Senate list.
"I did not intend for the mes
sage to be malevolent," DeLong
wrote. He said that he intended
to point out "existing flaws in our
student government."
"There is much room for im
provement. We must have the
best students running for posi
tions in the ASSU," DeLong
wrote.
"I definitely could have been
more tactful," DeLong told The
Daily about the email, though he
maintained that it pointed "to un
derlying issues" regarding ASSU
salaries and an inability to attract
high-quality candidates.
"I got an overwhelmingly pos
itive response from students out
side of the ASSU government,"
DeLong said. "I did receive criti
cism from individuals inside the
ASSU," he added, noting his sur
prise at the overwhelmingly posi
tive response from students.
Macgregor-Dennis said he is
"strongly considering" a run for
ASSU president and is searching
for a candidate who will offer
both "compatibility and ability."
He declined to comment on De-

Long's email.
Election season officially
began for the Stanford Alumni
Association Class Presidencies
and the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate, Executive and Graduate
Student Council on Monday, Feb.
6, when online declaration of in
tent and petitioning went live. No
letters of intent, except for a joke
letter by Cruz, have been submit
ted for ASSU Executive.
At Wednesday's info session,
Adler reminded students about a
new public financing program,
which will grant candidates who
request funding up to $lOO in re
imbursements for campaigning.
Students who stayed for infor
mation about the ASSU Execu
tive election included: ASSU Vice
President Stewart McGregor-
Dennis 'l3; William Wagstaff, Jr.
'l2, co-president of the African-
American Fraternal & Sororal
Association; Robbie Zimbroff
'l2, a member of the Residential
and Co-Curricular Learning Sub
committee of the Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford
(SUES) Committee;ASSU Sena
tor and Appropriations Chair
Brianna Pang 'l3 and DeLong.
DeLong is expected to part
ner with Pang as a slate for ASSU
Executive.

Letters of intent for all posi
tions are due on March 9.
