# Students may "study abroad" in Bay Area program
## 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
The University may soon develop a
"Stanford in the Bay Area" program
modeled after the current Stanford in
Washington program, if the Faculty
Senate votes favorably in March on the
recommendations of the Study of Un
dergraduate Education at Stanford
(SUES) report released in January.
Stanford in Washington differs from
other programs offered through the
Bing Overseas Studies Program in its
partnership with many institutions in
the Washington, D.C. area, providing
co-operative work opportunities to stu-

dents during the day while they

According to SUES co-chair
and history professor James
Campbell in an email to The
Daily, the report promotes a
greater focus on community
based programs similar to the
Stanford in Washington program.
These programs, Campbell said,
"combine engagement with the
wider world with serious academ
ic reflection in ways that enrich
both."

SUES committee member
and former Daily columnist
Aysha Bagchi 'll, said in an email
to The Daily that the Stanford in
Washington program and the
proposed Stanford in the Bay
Area program both serve as ways
to give students a literal and figu
rative change of scenery that ties
in well with the report's overall
aim for expansions in education
al offerings.

"One of the aims of a Stanford
education that we described in the
report (the aim that, in a sense, en
compasses all other aims) is to fos
ter adaptive learning, where stu
dents learn to adapt our knowl
edge, skills, and sense of personal
and social responsibility to new
circumstances," Bagchi wrote.
For Campbell, the Stanford in
Washington program fulfills this
aim.

"Stanford in Washington be
came a real model for us because
students are not only involved in
carrying the skills and knowledge
they've accumulated out into the
world, working in government of
fices and so forth, but its linking
that to reflective experiences,"
Campbell said. "So they're pre
pared, they're having these expe
riences out in the world, they're
coming back and having academ
ic seminars in the evening where
they're processing."
The benefits the SUES com
mittee saw in the Washington pro
gram led them to consider the
possibility of offering a similar
community-engagement program
closer to home in the Bay Area.
"We started to ask,Tf this thing

works so spectacularly well, why
aren't we doing it here?' So we
found other universities that actu
ally run quite successful field stud
ies programs that operate really
on the model of Stanford in Wash
ington," Campbell said.
However, SUES committee
member and professor of biology,
Susan McConnell, stated in an
email to The Daily that a Stanford
in the Bay Area "is more of a no
tion than a plan at this stage."
Campbell agreed that precise
ly what such a program would
look like is not fully worked out
because the committee purpose
fully tried not to be detailed or
prescriptive.

"We tried to act as an incuba
tor of ideas, trusting in the wisdom
and creativity of our colleagues
and students to develop, imple
ment and, where necessary, revise
those idea," Campbell said.
Jill Vizas, on-campus coordina
tor of the Stanford in Washington
program, said that although she
thinks a Stanford in the Bay Area
program is a good idea worth pur
suing, she and her colleagues have
not yet been privy to the thought
process behind it.
Regardless, according to
Campbell, should such a program
come to fruition, it would most
likely resemble the opportunities
offered currently by the Stanford
in Washington program.
"Students might be working
with some kind of organization,
an NGO or community service or
ganization and spend a quarter
doing that for credit. But not just
being sent out there blind, but
after having extensive prepara
tion academic preparation
and with a really robust academic
and reflective component,"
Campbell said.
Campbell said that the Stanford
in the Bay Area program would
potentially target all students re
gardless of their majors and allow
for students to actively engage in
the broader community while
being able to stay on campus.
Campbell summarized the im
petus for the idea: "What student
here wouldn't profit from an op
portunity to integrate academic
interests with challenges and op
portunities in the wider world?"

According to SUES co-chair
and history professor James
Campbell in an email to The
Daily, the report promotes a
greater focus on community
based programs similar to the
Stanford in Washington program.
These programs, Campbell said,
"combine engagement with the
wider world with serious academ
ic reflection in ways that enrich
both."

SUES committee member
and former Daily columnist
Aysha Bagchi 'll, said in an email
to The Daily that the Stanford in
Washington program and the
proposed Stanford in the Bay
Area program both serve as ways
to give students a literal and figu
rative change of scenery that ties
in well with the report's overall
aim for expansions in education
al offerings.

"One of the aims of a Stanford
education that we described in the
report (the aim that, in a sense, en
compasses all other aims) is to fos
ter adaptive learning, where stu
dents learn to adapt our knowl
edge, skills, and sense of personal
and social responsibility to new
circumstances," Bagchi wrote.
For Campbell, the Stanford in
Washington program fulfills this
aim.

"Stanford in Washington be
came a real model for us because
students are not only involved in
carrying the skills and knowledge
they've accumulated out into the
world, working in government of
fices and so forth, but its linking
that to reflective experiences,"
Campbell said. "So they're pre
pared, they're having these expe
riences out in the world, they're
coming back and having academ
ic seminars in the evening where
they're processing."
The benefits the SUES com
mittee saw in the Washington pro
gram led them to consider the
possibility of offering a similar
community-engagement program
closer to home in the Bay Area.
"We started to ask,Tf this thing

works so spectacularly well, why
aren't we doing it here?' So we
found other universities that actu
ally run quite successful field stud
ies programs that operate really
on the model of Stanford in Wash
ington," Campbell said.
However, SUES committee
member and professor of biology,
Susan McConnell, stated in an
email to The Daily that a Stanford
in the Bay Area "is more of a no
tion than a plan at this stage."
Campbell agreed that precise
ly what such a program would
look like is not fully worked out
because the committee purpose
fully tried not to be detailed or
prescriptive.

"We tried to act as an incuba
tor of ideas, trusting in the wisdom
and creativity of our colleagues
and students to develop, imple
ment and, where necessary, revise
those idea," Campbell said.
Jill Vizas, on-campus coordina
tor of the Stanford in Washington
program, said that although she
thinks a Stanford in the Bay Area
program is a good idea worth pur
suing, she and her colleagues have
not yet been privy to the thought
process behind it.
Regardless, according to
Campbell, should such a program
come to fruition, it would most
likely resemble the opportunities
offered currently by the Stanford
in Washington program.
"Students might be working
with some kind of organization,
an NGO or community service or
ganization and spend a quarter
doing that for credit. But not just
being sent out there blind, but
after having extensive prepara
tion academic preparation
and with a really robust academic
and reflective component,"
Campbell said.
Campbell said that the Stanford
in the Bay Area program would
potentially target all students re
gardless of their majors and allow
for students to actively engage in
the broader community while
being able to stay on campus.
Campbell summarized the im
petus for the idea: "What student
here wouldn't profit from an op
portunity to integrate academic
interests with challenges and op
portunities in the wider world?"
