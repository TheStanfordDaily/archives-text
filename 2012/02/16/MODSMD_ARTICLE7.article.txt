### JORDAN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
This summer, the Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine will wel
come Robert Harrington, M.D., as
its new chair. Harrington currently
heads the Duke Clinical Research
Institute in North Carolina, the
largest clinical trial research organ
ization in the world. The Daily
spoke with him about his goals for
this new position, his upcoming
transition across the country and
current room for progress at the
School of Medicine.

After completing his medical
school studies at Tufts University
and a residency at the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center,
Harrington came to Duke as a car
diology fellow in 1990. He has
served on Duke's faculty since 1993
and is currently the Richard S.
Stack Distinguished Professor in
cardiology. In 2006, Harrington as
sumed his current position as the
director of the Duke Clinical Re
search Institute.

"The institute that I direct actu
ally does research in 15 or more
areas, including things like infec
tious disease, psychiatry, pediatrics,
gastroenterology [and] cancer,"
Harrington said. "So I am here di
recting the overall institute, but my
personal research interest is in the
area of chemic heart disease and
therapies for that. In the more re
cent past, I've also gotten very en
gaged in what I would call the
methods of clinical research, differ
ent ways of doing clinical research,
different ways to ask questions, to
answer questions."

The Stanford Department of
Medicine includes around 220 fac
ulty members in 14 divisions. Har
rington sees his new job as "[creat
ing] a team within the department
of medicine that's bigger than the
individual pieces."

"I intend to both continue see
ing patients as a clinical cardiolo
gist as well as staying active as a
clinical scientist," Harrington said.
"At Stanford, I don't know exactly
yet what my clinical duties will be,
but it's probably safe to say that it
will involve acute care cardiology,
meaning people who are acutely ill
and admitted to the hospital with
things like heart attacks or heart
failure, as well as general consulta
tive cardiology, when people have
questions about the care of a pa
tient who may or may not have car
diac disease."

The continued practice of clini
cal medicine as an administrator is
central to Harrington's teaching
