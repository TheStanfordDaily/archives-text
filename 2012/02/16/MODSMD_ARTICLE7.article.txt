## Harrington named new Med. chair Former Duke research leader sha res plans for the Fa rm 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
This summer, the Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine will wel
come Robert Harrington, M.D., as
its new chair. Harrington currently
heads the Duke Clinical Research
Institute in North Carolina, the
largest clinical trial research organ
ization in the world. The Daily
spoke with him about his goals for
this new position, his upcoming
transition across the country and
current room for progress at the
School of Medicine.

After completing his medical
school studies at Tufts University
and a residency at the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center,
Harrington came to Duke as a car
diology fellow in 1990. He has
served on Duke's faculty since 1993
and is currently the Richard S.
Stack Distinguished Professor in
cardiology. In 2006, Harrington as
sumed his current position as the
director of the Duke Clinical Re
search Institute.

"The institute that I direct actu
ally does research in 15 or more
areas, including things like infec
tious disease, psychiatry, pediatrics,
gastroenterology [and] cancer,"
Harrington said. "So I am here di
recting the overall institute, but my
personal research interest is in the
area of chemic heart disease and
therapies for that. In the more re
cent past, I've also gotten very en
gaged in what I would call the
methods of clinical research, differ
ent ways of doing clinical research,
different ways to ask questions, to
answer questions."

The Stanford Department of
Medicine includes around 220 fac
ulty members in 14 divisions. Har
rington sees his new job as "[creat
ing] a team within the department
of medicine that's bigger than the
individual pieces."

"I intend to both continue see
ing patients as a clinical cardiolo
gist as well as staying active as a
clinical scientist," Harrington said.
"At Stanford, I don't know exactly
yet what my clinical duties will be,
but it's probably safe to say that it
will involve acute care cardiology,
meaning people who are acutely ill
and admitted to the hospital with
things like heart attacks or heart
failure, as well as general consulta
tive cardiology, when people have
questions about the care of a pa
tient who may or may not have car
diac disease."

The continued practice of clini
cal medicine as an administrator is
central to Harrington's teaching
style. He said he hopes to be a role
model to students pursuing aca
demic medicine by demonstrating
the benefits of being involved si
multaneously in clinical and scien
tific activity.
"Where Stanford has had a bit
less in the Department of Medi
cine is the connecting of the health
care system to ... discovery sci
ence," Harrington said. "The role
of people like me who both see pa
tients as well as do research is
something that we would like to
see increased in the Department of
Medicine."
As such, Harrington expects to
see Stanford recruiting and hiring
more faculty members who are en
gaged in clinical practice as well as
scientific research. He noted that
he hopes the excellent science on
campus will provide new therapies
for clinical purposes and that, in re
turn, students of academic medi
cine will be more inclined to take
advantage of Stanford's scientific
offerings.
"Ultimately Stanford wants to
train leaders in academic medi
cine," Harrington said. "And part
of my job will be to create a depart

ment where those opportunities
will present themselves to develop
academic leaders scientifically,
clinically and in the areas of med
ical education."
Harrington listed a chief re
sponsibility of his new position as
leading the Department of Medi
cine residency training programs
and fellowship training programs,
with their subspecialties.
While he said he is excited
about the job, Harrington admit
ted to being anxious about leaving
his home of 22 years to move 3,000
miles away.
"What interests me at this point
in my professional life is to really
broaden my leadership in academ
ic medicine from one that's largely
focused on the issues dealing with
clinical research to a broader port
folio of issues that is represented
by the department of medicine,
meaning the clinical care issues, the
research issues, both basic and clin
ical, as well as the education is
sues," Harrington said. "[Being
chair] was a nice opportunity to
broaden my leadership portfolio
and experiences and, as you might
imagine, I am incredibly excited to
do that."
Harrington is scheduled to
begin his role on July 1.

This summer, the Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine will wel
come Robert Harrington, M.D., as
its new chair. Harrington currently
heads the Duke Clinical Research
Institute in North Carolina, the
largest clinical trial research organ
ization in the world. The Daily
spoke with him about his goals for
this new position, his upcoming
transition across the country and
current room for progress at the
School of Medicine.

After completing his medical
school studies at Tufts University
and a residency at the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center,
Harrington came to Duke as a car
diology fellow in 1990. He has
served on Duke's faculty since 1993
and is currently the Richard S.
Stack Distinguished Professor in
cardiology. In 2006, Harrington as
sumed his current position as the
director of the Duke Clinical Re
search Institute.

"The institute that I direct actu
ally does research in 15 or more
areas, including things like infec
tious disease, psychiatry, pediatrics,
gastroenterology [and] cancer,"
Harrington said. "So I am here di
recting the overall institute, but my
personal research interest is in the
area of chemic heart disease and
therapies for that. In the more re
cent past, I've also gotten very en
gaged in what I would call the
methods of clinical research, differ
ent ways of doing clinical research,
different ways to ask questions, to
answer questions."

The Stanford Department of
Medicine includes around 220 fac
ulty members in 14 divisions. Har
rington sees his new job as "[creat
ing] a team within the department
of medicine that's bigger than the
individual pieces."

"I intend to both continue see
ing patients as a clinical cardiolo
gist as well as staying active as a
clinical scientist," Harrington said.
"At Stanford, I don't know exactly
yet what my clinical duties will be,
but it's probably safe to say that it
will involve acute care cardiology,
meaning people who are acutely ill
and admitted to the hospital with
things like heart attacks or heart
failure, as well as general consulta
tive cardiology, when people have
questions about the care of a pa
tient who may or may not have car
diac disease."

The continued practice of clini
cal medicine as an administrator is
central to Harrington's teaching
style. He said he hopes to be a role
model to students pursuing aca
demic medicine by demonstrating
the benefits of being involved si
multaneously in clinical and scien
tific activity.
"Where Stanford has had a bit
less in the Department of Medi
cine is the connecting of the health
care system to ... discovery sci
ence," Harrington said. "The role
of people like me who both see pa
tients as well as do research is
something that we would like to
see increased in the Department of
Medicine."
As such, Harrington expects to
see Stanford recruiting and hiring
more faculty members who are en
gaged in clinical practice as well as
scientific research. He noted that
he hopes the excellent science on
campus will provide new therapies
for clinical purposes and that, in re
turn, students of academic medi
cine will be more inclined to take
advantage of Stanford's scientific
offerings.
"Ultimately Stanford wants to
train leaders in academic medi
cine," Harrington said. "And part
of my job will be to create a depart

ment where those opportunities
will present themselves to develop
academic leaders scientifically,
clinically and in the areas of med
ical education."
Harrington listed a chief re
sponsibility of his new position as
leading the Department of Medi
cine residency training programs
and fellowship training programs,
with their subspecialties.
While he said he is excited
about the job, Harrington admit
ted to being anxious about leaving
his home of 22 years to move 3,000
miles away.
"What interests me at this point
in my professional life is to really
broaden my leadership in academ
ic medicine from one that's largely
focused on the issues dealing with
clinical research to a broader port
folio of issues that is represented
by the department of medicine,
meaning the clinical care issues, the
research issues, both basic and clin
ical, as well as the education is
sues," Harrington said. "[Being
chair] was a nice opportunity to
broaden my leadership portfolio
and experiences and, as you might
imagine, I am incredibly excited to
do that."
Harrington is scheduled to
begin his role on July 1.
