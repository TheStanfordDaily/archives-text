## Daily editors celebrate,reflect on 120 years 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Historical Society
brought together former Stanford
Daily editors for a panel discussion
last night entitled, "Press Past: The
Life and Times of the Stanford
Daily." Tracing its origins to the
founding of the "Daily Palo Alto" in
1892, The Stanford Daily has pro
vided a mirror of Stanford life for
the past 120 years.
The audience of over 50 was
comprised of many Daily alumni,
current staffers and University ad
ministrators.
The panel consisted of Daily ed
itors from some of the most con
tentious times in Stanford history.
Helen Pickering '47 spoke about
her experience as one of the first
women to serve as Daily editor-in
chief during World War 11, and the
strong bonds she forged with her
Daily colleagues.
"The people I worked with be
came my very best friends," Picker
ing said.
Former Daily sports editor Gary
Cavalli '7l moderated the panel
and spoke about his work during a
time when the campus atmosphere
challenged the Athletic Depart
ment.
Rich Jaroslovsky '75, editor-in
chief shortly after The Daily be
came legally independent from the
University in 1973, reflected on this
process and historical tensions be
tween the paper and the University.
Jaroslovsky, a technology columnist
for Bloomberg News and Business
week, currently serves on The

Daily's Board of Directors.
Felicity Barringer '72, a New
York Times correspondent and for
mer U.N. bureau chief whose law
suit while editor-in-chief against the
Palo Alto police led to the Supreme
Court decision Zurcher v. The Stan
ford Daily spoke about the skill set
of inquiry, fairness and perspective
she gained as a student journalist.
The era leading up to the
Zurcher case was one of the most
chaotic moments for American uni
versities, making it particularly
challenging for student journalists.
"To follow the journalistic credo
of not being involved was more diffi
cult here, I think, than any other time
in my career," Barrington said of her
time at The Daily, which saw "funda
mental changes in the University."
Jaroslovsky recalled getting
pinned against a glass door by a
crowd while he was reporting on a
sit-in at Old Union his freshman
year.

"I had this moment of, 'What the
hell am I doing here?'" Jaroslovsky
said, who was 17 at the time of the
protest. "When I look back at it
now, I had to do an awful lot of
growing up in a very, very short pe
riod of time."

The most famous incident in
Daily history, the Zurcher case, in
volved a search warrant issued to
prevent the Daily from destroying
photos that could incriminate par
ticipants in a violent protest
though the photo evidence sought
by the Palo Alto police never, in
fact, existed. According to Barring
ton, The Daily had an editorial pol
icy to print all newsworthy photos

and to destroy those not used to
avoid legal action from any in
volved party. The photos from this
particular protest were not incrimi
nating.
The Supreme Court ultimately
ruled against The Daily in 1977,
with Jaroslovsky in the audience for
the oral arguments.
"ft was a blow to freedom of the
press then, and it has continued to
be a blow to freedom of the press,"
Jaroslovsky said. He noted, howev
er, that the case led many states to
pass shield laws to extend some
protection to journalists.
Barringer expressed concern
over the danger of journalists be
coming "one-stop shopping" for
prosecutors, who would prefer not
to have to find witnesses them
selves.
"It's just so much easier to go to
the journalist," she said.
Issues raised in the panel
spanned the ages, notably The
Daily's relationship with Stanford
and with the ASSU.
The ASSU aspect reached a
height of complication when
Jaroslovsky oversaw The Daily's
break from legal association with
Stanford in 1973, becoming one of
the first college newspapers to go
independent.
Jaroslovsky noted that both the
University and The Daily had con
cerns about the affiliation. Univer
sity officials feared that Stanford
could be held accountable for The
Daily's actions, and Daily editors
feared that, if the University ever
wished to, Stanford could legally
censor or search The Daily's con

tent or facilities.
The move to independence
meant that The Daily broke off fi
nancially from the ASSU to be
come The Stanford Daily Publish
ing Corporation.
"We sold it to the student body
as the end of fee assessments [for
subscriptions]," Jaroslovsky said,
calling the campaign "not the most
forthright, but effective," Despite a
brief period in the black. The Daily
found itself needing fee assess
ments again within 18 months, he
added.

The Daily did not re-affiliate
with Stanford, but instead set up the
legal situation that exists today, in
which The Daily remains independ
ent but still receives student fees, as
voted on by the student body in the
special fees process.
The panelists also commented
on their interactions with the Uni
versity presidents of their respec

tive times.
Barringer described The Daily's
relationship with former president
Richard Lyman, who attended the
panel, as, "on both sides respectful
and wary."
Jaroslovsky told a story of pre
dicting to his parents that Lyman
would say, "finally getting rid of
you" upon shaking Jaroslovsky's
hand in a graduation day receiving
line.
"You did not disappoint,"
Jaroslovsky said to Lyman amid au
dience laughter.
The panelists all agreed on the
immense joy and challenges they
experiences as editors-in-chief.
"I'd never worked that hard be
fore and I've never worked that
hard since," Jaroslovsky said. "Or
had as much fun."

current staffers and University ad
ministrators.
The panel consisted of Daily ed
itors from some of the most con
tentious times in Stanford history.
Helen Pickering '47 spoke about
her experience as one of the first
women to serve as Daily editor-in
chief during World War 11, and the
strong bonds she forged with her
Daily colleagues.
"The people I worked with be
came my very best friends," Picker
ing said.
Former Daily sports editor Gary
Cavalli '7l moderated the panel
and spoke about his work during a
time when the campus atmosphere
challenged the Athletic Depart
ment.
Rich Jaroslovsky '75, editor-in
chief shortly after The Daily be
came legally independent from the
University in 1973, reflected on this
process and historical tensions be
tween the paper and the University.
Jaroslovsky, a technology columnist
for Bloomberg News and Business
week, currently serves on The

Daily's Board of Directors.
Felicity Barringer '72, a New
York Times correspondent and for
mer U.N. bureau chief whose law
suit while editor-in-chief against the
Palo Alto police led to the Supreme
Court decision Zurcher v. The Stan
ford Daily spoke about the skill set
of inquiry, fairness and perspective
she gained as a student journalist.
The era leading up to the
Zurcher case was one of the most
chaotic moments for American uni
versities, making it particularly
challenging for student journalists.
"To follow the journalistic credo
of not being involved was more diffi
cult here, I think, than any other time
in my career," Barrington said of her
time at The Daily, which saw "funda
mental changes in the University."
Jaroslovsky recalled getting
pinned against a glass door by a
crowd while he was reporting on a
sit-in at Old Union his freshman
year.

"I had this moment of, 'What the
hell am I doing here?'" Jaroslovsky
said, who was 17 at the time of the
protest. "When I look back at it
now, I had to do an awful lot of
growing up in a very, very short pe
riod of time."

The most famous incident in
Daily history, the Zurcher case, in
volved a search warrant issued to
prevent the Daily from destroying
photos that could incriminate par
ticipants in a violent protest
though the photo evidence sought
by the Palo Alto police never, in
fact, existed. According to Barring
ton, The Daily had an editorial pol
icy to print all newsworthy photos

and to destroy those not used to
avoid legal action from any in
volved party. The photos from this
particular protest were not incrimi
nating.
The Supreme Court ultimately
ruled against The Daily in 1977,
with Jaroslovsky in the audience for
the oral arguments.
"ft was a blow to freedom of the
press then, and it has continued to
be a blow to freedom of the press,"
Jaroslovsky said. He noted, howev
er, that the case led many states to
pass shield laws to extend some
protection to journalists.
Barringer expressed concern
over the danger of journalists be
coming "one-stop shopping" for
prosecutors, who would prefer not
to have to find witnesses them
selves.
"It's just so much easier to go to
the journalist," she said.
Issues raised in the panel
spanned the ages, notably The
Daily's relationship with Stanford
and with the ASSU.
The ASSU aspect reached a
height of complication when
Jaroslovsky oversaw The Daily's
break from legal association with
Stanford in 1973, becoming one of
the first college newspapers to go
independent.
Jaroslovsky noted that both the
University and The Daily had con
cerns about the affiliation. Univer
sity officials feared that Stanford
could be held accountable for The
Daily's actions, and Daily editors
feared that, if the University ever
wished to, Stanford could legally
censor or search The Daily's con

tent or facilities.
The move to independence
meant that The Daily broke off fi
nancially from the ASSU to be
come The Stanford Daily Publish
ing Corporation.
"We sold it to the student body
as the end of fee assessments [for
subscriptions]," Jaroslovsky said,
calling the campaign "not the most
forthright, but effective," Despite a
brief period in the black. The Daily
found itself needing fee assess
ments again within 18 months, he
added.

The Daily did not re-affiliate
with Stanford, but instead set up the
legal situation that exists today, in
which The Daily remains independ
ent but still receives student fees, as
voted on by the student body in the
special fees process.
The panelists also commented
on their interactions with the Uni
versity presidents of their respec

tive times.
Barringer described The Daily's
relationship with former president
Richard Lyman, who attended the
panel, as, "on both sides respectful
and wary."
Jaroslovsky told a story of pre
dicting to his parents that Lyman
would say, "finally getting rid of
you" upon shaking Jaroslovsky's
hand in a graduation day receiving
line.
"You did not disappoint,"
Jaroslovsky said to Lyman amid au
dience laughter.
The panelists all agreed on the
immense joy and challenges they
experiences as editors-in-chief.
"I'd never worked that hard be
fore and I've never worked that
hard since," Jaroslovsky said. "Or
had as much fun."
