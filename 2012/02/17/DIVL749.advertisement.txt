Claude Lanzmann is a legendary French journalist, political commentator,
and filmmaker whose most renowned work is the classic nine-and-a-half
hour documentary Shoah {1985}. After the liberation of France, he studied
philosophy at the Sorbonne, and it was in Paris that he came to know Jean-
Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. As the editor of Sartre's political-literary
journal, Les Temps Modernes-a position that he holds to this day-Lanzmann
has long been at the center of postwar French culture.
In an event tied to the publication of the English translation of his memoir,
Lanzmann will be reflecting on his life and work in conversation with Regina longo, a scholar
of Film and Media Studies who served as the principle archivist responsible for initiating the
preservation of 350 hours of outtakes from Lanzmann's seminal film Shoah.
Co-sponsored by The Europe Center, France-Stanford Center for interdisciplinary Studied the Department of History and
the Department of French and Italian.
