## EDITORIAL Envisioning a block quarter 
### 
One of the most exciting
ideas proposed in the re
cent Study of Undergrad
uate Education at Stanford Uni
versity (SUES) Report was the
concept of a block quarter. As
outlined in the report, a block
quarter would give students the
option to take three three-week
classes in a quarter instead of the
conventional 10-week quarter.
This structure draws upon the
success of Sophomore College
and other in-depth September
Studies programs in an attempt to
allow for focused learning on a
single subject. The block quarter
would not usurp the current quar
ter system, but would instead be
an option for students during one
or more quarters of their Stanford
careers.

The block quarter offers sever
al advantages. The complaint, "I
really like the class, I just wish I
had more time to focus on it," is all
too commonly heard at Stanford.
The block quarter would allow
for total focus on one subject, and
would also facilitate closer peer
networks among students taking
the same course. A block quarter
would also spread the wealth of
opportunities available through
September Studies to the remain
der of the school year. Because so
many programs occur in Septem
ber — among them Sophomore
College, Arts Intensive, Stanford
Pre-Orientation Trips (SPOT)
and residential staff training
some students must make diffi
cult decisions about which oppor
tunity to pursue. A block quarter
could help mitigate this problem.
Several intellectually exciting
possibilities could emerge from a
block quarter. One is the poten
tial for interdepartmental part
nership. A quarter devoted to
Latin American liberation theol
ogy, for example, could be taught
by professors from the history, po
litical science and religious stud
ies departments, each offering his
or her own unique perspective for
three weeks. Students would have
the chance to work more closely
with professors, exploring differ
ent departments and gaining fac
ulty mentors in the process. A
block quarter would also allow
for more opportunities for off
campus learning, including more
opportunities for local partner
ships and studying abroad. Expe-

riential learning, in the form of
field trips, simulations and hands
on projects, would be a core part
of the curricula. The Board be
lieves that by giving students
space to breathe and time to
focus, the overall quality of under
graduate education at Stanford
would improve.
This is a profound vision for in
stitutional change at Stanford, but
there are several challenges that
must be resolved before the on
paper idea of a block quarter can
be translated into practice. The
primary drawback is access
what happens, for example, if a
student falls ill for a prolonged pe
riod of time? A block quarter is
certainly less forgiving than a tra
ditional quarter structure. The
Board believes that the culture of
a block quarter, which promotes
close interaction between stu
dents and faculty, could help re
solve this problem by allowing for
greater understanding and com
munication in the event of illness.
Stanford could also take lessons
from Colorado College, which
uses a block system exclusively, in
devising equitable and fair poli
cies for illness, injury, and absence.
Another possible drawback is
that not all courses could be
adapted to a block quarter system
students in certain fields, for
example, might not be as well
served by the model. A further
challenge is galvanizing the facul
ty and administrative support
necessary to pilot a block quarter
option. Logistically, several hur
dles must be overcome, primarily
with respect to scheduling the
block quarter. Should the option
be available to everyone, or just
upperclassmen? Would investing
in a block quarter option be detri
mental to the traditional quarter
structure?

With that in mind, while main
taining the status quo is more ex
pedient, the incredible possibili
ties of a block quarter close
student-faculty interaction,
stronger peer networks, experien
tial learning and intense focus
are too exciting to leave unex
plored. The Board envisions a fu
ture in which the block quarter
option is a key part of undergrad
uate education, and encourages
students, faculty and administra
tors to come together to make the
block quarter a reality.

One of the most exciting
ideas proposed in the re
cent Study of Undergrad
uate Education at Stanford Uni
versity (SUES) Report was the
concept of a block quarter. As
outlined in the report, a block
quarter would give students the
option to take three three-week
classes in a quarter instead of the
conventional 10-week quarter.
This structure draws upon the
success of Sophomore College
and other in-depth September
Studies programs in an attempt to
allow for focused learning on a
single subject. The block quarter
would not usurp the current quar
ter system, but would instead be
an option for students during one
or more quarters of their Stanford
careers.

The block quarter offers sever
al advantages. The complaint, "I
really like the class, I just wish I
had more time to focus on it," is all
too commonly heard at Stanford.
The block quarter would allow
for total focus on one subject, and
would also facilitate closer peer
networks among students taking
the same course. A block quarter
would also spread the wealth of
opportunities available through
September Studies to the remain
der of the school year. Because so
many programs occur in Septem
ber — among them Sophomore
College, Arts Intensive, Stanford
Pre-Orientation Trips (SPOT)
and residential staff training
some students must make diffi
cult decisions about which oppor
tunity to pursue. A block quarter
could help mitigate this problem.
Several intellectually exciting
possibilities could emerge from a
block quarter. One is the poten
tial for interdepartmental part
nership. A quarter devoted to
Latin American liberation theol
ogy, for example, could be taught
by professors from the history, po
litical science and religious stud
ies departments, each offering his
or her own unique perspective for
three weeks. Students would have
the chance to work more closely
with professors, exploring differ
ent departments and gaining fac
ulty mentors in the process. A
block quarter would also allow
for more opportunities for off
campus learning, including more
opportunities for local partner
ships and studying abroad. Expe-

riential learning, in the form of
field trips, simulations and hands
on projects, would be a core part
of the curricula. The Board be
lieves that by giving students
space to breathe and time to
focus, the overall quality of under
graduate education at Stanford
would improve.
This is a profound vision for in
stitutional change at Stanford, but
there are several challenges that
must be resolved before the on
paper idea of a block quarter can
be translated into practice. The
primary drawback is access
what happens, for example, if a
student falls ill for a prolonged pe
riod of time? A block quarter is
certainly less forgiving than a tra
ditional quarter structure. The

close interaction between stu
