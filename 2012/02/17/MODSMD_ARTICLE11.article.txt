# EXISTENTIAL FORTUNE COOKIES
## Fashion or fatality? 
### Sebastain Gould 
The philosophers I've most
admired were veterans of
war, and they reflected upon
their service in their philosophy.
One reason I joined the Marine
Corps was to gain a more concrete
understanding of existentialist
thought.

An important aspect of existen
tialism is the idea of authenticity, or
presenting yourself as you really
are. Being a veteran of the Iraq
war, I have worn dog tags for a long
time, because I was required to
wear them during service. Because
of this, I am not quite sure how I
feel about nonmilitary civilians
wearing dog tags on campus. If
they were military personnel, I
would know exactly what to say to
them: "Put the dog tags back in
your shirt and stop being inappro
priate." I have never seen a service
member of the Armed Forces wear
their dog tags outside of their shirt
and not get in trouble for it. Even
then, the only time I've ever seen
service members have them out is
when someone was joking around.
Hollywood, I suppose, has created
the image that they should be worn
for the world to see. But for the rest
of us who aren't in Hollywood, is it
appropriate?
Dog tags were first used by the

United States during the Civil War
by soldiers concerned about what
would happen to their bodies in
the event that they were killed in
battle. This tradition continued
into the First World War, when the
United States made the wearing of
dog tags mandatory. Dog tags
were created for and exist to iden
tify the bodies of the dead.

I assume that because civilians
are wearing the dog tags outside of
their shirts, they are wearing them
to look cool, and not to identify
their bodies in case of death. I do
not have a particular vendetta
against fashion; I just wonder if it is
appropriate attire. Take, for in
stance, the backpacks and clothes
that members of sports teams get
when they win a particular champi
onship, or the rings given to Super
Bowl champions. They signify
something accomplished, actions
completed. It seems as though al
lowing anyone to walk around
Stanford with memorabilia that

says "I won" instead of "I watched"
would get quite confusing.
At this point, you may object
because many people wear sports
jerseys. I will not deny that, but I
think it is different because a jer
sey does not signify a personal ac
complishment. It shows that you
are a fan of some particular indi
vidual or sports team. To my
knowledge, no one wears dog tag
duplicates of their favorite war
hero or veteran.
What is at stake here is authen
ticity. Are you being authentic
when you associate with something
to which you do not belong so as to
bolster your own image? I would
guess the answer to that is no.
When I see someone in a sports jer
sey, I think that person is sports fan.

When I see someone in sweatpants
and a sweatshirt that says Stanford,
I think he or she is an athlete. Like
wise, when I see a person wearing
dog tags, I think that person is in the
military. Invariably, when I ask the
individual wearing the dog tags if
they are in the military, they always
reply with a resounding "No, why
would you think that?" At this
point I become resentful; there are
very few veterans on campus, so my
expectations are let down when I
see someone associating them
selves with the military even with
out realizing it.
Of course, maybe this isn't a
problem of authenticity and it is
just a misunderstanding; maybe,
because of my military discipline, I
think that things should be acer-

tain way because I have been
trained to do so. Maybe dog tags
are, in fact, more important to the
fashion world than I would like to
believe. That said, it just seems as
though something that is meant to
identify the dead should be re
spected; after all, if human life isn't
sacred, then what is? At the end of
the day, impersonating an athlete
by wearing lookalike clothing
seems disingenuous. Wearing dog
tags to look cool even though they
exist to identify dead bodies? Now
that just seems sacrilegious.

United States made the wearing of
dog tags mandatory. Dog tags
were created for and exist to iden
tify the bodies of the dead.

I assume that because civilians
are wearing the dog tags outside of
their shirts, they are wearing them
to look cool, and not to identify
their bodies in case of death. I do
not have a particular vendetta
against fashion; I just wonder if it is
appropriate attire. Take, for in
stance, the backpacks and clothes
that members of sports teams get
when they win a particular champi
onship, or the rings given to Super
Bowl champions. They signify
something accomplished, actions
completed. It seems as though al
lowing anyone to walk around
Stanford with memorabilia that

says "I won" instead of "I watched"
would get quite confusing.
At this point, you may object
because many people wear sports
jerseys. I will not deny that, but I
think it is different because a jer
sey does not signify a personal ac
complishment. It shows that you
are a fan of some particular indi
vidual or sports team. To my
knowledge, no one wears dog tag
duplicates of their favorite war
hero or veteran.
What is at stake here is authen
ticity. Are you being authentic
when you associate with something
to which you do not belong so as to
bolster your own image? I would
guess the answer to that is no.
When I see someone in a sports jer
sey, I think that person is sports fan.

When I see someone in sweatpants
and a sweatshirt that says Stanford,
I think he or she is an athlete. Like
wise, when I see a person wearing
dog tags, I think that person is in the
military. Invariably, when I ask the
individual wearing the dog tags if
they are in the military, they always
reply with a resounding "No, why
would you think that?" At this
point I become resentful; there are
very few veterans on campus, so my
expectations are let down when I
see someone associating them
selves with the military even with
out realizing it.
Of course, maybe this isn't a
problem of authenticity and it is
just a misunderstanding; maybe,
because of my military discipline, I
think that things should be acer-

tain way because I have been
trained to do so. Maybe dog tags
are, in fact, more important to the
fashion world than I would like to
believe. That said, it just seems as
though something that is meant to
identify the dead should be re
spected; after all, if human life isn't
sacred, then what is? At the end of
the day, impersonating an athlete
by wearing lookalike clothing
seems disingenuous. Wearing dog
tags to look cool even though they
exist to identify dead bodies? Now
that just seems sacrilegious.
