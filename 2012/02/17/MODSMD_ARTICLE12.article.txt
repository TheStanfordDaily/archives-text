# MARKS MY WORDS
## Facial profiling 
### Miriam Marks 
What's the first thing you
think of when someone
takes a photo of you?
There is no right answer, although
there may be several borderline
weird answers. Do you think of
somebody fashioning a scrapbook
with it, complete with artfully
pressed flowers, wrinkled paper
and, eventually, the smell of years
of accumulated dust? Maybe. But
if you're a typical young adult in
the 21st century, your first thought
might be more relevant to the
short term: Will this picture be wor
thy of a status as my new Facebook
profile picture?
Sometimes people take pictures
with this "profpic status" foremost
in their minds. The cry of "I really
want a new profile picture!" is not
uncommon at parties, in front of fa
mous landmarks and when hud
dled over a Mac√üook while using
the four-screen, rainbow setting on
Photo Booth. You want to show
everyone that you have friends,
that you go places and that you
have a Mac. It makes sense.

But sometimes you want to
show people that you're pretty
damn good looking. This leads
many of us to choose profile pic
tures that show us at our most at
tractive. And hey, given that hun
dreds of our friends have to look at
that photo every day, who wants to
look anything less than their best?
In the search for the perfect pic
ture, we want to look perfect. It
might be the lighting, makeup or
your friend's million-pixel Canon
camera, but some pictures just
make you look better.
Still, the perfect picture of you
isn't necessarily the perfect profile
picture. At the risk of sounding
like a terrible person, I think of
these as the "misleadingly" attrac
tive profile pictures. One of your
friends took a picture of you, and

you painstakingly edited it en
hanced the warm colors, cropped
out an unsightly limb, and maybe
even used an airbrush on some fa
cial blemish. It certainly makes
sense that you want the most at
tractive version of yourself to be
your profile picture, but this can
have its own set of repercussions.
For one thing, it throws off
those people who are stalking you
but haven't met you yet. I remem
ber the summer of 2007, as the
Stanford Class of 2011 received its
dormitory assignments for the up
coming year. I was placed in Bran
ner Hall, the then-largest freshman
dorm on campus. By August, a
Facebook group for its future resi
dents had emerged, and I frantical
ly spent countless hours looking
over every single profile in order to
pick out my potential new best
friends and love interests.

Soon enough I was confessing
my newest pre-college fear to my
high school friends: Everyone in
my freshman dorm was too attrac
tive. I would walk into a dorm of
gorgeous, tanned Californians
(and some other people too), all
running around the hallway in de
signer swimwear, playing shirtless
Ultimate Frisbee on the Branner
lawn and doing other things that I
thought were normal outside of
Illinois.

And then came move-in day.
The shock repeated itself every
time I met someone who I momen
tarily failed to recognize but even
tually connected to a matching
name on Facebook. In retrospect,
it was a very obvious epiphany:
More often than not, people just
don't look as good in real life as
they do in their carefully selected
profile pictures.
On one hand, you're keeping
others' expectations very high.
Maybe I've never met you and I've

only seen your senior prom picture
online, in which you spent hun
dreds of dollars to look as good as
possible. When I see you in week
five of winter quarter, chugging a
large coffee while huddled in a cu
bicle at Green Library, you're
bound to look far worse. And you
risk looking that much worse to
someone who doesn't know you
very well who will do a double
take when they realize that the
person in the library is that hottie
on Facebook.

And yet, maybe your Facebook
picture is a reminder to your
friends that, when they do see you
looking exhausted and caffeinat
ed, they should remember your
true potential for beauty. They'll
shower your picture with com
ments and likes about how beauti
ful you are, and it's all just genuine
admiration for your appearance.
Appreciation by your friends is, ar
guably, the point of Facebook; if
you don't plan your profile picture
based upon the assumption that
strangers will be stalking you, it
may be for the better.
This is a phenomenon that
translates to any and all headshots,
profiles and even ID pictures. We
want to look as good as possible,
and we want to know we look
good. The fact remains that those
of our friends, colleagues and fam
ily members who see us on a daily
basis know that we typically look a
certain level of average. And guess
what? They still like us.They like us
even though we don't always look
as ideal as our Facebook pictures
would suggest.
