## CLOSE CALL CARDINAL EDGES OUT BEAVERS AT HOME 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's basketball team's last
meeting with Oregon State was filled with
drama a four-overtime thriller in which the
Cardinal barely prevailed. The Beavers stuck
with Stanford again Thursday night, but a
strong second half helped the Cardinal pull
away and secure an 87-82 victory.

The 87 point score was the Cardinal's third
highest output of the season, only surpassed by
its last matchup with Oregon State (15-11,5-9
Pac-12) and season opener against Central
Arkansas. The shooting woes that Stanford
(18-8, 8-6) has faced of late seemingly van
ished, as the Cardinal shot 52.9 percent from
the field and 54.5 percent from behind the arc.
The Cardinal stormed to an early lead be
hind the hot hand of freshman guard Chasson
Randle, who hit two three-pointers in the first
three minutes as the Cardinal took a 8-2 lead.
The Beavers kept themselves in it, however,
behind guard Roberto Nelson. The sopho
more scored 15 of his 19 points in the last 12
minutes of the first half, giving Oregon State a
41-40 lead at the break.
The teams remained close to start the sec

ond half, but Stanford began to pull away be
hind the strong play of sophomore guard
Aaron Bright. With the teams deadlocked at
45, Bright assisted a three by sophomore for
ward John Gage to give the Cardinal a lead it
would not relinquish for the rest of the game.
He then added two additional three-pointers
and assisted an Anthony Brown jumper to put
the Cardinal up 56-47.
In his second game coming off the bench,
Bright had one of his best games of the sea
son. The sophomore scored 20 points and
added seven assists and two steals.

The Beavers refused to go away, however,
and cut the lead to three before Randle took
over again. The freshman hit two threes to
halt any momentum the Beavers gained, de
spite being consistently swarmed by the Ore
gon State defense.
Randle had a third straight exceptional
game, with 24 points and 5 assists. His point
total was a career-high, breaking his record
of 20, which was set against Oregon State.
The freshman is averaging 18.7 points over
his last three contests, while shooting 55.6
percent from the field and an unbelievable
76.4 percent from three-point range. He hit
six of seven threes against the Beavers, de
spite being contested on almost all of
them.

"I'm very happy we won and glad the shots
went down," Randle said afterward. "Honest
ly, all that matters is that we won the game."
Oregon State still kept themselves in the
game, however, with a combination of tough
defense and incredible play on the offensive
end. Threes by Nelson and 6-foot-10 junior
center Angus Brandt cut the Stanford lead to
just three with 15 seconds left. Two subse-

Sophomore guard Aaron Bright (above)
scored 20 points to help the Stanford men's
basketball team defeat Oregon State 87-82
at Maples Pavilion and improve to 18-8
overall and 8-6 in Pac- 12 play,
quent free throws by Brown managed to ice
the game for the Cardinal, giving the sophomore
11 points for the night.
Throughout the game, the Cardinal
demonstrated the form that had it cruising to
the top of the Pac- 12 standings earlier this
year. Stanford again dominated
the boards, with 33 rebounds to
Oregon State's 24. The offensive
rebound differential was just as
striking, with a 10-4 Cardinal ad
vantage.

The quality win wasn't per
fect, however, as the Cardinal
struggled taking care of the ball,

committing 18 turnovers. While
the program definitely has a
bright future with all its young
talent, the inexperience of the
squad was evident at times. The
team made up for it with tremen
dous play on the offensive end
and its typical strong defense.
Currently two and a half
games back from conference
leaders California and Washing
ton, Stanford hopes to continue its
strong play on Saturday against
Oregon. The Ducks sit right above
the Cardinal in the standings, and

a victory over Oregon is crucial in
Stanford's quest to finish the reg
ular season in the top four of the
conference. The top four teams in
the Pac-12 earn a first-round bye
in the Pac-12 Tournament, mean
ing the Cardinal would be one
step closer to earning a spot in the
NCAA Tournament.

Stanford and Oregon tip off
Sunday at Maples Pavilion at 4:30
p.m.
