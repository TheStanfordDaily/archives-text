# BEAVERS NO TROUBLE THIS TIME
## 
### DEAN MCARDLE STAFF WRITER 
Last time the Stanford
women's basketball team took on
Oregon State they scratched out a
67-60 nail-biter at home. Stanford
didn't let OSU hang around in
Thursday's rematch though, scor
ing early and often en route to a
78-45 waxing of the Beavers in
Corvallis.

National Player of the Year
candidate Nnemkadi Ogwumike
led the Cardinal brigade with 27
points. The senior forward kept
pace with Oregon State by her
self in the first half, matching
OSU's 16 total points with 16 of
her own.

Nneka was joined in double
digits by her sister Chiney, who
compiled 10 points. Junior for
ward Joslyn Tinkle commanded
the glass, collecting 14 rebounds.

With the win, the No. 3 Cardi
nal (23-1,14-0 Pac-12) remained
perfect in conference play and
clinched at least a tie for the inau
gural Pac-12 championship. It
would be Stanford's 12th confer
ence title in a row.

Oregon State (17-8,8-6) had its
six-game winning streak snapped
by the loss. The previous victories
all came against conference foes,
and had vaulted them into third
place in the Pac-12.
Alyssa Martin was the only
Oregon State player in double fig
ures with 11 points. The Beavers
leading scorer, freshman Ali Gib
son, was held to just four points in
the contest.

Points in the paint were key for
Stanford. The Cardinal outscored
the Beavers 36-24 in the lane as it
won its 25th straight against OSU.
The Cardinal also played stout
defense, especially in the first half.
The Beavers entered the game

second in the conference in field
goal percentage, sporting an im
pressive 41 percent against Pac-12
opponents. However, Stanford's
high-energy defense held OSU to
just six of 25 (24 percent) shooting
in the first half, and two of 16 (12.5
percent) shooting from behind
the arc in the game.

Both teams' offenses were
sluggish to start the game, and five
minutes into the half the score was
just 4-0 Stanford. However, the
Cardinal picked up the pace and

started finding the bottom of the
net at a torrid pace.
After trading baskets, a three
pointer from freshman sharp
shooter Bonnie Samuelson
sparked a 13-2 Cardinal run that
put the team up 23-7. Senior Lindy
La Rocque, who had nine points
against the Beavers, capped the
run with her own three-ball on an
assist from Samuelson, who also
had nine points.

Stanford stretched its lead
throughout the rest of the first half
and went into the locker room
with a 20-point advantage, 36-16.
Nneka Ogwumike continued
to dominate in the second half,
scoring 11 of Stanford's first 13
points in the period. Oregon State

hung with the Cardinal through
the first eight minutes though, not
allowing the lead to grow any larg
er.

Samuelson again ignited Stan
ford with a deep three, and the
Cardinal outscored the Beavers
17-6 over the next six minutes to
secure the win.
The Cardinal travel down the
road to Eugene to grapple with
University of Oregon on Satur
day. The Ducks are 6-8 in confer

loss to Cal.

Stanford and Oregon tip off in

17-6 over the next six minutes to
