# BEAVERS NO TROUBLE THIS TIME
## 
### DEAN MCARDLE STAFF WRITER 
Last time the Stanford
women's basketball team took on
Oregon State they scratched out a
67-60 nail-biter at home. Stanford
didn't let OSU hang around in
Thursday's rematch though, scor
ing early and often en route to a
78-45 waxing of the Beavers in
Corvallis.

National Player of the Year
candidate Nnemkadi Ogwumike
led the Cardinal brigade with 27
points. The senior forward kept
pace with Oregon State by her
self in the first half, matching
OSU's 16 total points with 16 of
her own.

Nneka was joined in double
digits by her sister Chiney, who
compiled 10 points. Junior for
ward Joslyn Tinkle commanded
the glass, collecting 14 rebounds.

With the win, the No. 3 Cardi
nal (23-1,14-0 Pac-12) remained
perfect in conference play and
clinched at least a tie for the inau
gural Pac-12 championship. It
would be Stanford's 12th confer
ence title in a row.

Oregon State (17-8,8-6) had its
six-game winning streak snapped
by the loss. The previous victories
all came against conference foes,
and had vaulted them into third
place in the Pac-12.
Alyssa Martin was the only
Oregon State player in double fig
ures with 11 points. The Beavers
leading scorer, freshman Ali Gib
son, was held to just four points in
the contest.

Points in the paint were key for
Stanford. The Cardinal outscored
the Beavers 36-24 in the lane as it
won its 25th straight against OSU.
The Cardinal also played stout
defense, especially in the first half.
