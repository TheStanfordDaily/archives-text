## Cardinal ready for road to Omaha 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Eight months after making an early exit
from its Super Regional in North Carolina, the
Stanford baseball team will be back in action
tonight, hosting No. 10 Vanderbilt in the first
contest of a three-game series.
The No. 2 Cardinal faces its highest expec
tations in a decade, with a trio of junior presea
son Ail-Americans set to lead the Pac-12 fa
vorite on another deep postseason run. Pro
jected first overall MLB draft pick Mark
Appel will start on Friday nights for the sec
ond straight year, while third baseman
Stephen Piscotty and shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger headline a lineup that returns

seven of eight position players.
The man behind it all is Mark Marquess,
and 25 years after the illustrious head coach
took home the first of back-to-back national
championships the only titles in Stanford
baseball history Marquess is excited to get
back on the top step of the Sunken Diamond
dugout against a visiting opponent.
"We're tired of playing our own guys," he
joked. "If the pitching does well you go, 'Oh
my god, we don't have any hitting.' And if the
hitting does well you go, 'What's wrong with
our pitching?' I can't win as a coach."
Luckily for Marquess, the Cardinal doesn't
have all that much to be concerned about in ei
ther category.
Despite the loss of starters Jordan Pries and

Danny Sandbrink, as well as closer Chris
Reed, to the draft, Stanford boasts one of the
most powerful one-two punches in college
baseball. Appel and Saturday starter Brett
Mooneyham, who missed all of last year with a
finger injury, are a dynamic pitching duo. Orig
inally slated as the Cardinal's 2011 Friday
starter after leading the team with 99 strike
outs as a sophomore, Mooneyham is ready to
reestablish himself in the rotation.

"Any time you get something you love to
do taken away from you and there's nothing
you can do about it, it's difficult," he said. "I'm
pretty excited to get out there on the mound
this Saturday and get that year-and-a-half hia-
tus out of the way."
Filling in for Mooneyham last
year was Appel, who went 6-7 but
posted a stellar 3.02 ERA in 17
starts.

"Everything you read about
[Appel] is true: He's a great player,
he's got a great fastball and he's a
great competitor, but he's also a
great person and a great team
mate," Diekroeger said. "We're
lucky to have him ... being able to
face a guy like that in these inter
squads makes the entire team bet
ter."

After his breakout sophomore
season, Appel has had to deal with
the attention of being considered
one of top college prospects in
baseball. He cites Andrew Luck as
a role model in handling the na
tional hype.
But Diekroeger and Piscotty
have also received their fair share
of hype, as they are also projected
to go in the first few rounds of the
MLB draft.

"I think it's been great that we
have other guys that are projected

high in the draft, because we all
keep each other really down to
earth and focused on the season,"
Appel said. "We don't let our
minds drift on the draft, because
we can't control that."

Marquess will be looking to de
cide on a closer in the coming
weeks, but he isn't concerned that
the spot hasn't been solidified be
fore opening day. Reed an
eventual first-round pick by the
Dodgers began as the squad's
Saturday starter last year before
giving up seven runs in 4.2 innings
in his first outing against Rice.

Reed was converted to a closer,
and went on to post 52 strikeouts
and allow only 39 hits to go along
with his nine saves.
"That became the difference in
our season," Marquess said.
Stanford's hitting wasn't all too
shabby either, and with all seven of
the squad's top sluggers returning
to the lineup, opponents are going
to have a hard time keeping the
Cardinal off the board. Standouts
include Piscotty, who led the team

with a .364 average last season, and
2011 Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
Brian Ragira.
Even though their lineup is
made up entirely of sophomores
and juniors, the Cardinal has good
chemistry after playing together all
of last season.

"It's hard to really explain, but
just being part of that lineup, there's
just something about it; we just have
a confidence to it," Diekroeger said.
"It's a swagger you can't measure.
It's a great feeling."
The squad lost a leader in catch
er Zach Jones, a four-year starter
who spent his last three years be
hind the plate, and the fight to fill
his spot is a still a four-horse race.
Favorites include redshirt junior
Christian Griffiths and freshman
Wayne Taylor, a Texas play er of the
year in high school. Marquess indi
cated he was open to rotating at
the catcher spot for a good chunk
of the season.

If the Cardinal can pick up
where it left off it has a good shot of
winning the Pac-12 and hosting a

NCAA Regional, a focal point
after its postseason run was cut
short last year.

"We realized how hard it is to
go on the road in Regionals, and
then go on the road in Super Re
gionals and still make it to
Omaha," Appel said. "[Associate
Head Coach Dean] Stotz is our
statistics guy, and I forgot what he
said but it's less than five percent
that something like that would
happen."

Finishing first in the conference
is going to be no easy task, with No.
5 Arizona and three other ranked
Pac-12 foes standing in Stanford's
way. But first comes a stretch of
tough nonconference series at
home, including three-game sets
against No. 10 Vanderbilt, No. 13
Texas and No. 6 Rice before the
Pac-12 opener against USC on
March 24.

"We're No. 2 now, but we won't
be ranked No. 2 in four weeks be

cause somebody's going to be un
defeated," Marquess said. "I'd love
to be wrong, but we're not going to
be undefeated after four weeks
with the teams that we're playing,
which is good because it shows us
that we need to improve and put
guys in the right spots."
And with the daunting task of
living up to top-five expectations
ahead, Marquess knows exactly
who he's looking to.
"When you have your most suc
cessful season it's your older guys,"
he said. "Is Piscotty going to have
his best year? Is Kenny
Diekroeger going to have is best
year? Is Jake Stewart going to have
his best year? And more impor
tantly, is Mark Appel going to have
his best year, and is Brett Mooney
ham going to have the best year of
his career? Then we're good."

starter after leading the team with 99 strike
outs as a sophomore, Mooneyham is ready to
reestablish himself in the rotation.

"Any time you get something you love to
do taken away from you and there's nothing
you can do about it, it's difficult," he said. "I'm
pretty excited to get out there on the mound
this Saturday and get that year-and-a-half hia-
tus out of the way."
Filling in for Mooneyham last
year was Appel, who went 6-7 but
posted a stellar 3.02 ERA in 17
starts.

"Everything you read about
[Appel] is true: He's a great player,
he's got a great fastball and he's a
great competitor, but he's also a
great person and a great team
mate," Diekroeger said. "We're
lucky to have him ... being able to
face a guy like that in these inter
squads makes the entire team bet
ter."

After his breakout sophomore
season, Appel has had to deal with
the attention of being considered
one of top college prospects in
baseball. He cites Andrew Luck as
a role model in handling the na
tional hype.
But Diekroeger and Piscotty
have also received their fair share
of hype, as they are also projected
to go in the first few rounds of the
MLB draft.

"I think it's been great that we
have other guys that are projected

high in the draft, because we all
keep each other really down to
earth and focused on the season,"
Appel said. "We don't let our
minds drift on the draft, because
we can't control that."

Marquess will be looking to de
cide on a closer in the coming
weeks, but he isn't concerned that
the spot hasn't been solidified be
fore opening day. Reed an
eventual first-round pick by the
Dodgers began as the squad's
Saturday starter last year before
giving up seven runs in 4.2 innings
in his first outing against Rice.

Reed was converted to a closer,
and went on to post 52 strikeouts
and allow only 39 hits to go along
with his nine saves.
"That became the difference in
our season," Marquess said.
Stanford's hitting wasn't all too
shabby either, and with all seven of
the squad's top sluggers returning
to the lineup, opponents are going
to have a hard time keeping the
Cardinal off the board. Standouts
include Piscotty, who led the team

with a .364 average last season, and
2011 Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
Brian Ragira.
Even though their lineup is
made up entirely of sophomores
and juniors, the Cardinal has good
chemistry after playing together all
of last season.

"It's hard to really explain, but
just being part of that lineup, there's
just something about it; we just have
a confidence to it," Diekroeger said.
"It's a swagger you can't measure.
It's a great feeling."
The squad lost a leader in catch
er Zach Jones, a four-year starter
who spent his last three years be
hind the plate, and the fight to fill
his spot is a still a four-horse race.
Favorites include redshirt junior
Christian Griffiths and freshman
Wayne Taylor, a Texas play er of the
year in high school. Marquess indi
cated he was open to rotating at
the catcher spot for a good chunk
of the season.

If the Cardinal can pick up
where it left off it has a good shot of
winning the Pac-12 and hosting a

NCAA Regional, a focal point
after its postseason run was cut
short last year.

"We realized how hard it is to
go on the road in Regionals, and
then go on the road in Super Re
gionals and still make it to
Omaha," Appel said. "[Associate
Head Coach Dean] Stotz is our
statistics guy, and I forgot what he
said but it's less than five percent
that something like that would
happen."

Finishing first in the conference
is going to be no easy task, with No.
5 Arizona and three other ranked
Pac-12 foes standing in Stanford's
way. But first comes a stretch of
tough nonconference series at
home, including three-game sets
against No. 10 Vanderbilt, No. 13
Texas and No. 6 Rice before the
Pac-12 opener against USC on
March 24.

"We're No. 2 now, but we won't
be ranked No. 2 in four weeks be

cause somebody's going to be un
defeated," Marquess said. "I'd love
to be wrong, but we're not going to
be undefeated after four weeks
with the teams that we're playing,
which is good because it shows us
that we need to improve and put
guys in the right spots."
And with the daunting task of
living up to top-five expectations
ahead, Marquess knows exactly
who he's looking to.
"When you have your most suc
cessful season it's your older guys,"
he said. "Is Piscotty going to have
his best year? Is Kenny
Diekroeger going to have is best
year? Is Jake Stewart going to have
his best year? And more impor
tantly, is Mark Appel going to have
his best year, and is Brett Mooney
ham going to have the best year of
his career? Then we're good."

Junior third baseman Stephen Piscotty (above), last season's team leader in batting average, will lead the
Stanford baseball team as it opens its season against No. 10 Vanderbilt tonight at Sunken Diamond.
Eight months after making an early exit
from its Super Regional in North Carolina, the
Stanford baseball team will be back in action
tonight, hosting No. 10 Vanderbilt in the first
contest of a three-game series.
The No. 2 Cardinal faces its highest expec
tations in a decade, with a trio of junior presea
son Ail-Americans set to lead the Pac-12 fa
vorite on another deep postseason run. Pro
jected first overall MLB draft pick Mark
Appel will start on Friday nights for the sec
ond straight year, while third baseman
Stephen Piscotty and shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger headline a lineup that returns

seven of eight position players.
The man behind it all is Mark Marquess,
and 25 years after the illustrious head coach
took home the first of back-to-back national
championships the only titles in Stanford
baseball history Marquess is excited to get
back on the top step of the Sunken Diamond
dugout against a visiting opponent.
"We're tired of playing our own guys," he
joked. "If the pitching does well you go, 'Oh
my god, we don't have any hitting.' And if the
hitting does well you go, 'What's wrong with
our pitching?' I can't win as a coach."
Luckily for Marquess, the Cardinal doesn't
have all that much to be concerned about in ei
ther category.
Despite the loss of starters Jordan Pries and

Danny Sandbrink, as well as closer Chris
Reed, to the draft, Stanford boasts one of the
most powerful one-two punches in college
baseball. Appel and Saturday starter Brett
Mooneyham, who missed all of last year with a
finger injury, are a dynamic pitching duo. Orig
