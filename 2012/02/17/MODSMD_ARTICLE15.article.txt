## Cardinal ready for road to Omaha 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Eight months after making an early exit
from its Super Regional in North Carolina, the
Stanford baseball team will be back in action
tonight, hosting No. 10 Vanderbilt in the first
contest of a three-game series.
The No. 2 Cardinal faces its highest expec

Reed, to the draft, Stanford boasts one of the
most powerful one-two punches in college

Mooneyham, who missed all of last year with a

outs as a sophomore, Mooneyham is ready to
reestablish himself in the rotation.

"Any time you get something you love to
do taken away from you and there's nothing
