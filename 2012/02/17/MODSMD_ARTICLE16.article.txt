# Pro sports and smarts do mix

At Stanford, were more
than used to world-class
athletes who are also
world-class students.
We take classes with
them, we bike around with them and
we stand with them in line at Tresid
der.

On the other hand, we all know
that most professional athletes don't
exactly fit into the same category, es
pecially not NBA players. They leave
school early or skip it altogether, and
oftentimes an abundance of idiocy en
sues: drug use, gun charges and sexual
harassment allegations
Entering the fray is Jeremy Lin, an
(until recently) unknown Harvard
graduate who has taken the NBA by
storm by scoring a record 136 points
in his first five starts and adding 15
assists in his sixth one on Wednesday.
And, of course, he's made the
New York Knicks possibly the
smartest team in the league along
side recent Stanford star Landry
Fields. The only other team in the
NBA with two players in the Ivy
League/Stanford category is the
Phoenix Suns, which boasts former
Cardinal standouts Josh Childress
and Robin Lopez. Together, Lin and
Fields are easily the top student-ath
letes of their basketball graduating
class, which says quite a lot.
But even given the NBAs repu
tation for hosting some degree of
hooliganism, it amazes me how sur
prised the sporting world is that Lin
was a Harvard product. There might
not be an overwhelming track
record of NBA stars who come from
the Ivy League, but when Duke and
Georgetown are two of the sport's
perennial college powers, you have
to acknowledge that a basketball
player can be a world-class talent
and do well in school, too.
What's more, the three other
main American sports baseball,
hockey and football all have
more players from the Ivies or Stan
ford than the NBA does, though, of
course, these sports' teams are signif
icantly larger. Cardinal greats actual
ly make up a significant chunk of the
elite schools' MLB representation,
with 11 former Stanford players in
the big leagues to go along with six
Ivy Leaguers.
But believe it or not, it's the two
pro sports that we hold so near and
dear to our hearts for their bone
crunching toughness football and
hockey that have the most im
pressive contingents of academic
athletes.

The NFL has 21 Stanford players
on active rosters and 10 former Ivy
League athletes. If you're willing to
bite the bullet and add Cal, with 37
more players, to the list, you have an
entire team's worth of world-class
cerebral talent playing at the highest
level of pro football. That might not
match Ohio State or Miami, who re
spectively had 70 and 65 players
taken in the draft from 1999 to 2009,
but the elite academic schools still
have a notable group of players in the
NFL.

The same is true in hockey, even
without the representation of Stan
ford and Cal, for obvious reasons.
Believe it or not, the Ivy League con
tingent of 26 NHL players is actually
a tougher bunch than the rest of the
league, including scrappy enforcers
such as the Sharks' Douglas Murray
and the Ducks' George Parros from
Cornell and Princeton, respectively.
Parros and Kings winger Kevin
Westgarth (a Princeton grad) both
cracked the top 40 in penalty min
utes last season, with Parros leading
the league in fighting majors (27) and
Westgarth in 10th place. Those two
actually fought each other two nights
in a row last April.
Not exactly the kind of guys most
people would expect to run into with
in those hallowed halls of ivy. But with
Stanford remaining relevant in foot
ball and Harvard floating around the
edge of rankings for much of the bas
ketball season, I don't see why not.

You better believe that we nerds
are only going to keep rising to the top
in the next few years. Andrew Luck
and Aaron Rodgers will be dominat
ing the NFL for the foreseeable fu
ture, Mark Appel is the early favorite
to snag baseball's No. 1 pick this sum
mer and, until further notice, the Lin
sanity is going to continue in Madison
Square Garden.

Smarts and athletic talent: looks
like you can have it all.

Joseph Beyda often starts hockey
fights with Harvard grads who ask
him for some insight into the market
economy of the Southern Colonies.
