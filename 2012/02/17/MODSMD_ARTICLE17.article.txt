# BIG TEST AGAINST NATION'S BEST
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team switches its focus this
weekend to tournament play at the annual National
Team Indoor Championships in Charlottesville, Va.
Stanford is coming off a hard loss against Fresno State, in
which the Cardinal could not close out the win at home
at the Taube Family Tennis Center.
It has been a challenging month in general for Stan
ford (6-3), which suffered its worst loss in recent years by
getting blown out 7-0 against USC two weeks ago. The
squad then followed that performance up with a 6-1
drubbing at the hands of UCLA. And with the most re
cent loss against Fresno State, the Cardinal dropped to
an uncharacteristic 2-3 so far in the month.

The stakes change this weekend at the National Team
Indoor Championships. Stanford qualified for the presti
gious event by defeating Saint Mary's and Santa Clara at
the end of January to advance to the third round of the
championship and secure its trip to Charlottesville.
Sixteen of the top teams in the country will be in
Charlottesville this weekend to participate in one of the
most important tournaments before May's NCAA
Championships. The entire top five teams of the current
college tennis rankings will be in Virginia: No. 1 USC, No.
2 Virginia, No. 3 Ohio State, No. 4 Georgia and No. 5
Florida.

Stanford is the ninth seed in the 16-team tournament
and will start off by facing a tough opponent in No. 7 Bay
lor. If Stanford wins its first match it will face No. 2 Vir
ginia, a rematch of Stanford's final match last season
where the Cardinal suffered a heartbreaking Sweet Six
teen loss in the NCAA tournament. If the rematch is to
happen, it will surely be an emotional one for the Cardi
nal players, who were so close to upsetting the nation's
No. 1 team last year.

All eyes this week will be on Stanford's senior captain
Bradley Klahn, who may or may not be returning from
injury. Klahn made his season debut on Tuesday against
Fresno State, playing in the doubles matches with his tra
ditional partner Ryan Thacher. Klahn and Thacher won
their doubles match handily, but Klahn sat out the singles
matches and was a spectator for his team's tough loss.
Perhaps this weekend head coach John Whitlinger will
elect to reunite his team and let Klahn reclaim his old
spot at the top of the Cardinal rotation.
After Stanford pulled out a tough win against BYU
last week and prepared to face Fresno State on Tuesday,
senior Walker Kehrer said, "Winning matches when you
are not at your best is always key and I think we did that
Friday. What I also think was important about this win is
that our best tennis is definitely yet to come. What is im
portant is that we keep working towards our best tennis,
and hopefully that will come in May."
Kehrer has the right attitude if the Cardinal is going
to overcome these early season struggles and have a shot
at accomplishing their perennial preseason goal of win
ning the Pac-12 and NCAA Championships.
A major litmus test will occur this weekend against
the best teams in the country. Stanford will hit the courts
at 3:30 p.m. PST against Baylor on Friday in Char
lottesville, Va.
