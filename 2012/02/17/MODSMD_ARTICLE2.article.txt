## Menlo Park 'likes' Facebook, seeks local benefits from company 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Menlo Park has been responding enthusiasti
cally to Facebook's proposed expansion of its
headquarters, with citizens and officials express
ing their support for the development. Support
ers detailed a list of long-term and short-term
benefits the city expects to receive from Face
book at a Menlo Park city council meeting last
Tuesday.

While Menlo Park has largely been receptive
to Facebook's growth, its officials have acknowl
edged that residents and city representatives in
neighboring East Palo Alto are worried about
the transportation and health implications re
sulting from the expansion. Officials from both
cities are set to meet today.

Facebook relocated to its current headquar
ters in Menlo Park, which is made up of two ad
jacent sites, in December. The first site. East
Campus, is the former Sun Microsystems Cam
pus located at 1601 Willow Road.The second site,
West Campus, was formerly part of the Tyco
Electronics campus, located at 312 and 313 Con
stitution Drive. According to the Facebook rep
resentatives who attended the council meeting,
Facebook is currently only requesting to develop
its East Campus.

In December, Facebook relocated its headquarters from Stanford
Research Park in Palo Alto to the former headquarters of Sun Mi
crosystems at 1601 Willow Road in Menlo Park. In the coming year,
the social networking company plans to expand its campus and
seeks to amend the existing conditional development permit in
Menlo Park by increasing the existing employee cap to roughly 6,600
employees, concerning neighbor East Palo Alto.
