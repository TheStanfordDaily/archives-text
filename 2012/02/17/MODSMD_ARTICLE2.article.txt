# Facebook expansion stirs local debate
## Menlo Park 'likes' Facebook, seeks local benefits from company 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Menlo Park has been responding enthusiasti
cally to Facebook's proposed expansion of its
headquarters, with citizens and officials express
ing their support for the development. Support
ers detailed a list of long-term and short-term
benefits the city expects to receive from Face
book at a Menlo Park city council meeting last
Tuesday.

While Menlo Park has largely been receptive
to Facebook's growth, its officials have acknowl
edged that residents and city representatives in
neighboring East Palo Alto are worried about
the transportation and health implications re
sulting from the expansion. Officials from both
cities are set to meet today.

Facebook relocated to its current headquar
ters in Menlo Park, which is made up of two ad
jacent sites, in December. The first site. East
Campus, is the former Sun Microsystems Cam
pus located at 1601 Willow Road.The second site,
West Campus, was formerly part of the Tyco
Electronics campus, located at 312 and 313 Con
stitution Drive. According to the Facebook rep
resentatives who attended the council meeting,
Facebook is currently only requesting to develop
its East Campus.

In December, Facebook relocated its headquarters from Stanford
Research Park in Palo Alto to the former headquarters of Sun Mi
crosystems at 1601 Willow Road in Menlo Park. In the coming year,
the social networking company plans to expand its campus and
seeks to amend the existing conditional development permit in
Menlo Park by increasing the existing employee cap to roughly 6,600
employees, concerning neighbor East Palo Alto.

As a trade-off for increasing in
size and for the social and envi
ronmental impact of the expan
sion, Facebook said it would com
pensate Menlo Park. The city of
Menlo Park held a council meet
ing earlier this week on Tuesday,
Feb. 14, where officials discussed
parameters the city would like to
negotiate with Facebook as part
of the development agreement.
According to a handout from
the city's Community Develop
ment Department,such items in
cluded, "providing a source of
on-going revenue for as long as
the land use entitlement to ex
ceed 3,600 employees is in place,
providing one-time items in the
form of public improvements or
studies that would benefit the
surrounding area, providing a
mechanism for funding pro
grams and services that meet on
going community needs, pursu
ing a commitment to fund hous
ing opportunities in the city and
surrounding region and pursu
ing a trip cap penalty amount
that is severe enough to ensure
compliance with the project de
scription."

Menlo Park released a draft
Environmental Impact Report
for public review in Dec. 2011 to
address the effect of Facebook's
expansion on Menlo Park's sur
rounding natural ecosystems.
According to the staff report
given during the Feb. 14 meeting,
the city's consultants, "have
begun the process of responding
to comments and preparing the
Final Environmental Report,
which is anticipated to be re
leased in mid- to late April
2012."

Both councilmembers and
Menlo Park residents mentioned
that some immediate environ
mental benefits Facebook could
provide include providing fund
ing for bike improvements on
Bay Road, University Avenue
and Willow Road, as well as
opening shuttles for the public to
travel to local train stations.
According to an email from
Menlo Park Mayor Kirsten
Keith, the city also hopes to re
quest from Facebook a fee in
lieu of revenue from sales tax,
the establishment of a communi
ty foundation and trip cap prior
ities.

"The discussion is all open
and transparent," Keith contin
ued.

Many community members in
attendance expressed support for
Facebook, mentioning that Face
book has already been an "ex
tremely positive presence."
According to these members,
who included students and repre
sentatives from businesses and
organizations, Facebook has
been active in the community, is
considerate of the environment
and has been an asset to the city's
economic marketability.

"Facebook is that good neigh
bor," said Maggie Creighton, the
creator of the Exploratory Expe
riences Program, during the
council meeting. The Explorato
ry Experiences Program is a local
mentoring program for Palo Alto
and Menlo Park students.

Later during a separate inter

view, Creighton stated that Face
book not only benefits schools in
Menlo Park, but also schools in
East Palo Alto.

"The philosophy of Facebook
is very different from other com
panies— more open and more
interactive," she added, mention
ing that Facebook encourages its
employees to go into schools and
tutor students in different sub
jects.

Creighton also mentioned
that Facebook is greener than the
previous corporation on the
same land entitlement.

The city councilmembers each
expressed their own concerns
during the council meeting.

Councilmember Andrew
Cohen mentioned affordable
housing as a priority.
"Ffousing is an important
issue for several reasons one
of which is that East Palo Alto is
concerned that Facebook coming
to town is going to displace a lot
of people," Cohen said.
"Apparently there is already
some relocation of people from
Bell Haven to East Palo Alto," he
said later in an interview with The
Daily.

"We should be working as
partners to get what new housing
we can, not trying to stop this
project or any other project that
already has received a welcome
in the area," Cohen added. "We
all seem to agree that Facebook is
a welcome addition to our local
business community. The idea is
to work collaboratively to come
up with the best plan to increase
our housing stock."
Councilmember Kelly Fer
gusson described Facebook's ex
pansion as an "opportunity to
pull all the threads together."
Fergusson said she is particu
larly interested in levy shoreline
restoration work, as well as tran
sit station planning.
"We have a long list," Fergus
son said, referring to the list of
potential areas that could be im
proved with the opportunities
Facebook intends to open for
Menlo Park. "But this is a catalyst
for all of this to be brought to
gether. We're seeking a fair agree
ment. It's not just about Menlo
Park, but also East Palo Alto."

"It's a great opportunity,"
Councilmember Richard Cline
said, referring to the expansion of
Facebook. "But it's not going to
save everyone's life. It's time to
put a reality hat on there's a lot
of pressure on Facebook. We
can't give everyone free housing,
but there are programs that Face
book can create, ways that Face
book can benefit the community,
and we should enter into negotia
tions like that."

A Facebook spokesperson
wrote in an email to The Daily
that the company is "hopeful that
the city finds the benefit of having
Facebook in Menlo Park far out
weighs the impact of our move."
"We care about being a good
neighbor to East Palo Alto resi
dents and are meeting with city
representatives Friday," Keith
said. "We are excited about hav
ing Facebook in Menlo Park and
look forward to a long lasting re
lationship."
The negotiation team plans to
return with a draft term sheet on
April 17.

given during the Feb. 14 meeting,
the city's consultants, "have
begun the process of responding
to comments and preparing the
Final Environmental Report,
which is anticipated to be re
leased in mid- to late April
2012."

Both councilmembers and
Menlo Park residents mentioned
that some immediate environ
mental benefits Facebook could
provide include providing fund
ing for bike improvements on
Bay Road, University Avenue
and Willow Road, as well as
opening shuttles for the public to
travel to local train stations.
According to an email from
Menlo Park Mayor Kirsten
Keith, the city also hopes to re
quest from Facebook a fee in
lieu of revenue from sales tax,
the establishment of a communi
ty foundation and trip cap prior
ities.

"The discussion is all open
and transparent," Keith contin
ued.

Many community members in
attendance expressed support for
Facebook, mentioning that Face
book has already been an "ex
tremely positive presence."
According to these members,
who included students and repre
sentatives from businesses and
organizations, Facebook has
been active in the community, is
considerate of the environment
and has been an asset to the city's
economic marketability.

"Facebook is that good neigh
bor," said Maggie Creighton, the
creator of the Exploratory Expe
riences Program, during the
council meeting. The Explorato
ry Experiences Program is a local
mentoring program for Palo Alto
and Menlo Park students.

Later during a separate inter

view, Creighton stated that Face
book not only benefits schools in
Menlo Park, but also schools in
East Palo Alto.

"The philosophy of Facebook
is very different from other com
panies— more open and more
interactive," she added, mention
ing that Facebook encourages its
employees to go into schools and
tutor students in different sub
jects.

Creighton also mentioned
that Facebook is greener than the
previous corporation on the
same land entitlement.

The city councilmembers each
expressed their own concerns
during the council meeting.

Councilmember Andrew
Cohen mentioned affordable
housing as a priority.
"Ffousing is an important
issue for several reasons one
of which is that East Palo Alto is
concerned that Facebook coming
to town is going to displace a lot
of people," Cohen said.
"Apparently there is already
some relocation of people from
Bell Haven to East Palo Alto," he
said later in an interview with The
Daily.

"We should be working as
partners to get what new housing
we can, not trying to stop this
project or any other project that
already has received a welcome
in the area," Cohen added. "We
all seem to agree that Facebook is
a welcome addition to our local
business community. The idea is
to work collaboratively to come
up with the best plan to increase
our housing stock."
Councilmember Kelly Fer
gusson described Facebook's ex
pansion as an "opportunity to
pull all the threads together."
Fergusson said she is particu
larly interested in levy shoreline
restoration work, as well as tran
sit station planning.
"We have a long list," Fergus
son said, referring to the list of
potential areas that could be im
proved with the opportunities
Facebook intends to open for
Menlo Park. "But this is a catalyst
for all of this to be brought to
gether. We're seeking a fair agree
ment. It's not just about Menlo
Park, but also East Palo Alto."

"It's a great opportunity,"
Councilmember Richard Cline
said, referring to the expansion of
Facebook. "But it's not going to
save everyone's life. It's time to
put a reality hat on there's a lot
of pressure on Facebook. We
can't give everyone free housing,
but there are programs that Face
book can create, ways that Face
book can benefit the community,
and we should enter into negotia
tions like that."

A Facebook spokesperson
wrote in an email to The Daily
that the company is "hopeful that
the city finds the benefit of having
Facebook in Menlo Park far out
weighs the impact of our move."
"We care about being a good
neighbor to East Palo Alto resi
dents and are meeting with city
representatives Friday," Keith
said. "We are excited about hav
ing Facebook in Menlo Park and
look forward to a long lasting re
lationship."
The negotiation team plans to
return with a draft term sheet on
April 17.

Menlo Park has been responding enthusiasti
cally to Facebook's proposed expansion of its
headquarters, with citizens and officials express
ing their support for the development. Support
ers detailed a list of long-term and short-term
benefits the city expects to receive from Face
book at a Menlo Park city council meeting last
Tuesday.

While Menlo Park has largely been receptive
to Facebook's growth, its officials have acknowl
edged that residents and city representatives in
neighboring East Palo Alto are worried about
the transportation and health implications re
sulting from the expansion. Officials from both
cities are set to meet today.

Facebook relocated to its current headquar
ters in Menlo Park, which is made up of two ad
jacent sites, in December. The first site. East
Campus, is the former Sun Microsystems Cam
pus located at 1601 Willow Road.The second site,
West Campus, was formerly part of the Tyco
Electronics campus, located at 312 and 313 Con
stitution Drive. According to the Facebook rep
resentatives who attended the council meeting,
Facebook is currently only requesting to develop
its East Campus.

In December, Facebook relocated its headquarters from Stanford
Research Park in Palo Alto to the former headquarters of Sun Mi
crosystems at 1601 Willow Road in Menlo Park. In the coming year,
the social networking company plans to expand its campus and
seeks to amend the existing conditional development permit in
Menlo Park by increasing the existing employee cap to roughly 6,600
employees, concerning neighbor East Palo Alto.


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
As a trade-off for increasing in
size and for the social and envi
ronmental impact of the expan
sion, Facebook said it would com
pensate Menlo Park. The city of
Menlo Park held a council meet
ing earlier this week on Tuesday,
Feb. 14, where officials discussed
parameters the city would like to
negotiate with Facebook as part
of the development agreement.
According to a handout from
the city's Community Develop
ment Department,such items in
cluded, "providing a source of
on-going revenue for as long as
the land use entitlement to ex
ceed 3,600 employees is in place,
providing one-time items in the
form of public improvements or
studies that would benefit the
surrounding area, providing a
mechanism for funding pro
grams and services that meet on
going community needs, pursu
ing a commitment to fund hous
ing opportunities in the city and
surrounding region and pursu
ing a trip cap penalty amount
that is severe enough to ensure
compliance with the project de
scription."

Menlo Park released a draft
Environmental Impact Report
for public review in Dec. 2011 to
address the effect of Facebook's
expansion on Menlo Park's sur
rounding natural ecosystems.
