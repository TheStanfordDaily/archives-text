## TOP 5 WHITNEY HOUSTON SONGS 
### 
With the sudden, tragic death of Whitney Houston this past week, here at
Intermission we would like to celebrate her career by highlighting her five best
songs. A cornerstone of 'Bos and early '9os pop, Whitney's incredible voice carried
everything from lighthearted pop songs to powerful ballads. Here are some of our
favorites.

"I Will Always Love You"
Although this classic ballad was originally sung by Dolly Parton, it will forever be remem
bered as Whitney's signature tune. Made famous when it was featured in the soundtrack
of "The Bodyguard," one of Whitney's best movies, the song features an unforgettable
chorus that shows off Whitney's pristine vocals. Now a favorite of drunk people and
karaoke singers alike two groups that frequently overlap this song is a testament to
the fact that we will always love Whitney.

"I Wanna Dance with Somebody"
This 'Bos pop track shot to the top of the charts when it debuted on Whitney's second
studio album, "Whitney." Featuring a classic 'Bos pop sound, it's addictive and natural
ly— very danceable. The accompanying video is even better, featuring Whitney dancing
her heart out in neon clothes and eyeliner. Definitely use this for inspiration for your next
'Bos theme party!

"So Emotional"
Another hit from "Whitney," "So Emotional" has the same upbeat tempo as "I Wanna
Dance with Somebody," but a little more romantic angst. Whitney shows off her vocal
range with a powerful chorus that's bound to get lodged in your head.

"The Greatest Love of All"
Many regard this song as Whitney's signature ballad. It's vocally challenging, but she pulls
off the highs and lows with ease, making it a powerful and uplifting song. It's also a nice
break from pop songs that focus on romantic troubles, instead highlighting self-worth and
family loyalty.

The Star Spangled Banner
Leave it to Whitney Houston to take a difficult-to-sing anthem and turn it into a chart-top
ping hit. She reinvented the classic during the 1991 Super Bowl with flourishes and runs
that forever changed how soloists sing the national anthem. Unfortunately, no one can do
it quite as well as Whitney; we will always be in awe of her unique interpretation.
