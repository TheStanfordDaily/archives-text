On Monday and Tuesday mornings,
you can reliably find me on
"Television Without Pity," fre
quently clicking refresh in anticipation of
Jacob Clifton's latest "Gossip Girl" or
"The Good Wife" recap. I'm not alone. The
"recap" is a relatively new genre of writing,
popularized by the website "Television
Without Pity," in which the writer gives a
detailed description of a television episode
whilst editorializing, sometimes satirizing
and providing critical commentary.
The master of the recap is indubitably
Jacob Clifton. When he was recapping
"American Idol," he had a whole slew of
followers who watched the show for the
sole purpose of being able to read and fully
appreciate his recaps. The same is now true
for "Gossip Girl," though at least this show
does have some of its own merits. Clifton's
recaps render anything remotely stupid or
preposterous instantly awesome once you

start seeing the show through his eyes.
Clifton's trademark is his impressive,
acerbic satire of "Gossip Girl," some of the
cleverest I've seen in recent years: brilliant
and laugh-out-loud funny. The satire hit its
zenith last season at about the halfway
point when the show was also at its best. A
classic example is his recap of an exchange
between best friends Chuck and the gor
geous but hopelessly stupid Nate. Chuck
confronts Nate about having stolen his
girlfriend. Chuck's line on the show: "I
guess the Archibald charm wasn't as rusty
as you thought. Unlike the knife in my
back!" Clifton's brilliant satirical addition
was inventing Nate's response: "Ten-four.
Now explain that thing before. Am I the
knife? Why is the knife not rusty? Where
did the knife come from? Is the knife my
charm? Are we friends now?"

Clifton also has an uncanny knack for
seamlessly inserting pop culture references
into his writing to add an extra level to the
analysis and description. When describing a
case of mistaken identity last season one
of the characters, Colin, was mistaken for his
cousin, Ben Clifton wrote, "Some people
know that Colin is dating Serena, some peo
ple don't, but they're not dating and Juliet is
involved with Colin in away that makes
even less sense than before, and Ben is Glory
and/or Colin, and 1... give up." It's easily
missed, but "Buffy" fans will recognize the
reference from another case of mistaken

identities, which was the subject of an entire

hilarious episode, when Spike had to con
stantly remind the others that "Ben is Glory".
And here on "Gossip Girl", there was even a
character named Ben. It's just perfect.

While Clifton is unmatched in his abili
ty to cleverly call out stupidity, he is equally
able to recognize when a show does some
thing right. He always rightly praises the
crackling dialogue and fantastic on-screen
chemistry between unlikely friends (and
now lovers?) Dan and Blair. And his critical
commentary is both incisive and insightful.
In season three, he wrote an extended mini
essay about the complications of Jenny's
decision to lose her virginity, which delved
into the complexities of the characters' expe

riences through the lens of Clifton's own
personal experiences. His fascination with
the show's themes of surveillance and public
identity have led him to write some of the
best commentary on what it is to be Serena,
to have your beauty as your primary charac
teristic.
This season, he started recapping CBS's
"The Good Wife," a show that nobody in
their right mind would call a guilty pleasure,
and he still manages to provide hilarious
satire and very thoughtful analysis of the
show's characters, themes, and direction. To
read Clifton's writing is to engage in a
thought-provoking dialogue about televi
sion. It's proof positive that, as Woody Allen

wrote in "Sleeper," "Everything bad [i.e. tele
vision] is good for you." Even if you're con
vinced that you could never watch "Gossip
Girl" in earnest, if you watch just one
episode of season four supplemented with
Clifton's commentary, you could easily be
convinced to watch it simply for the reward
ing recaps.

riences through the lens of Clifton's own
personal experiences. His fascination with
the show's themes of surveillance and public
identity have led him to write some of the
best commentary on what it is to be Serena,
to have your beauty as your primary charac
teristic.
This season, he started recapping CBS's
"The Good Wife," a show that nobody in
their right mind would call a guilty pleasure,
and he still manages to provide hilarious
satire and very thoughtful analysis of the
show's characters, themes, and direction. To
read Clifton's writing is to engage in a
thought-provoking dialogue about televi
sion. It's proof positive that, as Woody Allen

wrote in "Sleeper," "Everything bad [i.e. tele
vision] is good for you." Even if you're con
vinced that you could never watch "Gossip
Girl" in earnest, if you watch just one
episode of season four supplemented with
Clifton's commentary, you could easily be
convinced to watch it simply for the reward
ing recaps.
