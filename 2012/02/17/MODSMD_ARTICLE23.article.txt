On Monday and Tuesday mornings,
you can reliably find me on
"Television Without Pity," fre
quently clicking refresh in anticipation of
Jacob Clifton's latest "Gossip Girl" or
"The Good Wife" recap. I'm not alone. The
"recap" is a relatively new genre of writing,
popularized by the website "Television
Without Pity," in which the writer gives a
detailed description of a television episode
whilst editorializing, sometimes satirizing
and providing critical commentary.
The master of the recap is indubitably
Jacob Clifton. When he was recapping
"American Idol," he had a whole slew of
followers who watched the show for the
sole purpose of being able to read and fully
appreciate his recaps. The same is now true
for "Gossip Girl," though at least this show
does have some of its own merits. Clifton's
recaps render anything remotely stupid or
preposterous instantly awesome once you

start seeing the show through his eyes.
Clifton's trademark is his impressive,
acerbic satire of "Gossip Girl," some of the
cleverest I've seen in recent years: brilliant
and laugh-out-loud funny. The satire hit its
zenith last season at about the halfway
point when the show was also at its best. A
classic example is his recap of an exchange
between best friends Chuck and the gor
geous but hopelessly stupid Nate. Chuck
confronts Nate about having stolen his
girlfriend. Chuck's line on the show: "I
guess the Archibald charm wasn't as rusty
as you thought. Unlike the knife in my
back!" Clifton's brilliant satirical addition
was inventing Nate's response: "Ten-four.
Now explain that thing before. Am I the
knife? Why is the knife not rusty? Where
did the knife come from? Is the knife my
charm? Are we friends now?"

Clifton also has an uncanny knack for
