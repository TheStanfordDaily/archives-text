## BLACK LOVE BRINGS LIFE TO VALENTINE'S

It's a wonder that students living in Toyon
Hall ever get any work done.
Performance groups of all types looking
for a small venue with good acoustics gravi
tate to the all-sophomore dorm's main
lounge to host their events. The most recent
group to throw their hat in the fray is the
Black Student Union, whose event, "Let's
Stay Together: Black Love 2012," packed
that main lounge to capacity on Tuesday
night.
Though a select few couples were seated
at front-row tables through a pre-event raf
fle, the vast majority of students who attend
ed stood at stand-up cocktail tables littered
with candy. Sparkling cider poured by the
organizers took the place of champagne, and
the ambient lighting created an inviting
mood. After about fifteen minutes, the

event's organizers, Maya
Humes 'l4 and Bana
Hatzey 'l4, took the
stage to start the show.
They introduced
Kevin Avery, a San
Francisco-based stand
up comedian sponsored
by the Stanford
Chapparal who served as
MC of the show. After a
few opening remarks, he
kicked off the first half
of the show, which con
sisted of performances
by Stanford students.
The first of these was a
touching solo perform
ance of a piano ballad

about appreciating
our time with loved
ones, written by the
student in the wake
of her father's death.
This first act set
the tone for the stu
dent performances.
From a duet
between Lady
Renaissance (Mia
Shaw 'l2) and Tyler
Brooks 'l4 reminis
cent of a collabora
tion between Drake
and Nicki Minaj
in sound if not the
atricality to a
lovely poem called
"Adoration" offering
an unabashedly sen
timental portrait of
its theme, the
Stanford students
offered reflections
on the nature of love
and its triumph. At

one point, the audience even broke into
spontaneous snapping and clapping during a
particularly rousing chorus. Rounding out
this half of the show was a short set by a cap
pella group Everyday People, who opted to
forgo their traditional all-vocal setup to fea
ture a piano in addition to the vocal har
monies.
The atmosphere of the first half of the
event was most like a coffeehouse, albeit one
more focused on performance than conver
sation. Another factor that separated the
event from a traditional cafe performance
were Avery's various comedic interludes
between acts. Though he began the night
with few words, by midway through the
Stanford student performances, he was
doing extended bits and riffing off of audi
ence members.
His first routine consisted of a back
and-forth with several of the seated couples
in which he riffed on various aspects of their
relationships. Later, he invited a girl in a
long-distance relationship onstage to tell her
story in a hilarious, extended bit that ended
with a sweet proclamation of long-distance
love. Then, after the student acts were fin-

ished, he launched into a twenty-minute set
with similar themes.
By the time Avery said his thank-yous
and went offstage, the crowd had grown rest
less. They had, after all, come primarily to
see Jeremih. After his DJ and hype man
warmed up the crowd with some common
club songs, the singer came out onstage and
delivered exactly what those fans wanted.
Perhaps the most interesting revelation of
the night, though, was that Jeremih actually
can, in fact, sing.
His set ended, predictably, with
"Birthday Sex" and "Down on Me," though
his DJ remained, along with a sizable crowd,
ready to dance for the rest of their Tuesday
night. In the end, though Jeremih's set
offered an undoubtedly different perspective
on love than the Stanford students' did, the
night as a whole stood as a testament to
black culture, love and the intersection
between the two.
