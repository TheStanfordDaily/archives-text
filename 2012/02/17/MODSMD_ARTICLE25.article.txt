A perfect world would be full of deli-
cious hole-in-the-wall restaurants,
each tucked away on some unas-

suming side street, waiting to be

discovered. In a place as pris-

tine (and often preten-

tious) as Palo Alto, find-

ing such an establishment

often seems impossible many

places that, at first glance, appear to meet
the qualifications are priced in away that

immediately disqualifies them.
Lotus Thai Bistro, a small, under
stated eatery on California Ave., is the

exception to the rule.
Lotus Thai is every
thing you could ever
want in a hole-in-the
wall. Upon entering
the bistro, diners are
greeted from behind
the counter by the
restaurant's chefs, who
are busy concocting
creative and awe
inspiring curries. The
servers are consistently
welcoming and will

gladly accommodate special requests.
As a starter, I am always tempted
to order the fresh rolls. While fresh rolls
often linger on menus as the "healthy"
(read: boring) alternative to their fried
counterparts, Lotus Thai's fresh rolls are as
delicious as they are nutritious. Filled with

an array of fresh and colorful ingredients,
it is as if each bite surprises you with a
new and exciting flavor. The rolls are

packed with tofu, mango, cilantro

and assorted crunchy vegeta-

bles and are topped with

seaweed salad. The sweet

and savory combination is

intriguing and pairs excellently

with the accompanying creamy,

wasabi-topped peanut sauce. My

fellow diner enjoyed the chicken satay
skewers, which were served with a delight
ful sweet coconut peanut sauce. Another

winner is the refreshing "som turn" (green
papaya) salad.
My favorite entree by far is the
pumpkin curry, a beautifully carved
squash filled with an assortment of veg
etables, chicken or meat, according to the
diner's own tastes. The curry sauce, which
pairs well with brown rice, is fiery and
addictive, begging diners to have just one
more bite.
At the end of the meal, a dish of
complimentary ice cream almost always
makes an appearance (and a welcome
appearance at that). In a college town that
often fails to bring students options that
are cheap yet tasty, Lotus Thai Bistro
serves as a reminder that although this
may not be a perfect world, there are still a
few hidden gems waiting to be found.
