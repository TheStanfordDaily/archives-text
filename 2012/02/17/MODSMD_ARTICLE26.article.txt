//T
he Secret World of
I Arrietty," the long-awaited
adaptation of Mary Norton's popular chil
dren's story "The Borrowers" from Studio
Ghibli ("Spirited Away," "Ponyo"), finally
received its North American release. Directed
by newcomer Hiromasa Yonebayashi from a
screenplay by legendary animator Hayao
Miyazaki, the film is a beautifully hand-drawn
and touchingly crafted coming-of-age story.
The 14-year-old Arrietty (Bridgit
Mendler) lives with her parents Pod and
Homily (voiced by real-life couple Will Arnett
and Amy Poehler) beneath the floorboards of
an old country house. As members of the
miniature Borrower race, they subsist on
items gleaned from their larger human coun
terparts. But despite living right under the
humans' noses, the Borrowers manage to
maintain a low profile; that is, until Shawn
(David Henrie), a sickly young man, comes to
rest up at the house before he must receive a
life-threatening operation.
Shawn spots Arrietty one night while she
is out on a borrowing mission, simultaneously
breaking the cardinal rule of her kind and
sparking a mutual curiosity between the two.
Against her parents' will, Arrietty and Shawn

form an unlikely friendship founded upon a
shared sense of uncertainty toward the future;
she because her family may be among the last
remaining Borrowers and he because of his
poor health. When the vindictive housekeeper
Hara (Carol Burnett) finds evidence of the
Borrowers' secret existence, it is up to Shawn
and Arrietty to save her family.
As is always the case with Studio Ghibli
films, attention to detail is paramount. Each
painstakingly hand-illustrated frame is like its
own exquisite painting, creating a refreshing
contrast with the majority of contemporary,
digitized animation. From the Borrowers'
miniscule home to the country house's lus
cious garden, the sheer artistry is consistently
breathtaking.
The dialogue seems to falter at times,
although whether this is merely a function of
the translation into English or an inherent
problem with the script is unclear. And
although the relationships between characters,
particularly Shawn and Arrietty, are fully
fleshed out, certain elements of the story

seemed forced such as Hara's sudden shift
toward villainy. The conclusion verges on
overly sentimental territory, but since this is a
trend within Ghibli films, perhaps some
things are merely lost in translation or across
cultural boundaries.
Despite the fact that Miyazaki wrote the
screenplay, "The Secret World of Arrietty" is


much more in line with the stu
dio's most recent works, contin
uing the trend of straightfor
ward children's movies.
Although the animator's
earlier projects, such as "Totoro"
and "Princess Mononoke," also
tend to be categorized as chil
dren's films, they possessed
darker undertones that lent a
certain complexity, which
allowed for older and younger
viewers to interpret different
meanings. Perhaps this shift is
indicative of Miyazaki's perpet
ual promise to retire, but in the
event that he finally does, we
can rest assured that Studio
Ghibli is in good hands with
new talent like Yonebayashi to
take the helm.
