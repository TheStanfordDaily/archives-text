## UPS and DOWNS 'MISFITS' VS. 'HEROES' 
### â€“ aaron BRODER contact aaron: abroder@stanford. edu 
If you imagined "Heroes," but British and
"edgy," then you'd end up with "Misfits,"
a show that's been made popular in
America thanks to Hulu bringing it across the
pond last year. It's about a group of young
criminals who gain superpowers in a mysteri

ous storm while doing community service, as
well as the surprisingly unfortunate luck they
have after the storm. But the comparisons are
more than skin-deep; looking at "Misfits'"
structure over the years reveals a lot of other
parallels between the two shows.

Let's start from the top: The first season
of "Misfits" was a tightly-constructed, well
written character drama. The superpowers
served the plot, not vice versa; they were tools
to draw out each character's strengths and
insecurities and to drive them forward. At the
beginning of the show, the characters were
bad people; at the end of the first season...
well, let's be honest, they were still bad people,
but they had grown in measurable and believ
able ways.
Then came the second season, and with
it, the downward spiral that ended up defin
ing every season of "Heroes" after the first.
The plots became incoherent; random recur
ring characters appeared from nowhere serv
ing no real purpose; and I don't even want to
talk about the nonsensical Christmas episode.
To its credit, there was an excellent subplot
about the mysterious "Superhoodie" that
delved into the characters of Simon and
Alisha, but even that become its own kind of
problem as the forgone conclusion was
dragged out all the way through season 3.
The new season, which just recently fin
ished airing on Hulu, is somewhere in the
middle of those two. It lacks the strong defi
nition that the first season had, but it's defi
nitely a move in the right direction. I'd even

argue that switching out Nathan, the manic
character who had a tendency to overshadow
everyone else in the first two seasons, for
Rudy (whose really just a Nathan-lite to be
honest) was actually a good idea for the show
since it gave us another character whose
growth we can hope for. But the original mis
fits are dropping like flies, and it's going to get
old fast seeing them replaced by almost iden
tical characters. When a show swaps out their
entire cast, it's a bold move. But phasing them
out one by one makes "Misfits" feel more like
a show that's fizzling out yet another case

where the "Heroes" comparison
holds strong.
Despite its flaws, though,
"Misfits" is a much stronger
show throughout than "Heroes"
ever was. It's more grounded;
even though it has flights of
fan cy (like that Christmas
episode, or the third season
episode where history is altered
so the Nazis won WWII), they
never last as long as "Heroes'"
did. Alisha put it best in the
third finale; the misfits aren't
superheroes. "All we've ever
done is try to defend ourselves
from every [person] who's tried
to kill us. We've done our best,
and if you've got a problem
with that, then fuck you!"
