## GETTING META WITH MASS EFFECT 3 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
It's not often that I mark a
game's release date on my
Google calendar. Besides <
the fact that I tend to remem-

ber them off-hand, they look a little silly next
to all of my oh-so-important classes and
appointments. But with Mass Effect 3,1 can't
help it. There's a little red bubble on March 6
that simply reads "THE BEGINNING OF
THE END."
After playing the demo that came out
earlier this week, I'm still more excited for
Mass Effect 3 than any game this year. But
that anticipation is tempered by an unexpect
ed realization.
Before I get into that, I should back up a
bit. When I say I'm obsessed with Mass Effect
3, I'm not just buying into the hype. Even if I
put on blinders to the game's massive mar
keting campaign, I'd still have to wake myself
up from the occasional daydream where I'm

chatting with my crew in the mess

hall of the SSV Normandy.

That's because Mass Effect

lends a powerful sense of personal ownership

to each player's story and, like no franchise
before it, stretches that saga out from year to
year and game to game. Like millions of
other players, I've seen decisions from back in
2007, when the first game released, come
back to haunt and reward me. I've lost good
friends, made worse enemies and, of course,
had romantic encounters with sexy aliens.
And even if other players have walked a simi
lar path through the first two games, Mass
Effect still makes my story feel like it's all
mine. After all that, I need to finish my story.
Period.
(If you can't relate, imagine that it's early
1983, you're a massive sci-fi nerd and you're
waiting for Return of the Jedi to hit theaters.
Then imagine that you actually had some

control over how the final movie played out.
It's an agonizing wait, isn't it?)
Good thing, then, that Bio Ware &
Electronic Arts threw me a bone last Tuesday.
When the Mass Effect 3 demo went live,
it was understandably something of an event
for me. I immediately fired up my 360,
downloaded the demo and shook out the

tingles running down my spine when I boot
ed it up. Forty-five minutes later, I had finally
gotten my first taste of "the beginning of the
end."

With the demo over, I put the controller
down and gathered my thoughts. My first
reaction wasn't what I would've predicted.
Immediately, I wanted to play the demo
again, but not just because it was an enter
taining appetizer for the full game. I wanted
to see how it looked on my PC, and then on
my PS3.I wondered how the new dodge and
melee mechanics would feel with a keyboard
or a Dual Shock, and I even played through
the whole thing again with voice controls on
Kinect. I checked which platforms I had old,
saved Mass Effect files on, and I refreshed
myself on methods for transferring saves
between platforms. I even called up one of
my best friends to see which platform he'd be
playing the game on after all, I wouldn't
want to miss out on co-op with him. By the
end of the day, I had played the demo five
times.
Why all the fuss? With my eyes glazed
over and an energy bar in hand, I wondered
the same thing. I'd been waiting for this
moment for such a long time, and even
though I couldn't stop playing, I wasn't really
enjoying it.
The answer, I've realized, isn't that the
demo didn't meet my expectations. In fact,
I'm almost blindly assuming the final game
will be excellent. But that belies a more subtle
conflict, one I've never had before and that
illuminates something about the way I play
games.
The game isn't what worries me; it's the
way I experience it. After five years of waiting,
I'm so caught up with the idea of a perfect
ending to this trilogy my trilogy that
I'm deathly afraid of playing through it in
anything less than ideal conditions. It has to
look as good as possible; I have to be playing
with the controller most suited to the game-
