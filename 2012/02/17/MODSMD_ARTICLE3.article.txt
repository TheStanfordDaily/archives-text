# East Palo Alto not yet ready to 'unfriend' Facebook
## 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Though the city of East Palo Alto has ex
pressed concerns about Facebook's proposed ex
pansion in neighboring Menlo Park, city officials
and some residents said they believe the social
networking company's growth will positively af
fect the area. Other officials and members of the
public, however, continue to express sentiments
that the city of Menlo Park has not adequately
heard or addressed their worries.
Menlo Park has drafted an environmental im
pact report for the expansion, but East Palo Alto
representatives said they feel the effects on their
community have not been adequately addressed.
"The draft did not include some mitigation
measures that could help," said East Palo Alto
Vice Mayor Ruben Abrica. "Maybe the city can
not solve the entire problem, but there are some
areas [in which] it can definitely improve the sit
uation."

The East Palo Alto City Council discussed is
sues with the expansion and brainstormed possi
ble solutions with members of the public at a reg
ular council meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 14.

Concerns in EPA
Because the commute route of many of the
more than 7,000 new Facebook
employees would run through
East Palo Alto, most of city's con
cerns regard transportation in
cluding automobile, bicycle and
pedestrian traffic. Health issues
due to toxic emissions are also
under consideration.

According to Abrica, traffic
along University Avenue, the
main thoroughfare for approach
ing the Facebook headquarters
from the south, will be one of the
most impacted areas.
Menlo Park's impact report
places more emphasis on Willow
Road, which runs parallel to Uni
versity Avenue along the border
between East Palo Alto and
Menlo Park.
"Our concern is that the side

streets around University in our
neighborhoods are going to be
impacted," Abrica said. "It's
going to make them more unsafe,
there's going to be more conges
tion and overall it's going to im
pact the health and safety of our
local residents."

Improvements for bicycle
transportation were also not ad
dressed to the extent the East
Palo Alto community would have
liked, Abrica added. Since Face
book is urging its employees to
commute by bike, Abrica said he
feels that this type of transporta
tion needs to be made safer and
smoother.

In favor of collaboration

In January, East Palo Alto con
sidered suing Facebook over the
expansion, but the city has decid
ed not to take this approach.

Abrica said that a lawsuit
would only be an option if Menlo
Park did not address the issues

submitted by East Palo Alto.
"Our concerns are not against
Facebook," Abrica said. "Face
book being there is actually going
to have a large positive impact."
The city submitted its con
cerns to Menlo Park in writing.
Over the next couple of months,
Menlo Park will consider the is
sues before publishing a final im
pact report and deciding to what
extent Facebook should be held
financially responsible for coun
tering negative effects of its ex
pansion.
Facebook officials said the
company is looking forward to
building a good rapport with East
Palo Alto.
"We are going to favor a col
laborative approach," said a
Facebook spokesperson to The
Daily. "Ultimately, we would like
East Palo Alto to see the enor
mous benefits to having a good,
responsible neighbor like Face
book. We are in close communi
cation with officials in East Palo
Alto, and as a result, we believe
we're in the process of building
strong and lasting relationships
there."
City council brainstorms
At Tuesday's city council
meeting, some members of the
public spoke on behalf of Face
book while others expressed con
cerns about the expansion. Po
tential traffic solutions discussed

include the use of shuttles by
local residents.

Housing prices in East Palo
Alto could also be affected by
the expansion, Abrica said. More
Facebook employees, who typi
cally have a higher income level
than the average East Palo Alto
resident, would move into the
area, driving up housing prices,
especially for the renting popu
lation.

East Palo Alto has appointed
a city council subcommittee to
meet with a Menlo Park group by
next week in order to negotiate
and discuss East Palo Alto's
needs.

Councilmembers Carlos
Romero and David Woods both
serve on the subcommittee.

California law

State law requires that during
the environmental review
process, the city issuing the re
port must release a draft as
Menlo Park did in the middle of
December. Members of the pub
lic were free to submit written
concerns until Jan. 30. After that
point, the state mandates that
staff from Menlo Park must re
spond to all the presented con
cerns in writing.
Menlo Park does not have to
agree with East Palo Alto or admit
to any other faults in their report,
but the city is required to address
the issues that have arisen.

East Palo Alto officials hope
that when these concerns are ana
lyzed, Menlo Park representa
tives will note areas where they
feel Facebook should be held fi
nancially responsible for projects
such as the widening of bike
lanes that have been proposed
to counter the effects of the com
pany's expansion.

Other project ideas include a
pedestrian bridge over Highway
101 that would be a safer com
mute option compared to dealing
with increased traffic on Univer
sity Avenue.

Stanford and Facebook
Considering Stanford's prox
imity to both East Palo Alto and
Menlo Park, questions remain
about what effect the expansion
may have on the University. With
the expansion, Facebook has
moved out of its location at the
Stanford Research Park. Further
repercussions for the campus are
unlikely.
"There is no impact to Stan
ford except for the loss of an excit
ing and growing company and
employer, but that impact has al
ready taken place, and we are
busy working to lease out their
former space," said Stanford Re
search Park's Director of Asset
Management Tiffany Griego.
