## 'Higher' lacks flourish

Carey Perloff's
new play,
"Higher", is at
its best when its leading

lady, Elena Constantine (Rene Augesen) is the
focus of attention. Elena is a successful archi
tect dealing realistically with the vicissitudes
of being a successful career woman. She is
middle-aged, childless, unmarried and in a
relationship with another successful but ego
tistical architect, Michael (Andrew Polk). This,
of course, makes Elena insecure, constantly
seeking his approval without being able to
admit it. They find themselves in competition
for the same job to build a memorial,
unaware that they are each other's opposition.
It's gender politics at its best, even though
Michael is such a scumbag and thus a some
what unfair example of a man.
Perloff has also crafted some great scenes,
emotionally, between father and son Michael
and Isaac (Ben Kahre). They have the kind of
tension that can only be built up through a
lifetime of disappointments, when Michael
chose his work and his ego over his family
and Isaac. Isaac isn't meek or weak; he's an
independent, grown man. Kahre beautifully
bares the scars that Isaac carries from this
relationship, which tend to surface through
sarcasm. When Isaac and Elena are together
onstage, both having been hurt by the same
man, their shared damage makes them dyna

mite together.
As Elena, Rene Augesen is a revelation.
Like British actress Kristin Scott Thomas, her
movements and her stillness always seem per
fectly natural, despite the almost complete
lack of a set to ground her. She delivers all of
her lines, even the very bad ones, with the
conviction that makes us believe what she says
unquestioningly. Unfortunately, there are too
many clumsy, unnatural elements to the

script, the stage and the blocking. Augesen is
caught in a play that can never live up to her
own talent.
For a play that relies so much on setting
on contrasting the cut-throat hustle and
bustle of New York life with the meditative
atmosphere of the land where the memorial is
to be built in Israel it's a bold but bad
choice to leave the stage so devoid of setting.
There is almost no furniture no more than
a bed or a table and chairs and no back
drops of any kind: just the cold modern
architecture of the blank set. Perhaps the
attempt was to hint that Israel and America
are not so different, but instead it left the play
floating aimlessly.
The stage also seems too big for the
space, especially when it's empty. When we see
Concetta Tomei as Valerie, the chairwoman of
the competition, gesticulating madly across
the stage, it looks like stilted over-acting. In a
bigger or better-filled space, it might have
seemed authentic, or at least less obtrusive.
"Higher" tries too hard to be clever.
Many lines are intended as epigrams, deliv
ered with the self-assurance that it will receive
a laugh, that you can find yourself accidental
ly slipping into one; you feel gross afterward,
when you realize it wasn't actually funny.
Sometimes the jokes are stale, like poking at
the bleakness of Israel. Some make no sense:
chocking up a character's opacity to being
Canadian. Some just don't work.
Worse, "Higher" fails in its attempt at
philosophical depth: interrogating the pur
pose of memorials. The memorial in question
is for a bus of Jews that was bombed in Israel;
as a Greek, is Augesen inauthentic for tres
passing on their tragedy, memorializing their
pain that is not her own? These questions do
not unfold naturally; they feel as though they
were inserted with little effort, almost as an
afterthought to give the play depth.
Rene Augesen may be an entrancing star,
but she's not enough to save this play from
mediocrity.
