# ADVICE
## TIME FOR A STUDY BREAK ROXY SASS 
### 
Roxy would like to apologize
for her absence last week
with midterms in full
swing, sometimes even Roxy runs
out of stamina (only outside of the
bedroom, of course). She knows
many of you face the same prob
lem by mid-quarter: how to bal
ance work and play. Well, Roxy's
found away to get the best of both
worlds TAs.
Since you're going to be
spending all of your time at office
hours and review sessions in the
next few weeks, Roxy thinks you at
least deserve a little extra credit.
There may be plenty of grade infla
tion at Stanford, but if you're look
ing to get anything else inflated in
the classroom, Roxy advises you
study up.
TAs at Stanford are a diverse
group: undergrads, grad students,
the ones who are so nerdy you
wonder if they've ever been outside
a library or lecture hall, the ones
who are only kind of nerdy...
Undergrad TAs are an easier target,
if only because you're more likely
to run into them at parties (if you
run into your grad TA at a frat
party, Roxy suggests you set your
sights on someone else stat). But,
as you might expect, Roxy prefers
it hard... so she goes after grad
students.
After class or at office hours,
Roxy likes to drop subtle (or not so
subtle) hints. "This assignment is
so long and hard..." or "I could
really use some one-on-one office

hours" or even "I like your curves
... on the midterms, I mean."
Roxy advises that you remem
ber that grad students are a dif
ferent breed (unless they're
coterms, in which case they prob
ably wish they were still under
grads. Offer them the promise of
an undergrad-like experience, and
Roxy promises you'll get an experi
ence of your own). For other grad
students, bear in mind that they
haven't had fun in at least two

years. It's probably for the best that
you don't overwhelm them or
you'll never end up under them. As
with other old people, things will
probably have to move slower than
you're used to.

Roxy wishes you the best on
midterms and your, ahem,
extracurricular pursuits. Good luck
this is one time you won't be
graded on a curve.
