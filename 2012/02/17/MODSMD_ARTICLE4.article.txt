### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
Speaking Thursday afternoon
at the Cemex Auditorium in the
Graduate School of Business
(GSB), four-star General Stanley
McChrystal said that the United
States has struggled to find answers
to global and national issues not
because the country has gotten lazy
or selfish, but because it has contin
ued to apply an outdated model of
leadership instead of adapting to
the changing times.
McChrystal's talk was part of
the lecture series "View from the
Top," a student-run program that
brings prominent figures to cam
pus to share their insights on effec
tive leadership.

U. S. General Stanley McChrystal,
former leader of the Joint Special
Operations Command, spoke
about leadership strategy Thursday
afternoon. The event was held
at the GSB.
"He prefers to be called Stan,
although I recommend you call
him General McChrystal," joked
Joel Peterson, director of the Cen
ter for Leadership Development
and Research at the GSB when he
introduced McChrystal, former
commander of U.S. and interna
tional forces in Afghanistan, to a
capacity-filled audience of more
than 600.

"He is known for creating a rev
olution in warfare that fused intel
ligence and operations," Peterson
added, referring to McChrystal's
counterinsurgency strategy in
Afghanistan and Iraq.
McChrystal's leadership of the
Joint Special Operations Com
mand (JSOC), which oversees the
military's most sensitive forces, is
credited with the December 2003
capture of Saddam Hussein and
the June 2006 locating and killing
of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the for
mer head of A1 Qaeda in Iraq.

President Obama's Dec. 2009
order to send an additional 30,000
troops to Afghanistan was based
on McChrystal's assessment of the
war.

McChrystal's speech focused
on leadership strategy rather than
solely foreign policy, although he
did share anecdotes from his mili
tary career throughout the speech.
Citing New York Times colum
nist and bestselling author Thomas
Friedman's book "The World is
Flat," McChrystal warned of in
creasing competition between na
tions worldwide.
"You have to lead and learn
and adapt or die," McChrystal said.
"At the heart of this is effective
communication."

McChrystal also laid out his key
leadership intangibles, which in

eluded managing time and energy,
working to form relationships and
leading by example.
"When you are a leader, people
watch everything that you do," Mc-
Chrystal said. "You have to oper
ate with a moral compass that peo
ple believe in."

He concluded with the state
ment that "leadership is not a tal
ent or a gift, it's a choice."
After McChrystal's speech, au
dience members posed questions
ranging from the welfare of veter
ans to democracy movements in
the Middle East to McChrystal's
famed daily routine, which consists
of one meal a day and four hours of
sleep.

In response to a question raised
about the nature of the sensitive
relationship between the United
States and Pakistan, McChrystal
responded by highlighting the im
portance and difficulty of building
trust between the two nations.

"There is a deficit of trust [be
tween the United States and Pak
istan] ," McChrystal said, "But I be
lieve Pakistan has strategic inter
ests that I believe the U.S. can help
shape."

McChrystal spoke to The Daily
after the event, saying, "I am in
credibly honored to be here and I
am happy with the great amount of
interest shown today."
Stephen Cobbe 'l5, who at
tended the speech and whose fa
ther served with McChrystal in
Afghanistan, said, "It was so in
credibly inspiring and only reaf
firmed my plans to join the military
in the future."

McChrystal retired from the
military in August 2010, after mak
ing critical comments of the
Obama administration in a Rolling
Stone article. He currently teaches
a leadership seminar at Yale Uni
versity.
