### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
Speaking Thursday afternoon
at the Cemex Auditorium in the
Graduate School of Business
(GSB), four-star General Stanley
McChrystal said that the United
States has struggled to find answers
to global and national issues not
because the country has gotten lazy
or selfish, but because it has contin
ued to apply an outdated model of
leadership instead of adapting to
the changing times.
McChrystal's talk was part of
the lecture series "View from the
Top," a student-run program that
brings prominent figures to cam
pus to share their insights on effec
tive leadership.
