## Khan Academy founder talks future of learning 
### FELIX BOYEAUX 
"Nowadays, there is so much
emphasis on student-to-teacher
ratio," said Salman Khan, founder
of the online educational site The
Khan Academy on Thursday
evening at Cemex Auditorium in
the Graduate School of Business.
"We at The Khan Academy do not
believe in this multiple we be
lieve in optimizing student-to
valuable-time-with-teacher ratio,
or even more importantly, stu
dent-to-valuable-time-with-
other-human-beings ratio. A one
size-fits-all lecture is not the way
to go about education."
Invited to Stanford as part of the
Expert Speaker Series by the Mas
tery in Communication Initiative,
Khan spoke about how his website,
with more than 3,000 lectures and
almost four million unique visitors
a month, has grown to become a
world-renowned leader in the field
of online education.
Khan started his talk with a his
tory of The Khan Academy.
"I was a hedge-fund analyst in
Boston when my younger cousin,
Nadia, came to visit, and I noticed
that this brilliant child, who could
solve brain-teasers way harder
than what would be expected by a
twelve-year old, still had gaps in
the most fundamental level
math," Khan said.
According to Khan, the prob
lem with the current educational
system is that the time spent
teaching one subject is fixed, and
only the student's level of mastery
is variable. What his website is try
ing to achieve is to make the
amount of time spent learning
variable in order for a student to
attain a certain level of mastery.

"We cannot build a house on
an 80 percent sound foundation,
and then blame the contractor of
the fourth floor when the building
collapses," Khan said. "It would be
like expecting a child who can
barely break or turn left on a bicy
cle to become a master unicyclist."

After the revelation he had
while tutoring his cousin, a friend
pitched Khan the idea of upload
ing some of the videos he had
filmed of their tutoring sessions to
You Tube.

"I had to go home and deal
with the idea that I did not come
up with that idea myself," Khan
said, adding "this is something
very hard for an MBA."
Using You Tube as a medium to
convey knowledge was something
that had not crossed his mind.

"You Tube is for cats playing
the piano!" Khan joked.

The videos took off, and the
children he had previously tutored
told him they preferred seeing him
on You Tube than in person.

"They can work at their own
pace, repeat, rewind, fast-forward,"
Khan explained. "There is no dis
traction, and more importantly,
there is no shame. They do not feel
like they are wasting my time."
After quitting his job and get
ting several generous donations
from, among others, the Gates
Foundation and Google, The
Khan Academy is now used in
more than 700 different schools
