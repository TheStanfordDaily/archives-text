## University expands support for victims of assault 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Halfway through its first academic year,
the Office of Sexual Assault and Relationship
Abuse (SARA) Education & Response has
established an initiative to get more male stu
dents involved in issues of sexual assault and
relationship abuse, collaborating with other
parts of the University to set up workshops
and training sessions. In the future, the office
plans to establish campus protocols for deal

ing with sexual assault, according to Angela
Exson, assistant dean of SARA.
The University founded SARA last June
to assist student victims of sexual assault and
relationship abuse with subsequent personal
and academic difficulties.

"The Office has been engaged in many
facets of prevention and response from con
tributing to communication to incoming stu
dents, to delivering class lectures on violence
against women, to assisting with the revisions
to campus policies on sexual assault," wrote

Exson in an email to The Daily.
In recent months, two assaults and four
peeping Tom incidents have been reported to
campus police.

If peeping Tom incidents involve sexual
misconduct, the SARA Office can address
those cases, according to Exson. The protocol
is to respond in a timely manner and help en
sure the confidentiality of the victim. Appro
priate notifications are then made to alert
