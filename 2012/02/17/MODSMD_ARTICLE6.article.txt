## University expands support for victims of assault 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Halfway through its first academic year,
the Office of Sexual Assault and Relationship
Abuse (SARA) Education & Response has
established an initiative to get more male stu
dents involved in issues of sexual assault and
relationship abuse, collaborating with other
parts of the University to set up workshops
and training sessions. In the future, the office
plans to establish campus protocols for deal

ing with sexual assault, according to Angela
Exson, assistant dean of SARA.
The University founded SARA last June
to assist student victims of sexual assault and
relationship abuse with subsequent personal
and academic difficulties.

"The Office has been engaged in many
facets of prevention and response from con
tributing to communication to incoming stu
dents, to delivering class lectures on violence
against women, to assisting with the revisions
to campus policies on sexual assault," wrote

Exson in an email to The Daily.
In recent months, two assaults and four
peeping Tom incidents have been reported to
campus police.

If peeping Tom incidents involve sexual
misconduct, the SARA Office can address
those cases, according to Exson. The protocol
is to respond in a timely manner and help en
sure the confidentiality of the victim. Appro
priate notifications are then made to alert
those who may be impacted, and
further action is conducted on a
case-by-case basis.
Awareness through education
Exson said SARA has collabo
rated with students, faculty, staff
and other campus partners to as
sess the needs of the community
and how the Office can best be of
service.
"We have been conducting
outreach, education and profes
sional trainings to increase aware
ness of sexual and relationship vi
olence," Exson said. "I have been
working with students to create
spaces for survivors to engage and

support each other in addition to
accessing campus and community
resources."
SARA has collaborated with
Residential Education, the Grad
uate Life Office, iThrive at Stan
ford and the Office of Judicial Af
fairs, and has participated in their
respective training efforts.

"We have worked with the Of
fice of Alcohol Policy & Educa
tion (OAPE) on their 'Say Some
thing' pilot program for by
stander intervention, and in train
ing the Sober Monitors for cam
pus events," Exson added in the
email.
SARA has also established a
Male Engagement Initiative, which
asks men to assist with efforts to
prevent and raise awareness of sex
ual and relationship violence.

The first event for this initia

tive will feature Kevin Powell, an
acclaimed author, activist and
media figure in the movement to
end gender-based violence, Pow
ell will speak at the Black Com
munity Services Center in the
Henry and Monique Brandon
Family Community Room on
Feb. 21.

SARA hopes to address the
problem of sexual assault and re
lationship abuse by increasing
awareness through education and
spaces for dialogue.
"The best way to empower
ourselves and each other is
through factual knowledge of the
underlying causes of all forms of
sexual and relationship violence
and in holding those who commit
these violations accountable,"
Exson said in the email.
Nicole Baran 'OO is the founder

and director of the Center for Re
lationship Abuse Awareness, an
other resource for students. Ac
cording to its website, the organi
zation works, "to educate and
train communities and institu
tions to respond effectively to
women who are experiencing re
lationship abuse."
"Our goal was to institutional
ize a comprehensive response to
these issues on campus," Baran
said. "Since that has been
achieved, we are expanding to the
broader community and other
universities ... Our office is now
located off-campus."
"We will continue to collabo
rate with the SARA office and
provide training and education
for the campus as needed," Baran
said. "Angela [Exson] will hire the
Center to help with training and
education initiatives."
Future plans
Exson wrote in her email about
SARA's future plans, which include
working toward implementing pro
tocols to centralize the organiza
tion's response structure and con
ducting outreach to students.
In an interview with The Daily
on Sept. 30, Exson spoke about
establishing protocol during the
first year.
"There is policy for dealing
with sexual assault policy but no
protocol, and with relationship
abuse, we have protocols but we
don't have policy in place," Exson
said in the interview.
"Sexual assault protocols and
guidelines for relationship abuse
have been drafted and we will

begin the process of consulting
with staff to assess and imple
ment them during the spring
quarter," Exson said in this
month's email.

One of Exson's other priorities
is to increase SARA's involve
ment with the graduate student
community, "as they often have
unique needs and concerns that
we also want to support," she said.

SARA will also work with stu
dent groups to participate in their
planned initiatives and to organ
ize programming events, includ
ing "a presentation and training
on the issue of consent and how
we all can be sure that it is effec
tively obtained to prevent sexual
assault," according to Exson.
"Since April is Sexual Assault
Awareness Month, we will be
planning and collaborating on a
number of events to promote ed
ucation and sensitivity around
this issue," Exson added.

"The Office is faced with the
challenge of dealing with issues
that are often controversial and
contested," Exson said. "The
greatest resource that we have
and will continually need is the
support of the campus and the ex
pertise and assistance from stu
dents, faculty and staff to accom
plish our mission and goals."
"It is important to make a
commitment to intervene and let
someone know when you see or
hear something that may subject
yourself or someone else to vul
nerability or danger," she added.

SARA hopes to address the
problem of sexual assault and re
lationship abuse by increasing
awareness through education and
spaces for dialogue.
"The best way to empower
ourselves and each other is
through factual knowledge of the
underlying causes of all forms of
sexual and relationship violence
and in holding those who commit
these violations accountable,"
Exson said in the email.
Nicole Baran 'OO is the founder

and director of the Center for Re
lationship Abuse Awareness, an
other resource for students. Ac
cording to its website, the organi
zation works, "to educate and
train communities and institu
tions to respond effectively to
women who are experiencing re
lationship abuse."
"Our goal was to institutional
ize a comprehensive response to
these issues on campus," Baran
said. "Since that has been
achieved, we are expanding to the
broader community and other
universities ... Our office is now
located off-campus."
"We will continue to collabo
rate with the SARA office and
provide training and education
for the campus as needed," Baran
said. "Angela [Exson] will hire the
Center to help with training and
education initiatives."
Future plans
Exson wrote in her email about
SARA's future plans, which include
working toward implementing pro
tocols to centralize the organiza
tion's response structure and con
ducting outreach to students.
In an interview with The Daily
on Sept. 30, Exson spoke about
establishing protocol during the
first year.
"There is policy for dealing
with sexual assault policy but no
protocol, and with relationship
abuse, we have protocols but we
don't have policy in place," Exson
said in the interview.
"Sexual assault protocols and
guidelines for relationship abuse
have been drafted and we will

begin the process of consulting
with staff to assess and imple
ment them during the spring
quarter," Exson said in this
month's email.

One of Exson's other priorities
is to increase SARA's involve
ment with the graduate student
community, "as they often have
unique needs and concerns that
we also want to support," she said.

SARA will also work with stu
dent groups to participate in their
planned initiatives and to organ
ize programming events, includ
ing "a presentation and training
on the issue of consent and how
we all can be sure that it is effec
tively obtained to prevent sexual
assault," according to Exson.
"Since April is Sexual Assault
Awareness Month, we will be
planning and collaborating on a
number of events to promote ed
ucation and sensitivity around
this issue," Exson added.

"The Office is faced with the
challenge of dealing with issues
that are often controversial and
contested," Exson said. "The
greatest resource that we have
and will continually need is the
support of the campus and the ex
pertise and assistance from stu
dents, faculty and staff to accom
plish our mission and goals."
"It is important to make a
commitment to intervene and let
someone know when you see or
hear something that may subject
yourself or someone else to vul
nerability or danger," she added.

Halfway through its first academic year,
the Office of Sexual Assault and Relationship
Abuse (SARA) Education & Response has
established an initiative to get more male stu
dents involved in issues of sexual assault and
relationship abuse, collaborating with other
parts of the University to set up workshops
and training sessions. In the future, the office
plans to establish campus protocols for deal

ing with sexual assault, according to Angela
Exson, assistant dean of SARA.
The University founded SARA last June
to assist student victims of sexual assault and
relationship abuse with subsequent personal
and academic difficulties.

"The Office has been engaged in many
facets of prevention and response from con
tributing to communication to incoming stu
dents, to delivering class lectures on violence
against women, to assisting with the revisions
to campus policies on sexual assault," wrote

Exson in an email to The Daily.
In recent months, two assaults and four
peeping Tom incidents have been reported to
campus police.

If peeping Tom incidents involve sexual
misconduct, the SARA Office can address
those cases, according to Exson. The protocol
is to respond in a timely manner and help en
sure the confidentiality of the victim. Appro
priate notifications are then made to alert
those who may be impacted, and
further action is conducted on a
case-by-case basis.
Awareness through education
Exson said SARA has collabo
rated with students, faculty, staff
and other campus partners to as
sess the needs of the community
and how the Office can best be of
service.
"We have been conducting
outreach, education and profes
sional trainings to increase aware
ness of sexual and relationship vi
olence," Exson said. "I have been
working with students to create
spaces for survivors to engage and

support each other in addition to
accessing campus and community
resources."
SARA has collaborated with
Residential Education, the Grad
uate Life Office, iThrive at Stan
ford and the Office of Judicial Af
fairs, and has participated in their
respective training efforts.

"We have worked with the Of
fice of Alcohol Policy & Educa
tion (OAPE) on their 'Say Some
thing' pilot program for by
stander intervention, and in train
ing the Sober Monitors for cam
pus events," Exson added in the
email.
SARA has also established a
Male Engagement Initiative, which
asks men to assist with efforts to
prevent and raise awareness of sex
ual and relationship violence.

The first event for this initia

tive will feature Kevin Powell, an
acclaimed author, activist and
media figure in the movement to
end gender-based violence, Pow
ell will speak at the Black Com
