## Journalism experts assess Bay Citizen deal 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
Despite minor concerns as The Bay Citizen
and the Center for Investigative Reporting
(CIR) explore the possibility of a merger, edi
torial staff at The Bay Citizen said they are op
timistic about how the merger might affect the
Peninsula's media ecosystem. Stanford and
Berkeley-based journalism experts agreed, ar
guing that the larger size of llie Bay Citizen-
CIR organization will lead to better news cov
erage.

According to Jeanne Carstensen, executive
managing editor of The Bay Citizen, the merg
er is not yet finalized. The boards of The Bay
Citizen and CIR both have 30 days, ending on
March 8, to review the proposal and decide
whether or not to move forward.

"The staff is excited about being a part of a
larger newsroom and anxious as any staff
would be about the merger," Carstensen
said.

The Bay Citizen is a nonprofit, nonpartisan
organization, which focuses on local news sto
ries that may not get picked up by larger media
outlets such as the San Francisco Chronicle.
CIR, which calls itself the "nation's oldest non
profit investigative reporting organization,"
has a much broader focus.

"The concern when two organizations be
come one is that the mission of one organiza
tion can get swallowed up by the other," said
Ann Grimes, director of the Stanford Gradu
ate Program in Journalism.

Carstensen agreed, stating there are differ
ences between the two organizations' mission
statements that still need to be reconciled. She
said that the rules for mergers in the state

allow California Attorney General Kamala
Harris to step in if she feels that the two
group's mission statements are too different.
Another major issue Carstensen said needs
to be resolved is the fact that The Bay Citizen
staff is part of a local newsroom union while
the CIR staff is nonunionized.

It is also unclear how the possible merger
would affect The Bay Citizen's agreement with
The New York Times. Currently, The Times
runs pieces by the Bay Citizen twice a week in
its San Francisco edition. According to
Carstensen, The Bay Citizen does not yet
know whether the merger would affect this re
lationship.

Stanford and Berkeley-based journalism
experts said the merger represents a transfor
mation in the way Bay Area news agencies de
liver information.

While newspapers across the Bay Area
have been making cuts in their budgets and
consequently losing staff and news coverage,
small online local news organizations have
sprung up to account for the vacuum in cover
age of smaller stories, they said.
"We've seen a lot of the start up of a lot of
news sites based on covering solely local com
munities or certain types of areas," said
Frances Dinkelspiel 'Bl, a producer and
founder of Berkeleyside, an independently
owned local news website that focuses its cov
erage on the city of Berkeley.
"That is why [hyperlocal media] were cre
ated, when there was such a cutback in local
coverage in newspapers," said Grimes, who is
the faculty advisor to the Peninsula Press, an
online news organization run by the Universi
ty journalism program that features stories
from San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.

Both Berkelyside and the Peninsula Press
are similar to The Bay Citizen in that that they
concentrate their coverage on local news.
"I think the question is: If the merger oc
curs, will that new organization continue to re
port on local news?" Dinkelspiel said.
Both Dinkelspiel and Grimes said they are
not looking to expand their respective news
organizations because they have established a
niche market.
"We are local," Grimes said.
"We have a certain tone and character on
our site because of where it is, and it would be
hard to replicate that somewhere else,"
Dinkelspiel added.
However, while the small size of these inde
pendent news organizations allows them to
cover extremely specific subject areas, it also
makes it difficult for them to pay journalists
well.
"It's become a lot more difficult to make a
living as a freelancer because these online
businesses do not pay very well," Dinkelspiel
added.
According to both Grimes and Dinkelspiel,
the larger organization created by a merger
between The Bay Citizen and CIR could lead
to fuller coverage of local Bay Area issues.
Carstensen agreed, saying that the merger
between the two organizations would result in
a net gain for The Bay Citizen, CIR and the
people of the Bay Area.

"I hope it will make for a more robust Bay
Citizen and that The Bay Citizen will be able to
deliver even more enterprise and accountabil
ity journalism to our readers," Carstensen said.

Peninsula's media ecosystem. Stanford and
Berkeley-based journalism experts agreed, ar
guing that the larger size of llie Bay Citizen-
CIR organization will lead to better news cov
erage.

According to Jeanne Carstensen, executive
managing editor of The Bay Citizen, the merg
er is not yet finalized. The boards of The Bay
Citizen and CIR both have 30 days, ending on
March 8, to review the proposal and decide
whether or not to move forward.

"The staff is excited about being a part of a
larger newsroom and anxious as any staff
would be about the merger," Carstensen
said.

The Bay Citizen is a nonprofit, nonpartisan
organization, which focuses on local news sto
ries that may not get picked up by larger media
outlets such as the San Francisco Chronicle.
CIR, which calls itself the "nation's oldest non
profit investigative reporting organization,"
has a much broader focus.

"The concern when two organizations be
come one is that the mission of one organiza
tion can get swallowed up by the other," said
Ann Grimes, director of the Stanford Gradu
ate Program in Journalism.

Carstensen agreed, stating there are differ
ences between the two organizations' mission
statements that still need to be reconciled. She
said that the rules for mergers in the state

allow California Attorney General Kamala
Harris to step in if she feels that the two
group's mission statements are too different.
Another major issue Carstensen said needs
to be resolved is the fact that The Bay Citizen
staff is part of a local newsroom union while
the CIR staff is nonunionized.

It is also unclear how the possible merger
would affect The Bay Citizen's agreement with
The New York Times. Currently, The Times
runs pieces by the Bay Citizen twice a week in
its San Francisco edition. According to
Carstensen, The Bay Citizen does not yet
know whether the merger would affect this re
lationship.

Stanford and Berkeley-based journalism
experts said the merger represents a transfor
mation in the way Bay Area news agencies de
liver information.

While newspapers across the Bay Area
have been making cuts in their budgets and
consequently losing staff and news coverage,
small online local news organizations have
sprung up to account for the vacuum in cover
age of smaller stories, they said.
"We've seen a lot of the start up of a lot of
news sites based on covering solely local com
munities or certain types of areas," said
Frances Dinkelspiel 'Bl, a producer and
founder of Berkeleyside, an independently
owned local news website that focuses its cov
erage on the city of Berkeley.
"That is why [hyperlocal media] were cre
ated, when there was such a cutback in local
coverage in newspapers," said Grimes, who is
the faculty advisor to the Peninsula Press, an
online news organization run by the Universi
ty journalism program that features stories
from San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.

Both Berkelyside and the Peninsula Press
are similar to The Bay Citizen in that that they
concentrate their coverage on local news.
"I think the question is: If the merger oc
curs, will that new organization continue to re
port on local news?" Dinkelspiel said.
Both Dinkelspiel and Grimes said they are
not looking to expand their respective news
organizations because they have established a
niche market.
"We are local," Grimes said.
"We have a certain tone and character on
our site because of where it is, and it would be
hard to replicate that somewhere else,"
Dinkelspiel added.
However, while the small size of these inde
pendent news organizations allows them to
cover extremely specific subject areas, it also
makes it difficult for them to pay journalists
well.
"It's become a lot more difficult to make a
living as a freelancer because these online
businesses do not pay very well," Dinkelspiel
added.
According to both Grimes and Dinkelspiel,
the larger organization created by a merger
between The Bay Citizen and CIR could lead
to fuller coverage of local Bay Area issues.
Carstensen agreed, saying that the merger
between the two organizations would result in
a net gain for The Bay Citizen, CIR and the
people of the Bay Area.

"I hope it will make for a more robust Bay
Citizen and that The Bay Citizen will be able to
deliver even more enterprise and accountabil
ity journalism to our readers," Carstensen said.
