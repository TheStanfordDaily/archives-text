## East to surpass West, says historian 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
The world at the end of the 21st
century will differ more from
today than how present day is cur
rently compared to the world of
cavemen, said lan Morris, an ar
chaeologist and historian in the
Department of Classics, Thursday
evening during a lecture in the
Sloan Mathematics Corner.

The lecture, entitled, "Why the
West Rules For Now: The Silk
Road, the Atlantic Economy and
the Pacific Century," was based
off his 2010 award-winning book,
"Why the West Rules for Now:
The Patterns of History, and What
They Reveal About the Future."
Morris said that geography is
more important than culture in
explaining patterns of the major
power shifts and economic transi
tions throughout history, and ar
gued that these patterns can pre
dict the future direction of the
world.

He also challenged the idea of
Western and European superiori
ty, which he said is a false percep
tion.

Arguing that Europe's rise was

due to geographical factors, Mor
ris said, "Europe had the benefit
of the Atlantic slave trade, which
incentivized a community of
thinkers to ask questions that
caused Europe to flourish intel
lectually."
"Europe had access to the
Americas before the East Asians
did simply because it was easier to
get there based on distance, not
because they were smarter or
more wicked," Morris added.
Morris also drew a parallel be
tween how the Atlantic trade
helped to elevate the United
States to its current position of
prominence in the global econo
my, and how the Pacific trade is in
dicating the same trend with
China.
Using a social development
index he developed which
takes into account factors such as
energy captured per person, or
ganization, spread of information
and war making Morris
mapped out the history of two civ
ilizations since the last ice age that
scored the highest on the index:
East Asia and the West.
He pointed out that the shapes
of the graphs were similar, which

he said debunks the idea of West
ern superiority. Furthermore,
Morris pointed out that from 550
CE to 1750 CE on the graph, the
East was actually ahead of the
West and produced crucial inven
tions such as ships that could sail
the world.
Morris also highlighted the
role the Silk Road and the peo
ples of the steppe region that lies
between Western Europe and
East Asia had in connecting the
two regions and shaping their his
tory in away that is not often ac
knowledged.
Morris concluded with a graph
based on his social development
index, which projects a future in
which the East will overtake the
West in 2103.
"Western domination will
evaporate," he said. "This process
is driven by geography and cannot
be reversed."
"The changes that will happen
in the 21st century will be on a
scale that will dwarf anything that
has ever happened to human his
tory," Morris said.
