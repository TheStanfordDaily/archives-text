## Preserving Stanford's funkiness 
### 
On such a well-manicured
campus, Chi Theta Chi can
seem a misplaced relic, a re
minder of some bygone time in the
school's past. Yet the continuing
story of XOX, and that of its
bowtie-sporting cousin Sigma Chi,
symbolizes both the past and fu
ture of Stanford University.
In 1960, housing for Stanford
students was far different than the
system we know today. Many stu
dents lived off campus. With soror
ities banished in 1944, on-campus
females lived either in dorms or
all-female homes. For men, cam
pus housing consisted largely of
privately owned fraternity homes
(24 in total) that were run by alum
ni boards, or "house corporations."
Two of those fraternities were
Sigma Chi and Theta Chi.
The 19605, however, reshaped
Stanford's student culture, and
thus student housing preferences.
The fraternity system was nearly
halved by 1970, with low recruit
ment and debt forcing some chap
ters to close, with others disaffiliat
ing to protest the backwards racial
policies of the national organiza
tions (chief among these was
Sigma Chi, whose fight against the
national fraternity sparked signifi
cant controversy).
The void left by the Greek sys
tem's decline was quickly filled
with a diverse array of alternative
housing. Beginning in the late
19605, co-ops and themed houses
began to pop up. Sigma Nu, after
disaffiliating to protest the nation
al's barring of Asian and black stu
dents, became a co-ed fraternity ti
tled Beta Chi. Androgyny, the spir
itual fore-runner of the co-op
Terra, existed at 620 Mayfield Ave,
now home to Haus Mitteleuropa.
Ultimately, Theta Chi would trans
form into the self-owned co-op we

now know as Chi Theta Chi.
Since the reshuffling of the
19605, building styles, administra
tive preferences and bureaucratic
turf wars have collided with the
Farm's eccentric history to give us
the school's somewhat incongru
ous, but entirely diverse residential
culture.
With 95 percent of undergradu
ates living on campus, a large dif
ference between Stanford and her
peer institutions is a housing sys
tem that offers students the choice
of Greeks, apartments or co-ops
named "the Enchanted Broccoli
Forest."
Indeed, look no farther than the
exhaustive and comprehensive
Study on Undergraduate Educa
tion at Stanford ("SUES") for val
idation of this claim. The final re
port "confirmed our belief in the
absolute centrality of residential
experience to a Stanford educa
tion ... living in residences pro
motes integrative learning, offer
ing students a wealth of opportuni
ties to test and refine the knowl
edge, skills, and values they are ac
quiring in their classes."
The controversy surrounding
Chi Theta Chi should concern co
ops, Greek partisans and any
staunch supporter (student, alum
or family member) of a rich stu
dent culture. While liability and
risk management issues must be
addressed, bureaucratic wrangling
should not trump support for what
is truly one of the school's great as
sets.
Standing seemingly at polar op
posites, Chi Theta Chi and Sigma
Chi, the last two privately owned
houses, embody the richness and
variance of what the Farm has to
offer. Though aggrieved middle
managers in Residential & Dining
Enterprises might disagree, Stan

ford needs the rogue bastion of pi
rate libertarianism that is XOX,
just as it needs a proud, self-owned
Sigma Chi, and the full range of
strange and wonderful housing op
tions in between. To steal a line
from a good friend, "be deeply
funky" â€” Keep XOX self-owned,
and defend the quirkiness that
makes Stanford great.
