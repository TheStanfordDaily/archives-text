## Virtual Classroom 
### STEPHANIE WANG 
As professors experiment with on
line courses, students who aren't
physically on campus can now
work toward their undergraduate
degrees in front of a computer. In
fact, some of these courses are free of charge
and open to the public.
Last quarter, professors offered three of
Stanford's most popular computer science
(CS) courses Machine Learning, Introduc
tion to Artificial Intelligence and Introduction
to Databases to the public at no cost. An
drew Ng, Sebastian Thrun and Daphne
Koller Ph.D. '94, all computer science profes
sors, taught the three courses, respectively.
More than 100,000 students participated in
the machinery and intelligence courses.
"I was excited to have the opportunity to
reach a far larger number of students," Ng
said. "At Stanford, I teach a machinery class
of about 400 students. One way to put that is
that in order to reach out to 100,000 students,
I would have to teach at Stanford for 250
years."
The idea of online CS courses first started
in January 2010, when Koller decided to
transfer her lectures online to use class time
for interactive activities. Students reacted
positively to the change in electronic course
evaluations.
"The lecture component has been shifted
over to this online medium with these interac
tive, automated systems, and in class we do ac
tivities that make better use of the fact that I
am there with these students in the same
room at the same time," Koller said.
The transition to online courses has the
potential to benefit students who are interest
ed in studying abroad or participating in proj
ects that take them off campus.
Paul Kim, assistant dean of information
technology at the School of Education,
stressed that online courses allow students to
participate in extracurricular activities off
campus while taking courses with Stanford
faculty.
"You could be working for a refugee camp
in northern Uganda while communicating
with the faculty at all times," Kim said.
In addition, Kim said that the online

courses enable the University to make more
of an impact in terms of the sheer quantity of
people it can educate. According to Kim,
open course content from other elite univer
sities is already educating millions of people
today.
Kim predicted that any online university
affiliated with the University in the future will
continue to educate only a small percentage
of all Stanford students, and the University's
physical campus will maintain its importance,
' 'When you bring in people who can brain
storm with our finest faculty members, their
collective knowledge augmentation and gen
eration process can lead to much more time
ly and meaningful global impact," Kim said.
"That's why a physical campus is still impor
tant."
In terms of implementing an online uni
versity, there are virtually no technical chal
lenges. According to Kim, the main problem
is that people are unwilling to change existing
perceptions of what a classroom should look
like.
"There is a resistance to adopt and en
hance the new mode of learning in tradition
al education settings," Kim said. "Many tradi
tional educators do not consider learning on
line valuable and do not invest time to learn
new methodologies. If it does not look, feel or
sound like a classroom, it may not be consid
ered a classroom for them."
Learning Management System, Course
Management System, video capturing and
streaming tools such as ClassX and Open
Classroom are some of technological tools
available for professors teaching online
courses. However, these tools do not exclude
the possibility that students will cheat. En
forcement of the honor code still remains a
challenge.

"Quiz questions were randomized so that
every time you took the quiz you got a differ
ent set of questions," Ng said of his course this
past fall. "Randomization makes it more dif
ficult to cheat."
In the future, it might be possible for stu
dents to fulfill pre-med requirements while
conducting research in the Amazon or attend
lecture while on a flight to a football game.
With the ability to take classes through the In
ternet, it will be easier for students to engage
in educational and recreational experiences
outside the campus limits.
The momentum behind increased online
learning is evident in a number of recent de
velopments, including the recent revamp of
Stanford on iTunes U and the recent findings
of the Study on Under-

graduate Education at Stanford (SUES).
"We must be entrepreneurial in our ap
proach to teaching and technology, just as we
are in regard to research and technology," the
SUES report stated, recommending the cre
ation of clear protocol on teaching material
and a Learning Technologies Lab to assist fac
ulty and students, in addition to dialogue on
the best practices of online course delivery
and course management and the integration
of third-party services.
"Technology will certainly enhance the
learning experience and also expand new
possibilities for a variety of different types
of new learning," Kim said. "Technologies
of all types and shapes will be used to opti
mize and maximize learning for students of
all regions and ages anytime, anywhere
around the world."

people it can educate. According to Kim,
open course content from other elite univer
sities is already educating millions of people
today.
Kim predicted that any online university
affiliated with the University in the future will
continue to educate only a small percentage
of all Stanford students, and the University's
physical campus will maintain its importance,
' 'When you bring in people who can brain
storm with our finest faculty members, their
collective knowledge augmentation and gen
eration process can lead to much more time
ly and meaningful global impact," Kim said.
"That's why a physical campus is still impor
tant."
In terms of implementing an online uni
versity, there are virtually no technical chal
lenges. According to Kim, the main problem
is that people are unwilling to change existing
perceptions of what a classroom should look
like.
"There is a resistance to adopt and en
hance the new mode of learning in tradition
al education settings," Kim said. "Many tradi
tional educators do not consider learning on
line valuable and do not invest time to learn
new methodologies. If it does not look, feel or
sound like a classroom, it may not be consid
ered a classroom for them."
Learning Management System, Course
Management System, video capturing and
streaming tools such as ClassX and Open
Classroom are some of technological tools
available for professors teaching online
courses. However, these tools do not exclude
the possibility that students will cheat. En
forcement of the honor code still remains a
challenge.

"Quiz questions were randomized so that
every time you took the quiz you got a differ
ent set of questions," Ng said of his course this
past fall. "Randomization makes it more dif
ficult to cheat."
In the future, it might be possible for stu
dents to fulfill pre-med requirements while
conducting research in the Amazon or attend
lecture while on a flight to a football game.
With the ability to take classes through the In
ternet, it will be easier for students to engage
in educational and recreational experiences
outside the campus limits.
The momentum behind increased online
learning is evident in a number of recent de
velopments, including the recent revamp of
Stanford on iTunes U and the recent findings
of the Study on Under-

graduate Education at Stanford (SUES).
"We must be entrepreneurial in our ap
proach to teaching and technology, just as we
are in regard to research and technology," the
SUES report stated, recommending the cre
ation of clear protocol on teaching material
and a Learning Technologies Lab to assist fac
ulty and students, in addition to dialogue on
the best practices of online course delivery
and course management and the integration
of third-party services.
"Technology will certainly enhance the
learning experience and also expand new
possibilities for a variety of different types
of new learning," Kim said. "Technologies
of all types and shapes will be used to opti
mize and maximize learning for students of
all regions and ages anytime, anywhere
around the world."

As professors experiment with on
line courses, students who aren't
physically on campus can now
work toward their undergraduate
degrees in front of a computer. In
fact, some of these courses are free of charge
and open to the public.
Last quarter, professors offered three of
Stanford's most popular computer science
(CS) courses Machine Learning, Introduc
tion to Artificial Intelligence and Introduction
to Databases to the public at no cost. An
drew Ng, Sebastian Thrun and Daphne
Koller Ph.D. '94, all computer science profes
sors, taught the three courses, respectively.
More than 100,000 students participated in
the machinery and intelligence courses.
"I was excited to have the opportunity to
reach a far larger number of students," Ng
said. "At Stanford, I teach a machinery class
of about 400 students. One way to put that is
that in order to reach out to 100,000 students,
I would have to teach at Stanford for 250
years."
The idea of online CS courses first started
in January 2010, when Koller decided to
transfer her lectures online to use class time
for interactive activities. Students reacted
positively to the change in electronic course
evaluations.
"The lecture component has been shifted
over to this online medium with these interac
tive, automated systems, and in class we do ac
tivities that make better use of the fact that I
am there with these students in the same
room at the same time," Koller said.
The transition to online courses has the
potential to benefit students who are interest
ed in studying abroad or participating in proj
ects that take them off campus.
Paul Kim, assistant dean of information
technology at the School of Education,
stressed that online courses allow students to
participate in extracurricular activities off
campus while taking courses with Stanford
faculty.
"You could be working for a refugee camp
in northern Uganda while communicating
with the faculty at all times," Kim said.
In addition, Kim said that the online

courses enable the University to make more
of an impact in terms of the sheer quantity of
people it can educate. According to Kim,
