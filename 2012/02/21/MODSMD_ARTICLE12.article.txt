# Re-evaluating writing: 10 years later
## 
### CARA REICHARD 
Most Stanford students are fa
miliar with the Hume Writ
ing Center (HWC). As a
hotspot for freshmen strug
gling with Introduction to the
Humanities (IHUM) assignments as well as
graduate students plugging away at their dis
sertations, the Center seems to be going
strong as it celebrates the tenth anniversary
of its opening.
However, many students would be sur
prised to discover that the Center is only 10
years old. Andrea Lunsford, former HWC
director, joined the Stanford faculty in 2000
with instruction to "think about undergradu
ate writing." She was surprised, but pleased,
when she discovered that Stanford did not al
ready have a writing center.
"If there wasn't one already in existence,
we could make it exactly how we wanted,"
Lunsford said.
According to Lunsford, upon the HWC's
founding in 2001, the Hume Writing Center
originally the Stanford Writing Center
was the most cutting-edge writing center of
its kind.
"It was designed to address any issue of
writing from the very first thinking about
writing to the last dotted 'i' for everybody on
campus," Lunsford said. "What made it
unique at that time was its focus on celebrat
ing writing."
This outlook on writing meant that the
Center was tasked with being more than just

an academic resource it also works to pro
mote writing outside of academia.
The Center hosts events during Parents'
and Admit Weekends to highlight student
writing, co-sponsors art of writing workshops
with the Creative Writing Program and hosts
regular performances by spoken word
artists.
"We're committed to celebrating writing
in all its forms, from traditional writing to
new media writing and doing all we can to
help Stanford's culture of writing thrive,"
said Sohui Lee, associate director of the Cen
ter.
The HWC includes consultants of many
different kinds. Undergraduate students,
graduate students and Program in Writing
and Rhetoric (PWR) lecturers are all avail
able for consultations to help students with
their work.
"We are unique in that we offer students
opportunities to work with several kinds of
tutors with writing expertise and training,"
Lee said.
Patricia Ho 'l4 has had experience with
various types of tutors.
"I used to do drop-in appointments and I
worked with mostly peer tutors," Ho said.
"Now I sign up for appointments, so it tends
to be more graduate students and PWR in
structors. It's nice to get the different per
spectives."
"People can come in and sign in and I'll
work with anyone who shows up to go over
essays or applications or anything they've
written," said Elena Ayala-Hurtado 'l4, a

drop-in peer tutor.
The Center is not just an undergraduate
resource. It is available to anyone at Stanford
looking for help or consultation relating to
his or her writing. Ayala-Hurtado said she
works mostly with undergraduates, including
freshmen in IHUM and PWR, while Donna
Hunter, an HWC writing consultant, ex
plained that the Center sees a lot of graduate
students as a result of outreach efforts.
"We've done a lot of summer stuff work
ing with graduate students," Hunter said.
"It's called Dissertation Boot Camp ...
we've gotten a lot more graduate students
for that reason."
Regardless of who uses it, the Center is a
resource provided for free to all students. Ac
cording to its website, the Center offers
around 6,000 consultations each year.
"It's a completely free service available to
everyone on campus at almost any time,"
Lunsford said. "Students have support for
writing right at their fingertips."
Hunter explained that she likes to think
of it as "talk therapy."The consultants are not
just there to fix a student's essay, but to help
them talk through their own ideas.
"Oftentimes by articulating what you're
thinking about, you get a lot clearer," Hunter
said.
Ho echoed this idea, based on her experi
ence working with tutors.
"It's helpful just to talk out loud and think
about what I'm trying to make into an argu
ment," Ho said.
According to Lee, the Center's popularity

rises each year as the number of tutoring ses
sions increases. Many students return to the
Center regularly.
"We believe that our writing programs
are important to the University and to stu
dents because they increase students'
chances for academic success in their ma
jors," Lee said. "Good writing is good think
ing."

Regardless of who uses it, the Center is a
resource provided for free to all students. Ac
cording to its website, the Center offers
around 6,000 consultations each year.
"It's a completely free service available to
everyone on campus at almost any time,"
Lunsford said. "Students have support for
writing right at their fingertips."
Hunter explained that she likes to think
of it as "talk therapy."The consultants are not
just there to fix a student's essay, but to help
them talk through their own ideas.
"Oftentimes by articulating what you're
thinking about, you get a lot clearer," Hunter
said.
Ho echoed this idea, based on her experi
ence working with tutors.
"It's helpful just to talk out loud and think
about what I'm trying to make into an argu
ment," Ho said.
According to Lee, the Center's popularity

rises each year as the number of tutoring ses
sions increases. Many students return to the
Center regularly.
"We believe that our writing programs
are important to the University and to stu
dents because they increase students'
chances for academic success in their ma
jors," Lee said. "Good writing is good think
ing."

Students visit the Hume Writing Center to
study, read and write. Established in 2001,
the Hume Writing Center offers regular tutoring sessions through both drop-in tutors
and satellite appointments across campus.
Most Stanford students are fa
miliar with the Hume Writ
ing Center (HWC). As a
hotspot for freshmen strug
gling with Introduction to the
Humanities (IHUM) assignments as well as
graduate students plugging away at their dis
sertations, the Center seems to be going
strong as it celebrates the tenth anniversary
of its opening.
However, many students would be sur
prised to discover that the Center is only 10
years old. Andrea Lunsford, former HWC
director, joined the Stanford faculty in 2000
with instruction to "think about undergradu
ate writing." She was surprised, but pleased,
when she discovered that Stanford did not al
ready have a writing center.
"If there wasn't one already in existence,
we could make it exactly how we wanted,"
Lunsford said.
According to Lunsford, upon the HWC's
founding in 2001, the Hume Writing Center
originally the Stanford Writing Center
was the most cutting-edge writing center of
its kind.
"It was designed to address any issue of
writing from the very first thinking about
writing to the last dotted 'i' for everybody on
campus," Lunsford said. "What made it
unique at that time was its focus on celebrat
ing writing."
This outlook on writing meant that the
Center was tasked with being more than just

an academic resource it also works to pro
mote writing outside of academia.
The Center hosts events during Parents'
and Admit Weekends to highlight student
writing, co-sponsors art of writing workshops
with the Creative Writing Program and hosts
regular performances by spoken word
artists.
"We're committed to celebrating writing
in all its forms, from traditional writing to
new media writing and doing all we can to
help Stanford's culture of writing thrive,"
said Sohui Lee, associate director of the Cen
ter.
The HWC includes consultants of many
different kinds. Undergraduate students,
graduate students and Program in Writing
and Rhetoric (PWR) lecturers are all avail
able for consultations to help students with
their work.
"We are unique in that we offer students
opportunities to work with several kinds of
tutors with writing expertise and training,"
Lee said.
Patricia Ho 'l4 has had experience with
various types of tutors.
"I used to do drop-in appointments and I
worked with mostly peer tutors," Ho said.
"Now I sign up for appointments, so it tends
to be more graduate students and PWR in
structors. It's nice to get the different per
spectives."
"People can come in and sign in and I'll
work with anyone who shows up to go over
essays or applications or anything they've
written," said Elena Ayala-Hurtado 'l4, a

drop-in peer tutor.
The Center is not just an undergraduate
resource. It is available to anyone at Stanford
looking for help or consultation relating to
his or her writing. Ayala-Hurtado said she
works mostly with undergraduates, including
freshmen in IHUM and PWR, while Donna
Hunter, an HWC writing consultant, ex
plained that the Center sees a lot of graduate
students as a result of outreach efforts.
"We've done a lot of summer stuff work
ing with graduate students," Hunter said.
"It's called Dissertation Boot Camp ...
we've gotten a lot more graduate students
for that reason."
