This weekend the Stanford baseball team
showed exactly why it was ranked No. 2 in the
nation coming into the season, sweeping No.
10 Vanderbilt at Sunken Diamond in a three
game series to begin its 2012 campaign.
The Cardinal (3-0) jumped out to big leads
against the Commodores (0-3) all weekend
long, looking like the Pac-12 favorite and na
tional title contender Stanford is expected to
be.The Cardinal has seven position players re
turning and two stellar starters on the mound.
"We know we have a very talented group,
we're just trying to stay very levelheaded
about it and just do what we can do," said Sat
urday starter and redshirt junior Brett
Mooneyham. "If we play to our potential,
Omaha is not a goal that's unattainable, for
sure,"
Mooneyham and junior ace Mark Appel
combined for 13 strikeouts and just four
earned runs to give the Cardinal the series win
by Saturday. A year after Vanderbilt squeaked
out a pair of wins on the second weekend of
the season to take the three-game set between
these two teams in Nashville, Stanford domi
nated this time around with an 8-3 victory on
Friday and a 9-5 win the next afternoon, and
later capped the weekend with an 18-5 bludg
eoning on Sunday.
Sophomore first baseman Brian Ragira tal
lied seven hits on the weekend to lead the Car
dinal, and junior third baseman Stephen Pis
cotty came up with eight RBIs. Uncharacteris
tic defensive mistakes by the visiting Com
modores, who committed 11 errors on the
weekend, were just more nails in Vanderbilt's
coffin.
Meanwhile, catcher Eric Smith was a pleas
ant surprise for Stanford behind the dish,
opening his junior season with a pair of two-
RBI performances. However, Smith said his
most exciting moments of the weekend came
behind the plate, as the converted infielder
started all three games after winning an ex

tended battle for the position this fall and
spring.
"It was truly an honor to be able to catch
opening day and catch a guy like Mark Appel,"
Smith said after catching a game for the first
time in three years. "I didn't know what to ex
pect."
At least from Appel (1-0) there were no
surprises, as the projected top MLB draft pick
shut down Vanderbilt through seven innings
on Friday night. Only five runners reached
base off the righthander, one of them on an
error by junior shortstop Kenny Diekroeger,
and the Commodores' only run came off a
fifth-inning sacrifice fly.
In the batter's box, the Cardinal lived up to
its reputation as one of the strongest lineups in
the country. Piscotty smashed a solo shot over
the left-field fence to open the scoring in the
first inning with a homerun, and junior desig
nated hitter Christian Griffiths added another
in the bottom of the second. Stanford tacked
on three more in the third to extend its lead.
With the score 5-1 in the fifth, Smith hit a
line drive into right field that sneaked by both
outfielders and rolled slowly to the wall. When
the Commodores misplayed the relay, third
base coach Dean Stotz waved him home.
" [Head coach Mark] Marquess has the phi
losophy that once you make contact you're
100 percent out of the box," Smith said. "You
see that ball in the gap, you're thinking triple,
double. And I saw Coach Stotz holding me up,
and then all of a sudden waving me home."
Smith barely beat the throw to the plate for
the Cardinal's third home run of the night and
the program's first inside-the-park shot in
nearly four years.
Vanderbilt did mount a rally in the ninth in
ning to close it to 8-3, but the effort was too lit
tle, too late.
The Stanford offense got ahead quickly
again on Saturday, but this time the Com
modores were doomed by their own fielding
mistakes. A Vanderbilt error allowed the Car
dinal to get on the board in the first inning,
and after the Commodores knotted it up in

the third inning, two more errors in the bot
tom of the third helped keep the Cardinal on
the base paths for four more runs.
Junior left fielder Tyler Gaffney added to
the lead in the fourth with a double, extending
his hit streak from last year to 24 games and
making the score 6-1. The Cardinal tacked on
three more in the bottom of the fifth thanks to
two walks, a Smith RBI double and a sac fly
from junior centerfielder Jake Stewart.
On the mound, Mooneyham (1-0) strug
gled with his fastball and walked four batters,
but struck out eight more, showing signs of
the dominance that gave him the team lead in
strike outs in 2010.
"It feels good just to be out there in a game

that isn't against yourself," he said, after sit
ting out all of last season with an injury.
"There were a couple of mistakes I'd like to
take back, but overall, it was very good."
One of those mistakes was a two-run
homer in the sixth by center fielder Connor
Harrell that drew the Commodores within six.
Another two-run shot by Harrell in the top of
the eighth off senior righthander Brian Busick
drew the game even closer, and Marquess
brought in highly touted freshman hurler
David Schmidt for the final six outs. The
righthander shined in his first collegiate outing,
getting out of the eighth with three quick
