# OWENS' EFFORT NOT ENOUGH

### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's basket
ball team controlled the first 35
minutes of its matchup against
Oregon, but in the last five the
Cardinal couldn't stop forward
E.J. Singler, as the junior scored
10 straight points to help the
Ducks squeak out a 68-64 win.

Stanford (18-9,8-7 Pac-12) en
tered the game knowing it needed
a win to have any chance of earn
ing a first-round bye in the Pac-12
conference tournament. From
the start, this scenario seemed
likely as the Cardinal scored the
first points of the game, taking a
lead it would not relinquish for
the next 38 minutes. The Ducks
(19-8,10-5) stuck with the Cardi
nal throughout, however, and fi
nally seized their opportunity
when Singler went off.
The Cardinal were struck by
an early blow when senior for
ward Andrew Zimmermann,
playing his second-to-last game in
Maples Pavilion, went down with
an injury six minutes into the first
half. The senior scored four of
Stanford's first six points and
brought a level of toughness that
was sorely missed in his absence.

After Zimmermann went
down, Stanford stayed on top of
the Ducks due to the play of an
other senior, forward Josh
Owens. The captain was unstop
pable in the paint, scoring 20
points. The Cardinal's other big
men also played well, as 6-foot-9
sophomore forwards Dwight
Powell and John Gage scored 11
and eight, respectively.
Although they were efficient
on offense, the Cardinal forwards
had issues on the defensive end, as
for just the fourth time this season
they were out-rebounded.
"They had 16 second-chance
points, which means that they got
some offensive rebounds that we
should have had as defensive re
bounds," Owens said.
Stanford still held the lead at
the five-minute mark when a
layup by Singler cut the Cardinal
lead to two. Singler, the younger
brother of former Duke Ail-
American Kyle Singler, would
prove to be unstoppable. He hit a
three-pointer, scored a layup,
then drained yet another three to
give Oregon its first lead of the
game with just 2:47 left to go.
Stanford still had a chance to
win the game, as no one scored for
the next two minutes. The Cardi
nal held the ball with 22 seconds
on the clock, down 66-64 and hop
ing for a last-second miracle. The
ball was inbounded to freshman
