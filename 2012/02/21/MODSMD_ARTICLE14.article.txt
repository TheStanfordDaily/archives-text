# OWENS' EFFORT NOT ENOUGH

### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's basket
ball team controlled the first 35
minutes of its matchup against
Oregon, but in the last five the
Cardinal couldn't stop forward
E.J. Singler, as the junior scored
10 straight points to help the
Ducks squeak out a 68-64 win.

Stanford (18-9,8-7 Pac-12) en
tered the game knowing it needed
a win to have any chance of earn
ing a first-round bye in the Pac-12
conference tournament. From
the start, this scenario seemed
likely as the Cardinal scored the
first points of the game, taking a
lead it would not relinquish for
the next 38 minutes. The Ducks
(19-8,10-5) stuck with the Cardi
nal throughout, however, and fi
nally seized their opportunity
when Singler went off.
The Cardinal were struck by
an early blow when senior for
ward Andrew Zimmermann,
playing his second-to-last game in
Maples Pavilion, went down with
an injury six minutes into the first
half. The senior scored four of
Stanford's first six points and
brought a level of toughness that
was sorely missed in his absence.

After Zimmermann went
down, Stanford stayed on top of
the Ducks due to the play of an
other senior, forward Josh
Owens. The captain was unstop
pable in the paint, scoring 20
points. The Cardinal's other big
men also played well, as 6-foot-9
sophomore forwards Dwight
Powell and John Gage scored 11
and eight, respectively.
Although they were efficient
on offense, the Cardinal forwards
had issues on the defensive end, as
for just the fourth time this season
they were out-rebounded.
"They had 16 second-chance
points, which means that they got
some offensive rebounds that we
should have had as defensive re
bounds," Owens said.
Stanford still held the lead at
the five-minute mark when a
layup by Singler cut the Cardinal
lead to two. Singler, the younger
brother of former Duke Ail-
American Kyle Singler, would
prove to be unstoppable. He hit a
three-pointer, scored a layup,
then drained yet another three to
give Oregon its first lead of the
game with just 2:47 left to go.
Stanford still had a chance to
win the game, as no one scored for
the next two minutes. The Cardi
nal held the ball with 22 seconds
on the clock, down 66-64 and hop
ing for a last-second miracle. The
ball was inbounded to freshman

Stanford senior Josh Owens (above) was dominant on Sunday, scoring 20 points on 8-of-13 shooting in Stanford's heartbreaking 68-64 loss to Oregon. The Card now sits in seventh in the Pac-12
guard Chasson Randle, who had
been silent for most of the night.
Randle's go-ahead shot missed, but
was rebounded by Powell. Randle
got one more chance to tie the
game but missed a tough layup with
nine seconds left.
Two free throws by Oregon's
leading scorer, Devoe Joseph,
sealed the game as the Ducks es
caped with the victory. The win
moved them to fourth in the Pac-12
and into position for a first-round
bye. Stanford, however, fell to sev
enth and now faces tough odds as
the season comes to a close.
Along with poor rebounding,
the Cardinal suffered from poor
free-throw shooting. Stanford went
11-22 from the line, a figure that
definitely had an impact on the
game.
"It was a four-point game, and
shooting 50 percent from the foul
line when you shoot 22 free throws,
that alone [could have been the dif
ference]," Owens said.
Stanford's quiet offensive per
formance was partially due a rare
off-game offensively from its back
court duo of Randle and sopho
more Aaron Bright. The two com
bined for just eleven points, just a
few days after torching Oregon
State for 44.
This week, the Cardinal is back
on the road for its first trip to new

Pac-12 additions Colorado and
Utah. Stanford defeated both the
Utes and the Buffaloes in its
matchups earlier this season at
Maples. Stanford has just three
games left in the regular season and
sits four games back from confer
ence leaders California and Wash
ington. With a regular-season title
out of the question, the Cardinal
have to make a serious run in the
Pac-12 tournament to have any
hope at earning an NCAA tourna
ment bid.
Thursday night's matchup with
Colorado looks to be challenging.
The Buffaloes are 10-4 in confer
ence play and currently sit in third.
Saturday night's game against
Utah looks to be easier, given the
Utes are 2-12 and rank above only
USC in the Pac-12. The Cardinal
will then travel back to Maples
Pavilion to close the regular season
against rival California on Sunday,
March 4.
