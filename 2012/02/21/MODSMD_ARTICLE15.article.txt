# Zero to hero may not be so crazy

Even a loss last Friday
couldn't halt the Linsani
ty. Against the New Or
leans Hornets, point
guard sensation Jeremy
Lin recorded 26 points, and his team,
the New York Knicks, bounced back
on Sunday to defeat the Dallas Mav
ericks and keep the revival going.
This Cinderella story seems to have
had such an impact on the sports
world that the news has even
reached across the Atlantic, and even
I feel I should join the party and write
about it.
Last week, my esteemed fellow
sportswriter and, as ex-managing
editor of sports here at The Daily,
technically my former boss Miles
Bennett-Smith beat me to it, com-

posing a ballad in sorrow at Stan
ford's failure to recruit and nurture a
talented player who grew up on its
doorstep.
This seems to be a recurrent
theme. Throughout Lin's struggling
career, he was repeatedly passed
over by the good and the great of
basketball. Even Bill Holden, the
former assistant Harvard basketball
coach who recruited Lin, didn't im
mediately go for him. New York did
n't consider him as much more than
a backup buried deep on the bench
until head coach Mike D'Antoni,
frustrated at how badly his team was
playing, took a chance.

From knowing and caring rela
tively little about him just a few
weeks ago, the basketball world is
now struggling to understand both
how good Lin may be and how he
seems to have slipped through the
recruitment net. His statistics in the
nine games since being given that op
portunity on Feb. 2 seem pretty phe
nomenal: an average of 25.0 points
and 9.2 assists though with 5.9
turnovers per game.
Glancing at the NBA's career
scoring and assists leaders gives
some idea of how impressive this
start is. In his career, Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar set a record with 38,387 total
points, averaging 24.6 points per
game (PPG). Karl Malone, second
on the career scoring list, recorded
25.0 PPG, and Michael Jordan and
Wilt Chamberlain both averaged
30.1 on a nightly basis. With regards
to assists, John Stockton dished out
a career total of 15,806, with an av
erage of 10.5 per game, followed by
Jason Kidd's 9.1 and Mark Jack
son's 8.0.
Extrapolating from nine games
to careers measured in the thou
sands is, of course, a little bit of a
leap. But even still, there aren't
many players who have ever been
able to boast a streak of this nature.
It seems hard to imagine that Lin
will ever be considered a backup,
fringe player again.
But how did this happen? How
was the existence of a potential
NBA legend completely missed by
almost all of the hundreds of D-I
basketball programs, the 32 profes
sional teams and the hoards of
scouts and sports journalists?
Maybe it wasn't.
I'm not stupid enough to try and
claim that Lin doesn't have a clear
talent for the game, but I'm not so
sure that there isn't something
unique about his current situation
that has triggered the exact nature
of his explosion onto the scene. At
least in the first few games, Lin was
an unknown quantity to opposing
players, and the hype that now sur
rounds him probably hasn't helped
dispel the mystique. Perhaps foes
haven't quite managed to under

stand how to counter his playing
style.
Having come so close to the ob
scurity of a career that faltered even
before it got started, Lin also must
step out onto court with a unique at
titude. It is hard to imagine that any
one in professional basketball is
having quite as much fun right now;
a seemingly failed ambition has be
come a dream come true. In that
very first real chance, too, he must
have known that this was it, his very
last chance to make it.
Perhaps this gives Lin an edge
that the more traditional journey of
a fledgling star doesn't yield. Maybe
he wasn't such a complete player
back then, but that the tough expe
rience he went through filled in any
holes; maybe if he had been picked
up by Stanford or even a traditional
basketball school he wouldn't been
the sensation he now is. It might be
that the scouts were, back then, right
to pass over him, or that the recruit
ing and coaching systems we have
in place fail to both pick up and de
velop unique talents like Lin's.
Whatever, hindsight is both a
wonderful and a futile thing. The
Golden State Warriors and Hous
ton Rockets might be ruing the de
cision not to keep hold of him, but
we need to forget the might-have
beens. More than anything, this is an
inspiring and enthralling story.Time
to just sit back and enjoy the ride.

Last week, my esteemed fellow
sportswriter and, as ex-managing
editor of sports here at The Daily,
technically my former boss Miles
Bennett-Smith beat me to it, com-

posing a ballad in sorrow at Stan
ford's failure to recruit and nurture a
talented player who grew up on its
doorstep.
This seems to be a recurrent
theme. Throughout Lin's struggling
career, he was repeatedly passed
over by the good and the great of
basketball. Even Bill Holden, the
former assistant Harvard basketball
coach who recruited Lin, didn't im
mediately go for him. New York did
n't consider him as much more than
a backup buried deep on the bench
until head coach Mike D'Antoni,
frustrated at how badly his team was
playing, took a chance.

From knowing and caring rela
tively little about him just a few
weeks ago, the basketball world is
now struggling to understand both
how good Lin may be and how he
seems to have slipped through the
recruitment net. His statistics in the
nine games since being given that op
portunity on Feb. 2 seem pretty phe
nomenal: an average of 25.0 points
and 9.2 assists though with 5.9
turnovers per game.
Glancing at the NBA's career
scoring and assists leaders gives
some idea of how impressive this
start is. In his career, Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar set a record with 38,387 total
points, averaging 24.6 points per
game (PPG). Karl Malone, second
on the career scoring list, recorded
25.0 PPG, and Michael Jordan and
Wilt Chamberlain both averaged
30.1 on a nightly basis. With regards
to assists, John Stockton dished out
a career total of 15,806, with an av
erage of 10.5 per game, followed by
Jason Kidd's 9.1 and Mark Jack
son's 8.0.
Extrapolating from nine games
to careers measured in the thou
sands is, of course, a little bit of a
leap. But even still, there aren't
many players who have ever been
able to boast a streak of this nature.
It seems hard to imagine that Lin
will ever be considered a backup,
fringe player again.
But how did this happen? How
was the existence of a potential
NBA legend completely missed by
almost all of the hundreds of D-I
basketball programs, the 32 profes
sional teams and the hoards of
scouts and sports journalists?
Maybe it wasn't.
I'm not stupid enough to try and
claim that Lin doesn't have a clear
talent for the game, but I'm not so
sure that there isn't something
unique about his current situation
that has triggered the exact nature
of his explosion onto the scene. At
least in the first few games, Lin was
an unknown quantity to opposing
players, and the hype that now sur
rounds him probably hasn't helped
dispel the mystique. Perhaps foes
haven't quite managed to under

stand how to counter his playing
style.
Having come so close to the ob
scurity of a career that faltered even
before it got started, Lin also must
step out onto court with a unique at
titude. It is hard to imagine that any
one in professional basketball is
having quite as much fun right now;
a seemingly failed ambition has be
come a dream come true. In that
very first real chance, too, he must
have known that this was it, his very
last chance to make it.
Perhaps this gives Lin an edge
that the more traditional journey of
a fledgling star doesn't yield. Maybe
he wasn't such a complete player
back then, but that the tough expe
rience he went through filled in any
holes; maybe if he had been picked
up by Stanford or even a traditional
basketball school he wouldn't been
the sensation he now is. It might be
that the scouts were, back then, right
to pass over him, or that the recruit
ing and coaching systems we have
in place fail to both pick up and de
velop unique talents like Lin's.
Whatever, hindsight is both a
wonderful and a futile thing. The
Golden State Warriors and Hous
ton Rockets might be ruing the de
cision not to keep hold of him, but
we need to forget the might-have
beens. More than anything, this is an
inspiring and enthralling story.Time
to just sit back and enjoy the ride.

Even a loss last Friday
couldn't halt the Linsani
ty. Against the New Or
leans Hornets, point
guard sensation Jeremy
Lin recorded 26 points, and his team,
the New York Knicks, bounced back
on Sunday to defeat the Dallas Mav
ericks and keep the revival going.
This Cinderella story seems to have
had such an impact on the sports
world that the news has even
reached across the Atlantic, and even
I feel I should join the party and write
about it.
