Even a loss last Friday
couldn't halt the Linsani
ty. Against the New Or
leans Hornets, point
guard sensation Jeremy
Lin recorded 26 points, and his team,
the New York Knicks, bounced back
on Sunday to defeat the Dallas Mav
ericks and keep the revival going.
This Cinderella story seems to have
had such an impact on the sports
world that the news has even
reached across the Atlantic, and even
I feel I should join the party and write
about it.
Last week, my esteemed fellow
sportswriter and, as ex-managing
editor of sports here at The Daily,
technically my former boss Miles
Bennett-Smith beat me to it, com-

posing a ballad in sorrow at Stan
ford's failure to recruit and nurture a
talented player who grew up on its
doorstep.
This seems to be a recurrent
theme. Throughout Lin's struggling
career, he was repeatedly passed
over by the good and the great of
basketball. Even Bill Holden, the
former assistant Harvard basketball
coach who recruited Lin, didn't im
mediately go for him. New York did
n't consider him as much more than
a backup buried deep on the bench
until head coach Mike D'Antoni,
frustrated at how badly his team was
playing, took a chance.

From knowing and caring rela
tively little about him just a few
weeks ago, the basketball world is
now struggling to understand both
how good Lin may be and how he
seems to have slipped through the
recruitment net. His statistics in the
nine games since being given that op
portunity on Feb. 2 seem pretty phe
nomenal: an average of 25.0 points
and 9.2 assists though with 5.9
turnovers per game.
Glancing at the NBA's career
scoring and assists leaders gives
some idea of how impressive this
start is. In his career, Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar set a record with 38,387 total
points, averaging 24.6 points per
