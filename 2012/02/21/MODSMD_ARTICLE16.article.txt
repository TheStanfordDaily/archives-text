# 12 STRAIGHT FOR CARD
## 
### DEAN MCARDLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The conference changed names,
but the champion stayed the same,
as the Stanford women's basketball
team clinched the inaugural Pac-12
championship with an 81-46 rout of
Oregon on Saturday.

The No. 2 Cardinal (24-1, 15-0
Pac-12) has now won 12 straight
conference championships dating
back to 2001.
Junior forward Joslyn Tinkle
dominated in the post, leading Stan
ford with 19 points. The Ogwumike
sisters joined her in double figures,
as sophomore forward Chiney and
senior forward Nnemkadi posted 14
and 12 points, respectively. Saturday
marked just the fifth time this season
that someone not named Ogwu
mike lead the Cardinal in scoring
Tinkle has been that someone four
of five times.
"It's special for all of us to share

this," Tinkle said. "Especially being
the first Pac-12 season ... We have
had great success in the Pac-10 the
past few years, but we just don't let
up. That's the goal for us each time
we come out here, regardless of
who we're playing."
The conference title is head
coach Tara VanDerveer's 21st in
her 27 seasons on the Farm. The win
was also Stanford's 21st in a row,
and the Cardinal remains undefeat
ed in conference play.
Nia Jackson led Oregon (14-13,
6-9) with nine points. Amanda
Johnson, who is averaging 19.4
points per game for the Ducks, was
held to just eight on Saturday.
The Cardinal took advantage of
Oregon mistakes in the contest,
scoring 19 points off of turnovers.
Stanford capitalized on their trips
to the free throw line as well, sink
ing 19 of 20 attempts.
Stanford came ready to play and
jumped ahead soon after tipoff. A
layup by Nneka Ogwumike, fol
lowed by consecutive three-point
ers from sophomore guard Toni
Kokenis and Tinkle put Stanford up
8-0 just 72 seconds into the game.
Meanwhile, the Ducks struggled

from the field, missing their first
seven attempts and shooting just 25
percent (16 for 64) on the night.
Later in the half, Stanford fresh
man guard Amber Orrange swiped
the ball from Oregon's Lexi Peter
son and converted the fast-break
basket, sparking a 12-2 Stanford
run. The Cardinal continued to
build on its lead throughout the first
half and went into the locker room
up 42-20.
In the second half the Ducks
consistently fouled Stanford shoot
ers, and the Cardinal made them
pay from the free throw line. The
squad was a perfect 14 for 14 in the
second half and controlled the pace
of the game,
Midway through the second
half, Chiney ignited a 17-4 run with
a strong move down low that led to
a layup. She then capped the run
with another layup to push Stan
ford's advantage to 28 points.
VanDerveer used her bench ex
tensively and effectively in Satur
day's game. Freshmen Taylor
Greenfield and Bonnie Samuelson
both rained in two shots from be
hind the arc, and Samuelson totaled
eight points on the night.
The Cardinal has been clicking
on all cylinders of late, winning its
past six contests by an average of al
most 27 points. Over that stretch,
Stanford has been stout defensively
as well, holding all of their oppo
nents under 60 points.
"I think we're coming together
and jelling at the right time," Van-
Derveer said. "We're playing well
defensively, and we're ironing out
some bugs offensively and getting
some different people to step up."
Stanford returns home this
week to take on Pac-12 foes Col
orado and Utah.The Cardinal takes
on the Buffaloes on Thursday at 7
p.m., then grapples with the Utes on
Saturday at 2 p.m.

Joslyn Tinkle (No. 44) scored 19 points against Oregon on Saturday, as
the Stanford women's basketball team clinched its 12th consecutive conference title. The No. 2 Cardinal is undefeated in Pac-12 play this season.
The conference changed names,
but the champion stayed the same,
as the Stanford women's basketball
team clinched the inaugural Pac-12
championship with an 81-46 rout of
Oregon on Saturday.

The No. 2 Cardinal (24-1, 15-0
Pac-12) has now won 12 straight
conference championships dating
back to 2001.
Junior forward Joslyn Tinkle
dominated in the post, leading Stan
ford with 19 points. The Ogwumike
sisters joined her in double figures,
as sophomore forward Chiney and
senior forward Nnemkadi posted 14
and 12 points, respectively. Saturday
marked just the fifth time this season
that someone not named Ogwu
mike lead the Cardinal in scoring
Tinkle has been that someone four
of five times.
"It's special for all of us to share

this," Tinkle said. "Especially being
the first Pac-12 season ... We have
had great success in the Pac-10 the
past few years, but we just don't let
up. That's the goal for us each time
we come out here, regardless of
who we're playing."
The conference title is head
coach Tara VanDerveer's 21st in
her 27 seasons on the Farm. The win
was also Stanford's 21st in a row,
and the Cardinal remains undefeat
ed in conference play.
Nia Jackson led Oregon (14-13,
6-9) with nine points. Amanda
Johnson, who is averaging 19.4
points per game for the Ducks, was
held to just eight on Saturday.
The Cardinal took advantage of
Oregon mistakes in the contest,
scoring 19 points off of turnovers.
Stanford capitalized on their trips
to the free throw line as well, sink
ing 19 of 20 attempts.
Stanford came ready to play and
jumped ahead soon after tipoff. A
layup by Nneka Ogwumike, fol
lowed by consecutive three-point
ers from sophomore guard Toni
Kokenis and Tinkle put Stanford up
8-0 just 72 seconds into the game.
Meanwhile, the Ducks struggled

from the field, missing their first
seven attempts and shooting just 25
percent (16 for 64) on the night.
Later in the half, Stanford fresh
man guard Amber Orrange swiped
the ball from Oregon's Lexi Peter
son and converted the fast-break
basket, sparking a 12-2 Stanford
run. The Cardinal continued to
build on its lead throughout the first
half and went into the locker room
up 42-20.
In the second half the Ducks
consistently fouled Stanford shoot
ers, and the Cardinal made them
pay from the free throw line. The
squad was a perfect 14 for 14 in the
second half and controlled the pace
of the game,
Midway through the second
half, Chiney ignited a 17-4 run with
a strong move down low that led to
a layup. She then capped the run
with another layup to push Stan
ford's advantage to 28 points.
VanDerveer used her bench ex
tensively and effectively in Satur
day's game. Freshmen Taylor
Greenfield and Bonnie Samuelson
both rained in two shots from be
hind the arc, and Samuelson totaled
eight points on the night.
The Cardinal has been clicking
on all cylinders of late, winning its
past six contests by an average of al
most 27 points. Over that stretch,
Stanford has been stout defensively
as well, holding all of their oppo
nents under 60 points.
"I think we're coming together
and jelling at the right time," Van-
Derveer said. "We're playing well
defensively, and we're ironing out
some bugs offensively and getting
some different people to step up."
Stanford returns home this
week to take on Pac-12 foes Col
orado and Utah.The Cardinal takes
on the Buffaloes on Thursday at 7
p.m., then grapples with the Utes on
Saturday at 2 p.m.
