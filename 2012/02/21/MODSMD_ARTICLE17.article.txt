# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Wins vault Stanford to No. 1 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
As the saying goes, it's not about
the destination but the journey
along the way. For the Stanford
men's volleyball team, that destina
tion is hopefully a national champi
onship. Yet even if the cards don't
fall that way, the journey has been a
pretty fun one thus far.
The No. 4 Cardinal (11-2, 8-1
MPSF) concluded the final two
games of a ten-game road stretch in
impressive fashion, taking down
No. 2 UC-Irvine (10-3, 6-3) in
straight sets on Friday night, 32-30,
25-15,25-23, before fending off UC-
San Diego (3-11,1-8) in four sets,
25-17,24-26,25-14,25-14, on Satur
day. The wins drew the Cardinal
even with top-ranked UCLA for
first place in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) stand
ings, as the Bruins were upset by
Long Beach State on Tuesday.
The tone for Friday's match was
established in the first set, when the
Cardinal trailed Irvine by scores of

22-16 and 24-21, but managed to
rally by fending off eight set points.
Two players, senior Brad Lawson
and sophomore Eric Mochalski,
came through in the clutch for the
Cardinal during the opening set.
Lawson had six kills and no errors,
while Mochalski came up with five
blocks down the stretch, including
two on match points. Stanford was
finally able to close out the set by a
score of 32-30 on a kill by sopho
more Steven Irvin.
"The coaches put together a
great game plan so we understood
what UC-Irvine wanted to do,"
Mochalski said. "Our servers forced
passes off of the net, which limited
UC-Irvine's options, and the out
side blockers set up the block in
great spots. I was just lucky I closed
up some of those blocks."
The second set lacked the drama
of the first, as the Cardinal used a
15-6 run to capitalize on what had
been a one-point lead in the set.
Irvin and fellow sophomore Brian
Cook each had four kills to lead the
Stanford attack.

In the third, Irvine battled
valiantly, as the Anteaters under
stood that they were going to have
to play well to dig themselves out of
a two-set hole. Despite falling be
hind 16-11, Irvine battled back to
even the score at 22 and was down
just one, 24-23, at match point. The
Cardinal foiled the Anteaters'
hopes, however, and finished off its
opponents on a kill by Mochalski,
the man who got it all started in the
opening set.
For the match, Cook led all play
ers with 15 kills while Lawson and
Irvin each contributed 12. Mochals
ki finished with just five kills but
had a season-high eight blocks. For
Irvine, junior Kevin Tillie was the
leader with 10 kills.
On Saturday night, the focus for
the Cardinal was to avoid a letdown
against last-place UCSD, a team
that has struggled to the tune of a
.197 hitting percentage on the sea
son.
The first set went according to
plan for Stanford, which jumped out to a 7-2 lead early
and never looked back, cruising to a 25-17 victory be
hind six kills from Lawson.
UCSD played substantially better in the second set,
using good defense to force eight Stanford errors. The
Tritons used consecutive combined blocks by junior
Carl Eberts and sophomore Fred Stahl to steal a set
from the Cardinal, 26-24. Sophomore Vaun Lennon
had five kills to lead the Tritons in the set, while frvin
led Stanford with six.
The Cardinal rebounded and was able to take firm
control of the match, holding UCSD to a .019 hitting
percentage for the final two sets. UCSD finished with a
.139 hitting percentage for the match, in comparison to
Stanford's stellar mark .455.
Much of this can be attributed to the play of senior
setter Evan Barry, who continued his strong season
with a combined 92 assists over the weekend. Barry
leads the nation with 12.26 assists per set.
"I have confidence in all of my hitters," Barry said.
"The passing is so good that I always have all of my op
tions available. It makes my job a lot easier."
Barry and the Cardinal will finally return home this
weekend to the friendly confines of Maples Pavilion,
where they will take on Pepperdine and USC as the
newly minted No. 1 team in the nation.
"It's awesome. The experience doesn't really come
around that often," Barry said of becoming No. 1. "We

always like to have the mentality of being underdogs,
so we are going to have to work harder to convince our
selves of that moving forward."
