# FRESHMEN PHENOMS SHINE IN TOURNY
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford men's tennis
team had a successful weekend at
the National Team Indoor Cham
pionships in Charlottesville, Va., as
the Cardinal went 2-1 against some
of the toughest competition in the
country. Helping the Cardinal's
cause was the highly anticipated
return of senior All-American
Bradley Klahn, who played singles
for the first time in the dual-match
season.

Stanford's first-round match in
the 16-team tournament was
against No. 7 Baylor. The Bears
have long been a thorn in the side of
head coach John Whitlinger's Stan
ford teams, having defeated the
Cardinal in 12 straight matches be
fore Friday's contest. Early on, it
looked like this one might have
gone the same way, as the Bears
eked out a close victory in the dou
bles matches and took a 1-0 lead.
Playing out of the three spot as
he continued his progression back
to full health, Klahn quickly evened
the match at one by dispatching his
opponent in straight sets. Another
point for the Bears put Stanford on
the brink of defeat, but the team's
two freshmen, John Morrissey and
Robert Stineman, bailed out their
more experienced teammates and
soon put Stanford in the lead at 3-2
and in position to clinch the match.
Senior Ryan Thatcher, playing out
of the No. 1 position, was soon able
to deliver, sending Stanford on to
the quarterfinals against the home
team, second-seeded UVA.
Virginia is the team that elimi
nated Stanford from last year's
NCAA tournament, a loss made all

the more bitter because the tourna
ment was held at Stanford's Taube
Family Tennis Center. Stanford ulti
mately lost a competitive matchup
4-1, but each and every match was
tight, and the Cardinal,playing in an
extremely hostile environment,
more than proved itself.
"It was a great atmosphere out
there for the Virginia match,"
Whitlinger said. "I'm really glad the
guys got to experience that because
we're going to be going on the road
for the NCAAs and this weekend
provided some great experience
that we will be able to use to our ad
vantage in May."
Sunday's consolation match pit
ted Stanford against No. 6 Ken
tucky, another challenging foe for
Whitlinger's squad. After winning
the doubles point to start the match,
Stanford relied, once again, on the
power of its freshmen duo. The pair
won their matches by identical 6-4,
6-4 scores and provided the clinch
ing point for the 4-1 victory that
sent the Cardinal back home to
California on a high note.
"I can't say enough about what
they've done already this year,"
Whitlinger said of his prized re
cruits. "They're both incredible
fighters. Neither of them will ever
give up an inch without a fight. They
both always keep us in matches and
that is huge for us. They've been in
credible."
This weekend's performance,
coupled with the return of Klahn,
should help the Stanford men's ten
nis team turn the page from early
season losses and refocus the squad
on what is sure to be an exciting
couple months of tennis.
Stanford will look to continue
building positive momentum this
Friday afternoon at home against
Cal, as the rivals get together for
their biannual meeting.
