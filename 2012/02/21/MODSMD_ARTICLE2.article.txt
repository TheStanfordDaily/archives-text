# SUES recommends mandatory IntroSems
## 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
One of the more controversial recommen
dations of the recent Study on Undergradu
ate Education at Stanford (SUES) report is
that the University require Introductory
Seminars, a highly praised aspect of the fresh
man and sophomore experience, for each
freshman starting in fall 2013.
The SUES report described the IntroSem
program as "one of the jewels of Stanford,"
noting that participation in seminars intro
duces students to a broad range of university
level thinking, in addition to granting them
the opportunity to develop a relationship
with a faculty member that often is sustained
in future advising, research and honors work.
Historically, approximately 65 percent of
freshmen enroll in at least one IntroSem, with
that percentage rising to 75 percent of sopho
mores, according to the SUES report. The
University currently offers more than 200 In
troSems, with 120 dedicated to freshmen.
"We currently have the capacity to enroll
all freshmen in a seminar," said Susan Mc-
Connell, co-chair of the SUES committee.
"The real thing that we want to ensure ... is
to enable students to enroll in a seminar that
is highly attractive to them."
McConnell noted that several peer institu
tions, such as Northwestern University, have
implemented a seminar requirement for
freshmen with great success. She added that
IntroSems at Stanford have received consis
tently positive feedback from students and
faculty, an aspect of the program the SUES
committee has sought to preserve.
A student representative on the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Standards and Policies
(C-USP), Stephen Trusheim 'l3 expressed

concern about the speed with which the
SUES recommendations will be enacted.
"I don't believe that there's away that we
can do this [in only one year] without ruining
the core values that makes the IntroSem pro
gram great," Trusheim said.
Acknowledging some committee mem
bers' concerns that requiring enrollment in
IntroSems might diminish student enthusi
asm for the program and may force students
into courses they do not wish to take, the
SUES report recommends an "early and
thorough program review" of the new re
quirement.
"We don't want to kill a great program,"
McConnell said. "If it turns out this didn't
work, we should change our minds."
McConnell added that the program may
have to be adapted to incorporate currently
underrepresented groups such as student
athletes faced with scheduling conflicts, and
students in unit-heavy science majors further
constrained by a lack of seminar options
without unnecessary disruption. She added
that the Office of the Vice Provost of Under
graduate Education is currently developing
an algorithm to ensure that students are able
to attain their top IntroSem choices, while
also allowing faculty to retain some of their
current vetting power over seminar applica
tions.
McConnell emphasized, however, that a
third underrepresented group so-called
"at-risk" students, those entering Stanford ill
prepared to deal with university-level courses
will distinctly benefit from inclusion in the
IntroSem program and its emphasis on facul
ty interaction and enhanced academic devel
opment.
Trusheim argued, however, that for at-risk
students, "the benefits don't outweigh the un

intended consequences. There are other ways
to ensure that those students take IntroSems,
such as stronger advising, but to require it will
have particularly poor outcomes."
Faculty currently teaching IntroSems ex
pressed cautious enthusiasm about the SUES
committee's proposal.
"Research indicates that those college stu
dents who get to know a faculty member in
their first year have a better and more produc
tive college experience," said James Fearon,
professor of political science.
"There are a lot of things distinctive about
freshmen seminars," Fearon added. "The rela
tively small group setting provides a particu
larly effective teaching context, and the level
of engagement by everyone concerned tends
to be higher. You get to know students in the
seminar and they get to know you."
Fearon noted, however, that requiring In
troSems could potentially create efficiency is
sues for the University as a whole, with greater

numbers of faculty teaching seminars at the
expense of lecture classes with a higher num
ber of student participants.
Professor Josiah Ober, chair of the Political
Science Department, said that, while his de
partment receives some "replacement teach
ing funds" for faculty involvement with In
troSems, the funds are generally inadequate
to replace the duty time lost. Department
chairs will discuss the issue of department
compensation for faculty IntroSem involve
ment in a meeting with Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 next month.
The Committee on Undergraduate Stan
dards and Policies will make recommenda
tions in response to the SUES report at a Feb.
23 Faculty Senate meeting. The Senate will
vote on the final recommendations in a meet
ing on March 8.

Citing advantages for students including closer relationships with faculty and access to a
broad range of university-level courses, the recently released SUES report suggested that all
freshman be required to take at least one Introductory Seminar, beginning fall of 2013.
