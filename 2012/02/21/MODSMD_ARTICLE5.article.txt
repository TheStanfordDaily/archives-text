## Law School pioneers new curriculum 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Law School (SLS) announced last week
the completion of a five-year comprehensive reform
to its second- and third-year law curriculum. The
new multidimensional Juris Doctorate program in
corporates a more interdisciplinary approach while
emphasizing team-oriented problem-solving tech
niques and expanded hands-on clinical training.
The new curriculum will allow students to tailor
their own joint degree programs in almost any disci
pline while expanding the international dimension
of the program to integrate international business,
national security and trade and tax law into the tra
ditional curriculum.The school has added a new pro
gram, International Economic Law, to accommo
date the needs of international students and those
who plan to practice abroad. International students
now make up 15 percent of the upper-level (second
and third year) Law School student body, according
to a Law School press release.
Michael Gisser J.D. 'B2, a partner at Skadden,
Arps, Meagher and Flom LLP and an international
mergers and acquisition specialist, reacted positive
ly to the changes.
"Today's global practice typically involves multi
ple national jurisdictions often five or more in
a single transaction," Gisser said. "It's exciting to see
a U.S. law school respond to the global challenges in
contemporary law practice."
"From the perspective of international practice,
this is a game-changing set of innovations," Gisser
added. "The cross-border emphasis runs through
coursework, interdepartmental cooperation and

clinical programs. One cannot overstate the impor
tance of these changes: This means that Stanford
Law School is uniquely set up in a ground-up way to
enable students to become the leaders on a world
wide platform."
SLS also expanded its clinical education pro
gram, adding an in-house clinic operating as a single
law firm: the Mills Legal Clinic. A clinical rotation
based system was introduced based on medical
school models allowing second- and third-year
students to learn without exams or courses. Sixty
five percent of second- and third-year students
chose to enroll in a clinic in 2010, according to the
Law School press release.
Gabe Ledeen J.D. 'l2, who served as a Marine
Corps officer for four years before matriculating to
Stanford Law School, provided feedback on the
legal clinic curriculum.
"Being in Iraq and seeing what a country was like
in a society without the rule of law gave me a deep
appreciation for and hunger to understand our own
system of laws and how they affect society," Ledeen
said.
He referenced his experience working at the
Stanford Criminal Prosecution Clinic, run by Profes
sor George Fisher J.D. '67 at the Santa Clara Coun
ty District Attorney's office in San Jose, as a positive
example of the school's emphasis on real-world
training.
We "are each assigned a primary supervisor who
assigns us cases," Ledeen said. "We write briefs, and
argue cases, though not in front of juries."
"There are only six students in the clinic and it's a
very unique opportunity," he
added. "I don't know of any schools
that do this."
Ledeen said the key benefit of
the clinic for him was exposure to
legal practice,
"Without this clinic there is no
way I could have gotten this kind of
experience... to actually see and
experience what prosecutors do,"
he said.
"The problem of law schools is
getting students exposed to the
practice of law and helping them to
determine what areas they are in
terested in pursuing as a career,"
Ledeen added. "This clinic gives us
the opportunity to see what prose
cution work is like, what skills are in
volved and what the lifestyle is, and
that has been invaluable."
Ledeen added that a second key
benefit of his clinical experience
was exposure to substantive areas
of the law, which helps law students
develop a "much deeper under
standing of our criminal justice sys
tem than [one] could possibly get by
just sitting in a classroom."
Noting the course prerequisites

in evidence and criminal proce
dures that law students must take
before enrolling in the clinic,
Ledeen commented, "We actually
have taken classes that are relevant
and prepared us for the substantive
legal material that we have to work
with in the clinic. All of us are well
prepared."
Ledeen reflected on the oppor
tunities Stanford offers its range of
law students as a draw for him in the
application process.
"One of the big draws of Stan
ford was the possibilities that it af
forded," Ledeen said. "What's great
about the changes and this curricu
lum is that it recognizes that all law
students aren't created equal...
We have different interests, differ
ent skills, [and] different back
grounds. This curriculum and the
options that it provides give us flex
ibility to identify what we're inter
ested in and to pursue them even if
they aren't traditional."
Ledeen noted that the new cur
riculum is based in "Silicon Valley
and the entrepreneurial culture here.
The law school is very much tied in to
that.That's a big part of why that cur
riculum works so well here."
Other changes implemented as
part of the curricular reforms in
clude enlarged and modified stu
dent and faculty research opportu

nities through the launch of a dozen
new research centers and programs
in areas such as constitutional and
criminal law, energy and corporate
governance. For example, law stu
dents have recently worked on im
plementing California's Public
Safely Realignment Act.
Additionally, law students now
have the opportunity to gain direct
experience studying and working in
global settings. Stanford students
have worked in Afghanistan,
Bhutan, Timor Leste, Iraq and other
locations pursuing externships,
summer jobs and student exchange
programs in topics such as law and
development.
To assist students in choosing
auricular and career paths, the Law
School created online proprietary
tools and a website to facilitate so
cial and professional networking
and mentoring.
The Law School's five-year ini
tiative coincided with a University
wide five-year fundraising cam
paign, the Stanford Challenge,
which has enabled the Law School
to finance auricular and infrastruc
ture changes. Stanford Law School
Dean Larry Kramer spearheaded
the implementation of the reforms.
