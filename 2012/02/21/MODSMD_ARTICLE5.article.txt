## Law School pioneers new curriculum 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Law School (SLS) announced last week
the completion of a five-year comprehensive reform
to its second- and third-year law curriculum. The
new multidimensional Juris Doctorate program in
corporates a more interdisciplinary approach while
emphasizing team-oriented problem-solving tech
niques and expanded hands-on clinical training.
The new curriculum will allow students to tailor
their own joint degree programs in almost any disci
pline while expanding the international dimension
of the program to integrate international business,
national security and trade and tax law into the tra
ditional curriculum.The school has added a new pro
gram, International Economic Law, to accommo
date the needs of international students and those
who plan to practice abroad. International students
now make up 15 percent of the upper-level (second
and third year) Law School student body, according
to a Law School press release.
Michael Gisser J.D. 'B2, a partner at Skadden,
Arps, Meagher and Flom LLP and an international
mergers and acquisition specialist, reacted positive
ly to the changes.
"Today's global practice typically involves multi
ple national jurisdictions often five or more in
a single transaction," Gisser said. "It's exciting to see
a U.S. law school respond to the global challenges in
contemporary law practice."
"From the perspective of international practice,
this is a game-changing set of innovations," Gisser
added. "The cross-border emphasis runs through
coursework, interdepartmental cooperation and

clinical programs. One cannot overstate the impor
tance of these changes: This means that Stanford
Law School is uniquely set up in a ground-up way to
enable students to become the leaders on a world
wide platform."
SLS also expanded its clinical education pro
gram, adding an in-house clinic operating as a single
law firm: the Mills Legal Clinic. A clinical rotation
based system was introduced based on medical
school models allowing second- and third-year
students to learn without exams or courses. Sixty
five percent of second- and third-year students
chose to enroll in a clinic in 2010, according to the
Law School press release.
Gabe Ledeen J.D. 'l2, who served as a Marine
Corps officer for four years before matriculating to
Stanford Law School, provided feedback on the
legal clinic curriculum.
"Being in Iraq and seeing what a country was like
in a society without the rule of law gave me a deep
appreciation for and hunger to understand our own
system of laws and how they affect society," Ledeen
said.
He referenced his experience working at the
Stanford Criminal Prosecution Clinic, run by Profes
sor George Fisher J.D. '67 at the Santa Clara Coun
ty District Attorney's office in San Jose, as a positive
example of the school's emphasis on real-world
training.
We "are each assigned a primary supervisor who
assigns us cases," Ledeen said. "We write briefs, and
argue cases, though not in front of juries."
"There are only six students in the clinic and it's a
