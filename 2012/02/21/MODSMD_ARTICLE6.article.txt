## Tubbs begins Stockton City Council run 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
Michael Tubbs 'l2 officially announced
his candidacy for the 6th District of Stock
ton City Council to an audience of more
than 200 Monday at the Van Buskirk Com
munity Center in Stockton, Calif.
Tubbs' speech focused on "the long
road to victory we have in battling ...
poverty, crime, hopelessness and the politi
cal power system," he said in an email to
The Daily.
A South Stockton native, Tubbs cited
multiple reasons behind his run for office,
emphasizing that he feels ready to face the
issues he grew up with and still observes in
his hometown.
"I'm running for office because I know
I'm prepared and qualified; I've been per
sonally affected by the issues and I have a
strong love for my city," Tubbs said. "I want
to bring my resources and my experiences
to a city that really needs them."
Tubbs said that he made his decision to
run over this past winter break, when may
oral plans to fight crime in Stockton
which were initially announced in May
were still unreleased by December.
Asserting that his campaign objective is
to re-invent Stockton,Tubbs added that his
vision for Stockton is "re-weaving the fab
ric of community with the foreclosure cri
sis, with crime, with the current education
al system."
While Tubbs acknowledged that his
young age of 21 may pose obstacles, he said
that coupled with his experience and vi
sion he sees it as more of an asset for his
pursuit of long-term goals and for the ac
cess it grants him to technological tools en
couraging government transparency.
"My vision for Stockton is to have re
sponsible, knowledgeable policy-makers
real leaders of the people who aren't
afraid to talk to the people, who put the
people's interests first and are also knowl
edgeable and able to make tough decisions
and inspire and galvanize people to ac
tion," Tubbs said. "My vision for Stockton
is to have a community where young peo
ple can maximize and realize their full po
tential."
Tubbs attributed much of his qualifica
tions for elected office to his experience
working in the White House Office of Inter-
governmental Affairs during his
sophomore year as part of the Bing
Stanford in Washington program.
During his time in Washington,
Tubbs says that he obtained first
hand experience in policy-making
with mayors and councilmembers
from around the nation.
Tubbs, who expects to release a
complete policy platform during
the next few months, said that
while many of his concerns relate
to Stockton specifically his
campaign is still inclusive to the
Stanford community and will seek
direct student involvement.
"This campaign is incredibly in
clusive even though Stanford stu
dents are not a part of Stockton,"
Tubbs said. "They have a stake in
this race too, because a lot of the
problems in Stockton are prob
lems facing the nation as a whole."
At Stanford, Tubbs' support
group includes, among others.
Dean of Freshmen and Under
graduate Advising Julie Lythcott-
Haims 'B9.
"Since I first met Michael as a
freshman I've been impressed

with his leadership, passion for so
cial justice, personal narrative and
style of oratory," Lythcott-Haims
said. "I felt it was only a matter of
time before Michael would seek
to serve the Stockton community
in an official capacity, and I'm en
joying watching him take this bold
first step."
Tubbs spoke at Stanford's Oc
cupy the Future rally on Dec.9
and discussed his origins and hesi
tations about attending Stanford
at the University's 2011 Opening
Convocation Ceremony.
"I [felt that] I was not Stanford
because I was born to a teenaged
mother and an incarcerated father
... I was not Stanford because I
went to a large, failing urban high
school, I was not Stanford because
I came from a community that
most would consider 'the hood,"'
he said when addressing incoming
students at Convocation.
The primary for the Stockton
City Council's 6th District will take
place on June 5, with the election
against Republican incumbent
Dale Fritchen scheduled for Nov.
6. If elected as one of the city's six
councilmembers, Tubbs will serve a
term of four years.
