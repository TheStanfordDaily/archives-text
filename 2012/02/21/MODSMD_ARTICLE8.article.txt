# OPINIONS
## FROM FARM TO FORK Training for basic food literacy 
### Jenny Rempel 
I spent Friday on Amtrak's
Coast Starlight, headed from
San Jose to Santa Barbara.
Though I didn't venture into the
train's dining car, I still learned a
bit about California's food sys
tems during the eight-hour ride.
Train windows expose riders to
a much different version of reality
than the one usually visible from a
car window. Lacking a driver's li
cense, I've always been a bit of a
passive road-trip nose-to-window
offender. Thanks to a childhood
spent driving back and forth be
tween my grandparents' home in
lowa and my home in California,
I'd like to think I've familiarized
myself with the cattle pastures and
subsidized monocultures of corn
and soy that dominate much of
our country's roadside landscapes.
Apart from these common
agricultural scenes, cars also fun
nel passengers into a very struc
tured food experience. Billboards
tout the flavors of nearby restau
rants, and road signs count down
the mileage to the nearest fast
food drive-through window.
This highly structured experi
ence matches the carefully con
structed charade through which
many customers interact with and
experience their food. For in
stance, grocery stores are laid out
to channel customers into the mid
dle aisles, where brand-name,
processed foods are located. Bulk
goods are hidden in the rear of the
store, and produce can usually be
found on the outer aisles. Even
shelf placement is key. The top
racks tend to be reserved for
smaller brand names, the best sell
ers are found in the middle and the
bottom shelf can even be targeted
specifically toward children's eyes.
This strategic layout decision
also encourages shoppers to buy
more, and for the most part, this
stealthy campaign has been suc
cessful. One study by the Point of
Purchase Advertising Institute
showed that up to two-thirds of
buyers' purchases are unintended
and occur in-store.
Buying food at grocery stores
and being served meals at restau
rants can also divorce consumers
from the history of their food.
Without exposure to farms or
even basic food preparation, many
Americans are disconnected from
their food sources. In her book
"Kitchen Literacy: Flow We Lost
Knowledge of Where Food
Comes from and Why We Need to
Get It Back," Ann Vileisis argues
that this disconnect is what drives
the health and environmental
crises of our industrialized food
society. While there are certainly

other factors contributing to
America's obesity epidemic and
the growing dead zone in the Gulf
of Mexico, Vileisis has, I think,
identified one of the large and im
mediate opportunities for change
in our food systems.
Sure, there are ways to beat the
structured system at the grocery
store by buying a colorful array of
produce items and seeking out
"real foods" on the perimeter of
the grocery store, but this is not
enough to address our societal dis
connect with food.
Already, this disconnect has
been greatly reduced for subsets
of America, following the Michael
Pollan era of "sustainable foods."
Heightened awareness about the
environmental and social implica
tions of our eating behaviors has
encouraged many individuals to
revisit their agricultural roots and
explore the sources of their food.
While watching the country's
Salad Bowl (Salinas), Garlic Capi
tal (Gilroy) and Artichoke Capital
(Castroville) pass by my train win
dow this weekend, I was struck by
just how accessible farming sys
tems are in California. Stanford
students complain of isolation in
"the bubble," as campus is some
times called. But you don't need to
take a train to visit a farm. Just out
side of Campus Drive Loop lies a
well-kept Stanford secret: We
have a community farm!
Almost every Sunday after
noon from around 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Patrick Archie, farm educator, and
his team host a workday and pizza
party using the wood-fired oven.
Everyone is welcome to join, and
no prior knowledge is required.
These work parties are an op
portunity for Stanford students to
bridge the gap between food con
sumption and production. They
provide a wonderfully experien
tial way to actively engage in our
campus food system.
As exciting as it was to watch
California's agricultural abun
dance flow past my window on a
train, actually setting foot on a
farm or in a garden is ultimately a
much better way to learn about
agriculture and reconnect with
your food's origins.

I spent Friday on Amtrak's
Coast Starlight, headed from
San Jose to Santa Barbara.
Though I didn't venture into the
train's dining car, I still learned a
bit about California's food sys
tems during the eight-hour ride.
Train windows expose riders to
a much different version of reality
than the one usually visible from a
car window. Lacking a driver's li
cense, I've always been a bit of a
passive road-trip nose-to-window
offender. Thanks to a childhood
spent driving back and forth be
tween my grandparents' home in
lowa and my home in California,
I'd like to think I've familiarized
myself with the cattle pastures and
subsidized monocultures of corn
and soy that dominate much of
our country's roadside landscapes.
Apart from these common
agricultural scenes, cars also fun
nel passengers into a very struc
tured food experience. Billboards
tout the flavors of nearby restau
rants, and road signs count down
the mileage to the nearest fast
food drive-through window.
This highly structured experi
ence matches the carefully con
structed charade through which
many customers interact with and
experience their food. For in
stance, grocery stores are laid out
to channel customers into the mid
dle aisles, where brand-name,
processed foods are located. Bulk
goods are hidden in the rear of the
store, and produce can usually be
found on the outer aisles. Even
shelf placement is key. The top
racks tend to be reserved for
smaller brand names, the best sell
ers are found in the middle and the
bottom shelf can even be targeted
specifically toward children's eyes.
This strategic layout decision
also encourages shoppers to buy
more, and for the most part, this
stealthy campaign has been suc
cessful. One study by the Point of
Purchase Advertising Institute
showed that up to two-thirds of
buyers' purchases are unintended
and occur in-store.
Buying food at grocery stores
and being served meals at restau
rants can also divorce consumers
from the history of their food.
Without exposure to farms or
even basic food preparation, many
Americans are disconnected from
their food sources. In her book
"Kitchen Literacy: Flow We Lost
Knowledge of Where Food
Comes from and Why We Need to
Get It Back," Ann Vileisis argues
that this disconnect is what drives
the health and environmental
crises of our industrialized food
society. While there are certainly

other factors contributing to
America's obesity epidemic and
the growing dead zone in the Gulf
of Mexico, Vileisis has, I think,
identified one of the large and im
mediate opportunities for change
in our food systems.
Sure, there are ways to beat the
structured system at the grocery
store by buying a colorful array of
produce items and seeking out
"real foods" on the perimeter of
the grocery store, but this is not
enough to address our societal dis
connect with food.
Already, this disconnect has
been greatly reduced for subsets
of America, following the Michael
Pollan era of "sustainable foods."
Heightened awareness about the
environmental and social implica
tions of our eating behaviors has
encouraged many individuals to
revisit their agricultural roots and
explore the sources of their food.
While watching the country's
Salad Bowl (Salinas), Garlic Capi
tal (Gilroy) and Artichoke Capital
(Castroville) pass by my train win
dow this weekend, I was struck by
just how accessible farming sys
tems are in California. Stanford
students complain of isolation in
"the bubble," as campus is some
times called. But you don't need to
take a train to visit a farm. Just out
side of Campus Drive Loop lies a
well-kept Stanford secret: We
have a community farm!
Almost every Sunday after
noon from around 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Patrick Archie, farm educator, and
his team host a workday and pizza
party using the wood-fired oven.
Everyone is welcome to join, and
no prior knowledge is required.
These work parties are an op
portunity for Stanford students to
bridge the gap between food con
sumption and production. They
provide a wonderfully experien
tial way to actively engage in our
campus food system.

dance flow past my window on a
train, actually setting foot on a
