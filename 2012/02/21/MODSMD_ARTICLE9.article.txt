## Is Jeremy Lin a superstar? 
### Chase Ishii 
My friend Brett is an avid
Derek Fisher fan. And
when I say avid, I mean
the only thing keeping him from
stealing a lock of Fisher's hair and
performing a creepy, voodoo ritu
al in his closet shrine is the fact
that Derek Fisher is bald and has
no hair. So after Jeremy Lin
torched the Los Angeles Lakers
with 38 points in his third career
start, I texted him, "Looks like
your D-Fish couldn't handle
guarding my Asian tonight."
To which he cleverly respond
ed, "Oh, so you decided you're
Asian now?"
For most of my life, I've consid
ered myself a product of a white,
Southern Californian culture,
stressing the "American" much
more than "Asian-American." He
had very appropriately called me
out for suddenly leaping onto the
Linsanity bandwagon.
Also, I wish they would have
instead called it "Linception," and
then played the ominous boom
from the "Inception" soundtrack
every time he scored.
Jeremy Lin has been called a
symbol, but a symbol of what? If
you don't follow basketball or
don't have any Asian friends on
your Facebook news feed, Jeremy
Lin has exploded into the league
out of obscurity and is making his
tory in the NBA. For me, it isn't re
ally an encouraging story of
Asian-American empowerment.
Even though this theme is incred
ibly important to those with a
strong Asian identity, the fact of

the matter is: he is 6-foot-3 and I
am 5-foot-3. For me, it's not the
empowering "If He, Why Not
Me?" Jackie-Robinson-of-bas
ketball story.
The "Christian sports hero"
line doesn't resonate with me ei
ther. Jesus often empowered the
poor, obscure and rejected, but I
still haven't found the verse that
says, "Blessed are the rock stars
and sports heroes." I'm not saying
that his success is wrong or
shouldn't be celebrated by Chris
tians as a brother in Christ (espe
cially in the case of Lin's incredi
ble humility), but it seems like
idolatry to place him on a bill
board for Christianity, as if his suc
cess makes the faith and message
cooler or more compelling.
This is scientifically known as
"The Tebow Effect." However, I
don't think the label of an "out
spoken Christian" is fair either.
After all, he isn't half-court prose
lytizing. People are asking person
al questions about his life and
sticking a mic in his face, and he is
responding honestly; this is what
Christians should be announcing
over his statistics.
David Brooks of The New
York Times recently wrote a mis
informed and unconvincing arti
cle, titled, "The Jeremy Lin Prob
lem," about how "the moral ethos
of sports is in tension with the
moral ethos of faith." Brooks
claims today's sports hero is an as
sertive, self-touting, center-of-at
tention-seeking athlete who puts
himself on display. It'd be difficult
to argue against the worldwide
coverage (and violent mob of
New York Knicks' fans) that Lin is
not a sports hero. But, does he fit
Brooks' definition?
In last week's win over the
Sacramento Kings, Lin scored
only 10 points on 4-6 shooting
(but with 13 assists) and then
commented he felt he was taking
too many shots. Imagine Kobe
Bryant (averaging 23.9 attempts)
saying that.
When asked to comment on
his recent success, Lin stated he
was uncomfortable with the lime
light and wished people would
pay more attention to his team
mates' accomplishments. And in
the Knicks' only loss in eight
games with Lin at the helm, he
publicly took full responsibility
for the loss. Imagine Le√üron

James saying either of those
things.
In response to questions about
taunts, insults and racial slurs, Lin
answered, "As I grew older, I real
ized that I shouldn't allow that
stuff to affect me, and at the same
time I shouldn't retaliate ... It's
just something I'm used to now,
and it's a good opportunity to re
flect the grace of God when you
don't say anything back, or when
you're really respectful in return."
Just like in that Sprite commer
cial when Kobe says his thirst is to
"prove them wrong," right?
Perhaps Brooks is right in
claiming that the self-soliciting su
perstar we know is not compatible
with the morality of faith. And
perhaps the flashy, adventurous,
take-charge superstar we know in
our Western world is not compat
ible with a more Eastern under
standing of masculinity.
But, perhaps Lin has no inten
tion of being the superstar we
know, or a superstar at all for that
matter. Rather than downplaying
or dropping his Christian and
Asian values to meet the current
archetype of a superstar, Lin has
fully embraced his fundamental
identity. He's shattered the mold.
All he does is Lin.

If you're thinking, "Forget Jeremy
Lin. That 5-foot-3 Asian guy
sounds like a real score!" then email

Jeremy Lin has
been called a
symbol, but a
symbol of what?
