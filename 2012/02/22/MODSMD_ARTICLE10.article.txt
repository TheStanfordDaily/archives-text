## Stop the brain drain? Campaign finance and conflicting career messages 
### 
On Feb. 6, 2012, President
Barack Obama's reelec
tion campaign an
nounced that Obama would start
to publicly back Priorities USA,
a super-PAC run by former
Obama aides. Obama, an out
spoken critic of the Supreme
Court's 2010 ruling in Citizens
United that opened the flood
gates for special interest influ
ence, was criticized by some for
his reversal of position, accused
of both betraying his ideals and
relinquishing a distinction he
could make between himself
and candidates who have readily
embraced super-PAC funding.
Furthermore, Obama disap
pointed the Editorial Board, by
preaching one message go
into less lucrative careers where
you can make a social impact
and practicing another with his
personal decision to opt in to a
wealth-driven campaign funding
mechanism.
The campaign's decision was
framed as necessary and prag
matic, a painful concession as
Obama needed to play by the
new rules in order to stay in the
running in an election that has
seen enormous amounts of
money spent on negative attack
ads. Jim Messina, Obama's cam
paign manager, wrote in an
email to supporters that the
"stakes are too important to play
by two different sets of rules. If
we fail to act, we concede this
election to a small group of pow
erful people intent on removing
the president at any cost."
Obama's recent visit to the
Bay Area further underscored
the current state of political
fundraising: there were no free
public events, with tickets to a
Masonic Center speech starting
at $25 and private events costing
up to $35,800 a person. These
fundraising decisions are cer
tainly not unique to Obama.
Mitt Romney's super-PAC has
over $l6 million waiting to be
spent and Newt Gingrich largely
hosted private events during his
recent Bay Area visit. Yet
Obama's outspoken critiques of
the corrupting influence of
money on politics makes his
super-PAC move more unex
pected and disappointing than
similar decisions by his rivals.
The justification for the cam
paign's decision hold on to
your ideals until they become
politically risky, and then sacri
fice them for pragmatic concerns
leaves us as students in a diffi
cult position when faced with
similar decisions on a smaller
scale, decisions about whether to
act in line with our ideals or to
make pragmatic concessions.
Furthermore, the current state
of campaign financing, where
wealthy individuals and corpo
rations exert an unlimited finan

cial influence on the outcome of
a campaign, undermines the ex
hortations made by Obama and
other political leaders to pursue
careers in public service ex
hortations that Obama has com
mendably backed up with in
creased support for AmeriCorps
and a Social Innovation Fund to
grow community-based service
programs.
Yet these programs lose their
potency when wealth becomes
closely associated with political
efficacy. On the one hand, we are
encouraged to nurture and re
tain an idealistic spirit about the
impact we can make on our
country. We are told to stop the
brain drain, to turn down Gold
man Sachs for Greenpeace, and
not to pursue a career based on
the paycheck or bonus we'll be
handed at the end of the year.
But our present political climate
forms a dark background for this
message. Wealthy donors and
wealthy corporations are grant
ed an increasingly weighty share
of political efficacy. So should we
sacrifice our ideals and make a
pragmatic decision to pursue a
career with a paycheck that will
lead to increased political influ
ence in years to come?
Which train of thought is the
confused sophomore or per
plexed senior supposed to fol
low: the idealist optimism that
one can eschew a lucrative pay
check for a low-paying career
that one finds more socially
meaningful, or cynical skepticism
that choosing a lucrative career
path will result in increased polit
ical efficacy? Of course, the
choice is not always so stark
there are high-paying jobs that
are satisfying and socially mean
ingful, and lower-paying jobs that
may be morally repulsive and
a student could eventually have
more influence as a lower-paid
senator or congresswoman than
as a wealthy hedge fund manag
er. Yet for students who are inter
ested in making a social and po
litical impact (for the two are in
extricably intertwined), it is diffi
cult to reconcile the small proba
bility that we'll exert political in
fluence through activism or hold
ing public office with the present
reality that having a less lucrative
career means that, in many re
spects, we'll be sitting on the
proverbial political sidelines.
In conclusion, though we
commend Obama for his cri
tiques of the present state of
campaign finance, his concession
to fundraise with a super-PAC
for pragmatic reasons sends a
discouraging message. We as stu
dents have become painfully
aware that choosing a less lucra
tive career path may result in los
ing a degree of political efficacy
in our present, wealth-driven po
litical system.

handed at the end of the year.
But our present political climate
forms a dark background for this
message. Wealthy donors and
wealthy corporations are grant
ed an increasingly weighty share
of political efficacy. So should we
sacrifice our ideals and make a
pragmatic decision to pursue a
career with a paycheck that will
lead to increased political influ
ence in years to come?
Which train of thought is the
confused sophomore or per
plexed senior supposed to fol
low: the idealist optimism that
one can eschew a lucrative pay
check for a low-paying career
that one finds more socially
meaningful, or cynical skepticism
that choosing a lucrative career
path will result in increased polit
ical efficacy? Of course, the
choice is not always so stark
there are high-paying jobs that
are satisfying and socially mean
ingful, and lower-paying jobs that
may be morally repulsive and
a student could eventually have
more influence as a lower-paid
senator or congresswoman than
as a wealthy hedge fund manag
er. Yet for students who are inter
ested in making a social and po
litical impact (for the two are in
extricably intertwined), it is diffi
cult to reconcile the small proba
bility that we'll exert political in
fluence through activism or hold
ing public office with the present
reality that having a less lucrative
career means that, in many re
spects, we'll be sitting on the
proverbial political sidelines.
In conclusion, though we
commend Obama for his cri
tiques of the present state of
campaign finance, his concession
to fundraise with a super-PAC
for pragmatic reasons sends a
discouraging message. We as stu
dents have become painfully
aware that choosing a less lucra
tive career path may result in los
ing a degree of political efficacy
in our present, wealth-driven po
litical system.

On Feb. 6, 2012, President
Barack Obama's reelec
tion campaign an
nounced that Obama would start
to publicly back Priorities USA,
a super-PAC run by former
Obama aides. Obama, an out
spoken critic of the Supreme
Court's 2010 ruling in Citizens
United that opened the flood
gates for special interest influ
ence, was criticized by some for
his reversal of position, accused
of both betraying his ideals and
relinquishing a distinction he
could make between himself
and candidates who have readily
embraced super-PAC funding.
Furthermore, Obama disap
pointed the Editorial Board, by
preaching one message go
into less lucrative careers where
you can make a social impact
and practicing another with his
personal decision to opt in to a
wealth-driven campaign funding
mechanism.
The campaign's decision was
framed as necessary and prag
matic, a painful concession as
Obama needed to play by the
new rules in order to stay in the
running in an election that has
seen enormous amounts of
money spent on negative attack
ads. Jim Messina, Obama's cam
paign manager, wrote in an
email to supporters that the
"stakes are too important to play
by two different sets of rules. If
we fail to act, we concede this
election to a small group of pow
erful people intent on removing
the president at any cost."
Obama's recent visit to the
Bay Area further underscored
the current state of political
fundraising: there were no free
public events, with tickets to a
Masonic Center speech starting
at $25 and private events costing
up to $35,800 a person. These
fundraising decisions are cer
tainly not unique to Obama.
Mitt Romney's super-PAC has
over $l6 million waiting to be
spent and Newt Gingrich largely
hosted private events during his
recent Bay Area visit. Yet
Obama's outspoken critiques of
the corrupting influence of
money on politics makes his
super-PAC move more unex
pected and disappointing than
similar decisions by his rivals.
The justification for the cam
paign's decision hold on to
your ideals until they become
politically risky, and then sacri
fice them for pragmatic concerns
leaves us as students in a diffi
cult position when faced with
similar decisions on a smaller
scale, decisions about whether to
act in line with our ideals or to
make pragmatic concessions.
Furthermore, the current state
of campaign financing, where
wealthy individuals and corpo
rations exert an unlimited finan

cial influence on the outcome of
a campaign, undermines the ex
hortations made by Obama and
other political leaders to pursue
careers in public service ex
hortations that Obama has com
mendably backed up with in
creased support for AmeriCorps
and a Social Innovation Fund to
grow community-based service
programs.
Yet these programs lose their
potency when wealth becomes
closely associated with political
efficacy. On the one hand, we are
encouraged to nurture and re
tain an idealistic spirit about the
impact we can make on our
country. We are told to stop the
brain drain, to turn down Gold
man Sachs for Greenpeace, and
not to pursue a career based on
the paycheck or bonus we'll be
handed at the end of the year.

forms a dark background for this
message. Wealthy donors and
