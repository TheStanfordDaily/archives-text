## TALKING THE DANCE FLOOR SOCIAL DANCE AT JAMMIX 
### SHIRLEY YARIN 
M ■ liding across the floor, I hold on
I tightly as my partner leads the way.
I After several turns, claps, stomps
and bows, the music stops, and, to
my astonishment, the crowd
cheers. No matter how fleeting or sponta
neous the moment, I will always remember
the first time I danced the Bohemian Na
tional Polka.
I credit this experience to Cameron Scha
effer 'll, a social dance aficionado. The site
was Jammix, a Stanford event that features
social dancing once a month in Roble Gym.
Schaeffer assured me that newcomers are
encouraged to join even if they don't know
the dance.
"Unlike other ballroom venues, Jammix
is about having fun, pleasing your partner
and goofing off," Schaeffer said.
Students may be hesitant to initially at
tend Jammix, partly because of the high skill
level of many other social dancers.
"Upon entering the room, it can be pret
ty intimidating," said participant Rebekah
Oragwu 'l5, "but then people come up to
you and guide you as you stumble and laugh
during the rotary waltz, and suddenly it's just
fun."
The event draws participants from all
over campus and from all sectors of the

Stanford population from computer sci
entists to dance majors.
Stanford's enthusiasm for social dance
comes from the popular class Social Dances
of North America, taught by dance instruc
tor Richard Powers M.S. '7O. The typical
class enrollment ranges from 120 to 130 stu
dents each quarter.
"[Social dance at Stanford] all starts and
ends with Richard Powers, a vintage dance
instructor, ex-product designer and dance
historian who revived and taught social
dance when he joined the Stanford faculty in
1992," said participant Acata Felton 'l2.
The walls inside Powers' office are cov
ered with vintage posters depicting different
ballroom dances from across the world. Lit
tle figurines of dancers line the shelf. As a
graduate student at Stanford, Powers stud
ied the creative process in engineering, art
and philosophy. After he graduated, Powers
went into the field of engineering, from
which he received seven design and twenty
director awards.
His first foray into movement art was tai
chi, evolving from his study of Japanese and
Chinese calligraphy. He quickly discovered
his love of dancing with other people.
"At that time, I also loved history," Pow
ers said. "I took a historic dance workshop
on East Coast Renaissance and Baroque
dance and pushed into 19th-century rag
time-era social dance, which at the time was
a black sheep for the scholars."

Today Powers also offers courses on the
history of social dance that students describe
as fun, contemporary and engaging. His
choice to jump irom engineer to dance in
structor and historian stems from a desire
"to do the most good while doing the least
harm," he said.
According to Powers, the social dance
classes are not solely recreational, but also a
great stress reliever that offers students valu
able skills in ballroom dancing and life.
"A significant aspect of social dance is the
ability to adapt to new partners," Powers
said, remarking that making split-second de
cisions makes one not only a better dancer,
but also a better thinker.
Jammix is a space where students who
take Social Dances of North America can
practice, share steps they've picked up and
invent new ones. Attendees generally con
sist of current students and local alumni who
come back to campus just for the night.
Music is a key component of the Jammix
experience. While Powers, who acts as disc
jockey for the event, has a set playlist, he also
must read the energy of the crowd when se
lecting songs. He aims to choose music that
is "current, whimsical and danceable," fea
turing an eclectic mix of techno, Hindi pop,
K-pop, swing, Latin salsa and everything in
between. Visitors who walk into Roble Gym
during Jammix might be surprised to view a
roomful of couples swinging to Lady Gaga's
"Poker Face" or performing the cha-cha to

Marc Anthony.
In terms of dance styles, students usually
engage in the swing, waltz, tango, salsa, cha
cha and Irish line dances. When a song turns
on, Roble Gym freezes for a moment as
dancers feel the pulse of the music, and then
the room immediately erupts into move
ment. As the beat of some songs can be ap
plied to various dances, not all couples may
choose the same step, resulting in hazardous
situations: not infrequently, energetic
dancers who opt for the galloping polka may
collide with more stationary swingers.
Yet dancing is not the only attraction of
Jammix.
"I came for the dancing, I stayed for the
people," Felton said.
Along the sidelines of the dance floor, in
dividuals congregate to chat while taking a
break from the vigor of social dancing. Jam
mix and other dance events and classes have
created a unique sort of social dance com
munity on campus.
For Powers, as a dance historian, the
beauty of Jammix lies in the recreation of
scenes from paintings and lithographs at the
height of the 19th-century dance craze in
Paris.
"I was hit by the rush of 200 young
dancers swirling around with a combination
of that much skill, enthusiasm and care for
their dance partners," Powers said.

M ■ liding across the floor, I hold on
I tightly as my partner leads the way.
I After several turns, claps, stomps
and bows, the music stops, and, to
my astonishment, the crowd
cheers. No matter how fleeting or sponta
neous the moment, I will always remember
the first time I danced the Bohemian Na
tional Polka.
I credit this experience to Cameron Scha
effer 'll, a social dance aficionado. The site
was Jammix, a Stanford event that features
social dancing once a month in Roble Gym.
Schaeffer assured me that newcomers are
encouraged to join even if they don't know
the dance.
"Unlike other ballroom venues, Jammix
is about having fun, pleasing your partner
and goofing off," Schaeffer said.
Students may be hesitant to initially at
tend Jammix, partly because of the high skill
level of many other social dancers.
"Upon entering the room, it can be pret
ty intimidating," said participant Rebekah
Oragwu 'l5, "but then people come up to
you and guide you as you stumble and laugh
during the rotary waltz, and suddenly it's just
fun."
The event draws participants from all
over campus and from all sectors of the

Stanford population from computer sci
entists to dance majors.
Stanford's enthusiasm for social dance
comes from the popular class Social Dances
of North America, taught by dance instruc
tor Richard Powers M.S. '7O. The typical
class enrollment ranges from 120 to 130 stu
dents each quarter.
"[Social dance at Stanford] all starts and
ends with Richard Powers, a vintage dance
instructor, ex-product designer and dance
historian who revived and taught social
dance when he joined the Stanford faculty in
1992," said participant Acata Felton 'l2.
The walls inside Powers' office are cov
ered with vintage posters depicting different
ballroom dances from across the world. Lit
tle figurines of dancers line the shelf. As a
graduate student at Stanford, Powers stud
ied the creative process in engineering, art
and philosophy. After he graduated, Powers
went into the field of engineering, from
which he received seven design and twenty
director awards.
His first foray into movement art was tai
chi, evolving from his study of Japanese and
Chinese calligraphy. He quickly discovered
his love of dancing with other people.
"At that time, I also loved history," Pow
ers said. "I took a historic dance workshop
on East Coast Renaissance and Baroque
dance and pushed into 19th-century rag
time-era social dance, which at the time was
a black sheep for the scholars."

Today Powers also offers courses on the
history of social dance that students describe
as fun, contemporary and engaging. His
choice to jump irom engineer to dance in
structor and historian stems from a desire
"to do the most good while doing the least
harm," he said.
According to Powers, the social dance
classes are not solely recreational, but also a
great stress reliever that offers students valu
able skills in ballroom dancing and life.
"A significant aspect of social dance is the
ability to adapt to new partners," Powers
said, remarking that making split-second de
cisions makes one not only a better dancer,
but also a better thinker.
Jammix is a space where students who
take Social Dances of North America can
practice, share steps they've picked up and
invent new ones. Attendees generally con
sist of current students and local alumni who
come back to campus just for the night.
Music is a key component of the Jammix
experience. While Powers, who acts as disc
jockey for the event, has a set playlist, he also
must read the energy of the crowd when se
lecting songs. He aims to choose music that
is "current, whimsical and danceable," fea
turing an eclectic mix of techno, Hindi pop,
K-pop, swing, Latin salsa and everything in
between. Visitors who walk into Roble Gym
during Jammix might be surprised to view a
roomful of couples swinging to Lady Gaga's
"Poker Face" or performing the cha-cha to

Marc Anthony.
In terms of dance styles, students usually
engage in the swing, waltz, tango, salsa, cha
cha and Irish line dances. When a song turns
on, Roble Gym freezes for a moment as
dancers feel the pulse of the music, and then
the room immediately erupts into move
ment. As the beat of some songs can be ap
plied to various dances, not all couples may
choose the same step, resulting in hazardous
situations: not infrequently, energetic
dancers who opt for the galloping polka may
collide with more stationary swingers.
Yet dancing is not the only attraction of
Jammix.
"I came for the dancing, I stayed for the
people," Felton said.
Along the sidelines of the dance floor, in
dividuals congregate to chat while taking a
break from the vigor of social dancing. Jam
mix and other dance events and classes have
created a unique sort of social dance com
munity on campus.
For Powers, as a dance historian, the
beauty of Jammix lies in the recreation of
scenes from paintings and lithographs at the
height of the 19th-century dance craze in
Paris.
"I was hit by the rush of 200 young
dancers swirling around with a combination
of that much skill, enthusiasm and care for
their dance partners," Powers said.
