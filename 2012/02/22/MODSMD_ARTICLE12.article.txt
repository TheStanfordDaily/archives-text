# Project Motivation instills hopes for higher education

### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
A Mission High School freshman
pushed his chair back and slow
ly stood up. After looking
around hesitantly, he said, "I
want to be a doctor one day.
How do you become a doctor?"
He was part of a group consisting of 50
ninth-grade teachers and their students, all
from immigrant or disadvantaged back
grounds. The group was gathered in a large
conference room in the Center for Educa
tional Research at Stanford (CERAS) for a
panel on higher education hosted by Proj
ect Motivation.
Project Motivation is an on-campus or
ganization founded in the 1970s that inter
acts and collaborates with minority high
school students in the Bay Area to encour
age the pursuit of higher education by mi
nority youth.
The Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram (STEP) co-hosted the event, which
featured a panel of eight undergraduate
and graduate students representing a range
of ethnicities, academic interests and expe
riences, but all sharing one common bond
all came from an immigrant or refugee
background.
The panelists provided advice and an
swered questions concerning both the col
lege application process and college life.
They especially focused on the need for stu
dents to pursue alternate forms of funding.
"Most of my friends did not go to college
because they did not have the money," re
marked one panelist. Yet had they known
about scholarships and financial aid, they
could have attended, he added.
"College will make you more conscious
of what is going on around the world," said
another panelist. "It will challenge you
mentally, intellectually and personally."

After the panel discussion, the students
split into smaller Spanish- and Mandarin
speaking groups with Stanford students, al
lowing for a more intimate setting.
Brian Waldman, a ninth-grade teacher
at Mission High School, praised the organ
ization and its efforts.
"Not every one of these students will go
to Stanford," Waldman said, "but it puts the
idea of college into their minds, and that's
the first step needed."
Thanh Nguyen 'l4, whose parents immi
grated to the United States from Vietnam,
is a volunteer at Project Motivation and
was a panelist during the event. He warned
the students of losing themselves in the col
lege process.
"Do what you love and be authentic,"
Nguyen said. "Too many students fall into
the trap of doing what they think colleges
want them to do."
According to Nguyen, the most chal
lenging aspect of his work is translating the
idea of college into terms the students can
understand, because it is often so markedly
different from the education systems to
which they are accustomed.
Ninth grader Jaz Lin, who recently im
migrated with her family from the province
of Guangdong in Southern China, echoed
this sentiment.
"Stanford is an amazing school, and
talking to these students makes me feel like
if they can do it, I can do it," Lin said. "But
it is difficult to understand the college
process and the system here."
While Project Motivation typically hosts
one to two tours and panel discussions per
week, the organization also holds a biannu
al event. Day with an Undergraduate,
which will take place on Feb. 21 and May 19
this year.
As part of this program, 40 to 60 middle
school students shadow Stanford under
graduates for a day in their classes, while

also attending tours, panels, motivational
speeches and performances. This year's
motivational speaker will be Michael Tubbs
'l2, a first-generation college student from
a disadvantaged background.
Projection Motivation is composed of 16
to 18 core members and 40 other partici
pants. It is led by co-presidents Kaela Far
rise 'l4 and Kennan Murphy-Sierra 'l4 and
has subdivisions including volunteer coor
dination, logistics and external relations.
"We want to take the students on a more
personal tour when we show them the cam
pus," Murphy-Sierra said. "It is not about
the history and facts, but showing them
what college is like."
Murphy-Sierra points to a need for a re
form in high school education.
"There are so many students who are
not aware of what college is or why they
should attend it," he said.
According to Murphy-Sierra, although
the organization does not have concrete
numbers on "success rates," teachers and
students he has worked with have repeat
edly contacted the group with positive
feedback.
In an email to the organization, Krista
Taylor, a high school counselor at the Bay

Area School of Enterprise, praised the or
ganization's events.
"In 2010,1 was able to bring a group of
my students to attend Stanford Undergrad
uate for a Day, and I found it to be one of
the most rewarding experiences for my stu
dents," Taylor wrote.
Besides the difficulty in measuring "suc
cess rates," Murphy-Sierra identified get
ting busy Stanford students to volunteer,
especially during the midterm season, as a
major challenge.
Looking to the future, Project Motiva
tion is considering a one-on-one mentoring
program to offer more personalized atten
tion and guidance to the participating stu
dents. The group also hopes to encourage
more Stanford students to volunteer their
time to give back.
"College has opened a lot of possibilities
I never thought were available," Nguyen
said, reflecting on his experience with the
group. "When you come to Stanford you
create yourself, and nobody tells you who
you are, and it's very liberating. I want the
same thing for these students too."
