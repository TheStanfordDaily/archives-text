## POWERING PAST PACIFIC 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
When the going gets tough,
Ail-Americans show up. Stan
ford baseball team on Tuesday
got a massive llth-inning home
run from junior third baseman
Stephen Piscotty to nab a 9-7 win
over the Pacific Tigers.
The No. 2 Cardinal (4-0) of
fense scored more than eight

runs for the fourth consecutive
game, but the Stanford pitching
wasn't sharp enough to notch its
fourth straight blowout win of
the year over the feisty Tigers (0-
4).
The Cardinal got off to a poor
start when senior starter Elliot
Byers gave up four runs in the
bottom of the second inning. The
righthander gave up a walk, a wild
pitch, a single, two doubles and a

hit batter in a disastrous start and
was quickly replaced by junior
Dean McArdle.
McArdle then held the Tigers
silent for 3 2/3 innings while the
Cardinal rallied to take the lead.
After junior left fielder Tyler
Gaffney singled home catcher
Eric Smith for the Cardinal's first
run of the day in the third inning,
Stanford exploded for four runs
in the top of the fifth to take the

lead for the first time.
First, Gaffney tallied his sec
ond RBI of the day by singling
home right fielder Austin Wilson,
only to be followed by another
RBI single from Piscotty. After a
balk brought home Gaffney for
the Cardinal's fourth run of the
day, Piscotty came home on a
Brian Ragira groundout to make
it 5-4.
Stanford extended its lead by
adding two more runs in the next
two innings, first getting a sacri
fice fly from Wilson that brought
home designated hitter Christian
Griffiths in the sixth inning, then
a Ragira single that brought
home Gaffney to make it 7-4.
The Tigers didn't fade away
once the Cardinal got ahead,
though, as they rallied with two
runs of their own in the next two
innings. Right fielder Allen Riley
cut the Stanford lead to 7-5 with
a solo home run to right field off
junior reliever Sahil Bloom, and
the Tigers added another run in
the bottom of the eighth.
The Cardinal went into the
ninth inning nursing just a one
run lead; a particularly unexpect
ed event after Stanford blew
away Vanderbilt in all three
games last weekend.
Freshman reliever David
Schmidt was tasked with bring
ing home the win for the Cardi
nal, but he couldn't slam the door
shut on the Tigers and cap off a
Cardinal win in regulation.
Schmidt allowed a leadoff single
to Riley who advanced to second
on a wild pitch, then charged
home when sophomore desig
nated hitter John Haberman sin
gled to center field. After two
strikeouts and a failed stolen
base attempt ended the inning,

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Junior left fielder Tyler Gaffney had three hits on Tuesday, but fellow junior Stephen Piscotty was the hero of
the night, clobbering a two-run homer in extra innings to give the Cardinal a 9-7 win over Pacific. No. 2
Stanford remains undefeated as it prepares to take on No. 12 Texas at home.
