## Cardinal cruises in first match at No. 1 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team con
tinued its undefeated streak to begin the 2012
season by defeating No. 36 St. Mary's, 6-1.
This match came after a nine-day break from
competition and was the No 1. Cardinal's (5-
0,1-0 Pac-12) first match since ascending to
the nation's top ranking.
Saint Mary's (3-3) entered Tuesday's
match with a winning record, including an im
pressive upset of then-No. 25 Oklahoma. Its

only two losses of the season had come
against No. 4 UCLA and No. 16 USC, al
though both matches were blowouts.
Stanford's No. 1 player, sophomore Nicole
Gibbs, came off a loss last week against Flori
da to lead the lineup with a 6-3,6-0 win over
Catherine Isip. After taking some time to ad
just to a new racket, Gibbs hit her stride in the
first set before running away with the second
set.
"I'm playing with a new racket, and work
ing my way into matches has been a slightly
slower process because of that," Gibbs ex

plained. "But it pays a big dividend once I'm
in my comfort zone. That's what you saw
today. I started playing really well after I had
made a few adjustments."
As the team solidifies its lineup, Gibbs has
a firm grasp on the top spot and has been
using strong performances there to build her
confidence.
"It's an honor to be playing at the top of
the lineup or playing anywhere on the Stan
ford lineup," Gibbs said. "I'm just looking
forward to doing the best job with
my position that I'm capable of. It
was good to get back on the court
after my individual loss at Flori
da, too, and regain the confidence
I'm going to be building on for the
rest of the season."
Freshman Ellen Tsay put in
the day's best performance,
steamrolling her opponent 6-0,6-
0. Her recent play has continued
to prove that she is a valuable ad
dition to a Stanford squad that
took only one recruit for the Class
of 2015.
"It really feels great because I
didn't lose a single game," Tsay
said.
"At the end, my opponent
shook my hand and joked, 'Can't
you just give me a game?"' she
added. "I had played [Gael sopho
more Jade Frampton] in singles
once before, so I knew what she
was like. I was really relaxed today,
was aggressive and everything
went the way I had planned."
Just five matches into the sea
son, Tsay's entrance to the team
has been smooth, aided by rela
tionships that she developed with
her teammates prior to joining
the squad and by practicing
amongst an accomplished group
of players.
"Coming into Stanford, I was
just really excited because I
would be able to practice with a

group of really strong players on a
regular basis, and basically all my
expectations have been fulfilled,"
Tsay said. "I've improved a lot
since I came to Stanford as far as
being aggressive and hitting the
ball harder goes."
Sophomore Kristie Ahn
showed continued improvement,
still adjusting to match-level play
in her return from injury. She and
her partner, senior Veronica Li,
secured a dominant 8-2 doubles
match before Ahn, playing at the
third spot inside the stadium,
earned a 6-3, 6-4 singles victory
over Anna Chkhikvishvili.
"It's just always a pleasure to
play in the stadium, and no doubt
Saint Mary's is a good team," Ahn
said. "It was a really good test for
me as well as the rest of the team.
The stadium is always great be
cause the competition is better,
but I think it makes me want it
that much more."
Other match scores included
an impressive 6-3, 6-4 win by Li
and a close 6-4,7-5 win by junior
Stacey Tan. Stanford's sole loss
came at the No. 6 spot, where
sophomore Amelia Herring lost
6-1, 6-2 to Carla Lindlar. In dou
bles, Stanford's No. 1 team of
Mallory Burdette and Gibbs won
8-4, and the No. 2 team of Tan and
Tsay won 8-4.
The Cardinal next returns to
the courts on Friday, when it wel
comes Cal Poly to Taube Family
Tennis Center at 2 p.m.
