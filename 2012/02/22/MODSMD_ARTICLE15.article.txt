# WOMEN'S SWIMMING
## Chasing the first Pac-12 Championship CARDINAL LOOKING TO UNSEAT NO. 1 CAL 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's swimming and div
ing team is set to compete in the inaugural
Pac-12 championships at the King County
Aquatic Center in Federal Way, Wash., start
ing this Wednesday. The four-day conference
championship will be the Cardinal's second
most important meet of the year, behind only
the NCAA championships that will take place
in March.
Recent conference history seems to be on
Stanford's side, as the Cardinal has won the
past two Pac-10 championships. In 2011, Stan
ford trailed Cal by over 50 points with one
more day of competition left, but the Card
managed to storm back and edge out the
Golden Bears by 22 points. Two years ago, the
Cardinal's margin of victory was much larger,
as it finished ahead of Cal by over 100 points.
Once again, the biggest competition for
No. 8 Stanford (9-1,6-0 Pac-12) will most like
ly be No. 1 Cal (7-1,7-1 Pac-12). Despite Cal's
higher ranking and status as the top-ranked
team in the nation, it's important to note that
the official polls have not been updated since
late January. Much has changed since then,
most importantly the Cardinal's dual-meet
win over the Golden Bears in early February.
Stanford will be bringing a host of veterans
to the meet. Leading the way is senior Sam
Woodward, who has the fastest 100-meter but
terfly time in the Pac-12, as well as the second
fastest time in the nation. Sophomore team
mate Felicia Lee follows closely behind as the
third-fastest seed in the event. If Lee can edge
out second-seeded Lauren Smart from Ari
zona, a Cardinal 1-2 punch would certainly
boost Stanford's momentum.
At last year's Pac-10 Championships,
Woodward and Lee finished
sixth and seventh, respectively, in
the 100 butterfly, but both of
their times during this regular
dual-meet season have already
been faster than their postseason
performances last season.
Despite being just a sopho
more, Maya DiRado will also be
a major contender at the confer
ence championship. Backstroke
specialist DiRado has the fastest
time in the nation in the 200
backstroke. Just as impressive is
the fact that no other Pac-12
swimmer is within eight-tenths of
a second of DiRado's time this
season.
The versatile Cardinal swim
mers will also be competing in
the 200 and 400 individual med
leys. In these events, the competi
tion will be much tougher, as the
conference is especially strong in
the medley. Three of the coun
try's four fastest times in the 200

individual medley and the three
fastest times in the 400 individual
medley come from Pac-12 swim
mers.
Dißado is ranked second in
the Pac-12 in the 200 individual
medley and third in the 400, and
will have to square off against
USC's Katinka Hosszu, the
fastest swimmer in both events.
The Trojan senior may arguably
be the best swimmer in the
country, as she looks to defend
her three conference and na
tional titles this postseason.
Hosszu was so dominant last
year that she was nominated for
ESPN's ESPY Award for Best
Female College Athlete. Going
into the conference champi
onship, Hosszu is the top seed in
four individual events. Cal jun
ior Caitlin Leverenz, seeded
third in the 200 individual med
ley and second in the 400, will
also be in contention for the
conference titles in the two
events.
In its bid to win its third con
secutive conference title, Stan
ford will look to claim as many
relay titles as possible. The Car

dinal's safest bet is probably the
200 freestyle relay an event
in which the team has the fastest
time in the country. In the other
four relay events that will be
contested, Stanford is seeded
second in two of them and
fourth and fifth in the other two.
On the diving board, sopho
more Stephanie Phipps will be
the top diver for the Cardinal.
Despite finishing fourth in the 3-
meter springboard event at last
year's Pac-10 Championships,
Phipps managed to cap off an
impressive postseason cam
paign by qualifying for NCAAs
at the Zone Diving Regional
and earning All-American hon
ors. Phipps hopes to build off
last year's success and possibly
come away with a Pac-12 title on
the springboard.
The 2012 Pac-12 Champi
onships at the King County
Aquatic Center in Federal Way,
Wash., will splash off at 6 p.m.
this Wednesday and conclude on
Saturday.

ly be No. 1 Cal (7-1,7-1 Pac-12). Despite Cal's
higher ranking and status as the top-ranked
team in the nation, it's important to note that
the official polls have not been updated since
late January. Much has changed since then,
most importantly the Cardinal's dual-meet
win over the Golden Bears in early February.
Stanford will be bringing a host of veterans
to the meet. Leading the way is senior Sam
Woodward, who has the fastest 100-meter but
terfly time in the Pac-12, as well as the second
fastest time in the nation. Sophomore team
mate Felicia Lee follows closely behind as the
third-fastest seed in the event. If Lee can edge
out second-seeded Lauren Smart from Ari
zona, a Cardinal 1-2 punch would certainly
boost Stanford's momentum.
At last year's Pac-10 Championships,
Woodward and Lee finished
sixth and seventh, respectively, in
the 100 butterfly, but both of
their times during this regular
dual-meet season have already
been faster than their postseason
performances last season.
Despite being just a sopho
more, Maya DiRado will also be
a major contender at the confer
ence championship. Backstroke
specialist DiRado has the fastest
time in the nation in the 200
backstroke. Just as impressive is
the fact that no other Pac-12
swimmer is within eight-tenths of
a second of DiRado's time this
season.
The versatile Cardinal swim
mers will also be competing in
the 200 and 400 individual med
leys. In these events, the competi
tion will be much tougher, as the
conference is especially strong in
the medley. Three of the coun
try's four fastest times in the 200

individual medley and the three
fastest times in the 400 individual
medley come from Pac-12 swim
mers.
Dißado is ranked second in
the Pac-12 in the 200 individual
medley and third in the 400, and
will have to square off against
USC's Katinka Hosszu, the
fastest swimmer in both events.
The Trojan senior may arguably
be the best swimmer in the
country, as she looks to defend
her three conference and na
tional titles this postseason.
Hosszu was so dominant last
year that she was nominated for
ESPN's ESPY Award for Best
Female College Athlete. Going
into the conference champi
onship, Hosszu is the top seed in
four individual events. Cal jun
ior Caitlin Leverenz, seeded
third in the 200 individual med
ley and second in the 400, will
also be in contention for the
conference titles in the two
events.
In its bid to win its third con
secutive conference title, Stan
ford will look to claim as many
relay titles as possible. The Car

dinal's safest bet is probably the
200 freestyle relay an event
in which the team has the fastest
time in the country. In the other
four relay events that will be
contested, Stanford is seeded
second in two of them and
fourth and fifth in the other two.
On the diving board, sopho
more Stephanie Phipps will be
the top diver for the Cardinal.
Despite finishing fourth in the 3-
meter springboard event at last
year's Pac-10 Championships,
Phipps managed to cap off an
impressive postseason cam
paign by qualifying for NCAAs
at the Zone Diving Regional
and earning All-American hon
ors. Phipps hopes to build off
last year's success and possibly
come away with a Pac-12 title on
the springboard.
The 2012 Pac-12 Champi
onships at the King County
Aquatic Center in Federal Way,
Wash., will splash off at 6 p.m.
this Wednesday and conclude on
Saturday.

The No. 8 Cardinal will travel to Washington today to compete for the inaugural Pac-12 women's swimming
and diving championships. Its toughest competition will be No. 1 Cal, defeated by the Card earlier this season.
The Stanford women's swimming and div
ing team is set to compete in the inaugural
Pac-12 championships at the King County
Aquatic Center in Federal Way, Wash., start
ing this Wednesday. The four-day conference
championship will be the Cardinal's second
most important meet of the year, behind only
the NCAA championships that will take place
in March.
Recent conference history seems to be on
Stanford's side, as the Cardinal has won the
past two Pac-10 championships. In 2011, Stan
ford trailed Cal by over 50 points with one
more day of competition left, but the Card
managed to storm back and edge out the
Golden Bears by 22 points. Two years ago, the
Cardinal's margin of victory was much larger,
as it finished ahead of Cal by over 100 points.
Once again, the biggest competition for
No. 8 Stanford (9-1,6-0 Pac-12) will most like
ly be No. 1 Cal (7-1,7-1 Pac-12). Despite Cal's
higher ranking and status as the top-ranked
team in the nation, it's important to note that
the official polls have not been updated since
