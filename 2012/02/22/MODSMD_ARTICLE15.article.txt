## Chasing the first Pac-12 Championship CARDINAL LOOKING TO UNSEAT NO. 1 CAL 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's swimming and div
ing team is set to compete in the inaugural
Pac-12 championships at the King County
Aquatic Center in Federal Way, Wash., start
ing this Wednesday. The four-day conference
championship will be the Cardinal's second
most important meet of the year, behind only
the NCAA championships that will take place
in March.
Recent conference history seems to be on
Stanford's side, as the Cardinal has won the
past two Pac-10 championships. In 2011, Stan
ford trailed Cal by over 50 points with one
more day of competition left, but the Card
managed to storm back and edge out the
Golden Bears by 22 points. Two years ago, the
Cardinal's margin of victory was much larger,
as it finished ahead of Cal by over 100 points.
Once again, the biggest competition for
No. 8 Stanford (9-1,6-0 Pac-12) will most like
ly be No. 1 Cal (7-1,7-1 Pac-12). Despite Cal's
higher ranking and status as the top-ranked
team in the nation, it's important to note that
the official polls have not been updated since
late January. Much has changed since then,
most importantly the Cardinal's dual-meet
win over the Golden Bears in early February.
Stanford will be bringing a host of veterans
to the meet. Leading the way is senior Sam
Woodward, who has the fastest 100-meter but
terfly time in the Pac-12, as well as the second
fastest time in the nation. Sophomore team
mate Felicia Lee follows closely behind as the
third-fastest seed in the event. If Lee can edge
out second-seeded Lauren Smart from Ari
zona, a Cardinal 1-2 punch would certainly
boost Stanford's momentum.
