# Numbers offer hope for Omaha
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
This year, the pressure is
really on the Stanford
baseball team. For the
first time in 10 years, the
Cardinal is in the top
three of all the major polls, and this
season will not be a success unless
Stanford gets to Omaha. How do
you play with those expectations
weighing on you?
Quite well, thank you very much.
Here's a look at just how dominant
Stanford was this weekend:
10: Let's start off with a reminder
that Vanderbilt came into the series
as the No. 10 team in the country,
which isn't surprising considering
that the Commodores were in the
College World Series last season.
17: After just three games at
Sunken Diamond, Vanderbilt
dropped seven spots to No. 17. That
tumble was the second-biggest in
the country, behind only the eight
place drop by UCLA, who lost two
of three home games to unranked
Maryland.
8: On to the actual games. The
Cardinal scored at least eight runs in
each of the first three games of the
season. Last year, Stanford only
managed to score eight runs in two
consecutive games twice.
18: In the first two games, Stan
ford's offense was explosive, scoring
17 runs in its first 13 innings at the
plate while running away from Van
derbilt in each game. Eight of the
nine Cardinal regulars had at least
one hit, run and RBI in the first two
games, showing the incredible po
tential of this lineup. But that was
just an appetizer for Sunday.
A team's chances of winning a
game that it trails 4-0 in the second
aren't great. Its chances of winning
are even lower when its starter is al
ready knocked out of the game, and
when the opponent is a top-10 team
The chances of winning that
same game by 13 runs? You might as
well bet on the Generals to take
down the Globetrotters.
Unless, of course, you have Stan
ford's offense. The Cardinal reeled
off 18 unanswered runs to blow the


Commodores out of the water and
end its opening weekend with a
bang.
Consider this: last season (when,
I should point out, Stanford did
reach the Super Regionals) the Car
dinal had 13 weekend series, each
lasting three games. Only twice did
Stanford score 18 runs in an entire
series, and both came against the
two worst teams in the Pac-10. Sun
day, it took just seven innings
against a top-10 opponent from the
nation's best conference for the
Cardinal to put up 18 runs.
7: With all these runs on the
board, it comes as no surprise that
several players stood out for the
Cardinal. In his first seven at-bats,
first baseman Brian Ragira had six
hits, and he finished the weekend
with seven hits. Vanderbilt had only
two players with more than two hits
for the series.

Third baseman Stephen Piscotty
was the slugger many people pre
dicted he could be, as he knocked in
seven runs on Sunday alone. He hit
a home run in his first at-bat of the
season and a grand slam on Sunday,
putting him two-thirds of the way to
his entire 2011 homer total of three.
His three extra-base hits have
helped him accrue an otherworldly
.786 slugging percentage. Somehow,
that isn't even the best on the team
though.
5: That distinction belongs to
designated hitter Christian Grif
fiths, who missed all of 2011 with an
injury. Despite hitting at the bottom
of the lineup, he managed to slug
.909 thanks to a home run and a pair
of doubles. Griffiths had five RBI in
his 11 at-bats this weekend, almost
eclipsing his career total of six RBI
in 65 at-bats coming in.
.500: Speaking of slugging per
centage, five of the nine regulars are
slugging at least .500. Last year, the
Cardinal's leader was left fielder
Tyler Gaffney at .472. Likewise,
Stanford has five regulars with an
on-base percentage of at least .500,

which is well above Piscotty's team
leading .423 from 2011.
6.1: With all this hitting, you'd
have to be crazy to say that the most
impressive performance was on the
mound. Luckily, I'm crazy. And
more importantly, John Hochstat
ter was terrific.

Who, you ask? Hochstatter, a
freshman lefty, came on in relief of
AJ. Vanegas on Sunday with the
Cardinal trailing 4-0. All he did was
throw 6.1 scoreless innings to pick
up the win. And oh by the way, he
got those 19 outs without allowing a
hit. So while the Cardinal batters
were piling up all those runs, the
Commodores were going quietly
against Hochstatter.
Hochstatter wasn't the only Stan
ford pitcher to have an impressive
outing over the weekend. Friday
starter Mark Appel looked every bit
the No. 1 pick many expect him to be
in the upcoming MLB Draft, throw
ing seven innings of two-hit ball to
lead the Cardinal to the easy opening
win. Saturday starter Brett Mooney
ham, pitching for the first time since
2010, also looked to be on top of his
game, allowing just three runs
through six innings to help Stanford
cruise on Saturday as well. If the
pitching continues to be solid, it'll
continue to be tough to match the
Cardinal's hitting.
12: Stanford doesn't have long to
pat itself on the back, as No. 12Texas
comes to town this weekend, fol
lowing a midweek game on Tuesday
at Pacific. The Longhorns took two
of three from the Cardinal last year
in Austin and could pose a greater
threat than Vanderbilt. Of course,
Stanford poses quite a threat itself.
2: Somehow, despite winning in
such convincing fashion (outscoring
any team 35-13 is impressive, let
alone the No. 10 team in the coun
try) while No. 1 Florida lost one of
its three games to then-No. 25 Cal
State-Fullerton, Stanford did not
move up in any poll, so it'll have to
settle for No. 2.
For now.

Jacob Jaffe thinks even he could
pick up a win on the mound with
Stanford's offense backing him up.

as the No. 10 team in the country,
which isn't surprising considering
that the Commodores were in the

17: After just three games at
Sunken Diamond, Vanderbilt
dropped seven spots to No. 17. That
tumble was the second-biggest in
the country, behind only the eight
place drop by UCLA, who lost two
of three home games to unranked
Maryland.
8: On to the actual games. The
Cardinal scored at least eight runs in
each of the first three games of the
season. Last year, Stanford only
managed to score eight runs in two
consecutive games twice.
18: In the first two games, Stan
ford's offense was explosive, scoring
17 runs in its first 13 innings at the
plate while running away from Van
derbilt in each game. Eight of the
nine Cardinal regulars had at least
one hit, run and RBI in the first two
games, showing the incredible po

Unless, of course, you have Stan

Commodores out of the water and
end its opening weekend with a

Consider this: last season (when,
I should point out, Stanford did
reach the Super Regionals) the Car
dinal had 13 weekend series, each
lasting three games. Only twice did
Stanford score 18 runs in an entire
series, and both came against the
two worst teams in the Pac-10. Sun
day, it took just seven innings
against a top-10 opponent from the
nation's best conference for the
Cardinal to put up 18 runs.
7: With all these runs on the
board, it comes as no surprise that
several players stood out for the
Cardinal. In his first seven at-bats,
first baseman Brian Ragira had six
hits, and he finished the weekend
with seven hits. Vanderbilt had only

seven runs on Sunday alone. He hit
a home run in his first at-bat of the
season and a grand slam on Sunday,
putting him two-thirds of the way to
his entire 2011 homer total of three.
His three extra-base hits have
helped him accrue an otherworldly
.786 slugging percentage. Somehow,
that isn't even the best on the team
though.
5: That distinction belongs to
designated hitter Christian Grif
fiths, who missed all of 2011 with an
injury. Despite hitting at the bottom
of the lineup, he managed to slug
.909 thanks to a home run and a pair
of doubles. Griffiths had five RBI in
his 11 at-bats this weekend, almost
eclipsing his career total of six RBI
in 65 at-bats coming in.
.500: Speaking of slugging per
centage, five of the nine regulars are
slugging at least .500. Last year, the
Cardinal's leader was left fielder
Tyler Gaffney at .472. Likewise,
Stanford has five regulars with an
on-base percentage of at least .500,

which is well above Piscotty's team
leading .423 from 2011.
6.1: With all this hitting, you'd
have to be crazy to say that the most
impressive performance was on the
mound. Luckily, I'm crazy. And
more importantly, John Hochstat
ter was terrific.

Who, you ask? Hochstatter, a
freshman lefty, came on in relief of
AJ. Vanegas on Sunday with the
Cardinal trailing 4-0. All he did was
throw 6.1 scoreless innings to pick
up the win. And oh by the way, he
got those 19 outs without allowing a
hit. So while the Cardinal batters
were piling up all those runs, the
Commodores were going quietly
against Hochstatter.
Hochstatter wasn't the only Stan
ford pitcher to have an impressive
outing over the weekend. Friday
starter Mark Appel looked every bit
the No. 1 pick many expect him to be
in the upcoming MLB Draft, throw
ing seven innings of two-hit ball to
lead the Cardinal to the easy opening
win. Saturday starter Brett Mooney
ham, pitching for the first time since
2010, also looked to be on top of his
game, allowing just three runs
through six innings to help Stanford
cruise on Saturday as well. If the
pitching continues to be solid, it'll
continue to be tough to match the
Cardinal's hitting.
12: Stanford doesn't have long to
pat itself on the back, as No. 12Texas
comes to town this weekend, fol
lowing a midweek game on Tuesday
at Pacific. The Longhorns took two
of three from the Cardinal last year
in Austin and could pose a greater
threat than Vanderbilt. Of course,
Stanford poses quite a threat itself.
2: Somehow, despite winning in
such convincing fashion (outscoring
any team 35-13 is impressive, let
alone the No. 10 team in the coun
try) while No. 1 Florida lost one of
its three games to then-No. 25 Cal
State-Fullerton, Stanford did not
move up in any poll, so it'll have to
settle for No. 2.
For now.

Jacob Jaffe thinks even he could
pick up a win on the mound with
Stanford's offense backing him up.

This year, the pressure is
really on the Stanford
baseball team. For the
first time in 10 years, the
Cardinal is in the top
three of all the major polls, and this
season will not be a success unless
Stanford gets to Omaha. How do
you play with those expectations
weighing on you?
Quite well, thank you very much.
Here's a look at just how dominant
Stanford was this weekend:
10: Let's start off with a reminder
that Vanderbilt came into the series
as the No. 10 team in the country,
which isn't surprising considering
that the Commodores were in the
College World Series last season.
17: After just three games at
Sunken Diamond, Vanderbilt
dropped seven spots to No. 17. That
tumble was the second-biggest in
the country, behind only the eight
place drop by UCLA, who lost two
of three home games to unranked
Maryland.
8: On to the actual games. The
Cardinal scored at least eight runs in
each of the first three games of the
season. Last year, Stanford only
managed to score eight runs in two
consecutive games twice.
18: In the first two games, Stan
ford's offense was explosive, scoring
17 runs in its first 13 innings at the
plate while running away from Van
derbilt in each game. Eight of the
nine Cardinal regulars had at least
one hit, run and RBI in the first two
games, showing the incredible po
tential of this lineup. But that was
just an appetizer for Sunday.
A team's chances of winning a
game that it trails 4-0 in the second
aren't great. Its chances of winning
are even lower when its starter is al
ready knocked out of the game, and
when the opponent is a top-10 team
The chances of winning that
same game by 13 runs? You might as
well bet on the Generals to take
down the Globetrotters.
Unless, of course, you have Stan
ford's offense. The Cardinal reeled
off 18 unanswered runs to blow the


Commodores out of the water and
end its opening weekend with a
bang.
Consider this: last season (when,
I should point out, Stanford did
reach the Super Regionals) the Car
dinal had 13 weekend series, each
lasting three games. Only twice did
Stanford score 18 runs in an entire
series, and both came against the
two worst teams in the Pac-10. Sun
day, it took just seven innings
against a top-10 opponent from the
nation's best conference for the
Cardinal to put up 18 runs.
7: With all these runs on the
board, it comes as no surprise that
several players stood out for the
Cardinal. In his first seven at-bats,
first baseman Brian Ragira had six
hits, and he finished the weekend
with seven hits. Vanderbilt had only
two players with more than two hits
for the series.

Third baseman Stephen Piscotty
was the slugger many people pre
dicted he could be, as he knocked in
seven runs on Sunday alone. He hit
a home run in his first at-bat of the
season and a grand slam on Sunday,
putting him two-thirds of the way to
his entire 2011 homer total of three.
His three extra-base hits have
helped him accrue an otherworldly
.786 slugging percentage. Somehow,
that isn't even the best on the team
though.
5: That distinction belongs to
designated hitter Christian Grif
fiths, who missed all of 2011 with an
injury. Despite hitting at the bottom
of the lineup, he managed to slug
.909 thanks to a home run and a pair
of doubles. Griffiths had five RBI in
his 11 at-bats this weekend, almost
eclipsing his career total of six RBI
in 65 at-bats coming in.
.500: Speaking of slugging per
centage, five of the nine regulars are
slugging at least .500. Last year, the
Cardinal's leader was left fielder
Tyler Gaffney at .472. Likewise,
Stanford has five regulars with an
on-base percentage of at least .500,

which is well above Piscotty's team
leading .423 from 2011.
6.1: With all this hitting, you'd
have to be crazy to say that the most
impressive performance was on the
mound. Luckily, I'm crazy. And
more importantly, John Hochstat
ter was terrific.

Who, you ask? Hochstatter, a
freshman lefty, came on in relief of
AJ. Vanegas on Sunday with the
Cardinal trailing 4-0. All he did was
throw 6.1 scoreless innings to pick
up the win. And oh by the way, he
got those 19 outs without allowing a
hit. So while the Cardinal batters
were piling up all those runs, the
Commodores were going quietly
against Hochstatter.

ford pitcher to have an impressive
