# Numbers offer hope for Omaha

### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
This year, the pressure is
really on the Stanford
baseball team. For the
first time in 10 years, the
Cardinal is in the top
three of all the major polls, and this
season will not be a success unless
Stanford gets to Omaha. How do
you play with those expectations
weighing on you?
Quite well, thank you very much.
Here's a look at just how dominant
Stanford was this weekend:
10: Let's start off with a reminder
that Vanderbilt came into the series
as the No. 10 team in the country,
which isn't surprising considering
that the Commodores were in the
College World Series last season.
17: After just three games at
Sunken Diamond, Vanderbilt
dropped seven spots to No. 17. That
tumble was the second-biggest in
the country, behind only the eight
place drop by UCLA, who lost two
of three home games to unranked
Maryland.
8: On to the actual games. The
Cardinal scored at least eight runs in
each of the first three games of the
season. Last year, Stanford only
managed to score eight runs in two
consecutive games twice.
18: In the first two games, Stan
ford's offense was explosive, scoring
17 runs in its first 13 innings at the
plate while running away from Van
derbilt in each game. Eight of the
nine Cardinal regulars had at least
one hit, run and RBI in the first two
games, showing the incredible po
tential of this lineup. But that was
just an appetizer for Sunday.
A team's chances of winning a
game that it trails 4-0 in the second
aren't great. Its chances of winning
are even lower when its starter is al
ready knocked out of the game, and
when the opponent is a top-10 team
The chances of winning that
same game by 13 runs? You might as
well bet on the Generals to take
down the Globetrotters.
Unless, of course, you have Stan
ford's offense. The Cardinal reeled
off 18 unanswered runs to blow the
