# GYMNASTS FACE MIXED RESULTS
## WOMEN WIN, MEN LOSE SECOND STRAIGHT MEET 
### CONNOR SCHERER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's and
women's gymnastics teams both
took to the mats this weekend, with
the men at home, squaring off
against rival California and the
Japanese Collegiate All-Stars, and
the women in Texas, facing Brown
and the University of Bridgeport.
The women won their second meet
in a row and recorded multiple
team- and personal-best scores,
while the men's team continued to
struggle, finishing third.
The No. 12 women's team
looked to continue its recent mo
mentum as it traveled to Texas for
its meet with the University of
Bridgeport (8-4) and Brown (2-6)
last Saturday. TTie Cardinal (7-2)
ran away with the Metroplex Chal
lenge victory, scoring a total of
196.375, the team's second-best
score of the season, followed by
Bridgeport (193.600) and Brown
(191.725).
The meet was the fourth of five
straight road competitions for the
Cardinal. Despite experiencing
struggles away from home earlier
in the season, head coach Kristen
Smyth said that the team has im
proved with each meet and "has
really come together as a group."
She explained that the team's
strategy for the season was to start
slower in order to protect the ath
letes from injuries and to gear up
for the playoffs (the Pac-12 tourna
ment occurs in late march, and the
NCAA championships are in
April). Saturday's meet, however,
was far from slow, with strong indi
vidual performances in a variety of
events allowing the Cardinal to
coast to victory.

Junior Ashley Morgan won two
events for the Stanford team, which
won three of the four events on the
afternoon. She scored a 9.875 to
win the uneven bars event, but was
even more impressive on the floor
exercise, scoring a season-best
9.925 to earn a tie for victory in the
event. Morgan struggled on the
balance beam, putting up her sea
son-worst performance with an
8.675, but still finished second in
the all-around competition.
Matching Morgan's floor exer
cise score was senior Nicole
Pechanec, whose 9.925 was also a
season-best. Prior to Saturday's
meet, the Cardinal had posted just
two 9.925 scores on the whole sea
son in any event Pechanec on
uneven bars against Cal and senior
Alyssa Brown on beam against
Oregon State but the squad put
up three 9.925s in Saturday's com
petition alone.
Sophomores Shona Morgan, a
2008 Olympian, and Amanda Spin
ner also had career days. Shona
Morgan tied with Pechanec and
Ashley Morgan for the leading
score of the day, a career-best 9.925
to win the beam event. Spinner also
scored a personal best on the beam,
with a 9.800 in only her second col
legiate performance.
Saturday's meet was a day of
new benchmarks, as the Cardinal
was ultimately able to rack up two
career-best and five season-best
scores (one of these tied a previous
season best) by the end of the com
petition. The strong individual per
formances combined to help Stan
ford score season-best team scores
on both floor exercise (49.275) and
beam (49.175).

to win the floor exercise, and Shona Morgan earned a
9.925 in the beam.
The Cardinal looks to extend its
current win streak as the team
takes on top-ranked Utah this Fri
day. While Utah is one of the na
tion's powerhouse gymnastics
teams, Smyth feels good about her
team's chances, noting that the
Card "has a lot of momentum and
[its] confidence is growing." Last
season, Stanford took down the
then-No. 4 Utes in a thrilling meet,
ending Utah's streak of 20 straight
regular-season home victories.
Stanford will look for a similar
result this year as it faces the Utes
on Feb. 24 at 6 p.m. in Salt Lake
City, Utah.
A shorthanded Stanford men's
gymnastics team faced Cal for the
fifth time in five meets to open the
2012 season. Coming into Satur
day's meet, the series was tied at 2-
2, with the Golden Bears winning
the first and fourth meetings and
the Cardinal taking the second
and third, and both squads look
ing to emerge with a victory in the
fifth and final matchup of the sea
son. While rival Cal was a main
priority for Stanford, the team
also faced the Japanese Collegiate
All-Stars, the Card's first and only
international opponent of the sea
son.
The Japanese All-Stars estab
lished their dominance early on in
the competition, but Stanford and
Cal stayed neck and neck for the
entire meet. Ultimately, the last
event decided the final outcome for

the afternoon, with Cal outlasting
Stanford 344.900-343.600, while
the Japanese All-Stars put up a
354.700 to easily take first place.
Junior Eddie Penev, who was
named NCAA Player of the Week
earlier in the season, took the meet
off to rest, as he had competed in
every single event in each meet
leading up to Saturday. The team
was also missing freshman Brian
Knott, who recently underwent
surgery for a torn bicep. Without
Penev and Knott, the team had no
gymnast compete in the all-around
competition. However, despite its
lack of manpower, the Cardinal
nearly matched its score from last
week, when team-leading Penev
was competing.
Freshman Sean Senters was
crucial in making up for the team's
lost gymnasts, as he set season-high
scores in both floor (14.900) and
vault (15.500), with his vault result
tying Penev's for the nation's best
vault score this season.
The Cardinal also captured the
individual title in the pommel
horse, with junior John Martin fin
ishing first with a 15.300 and junior
Gabriel Alvarado taking second
with a career-best 15.200.
The Cardinal trailed the Bears
by 0.700 points going into the final
round, but Cal was able to pull
away on the high bar to win the
event and seal the season-series
victory in the teams' last regular
season meeting.
Stanford next takes on Michi
gan at home on Sunday at 2 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.

day. While Utah is one of the na
tion's powerhouse gymnastics
teams, Smyth feels good about her
team's chances, noting that the
Card "has a lot of momentum and
[its] confidence is growing." Last
season, Stanford took down the
then-No. 4 Utes in a thrilling meet,
ending Utah's streak of 20 straight
regular-season home victories.
Stanford will look for a similar
result this year as it faces the Utes
on Feb. 24 at 6 p.m. in Salt Lake
City, Utah.
A shorthanded Stanford men's
gymnastics team faced Cal for the
fifth time in five meets to open the
2012 season. Coming into Satur
day's meet, the series was tied at 2-
2, with the Golden Bears winning
the first and fourth meetings and
the Cardinal taking the second
and third, and both squads look
ing to emerge with a victory in the
fifth and final matchup of the sea
son. While rival Cal was a main
priority for Stanford, the team
also faced the Japanese Collegiate
All-Stars, the Card's first and only
international opponent of the sea
son.
The Japanese All-Stars estab
lished their dominance early on in
the competition, but Stanford and
Cal stayed neck and neck for the
entire meet. Ultimately, the last
event decided the final outcome for

the afternoon, with Cal outlasting
Stanford 344.900-343.600, while
the Japanese All-Stars put up a
354.700 to easily take first place.
Junior Eddie Penev, who was
named NCAA Player of the Week
earlier in the season, took the meet
off to rest, as he had competed in
every single event in each meet
leading up to Saturday. The team
was also missing freshman Brian
Knott, who recently underwent
surgery for a torn bicep. Without
Penev and Knott, the team had no
gymnast compete in the all-around
competition. However, despite its
lack of manpower, the Cardinal
nearly matched its score from last
week, when team-leading Penev
was competing.
Freshman Sean Senters was
crucial in making up for the team's
lost gymnasts, as he set season-high
scores in both floor (14.900) and
vault (15.500), with his vault result
tying Penev's for the nation's best
vault score this season.
The Cardinal also captured the
individual title in the pommel
horse, with junior John Martin fin
ishing first with a 15.300 and junior
Gabriel Alvarado taking second
with a career-best 15.200.
The Cardinal trailed the Bears
by 0.700 points going into the final
round, but Cal was able to pull
away on the high bar to win the
event and seal the season-series
victory in the teams' last regular
season meeting.
Stanford next takes on Michi
gan at home on Sunday at 2 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.

The Stanford men's and
women's gymnastics teams both
took to the mats this weekend, with
the men at home, squaring off
against rival California and the
Japanese Collegiate All-Stars, and
the women in Texas, facing Brown
and the University of Bridgeport.
The women won their second meet
in a row and recorded multiple
team- and personal-best scores,
while the men's team continued to
struggle, finishing third.
The No. 12 women's team
looked to continue its recent mo
mentum as it traveled to Texas for
its meet with the University of
Bridgeport (8-4) and Brown (2-6)
last Saturday. TTie Cardinal (7-2)
ran away with the Metroplex Chal
lenge victory, scoring a total of
196.375, the team's second-best
score of the season, followed by
Bridgeport (193.600) and Brown
(191.725).
The meet was the fourth of five
straight road competitions for the
Cardinal. Despite experiencing
struggles away from home earlier
in the season, head coach Kristen
Smyth said that the team has im
proved with each meet and "has
really come together as a group."
She explained that the team's
strategy for the season was to start
slower in order to protect the ath
letes from injuries and to gear up
for the playoffs (the Pac-12 tourna
ment occurs in late march, and the
NCAA championships are in
April). Saturday's meet, however,
was far from slow, with strong indi
vidual performances in a variety of
events allowing the Cardinal to
coast to victory.

Junior Ashley Morgan won two
events for the Stanford team, which
won three of the four events on the
afternoon. She scored a 9.875 to
win the uneven bars event, but was
even more impressive on the floor
exercise, scoring a season-best
9.925 to earn a tie for victory in the
event. Morgan struggled on the
balance beam, putting up her sea
son-worst performance with an
8.675, but still finished second in
the all-around competition.
Matching Morgan's floor exer
cise score was senior Nicole
Pechanec, whose 9.925 was also a
season-best. Prior to Saturday's
meet, the Cardinal had posted just
two 9.925 scores on the whole sea
son in any event Pechanec on
uneven bars against Cal and senior
Alyssa Brown on beam against
Oregon State but the squad put
up three 9.925s in Saturday's com
petition alone.
Sophomores Shona Morgan, a
2008 Olympian, and Amanda Spin
ner also had career days. Shona
Morgan tied with Pechanec and
Ashley Morgan for the leading
score of the day, a career-best 9.925
to win the beam event. Spinner also
scored a personal best on the beam,
with a 9.800 in only her second col
legiate performance.
Saturday's meet was a day of
new benchmarks, as the Cardinal
was ultimately able to rack up two
career-best and five season-best
scores (one of these tied a previous
season best) by the end of the com
petition. The strong individual per
formances combined to help Stan
ford score season-best team scores
on both floor exercise (49.275) and
beam (49.175).
