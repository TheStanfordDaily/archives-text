# GYMNASTS FACE MIXED RESULTS
## WOMEN WIN, MEN LOSE SECOND STRAIGHT MEET 
### CONNOR SCHERER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's and
women's gymnastics teams both
took to the mats this weekend, with
the men at home, squaring off
against rival California and the
Japanese Collegiate All-Stars, and
the women in Texas, facing Brown
and the University of Bridgeport.
The women won their second meet
in a row and recorded multiple
team- and personal-best scores,
while the men's team continued to
struggle, finishing third.
The No. 12 women's team
looked to continue its recent mo
mentum as it traveled to Texas for
its meet with the University of
Bridgeport (8-4) and Brown (2-6)
last Saturday. TTie Cardinal (7-2)
ran away with the Metroplex Chal
lenge victory, scoring a total of
196.375, the team's second-best
score of the season, followed by
Bridgeport (193.600) and Brown
(191.725).
The meet was the fourth of five
straight road competitions for the
Cardinal. Despite experiencing
struggles away from home earlier
in the season, head coach Kristen
Smyth said that the team has im
proved with each meet and "has
really come together as a group."
She explained that the team's
strategy for the season was to start
slower in order to protect the ath
letes from injuries and to gear up
for the playoffs (the Pac-12 tourna
ment occurs in late march, and the
NCAA championships are in
April). Saturday's meet, however,
was far from slow, with strong indi
vidual performances in a variety of
events allowing the Cardinal to
coast to victory.

Junior Ashley Morgan won two
events for the Stanford team, which
won three of the four events on the
afternoon. She scored a 9.875 to
win the uneven bars event, but was
even more impressive on the floor
exercise, scoring a season-best
9.925 to earn a tie for victory in the
event. Morgan struggled on the
balance beam, putting up her sea
son-worst performance with an
8.675, but still finished second in
the all-around competition.
Matching Morgan's floor exer
cise score was senior Nicole
Pechanec, whose 9.925 was also a
season-best. Prior to Saturday's
meet, the Cardinal had posted just
two 9.925 scores on the whole sea
son in any event Pechanec on
uneven bars against Cal and senior
Alyssa Brown on beam against
Oregon State but the squad put
up three 9.925s in Saturday's com
petition alone.
Sophomores Shona Morgan, a
2008 Olympian, and Amanda Spin
ner also had career days. Shona
Morgan tied with Pechanec and
Ashley Morgan for the leading
score of the day, a career-best 9.925
to win the beam event. Spinner also
scored a personal best on the beam,
with a 9.800 in only her second col
legiate performance.
Saturday's meet was a day of
new benchmarks, as the Cardinal
was ultimately able to rack up two
career-best and five season-best
scores (one of these tied a previous
season best) by the end of the com
petition. The strong individual per
formances combined to help Stan
ford score season-best team scores
on both floor exercise (49.275) and
beam (49.175).
