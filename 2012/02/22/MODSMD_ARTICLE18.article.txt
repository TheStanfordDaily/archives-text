# HOME IS SWEET TO CARD
## TOURNAMENT TITLE SECURED 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It didn't take long for the Stan
ford softball team to wash away
the bad taste of a walk-off loss to
UC-Davis. The No. 8 Cardinal re
turned to the Farm for its first
home games of the year and went
4-1 overall on the weekend, win
ning the Stanford Nike Invitation
al title.

Junior pitcher Teagan Gerhart
lived up to her billing as one of the
Pac-12's best in the circle, throw
ing a complete-game shutout in
the championship victory over

Bradley (4-6) on Sunday after
noon. Appearing to be approach
ing midseason form just two
weekends into the season, the
Norco, Calif., native allowed just
two hits and improved to 8-1 over
all on the year for the Card (8-3).
Stanford's offense gave Ger
hart all the support she needed
with two runs in the bottom of the
fifth inning. Junior second base
man Jenna Rich's sharp single to
left field brought in sophomore
Corey Hanewich, and senior
Jenna Becerra's bases-loaded
walk gave the Cardinal a bit of
breathing room against a pesky
Braves team that refused to go
away.
But Gerhart was up to the
challenge, allowing just one run
ner to reach as far as second base
while striking out three in her
10th start. With the win, she low
ered her ERA to 1.88 10 of the
14 earned runs she has allowed
this season came in one game
against Texas A&M.
What remains for Stanford to

figure out, however, is how to en
sure that Gerhart can stay fresh
through Pac-12 and postseason
play. With the graduation of Ash
ley Chinn who went 16-4 in 20
starts last season the Cardinal
needs freshman Nyree White to
step up and shoulder some of the
load.
White got the call on Saturday,
starting her first game in the circle
after seven appearances in relief,
but the freshman struggled might
ily against a surprising Nevada
team. In 3.1 innings, she gave up
eight runs (six earned), as Stan
ford was run-ruled for the first
time this season in an 11-3 loss.
The Wolfpack (3-7) scored
seven runs in the top of the fourth
inning, helped along by two Stan
ford errors. Despite RBI by junior
designated player Tegan Schmidt
and Rich in the bottom half of the
fifth, the Cardinal suffered its
third loss of the season.
There was little time to re
group, however, as the teams met
in the second game of a double
header just hours later. In the
semifinal matchup, it was all Stan
ford from the get-go.
Senior outfielder Sarah Hass
man led off with a bunt single,
stole second, took third on a single
and scored on a sacrifice fly to
give the Card a 1-0 lead. Gerhart
escaped damage in the second in
ning, and Stanford broke through
with three runs as Hassman
tripled to right field and came
home on Leah White's second sin
gle of the game.
A late run from Nevada closed
the deficit, but outfielder Caitlyn
Pura's two-run triple erased all
doubt and pushed Stanford
through to the championship
game against Bradley, where the
Cardinal finished a dominant
weekend with a 3-0 victory.
It was the same kind of offen
sive production that Stanford re
ceived on day one of the tourna
ment, as almost the entire lineup
got in on the action during two
victories over Pacific and Bradley.
Becerra went 2-3 with a long
home run against the Tigers, and
Schmidt knocked in the game
winning run in the sixth inning of
a 3-2 win over the Braves.
Nevertheless, Stanford will
need to prove it can win without
Gerhart in the circle, as the team
travels to Southern California for
next weekend's Cathedral City
Classic. With a matchup against
No. 4 Oklahoma looming on Fri
day night, the Cardinal must gear
up for an early preseason test
ahead of conference play.

UC-Davis. The No. 8 Cardinal re
turned to the Farm for its first
home games of the year and went
4-1 overall on the weekend, win
ning the Stanford Nike Invitation
al title.

Junior pitcher Teagan Gerhart
lived up to her billing as one of the
Pac-12's best in the circle, throw
ing a complete-game shutout in
the championship victory over

Bradley (4-6) on Sunday after
noon. Appearing to be approach
ing midseason form just two
weekends into the season, the
Norco, Calif., native allowed just
two hits and improved to 8-1 over
all on the year for the Card (8-3).
Stanford's offense gave Ger
hart all the support she needed
with two runs in the bottom of the
fifth inning. Junior second base
man Jenna Rich's sharp single to
left field brought in sophomore
Corey Hanewich, and senior
Jenna Becerra's bases-loaded
walk gave the Cardinal a bit of
breathing room against a pesky
Braves team that refused to go
away.
But Gerhart was up to the
challenge, allowing just one run
ner to reach as far as second base
while striking out three in her
10th start. With the win, she low
ered her ERA to 1.88 10 of the
14 earned runs she has allowed
this season came in one game
against Texas A&M.
What remains for Stanford to

figure out, however, is how to en
sure that Gerhart can stay fresh
through Pac-12 and postseason
play. With the graduation of Ash
ley Chinn who went 16-4 in 20
starts last season the Cardinal
needs freshman Nyree White to
step up and shoulder some of the
load.
White got the call on Saturday,
starting her first game in the circle
after seven appearances in relief,
but the freshman struggled might
ily against a surprising Nevada
team. In 3.1 innings, she gave up
eight runs (six earned), as Stan
ford was run-ruled for the first
time this season in an 11-3 loss.
The Wolfpack (3-7) scored
seven runs in the top of the fourth
inning, helped along by two Stan
ford errors. Despite RBI by junior
designated player Tegan Schmidt
and Rich in the bottom half of the
fifth, the Cardinal suffered its
third loss of the season.
There was little time to re
group, however, as the teams met
in the second game of a double
header just hours later. In the
semifinal matchup, it was all Stan
ford from the get-go.
Senior outfielder Sarah Hass
man led off with a bunt single,
stole second, took third on a single
and scored on a sacrifice fly to
give the Card a 1-0 lead. Gerhart
escaped damage in the second in
ning, and Stanford broke through
with three runs as Hassman
tripled to right field and came
home on Leah White's second sin
gle of the game.
A late run from Nevada closed
the deficit, but outfielder Caitlyn
Pura's two-run triple erased all
doubt and pushed Stanford
through to the championship
game against Bradley, where the
Cardinal finished a dominant
weekend with a 3-0 victory.
It was the same kind of offen
sive production that Stanford re
ceived on day one of the tourna
ment, as almost the entire lineup
got in on the action during two
victories over Pacific and Bradley.
Becerra went 2-3 with a long
home run against the Tigers, and
Schmidt knocked in the game
winning run in the sixth inning of
a 3-2 win over the Braves.
Nevertheless, Stanford will
need to prove it can win without
Gerhart in the circle, as the team
travels to Southern California for
next weekend's Cathedral City
Classic. With a matchup against
No. 4 Oklahoma looming on Fri
day night, the Cardinal must gear
up for an early preseason test
ahead of conference play.
