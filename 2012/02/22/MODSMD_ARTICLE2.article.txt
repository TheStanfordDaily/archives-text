## Filmmaker explores ethics in war 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
In 2007, author, journalist and
filmmaker Sebastian Junger embed
ded himself with a U.S. battle com
pany at a remote outpost in Koren
gal Valley, an area of eastern
Afghanistan widely considered the
most dangerous region in the coun
try. He later parlayed this experi
ence into an Academy Award-nom
inated documentary, "Restrepo,"
and a New York Times best-selling
book, "War." He used his experience
as a reference point Tuesday night
when speaking about issues of
morality in armed conflict.
Junger was joined onstage in
Cemex auditorium by English Pro
fessor Tobias Wolff and Joseph Fel
ter Ph.D. 'O5, a senior research fel
low at the Center for International
Security and Cooperation (CISAC).
Junger said his time embedded
with Battle Company of the 173 rd
Airborne Brigade Combat Team
gave him an immense appreciation
for members of the military.
"The platoon represented every
slice of America," Junger said.
"That's because of 9/11 . . .
[Afghanistan] became everyone's
war. The human logic transcended
politics."
In spending a year with Ameri
can forces, Junger said that he
"wanted to write about something
that has dropped out of public con
versation ... [about] what it means

to be an American soldier."
He praised the dedication of U.S.
forces, saying that few other people
would "do this, and especially not for
someone else's country."
Fetter noted that the time Junger
spent embedded with the troops,
and his willingness to expose himself
to danger on patrol, lends his report
ing sustained credibility. Felter
asked Junger if the lessons learned
in Korengal Valley which had
been convincingly stabilized before
American forces withdrew in 2010
could be more broadly applied.
While acknowledging that each
area of Afghanistan poses distinct
problems, Junger expressed cau
tious optimism about Afghanistan's
future, contingent on the implemen
tation of a less corrupt and more
representative government.
"The Afghans need to believe in
something," Junger said. "You have
to give them a better government
that's not corrupt, and if you do that,

Sebastian Junger, who once embedded himself with a U.S. battle
company, talked ethics in wartime
Afghanistan on Tuesday evening in
Cemex Auditorium.
they'll take care of the Taliban."
"We've squandered some of
the goodwill," he added, "but I
think that we can regain it."
Wolff inquired about how
Junger's desire to integrate him
self into the platoon co-existed
with his journalistic responsibili
ties, and how his ability unlike
the platoon members to leave
at any time affected his efforts to
build trust with soldiers.
Junger said the U.S. military
was extraordinarily open with
journalists in Afghanistan, com
pared, in particular, to NATO al
lies such as the United Kingdom
and France. He said, however, that
earning soldiers' trust was the re
sult of constantly proving himself
on the front line, demonstrating
that "you're risking something,
you're sacrificing something as
well."
Wolff and Felter, who served in
Afghanistan as an officer in the
U.S. Army before retiring this year
as a colonel, both commented on
the drawbacks posed by with
drawing from Korengal Valley, ob
serving that the removal of NATO
troops may jeopardize progress
created and protected by loss of
American life.
"We should worry [about] what
would happen to the women in
Afghanistan," Wolff said, "as well
as [to] the girls just starting to go to
school."
Observing that "Afghanistan
won't succeed or fail because of
the Korengal," Junger neverthe
less acknowledged that the Amer
ican withdrawal will likely have
negative ramifications for the

Afghan population. He argued
that in comparison to the 1990s
when Afghanistan was wracked by
sectional conflict, with an estimat
ed 400,000 civilian deaths the
10 years after NATO's 2001 inter
vention were marked by unprece
dented stability and aid-fueled so
cioeconomic development.
"We brought a lot of good
things that civilians need," Junger
said. "If you want to pull out, you
have to acknowledge that a lot of
good things will stop happening,
and there may be terrible rever
sals."
The audience posed questions
focusing on the human impact of
the conflict, specifically the bur
den borne by young Americans
serving in Afghanistan.
"Guys who got out were far
more of a danger to themselves
and society than the guys who
stayed in," Junger said, noting that
the adrenaline and intensity expe
rienced during combat becomes
difficult to replicate in civilian life,
"They came out alone into society,
and they struggled with it... A
whole generation was really af
fected by this war, and America
will have to figure out how to take
care of them."
"I thought Junger did a really
good job of revealing [in "Restre
po"] what it's like to be a soldier in
Afghanistan," said audience mem
ber Jack Duane 'l3, "and this con
versation was a very good oppor
tunity to examine the morality of
being a soldier."
The talk was part of the Ethics
and War Series now in its sec
ond year and was sponsored by
the Bowen H. McCoy Family Cen
ter for Ethics in Society and Stan
ford's Creative Writing program.
