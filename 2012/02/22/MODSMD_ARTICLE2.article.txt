## Filmmaker explores ethics in war 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
In 2007, author, journalist and
filmmaker Sebastian Junger embed
ded himself with a U.S. battle com
pany at a remote outpost in Koren
gal Valley, an area of eastern
Afghanistan widely considered the
most dangerous region in the coun
try. He later parlayed this experi
ence into an Academy Award-nom
inated documentary, "Restrepo,"
and a New York Times best-selling
book, "War." He used his experience
as a reference point Tuesday night
when speaking about issues of
morality in armed conflict.
Junger was joined onstage in
Cemex auditorium by English Pro
fessor Tobias Wolff and Joseph Fel
ter Ph.D. 'O5, a senior research fel
low at the Center for International
Security and Cooperation (CISAC).
Junger said his time embedded
with Battle Company of the 173 rd
Airborne Brigade Combat Team
gave him an immense appreciation
for members of the military.
"The platoon represented every
slice of America," Junger said.
"That's because of 9/11 . . .
[Afghanistan] became everyone's
war. The human logic transcended
politics."
In spending a year with Ameri
can forces, Junger said that he
"wanted to write about something
that has dropped out of public con
versation ... [about] what it means

to be an American soldier."
He praised the dedication of U.S.
forces, saying that few other people
would "do this, and especially not for
someone else's country."
Fetter noted that the time Junger
spent embedded with the troops,
and his willingness to expose himself
to danger on patrol, lends his report
ing sustained credibility. Felter
asked Junger if the lessons learned
in Korengal Valley which had
been convincingly stabilized before
American forces withdrew in 2010
could be more broadly applied.
While acknowledging that each
area of Afghanistan poses distinct
problems, Junger expressed cau
tious optimism about Afghanistan's
future, contingent on the implemen
tation of a less corrupt and more
representative government.
"The Afghans need to believe in
something," Junger said. "You have
to give them a better government
that's not corrupt, and if you do that,
