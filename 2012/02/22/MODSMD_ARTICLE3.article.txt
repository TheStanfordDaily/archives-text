## Socioeconomic status predicts academic success 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
In the past 50 years, socioeconomic status has be
come an increasingly important predictor of academ
ic achievement on standardized tests, according to a
recently published study by Stanford associate pro
fessor of education Sean Reardon.
University officials, however, said the data neces
sary to determine whether a similar achievement gap
exists between students from low- and high-income
families at Stanford is dispersed between different ad
ministrative offices, making it difficult to track.
Koren Bakkegard, associate dean of Undergrad
uate Advising and Research (UAR), told The Daily
she does not know of a centralized organization in the
University that analyzes both academic achievement
and socioeconomic status.
"It may very well be that no office at the Universi
ty has or combines the data that would be necessary
to generate those kinds of records," Bakkegard said.
"In UAR, for example, we do not have informa
tion about students' socioeconomic status,"
Bakkegard continued. "To my knowledge, only the
Financial Aid Office would have this information, and
I would be surprised if they... tracked students' aca
demic performance since that is not their function."
Tommy Lee Woon, director of diversity and first
generation programs, also could not speak to whether
or not an achievement gap exists between students of
varying income levels due to the way data is kept by
the University.
"I unfortunately do not have the answers," Woon
said.
"Data is very decentralized here," he added.
"Some of the data... may be embedded in reports,
but tracking it down can be a challenge."
Reardon said that although he has no statistical ev
idence to back up his claim, he is doubtful that such an
achievement gap exists at Stanford, as judged by his
research methodology, because of Stanford's highly
selective admissions process.
The data that Reardon used for his study came
from several different nationwide standardized tests,

including data collected by the National Center for
Educational Statistics and the National Assessment
of Educational Progress.
"One of the criteria I used to decide which studies
to use was that I didn't want them to be local," Rear
don said.
The results of his study showed that in the late '6os
and early '7os, family income, rather than race, deter
mined how students performed on standardized tests.
The gap between children in the 90th percentile and
children in the 10th percentile of income was roughly
twice as large as the difference in achievement be
tween white and black children.
In addition, the study showed that the achievement
gap between children of high- and low-income families
was about 30 or 40 percent larger for children bom in
2001 as compared to children bom 25 years earlier.
"Because a place like Stanford is so selective, most
students would score very high on these tests," Rear
don said.
Stanford students who come from low-income
families would have scored high on standardized
tests, and therefore their performance would not be
remarkably different from that of students from mid
dle class or upper class backgrounds.
He added, however, that "the way [the achieve
ment gap] is reflected is that there are fewer students
with low-income backgrounds at a place like Stanford
than kids from a higher-income background."
The achievement gap that Reardon saw in his re
search manifests itself in the fact that lower rates of
low-income students attend college at all, let alone
elite universities such as Stanford.
With its need-blind admissions process and exten
sive financial aid program, Stanford aims to attract as
many qualified low-income students as it can. Howev
er, Reardon said that most students from low-income
backgrounds never get the chance to succeed at a high
enough level to be considered by universities.
"Kids with lower income backgrounds do not get
the opportunities to succeed academically and don't
often get to go to places like Stanford," Reardon said.
