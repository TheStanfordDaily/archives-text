## Journalists must adapt, says fellow 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Declining newspaper ad revenue and
changing readership behaviors have con
tributed to a "psychological crisis" in the
journalism industry, according to current
Stanford Knight Journalism Fellow Anita
Zielina, who spoke Tuesday at the Bech
tel International Center. Zielina said
journalists have tended to be pessimistic
about the future of newspaper use, which
has led to layoffs and general uncertainty
about how the industry should change in
order to regain an audience.
Zielina proposed one possible solution
to this problem: reformatting the way
readers engage with articles through the
commenting feature on newspaper web
sites. To accomplish this, she challenged
journalists to be more open-minded.
Born and raised in Vienna, Austria,
Zielina has freelanced as a journalist
since her high school years. Currently an
online journalist, Zielina discussed the
decline of print newspapers during the
talk, which was entitled "A World With
out Newspapers?"
Newspaper ad revenues have de
creased dramatically since 2005, particu
larly classic print ad revenue, Zielina
noted. She attributed this to a dramatic
shift from print to online ads.
"While there are still people that sub
scribe to print articles, most of us get news
by other means," Zielina said, presenting
a graph on her slide depicting relative
numbers of people subscribing to various

news media. The trend over time for tele
vised news has held stable, but the figures
for print articles and radio broadcast
news are both decreasing. The statistic for
readers of news online has surged past
the height of consumption of print news
papers.
Zielina said that this is because "social
media has a huge piece of the cake." She
said many individuals are now receiving
their news through social channels and
platforms, whether by commenting about
news-related events on social neworking
sites such as Facebook or watching videos
onYouTube.
Following her presentation of the cur
rent problems journalism is facing, Zieli
na suggested changes to news platforms,
remarking that there is a big need for "a
willingness to be open and to embrace
new technologies to approaching the
reader."
Zielina addressed a fact that she

deemed positive: people are still reading
and talking about the news. She contin
ued by saying the central question is how
to bring that conversation back to news
papers, especially on newspaper websites.
Zielina said that one major way to ac
complish this would be to change the
commenting feature on newspaper arti
cles, making them more engaging, social
and user-friendly.
"Comments are below the article,"
Zielina said, as she pointed out the fea
tures on a news website. "It's not the
nicest discussion environment created
there. People just comment, and we don't
really interfere with it. That says a lot
about how much appreciation journalists
have for their readers."
Instead of this system, Zielina suggest
ed adopting new ways to recreate the ex
perience of posting comments by making
