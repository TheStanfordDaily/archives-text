# NEW BRIEF
## Deadline set for Redwood City expansion plans 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ileana Najarro 
During a public hearing Tuesday, the
Redwood City Planning Commission set
April and May deadlines for further study of
the Stanford-proposed Redwood City office
building development.
The Commission will provide the Red

wood City Council with a recommendation
on the project's environmental impact re
port and a zoning map amendment in April.
The council will then hold a public hearing to
consider certifying the recommendations in
May.
The 35-acre development project is part
of Stanford's 48-acre campus renovation of
an area formerly known as Mid-Point Tech
nology Park. In 2005, Stanford Hospital and
Clinics purchased four buddings at this loca
tion, and the University purchased eight. The
University then proposed in 2008 to demol

ish and redevelop these buildings in re
sponse to growth limitations imposed by
Santa Clara County on Stanford through the
University's General Use Permit.
The project aims to create a complex of
medical clinics, offices and facilities for re
search and development for employees who
don't need to work near faculty and students.
According to Lucy Wicks, assistant director
of community relations, in an interview with
the Stanford Report, the University
would continue leasing space to
non-Stanford users while the project
undergoes approval.
"We currently have leases with a
number of non-Stanford compa
nies, and we plan to continue to offer
space to these companies for the
foreseeable future," Wicks said.
"This, of course, could change as
Stanford determines its need to re
develop or occupy space in the fu
ture."
The long-term redevelopment
project would take as many as 30
years for completion. Plans also in
clude structured parking, gyms and
eateries.
The project would also seek to
improve the site's surroundings,
adding an open space in Spinas
Park, providing shuttles and trans
portation alternatives and would
help fund storm water improve
ments.
The Commission is studying traf
fic-congestion remedies and ways to
mitigate increased density with
greener, more attractive architec
ture,
Stanford's proposed environ
mental impact report and precise
plan are currently available for the
public review until March 12.
