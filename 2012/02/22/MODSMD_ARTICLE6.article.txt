## Senate concludes debate about banking waiver 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate passed a
bill during its Tuesday meeting exempting The
Stanford Daily from the ASSU constitutional
mandate requiring student groups to bank
through Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE). Fol
lowing a debate that spanned three Senate meet
ings, although most agreed with the preservation
of The Daily's current banking system, senators
disagreed about the bill's provisions.
Senators Ben Laufer 'l2 and lan Chan 'l4, co
authors of the bill's final version, supported a
clause requiring The Daily to post its audit on the
spring Special Fees ballot. They also favored an
other clause requiring The Daily to submit its fi
nancial receipts to SSE quarterly rather than an
nually, as The Daily has historically done.
"We're just trying to make things better, for all
parties ... I don't see any reason not to do it
quarterly," Laufer said, arguing that a one-time
filing of the approximately $90,000 annual Spe
cial Fees request from The Daily would impose an
unnecessary burden on SSE.
Other Senators, including Dan Ashton 'l4 and
Alon Elhanan 'l4, argued that the provisions
would force The Daily into requirements that are
unprecedented for other Voluntary Student Or
ganizations (VSOs). Although General Fees
groups are required to submit their funding re
quests to SSE quarterly. Special Fees groups such
as the Daily are not, Appropriations Chair Brian
na Pang 'l3 said.
The Senators debated whether or not it is with
in the Senate's power to require a group to post its
nonprofit audit on the special fees ballot, and
whether the Senate can regulate the timing of a
Special Fees group's invoice submissions to SSE.
Laufer and Chan argued that the nature of the
exemption gave the Senate discretion to adjust
the requirements for The Daily. Elhanan said that
he thought the constitution was sufficiently vague
to be up for interpretation and offered up his in
terpretation that the constitution prevents the
Senate from requiring an audit on the Special
Fees ballot, as this might interfere with the elec
toral process of special fees.
After a straw poll on the bill's wording, which
resulted in a split vote between "requiring" and
"encouraging" The Daily to file quarterly reports,
the Senators opted out of the binding provision
