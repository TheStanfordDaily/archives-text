## Senate concludes debate about banking waiver 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate passed a
bill during its Tuesday meeting exempting The
Stanford Daily from the ASSU constitutional
mandate requiring student groups to bank
through Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE). Fol
lowing a debate that spanned three Senate meet
ings, although most agreed with the preservation
of The Daily's current banking system, senators
disagreed about the bill's provisions.
Senators Ben Laufer 'l2 and lan Chan 'l4, co
authors of the bill's final version, supported a
clause requiring The Daily to post its audit on the
spring Special Fees ballot. They also favored an
other clause requiring The Daily to submit its fi
nancial receipts to SSE quarterly rather than an
nually, as The Daily has historically done.
"We're just trying to make things better, for all
parties ... I don't see any reason not to do it
quarterly," Laufer said, arguing that a one-time
filing of the approximately $90,000 annual Spe
cial Fees request from The Daily would impose an
unnecessary burden on SSE.
Other Senators, including Dan Ashton 'l4 and
Alon Elhanan 'l4, argued that the provisions
would force The Daily into requirements that are
unprecedented for other Voluntary Student Or
ganizations (VSOs). Although General Fees
groups are required to submit their funding re
quests to SSE quarterly. Special Fees groups such
as the Daily are not, Appropriations Chair Brian
na Pang 'l3 said.
The Senators debated whether or not it is with
in the Senate's power to require a group to post its
nonprofit audit on the special fees ballot, and
whether the Senate can regulate the timing of a
Special Fees group's invoice submissions to SSE.
Laufer and Chan argued that the nature of the
exemption gave the Senate discretion to adjust
the requirements for The Daily. Elhanan said that
he thought the constitution was sufficiently vague
to be up for interpretation and offered up his in
terpretation that the constitution prevents the
Senate from requiring an audit on the Special
Fees ballot, as this might interfere with the elec
toral process of special fees.
After a straw poll on the bill's wording, which
resulted in a split vote between "requiring" and
"encouraging" The Daily to file quarterly reports,
the Senators opted out of the binding provision
and approved a clause encourag
ing The Daily to submit reim
bursement requests to SSE quar
terly.
Instead of requiring The Daily
to post its annual audit on the spe
cial fees ballot, the final bill in
cluded an amendment, suggested
by Senate Parliamentarian Alex
Kindel 'l4, requiring that The
Daily "provide documentation to
the student body on the Spring
Elections ballot that fulfills the
requirement specified in Appen
dix I, Section 4.E.10 of the ASSU
Joint Bylaws." This section of the
bylaws offers several options for
The Daily to provide financial in
formation about the current and
previous year's expenses to in
form the student vote.

Special Fees approval
The Senate approved five spe
cial fees funding bills Tuesday to
be voted on by the general stu
dent body in the spring election.
All of these bills were unani
mously approved except for the
Alternative Spring Break (ASB)
budget, which Laufer opposed.
ASB, a VSO which hosts spring
break trips and programs that
promote public service and stu
dent activism, submitted a
$90,000 budget proposal that met
all ASSU guidelines.
"For a group that immediately
serves less than 5 percent of [the]
Stanford undergraduate popula
tion and rejects so many others, I
do not think undergraduates
should contribute $l2 to $l5 each
towards a $90,000 budget,"
Laufer said in an email to The
Daily explaining his opposition.
