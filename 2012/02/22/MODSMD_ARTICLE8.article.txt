## BURSTING THE BUBBLE Christie the coward 
### Edward Ngai 
I have had nothing but the great
est respect for Chris Christie,
the straight-shooting Republi
can governor of New Jersey. A
true conservative who is tough,
gifted and relatable, Christie could
always be counted on to walk the
walk, to do what may be unpopu
lar to get what he believes is best
for New Jersey.
Additionally, Mr. Christie has
never been a panderer to the hard
right faction of the Republican
Party. He supported, at least in
principle, the use of medical mari
juana. He has been a staunch de
fender of American Muslims. He
has come out to say that being an
illegal immigrant is "not a crime."
Which is why it came as a great
disappointment to me that Mr.
Christie rejected the State Assem
bly's bipartisan bill legalizing gay
marriage on Friday, calling for a
statewide referendum on the
issue. The veto itself was a disap
pointment, if predictable. But his
call for a referendum was a sur
prising display of cowardice from
a man I have grown to expect far
more from.
There is one overarching prob
lem with this half-veto that goes
beyond the petty politics of liberal
and conservative Mr. Christie
has now pitted New Jerseyan
against New Jerseyan, fracturing a
state and, if a referendum were to
be called, flooding it with special
interest money and voter passion.
Organizations are already
pledging hundreds of thousands of
dollars to defeat same-sex mar
riage in Washington, where it was
made legal two weeks ago. In 2010,
out-of-state money flooded into
lowa judicial races as a result of

the lowa Supreme Court uphold
ing gay marriage. All three justices
on the ballot lost, the first time any
lowa judge has lost in a retention
vote. And of course, the last time
same-sex marriage was put on the
ballot, $B3 million was spent in
California in the most expensive
electoral fight over a social issue in
state history.
Mr. Christie has always been a
governor who has been willing to
take political flak for his decisions.
So it comes as a genuine surprise
that he has passed the buck on to
voters, dividing neighbors and col
leagues from Camden to Clifton.
He had the opportunity to
unite the state for equality; in
stead, he has not only spurned
equality but endorsed a referen
dum that would spurn unity as
well.
I have always personally re
spected Governor Christie for his
straight-ahead attitude. You will
always know where he stands on
the issues, and he will always take
responsibility for his actions. In
many ways, he is a perfect micro
cosm of the New Jersey identity:
no-nonsense, blue-collar, honest
and straight-shooting.
But his referendum will hurt
the people of his state not only
gays, but also everyone who will be
bombarded with fiery rhetoric,
misleading advertising and neigh
borhood tensions. And for what?
So that he can escape the brunt of
liberals' wrath, who will doubtless
ly use marriage equality as a rally
ing cry? So that he can protest his
innocence to the virulently anti
gay extreme right of the Republi
can Party when he seeks their
nomination in 2016 or 2020?

So that he will not be judged in
the eyes of New Jersey's children
as the one man who stood on the
wrong side of history?
If gay marriage is put on the
ballot in a New Jersey statewide
referendum, Mr. Christie would
have successfully shielded himself
from all the anger that stems from
this volatile issue from the left,
from the right, from the future. He
will have absolved himself of all
responsibility.
I have come to expect this cow
ardly dodging of accountability
from most politicians. I have come
to know that they are selfishly will
ing to hurt the people they repre
sent for their own political gain.
But I once believed that Mr.
Christie was above this brand of
politics. And I once respected him
greatly for it.
On Friday, Mr. Christie disap
pointed an honest, responsible
leader who was poised to take our
politics in a new direction. This
leader once urged, "Now is the
time when we must all resist the
traditional, selfish call to protect
[our] own turf at the cost of our
state. It is time to leave the corner,
join the sacrifice ... and be a part
of the solution."
The speaker was, of course
say it with me one Christopher
James Christie of New Jersey.
Coward.
