# RAVALATIONS
## On behalf of frosh in four-class dorms 
### Ravali Reddy 
I attended several Stanford get
togethers for students in the
Bay Area during the summer
between my high school gradua
tion and my first day at Stanford,
and each made me more excited
and antsy than the last. The major
ity of these events were hosted at
the houses of alumni in the area,
and there were always current stu
dents present, eager to answer
questions and talk to us fresh meat
about what we were planning on
doing once we got to Stanford.
Now that I think about it, I'm pret
ty sure shameless student group
recruiting starts at these events.
The get-togethers always ended
in a Q&A session with a panel of
the current Stanford students, usu
ally led by the alumnus (or alumni
let's not forget about that scari
fy high marriage rate) hosting the
party. These sessions were harm
less enough; the students answered
questions about what they were
majoring in and what they liked
best about Stanford, bestowing
upon all of us a piece of wisdom
they wish they had known before
starting their freshman year.
Now, at every single gathering I
went to, at least half of the current
students gave us the same piece of
advice: "Live in an all-freshman
dorm." This statement was usually
followed up with endorsements
such as, "I had the best time of my
life! Larkin love forever!" or, "I
met all my best friends in my fresh
man dorm!" The discussions tend
ed to end in jocular arguments
about whether Stern or Wilbur was
superior.
At the time, I had no idea what
Stern or Wilbur was, but I knew
that, as an incoming freshman, I

simply had to live there. So I ran
home, filled out my housing forms
and sent them off, eagerly waiting
for the email response that would
inform me of my residence for the
upcoming year.
When my housing assignment
finally arrived, I found myself star
ing at my screen in confusion. I had
been placed in a four-class dorm
in West Lag, to be specific
and I didn't really know what to
expect.
All of my future classmates that
I had met at Admit Weekend were
eagerly updating their Facebook
statuses. I saw multiple "Otero!!!!"
and "OMG GUYS, I'M IN
TWAIN TOO!" statements, but
absolutely none that said West
Lag. In that moment, it seemed as
if every freshman but me had been
placed into an all-freshman dorm.
Granted, once I arrived at Stan
ford, I quickly learned that the ma
jority of the residents in my dorm
were fellow freshmen, and most of
my real fears went unrealized. Liv
ing in a four-class dorm didn't pre
vent me from making best friends.
To this day, my closest friends are
the ones who lived in West Lag
with me.
I entered the housing draw with
six friends from Lag, and I still live
with my roommate from last year
(thank you, Stanford Housing, for
getting that one right). I made one
of the best friends I have ever had
in that dorm. This friend had actu

ally requested a four-class, so we
would never have met if I hadn't
been placed in West Lag.
So if everything turned out
dandy, then why this column? Be
cause, despite the fact that I ended
up having a great freshman year, I
still managed to miss out on a few
"key Stanford experiences" that
four-class dorms tend to ignore. I
got to enjoy all the awkwardness of
Scavenger Hunt and Screw Your
Roommate, but I missed out on
events like the infamous Game and
the (supposedly) epic mess of a
night that is Dorm Storm. Hearing
my fellow Fourteen-ers recount
stories from those nights a year
later, I can't help but feel like I may
have missed out on an experience I
would have cherished for a lifetime.
This week's column is nothing
more than a plea to those current
ly going through the staffing appli
cation process. Some of you will
get placed as RAs in four-class
dorms. On behalf of the incoming
Class of 2016, I humbly request
that when you plan the upcoming
year, please keep in mind that you
have eager freshman residents in
your midst, and there's a good
chance that quite a few of them re
quested an all-freshman dorm.
Rather than ignoring this fact,
four-class RAs would be better off
trying to establish connections
with East Campus freshman resi
dences in order to ensure that no
one misses out on any of the ridicu
lousness that is supposed to ac
company freshman year.

stand on the ever-contentious Stern
vs. Wilbur issue. Send your thoughts

would never have met if I hadn't
been placed in West Lag.
So if everything turned out
dandy, then why this column? Be
cause, despite the fact that I ended
up having a great freshman year, I
still managed to miss out on a few
"key Stanford experiences" that
four-class dorms tend to ignore. I
got to enjoy all the awkwardness of
Scavenger Hunt and Screw Your
Roommate, but I missed out on
events like the infamous Game and
the (supposedly) epic mess of a
night that is Dorm Storm. Hearing
my fellow Fourteen-ers recount
stories from those nights a year
later, I can't help but feel like I may
have missed out on an experience I
would have cherished for a lifetime.
This week's column is nothing
more than a plea to those current
ly going through the staffing appli
cation process. Some of you will
get placed as RAs in four-class
dorms. On behalf of the incoming
Class of 2016, I humbly request
that when you plan the upcoming
year, please keep in mind that you
have eager freshman residents in
your midst, and there's a good
chance that quite a few of them re
quested an all-freshman dorm.
Rather than ignoring this fact,
four-class RAs would be better off
trying to establish connections
with East Campus freshman resi
dences in order to ensure that no
one misses out on any of the ridicu
lousness that is supposed to ac
company freshman year.

I attended several Stanford get
togethers for students in the
Bay Area during the summer
between my high school gradua
tion and my first day at Stanford,
and each made me more excited
and antsy than the last. The major
ity of these events were hosted at
the houses of alumni in the area,
and there were always current stu
dents present, eager to answer
questions and talk to us fresh meat
about what we were planning on
doing once we got to Stanford.
Now that I think about it, I'm pret
ty sure shameless student group
recruiting starts at these events.
The get-togethers always ended
in a Q&A session with a panel of
the current Stanford students, usu
ally led by the alumnus (or alumni
let's not forget about that scari
fy high marriage rate) hosting the
party. These sessions were harm
less enough; the students answered
questions about what they were
majoring in and what they liked
best about Stanford, bestowing
upon all of us a piece of wisdom
they wish they had known before
starting their freshman year.
Now, at every single gathering I
went to, at least half of the current
students gave us the same piece of
advice: "Live in an all-freshman
dorm." This statement was usually
followed up with endorsements
such as, "I had the best time of my
life! Larkin love forever!" or, "I
met all my best friends in my fresh
man dorm!" The discussions tend
ed to end in jocular arguments
about whether Stern or Wilbur was
superior.
At the time, I had no idea what
Stern or Wilbur was, but I knew
that, as an incoming freshman, I

simply had to live there. So I ran
home, filled out my housing forms
and sent them off, eagerly waiting
for the email response that would
inform me of my residence for the
upcoming year.
When my housing assignment
finally arrived, I found myself star
ing at my screen in confusion. I had
been placed in a four-class dorm
in West Lag, to be specific
and I didn't really know what to
expect.
All of my future classmates that
I had met at Admit Weekend were
eagerly updating their Facebook
statuses. I saw multiple "Otero!!!!"
and "OMG GUYS, I'M IN
TWAIN TOO!" statements, but
absolutely none that said West
Lag. In that moment, it seemed as
if every freshman but me had been
placed into an all-freshman dorm.
Granted, once I arrived at Stan
ford, I quickly learned that the ma
jority of the residents in my dorm
were fellow freshmen, and most of
my real fears went unrealized. Liv
ing in a four-class dorm didn't pre
vent me from making best friends.
To this day, my closest friends are
the ones who lived in West Lag
with me.
I entered the housing draw with
six friends from Lag, and I still live
with my roommate from last year
(thank you, Stanford Housing, for
getting that one right). I made one
of the best friends I have ever had
in that dorm. This friend had actu

ally requested a four-class, so we
would never have met if I hadn't
been placed in West Lag.
