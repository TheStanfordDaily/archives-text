# PROFILE ROMAN LARSON
## FRESHMAN FIGHTS FOR EDUCATION REFORM 
### AUSTIN BLOCK 
It was finally Roman Larson's turn
to speak at the forum. With his fel
low candidates looking on, Larson
'l5, dressed in a dark suit and tie,
leaned into the microphone and
began his pitch.
"I honestly never understood this con
cept that we are not going to reward
somebody for doing a good job, but we
are going to reward them for being in the
school system for 10 years, 20 years," he
said. "You know, in every other profession
in America, you get rewarded for produc
ing results. In education, that's not the
case."
Larson, a freshman who intends to
major in political science and pursue a
coterminal degree in policy, organization
and leadership studies at Stanford's
School of Education, was one of seven
candidates who ran this week for three
open positions on the Mequon-
Thiensville Board of Education in Wis
consin.
Although Larson lost the primary, he
remained upbeat, releasing a video state
ment stating, "Even though I am disap
pointed by the results of the election, I am
encouraged by the enthusiasm and excite
ment shown by so many individuals in the
community.
"While my campaign activities will
come to a close this evening, I cannot
overstate what an amazing learning op
portunity this has been," he added.
In the last few months, Larson had
been traveling back and forth between
Wisconsin and Stanford, alternating be
tween campaigning, studying and catch
ing red-eye flights in both directions. As
part of the campaign process, he ran news
paper ads, advertised through social
media, distributed flyers and campaigned
door-to-door.
"I've learned so much about campaign
finance laws, getting a campaign going,
how to present yourself as a candidate,
talking to individuals about your ideas,"
he said. "All of that is just a great learning
experience in itself... beyond the actual
winning or losing of the election."
Larson traces his interest in education
policy back to his ninth-grade Eagle
Scout project, in which he started an after

school tutoring program for middle
school students in his area.
Working with his former middle
school principal, he developed a tutoring
model in which high-school students
mentored middle school students in one
hour sessions.

Over the course of his high school career,
Larson grew this program into Dimen
sions Learning Inc., a nonprofit corpora
tion that has logged over 10,000 hours of
volunteer service and now serves several
Wisconsin school districts.

Dimensions Learning is composed of
three main programs: 9th Dimension, the
original tutoring program; 10th Dimen
sion, a private one-on-one tutoring pro
gram; and 11th Dimension, a summer
school program. In addition to using high
school volunteers, Dimensions Learning
employs teachers and tutors to operate
10th Dimension and 11th Dimension.
Larson estimated that at least 500 stu
dents have participated in Dimensions
Learning programs.
After Larson moved to Stanford, a new
executive director was brought in to run
the organization's daily operations, al
though Larson still serves on the board of
directors and advises the new executive.
Larson began to develop an interest in
running for the school board due to con
troversies at his high school during his
senior year, including an attempt to cut
the foreign language program. He was
further motivated by the turmoil caused
by Wisconsin's Act 10, which limited the
collective bargaining rights of unions
including teachers' unions.
In his vision of education reform, Lar
son emphasizes promoting fiscal respon
sibility in the school district and focusing
on maximizing the quality of teaching for
the approximately 3,500 students in
Mequon-Thiensville schools.
He said a more comprehensive
teacher-evaluation system to more accu
rately assess teacher performance is
needed, although he does not advocate
basing teacher pay on merit alone.
Mequon-Thiensville School District
Superintendent Demond Means, who ad
vised Larson and worked with him on 9th
Dimension, praised his work.
"He has demonstrated himself to be a
very wise young man when it comes to un
derstanding the components of running
supplemental support programs to public
schools," he said. "I think Roman is a very
talented young man with a very bright fu
ture in politics and public service."
Reflecting on his work thus far, Larson
said, "I'm on the track of where I think I
want to go in life. I've considered doing
other things or if I have other passions,
and I've realized I don't, so why not go
after what I love right now?"

tion that has logged over 10,000 hours of
volunteer service and now serves several
Wisconsin school districts.

Dimensions Learning is composed of
three main programs: 9th Dimension, the
original tutoring program; 10th Dimen
sion, a private one-on-one tutoring pro
gram; and 11th Dimension, a summer
school program. In addition to using high
school volunteers, Dimensions Learning
employs teachers and tutors to operate
10th Dimension and 11th Dimension.
Larson estimated that at least 500 stu
dents have participated in Dimensions
Learning programs.
After Larson moved to Stanford, a new
executive director was brought in to run
the organization's daily operations, al
though Larson still serves on the board of
directors and advises the new executive.
Larson began to develop an interest in
running for the school board due to con
troversies at his high school during his
senior year, including an attempt to cut
the foreign language program. He was
further motivated by the turmoil caused
by Wisconsin's Act 10, which limited the
collective bargaining rights of unions
including teachers' unions.
In his vision of education reform, Lar
son emphasizes promoting fiscal respon
sibility in the school district and focusing
on maximizing the quality of teaching for
the approximately 3,500 students in
Mequon-Thiensville schools.
He said a more comprehensive
teacher-evaluation system to more accu
rately assess teacher performance is
needed, although he does not advocate
basing teacher pay on merit alone.
Mequon-Thiensville School District
Superintendent Demond Means, who ad
vised Larson and worked with him on 9th
Dimension, praised his work.
"He has demonstrated himself to be a
very wise young man when it comes to un
derstanding the components of running
supplemental support programs to public
schools," he said. "I think Roman is a very
talented young man with a very bright fu
ture in politics and public service."
Reflecting on his work thus far, Larson
said, "I'm on the track of where I think I
want to go in life. I've considered doing
other things or if I have other passions,
and I've realized I don't, so why not go
after what I love right now?"

Roman Larson '15, a Wisconsin native who founded an education non-profit while in high school, ran and lost this week in a primary race for a
spot on the Wisconsin Mequon-Thiensville Board of Education. Larson said
he plans to follow his passion for education reform despite the setback.
It was finally Roman Larson's turn
to speak at the forum. With his fel
low candidates looking on, Larson
'l5, dressed in a dark suit and tie,
leaned into the microphone and
began his pitch.
"I honestly never understood this con
cept that we are not going to reward
somebody for doing a good job, but we
are going to reward them for being in the
school system for 10 years, 20 years," he
said. "You know, in every other profession
in America, you get rewarded for produc
ing results. In education, that's not the
case."
Larson, a freshman who intends to
major in political science and pursue a
coterminal degree in policy, organization
and leadership studies at Stanford's
School of Education, was one of seven
candidates who ran this week for three
open positions on the Mequon-
Thiensville Board of Education in Wis
consin.
Although Larson lost the primary, he
remained upbeat, releasing a video state
ment stating, "Even though I am disap
pointed by the results of the election, I am
encouraged by the enthusiasm and excite
ment shown by so many individuals in the
community.
"While my campaign activities will
come to a close this evening, I cannot
overstate what an amazing learning op
portunity this has been," he added.
In the last few months, Larson had
been traveling back and forth between
Wisconsin and Stanford, alternating be
tween campaigning, studying and catch
ing red-eye flights in both directions. As
part of the campaign process, he ran news
paper ads, advertised through social
media, distributed flyers and campaigned
door-to-door.
"I've learned so much about campaign
finance laws, getting a campaign going,
how to present yourself as a candidate,
talking to individuals about your ideas,"
he said. "All of that is just a great learning
experience in itself... beyond the actual
winning or losing of the election."
Larson traces his interest in education
policy back to his ninth-grade Eagle
Scout project, in which he started an after

school tutoring program for middle
school students in his area.
Working with his former middle
school principal, he developed a tutoring
model in which high-school students
mentored middle school students in one
hour sessions.

Over the course of his high school career,
Larson grew this program into Dimen
sions Learning Inc., a nonprofit corpora
tion that has logged over 10,000 hours of
volunteer service and now serves several
Wisconsin school districts.
