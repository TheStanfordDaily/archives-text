## SEEING GREEN The 						spring boileth over 
### Holly Moeller 
HANMER, N.Z. It was with
great excitement that I lo
cated the last site for my
field survey near a town famous
for its hot springs. What better way
to close out an intense round of
sampling than lounging in a natu
rally toasty pool?
And yet, when all was said and
done, and we'd enjoyed a warm
day dodging wasp nests in the
field, neither Kathrin (whose
hands excavated most of the tree
seedlings we collected) nor I felt
much like getting heated up again.
So I missed the famous Hanmer
Hot Springs, but enjoyed fish-n
-chips and a cold beer instead.
What I didn't miss, though, was
the springs' sulfur aroma, familiar
after visits to Yellowstone and
Lassen Volcanic, which signifies
the origins of the water kilometers
below the Earth's surface. The
smell is a sign not just of a thera
peutic bathing spot, but also of
New Zealand's incredibly active
geology.
Perched at the intersection of
the Pacific and Indo-Australian
Plates, New Zealand has a back
bone of geothermal activity, huge
craters from volcanoes past and a
spiderweb of fault lines whose
tremors even I can sometimes feel.
(As I write this, we're on palpable
earthquake number 10,146. Since
I arrived last month, most people
have felt a few dozen; I've noticed
only a handful of the strongest.)
Though there's not much to be
done about the quakes, at least
sunken volcanoes make good har
bors, and geothermal activity is an
energy goldmine. Hanmer's
springs haven't been tapped (for
more than tourists' gold, that is),
but the North Island's springs
have. Generators on the Taupo
Volcanic Field provide 13 percent
of New Zealand's electricity each
year. Meanwhile, hydroelectric
plants (especially on New
Zealand's South Island, with its
dramatic landscapes and fast
flowing rivers) meet 56.4 percent
of electricity demand. A further
3.7 percent of power is generated
from wind.
New Zealand is rightly proud
of its ability to generate nearly
three quarters of its electricity
from renewable sources, ensuring
its energy security and protecting
the global atmosphere. Still, Kiwis
haven't been immune to the allure
of fast-flowing fossil fuels: Back in
1930,90 percent of Kiwi electricity
came from renewables, but as de
mand grew, so too did reliance on
coal.
Meanwhile, back home in the
States, a paltry 10 percent of our
electricity comes from renewable
sources. (Two thirds of our total
electricity generation comes from
coal and natural gas; the remain
ing comes mostly from nuclear.)
Yet that 10 percent amounts to
434 terawatt hours each year, 10
times the total electricity generat
ed in all of New Zealand. In fact,
only China surpasses the United
States in renewable electricity
generation.
That doesn't excuse the fact
that, while the U.S. population is
70 times bigger than New
Zealand's, the United States con
sumes 100 times as much electrici
ty. An average American uses
roughly 40 percent more electrici
ty than an average Kiwi, and, when
it comes to total energy use, we

outstrip New Zealanders by 78
percent.
So the story isn't just about
emitting less. It's also about simply
using less. Imagine cutting our per
sonal electricity consumption
down to New Zealanders' levels
and taking coal-fired power plants
offline accordingly: We could trim
1.2 billion metric tonnes of carbon
dioxide emissions each year.
More will be cut as we build on
an already-strong renewables
foundation. Though the second
ever commercial geothermal elec
tricity plant was built in New
Zealand in 1958 (the first entered
Italian service in 1904), today the
world's most productive region is
in our own backyard. Seventy
miles north of San Francisco in the
Mayacamas Mountains, 22 geot
hermal plants serve five adjacent
counties. Between these plants,
hydroelectric power from dams
across most major rivers and wind
farms scattered across hillsides,
Californians get 31 percent of
their electricity from renewable
sources.
Meanwhile, across the country
attention is increasingly being
paid to giant turbines, vats of algal
biofuels and vast expanses of solar
panels. A Stanford acquaintance
works on photovoltaics; my first
research lab at Rutgers University
continues to stir soupy green di
atom cultures; a cousin just started
his first steady job in years as a
wind farm repairman.
Depending on which literature
you read, the future of renewables
burns bright. Certainly it must be,
since competing supplies of fossil
fuels are dwindling, driving prices
up. And though the United States
can strip mine its way through at
least another few decades of coal,
those of us concerned with pictur
esque mountaintops and climate
change believe that there must be
a better path.
After watching the sun set over
New Zealand's own picturesque
mountains, the Southern Alps, I
switch on a light for the first time
today. I think I could get used to
this low-electricity lifestyle.
