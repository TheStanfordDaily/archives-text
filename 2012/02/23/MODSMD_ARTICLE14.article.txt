# MODERN MANNERS
## Let's play more name games 
### Jeff Mandell 
A friend of mine likes to say,
"Awkwardness is the bane
of modern society." I'm
not completely sure what this
means, but with regards to univer
sity life, I think my friend has a
point.
Stanford is an awkward size.
With nearly 7,000 undergradu
ates, plus thousands more em
ployees and graduate students, it's
impossible to know everyone per
sonally. Maintaining the feel of a
tight-knit college community is
hard when public spaces contain a
sea of unknown faces. We are
more trusting of others and more
open to strangers than we are in
the world at large, but not to the
extent that we would be if there
were only 500 or 1,000 of us.
There are a lot of things we do
to promote a sense of connected
ness. We take the same classes, go
to the same parties and wear the
same free t-shirts. On a more inti
mate level, we form subcultures
based on our freshman dorms, our
fraternities or sororities, the soci

eties and clubs and teams we are a
part of. For better or worse, we
sometimes divide ourselves by
race, nationality, gender, sexual
orientation and other personal
characteristics.
Do most people find that being
a Stanford student supersedes
these other allegiances, at least
during their years on campus? I
have no idea, but I think the an
swer would say a lot about the
health of our community.
There are probably many ways
to strengthen our community, but
I have thought of one in particular
that would be extremely easy to
pull off. It would encourage social
interaction, and I bet it would
have the added bonus of improv
ing academic performance.
We need to play more name
games in discussion sections.
It's really strange that there
doesn't seem to be any general
policy about having people learn
each other's names in sections.
Usually the first meeting has a
round of introductions, but some
times even that doesn't happen.
Either way, most of us can't re
member names until we've both
heard and said them several times.
What often happens is that every
body picks up a few names and
misses the rest. Eventually, it be
comes too late to learn them be
cause it's embarrassing to sit at a
table with people for two months
and not know their names.
I haven't done a formal study
on this, but when classmates don't
know each other's names, it seems
a lot less likely that they are going
to interact much, inside or outside
of the classroom. Since sections,
especially ones for freshman or
introductory classes, provide fair
ly random cross-sections of the
student population, a great op
portunity to build diverse friend
ships is often missed. And once
anonymity in the classroom be
comes the norm, it becomes hard
for even the most outgoing people
to buck the trend.
In some of my sections, there
have been little name cards for
the first few weeks. These are
much better than nothing (these
have generally been my best sec
tions), but they are not perfect.
First, it's hard to see all of them:
it's tricky to place a name card so
that everyone can view it from a
favorable angle. Second, the cards

can provide you with a crutch to
rely on in lieu of setting anything
to memory. In an ideal section,
everyone would get to know each
other quickly, and there would be
a real opportunity for long-term
relationships to develop. At the
very least, a friendlier atmosphere
would make the time pass quick
er, and people learn better when
they feel invested in the group.
Becoming friends starts with
learning names, and the solution
to this problem is simple: dedicate
the time to drill it in. Play a game
or have a competition. Pass a ball
around the room at high speed,
calling out the names of all the
passers and receivers. However
they do it, all section leaders
should dedicate five or 10 minutes
to get a classroom properly ac
quainted. Beyond making one
quarter of class more enjoyable,
the results could benefit our com
munity as a whole.

It's really strange
