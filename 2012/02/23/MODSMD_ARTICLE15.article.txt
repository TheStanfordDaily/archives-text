## Time for Dawkins to go 
### Jack Blanchat 
Five weeks ago today, I
wrote a column profuse
ly praising the Stanford
men's basketball team.
But oh, how things have
changed since then.
Five weeks ago, the Cardinal
was 15-3, and it looked like it had a
good shot at going to the NCAA
Tournament. But in the days since
my column dropped, the Cardinal
has gone 3-6 and is now well out of
the running to get a bid to the Big
Dance.
Five weeks ago, Johnny
Dawkins had saved himself from
any questions about his job securi
ty, taken the Cardinal to first place
in the Pac-12 and transformed me
from a bitter, disillusioned fan into
one who was foolish enough to say
something like, "The Stanford bas
ketball team is back."
Boy, that was stupid.
As the exceptional Rob Schnei
der says in the American film clas
sic "The Waterboy," "Oh no, we
suck again!" Maybe I jinxed the
Cardinal's chances by praising the
team so effusively, but today I come
to you not to praise the Cardinal
basketball team, but to bury it.
Today, as we watch the basket
ball team's season collapse in a
fashion just as disastrous as a typi
cal Clemson football season, I have
to wonder if this abysmal end to
the season is just enough to finally
do in Dawkins' career on the Stan
ford sideline.
Do you allow him to stay as a
reward for the team's hot (maybe
fluky?) start, or do you punish him
for letting the team fall apart down
the stretch?
Right now, the Cardinal is a
crappy seventh-place team in a
crappy Pac-12 Conference, and if
Dawkins isn't able to miraculously
will the Cardinal to a Pac-12 Tour
nament victory, can the Stanford
athletic department justifiably let
him return for another year?
Personally, I don't think so I
think this disastrous finish has fi
nally proved to me that Dawkins
isn't the guy to lead the Cardinal
back to the NCAA Tournament,
even after my initial optimism this
year.
I understand that Dawkins did
n't have much talent to work with
when he came to the Farm, and it's
true that the Cardinal's talent level
(but not its free-throw percentage)
has improved in the last three
years. But the fact still remains that
his teams haven't finished higher
than seventh in the conference in
any of his first three (and likely his
first four) years.
Stanford hasn't fired a coach of
any major sport since Walt Flarris
was relieved of his duties as head
football coach in 2006 after going
1-11, so I'm aware of just how seri
ous of a statement I'm making
but it's worth remembering that
for almost two decades, Stanford
was a basketball school.
The Cardinal made the NCAA
tournament just about every year
for 18 years under head coach
Mike Montgomery the same
guy who is now leading archrival
Cal to first place in the Pac-12.
Even Trent Johnson, Mont
gomery's successor, went to the
Big Dance three times in his four
years at the helm. Combine that
with the fact that the Pac-12 today
is a significantly weaker confer
ence than it was back in the '9os
and early 2000s, and it's a bit
painful to consider just how inept
the Cardinal has been for the past
several years.
Perhaps the team's hot start this
season just shot my expectations
too high after all, I would like to
have seen Stanford make the
NCAA tournament just once in
my four years here but I just
don't see a brighter future ahead
for the Cardinal if it decides to stay
with Dawkins.
The players that he's brought in
haven't developed into consistent
performers, the team has lost just
about every single close game over
the last four years, nobody can
make free throws and the enthusi
asm about the men's basketball
program appears to be at an all
time low. All things considered, I
think it's time to admit that
Dawkins is a great assistant coach,
but not a head coach.
I know that in the world of col
lege basketball today, there's a lot a
pressure to win and win right
away, and it's hard to compete on a
national level when Stanford
doesn't attract any of the one-and
done talents that flock to schools
like Kentucky, Kansas and Syra-

cuse. But when his career record is
an appalling 28-41 in the awful
Pac-12, there's just no defending
Dawkins any more.

Jack Blanchat is secretly hoping
this column works as reverse psy
chology for the team. Point out to
Jack that this could mean four
more years of Dawkins at blan
chat@stanford.edu or follow him
on Twitter @jmblanchat.
