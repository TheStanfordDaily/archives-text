# Card heads on Rocky road
## STANFORD FACES COLORADO 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
After a tough home loss to
Oregon eliminated Stanford
from a first-place finish in the
Pac-12, the Cardinal will take to
the road for the last time in reg
ular-season play. For the first
time ever in conference play, the
Stanford basketball team (18-9,
8-7 Pac-12) is heading to the
Rocky Mountains, where it will
take on the Pac-12's two newest
additions: the Colorado Buf
faloes (18-8,10-4) and the Utah
Utes (5-21,2-12).
First up for the Card is a trip
to Boulder, where it will look to
complete a season sweep of
Buffs. Colorado has played ex
ceptionally well following its
loss to Stanford on Jan. 14, win
ning seven of its last nine games.
After being perhaps the most
controversial omission from the
NCAA tournament last year,
the Buffaloes are looking to
make a statement in their last
few conference games to earn
themselves an at-large bid in this
year's tourney. Still, it is an uphill
climb for Colorado, and they will
probably have to win each of
their final four conference
games to have a solid at-large
case.

The first time around, Stan
ford delivered one of its best of
fensive performances of the
year, dismantling the Buffs en
route to an 84-64 victory. The
Card shot an outstanding 53 per
cent from the field, led by the
play of guards Chasson Randle
and Aaron Bright. Randle led
the way with 18 points, while
Bright trailed close behind with
14. Sophomore forward Josh
Huestis pitched in as well with a
career-high 13 points. The Card
dominated on the glass, grab
bing nine more rebounds than
the Buffs. Stanford will look to
regain midseason form in order
to upset favored Colorado.
Colorado will look to even
the score with Stanford on
Thursday night. Seniors Carlon
Brown and Austin Dufault will
play a major role, as both are
looking to end their careers with
a bang. Brown leads the team in
scoring with 12.3 points per
game from the guard position.
The Utah transfer has been a
major asset for Colorado this
year, and he will look to show
the Stanford faithful why. The 6-
foot-9 forward Dufault is not far
behind, averaging 11.3 points
per game and shooting above 50

Cardinal's first meeting with Colorado. After a rough game against Oregon,
he will need to bounce back for Stanford to complete the season sweep.
