# Card heads on Rocky road
## STANFORD FACES COLORADO 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
After a tough home loss to
Oregon eliminated Stanford
from a first-place finish in the
Pac-12, the Cardinal will take to
the road for the last time in reg
ular-season play. For the first
time ever in conference play, the
Stanford basketball team (18-9,
8-7 Pac-12) is heading to the
Rocky Mountains, where it will
take on the Pac-12's two newest
additions: the Colorado Buf
faloes (18-8,10-4) and the Utah
Utes (5-21,2-12).
First up for the Card is a trip
to Boulder, where it will look to
complete a season sweep of
Buffs. Colorado has played ex
ceptionally well following its
loss to Stanford on Jan. 14, win
ning seven of its last nine games.
After being perhaps the most
controversial omission from the
NCAA tournament last year,
the Buffaloes are looking to
make a statement in their last
few conference games to earn
themselves an at-large bid in this
year's tourney. Still, it is an uphill
climb for Colorado, and they will
probably have to win each of
their final four conference
games to have a solid at-large
case.

The first time around, Stan
ford delivered one of its best of
fensive performances of the
year, dismantling the Buffs en
route to an 84-64 victory. The
Card shot an outstanding 53 per
cent from the field, led by the
play of guards Chasson Randle
and Aaron Bright. Randle led
the way with 18 points, while
Bright trailed close behind with
14. Sophomore forward Josh
Huestis pitched in as well with a
career-high 13 points. The Card
dominated on the glass, grab
bing nine more rebounds than
the Buffs. Stanford will look to
regain midseason form in order
to upset favored Colorado.
Colorado will look to even
the score with Stanford on
Thursday night. Seniors Carlon
Brown and Austin Dufault will
play a major role, as both are
looking to end their careers with
a bang. Brown leads the team in
scoring with 12.3 points per
game from the guard position.
The Utah transfer has been a
major asset for Colorado this
year, and he will look to show
the Stanford faithful why. The 6-
foot-9 forward Dufault is not far
behind, averaging 11.3 points
per game and shooting above 50

percent from the field.
However, neither of these
players poses the biggest
matchup problem for Stanford.
That honor belongs to sopho
more forward Andre Roberson,
who has been a force on both
ends of the court for the Buffs, av
eraging a double-double on the
year. He leads the team in re
bounds (11.3 per game) and
blocks (1.1 per game), to go along
with an average of 11.2 points.
While Roberson was the only
bright spot for the Buffs in their
first matchup against Stanford,
the Card managed to keep him
off the boards for the most part.
The Cardinal then travels to
Utah to take on the Utes in what
looks to be a favorable matchup
on paper. Utah is currently sitting
at 11th in the Pac-12 and has lost
its last seven games. Things didn't
go as smoothly as they should
have for the Card in the teams'
first matchup, as Stanford barely
managed to squeak out a 68-65
win after a late Utah charge.
Huestis carried Stanford in this

one, scoring all of his game-high
13 points in the second half.
This time around, Utah's lead
ing scorer, senior guard Josh
Watkins, will not be in uniform.
Watkins was dismissed from the
team on Jan. 17 following a num
ber of indiscretions related to his
performance and attendance in
class. Junior guard Chris Hines
has stepped up, posting 11.1
points per game following the
suspension. Stanford will also be
faced with the daunting task of
stopping 7-foot center Jason
Washburn. Washburn leads the
team in rebounds at 6.3 per game
and is second in points at 10.6, be
hind only the dismissed Watkins.
If Stanford can neutralize these
two weapons, it can coast to an
easy victory.
As the Pac-12 tournament
draws nearer, the seeding picture
becomes clearer and clearer for
the Cardinal. Stanford is current
ly sitting at seventh in the confer
ence but could easily leapfrog
sixth-place UCLA with a couple
of wins down the stretch.
Stanford will look to start with
a road victory against Colorado at
7:30 p.m. tonight.

year, dismantling the Buffs en

Card shot an outstanding 53 per

play of guards Chasson Randle
and Aaron Bright. Randle led
the way with 18 points, while
Bright trailed close behind with

Huestis pitched in as well with a
career-high 13 points. The Card

the Buffs. Stanford will look to

Colorado will look to even
the score with Stanford on
Thursday night. Seniors Carlon
Brown and Austin Dufault will
play a major role, as both are
looking to end their careers with
a bang. Brown leads the team in
scoring with 12.3 points per
game from the guard position.
The Utah transfer has been a
major asset for Colorado this
year, and he will look to show
the Stanford faithful why. The 6-
foot-9 forward Dufault is not far
behind, averaging 11.3 points
per game and shooting above 50

percent from the field.
However, neither of these
players poses the biggest
matchup problem for Stanford.
That honor belongs to sopho
more forward Andre Roberson,
who has been a force on both
ends of the court for the Buffs, av
eraging a double-double on the
year. He leads the team in re
bounds (11.3 per game) and
blocks (1.1 per game), to go along
with an average of 11.2 points.
While Roberson was the only
bright spot for the Buffs in their
first matchup against Stanford,
the Card managed to keep him
off the boards for the most part.
The Cardinal then travels to
Utah to take on the Utes in what
looks to be a favorable matchup
on paper. Utah is currently sitting
at 11th in the Pac-12 and has lost
its last seven games. Things didn't
go as smoothly as they should
have for the Card in the teams'
first matchup, as Stanford barely
managed to squeak out a 68-65
win after a late Utah charge.
Huestis carried Stanford in this

one, scoring all of his game-high
13 points in the second half.
This time around, Utah's lead
ing scorer, senior guard Josh
Watkins, will not be in uniform.
Watkins was dismissed from the
team on Jan. 17 following a num
ber of indiscretions related to his
performance and attendance in
class. Junior guard Chris Hines
has stepped up, posting 11.1
points per game following the
suspension. Stanford will also be
faced with the daunting task of
stopping 7-foot center Jason
Washburn. Washburn leads the
team in rebounds at 6.3 per game
and is second in points at 10.6, be
hind only the dismissed Watkins.
If Stanford can neutralize these
two weapons, it can coast to an
easy victory.
As the Pac-12 tournament
draws nearer, the seeding picture
becomes clearer and clearer for
the Cardinal. Stanford is current
ly sitting at seventh in the confer
ence but could easily leapfrog
sixth-place UCLA with a couple
of wins down the stretch.
Stanford will look to start with
a road victory against Colorado at
7:30 p.m. tonight.

After a tough home loss to
Oregon eliminated Stanford
from a first-place finish in the
Pac-12, the Cardinal will take to
the road for the last time in reg
ular-season play. For the first
time ever in conference play, the
Stanford basketball team (18-9,
8-7 Pac-12) is heading to the
Rocky Mountains, where it will
take on the Pac-12's two newest
additions: the Colorado Buf
faloes (18-8,10-4) and the Utah
Utes (5-21,2-12).
First up for the Card is a trip
to Boulder, where it will look to
complete a season sweep of
Buffs. Colorado has played ex
ceptionally well following its
loss to Stanford on Jan. 14, win
ning seven of its last nine games.
After being perhaps the most
controversial omission from the
NCAA tournament last year,
the Buffaloes are looking to
make a statement in their last
few conference games to earn
themselves an at-large bid in this
year's tourney. Still, it is an uphill
climb for Colorado, and they will
probably have to win each of
their final four conference
games to have a solid at-large
case.
