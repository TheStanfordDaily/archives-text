# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Scorching Stanford finally back at home 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
In the world of Division I men's volley
ball, there's a new sheriff in town: the Stan
ford Cardinal. Following a pivotal weekend
road sweep of then-No. 2 UC-Irvine and
UC-San Diego, Stanford (11-2, 8-1 MPSF)
has risen to the No. 1 spot in the national
rankings after extending its road and overall
winning streaks to seven. The wins last
weekend moved the Cardinal into a tie in
the loss column with UCLA for first place in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF), sitting just a half-game back of the
Bruins overall.
"Being No. 1 is a great honor, but it takes
a lot of work to get there and a lot of work to
stay there. It's an honor, but our goal is to be
the best team at the end of the season," head
coach John Kosty said.

Despite this successful start to the season,
navigating the MPSF can be a long and ardu
ous journey, as Kosty knows well.This week
end, the journey continues as No. 10 Pepper
dine and No. 6 USC, two highly competitive
teams, come to town in Stanford's first two
home conference matches of the season.
Stanford will take on Pepperdine (7-5,5-
4) on Friday night, a team that has gone cold
of late, losing four of its past six matches.
Flowever, the Waves were able to snap a
three-match losing streak last week in a non
conference match against Cal Baptist, and a
win against the Cardinal would cement Pep
perdine's status as an upper-tier team in the
MPSF.
Pepperdine is led by the two-headed
monster of freshman sensation Josh Taylor
and junior All-MPSF performer Maurice
Torres. Taylor is averaging 3.96 kills per set,
good for fourth in the MPSF, while Torres'

average of 3.80 is seventh in the conference.
Torres also leads the team in digs and service
aces.
Aside from Taylor and Torres, redshirt
senior Chase Ross and senior Matt Pollock
have also been important contributors for
Pepperdine. Ross is third on the team with
2.04 kills per set and also averages better
than a dig per set. Pollock ranks just fourth
on the team with 1.87 kills per set, but he
ranks first in hitting percentage at .442 and
blocks with 47. Freshman setter Matt West,
who ranks second in the conference with
11.33 assists per set, runs Pepperdine's of
fense.
Regardless of what happens against Pep
perdine on Friday, the Cardinal must come
prepared to face No. 6 USC (7-4,5-4) on Sat
urday. The Trojans are no strangers to being
