# Protecting perfection in Maples
## 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball team returns to
campus tonight as Pac-12 champions and the nation's
No. 2 team, looking to extend the nation's longest-ac
tive home winning streak against Colorado.
Stanford has not lost in Maples Pavilion since
2007, a span of 76 games and nearly five years. Until
last Saturday, Connecticut held both the longest ac
tive streak and the No. 2 spot, but a surprise 57-56
upset by St. John's capped that record at 99 wins in a
row and dropped the Huskies to No. 4.
Stanford (24-1,15-0 Pac-12) also holds one of the
nation's longest overall winning streaks at 21 games,
with only the early season loss to Connecticut spoiling
a perfect year. In contrast, after a perfect start to the
season, Colorado (16-9, 5-9) comes into this contest
having lost its last two games and five of its last six.
The last time these two teams met, the Cardinal
routed the Buffaloes 80-54 and went two games
ahead in the all-time history between the two
schools, making it 6-4. Judging by Stanford's im
provement throughout the season, and particularly
in the last handful of games, it seems unlikely that
Colorado will be able to cut into that lead on Thurs
day.
The Ogwumike sisters, senior forward Nnemkadi
and sophomore forward Chiney, continue to lead the
Cardinal with 20.6 and 16.6 points per game and 10.9
and 10.5 rebounds per game, respectively, in Pac-12
play. Recently, though, their teammates have been
stepping up as well. In last weekend's road trip to the
Oregon schools, junior forward Joslyn Tinkle led the
team in rebounds with 14 against Oregon State and
in points against Oregon with 19. It seems the team is
gelling at the perfect time of the season.
Nneka Ogwumike also has the chance to move
into second place on Stanford's all-time scoring list
tonight. She currently has 2,215 points, just 12 behind

Tonight's game against Col

homestand that will continue on
Saturday with Utah and finish

regular-season title already decid

may already be planning ahead to
the Pac-12 tournament in March
and the NCAA tournament just a
week later.
In the conference, guard
Chucky Jeffery leads the Buf
faloes in points with 13.4 and the
whole Pac-12 in steals with 3.07.
In January's meeting with the
Cardinal, even though she played
the most minutes of any Colorado
player, Jeffery was held by Stan
ford to just 1-for-10 shooting and
a single steal.
Tonight's game against Col
orado tips off at 7 p.m. in Maples
