# SOONERS AWAIT CARD IN SOCAL
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fresh off a victory at the Stanford Nike
Invitational, the No. 14 Stanford Softball
team hits the road once again to play in the
Cathedral City Classic this weekend in
Southern California.
The Cardinal (8-3) slipped six spots in
the most recent national poll after losing
in a big upset last week to unheralded UC-
Davis and then being run-ruled by Nevada
in one of five tournament games over the
weekend. But the team has a chance to
climb back up the rankings with a good
showing at the Classic.
Stanford coach John Rittman said he
was pleased with how his team has thus far
responded to the early-season setbacks.
"I like the way our team has handled a
couple of tough losses early in the year," he
said. "The high expectations of this program
can put some pressure on younger athletes,
and I think we're handling that. Overall [last
weekend], we played really well. The one
hiccup was the game against Nevada, but we
bounced back against a pretty good Bradley
team. A little bit of adversity is not a bad
thing early in the season."
With No. 6 Oklahoma on the schedule
for Friday night, Stanford is likely to face
plenty more of the adversity Rittman
talked about. The Sooners are 6-1 after
dropping a 1-0 affair to Georgia Tech at
the ACC/Big 12/ SEC Challenge, but will
bring a lot of firepower to the desert.
Catcher Jessica Shults is hitting .565
with a home run and nine RBI, and fresh
man phenom Lauren Chamberlain has
mashed opponent pitching with four
home runs and 11 RBI from the leadoff
spot.
That could pose a matchup problem for
Stanford's ace Teagan Gerhart, who has
been dominant this season, except when
giving up runs via the long ball. In order to
beat anyone, let alone Oklahoma,
Rittman said the pitchers must settle into
a real groove.
"I think our pitching needs to be a little
more consistent," he said. "Early in the
season, we always start out slow with our
pitching. We can't give away outs with hit
batsmen and walks. And we've definitely

been good in some starts, but shaky in oth
ers. I'm really looking for consistency."
Things won't be much easier for Stan
ford's lineup, however, as the Sooners
have All-American Keilani Ricketts in the
circle, and she appears to be in top form.
Ricketts carries a 3-1 record with a 0.67
ERA and 49 strikeouts in 27 innings.
Things don't get easier when she gets the
night off, however, as No. 2 starter
Michelle Gascoigne is 3-0 with a 1.29
ERA and 22 strikeouts in just 14 innings.
The Cardinal will need contributions
from up and down the lineup, not just from
the usual suspects of All-American senior
shortstop Ashley Hansen and junior sec
ond baseman Jenna Rich the two have
combined for three home runs, 19 RBI, 22
runs and almost half the team's walks this
season.
Freshmen Leah White and Hanna Win
ter must continue their impressive colle
giate debuts this weekend. White raised
her batting average to .379 with five hits at
the Stanford Nike Invitational, and Winter
is batting .395 with a team-leading 15 hits
as the starting third baseman.
But for all of the talk about the looming
"showdown" between Big 12 and Pac-12
heavyweights, Rittman said he was really
hoping his players would slow down and
stay focused on the tournament as a
whole.
"While we have a lot of leadership in
our program, we've got a lot of youth as
well. The one thing you can't do in these
tournaments is overlook anyone. [Stan
ford's first opponent] Long Island typical
ly wins that conference and has got some
kids who can really swing the bat. So we
can't look past them to get to Oklahoma.
Our upperclassmen will have to do a good
job managing all of that pressure and the
distractions."
The Cardinal opens the tourney with a
doubleheader against Long Island and
Oklahoma, before taking on Long Beach
State on Saturday night and New Mexico
State and San Diego State on Sunday. The
first pitch from Cathedral City on Friday
will be at 3:30 p.m.
