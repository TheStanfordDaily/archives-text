## Chip moves wirelessly in bloodstream 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Medical promises of the future, from
implanted microchips that help in oper
ations to full nanoscale surgeries with
single-cell precision, just got a lot closer
to reality. Stanford electrical engineering
researchers have de veloped a microchip
that can swim through fluids while pow
ered and controlled wirelessly.
At three by four millimeters, the chip
is smaller than Lincoln's head on a
penny, giving it the potential for impor
tant medical applications. The chip is in
the engineering research stage right
now, but holds promise for practical uses
in the future. With further development,
medical engineers could theoretically
outfit the chips to transmit data from in
side a patient's blood stream, enabling
precise testing, or to dispense medicine
to individual cells, enabling precise treat
ment.
Mechanical or electrical implants are
no rarity in medicine, ranging in applica
tions from prostheses to pacemakers.
However, they have met limitations
from battery technology, which general
ly progresses more slowly than electrical
circuit technology. Batteries are also
large and heavy, and they require chang
ing.

Electrical engineering researchers, led
by Ada Poon, developed a small chip
(above) capable of moving through a
fluid using wireless power. The research
holds huge promise for future developments in medicine.
Ada Poon at the International
Solid-State Circuits Conference on
Tuesday, holds promise for a whole
new category of medical devices
that don't rely on batteries for
power. Poon's team specializes in
wireless power, something previ
ously thought impossible for trans
mission through human tissue.
The team's initial breakthrough
came from advancements in engi
neering mathematics that they re
leased in 2009. The research ques
tioned the previous assumption that
only low-frequency light could
move cleanly through human tissue.
"The original research for this
happened in the 19605," Poon said.
"Then, in the 1980s and 19905, cir
cuit designers just took these re
sults, and they decided these cir
cuits ... only worked around 10
megahertz."
By reconsidering one term in
one of Maxwell's equations, which
in physics represent the mathemat
ical definition of light, Poon's re
search indicated that much higher
frequencies of light could diffuse
cleanly through various human tis
sues. Thus, wireless power with fre
quencies on the order of television
or cell phone waves could be used
to deliver power.
Higher frequencies mean small
er receiving antennas and, there
fore, wireless power delivery to
miniaturized devices.

The next breakthrough came in
finding an alternative method for
locomotion in a fluid.
Previous methods included
using small electric motors, but
these were still up to 15 centimeters
in length far too large for an im
plant. Poon's team developed a sys
tem that uses electromagnetic in
duction to roll the chip in the fluid,
generating motion in a similar man
ner to a kayak or a freestyle swim
mer as it gently rolls in the water.
A few other developments, in
cluding a low-power wireless data
transmission link, played roles in
the research as well.
The product of this research,
Poon's chip, moves very slowly
through fluids based on remote
controls and receives all its power
wirelessly.
Poon said that applications for
the technology will come both rela
tively soon and far in the future.
f n the short-term, Poon's team is
in conversations with doctors to use
the moving chips to guide catheters

into position for precise operations.
The vision for this system would in
volve outfitting the tips of catheter
tubes with locomotive chips to fine
tune their movement.
Another potential project for
the team's research involves send
ing these remote chips into a pa
tient's coronary arteries equipped
with sensors. Swimming several of
these sensors to strategic locations
in the heart could transmit data
with enough precision to make a
map of the heart's activity and de
tect irregularities.
This application would require
much more development for con
trol and movement of these chips, a
current focus for Poon's team. She
described this possibility as "mid
dle-term" in the development of
the device.

The long-term and most signifi
cant applications of this technology
will require much more develop
ment. Poon stressed that to really
change medicine, the chip would
need to be able to get feedback
from its surroundings and, for ex
ample, turn itself around if it hits a
bloodstream wall.
"If we really want to make it a
robust system, we have to add a
feedback system," Poon said.
When more advanced feedback
systems become possible on the
physical scale of Poon's current
project, more application will come
into play.
Among the most important of
these, Poon said, would be drug de
livery on a level of precision well
beyond our current capabilities,
even down to the single-cell level.
This dream, however, would re
quire answering other big ques
tions, such as how to make a cell ac
cept a microchip without dying.
"[Drug delivery] is much
longer-term," Poon said. "For now,
we want to make it into short-term,
mid-term and long-term applica
tions."

only low-frequency light could
move cleanly through human tissue.
"The original research for this
happened in the 19605," Poon said.
"Then, in the 1980s and 19905, cir
cuit designers just took these re
sults, and they decided these cir
cuits ... only worked around 10
megahertz."
By reconsidering one term in
one of Maxwell's equations, which
in physics represent the mathemat
ical definition of light, Poon's re
search indicated that much higher
frequencies of light could diffuse
cleanly through various human tis
sues. Thus, wireless power with fre
quencies on the order of television
or cell phone waves could be used
to deliver power.
Higher frequencies mean small
er receiving antennas and, there
fore, wireless power delivery to
miniaturized devices.

The next breakthrough came in
finding an alternative method for
locomotion in a fluid.
Previous methods included
using small electric motors, but
these were still up to 15 centimeters
in length far too large for an im
plant. Poon's team developed a sys
tem that uses electromagnetic in
duction to roll the chip in the fluid,
generating motion in a similar man
ner to a kayak or a freestyle swim
mer as it gently rolls in the water.
A few other developments, in
cluding a low-power wireless data
transmission link, played roles in
the research as well.
The product of this research,
Poon's chip, moves very slowly
through fluids based on remote
controls and receives all its power
wirelessly.
Poon said that applications for
the technology will come both rela
tively soon and far in the future.
f n the short-term, Poon's team is
in conversations with doctors to use
the moving chips to guide catheters

into position for precise operations.
The vision for this system would in
volve outfitting the tips of catheter
tubes with locomotive chips to fine
tune their movement.
Another potential project for
the team's research involves send
ing these remote chips into a pa
tient's coronary arteries equipped
with sensors. Swimming several of
these sensors to strategic locations
in the heart could transmit data
with enough precision to make a
map of the heart's activity and de
tect irregularities.
This application would require
much more development for con
trol and movement of these chips, a
current focus for Poon's team. She
described this possibility as "mid
dle-term" in the development of
the device.

The long-term and most signifi
cant applications of this technology
will require much more develop
ment. Poon stressed that to really
change medicine, the chip would
need to be able to get feedback
from its surroundings and, for ex
ample, turn itself around if it hits a
bloodstream wall.
"If we really want to make it a
robust system, we have to add a
feedback system," Poon said.
When more advanced feedback
systems become possible on the
physical scale of Poon's current
project, more application will come
into play.
Among the most important of
these, Poon said, would be drug de
livery on a level of precision well
beyond our current capabilities,
even down to the single-cell level.
This dream, however, would re
quire answering other big ques
tions, such as how to make a cell ac
cept a microchip without dying.
"[Drug delivery] is much
longer-term," Poon said. "For now,
we want to make it into short-term,
mid-term and long-term applica
tions."

Researchers have developed a chip that displays the capability to move
independently through a fluid using wireless power. The development
holds the potential for a new class of medical devices that can swim
through a patient's bloodstream to collect data or deliver payloads.
Medical promises of the future, from
implanted microchips that help in oper
ations to full nanoscale surgeries with
single-cell precision, just got a lot closer
to reality. Stanford electrical engineering
researchers have de veloped a microchip
that can swim through fluids while pow
ered and controlled wirelessly.
At three by four millimeters, the chip
is smaller than Lincoln's head on a
penny, giving it the potential for impor
tant medical applications. The chip is in
the engineering research stage right
now, but holds promise for practical uses
in the future. With further development,
medical engineers could theoretically
outfit the chips to transmit data from in
side a patient's blood stream, enabling
precise testing, or to dispense medicine
to individual cells, enabling precise treat
ment.
Mechanical or electrical implants are
no rarity in medicine, ranging in applica
tions from prostheses to pacemakers.
However, they have met limitations
from battery technology, which general
ly progresses more slowly than electrical
circuit technology. Batteries are also
large and heavy, and they require chang
ing.
