## Chip moves wirelessly in bloodstream 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Medical promises of the future, from
implanted microchips that help in oper
ations to full nanoscale surgeries with
single-cell precision, just got a lot closer
to reality. Stanford electrical engineering
researchers have de veloped a microchip
that can swim through fluids while pow
ered and controlled wirelessly.
At three by four millimeters, the chip
is smaller than Lincoln's head on a
penny, giving it the potential for impor
tant medical applications. The chip is in
the engineering research stage right
now, but holds promise for practical uses
in the future. With further development,
medical engineers could theoretically
outfit the chips to transmit data from in
side a patient's blood stream, enabling
precise testing, or to dispense medicine
to individual cells, enabling precise treat
ment.
Mechanical or electrical implants are
no rarity in medicine, ranging in applica
tions from prostheses to pacemakers.
However, they have met limitations
from battery technology, which general
ly progresses more slowly than electrical
circuit technology. Batteries are also
large and heavy, and they require chang
ing.
