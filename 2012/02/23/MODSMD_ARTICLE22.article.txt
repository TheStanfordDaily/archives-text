## Stanford drops third straight 
### SARAH MAISEL STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford women's
lacrosse team lost its third
straight game on Sunday, falling
17-14 to No. 20 Notre Dame. This
loss forced the Cardinal into un
familiar territory; it has already
matched its loss total from last
season just three games in.
The Irish opened the game
strong, and within 10 minutes
they were ahead 7-2. However,
the Cardinal did respond offen
sively to stay in the game. Senior
Emilie Boeri finished the period
with two goals, one off an assist
from her sister, Anna, who scored
the team's first goal and would
finish the game with a hat trick.
Sophomore Anna Kim also
scored a hat trick, and two of the
goals came before the break.
Stanford, who has yet to lead in
any of its games, began the second
period trailing 12-7.
Again, Notre Dame began the
period on attack and lead 14-8
after the first eight minutes. Even
though the last 20 minutes be

longed to the Stanford offense,
the Cardinal again fell short de
spite outplaying its opponent.
Stanford outscored the Irish 6-3
with goals from freshmen Rachel
Hinds and Kyle Fraser, sopho
more Rachel Ozer and one each
from Kim and Anna Boeri to
complete their hat tricks. The
team also outshot Notre Dame
16-12 and won 10 of 13 draw con
trols in the second period. Even
with that offensive domination,
the Cardinal only came within
two goals before eventually los
ing by three.
Sophomore Lyndsey Munoz
had a career-high 17 saves, and the
Cardinal defense combined for a
total of 23 ground balls. Notre
Dame only outshot Stanford by
two, but its early lead allowed it to
hold on despite the Cardinal's late
rally. However, Stanford turned
the ball over 26 times, mistakes the
Irish capitalized on. As it heads
into its matchup against No. 9
James Madison, its fourth-straight
game against a ranked opponent,
the Cardinal must clean up its play
in a hurry.

While the record clearly does
not reflect the level of play the
team is used to, it is still early on in
the season. In what many consid
er to be a rebuilding year, the
Cardinal has already seen many
underclassmen step up. Four
freshmen scored in Sunday's
game, and they also provided two
assists. The offense, led by the
Boeri twins, Kim and senior
Catherine Swanson, has proved it
can be a force to be reckoned
with. Munoz has continuously
kept the games as close as possi
ble and makes more saves with
every passing game.
The Cardinal cannot afford to
let its opponents take early leads.
The last two games have shown
that a late comeback bid is not
enough to overcome the damage
from the first period. Saturday's
game against the Dukes will be
another tough one, but Stanford
can build off its strong finish
against Notre Dame in hopes of
securing its first win.
