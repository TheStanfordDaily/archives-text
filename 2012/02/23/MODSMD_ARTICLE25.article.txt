Canadian defense minister
Peter MacKay spoke Wednesday
evening at the Center for Interna
tional Security and Cooperation
(CISAC) on the need for a closer
U.S.-Canadian partnership in an
age of economic and political in

According to the Hamilton

Spectator, MacKay cited the
events of the Arab Spring as one
example of the "wide-ranging se
curity requirements" that NATO

budgets in those nations decline.
That reality, MacKay said,
makes closer ties even more im

"Partners bring different assets,
capabilities and relationships to
the game," he said.
In addition to his speech,
MacKay, who was at Stanford at
the invitation of former Secretary
of State and current Hoover Insti

Rice, participated in a roundtable
discussion with the Institution's

leaders in Silicon Valley.
"Today's discussions offered a
rare opportunity to share ... what
Canada views as important on the
international stage," MacKay said,
according to a press release from
the Canadian Department of Na
tional Defence. "It was a true priv
ilege to open a dialogue with peo
ple whose work makes a tangible
impact on the world today, and
whose ideas will play a role in shap
ing the world of tomorrow."
