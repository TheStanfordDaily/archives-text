# Seth Meyers speaks on arts diversity
## Saturday Night Live star headlines IDA's "Art is My Occupation" series 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
Touching on subjects ranging
from his days doing improv shows
at Northwestern University to his
pride in telling the last Osama Bin
Laden joke at the White House
Correspondents' Dinner last
year, comedian Seth Meyers
shared the story of his career and
his perspectives on diversity in
comedy to a limited audience at
Roble Theater Wednesday. Mey
ers is best known as the head
writer for Saturday Night Live
(SNL) and the anchor for the
show's "Weekend Update" seg
ment.
Meyers came to Stanford as
part of the "Art is My Occupa
tion" guest speaker series present
ed by the Institute for Diversity in
the Arts (IDA). The series brings
in artists of various disciplines for
lunchtime conversations with stu
dents about careers in the arts.
Other guest speakers so far have
included Marc Bamuthi Joseph,
Sahr Ngaujah and MK Asante.
Asante, an author, filmmaker
and professor at Morgan State
University, spoke yesterday after
noon and stayed around after
ward to spend time with IDA
members.
"MK really got into how his
family and education influenced
and supported his artistic devel
opment," wrote Ellen Oh, IDA's
program administrator and event
proctor, in an email to The Daily.
"He also talked about how he has
been able to expand his forms of

expression from poetry to prose
to filmmaking, and he encouraged
students to never take 'no' for an
answer."
Oh wrote that Meyers had
been on the list for potential guest
speakers earlier in the year. When
she heard her old classmate was to
perform at Cal Performances at
Berkeley, she called in the favor,
and he acquiesced.
"On a personal level, it almost
felt like we had come full circle,"
Oh said. "Once upon a time, Seth
and I were college students trying
to figure out what we were going
to do with our lives, too, and I'm
sure there were a number of stu
dents in the room today who will
go on to have great artistic ca
reers."
Meyers and Oh, who proc
tored the talk, set the tone of the
event by starting out with a jab
about how Meyers broke the
heart of one of Oil's friends in col
lege.
"I was worried that this was
going to be a trap, and I was going
to come here and it was going to
be an empty room [with] this good
friend of Ellen's that I was awful
to in college," Meyers joked.
The conversation then led into
how Meyers dedicated himself to
improv at Northwestern and pur
sued this interest immediately
after college until he landed a role
as a cast member on SNL in 2001.
After Tina Fey left the show in
2006, he became head writer and
since then has contributed
tremendously to the show's out
look.

The rest of the talk focused on
the portrayal of diversity, politics
and social change in relation to
comedy writing.
In particular, Oh addressed the
recent SNL sketch on Jeremy Lin
and how comedians must walk a
careful line between being funny
and offensive,
"The thing is, when you try to
walk the line, you know if you
shoot for the line sometimes, just
by odds, you are going to end up

on the wrong side of it," Meyers
said. "You try to keep your eye on
that as much as you can."
Meyers also spoke about how
comedians can make social
change and speak to politics indi
rectly by expressing their point of
view through comedy.
"The greatest thing that makes
a comedy writer for me is a point
of view," Meyers said. "Each

work and life as an artist Wednesday afternoon in Roble Theater.
[writer] has a specific voice, and
once they start blending together,
that's when I think it becomes un
interesting."
In a question and answer ses
sion, Meyers addressed questions
about working on SNL, how com
fortable he felt making fun of Pres
ident Obama at the White House
Correspondents' Dinner and his
perspective on working alongside
female comedians.
"You want strong voices from
all different perspectives and
working with strong women just
gives the show incredible texture,"
Meyers said.
Meyers ended the event saying
that in the current economy there's
all the more reason to pursue a ca
reer that one loves since there
aren't many truly "financially se
cure" career paths.
The next guest in the IDA series
will be author Grace Lee Boggs on
March 1 at the Black House. The
series leads up to the spring quarter
course #Occupy Art: Immigration,
Nation and the Art of Occupation.

The rest of the talk focused on
the portrayal of diversity, politics

careful line between being funny
and offensive,
"The thing is, when you try to
walk the line, you know if you
shoot for the line sometimes, just
by odds, you are going to end up

on the wrong side of it," Meyers
said. "You try to keep your eye on
that as much as you can."
Meyers also spoke about how
comedians can make social
change and speak to politics indi
rectly by expressing their point of
view through comedy.
"The greatest thing that makes
a comedy writer for me is a point
of view," Meyers said. "Each

In a question and answer ses

about working on SNL, how com

Touching on subjects ranging
from his days doing improv shows
at Northwestern University to his
pride in telling the last Osama Bin
Laden joke at the White House
Correspondents' Dinner last
year, comedian Seth Meyers
shared the story of his career and
his perspectives on diversity in
comedy to a limited audience at
Roble Theater Wednesday. Mey
ers is best known as the head
writer for Saturday Night Live
(SNL) and the anchor for the
show's "Weekend Update" seg
ment.
Meyers came to Stanford as
part of the "Art is My Occupa
tion" guest speaker series present
ed by the Institute for Diversity in
the Arts (IDA). The series brings
in artists of various disciplines for
lunchtime conversations with stu
dents about careers in the arts.
Other guest speakers so far have
included Marc Bamuthi Joseph,
Sahr Ngaujah and MK Asante.
Asante, an author, filmmaker
and professor at Morgan State
University, spoke yesterday after
noon and stayed around after
ward to spend time with IDA
members.
"MK really got into how his
family and education influenced
and supported his artistic devel
opment," wrote Ellen Oh, IDA's
program administrator and event
proctor, in an email to The Daily.
"He also talked about how he has
been able to expand his forms of

expression from poetry to prose
to filmmaking, and he encouraged
students to never take 'no' for an
answer."
Oh wrote that Meyers had
been on the list for potential guest
speakers earlier in the year. When
she heard her old classmate was to
perform at Cal Performances at
Berkeley, she called in the favor,
and he acquiesced.
"On a personal level, it almost
felt like we had come full circle,"
Oh said. "Once upon a time, Seth
and I were college students trying
to figure out what we were going
to do with our lives, too, and I'm
sure there were a number of stu
dents in the room today who will
go on to have great artistic ca
reers."
Meyers and Oh, who proc
tored the talk, set the tone of the
event by starting out with a jab
about how Meyers broke the
heart of one of Oil's friends in col
lege.
"I was worried that this was
going to be a trap, and I was going
to come here and it was going to
be an empty room [with] this good
friend of Ellen's that I was awful
to in college," Meyers joked.
The conversation then led into
how Meyers dedicated himself to
improv at Northwestern and pur
sued this interest immediately
after college until he landed a role
as a cast member on SNL in 2001.
After Tina Fey left the show in
2006, he became head writer and
since then has contributed
