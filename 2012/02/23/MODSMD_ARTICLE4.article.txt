## McDonald House receives zoning approval 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The Ronald McDonald House at Stan
ford is moving forward with plans to double
the size of its facilities following rezoning
approval from the Palo Alto City Council on
Feb. 13. The proposed three-story building
will add around 46,000 square feet of floor
area and enough rooms for 68 additional
families every night. The House currently
accommodates 47 families and operates at

capacity nearly every night.
The prospective property, which Palo
Alto previously classified as a "Landscape
Reserve area," is vacant except for a pedes
trian path, according to the Palo Alto City
Council staff report. The lot is adjacent to
the current Ronald McDonald House at 520
Sand Hill Road.
The Palo Alto City Council rezoning ini
tiation was just the first step of a complex ap
proval process that the House must undergo
before construction on the new facilities can

begin. The House's development director
Linda Lyon said the House hopes to begin
construction by next spring, although the
timing is uncertain.
"This will allow for them to start generat
ing the planning process for the expansion of
the Ronald McDonald House," City Council
Member Nancy Shepard said of the rezon
ing approval. "[But] we haven't approved, of
course, any plans to build."
The Ronald McDonald House
at Stanford offers housing and
support to the families of children
with life-threatening illnesses
who are receiving specialized
treatment at the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital of the Stan
ford Medical Center. One of 315
worldwide, the House allows par
ents to stay near their children
while they are undergoing treat
ment and strives to provide a
strong sense of community for pa
tients and their families.
However, because the demand
for space has dramatically in
creased over the last 10 years, the
House must reject thousands of
requests every year. Lyon said
that the number of housing re
quests has increased because of
innovations in life-saving tech
nologies, particularly for children.
Patients who used to be consid
ered terminal are now being
treated and are recovering.
Now, the average stay is about
24 nights, as compared with six
nights in 2002. According to Lyon,
the organization turned away an
average of 10 to 20 families every
night in 2010, and the number is
expected to rise with the upcom
ing expansion of the Children's
Hospital, to be completed by Dec.
2016.
"[We have] better medical
technology treating sicker kids,"
Lyon said. "[And] we are seeing
that a lot of patients are being
treated on an outpatient basis for
conditions that used to require in
patient stays."
"Keeping their family mem
bers close, including their siblings,
for some duration of time is im
portant," she added.
Although the current building
plans have been in development
since this fall, the development
team at the Ronald McDonald

House has been considering ex
pansion for over six years, Lyon
said.
To analyze future need, the
team worked with a third-party
medical strategic planning com
pany in partnership with the Hos
pital. The House projected a need
for 65 to 70 more rooms to accom
modate outpatient demand; once
the new facilities are built, Lyon

said they hope that they won't
have to turn anyone away.
The increase in the number of
families staying at the House at
any one time will also increase the
need for volunteers.
"Our expectation would be
that we would need to probably
double the number of volunteers
to staff the new House," Lyon
said. "We would need significant

support from Stanford and the
community."
In the current facility, the or
ganization uses over 150 volun
teers every week, which saves the
House about $300,000 in labor
costs, according to Lyon.
Lyon noted that the House's
current operations will continue
regardless of the plans for expan
sion.

"[Expansion] is definitely un
derway, and it is such a valuable
and needed project that it will
definitely move forward," she
said. "Our main, core service is
providing the home away from
home it's our housing. That, of
course, will continue,"

Stanford's Ronald McDonald House, amid plans to expand onto an adjacent property, received rezoning approval from the Palo Alto City Council. The House will more than double its capacity to shelter families of children being treated at Lucille Packard Children's Hospital.
The Ronald McDonald House at Stan
ford is moving forward with plans to double
the size of its facilities following rezoning
approval from the Palo Alto City Council on
Feb. 13. The proposed three-story building
will add around 46,000 square feet of floor
area and enough rooms for 68 additional
families every night. The House currently
accommodates 47 families and operates at

capacity nearly every night.
The prospective property, which Palo
Alto previously classified as a "Landscape
Reserve area," is vacant except for a pedes
trian path, according to the Palo Alto City
Council staff report. The lot is adjacent to
the current Ronald McDonald House at 520
Sand Hill Road.
The Palo Alto City Council rezoning ini
tiation was just the first step of a complex ap
proval process that the House must undergo
before construction on the new facilities can

begin. The House's development director
Linda Lyon said the House hopes to begin
construction by next spring, although the
timing is uncertain.
"This will allow for them to start generat
ing the planning process for the expansion of
the Ronald McDonald House," City Council
Member Nancy Shepard said of the rezon
ing approval. "[But] we haven't approved, of
course, any plans to build."
The Ronald McDonald House
at Stanford offers housing and
support to the families of children
with life-threatening illnesses
who are receiving specialized
treatment at the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital of the Stan
ford Medical Center. One of 315
worldwide, the House allows par
ents to stay near their children
while they are undergoing treat
ment and strives to provide a
strong sense of community for pa
tients and their families.
However, because the demand
for space has dramatically in
creased over the last 10 years, the
House must reject thousands of
requests every year. Lyon said
that the number of housing re
quests has increased because of
innovations in life-saving tech
nologies, particularly for children.
Patients who used to be consid
ered terminal are now being
treated and are recovering.
Now, the average stay is about
24 nights, as compared with six
nights in 2002. According to Lyon,
the organization turned away an
average of 10 to 20 families every
night in 2010, and the number is
expected to rise with the upcom
ing expansion of the Children's
Hospital, to be completed by Dec.
2016.
"[We have] better medical
technology treating sicker kids,"
Lyon said. "[And] we are seeing
that a lot of patients are being
treated on an outpatient basis for
conditions that used to require in
patient stays."
"Keeping their family mem
bers close, including their siblings,
for some duration of time is im
portant," she added.
Although the current building
plans have been in development
since this fall, the development
team at the Ronald McDonald

House has been considering ex
pansion for over six years, Lyon
said.
To analyze future need, the
team worked with a third-party
medical strategic planning com
pany in partnership with the Hos
pital. The House projected a need
for 65 to 70 more rooms to accom
modate outpatient demand; once
the new facilities are built, Lyon

said they hope that they won't
have to turn anyone away.
The increase in the number of
families staying at the House at
any one time will also increase the
need for volunteers.
"Our expectation would be
that we would need to probably
double the number of volunteers
to staff the new House," Lyon
said. "We would need significant

support from Stanford and the
community."
In the current facility, the or
ganization uses over 150 volun
teers every week, which saves the
House about $300,000 in labor
costs, according to Lyon.
Lyon noted that the House's
current operations will continue
regardless of the plans for expan
sion.

"[Expansion] is definitely un
derway, and it is such a valuable
and needed project that it will
definitely move forward," she
said. "Our main, core service is
providing the home away from
home it's our housing. That, of
course, will continue,"
