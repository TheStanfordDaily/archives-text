## McDonald House receives zoning approval 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The Ronald McDonald House at Stan
ford is moving forward with plans to double
the size of its facilities following rezoning
approval from the Palo Alto City Council on
Feb. 13. The proposed three-story building
will add around 46,000 square feet of floor
area and enough rooms for 68 additional
families every night. The House currently
accommodates 47 families and operates at

capacity nearly every night.
The prospective property, which Palo
Alto previously classified as a "Landscape
Reserve area," is vacant except for a pedes
trian path, according to the Palo Alto City
Council staff report. The lot is adjacent to
the current Ronald McDonald House at 520
Sand Hill Road.
The Palo Alto City Council rezoning ini
tiation was just the first step of a complex ap
proval process that the House must undergo
before construction on the new facilities can

begin. The House's development director
Linda Lyon said the House hopes to begin
construction by next spring, although the
timing is uncertain.
"This will allow for them to start generat
ing the planning process for the expansion of
the Ronald McDonald House," City Council
Member Nancy Shepard said of the rezon
ing approval. "[But] we haven't approved, of
course, any plans to build."
