## Kadhim traces history of rebellion in Islam 
### MARWA FARAG MANAGING EDITOR 
Revolution, rebellion and
justice in Islam were the central
themes of a Wednesday
evening lecture by Abbas Kad
him, an expert on Islamic theol
ogy. Kadhim is a visiting scholar
at Stanford and assistant pro
fessor of national security af
fairs at the Naval Postgraduate
School in Monterey, Calif.
Kadhim approached the
subject historically, starting
with the birth of Islam on the
Arabian Peninsula in the early
seventh century.
"If we were to look at Islam
at the very essence of it, it was a
form of rebellion," Kadhim
said. "[The prophet] Muham
mad was not so much interest
ed in making people worship
God. The main goal was to fight
the injustice of the cutthroat so
ciety that was established ...
when Muhammad began to dis
seminate his message of Islam."
During the early ages of
Islam, particularly during the
life of Muhammad, politics and
religion were held in one hand.
"Islam is a religion that was
built on the idea of rendering

authority to God and to those
who would represent God in
the Muslim society," Kadhim
said. "It represented itself as a
state and as a religion."
He explained how the struc
ture of authority evolved in the
Muslim state following the
death of Muhammad.
"Muslims were accustomed
to the idea that Muhammad
was the head of the state and
the religion and was divinely
designated," Kadhim said.
This distinction was not ac
corded his successors, the four
caliphs who ruled until the late
seventh century and the leaders
of Islam's Imperial period.
Rebellions during this phase
are "not looked upon kindly by
Islamic history," according to
Kadhim.
"The history of Islam
looked at... rebellion [under
the first caliph] as 100 percent
wrong and very severe," Kad
him said.
Kadhim went on to explain
the move toward legitimization
of rebellion in the Islamic tradi
tion throughout the following
century, noting the reign and
death of the fourth Caliph Ali and
the Battle of Karbala as main
turning points.
"[Under the caliphs] there was
religion and politics in one hand
with the idea that there is ijtihad
someone who does his very
best to come up with the best an
swer, but all second best to the
Prophet," he said. "With the death
of Ali, [we] started seeing for the
first time in Islam a separation of
religion and state."
Kadhim emphasized that sepa
ration in this context is not the Eu
ropean understanding of the sepa
ration of church and state.
"There was a religious authori
ty that did not meddle in politics
and a state authority that did not
pretend to know anything about
religion," he said.
This split gave rise to tensions
between the religious and the po
litical authority, which escalated
during the Imperial period of
Islam.
Kadhim deemed the battle of
Karbala the defining moment of
Islam's position toward rebellion.
The battle, which took place in 680

A.D. between rulers of the
Umayyad empire and Hussein, a
descendant of Muhammad, result
ed in the victory of the former.
"Up to the moment of Karbala,
you had a consensus among the in
tellectuals ... that you were not
allowed to rebel against the rulers.
That was the going jurisprudence
up to that point," Kadhim said,
lire complications introduced by
the fact that the rebels were de
scendants of the prophet forced a
revision, ultimately legitimizing
rebellion.
"Hussein is the father of legiti
mate revolution in Islam," he
noted.
Moving into the modern era,
Kadhim stressed that the prob
lems of the legitimacy of rebellion
in the Islamic faith remain a cen
tral issue.
He drew a distinction between
Sunni and Shiite understandings
of rebellion. Shiite Muslims, he
said, do not grant any one ruler ab
solute legitimacy, thus allowing for
rebellion.
"For Sunni groups, the only
qualification for a ruler is to be a
Muslim ... to defend the land of
Islam and to administer the laws,"
he said. "The simple solution [for a
rebellion against a ruler] is to de
clare him a non-Muslim and then
fight him."

"The problem is in the method
ology of the jurisprudence and the
idea of the sacred," Kadhim said.
He closed his lecture with a call
for a renewal of the Islamic theo
logical debate.
"Muslims are the only nation
on earth who think that their best
days are behind them, that the best
generation was the generation of
the Prophet," he said. "Why do we
close our mind at the seventh or
eighth century? Why are [theolo
gians] more authoritative than us?
The moment you say that our best

days are behind us ... you are in
the shackles of that old jurispru
dence, and you have to deal with it
in away that doesn't make much
sense in the 21st Century."
Members of the audience
posed questions on the effect of
the colonial era on Islamic
thought, particular rebellions dur
ing the era of the caliphs and the
relationship between Islam and
democracy.
"The essential difference be
tween Islam and democracy is that
democracy gives sovereignty to

the people while Islam gives sov
ereignty to God," Kadhim said.
"Islam is good governance, but
good governance is not necessari
ly democracy."
The event was co-sponsored by
the Muslim Student Awareness
Network (MSAN) and the Islam
ic Society of Stanford University
(ISSU) as part of the 2012 "Islam

ness Series.

ed in the victory of the former.
"Up to the moment of Karbala,
you had a consensus among the in
tellectuals ... that you were not
allowed to rebel against the rulers.
That was the going jurisprudence
up to that point," Kadhim said,
lire complications introduced by
the fact that the rebels were de
scendants of the prophet forced a
revision, ultimately legitimizing
rebellion.
"Hussein is the father of legiti
mate revolution in Islam," he
noted.
Moving into the modern era,
Kadhim stressed that the prob
lems of the legitimacy of rebellion
in the Islamic faith remain a cen
tral issue.
He drew a distinction between
Sunni and Shiite understandings
of rebellion. Shiite Muslims, he
said, do not grant any one ruler ab
solute legitimacy, thus allowing for
rebellion.
"For Sunni groups, the only
qualification for a ruler is to be a
Muslim ... to defend the land of
Islam and to administer the laws,"
he said. "The simple solution [for a
rebellion against a ruler] is to de
clare him a non-Muslim and then
fight him."

"The problem is in the method
ology of the jurisprudence and the
idea of the sacred," Kadhim said.
He closed his lecture with a call
for a renewal of the Islamic theo
logical debate.
"Muslims are the only nation
on earth who think that their best
days are behind them, that the best
generation was the generation of
the Prophet," he said. "Why do we
close our mind at the seventh or
eighth century? Why are [theolo
gians] more authoritative than us?
The moment you say that our best

days are behind us ... you are in
the shackles of that old jurispru
dence, and you have to deal with it
in away that doesn't make much
sense in the 21st Century."
Members of the audience
posed questions on the effect of
the colonial era on Islamic
thought, particular rebellions dur
ing the era of the caliphs and the
relationship between Islam and
democracy.
"The essential difference be
tween Islam and democracy is that
democracy gives sovereignty to

the people while Islam gives sov
ereignty to God," Kadhim said.
"Islam is good governance, but
good governance is not necessari
ly democracy."

Revolution, rebellion and
justice in Islam were the central
themes of a Wednesday
evening lecture by Abbas Kad
him, an expert on Islamic theol
ogy. Kadhim is a visiting scholar
at Stanford and assistant pro
fessor of national security af
fairs at the Naval Postgraduate
School in Monterey, Calif.
Kadhim approached the
subject historically, starting
with the birth of Islam on the
Arabian Peninsula in the early
seventh century.
"If we were to look at Islam
at the very essence of it, it was a
form of rebellion," Kadhim
said. "[The prophet] Muham
mad was not so much interest
ed in making people worship
God. The main goal was to fight
the injustice of the cutthroat so
ciety that was established ...
when Muhammad began to dis
seminate his message of Islam."
During the early ages of
Islam, particularly during the
life of Muhammad, politics and
religion were held in one hand.
"Islam is a religion that was
built on the idea of rendering

authority to God and to those
who would represent God in
the Muslim society," Kadhim
said. "It represented itself as a
state and as a religion."
He explained how the struc
ture of authority evolved in the
Muslim state following the
death of Muhammad.
"Muslims were accustomed
to the idea that Muhammad
was the head of the state and
the religion and was divinely
designated," Kadhim said.
This distinction was not ac
corded his successors, the four
caliphs who ruled until the late
seventh century and the leaders
of Islam's Imperial period.
Rebellions during this phase
are "not looked upon kindly by
Islamic history," according to
Kadhim.
"The history of Islam
looked at... rebellion [under
the first caliph] as 100 percent
wrong and very severe," Kad
him said.
Kadhim went on to explain
the move toward legitimization
of rebellion in the Islamic tradi
tion throughout the following
century, noting the reign and
death of the fourth Caliph Ali and
the Battle of Karbala as main
turning points.
"[Under the caliphs] there was
religion and politics in one hand
with the idea that there is ijtihad
someone who does his very
best to come up with the best an
swer, but all second best to the
Prophet," he said. "With the death
of Ali, [we] started seeing for the
first time in Islam a separation of
religion and state."
Kadhim emphasized that sepa
ration in this context is not the Eu
ropean understanding of the sepa
ration of church and state.
"There was a religious authori
ty that did not meddle in politics
and a state authority that did not
pretend to know anything about
religion," he said.
This split gave rise to tensions
between the religious and the po
litical authority, which escalated
during the Imperial period of
Islam.
Kadhim deemed the battle of
Karbala the defining moment of
Islam's position toward rebellion.
The battle, which took place in 680

A.D. between rulers of the
Umayyad empire and Hussein, a
descendant of Muhammad, result
ed in the victory of the former.
"Up to the moment of Karbala,
