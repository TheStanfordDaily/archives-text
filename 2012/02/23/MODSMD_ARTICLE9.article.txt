## TAGALOG TO THAI For some Stanford students, special languages hold stronger appeal than mainstream choices 
### KADEN FREEMAN 
Uzbek, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Hun
garian, Tagalog and American
Sign Language are just some
of nearly 20 special languages
offered at Stanford that fulfill
the one-year language requirement. While
the most popular languages are Spanish,
Chinese, Japanese, French, Italian, German
and Arabic, in that order, according to the
Stanford Language Center's 2010 annual
report, other languages hold greater appeal
for certain students. The Special Language
Program gives students the opportunity to
study these lesser-taught languages.
According to the Stanford Language
Center, the language requirement, initiated
in 1995, exists to "prepare students to have
a foreign language capability that enhances
their academic program and enables them
to live, work, study and research in a differ
ent country."
Students who pursue special languages
often do so because of an academic or per
sonal interest in a geographic area and its
people or because they are interested in ac
quiring valuable skills for fieldwork and

study abroad in these areas.
"The dissertation topic I have chosen to
pursue deals with the dynamic between the
nationalities of Transylvania (now part of
Romania) during the inter-war period,"
states a testimonial on the Special Lan
guages website from a student who studied
Romanian to access archival material for
her dissertation. "As such, a solid knowl
edge of spoken and written Romanian is
necessary for research of the kind I have
planned."
Provided there is sufficient interest and
funding available, the University also offers
new language classes upon request.
A case in point is this year's introduction
of Yoruba, a West African language, after a
group of Nigerian-American students peti
tioned for its implementation.
Tayo Amos 'l4, who is studying Yoruba,
was impressed that the University listened
to the students' request.
"It was just astounding to me," she said.
"It's hard to find another school that does
that."
Besides Yoruba, Amos has taken both
Spanish and Catalan, a language spoken in
some regions of Spain, at Stanford.
"I knew I wanted to study abroad in

Barcelona, and I knew they spoke Catalan
there, so I wanted to get a head start," she said.
Amos said that her experience learning
Catalan, which is not under the Special
Languages Program, was a positive one.
Nina Papachristou 'l4, who studied
Swahili at Stanford, shared this sentiment
about her experience studying language at
Stanford.
"With a special language like Swahili,
the syllabus is much more flexible," she
said. "Now that I am at an advanced level,
the other students and I can suggest differ
ent things for the syllabus than what the
teacher might have chosen at the beginning
of the quarter."
Papachristou, who has also taken
French at Stanford, noted a difference in
subject matter between language classes
outside the Special Language Program
compared to those within it.
"With special languages, there is a lot
more of an emphasis on learning the cul
ture of the place where the language is spo
ken," she said. "For example, we learn
about East African methods of nonverbal
communication or how Swahili weddings
are conducted."
Jason Kaufman 'l4, who studied Hindi,

had a similar experience. He has also taken
French at Stanford, but said he preferred
the teaching style of his Hindi class.
"The [Hindi] class did not just focus on
vocabulary and grammar, but also the cul
ture in India," he said.
Additionally, Kaufman pointed out that
one of the benefits of taking a special lan
guage is the small size of the classes, which
allows for more individualized attention
for each student.
However, according to Papachristou,
learning a less common language does have
some unique challenges.
"The most challenging thing about
learning Swahili is having nobody to prac
tice with," she said. "The only real way to
improve my speaking abilities is to spend
time in Kenya and Tanzania."
Kaufman agreed that picking up a spe
cial language can be especially hard.
"A weakness of the [Hindi] program last
year was that we only had class two days a
week," he said. "However, this year Begin
ning Hindi is five days a week, which sug
gests the program is improving."

Nina Papachristou 'l4, who studied
Swahili at Stanford, shared this sentiment
about her experience studying language at
Stanford.
"With a special language like Swahili,
the syllabus is much more flexible," she
said. "Now that I am at an advanced level,
the other students and I can suggest differ
ent things for the syllabus than what the
teacher might have chosen at the beginning
of the quarter."
Papachristou, who has also taken
French at Stanford, noted a difference in
subject matter between language classes
outside the Special Language Program
compared to those within it.
"With special languages, there is a lot
more of an emphasis on learning the cul
ture of the place where the language is spo
ken," she said. "For example, we learn
about East African methods of nonverbal
communication or how Swahili weddings
are conducted."
Jason Kaufman 'l4, who studied Hindi,

had a similar experience. He has also taken
French at Stanford, but said he preferred
the teaching style of his Hindi class.
"The [Hindi] class did not just focus on
vocabulary and grammar, but also the cul
ture in India," he said.
Additionally, Kaufman pointed out that
one of the benefits of taking a special lan
guage is the small size of the classes, which
allows for more individualized attention
for each student.
However, according to Papachristou,
learning a less common language does have
some unique challenges.
"The most challenging thing about
learning Swahili is having nobody to prac
tice with," she said. "The only real way to
improve my speaking abilities is to spend
time in Kenya and Tanzania."
Kaufman agreed that picking up a spe
cial language can be especially hard.
"A weakness of the [Hindi] program last
year was that we only had class two days a
week," he said. "However, this year Begin
ning Hindi is five days a week, which sug
gests the program is improving."
