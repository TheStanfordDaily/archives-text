# SOCC endorsement process kicks-off
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Julia Enthoven 
The Students of Color Coali
tion (SOCC) hosted an informa
tion session Thursday to discuss
their endorsement process for
ASSU candidates. About 15 atten
dees, almost entirely freshman, ex
pressed interest in running for the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate

during the meeting.
SOCC is a coalition of six cul
tural, racial or ethnic student
groups who promote on-campus
diversity, support cultural centers,
address acts of intolerance and
maintain funds for the Voluntary
Student Organizations (VSOs)
under their umbrella. The group is
comprised of co-chairs from the
Asian American Students' Asso
ciation (AASA), Black Student
Union (BSU), Movimiento Estu
diantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA), Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN),
the National Association of for
the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP) and Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO).
Each year, SOCC chooses to
endorse up to 15 candidates for the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate. If
the group decides to give an en
dorsement for the ASSU Execu
tive this year, they will endorse
only one slate, according to AASA
community liaison Tina Duong
'l2.
Candidates for the ASSU Ex
ecutive Robbie Zimbroff 'l2, with
running mate William Wagstaff, Jr.
'l2, and Brianna Pang 'l3, with
running-mate Dan DeLong 'l3,
also attended. Pang, current Ap
propriations Chair for the ASSU
Senate, was endorsed last year by
SOCC.
"We look for senators who are
going to fight for the issues that we
have presented, and who show
that passion for it," said Rafael
Vasquez 'l2, current Senate chair
and liaison for MEChA.
With wide access to the Stan
ford undergraduate community,
the SOCC endorsement can great
ly aid candidates with publicity.
Last year, 12 out of the 15 stu
dents elected to the ASSU Under
graduate Senate were endorsed by
SOCC, in addition to current
ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2
and Vice President Stewart Mac
gregor-Dennis 'l3.
"SOCC also provides a support
network through the year," Cruz
said at Thursday's information ses
sion. "[When] doing the work,
doing elections, [you have] people
that you can trust and know to give
feedback, to help you out with
your projects."
SOCC also provides work
shops for its candidates that help
with the campaigning process.
SOCC endorsement applica
tions are due by March 2.
