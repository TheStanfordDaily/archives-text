## EDITORIAL The 						founder's syndrome at Stanford 
### 
Recall, if you will, your first
visit to Stanford. Perhaps
you were an ambitious,
awkward high school junior shuf
fling starry-eyed through an offi
cial tour. Maybe you were fleeing
the stresses of impending AP
tests by attending Admit Week
end. Regardless, it's a safe bet that
somewhere along the way, some
one excitedly told you about the
diverse opportunities available to
undergraduates, epitomized by
the 600-plus student groups on
campus. Yet how many student
groups are active and adding
value to Stanford? A tenth? A
third? The sheer number of stu
dent groups created every quar
ter raises questions about
whether each group truly serves a
well-defined and unique pur
pose.

Though Stanford students like
to brag about the humility of
campus culture, the abundance of
voluntary student organizations
(VSOs) seems to challenge this
ideal. No amount of tanning on
the Oval can undo the ambitious
mentality of achievement that led
many of us to Stanford. Students
who apply for prestigious post
graduate scholarships or employ
ment know that selection com
mittees look favorably upon indi
viduals who have founded new
organizations. As a result, the
campus framework for entrepre
neurship tends to reify initiatives
that are new and revolutionary,
fitting neatly into the rhetoric of
innovation.

Part of the problem lies in the
way new VSOs are often found
ed; a great deal of focus is placed
on launching the initiative, but
comparatively little time is in
vested in building a sustainable
organizational infrastructure. As
a result, once the enthusiastic
founders graduate, many VSOs
decline and eventually become
inactive. Creating new student
groups is not inherently problem
atic, but the impulse to found new
organizations often leads to
groups that duplicate each oth-

ers' missions. This problem is not
unique to Stanford indeed, it
is common in nonprofits all over
the world, and it stems from the
hubris inherent in a founding
mentality. By being more cog
nizant about the dynamics of sus
tainable versus unsustainable
student groups, VSO leaders can
mitigate this problem.
Resolving this issue is difficult,
as it means shifting the focus of
Stanford culture from one that
exalts the founders of new enti
ties to one that gives credit to
those who breathe new life into
existing organizations a far
less glamorous role. Yet while en
trepreneurship, as embodied in
the current campus mentality, is
the source of the problem, it may
also be the solution. Reviving
struggling student groups re
quires entrepreneurial skills at
the highest level aggressive
fundraising and recruiting, adept
management and passionate vi
sion. A truly entrepreneurial
campus would place as much em
phasis and value on sustaining
and reviving existing student
groups as it does upon founding
new ones. This means having the
humility to recognize the value in
realizing other people's ideas, as
well as one's own.
Stanford students are infatuat
ed with the rhetoric of entrepre
neurship, but this means that en
trepreneurship is defined in dan
gerously narrow terms. The Edito
rial Board recommends that the
ASSU execute a comprehensive
review of VSOs, identifying areas
where student groups can com
bine or collaborate. This process
would allow the ASSU to conduct
a needs assessment of student
group resource needs, as well as an
evaluation of the ASSU's own
successes and failures in aiding
VSOs. The hundreds of VSOs on
campus offer a false promise to
prospective students. By focusing
on quality, rather than quantity,
Stanford can build an entrepre
neurial culture that is both effec
tive and sustainable.

ed; a great deal of focus is placed
on launching the initiative, but
comparatively little time is in
vested in building a sustainable
organizational infrastructure. As
a result, once the enthusiastic
founders graduate, many VSOs
decline and eventually become
inactive. Creating new student
groups is not inherently problem
atic, but the impulse to found new
organizations often leads to
groups that duplicate each oth-

ers' missions. This problem is not
unique to Stanford indeed, it
is common in nonprofits all over
the world, and it stems from the
hubris inherent in a founding
mentality. By being more cog
nizant about the dynamics of sus
tainable versus unsustainable
student groups, VSO leaders can
mitigate this problem.
Resolving this issue is difficult,
as it means shifting the focus of
Stanford culture from one that
exalts the founders of new enti
ties to one that gives credit to
those who breathe new life into
existing organizations a far
less glamorous role. Yet while en
trepreneurship, as embodied in
the current campus mentality, is
the source of the problem, it may
also be the solution. Reviving
struggling student groups re
quires entrepreneurial skills at
the highest level aggressive
fundraising and recruiting, adept
management and passionate vi
sion. A truly entrepreneurial
campus would place as much em
phasis and value on sustaining
and reviving existing student
groups as it does upon founding
new ones. This means having the
humility to recognize the value in
realizing other people's ideas, as
well as one's own.
Stanford students are infatuat
ed with the rhetoric of entrepre
neurship, but this means that en
trepreneurship is defined in dan
gerously narrow terms. The Edito
rial Board recommends that the
ASSU execute a comprehensive
review of VSOs, identifying areas
where student groups can com
bine or collaborate. This process
would allow the ASSU to conduct
a needs assessment of student
group resource needs, as well as an
evaluation of the ASSU's own
successes and failures in aiding
VSOs. The hundreds of VSOs on
campus offer a false promise to
prospective students. By focusing
on quality, rather than quantity,
Stanford can build an entrepre
neurial culture that is both effec
tive and sustainable.
