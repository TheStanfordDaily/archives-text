## The 						occupation is not kosher 
### ITAIFARHI '14 Students for Palestinian Equal Rights 
The Stanford campus has re
cently mobilized around the
topic of "eviction": ChiTheta
Chi's, of course. With a petition cur
rently standing at 2,056 signatures
[at the time of publication], this
community action should show us
what can happen when students
care. Although the sudden revoca
tion of the lease for a Stanford
house is surely a cause for alarm, it
seems painfully banal to remind
ourselves that it is "evictions" like
these, albeit with more violence
and less notice, that are a constant
reality for all who are subject to
home demolitions in the Occupied
Territories of Palestine.
As in so many cases of systemat
ic oppression, no one is neutral in
this conflict. Refusing to engage
means, at best, uncritically arming
the Israeli occupation with our tu
ition dollars, and indirectly ensur
ing that Middle East conflict will
continue to stagnate.
As students, the kinds of change
we can effect are indirect. Stanford's
endowment is valued in the top five
among universities, and any deci
sion to follow SPER's call to divest
would raise the symbolic and eco
nomic costs of occupation for Israel.
I approach this issue as a Jew,
and as a citizen and supporter of Is
rael. I feel it is my obligation to de
fend Israel the best I can, and I see
no better way than honestly recog
nizing its faults and urging it to im
prove. By continuing to engage in
rights-violating practices, Israel is
distancing itself from the interna

tional community and failing to
solve its real problems chief
among them the so-called "demo
graphic threat."
It is clear that Israel cannot con
tinue indefinitely on its current
track of allowing illegal settlements
and legislating ethnic and religious
discrimination. However one slices
the demographic data, Israel can
not count on Jews remaining a ma
jority in the coming years. As
Michael Oren, the Israeli ambassa
dor to the United States, put it: "Is
rael, the Jewish State, is predicated
on a decisive and stable Jewish ma
jority of at least 70 percent. Any
lower than that and Israel will have
to decide between being a Jewish
state and a democratic state."
Divestment from the U.S. ally
may be 'tough love,' but being a
friend to Israel entails not accept
ing its behavior as given. Any stu
dent of history knows that disen
franchising a population from a mi
nority position is not a strategy that
can survive the long term.
Today, anyone seeking a better
future for Palestinians will likely
hear, "Why focus on Israel? Aren't
there other nations, even in the re
gion, that violate rights?" This re
sponse is undeniably true, but it
misses the point.
The Baker-Hamilton report on
Iraq expresses the near-consensus
position that no end to the Middle
Eastern conflicts can be imagined
without resolving the situation in
Israel. As the report states, "The
United States cannot achieve its

goals in the Middle East unless it
deals directly with the Arab-Israeli
conflict." Among other conse
quences, the centrality of Israel has
meant that many regional regimes
have been able to redirect atten
tion away from their own repres
sive practices toward the conflict.
Moreover, Israel is itself singled
out by American policy. Consider
that the United States gives ap
proximately a third of its aid, more
than the combined total of aid to
Latin America and Africa, to a
country with under one thousandth
of the world's population and a rel
atively high GDP per capita.
Asking the University not to
throw its substantial financial and
symbolic weight behind companies
that directly support human rights

abuses, SPER's petition urges di
vestment only from companies that
engage in four criteria of practices
in the occupied territories: (1) facil
itation of acts of collective punish
ment (home demolition, land con
fiscation, and military action
against civilians), (2) operation
within occupier-only settlements,
(3) maintenance of a "separation
barrier" and (4) institutional dis
crimination against any people of a
certain race, ethnicity or religion.
These criteria are universal in
scope and can be applied to other
conflicts as foundational principles
of ethical investing. This approach
does not come down on any side of
the issue; calling for a principled di
vestment from rights-abusers is no
more pro-Palestinian than refusing

to deal with unethical diamond
companies is pro-Congolese. Sup
porting divestment commits its
supporters to no "side" except the
right side of history.
As students, we can act when we
sense injustice. The call for divest
ment is not "radical"; this form of
grassroots, non-violent action has
extensive precedents both on this
campus and on others like it. Stan
ford's own Statement on Invest
ment Responsibility pledges to di
vest from any companies that
"cause substantial social injury."
SPER's petition demands only that
Stanford commit in practice to the
values it claims to uphold.

track of allowing illegal settlements
and legislating ethnic and religious
discrimination. However one slices
the demographic data, Israel can
not count on Jews remaining a ma
jority in the coming years. As
Michael Oren, the Israeli ambassa
dor to the United States, put it: "Is
rael, the Jewish State, is predicated
on a decisive and stable Jewish ma
jority of at least 70 percent. Any
lower than that and Israel will have
to decide between being a Jewish
state and a democratic state."
Divestment from the U.S. ally
may be 'tough love,' but being a
friend to Israel entails not accept
ing its behavior as given. Any stu
dent of history knows that disen
franchising a population from a mi
nority position is not a strategy that
can survive the long term.
Today, anyone seeking a better
future for Palestinians will likely
hear, "Why focus on Israel? Aren't
there other nations, even in the re
gion, that violate rights?" This re
sponse is undeniably true, but it
misses the point.
The Baker-Hamilton report on
Iraq expresses the near-consensus
position that no end to the Middle
Eastern conflicts can be imagined
without resolving the situation in
Israel. As the report states, "The
United States cannot achieve its

goals in the Middle East unless it
deals directly with the Arab-Israeli
conflict." Among other conse
quences, the centrality of Israel has
meant that many regional regimes
have been able to redirect atten
tion away from their own repres
sive practices toward the conflict.
Moreover, Israel is itself singled
out by American policy. Consider
that the United States gives ap
proximately a third of its aid, more
than the combined total of aid to
Latin America and Africa, to a
country with under one thousandth
of the world's population and a rel
atively high GDP per capita.
Asking the University not to
throw its substantial financial and
symbolic weight behind companies
that directly support human rights

abuses, SPER's petition urges di
vestment only from companies that
engage in four criteria of practices
in the occupied territories: (1) facil
itation of acts of collective punish
ment (home demolition, land con
fiscation, and military action
against civilians), (2) operation
within occupier-only settlements,
(3) maintenance of a "separation
barrier" and (4) institutional dis
crimination against any people of a
certain race, ethnicity or religion.
These criteria are universal in
scope and can be applied to other
conflicts as foundational principles
of ethical investing. This approach
does not come down on any side of
the issue; calling for a principled di
vestment from rights-abusers is no
more pro-Palestinian than refusing

to deal with unethical diamond
companies is pro-Congolese. Sup
porting divestment commits its
supporters to no "side" except the
right side of history.
As students, we can act when we
sense injustice. The call for divest
ment is not "radical"; this form of
grassroots, non-violent action has
extensive precedents both on this
campus and on others like it. Stan
ford's own Statement on Invest
ment Responsibility pledges to di
vest from any companies that
"cause substantial social injury."
SPER's petition demands only that
Stanford commit in practice to the
values it claims to uphold.

The Stanford campus has re
cently mobilized around the
topic of "eviction": ChiTheta
Chi's, of course. With a petition cur
rently standing at 2,056 signatures
[at the time of publication], this
community action should show us
what can happen when students
care. Although the sudden revoca
tion of the lease for a Stanford
house is surely a cause for alarm, it
seems painfully banal to remind
ourselves that it is "evictions" like
these, albeit with more violence
and less notice, that are a constant
reality for all who are subject to
home demolitions in the Occupied
Territories of Palestine.
As in so many cases of systemat
ic oppression, no one is neutral in
this conflict. Refusing to engage
means, at best, uncritically arming
the Israeli occupation with our tu
ition dollars, and indirectly ensur
ing that Middle East conflict will
continue to stagnate.
As students, the kinds of change
we can effect are indirect. Stanford's
endowment is valued in the top five
among universities, and any deci
sion to follow SPER's call to divest
would raise the symbolic and eco
nomic costs of occupation for Israel.
I approach this issue as a Jew,
and as a citizen and supporter of Is
rael. I feel it is my obligation to de
fend Israel the best I can, and I see
no better way than honestly recog
nizing its faults and urging it to im
prove. By continuing to engage in
rights-violating practices, Israel is
distancing itself from the interna

tional community and failing to
solve its real problems chief
among them the so-called "demo
graphic threat."
