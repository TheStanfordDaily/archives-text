# MARKS MY WORDS
## Meals with friends 
### Miriam Marks 
I've seen it more and more late
ly, but I don't think the phe
nomenon is at all recent. I'd
imagine that, for thousands of
years, mankind has both eaten
lunch and suggested things that
would never occur. The intersec
tion of these events is, of course,
the lunch-that-won't-happen.
It begins enthusiastically
enough. You're in a public place
fidgeting in the line at Coupa
Cafe or loitering outside the
doors of Wallenberg and you
witness the following: two individ
uals happen to encounter one an
other. They aren't best friends,
they obviously didn't plan to run
into each other, but they're clear
ly somewhat happy that it hap
pened. Sometimes they hug. Con
versation is excited, at least for the
first few moments, but it quickly
fades. Then there's only one thing
left to say.
"We should get lunch some
time!"

And it's not just lunch. It can
be anything from "catch up" to
"grab coffee" to, in particularly
ambitious cases, "get dinner." The
suggested act is usually accompa
nied by some semblance either of
urgency or important recommen
dation: "we need to catch up" or
"we should grab coffee,"
Now, how often do you think
those two people actually follow
up on their plans?
My guess is not very often.
I don't mean to suggest that
proposing the lunch-that-never
happens is a signal of malicious in
tent. It really seems unlikely that
someone would consciously pro
pose such an outing just to keep
you anxiously waiting for the in
vite. Or that you want to punish
some ungrateful friend by putting
coffee on the metaphorical table,
only to blow off your friend by

never following up with your
offer.
No, no, reader, I don't think
you are doing it out of spite. The
forces that push us to suggest the
lunch-that-won't-happen are far
deeper and more complex.
As one example, proposing the
lunch-that-won't-happen is the
easiest way to avoid saying good
bye. Say your semi-friend will de
part to spend next quarter abroad
in some exotic, enormously fun
city (or Oxford). You won't see
her for a long time, but you don't
necessarily see her that frequently
on campus either. You should say
goodbye before she leaves, right?
And then one day you bump into
her outside Green Library. You're
both tired and in a hurry, so this
seems like an inappropriate set
ting for any kind of sentimental
farewell.
Instead, you keep the option of
saying goodbye alive. You can
have a real goodbye over lunch
whenever it may be and so you
propose the lunch date. When
lunch never happens, you never
have to say goodbye; suddenly
your friend is across the Atlantic,
and you didn't have to worry
about a thing.
The lunch-that-won't-happen
is, similarly, the easiest way to not
have to catch up with said friend
once she returns with a faux-
British accent. You've watched
her endless stream of uploaded
photos and vaguely followed her
blog, but you're not particularly
dying to find out the narrated de
tails.

And suddenly Spring Quarter
has hardly begun when you bump
into her at Olive's. "We should get
lunch so I can hear about Ox
ford!" you say, honestly meaning
it in the moment. You both go
your separate ways, and the amor-

phous plan is gone as quickly as
the coffee you just bought.
Again, your intentions are
good. It usually would be great to
catch up or get lunch with so-and
so. But we get caught up in things
like classes, extracurriculars and
our better friends. With only so
many hours in a day, a lunch can
be hard to squeeze into our jam
packed schedules.
I won't sit here and pretend
that I've never proposed a meal
that is bound not to happen. I'm as
guilty as the next person. Still, we
can all admit: a culture of meals,
dates and catch-up sessions that
are fated never to materialize
can't be very good. For one thing,
it means that people will learn not
to take you seriously. After you've
told someone for the third time
that the two of you "should get
lunch," that person may stop be
lieving you, and your loss of cred
ibility will only worsen your semi
friendship from there.
Instead, we can focus more on
not saying the words when we
know they may be devoid of
meaning. If you don't want to get
lunch with someone, you don't
have to say it. And when you run
into someone who you really, truly
want to have lunch with, don't let
the conversation end with the
mere suggestion. "Are you free on
Thursday?" is the best follow-up
anyone can hope to hear.
