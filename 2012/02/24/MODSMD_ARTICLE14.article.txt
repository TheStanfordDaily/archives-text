## BLOWOUT IN BOULDER CARD TROUNCES BUFFS ON THE ROAD 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Stanford men's basketball
team made its first in-conference trip to
Boulder to face Colorado. The Cardinal
clearly enjoyed the mountain air, as it
crashed the Buffaloes 74-50.
The Cardinal (19-9, 9-7 Pac-12) entered
the matchup 2.5 games back from Colorado
(18-9,10-5 Pac-12) in the standings, knowing
it needed a win to make up ground in the
standings in order to receive a better seed
for the Pac-12 tournament.

From the start, Stanford seized control.
Freshman Chasson Randle sunk a three to
start the game, giving the Cardinal a lead it
would never relinquish. The team cruised
to a 9-1 advantage just five minutes into
the game and took a 40-20 lead into the
half.
After the break, the teams were slightly
more even, but the damage was already
done by the Card. Coach Johnny Dawkins
allowed the bench to get some playing time,
with all but one Cardinal player getting into
the game.
The Buffaloes came into the matchup as
the one unbeaten team at home in Pac-12
play, with a sterling 7-0 record. Against the
suffocating Stanford defense, they were
simply unable to get baskets to fall, shoot
ing a horrendous 29.6 percent from the
field and 46.7 percent from the line.
The Cardinal not only limited Col
orado's shooting, but also dominated them
on the boards. Stanford had 45 rebounds to
the Buffaloes' 23, with redshirt senior for
ward Josh Owens collecting a season-high
12 in just 26 minutes.
On offense, the Cardinal was buoyed as
usual by Randle. After an off night against
Oregon last weekend, the freshman came
back hard and led all scorers with 20 points.
He shot 7-10 from the field and 3-4 from
three, making the most of his 29 minutes.
The rest of the Stanford offense was
spread fairly evenly amongst the players, as

only sophomore forward John Gage scored
in double-digits. The forward played just 11
minutes, but hit 3 of 4 three pointers for 11
points. Owens, sophomore Aaron Bright
and sophomore Anthony Brown added
nine apiece.
As a whole, the Cardinal shot extremely
well (49.1 percent) from the field. The
team went 9-18 from three-point range
and shot 75 percent from the stripe.
While almost everything was smooth
sailing, Stanford struggled again with
turnovers. The Cardinal committed 18
turnovers, having the ball stolen nine
times. Stanford also committed 25 fouls to
Colorado's 15.

But the win was undoubtedly a big step
toward Stanford's quest to receive better
seeding in the season-ending Pac-12 tour
nament. The Cardinal will play Utah, the
second-worst team in the conference, on
Saturday. Stanford then comes home to
close its season against conference-lead
ing California.
Stanford is currently seventh in the con
ference, just half a game back from UCLA
and 1.5 back from Colorado and Oregon.
If the season was to end today, Stanford
would play Arizona State in the first round
and, if the Cardinal was to win, Washing
ton in the second. A sweep to end the sea
son would hopefully vault Stanford up the

standings, providing a better road to the
Pac-12 championship and potentially the
NCAA tournament berth that is awarded
to the conference champion.
The Cardinal has now won three of its
last four, with the lone exception being a
game in which it led for 37 minutes against
Oregon. Stanford appears to have re
gained the form that had it sitting atop the
Pac-12 at the start of the season, and a late
run has the potential to put the team back
on the brink of an NCAA tournament in
vitation for the first time since 2008.

play, with a sterling 7-0 record. Against the
suffocating Stanford defense, they were
simply unable to get baskets to fall, shoot
ing a horrendous 29.6 percent from the
field and 46.7 percent from the line.
The Cardinal not only limited Col
orado's shooting, but also dominated them
on the boards. Stanford had 45 rebounds to
the Buffaloes' 23, with redshirt senior for
ward Josh Owens collecting a season-high
12 in just 26 minutes.
On offense, the Cardinal was buoyed as
usual by Randle. After an off night against
Oregon last weekend, the freshman came
back hard and led all scorers with 20 points.
He shot 7-10 from the field and 3-4 from
three, making the most of his 29 minutes.
The rest of the Stanford offense was
spread fairly evenly amongst the players, as

only sophomore forward John Gage scored
in double-digits. The forward played just 11
minutes, but hit 3 of 4 three pointers for 11
points. Owens, sophomore Aaron Bright
and sophomore Anthony Brown added
nine apiece.
As a whole, the Cardinal shot extremely
well (49.1 percent) from the field. The
team went 9-18 from three-point range
and shot 75 percent from the stripe.
While almost everything was smooth
sailing, Stanford struggled again with
turnovers. The Cardinal committed 18
turnovers, having the ball stolen nine
times. Stanford also committed 25 fouls to
Colorado's 15.

But the win was undoubtedly a big step
toward Stanford's quest to receive better
seeding in the season-ending Pac-12 tour
nament. The Cardinal will play Utah, the
second-worst team in the conference, on
Saturday. Stanford then comes home to
close its season against conference-lead
ing California.
Stanford is currently seventh in the con
ference, just half a game back from UCLA
and 1.5 back from Colorado and Oregon.
If the season was to end today, Stanford
would play Arizona State in the first round
and, if the Cardinal was to win, Washing
ton in the second. A sweep to end the sea
son would hopefully vault Stanford up the

standings, providing a better road to the
Pac-12 championship and potentially the
NCAA tournament berth that is awarded
to the conference champion.
The Cardinal has now won three of its
last four, with the lone exception being a
game in which it led for 37 minutes against
Oregon. Stanford appears to have re
gained the form that had it sitting atop the
Pac-12 at the start of the season, and a late
run has the potential to put the team back
on the brink of an NCAA tournament in
vitation for the first time since 2008.
