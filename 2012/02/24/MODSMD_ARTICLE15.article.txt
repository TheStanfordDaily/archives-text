# Are we due for a miracle?

Thirty-two years ago
Wednesday, a whole lot of
Americans started believ
ing in miracles.
The anniversary of the U.S. hock
ey team's famed 1980 upset of the
Soviet Union at the Lake Placid
Winter Olympics is always a good
time to kick back, relax, watch "Mir
acle" (thanks to my dormmates for
obliging) and reflect on the times
when sports meant so much more
than the final score. Even if hockey
isn't your sport, or you're a fellow
Stanford fan who believes that
Team USA's Miracle on Ice is not
necessarily the biggest upset in
sports history, watching footage of
that game should still send chills
down your spine.
Most Americans or Ameri
can sports fans, at least are famil
iar with A1 Michaels' iconic "Do you
believe in miracles?"call,but anoth
er sound bite from the renowned
announcer encapsulates the true
meaning of the upset even better.
"I'm sure there are a lot of peo
ple in this building who do not know
the difference between a blue line
and a clothesline," Michaels said to
begin the broadcast. "It's irrelevant.
It doesn't matter. Because what we
have at hand, the rarest of sporting
events. An event that needs no
buildup, no superfluous adjectives.
In a political or nationalistic sense,
this game is being viewed with vary
ing perspectives. But manifestly, it is
a hockey game. The United States
and the Soviet Union on a sheet of
ice in Lake Placid, New York."
As Michaels seemed to sense,
Team USA would end up winning
so much more than a hockey game
on that night, reclaiming the confi
dence of a countiy that was in the
midst of the Cold War, the Iranian
hostage crisis and America's second
oil crisis in a decade. And hockey
fans weren't the only beneficiaries.
Thirty years later, sporting
events still have away of helping the
masses recover their pride. The city
of New Orleans got a post-Katrina
