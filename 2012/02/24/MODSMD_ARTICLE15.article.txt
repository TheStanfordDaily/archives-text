# Are we due for a miracle?

Thirty-two years ago
Wednesday, a whole lot of
Americans started believ
ing in miracles.
The anniversary of the U.S. hock
ey team's famed 1980 upset of the
Soviet Union at the Lake Placid
Winter Olympics is always a good
time to kick back, relax, watch "Mir
acle" (thanks to my dormmates for
obliging) and reflect on the times
when sports meant so much more
than the final score. Even if hockey
isn't your sport, or you're a fellow
Stanford fan who believes that
Team USA's Miracle on Ice is not
necessarily the biggest upset in
sports history, watching footage of
that game should still send chills
down your spine.
Most Americans or Ameri
can sports fans, at least are famil
iar with A1 Michaels' iconic "Do you
believe in miracles?"call,but anoth
er sound bite from the renowned
announcer encapsulates the true
meaning of the upset even better.
"I'm sure there are a lot of peo
ple in this building who do not know
the difference between a blue line
and a clothesline," Michaels said to
begin the broadcast. "It's irrelevant.
It doesn't matter. Because what we
have at hand, the rarest of sporting
events. An event that needs no
buildup, no superfluous adjectives.
In a political or nationalistic sense,
this game is being viewed with vary
ing perspectives. But manifestly, it is
a hockey game. The United States
and the Soviet Union on a sheet of
ice in Lake Placid, New York."
As Michaels seemed to sense,
Team USA would end up winning
so much more than a hockey game
on that night, reclaiming the confi
dence of a countiy that was in the
midst of the Cold War, the Iranian
hostage crisis and America's second
oil crisis in a decade. And hockey
fans weren't the only beneficiaries.
Thirty years later, sporting
events still have away of helping the
masses recover their pride. The city
of New Orleans got a post-Katrina
lift when the Saints won the 2010
Super Bowl. Japan's women's soc
cer team captured the 2011 World
Cup trophy and inspired a country
that was just four months separated
from a deadly earthquake and
tsunami.
Sports can't get back the lives
that were lost in wars or natural
disasters, but the most transcen
dent of sporting events can still
give us something to feel good
about.
Fast forward to 2012. Millions of
Americans are still dealing with the
aftershocks of the 2008 recession,
Congress' approval rating is at a
record-low and the war in
Afghanistan is in its 12th year.
Things aren't as bad as they were in

1980, but the United States has seen
much better days. Don't you think
we re due for a miracle of our own?
I'd look to this year's summer
Olympics in London as a possible
source. We're just four years re
moved from Michael Phelps'
record-setting eight gold medals in
Beijing, and the games always
seem to get non-fans excited about
sports that are far from the Ameri
can mainstream. But as extraordi
nary as Phelps' 2008 performance
was, it's not all that miraculous
when the best swimmer in the
world lives up to his name. What's
more, incredible athletic achieve
ments don't always have a sweep
ing social impact Kerri Strug's
improbable 1996 vault on a severe
ly hurt ankle to win the Americans
the all-around gold made her a
household name, but didn't do that
much more.

Truth be told, it's hard to say
where the next uplifting American

sports moment will come from, or if
it's even in our near future. That's
the thing about miracles: You don't
see them coming.
But sports still keep rearing its
not-so-ugly head at the forefront of
the American consciousness, as cul
tural sensations such as Broncos
quarterback Tim Tebow and Knicks
guard Jeremy Lin always seem to re
mind us. So even if you don't know a
two-iron from a two-by-four, a slice
backhand from a slice of cheese or a
blue line from a clothesline, keep
your eyes on the sporting world.
Manifestly, it might be just a
hockey game. But you never know
where the next miracle is waiting.

Joseph Beyda will be watching
"Miracle'' on repeat until his dorm
mates file a complaint with hous
ing. Meanwhile, you can send him
