## TEXAS, CARD SET FOR EARLY SEASON DUEL 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
After a dominant three
game sweep of then-No. 10 Van
derbilt and a surprisingly close
escape from Pacific on Tuesday,
the Stanford baseball team will
need to bring its A-game to
Sunken Diamond again this
weekend against No. 12 Texas.
The No. 2 Cardinal (4-0) and
the Longhorns (2-2) are each
looking to bounce back from
disappointing midweek per
formances. Texas fell to un
ranked UT-Arlington 7-5 at
home Tuesday, while Stanford
needed an llth-inning home
run from junior third baseman
Stephen Piscotty to knock off
winless Pacific in Stockton by
the score of 9-7.

Piscotty has quickly emerged
as one of several Cardinal bats
to be reckoned with, driving in a
team-high 11 runs through just
four games. At that rate, he's set
to quadruple his 2011 total of 40
RBIs and surpass last year's na
tional leaders by more than 70.
Piscotty is also pacing Stan
ford hitters with three of the
squad's five home runs, a cate
gory in which the Cardinal
seems likely to exceed last
year's mark of 27 by a wide mar
gin. That total the lowest for

Stanford since 1969 was in
large part due to new standards
set by the NCAA to reduce the
power of composite bats before
last season, a change that re
duced scoring across the nation.
If the Cardinal's 44 runs so
far are any indication, though,
that's probably not going to be
the case this year.
"1 think it's safe to say that
we're starting to get used to [the
new bats]," Piscotty said. "We're
just having fun hitting the ball
around."
Another Stanford standout
at the plate on Tuesday was jun
ior left fielder Tyler Gaffney,
who came up with three hits
against Pacific after having his
24-game hit streak snapped on
Sunday. First-year starter Chris
tian Griffiths has also fulfilled
his designated-hitter duties im
pressively, as the redshirt ju
nior's .750 slugging percentage
is second only to Piscotty's after
the two-hit night at Pacific.
The one possible area of con
cern for Piscotty so far has been
his fielding. The preseason All-
American has accounted for
four of the squad's five errors
making for a disturbingly low
.500 fielding percentage but
given the 16 errors committed
by Stanford's opponents
through just four games, the
Cardinal can still take pride in
its team defense.
"I think we have one of the
best defenses in the whole coun

try, and it's a good feeling know
ing that if you give up a long fly
ball into the gap [junior center
fielder Jake] Stewart is probably
going to run it down," said red
shirt junior starter Brett
Mooneyham.
Texas will be hard-pressed to
throw off Mooneyham and Fri
day starter Mark Appel, the duo
that conclusively shut down the
Commodores last weekend to
win the Cardinal the series by
Saturday night. But beyond the
two junior standouts, Stanford
looks like it still has questions to
answer on the mound through
four games. Sophomore A.J.
Vanegas and senior Elliot Byers
who got the starting nods on
Sunday and Tuesday, respectively
were both chased in the sec
ond inning of their outings, while
senior reliever Brian Busick also
struggled in his one appearance
of the weekend.
Instead, a pair of freshmen in
righthander David Schmidt and
lefthander John Hochstatter
have stepped up as lockdown re
lievers for the Cardinal, allowing
just one earned run in 11 com
bined innings and each already
notching their first collegiate
wins.
Schmidt in particular has
turned some heads as a possible
replacement for closer Chris
Reed, who was drafted in the first
round by the Los Angeles
Dodgers after last season.
"Not many freshmen can
[begin as closers] Drew
Storen could do that as a fresh

man," said head coach Mark
Marquess, referencing the even
tual 2009 Washington Nationals
first-round pick. "Schmidt's
never been a relief guy. The thing
is that all the better pitchers are
starters; there are no relief pitch
ers in high school so you don't re
ally know who can do that."
The Longhorns have pitching
concerns of their own to address,
with their returning hurlers ac
counting for just over a third of
the squad's innings pitched in
2011. Texas' rotation has only one
player with significant starting
experience in junior lefthander
Hoby Milner, who pitched in re
lief when the Longhorns took
two of three games against Stan
ford a year ago.
Closing out both of those
Texas wins was then-freshman
righthander Corey Knebel, an
eventual first-team All-Ameri
can and winner of the National
Collegiate Baseball Writers As
sociation's Stopper of the Year
Award.
The Longhorns will get a
boost from the return of senior
second baseman Jordan Etier,
who missed the first four games
of this season with a suspension.
In his stead, sophomore right
fielder Mark Payton has grabbed
the reins as Texas' top hitter with
a .538 batting percentage, making
him the only Longhorn slugger
currently batting above .300.
Etier and Payton combined for
three RBIs in Texas' 4-3 series
opener win a year ago.
The three-game set kicks off
tonight at 5:30 p.m. at Sunken Di
amond, with 1 p.m. starts on Sat
urday and Sunday to follow.

Stanford since 1969 was in
large part due to new standards

far are any indication, though,
that's probably not going to be

try, and it's a good feeling know
ing that if you give up a long fly
ball into the gap [junior center
fielder Jake] Stewart is probably
going to run it down," said red
shirt junior starter Brett
Mooneyham.
Texas will be hard-pressed to
throw off Mooneyham and Fri
day starter Mark Appel, the duo
that conclusively shut down the
Commodores last weekend to
win the Cardinal the series by
Saturday night. But beyond the
two junior standouts, Stanford
looks like it still has questions to
answer on the mound through
four games. Sophomore A.J.
Vanegas and senior Elliot Byers
who got the starting nods on
Sunday and Tuesday, respectively
were both chased in the sec
ond inning of their outings, while
senior reliever Brian Busick also
struggled in his one appearance
of the weekend.
Instead, a pair of freshmen in
righthander David Schmidt and
lefthander John Hochstatter
have stepped up as lockdown re
lievers for the Cardinal, allowing
just one earned run in 11 com
bined innings and each already
notching their first collegiate
wins.
Schmidt in particular has
turned some heads as a possible
replacement for closer Chris
Reed, who was drafted in the first
round by the Los Angeles
Dodgers after last season.
"Not many freshmen can
[begin as closers] Drew
Storen could do that as a fresh

man," said head coach Mark
Marquess, referencing the even
tual 2009 Washington Nationals
first-round pick. "Schmidt's
never been a relief guy. The thing
is that all the better pitchers are
starters; there are no relief pitch
ers in high school so you don't re
ally know who can do that."
The Longhorns have pitching
concerns of their own to address,
with their returning hurlers ac
counting for just over a third of
the squad's innings pitched in
2011. Texas' rotation has only one
player with significant starting
experience in junior lefthander
Hoby Milner, who pitched in re
lief when the Longhorns took
two of three games against Stan
ford a year ago.
Closing out both of those
Texas wins was then-freshman
righthander Corey Knebel, an
eventual first-team All-Ameri
can and winner of the National
Collegiate Baseball Writers As
sociation's Stopper of the Year
Award.
The Longhorns will get a
boost from the return of senior
second baseman Jordan Etier,
who missed the first four games
of this season with a suspension.
In his stead, sophomore right
fielder Mark Payton has grabbed
the reins as Texas' top hitter with
a .538 batting percentage, making
him the only Longhorn slugger
currently batting above .300.
Etier and Payton combined for
three RBIs in Texas' 4-3 series
opener win a year ago.
The three-game set kicks off
tonight at 5:30 p.m. at Sunken Di

After a dominant three
game sweep of then-No. 10 Van
derbilt and a surprisingly close
escape from Pacific on Tuesday,
the Stanford baseball team will
need to bring its A-game to
Sunken Diamond again this
weekend against No. 12 Texas.
The No. 2 Cardinal (4-0) and
the Longhorns (2-2) are each
looking to bounce back from
disappointing midweek per
formances. Texas fell to un
ranked UT-Arlington 7-5 at
home Tuesday, while Stanford
needed an llth-inning home
run from junior third baseman
Stephen Piscotty to knock off
winless Pacific in Stockton by
the score of 9-7.

Piscotty has quickly emerged
as one of several Cardinal bats
to be reckoned with, driving in a
team-high 11 runs through just
four games. At that rate, he's set
to quadruple his 2011 total of 40
RBIs and surpass last year's na
tional leaders by more than 70.
Piscotty is also pacing Stan
ford hitters with three of the
squad's five home runs, a cate
gory in which the Cardinal
seems likely to exceed last
year's mark of 27 by a wide mar
gin. That total the lowest for

Stanford since 1969 was in
large part due to new standards

power of composite bats before
last season, a change that re
