## TEXAS, CARD SET FOR EARLY SEASON DUEL 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
After a dominant three
game sweep of then-No. 10 Van
derbilt and a surprisingly close
escape from Pacific on Tuesday,
the Stanford baseball team will
need to bring its A-game to
Sunken Diamond again this
weekend against No. 12 Texas.
The No. 2 Cardinal (4-0) and
the Longhorns (2-2) are each
looking to bounce back from
disappointing midweek per
formances. Texas fell to un
ranked UT-Arlington 7-5 at
home Tuesday, while Stanford
needed an llth-inning home
run from junior third baseman
Stephen Piscotty to knock off
winless Pacific in Stockton by
the score of 9-7.

Piscotty has quickly emerged
as one of several Cardinal bats
to be reckoned with, driving in a
team-high 11 runs through just
four games. At that rate, he's set
to quadruple his 2011 total of 40
RBIs and surpass last year's na
tional leaders by more than 70.
Piscotty is also pacing Stan
ford hitters with three of the
squad's five home runs, a cate
gory in which the Cardinal
seems likely to exceed last
year's mark of 27 by a wide mar
gin. That total the lowest for

Stanford since 1969 was in
large part due to new standards
set by the NCAA to reduce the
power of composite bats before
last season, a change that re
duced scoring across the nation.
If the Cardinal's 44 runs so
far are any indication, though,
that's probably not going to be
the case this year.
"1 think it's safe to say that
we're starting to get used to [the
new bats]," Piscotty said. "We're
just having fun hitting the ball
around."
Another Stanford standout
at the plate on Tuesday was jun
ior left fielder Tyler Gaffney,
who came up with three hits
against Pacific after having his
24-game hit streak snapped on
Sunday. First-year starter Chris
tian Griffiths has also fulfilled
his designated-hitter duties im
pressively, as the redshirt ju
nior's .750 slugging percentage
is second only to Piscotty's after
the two-hit night at Pacific.
The one possible area of con
cern for Piscotty so far has been
his fielding. The preseason All-
American has accounted for
four of the squad's five errors
making for a disturbingly low
.500 fielding percentage but
given the 16 errors committed
by Stanford's opponents
through just four games, the
Cardinal can still take pride in
its team defense.
"I think we have one of the
best defenses in the whole coun

Sophomore shortstop Lonnie Kauppila (above) and the Stanford
baseball crew hope to shake off a shaky performance against Pacific as
they face No. 12 Texas in a three-game series starting today.
