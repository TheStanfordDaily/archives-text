## Stanford starts slow, finishes strong 
### DEAN MCARDLE STAFF WRITER 
Freshly crowned the Pac-12 champions,
Stanford women's basketball team found it
self in a dogfight early on against Colorado
on Thursday night. The Cardinal pulled
away in the second half, notching a 68-46
victory at Maples Pavilion.
Senior All-American Nnemkadi Ogwu

mike led the No. 2 Cardinal with 23 points,
and in the process passed former Stanford
great Kate Starbird for second on the all
time scoring list. Nneka's career total now
stands at 2,230, trailing only Candice Wig
gins at 2,629. Nnemkadi's younger sister,
Chiney, joined her in double figures with 18
points.
"To be in that group of people is really
great," Nneka said of becoming No. 2 on the

list. "But I couldn't have done it without my
teammates, without the support of my
coaches, and at the same time there are big
ger things that I want people to congratulate
us on."
Junior guard Chucky Jeffery paced the
Buffaloes with 13 points and 13 rebounds.
With the victory, Stanford (25-1, 16-0
Pac-12) extended its home win
ning streak to 76 games. Con
necticut's loss to St. John's on
Saturday means that Stanford
now possesses the longest active
home winning streak in the
country.
Colorado (16-10,5-10 Pac-12)

has now lost six of its last seven
contests, and continues to slide
after starting the season with 12
straight victories.
Out of the gate, both teams
struggled to find a rhythm offen
sively, combining for one field
goal through the first four min
utes.

Stanford stayed on the attack,
though, driving to the basket and
drawing fouls. The Cardinal
scored its first six and 13 of its
26 points in the first half from

the charity stripe.
Whistles echoed around
Maples Pavilion for much of the
early going. The Buffaloes and
Cardinal traded fouls and
turnovers at a torrid pace, with
the teams combining for 26
turnovers and 22 fouls in the first
half.
The Cardinal started to pull
away after two free throws by
Chiney gave it a four-point ad
vantage, however Jeffrey re
sponded with a tough turn
around jumper at the other end
to keep the game tight.
Each time Stanford began to
build a lead, Colorado answered,
and at half time the score stood
26-18, with Stanford ahead.
Stanford came out of the
locker room firing in the second
half, dashing out on a 19-2 run
through the first six minutes. The
run featured freshman guard
Amber Orrange weaving her
way to the basket and absorbing
a foul to complete a difficult
and-one.
Baskets began coming in
bunches for Stanford in the sec
ond half, and a Lindy La'Rocque
and-one three-pointer with 10
minutes left put them ahead by
33. Colorado fought back late,
but the Stanford's lead was too
great and too little time re
mained for the Buffaloes.
"Stanford's dominance in the
second half stood in stark con
trast to the hard first half," said
Colorado head coach Linda
Lappe. "In the second half we
became a little bit stagnant and
had trouble scoring."
Vanderveer also praised Col
orado's tough defense in the first
half. "Colorado came out and
they were super aggressive, and
we didn't handle it that well in
the first half, but in the second
half we were more aggressive,"
she said.
Nnemkadi added 11 re
bounds to go along with her 23
points, collecting her 14th dou
ble-double of the season.
"Nneka really carried our
team," Vanderveer said. "I don't
think that there is any doubt that
she is the Pac-12 Player of the
Year, and she showed it tonight."
The win gave head coach Tara
Vanderveer her 699 th career vic
tory.

Stanford next plays host to
Utah at 2 p.m. on Saturday.
