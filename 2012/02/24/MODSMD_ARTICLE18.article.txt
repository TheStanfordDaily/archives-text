## Coaching changes in motion 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
With the Stanford football team
opening its first spring practice
session on Monday afternoon,
head coach David Shaw sat down
with the media on Thursday to dis
cuss some of the major changes
for the Cardinal this offseason,
most notably on the coaching
staff.
First, Shaw addressed the de
fensive side of the ball, where co
defensive coordinator Derek
Mason will assume the role of de
fensive coordinator.
"We're going to hire a new de
fensive coach, but Derek Mason
will be the defensive coordinator,"
Shaw said. "There will not be an
other co-coordinator situation."
Mason, who is in his third year
on the Cardinal coaching staff
after being hired away from the
Minnesota Vikings in 2010, earned
the promotion after co-defensive
coordinator Jason Tarver left to
take over as defensive coordina
tor for the Oakland Raiders. To
gether, the two led a Cardinal de
fense that finished the season
ranked either first or second in the
Pac-12 in eight categories, includ
ing first in total defense and rush
ing defense.
Shaw specifically noted that
the Cardinal is looking to hire a
new inside linebackers coach to

replace Tarver, and he expects to
have that position filled by next
week.
Shaw will also hire a new special
teams coordinator to replace Brian
Polian, who left to take over the
special teams at Texas A&M this
offseason.
The Cardinal is expected to
hire former Fresno State special
teams coordinator Pete Alamar to
fill Polian's shoes, but Shaw said
the official announcement would
not be made until Monday.
Alamar spent the last two sea
sons working as the special teams
and tight ends coach at Fresno
State, Prior to his time in Fresno,
the 51-year old Alamar spent
seven seasons as Cal's special
teams coordinator and tight ends
coach before he was fired in 2009.
While Alamar did tutor players
like All-American punt returner
DeSean Jackson, who led the nation
in punt return average in 2006, the
end of his tenure at Cal was marked
by a 2009 season where the Bears
finished ninth in the Pac-10 in kick
offs and last in the conference in
field goal percentage.
Second-year coach Ron Crook
will continue to coach the Cardinal
tight ends, and under his tutelage
the trio of Coby Fleener, Levine
Toilolo and Zach Ertz combined
to catch 86 passes for 1,356 yards
and 20 touchdowns in 2011.
Finally, Shaw also addressed

running backs coach Mike San
ford, who was promoted to the
role of recruiting coordinator on
Monday.
"Mike's always been one of
those guys, even when he was an
intern here when I first got here,
that I knew he was going to have a
bright future in this profession,"
Shaw said. "He's extremely per
sonable, he's great to talk to; he
bonds with people very quickly ...
You look down that list of guys we
signed this year, and a lot of those
guys were his recruits. And those
guys would run through a wall for
him. It was only natural for me to
elevate him to that position."
Shaw did say that outside line
backers coach Lance Anderson,
who was named Scout.corn's Na
tional Recruiter of the Year, would
still play a major role in recruiting
and act as the football team's liai
son to the admissions department.
The Cardinal will open up its
first session of spring practice on
Monday, February 27. The first
spring session will end on March
10th in anticipation of finals and
spring break. The Cardinal will re
sume workouts on April 2nd and
wrap up the spring on April 14th in
the annual Cardinal-White Spring
Game at Kezar Stadium in San
Francisco.
