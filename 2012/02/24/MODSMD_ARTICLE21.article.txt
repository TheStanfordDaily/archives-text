# KLAHN BACK FOR BIG SLAM
## HIGH STAKES IN RIVALRY MATCH 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis
team plays host to its fiercest rival
the California Golden Bears
this Saturday afternoon at the
Taube Family Tennis Center. The
annual Big Slam is perennially one
of the most highly anticipated
matches on the Stanford tennis
schedule, as these two storied pro
grams have had many legendary
clashes in the past.
The Cardinal is coming off one
of its best weekends of the year,
having defeated two top-10 oppo
nents and narrowly lost to another
at the National Team Indoor
Championships in Charlottesville,
Virginia. At that tournament, No.
9 Stanford squeezed by No. 7 Bay
lor in the first round, put up a great
fight against No. 2 UVA in the sec
ond round and then rebounded
with a resounding win against No.
6 Kentucky in the consolations.
In Virginia, Stanford was
buoyed by the return of two of
their top players who had been out
with injuries: junior Denis Lin re
turned from a one match absence
and senior Bradley Klahn fully re
turned to play for the first time this
dual-match season.
The return of Klahn paid im
mediate dividends for the Cardi
nal, who had been playing leader
less so far this season. Klahn's re
turn to the top of the lineup also
greatly helps coach John
Whitlinger lengthen out his lineup
and better utilize the solid depth
that is one of Stanford's strengths.
"It really means a lot to the rest

of the guys having Brad back,"
Whitlinger said early in the week,
"I had no idea he would be ready
to go until right before the doubles
match against Baylor. He's just
such a competitor, such a fighter,
and he really wanted to play. It was
really a big boost for our team."
Having Klahn back also means
Whitlinger can return to his nor
mal doubles pairing and try to turn
around Stanford's abnormally
weak play in doubles, a definite
positive for the squad. Klahn's re
turn is already showing dividends
in this regard, as the team went 2-1
in the doubles portion of their
matches over the weekend in Vir
ginia, a large improvement consid
ering the level of the competition.
Against No. 13 Cal on Satur
day, Stanford's new-look lineup
will surely be tested in what prom
ises to be a lively environment at
Taube. Cal is led on singles this
year by the nationally ranked duo
of Ben McLachlan and Carlos
Cueto, ranked No. 44 and No. 67
respectively. Their record on the
season is 5-4. At the National In
door Championship, the Golden
Bears were trounced by No. 4
Georgia and No. 8 UCLA before
defeating No. 12 Pepperdine.
Whenever Stanford and Cal
meet in any sport, there always
seem to be some sort of fireworks,
and Saturday's matchup proves to
be nothing out of the ordinary in
this respect. These two teams
know each other very well, and
whenever they meet, tough, tight
and exciting matches seem to al
ways ensue.
The rivalry renews at 1 p.m. on
Saturday at the Taube Family Ten
nis Center.
