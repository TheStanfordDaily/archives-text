## THINGS STANFORD STUDENTS COMPLAIN ABOUT 
### 
So you get into the Princeton Review's No. 1 Dream School, you ship off to sunny
California and you dip into life as a true Stanford student, in the hopes of continuing the
ill-fated Leland Stanford Junior's legacy. After logging into Axess, there's only one thing
left to do: complain. But the educated and elite don't just rattle off grumbles and gripes
like any run-of-the-mill college kid. This week's Top 5 will let you know how to complain
in perfect Stanford style.

Stanford Dining
Perhaps the first thing you do as a Stanford freshman, before Band Run, Big Game or even
that first bedazzling Full Moon, will be to complain about dining. Sure, you'll like it at first,
maybe even revel in the copious pizza and "fresh fruit" (bananas!). But after a while, you'll
notice Stern's always serving some pasta with dubious pesto overtones, and then not even
Arrillaga's ceramic plates will be enough to revive your stomach for Stanford R&DE. Or at
least that's what you'll tell your friends.
The Weather
Stanford students may have invented the backdoor brag for the purpose of complaining
about the weather at Stanford. Often congesting Facebook newsfeeds, talk of 70 degree
weather in February and wishing for "seasons" reminds us of how great we have it. But
unless you hail from the Northeast, in which case you will complain about the complainers,
prepare yourselves to grouse any time the mercury dips below 68.
Dating
True facts: Stanford students don't date there are only four year relationships and random
hook-ups. This phenomenon rings so true, they put it in The Real World to try to convince us
otherwise. From hopeful freshmen to bitter seniors, find this beef on every Stanford com
plainer's platter.
The Draw
They don't call it draw-ma for nothing. Does it make sense? Did Condoleezza Rice invent the
draw as a package deal with IHUM to ruin the freshman experience? How did you end up in
a West Campus house when you wanted an East Campus dorm? Thank the draw for scape
goating your complaining about housing, which you really use to complain about your lack of
social life.
Fuzzies/Techies
Whether it's administrators complaining about the fuzzy/techie divide, techies complaining
about p-sets or fuzzies complaining about techies not taking them seriously, the fuzzy/techie
divide perpetuates a whirlpool of grievances around itself. Whatever major or vocation you
choose, there's a place on the fuzzy/techie spectrum of whining that will suit your venting
needs. If not, you can always argue about whether or not Humßio is techie.
