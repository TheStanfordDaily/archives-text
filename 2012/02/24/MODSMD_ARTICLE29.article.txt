### â€“ sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
A nne Rice, the original queen of vampire
f-\ fiction, crosses to the other side with her
latest book, "The Wolf Gift," a werewolf
novel set in the contemporary Bay Area.
Twenty-something-year-old Reuben
Golding, a rising star at The San Francisco

Observer, is rich, handsome and idealistic,

an English Ph.D. dropout with
dreams of becoming the next
great American novelist a

protagonist with whom many
Stanford students can surely

identify. He is assigned the story of a magnifi
cent mansion recently put up for sale by the

beautiful Marchent Nideck, the niece of its van
ished owner, the brilliant explorer Felix Nideck.
Reuben rapidly grows enamored of both
the house, filled as it is with Felix's books and

artifacts, and of Marchent, who unexpectedly
and rather improbably decides to bequeath the
property to him, on the basis of a day's acquain
tance and a one-night stand. That night,

Marchent meets a violent end at the hands of
her jealous younger brothers; Reuben is narrow
ly rescued by a large, mutant wolf. He is hospi
talized for injuries sustained during the attack
and emerges with lycanthropic powers and a
compulsive bent for vigilante justice, as he hears

the voices of the afflicted in his head.
Reuben becomes embroiled in a sort of
double life more typically seen in comic book
superheroes. At night, he transforms into an
avenging angel of a werewolf, rescuing the
defenseless and enacting his own brutal retribu
tion upon their attackers. By day, he

"" reports on the activities of the
vigilante known to the public

only as "the Man Wolf," a
I rather unoriginal

moniker from Reuben's
own pen. He juggles the conflicting goals of hid
ing his new alternate identity from those closest
to him; holding down his job, where he strug
gles to produce new material on the Man Wolf
for a ravenously curious public without expos
ing his own web of lies; and learning to master
his newfound powers and violent instincts. As
he looks for materials on lycanthropy in the

Nideck house, Reuben realizes that Felix Nideck
and his lost companions are still alive, tracking
his every movement.
"The Wolf Gift" is a meticulously crafted
urban fantasy, where the practical and scientific
details have been carefully considered and
seamlessly drive the story forward. One of the
most compelling plot lines revolves around

Reuben's mother, a well-respected surgeon, who
is desperate to figure out why her son has
changed. Convinced that science holds all the
answers, she is led straight into the clutches of a
sinister specialist with suspicious connections to
Felix's disappearance. The various characters'
vacillations between scientific skepticism and
belief in werewolf lore are generally well han
dled, including convincing crises of faith
