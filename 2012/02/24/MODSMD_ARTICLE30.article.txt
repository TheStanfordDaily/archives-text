# STUFF we LOVE
## NICK HORNBY'S BOOK REVIEWS 
### â€“ alexandra HEENEY contact alexandra: aheeney@stanford. edu 
In "Shakespeare Wrote for Money," Nick
Hornby writes, "The annoying thing about
reading is that you can never get the job
done... reading begets reading that's sort of
the point of it, surely? and anybody who
never deviates from a set list of books is intellec
tually dead anyway."
The book is the third installment of collec
tions of Hornby's monthly book review column,
"Stuff I've Been Reading," for The Believer. And
the quote neatly sums up Hornby's entire
approach to reviewing books: he writes as a fel
low reader, guiding us on his intellectual journey

that takes him from one book to the next and
his critical response to the books not objec
tively, but in the context of what else he's been
reading and thinking about.
Most critics would never dare let their liter
ary voice sound as much like a punter as
Hornby does, but Hornby's authority is saved
not just by his clever insights and hilarious
turns-of-phrase, but by his straight talk about
the life of a reader. Each month, the column
starts with a list of "Books Read" and "Books
Bought." In his first column, republished in "The
Polysyllabic Spree," he explains his overly opti-

mistic book-buying policy: "I don't want anyone
writing in to point out that I spend too much
money on books, many of which I will never
read. I know that already. I certainly intend to
read all of them, more or less. My intentions are
good. Anyway it's my money. And I'll bet you do
it too."
He writes candidly and incisively about his
reading habits, which are all too familiar, stating,
"The truth is, I've been reading more short
books recently because I need to
bump up the numbers in the
Books Read column." When he
finally decides to embark on
"David Copperfield," he refers to it
as "Dickensian nutrition" and talks
about how after reading short,
easy or trashy books, you find you
need something "nutritional" to
balance your diet.

Hornby's reviews articulately
capture how we readers think: we
feel compelled to read things that,
as he calls them, "scary" or
"grown-up" critics applaud, but
ultimately we are thrilled when we
can append "and not boring!" to
someone's praise about a certain
book. On that note, after penning
his first young adult novel, he was

delighted to discover a panoply of
unknown masterpieces in that
genre, which he persuasively com
mends.
He also discusses the inherent
usefulness of the "Alex Awards," "a
list of ten adult books that... will
appeal to younger readers," or "in
other words, ten books that aren't
boring" After looking through the
list of winners, he starts to think
about what other novels could
have won the awards "Great
Expectations" or "Pride and
Prejudice." As he puts it, "if a book
couldn't have made that list, then
it's probably not worth reading."
Hornby is incredibly astute.
When reviewing a collection of
George Orwell's brilliant essays,
including "Books v. Cigarettes," his

pithy remark that Orwell's "prose
is beyond reproach, muscular,
readable, accessible" could replace
hours of my extolling its virtues.
When discussing the impeccably
observed "Sam and Me," a nonfic
tion book about having an autistic
child, he divulges his own experi
ences he has an autistic son
convincing you unreservedly to
read the book, even if you never
had prior interest in autism. His
insights into the meta-narrative in
"David Copperfield" convinced
me to reread it; though one of my
favorite books, it's also a huge time
commitment.
After a few years' hiatus,
Hornby is back to writing his reg
ular monthly column for The
Believer, and I'm now a subscriber.
Hornby's reviews are entirely
unique: lovably unpretentious,
clever, intelligent and sure to pro
vide some useful recommenda
tions. Best of all, what causes me
to quote him endlessly and
laugh out loud, repeatedly, in cof
fee shops or on public transit is
his very honest meta-narrative
about what it is to be a reader: all
of the joy, embarrassment and silly
habits that come with it.
