# AWARD SEASON
## LOOKING AHEAD TO THE OSCARS 
### â€“ halle EDWARDS contact halle: halle@stanford. edu 
This year's Academy Awards ceremo
ny is shaping to be diverse, with every
thing from children's films ("Hugo")
to raunchy rom-coms ("Bridesmaids") to a
silent film ("The Artist") up for major awards.
But who will actually win Oscar gold, and
who will go home empty handed? Check out
our predictions to win all your Oscar-related
betting!
Best Picture

With nine nominees this year ("War
Horse," "The Artist," "Moneyball," "The
Descendants," "The Tree of Life," "Midnight in
Paris," "The Help," "Hugo," "Extremely Loud
and Incredibly Close"), this category might
seem difficult to call at first. Will the Academy
honor this year's awards' show darling ("The

Artist," fresh off Director's and Producer's
Guild awards) or choose something more
popular ("Hugo," "Midnight in Paris)"? Based
on recent precedent, with "The King's Speech"
and "The Hurt Locker" taking home best pic
ture the last two years both well-reviewed
films that weren't widely seen we think this
is the year silent film makes a comeback in
Hollywood.
Best Director
While it's natural and strongly likely
that Michel Hazanavicius will win for "The
Artist" following his director's guild win, don't
count out Martin Scorsese for "Hugo." He
upset in this category at the last Golden
Globes, and his lush children's film has been
hailed as the best 3D film ver made.

Best Actor
Jean Dujardin ("The Artist") is a safe bet
for his charismatic silent performance. If
you're looking for an upset, don't rule out
Gary Oldman's controlled, masterful per
formance in "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," or
George Clooney's turn in "The Descendants."
Best Actress
A few weeks ago, many saw this year as
Meryl Streep's best opportunity to finally win
another Oscar. Though she's been nominated
more times than any other actress, she has not
won since 1982 for "Sophie's Choice." Her
stunning performance in "The Iron Lady" led
many to think this would be her year.
However, enter Viola Davis. Her powerful role
in "The Help" has been catching eyes since last

summer, and her recent SAG
award has many thinking she
might get her first Oscar
and we agree. kji

Best Supporting Actor
This is Christopher j
Plummer's JY
("Beginners") award. A

beloved Hollywood actor, more than 80 years
old, who's yet to win an Oscar? Check.
Though there's a small chance Max von
Sydow ("Extremely Loud and Incredibly
Close"), could upset, Plummer's the best bet.

Hollywood talent (Jessica Chastain, Melissa
McCarthy, Berenice Bejo, Janet McTeer and
Octavia Spencer) this category has been his
torically tough to call and often features huge
upsets. However, we think odds are with
Octavia Spencer this year. "The Help" is riding
a huge wave of audience support and awards'
gold, and despite other big talent in this cate
gory, we think she's the likely favorite.

Best Animated Feature
Since Pixar dropped the ball in 2011 with
"Cars 2" (the studio's first negatively-reviewed
film) this year's animated film category is
wide open. "Rango" seems to be the favorite,
but "A Cat in Paris," a more indie release,
could pull off a last-minute upset like
"Spirited Away" did in 2002.

Best Original Screenplay
Even though "Bridesmaids" was a box
office smash and critical hit, it hasn't done
super well this awards season. Best screenplay
might be the raunchy comedy's only chance
to shine at the Oscars. However, it will have to
beat Woody Allen's "Midnight in Paris," "The
Artist" and J.C. Chandor's "Margin Call"
(which some think might get the award as a
nod to the Occupy movement) to get the

award. We're hoping for an upset!
Best Adapted Screenplay
Critical darling "Hugo" is the best bet here,
but this category might be the best change for
"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" or "The
Descendants" to pick up an award.

George Clooney's turn in "The Descendants."
Best Actress
A few weeks ago, many saw this year as
Meryl Streep's best opportunity to finally win
another Oscar. Though she's been nominated
more times than any other actress, she has not
won since 1982 for "Sophie's Choice." Her
stunning performance in "The Iron Lady" led
many to think this would be her year.
However, enter Viola Davis. Her powerful role
in "The Help" has been catching eyes since last

summer, and her recent SAG
award has many thinking she
might get her first Oscar
and we agree. kji

Best Supporting Actor
This is Christopher j
Plummer's JY
("Beginners") award. A

beloved Hollywood actor, more than 80 years
old, who's yet to win an Oscar? Check.
Though there's a small chance Max von
Sydow ("Extremely Loud and Incredibly
Close"), could upset, Plummer's the best bet.
Best Supporting Actress
In a category filled with a ton of fresh

Hollywood talent (Jessica Chastain, Melissa
McCarthy, Berenice Bejo, Janet McTeer and
Octavia Spencer) this category has been his
torically tough to call and often features huge
upsets. However, we think odds are with
Octavia Spencer this year. "The Help" is riding
a huge wave of audience support and awards'
gold, and despite other big talent in this cate
gory, we think she's the likely favorite.

Best Animated Feature
Since Pixar dropped the ball in 2011 with
"Cars 2" (the studio's first negatively-reviewed
film) this year's animated film category is
wide open. "Rango" seems to be the favorite,
but "A Cat in Paris," a more indie release,
could pull off a last-minute upset like
"Spirited Away" did in 2002.

Best Original Screenplay
Even though "Bridesmaids" was a box
office smash and critical hit, it hasn't done
super well this awards season. Best screenplay
might be the raunchy comedy's only chance
to shine at the Oscars. However, it will have to
beat Woody Allen's "Midnight in Paris," "The
Artist" and J.C. Chandor's "Margin Call"
(which some think might get the award as a
nod to the Occupy movement) to get the

award. We're hoping for an upset!
Best Adapted Screenplay
Critical darling "Hugo" is the best bet here,
but this category might be the best change for
"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" or "The
Descendants" to pick up an award.
