In preparation for the Academy
Awards on Sunday, you can
catch the Oscar-nominated
Animated and Live Action
Shorts at Palo Alto's Aquarius
Theatre, allowing you to weigh in
on what are usually the most eso
teric categories.
Of the five animated shorts,
"The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr.
Morris Lessmore" is the most com
pelling, a touching computer-ani

mated ode to the magic of reading.
We meet Mr. Morris Lessmore in
New Orleans, just as a hurricane
hits, reading on his veranda with
stacks of books. The books take
flight, while individual letters are
yanked off the pages by the wind.
The film creates a fantasy world
where books have legs and emo
tions and where a person goes
through a "Pleasantville"-esque
transformation when being hand-

Ed a book: from black-and-white
to Technicolor. The film is largely
without dialogue but has that old
school cinematic charm of the
opening montage of the recent
"Up." It's also no coincidence that
Lessmore bears a striking resem
blance to silent film great Buster
Keaton.
The charming Pixar film "La
Luna" is a simple fable about how
the full moon changes into a cres
cent moon: three generations of a
family climb up to it on a ladder to
sweep the golden stars into the
right configuration. Again, this is a

film that favors imagery over dia
logue, and when we do hear the
grandfather and father "talk," it is
in the form of grumbles and guf
faws. There's not much depth to
this film, nor any particularly inno
vative animation techniques, but
like "Wall-E," it's a beautiful specta
cle.
"A Morning Stroll" is a whirl
wind tour of creative animation
techniques that all center on a sim
ple story: a man on the streets of
Manhattan observes a chicken tak
ing a stroll, knocking on the door
of a brownstone and gaining

admittance. The tale is told in 1959
with black-and-white matchstick
animation, in 2009 in bright colors
and in post-apocalyptic 2059
where the casual observer appears
to be some kind of humanoid
alien. The best sequence is in 2009:
a boy notices the chicken and
decides to start recording it on his
iPhone but quickly gets distracted
by a new and hilarious video game,
"Zombie Breakdance." The film
beautifully captures the changes in
era even the animation tech
nique for the 1950s hearken back
to simpler times but the jarring
