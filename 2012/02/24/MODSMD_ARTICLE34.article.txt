With the
release
week of their I
much-anticipat
ed second
album, "Reign of
Terror," the alter
native duo Sleigh

Bells have a chance to show the world
they're more than a one-album wonder.
The group's first album, May 2010's
"Treats," showcased a loud (very loud) rock
'n' roll-inspired sound, juxtaposed with the
sweet vocals of lead singer Alexis Krauss.
Some critics said that the Brooklyn-based
band was all noise and no quality. But fans
loved their sense of joyous rebellion, as evi
denced by the popularity of their song "Rill
Rill" (which even landed a coveted spot on
"Gossip Girl" in the fall of 2010).
"Treats," whose one-liner songs pulsed
so powerfully in the minds of its listeners,
was a loud, bold statement. Could "Reign of
Terror" be anything more than a sorry repli
ca? The answer is a resounding... maybe.
This time out, the duo which also
includes Derek Edward Miller has

turned down the volume, though "Reign of
Terror" is still plenty noisy. The songs are
longer and more authentic-sounding.
"Reign of Terror" has an almost Black Keys
esque sound, rock 'n' roll with softer emo
tion thrown in.
But the quality that makes Sleigh Bells
unique wall-punching rock paired with
sweet, surreal-sounding melodies in the
background is ever-present on "Reign of
Terror." The album's title announces

straight-up
the intended tone brutal and harsh
and the lyrics to songs like "Road to Hell,"
Demons" and "Born to Lose" live up to the
overall mood of adolescent alienation and
angst. Some have a powerful message, espe
cially "Comeback Kid," whose unforgiving
lyrics —" I know it's hard but you've gotta
deal with it" are paired with intense
instrumentals.
But angst is one thing whininess is
another. And sometimes the more melan
choly songs, like "Road to Hell," drone on
for too long. The songs sound more ethere
al and have less unique character than on
the first album they can blend together
after a few listens. The overall tone also
seems a bit muted, less free than on "Treats."
If you want high-quality, classic rock
'n' roll or astonishing vocals, Sleigh Bells
might not be your jam. But if you're look
ing for an anger-relieving scream session
and even a bit of uplift, give "Comeback
Kid" or "Born to Lose" a listen. Just don't
expect quite the new sound and badass flare
of "Treats."
