A few weeks ago, I rekindled an old
flame: the Ferry Building in San
Francisco. The Ferry Building

Marketplace is a fantasy world for
foodies and hungry college students

alike. What was originally
built in the late-19th century
as a center for ferryboat com-

muters now, after various renova-

tions, operates as a gourmet marketplace.
My renewed appreciation of the Ferry

Building arose when I attended "Food from
the Heart," a Valentine's Day-inspired food
and wine event during which various vine
yards, restaurants and merchants sold small
bites and sips for a few dollars apiece, pro
ceeds benefitting Slow Food San Francisco. At
the event, I sampled a wide array of tasty
morsels, my favorites including mushroom
empanadas, almond-encrusted chocolate
truffles and Cowgirl Creamery's Raclette a
type of cheese that was melted before your
eyes from a large wheel of cheese and served

on Acme bread with
homemade pickled vegeta
bles, a take on the Swiss
dish of the same name.
Although you may
have missed the boat (pun
intended) for this year's
"Food from the Heart," do
not fear. The Ferry Plaza
Farmers' Market is open
on Tuesdays and
Thursdays from 10 a.m. to
2 p.m. and Saturdays from
8 a.m. to 2 p.m., and it
offers shoppers a great
selection of produce and

artisanal snacks.
If you still can't make it to the Ferry
Building at those times, the inside of the

Ferry Building is home to some of the

best gourmet shops in the coun
try, open all week. My favorites
include Blue Bottle Coffee,
Cowgirl Creamery, beekind (a

honey vendor), Acme Bread Company,

. Miette (a pastry shop) and Recchiuti
Confections (a chocolatier).

While San Francisco can often seem
worlds away from Stanford, there is no better
Saturday outing than a morning at the Ferry
Plaza Farmers' Market followed by a day of
exploring the city. Take one step into this his
toric building, or take one whiff of the freshly
baked bread and cookies wafting from the
shops, and you will immediately experience
the stirrings of a gastronomic romance.
