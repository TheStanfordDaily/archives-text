Y Y months ago, a friend and I sat on
a couch and flipped our way through all the
new features cloud saves, the new inter
face, voice controls and all the rest. We dis
agreed about the benefits of some of the
changes, but at the end of the day, it was still
just Xbox LIVE. It took us about five min
utes to reach that mutual conclusion, and we
were about to move on with our day.
Then, more or less by accident, stum
bling through the unfamiliar interface we
came upon a forgotten relic of Microsoft's
online service: the Indie Games Channel.
(I feel wrong, somehow, capitalizing all three
words in that given the way Microsoft
threw the service into the ether and forgot
about it, I hesitate to think that it deserves
such dignity.)
My friend hovered his finger over the B
button for a moment before quitting back
out to the dashboard. As he did, he dis
missed the Indie channel as nothing but a
repository of shallow garbage. I couldn't
argue, really. He's not wrong.
That's a bigger shame than it might
sound. Given the massive volume of Xbox
LIVE users about 40 million, at the
moment I'm sure there were plenty of
other Joe-gamers pawing through the service's
new features last month, and probably at any
other point in time as well. For many of them,

I'm sure that the sad, derelict Indie Games
Channel is their only exposure to independent
game development. It makes a less-than-stellar
case for the value of independent game devel
opment. Add in the occasional Facebook or
Flash game, and the average consumer proba
bly has the implicit, ingrained impression that
indie games are junk.
I can see why they might assume as
much. But oh, how very wrong they are.

In coming to the defense of indie
games, I wasn't entirely sure where to begin.
Without actually sitting down and playing
through some games with my readers, it's
about as difficult as explaining the distin
guishing features of Cubism to someone

who's never heard of Pablo
Picasso.
In lieu of that, per
haps the best approach is

to take some specific examples and illustrate,
if I can, the outstanding features of each.
There are inevitably going to be a dozen ter
rible indie games for every brilliant one, but
here are a couple ways, at least, that small
time development can rise above the din.

Bringing people together Minecraft
Let's start out with a bang (and perhaps
the only game on this list that most people
have heard of). Minecraft, besides being the
most successful independent game of all
time, has fostered an enormous and tight-

| knit community by granting users
v incredible freedom to create and

share their own worlds, which

are essentially made of simple, Lego-like
blocks. Even when playing alone, though, the
game thrives on a blend accessibility, depth
and intricacy if people didn't come
together to figure out how the hell the game
even works, we'd all still be fending off creep
ers with nothing but sticks. That kind of
sparse, unguided design could have destined
the game to obscurity, but instead it brought
together millions of people to make some
legitimately staggering creations.

Proving that a new mechanic works
Bastion
Some indie games don't have any story;
Bastion is the story. The hook here, which I
really hope to see in more triple-A games, is
dynamic narration. The smooth baritone of
the narrator delivers dialogue based specifi
cally on your moment-to-moment actions
in the game, which lends a real sense of
weight to everything you're doing. Sarcasm,
sorrow, wrath and affection it's nice to
actually hear some feedback for your actions,
especially as it's happening.
So there you have it. If you want to see
what a couple guys or just one can do
with some computers and spare time, go
check out these games. The best part? You
could buy them all for less than the cost of a
new console game.

really hope to see in more triple-A games, is
dynamic narration. The smooth baritone of
the narrator delivers dialogue based specifi
cally on your moment-to-moment actions
in the game, which lends a real sense of
weight to everything you're doing. Sarcasm,
sorrow, wrath and affection it's nice to
actually hear some feedback for your actions,
especially as it's happening.
So there you have it. If you want to see
what a couple guys or just one can do
with some computers and spare time, go
check out these games. The best part? You
could buy them all for less than the cost of a
new console game.
