## ROXY SASS SCOPING OUT STANFORD 
### 
To put it bluntly, Stanford is
big, a characteristic Roxy
usually appreciates (both in
academic institutions and in men).
When it comes to finding new
hookups, there are plenty of
options, but, like the female
orgasm, they can be elusive (or so
Roxy hears ... she has little trouble
with either). Fortunately for you,
Roxy has developed a finely honed
list of the best locations to meet

your next mate.
The Gym
Roxy rarely goes to the gym
(she gets her cardio elsewhere), but
she's been known to put in an
appearance at Arrillaga once in a
while to supplement her ordinary
workout regimen. While Stanford
students are generally pretty fit, the
people who go to the gym are
especially so. And if looks are
something you care about (and
let's be real, Roxy puts the super in
superficial), the gym is a good
place to weed out any fatties. Plus,
Roxy considers it an excellent pre
view: if she likes what she sees
when a guy is sweaty and full of
adrenaline, she knows one great
way to get a private showing.
The Dinner Table

To be clear, Roxy does not
endorse dormcest, though she's
certainly had her fair share of it
(Roxy's a go-getter if she sees
something, or someone, she likes,
she doesn't let things like common
sense get in the way). However,
she's found that friends of house
mates make much better targets: all
the perks of dormcest without any
of the consequences. They're often

around, providing, well,
easy access (Roxy would
rather have her men hard

than hard to get). When the bon
ing gets boring, though, they can
make themselves scarce.
Classes

This category depends on
your academic background, of
course: pickings can be slim in cer
tain techie departments. But when
you do meet a cutie at office hours
or exchange glances across a
crowded lecture hall, Roxy suggests
you make your move. You've got at
least one thing in common and,
more importantly, an easy in: the
transition from p-set buddies t0...
other... buddies is surprisingly
easy, and if you're already spending
late nights studying for chem or
bio, you might as well study some
anatomy as well.

Stuck in techie classes without any
prospects? Roxy's always down for
some "interdisciplinary research."
