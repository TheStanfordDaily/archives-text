### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kristian Davis Bailey 
Gerry Weitz, a highly-celebrat
ed information systems director
for the University and the School
of Medicine, died of a stroke Feb. 8
in Albany, Calif., at the age of 67.
"Gerry was one of those rare
people who was held in extremely
high esteem by seemingly every
body," said Michael Halaas, chief
technology officer at the School of
Medicine, in a press release. "He
was fantastic as a boss and mentor,
and always made everybody feel
that he cared about them person
ally. He took the time to get to
know people and established deep
friendships with a wide variety of
individuals at Stanford in away
that is really remarkable."
Having studied physics and
graduated from UC-Berkeley in
1968, Weitz worked at IBM for a
few years before beginning his ca
reer at Stanford in 1974. During his
career, which spanned more than
30 years, Weitz moved between
various roles on the University

level and positions in the School of
Medicine.
After his first seven years of
service, Weitz was named the Uni
versity's director of financial infor
mation systems in 1981. In this po
sition, Weitz helped create the
Stanford University Financial In
formation Network and the Stan
ford Network for Acquisitions and
Payables, among other financial
systems.
Through his work, Weitz ush
ered in the age of online reporting
and paperless transactions for the
University.
Weitz began his work with the
School of Medicine in 1987, when
he began his role as co-director of
the Information Systems Group.
"I recall being amazed that
there were actually people out
there like Gerry, who understood
both IT and administrative infor
mation," said David O'Brien, di
rector of the Office of Institutional
Planning at the School of Medi
cine. "We'd not had anybody like
that at the school before."

Weitz went back to the Univer
sity side of operations in 1998,
when he began a position as direc
tor of information systems archi
tecture and oversaw Y2K efforts.
In 2000, Weitz returned to the
School of Medicine to direct
MedlT, now Information Re
sources & Technology (IRT).
Among Weitz's achievements
during this time were replacing all
mainframe systems with new tech
nologies, overseeing the expansion
of the school's network and intro
ducing wireless technology into
the system.
Weitz retired from his position
as the director of IRT for the
School of Medicine in 2007, at
which point he was granted emeri
tus status.
"Gerry's combination of tech
nical experience along with his
deep understanding of school and
department administrative
processes and his calm, approach
able manner made him a unique
and valued contributor," Linda
Mclntyre, a retired Stanford busi

ness analyst who worked with
Weitz for more than 15 years, said
upon his retirement in 2007.
"Gerry made us better for hav
ing known him," O'Brien said.

A memorial service will be held
from 2 to 4 p.m. on Saturday,
March 3 at the Millie and Paul
Berg Hall in the Li Ka Shing Cen
ter for Learning and Knowledge.
