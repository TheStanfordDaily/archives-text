## Violence against women 'issue of our time,' says playwright 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
"Every single day I ask one question:
how do we end violence against women
and girls?" said Tony Award-winning play
wright Eve Ensler Thursday evening to a
crowd of over 200 at Paul Brest Hall. "This
is the central issue of our time. Women are
the carriers of lives; to undermine or hurt
women is to destroy the future."
Ensler wrote The Vagina Monologues,
which since first performed in 1997

has been translated into over 48 languages
and performed in over 140 countries. In
1998, Ensler founded the V-Day move
ment, a global activist movement aimed at
ending violence toward women by raising
public awareness and partnering with
local organizations worldwide.
In the last 11 years, the V-Day move
ment has raised over $ll million.
Ensler said that she was inspired to
begin her work in part because of "the con-

sequence of violence, trauma and
cruelty in my life that I experi
enced as a child."
At Stanford, students host an
annual V-Week, with a perform
ance of The Vagina Monologues as
the cornerstone of the weekend
long event. This year, the program
will be held from April 18 to 20.
"Her work has been transfor
mative in changing conceptions
about female sexuality, female em
powerment and the role that vio
lence plays in women's lives
around the world," said Viviana
Arcia 'l3, president of the Stan
ford's Women Coalition, which
was a co-sponsor of the event.
"And that is the mission of
Stanford V-Week increasing
awareness of violence against
women and empowering female
sexuality," Arcia added. "Stanford
fits into the mission of V-Day and
Vagina Monologues because sexu
al and intimate partner violence
does occur on this campus and it is
a significant problem in our com
munity."
Leslie Brian 'l2, president of V-
Week at Stanford, introduced En
sler as someone who "envisions a
planet where women can thrive
rather than just survive."
Ensler started her talk by re
flecting on the growing level of so
cial activism for women world
wide.
"This year we will have over
5,300 V-Day events in 2,000 places
from Stanford to Qatar," Ensler
said.
Recently, V-Day partnered
with UNICEF to open the City of
Joy, a rehabilitation center built
for and by survivors of sexual vio
lence in the Congo.
Ensler said building the center
was " a crazy thing to do, but every
thing V-Day does is crazy."
Ensler said that her work ad
dressing the situation in the
Congo, where over half a million
women have been raped, tortured
and abused, "lives in the center of
[her] heart."
"I will never be the same," En
sler said. "When you witness that
kind of atrocity, you are responsi
ble for responding," she said. "The
Congo is one of the great failings
of the century, and we are allowing
it to go on. Remember that a lot of
our cell phones and luxury goods
can be traced to mines in the
Congo."
Ensler emphasized the role of
theater in human rights and
women's empowerment, explain-

ing how it can spark personal dis
covery, activate people and change
consciousness.
She said that one billion
women alive now will be raped or
beaten in their lifetime.
"Violence is the bulwark of pa
triarchy and sexism," Ensler said.
"There is an ongoing message to
women that if you are too free, too
sexual or too powerful, you will be
hurt, raped and murdered."
Addressing those who join her
in her movement, Ensler said, we
must "stop apologizing for our in
tensity."
She criticized large govern
mental and international institu
tions for being patriarchal and
fixed, arguing that change will
have to rise from the people on the
ground.
According to Ensler, men can
and should play a role in helping
end gender-based violence.
"Think of your mothers, wives
and sisters," Ensler said. "Men are
not making [violence against
women] their business and their
outrage."
Ensler closed with the piece
"Refuser" from her new novel, "I
am an Emotional Creature: The
Secret Life of Girls Around the
World." The reading electrified
the audience, which gave her a
standing ovation.
Some audience members
shared their personal experiences
and thanked Ensler for her inspi
ration, while others asked ques
tions concerning how men view
masculinity and the role of being a
woman in today's modernized
world.
"I've read a couple of her
books in the past and as amazing
as they are, I was totally unpre
pared for how powerful it would
be to witness her in person," said
audience member Lily Steyer 'l5.
"After hearing her talk, I under
stand how she, even as just one
woman, was able to start a global
movement she's that inspir
