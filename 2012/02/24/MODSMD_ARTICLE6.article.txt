# Financial aid, tuition set to rise
## Three-percent increase lower than peer institutions 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Financial aid packages are expected to rise in
response to the Board of Trustee 's decision earlier
this month to approve a 3-percent tuition increase
for the 2012-13 academic year, according to Direc
tor of Financial Aid Karen Cooper.
The tuition increase for undergraduates is the
lowest rise in 40 years, according to Assistant Vice
President for University Communications Lisa
Lapin.The Board of Trustees raised tuition by 3.5
percent during each of the past four years, by 5.17
percent for the 2007-08 academic year and by 5.4
percent for the 2006-07 academic year.
"Our commitment to meet full need for contin
uing students has not changed," Cooper said in an
email to The Daily. "As costs go up, if a student's
need increases, their financial aid eligibility will
also increase."
The Board of Trustees announced the increase
in tuition fees Feb. 6, after evaluating rising costs
the University incurs. Undergraduate and general
graduate tuition will both rise from $40,500 to
$41,250 next year. Graduate engineering tuition
will climb from $42,660 to 43,950 and law school
tuition will increase from $47,460 to $48,870.
Including a 3.5-percent increase for room and
board, the annual cost of an undergraduate Stan
ford education will now be $54,506 instead of
$52,341.
"Tuition recommendations are made to the
Board of Trustees after a financial analysis of the
University's estimated income from all sources
not only tuition, but endowment revenue and re
search revenue and estimated expenses, includ
ing anticipated financial aid rewards," Lapin said.
The Financial Aid Office hopes that news of a
price increase will not deter prospective appli
cants who feel they may not be able to afford a
Stanford education. Students from lower-income
backgrounds and abroad are of special concern,
according to Cooper.
She said that that the Financial Aid Office does
not plan to deviate from the commitment it made
four years ago to allow students from families with
a total annual income of less than $60,000 to at
tend Stanford without paying at all.
Similarly, students from families with a total an
nual income less than $lOO,OOO will receive at least
enough scholarship funds to cover tuition.
International students often do not receive
need-blind admission, but are still assisted by the
Financial Aid Office, Cooper added.
"For admitted international students who indi
cate they will need assistance during the admission
process, we have the same commitment to meet
full need," Cooper said. "While the same income
figures may not apply for those living in other
countries, the spirit still applies."
According to Lapin, 49 percent of Stanford stu
dents receive need-based aid, while 79 percent re
ceive some form of financial assistance. Financial
aid to undergraduates has doubled since 2008,
Lapin said.
Cooper said that the University Budget Com
mittee is currently considering whether to in
crease the portion students are expected to con
tribute to their University bills through an aca
demic year job or federal work study. Students are
currently expected to pay up to $5,000, compared
to $4,500 prior to the 2008-09 academic year.
Work study is a component of the University
bill that the Financial Aid Office feels students can
earn through a combination of summer and aca
demic earnings in order avoid student loans,
Cooper said. According to Cooper, the Committee
should have a decision within a few weeks about
whether to increase work study again.
Stanford's fee hike corresponds with similar in-
creases at peer institutions.
For the 2012-13 academic
year, Princeton University in
creased its tuition by 4.5 percent,
which the university said would
be offset by expanding its finan
cial aid budget by 5.5 percent.
"Our financial aid recipients
are more or less protected from
tuition increases because as tu
ition goes up, aid also goes up,"
said Princeton Financial Aid Di
rector Robin Moscato. "Aid gen
erally goes up more than the in
crease in our costs. We keep our
net price down by providing in
creased aid every year."
Harvard and Yale raised their
tuition by 3.8 percent and 5.8 per
cent, respectively, last year. At
time of publication, these two
universities had not made any of
ficial announcements regarding
tuition increases for the upcom
ing academic year.
Lapin noted that percentage
increases among universities will
vary accordingly, since private
universities determine tuition in
dependently, based on different
considerations and cost models.
"When average cost of atten
dance is calculated, which in
cludes what students actually pay
on average after financial aid,
Stanford is usually relatively low
among private universities,"
Lapin said.
According to Lapin, Stan
ford's tuition is below the median
for its peer group, which she said
is comprised of 15 private univer
sities.

Despite consistent tuition in
creases of at least three percent
in the past four academic years,
Stanford undergraduate and
graduate students and their fami
lies have not been asked to take
on a significantly larger financial
burden. Cooper said.
The University of California
Board of Regents increased tu
ition at state universities by 18
percent during the current aca
demic year.
Affordable higher education
has been a central concern for
student Occupy movements. Stu
dent participants in the Occupy
Stanford movement will join stu
dents and activists from around
the state in Berkeley next Thurs
day to engage in a rally support
ing public education.

One of the demands of Occu
py Education California, the
group organizing the protest and
a weeklong series of events, is
"universal and free public educa
tion," according to the group's
site.

not plan to deviate from the commitment it made
four years ago to allow students from families with
a total annual income of less than $60,000 to at
tend Stanford without paying at all.
Similarly, students from families with a total an
nual income less than $lOO,OOO will receive at least
enough scholarship funds to cover tuition.
International students often do not receive
need-blind admission, but are still assisted by the
Financial Aid Office, Cooper added.
"For admitted international students who indi
cate they will need assistance during the admission
process, we have the same commitment to meet
full need," Cooper said. "While the same income
figures may not apply for those living in other
countries, the spirit still applies."
According to Lapin, 49 percent of Stanford stu
dents receive need-based aid, while 79 percent re
ceive some form of financial assistance. Financial
aid to undergraduates has doubled since 2008,
Lapin said.
Cooper said that the University Budget Com
mittee is currently considering whether to in
crease the portion students are expected to con
tribute to their University bills through an aca
demic year job or federal work study. Students are
currently expected to pay up to $5,000, compared
to $4,500 prior to the 2008-09 academic year.
Work study is a component of the University
bill that the Financial Aid Office feels students can
earn through a combination of summer and aca
demic earnings in order avoid student loans,
Cooper said. According to Cooper, the Committee
should have a decision within a few weeks about
whether to increase work study again.
Stanford's fee hike corresponds with similar in-
creases at peer institutions.
For the 2012-13 academic
year, Princeton University in
creased its tuition by 4.5 percent,
which the university said would
be offset by expanding its finan
cial aid budget by 5.5 percent.
"Our financial aid recipients
are more or less protected from
tuition increases because as tu
ition goes up, aid also goes up,"
said Princeton Financial Aid Di
rector Robin Moscato. "Aid gen
erally goes up more than the in
crease in our costs. We keep our
net price down by providing in
creased aid every year."
Harvard and Yale raised their
tuition by 3.8 percent and 5.8 per
cent, respectively, last year. At
time of publication, these two
universities had not made any of
ficial announcements regarding
tuition increases for the upcom
ing academic year.
Lapin noted that percentage
increases among universities will
vary accordingly, since private
universities determine tuition in
dependently, based on different
considerations and cost models.
"When average cost of atten
dance is calculated, which in
cludes what students actually pay
on average after financial aid,
Stanford is usually relatively low
among private universities,"
Lapin said.
According to Lapin, Stan
ford's tuition is below the median
for its peer group, which she said
is comprised of 15 private univer
sities.

Despite consistent tuition in
creases of at least three percent
in the past four academic years,
Stanford undergraduate and
graduate students and their fami
lies have not been asked to take
on a significantly larger financial
burden. Cooper said.
The University of California
Board of Regents increased tu
ition at state universities by 18
percent during the current aca
demic year.
Affordable higher education
has been a central concern for
student Occupy movements. Stu
dent participants in the Occupy
Stanford movement will join stu
dents and activists from around
the state in Berkeley next Thurs
day to engage in a rally support
ing public education.

One of the demands of Occu
py Education California, the
group organizing the protest and
a weeklong series of events, is
"universal and free public educa
tion," according to the group's
site.

Financial aid packages are expected to rise in
response to the Board of Trustee 's decision earlier
this month to approve a 3-percent tuition increase
for the 2012-13 academic year, according to Direc
tor of Financial Aid Karen Cooper.
The tuition increase for undergraduates is the
lowest rise in 40 years, according to Assistant Vice
President for University Communications Lisa
Lapin.The Board of Trustees raised tuition by 3.5
percent during each of the past four years, by 5.17
percent for the 2007-08 academic year and by 5.4
percent for the 2006-07 academic year.
"Our commitment to meet full need for contin
uing students has not changed," Cooper said in an
email to The Daily. "As costs go up, if a student's
need increases, their financial aid eligibility will
also increase."
The Board of Trustees announced the increase
in tuition fees Feb. 6, after evaluating rising costs
the University incurs. Undergraduate and general
graduate tuition will both rise from $40,500 to
$41,250 next year. Graduate engineering tuition
will climb from $42,660 to 43,950 and law school
tuition will increase from $47,460 to $48,870.
Including a 3.5-percent increase for room and
board, the annual cost of an undergraduate Stan
ford education will now be $54,506 instead of
$52,341.
"Tuition recommendations are made to the
Board of Trustees after a financial analysis of the
University's estimated income from all sources
not only tuition, but endowment revenue and re
search revenue and estimated expenses, includ
ing anticipated financial aid rewards," Lapin said.
The Financial Aid Office hopes that news of a
price increase will not deter prospective appli
cants who feel they may not be able to afford a
Stanford education. Students from lower-income
backgrounds and abroad are of special concern,
according to Cooper.
She said that that the Financial Aid Office does
not plan to deviate from the commitment it made
four years ago to allow students from families with
a total annual income of less than $60,000 to at
tend Stanford without paying at all.
Similarly, students from families with a total an
nual income less than $lOO,OOO will receive at least
enough scholarship funds to cover tuition.

need-blind admission, but are still assisted by the
Financial Aid Office, Cooper added.
