## FacSen debates new freshmen requirements 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate discussed
financial conflicts of interest and
proposed changes to freshman
year academic requirements at
its meeting Thursday.
Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. 'B2, currently acting presi

dent due to University President
John Hennessy's recent depar
ture for a sabbatical, opened the
meeting by giving an optimistic
outlook on the University's
budget. While noting that eco
nomic uncertainty still necessi
tates a degree of caution in plan
ning future spending, he said,
"The current projection for next

year is quite good."
Etchemendy commented that
the University has no plans to re
verse budget cuts undertaken
during the recession, except in
the cases of Overseas Seminars
and Sophomore College. He
added that spending on financial
aid has increased as a result of el
evated demand, both because of

the recession and the Universi
ty's efforts to reach out to
prospective students from low
income families.
"The financial aid budget con
tinues to go up at a remarkable
rate," Etchemendy said. "Many
more students because of
family circumstances have
sought financial aid [in recent
years]."
Conflicts of interest
Chair of the Academic Coun
cil's Committee on Research
Peter Michelson and Dean of Re
search Ann Arvin presented to
the Senate a revised Faculty Poli
cy on Conflict of Commitment
and Interest.
The revised document,
prompted by new federal regula
tions about conflicts of interest,
seeks to define the various types
of conflicts, establish conditions
for the disclosure of conflicts to
the University and formalize how
the University reviews such con
flicts.
According to Michelson, one
of the University's missions
the transfer of knowledge from
University research to the private
sector commonly results in
conflicts of interest. Michelson
said that while faculty "should be
rewarded for their participation"
in this transfer, the University
should also re vise its conflict of in
terest policies to promote more
stringent guidelines and encour
age a greater degree of pre-emp
tive public disclosure.
While members of the Senate
expressed general agreement
with the revised policy's concept
and intent, several disputed the
phrasing and stringency of the
new document.
Philosophy professor Debra
Satz argued that the revised docu
ment defined conflicts of interest
identified as "considerations of
personal financial gain" —in an
excessively narrow manner, inad
vertently excluding other forms of
compensation that are not strictly
monetary. Satz also advocated ex
panded efforts to inform faculty of
the policy's nuance.
"There's a problem in the Uni
versity as to what the document
asks for," Satz said. "A lot of facul
ty don't understand what a con
flict of interest is, so we could do a
better job of educating them."
Faculty members also drew at
tention to inconsistencies and am
biguity in the document, as well as
the lack of a clearly established
appeals process. Computer sci
ence professor Eric Roberts
called for further details on feder

al conflict of interest regulations
to be made available to faculty by
the University's Office of Gener
al Counsel.
Given the number of alter
ations suggested by faculty mem
bers, Etchemendy suggested that
the motion for the policy's ap
proval be tabled pending revi
sions and editing. The revised pol
icy, and a similar one governing
faculty time commitments to out
side consulting, will be brought
before the Faculty Senate for vot
ing on March 8.
Freshman-year requirements
The Senate then heard a re
port by the Committee on Under
graduate Standards and Policy
(C-USP) on proposed academic
changes to the freshman year, de
livered by C-USP Chair Judy
Goldstein.
C-USP offered "guidelines for
how freshman requirements
could be organized following the
Study on Undergraduate Educa
tion at Stanford's (SUES) recom
mendations," Goldstein said.
"We're bringing forward those
recommendations in away con
sistent with Stanford tradition
and policy," she added.

The SUES committee present
ed its over 100-page report on the
goals of a Stanford education at
the Faculty Senate's Jan. 26 meet
ing. The committee suggested 55
changes to improve undergradu
ate education.

C-USP's report recommended
the gradual implementation of a
suggestion that would require
freshmen take two courses in ad
dition to the Program in Writing
and Rhetoric (PWR). One
"Thinking Matters" course and
one Freshman Seminar would re

place the current Introduction to
the Humanities (IHUM) pro
gram, which spans three quarters
and has been mandatory for
freshmen since 1996. The Struc
tured Liberal Education (SLE)
program would continue unal
tered as an alternative to these re
quirements.
Goldstein acknowledged that
discussion within C-USP had
been contentious, especially on
the issue of requiring freshmen to
take a Freshman Seminar. The
Senate further debated this sub
ject.
James Campbell, co-chair of
the SUES committee, said that C
USP's suggestion of gradually
phasing in the seminar require
ment is a prudent one. He added
that a new algorithm would allow
both students and faculty to shape
the composition of students in
seminars, but added that this
would likely face some initial
problems.
"We've thought a lot about the
pros and cons," Campbell said. "I
don't believe that students will ex
perience this as an onerous re
quirement ... We have faith that
students will view this not as a re
quirement but as an institutional

license to explore,"
"Freshman seminars are a
treasure," added electrical engi
neering professor Andrea Gold
smith. "If we can make it a com
mon experience for our fresh
men, it would be an amazing
change to our undergraduate ex
perience."
Ralph Cohen, a mathematics
professor, expressed concerns
about the burden imposed on aca
demic departments by the seminar
requirement, arguing that com
pensation from the Office of the
Vice Provost of Undergraduate
Education to support these pro
grams is inadequate and does not
fully account for the loss of experi
enced faculty to smaller classes.
Russell Berman, director of the
IFIUM and Introductory Seminar
programs, acknowledged that
there might be initial issues with
providing seminars in areas of high
demand, but emphasized that
feedback for seminars in their cur
rent form has been consistently
positive from both students and
faculty.
Campbell added that 600 fresh
men every year go without enroll
ment in a seminar, with at-risk and
minority students overrepresent
ed in that figure. He argued that
the seminar requirement would
offer invaluable benefits in allow
ing students to forge personal rela
tionships with faculty.
Tom Wasow, a linguistics pro
fessor, called for a debate on the
impact of the introduction of the
Thinking Matters program, argu
ing that creating a program from
scratch especially in fields be
yond the humanities would
pose significant challenges.
Campbell, however, noted that
the current list of Thinking Mat
ters courses proposed for 2012-13
encompasses fields from medi
cine to law to history, asserting
that "the courses are throwing
open the doors of the University
to our students."
"I have faith in our students,
and in our faculty," Campbell con
cluded, adding that the success of
the recommendations will de
pend on the enthusiasm of their
implementation. "This presents
some hazards and trade-offs, but I
believe that this University can do
this," he said.

The Faculty Senate will further
discuss C-USP's recommenda
tions and vote on the SUES rec
ommendations on March 8.

policy at a Faculty Senate meeting Thursday afternoon. The Senate also addressed potential repercussions
from SUES panel recomendations on first year requirements.
The Faculty Senate discussed
financial conflicts of interest and
proposed changes to freshman
year academic requirements at
its meeting Thursday.
Provost John Etchemendy
Ph.D. 'B2, currently acting presi

dent due to University President
John Hennessy's recent depar
ture for a sabbatical, opened the
meeting by giving an optimistic
outlook on the University's
budget. While noting that eco
nomic uncertainty still necessi
tates a degree of caution in plan
ning future spending, he said,
"The current projection for next

year is quite good."
Etchemendy commented that
the University has no plans to re
verse budget cuts undertaken
during the recession, except in
the cases of Overseas Seminars
and Sophomore College. He
added that spending on financial
aid has increased as a result of el
evated demand, both because of

the recession and the Universi
ty's efforts to reach out to
prospective students from low
income families.
"The financial aid budget con
tinues to go up at a remarkable
rate," Etchemendy said. "Many
more students because of
family circumstances have
sought financial aid [in recent
years]."
Conflicts of interest
Chair of the Academic Coun
cil's Committee on Research
Peter Michelson and Dean of Re
search Ann Arvin presented to
the Senate a revised Faculty Poli
cy on Conflict of Commitment
and Interest.
The revised document,
prompted by new federal regula
tions about conflicts of interest,
seeks to define the various types
of conflicts, establish conditions
for the disclosure of conflicts to
the University and formalize how
the University reviews such con
flicts.
According to Michelson, one
of the University's missions
the transfer of knowledge from
University research to the private
sector commonly results in
conflicts of interest. Michelson
said that while faculty "should be
rewarded for their participation"
in this transfer, the University
should also re vise its conflict of in
terest policies to promote more
stringent guidelines and encour
age a greater degree of pre-emp
tive public disclosure.
While members of the Senate
expressed general agreement
with the revised policy's concept
and intent, several disputed the
phrasing and stringency of the
new document.
Philosophy professor Debra
Satz argued that the revised docu
ment defined conflicts of interest
identified as "considerations of
personal financial gain" —in an
excessively narrow manner, inad
vertently excluding other forms of
compensation that are not strictly
monetary. Satz also advocated ex
panded efforts to inform faculty of
the policy's nuance.
"There's a problem in the Uni
versity as to what the document
asks for," Satz said. "A lot of facul
ty don't understand what a con
flict of interest is, so we could do a
better job of educating them."
Faculty members also drew at
tention to inconsistencies and am
biguity in the document, as well as
the lack of a clearly established
appeals process. Computer sci
ence professor Eric Roberts
called for further details on feder

al conflict of interest regulations
to be made available to faculty by
the University's Office of Gener
al Counsel.
Given the number of alter
ations suggested by faculty mem
bers, Etchemendy suggested that
the motion for the policy's ap
proval be tabled pending revi
sions and editing. The revised pol
icy, and a similar one governing
faculty time commitments to out
side consulting, will be brought
before the Faculty Senate for vot
ing on March 8.
Freshman-year requirements
The Senate then heard a re
port by the Committee on Under
graduate Standards and Policy
(C-USP) on proposed academic
changes to the freshman year, de
livered by C-USP Chair Judy
Goldstein.
C-USP offered "guidelines for
how freshman requirements
could be organized following the
Study on Undergraduate Educa
tion at Stanford's (SUES) recom
mendations," Goldstein said.
"We're bringing forward those
recommendations in away con
sistent with Stanford tradition
and policy," she added.

The SUES committee present
ed its over 100-page report on the
goals of a Stanford education at
the Faculty Senate's Jan. 26 meet
ing. The committee suggested 55
changes to improve undergradu
ate education.

C-USP's report recommended
the gradual implementation of a
suggestion that would require
freshmen take two courses in ad
dition to the Program in Writing
and Rhetoric (PWR). One
"Thinking Matters" course and
one Freshman Seminar would re

place the current Introduction to
the Humanities (IHUM) pro
gram, which spans three quarters
and has been mandatory for
freshmen since 1996. The Struc
tured Liberal Education (SLE)
program would continue unal
tered as an alternative to these re
quirements.
Goldstein acknowledged that
discussion within C-USP had
been contentious, especially on
the issue of requiring freshmen to
take a Freshman Seminar. The
Senate further debated this sub
ject.
James Campbell, co-chair of
the SUES committee, said that C
USP's suggestion of gradually
phasing in the seminar require
ment is a prudent one. He added
that a new algorithm would allow
both students and faculty to shape
the composition of students in
seminars, but added that this
would likely face some initial
problems.
"We've thought a lot about the
pros and cons," Campbell said. "I
don't believe that students will ex
perience this as an onerous re
quirement ... We have faith that
students will view this not as a re
quirement but as an institutional

license to explore,"
"Freshman seminars are a
treasure," added electrical engi
neering professor Andrea Gold
smith. "If we can make it a com
mon experience for our fresh
men, it would be an amazing
change to our undergraduate ex
perience."
Ralph Cohen, a mathematics
professor, expressed concerns
about the burden imposed on aca
demic departments by the seminar
requirement, arguing that com
pensation from the Office of the
Vice Provost of Undergraduate
Education to support these pro
grams is inadequate and does not
fully account for the loss of experi
enced faculty to smaller classes.
Russell Berman, director of the
IFIUM and Introductory Seminar
programs, acknowledged that
there might be initial issues with
providing seminars in areas of high
demand, but emphasized that
feedback for seminars in their cur
rent form has been consistently
positive from both students and
faculty.
Campbell added that 600 fresh
men every year go without enroll
ment in a seminar, with at-risk and
minority students overrepresent
ed in that figure. He argued that
the seminar requirement would
offer invaluable benefits in allow
ing students to forge personal rela
tionships with faculty.
Tom Wasow, a linguistics pro
fessor, called for a debate on the
impact of the introduction of the
Thinking Matters program, argu
ing that creating a program from
scratch especially in fields be
yond the humanities would
pose significant challenges.
Campbell, however, noted that
the current list of Thinking Mat
ters courses proposed for 2012-13
encompasses fields from medi
cine to law to history, asserting
that "the courses are throwing
open the doors of the University
to our students."
"I have faith in our students,
and in our faculty," Campbell con
cluded, adding that the success of
the recommendations will de

implementation. "This presents

fessor, called for a debate on the
impact of the introduction of the
Thinking Matters program, argu
ing that creating a program from
scratch especially in fields be
yond the humanities would
pose significant challenges.
Campbell, however, noted that
the current list of Thinking Mat
ters courses proposed for 2012-13
encompasses fields from medi
cine to law to history, asserting
that "the courses are throwing
open the doors of the University
to our students."
"I have faith in our students,
and in our faculty," Campbell con
cluded, adding that the success of
the recommendations will de
pend on the enthusiasm of their
implementation. "This presents
some hazards and trade-offs, but I
believe that this University can do
this," he said.

The Faculty Senate will further
discuss C-USP's recommenda
tions and vote on the SUES rec
ommendations on March 8.
