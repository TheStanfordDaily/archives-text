# Shots more effective than IVs in treating grand mal seizures, study shows
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Alice Phillips 
A team of researchers found that
administering a quick shot of anti
convulsant medication with a
spring-loaded syringe is as effective
in treating prolonged seizures that
do not occur in hospitals as using an
intravenous line to administer the
medication directly to the blood
stream.
According to James Quinn, a
professor of emergency medicine at
the Stanford School of Medicine,
the benefit of using a shot to treat a
full seizure rather than starting an
IV is that it takes less accuracy to ad
minister a shot increasing the
chance of success and decreasing
the risk that either the patient or the
person starting the IV will get inad
vertently pricked by the needle.
Among patients to whom the
shot was administered, 73 percent
were free of seizure symptoms by
the time they arrived at the hospital.
Among patients receiving the IV

treatment, that number is 63 per
cent. The patients in these trials
could be treated with the shot in the
study because of federal rules allow
ing exemptions to those who give in
formed consent in order to conduct
studies that involve life-threatening
situations.

In order to implement the trial,
approximately 250 Santa Clara and
San Mateo firefighters had to be
trained to conduct research.

The study, published Feb. 16 in
the New England Journal of Medi
cine, was authored by Stanford re
searchers alongside researchers
from 16 other universities and hos
pitals across the nation. The Nation
al Institutes of Health and the Bio
medical Advanced Research and
Development Authority funded the
study.The Department of Defense's
Chemical Biological Medical Sys
tems Joint Project Management Of

ringe injectors.
