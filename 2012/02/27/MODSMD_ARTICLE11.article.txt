## Digitizing healthy habits 
### MADELINE SIDES 
Between lectures, labs,
problem sets and
midterms, making well
informed food decisions
can be a challenge for
busy students. Add the constraints
of location and time, and smart eat
ing becomes even more difficult.
Enter Awardly, a new location
based iPhone app founded by
Stanford alumnus Giilin Yilmaz
M.S. 'O4 MBA 'll and Claire Mc-
Donnell, a Bay Area resident and
Fulbright Scholar. Awardly is an
iPhone app that allows users to
quickly make informed food
choices in the hopes that it will en
courage positive change in stu
dents' food behavior.
The app uses GPS technology
and menu information to guide
user food choices based on nutri
tional goals such as maximizing ac
ademic performance or achieving
a high level of fitness.
According to Yilmaz, she and
McDonnell are entrepreneurs
who want to "use technology to
bring scalable solutions to people."
The creators met in 2011
through an entrepreneurial incu
bation program created by Inno
vation Endeavors, a Palo Alto
based venture capital firm. The
program connects entrepreneurs
who are interested in addressing
similar problems through their
work, and the duo hit it off from
the very beginning.
"We are lucky because we have
aligned interests, diverse skill sets
and similar values," Yilmaz said. "[I
am] interested in using technology
as a platform to help people make
behavioral changes. In this case,
the interest is in food behavioral
change."
Yilmaz was inspired by her ex

perience living in the United
States. Before arriving at Stanford
to attend graduate school, she
lived in Turkey, the United King
dom and France.
"I was shocked to see how peo
ple were eating in the U.S. and ac
tually ended up putting on about
25 pounds in my first three months
here," she said. "I have a personal
passion around understanding
food decisions, especially for
young people, and using technolo
gy to make an impact."
McDonnell, Awardly co
founder and chief operating offi
cer, also cites her personal experi
ence as her impetus for starting the
organization. McDonnell is a man
agement consultant and certified
yoga instructor who attributes her
drive to bring healthy living to a
broader audience to the goal-ori
ented nature of her career.
"As a yoga instructor, I think
about achieving goals on a person
al level," McDonnell said. "That is
really the animating spirit of our
company it's all about helping
individuals who have a goal. We've
developed an application that
helps them use food to accomplish
that goal."
McDonnell and Yilmaz did not
set out to create an iPhone app
when they began the project.
"We had no intention, initially,
of building an iPhone app," Mc-
Donnell said. "We had an intention
of solving a problem, and the
iPhone app is the way we are solv
ing that problem."
"Claire and I differ a little bit
from the typical Silicon Valley en
trepreneurs," Yilmaz said. "They
may come up with an idea that is
cool and say 'Let us build this and
see if people use it.' Instead, we
chose the need ... and we went
out and talked to people."
"We spoke with about two hun

dred [people] in total... and let
them design the solution for us,"
she added. "What we realized is
that they are all on their phones, so
the solution must be mobile."
In developing the specific nutri
tional options Awardly presents to
its users, the creators consulted
Tami Lyon, registered dietician
and founder of Healthy Living Nu
tritional Counseling.
"I provided [Yilmaz and Mc-
Donnell] with guidance on the nu
tritional aspects of how to provide
challenges to users in away that is
easy to understand and easy to
apply," Lyon said. The scientific

background that Lyon provided is
embedded in the app's design, and
users are presented with simple
choices that encourage healthier
behavior.
When users decide to eat at a
specific restaurant, they open
Awardly and the app uses GPS to
identify the restaurant. Then users
choose their "goal" for their up
coming meal, and Awardly gives
suggestions on choices they can
make to help reach these goals
based on available menu items.
The app may identify a menu item
that is best for brainpower or make
generalized suggestions like

choosing leafy green vegetables
over potato chips.
Each time users successfully
complete a challenge, they earn
points within the app. Users can
eventually save up enough points
to get real-life rewards from the
app, such as iTunes credit. Current
ly, the app is being beta tested by a
group of Stanford students.
"What we have seen is that al
most everyone using the product
has made changes in the way they
eat," McDonnell said.
