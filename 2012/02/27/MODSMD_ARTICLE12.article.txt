# SPORTING APPEAL
## Stanford Intramural Sports Program brings recreational sports to students

/% However, the teams "Gazebo Gorillas" or
are also in the realm of Stan
ford athletics.These intramurals sports teams are two of
more than 1,000 other uniquely named teams.
As part of its mission statement, the Intramurals
Sports Program "recognizes the need of a recreation
al environment" for Stanford students, a goal
that Travis Jew, coordinator of intramural
sports, aims to fulfill.
Jew joined the Intramural Sports
Program 18 months ago and became
the head of the program in October.
"I had a passion for intramurals
because I used to play them all the
time as an undergrad in college," Jew
said.
The first part of Jew's vision was initiating a
new online system of registration and communica
tion.
"Our goal is to interact with students, and for the
teams to communicate more with each other," Jew
said.
Launched this winter quarter, the system includes
features such as most valuable player awards for each
game and an online message board. One of the bigger
improvements is cutting down on forfeits with the
ability to reschedule games, which is facilitated by the
online system.
The new online system is only one improvement in
the larger scope of the program. According to Jew, an
other principal need is to reach out to more students
by offering a wider variety of sports.
"There is a huge need to appeal to every student on
campus," Jew said. "Not everybody likes basketball.
Not everybody plays volleyball. Not everybody knows
how to throw a Frisbee. [But] we are trying to get every
student plugged into at least one sport."
In an effort to address this issue, the program now
offers new sports, while still maintaining the classics
such as basketball, volleyball and soccer.
"[We have] different sports for people who aren't
comfortable with the traditional sports and can now
play some fun, wacky sport," Jew said.
Broomball, added this quarter, is an example of such
a "fun, wacky sport." The sport is very similar to ice
hockey except that the participants run in tennis shoes
and play with "brooms," or square-shaped plastic sticks.
Timothy Szwarc M.S. 'O9 Ph.D. 'l5, who played
broomball as an undergraduate at Cornell University,
where hockey fans and ice rinks abound, now plays
through Stanford Intramurals.

"It's fun to see students who can write award-win
ning papers be able to score a goal in broomball and cel
ebrate winning a game," Szwarc said.
Despite being nontraditional, a recent intramural
broomball tournament had more than 90 participants.
Since 2006, there have been six new league sports
introduced into the program, including inner tube
water polo, billiards, squash, table tennis and bad
minton. This expansion is now looking to include the
virtual world.

"We are looking at interactive games like Xbox 360
Connect because a lot of people play videogames and
don't play intramurals," Jew said. "You are still playing
a sport, just virtually."
Senior Associate Athletic Director Eric Stein agreed
with Jew about the program's improvement. According
to Stein, much of this progression can be attributed to
new staffing and leadership. Stein came to Stanford in
2006, and the first full-time director of intramurals

sports was appointed one year later.
Following the introduction of a full-time director, a
position currently held by Jew, the number of teams has
grown by 62.5 percent, games by 130 percent and partic
ipants by 4 percent.
"When I first came here, we had just won our
twelfth straight Director's Cup [from the National As
sociation of College Directors of Athletics]," Stein said,
adding that he felt that that year marked an institution
al transition in the attention paid to intramural sports
at Stanford.
Participants in the competitive and recreational intra
mural sports leagues vary in age, skill level and athletic
background.
"When I was in high school, I did track," Szwarc said.
"I came to college and wasn't able to maintain the same
time commitment to varsity sports. I had this need to get
out there and play sports where the level of competition
is still really high."
Like Szwarc, Rebecca Amato 'l4 has been involved in
sports since high school and became involved in intramu
rals during her freshman year.
"Before I came to Stanford, I researched intramural
sports, and for my dorm's government elections, they
mentioned that one position was intramurals coordina
tor," Amato said.
Now, both Szwarc and Amato are involved in several
sports throughout the year. For both, intramurals have
great benefits.
"It's a break from our busy lives as students," Amato
said. "It's nice to get on a team and have fun and then go
back to your routine."
Szwarc points out that the intramural teams fill the
space between solo exercise and varsity-level practice.
"It gives a reason to go out and compete," Szwarc
said. "You can train for an event or run for fun, but it's
something else to have a game, a bracket and a league.
It's having something at stake, being part of something
more,"

/\ vision I varsity teams, competitive club
/ 1 sports or our official mascot, the Cardinal.
/% However, the teams "Gazebo Gorillas" or
are also in the realm of Stan
ford athletics.These intramurals sports teams are two of
more than 1,000 other uniquely named teams.
As part of its mission statement, the Intramurals
Sports Program "recognizes the need of a recreation
al environment" for Stanford students, a goal
that Travis Jew, coordinator of intramural
sports, aims to fulfill.
Jew joined the Intramural Sports
Program 18 months ago and became
the head of the program in October.
"I had a passion for intramurals
because I used to play them all the
time as an undergrad in college," Jew
said.
The first part of Jew's vision was initiating a
new online system of registration and communica
tion.
"Our goal is to interact with students, and for the
teams to communicate more with each other," Jew
said.
Launched this winter quarter, the system includes
features such as most valuable player awards for each
game and an online message board. One of the bigger
improvements is cutting down on forfeits with the
ability to reschedule games, which is facilitated by the
online system.
The new online system is only one improvement in
the larger scope of the program. According to Jew, an
other principal need is to reach out to more students
by offering a wider variety of sports.
"There is a huge need to appeal to every student on
campus," Jew said. "Not everybody likes basketball.
Not everybody plays volleyball. Not everybody knows
how to throw a Frisbee. [But] we are trying to get every
student plugged into at least one sport."
In an effort to address this issue, the program now
offers new sports, while still maintaining the classics
such as basketball, volleyball and soccer.
"[We have] different sports for people who aren't
comfortable with the traditional sports and can now
play some fun, wacky sport," Jew said.
Broomball, added this quarter, is an example of such
a "fun, wacky sport." The sport is very similar to ice
hockey except that the participants run in tennis shoes
and play with "brooms," or square-shaped plastic sticks.
Timothy Szwarc M.S. 'O9 Ph.D. 'l5, who played
broomball as an undergraduate at Cornell University,
where hockey fans and ice rinks abound, now plays
through Stanford Intramurals.

"It's fun to see students who can write award-win
ning papers be able to score a goal in broomball and cel
ebrate winning a game," Szwarc said.
Despite being nontraditional, a recent intramural
broomball tournament had more than 90 participants.
Since 2006, there have been six new league sports
introduced into the program, including inner tube
water polo, billiards, squash, table tennis and bad
minton. This expansion is now looking to include the
virtual world.

"We are looking at interactive games like Xbox 360
Connect because a lot of people play videogames and
don't play intramurals," Jew said. "You are still playing
a sport, just virtually."
Senior Associate Athletic Director Eric Stein agreed
with Jew about the program's improvement. According
to Stein, much of this progression can be attributed to
new staffing and leadership. Stein came to Stanford in
2006, and the first full-time director of intramurals

sports was appointed one year later.
Following the introduction of a full-time director, a
position currently held by Jew, the number of teams has
grown by 62.5 percent, games by 130 percent and partic
ipants by 4 percent.
"When I first came here, we had just won our
twelfth straight Director's Cup [from the National As
sociation of College Directors of Athletics]," Stein said,
adding that he felt that that year marked an institution
al transition in the attention paid to intramural sports
at Stanford.
Participants in the competitive and recreational intra
mural sports leagues vary in age, skill level and athletic
background.
"When I was in high school, I did track," Szwarc said.
"I came to college and wasn't able to maintain the same
time commitment to varsity sports. I had this need to get
out there and play sports where the level of competition
is still really high."
Like Szwarc, Rebecca Amato 'l4 has been involved in
sports since high school and became involved in intramu
rals during her freshman year.
"Before I came to Stanford, I researched intramural
sports, and for my dorm's government elections, they
mentioned that one position was intramurals coordina
tor," Amato said.
Now, both Szwarc and Amato are involved in several
sports throughout the year. For both, intramurals have
great benefits.
"It's a break from our busy lives as students," Amato
said. "It's nice to get on a team and have fun and then go
back to your routine."
Szwarc points out that the intramural teams fill the
space between solo exercise and varsity-level practice.
"It gives a reason to go out and compete," Szwarc
said. "You can train for an event or run for fun, but it's
something else to have a game, a bracket and a league.
It's having something at stake, being part of something
more,"
