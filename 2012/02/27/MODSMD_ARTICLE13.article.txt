## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR 
### 
Dear Readers,

I would like to clarify and
comment on our recent and con
tinuing coverage of the arrest of
Fadi Quran 'lO in Hebron, West
Bank.This story was a significant
undertaking for The Daily and
an important piece of breaking
news for our community.
A few questions have sur
faced about news desk editor
Kristian Davis Bailey's ability to
fairly cover Quran's arrest.
Kristian signed a divestment
petition circulated by Students
for Palestinian Equal Rights
(SPER) this year. He is not a
member of this group. The peti
tion calls for Stanford to divest

from "companies whose direct
violations of international law
have an injurious impact on
Palestinians."
Kristian did not report his sig
nature to a Daily editor because
he viewed the issues of divestment
and Quran's arrest separately.
I stand by Kristian's coverage
as fair and accurate. The Daily
should have disclosed his signa
ture on the SPER petition. An an
notation disclosing Kristian's sig
nature on the SPER petition has
been appended to his articles on
line.

Sincerely,
MARGARET RAWSON
President and Editor in Chief, Vol. CCXLI
