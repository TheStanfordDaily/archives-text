## Time to establish substance-free housing 
### 
OAs the University deals
with numerous episodes
of dangerous drinking,
there is no doubt that we as a
community should adopt a
multi-pronged approach to
change student attitudes toward
alcohol. In addition to changing
attitudes, it is important to cre
ate meaningful social alterna
tives to alcohol-centered party
ing. The Office of Alcohol Policy
and Education's Cardinal
Nights program has done this to
some extent, sponsoring a wide
range of activities, some of
which have been quite popular.
However, Cardinal Nights may
not be enough of an alternative
for students who choose not to
drink. As a result, the Editorial
Board believes Stanford should
pilot substance-free housing.
Substance-free housing
refers to housing where alcohol
and drug consumption is not
permitted. This is not as much a
legal approach as a social one,
given that drugs are illegal and
that for many of Stanford's stu
dents, consuming alcohol is, as
well. Substance-free housing
would be an opt-in program for
those students who wish to min
imize their exposure to drink
ing and drunken behavior in
their residential environment.
This approach has caught on at
a number of schools, ranging in
size from small liberal arts col
leges like Vassar to Ivy League
schools like Dartmouth and
large state schools like Rutgers.
The program would appeal
to a wide cross-section of stu
dents, not all of whom would be
freshmen. Students who do not
drink for religious reasons
would benefit from having a
community that recognizes and
values this aspect of their be
liefs, and those who simply pre
fer not to drink would find a
group of like-minded individu
als. Indeed, when placed in
dorms where drinking is the
norm, many students who have
no particular interest in drink
ing join the drinking bandwag
on. In addition, those who had a
troubled high school experi
ence with alcohol or other ille
gal substances might find it eas
ier to live in substance-free
housing.
Lastly, we believe there
would be students who would
choose to live in substance-free
housing for the so-called "sec
ondary benefits," regardless of
whether these students drink in
other social environments.
These benefits include the qui
eter atmosphere, less drunken
damage or theft, less alcohol-in
duced vomit in the bathrooms

and more. These secondary ben
efits have been a major driver
for introducing substance-free
housing at other schools, as Dr.
Henry Weschler of the Harvard
School of Public Health pointed
out in a 2001 study on the sub
ject.
Substance-free housing is not
without its detractors. The first
concern is that students, partic
ularly freshmen, may not make
the best choices coming into
college parents may pres
sure students to choose a sub
stance-free dorm or students
may find that while they choose
not to drink, the friends they
would otherwise want to live
with do. These are valid con
cerns. One possible solution, at
least in the beginning, would be
to limit the substance-free
housing to upperclassmen only.
This would also alleviate the
concern that the presence of
substance-free housing would
create a divide between stu
dents who opt in and those who
choose not to. After freshman
year, stigmas associated with
certain residences generally be
come less relevant.
Another concern is what the
presence of substance-free
housing suggests about the
other on-campus housing op
tions: are they "substance
filled"? The answer, of course, is
that alcohol and drugs will al
ways be something that students
experiment with in college. Hav
ing substance-free housing on
campus offers a social alterna
tive rather than a statement on
what is or is not encouraged in
the remainder of on-campus
housing.
A pilot substance-free resi
dence, restricted to upperclass
men, would give Housing and
Resident Education a good idea
of the benefits and drawbacks
of the program, as well as an in
dication of how popular the
program might be. Piloting
housing programs is not un
precedented: although the rea
sons were quite different, gen
der-neutral housing was a pilot
just a few years ago and has
since expanded considerably
due to its popularity. Giving stu
dents who don't drink and
those who do the chance to
live in housing largely free from
the peer effects and secondary
effects of drinking is valuable.
Both in the interest of helping
all students feel safe and com
fortable, as well as in pursuing
multiple approaches to dealing
with problem drinking on cam
pus, the University should pilot
an alternative in the form of
substance-free housing.
