# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## Freedom 
### Nina Chung 
The rules under which I lived
during most of sophomore
year are called, in social and
clinical terms, an "eating disor
der." It's a jarring convergence of
terms. Even stranger is the fact
that the girl writing those rules was
me. Me —normal, a student at
Stanford not a psycho nutcase
with a sensational/irrelevant story.
That situation belonged to cliche
reality TV show stars, who were
crazy and self-obsessed. This is our
human penchant for being in de
nial: we see clearly the absurdities
of others and rarely in ourselves.
Because, yes, it was undoubtedly
me, less than two years ago, forcing
myself into a highly self-destruc
tive mental structure. Yet all that
time, I proudly thought I was in
control, and that was a big part of
the problem.
In most students' post-fresh
man year dorm life, social regular
ity becomes more self-directed.
We have more autonomy in who
we see every day and who knows
our daily business (which itself can
be a major adjustment at the be
ginning of sophomore year).
Fewer people are around to see
how we eat. Now, that's a side note,
of course, except that it creates the
space for someone trying to es
cape being observed as eating dif
ferently than before. And I began
eating very purposefully different.
I ate exactly every three hours,
which dictated when I woke up
each morning.
When my eating scheduled was
forced to change, I ignored a tradi
tional lunch or dinner. I could only
eat apples or pears between meals.
I ate only raw vegetables at din
ner, especially those with sup
posed "negative" calories. I could
not drink water at meals, for it di
luted digestive acids. I went to the
gym with a precisely-timed formu

la for offsetting food intake. At al
most all moments, my mind was
concerned with what I was eating,
and what I was not eating. These
were absolutes.
It sounds insane to me now, but
at that time, recalling every ingest
ed ingredient each day and await
ing the scale's report each week
made sense. I was aware of grow
ing more particular, but it was
sunny outside, my classes were
awesome, I still smiled and life still
felt sunny. I didn't register that my
entire day was mentally spent on
food or the sustained issues crop
ping up in my body. Indeed, I had
mastered the arts of health and
self-discipline. "Disorder" would
be the last word I'd use to describe
my orderly life. So only now do I
see how ironic that word is.
The specificity of an "eating
disorder" for many is sourced
from a much more general psy
chological condition: the desire to
have control. It's an innate human
trait. We want that sensation, and
we often use tangible materials to
attain it. Depending on our differ
ent personalities and contexts,
though, our objects of choice vary
widely. My own fixation settled on
food and appearance, but for oth
ers it's a grade, a relationship, rep
utation or tomorrow's schedule. I
think people have a tendency to
create security where we can, in
reaction to all of the places where
we cannot. We intend the best for
ourselves, really, but it's easy to
start sacrificing things we didn't
mean to.
In logic and rationale, we will
admit we can't take anything in
this material world for granted.
But in the most irrational depth of
our hearts the part that truly
drives how we live we're des
perate to prove ourselves wrong.
That dissonance is exactly where

we trap ourselves in crisis. We still
strive for self-dependence and
certainty when those things keep
breaking down despite us.
My relationship with God is my
reality check. To some, this is
called "using religion as the pre
ferred coping mechanism" (at
least, that's what I used to say).
But the more I learn about what
Christ said, and the more I see of
humanity in action, my faith in the
supposedly impossible simply
grows stronger. I've noticed how
human standards for right and
wrong and okay are just so, so
messy they keep foiling us. I
wreak havoc on myself and others
the more I try to take over, and it's
horrible. There's a more popular
religion, based on self-worship
and perfection, that doesn't make
sense to me anymore. We want the
last word, control of the day, think
ing that that is freedom. But is it,
really? I didn't find freedom there.
I believe freedom is somewhere
else a much different, less tan
gible place.
Many of us seek order in well
disguised disorders, some more ex
treme than others. A lot of us are
dealing with uncertainty in very in
ternalized, painful ways. So, I
thought I'd write this column in
light of all that. (I was kind of nerv
ous; this column has been cooking
mentally for weeks.) Hopefully, my
experience can mean something
more out here, maybe to you.

Who'da thunk it? Nina talks in
other, non-column ways, too. If you
don't see her around in person,
email her at ninamc@stanford.edu.
Until we meet again next Monday,
Stanford.

more out here, maybe to you.

Who'da thunk it? Nina talks in
other, non-column ways, too. If you
don't see her around in person,

Until we meet again next Monday,

The rules under which I lived
during most of sophomore
year are called, in social and
clinical terms, an "eating disor
der." It's a jarring convergence of
terms. Even stranger is the fact
that the girl writing those rules was
me. Me —normal, a student at
Stanford not a psycho nutcase
with a sensational/irrelevant story.
That situation belonged to cliche
reality TV show stars, who were
crazy and self-obsessed. This is our
human penchant for being in de
nial: we see clearly the absurdities
of others and rarely in ourselves.
Because, yes, it was undoubtedly
me, less than two years ago, forcing
myself into a highly self-destruc
tive mental structure. Yet all that
time, I proudly thought I was in
control, and that was a big part of
the problem.
In most students' post-fresh
man year dorm life, social regular
ity becomes more self-directed.
We have more autonomy in who
we see every day and who knows
our daily business (which itself can
be a major adjustment at the be
ginning of sophomore year).
Fewer people are around to see
how we eat. Now, that's a side note,
of course, except that it creates the
space for someone trying to es
cape being observed as eating dif
ferently than before. And I began
eating very purposefully different.
I ate exactly every three hours,
which dictated when I woke up
each morning.
When my eating scheduled was
forced to change, I ignored a tradi
tional lunch or dinner. I could only
eat apples or pears between meals.
I ate only raw vegetables at din
ner, especially those with sup
posed "negative" calories. I could
not drink water at meals, for it di
luted digestive acids. I went to the
gym with a precisely-timed formu

la for offsetting food intake. At al
most all moments, my mind was
concerned with what I was eating,
and what I was not eating. These
were absolutes.
It sounds insane to me now, but
at that time, recalling every ingest
ed ingredient each day and await
ing the scale's report each week
made sense. I was aware of grow
ing more particular, but it was
sunny outside, my classes were
awesome, I still smiled and life still
felt sunny. I didn't register that my
entire day was mentally spent on
food or the sustained issues crop
ping up in my body. Indeed, I had
mastered the arts of health and
self-discipline. "Disorder" would
be the last word I'd use to describe
my orderly life. So only now do I
see how ironic that word is.
The specificity of an "eating
disorder" for many is sourced
from a much more general psy
chological condition: the desire to
have control. It's an innate human
trait. We want that sensation, and
we often use tangible materials to
attain it. Depending on our differ
ent personalities and contexts,
though, our objects of choice vary
widely. My own fixation settled on
food and appearance, but for oth
ers it's a grade, a relationship, rep
utation or tomorrow's schedule. I
think people have a tendency to
create security where we can, in
reaction to all of the places where
we cannot. We intend the best for
ourselves, really, but it's easy to
start sacrificing things we didn't
mean to.
In logic and rationale, we will
admit we can't take anything in
this material world for granted.
But in the most irrational depth of
our hearts the part that truly
drives how we live we're des
perate to prove ourselves wrong.
That dissonance is exactly where

we trap ourselves in crisis. We still
strive for self-dependence and
certainty when those things keep
breaking down despite us.
My relationship with God is my
reality check. To some, this is
called "using religion as the pre
ferred coping mechanism" (at
least, that's what I used to say).
But the more I learn about what
Christ said, and the more I see of
humanity in action, my faith in the
supposedly impossible simply
grows stronger. I've noticed how
human standards for right and
wrong and okay are just so, so
messy they keep foiling us. I
wreak havoc on myself and others
the more I try to take over, and it's
horrible. There's a more popular
religion, based on self-worship
and perfection, that doesn't make
sense to me anymore. We want the
last word, control of the day, think
ing that that is freedom. But is it,
really? I didn't find freedom there.
I believe freedom is somewhere
else a much different, less tan
gible place.
Many of us seek order in well
disguised disorders, some more ex
treme than others. A lot of us are
dealing with uncertainty in very in
ternalized, painful ways. So, I
thought I'd write this column in
light of all that. (I was kind of nerv
ous; this column has been cooking
mentally for weeks.) Hopefully, my
experience can mean something
more out here, maybe to you.
