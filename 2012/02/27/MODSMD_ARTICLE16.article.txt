## Our connection to events in Palestine 
### LINDA HESS '64 Senior Lecturer in the Department of Religious Studies 
Fadi Quran, a person of
tremendous courage and
wisdom, a 2010 Stanford
graduate, my friend and the
friend of many others at our Uni
versity, a Palestinian dedicated to
the struggle for justice and
human dignity, a man absolutely
committed in theory and practice
to nonviolence, appeared Friday
in an Internet video, his face dis
colored and bruised, being beat
en, handcuffed and dragged by
soldiers in the course of a demon
stration in Hebron. As his friends
and members of his community,
many of us are working to help
him, to free him, to protect him.
Helping Fadi in this moment
of pain and danger is an impera
tive that comes from our hearts.
But many of us are also allied
with him in his larger purpose
to end the terrible conflict be
tween Israel and Palestine, to lift
the cruel military occupation, the
long ordeal of homelessness, the
wall, the settlements, the check
points, the house demolitions, the
destruction of agriculture, the
separation of families, the chok
ing off of the very means of sur
vival, the treatment of a whole
nation of nationless people as
less than human.
As a brilliant graduate of
Stanford in physics and interna
tional relations, Fadi could have
done just about anything he
wanted to. But personal success
and power were not on his list.

He was 20 when I met him in
2008; by that time he had already
put himself on the line many
times, and had suffered for it. His
resolve to follow a path of nonvi
olence was clearer than ever
after he participated in a Stan
ford overseas seminar in India,
led by Prof. Clayborne Carson
and me. We called the seminar
"Gandhi and his legacy: Nonvio
lence in India, America, and the
World." In his last year at Stan
ford, Fadi worked for divest
ment. That campaign, like the
one before it at Stanford and the
one after it (unfolding at this mo
ment) aroused extreme feelings
and strong opposition as well as
alliance and support. With his
deep convictions about the ne
cessity of dialogue, reconciliation
and love, Fadi reached out to
Jewish individuals and organiza
tions and earned great respect
even from those who disagreed
with him. After graduation he re
turned to his home in Ramallah.
He was featured in a March 31,
2011, article in Time magazine: "A
New Palestinian Movement:
Young, Networked, Nonviolent."
He is also featured in a film in
progress called "Martin Luther
King, Jr. in Palestine."
Last November, when Ameri
cans were honoring the 50th an
niversary of the Civil Rights Free
dom Riders with TV specials and
public events, Fadi and his com
panions in Palestine were giving

new birth to the concept of Free
dom Riders. While Palestinians
must follow a tortuous route
through checkpoints to get to
East Jerusalem, if they can get
there at all, residents of illegal
Jewish settlements in the West
Bank ride segregated buses over
segregated roads on which Pales
tinians are not permitted. The
Freedom Riders boarded one of
these forbidden buses and rode
till they were dragged off and ar
rested. This story was widely cov
ered in the world press, with a pic
ture showing Fadi in the bus with
his sister, holding up a sign that
says, "WE SHALL OVER
COME."
As I write this, Fadi is in a mil
itary prison. His friends are mo
bilizing to get support from Stan
ford and elsewhere to secure his
release and to keep him safe.
A powerful nonviolent move
ment is building in Palestine.
Many understand that this is like
ly to be the most potent move
ment of all. Effective nonviolent
leaders can be a particular threat
to entrenched powers. It's up to
us to stand with brave and vision
ary nonviolent leaders and move
ments not to be silent by
standers. We are connected to Is
rael and Palestine in more ways
than we know.

his sister, holding up a sign that
says, "WE SHALL OVER
COME."
As I write this, Fadi is in a mil
itary prison. His friends are mo
bilizing to get support from Stan

A powerful nonviolent move

ments not to be silent by
standers. We are connected to Is
rael and Palestine in more ways
than we know.
