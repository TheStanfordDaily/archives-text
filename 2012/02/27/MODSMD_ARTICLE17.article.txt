# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## The 						problem of balance 
### Miles Unterreiner 
This is the second in a series of
columns by the author dealing with
divestment and the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
In my last column, I predicted
that the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict would again become
one of the hot-button campus po
litical issues of the year. I just did
n't think it would happen quite so
soon.
Last Friday, Palestinian activist
and Stanford alumnus Fadi Quran
was arrested in Hebron, West
Bank, on charges of pushing an Is
raeli soldier. Video of Quran's ar
rest quickly circulated on Face
book, Stanford students drafted a
petition to the Israeli government
protesting Quran's detention and
Robert Wright of The Atlantic
publicized Quran's arrest under
the headline "The Arab Spring
Comes to Israel." The ASSU Sen
ate quickly sprang into action,
drafting a bill designed to enlist
support for Quran. And as always,
each and every news article trig
gered an avalanche of emotional
comments from partisans on both
sides of the issue.
The question is now a simple
one: how will we react?
Over the past week, I have had
the great blessing of speaking
with committed activists on both
sides of the conflict. And for rea
sons I'll share in my next column,
I'm incredibly hopeful about the
future of Israeli-Palestinian rela
tions on campus.
But before we get there, there
are a host of problems that need
to be addressed. Foremost among
them is the problem of balance
and proportionality.
Whenever divestment from Is
rael is brought up or Israeli policy
criticized, one of the first objec
tions always made is that other,
far worse human rights violators
many of them Israel's enemies
aren't being criticized also.
Why, the argument goes, have
Stanford students advocated di
vestment from Israel a rela

tively liberal democracy with an
independent judiciary, regularly
held elections and one of the most
LGBT-friendly cities between
Cairo and Calcutta for six
years running, while homosexual
executing Saudi Arabia, dissi
dent-bombing Syria and election
rigging Iran go about happily un
divested?
Divestment advocates usually
respond by arguing that they are
under no obligation to cover
every human rights violation on
the face of the globe; that the
United States gives a dispropor
tionate amount of foreign aid to
Israel, warranting a dispropor
tionate amount of attention; and
that advocating divestment from
one nation does not preclude
them from supporting divestment
elsewhere.
Both arguments have merit.
Certainly Israel does not get a
free pass on human rights viola
tions merely because it is a Jewish
democracy, and certainly our
close allies should be held to high
er standards than those of the
world's worst rights violators. But
it is also dangerous to ignore the
very real existence of anti-Semi
tism, both historical and extant.
Divestment, as both proponents
and detractors for once agree, is
largely a symbolic venture, impor
tant less for its concrete financial
impact than for the powerful mes
sage it sends. We should think long
and hard about what kind of sym
bolic message divesting only from
Israeli companies would send, es
pecially given the nasty history of
programs targeted specifically at
Jews.
It's a thorny tangle, and this
week's events will only make
things thornier. Here's one sug
gestion to get started.
If divestment must go forward
and the fire rightfully ignited
by Mr. Quran's arrest this week
suggests that it will it must be
fair and equitable. Why not start a
campus-wide student divestment
board, composed of representa-

tives from groups concerned with
rights violations everywhere? Ti
betan rights. South Sudanese
rights, Iranian rights, Dubai guest
workers' rights and of course
Palestinian rights you name it.
The board would meet on a regu
lar basis say, once a month
and work together to formulate a
united list of ethical investment
requirements, which would even
tually and collectively be present
ed to the University. Each individ
ual rights group could otherwise
continue its regular programming
without change, so Tibetan rights
advocates wouldn't have to worry
about the Congo, and Palestinian
rights activists wouldn't be forced
to constantly campaign for
Chechens. The only thing we
would do collectively is divest.
It's not fair to single out Israel
for criticism, especially when far
worse human rights violators
abound. But it's also not right to
shield Israel, or any country, from
criticism altogether. A more bal
anced and comprehensive model
for divestment advocacy would
help alleviate both concerns
and also raise overall student
awareness of rights violations
worldwide that too often go ig
nored.
But that's not quite good
enough either. Divestment is only
one piece of the puzzle, if that.
There are other constructive ven
tures and projects out there with
incredible potential for good
ventures and projects on which
pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian
groups here at Stanford can work
together. I'll talk more about
those, and why we need them,
next week.

support for Quran. And as always,
each and every news article trig
gered an avalanche of emotional
comments from partisans on both
sides of the issue.
The question is now a simple
one: how will we react?
Over the past week, I have had
the great blessing of speaking
with committed activists on both
sides of the conflict. And for rea
sons I'll share in my next column,
I'm incredibly hopeful about the
future of Israeli-Palestinian rela
tions on campus.
But before we get there, there
are a host of problems that need
to be addressed. Foremost among
them is the problem of balance
and proportionality.
Whenever divestment from Is
rael is brought up or Israeli policy
criticized, one of the first objec
tions always made is that other,
far worse human rights violators
many of them Israel's enemies
aren't being criticized also.
Why, the argument goes, have
Stanford students advocated di
vestment from Israel a rela

tively liberal democracy with an
independent judiciary, regularly
held elections and one of the most
LGBT-friendly cities between
Cairo and Calcutta for six
years running, while homosexual
executing Saudi Arabia, dissi
dent-bombing Syria and election
rigging Iran go about happily un
divested?
Divestment advocates usually
respond by arguing that they are
under no obligation to cover
every human rights violation on
the face of the globe; that the
United States gives a dispropor
tionate amount of foreign aid to
Israel, warranting a dispropor
tionate amount of attention; and
that advocating divestment from
one nation does not preclude
them from supporting divestment
elsewhere.
Both arguments have merit.
Certainly Israel does not get a
free pass on human rights viola
tions merely because it is a Jewish
democracy, and certainly our
close allies should be held to high
er standards than those of the
world's worst rights violators. But
it is also dangerous to ignore the
very real existence of anti-Semi
tism, both historical and extant.
Divestment, as both proponents
and detractors for once agree, is
largely a symbolic venture, impor
tant less for its concrete financial
impact than for the powerful mes
sage it sends. We should think long
and hard about what kind of sym
bolic message divesting only from
Israeli companies would send, es
pecially given the nasty history of
programs targeted specifically at
Jews.
It's a thorny tangle, and this
week's events will only make
things thornier. Here's one sug
gestion to get started.
If divestment must go forward
and the fire rightfully ignited
by Mr. Quran's arrest this week
suggests that it will it must be
fair and equitable. Why not start a
campus-wide student divestment
board, composed of representa-

tives from groups concerned with
rights violations everywhere? Ti
betan rights. South Sudanese
rights, Iranian rights, Dubai guest
workers' rights and of course
Palestinian rights you name it.
The board would meet on a regu
lar basis say, once a month
and work together to formulate a
united list of ethical investment
requirements, which would even
tually and collectively be present
ed to the University. Each individ
ual rights group could otherwise
continue its regular programming
without change, so Tibetan rights
advocates wouldn't have to worry
about the Congo, and Palestinian
rights activists wouldn't be forced
to constantly campaign for
Chechens. The only thing we
would do collectively is divest.
It's not fair to single out Israel
for criticism, especially when far
worse human rights violators
abound. But it's also not right to
shield Israel, or any country, from
criticism altogether. A more bal
anced and comprehensive model
for divestment advocacy would
help alleviate both concerns
and also raise overall student
awareness of rights violations
worldwide that too often go ig
nored.
But that's not quite good
enough either. Divestment is only
one piece of the puzzle, if that.
There are other constructive ven
tures and projects out there with
incredible potential for good
ventures and projects on which
pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian
groups here at Stanford can work
together. I'll talk more about
those, and why we need them,
next week.

This is the second in a series of
columns by the author dealing with
divestment and the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
In my last column, I predicted
that the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict would again become
one of the hot-button campus po
litical issues of the year. I just did
n't think it would happen quite so
soon.
Last Friday, Palestinian activist
and Stanford alumnus Fadi Quran
was arrested in Hebron, West
Bank, on charges of pushing an Is
raeli soldier. Video of Quran's ar
rest quickly circulated on Face
book, Stanford students drafted a
petition to the Israeli government
protesting Quran's detention and
Robert Wright of The Atlantic
publicized Quran's arrest under
the headline "The Arab Spring
Comes to Israel." The ASSU Sen
ate quickly sprang into action,
drafting a bill designed to enlist
support for Quran. And as always,
each and every news article trig
gered an avalanche of emotional
comments from partisans on both
sides of the issue.
