## TEXAS TROUNCED 13-RUN INNING CAPS ANOTHER CARD SWEEP 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
A week and a half ago, with the home open
er looming and a set of top teams ready to face
the Cardinal at Sunken Diamond, Stanford
baseball head coach Mark Marquess had a
pretty clear mantra when it came to his team's
tough schedule.
"I'd love to be wrong, but we're not going to

be undefeated after four weeks with the teams
that we're playing," he said.
With the harder half of the Cardinal's 15-
game nonconference stretch in the books, a
weekend sweep of No. 7 Texas has made it
seem like No. 2 Stanford (7-0) could very well
enter the Pac-f2 season with an unblemished
record.
All-around dominance was again the
theme for the Cardinal as it hosted another

top-10 squad on the Farm this weekend, as
Stanford blew out the Longhorns (2-5) by a
combined score of 28-5 over the three-game
set. Junior starters Mark Appel and Brett
Mooneyham maintained their usual domi
nance, and freshman lefthander John
Hochstatter earned the win in his first career
start on Sunday thanks to a 13-run fourth in
ning from the Cardinal offense. All three pitch
ers moved to 2-0 on the season.
The Cardinal's 3-4-5 hitters were pre
dictably excellent run-producers, with sopho
more first baseman Brian Ragira posting three
RBI on Friday, junior second baseman Kenny
Diekroeger driving in a pair on Saturday and
junior third baseman Stephen Piscotty bring
ing home four on Sunday.
Appel stole the show in the series opener,
taking a no-hitter into the fifth inning for the
second straight start. The projected number
one MLB Draft pick struck out a career-high
10 batters in his seven-plus innings of work,
eventually yielding to sophomore A.J. Vanegas
and freshman David Schmidt, who earned his
first career save to cap a strong week to open
his Cardinal career.
Junior centerfielder Jake Stewart hit his
first home run of the season to lead off the bot
tom of the first, making him the fourth Stan
ford slugger with a long ball through five
games. Junior leftfielder Tyler Gaffney fol
lowed with a double, and Ragira brought him
home with the first of two RBI doubles for the
reigning Pac-10 Freshman of the Year. Stewart
sparked a two-out, second-inning rally with a
double down the left-field line before a Piscot
ty single and a Ragira double made it 5-0 in
Stanford's favor.
Junior catcher Eric Smith tacked on anoth
er run with a fifth-inning sac fly, and a Gaffney
RBI single in the bottom of the eighth capped
the scoring at 7-2 after Texas got two runs off
sophomore reliever A.J. Vanegas.
Stanford started a bit more slowly on Satur
day, jumping out to a modest 2-0 lead in the
second inning behind doubles from
Diekroeger and sophomore shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila. But Mooneyham was unflappable
on the mound, striking out seven batters to
keep pace with Appel for the team lead in
punch-outs with 15. Saturday was one of the
best outings of Mooneyham's career, besides a
somewhat sloppy sixth inning in which the left
hander hit third baseman Erich Weiss who
became the Longhorns' first and only run off
the Cardinal starter on a single later in the in
ning. But Stanford had already added three
runs to its lead by that point, as sophomore

Junior second baseman Kenny Diekroeger had two three-hit, two-RBI performances on the
weekend, including a 3-for-3 Saturday performance that paced Stanford in a 6-2 win.
