## QB contest surrounds spring practice 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
For the first time in over three years, the
Stanford football team will take the field
without Andrew Luck on the roster but
when the Cardinal's spring practice opens on
Monday afternoon, the QB position won't be
the only thing on head coach David Shaw's
agenda.
With 11 starters departing from the Cardi
nal's back-to-back BCS bowl teams, Shaw said

he's just hoping to get a few hints this spring of
what team will take the field come August.
"I think every spring has got to be about
the same thing: you've got to find out what
kind of a team that you're becoming," Shaw
said on Thursday. "You don't find out what
kind of team you are in spring; you get clues as
to where you're leaning."
The first and most important order of busi
ness will certainly be figuring out just who will
replace the two-time Heisman runner-up.
Shaw said that the Cardinal would have an

open competition to choose Luck's heir, and
that Stanford's next starting quarterback
would come from a group of five players: jun
iors Josh Nunes and Robbie Picazo, sopho
more Brett Nottingham and freshmen Evan
Crower and Kevin Hogan.
When asked if he had a favorite to win the
job, Shaw said that he did indeed have a leader
in the clubhouse.
"Absolutely, and it changes every 15 min-
utes," he quipped. "Every time we
go on the field, somebody does
something better than somebody
else."
While Nottingham was the
primary backup to Luck last sea
son, Shaw said his goal was to get
all five quarterbacks equal prac
tice reps during this first spring
session, which extends until
March 10.
"We're going to try [to give
equal reps] this first session; we
want this to be competitive, we
want to get every guy a shot, but
it's hard to do it like this forever,"
Shaw said. "We'll do a lot of split
periods when there are two team
periods going on at the same time.
That's away to get more guys reps
at the same time, so we're able to
get more guys competitive reps on
both sides of the line."
Shaw also mentioned that he
had set out clear criteria to the five
quarterbacks for ways to distin
guish themselves.
"They don't need to worry
about if they're going with the
ones or the twos, they need to
worry about their performance,"
he said. "They need to worry
about executing the offense, com
pleting passes, reading the de
fense, making sure they've got the
right run checks, managing the
pocket those are things that
they're responsible for."
While plenty of eyes will be fo
cused on the five-way duel under
center, there will also be a couple
of players conspicuously absent
including junior linebacker
Shayne Skov, who will miss all of
spring practice due to a knee in
jury in the fall.
"He was never going to partic
ipate in spring physically," Shaw
said, taking care to point out that
Skov's absence from spring prac
tice was not be related to his DUI
arrest on Jan. 29.
"He's not an average football
player and he never has been. So
his rehab and his attention to de
tail in his rehab can't be average.
The conversation we had was that
he's getting ready to dominate,
he's not getting ready to play.
That's just the mentality that
he's got to attack this rehab. We're
going to be smart, we need him to
be healthy and ready to go to play
at the level that we need him to
play at."
Freshman linebacker Patrick
Skov, the younger brother of

Shayne, will also miss the first part
of spring with a foot injury. Fresh
man defensive end Kevin Ander
son and sophomore guard Dillon
Bonnel will also miss the Cardi
nal's first spring session.
While making up for losses will
be the major storyline on the
Farm this spring, the Cardinal will
also have to adapt to two coaching
additions: new special teams
coach Pete Alamar and an inside
linebackers coach, whom Shaw
said he would hire in the upcom
ing weeks. Alamar, who spent the
last two years coaching Fresno
State's special teams, was official
ly introduced as the successor to
Brian Polian on Friday.
But while the Cardinal is in
deed a team in transition, Shaw
also took care to mention that he
and the rest of the coaching staff
felt prepared to take on the task
ahead of them.
"We're more prepared [this
year], partially because we were
settling a lot of things schemati
cally [last year]," Shaw said. "Now
having both coordinators an en
tire season and having the same
ones getting ready for spring,
there's less [tweaking]. The over
all scheme of what we're doing is
set, so we're just more cohesive
going into this spring than we
were last spring."
