### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
Fadi Quran 'lO a Palestinian-
American Stanford alumnus who
was arrested by Israeli soldiers in the
West Bank onFriday, was brought to
trial Monday morning in Jerusalem,
his sister, Semma Qura'an, told The
Daily.
Quran's sister tweeted follow
ing the trial that Quran was not re
leased and was moved to Ofer
prison in the West Bank. He will
face a second hearing Tuesday
morning, she said.
As reported by PolicyMic re
porter Jake Horowitz 'O9, Quran
was initially held in A1 Maskubiyeh
Prison in Jerusalem, not Ofer, as pre
viously reported by several sources,
including The Daily. Hurriyah
Ziada, a student at Birzeit Unviersi
ty in Palestine, who was with Quran
moments before his arrest, con
firmed this information.
Quran's release and trial were not

guaranteed, according to his sister.
"We do not know if he will be re
leased today. We only hope for it,"
Semma Qura'an wrote in a Face
book message to The Daily from the
West Bank, before Monday's trial.
"No one is allowed contact with him
other than his lawyer even he has
limited access."
Quran, a Palestinian American
from Hebron, West Bank, graduated
from Stanford with a double major
in international relations and
physics and returned home to work
in the alternative energy field while
advocating nonviolent resistance to
the Israeli occupation of the West
Bank. Quran served as president of
Stanford Students for Palestinian
Equal Rights (SPER) during the
2007-2008 and 2008-2009 academic
years.
He was arrested Friday in He
bron, West Bank, for allegedly
pushing an Israeli soldier during a
protest against the 18-year Israeli
enforced closure of Hebron's main

street to Palestinian citizens.
Stanford students and graduates
quickly organized around support
ing Quran.
Imran Akbar 'O7, a SPER co
founder, wrote to the group late Sat
urday morning that he alerted the
American consulate of Quran's de
tainment.
"I've spoken to the American
consulate in Jerusalem," Akbar
wrote. "I gave them Fadi's informa
tion, told them what happened and
asked for a consular officer to visit
him in prison and ensure that he's
safe and has access to his lawyer. The
duty officer said he'd pass the infor
mation along to the consular tomor
row and get back to me."
Akbar said in an email to The
Daily that the consulate would not
give him more information about
the case because he is not a family
member. The American consulate
was closed and unavailable for com
ment at the time of publication.
Assaf Sharon Ph.D. 'O9, an organ

izer of the Sheikh Jarrah Solidarity
Movement a "grassroots organi
zation working towards civil equali
ty within Israel and an end to the Is
raeli occupation of Palestine," ac
cording to the group's site en
couraged the group in an email to
mobilize the Stanford community to
spread the story of Fadi's arrest and
of the larger conflict in Palestine.
The Israeli Defense Force and Is
rael Ministry of Foreign Affairs did
not answer requests for comment.
Video footage
Journalists and activists partici
pating in Friday's demonstrations
uploaded photos, videos and tweets
of Quran's arrest to Facebook,
You Tube and Twitter.
There are currently two videos
online one posted on Friday that
shows the protesters' interactions
with Israeli forces before and after
Quran's arrest and a second, re
leased on Sunday, that concentrates
solely on Quran's encounter from a

new camera angle.
The first video demonstrates a
visibly and audibly upset Quran ges
ticulating and speaking to Israeli sol
diers before being grabbed by multi
ple soldiers and pushed toward a po
lice van. The clip then shows an offi
cer pepper spraying Quran's face,
followed by Quran's head and ab
domen hitting the rear bumper of
the van as soldiers attempt to arrest
him.
Quran is then briefly shown lying
in the street behind the van as jour
nalists and soldiers stand around
him. The videographer of the origi
nal video then retreats from the
scene with his camera, as his footage
shows soldiers shooing the press
away.
The last footage of Quran shows
him still lying in the street.
The second video was shot from
behind Quran, showing him yelling
and motioning at officers, being
