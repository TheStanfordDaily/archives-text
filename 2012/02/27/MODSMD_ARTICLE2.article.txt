## 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
Fadi Quran 'lO a Palestinian-
American Stanford alumnus who
was arrested by Israeli soldiers in the
West Bank onFriday, was brought to
trial Monday morning in Jerusalem,
his sister, Semma Qura'an, told The
Daily.
Quran's sister tweeted follow
ing the trial that Quran was not re
leased and was moved to Ofer
prison in the West Bank. He will
face a second hearing Tuesday
morning, she said.
As reported by PolicyMic re
porter Jake Horowitz 'O9, Quran
was initially held in A1 Maskubiyeh
Prison in Jerusalem, not Ofer, as pre
viously reported by several sources,
including The Daily. Hurriyah
Ziada, a student at Birzeit Unviersi
ty in Palestine, who was with Quran
moments before his arrest, con
firmed this information.
Quran's release and trial were not

guaranteed, according to his sister.
"We do not know if he will be re
leased today. We only hope for it,"
Semma Qura'an wrote in a Face
book message to The Daily from the
West Bank, before Monday's trial.
"No one is allowed contact with him
other than his lawyer even he has
limited access."
Quran, a Palestinian American
from Hebron, West Bank, graduated
from Stanford with a double major
in international relations and
physics and returned home to work
in the alternative energy field while
advocating nonviolent resistance to
the Israeli occupation of the West
Bank. Quran served as president of
Stanford Students for Palestinian
Equal Rights (SPER) during the
2007-2008 and 2008-2009 academic
years.
He was arrested Friday in He
bron, West Bank, for allegedly
pushing an Israeli soldier during a
protest against the 18-year Israeli
enforced closure of Hebron's main

street to Palestinian citizens.
Stanford students and graduates
quickly organized around support
ing Quran.
Imran Akbar 'O7, a SPER co
founder, wrote to the group late Sat
urday morning that he alerted the
American consulate of Quran's de
tainment.
"I've spoken to the American
consulate in Jerusalem," Akbar
wrote. "I gave them Fadi's informa
tion, told them what happened and
asked for a consular officer to visit
him in prison and ensure that he's
safe and has access to his lawyer. The
duty officer said he'd pass the infor
mation along to the consular tomor
row and get back to me."
Akbar said in an email to The
Daily that the consulate would not
give him more information about
the case because he is not a family
member. The American consulate
was closed and unavailable for com
ment at the time of publication.
Assaf Sharon Ph.D. 'O9, an organ

izer of the Sheikh Jarrah Solidarity
Movement a "grassroots organi
zation working towards civil equali
ty within Israel and an end to the Is
raeli occupation of Palestine," ac
cording to the group's site en
couraged the group in an email to
mobilize the Stanford community to
spread the story of Fadi's arrest and
of the larger conflict in Palestine.
The Israeli Defense Force and Is
rael Ministry of Foreign Affairs did
not answer requests for comment.
Video footage
Journalists and activists partici
pating in Friday's demonstrations
uploaded photos, videos and tweets
of Quran's arrest to Facebook,
You Tube and Twitter.
There are currently two videos
online one posted on Friday that
shows the protesters' interactions
with Israeli forces before and after
Quran's arrest and a second, re
leased on Sunday, that concentrates
solely on Quran's encounter from a

new camera angle.
The first video demonstrates a
visibly and audibly upset Quran ges
ticulating and speaking to Israeli sol
diers before being grabbed by multi
ple soldiers and pushed toward a po
lice van. The clip then shows an offi
cer pepper spraying Quran's face,
followed by Quran's head and ab
domen hitting the rear bumper of
the van as soldiers attempt to arrest
him.
Quran is then briefly shown lying
in the street behind the van as jour
nalists and soldiers stand around
him. The videographer of the origi
nal video then retreats from the
scene with his camera, as his footage
shows soldiers shooing the press
away.
The last footage of Quran shows
him still lying in the street.
The second video was shot from
behind Quran, showing him yelling
and motioning at officers, being
grabbed and pepper sprayed. Mem
bers of the press block footage of
Quran's body hitting the vehicle,
and the video culminates with
Quran lying in the street, surround
ed by soldiers and journalists.
Stanford support
In addition to posting and shar
ing links to the photos, tweets and
videos, members of the Stanford
community initiated a petition to the
Israeli government demanding
Quran's release.
Stanford graduate Lila Kalaf 'lO
created the petition Saturday after
noon.
"Fadi should not be detained for
an indefinite period of time on false
charges," the petition reads. "It is im
perative that the Israeli government
release Fadi so that he may continue
to speak for his people and PEACE
FULIY push for basic human rights."
Members of SPER, the Muslim
Student Awareness Network
(MSAN) and other community
members forwarded the petition to
campus mailing lists and to specific
members of the faculty and adminis
tration.
"We emailed [professors] who had
previously signed SPER's petition,
as well as those in the physics depart
ment," wrote Mohammed All 'lO
M.A. 'lO J.D. 'l4 in an email to The
Daily. "I also emailed Provost
Etchemendy and Professor [Allen]
Weiner, whose class Fadi took as an
undergrad. Others emailed other
professors that he may have
known."
Ali was an ASSU Undergraduate
Senator during the 2009 to 2010
school year and also served as presi
dent of MSAN. He worked with
Quran on Campaign Restore Hope,
Among the signatories on
Kalaf's petition are Clayborne
Carson, director of the Martin
Luther King, Jr., Research and Ed
ucation Institute; Weiner, co-direc
tor of the Stanford Center on In
ternational Conflict and Negotia
tion; Joel Beinin, professor of his
tory; Khalil Barhoum, lecturer in
Arabic; Eva Silverstein, professor
of physics; Rega Wood, professor
emerita of philosophy; Shamit
Kachru, professor of physics; and
Franco Moretti, professor of com
parative literature,
Carson wrote in an email to The
Daily that Quran was one of his
students during a 2008 Overseas
Seminar trip to India, co-taught
with Linda Hess, senior lecturer in
religious studies.
"I had many opportunities to
talk with him about Gandhian con
cepts of nonviolent resistance and
about how Martin Luther King, Jr.,
and other African-American ac
tivists adapted these ideas for use
in the southern civil rights cam
paigns of the 19605," Carson wrote.
"I was impressed by his serious
ness and his interest in talking with
contemporary social justice ac
tivists in India who were seeking to
address the explosive issue of
Hindi-Muslim relations in India."
Carson wrote that he then trav
eled to Quran's hometown in Ra
mallah, West Bank, in March 2010,
met Quran's family and witnessed
Quran participate in a hunger
strike and demonstration.
Moretti, who said in an email to
The Daily that he had never inter
acted with Quran personally,
wrote, "I have never met Fadi; but I
have watched a video, and I believe
what I see with my own eyes."
At the time of publication, the
petition had over 1,400 signatories
Akbar and Ulugbek Baymu
radov 'lO, currently a graduate stu
dent in civil and environmental engi
neering, created freefadi.org on Sun
day, which features the names of
Stanford faculty who signed the peti
tion, an embedded copy of the video
documenting Quran's arrest, links to
past media coverage about Quran,
current articles on his arrest and a link
to the petition.

Current ASSU Undergraduate
Senators are working on legislation
to mobilize community support for
Quran.
Senators SamarAlqatari 'l4,Alon
Elhanan'l4 and Janani Ramachan
dran 'l4 and ASSU Executive Presi
dent Michael Cruz 'l2 met Sunday
evening in Old Union to draft a bill in
support of Quran. [See "ASSU sena
tors may urge Etchemendy to sup
port Fadi Quran," page 2.]
Quran in the Middle East
Quran was arrested Friday dur
ing a protest against the Israeli-en
forced closure of Shuhada Street,
the main thoroughfare in Hebron
that has been closed to Palestinians
since the 1994 Ibrahimi Mosque
Massacre, in which an Israeli gun
man killed 29 Palestinian Muslims
and injured 125.
According to the website of the
International Solidarity Movement
(ISM) a Palestinian-led move
ment committed to "resisting the Is
raeli apartheid in Palestine by using
nonviolent, direct-action methods
and principles" Quran was
protesting along with the "Youth
Against Settlements" movement,
though he is not a member. Six
demonstrators were arrested Friday,
including Quran, according to ISM.
Youth Against Settlements is a
Hebron-based movement that is "a
national Palestinian non-partisan
activist group which seeks to end Is
raeli colonization activities in Pales
tine (building and expanding settle
ments) through non-violent popu
lar struggle and civil disobedience,"
according to its website.
Upon graduating from Stanford,
Quran became part of a loosely as
sociated group of activists. He iden
tified the group as a collection of
"bubbles" waiting to congeal in a
March 2010 Time Magazine feature
on him.
Time Magazine called Quran
"the face of the new Middle East,"
describing his allegiance to broader
movements organized around so
cial-networking sites, rather than to
the two largest Palestinian factions,
Hamas and Fatah.
Quran has been interviewed b
Al-Jazeera, The Guardian and The
New York Times for his work.
Quran at Stanford
Quran was an active participant
in campus dialogue and action sur
rounding the Israel-Palestine con
flict during his undergraduate ca
reer.
He was an organizer for Cam
paign Restore Hope (CRH),acoali
tion of students who worked to raise
awareness about perceived human
rights violations in Israel and Pales
tine and encourage divestment from
four specific companies: Elbit Sys
tems Ltd., Hadiklaim Ltd.,Tarifi Ce
ment Ltd. and Dar Alnashr Lil
haya'a Masria lilijaz Alllmi.
With CRH, Quran distributed
petitions across campus to encour
age the ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate to pass legislation urging the
University to divest from the four
companies.
CRH eventually dropped its
campaign for student legislation,
with Quran saying in an interview
with The Daily, "Going through the
Senate led to too much emotional
backlash, so we changed direction."
Quran encouraged collaborative
efforts and person-to-person dia
logue to address issues of injustice,
which he expressed in an op-ed to
The Daily.
"One of the things I learned at
Stanford, an intrinsic American value,
is that we should never turn our backs
to an issue because it's too complex,
difficult or divisive," he wrote.

SPER petition this year calling for
Stanford divestment from four com
panies operating in Israeli settle
ments.
