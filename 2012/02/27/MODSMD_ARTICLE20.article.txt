# LAST-MINUTE LOSS AGAIN
## 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
After demolishing Colorado in
Boulder Thursday night, the Stan
ford men's basketball team trav
eled to face conference bottom
feeder Utah on Saturday. In what
was a back-and-forth game from
start to finish, the Cardinal was un
able to pull off a victory, dropping
a heartbreaker to the Utes, 58-57.
At the start of the game it
seemed as though Stanford (19-10,
9-8 Pac-12) was going to run away
with a sweep of the season series
with Utah. The dominance the
Cardinal had displayed against
Colorado seemed to be in full ef
fect, as it stormed to a 23-14 lead 10
minutes into the half.
Freshman guard Chasson Ran
dle was largely responsible for the
early dominance, scoring eight
quick points. The freshman had yet
another strong game, leading Stan
ford with 19 points and hitting five
threes.
The Cardinal still held a nine
point lead at the eight-minute
mark, at which point the Stanford
offense went cold. The Cardinal
only had two field goal attempts
over the next three minutes, miss
ing both, and turned the ball over
three times.
This cold spell gave Utah (6-22,
3-13) a golden opportunity, and the

Utes seized it. By the five-minute
mark the Stanford lead had been
cut to one, and soon thereafter, a
three-pointer from junior guard
Chris Flines tied the game up.
Hines matched Randle with 19
points to lead Utah.
Stanford went into halftime
down 34-33 and struggled coming
out of the break. The Cardinal did
not score a point for the first five
minutes but was still down just five
thanks to similar scoring struggles
from the Utes. A layup by sopho
more forward Stefan Nastic and a
Randle three tied the game at 38
moments later.
What followed was a period of
back-and-forth scoring in which
neither team could take a defini
tive lead. With just two minutes
left, the game was again tied, this
time at 53.
A free throw from Nastic gave
Stanford a one-point edge, but it
was quickly eliminated by a
jumper from center Jason Wash
burn on the other end. Washburn
had a tremendous game for the
Utes, putting up 17 points, five re
bounds and six blocks.
An offensive rebound and tip
by sophomore forward Dwight
Powell gave the Cardinal the lead
one last time, but Hines drained a
three to give the Utes a two-point

Despite his team's heartbreaking one-point loss to Utah, freshman
guard Chasson Randle has emerged as a star on the perimeter for the
Cardinal, sinking five three-pointers on Saturday.
advantage with just 30 seconds to
play-
After a timeout, the Cardinal
was able to draw the foul on the
other end, sending redshirt senior
forward Josh Owens to the line.
The captain made just one of two
free throws, however, keeping
Utah on top, 58-57.
After Washburn missed a free
throw, Stanford got one last
chance to pull off the win. Randle
rebounded the ball and raced
down the court, attempting a long,
running three. It didn't fall, howev
er, and Utah was able to pull off
the upset.

Poor shooting doomed the
Card. Stanford shot just 36.8 per
cent from the field, a figure that is
not terrible on its own, but is lack
ing when compared to Utah's 44.7
percent. The Utes also shot 17-for
-21 from the charity stripe, making
Stanford pay for its numerous
early fouls by sinking 14 first-half
free throws, and also went 7-for-12
from three-point range.
Ultimately, quality over quanti
ty proved to be a winning strategy
for Utah, as the Utes took 19 fewer
shots than the Cardinal but
drained them at a much higher
clip.
Stanford again had a great
game on the offensive boards, with
15 rebounds compared to Utah's
four. The Cardinal simply needed
to take better advantage of its nu
merous put-back attempts.

Looking ahead to the impend
ing Pac-12 Tournament next week,
the Cardinal still sits in seventh
place in the conference, just a half
game behind UCLA for the sixth
seed.
The Cardinal will close its sea
son against conference-leading
California this week in a critical
matchup. If Stanford beats Cali
fornia and UCLA drops one of its
last two games against Washington
State and Washington, then the
Cardinal will pass the Bruins in the
conference standings due to its
higher overall record.
If the Cardinal is able to earn
the sixth seed, it would mean a re
match with Utah in the first round
of the Pac-12 Tournament.
