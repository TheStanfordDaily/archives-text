# LAST-MINUTE LOSS AGAIN
## 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
After demolishing Colorado in
Boulder Thursday night, the Stan
ford men's basketball team trav
eled to face conference bottom
feeder Utah on Saturday. In what
was a back-and-forth game from
start to finish, the Cardinal was un
able to pull off a victory, dropping
a heartbreaker to the Utes, 58-57.
At the start of the game it
seemed as though Stanford (19-10,
9-8 Pac-12) was going to run away
with a sweep of the season series
with Utah. The dominance the
Cardinal had displayed against
Colorado seemed to be in full ef
fect, as it stormed to a 23-14 lead 10
minutes into the half.
Freshman guard Chasson Ran
dle was largely responsible for the
early dominance, scoring eight
quick points. The freshman had yet
another strong game, leading Stan
ford with 19 points and hitting five
threes.
The Cardinal still held a nine
point lead at the eight-minute
mark, at which point the Stanford
offense went cold. The Cardinal
only had two field goal attempts
over the next three minutes, miss
ing both, and turned the ball over
three times.
This cold spell gave Utah (6-22,
3-13) a golden opportunity, and the

Utes seized it. By the five-minute
mark the Stanford lead had been
cut to one, and soon thereafter, a
three-pointer from junior guard
Chris Flines tied the game up.
Hines matched Randle with 19
points to lead Utah.
Stanford went into halftime
down 34-33 and struggled coming
out of the break. The Cardinal did
not score a point for the first five
minutes but was still down just five
thanks to similar scoring struggles
from the Utes. A layup by sopho
more forward Stefan Nastic and a
Randle three tied the game at 38
moments later.
What followed was a period of
back-and-forth scoring in which
neither team could take a defini
tive lead. With just two minutes
left, the game was again tied, this
time at 53.
A free throw from Nastic gave
Stanford a one-point edge, but it
was quickly eliminated by a
jumper from center Jason Wash
burn on the other end. Washburn
had a tremendous game for the
Utes, putting up 17 points, five re
bounds and six blocks.
An offensive rebound and tip
by sophomore forward Dwight
Powell gave the Cardinal the lead
one last time, but Hines drained a
three to give the Utes a two-point

Despite his team's heartbreaking one-point loss to Utah, freshman
guard Chasson Randle has emerged as a star on the perimeter for the
Cardinal, sinking five three-pointers on Saturday.
