# Cardinal pitchers impress
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Well, the Stanford
baseball team was
n't a one-week
wonder. The sec
ond weekend se
ries of the year was just as impressive
as the first, and after seven games, the
Cardinal looks unstoppable.
For the second straight series,
Stanford capped a strong weekend
with an offensive explosion, follow
ing last week's 18-run outburst with
a 13-run fourth inning Sunday after
noon.
This season, seven of Stanford's
nine regulars are hitting over .315
the other two have combined for 25
RBI and the squad is averaging
over 10 runs per game.
So naturally, the story of the sea
son is... pitching.
Going into the season, everyone
knew that the team's strength would
be its hitting. Seven of eight position
players returned from last year's
squad, and the highly touted recruit
ing classes of hitters had finally gained
enough experience to approach their
potential.
But what about the pitching staff?
Last year, Stanford had to scramble a
little, with senior Danny Sandbrink
stepping into the starting rotation late
in the season, and two of the most re
liable pitchers for Stanford were
starter Jordan Pries and closer Chris
Reed.
Now those three are gone, leaving
Stanford's pitching staff in a state of
flux. Junior Mark Appel returned to
anchor the rotation, but after him,
things were a little more in question.
Redshirt junior Brett Mooneyham
has been a strikeout pitcher in his
time on the Farm, but he came into
the year as a question mark after
missing all of 2011 with a finger injury.
Junior Dean McArdle returned after
some starting experience, but he ap
peared to fit more as a long or middle
reliever. The closer and Sunday
starter roles were up in the air, leaving
most of the pitching staff in doubt
heading into the season.
Seven games into the season,
there is a whole lot less doubt on the
Farm. Of course, when you're 7-0, it's
easy to feel good about how your staff
has been pitching.
It's a whole lot easier to feel confi
dent in pitchers with a 3.32 ERA and
53 strikeouts in 65 innings.llie overall
numbers have been very solid so far,
as only Pacific has been able to score
more than five runs in a game against
Stanford. And five runs is nothing in
college baseball, particularly with a
lineup that averages more than a run
per inning.
However, the overall numbers
don't tell the full story of the Stanford
pitching staff The Cardinal appears
to have found a weekend rotation
consisting of Appel, Mooneyham
and freshman John Hochstatter. And
that trio has gone above and beyond
expectations for Stanford's pitchers
this year.
Appel has looked every bit the
number one MLB Draft prospect
he's been touted to be, baffling Van
derbilt and Texas hitters in his two
starts. He has allowed a single run in
each of his two appearances, pitch
ing seven strong innings both times.
A three-to-one strikeout-to-walk
ratio and only two extra-base hits in
14 innings show just how dominant
he has been.
Mooneyham has been just about
equal to Appel in his first two starts,
closing out one of the best one-two
punches in the country. The redshirt
junior has matched Appel with 15
strikeouts in 14 innings, allowing just
four runs in his two starts His eight
inning gem against Texas on Saturday
was one of the best performances of
his career, and if he pitches like that
for the rest of the season, it will be al
most impossible to win a series
against Stanford.
Appel and Mooneyham have
been extremely impressive, but the
best Cardinal pitcher so far has been
Hochstatter. The freshman came on
in relief for his first collegiate appear
ance, and promptly got 19 Vanderbilt
Commodores out without allowing a
hit. This performance earned him a
start against Texas, and Hochstatter
took the opportunity and ran with it,
going 6.1 innings and allowing just a
single run.
lire trio has been unstoppable,
giving up 18 hits in 40.2 innings for an
unreal .129 opponents' batting aver-
