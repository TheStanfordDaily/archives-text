## KLAHN KEEPS CARD ON HOT STREAK 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis
team picked up a big win on Sat
urday at the Taube Family Tennis
Center, defeating archrival Cal 6-
1. Playing in front of a large crowd
filled with many parents for the
annual Parents' Weekend, the No.
9 Cardinal did not disappoint, sat
isfying the crowd with its decisive
victory.
With the victory, Stanford im
proved to 9-4 on the season and
seems to have recovered from
early stumbles against USC,
UCLA and, most surprisingly,
Fresno State, who all managed to
defeat Stanford at the Taube Fam
ily Tennis Center. The Cardinal is
coming off of two straight impres
sive weekends of play: last week
end at the ITA National Team In
door Championships, when the
squad defeated No. 7 Baylor and
No. 6 Kentucky, and then this
weekend at home where it beat up
on No. 10 Cal.
Not surprisingly, this recent
stretch of good play has coincided
with the return of senior All-
American Bradley Klahn to the
lineup. Klahn had been out for the
beginning of the season with an
unpredictable back ailment, and
his return a couple of weeks ago
has clearly buoyed the team.
"If we have everybody healthy
we're a pretty good team and
we've shown that even when we
don't have everybody healthy
we're still a pretty good team,"
head coach John Whitlinger said.
"But it obviously helps when you
have an NCAA champion back in
your lineup, as it really lengthens
it out and makes everyone else
that much better."
The health and improvement
of the whole team showed on Sat
urday as the Cardinal led right
from the start, when the dynamic
doubles duo of Klahn and fellow
senior Ryan Thacher disposed of
the nation's No. 4 doubles team of
Nick Andrews and Christopher
Konigsfeldt, 8-4. Their win was
shortly followed with a victory
from juniors Dennis Lin and Matt
Kandath, who edged Riki
McLachlan and Andrew Schol
nick to secure the pivotal doubles

point for Stanford.
Whitlinger's recent strategy of
pairing up players from the same
year in the doubles has proved to
be very effective, as the Cardinal
has yet to drop a doubles point
since Klahn's return.The return of
Klahn has enabled this lineup
switch, as now Whitlinger can pair
his two seniors on the top court,
his two juniors on the second and
his two freshmen phenoms, John
Morrissey and Robert Stineman,
on the third.
Those freshmen were once
again instrumental in securing the
victory, as they both dispatched of
their singles opponents on courts
five and six, with Stineman pro
viding the victory-clinching
fourth point for Stanford.

Whitlinger has been amazed and
impressed with the high level of
play of his two freshmen all year
long.

The Cardinal will now look to
build on its burgeoning momen
tum as the team continues to
adapt to the return of Klahn and
the new structure of the lineup.
Perhaps unfortunately for
Whitlinger's squad, the team now
has a 10-day break from match
play, as it will compete in the an
nual Pacific Coast Doubles
Championship this weekend in La
Jolla before ending this quarter's
play against Yale on March 10 at
Taube.
