# Seniors stay perfect
## 78 STRAIGHT WINS AT MAPLES 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team defeated Utah 69-42 at
Maples Pavilion on Senior Day on
Saturday in the last home game of
the Pac-12 conference season.
After routing the Utes by halftime,
the Cardinal struggled a bit in the
second half, but ultimately the visi
tors' resurgence was futile. When
all was said and done, Stanford ex
tended its winning streak on the
Farm to 78 games, and head coach
Tara VanDerveer won her 700 th
game in charge of the Card.
No. 2 Stanford (26-1,17-0 Pac
-12) had four starters score double
figures in points led by sopho
more forward Chiney Ogwu
mike's 16-point, 12-rebound dou
ble-double. The Utes' (13-14,6-10
Pac-12) two leading players com
ing into this contest faced foul
trouble early on, and top-scoring
redshirt sophomore Taryn Wici
jowski, who scored 15 points,
fouled out with 3:33 remaining in
the contest.
In her Stanford career, senior
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike
hasn't lost once on the Maples
Pavilion hardwood and has only
lost 11 of the 135 games she has
played so far for the Cardinal. In
fact, Stanford's defense of its home
court has been so successful in re
cent seasons that not a single play
er in the Cardinal's lineup in
cluding graduating seniors Nneka
Ogwumike, guard Grace Mashore,
guard Lindy La Rocque and red

shirt junior forward Sarah Boothe
knows what defeat at Maples
Pavilion feels like, and the squad
now owns the nation's longest ac
tive home winning streak.
"There's just a culture about
this place that I don't think any
other place can match," Nneka
Ogwumike said. "And especially
with my teammates. I think my
teammates are going to be my best
friends for life. They've really
taught me how to really cherish the
important things, and I think de
fending Maples has been real im
portant. We've had a lot of great
teams come through here, and I
think we've done a really good job
of defending it, playing for each
other and getting all the young
players to understand how impor
tant it is for us to win here at
Maples."
That was evident on Saturday,
especially within the initial four
minutes. By the first timeout, with
15:43 left in the first half, Stanford
led 9-0. Utah had been completely
neutralized on its first two posses
sions, with the shot clock expiring
both times, and had managed just
two field goal attempts in the open
ing minutes. At the first-half buzzer
the Cardinal led the Utes 36-14,
and the writing looked to already
be on the wall for the visitors.
However, the Utes came back
strong after the break, dragging
the lead back down to 15 with five
minutes left. The comeback,
though, started too late, and when
Wicijowski fouled out the pendu
lum swung back in favor of the
Card. As time ran down, seniors
Nneka Ogwumike, Mashore and
La Rocque joined up on court to
play together at Maples for the sec
ond-to-last time and, to huge ap-

plause from the crowd, Mashore
sealed the contest with a shot from
beyond the arc.
"Every time she goes out there
we look for her to score, and we
had a good feeling," said sopho
more forward Chiney Ogwumike
of Mashore. "I think it started be
fore the game when we wanted to
play for our seniors, for them to
have that moment to all be out
there on the court together, and
honestly I think that's the happiest
I've felt almost all year. Grace
works so hard, she is so central to
our team, and for her to come out
and hit a big shot like that, clinch
ing a win on Senior Night. Grace
always is there for us, and it's great
to see her hit that shot."
Asked after the game about
reaching 700 career wins with
Stanford, VanDerveer quashed
any thoughts that her own farewell
is coming anytime soon.
"I'm enjoying coaching, I'm en
joying it a lot," she said, "and [the
800 mark] is only three years if you
can get 30 a year. I've got to hang
around for some little siblings."
Those siblings are the two
youngest Ogwumike sisters, Chi
som "Olivia" and Ernima "Erika,"
who walked out onto the hard
wood after the game with sister
Nneka as she and her fellow sen
iors were honored by the fans. If
they are any bit as good as their
elder sisters, and should they de
cide to come to the Farm, life after
Nneka won't be getting any easier
for the other Pac-12 schools.
Stanford will finish its home
schedule on Wednesday against
Seattle University at 7 p.m.

I've felt almost all year. Grace
works so hard, she is so central to
our team, and for her to come out
and hit a big shot like that, clinch
ing a win on Senior Night. Grace
always is there for us, and it's great
to see her hit that shot."
Asked after the game about
reaching 700 career wins with
Stanford, VanDerveer quashed
any thoughts that her own farewell
is coming anytime soon.
"I'm enjoying coaching, I'm en
joying it a lot," she said, "and [the
800 mark] is only three years if you
can get 30 a year. I've got to hang
around for some little siblings."
Those siblings are the two
youngest Ogwumike sisters, Chi
som "Olivia" and Ernima "Erika,"
who walked out onto the hard
wood after the game with sister
Nneka as she and her fellow sen
iors were honored by the fans. If
they are any bit as good as their
elder sisters, and should they de
cide to come to the Farm, life after
Nneka won't be getting any easier
for the other Pac-12 schools.
Stanford will finish its home
schedule on Wednesday against
Seattle University at 7 p.m.

Sophomore forward Chiney Ogwumike had 16 points and 12 rebounds in her sister's second-to-last regularseason
game at Maples Pavilion, which saw Nnemkadi and the senior class cap off perfect home careers.
The Stanford women's basket
ball team defeated Utah 69-42 at
Maples Pavilion on Senior Day on
Saturday in the last home game of
the Pac-12 conference season.
After routing the Utes by halftime,
the Cardinal struggled a bit in the
second half, but ultimately the visi
tors' resurgence was futile. When
all was said and done, Stanford ex
tended its winning streak on the
Farm to 78 games, and head coach
Tara VanDerveer won her 700 th
game in charge of the Card.
No. 2 Stanford (26-1,17-0 Pac
-12) had four starters score double
figures in points led by sopho
more forward Chiney Ogwu
mike's 16-point, 12-rebound dou
ble-double. The Utes' (13-14,6-10
Pac-12) two leading players com
ing into this contest faced foul
trouble early on, and top-scoring
redshirt sophomore Taryn Wici
jowski, who scored 15 points,
fouled out with 3:33 remaining in
the contest.
In her Stanford career, senior
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike
hasn't lost once on the Maples
Pavilion hardwood and has only
lost 11 of the 135 games she has
played so far for the Cardinal. In
fact, Stanford's defense of its home
court has been so successful in re
cent seasons that not a single play
er in the Cardinal's lineup in
cluding graduating seniors Nneka
Ogwumike, guard Grace Mashore,
guard Lindy La Rocque and red

shirt junior forward Sarah Boothe
knows what defeat at Maples
Pavilion feels like, and the squad
now owns the nation's longest ac
tive home winning streak.
"There's just a culture about
this place that I don't think any
other place can match," Nneka
Ogwumike said. "And especially
with my teammates. I think my
teammates are going to be my best
friends for life. They've really
taught me how to really cherish the
important things, and I think de
fending Maples has been real im
portant. We've had a lot of great
teams come through here, and I
think we've done a really good job
of defending it, playing for each
other and getting all the young
players to understand how impor
tant it is for us to win here at
Maples."
That was evident on Saturday,
especially within the initial four
minutes. By the first timeout, with
15:43 left in the first half, Stanford
led 9-0. Utah had been completely
neutralized on its first two posses
sions, with the shot clock expiring
both times, and had managed just
two field goal attempts in the open
ing minutes. At the first-half buzzer
the Cardinal led the Utes 36-14,
and the writing looked to already
be on the wall for the visitors.
However, the Utes came back
strong after the break, dragging
the lead back down to 15 with five
minutes left. The comeback,
though, started too late, and when
Wicijowski fouled out the pendu
lum swung back in favor of the
Card. As time ran down, seniors
Nneka Ogwumike, Mashore and
La Rocque joined up on court to
play together at Maples for the sec
ond-to-last time and, to huge ap-

plause from the crowd, Mashore
sealed the contest with a shot from
beyond the arc.
"Every time she goes out there
we look for her to score, and we
had a good feeling," said sopho
more forward Chiney Ogwumike
of Mashore. "I think it started be
fore the game when we wanted to
play for our seniors, for them to
have that moment to all be out
there on the court together, and
honestly I think that's the happiest
I've felt almost all year. Grace
works so hard, she is so central to
our team, and for her to come out
