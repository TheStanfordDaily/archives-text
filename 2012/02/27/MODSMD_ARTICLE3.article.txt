## University grants XOX reprieve Admins reiterate lasting intention to terminate lease 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford announced in a state
ment Friday that, following meet
ings with Chi Theta Chi representa
tives, it would delay the planned
takeover of the XOX residence
from April 1 to Aug. 31. The state
ment emphasized, however, that
the University still intends to termi
nate the house's lease in response
to "pressing life safety issues."
"The [alumni] board has not
demonstrated consistent leader
ship, nor sufficient management of
the property, thus putting our stu
dents at risk, which is simply not ac
ceptable," the Friday statement
said.
While welcoming the
takeover's postponement, mem
bers of the XOX community said
that they would continue to contest
the University's decision and seek
to maintain the house's independ
ence. At a Thursday meeting with
Stanford administrators, the XOX
Alumni Board submitted 200
pages of evidence addressing Uni
versity concerns and outlined a
case for continued autonomy.
Abel Allison 'OB, president of
the alumni board, argued that the
initial transition date of April 1 con

travened the terms of the lease, and
that the University had not given
XOX sufficient time to address the
grounds offered for the lease's ter
mination.
According to Allison, the Uni
versity did not give an explanation
for the postponement. He said
that the postponement would
allow the XOX house to remain
open this summer as usual rather
than undergoing any University
renovations.
"The language of the lease spec
ifies that if you're in default of
the lease you have 15 days to fix
or take reasonable steps to fix all of
the errors," Allison said. "That's

what our group worked extremely
hard to do after our first meeting."
Autumn Burnes 'l2, XOX's res
ident assistant (RA), emphasized
the role that support from the Stan
ford community had played in pro
moting a constructive dialogue
with the University. A petition sup
porting XOX's independence had
over 2,000 signatures at the time of
publication.
"Everyone has been really fo
cused on what makes Chi Theta
Chi an asset to the University,"
Burnes said. "That's really helped
us hold the support not only of the
community, but also of ResEd and
Housing. . . . Hopefully we're

starting to get some traction."
Allison added that while the
University has yet to shift from its
initial stance of unilaterally termi
nating the lease, XOX representa
tives are "working hard to convince
them that it's worth working with
us on getting to an agreeable solu
tion ... that involves us keeping
the lease,"
In assessing areas where Chi
Theta Chi could make demonstra
ble changes, Allison identified a
need for structural reform within
XOX in order to address long
standing University concerns and

develop confidence in XOX as an
institution.
"We intend to be extremely
proactive about developing a pro
posal of changes we want to make
to our organization to address
some issues that have been bother
ing the University for a long time,"
Allison said. "We're working on a
plan we think has a high probabili
ty of ensuring long-term stability at
the house."
"I want to show, not tell, why we
should keep this house," Allison
added. "The University needs to let
us show them."
While University statements
have stressed a desire to maintain
ChiTheta Chi's "distinct character"
after the planned transition to Uni
versity management, Burnes said
that Chi Theta Chi's independence
has a unique effect on the house
community.
"What makes it special is the ac
countability and the responsibility,"
Burnes said. "It really brings us to
gether in away that doesn't exist in
other places."

to our organization to address
some issues that have been bother
ing the University for a long time,"
Allison said. "We're working on a
plan we think has a high probabili
ty of ensuring long-term stability at
the house."
"I want to show, not tell, why we
should keep this house," Allison
added. "The University needs to let
us show them."
While University statements
have stressed a desire to maintain
ChiTheta Chi's "distinct character"
after the planned transition to Uni
versity management, Burnes said
that Chi Theta Chi's independence
has a unique effect on the house
community.
"What makes it special is the ac
countability and the responsibility,"
Burnes said. "It really brings us to
gether in away that doesn't exist in
other places."
