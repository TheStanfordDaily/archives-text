## State senator unveils bill at Haas Center Proposed legislation will facilitate reallocation of surplus medicine 
### JUDITH PELPOLA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
State Senator Joe Simitian M.A. 'OO
(D-Palo Alto) unveiled a bill intended to
help reallocate unused prescription
drugs to uninsured Californians last Fri
day at the Flaas Center for Public Serv
ice. The proposed legislation, Senate Bill
1329, would make it easier for more
health care facilities to donate their un
used prescription drugs to those unable
to afford their own. Around 30 attended
for the presentation.
The new bill builds on prior
legislation authored by Senator
Simitian in 2005, which gave
counties the opportunity to cre
ate distribution programs for un
used prescription drugs.
The idea for the original 2005
bill came from Josemaria Pater
no 'O2 M.D. 'OB, who won Simit
ian's "There Oughta Be a Law"
contest. The contest allowed pri
vate citizens to submit ideas for
change in Palo Alto to Simitian.
Paterno was a first-year medical
student at the time he won the
contest.
The nonprofit organization
Supporting Initiatives to Redis
tribute Unused Medicine
(SIRUM), which hosted Friday's
reception, approached Simitian
about improving the 2005 legisla
tion. During the event, Simitian
credited SIRUM with helping to
expand drug redistribution be
yond the original bill. SIRUM
runs a website that healthcare fa
cilities with surplus medications
can log onto and scan in the med
ications they have, which the site
then allocates to clinics that have
requested that type of medica
tion.
An estimated $lOO million of

unused and unexpired prescrip
tion medicine is disposed of year
ly in California, both by incinera
tion and dumping in local water
supplies, according to SIRUM.
SIRUM also said that approxi
mately one-third of uninsured
Californians choose not to pur
chase medicine because of its
cost.
Simitian said he hopes the
new bill will be passed by the end
of the year.
"We would love to streamline
drug donations all across the
country," said George Wang,
SIRUM's director of operations.
Both Simitian and SIRUM
said it was important to increase
the number of donors and recipi
ents, as well as weaken the legal
barriers that can prevent facili
ties from donating their surplus
medication.
"It gives us away of not wast
ing and giving back to the com
munities," Deane Kirchner, di
rector of nursing at Lincoln Glen
Manor and Nursing Facility
(LGM), said. LGM was the first
facility to join the donation pro
gram.
Mymy Phu, the pharmacist su
pervisor at Santa Clara Valley
Medical Center (SCVMC), also
spoke at the event, highlighting
the program's effects of helping
the unemployed, who often lose
their health coverage. She also
said the program helps to de

crease the environmental con
tamination that often results
from improper disposal of un
used prescription drugs.
Phu noted the bill's potential
to save millions in healthcare and
its potential to expand.
"I think the bill is going to
have a positive impact in the
community," Phu said.
SCVMC attempted their own
redistribution program in 2006,
but it was not until SIRUM
stepped in last year that that
Santa Clara saw results, she said.
According to Phu, SIRUM
streamlined the process and al
lowed the program to flourish.
Director of Public Affairs for
the California Association of
Healthcare Facilities (CAHF)
Deborah Pacyna said that out of
the 1,250 healthcare facilities
that are potential donors, only 70
currently participate in the
donor program.
One cause is that most health
care facilities are located in
counties without a donor pro
gram and must ship their surplus
to other counties rather than
helping their own communities,
Pacyna said. In an effort to correct
this, she said SIRUM has had pre
sentations at CAHF chapter
meetings to spread awareness of
the program.
