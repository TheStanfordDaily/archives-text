## Admins consolidate 'pre-college' New unit brings together six Stanford programs 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
Earlier this month, the Univer
sity announced the formation of a
new administrative unit called
Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies
(SPCS), which will bring all of
Stanford's pre-college educational
programs into one department.
SPCS, currently comprised of six
on-campus organizations, will exist
under the umbrella of Stanford
Continuing Studies (SCS).
According to the SPCS website,
the new unit will "foster the devel
opment of tomorrow's undergrad
uates through programs that en
rich the educational experience of
pre-college students."
Raymond Ravaglia, associate
dean and director of SPCS, said the
unit will allow current programs
aimed at pre-college students to
share resources, promoting inter
program interaction. He added
that SPCS will also help new de
partments and programs as they
start to be developed.
"There was a constant sense of
common need," Ravaglia said.
"There were clearly opportunities
for synergies on the marketing
side, on the back office side."
The six organizations included
in SPCS are the Stanford Universi
ty Online High School, the Educa
tion Program for Gifted Youth
Summer Institutes (EPGY), the
Stanford Medical Youth Science
Program, the Stanford University
Mathematics Camp, the Stanford
Math Circle and the Stanford
Summer Humanities Institute. The
last will take place for the first time
this summer.
Ravaglia said University offi
cials had often considered creating
a "mirror image" to SCS, which, in
stead of tracking students after
they graduate, will try to focus on
students before they enter college.
According to Ravaglia, this
program came to fruition due to a
number of factors: the realization
of a definite need for the program
among University officials, the in
creased popularity of the Stanford
University Online High School
and the retirement of a longtime
EPGY faculty director.
Ravaglia also said the collabo
rative spirit of SPCS will allow for
financial and administrative bene
fits across all pre-collegiate pro
grams.
"There are a lot of opportuni
ties for improving cost efficien
cies," he said.
For example, in the past each
pre-college program had to buy in
formation from College Board
separately. The programs then
used this information in order to
market to select students who had
scored above a certain threshold
on standardized tests. With the
creation of SPCS, the data will
only have to be purchased once,
Ravaglia said.
"There will be some new posi
tions being created," Ravaglia
said. "What we're really hoping to
see administratively is more of a
recognition that there is this pre
collegiate ecosystem is out there,
[even if it's] not necessarily been
something that anyone's paying
attention to.
Ravaglia said that they have
noticed a need for programs such
as the SPCS amongst middle and
high school students.
"The focus is those kids who

are hoping to attend a university
like Stanford and who are aca
demically ready and, in many
cases, have pressing need for more
advanced instructional or intellec
tual experiences than are readily
available in their normal school
setting," Ravaglia said.
"I'm looking forward to the ex
pansion of SPCS with other pro
grams coming aboard, current and
new, from various areas of the
campus," said Judith Ned, execu
tive director of the Stanford Med
ical Youth Science Program. "I
think this is just a great idea. The
University is on the cusp of some
thing great. Hats off to the SPCS
leadership for really thinking
about this."
During the next six months,
one of the main goals of SPCS
will be to ensure that each of its
pre-existing constituent pro
grams operate smoothly for the
upcoming summer. Ravaglia
hopes that SPCS will make its
first call in mid-spring for new
University initiatives to be imple
mented in fall.
