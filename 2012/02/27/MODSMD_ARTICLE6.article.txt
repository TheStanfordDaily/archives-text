## Admins consolidate 'pre-college' New unit brings together six Stanford programs 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
Earlier this month, the Univer
sity announced the formation of a
new administrative unit called
Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies
(SPCS), which will bring all of
Stanford's pre-college educational
programs into one department.
SPCS, currently comprised of six
on-campus organizations, will exist
under the umbrella of Stanford
Continuing Studies (SCS).
According to the SPCS website,
the new unit will "foster the devel

uates through programs that en
rich the educational experience of
pre-college students."
Raymond Ravaglia, associate
dean and director of SPCS, said the
unit will allow current programs
aimed at pre-college students to
share resources, promoting inter
program interaction. He added
that SPCS will also help new de

start to be developed.
"There was a constant sense of
common need," Ravaglia said.
"There were clearly opportunities
for synergies on the marketing

The six organizations included
in SPCS are the Stanford Universi

Summer Institutes (EPGY), the
Stanford Medical Youth Science
Program, the Stanford University
Mathematics Camp, the Stanford
Math Circle and the Stanford
Summer Humanities Institute. The
last will take place for the first time
this summer.
Ravaglia said University offi
cials had often considered creating
a "mirror image" to SCS, which, in
stead of tracking students after
they graduate, will try to focus on
students before they enter college.
According to Ravaglia, this
program came to fruition due to a
number of factors: the realization
of a definite need for the program
among University officials, the in
creased popularity of the Stanford
University Online High School
and the retirement of a longtime
EPGY faculty director.
Ravaglia also said the collabo
rative spirit of SPCS will allow for
financial and administrative bene
fits across all pre-collegiate pro
grams.
