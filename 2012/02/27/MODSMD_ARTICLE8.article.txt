## ASSU proposes new governing document 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU released a newly
proposed constitution in a cam
pus-wide email Saturday night.
ASSU President Michael Cruz
'l2 and ASSU Parliamentarian
Alex Kindel 'l4 co-wrote the doc
ument, which at 32 pages is nearly
half the length of the current con
stitution. Cruz and Kindel serve as
co-chairs of the ASSU Governing
Documents Commission (GDC),
a body that Cruz chartered in
spring 2011.
"Going into writing [the pro
posed constitution], there were
definitely things that I understood
as needs, for instance the special
fees process, representation by
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents and the structure of the Uni
versity committee system," Cruz
said.
Cruz described the key goals of
the overhaul as refocusing the
mission of the ASSU back to its
initial goal of advocacy and pro
gramming and ensuring that each
branch of the ASSU has a clearly
defined mission. He added that
the "legislative branch's power of
the purse" is enhanced in the new
constitution.
Before being released to the
general student body, the pro
posed constitution was reviewed
by ASSU senators, Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC) members and
administrators. The GDC also
studied the governing documents
at peer institutions such as UC-
Berkeley, Brown, Harvard,
Princeton and Yale, and spoke
with former student body presi
dents both from Stanford and
other universities.
Cruz said that the GDC will
move to introduce bills about the
constitution to the Undergradu
ate Senate and GSC this week as a
way of shifting the conversation
about the document into a more
formal setting. He added that the
GDC is not asking either body to
vote on the bills this week.
The new constitution must be
approved by both legislative bod
ies or petitioned onto the bal

lot if rejected before the stu
dent body votes on the document.
If two-thirds of Stanford students
approve the bill (this two-thirds
must comprise at minimum 15
percent of both the undergradu
ate and graduate student popula
tions), then the document will be
sent to the University President,
Provost and Board of Trustees for
approval. These individuals would
then send the bill back as either
approved, approved with qualifi
cations or denied. If the bill is ap
proved with qualifications, the
GDC will work to incorporate the
final comments, Cruz said.
The final stage of the approval
process can take anywhere from
two weeks to several months,
Cruz said.
The ASSU will hold four more
feedback sessions regarding the
proposed document. The first ses
sion was held last Friday before
the document was publicly avail
able. An initial feedback session
planned for Thursday was post
poned.
The upcoming sessions will be
held Monday from 8:30 to 10 p.m.
in Old Union Room 215, Wednes
day from 7 to 9 p.m. in Old Union
Room 104, Friday from 11:30 a.m.
to 1 p.m. in Arrillaga Family Din
ing Commons and next Monday,
March 5, from 8:30 tolO p.m. in
Old Union Room 104. According
to Cruz, these feedback sessions
will be located in Old Union and
Arrillaga in hopes of maximizing
the number of students who will
attend.
"We want feedback from the
average Stanford student, not just
simply the person who's going to
reach out and try to find it," Cruz
said. "We wanted to have [the
feedback sessions] in places
where people can swing by for 15
minutes or five minutes or what
ever."
The last full constitutional
overhaul occurred in 1960.
"The entire system of the
ASSU is in need of an update,"
Cruz said.
