## ASSU senators may urge Etchemendy to support Fadi Quran 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Julia Enthoven 
ASSU undergraduate senators
drafted a resolution Sunday calling
for Provost and Acting President
John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 to issue
a public statement in support of fair
legal treatment and the immediate
release of Fadi Quran 'lO.
Quran, a Stanford alumnus, was
arrested by Israeli authorities last
Friday while demonstrating in He
bron, West Bank.
In addition to two other stu
dents, four ASSU officials attended
the meeting: the co-authors of the
resolution, Senators Samar Qatari
'l4 and Janani Ramachandran 'l4,
ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2
and Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4.
The representatives discussed
the importance of ensuring the
bill's accordance with Article 1.
Section 5.8 of the ASSU Constitu
tion, which requires that all ASSU
bills only concern matters that di
rectly affect Stanford students.
"We should make it very clear
that this is not a statement on any
thing more broadly," Cruz said of
the resolution's scope. "This is a
statement on this case, this situation
... The narrowing of this bill has to
be very clear."
The senators argued that the
issue directly affects Stanford stu
dents because of the "emotionally
distressing" footage of Quran's ar
rest and his close associations with
many current students. They cited
the outpouring of support and out
rage following Quran's incarcera
tion including multiple peti
tions, one of which gained more
than 1,000 signatures by the time of
the meeting as evidence of the
importance of the issue to students
and faculty.
Still, both Cruz and Elhanan
were concerned about the bill
being "a stretch" and encouraged
the authors to use narrow and spe
cific wording.
"Since he's no longer a Stanford
student, that clause doesn't affect
him," Cruz said. "The clause ... ap
plies to current Stanford students
who are experiencing emotional
distress, pain, etc."
There was also some debate
about whether the bill should urge

Etchemendy to support Quran's
"immediate release" versus his "fair
trial." While Elhanan said that he
thought the recommendation was
making an overreaching assump
tion that Quran will have an unfair
trial, Qatari said she thought that
calling for his release would show
absolute solidarity and reflect what
she sees as the majority campus
opinion that, regardless of the result
of his trial, Quran was detained un
justly.
"I think it is a lot better than it
could have been," Elhanan said
about the bill. "I'm not saying I'll
vote for it, but I'm really glad to be
part of the discussion, and I appreci
ate the opportunity to raise my con
cerns."
According to Israeli law,
Quran's trial must occur within 48
hours of his arrest because he is
being tried in military court. Ra
machandran said the senators will
present the re-worded bill at Tues
day's Senate meeting regardless of
whether Quran has been tried or re
leased.
