The Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital has joined forces with
Henry M. Gunn High School and
Palo Alto High School to promote
mental health in high school stu
dents as part of Project Safety Net,
a mental health initiative based in
Palo Alto.
"As a school district and a hospi
tal, our missions are joined," said
Shashank Joshi, director of the child
and adolescent psychiatry residen
cy program at Lucile Packard, ac
cording to Inside Stanford Medi
cine. Joshi also serves as an execu
tive committee member at Project
Safety Net.
The collaboration follows multi
ple teen suicides in 2009 and 2010 at
both Gunn and Palo Alto High.The
program seeks to increase teen
awareness of common mental
health issues and methods of re
sponse, in addition to reinforcing
positive social bonds between stu
dents.
The More Than Sad project at
Palo Alto High School includes a
video presentation that teaches stu
dents how to identify and respond
appropriately to depression. The
video medium won teacher ap
proval due to its portability and the
ability to split up the program's de
livery into multiple sessions, ac
cording to Inside Stanford Medi
cine.
Initiatives at Gunn have focused
on breaking traditional social codes
by encouraging upperclassmen to
approach freshmen as peers. The
programs have also incorporated
collaboration with the peer support
group Reach Out. Care. Know
(ROCK). ROCK recruits students
from different social groups to act
as peer leaders and deliver encour
aging messages to students.
Lucile Packard has been instru
mental in providing funding for the
Palo Alto projects by assisting with
the clinical and research infrastruc
ture, according to Inside Stanford
Medicine.
