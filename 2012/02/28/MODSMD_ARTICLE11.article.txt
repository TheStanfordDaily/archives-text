## Waste Check Student groups advocate for food waste reduction, sustainability 
### KADEN FREEMAN 
There is much more to a compost
bin than meets the eye. The bins,
located in eateries and dining
halls across campus, are the result
of an extensive campaign and col
laboration between student groups and
Stanford Dining to create a more sustain
able food system on campus.
Along with the compost bins, many of the
steps taken toward a more sustainable uni
versity have been the result of institutional
ized, student-led efforts that have gained
momentum.These include the efforts of Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS), cur
rently led by co-presidents Anna Doty 'l2
and Alexander Luisi 'l2. SSS promotes sus
tainability both on and off campus, taking a
holistic approach to environmentally sus
tainable practices, from raising awareness to
waste reduction.
"We take all the waste from one building,
like one of the buildings in Main Quad,"
Luisi said. "We separate the compost, recy
clables and waste, [then] weigh it out and put
it on display in White Plaza, so everyone can
see just how much waste they are creating
and how much trash can actually be com
posted or recycled."
SSS often collaborates with Stanford

Dining on issues of food waste and sustain
ability.
"During large-scale events, such as NSO's
[New Student Orientation] Zero-Waste
Lunch, SSS members help staff the event and
educate those who attend," Doty said. "It is
important to have Stanford Dining on board
with us, because it is the most visible outlet in
the way students interact with and see how
waste is handled on campus."
Other groups work toward food sustain
ability at Stanford, too. The Stanford Farm
Project (SFP), a group founded in the spring
of 2010, originated from a push for an educa
tional farm on campus.
"We realized our interests and goals
stretched far further than this initial [educa
tional] effort," said Jenny Rempel 'l2, a
farmer, active member of the group and cur
rent Daily columnist, "So we decided to
form a larger organization focused on advo
cating for more just and sustainable food
systems on campus and beyond."
The group has worked with SSS and Stan
ford Dining on coordinating composting
awareness weeks, and it is currently in the
planning stage of a green labeling campaign
for eateries on campus. However, the work
toward creating a more sustainable food sys
tem at Stanford is not without challenges.
"Campaigns to change campus policies

are often long struggles," Rempel
said. "It can be hard to sustain stu
dent momentum over multi-quar
ter or multi-year projects."
According to Luisi, there is a
host of other challenges student
groups face in promoting their
work.
"Stanford's campus is very de
centralized," Luisi said. "You have
different academic departments,
Stanford Dining and independent
eateries, which all have different
waste policies. This is further com
plicated with the purchasing prac
tices from vendors, who all have different
contracts with the university when it comes
to what kind of silverware, food and contain
ers to sell, among other things."

This current state of decentralization
makes implementing a blanket waste policy
for Stanford difficult. However, both stu
dent groups remain optimistic. The Univer
sity is currently working on creating a Stan
ford Long-Term Sustainability Plan a
general list of goals to become a zero-waste
campus.
"We, the students, are the customers of
the University," Doty said. "If we demon
strate there is something we want on campus,
our voices will be heard."

Doty also stressed the importance of stu
dent involvement in the further develop
ment of sustainable food systems at Stan
ford, noting that even a zero-waste campus
would require a large amount of energy and
resources for transporting the waste off cam
pus and processing it.
"Having students take ownership of our
campus and where we are sending our waste
is just as important as the efforts being made
at the institutional level," Doty said. "Change
keeps on coming because students are push
ing for it."

Doty also stressed the importance of stu
dent involvement in the further develop
ment of sustainable food systems at Stan
ford, noting that even a zero-waste campus
would require a large amount of energy and
resources for transporting the waste off cam
pus and processing it.
"Having students take ownership of our
campus and where we are sending our waste
is just as important as the efforts being made
at the institutional level," Doty said. "Change
keeps on coming because students are push
ing for it."
