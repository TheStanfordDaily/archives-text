## OP-EDS An exhortation for occupation 
### PETER MCDONALD'11 Occupier of Meyer Library 
You may know me. I am "the
Occupy dude." I receive
your quizzical stares every
day. The two questions I face most
often during my occupation of Fred
Hampton (a.k.a. Meyer) Library
are "Is Occupy still going on?" and
"Are you a Stanford student?" De
spite having successfully Occupied
the Future in December, there
seems to be a sense of disbelief that
Stanford students would actually
Occupy or call themselves Occu
piers (What are we, Kal?). To an
swer your questions: I graduated in
the spring, and Occupy will contin
ue as long as structural economic
inequality is in place. And yes, we
are actually protesting something.
Over the past two months, we have
spent our time organizing around
the nationwide March 1 Day of
Action to support public educa
tion and specifically, to protest
Governor Jerry Brown's continued
cuts to public education in the midst
of prohibitively rising tuition costs
for UCs, CSUs and community col
leges and to support the proposed
tax on millionaires and the oil tax,
both of which would go toward
funding education. Although Stan
ford is a private university, the strug
gle to fund public education is an
issue that bears direct relevance to
this campus.
This month, all Stanford alumni
received an email from President
Hennessy crowing about the bil
lions of dollars that this University
just raised to prepare Stanford for
the future. While public institutions
face cuts that may threaten their fu
ture, Stanford's looks secure
(What's the problem? We got ours,
right?). However, this disparity is
not something worth celebrating.
This disparity is the educational
manifestation of the regressive re
distribution of wealth that has
taken place over the past few
decades. When coupled with rising
tuition and the increasing burden
of a system of debt-financed educa
tion, this disparity threatens to
form a permanent gulf in the state
of California over the access to
higher education.
It is still a matter of debate as to
whether access to higher education
is indeed a human right, but what is
not open for debate is whether it is
a public necessity for a free and
functioning society. As a private in
stitution, Stanford charged itself in
its founding grant with the task of
"promoting the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization," and that
is a noble mission. California's sys
tem of public institutions is the pub
lic welfare. They are the ones who
are faced with the real task with ed
ucating the populace of California,

not just 13,000 of its "elite."
I sometimes hear from Occupy
activists that Stanford doesn't be
long in the Occupy movement be
cause it's an institution of the future
1 percent. They want to know why
any of us would have a problem
with structural inequality when
we're the ones who benefit from it.
I do not believe this, though. If we
are a place of privilege, then those

privileges should compel us into
greater action, not guilt us into inac
tion. If we really are leaders in the
field of education, if we really are a
model educational institution, then
we have a higher obligation than
anyone else to defend education
when it is threatened.
I know that Stanford students
don't really like to make a scene
and find protests ineffective. They
prefer white papers from consult
ing firms or campaigns for public
office, but this emphasis on solu
tions first can sometimes approach
the myopic. Instead, think about
what it would mean if Stanford
didn't have a presence at a nation
wide day of action for public edu
cation, if we don't add our voice to
the voice of all the other great edu
cational institutions making them
selves heard in the Bay Area and
nationwide.
The Occupy movement does
not claim to be saviors of public ed
ucation. We are here to provide a
space for discussion as much to ad
vocate for any one specific issue.
This upcoming decade, I believe,
will be a crucial time in the history
of this country and the world. The
fate of education will go a long way
toward informing that history. I
would hope that even in week eight
of the quarter, Stanford students
are able to find time to stand up for
what they believe in. You know
where to find us.

the nationwide March 1 Day of
Action to support public educa
tion and specifically, to protest
Governor Jerry Brown's continued
cuts to public education in the midst
of prohibitively rising tuition costs
for UCs, CSUs and community col
leges and to support the proposed
tax on millionaires and the oil tax,
both of which would go toward
funding education. Although Stan
ford is a private university, the strug
gle to fund public education is an
issue that bears direct relevance to
this campus.
This month, all Stanford alumni
received an email from President
Hennessy crowing about the bil
lions of dollars that this University
just raised to prepare Stanford for
the future. While public institutions
face cuts that may threaten their fu
ture, Stanford's looks secure
(What's the problem? We got ours,
right?). However, this disparity is
not something worth celebrating.
This disparity is the educational
manifestation of the regressive re
distribution of wealth that has
taken place over the past few
decades. When coupled with rising
tuition and the increasing burden
of a system of debt-financed educa
tion, this disparity threatens to
form a permanent gulf in the state
of California over the access to
higher education.
It is still a matter of debate as to
whether access to higher education
is indeed a human right, but what is
not open for debate is whether it is
a public necessity for a free and
functioning society. As a private in
stitution, Stanford charged itself in
its founding grant with the task of
"promoting the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization," and that
is a noble mission. California's sys
tem of public institutions is the pub
lic welfare. They are the ones who
are faced with the real task with ed
ucating the populace of California,

not just 13,000 of its "elite."
I sometimes hear from Occupy
activists that Stanford doesn't be
long in the Occupy movement be
cause it's an institution of the future
1 percent. They want to know why
any of us would have a problem
with structural inequality when
we're the ones who benefit from it.
I do not believe this, though. If we
are a place of privilege, then those

privileges should compel us into
greater action, not guilt us into inac
tion. If we really are leaders in the
field of education, if we really are a
model educational institution, then
we have a higher obligation than
anyone else to defend education
when it is threatened.
I know that Stanford students
don't really like to make a scene
and find protests ineffective. They
prefer white papers from consult
ing firms or campaigns for public
office, but this emphasis on solu
tions first can sometimes approach
the myopic. Instead, think about
what it would mean if Stanford
didn't have a presence at a nation
wide day of action for public edu
cation, if we don't add our voice to
the voice of all the other great edu
cational institutions making them
selves heard in the Bay Area and
nationwide.
The Occupy movement does
not claim to be saviors of public ed
ucation. We are here to provide a
space for discussion as much to ad
vocate for any one specific issue.
This upcoming decade, I believe,
will be a crucial time in the history
of this country and the world. The
fate of education will go a long way
toward informing that history. I
would hope that even in week eight
of the quarter, Stanford students
are able to find time to stand up for
what they believe in. You know
where to find us.

Ifweareaplaceof
privilege, then those
privileges should
compel us into
greater action.
