4 4 are two ways of get
ting home, and one of
them is to stay there. The
other is to walk round the whole
world till we come back to the same
place," writes G.K. Chesterton, an
early-20th century wizard of words,
in the introduction to his book "The
Everlasting Man."
He then continues by summa
rizing a story he had yet to write
about "some boy whose farm or
cottage stood on such a slope, and
who went on his travels to find
something, such as the effigy and
grave of some giant; and when he
was far enough from home he
looked back and saw that his own
farm and kitchen garden, shining
flat on the hillside like the colors
and quartering's of a shield, were
but parts of some such gigantic fig
ure, on which he had always lived,
but which was too large and too
close to be seen."
What if we've been trying to get
to where we've always been?
We all have ambitions and goals
for our future. For some, it may be a
detailed, 40-page single-spaced life
plan (the original of which is kept in
a top-secret vault in the nonexist
ent basement of Old Union) and,
for others, it may be as vague as to
just "be happy." My guess is that
you're probably somewhere in be
tween. Law School? A successful
engineering career? Top pick in the
NFL draft? (Here's to hoping An
drew Luck reads this and shoots
me an email!)
Whatever the case, we all have
some projection of the ideal future
that we are progressing toward and
trying to reach: the summit, the
golden age, the actualization of po
tential, the ultimate fulfillment and

validation. But there's a nagging
chorus lingering in the air that is
continuously drowned out by the
clamor of our hard work and busy
ness. ft embodies the theme of
Chesterton's story and screams,
"What if we've been trying to get to
where we've always been?" (It
sounds exactly like Manchester
Orchestra's song "Simple Math,"
which happens to have the coolest
music video of all time.)
There are two types of goals we
attempt to reach: achievement and
transformation. The former are the
more concrete aspirations, and
they are never ends in themselves.
No one wants to become a doctor
just for the sake of becoming a doc
tor. The root desire is a combina
tion of helping people (or gaining
the satisfaction of helping people),
the high salary, the social status or
to fulfill a lifelong dream of turning
your life into the show "Scrubs."
There is a complication with
treating the simplest desires, such
as wanting to be happy or success
ful or influential, as goals in and of
themselves. How much is enough?
Will you know it when you reach
it? Chesterton adds,"There are two
ways to get enough. One is to ac
quire more and more. The other is
to desire less."
Regarding the two types of
goals previously described, I've
continuously advocated for the lat
ter, the transformative process. Re
gardless of where you go, what job
you have or whom you marry, the
constant in each situation is you.
So rather than trying to achieve a
certain status, it is better to trans
form or rather be transformed
into a certain type of person. In
stead of holding an occupation as a

target, allow your character to be
primary. Rather than striving to
become a genius coder, work to be
come a patient and understanding
person who also codes extremely
well. Instead of trying to become a
suave entrepreneur, work to be
come a generous and compassion
ate person who happens to run
million-dollar companies.
The true superiority of this goal
is that it can happen right where
you are, today. The ideal future, the
golden age of opportunity, the ulti
mate fulfillment and validation
that we predict for the future and
have anxiously anticipated has
come near and is all around us
right now. That place we've been
trying to get to where we can
take steps toward becoming a per
son who loves and forgives and is
patient, humble and joyful inde
pendent of circumstances is ac
tually where we've always been.
TTie boy in Chesterton's story
was unable to see he was falling
asleep and waking up everyday
within the fulfillment of his quest
because he didn't recognize his
surroundings for what they were. It
is only by re-seeing, or possibly
seeing for the first time, the oppor
tunities and potential around us
everyday that we can grow and be
transformed into something
greater: giants within our own
frame.

If the place that you 're trying to get to
isn't where you've always been, but
instead a romantic, candlelit dinner
