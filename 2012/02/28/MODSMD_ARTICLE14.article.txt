# Changing the ASSU for the better
## 
### MICHAEL CRUZ'12 ASSU President ALEX KINDEL' 14 ASSU Parliamentarian Co-Chairs, ASSU Governing Documents Commission 
The ASSU Constitution and
the bylaws governing the
Association's legislative
bodies affect the lives of every
Stanford student. They underpin
the structures and mechanisms of
our student government, provid
ing the capacity for the ASSU to
work toward improving the expe
rience of the student body. The
governing documents also serve
to provide a framework for ASSU
officials, ensuring some measure
of consistency and preserving any
trace of institutional memory.
In recent years, it has become
more and more apparent that the
existing set of governing docu
ments is inadequate for today's
ASSU. The length of the constitu
tion and the bylaws makes it diffi
cult to develop a comprehensive
understanding of them, as well as
allowing for a dizzying host of in
terpretations to proliferate. Many
crucial elements of these docu
ments are vague or unclear, lead
ing to debates about where the ac
tual limits are on ASSU actions.
Different parts of the governing
documents often conflict; there are
even parts of the constitution that
directly contradict one another.
Under these circumstances,
the ASSU Executive formed the
Governing Documents Commis
sion, tasked with rewriting the
ASSU Constitution and bylaws to
help them better fulfill their in
tended purpose. The Commission
aimed for brevity, clarity and effi
ciency, replacing the confusing
thicket of the present constitution
with a document that is clear and

easy to understand. Many mem
bers of the Association con
tributed their time and energy to
this important project, with input
heard from many different groups
across campus.
However, the work of the GDC
cannot be complete without input
from the student body at large. The
ASSU Constitution is designed to
serve the interests of the students,
and a new constitution requires
feedback from those who would
be affected by the rule changes
that will come into force. From stu
dent group funding to election of
ASSU officials, everything the
ASSU does has been subject to re
view, and it is critical that the Com
mission receives student input dur
ing this important process.
The full text of the new ASSU
Constitution and executive report
is available at http://dft.ba/-IVyT.
The Commission will be accepting
public comment until March 6, at
which time we will revise the doc
uments in accordance with the
feedback we receive. Every Stan
ford student has a stake in the
ASSU, and a stake in what it will
become in the future. Without a
robust dialogue between the
GDC and the student body, the
new set of governing documents
will likely function just as poorly
as the originals.
