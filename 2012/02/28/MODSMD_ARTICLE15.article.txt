# FROM FARM TO FORK
## Wondering about wonder foods 
### Jenny Rempel 
When my nose is running,
my rational inner scien
tist is drowned out by
coughing, and I start to wonder
about wonder foods. I've had a
head cold all week, which means
I've been craving one food: my
dad's chicken noodle soup. Aca
demics and old wives have both
contemplated the health benefits
of the dish for years. As it turns
out, scientists are still pretty divid
ed over whether this food folk
medicine is actually effective at re
ducing inflammation and mitigat
ing the symptoms of the common
cold.
The concept of wonder foods is
not restricted to the bedridden,
though. Much of U.S. society ac
cepts the notion that certain foods
have the power to help you lose
weight, bulk up muscle, ward off
cancer or slow the effects of aging.
Whatever your ailment or desire,
there seems to be a wonder food to
help.
Consider acai berries, kelp and
garlic, among others. To be sure,
these foods have definite health
benefits. Acai berries and blueber
ries are both loaded with antioxi
dants, which are thought to delay
aging and improve memory by
combating cellular free radicals.
Garlic has compounds containing
sulfur that can help regulate blood
pressure and improve aspects of
the cardiovascular system. Kelp
and other sea vegetables provide a
broad range of nutrients, including
iodine and vitamin K, and they
serve as an important source of
bio-available iron and calcium.
But there's something fishy about
changing my diet to start guzzling
down handfuls of seaweed because

of its purported health benefits.
To understand our fixation on
wonder foods and the risks of
this mindset it's useful to think
back to the beginnings of this in
fatuation. John Swartzberg, a pro
fessor of public health at the Uni
versity of California, Berkeley, be
lieves our obsession with food ad
ditives originated in the now-infa
mous story of scurvy in the British
Navy. The realization that limes
and other citrus could prevent the
vitamin C deficiency initiated a
newfound faith in dietary supple
ments. Perhaps isolated ingredi
ents could prevent diseases. From
these initial realizations about un
dernutrition and dietary deficien
cies, nutritionists then moved
onto the concept of overnutrition.
This led to the low-fat era and the
vilification of fast foods and cho
lesterol. More recently, nutrition
studies have investigated what
nutrients to avoid and, finally,
which to include.
To some extent, this obsession
with certain wonder foods and nu
trients has its benefits. Sailors are
no longer suffering from scurvy,
and we've largely eliminated dis
eases associated with vitamin and
nutrient deficiencies in the devel
oped world. But this reductionist
approach to eating can blind us of
the need for a balanced diet.
It is useful to contemplate vari
ous foods' nutritional values and
to understand the health implica
tions of our eating behaviors, but
focusing on one wonder food as a
magical panacea can be danger
ous. I'm pretty sure eating a diet
consisting solely of seaweed or
even seaweed, chocolate and acai
berries would not keep my

body in balance for very long.
Even focusing on less-flashy
wonder foods like kale can be dam
aging. Kale is loaded with nutrients
and well deserving of its place at
the top of the Aggregate Nutrient
Density Index. However, eating a
handful of kale will not, in fact,
counter the negative effects of, say,
eating an entire cheesecake by
yourself, which one Daily staffer
suggested to me.
I'm as big a fan of kale and leafy
greens as any young foodie, but I re
alize that kale is much better when
treated as a single component of a
more holistic, integrated diet. It
tastes better, too. Kale is delicious in
white bean stews, stir-fried with
onions and mushrooms or smoth
ered in lemon juice and tossed as a
salad.
So maybe we should not focus
our attention on wonder foods, but
instead return to a more balanced,
culturally appropriate diet. This
week, that might mean avoiding
the blueberries and making myself
a steaming bowl of vegetarian noo
dle soup. If wonder foods by them
selves can't save me, research sug
gests the combination of vegeta
bles in chicken noodle might at
least make me feel psychosomati
cally better.

cepts the notion that certain foods
have the power to help you lose
weight, bulk up muscle, ward off
cancer or slow the effects of aging.
Whatever your ailment or desire,
there seems to be a wonder food to
help.
Consider acai berries, kelp and
garlic, among others. To be sure,
these foods have definite health
benefits. Acai berries and blueber
ries are both loaded with antioxi
dants, which are thought to delay
aging and improve memory by
combating cellular free radicals.
Garlic has compounds containing
sulfur that can help regulate blood
pressure and improve aspects of
the cardiovascular system. Kelp
and other sea vegetables provide a
broad range of nutrients, including
iodine and vitamin K, and they
serve as an important source of
bio-available iron and calcium.
But there's something fishy about
changing my diet to start guzzling
down handfuls of seaweed because

of its purported health benefits.
To understand our fixation on
wonder foods and the risks of
this mindset it's useful to think
back to the beginnings of this in
fatuation. John Swartzberg, a pro
fessor of public health at the Uni
versity of California, Berkeley, be
lieves our obsession with food ad
ditives originated in the now-infa
mous story of scurvy in the British
Navy. The realization that limes
and other citrus could prevent the
vitamin C deficiency initiated a
newfound faith in dietary supple
ments. Perhaps isolated ingredi
ents could prevent diseases. From
these initial realizations about un
dernutrition and dietary deficien
cies, nutritionists then moved
onto the concept of overnutrition.
This led to the low-fat era and the
vilification of fast foods and cho
lesterol. More recently, nutrition
studies have investigated what
nutrients to avoid and, finally,
which to include.
To some extent, this obsession
with certain wonder foods and nu
trients has its benefits. Sailors are
no longer suffering from scurvy,
and we've largely eliminated dis
eases associated with vitamin and
nutrient deficiencies in the devel
oped world. But this reductionist
approach to eating can blind us of
the need for a balanced diet.
It is useful to contemplate vari
ous foods' nutritional values and
to understand the health implica
tions of our eating behaviors, but
focusing on one wonder food as a
magical panacea can be danger
ous. I'm pretty sure eating a diet
consisting solely of seaweed or
even seaweed, chocolate and acai
berries would not keep my

body in balance for very long.
Even focusing on less-flashy
wonder foods like kale can be dam
aging. Kale is loaded with nutrients
and well deserving of its place at
the top of the Aggregate Nutrient
Density Index. However, eating a
handful of kale will not, in fact,
counter the negative effects of, say,
eating an entire cheesecake by
yourself, which one Daily staffer
suggested to me.
I'm as big a fan of kale and leafy
greens as any young foodie, but I re
alize that kale is much better when
treated as a single component of a
more holistic, integrated diet. It
tastes better, too. Kale is delicious in
white bean stews, stir-fried with
onions and mushrooms or smoth
ered in lemon juice and tossed as a
salad.
So maybe we should not focus
our attention on wonder foods, but
instead return to a more balanced,
culturally appropriate diet. This
week, that might mean avoiding
the blueberries and making myself
a steaming bowl of vegetarian noo
dle soup. If wonder foods by them
selves can't save me, research sug
gests the combination of vegeta
bles in chicken noodle might at
least make me feel psychosomati
cally better.
