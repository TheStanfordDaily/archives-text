## On the brink of Premier 
### Tom Taylor 
Last weekend, the world
seemed to be on the verge
of crashing down around
me. Between handing in
my midterm before time
was up because I just couldn't an
swer any more questions and feel
ing a bit crushed under the weight of
rapid-fire assignments, I discovered
that Wolverhampton Wanderers
had started sniffing around my soc
cer club, Reading FC, in search of a
replacement manager.
After selling our best player and
starting the season off on the wrong
foot, the Royals were languishing in
second-to-last place in the English
Championship, 12 points from the
top spot and eight from having any
chance of getting promoted. It almost
seemed like a relief coming back to
the United States and knowing I
wouldn't be subjected to watching
our relegation to League 1.
But then, bit by bit, things started
clicking. Having rescued the club
from relegation in his first half-season
in 2010 and subsequently taking it to
the brink of a Premiership return last
year, manager Brian McDermott
began to work his magic yet again.
And just as January's player transfer
window was threatening to tempt
more of the talent away, a Russian bil
lionaire appeared with the promise of
investment that could convert the
club from small fry to big fish.
Even the potential injection of
funds a move that often destabi
lizes a team instead of launching it on
the path to success â€”was handled in
away that most fans couldn't com
plain about, with the emphasis put on
a gradual transition to new owner
ship. Reading are now third, just five
points from the top, with the best re
cent form of any team. If they win out,
they are guaranteed to return to the
top flight of English soccer.
However, typical of a lower
league soccer fan, it doesn't take
much to convert the optimism and
elation at your club's success to
dread. The press is generally too ab
sorbed in the goings-on up at the top
table to pay detailed attention to
smaller clubs. As a result, these
teams often operate under the
radar. Even within the Champi
onship, the major stories at the mo
ment are centered on either the
perennial financial problems in soc
cer or just the success of the top two
clubs. This information vacuum can
often be frustrating for fans, but it
also provides some sort of protec
tion. When bigger, richer clubs start
exploring the lower leagues, you
know you are in trouble.
There isn't a player or manager
in the lower divisions who doesn't
want to be in the Premier League,
have their games broadcast live
around the globe, play in front of
huge crowds in giant stadiums and
fight for some of the biggest tro
phies in the world of sports. And
chances to make that leap don't
