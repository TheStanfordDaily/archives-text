# JUST A BIT OUTSIDE
## NO. 1 CARD FALLS TO USC 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
Playing as the No. 1 ranked
team in the country for the first
time since its national champi
onship season in 2010, the Stan
ford men's volleyball team split
its matches over the weekend,
defeating No. 10 Pepperdine 25-
21, 24-26, 25-19, 25-18 before
being outlasted by No. 6 USC 21 -
25,25-18,25-27,25-16,15-13. As a
result of the loss to USC, Stan
ford failed to move into first
place in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation and will likely
relinquish its newly minted status
as the top team in the country.

"[Head coach John] Kosty told
us after we earned the No. 1 rank
ing that we are going to have to be
a lot better come playoff time than
we are now in order to have a suc
cessful playoffs. I think this week
end showed that," sophomore out
side hitter Brian Cook said. "Also,
this weekend showed just how
competitive our league is and how
we can't take any games off."
The matches were the first at
home for the Cardinal (12-3, 9-2
MPSF) since Jan. 14, opening a
stretch that will see Stanford play
nine of its final 11 matches of the
season at home.
Fittingly, the first home match
in six weeks for Stanford featured
some fireworks, as both the Cardi
nal and Pepperdine (8-6, 6-5)
came out swinging in the first set.
The set saw just three combined
errors, with Stanford's .692 hitting
percentage trumping Pepper
dine's .524 mark. Sophomore
Steven Irvin, who finished the
match as one of four Cardinal
players with double-digit kills, was
the hot hand, tallying six kills in the
first set alone.
Pepperdine was able to win a
tight second set 26-24, on the
strength of a much-improved de
fensive effort. After the Stanford
attack dominated the first set, the
Cardinal was held to a .217 hitting
percentage in the second. Tied at

24, the Pepperdine defense
proved crucial in the deciding
points, using consecutive blocks
on Irvin by senior Matt Pollock
and freshman Matt West to even
the match at 1-1.
Taking a page from Pepper
dine's book, the Cardinal seized
control of the match defensively
behind the strength of seniors Gus
Ellis and Erik Shoji. Ellis finished
with nine blocks in the match, in
cluding two solo efforts, while
Shoji's six digs proved crucial in
stifling the Pepperdine attack.
Stanford closed out each of the
final two sets in style, finishing off
the Waves on kills by sophomore
Eric Mochalski and seldom-used
redshirt freshman Daniel Tublin.
For the match, senior Brad Law
son led all hitters with 14 kills.
Cook added 13, while Irvin and
Mochalski each contributed 10.
Senior setter Evan Barry finished
with 47 assists.
Saturday's match against No. 6
USC (9-4, 7-4) proved to be a
thriller and a heartbreaker
for the Cardinal and its fans. A
back-and-forth affair that saw the
Cardinal go up two games to one,
and later 12-11 in the fifth set, was
all for naught, as the Trojans were
able to pull off the victory thanks
to a sparkling performance from
senior All-American Tony Ciarel
li. Ciarelli finished with 28 kills, 11
digs and the kill on the final point
to dash Stanford's hopes of pro
longing the match and, most im
portantly, seizing control of the
MPSF standings. The perform
ance by Ciarelli offset yet another
impressive outing by Lawson, who
finished with 24 kills.
Stanford found success in the
first set, turning an 11-11 score into
a 19-13 lead thanks to some sloppy
play by USC and a pesky defense
that forced four attack errors dur
ing the 8-2 run. Lawson proved
crucial down the stretch, register
ing three kills to help hold off the
Trojans.
Stanford again jumped out to a
lead in the second set, taking a 12-
9 advantage thanks in large part to
a series of attack errors by the Tro
jans. USC was able to kick it into
gear however, winning five
straight points to take a 14-12 lead,
which they would not relinquish

for the rest of the set. USC's de
fense remained strong throughout
the set, as they held Stanford to a
lowly .115 hitting percentage,
Stanford regained its offensive
footing in the third thanks to a
monstrous 11-kill performance by
Lawson, including the final point

of the set to give Stanford a 2-1 ad
vantage.
The Cardinal was not able to
maintain this success in the fourth,
as it was held to a .040 hitting per
centage for the set, which fittingly

Leading 12-11 in the fifth, Stan
ford was unable to close out USC.
A pair of crucial errors by Lawson
and Irvin set up what seemed to be

an inevitable conclusion for USC: a
match-clinching kill by Ciarelli.
Cook said that even though the
close loss was a crushing result to
deal with, it was a good reminder
that the team still can get better,
even with a No. 1 ranking next to its
name.
"There are always skills we can
get better at individually, and the
focus this week in practice is to be
as competitive as we can to simu

late and get better at those close
game situations," he said. "Ulti
mately, though, we know we can

done it in the past, and that's what's
important."

A pair of crucial errors by Lawson
and Irvin set up what seemed to be

an inevitable conclusion for USC: a
match-clinching kill by Ciarelli.
Cook said that even though the
close loss was a crushing result to
deal with, it was a good reminder
that the team still can get better,
even with a No. 1 ranking next to its
name.
"There are always skills we can
get better at individually, and the
focus this week in practice is to be
as competitive as we can to simu

late and get better at those close
game situations," he said. "Ulti
mately, though, we know we can
win close games because we have
done it in the past, and that's what's
important."

Playing as the No. 1 ranked
team in the country for the first
time since its national champi
onship season in 2010, the Stan
ford men's volleyball team split
its matches over the weekend,
defeating No. 10 Pepperdine 25-
21, 24-26, 25-19, 25-18 before
being outlasted by No. 6 USC 21 -
25,25-18,25-27,25-16,15-13. As a
result of the loss to USC, Stan
ford failed to move into first
place in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation and will likely
relinquish its newly minted status
as the top team in the country.

"[Head coach John] Kosty told
us after we earned the No. 1 rank
ing that we are going to have to be
a lot better come playoff time than
we are now in order to have a suc
cessful playoffs. I think this week
end showed that," sophomore out
side hitter Brian Cook said. "Also,
this weekend showed just how
competitive our league is and how
we can't take any games off."
The matches were the first at
home for the Cardinal (12-3, 9-2
MPSF) since Jan. 14, opening a
stretch that will see Stanford play
nine of its final 11 matches of the
season at home.
Fittingly, the first home match
in six weeks for Stanford featured
some fireworks, as both the Cardi
nal and Pepperdine (8-6, 6-5)
came out swinging in the first set.
The set saw just three combined
errors, with Stanford's .692 hitting
percentage trumping Pepper
dine's .524 mark. Sophomore
Steven Irvin, who finished the
match as one of four Cardinal
players with double-digit kills, was
the hot hand, tallying six kills in the
first set alone.
Pepperdine was able to win a
tight second set 26-24, on the
strength of a much-improved de
fensive effort. After the Stanford
attack dominated the first set, the
Cardinal was held to a .217 hitting
percentage in the second. Tied at

24, the Pepperdine defense
proved crucial in the deciding
points, using consecutive blocks
on Irvin by senior Matt Pollock
and freshman Matt West to even
the match at 1-1.
Taking a page from Pepper
dine's book, the Cardinal seized
control of the match defensively
behind the strength of seniors Gus
Ellis and Erik Shoji. Ellis finished
with nine blocks in the match, in
cluding two solo efforts, while
Shoji's six digs proved crucial in
stifling the Pepperdine attack.
Stanford closed out each of the
final two sets in style, finishing off
the Waves on kills by sophomore
Eric Mochalski and seldom-used
redshirt freshman Daniel Tublin.
For the match, senior Brad Law
son led all hitters with 14 kills.
Cook added 13, while Irvin and
Mochalski each contributed 10.
Senior setter Evan Barry finished
with 47 assists.
Saturday's match against No. 6
USC (9-4, 7-4) proved to be a
thriller and a heartbreaker
for the Cardinal and its fans. A
back-and-forth affair that saw the
Cardinal go up two games to one,
and later 12-11 in the fifth set, was
all for naught, as the Trojans were
able to pull off the victory thanks
to a sparkling performance from
senior All-American Tony Ciarel
li. Ciarelli finished with 28 kills, 11
digs and the kill on the final point
to dash Stanford's hopes of pro
longing the match and, most im
portantly, seizing control of the
MPSF standings. The perform
ance by Ciarelli offset yet another
impressive outing by Lawson, who
finished with 24 kills.
Stanford found success in the
first set, turning an 11-11 score into
a 19-13 lead thanks to some sloppy
play by USC and a pesky defense
that forced four attack errors dur
ing the 8-2 run. Lawson proved
crucial down the stretch, register
ing three kills to help hold off the
Trojans.
Stanford again jumped out to a
lead in the second set, taking a 12-
9 advantage thanks in large part to
a series of attack errors by the Tro
jans. USC was able to kick it into
gear however, winning five
straight points to take a 14-12 lead,
which they would not relinquish

for the rest of the set. USC's de
fense remained strong throughout
the set, as they held Stanford to a
lowly .115 hitting percentage,
Stanford regained its offensive
footing in the third thanks to a
monstrous 11-kill performance by
Lawson, including the final point

of the set to give Stanford a 2-1 ad
vantage.
The Cardinal was not able to
maintain this success in the fourth,
as it was held to a .040 hitting per
centage for the set, which fittingly
