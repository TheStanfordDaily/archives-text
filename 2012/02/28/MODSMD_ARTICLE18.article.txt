## Lacrosse beats James Madison, records first win of season 
### â€“ Zach Zimmerman 
It wasn't convincing, but the Stanford women's
lacrosse team managed to complete a thrilling
come-from-behind victory, beating James Madison
14-13 at Cagan Stadium in a matchup of top-10
foes.
The No. 6 Cardinal (1-3) won its first game of
the season behind five goals and three assists from
senior Emilie Boeri, who was later named Wom
ensLax.com player of the week. However, not even
a stunning performance by Boeri could hold off
No. 9 James Madison (1-1) for most of the day, as
the Dukes led for the vast majority of the affair.
Stanford entered halftime trailing by five goals
after JMU's Ariel Lane tallied three first-half
scores. The Cardinal came roaring back after the
break, however, as Boeri scored four of her five

goals in a span of about 14 minutes.
It was a dominant second-half showing by the
Cardinal, although the squad surrendered the lead
with just 2:50 left in the match. Down one at 12-13,
Stanford was rescued by a game-tying goal by
Boeri at 0:32. The senior's free position shot set up
a game-winner by sophomore Anna Kim with just
nine seconds remaining.
The win finally reversed the losing trend that
plagued the Cardinal's early-season play. The
young Stanford team faltered in its first three
matches against ranked competition, but with a
notch in the victory column the Cardinal will now
look to capitalize on its positive momentum head
ing into this weekend's festivities.
The Cardinal hosts No. 17 Vanderbilt at Cagan
Stadium this Saturday at 1 p.m.
