# TWICE IS NICE IN BOISE
## 
### PALANI ESWARAN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's wrestling team left
Sunday's Pac-12 Championships in Boise
with two champions: redshirt senior No. 1
Nick Amuchastegui at 174 pounds and junior
No. 5 Ryan Mango at 125 pounds. The Cardi
nal also had one other wrestler earn an auto
matic bid to the NCAA tournament in
March, as redshirt junior Spence Patrick
placed second at 184 pounds and secured a
spot in the national tournament.
In addition to the two first-place perform
ances, the Cardinal had three wrestlers finish
second and two wrestlers finish third. The
team placed third, behind Boise State and
Oregon State, which won the Pac-12 regular
season title and the Pac-12 tournament, re
spectively.
Mango looked very impressive on Sunday.
In his first match of the day, the junior wres
tled Dalton Miller of Arizona State and
pinned him in the third period. In the champi
onship match, Mango dominated Oregon
State's Pat Rollins, winning by a 14-3 major
decision. He now has a team-leading 25 wins
and looks to be in good shape heading into
NCAAs. He finished sixth in the nation last
year and is searching for a better finish this
March.
Amuchastegui also went 2-0 on Sunday,
winning two close matches. In his first contest,
he defeated Boise State's Scotty Bacon 10-5.
In the championship, he edged out Cal Poly's
Ryan Desßoches 5-4. The top-ranked
wrestler hasn't had too many close matches

this year most of his wins have been by pin,
technical fall or major decision. In fact, the
last time Amuchastegui and Desßoches
wrestled, Amuchastegui dominated the
match and won by major decision. But these
close wins are good preparation for what
Amuchastegui will be facing in a few weeks.
He finished second in the NCAA tournament

last year, and if he hopes to take home the
title in his final season, he will have to win a
few nail-biters.
Patrick's first match of the day was against
Kevin Radford of Arizona State. In the Car
dinal's final dual of the season, Radford de-

feated Patrick 5-3, so he came
into the tournament with the
higher seed. Patrick needed to
win the match in order to receive
an automatic berth into the
NCAA tournament. He won the
match 3-2 but went on to lose in
the finals to Boise State's Jacob
Swartz by a score of 5-1.
Despite the loss, it was still an
extremely successful day for
Patrick. Time and time again he
has come up with key wins and on
Sunday he proved how valuable
he is to the squad, despite often
performing under the radar.
Other wrestlers with a chance
at making the NCAA tourna

ment are redshirt junior Timmy
Boone at 149 pounds, sophomore
Garrett Schaner at 157 pounds,
redshirt sophomore Bret Baum
bach at 165 pounds, sophomore
Alan Yen at 197 pounds and
sophomore Dan Scherer at
heavyweight. Boone and Baum
bach both took second place,
Schaner and Scherer took third
and Yen placed fourth. Each of
them just missed an automatic
berth in the NCAA tournament.
However, each can still get an at
large bid. Forty at-large qualifiers
will be chosen by the NCAA Di
vision I wrestling committee on
March 7.
The NCAA tournament will
take place in St. Louis, Mo., from
March 15-17.
