## Researchers crack video Captcha security system 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Researchers at the Stanford Security Tab an
nounced last week that they have developed a means
of consistently cracking NuCaptcha's video Captcha
identity verification system.
Video Captcha streams display slightly distorted
letters in motion, which website programmers can
then embed and ask users to type out while visiting a
site to prove that the user is a human and not an auto
mated program, or 'bot.' The researchers were able to
devise a method by which a bot also frequently
used to create automated email accounts for spam
ming successfully passed the Captcha security test
for over 90 percent of challenges faced.
"How fun would it be to interact with [a] robot on
Twitter or Facebook?" former Security Lab re
searcher Elie Bursztein wrote in an email to The Daily.
Bursztein was a post-doctoral research fellow in the
lab while the video Captcha research took place.
The Security Lab team used a combination of mo
tion tracking, image analysis and machine-learning al
gorithms to crack the video Captcha system. Accord
ing to a blog post that Bursztein wrote chronicling the
team's efforts, motion tracking allowed the team to
isolate frames of the video Captcha in order to track
and analyze the words displayed.
Image analysis was used to determine which ob
jects in the frame were the most interesting, focusing
on objects that fit the expected width-height ratio for
Captcha text and displayed more edges or corners

than other objects in the frame (due
to the Captcha letters' independent
rotation). The objects were then
cross-referenced with other inter
esting objects across numerous
frames, leaving the computer with
many different iterations of the
same Captcha.
The letters in the Captcha can be
deciphered in one of three ways: by
trivial separation if a frame exists
with no crossover, by a computer
ized "voting decision" to determine
the most probable set of letters or by
using motion tracking to analyze
which points on the Captcha object
move together through separate
frames, which can then be mapped
out into the individual letters.
Matthieu Martin, a researcher at
the Security Lab, wrote in an email

to The Daily that he added video el
ements into Decaptcha, the soft
ware that the lab had previously
used to break simple image and
audio Captchas, in order to crack
video Captchas.
In his blog post, Bursztein em
phasized that cracking a video
Captcha was more difficult than
cracking a simple image Captcha
due to the incorporation of motion
tracking. He noted, however, that
once the motion tracking was in
place the program's accuracy
was higher due to being able to ref
erence multiple iterations of the
same Captcha.
"No single Captcha will defend
against every possible attack," Nu-
Captcha, the software development
company that created both the sim
ple image Captcha and the video
Captcha authentication systems,
wrote in a statement responding to
the research team's blog post. "Our
strategy is to develop a collection of
responses and, as appropriate, to de

ploy them to individual users in
stead of presenting a single rigid de
fense,"
In the statement, NuCaptcha
said that the research had suggest
ed ways of improving Captcha sys
tems, including altering the appear
ance of each letter in adjacent
frames of the Captcha and varying
the length of a code string that lies
behind the Captcha's appearance
in the video stream. The Stanford
team offered their research to Nu-
Captcha several weeks in advance
of public disclosure.
"In my opinion . . . their
biggest flaw was to use the same
kind of protection image Captchas
use (lines, distortion, etc.)," Martin
wrote. "They should concentrate
on video based protections, but I'm
pretty sure [Burzstein] had this dis
cussion with Nucaptcha's team al
ready."
