## Researchers crack video Captcha security system 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Researchers at the Stanford Security Tab an
nounced last week that they have developed a means
of consistently cracking NuCaptcha's video Captcha
identity verification system.
Video Captcha streams display slightly distorted
letters in motion, which website programmers can
then embed and ask users to type out while visiting a
site to prove that the user is a human and not an auto
mated program, or 'bot.' The researchers were able to
devise a method by which a bot also frequently
used to create automated email accounts for spam
ming successfully passed the Captcha security test
for over 90 percent of challenges faced.
"How fun would it be to interact with [a] robot on
Twitter or Facebook?" former Security Lab re
searcher Elie Bursztein wrote in an email to The Daily.
Bursztein was a post-doctoral research fellow in the
lab while the video Captcha research took place.
The Security Lab team used a combination of mo
tion tracking, image analysis and machine-learning al
gorithms to crack the video Captcha system. Accord
ing to a blog post that Bursztein wrote chronicling the
team's efforts, motion tracking allowed the team to
isolate frames of the video Captcha in order to track
and analyze the words displayed.
Image analysis was used to determine which ob
jects in the frame were the most interesting, focusing
on objects that fit the expected width-height ratio for
Captcha text and displayed more edges or corners
