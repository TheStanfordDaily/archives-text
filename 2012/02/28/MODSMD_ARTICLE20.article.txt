# MOSBACHER MINUTE
## Baseball off to hot start in '12 POTENT OFFENSE KEYS NO. 2 SQUAD 
### JACK MOSBACHER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of
the Stanford baseball team from
2008 to 2011. Each week, hell take
a look at the Cardinal's ups and
downs on its road to the College
World Series.
In case you've been away on
business on the planet Mars the
last two weeks, you've realized
one thing: the Stanford baseball
team can straight-up play.
After back-to-back weekend
sweeps, some Stanford baseball
fans are already making flight
arrangements for Omaha. The
early dominance has pushed Stan
ford to a No. 1 ranking in some
polls and has definitely bolstered
its early hopes of making a run to
the College World Series this July.
But let's all temper that early
enthusiasm just a little bit.
The good news is that Stanford
baseball has started the season 7-
0 and logged consecutive and con
vincing sweeps of Vanderbilt and
Texas. The bad news: neither of
these opponents deserved the
lofty rankings they brought with
them to Palo Alto. Vanderbilt,
ranked No. 12 entering its season
opener against Stanford, lost a
record 12 players to the MLB
Draft last June and barely resem
bled the squad that took two-of
three from the Cardinal during
their series in Nashville last year.
Meanwhile, I would be shocked if
the weak-hitting No. 7 Texas team
that trotted out onto Sunken Dia
mond this past weekend is ranked
in the top 20 at season's end.
With that said, there is no
downplaying how impressive this
Stanford baseball team has been
over the first two weeks of the
year. Sweeping anybody in col
lege baseball is a feat. It's an even

greater feat to sweep two major
name-brand teams like Vander
bilt and Texas. But the most
patently absurd part is that Stan
ford didn't just sweep these

teams; it flat-out destroyed them.
The Cardinal has outscored its op
ponents 72-25 in its first seven
games, including an 18-5 win and a
15-1 win. For comparison's sake,
that's like winning a basketball
game by a score 0f... 72-25.
As a former Stanford baseball
player, the most satisfying part of
this early-season dominance is
undoubtedly the despair this
sweep caused Augie Garrido,
Texas' legendary but polarizing
head coach. Having won more
games than any other coach in
college baseball history, Garrido
is known around the college base
ball world as a passionate, intense
competitor with an infamous
mean streak. (If you don't believe
me, check out the You Tube sensa
tion "Augie Garrido Flips Out."
Fair warning: incredibly explicit
content.)
Even the biggest Texas hater
can't help but feel a bit badly for
the poor Longhorn players when
thinking about the expletive-rid
den tirade they undoubtedly re
ceived on the bus ride to the airport
after Sunday's 15-1 shellacking.
However, with more than 60
games remaining between the
Cardinal and a national champi
onship, it's too early to crown
Stanford just yet. Like I said, the
aforementioned weekend oppo
nents came to the Farm massively
overrated. We still have a lot to
learn about the Cardinal, espe
cially when it is forced to respond
to eventual adversity.
Only time will tell if Stanford's
jump over talented Florida in the
USA Today Coaches' Poll was a
bit overzealous. Two weeks into
the 2012 season, however, the Car
dinal has sent a clear message to
the college baseball world: "We've
arrived, and we mean business."

Stephen Piscotty (pictured) and the rest of the Stanford offense has been
nothing short of dominant in the early going. The lineup has produced
72 runs in just seven games, including 13 in a single inning.
