### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Using a computer model of the hepatitis C disease,
Stanford researchers have shown that two new drugs
intended to target the virus are cost-effective for pa
tients suffering from advanced hepatitis C, despite
some significant side effects.
Hepatitis C, a virus that leads to swelling or inflam
mation of the liver, is now killing more Americans
than the HIV virus. The majority of the 3.2 million
people estimated to have chronic hepatitis C in the
United States are baby-boomer adults, according to a
Scientific American blog.
Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert, an assistant professor
of medicine, and his research team examined treat
ments that involved pegylated interferon alongside
ribavirin collectively deemed the standard two
drug therapy and compared it to a "triple therapy,"
with either boceprevir (trade name Victrelis) or
telaprevir (trade name Incivek) added to the stan
dard two-drug therapy.
Both drugs entered the commercial market in the
