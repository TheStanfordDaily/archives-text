## Stanford scientists model hepatitis C treatment options 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Using a computer model of the hepatitis C disease,
Stanford researchers have shown that two new drugs
intended to target the virus are cost-effective for pa
tients suffering from advanced hepatitis C, despite
some significant side effects.
Hepatitis C, a virus that leads to swelling or inflam
mation of the liver, is now killing more Americans
than the HIV virus. The majority of the 3.2 million
people estimated to have chronic hepatitis C in the
United States are baby-boomer adults, according to a
Scientific American blog.
Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert, an assistant professor
of medicine, and his research team examined treat
ments that involved pegylated interferon alongside
ribavirin collectively deemed the standard two
drug therapy and compared it to a "triple therapy,"
with either boceprevir (trade name Victrelis) or
telaprevir (trade name Incivek) added to the stan
dard two-drug therapy.
Both drugs entered the commercial market in the
summer of 2011, and though
they decrease the chance of chronic
hepatitis C both have severe side
effects.
The most common adverse drug
reactions to Incivek, as listed by the
Food and Drug Administration
(FDA),include rash,pruritus,anemia,
nausea, hemorrhoids and diarrhea.
Victrelis is associated with an addi
tional decrease in hemoglobin con
centrations, resulting in fatigue, ane
mia, nausea, headache and dysgeusia.
The research team, which includ
ed graduate students Shan Liu and
Lauren Cipriano M.S. 'll as well as
Professors of Medicine Mark
Holodniy and Douglas K. Owens,
designed a model to comparatively
examine the advantages and disad
vantages of three treatment strate
gies: giving all hepatitis C patients
the standard treatment, giving all of
them a triple therapy and giving
triple therapy only to the patients
less likely to respond to standard
treatments.

"The computer model we devel
oped includes the health risks, quali
ty of life changes and costs for pa
tients who have genotype 1 chronic
hepatitis C infection as well as the ef
fectiveness, costs, side effects [and]
quality-of-life changes of undergo
ing various treatments for chronic
hepatitis C," Goldhaber-Fiebert
said. "An expensive treatment, even
with some side effects, may be bene
ficial overall if it is more effective,
thereby prolonging life, improving
quality and/or averting costs com
pared to not undergoing treatment."
Statistical and simulation analy
sis showed that the new triple thera
pies were cost-effective for chronic
hepatitis C patients with advanced
liver disease. For patients with a
mild case of the disease, the model's
findings advised determining their
IL-288 genotype associated
with gauging whether the standard
two-drug treatment will be effective
before deciding on treatment.
"Protease inhibitors increase the
effectiveness of standard therapy,
but they are costly," the team's study
states. "A genetic assay may identify
patients most likely to benefit from
this treatment advance."
The study links how imminent

the threat of severe disease is with
justifying the costs and risks of the
"triple therapy."
"If the protease inhibitor costs
$l,lOO per week, universal triple
therapy costs $102,600 per quality
adjusted life-year (QALY) for mild
fibrosis or $51,500 per QALY for
advanced fibrosis compared with
IL-288-guided triple therapy and
$70,100 per QALY (mild fibrosis)
and $36,300 per QALY (advanced
fibrosis) compared with standard
therapy," the study states.
Despite the costs, universal
triple therapy reduced the lifetime
risk for liver carcinoma by 38 per
cent in cases of mild fibrosis and 28
percent in incidents of advanced fi
brosis, increasing the quality-adjust
ed life expectancy by three percent
and eight percent, respectively
compared with standard therapy
the study showed.
The study concluded that, "uni
versal triple therapy and IL-288
guided triple therapy are cost-effec
tive when the least-expensive pro
tease inhibitor is used for patients
with advanced fibrosis."
