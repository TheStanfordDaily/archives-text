# Faculty back IHUM successor
## Warm reception for Thinking Matters 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Faculty have largely extended a
warm welcome to Thinking Matters, the
freshman requirement proposed as a
replacement to the Introduction to the
Humanities (IHUM) program by the
recent Study on Undergraduate Educa
tion at Stanford (SUES) report. The
shift may occur as early as fall 2012.
"The shift will allow us to expand
this specific form of freshmen educa
tion," said Russell Berman, chair of the
IHUM program. Berman will oversee
the transition to the Thinking Matters
requirement if the Faculty Senate votes
in favor of the SUES committee's rec

ommendations in its March 8 meeting.
"These are courses designed to
move students from high school think
ing to college thinking," Berman added.
"This has always been an implicit goal
of IHUM, but now we 'll be undertaking
this specific freshmen pedagogy across
the University."
The transition to Thinking Matters
may also serve practical scheduling pur
poses. Freshmen will be required to
take one quarter rather than the
three quarters currently mandated by
the IHUM program of a Thinking
Matters class, allowing them greater
flexibility as they design their first-year
course load.
"The growth of unit-intensive ma

jors that is, majors that have explicit,
but more importantly, implicitly high
unit-level requirements . . . has just
eroded student flexibility," Berman
said. "The University has not addressed
this problem, and a result is a cutting
back of General Education Require-


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
merits (GERs) in order to make
room for high levels of unit de
mand in majors."
Lanier Anderson, chair of the
SUES subcommittee on the
freshman year, agreed that fresh
men face enormous pressure to
balance exploration with the ful
fillment of important prerequi
sites. The SUES report noted that
many freshmen constrained
by major prerequisites, three
quarters of IHUM and a Program
in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR)
course have "zero space for
exploration."
"Students really are trying to
hold open for themselves two or
three possible pathways, and in
order to keep all those pathways
open while they explore, they
have to do the prerequisites for
all those things," Anderson said.
"Freshmen get here, and we

tell them it's a liberal education .
.. You're supposed to explore,
and they feel they have zero de
grees of freedom," Anderson
added.
In accordance with the SUES
report's recommendations,
Thinking Matters courses would
be integrated into the Universi
ty's breadth requirements in
order to further alleviate the
issue of constrained scheduling.
Students will thus be able to ex
plore a potential major or fulfill a
GER requirement while also
completing the mandatory fresh
man curriculum.
"If you can't define a core of
knowledge that you're prepared
to say everyone should en
counter, then it's nearly impossi
ble to maintain a full-year core
requirement, which IHUM was,"
Berman said. "But this is the dis
tinctiveness of Stanford, that
we're prepared to try new things,
which is good."
While arguing that the re
duced obligations posed by
Thinking Matters courses will
better conform to student needs,
Berman also expressed some
preliminary concerns about the
impact of expanded academic
freedom on course selection.
"I worry a little bit that in our
effort to give students maximum
choice, and in our reluctance to
find core requirements, we may
be reaching the point where
there's too much choice that can
produce a kind of alienation," he
said.
Both Anderson and Berman
highlighted the ability of the
Thinking Matters program to
thrive beyond the humanities
sector of the University. James
Campbell, co-chair of the SUES
committee, told a Feb. 23 Faculty
Senate meeting that currently
planned Thinking Matters pro
gramming includes classes in
areas such as medicine and law, as
well as the humanities.
Noting that faculty members
have expressed concern about
the lack of science and technical
education offered to students

majoring in other areas, Ander
son expressed optimism that the
Thinking Matters program would
remedy the issue.
"You're taking expert knowl
edge and bringing it out to a gen
erally educated audience who
might never take another class in
this field," Anderson said.
"You're trying to show them
what a particular way of thinking
has to offer people in general
about a particular type of ques
tion."
History professor Jack
Rakove, whose "Can the People
Rule?" IHUM course is slotted to
continue as a Thinking Matters
course, said that the opening of
the freshman program to disci
plines beyond the humanities has
enormous teaching potential.
"The Thinking Matters frame
work makes it easier," Rakove
said. "A university like Stanford,
this is who we are, this is what we
do. I don't think you want to im
pose constraints on how scholars
teach . . . Even in a freshman
level class, the closer we are to
how teachers think, the more ef
fective the class will be,"
However, the ultimate impact
on the humanities at Stanford re
mains unclear.
"For some students, humani
ties exposure in the freshman
year will be less than in the pres
ent system," Anderson said. "I
myself don't think that's a bad
thing, because the way I think
about it for those students,
what the previous system was
doing was concentrating all of
their humanities-directed effort
in the freshmen year, after which
they left that behind and never
came back."
"One possible result will be
that freshmen will take less hu
manities courses," Berman said.
"Another possible result is that,
because the humanities aren't re
quired, students will take them
voluntarily in greater numbers.
Time will tell."

be integrated into the Universi
ty's breadth requirements in
order to further alleviate the
issue of constrained scheduling.
Students will thus be able to ex
plore a potential major or fulfill a
GER requirement while also
completing the mandatory fresh
man curriculum.
"If you can't define a core of
knowledge that you're prepared
to say everyone should en
counter, then it's nearly impossi
ble to maintain a full-year core
requirement, which IHUM was,"
Berman said. "But this is the dis
tinctiveness of Stanford, that
we're prepared to try new things,
which is good."
While arguing that the re
duced obligations posed by
Thinking Matters courses will
better conform to student needs,
Berman also expressed some
preliminary concerns about the
impact of expanded academic
freedom on course selection.
"I worry a little bit that in our
effort to give students maximum
choice, and in our reluctance to
find core requirements, we may
be reaching the point where
there's too much choice that can
produce a kind of alienation," he
said.
Both Anderson and Berman
highlighted the ability of the
Thinking Matters program to
thrive beyond the humanities
sector of the University. James
Campbell, co-chair of the SUES
committee, told a Feb. 23 Faculty
Senate meeting that currently
planned Thinking Matters pro
gramming includes classes in
areas such as medicine and law, as
well as the humanities.
Noting that faculty members
have expressed concern about
the lack of science and technical
education offered to students

majoring in other areas, Ander
son expressed optimism that the
Thinking Matters program would
remedy the issue.
"You're taking expert knowl
edge and bringing it out to a gen
erally educated audience who
might never take another class in
this field," Anderson said.
"You're trying to show them
what a particular way of thinking
has to offer people in general
about a particular type of ques
tion."
History professor Jack
Rakove, whose "Can the People
Rule?" IHUM course is slotted to
continue as a Thinking Matters
course, said that the opening of
the freshman program to disci
plines beyond the humanities has
enormous teaching potential.
"The Thinking Matters frame
work makes it easier," Rakove
said. "A university like Stanford,
this is who we are, this is what we
do. I don't think you want to im
pose constraints on how scholars
teach . . . Even in a freshman
level class, the closer we are to
how teachers think, the more ef
fective the class will be,"
However, the ultimate impact
on the humanities at Stanford re
mains unclear.
"For some students, humani
ties exposure in the freshman
year will be less than in the pres
ent system," Anderson said. "I
myself don't think that's a bad
thing, because the way I think
about it for those students,
what the previous system was
doing was concentrating all of
their humanities-directed effort
in the freshmen year, after which
they left that behind and never
came back."
"One possible result will be
that freshmen will take less hu
manities courses," Berman said.
"Another possible result is that,
because the humanities aren't re
quired, students will take them
voluntarily in greater numbers.
Time will tell."

Faculty have largely extended a
warm welcome to Thinking Matters, the
freshman requirement proposed as a
replacement to the Introduction to the
Humanities (IHUM) program by the
recent Study on Undergraduate Educa
tion at Stanford (SUES) report. The
shift may occur as early as fall 2012.
"The shift will allow us to expand
this specific form of freshmen educa
tion," said Russell Berman, chair of the
IHUM program. Berman will oversee
the transition to the Thinking Matters
requirement if the Faculty Senate votes
in favor of the SUES committee's rec

ommendations in its March 8 meeting.
"These are courses designed to
move students from high school think
ing to college thinking," Berman added.
"This has always been an implicit goal
of IHUM, but now we 'll be undertaking
this specific freshmen pedagogy across
the University."
The transition to Thinking Matters
may also serve practical scheduling pur
poses. Freshmen will be required to
take one quarter rather than the
three quarters currently mandated by
the IHUM program of a Thinking
Matters class, allowing them greater
flexibility as they design their first-year
course load.
"The growth of unit-intensive ma

jors that is, majors that have explicit,
but more importantly, implicitly high
unit-level requirements . . . has just
eroded student flexibility," Berman
said. "The University has not addressed
this problem, and a result is a cutting
back of General Education Require-


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
merits (GERs) in order to make
room for high levels of unit de
mand in majors."
Lanier Anderson, chair of the
SUES subcommittee on the
freshman year, agreed that fresh
men face enormous pressure to
balance exploration with the ful
fillment of important prerequi
sites. The SUES report noted that
many freshmen constrained
by major prerequisites, three
quarters of IHUM and a Program
in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR)
course have "zero space for
exploration."
"Students really are trying to
hold open for themselves two or
three possible pathways, and in
order to keep all those pathways
open while they explore, they
have to do the prerequisites for
all those things," Anderson said.
"Freshmen get here, and we

tell them it's a liberal education .
.. You're supposed to explore,
and they feel they have zero de
grees of freedom," Anderson
added.

report's recommendations,
Thinking Matters courses would
be integrated into the Universi
ty's breadth requirements in
