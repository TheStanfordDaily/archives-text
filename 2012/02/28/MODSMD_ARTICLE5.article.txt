## Feingold criticizes Citizens United case 
### ANTHONY VASQUEZ STAFF WRITER 
Calling a Supreme Court decision
"lawless" and warning of "corporate dom
ination of our political process," former
Senator Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) spoke
Monday night about the dangers stem
ming from the recent removal of restric
tions on financial contributions to political
groups.
Feingold spoke out against the Jan.
2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens
United v. Federal Election Commission,
arguing that it opened the door to in
creased corporate influence in politics.
"The decision issued by the court's ma
jority was essentially a lawless decision,"
Feingold said, "not only because the sub
stance of it gave corporations free reign
over our political process which is so
fundamental to our democracy but
also because of its blatant disregard for
the mores and traditions of the Supreme
Court in handling difficult cases."
The 5-4 ruling lifted prior restrictions
on corporate contributions to political
groups. This includes donations to political
action committees (PACs), which
though not directly associated with candi
dates or campaigns can channel vast
sums to political causes.
Feingold said that Americans must
choose between a political system con
trolled by large corporations and one that
has fair campaign finance regulations.
"The first path marks the beginning of
the destruction of our campaign finance
system and essentially permits corporate
domination of our political process," he
said. "This dominance will include our
most fundamental institutions: those that
govern us, those that write and enforce our
laws and regulations, those that oversee

.our economy and those that determine
our relations with other countries, even
our national security."
Feingold identified the rise in the 1990s
of "soft money" the circumvention of
limits on donations to candidates' cam
paigns by donating large sums to issue
driven campaigns as a critical juncture
in campaign financing. He argued that
laxer campaign finance regulations stem
from changes in the electorate's political
involvement.
"Corporate-funded, right-leaning ele
ments in this country were rocked by the
power of the Internet and by mass person
al involvement by average citizens," he
said. "The corporate powers in this coun
try that want to dominate our political
process saw the face of democracy and it
terrified them.

"They were scared stiff that we had
stopped the soft money flow, the leverage
on which they relied to get both Republi
cans and, I'm sorry to say, too many De
mocrats, to ratify job-killing trade agree
ments, enact the Wall Street wish list of fi
nancial deregulations and pass the most
fiscally irresponsible tax and budget poli
cies in our lifetime," Feingold added.
In response to the idea that in an age of
super PACs candidates must join the
fundraising race to effectively compete,
Feingold urged the audience to consider
the consequences of the concept. He stat
ed his opposition to President Barack
Obama's decision to allow Cabinet mem
bers to fundraise for Priorities USA Ac
tion, a pro-Obama PAC.
"Think about what you're doing,"
Feingold argued. "Think about what
you're becoming. What's the end if it's
going to be gazillionaires dominating the
entire process?"
Audience members reflected on both
Feingold's message and candor.
"The fact that he's no longer a senator
allowed him to say a lot of things he
wouldn't regularly say," said Tomer Perry,
a graduate student in political science. "He
was very critical of the Democrat and Re
publican parties, which is important."
"I'm very concerned about the ongo
ing and strengthening movement of cor
porate personhood," said Dave Mitchell
'O9.
Feingold will participate in a seminar
today from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. in Tresidder
Union. Joining him will be Joshua Cohen,
Marta Sutton Weeks professor of ethics in
society, and Stephen Ansolabehere, Har
vard professor of government.

fundraising race to effectively compete,
Feingold urged the audience to consider
the consequences of the concept. He stat
ed his opposition to President Barack
Obama's decision to allow Cabinet mem
bers to fundraise for Priorities USA Ac
tion, a pro-Obama PAC.
"Think about what you're doing,"
Feingold argued. "Think about what
you're becoming. What's the end if it's
going to be gazillionaires dominating the
entire process?"
Audience members reflected on both
Feingold's message and candor.
"The fact that he's no longer a senator
allowed him to say a lot of things he
wouldn't regularly say," said Tomer Perry,
a graduate student in political science. "He
was very critical of the Democrat and Re
publican parties, which is important."
"I'm very concerned about the ongo
ing and strengthening movement of cor
porate personhood," said Dave Mitchell
'O9.
Feingold will participate in a seminar
today from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. in Tresidder
Union. Joining him will be Joshua Cohen,
Marta Sutton Weeks professor of ethics in
society, and Stephen Ansolabehere, Har
vard professor of government.
