## Co-op residents react to ResEd, Chi Theta Chi 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Representatives of Stanford's tradi
tionally diverse co-op community have
reacted as one to Stanford's recent deci
sion to revoke Chi Theta Chi's (XOX)
lease, voicing both criticism of the Uni
versity decision as well as sympathy for

XOX residents. The effects of direct
University management on co-op life,
however, are more muted than the out
cry suggests.
"I chose to live in a co-op because I
wanted to feel like I had control over
and was contributing to my environ
ment," said Hannah Kopp-Yates 'l2, res
ident assistant (RA) at Synergy. "Chi

Theta Chi takes that to the next level...
It offers something special that even we
don't have."
"XOX is a continual source of won
derful rebelliousness that brings new life
to the co-op scene," said Jacob Boehm
'l2, community manager at Columbae.
"Having a place like that on cam
pus fills a niche, so it hurts to see
[Residential Education] try to
take away something that's so core
to its existence."
Kopp-Yates said that com
plaints about University manage
ment of the co-ops may not fully
take into account inconsistencies
between building managers and
may rely largely on ill-founded
preconceptions or anti-establish
ment sentiment. She added, how
ever, that Synergy's isolation may
contribute to a diminished Uni
versity presence, thereby limiting
negative experiences compared to
other co-ops.
"In co-op culture, there tends to
be a rebellious streak," Kopp-Yates
said. "To say that ResEd is oppres
sive may not be fair... They've
often been really supportive."
Daniel Mattes 'l2, kitchen
manager at Enchanted Broccoli
Forest (EBF), highlighted a lack of
clarity in University policy and in
adequate consultation with co-op
staff as persistent areas of conflict
between co-ops and Res Ed.
"There's not enough delin
eation of expectations and respon
sibilities," Mattes said. "They're in
timidating without having to do
anything, so for us there's constant
worry and anxiety."
Boehm echoed the sentiment,
arguing that while ResEd does
conduct appropriate research
prior to implementing co-op poli
cies, co-op residents and staff
themselves are often marginalized
in the process.
"The underlying idea is that
ResEd does what they want,"
Boehm said. "In order to transi
tion to something they want,
they'll offer concessions [to facili
tate the change]."

Boehm cited Columbae's own
experience with ResEd regarding
the house's murals as evidence of
an unbalanced relationship with
the University. Students used to
paint new designs on the house's
walls and pipes every year. Since
2008, Columbae residents have
been prohibited from adding new
murals. While the University ini
tially provided free canvases as a

means of continuing the house's
tradition, such canvases are no
longer provided.
"That's a great example of
standardization," Boehm said.
"Not painting over the murals
would be more work, so it would
just be easier for them not to exist
... There's a certain steamrolling
of character."
Boehm argued that co-op pe
culiarities, such as the murals, offer
"a larger-than-life connection that
holds together the network of
[house] alumni." While Columbae
responded to a ResEd opportuni
ty to discuss the murals by appeal
ing to the alumni community to
demonstrate the murals' ongoing
relevance, Boehm added, ResEd
has yet to return to the issue.
While noting that ResEd has
yet to impose any significant con
straints on life at Synergy, Kopp-
Yates said that some residual ten
sions between co-ops and the Uni
versity stem from a lack of under
standing by the administration.
"Co-ops as a whole have felt a
level of threat and instability with
some higher-ups in ResEd,"
Kopp-Yates said. "There's a lack
of information ... They don't see
our purpose or the assets we bring
the community in the same way
we do. Co-ops can seem like a lia
bility."
Boehm acknowledged that
Columbae's current relationship
with ResEd is less fraught than in
previous years, and noted that the
University has sought consistency
and efficiency in co-ops. He ar
gued, however, that direct Univer
sity regulation has led to a dimin
ished sense of ownership for co-op
residents, even as ResEd contin
ues to minimize liabilities and pe
culiarities within the co-op com
munity.
Conceding that the University
cited concerns about the interests
and comfort of residents who un
willingly end up living in XOX,
Boehm argued that the inclusive
ness of the co-op community lies
within its emphasis on individual
preference.
"That idea that you need to
standardize things to a lower stan
dard to accommodate different
expectations is frustrating,"
Boehm said.

[Residential Education] try to
take away something that's so core
to its existence."
Kopp-Yates said that com
plaints about University manage
ment of the co-ops may not fully
take into account inconsistencies
between building managers and
may rely largely on ill-founded
preconceptions or anti-establish
ment sentiment. She added, how
ever, that Synergy's isolation may
contribute to a diminished Uni
versity presence, thereby limiting
negative experiences compared to
other co-ops.
"In co-op culture, there tends to
be a rebellious streak," Kopp-Yates
said. "To say that ResEd is oppres
sive may not be fair... They've
often been really supportive."
Daniel Mattes 'l2, kitchen
manager at Enchanted Broccoli
Forest (EBF), highlighted a lack of
clarity in University policy and in
adequate consultation with co-op
staff as persistent areas of conflict
between co-ops and Res Ed.
"There's not enough delin
eation of expectations and respon
sibilities," Mattes said. "They're in
timidating without having to do
anything, so for us there's constant
worry and anxiety."
Boehm echoed the sentiment,
arguing that while ResEd does
conduct appropriate research
prior to implementing co-op poli
cies, co-op residents and staff
themselves are often marginalized
in the process.
"The underlying idea is that
ResEd does what they want,"
Boehm said. "In order to transi
tion to something they want,
they'll offer concessions [to facili
tate the change]."

Boehm cited Columbae's own
experience with ResEd regarding
the house's murals as evidence of
an unbalanced relationship with
the University. Students used to
paint new designs on the house's
walls and pipes every year. Since
2008, Columbae residents have
been prohibited from adding new
murals. While the University ini
tially provided free canvases as a

means of continuing the house's
tradition, such canvases are no
longer provided.
"That's a great example of
standardization," Boehm said.
"Not painting over the murals
would be more work, so it would
just be easier for them not to exist
... There's a certain steamrolling
of character."
Boehm argued that co-op pe
culiarities, such as the murals, offer
"a larger-than-life connection that
holds together the network of
[house] alumni." While Columbae
responded to a ResEd opportuni
ty to discuss the murals by appeal
ing to the alumni community to
demonstrate the murals' ongoing
relevance, Boehm added, ResEd
has yet to return to the issue.
While noting that ResEd has
yet to impose any significant con
straints on life at Synergy, Kopp-
Yates said that some residual ten
sions between co-ops and the Uni
versity stem from a lack of under
standing by the administration.
"Co-ops as a whole have felt a
level of threat and instability with
some higher-ups in ResEd,"
Kopp-Yates said. "There's a lack
of information ... They don't see
our purpose or the assets we bring
the community in the same way
we do. Co-ops can seem like a lia
bility."
Boehm acknowledged that
Columbae's current relationship
with ResEd is less fraught than in
previous years, and noted that the
University has sought consistency
and efficiency in co-ops. He ar
gued, however, that direct Univer
sity regulation has led to a dimin
ished sense of ownership for co-op
residents, even as ResEd contin
ues to minimize liabilities and pe
culiarities within the co-op com
munity.
Conceding that the University
cited concerns about the interests
and comfort of residents who un
willingly end up living in XOX,
Boehm argued that the inclusive
ness of the co-op community lies
within its emphasis on individual
preference.
"That idea that you need to
standardize things to a lower stan
dard to accommodate different
expectations is frustrating,"
Boehm said.

Representatives of Stanford's tradi
tionally diverse co-op community have
reacted as one to Stanford's recent deci
sion to revoke Chi Theta Chi's (XOX)
lease, voicing both criticism of the Uni
versity decision as well as sympathy for

XOX residents. The effects of direct
University management on co-op life,
however, are more muted than the out
cry suggests.
"I chose to live in a co-op because I
wanted to feel like I had control over
and was contributing to my environ
ment," said Hannah Kopp-Yates 'l2, res
ident assistant (RA) at Synergy. "Chi

Theta Chi takes that to the next level...
It offers something special that even we
don't have."
"XOX is a continual source of won
derful rebelliousness that brings new life
to the co-op scene," said Jacob Boehm
'l2, community manager at Columbae.
"Having a place like that on cam
pus fills a niche, so it hurts to see
