# UNIVERSITY. STUDENT LIFE
## Co-op residents react to ResEd, Chi Theta Chi 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Representatives of Stanford's tradi
tionally diverse co-op community have
reacted as one to Stanford's recent deci
sion to revoke Chi Theta Chi's (XOX)
lease, voicing both criticism of the Uni
versity decision as well as sympathy for

XOX residents. The effects of direct
University management on co-op life,
however, are more muted than the out
cry suggests.
"I chose to live in a co-op because I
wanted to feel like I had control over
and was contributing to my environ
ment," said Hannah Kopp-Yates 'l2, res
ident assistant (RA) at Synergy. "Chi

Theta Chi takes that to the next level...
It offers something special that even we
don't have."
"XOX is a continual source of won
derful rebelliousness that brings new life
to the co-op scene," said Jacob Boehm
'l2, community manager at Columbae.
