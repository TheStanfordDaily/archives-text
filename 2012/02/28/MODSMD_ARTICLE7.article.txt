pressing optimism that "the brightest moments
for Syria are still ahead," a panel of speakers ad
dressed "The Syrian Uprising" Monday
evening.
The event, which took place in the Tresidder
Cypress Room, was hosted by the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network (MSAN) and the Is
lamic Society of Stanford University (ISSU).
The panel discussion was part of the 2012 Islam
ic Awareness Series.
The panel featured three speakers: Hisham
Ahmed, professor in the department of politics

at Saint Mary's College of California; Jaber
Kabash, a physician and board member of the
Northern California chapter of the Syrian
American Council; and Suzan Boulad, a blog
ger, non-profit organizer and board member of
the Northern California chapter of the Syrian
American Council.
Kabash spoke first, providing a background
of Syrian history from the French occupation to
the post-colonial power struggle and the rise of
Assad rule in 1970.
He argued that the Assad dynasty has sur
vived because of the implementation of a per
sonality cult, targeted political and economic
policies and the use of a security apparatus.
