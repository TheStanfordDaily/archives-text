## Panel discusses Syrian uprising, future 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
Describing ongoing measures of repression
that "instill fear in any Syrian's heart," but ex
pressing optimism that "the brightest moments
for Syria are still ahead," a panel of speakers ad
dressed "The Syrian Uprising" Monday
evening.
The event, which took place in the Tresidder
Cypress Room, was hosted by the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network (MSAN) and the Is
lamic Society of Stanford University (ISSU).
The panel discussion was part of the 2012 Islam
ic Awareness Series.
The panel featured three speakers: Hisham
Ahmed, professor in the department of politics

at Saint Mary's College of California; Jaber
Kabash, a physician and board member of the
Northern California chapter of the Syrian
American Council; and Suzan Boulad, a blog
ger, non-profit organizer and board member of
the Northern California chapter of the Syrian
American Council.
Kabash spoke first, providing a background
of Syrian history from the French occupation to
the post-colonial power struggle and the rise of
Assad rule in 1970.
He argued that the Assad dynasty has sur
vived because of the implementation of a per
sonality cult, targeted political and economic
policies and the use of a security apparatus.

Jaber Kabash participated in a panel discussion on the ongoing Syrian uprising
Monday. He provided a background of Syrian history before his colleagues addressed the ongoing power struggle within the country.
"The most important method
of control is the strong and over
lapping security apparatus which
is enough to instill fear in any Syr
ian's heart," he said.
Boulad then gave a chronolo
gy of the revolution, providing a
summary of key events such as
the March 15 protests in Daraa
that sparked the uprisings.
She emphasized how main
stream media such as CNN or
BBC and alternative networks
such as Facebook and Twitter tell
two different tales of the Syrian
situation.
"They want to show the most
dramatic parts of the revolution,"
she said. "But by not giving grow
ing organic opposition groups the
voice in their coverage, it makes it
hard for people to understand
what Syrians are dying for."
Boulad also pointed out the
difficulty and danger in protest
ing, saying that, "the Assad
regime has grown roots into every
element of Syrian society. Most
people do not like or love Assad,
[but] there is a silent majority who
are scared to speak out."
Boulad acknowledged the ef
forts of various opposition ele
ments, such as the Syrian Nation
al Council, but said that local co
ordinating committees, which or
ganize protests on the ground,
network with other Syrian cities
and upload You Tube videos, are
"the petri dish of what Syrian
democracy will hopefully look
like in the future."
She criticized how some in the
media, especially in the West,
have framed the revolution as
one pitting the Alawi, a Shi'a sect
of Islam to which the Assad fam
ily belongs, against the Sunnis,
the majority Islamic sect in Syria.
"Religion has not defined this
revolution as much as some
would have us think," she said.
Boulad said that, while she is
optimistic that the "brightest mo
ments for Syria are still ahead,"
she warned that, "the longer
Assad stays in power, the more
Syrians will struggle after the
regime falls to rebuild the coun
try in a unified and democratic
way."
Ahmed began by stating, "It is
my duty and obligation to talk
about the bloodbath in Syria.This

is a depressing but heroic unfold
ing of human trauma."
He expressed optimism, how
ever, that Assad will be toppled
soon, saying, "the question is not
whether we crumble but when,
how, by whom and under what
circumstances. Even Assad's sup
porters recognized that his days
are numbered."
Ahmed criticized the Assad
government for advocating Arab
nationalism while employing di
visive strategies to pit factions in
Syria against one another.
He concluded by emphasizing
that change must come from the
Syrian people rather than from
Western governments.
"There does need to be a
choice between the decadent
Assad regime and the revival of

Western ambition and exploita
tion," he said. "Syrians are not
paying with their blood to jump
out of a frying pan into the fire."
Audience members posed
questions on topics including the
revolution's impact on U.S. inter
ests in the region, the Syrian-
Palestinian link, the effectiveness
of Arab peacekeeping forces and
the role of the Syrian Diaspora in
the revolution.
"I think its really sad what is
happening in Syria and how it
seems like a stagnant situation,"
said audience member Osama El-
Gabalawy 'l5, " but events like
these raise awareness and keep us
from losing hope,"

one pitting the Alawi, a Shi'a sect
of Islam to which the Assad fam
ily belongs, against the Sunnis,
the majority Islamic sect in Syria.
"Religion has not defined this
revolution as much as some
would have us think," she said.
Boulad said that, while she is
optimistic that the "brightest mo
ments for Syria are still ahead,"
she warned that, "the longer
Assad stays in power, the more
Syrians will struggle after the
regime falls to rebuild the coun
try in a unified and democratic
way."
Ahmed began by stating, "It is
my duty and obligation to talk
about the bloodbath in Syria.This

is a depressing but heroic unfold
ing of human trauma."
He expressed optimism, how
ever, that Assad will be toppled
soon, saying, "the question is not
whether we crumble but when,
how, by whom and under what
circumstances. Even Assad's sup
porters recognized that his days
are numbered."
Ahmed criticized the Assad
government for advocating Arab
nationalism while employing di
visive strategies to pit factions in
Syria against one another.
He concluded by emphasizing
that change must come from the
Syrian people rather than from
Western governments.
"There does need to be a
choice between the decadent
Assad regime and the revival of

Western ambition and exploita
tion," he said. "Syrians are not
paying with their blood to jump
out of a frying pan into the fire."
Audience members posed
questions on topics including the
revolution's impact on U.S. inter
ests in the region, the Syrian-
Palestinian link, the effectiveness
of Arab peacekeeping forces and
the role of the Syrian Diaspora in
the revolution.
"I think its really sad what is
happening in Syria and how it
seems like a stagnant situation,"
said audience member Osama El-
Gabalawy 'l5, " but events like
these raise awareness and keep us
from losing hope,"

Describing ongoing measures of repression
that "instill fear in any Syrian's heart," but ex
pressing optimism that "the brightest moments
for Syria are still ahead," a panel of speakers ad
dressed "The Syrian Uprising" Monday
evening.
The event, which took place in the Tresidder
Cypress Room, was hosted by the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network (MSAN) and the Is
lamic Society of Stanford University (ISSU).
The panel discussion was part of the 2012 Islam
ic Awareness Series.
The panel featured three speakers: Hisham
Ahmed, professor in the department of politics

at Saint Mary's College of California; Jaber
Kabash, a physician and board member of the
Northern California chapter of the Syrian
American Council; and Suzan Boulad, a blog
ger, non-profit organizer and board member of
the Northern California chapter of the Syrian
American Council.
Kabash spoke first, providing a background
of Syrian history from the French occupation to
the post-colonial power struggle and the rise of
Assad rule in 1970.
He argued that the Assad dynasty has sur
vived because of the implementation of a per
sonality cult, targeted political and economic
policies and the use of a security apparatus.

Jaber Kabash participated in a panel discussion on the ongoing Syrian uprising
Monday. He provided a background of Syrian history before his colleagues addressed the ongoing power struggle within the country.
"The most important method
of control is the strong and over
lapping security apparatus which
is enough to instill fear in any Syr
ian's heart," he said.
Boulad then gave a chronolo
gy of the revolution, providing a
summary of key events such as
the March 15 protests in Daraa
that sparked the uprisings.
She emphasized how main
stream media such as CNN or
BBC and alternative networks
such as Facebook and Twitter tell
two different tales of the Syrian
situation.
"They want to show the most
dramatic parts of the revolution,"
she said. "But by not giving grow
ing organic opposition groups the
voice in their coverage, it makes it
hard for people to understand
what Syrians are dying for."
Boulad also pointed out the
difficulty and danger in protest
ing, saying that, "the Assad
regime has grown roots into every
element of Syrian society. Most
people do not like or love Assad,
[but] there is a silent majority who
are scared to speak out."
Boulad acknowledged the ef
forts of various opposition ele
ments, such as the Syrian Nation
al Council, but said that local co
ordinating committees, which or
ganize protests on the ground,
network with other Syrian cities
and upload You Tube videos, are
"the petri dish of what Syrian
democracy will hopefully look
like in the future."
She criticized how some in the
media, especially in the West,
have framed the revolution as
one pitting the Alawi, a Shi'a sect
of Islam to which the Assad fam
ily belongs, against the Sunnis,
the majority Islamic sect in Syria.
"Religion has not defined this
revolution as much as some
would have us think," she said.
Boulad said that, while she is
optimistic that the "brightest mo
ments for Syria are still ahead,"
she warned that, "the longer
Assad stays in power, the more
Syrians will struggle after the
regime falls to rebuild the coun
try in a unified and democratic
