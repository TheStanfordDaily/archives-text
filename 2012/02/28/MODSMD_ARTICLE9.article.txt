## Stanford research suggests'nomad' planets wandering galaxy 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Judith Pelpola 
According to researchers at the
Kavli Institute for Particle Astro
physics and Cosmology (KIPAC),
there may be a multitude of plan
ets wandering the Milky Way
Galaxy outside the orbit of any
star. Researchers estimated that
there may be 100,000 times as
many of these nomad planets as
stars in the galaxy.
The estimates were obtained by
factoring in the Milky Way's gravi
tational pull, the amount of avail
able matter to compose the planets
and the potential of said matter to
form planets of varying sizes.
"If any of these nomad planets
are big enough to have a thick at
mosphere, they could have trapped
enough heat for bacterial life to
exist," said Louis Strigari in the
Stanford Report. Strigari led the re
search team at KIPAC, which is a
joint institute of the SLAC Nation
al Accelerator Laboratory and
Stanford University.
According to the research paper
submitted by the team to the
Monthly Notices of the Royal As
tronomical Society, the heat neces
sary for life to exist on these planets
could come from internal radioac
tive decay as well as surface tecton
ic movement.
Researchers first identified
nomad planets last year using grav
itational micro-lensing, a procedure
that detects stars whose light has
been distorted momentarily by the
gravitational pull of nearby planets.
The study raised questions re
garding planet formation and the
potential for nomad planets to sup
port life. Researchers outside of
Stanford expressed enthusiasm for
the new findings.
"To paraphrase Dorothy from
"The Wizard of Oz," if correct, this
extrapolation implies that we are
not in Kansas anymore, and in fact,
we never were in Kansas," said Alan
Boss of the Carnegie Institution for
Science, according to the Stanford
Report.
