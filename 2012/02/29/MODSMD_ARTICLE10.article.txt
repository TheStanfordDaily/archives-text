# CLOCK WISE
## 113 years later, Stanford's tower clock tells more than time 
### AMRTIA RAO 
The familiar tones of the
Westminster Chimes
melody float across
campus, followed by a
short pause. At this time,
Stanford students of the early
1900s would have pulled out their
pocket watches, ready to set at the
imminent stroke of the hour.
The tower clock can trace its
history back to 1899 when Jane
Stanford ordered it from the Seth
Thomas Clock Company, the same
company that manufactured the
famous clock at Grand Central
Station in New York City. The
clock originally resided on top of
Memorial Church, but the 1906
earthquake damaged the tower in
which it was installed. The clock
was then transferred to a new
home, a shingled wooden struc
ture, behind the church a move
that was intended to be temporary
but lasted for over 50 years.
Over the years, engineering stu
dents added a motor to turn the
dial so that the clock would contin
ue to keep accurate time, but the
chimes fell completely out of se
quence. The clock stood as a relic of
Stanford University's earlier days
sentimental but not particularly
useful. By the 19605, the clock and
its bells had disappeared into stor
age and, for a time, into oblivion.
Henry Fuchs, professor of me
chanical engineering, took on the
task of bringing the clock back to
life in the 1980s, placing it in the
Terman Engineering Building for
a few years. He discovered and
hired Dorian Clair, an expert in an
tique clock restoration, who had a
shop located in Palo Alto. Clair had
restored and maintained the Ferry
Building and Ghirardelli Square
clocks in San Francisco and the San
Jose Museum of Art clock.
William Kimball '4l, after
whom Kimball Hall is named, do
nated enough money to build a
clock tower to house the old mech
anism and chime bells.
Clair returned the clock to its
original mechanical functions, and
in 1983 it took up its current resi
dence at the corner of the quad by
the roundabout often called the
"Circle of Death." The clock is the
most complete mechanical clock
displayed in the Bay Area.
"It's not only one of the best
maintained tower clocks," said
Gibson Anderson '67, a Bonair
Siding employee who volunteers
to set the clock and helps Clair
service it. "It's also one of the best
displayed."
Through the glass walls of the
clock tower, one can view most of
the mechanisms that make the
clock run. The pendulum runs on
gravity. Weights pull on cables that
turn drums that are attached to
gears that turn other gears. Every
15 minutes, a stop releases the

chimes. Although complicated in
assembly, the individual parts that
make up the clock follow simple
rules, operating completely
through mechanical processes.
"There have been no revolu
tionary changes in clock design in a
thousand years," Anderson said.
Digital wristwatches and smart
phones may have replaced pocket
watches, but the principles on
which the tower clock runs har
nessing the forces of gravity, ten
sion and basic machinery re
main elegantly simple.
The clock's timeless design
helps it keep time remarkably well.
A few weeks ago, its running six
minutes behind caused a minor stir
on campus. But this delay had been
caused by human neglect in adjust
ing the clock rather than any fault
in its mechanism.
The clock itself is subject to the
same natural laws on which it runs.
In dry weather, the pendulum loses
mass in the form of moisture,
changing its effective length and
causing it to run behind time. The
clock, however, was built with
gross and fine adjusting mecha
nisms to compensate for climatic
influences.
"As long as you keep it wound
and set, it's going to keep on
going," Clair said. "The life ex
pectancy of that clock is several
hundred more years if it's taken
care of"
The clock embodies Stanford's
history not only in its classic ap
pearance, but also in the efforts
that Stanford students and com
munity affiliates have put into it
over the years. After its installment
in 1983, Professor Dave Beach's
mechanical engineering students
made some modifications to com
pensate for the effects of weather,
including a new temperature-com
pensating pendulum.
Clair rearranged the weight as
sembly so that in the event of an
earthquake, the weights would
land in the pit below the tower

rather than potentially destroying
the clock by crashing into it. This
improvement proved itself useful
in the earthquake of 1989, and bash
marks from the weights can still be
seen on the tower's walls.
Anderson came up with an ex
ternal adjustment mechanism,
adding and removing small
weights to the pendulum weight in
order to compensate for tempera
ture-related weight fluctuations.
Bill Boiler '6B redesigned the bell
hammer mounting mechanism,
which had been improperly strik
ing and damaging the bells. For all
of these individuals, the clock
played a touching role in their
Stanford experiences.
"The clock and I followed each
other across the campus," Boiler
said. "When I was in graduate
school, the clock bells were visibly
sitting under a tree next door to the
Fire Station... it seemed natural
to respond to the request to help
ensure their future."
In 1994, Rob Bernier M.S. '96
Ph.D. 'Ol began maintaining the
clock, winding it up and checking
its accuracy weekly. In an interview
with The Stanford Report, he de
scribed the clock as "a mechanical
thing in a computerized world."
The tower clock's history is not
only mechanical. During its
restoration in 1982, Clair would put
together some of the parts on the
stairway of the engineering build
ing for show. To teach students not
to touch the clockwork on display,
Fuchs applied a layer of Moly
Coat, a black substance used on
metal that stains hands and clothes.
The night before the new
tower's opening ceremony in 1983,
an unidentified student put Mick
ey Mouse hands on the clock face.
When it started at midnight, Mick
ey's minute hand bent over and
grasped the other hand, stopping
the clock. Clair had to go to the top
of the tower and pull them off be
fore it could run again.
Today, Clair, Anderson and a
number of graduate students and
Stanford affiliates maintain the
clock, winding it up every four
days, checking its accuracy, recali
brating it when necessary and oc
casionally cleaning its bells.
Having invested in the clock's
fate for over 25 years, Clair hopes it
will have a long future.
"Don't let it run down," he en
treated. "It's capable of keeping
pretty good time, and you can tell
just looking through the window if
it needs anything."
The clock occupies its stately
spot today and runs on time
through the efforts of students, fac
ulty and alumni over dozens of
years. Passing by, visitors can be
hold a living â€” and ticking
record of Stanford's illustrious past.
