## EDITORIAL The 						pitfalls of technology in education 
### 
With Computer Science
Professor Sebastian
Thrun's recent launch
of Udacity, an online teaching
venture, there was a great deal of
talk in tech and education circles
about the potential for online
learning and other technologies
to radically transform education.
Much of the discourse focused on
the thousands of people Thrun
reached with his online version of
CS 221, an artificial intelligence
class. Thrun's fall 2011-12 itera
tion of the class received general
ly poor marks from Stanford stu
dents, scoring an average rating of
2.5 stars on Course√üank and sim
ilarly poor ratings on Axess. Cer
tainly, for many of the online stu
dents, mediocre instruction was
better than none at all. Yet, re
gardless of the medium of instruc
tion, the teaching quality and
course content remain essential, a
fact often lost among advocates of
educational technologies.
This anecdote is also represen
tative of a broader reality in edu
cation policy today: much talk is
devoted to the potential of tech
nology in education, whereas
how the technology-based alter
natives compare to their more
traditional counterparts is given
relatively little attention. As a
Sept. 2011 New York Times arti
cle on the subject concluded,
"schools are spending billions on
technology, even as they cut
budgets and lay off teachers, with
little proof that this approach is
improving basic learning."
Advocates of infusing more
technology into education often
point to specific cases where tech
nology in the classroom is corre
lated with stronger student
achievement. But for every suc
cessful case, there is likely one
where technology has had a neg
ligible, if not adverse, effect on
achievement; the Times article,
for instance, highlights a school
district in Arizona that spent $33
million in technologies such as
laptops and interactive screens,
only to see test scores drop rela
tive to the state average.
Although case studies are
prominent in the discussion of
whether technology should be
further integrated into education
in the United States, there is also
some research on the subject. A
2010 U.S. Department of Educa
tion meta-analysis found that
"students in online conditions
performed modestly better, on
average, than those learning the
same material through tradition
al face-to-face instruction." How
ever, the study cautioned readers
on the application of its results:
the sample size for K-12 learning
environments was extremely
small, and the study warned "on

line and face-to-face conditions
generally differed on multiple di
mensions, including the amount
of time that learners spent on
task." The analysis found that the
most effective results were ob
tained with a blend of online and
face-to-face instruction.
Indeed, this Editorial Board
envisions the blend model as the
most desirable approach to edu
cation. Certainly, there are in
stances in which technology can
be useful; online learning is better
than no learning at all. But new
technologies should neither en
tirely replace face-to-face learn
ing nor divert significant atten
tion away from the more tradi
tional approach. Simply put,
funding realities are such that
every dollar that goes into new
technologies takes away from
teacher salaries, playgrounds or
other sought-after expenditures.
In addition, debates over
whether to integrate new tech
nologies in the classroom can
shift critical attention away from
perhaps more pressing issues
such as, say, high dropout rates.
With these realities in mind,
and the fact that research on the
causal effects of technology in the
classroom is still in its infancy, this
Editorial Board believes that
school administrators should
proceed cautiously in adopting
new technologies. This does not
mean shirking technology alto
gether, but rather integrating the
use of cheap and effective tools,
such as online tutorials like those
given through the Khan Acade
my. Administrators should also
not expect technology in the
classroom to be an instant fix. A
school with costly Smart Boards
in every class means nothing if
the school's teachers are ineffec
tive in general or are poorly
trained to utilize the technology.
While Thrun is heralding tech
nology as the way forward, Biolo
gy Professor Robert Sapolsky,
one of Stanford's top-rated pro
fessors, is known to still use an
overhead projector and trans
parencies in lecture. The success
of Waldorf schools, which pur
posefully de-emphasize technol
ogy, demonstrates that teachers
and content are far more impor
tant than technology in determin
ing student achievement. At the
same time, new technologies cer
tainly offer unique advantages,
especially in regards to distance
learning. By increasing attention
on teacher quality and curricu
lum content, while approaching
novel technologies through a
more pragmatic lens, this Board
believes that education leaders
can improve student achieve
ment without putting a consider
able strain on local budgets.
