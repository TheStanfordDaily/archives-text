## Dear The Stanford Fund 
### Ravali Reddy 
If you haven't already, I recom
mend you check out Stan
ford's newest social network
ing venture: a Tumblr page called
"That's So Stanford!" The page,
started as a part of Stanford's Dig
ital Media Internship Program, is
best described as cute. It's full of
beautiful photos of campus, heart
felt messages from students about
the inspiration they get from
other students and other shout
outs to members of the Stanford
community. It's full of those things
that you look at and go, "I know
exactly what you're talking about.
That's so Stanford."
I'm a fan of Tumblr, and I think
it's great that Stanford now has
one. But after scrolling through
the posts, I found my mind drifting
off and thinking about what else
could be classified as so Stanford.
There a few things that all
Stanford students seem to bond
over: the beautiful weather (the
number of screen captures I've
seen that compare the weather
here to the weather in Cambridge,
where it is 32 degrees, is much too
high, and yet every photo has mul
tiple Facebook likes), petitions
(this past week has been full of
Senate and special fees requests
in particular), and our common
dislike of TSF letters.
For those of you who aren't fa
miliar with the acronym, TSF
stands for The Stanford Fund, a
collective fund of donations made
to the University that is used to
support financial aid, academic

initiatives and students groups all
over campus. In exchange for TSF
funding, student groups must
complete a certain number of vol
unteer hours, which can be done
in various ways such as helping
work shifts during important cam
pus weekends, like Parents'
Weekend. In addition, groups
must write a certain number of
letters and postcards to donors
thanking them for their dona
tions, and these letters have be
come the bane of many students'
existence.
Now, don't get me wrong I
am extremely appreciative of The
Stanford Fund and all that they do
for student life here on campus. In
fact, I'm a part of two student
groups that are funded by TSF,
and if it weren't for the generous
donations that we receive, my fel
low dance team members and I
would have to shell out thousands
of dollars to pursue our passion
here at Stanford. Thanking our
donors through a letter or post
card is the least that we can do.
You see, what bothers me
about these TSF letters is the lack
of authenticity. TSF letter writing
assignments are accompanied by
a list of guidelines and rules that
tell us how many words we are al
lowed to cross out, what topics we
should touch upon and how our
letters should be structured. Stu
dents essentially create a tem
plate that they use to churn out a
predetermined number of identi
cal letters, which are then sent off

to donors.
As I sit here, staring at my pile
of TSF postcards for the quarter, I
can't help but wonder what goes
through an alumni's head when
they open one of our thank-you
letters. I'm sure they appreciate
the thought, but they must notice
that there is something robotic
and dry about the content (after
all, they are perceptive Stanford
graduates). And what about the
young alumni who recently grad
uated from Stanford and remem
ber writing their own TSF letters?
I find it difficult to believe that
they can truly appreciate receiv
ing one of these letters when they
don't have the fondest memories
of writing them. During one par
ticularly long TSF writing session,
a friend of mine went so far as to
say, "When I donate to Stanford,
I'm going to specifically request
that no one spend time writing me
one of these letters."
TSF should really consider
finding new ways of reaching out
to alumni. The Stanford Student
Call Center is a great one, I had
the chance to spend a few hours
there once, and spending a few
brief minutes on the phone with a
