# BURSTING THE BUBBLE
## Wildly self-actualizing next year's ASSU 
### Edward Ngai 
E lection season is already in
the air, just over halfway
through the quarter;
strangers shove petitions under
your nose at breakfast and peers
you vaguely recognize beg you to
support their campaign on Face
book.
But what exactly are you run
ning for? Undergraduate Senate?
Sounds cool.
Wait, what do you do, exactly?
You certainly won't find that
information on the Senate web
site, which exists, at least (some
thing you couldn't have said for
most of 2011), but with distorted
pictures, missing bios and no sub
stantial news about anything the

Senate does.
So when you ask me to sign this
petition, what exactly am I sup
porting you to do?
I know that the Senate meets
regularly and works very hard to
discuss important issues that af
fect all of us. But neither I nor my
fellow freshmen know what any
of these issues are.
They don't even bother to type
up 140 characters every time they
meet to describe what they talked
about: the ASSU Senate Twitter
feed has all of 15 tweets and two
followers.
That's just the Senate, which in
my very unscientific poll of the
Burbank lounge already has a sig

nificantly better reputation than
the Executive, whose mention
draws confused looks and three
initials: "SMD?"
They refer of course to ASSU
Vice-President Stewart Macgre
gor-Dennis 'l3, infamous in fresh
man dorms for a series of "creep
er" emails he sent us in October
asking to meet personally to con
tinue nonexistent correspondenc
es.
To be fair, Mr. Macgregor-
Dennis has been doing a lot right.
The ASSU Executive website
looks professional and updated
(though you'll soon realize that
there are only six accessible posts,
none before Jan. 25). There's also

a graph that shows what the Exec
utive team has been up to.
On Jan. 18, they celebrated
their "Halftime Highlights," illus
trating their
39 percent completion of a plat
form that includes such accom
plishments as "facilitate commu
nication between ... groups" and
"place vegetarian . . . options
closer to the center of the entree
lines." Their new social calendar is
a very cool idea. Congratulations,
team.
But it was not always such
smooth sailing. First, the new Di
vision of Internal Review couldn't
get off the ground. Then the Exec
utive lost their paid Chief of Staff.

Somewhere in between, there was
a hitch in the Community Action
Board.
I'm sure the ASSU does awe
some things. Just yesterday a
friend of mine pointed to E2.0 and
the great work they're doing to
help entrepreneurs at Stanford.
I'd link to their page, but they
don't seem to have a website.
Their first Google hit is a story
about how they're actually not a
part of the ASSU anymore.
Never mind.
