Hewlett, Dave Packard and Fred Terman.
The program, which was first established last year,
aims to "recognize the achievements of Stanford engi
neers who have profoundly advanced the course of
human, social and economic progress through engineer
ing," according to the School of Engineering website.
This year's inductees were Craig Barrett, retired
CEO of Intel Corp.; Andreas Bechtolsheim, co
founder of Sun Microsystems; Morris Chang, found
ing chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufactur
ing Co.; George Dantzig, pioneer of linear program
ming; Theodore Maiman, owner of the U.S. patent for
world's first laser; Bradford Parkinson, chief architect
of the Global Positioning System; Calvin Quate, co-in
ventor of the scanning acoustic microscope; and
Stephen Timoshenko, a leader in applied mechanics in
the United States.
"These heroes have profoundly changed how the
world lives," said James Plummer, dean of the School
of Engineering, in a University press release. "The
Stanford School of Engineering is proud to recognize
their accomplishments and, especially, to note our
connection to them and their work."
Plummer said he hopes these individuals will in
