## LOOKING LIKE NO. 1 STANFORD CRUISES PAST UC-DAVIS 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Enjoying its first game this
season as the No. 1 team in the
country, Stanford baseball stayed
undefeated with a 5-1 win over
UC-Davis at Sunken Diamond
last night.
The Cardinal (8-0) benefited
from a two-hit night from junior
centerfielder Jake Stewart as well
as another multi-RBI perform
ance from preseason All-Ameri

can third baseman Stephen Pis
cotty.The Stanford coaching staff
shuffled five pitchers into the
game, with none lasting more
than two and two-thirds innings,
but the Aggies (5-3) could only
muster a single run despite being
outhit just 7-6 by the Cardinal.

Senior Brian Busick made his
first start in nearly two years for
Stanford. The righthander has
worked strictly out of the bullpen
since the end of his sophomore
season. After giving up two runs
in one inning in his only prior ap
pearance in 2012 a 9-5 win
over Vanderbilt Busick got
three quick outs in his predeter
mined one inning. Junior
righthander Sahil Bloom came in
for the second but struggled with
his command, allowing a UC-

Davis run and then loading the
bases before getting out of the in
ning.
Bloom hit the leadoff batter in
the third, but with the hit-and
run on, sophomore shortstop
Lonnie Kauppila doubled up the
Aggie baserunner on a line drive
by leftfielder David Popkins.
Bloom was yanked after hitting
another batter in the fourth, and
junior righthander Dean McAr
dle bailed him out with a timely
double play to end the inning.
The Cardinal got on the board
quickly, meanwhile, with a lead
off home run by Stewart, who
also had a solo shot on Friday
against Texas.
"I'm just trying to go up there
and get on base that's my job
as a leadoff hitter," Stewart said.
"I've been trying to see it well
and just relax up there, and I
think it's been paying off."
Piscotty tacked on two more
runs with a third-inning double,
and freshman first baseman
Brian Ragira brought him home
with a single to make the score 4-
1.
UC-Davis loaded the bases
again with two outs in the fifth,
benefiting from a walk and their
third hit batter of the night, but
McArdle struck out junior desig
nated hitter C.J. Blom to get out
of yet another jam.
Stewart led off the bottom
half of the inning with an infield
single and advanced on an over
thrown pickoff by junior
righthander Patrick Hennessey.
A pair of groundouts from junior
leftfielder Tyler Gaffney and Pis
cotty brought Stewart home for
the second time on the night and
added to Piscotty's team-leading
19 RBI.
McArdle continued his strong
outing, getting some help from
his defense to close out his 2.2 in
nings of one-hit relief work. With
the second day of football spring
practice concluding behind the
outfield fence, Gaffney who
doubles as a Cardinal running
back in the summer and fall

Junior centerfielder Jake Stewart (above) hit a leadoff home run to pace the Stanford baseball team to its
first win as the No. 1 team in the country. The Cardinal had no trouble with UC-Davis despite scoring just
five runs, its lowest offensive output of the season. Stewart was the only Stanford player with multiple hits.
showed his agility with a sliding
sixth-inning catch on a foul ball to
left field. In the seventh, freshman
catcher Wayne Taylor making
his first career start behind the
plate gunned out Aggie cen
terfielder Brett Morgan trying to
steal second.
Taylor added his first career
hit in the bottom half of the sev
enth frame with a leadoff double
into right field, though Stanford
failed to advance him past sec
ond.
"It was good to get his feet wet
... we needed to get Taylor out
there" said head coach Mark
Marquess. "It's tough for a fresh
man. I thought he did well. He
was a little nervous to begin with,
then he got his first hit and got
comfortable behind the plate. He

even threw a guy out in a big spot
there."
Sophomore A.J. Vanegas and
freshman David Schmidt com
bined to finish out the game for
the Cardinal, allowing just one hit
over their three combined in
nings. McArdle got his first win of
the season to put his career
record at a stellar 13-4.
"Dean's been critical to us,"
Marquess said. "He's had more
wins than anybody else on our
staff the last two years, and that
includes Appel and Mooneyham.
He's done everything we've
asked of him. He's started, he's
middle-relieved, he's closed. He
got the win tonight, pitched well
and I just can't say enough about
him. He's a team guy."
Stanford will now head to
Fresno State to face the Bulldogs
in a three-game series starting
Friday at 6 p.m.
