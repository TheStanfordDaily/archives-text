## Men notch season best, women fall 
### CONNOR SCHERER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the third weekend in a row,
Stanford's gymnastics teams split one
win and one loss between the men's
and women's squads except this
time, the winners and losers swapped
roles.
Having gone 0-3 in its past two
meets, including two losses to rival
Cal, it might appear as though the
Stanford men's gymnastics team was
reeling and in serious trouble. On
Sunday afternoon, however, the No. 4
Cardinal dispelled these worries by
posting a season-high score in its con
vincing victory over the No. 8 Michi
gan Wolverines.

In its first meet of the season in
which it did not face off against Cal,
Stanford was ready to prove that it
was a force to be reckoned with in the
NCAA. The Cardinal was able to ac
complish this feat, as it managed to
sweep all six events en route to a
351.050-341.700 win at Burnham
Pavilion.
The team was again led by junior
Eddie Penev, who won the overall
competition with a score of 87.350, in
cluding a victory in floor exercise
(15.500) and counting scores in all
five other events. Penev sits atop the
leaderboard in the country for the
best average individual all-around
score thanks in large part to the
vault, which is his strongest event.
Penev is followed closely in the
vault by freshman Sean Senters, who
is second in the country in the event.
On Sunday afternoon, however, it
was sophomore Cale Robinson who
won the vault with a 15.400 score, his
best score in any event on the season.

The Cardinal is ranked first na
tionally on vault and put up a sea
son-high 59.700 in the event to
pull away from the Wolverines.
Redshirt junior Cameron
Foreman also had quite the after
noon, winning both the parallel
bars (15.000) and high bar
(14.650). Both scores were season
highs for the junior. The Cardinal
put up team scores of 58.650 and
56.900 respectively in the two
events.
The team's total score of
351.050 was the first time all sea
son that Stanford reached the
350-point mark, eclipsing its pre
vious best score of 345.200 by
nearly six points and its average
total score by over seven points.
The team improved to 4-4 against
NCAA teams with Sunday's win
and hopes to carry this momen
tum as it travels to Oklahoma to
compete against the Sooners, who
beat Stanford 351.600-343.700
earlier in the season.
Coming off three victories in
its past two meets, the No. 12
Stanford women's gymnastics
team seemed ready as ever to
take on No. 5 Utah in front of
14,756 fans in Salt Lake City on
Friday night. Though the meet
was highlighted by many strong
individual performances by the
Cardinal gymnasts, the team fell
just short with a 196.300-196.100
loss to the host Utes, the smallest
margin of defeat of the season for
Stanford.
Starting on the bars, the Cardi
nal posted a team score of 49.000,
led by a pair of 9.850's by senior
Nicole Pechanec and junior Ash
ley Morgan.The team trailed after
the first round by 0.300 points, but
managed to take the lead going
into the third round thanks to a
49.175 on vault, the team's sec
ond-best score in the event of the
season. Junior Nicole Dayton led
Stanford on vault with a 9.900.
In the third rotation, Morgan's
9.900 on floor was good enough to
give her the victory in the event,
but was not enough to make up
for a fall and two out-of-bounds
penalties from her teammates.
The team's 48.750 in the event was
tied for its worst of the season on
floor, and this opened up the door
for the Utes to take the lead for
good.
Though the team's 49.175 on

beam tied its season-best score for
the event and narrowed the mar
gin of deficit, it was still 0.200
points short of tying the Utes.
However, the team was able to
take away a bright note from the
event, as sophomore Amanda
Spinner, who has battled injuries
throughout her career, earned her
first collegiate victory with a
9.875. Not including a fall, every

Cardinal gymnast put up a score
of at least 9.800 in the event.
The team fell to 7-3 with the
loss, but remains optimistic as the
season continues. Stanford hosts
Arizona and Cal next week at
Burnham Pavilion for its last
home meet of the season.

ond-best score in the event of the
season. Junior Nicole Dayton led
Stanford on vault with a 9.900.
In the third rotation, Morgan's
9.900 on floor was good enough to
give her the victory in the event,
but was not enough to make up
for a fall and two out-of-bounds
penalties from her teammates.
The team's 48.750 in the event was
tied for its worst of the season on
floor, and this opened up the door
for the Utes to take the lead for
good.
Though the team's 49.175 on

beam tied its season-best score for
the event and narrowed the mar
gin of deficit, it was still 0.200
points short of tying the Utes.
However, the team was able to
take away a bright note from the
event, as sophomore Amanda
Spinner, who has battled injuries
throughout her career, earned her
first collegiate victory with a
9.875. Not including a fall, every

Cardinal gymnast put up a score
of at least 9.800 in the event.
The team fell to 7-3 with the
loss, but remains optimistic as the
season continues. Stanford hosts
Arizona and Cal next week at
Burnham Pavilion for its last
home meet of the season.

Senior Alyssa Brown (above) and the Stanford women's gymnastics team
suffered a heartbreaking loss on Friday, falling to Utah by just 0.2 points.
The men's team did not meet the same fate, as Stanford beat Michigan.
For the third weekend in a row,
Stanford's gymnastics teams split one
win and one loss between the men's
and women's squads except this
time, the winners and losers swapped
roles.
Having gone 0-3 in its past two
meets, including two losses to rival
Cal, it might appear as though the
Stanford men's gymnastics team was
reeling and in serious trouble. On
Sunday afternoon, however, the No. 4
Cardinal dispelled these worries by
posting a season-high score in its con
vincing victory over the No. 8 Michi
gan Wolverines.

In its first meet of the season in
which it did not face off against Cal,
Stanford was ready to prove that it
was a force to be reckoned with in the
NCAA. The Cardinal was able to ac
complish this feat, as it managed to
sweep all six events en route to a
351.050-341.700 win at Burnham
Pavilion.
The team was again led by junior
Eddie Penev, who won the overall
competition with a score of 87.350, in
cluding a victory in floor exercise
(15.500) and counting scores in all
five other events. Penev sits atop the
leaderboard in the country for the
best average individual all-around
score thanks in large part to the
vault, which is his strongest event.
Penev is followed closely in the
vault by freshman Sean Senters, who
is second in the country in the event.
On Sunday afternoon, however, it
was sophomore Cale Robinson who
won the vault with a 15.400 score, his
best score in any event on the season.

2/26, Burnham Pavilion
The Cardinal is ranked first na
tionally on vault and put up a sea
son-high 59.700 in the event to
pull away from the Wolverines.
Redshirt junior Cameron
Foreman also had quite the after
noon, winning both the parallel
bars (15.000) and high bar
(14.650). Both scores were season
highs for the junior. The Cardinal
put up team scores of 58.650 and
56.900 respectively in the two
events.
The team's total score of
351.050 was the first time all sea
son that Stanford reached the
350-point mark, eclipsing its pre
vious best score of 345.200 by
nearly six points and its average
total score by over seven points.
The team improved to 4-4 against
NCAA teams with Sunday's win
and hopes to carry this momen
tum as it travels to Oklahoma to
compete against the Sooners, who
beat Stanford 351.600-343.700
earlier in the season.
Coming off three victories in
its past two meets, the No. 12
Stanford women's gymnastics
team seemed ready as ever to
take on No. 5 Utah in front of
14,756 fans in Salt Lake City on
Friday night. Though the meet
was highlighted by many strong
individual performances by the
Cardinal gymnasts, the team fell
just short with a 196.300-196.100
loss to the host Utes, the smallest
margin of defeat of the season for
Stanford.
Starting on the bars, the Cardi
nal posted a team score of 49.000,
led by a pair of 9.850's by senior
Nicole Pechanec and junior Ash
ley Morgan.The team trailed after
the first round by 0.300 points, but
managed to take the lead going
into the third round thanks to a
49.175 on vault, the team's sec
ond-best score in the event of the
season. Junior Nicole Dayton led
Stanford on vault with a 9.900.
