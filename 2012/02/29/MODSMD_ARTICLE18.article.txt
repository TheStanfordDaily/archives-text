## Men notch season best, women fall 
### CONNOR SCHERER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the third weekend in a row,
Stanford's gymnastics teams split one
win and one loss between the men's
and women's squads except this
time, the winners and losers swapped
roles.
Having gone 0-3 in its past two
meets, including two losses to rival
Cal, it might appear as though the
Stanford men's gymnastics team was
reeling and in serious trouble. On
Sunday afternoon, however, the No. 4
Cardinal dispelled these worries by
posting a season-high score in its con
vincing victory over the No. 8 Michi
gan Wolverines.

In its first meet of the season in
which it did not face off against Cal,
Stanford was ready to prove that it
was a force to be reckoned with in the
NCAA. The Cardinal was able to ac
complish this feat, as it managed to
sweep all six events en route to a
351.050-341.700 win at Burnham
Pavilion.
The team was again led by junior
Eddie Penev, who won the overall
competition with a score of 87.350, in
cluding a victory in floor exercise
(15.500) and counting scores in all
five other events. Penev sits atop the
leaderboard in the country for the
best average individual all-around
score thanks in large part to the
vault, which is his strongest event.
Penev is followed closely in the
vault by freshman Sean Senters, who
is second in the country in the event.
On Sunday afternoon, however, it
was sophomore Cale Robinson who
won the vault with a 15.400 score, his
best score in any event on the season.
