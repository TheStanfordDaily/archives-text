# HOME FINALE
## FINAL REGULAR SEASON GAME AT MAPLES TONIGHT 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford women's basketball team
will look to close out a perfect home campaign
when it hosts Seattle University tonight at Maples
Pavilion. The Cardinal (26-1,17-0 Pac-12), which
has not lost at Maples in nearly five full years, will
take on the Redhawks (17-9) in a rare February
nonconference game.
Stanford is blazing hot as the regular season
comes to a close. The Cardinal is riding a 23-game
winning streak, with each of the last five being de
cided by at least 23 points. Stanford's 79-game

home winning streak, the longest active streak in
the nation, will be put to the test tonight as the
Cardinal looks to close out its fifth straight per
fect home season.
The low-post duo of sisters Nnemkadi and
Chiney Ogwumike continues to baffle the oppo
sition, as each is averaging a double-double for
the season. Senior Nneka leads the Cardinal with
21.7 points and 10.5 rebounds per game, but soph
omore Chiney is not far behind with 16 points and
10.1 rebounds per game. One of the sisters has led
Stanford in scoring in 22 of the team's 27 games,
and one of the two has been the rebounding
leader in 23 of the 27 games.
For Stanford's three seniors Nneka Ogwu
mike and guards Lindy La Rocque and Grace
Mashore tonight will be the final regular-sea-
