# HOME FINALE
## FINAL REGULAR SEASON GAME AT MAPLES TONIGHT 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford women's basketball team
will look to close out a perfect home campaign
when it hosts Seattle University tonight at Maples
Pavilion. The Cardinal (26-1,17-0 Pac-12), which
has not lost at Maples in nearly five full years, will
take on the Redhawks (17-9) in a rare February
nonconference game.
Stanford is blazing hot as the regular season
comes to a close. The Cardinal is riding a 23-game
winning streak, with each of the last five being de
cided by at least 23 points. Stanford's 79-game

home winning streak, the longest active streak in
the nation, will be put to the test tonight as the
Cardinal looks to close out its fifth straight per
fect home season.
The low-post duo of sisters Nnemkadi and
Chiney Ogwumike continues to baffle the oppo
sition, as each is averaging a double-double for
the season. Senior Nneka leads the Cardinal with
21.7 points and 10.5 rebounds per game, but soph
omore Chiney is not far behind with 16 points and
10.1 rebounds per game. One of the sisters has led
Stanford in scoring in 22 of the team's 27 games,
and one of the two has been the rebounding
leader in 23 of the 27 games.

son game at Maples Pavilion, a
building where the trio is unde
feated.
"We try our best to bring the
heat every time we're here at
home because this place is so im
portant to us, and I'm really excit
ed to play Seattle," Nneka said. "I
think it's good that we're getting in
another game in between now and
Cal; it is better than practice, I'd
rather play."
Stanford and Seattle have
never squared off before, as the
Redhawks are currently transi
tioning into Division I and will
move from being an independent
to the Western Athletic Confer
ence next year. The transition year
has been very successful for the
Redhawks, who boast an 8.2-point
margin of victory for the year and
an 11-3 record in their past 14
games.

Guard Talisa Rhea, the reign
ing Independent Player of the
Week, leads Seattle with 13.9
points and 5.3 assists per game. She
has some experience against the
Cardinal, as Rhea played for Ore
gon State for three seasons before
transferring to Seattle. In seven ca
reer games against Stanford, Rhea
averaged over nine points per
game, including a 26-point out
burst in Corvallis two years ago.
Rhea has yet to beat the Cardinal
in seven tries.
The Redhawks' main inside
presence is forward Kacie Sowell,
who averages 13.8 points and a
team-leading 9.6 rebounds per
game. The 6-foot-2 sophomore
also shoots an impressive 59 per
cent from the field, but she could
have her hands full against the Og
wumike sisters. Forward Ashley
Ward is the other Redhawk aver
aging double digits with 10.9
points per game, but at 5-foot-11,
Ward will be at a significant height
disadvantage against Stanford's
forwards, who are all at least 6-
foot-2.

For the year, Seattle averages
71.3 points per game, but the Red
hawks will be hard-pressed to
keep up that average against the
stingy Cardinal defense. Stanford
has held 12 of its past 13 opponents
below 60 points, and Tennessee is
the only team to score more than
71 points on Stanford this year.
Meanwhile, the Redhawks have
allowed half of their 26 opponents
to score 70 points, and now they
must take on the nation's No. 6
scoring offense in Stanford, which
averages 77.6 points per game.
After tonight's nonconference
game, the Cardinal will return to
conference play with a trip across
the Bay to take on rival Cal in the
season finale. Stanford will then
participate in the Pac-12 tourna
ment in Los Angeles next week
before it attempts a run at a fifth
consecutive Final Four.
Stanford and Seattle will
square off tonight at Maples Pavil
ion at 7 p.m.

averaged over nine points per
game, including a 26-point out
burst in Corvallis two years ago.
Rhea has yet to beat the Cardinal
in seven tries.
The Redhawks' main inside
presence is forward Kacie Sowell,
who averages 13.8 points and a
team-leading 9.6 rebounds per
game. The 6-foot-2 sophomore
also shoots an impressive 59 per
cent from the field, but she could
have her hands full against the Og
wumike sisters. Forward Ashley
Ward is the other Redhawk aver
aging double digits with 10.9
points per game, but at 5-foot-11,
Ward will be at a significant height
disadvantage against Stanford's
forwards, who are all at least 6-
foot-2.

For the year, Seattle averages
71.3 points per game, but the Red
hawks will be hard-pressed to
keep up that average against the
stingy Cardinal defense. Stanford
has held 12 of its past 13 opponents
below 60 points, and Tennessee is
the only team to score more than
71 points on Stanford this year.
Meanwhile, the Redhawks have
allowed half of their 26 opponents
to score 70 points, and now they
must take on the nation's No. 6
scoring offense in Stanford, which
averages 77.6 points per game.
After tonight's nonconference
game, the Cardinal will return to
conference play with a trip across
the Bay to take on rival Cal in the
season finale. Stanford will then
participate in the Pac-12 tourna
ment in Los Angeles next week
before it attempts a run at a fifth
consecutive Final Four.
Stanford and Seattle will
square off tonight at Maples Pavil
ion at 7 p.m.

The No. 2 Stanford women's basketball team
will look to close out a perfect home campaign
when it hosts Seattle University tonight at Maples
Pavilion. The Cardinal (26-1,17-0 Pac-12), which
has not lost at Maples in nearly five full years, will
take on the Redhawks (17-9) in a rare February
nonconference game.
Stanford is blazing hot as the regular season
comes to a close. The Cardinal is riding a 23-game
winning streak, with each of the last five being de
cided by at least 23 points. Stanford's 79-game

home winning streak, the longest active streak in
the nation, will be put to the test tonight as the
Cardinal looks to close out its fifth straight per
fect home season.
The low-post duo of sisters Nnemkadi and
Chiney Ogwumike continues to baffle the oppo
sition, as each is averaging a double-double for
the season. Senior Nneka leads the Cardinal with
21.7 points and 10.5 rebounds per game, but soph
omore Chiney is not far behind with 16 points and
10.1 rebounds per game. One of the sisters has led
Stanford in scoring in 22 of the team's 27 games,
and one of the two has been the rebounding
leader in 23 of the 27 games.

building where the trio is unde

"We try our best to bring the
heat every time we're here at
home because this place is so im
portant to us, and I'm really excit

think it's good that we're getting in
another game in between now and
Cal; it is better than practice, I'd
rather play."
Stanford and Seattle have
never squared off before, as the
Redhawks are currently transi
tioning into Division I and will
move from being an independent
to the Western Athletic Confer
ence next year. The transition year
has been very successful for the
Redhawks, who boast an 8.2-point
margin of victory for the year and
an 11-3 record in their past 14
games.

Guard Talisa Rhea, the reign
ing Independent Player of the
Week, leads Seattle with 13.9
points and 5.3 assists per game. She
has some experience against the
Cardinal, as Rhea played for Ore
gon State for three seasons before
transferring to Seattle. In seven ca
reer games against Stanford, Rhea
averaged over nine points per
game, including a 26-point out
burst in Corvallis two years ago.
