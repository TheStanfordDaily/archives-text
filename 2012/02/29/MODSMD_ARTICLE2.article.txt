## CAB finds SUES report lacking 
### JOSEE SMITH MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER 
The ASSU Community Action Board (CAB) released a let
ter Feb. 20 in response to the recent Study of Undergraduate Ed
ucation (SUES) report, which examines the goals of a Stanford
undergraduate education and, in over 100-pages, makes 55 rec
ommendations for improvement. The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate passed a resolution to support CAB's letter at its Tuesday
night meeting.
Founded by the ASSU Executive during spring quarter last
year, CAB is a coalition of 23 representatives from across Stan
ford's campus aiming to explore issues of diversity and identity
on campus. One of the Board's stated goals on its website is to
"advocate for increased diversity in academics."
According to CAB representative Vivian Wong 'l2 in an
email to the Daily, the Board drafted the letter over several weeks
at its regular Monday meetings. She said the group used a shared
Google document, which allowed for communal editing and
rewriting.
"As a Board and individually, we felt that identity and diversi
ty were not sufficiently addressed in the original SUES report,"
Wong said. "As Stanford students, we were adamant about advo
cating for more attention to these issues on an institutional level."
CAB chair Holly Fetter 'l3 said that the letter is "primarily
concerned with three issues: increased faculty diversity, increased
course diversity, and an increase in the accessibility of academic
resources and experiences for students."
She added that the letter both identifies the Board's concerns
with the report, in addition to proposing possible solutions.
Requirements for graduation
The Board offered a solution to students in high-unit-count
majors "without the freedom to explore courses about identity
and diversity" by suggesting that departments add more courses
about ethics and diversity within their requirements, in addition
to increasing cross-listing of courses relating to identity and diver
sity, "so that they count for multiple majors and are therefore ac
cessible to more students."
Noting that there is a 40 percent underrepresentation of un
derrepresented minorities within high-unit-count majors, the let
ter recommends that SUES develop pre-college programs for
students coming from under-resourced schools, referencing The
Stanford Summer Engineering Academy and The Leland Schol
ars Program as examples of this kind of program.
The letter also stresses the importance of having more under
represented minorities teaching within the high-unit-count ma
jors in order to better inspire students to succeed.
The Board also critiqued the "Engaging Difference" title for
the proposed "Ways of Thinking, Ways of Doing" requirement as
