## CAB finds SUES report lacking 
### JOSEE SMITH MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER 
The ASSU Community Action Board (CAB) released a let
ter Feb. 20 in response to the recent Study of Undergraduate Ed
ucation (SUES) report, which examines the goals of a Stanford
undergraduate education and, in over 100-pages, makes 55 rec
ommendations for improvement. The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate passed a resolution to support CAB's letter at its Tuesday
night meeting.
Founded by the ASSU Executive during spring quarter last
year, CAB is a coalition of 23 representatives from across Stan
ford's campus aiming to explore issues of diversity and identity
on campus. One of the Board's stated goals on its website is to
"advocate for increased diversity in academics."
According to CAB representative Vivian Wong 'l2 in an
email to the Daily, the Board drafted the letter over several weeks
at its regular Monday meetings. She said the group used a shared
Google document, which allowed for communal editing and
rewriting.
"As a Board and individually, we felt that identity and diversi
ty were not sufficiently addressed in the original SUES report,"
Wong said. "As Stanford students, we were adamant about advo
cating for more attention to these issues on an institutional level."
CAB chair Holly Fetter 'l3 said that the letter is "primarily
concerned with three issues: increased faculty diversity, increased
course diversity, and an increase in the accessibility of academic
resources and experiences for students."
She added that the letter both identifies the Board's concerns
with the report, in addition to proposing possible solutions.
Requirements for graduation
The Board offered a solution to students in high-unit-count
majors "without the freedom to explore courses about identity
and diversity" by suggesting that departments add more courses
about ethics and diversity within their requirements, in addition
to increasing cross-listing of courses relating to identity and diver
sity, "so that they count for multiple majors and are therefore ac
cessible to more students."
Noting that there is a 40 percent underrepresentation of un
derrepresented minorities within high-unit-count majors, the let
ter recommends that SUES develop pre-college programs for
students coming from under-resourced schools, referencing The
Stanford Summer Engineering Academy and The Leland Schol
ars Program as examples of this kind of program.
The letter also stresses the importance of having more under
represented minorities teaching within the high-unit-count ma
jors in order to better inspire students to succeed.
The Board also critiqued the "Engaging Difference" title for
the proposed "Ways of Thinking, Ways of Doing" requirement as
"inappropriate [and] stigmatizing."
Instead, the Board suggested the
name be changed to "Engaging
Identity," in order to "level the play
ing field where no particular van
tage point is promoted above an
other."
Sequencing a liberal education
"Students need more exposure
to discussions of identity and in
equality," the letter reads, suggest
ing that at least one "Thinking Mat
ters" course be focused on conver
sations of privilege and identity and
that "September Studies" classes be
offered about these issues.
Fetter noted that "many stu
dents have only a vague under
standing of what SUES is, latching
onto the fact that it has the power to
do away with IHUM without actu
ally engaging with the report and its
contents."
"As a Board, we wanted to thor
oughly read the report and craft a
letter that offers our insight into
what's there, as well as our concerns
about what is absent," Fetter con
tinued. "This report has the possibil
ity to radically alter undergraduate
education, and we think it's crucial
that students show the faculty and
administration that we care about
the future of our collective educa
tional experience,"
Opportunities outside the class
room
Looking to the Structured Lib
eral Education (SLE) program as a
model, the Board suggested that the
Integrated Learning Environments
(ILEs) discussed in the SUES re
port be "founded on values of jus
tice and empowerment of minority
identified students" by "creating at
least one ILE centered on identity,
social justice, and/or privilege,"
The Board added, however, that
the University should take care not
to replicate SLE's "exclusively
West-centric syllabus."
Noting the importance of inte
grating studies of identity into the
residential learning experience out
side of ILEs, the letter suggests that
those studying minority identities
be offered seminars or lecture se
ries in residences or dining halls.
The Board advised that more
public service and service learning
be integrated into the Bing Over
seas Studies Program (BOSP),
using the South Africa Cape Town
program as a model.
BOSP is not adequately sup
portive of minority students, the
letter states, adding that many of
these students feel unprepared as
they travel overseas. The Board
suggested that all BOSP programs
be accessible to students with dis
abilities, that counseling services
be made available to students trav
eling abroad and that minority stu
dents be better prepared for trav
eling by offering "information ses
sions, peer mentors, and/or de
tailed guides that are tailored to

one's identity and destination."
Institutional support
Fetter noted that issues of diver
sity should move beyond just resi
dential halls.
"At Stanford, education around
identities is often relegated to the
residential sphere, because these
are perceived to be isolated, inter
personal issues," Fetter said. "How
ever, we know that the inequality
that creates prejudices and discom
fort among students is rooted in
structural issues, and that these
should thus be addressed and un
derstood at a structural level the
academy.
The letter goes on to note the
importance of advisors and tutors
for undergraduate students and
suggests that advisors and tutors
be stationed at the various Com
munity Centers around campus, to
increase accessibility and utility.
"Faculty office hours are often in
accessible and intimidating to under
represented minorities," the letter
states, suggesting that more opportu
nities for causal interactions with
professors be created, such as con
versations in dorms and dining halls.
The Board described faculty
pre-major advisors as "often irrele
vant and inaccessible," and advises
a system in which students can
"browse the profiles of prospective
pre-major advisers and then select
an appropriate one during the sum
mer before freshman year."

Additional concerns
The Board criticized the SUES
report for failing to consider stu
dents with disabilities and LGBT
identified students when speaking
about diversity and suggested more
incorporation of these "significant
identities" when discussing diversi
ty, especially when hiring professors.
Faculty diversity should include
"Black, Hispanic, and Native
American, LGBTQ-identified, and
first-generation/low income faculty
members, as well as faculty mem
bers with disabilities," the letter
states.
The Board added the impor
tance of hiring more professors
studying minority issues, such as
ethnic, gender, or sexuality studies,
in order to make pursuing a degree
in those areas easier for undergrad
uate students.
Finally, the Board strongly em
phasized the importance of incor
porating many voices, including stu
dents, faculty, scholars and staff, into
the discussion about changes to un
dergraduate education. The Board
suggests convening "a task force of
members of the Stanford communi
ty invested in affecting academic
change, ensuring that students are
at the core of these groups."
"This conversation around the
SUES report is more serious than
quarrels about IHUM and PWR
its about supporting and empower
ing the students to become strong,
empathetic leaders," Fetter said.
