# A 						sports writer's dilemma
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Disillusioned is one way
to describe my cur
rent relationship with
the sports-writing in
dustry. As a graduat
ing senior and new member of the
legal-drinking community, I'm still
far too young to provide nostalgic
anecdotes about the landscape that
once was. Sports journalism is what
it is. Whether you appreciate its
current state or the direction it is
going is another story.
There's a distinct, objective line
between sports and reality. This
separation is what has kept me a
shotgun passenger on the prover
bial bandwagon since my pre
school days. The beauty of fandom
is that we experience authentic
emotion without authentic conse
quence, Life doesn't always allow
for cliched shots at redemption. In
sports, there's always tomorrow.
Recently, we've been captivated
by a new era of journalism that has
blurred this line. Sports are so easi
ly accessible that the most passion
ate followers fall into a pattern of
addiction that demands new infor
mation at the snap of a finger. I'm
as guilty as the next person of trawl
ing Twitter for hours, digging for
even the slightest suggestion that
my irrational sports-related
dreams may come true. Those hints
are, more often than not, rumors
concocted by the least reputable of
sources, whose Internet presence is
exactly what turned the writer
reader dynamic sour.
Nearly every media organiza
tion, The Daily included, that at
tempts to do its due diligence to en
sure appropriateness and objectiv
ity has been accused of sensational
ism. It's a frequent claim that,
grounded or not, occasionally re
quires attention. Is this because the
nature of the industry has evolved
to almost always require some sort
of slant? Perhaps, especially when
factoring in the race for page views
and advertising dollars on the web.
But an even larger problem, one
that is nearly always ignored, is the
average fan's meshing of life and
sports to the point where overall
satisfaction is impossible. When
athletes excel in their craft, the
masses flock, allowing our favorite
stars to reap the benefits of celebri
ty status. Yet when those same ath
letes falter off the field, when trans
gressions become public and pic
ture-perfect lives become slightly
tarnished, the media is crucified for
not recognizing them as people,
just like you and me.
So what are sports journalists to
do? Should they ignore the ex
tracurricular lives of athletes
whose actions off the field may
very well impact in-game perform
ance? That would be considered ir
responsible, especially in the afore
mentioned situation we find our
selves in as fans. If a readership is
connected enough to voice a con
stant demand for additional infor
mation, then it is the role of a media
organization to provide its readers
with that news when it is pertinent
and reported professionally.
This isn't to say that stars
shouldn't be graced with privacy;
I'm one of the biggest opponents of
sports tabloidization that you'll
find. Tiger's extramarital affairs
and Josh Hamilton's struggles with
addiction are personal matters that
should be kept private. But that is
my opinion. I don't watch sports to
idolize other people and fret over
their mistakes. They are people.
They are bound to make mistakes.
However, if an athlete perform
ing in a public forum makes a deci
sion that impacts future success in
dividually and collectively, the
modern fan demands the right to
know. Emotional investment is so
intense that there is no longer the
distinction between superficial le
gitimacy and real, life-changing,
life-or-death legitimacy.
As a result, media outlets have
become scapegoats for an issue
that is much larger than words writ
ten on paper. Fans and athletes
must learn to discern fact from fic
tion. If the spike in TMZ-esque
sports coverage is troublesome,
athletes must not vocalize a special
sense of entitlement, and specta
tors must not feed the growing
celebrity culture. As it stands, both

parties want to have a ton of cake
and eat it too, and writers are strug
gling to find an appropriate recipe
that accurately captures all sides of
the issues.
This isn't a problem that is
going to fix itself soon. As the
world becomes more publicly and
socially connected, the nature of
being human will be more candid
ly and crudely exposed. Through
our loyalty, we've earned the right
as fans to have more access into the
lives of the players we admire than
we did before, especially as their

desire for fame grows. That is no
longer debatable. Now what we
must do is acknowledge the differ
ence between relevant reporting
and sensationalized gossip. It's not
always the most well-defined
boundary, but it most definitely ex
ists.
It's not a lesson that is easily
learned, but we can't always kill the
messenger just because we don't
like the message.
