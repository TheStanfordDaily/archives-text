# SWIMMING FOR NO. 31
## CONFERENCE TITLE STREAK ON THE LINE 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
When the inaugural Pac-12
Swimming Championship splash
es off today, the Stanford men's
swimming and diving team will
begin the four-day quest to win its
31st consecutive conference title.
Significant challenges stand in the
way of the Card's victory howev
er, including the No. 1 team in the
country.
Stanford's impressive streak of
titles dates back to 1982, and the
team's dominance of its confer
ence has also translated to success
on the national stage. In the span of
three decades, Stanford has fin
ished in the top three at the N CAA
championship 26 times and never
worse than fourth place.
Much of the program's success
can be attributed to the calm and
steady manner in which head
coach Skip Kenney, a 21-time con
ference coach of the year, has
guided his team. Under Kenney's
management, the team won 30
straight Pac-10 titles as well as
seven national crowns.
This weekend, No. 3 Stanford
(7-1,3-1 Pac-12) will have the op
portunity to extend the length of
its conference dominance in the
pool.
But continuing the streak
won't be easy for the Cardinal this
time around. Fittingly, the biggest
obstacle will be the No. 1 Arizona.
When the two teams clashed ear
lier this season in a dual meet, the
Wildcats came out with the victo
ry, edging out the Cardinal by a
mere eight points.
In arguably the toughest con

ference in college swimming,
Stanford will have other elite
teams to deal with in addition to
Arizona, as No. 5 USC and No. 6
Cal will certainly be in contention
for the coveted conference title.
At the forefront of the Cardi
nal's distance lineup is senior
Chad La Tourette, who is vying for
his fourth straight conference title
in the 1650-yard freestyle. La
Tourette has been one of the most
dominant distance swimmers in
college swimming history, losing
only twice during his entire col
lege career in the 1650 and
those two losses were runner-up
finishes in two NCAA champi
onship meets.
Going into the conference
championship, La Tourette is the
fastest Pac-12 swimmer in the
1650 by over 10 seconds. La
Tourette is the only Stanford
swimmer who is carrying a No. 1
seed into the meet. In the 500-
yard freestyle, the Stanford veter
an owns the third seed, behind top
swimmer Matthew Barber from
Arizona. While Barber is seeded
nearly three seconds ahead of La
Tourette, the Cardinal senior won
the head-to-head battle against
Barber in the teams' dual meet
earlier this season.
Another key veteran for Stan
ford is senior Bobby Bollier. The
butterfly specialist won the con
ference title in the 200-yard but
terfly in 2009 and 2010, as well as
the 400-yard individual medley
last year. Bollier's top competi
tion will come from Cal junior
Tom Shields, who is the defending
Pac-10 champion in the 200 but
terfly.
Mixed with the senior experi
ence is the young talent that the
Cardinal boasts. Freshman David
Nolan could be the wild card in

determining whether Stanford
will claim the conference crown
or not. On paper, Nolan's fifth
seed in the 200-yard individual
medley, fourth seed in the 100-
yard butterfly and seventh seed in
the 100-yard backstroke may not
seem all that impressive, but
Nolan has proven his ability to
step up on the big stage. Last year,
as a high school senior, Nolan
made a statement to the swim
ming world by breaking three in
dividual high school national
records and clocking a time in the
200 individual medley that would
have won the NCAA champi
onship.
The diving segment of the
meet was completed last week
end, and the Stanford squad came
up big. Senior captain Taylor Sishc
finished second and third in the 3-
meter and 1-meter springboard,
respectively. Freshman Connor
Kuremsky also notched two
fourth-place finishes on the
springboard while sophomore
Noah Garcia led the Cardinal
with a fifth-place finish on the
platform. Their stellar perform
ances racked up 147 points for
Stanford, well ahead of Arizona's
97. The swimmers will look to
maintain the lead spotted by their
diving teammates.
"It's time to swim fast and win
races," Kenney said, summing up
his squad's mentality in one sim
ple sentence.
And maybe then, the streak of
30 will become 31.
The 2012 Pac-12 Men's Swim
ming Championships at the King
County Aquatic Center in Feder
al Way, Wash, will start at 6 p.m.
today and conclude on Saturday.
