## Alumnus arrested in West Bank released on bail 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
Fadi Quran 'lO, a Palestinian-
American Stanford alumnus arrest
ed in Hebron, West Bank Friday, was
released from Israeli custody Tues
day on a bail of 3,000 shekels. He is
now home with his family, according
to his sister Semma Qura'an, in a
tweet to The Daily. Quran's release
came after he was refused bail during
an initial trial on Monday.
According to liana Stein, deputy
spokesperson for the Israel Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, Quran was arrest
ed Friday by military security forces
and was subsequently transported
into the custody of Israeli police.
"Fadi Quran was arrested on the
charge of obstructing a law enforce
ment officer, assault and resisting ar

rest," Stein wrote in an email to The
Daily two hours after news of
Quran's bail surfaced on Twitter
early Tuesday morning. Stein also
said that several of the protesters at
Friday's event were violent.
"Approximately 1,000 Palestini
ans gathered at a number of flash
points, hurled two Molotov cocktails,
set fire to a tire and bombarded secu
rity forces with rocks," Stein wrote.
Two Palestinian protesters who
were also arrested with the Stanford
alumnus have not received bail and
will face a hearing on Thursday,
Qura'an said.
An Israeli judge decided to grant
Quran bail while the Israeli Defense
Force (IDF) prosecutor continued to
review video evidence of the case.
"The IDF prosecutor still insists
that the video has been doctored and

that they need to keep Fadi an extra
couple of days until they analyze it
thoroughly," Qura'an wrote in a
Facebook message to The Daily be
fore her brother's release. "The judge
then said that there is no need to
keep Fadi incarcerated if they want
ed to further investigate the video
and that he should be allowed out on
bail until anything new surfaces."
Stein stated that the protest in
which Quran participate was illegal
because it was not authorized by the
military.
"Demonstrations in Judea and
Samaria [the official Israeli designa
tion for the region including Hebron]
can take place once authorized by
the military authorities," Stein wrote.
"In this specific case, no authoriza

tions were requested and as such,
the demonstration was not au

Assaf Sharon Ph.D/09, who is
currently in Israel, told Stanford
students that Quran's judicial
process is not yet over.
"Just to clarify Fadi was re
leased from custody, but this does
not mean that no charges will be
pressed," Sharon wrote in an
email to the Stanford Students for
Palestinian Equal Rights (SPER)
mailing list. "The matter is official
ly still under investigation and
they may decide to indict."
The U.S. Consulate in
Jerusalem confirmed knowledge
of a U.S. citizen's arrest on Friday
and said they were providing "ap
propriate consular services", how
ever declined to comment further

citing privacy laws. Spokespeople
for the Israeli Defense Forces did
not respond to The Daily's re
quest for comment.
ASSU and University response
ASSU representatives began
drafting a resolution Sunday
evening to call for Provost and
Acting President John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 to issue a
public statement in support of fair
legal treatment and the immedi
ate release of Quran.
Etchemendy wrote to The
Daily on Monday that his office
does not intend to make a public
announcement.
"We are looking into this situa
tion through appropriate chan
nels," Etchemendy said. "We will
not be making a public statement
or signing petitions, which would
not be appropriate."
The status of the resolution re
mained unclear during the day
Tuesday, leading up to the weekly
ASSU Senate meeting, as sena
tors awaited news from Quran's
trials.
"We might change the lan
guage of the resolution and dis
cuss it and we might not because
technically, he's been released,"
said Senator and SPER member
Samar Alqatari 'l4.
The bill, authored by Alqatari
and Senator Janani Ramachan
dran 'l4 and co-sponsored by
Rafael Vasquez 'l2, originally
called for the ASSU to express
public support and concern for
Quran during his legal process, for
Etchemendy to issue a public
statement to the media in support
of Quran and for the Stanford
community to continue to reach
out to alumni in the region of Is
rael and Palestine, according to an
email Ramachandran sent to the
SPER mailing list prior to Tues
day's ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate meeting.
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate debated Tuesday until past
midnight a version of the bill ex
pressing concern for Quran's wel
fare and urging his release from
Israeli custody, while also request
ing a public statement to the same
effect from Provost and Acting
President John Etchemendy
Ph.D.'B2.
Following three hours of heat
ed discussion addressing concerns
about the bill's factual basis and
unifying impact on the University
community, the measure de
spite significant amendments
ultimately failed by one vote to
garner the required two-thirds ap
proval.

Fadi Quran 'lO, a Palestinian-
American Stanford alumnus arrest
ed in Hebron, West Bank Friday, was
released from Israeli custody Tues
day on a bail of 3,000 shekels. He is
now home with his family, according
to his sister Semma Qura'an, in a
tweet to The Daily. Quran's release
came after he was refused bail during
an initial trial on Monday.
According to liana Stein, deputy
spokesperson for the Israel Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, Quran was arrest
ed Friday by military security forces
and was subsequently transported
into the custody of Israeli police.
"Fadi Quran was arrested on the
charge of obstructing a law enforce
ment officer, assault and resisting ar

rest," Stein wrote in an email to The
Daily two hours after news of
Quran's bail surfaced on Twitter
early Tuesday morning. Stein also
said that several of the protesters at
Friday's event were violent.
"Approximately 1,000 Palestini
ans gathered at a number of flash
points, hurled two Molotov cocktails,
set fire to a tire and bombarded secu
rity forces with rocks," Stein wrote.
Two Palestinian protesters who
were also arrested with the Stanford
alumnus have not received bail and
will face a hearing on Thursday,
Qura'an said.
An Israeli judge decided to grant
Quran bail while the Israeli Defense
Force (IDF) prosecutor continued to
review video evidence of the case.
"The IDF prosecutor still insists
that the video has been doctored and

that they need to keep Fadi an extra
couple of days until they analyze it
thoroughly," Qura'an wrote in a
Facebook message to The Daily be
fore her brother's release. "The judge
then said that there is no need to
keep Fadi incarcerated if they want
ed to further investigate the video
and that he should be allowed out on
bail until anything new surfaces."
Stein stated that the protest in
which Quran participate was illegal
because it was not authorized by the
military.
"Demonstrations in Judea and
Samaria [the official Israeli designa
tion for the region including Hebron]
can take place once authorized by
the military authorities," Stein wrote.
"In this specific case, no authoriza

tions were requested and as such,
the demonstration was not au

Assaf Sharon Ph.D/09, who is
currently in Israel, told Stanford
students that Quran's judicial
process is not yet over.
"Just to clarify Fadi was re
leased from custody, but this does
not mean that no charges will be
pressed," Sharon wrote in an
email to the Stanford Students for
Palestinian Equal Rights (SPER)
mailing list. "The matter is official
ly still under investigation and
they may decide to indict."
The U.S. Consulate in
Jerusalem confirmed knowledge
of a U.S. citizen's arrest on Friday
and said they were providing "ap

citing privacy laws. Spokespeople
for the Israeli Defense Forces did
not respond to The Daily's re
quest for comment.
ASSU and University response
ASSU representatives began
drafting a resolution Sunday
evening to call for Provost and
Acting President John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 to issue a
public statement in support of fair
legal treatment and the immedi
ate release of Quran.
Etchemendy wrote to The
Daily on Monday that his office
does not intend to make a public
announcement.
"We are looking into this situa
tion through appropriate chan
nels," Etchemendy said. "We will
not be making a public statement
or signing petitions, which would
not be appropriate."
The status of the resolution re
mained unclear during the day
Tuesday, leading up to the weekly
ASSU Senate meeting, as sena
tors awaited news from Quran's
trials.
"We might change the lan
guage of the resolution and dis
cuss it and we might not because
