### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
Fadi Quran 'lO, a Palestinian-
American Stanford alumnus arrest
ed in Hebron, West Bank Friday, was
released from Israeli custody Tues
day on a bail of 3,000 shekels. He is
now home with his family, according
to his sister Semma Qura'an, in a
tweet to The Daily. Quran's release
came after he was refused bail during
an initial trial on Monday.
According to liana Stein, deputy
spokesperson for the Israel Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, Quran was arrest
ed Friday by military security forces
and was subsequently transported
into the custody of Israeli police.
"Fadi Quran was arrested on the
charge of obstructing a law enforce
ment officer, assault and resisting ar

rest," Stein wrote in an email to The
Daily two hours after news of
Quran's bail surfaced on Twitter
early Tuesday morning. Stein also
said that several of the protesters at
Friday's event were violent.
"Approximately 1,000 Palestini
ans gathered at a number of flash
points, hurled two Molotov cocktails,
set fire to a tire and bombarded secu
rity forces with rocks," Stein wrote.
Two Palestinian protesters who
were also arrested with the Stanford
alumnus have not received bail and
will face a hearing on Thursday,
Qura'an said.
An Israeli judge decided to grant
Quran bail while the Israeli Defense
Force (IDF) prosecutor continued to
review video evidence of the case.
"The IDF prosecutor still insists
that the video has been doctored and

that they need to keep Fadi an extra
couple of days until they analyze it
thoroughly," Qura'an wrote in a
Facebook message to The Daily be
fore her brother's release. "The judge
then said that there is no need to
keep Fadi incarcerated if they want
ed to further investigate the video
and that he should be allowed out on
bail until anything new surfaces."
Stein stated that the protest in
which Quran participate was illegal
because it was not authorized by the
military.
"Demonstrations in Judea and
Samaria [the official Israeli designa
tion for the region including Hebron]
can take place once authorized by
the military authorities," Stein wrote.
"In this specific case, no authoriza
