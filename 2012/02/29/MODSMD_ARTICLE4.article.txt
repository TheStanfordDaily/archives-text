## Romberg discusses Taiwan vote 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
Officials from the Chinese and
U.S. governments believe the results
of the Jan. 2012 Taiwanese presiden
tial election will benefit their respec
tive national interests, said Alan
Romberg, director of the East Asia
program at the Stimson Center, dur
ing a talk at the Center for Interna
tional Security and Cooperation
(CISAC) Tuesday night. He added,
however, that the future of Taiwan's
relationship with each of these
countries still remains uncertain.
The Center for Democracy, De
velopment, and the Rule of Law
(CCDRL) sponsored the talk, enti
tled "The Taiwan Presidential Elec
tion: Implications for Cross-Strait
Relations and U.S. Policy," as part of
its Democracy in Taiwan Project.
Larry Diamond, CCDRL direc
tor and senior fellow at the Hoover
Institute, introduced Romberg as
"one of the most distinguished and
knowledgeable scholars on East
Asia who enjoys respect on both
sides of the political spectrum in Tai
wan."
Romberg has served as a fellow
on the Council of Foreign Relations
and as a U.S Foreign Service Officer
for 20 years. He has held key posi
tions in the State Department, in
cluding Deputy Director of Policy
Planning Staff, Director of the Of
fice of Japanese Affairs and a place
ment on the National Security
Council for China.
Romberg began his talk by giv
ing an overview of Taiwan's political
scene and the dynamics and statis
tics of the recent Jan. 14 election,
which resulted in President Ma
Ying-Jeou being re-elected for a
second-term.
Ma is a member of the country's
Guomindang (GMD) Party, one of
two main political parties in Taiwan.
According to Romberg, GMD ad
vocates a friendly but cautious rela
tionship with China. He said the
party's main opponent, the Demo
cratic Progressive Party (DPP), has
a more pro-Taiwanese independ
ence stance and holds a suspicious
view of Taiwan's relationship with
China.
"Ma had a solid victory that will
lay a foundation for further
progress on all sides of this triangle
[U.S-China-Taiwan]," Romberg
said. "But his reduced margin of vic
tory compared to the 2008 elections
reflects the recovery of the DPP
and widespread ambivalence in Tai
wan about the performance and
policies of Ma."
According to Romberg, the
cross-strait conflict played a key
role in Ma's victory as voters were
"nervous about howTsai [the DDP
presidential candidate] would han
dle cross-strait relations."
He added that last-minute en
dorsements of Ma by prominent
Taiwanese businessmen caused a
surge in support for him, noting that
20 percent of voters made their vot
ing decisions a week before the
election.
Romberg emphasized that
while Ma's victory demonstrated

Taiwanese support for his policies
toward China, he must now address
widespread dissatisfaction over do
mestic policies.
He pointed out that a key issue
looming over the triangular rela
tionship between the U.S., China
and Taiwan is continuing U.S.
weapons sales to Taiwan, which irk
China.
"The U.S provides weapons to
Taiwan in order to assure Beijing
does not use force or coercion, but
China sees it as a method to limit its
rise," Romberg said.
In terms of the U.S. view of the
situation, Romberg pointed out two
prominent positions that have be
come popular. One advocates that
the United States stop selling
weapons to Taiwan in order to im
prove relations with China. The
other wants the United States to
embrace Taiwan more closely in
order to form a bulwark against
China's growing power.
"I believe neither position will
gain ascendancy or change U.S. pol
icy," Romberg said.
After the talk, the audience
raised questions on a range of issues
from the fairness of the democratic
system in Taiwan to the diversifica
tion of Taiwanese economic invest
ment in Asia.
"I attended this event because I
am very interested in U.S.-China re
lations," said audience member
Reagan Thompson 'l2, "I noticed
that he [Romberg] had a very confi
dent assessment of the U.S-China-
Taiwan relationship, which is en
couraging."
