## Alumnus debuts HBO political film 
### ETHAN KESSINGER 
While reminding the audience that the film is
not a "time machine," Jay Roach '79 stated fol
lowing a pre-screening Tuesday night in Cemex
Auditorium that his upcoming HBO film "Game
Change" is all "factually accurate".
The film which tracks Republican presi
dential candidate John McCain's decision to
choose Sarah Palin, then-governor of Alaska, as
his running mate during the 2008 election has
recently been under attack by Palin's aides as
"manipulating history." McCain told a group of
Republican activists Saturday that he would not
watch the film.
Stanford community members, however, re
acted very positively to the film at the Tuesday
night screening, which marked the first public
showing of the film. The screening was followed
by a question and answer session with Roach, the
film's director and executive producer.
"It brought back a lot of memories," said
Austin Caldwell 'l5 of the film. "However, I also
felt an emotional connection to Sarah Palin that
I never would have thought was possible."
"Game Change" is a movie adaptation of a
book written by political journalists John Heile
mann and Mark Halperin about the 2008 presi
dential election. The book is divided into three
parts: the Democratic primary race, the Republi
can primary race and the general election be
tween John McCain and Barack Obama.
The title of the film is explained at the begin
ning of the film when McCain's chief strategist
Steve Schmidt, played by Woody Harrelson,
gives one possible answer as to why Palin was
chosen as the vice presidential nominee, "We
desperately need a game changing pick, and
none of these middle aged white guys are game
changers."
After the packed auditorium of students,
alumni and guests watched the film, a much
smaller crowd stayed behind for a more intimate
conversation with Roach.
Roach said his fascination with
Sarah Palin began when he saw
the initial announcement that
Palin had been chosen as Mc-
Cain's running mate. He added
that he immediately wanted to get
a better look into why this deci
sion was made.
According to Roach, he first
pitched the film idea to HBO dur
ing the election and was turned
down. However, after HBO
bought the rights to the book
"Game Change," Roach was
given an opportunity to explore
what he saw as a story that "elec
trified the country."

Roach said he has been contin
ually criticized for casting Julianne
Moore as Sarah Palin. In response,
he commented, "It would be too

easy to go for the iconic Sarah Palin
... I had always thought that there
was probably a lot more than
meets the eye."
He said that while actresses
like Tina Fey did incredible imper
sonations of Palin, he knew that
Moore would offer an interpreta
tion with depth.
While he is best known for
movies such as "Austin Powers"
and "Meet The Parents," this is not
Roach's first political movie. He
won an Emmy for Best Direction
in a TV Movie in 2008 for "Re
count," about the 2000 presiden
tial election.
Roach said that through his
work on "Recount," he created re
lationships with lawyers and staff
at various news agencies. Due to
that experience, he noted that he
was given a lot of leeway to splice
real campaign footage with
footage of the actors.
According to Roach, scenes in
cluding the Republican National
Convention could not have been

possible on the movie's budget
without this cutting-and-pasting
technique.
There were many questions
about the accuracy of the film, but
Roach adamantly defended his
work.
"All of it is factually accurate,"
he said. "We were super skeptical
of anything that anyone told us,
and we double, triple checked."
He added, however, that there
will always be aspects that are
open to interpretation. While
John McCain and Sarah Palin
have publicly come out against
the film, Roach said that most
people who were present during
the campaign verified the events
as portrayed.
Stanford in Government and
the Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education hosted the pre
screening. "Game Change" pre
mieres on HBO on Sat., Mar. 10.
