## SFPD, SJPD address trafficking 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER DESK EDITOR 
During a panel discussion Tuesday night at the
Bechtel Conference Center, Bay Area law enforce
ment officers discussed how changes in the approach
and investigation of human trafficking by local San
Jose and San Francisco departments have increased
the level of efficacy in addressing these issues.
"Human trafficking in the Bay Area is alive and
well," said John Vanek, a retired lieutenant of the San
Jose Human Trafficking Task Force at the talk, which
was hosted by the Freeman Spogli Institute for Inter
national Studies.
According to Vanek, the San Jose task force was
one of the first in the nation to receive funding from
the U.S. government to combat human trafficking in
2006. He said the unit's four goals are to identify and
rescue victims of trafficking, prosecute offenders, train
law enforcement officers and raise community aware
ness.
Human trafficking crimes are often revealed be
cause of restaurant and wage dispute issues, domestic
violence and identity fraud cases, according to Sgt.
Kyle Oki, a member of the San Jose task force.
For this reason the San Francisco Police Depart
ment (SFPD), represented by Capt. Antonio Parra,
has integrated a dozen specialized investigative disci
plines, under one roof and one commanding officer,
into a Special Victims Unit, created in Oct. 2011. Capt.
Parra is the commanding officer of the SVU.
The unit, with a mission to "investigate crimes of
abuse, in its various forms, committed against our most
vulnerable," incorporates 12 specialized investigative
disciplines including child abuse, domestic violence,
sex crimes, human trafficking, missing persons,
vice/first offender, prostitution, registered sex offend
ers, Internet crimes against children, financial crime,
psychological liaison and elder abuse."
According to Capt. Parra, the centralization of

these disciplines "gives versatility and a team approach
to investigations which has been very effective."
"We're successful [at helping victims] because we
changed our philosophical approach," Capt. Parra
continued.
Sgt. Arlin Vanderbilt said that the SFPD "begins
with a focus on the victim, not just the prosecution."
His colleague, Lt. Jason Fox, also stated that crime sus
pects may be re-categorized as human trafficking vic
tims.
Of the reported human trafficking victims in the
South Bay, 80 to 90 percent are women, with ages rang
ing from 14 to 60, according to Sgt. Oki. He added that
in San Jose, 80 percent of victims originate from labor
trafficking as opposed to the sex trade. The girls that
are trafficked through the sex trade usually protest to
the police officers that they are "in love with the pimp,"
which make them reluctant to talk to law enforcement,
he added.
Sgt. Oki emphasized that these girls are "locally
born in San Jose and Oakland" and are often manipu
lated by men when they are 14 or younger.Two girls re
cently rescued, he said, were transported from San
Jose, to Los Angeles, to Virginia and finally to Balti
more.
"There are victims everywhere and people need to
be vigilant," Sgt. Oki added.
According to Vanek, a recent survey of recovered
victims showed that there were, on average, eight or
nine times when someone could have saved the victim
earlier but no action was taken. He said that this hap
pens often because observers do not know what meas
ures to take.
"It's interesting to get a sense of the different per
spectives," said audience member Desmond Lim 'l4 of
the panel. "Learning what officers on the ground are
doing was very valuable."
