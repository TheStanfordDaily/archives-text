## PROFILE ROBERT DAWSON ART AS ACTIVISM 
### CARL ROMANOS 
Â£ { hotography was
V I la hobby from
early on," said
Robert Dawson,
an instructor of
photography who has been at
Stanford for 16 years. "I got my
first camera when I was about 10
and that really began a lifelong
love affair with taking images."
The road to becoming a pho
tographer may have begun with
an old-fashioned film camera, but
Dawson's path wasn't always so
clear. In fact, Dawson majored in
psychology in his undergraduate
days at UC Santa Cruz. After a
stint working in psychology, he
eventually realized his true pas
sion lay elsewhere.
"I was interested in the psy
chology of creativity why peo
ple create," Dawson said. "I even
tually made the decision that I'd
rather be creative then study peo
ple being creative."
Dawson then shifted direc
tions, going on to get his graduate
degree at San Francisco State in
the Interdisciplinary Creative
Arts program, which allowed him
to combine his interests in pho
tography and psychology. His the
sis involved the use of photogra
phy as a psycho-therapeutic tool
in mental hospitals. He became a
teacher, but still harbored desires
to hone his photography skills.

Meeting renowned photogra
pher Ansel Adams was a turning
point in Dawson's growth as a
photographer.
"He had this policy that as a
young photographer if you came
to his house at five o'clock on Fri
day and had a cocktail with him,
he'd give you feedback," Dawson
said. "He was very good for me
[as] a model of how he made this
idea of being a photographer
work in his life."
By imitating Adams, Dawson
learned the craft of photography,
but he eventually began to move
beyond Adams' style as he real
ized the full capabilities of pho

tography as a mode of social ac
tion. His experience with the
Mono Lake conservation strug
gle truly cemented his passion for
photography.
"It was kind of this epic battle
between a small group of bird
watchers and the city of L. A. over
the draining of this lake and even
tually the birdwatchers won,
which was fantastic," Dawson
said.
The event made him realize
how photography could be used
to raise awareness of a place and
as a tool for environmental and
political activism.
Over the course of his career,
Dawson has worked on numer
ous projects using photography
to elucidate certain ideas or con
cepts, some of which have been
featured in the Smithsonian and
the Museum of Modern Art.
Dawson's current "American
Public Library" project aims to
bridge the gaps in the divisive po
litical and societal cultures of the
United States through his por
trayal of the public library institu
tion as a unifying system. He vis
ited 26 states, drove 11,000 miles
and photographed 189 libraries
while driving across the country
with his son last summer for the
project.
"One of the things I came
away with was that we have much
more in common as a country
than what separates us," Dawson
said.
Some of Dawson's other proj
ects have included acting as pho
tographer-in-residence for the
city of San Jose, examining water
pollution control. His "Farewell,
Promised Land" project sought
to foster appreciation for the im
portance of the Central Valley,
where Dawson grew up.
The irony is that Dawson first
connected to nature as away to
escape the Central Valley. As a
teenager, he would go to
Yosemite to find beautiful land
scapes he felt were lacking at
home,
"I felt nature was something
that was pretty spectacular, and it
was very moving to me," Dawson
said.
"I went to school at UC Santa
Cruz. Built in the redwood trees,
right on the edge of open mead
ows, you get these views of the
Monterey Bay. It's spectacular,"
he added. "That was for me, the
ideal."
During his career, Dawson has
worked on numerous projects
dealing with the environment,
many of which focused on affect
ing people's perception of their
environment. The use of photog
raphy as a form of communica
tion and change is a concept he
attempts to pass on to his stu
dents through teaching.
Dawson said he believes that
teaching new generations to ef
fectively use images to convey
ideas is vital to the future.
"It's kind of like a form of lan
guage, it's away of communicat
ing ideas. We are increasingly a vi
sually-oriented culture," Dawson
said. "Images are even more criti
cal than they have been in the
past. This is one reason why I
think our photography classes are
so popular here."
The introduction to photogra
phy class that Dawson teaches
gives students hands-on opportu
nities to explore and learn pho
tography on their own.
"He taught us the craft [of
photography] and basically said
go make art," said Emma Joslyn
'l5, a student enrolled in Daw
son's class.
While teaching is one means
of passing on the art of photogra
phy as a tool of social activism,
Dawson strives to make his
unique take on the world univer
sally accessible.
"I use different types of tech
nology and different types of
photography as tools," Dawson
said. "Sometimes art can be ghet
toized into museums and gal
leries and academia and not real
ly engaged much with the greater
popular public. One reason my
work tends to look the way it
looks is because I like to reach a
broad audience."
