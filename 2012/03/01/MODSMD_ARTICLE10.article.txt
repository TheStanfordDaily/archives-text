### â€“ Natasha Weaser 
Ally Week" is a one-
/% week series of
/ 1 events designed to
/ 1 rally allies in sup
.Alport of Stanford's
LGBTQ community, held from
Feb. 27 to March 2. The Daily spoke
with Elizabeth Avendano 'l4, one
of the organizers of "Ally Week".
The Stanford Daily (TSD):What is
an "ally"?
Elizabeth Avendano (EA): Broadly
defined, an ally is somebody who
actively stands up for whatever
cause that they do not necessarily
identify with personally.
TSD:What is "Ally Week" and what
will it consist of?
EA:This is the first year Ally Week
is running. We have a variety of
events from panels in different
communities, like the Asian and
Latin communities, [to] a rally at
White Plaza at noon on Friday.
TSD:What is the goal of "Ally
Week"?
EA:Our goal is to have as many
people who support gay rights or
have gay friends as possible to ac
tively ally with us. Sometimes allies
don't know how to enter the com
munity so Friday especially will be a
symbolic way for them to be able to
join us and show their support.
TSD:What is the best way for Stan
ford students to support your ef
forts?
EA:Stanford students can [support

us] by coming to some of our events,
especially the rally, which is the
most important. There are also a lot
of ways on campus to combat ho
mophobia through various groups
and initiatives so we encourage stu
dents to take up these chances to
stand up for our queer communi
ties.
TSD:What makes "Ally Week" im
portant?
EA: Ally Week is important because
we are reaching outside the
LGBTQ community and showing
our support. We are excited to in
volve students and provide a forum
where they can ask questions and
talk about their issues and engage in
a conversation.
TSD:How do you respond to those
who may disapprove of "Ally
Week"?
E A:I think that they should come to
the events we have so that they can
engage in dialogue with the allies.
People often forget that a personal
connection in the issue can make
them see the situation very differ
ently. This does not mean that they
will change their mind but it is al
ways good to learn more about the
issues you agree or disagree with.
"Ally Week"is co-sponsored by the
Queer Straight Alliance, Stanford
Students for Queer Liberation,
Queer & Asian, Safe and Open
Spaces at Stanford, El Centro Chi
cano, La Familia de Stanford and
the LGBT Community Resource
Center.
