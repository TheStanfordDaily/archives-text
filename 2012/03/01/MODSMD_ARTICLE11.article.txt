# BUS-Y RIDE
## 
### – Natasha Weaser 
The Marguerite Shuttle, a fixture of
transportation on campus since
1973, is a free public service shuttle
that operates 15 lines at over 183
stops in and around campus.
It is managed by Stanford's Parking and
Transportation Services and provides over
5,000 rides daily, totaling over 1.4 million rides
per year.
The practice of offering free public trans
port is as old as the University itself. The Mar
guerite was named after a horse part of the
horse and 12-person buggy service that was the
original mode of transport from Palo Alto to
Stanford.
Today, transportation on campus has been
revolutionized. Marguerite riders can use a live
shuttle map, Myßus, or Near Field Communi
cation (NFC) technology and GPS to track
real-time Marguerite arrival information and
location from their laptops or mobile devices.
The fleet of buses runs partially on biodiesel.
In Feb. 2011, Stanford announced significant
changes to the Marguerite system, changing
routing and scheduling to increase efficiency
after two rounds of review based on feedback
from the Stanford community.
While some are satisfied with the Mar
guerite service and rely on it to reach locations

such as the Caltrain Station or the Stanford
Shopping Center, others are not fans of the
transport system, which they claim can be inef
ficient.
Paul Benigeri 'l5 reported an unpleasant
experience with the Marguerite.
" It took me 65 minutes to get to Trader Joe's
[in Town and Country Village] because the
driver missed the stop and ended up doing the
whole loop again."
Yet for some students without cars on cam
pus, the shuttle provides a valuable service.
"I travel on the Marguerite mostly for gro
cery runs, as the bags are too large to fit on my
bike," said Laila Chima 'l5. "It is always a great
experience. I like that the drivers are friendly,
shuttles are on time and it covers almost every
place on campus."
Stanford University Libraries (SUL) started
using the Marguerite for a more creative pur
pose this month: The "Marguerite Moment" is
the equivalent of an elevator pitch branded for
Stanford. SUL employees participating in a
customer service program will practice "Mar
guerite Moments," which ask employees to
imagine giving one-minute pitches to fellow
Marguerite riders.
