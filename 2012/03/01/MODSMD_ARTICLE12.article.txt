## OP-ED Shame on us 
### JEFF MENDELMAN '09 Jeff Mendelman met Fadi Quran '10 on a Stanford Overseas Seminar trip to India studying the nonviolent legacy of Gandhi 
We learned some great les
sons from the ASSU
Senate hearing on the
resolution to speak out for the
students in support of Fadi
Quran's release and plea to the Is
raeli government to drop the re
maining charges, but we have
nothing concrete to show for it.
Fadi would find a message of
hope in all this. He would have
been able to advocate better than
I for the Palestinian cause. He
would have been able to animate
the arguments and shake the
other side's humanity with the
perfect mix of force and gentle
ness. Fadi would have been able to
bring us all together, just like he
did when he was arrested in He
bron. However, I learned that
Fadi is special, and I am not Fadi,
not yet. So, shame on me. Here's
what I learned:
I learned that the folks who are
pro-Israeli are well intentioned.
Everyone loves Fadi, and every
one supports his mental and physi
cal well-being, but, that's our only
common ground. The folks who
are pro-Israeli, most associated
with the Stanford Israel Alliance
and Jewish Student Association at
Stanford, have unyielding faith in
the due process of Israeli law, and
were not willing to publicly ques
tion Israel's judicial system for
Palestinians. To me, that seems
pretty absurd. Consider this anal-
black man in the South is ac
cused of robbing a bank, but
there's video footage that shows
incontrovertibly that he walked by,
and did not enter the bank. Given
the history in our country, wouldn't
you want to urge those in power to
keep a watchful eye on that trial,

let alone question the charges
against him? Isn't that showing
love for your fellow human and
your country? But the pro-Israelis
last night weren't able to level crit
icism at the Israeli government
about their treatment of Palestini
ans, even when it was someone we
all know and love, Fadi.
I am a Jewish-American, and I
support universal human rights.
When I look at the situation in Is
rael-Palestine, it's clear to me that
there is a huge power dynamic at
play where Israelis largely benefit
at the expense of Palestinians. It
seems obvious to me. And I'm not
the only one even the Interna
tional Court of Justice found the
Separation Wall and the settle
ments to fundamentally break in
ternational saw set out in the
Fourth Geneva Convention. I still
haven't learned why that's so hard
for people to grasp. Why don't
people understand that occupa
tion is supposed to be temporary,
and while in effect, safeguard the
occupied population? Israel is
doing neither of these. I still
haven't learned how to engage all
of you out there who "abstain" on
this issue, like so many on the
ASSU Senate. So, shame on you,
shame on me, shame on us. I just
wonder, what would Fadi do? Or
better, what would you do? Take
a look at the failed Senate resolu
tion, imagine the "Israeli govern
ment" taken out and make your
own decision? Does your ASSU
Senate represent you?
