# What the ASSU Undergraduate Senate does, and can do better
## 
### IAN CHAN '14 ASSU Senator 
First I would like to thank Ed
ward Ngai for his column yes
terday on the ASSU and its
problems ("Wildly self-actualizing
next year's ASSU," Feb. 28). As pe
titions start floating around, it is
hard for me to accept that it was an
entire year ago that I first contem
plated a run for the ASSU Senate,
and have been proudly serving the
student body since April of last
spring. While I cannot speak for the
Executive, I believe it is important
for the Undergraduate Senate to
be clear about its functions and
place in the University.
The Senate serves the student
body in two main ways: appropria
tions and advocacy. The Appropri
ations Committee of the Senate
handles hundreds of budget re
quests and modifications each year
from student groups big and small.
As the gatekeepers of student
money, we closely adhere to our
funding policies and openly pub
lish our spending tracker to keep
student groups and ourselves ac
countable to the students.
This past month, the Senate has
been moving efficiently to advise
and approve over 60 Special Fees
budget requests, which will appear
on the spring election ballot. While
not glamorous or headline-grab
bing, senators spent hours each
week scrutinizing budgets line item
by line item in order to make sure
each dollar of student money is
spent correctly.
Advocacy is a general term that
encompasses everything else the
Senate does. Whether it is speaking
to Undergraduate Advising and Re
search (UAR) through the Academ
ic Affairs Committee about improv
ing peer and pre-major advising, or
expressing support for the residents
of Chi Theta Chi through the Advo
cacy and Student Life Committees,
senators together and individually
work behind the scenes to assist stu
dents.
I will be the first one to tell any of
you that the Senate has its limita
tions, and many objectives that my
colleagues and I set out during our
campaigns to achieve have not
been actualized due to administra
tive hurdles and other reasons, but
we strive to listen to the students, re
flect their opinion and hold the Ex
ecutive, as well as other branches of
student government, accountable.
This past year, among many
other things, the Senate held feed
back sessions with the Study on
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES) study group and
Judicial Review panel, made possi
ble two Stanford spring traditions
(Spring Fling and Blackfest), and

expressed support for the Califor
nia Dream Act and peaceful
protests against the University of
California police departments.
Where we as a body deemed it in
our constitutional scope to express
broad student opinion, we did.
But I will also acknowledge
some of the missteps that Ed right
ly pointed out. In this connected
age, it is indeed regrettable that our
website and Twitter feeds are not as
active and accessible as students
would expect and like to see. There
were multiple hurdles to getting the
website up and running last quarter,
and we are working hard to update
the materials. Our Communica
tions Committee is committed to
expanding the Twitter presence in
the near future and updating the
website in the next week.
In the end, ASSU self-actual
ization has to be a two-way ex
change. While the Senate as a
whole can improve its online pres
ence and physical outreach, and I
for one would love to meet with
anyone to speak about our work,
students who are concerned and
interested have the ability to do so.
Our weekly meetings on Tuesday
at 8:30 p.m. in Nitery 209 are open
to the public, and as seen by yes
terday's attendance by the Chi
Theta Chi house and students con
cerned about specific bills we were
discussing, our weekly meetings
can be a forum for student feed
back and interaction.
This week, my colleague and I
drafted a one page Senate 101
aimed at expressing the basics of
what the Senate is and its commit
tees. This is one of many ways we
believe we can better reach stu
dents, and as the petition and elec
tion season goes under way, I
strongly urge any who wish to
know more to seek out any of us to
express your concerns.

TheASSUs
self-actualization
has to be a two
way exchange.
