# SEEING GREEN
## All that's holey 
### Holly Moeller 
NEW BRIGHTON, N.Z. It
was a cloudy day at the
beach when I got my first
New Zealand sunburn, butter-
Hied across my chest between the
straps of my halter-top and the
collar of my sweater. Having been
sunburnt only twice before (while
dozing under a full sun), I'd disre
garded warnings, neglected sun
screen and would now pay the toll
in embarrassment.
New Zealanders, however,
take sun safety seriously. The
country's high latitude intensifies
the summer sun, and fragments of
the Antarctic ozone hole some
times drift overhead, allowing
extra doses of cancer-inducing ul
traviolet rays to reach Earth's sur
face. As a result, New Zealand's
skin cancer rate is among the
highest in the world. Skin cancers
represent 80 percent of cancer di
agnoses in the country, with close
to 70,000 new cases diagnosed
each year.
Therefore, Kiwis adhere to the
"Slip, Slop, Slap" regimen of pub
lic-service announcement fame:
Slip on long-sleeves, slop on sun
screen and slap on a hat. Beyond

that, sit tight while the ozone hole
closes.
It will take decades for the
ozone layer, the stratospheric
band of ultraviolet-absorbing 0 3
molecules, to fully recover from
the chemical insults piled upon it
by humans during the 20th centu
ry, when we added billions of tons
of chlorofluorocarbons and other
halogenated gases to the strato
sphere. There, solar radiation
pops off free-radical chlorine
(and other pesky, reactive halo
gen) atoms, which skitter about,
colliding with ozone and breaking
it into diatomic oxygen (0 2 ),
which lacks the absorptive prop
erties of its allotrope.
In the process, the guilty chlo
rine radicals regenerate, allowing
the cycle to continue indefinitely
until, at last, two chlorine radicals
collide with one another by
chance, locking themselves into
Cl 2 gas and ending the cycle. In a
low-density atmosphere with few
of these radicals, this takes a long
time: A single chlorine radical can
destroy tens of thousands of
ozone molecules within its reac
tive lifetime.

So even though the Montreal
Protocol (signed by 164 countries
to regulate the production of
ozone-harming compounds) has
been in force since 1989, it has
taken more than two decades to
see convincing results.
Fortunately, the most severe
effects on the ozone layer are sea
sonal and localized. Ozone de
struction is enhanced in cold air
masses those usually found
over the poles, where polar
stratospheric clouds form. During
the Antarctic springtime, cold air
masses held stationary by the
polar vortex are exposed to their
first sunlight, and ozone levels
may be depleted by up to 80 per
cent. Since the frozen continent
isn't exactly a human population
center, we only worry about this
"Ozone Hole" when parts of it ex
