# MODERN MANNERS

Last week I wrote about how
we often don't know the
names of the people sitting
next to us in section, and that get
ting to know our classmates
would surely strengthen both our
learning and our community.
Upon reflection, I have realized
that I actually know a lot more
names than I do faces at Stanford,
thanks to the advent of the dorm
chat list.
Mass emails, once something I
rarely received, are now en
trenched in our daily lives. The
most prolific emailers, who are
often people I have never met,
seemingly turn to the chat lists for
their every need. Rather than ask
ing their neighbors, they beam
their requests for staplers and
textbooks and white dresses to
hundreds of people.
Most people are polite, but
being nice isn't necessary to get
what you want out of a chat list.
I've seen messages along the lines
of "Bring Scotch Tape, Rm 122.
EOM" that were followed min
utes later by "TAPE FOUND."

The same principle that makes
Internet spam profitable has led
me to wonder if a request sent to a
large enough dorm list (Crothers?
Roble?) will inevitably be ful
filled. I was tempted to test this
theory last year by writing, "Need

free World Series Tickets. Rm 235.
EOM," but I am an A's fan, and I
really had no desire to watch the
Giants win it all for the first time
in 56 years.
While not as healthy as face
to-face interaction, there are un
deniably some benefits to being
connected to others through a
chat list. Putting aside awareness
raising event fliers and job offers,
their primary advantage is enter
tainment value.
If you've never lived in a large
dorm, chances are that no one has
ever offered you "Belgium choco
late wafers or shrimp chips: you
choose" in exchange for lending
her your "schoolgirl skirt." You
have probably never witnessed
the online back-and-forth that oc
curs when someone leaves the
products of their pig dissection in
the dorm kitchenette. You are in
sulated from the charmingly mun
dane questions that mean so
much to the community, such as
"When are paninis served at

Mass emails, once
a rarity, are now
entrenched in our
daily lives.

Manz? eom" or the environmen
tal consciousness that led one stu
dent to offer her extra banana to
200 people rather than let it go to
waste. Perhaps most regrettably,
you haven't witnessed the evolu
tion of a supportive, virtual com
munity that enhances our physi
cal community.
For example: Have you no
ticed that cookies and brownies
are replacing the U.S. dollar as a
token of exchange among Stan
ford students? A recent search of
my email inbox found 43 chat-list
messages in which students of

fered cookies or brownies in ex
change for textbooks, ink car
tridges, leather tights and more.
The only problem with this trend
is that too many people are using
store-bought mixes instead of
making their baked goods from
scratch. Until the average batch
of dorm cookies improves signifi
cantly, not everyone is going to
participate in this new economy.
Despite the occasional curt
ness and some questionable culi
nary practices, I think it's great
that email is making friendly ex
changes between students who
don't know each other more com
mon.

kitchen recipes? Share them with
