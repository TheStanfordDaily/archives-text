# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## An atmosphere of intimidation 
### 
Dear Editor,
I never met Fadi Quran, but let
me congratulate him on his re
lease from an Israeli jail. His of
fense was minor, and whether or
not the Israelis judged him not a
terrorist and a threat by them
selves, which seems likely, or
whether protests 5,000 miles
away made a difference does not
matter.
Having said that, many ele
ments of the campaign to win his
release are disturbing. The most
troubling of these was the frankly
anti-Semitic content of the com
ments board under the various
online articles about Fadi.
Many of the comments dealt
with so-called Jewish control of
the media or government. Others
involved four letter words thrown
at those who did not accept, after
"discussion" prevailing opinions

about the various conflicts there.
Still others involved calls for the
world to boycott Israel based on
their arrest of Fadi for his role in a
riot in which Palestinians threw
Molotov cocktails at Israelis.
The only possible conclusion
from this board is that certain in
dividuals, possibly unconnected
to Stanford, hope to create an at
mosphere of intimidation and
fear for those who hold true to
views contrary to their own. The
more self-righteous and con
vinced these zealots are of their
cause, the more likely that physi
cal conflict will affect Stanford, as
it already has other institutions of
higher learning, as they debate
problems in the Middle East.
The editors should decide for
themselves whether to moderate
comments. The more important
issue is that the content of the de
bate has, bubbling under the sur
face, ugliness that has yet to be ac
knowledged.
