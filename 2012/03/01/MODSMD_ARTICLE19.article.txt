## SINKING SEATTLE CARD FINISHES PERFECT AT HOME 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At Maples Pavilion last night, Stanford fin
ished off the home schedule of the 2011-12
season, defeating nonconference opponent
Seattle University 76-52 and extening its un
blemished record at home to five straight sea
sons and 79 games.
The contest was the first-ever meeting be
tween No. 2 Stanford (26-1,17-0 Pac-12) and
Seattle (17-9), as the Redhawks returned to
Division I as independents in 2009 and will
join the Western Athletic Conference for next
season. It was also the last time that Stanford
fans will see graduating seniors Nnemkadi Og
wumike, Lindy La Rocque and Grace
Mashore play on their home court.
"I've been a part of several teams that have
been through Maples and to not lose on this
court is really special," Nneka Ogwumike said.
"I'm glad that I was able to share it with this
team. I wish for this for them because it's not
something that everyone can say everyday."
Five of the Card's players hit double digits
in points, led by Nneka Ogwumike's double
double of 19 points and 11 rebounds, com
pared to just one Redhawk, senior guard Tal
isa Rhea, who scored 18. Rhea, the reigning In
dependent Player of the Week, was a familiar
foe to many of Stanford's older players, as she
played three full seasons at Pac-12 rival Ore
gon State before transferring to Seattle. But in
eight career matchups, she has never tasted
victory over Stanford.
Though the Cardinal led by 14 points at the
break, the difference does not do justice to an
unranked Seattle team that forced a series of
errors from its more illustrious opponent. Per
haps this was not surprising given Seattle's
season six of its players have forced 30 or
more steals in games this year, while just three
Stanford players reached this mark. By the
first half buzzer, the Redhawks had six steals
to Stanford's four, just shy of the 6.1 average
steals per game by the Cardinal's opponents
throughout the whole season.
Although it stretched ahead of Seattle with
a couple of runs in the first half, the Redhawks
cut back at the Card's lead twice before Stan
ford pulled away for the 24-point victory.
"Tonight's not an easy situation," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer after the
game. "[Seattle head coach] Joan [Bonvicini]
is just a fabulous coach, Rhea has played here
before. Seattle comes in with nothing to lose,
they played very hard, they played very well."
In addition to a comfortable win, the chal
lenge of a tough midweek game provided the
Cardinal with a final tuneup before heading
across the Bay to take on archrival California
this weekend. VanDerveer said she was
pleased with the way the schedule worked out
this year.
"I think it's just a great game for us," Van-

Freshman guard Amber Orrange had 10 points and nine assists in the No. 2 Stanford women's
basketball team's victory over Seattle on Wednesday. For the fourth straight year, the Cardinal
ended its season undefeated at home, stretching its win streak in Maples Pavilion to 79 games.
