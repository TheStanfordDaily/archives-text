## Occupy Stanford to present letter Group drafts letter to be read at Occupy Education rally 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
The Occupy Stanford group
that has kept vigil in Meyer Library
since fall will present an open letter
during the Occupy Education Cal
ifornia rally at UC-Berkeley to
morrow. The group projects atten
dance at the rally to be in the tens of
thousands.
Occupy Education is an off
shoot of the Occupy Wall Street
movement specifically targeting
the rising cost of public universities,
seeking to make higher education
accessible for anyone.
"What I think, in the last month,
we've decided is that... education
is one of the most prominent things
to be concerned with," said Occupy
Stanford member Luke Wigren 'll
of the shift in the Occupy move
ment toward education. "Eventu
ally what we're going to be doing is
redefining education here at Stan
ford and making this a more acces
sible institution."
At a Wednesday night meeting
to draft the open letter, Occupy
Stanford members discussed
changing University attitudes from
focusing only on accruing money
and resources for use at Stanford,
to also sharing those resources with
others in education.
Occupy Education declared
Thursday a National Day of Action
entitled "Take Back Your Cam
pus" in support of public educa
tion. The Berkeley rally is at the
epicenter of the movement for the
Bay Area.
Some of the specific demands of
Occupy Education California are
the passage of The Millionaire Tax
of 2012 and the Tax Oil to Fund Ed
ucation Act. The first is a proposed
ballot initiative that would raise
taxes on the wealthiest Californi
ans, and the second is a measure
that would apply a 15-percent sev
erance tax on gas and oil extracted
from California. Revenue from
both would directly go toward sup
porting education.
The group also notes the dis
crepancy between California per
capita state prison spending, which
is first in the nation, and education
spending, which is 43rd in the na
tion. Occupy Education rejects
California Governor Jerry
Brown's proposed cuts to public
education funding.
Underlying these demands is
the rising cost of tuition to Califor
nia public universities. At Berke
ley, for example, yearly in-state un
dergraduate fees have risen over
500 percent in the last decade, from
just over 4,000 dollars to almost
14,500 dollars this academic year.
"[Education] is something that
should be available for everyone if
they wish to take that opportuni
ty," said Zoe Lidstrom 'l2, an Oc
cupy Stanford member.
The Stanford group, however,
opted to take a different approach
in its open letter from the usual po
litical demands. Acknowledging
that as a private school, state edu
cation funding does not directly af
fect students, the group chose in
stead to draft a more poetic letter

in solidarity with the movement's
cause. Members of the group will
take turns reading personal state
ments about their support for the
movement, hoping to include Stan
ford in the cause.
"There is no debate," Wigren
said of Stanford's presence in the
movement. "Right now we're try
ing to make the debate. We're com
mitting to make this debate
heard."
Others in the group focused on
the contributions that public edu
cation has to Stanford students'
lives, whether in K-12 education or
in society.
"I wouldn't be here if it weren't
for public school teachers being
underpaid to make sure that I un
derstood things," said Ben Wilson,
a doctoral candidate and an Occu
py member. "We're all a part of the
same education system."
Occupy members also empha
sized that private and public edu
cation will have to evolve together
as technology facilitates informa
tion sharing and learning.
"The future purpose of a uni
versity may be just a place where
people can come and engage in dis
course and pump out research and
talk about issues," Wilson said.
Occupy Education's National
Day of Action rally will begin this
morning at Berkeley. The event
will include teach-ins and a march
from Berkeley to Oakland.

14,500 dollars this academic year.
"[Education] is something that
should be available for everyone if
they wish to take that opportuni
ty," said Zoe Lidstrom 'l2, an Oc
cupy Stanford member.
The Stanford group, however,
opted to take a different approach
in its open letter from the usual po
litical demands. Acknowledging
that as a private school, state edu
cation funding does not directly af
fect students, the group chose in
stead to draft a more poetic letter

in solidarity with the movement's
cause. Members of the group will
take turns reading personal state
ments about their support for the
movement, hoping to include Stan
ford in the cause.
"There is no debate," Wigren
said of Stanford's presence in the
movement. "Right now we're try
ing to make the debate. We're com
mitting to make this debate
heard."
Others in the group focused on
the contributions that public edu
cation has to Stanford students'
lives, whether in K-12 education or
in society.
"I wouldn't be here if it weren't
for public school teachers being
underpaid to make sure that I un
derstood things," said Ben Wilson,
a doctoral candidate and an Occu
py member. "We're all a part of the
same education system."
Occupy members also empha
sized that private and public edu
cation will have to evolve together
as technology facilitates informa
tion sharing and learning.
"The future purpose of a uni
versity may be just a place where
people can come and engage in dis
course and pump out research and
talk about issues," Wilson said.
Occupy Education's National
Day of Action rally will begin this
morning at Berkeley. The event
will include teach-ins and a march
from Berkeley to Oakland.
