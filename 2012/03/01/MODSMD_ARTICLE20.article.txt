# DONS DOMINATED

### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
Back on the court for just the
second time since Feb. 12, the
Stanford women's tennis team
was in sore need for some match
play. However, no visible signs of
rust were on display on Wednes

day afternoon at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium, with pent-up en
ergy carrying the Cardinal to a
blowout 7-0 victory over the
University of San Francisco. Two
matches meant to take place this
past weekend against Cal Poly
and San Diego were postponed,
and yesterday's match against

USF was added to the schedule
to make up for the gap.
"I definitely came out to a
slow start today," sophomore
Nicole Gibbs said. "I think that's
exactly why we scheduled this
match, because we didn't want
that kind of lull in our schedule
before a big weekend with Cal
and Washington. A couple of us
were a little rusty."
Doubles highlighted the dom
inance of junior Mallory Bur
dette and Gibbs at the top as
they sprinted to an 8-0 win. The
pairings of junior Stacey Tan and
freshman EllenTsay,followed by
sophomore Kristie Ahn and sen
ior Veronica Li, both won by
identical 8-3 scores.
Stanford (6-0,1-0 Pac-12) was
rarely challenged against USF
(2-5) in singles. The closest set
came between Burdette and op
ponent senior Julia Wartenburg
er. Burdette won 6-4, but this
came after she was flawless in the
first set for the 6-0,6-4 win in the
end. At the top of the lineup,
Gibbs won 6-1, 6-3, noting that
she struggled a bit in the second
set.
"The challenge was in the
conditions today the weather
was sub-optimal," Gibbs said.
"There were a lot of potential
rain delays that didn't end up
happening. It started to sprinkle
a little bit, and it was super windy.
A few of us took a little bit of
time to adjust and to get through
unconventional and awkward
points."

At the bottom half of the line
up, Tsay and Li both only gave up
one game to record identical 6-0,
6-1 victories. Junior Natalie Dil
lon, in her fourth match this sea
son, put up an impressive per
formance with a 6-1,6-1 win over

Sophomore Kristie Ahn (above) and her partner Veronica Li won their
doubles match against USF 8-3, aiding No. 11 Stanford to a 7-0
sweep over the Dons. The Cardinal next faces No. 7 Cal this Friday.
junior Blair Reed to record her
first match win on the year.
"It feels great," said Dillon. "I
think it was a little difficult for me
coming back from being abroad,
but it's good to get the experience,
I'm taking each match seriously
and working up for NCAAs."
In addition to last minute
schedule changes, the Cardinal,
who entered the week ranked No.
1, was dropped to No. 11 in the
ITA's most recently released
rankings, which were compiled by
computer for the first time this
season. Stanford and Florida had
shared the top two spots all sea
son, with the Cardinal overtaking
the Gators for the top spot in a 5-
2 victory on Feb. 12. However, the
new rankings caused a major up
heaval, with both squads dropping
out of the top 10. Stanford came in
ranked No. 11 despite being unde
feated, and the Gators, who were
ranked No. 2 entering the week,
are now ranked No. 15.
"There had been all this mini

drama over the ITA rankings put
ting us at 11, which we find kind of
entertaining," Gibbs said. "It gives
us a bit of a chance to be some
what of an underdog against Cal,
who is ranked seventh currently.
It'll light a fire under us and give
us some motivation and drive to
show people what we're made of."
The top three now consists of
No. 1 UCLA, No. 2 USC and No. 3
Duke, and Stanford plays the Los
Angeles teams on April 13 and
April 14 at home, a key late-sea
son matchup for all three squads.
"We're looking very seriously
at those matches and really
preparing to play at our best for
that weekend," Dillon said. "The
Pac-12 overall looks very strong.
However, the rankings really
don't actively reflect who is at the
number one, two and three. They
don't accurately reflect rankings,
so as much as their current rank
ings seem intimidating, we try not
to concern ourselves with the
ranking system."
The Cardinal returns to action
this Friday against No. 7 Cal in
Berkeley.
