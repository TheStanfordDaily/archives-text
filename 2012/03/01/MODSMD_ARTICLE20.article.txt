### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
Back on the court for just the
second time since Feb. 12, the
Stanford women's tennis team
was in sore need for some match
play. However, no visible signs of
rust were on display on Wednes

day afternoon at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium, with pent-up en
ergy carrying the Cardinal to a
blowout 7-0 victory over the
University of San Francisco. Two
matches meant to take place this
past weekend against Cal Poly
and San Diego were postponed,
and yesterday's match against

USF was added to the schedule
to make up for the gap.
"I definitely came out to a
slow start today," sophomore
Nicole Gibbs said. "I think that's
exactly why we scheduled this
match, because we didn't want
that kind of lull in our schedule
before a big weekend with Cal
and Washington. A couple of us
were a little rusty."
Doubles highlighted the dom
inance of junior Mallory Bur
dette and Gibbs at the top as
they sprinted to an 8-0 win. The
pairings of junior Stacey Tan and
freshman EllenTsay,followed by
sophomore Kristie Ahn and sen
ior Veronica Li, both won by
identical 8-3 scores.
Stanford (6-0,1-0 Pac-12) was
rarely challenged against USF
(2-5) in singles. The closest set
came between Burdette and op
ponent senior Julia Wartenburg
er. Burdette won 6-4, but this
came after she was flawless in the
first set for the 6-0,6-4 win in the
end. At the top of the lineup,
Gibbs won 6-1, 6-3, noting that
she struggled a bit in the second
set.
"The challenge was in the
conditions today the weather
was sub-optimal," Gibbs said.
"There were a lot of potential
rain delays that didn't end up
happening. It started to sprinkle
a little bit, and it was super windy.
A few of us took a little bit of
time to adjust and to get through
unconventional and awkward
points."

At the bottom half of the line
up, Tsay and Li both only gave up
one game to record identical 6-0,
6-1 victories. Junior Natalie Dil
lon, in her fourth match this sea
son, put up an impressive per
formance with a 6-1,6-1 win over
