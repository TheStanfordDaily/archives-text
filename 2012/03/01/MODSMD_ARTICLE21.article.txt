## Fleener's draft stock rising fast 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
With the NFL Combine
over, the Stanford football
team's pro day in late March
and the NFL Draft not until
April, you'd think this would
be a good time for head coach
David Shaw to focus on the
2012 Cardinal, not the players
moving on to the NFL. But in
stead, his phone and the
phones of everyone else on the
coaching staff have been
ringing constantly.
Shaw, who spent nine years
in the NFL before coming to
Stanford, said he and the rest of
the Cardinal coaches have
been spending a lot of time
talking to NFL general man
agers and coaches over the last
few weeks.
"There's a lot of communi
cating going on [between NFL
personnel and] me, our offen
sive coordinator, our defensive
coordinator and our run game
coordinator," Shaw said on
Thursday. "All of us have a lot
of NFL experience a lot of
NFL ties, and they know that
when they call us we're going
to tell them the truth. And it
just so happens that we've got a
lot of good players going in this
draft that guys are excited
about."
When NFL coaches call,
they're often looking for infor
mation they can't get from
