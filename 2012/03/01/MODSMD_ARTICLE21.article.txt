## Fleener's draft stock rising fast 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
With the NFL Combine
over, the Stanford football
team's pro day in late March
and the NFL Draft not until
April, you'd think this would
be a good time for head coach
David Shaw to focus on the
2012 Cardinal, not the players
moving on to the NFL. But in
stead, his phone and the
phones of everyone else on the
coaching staff have been
ringing constantly.
Shaw, who spent nine years
in the NFL before coming to
Stanford, said he and the rest of
the Cardinal coaches have
been spending a lot of time
talking to NFL general man
agers and coaches over the last
few weeks.
"There's a lot of communi
cating going on [between NFL
personnel and] me, our offen
sive coordinator, our defensive
coordinator and our run game
coordinator," Shaw said on
Thursday. "All of us have a lot
of NFL experience a lot of
NFL ties, and they know that
when they call us we're going
to tell them the truth. And it
just so happens that we've got a
lot of good players going in this
draft that guys are excited
about."
When NFL coaches call,
they're often looking for infor
mation they can't get from
tapes, intangibles like a player's
locker room presence and their
ability to learn new systems
quickly.
"[NFL coaches] want to know
what they don't see on film," Shaw
said. "They want to talk about
character, they want to talk about
toughness, they want to talk about
practice and they want to talk
about how well does a guy learn."
Shaw said coaches were "sali
vating" over quarterback Andrew
Luck as well as linemen David
DeCastro and Jonathan Martin,
all of whom are expected to be se
lected in the first 20 picks of the
draft. Shaw also noted that there's
been a recent flurry of interest in
several other players, especially
tight end Coby Fleener.
Fleener's stock has been
shooting up draft boards and
mock drafts over the past several
weeks, and Shaw said that he'd be
"shocked" if Fleener wasn't
picked in the first round in April's
draft.
"I'd be surprised if he goes past
26 or 27," Shaw said, pointing to
picks that are currently held by
the Houston Texans and New
England Patriots. Shaw added
that the recent dominance of big,
speedy tight ends like Vernon
Davis, Jimmy Graham and Rob
Gronkowski has made Fleener an
especially interesting prospect.
"With what happened in the
playoffs, when you got the Niners'

tight end running by people, you
got the Saints' tight end running
by people, you got the Patriots'
tight ends running by people, and
then you turn on Coby's film and
that's all he does: run by people,"
Shaw said. "Just this playoff run I
think has bumped Coby's value
up a lot in this draft."
"It's not like you have to proj
ect it," Shaw continued. "You saw
him in a pro-style offense, you saw
him average 20 yards a catch, you
saw him score a whole bunch of
touchdowns and you saw him run
past defensive backs, not just line
backers."
In addition to Fleener's rising
draft stock, Shaw also said that
safety Delano Howell had been
another point of interest from
NFL staffers recently.
"Here's a guy that missed a lot
of time but still got voted as an all
conference safety, because when
he's on the field he's an impact
player," Shaw said. "He's a guy
that you can envision playing spe
cial teams, a guy you can envision
being your third safety early on,
and eventually being a starting
safety and a core special teamer."
Finally, Shaw stumped for wide
receiver Chris Owusu, who im
pressed at the NFL combine by
running a 4.36 second 40-yard
dash, the second-fastest time
among all players. Although
Owusu's draft stock is somewhat
unclear due to his issues with con

cussions throughout the course of
his career including three in
less than a year Shaw said he
had no trepidations about
Owusu's ability to play at the next
level.
"Not anymore, not after listen
ing to the doctors, and not after
listening to all the tests that Chris
has passed," Shaw said. "You start
getting nervous when a guy does
n't get hit very hard and gets a
concussion, and Chris hasn't had
any glancing blows. These have all
been legitimate, big-time hits
where he's gotten a concussion,
and it's always cleared up. The
doctors have said that there are
no lingering effects, there's no di
minished capacity and there's
nothing there that's a result from
the hits that he's taken."
"One of the biggest hits he
took was against USC, and that
wasn't a concussion, it was a
shoulder injury," he continued. "It
shows you that the guy can still
take a big hit and not have it be an
effect on his head."
For now, Owusu, Fleener, How
ell and others will have to wait
until March 22 to impress the NFL
scouts one more time, when the
Cardinal hosts its pro day on the
Farm. After that, the NFL draft be
gins Thursday, April 26th and con
cludes on Saturday, April 28.

Redshirt senior Coby Fleener has seen his draft stock rise rapidly over the course of the season. Fleener was
one of the Cardinal's most prolific threats this year, with 10 of his 34 catches going for touchdowns.
