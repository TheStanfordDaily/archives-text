# Beware the roadless traveled
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
If you were to take a quick
glance at Stanford baseball's
nonconference schedule be
fore the season started, the
trio of early home series
against highly ranked teams would
catch your eye instantly. This
weekend's three-game set at Fres
no State would pale in comparison
with the preseason No. 2 Cardi
nal's matchups with then-No. 12
Vanderbilt, No. 5 Texas and No. 7
Rice.
A lot of things have changed in
the last two weeks, not the least of
which is Stanford's 8-0 surge to
claim the No. 1 spot in this week's
coaches' poll. And even though the
Cardinal's weekend sweeps of the
Commodores and Longhorns look
less impressive now that those two
squads have both fallen well below
.500, there hasn't been much of an
answer for Stanford's high-octane
offense and stellar pitching in the
early going.
But as the Cardinal prepares to
head out on its first major road trip
of the season for a three-game stint
in Fresno, I'd be surprised if the
team escapes the weekend with its
perfect record still intact. Stanford
was a dominant 18-7 playing on the
Farm last season that's equiva
lent to taking two of three over the
weekend as well as the midweek
game but a mediocre 15-15 on
the road. The squad's one sweep
last year was at home, although it
was in position do the same at Cal
to close the regular season before
the third game was called due to
rain.
This Cardinal team sure looks
a lot better than last year's in
every area. Its bats have been on
fire since opening day. Its defense
has made less than half as many
errors as opposing squads. Its top
two starting pitchers are allowing
a hit just every other inning, and
talented freshman John
Hochstatter has looked like a vet
eran in the Sunday slot. And, of
course, a lineup that consisted al
most entirely of freshmen and
sophomores last season is now
full of experienced sophomores
and juniors with a Super Region
al run behind them.
Yet will any of that translate to
the road, where Stanford struggled
to pull out a 9-7 win in extra in
nings over unranked Pacific last
Tuesday?
With that question in mind, this
weekend's series is probably the
most important for Cardinal base
ball, at least before the squad
heads to Arizona to face the pro
jected Pac-12 runners-up Wildcats
in a month's time. In the long run,
it's more important than either
next week's showdown with No. 4
Rice or Stanford's two dominant
series wins over Vanderbilt and
Texas.
The reason is simple: Sunken
Diamond isn't in Omaha.
If the Cardinal meets its presea
son expectations it will host a re
gional, and if it keeps playing the
way it has to open the season, it
could host a Super Regional as
well. But no matter what, the Car
dinal is going to have to leave the
Stanford bubble, stay in a hotel and
remain competitive in a foreign
ballpark if it wants to compete for
the national title.
A weekend series at Fresno
State might not compare to the
grueling 12-day marathon that is
the College World Series. A 170-
mile bus ride to the Central Valley
isn't the same as a 1,700-mile plane
flight to the central United States.
And the Bulldogs who received
the 34th most votes in this week's
coaches' poll aren't exactly the
type of team you expect to be play
ing in late June.
But home success can only take
you so far, and this weekend Stan
ford has its only chance to establish
itself as a road warrior before the
highly competitive Pac-12 season
gets into full swing. After taking
two of three from Rice in Houston
to open the 2011 season, the Cardi
nal lost five of its next seven road
games. It can't afford to let that
happen again, with projected 2-4-5
Pac-12 finishers Arizona, UCLA
and Oregon State hosting Stanford
later this season.
So even though the Cardinal is
off to an impressive start, it can't
afford any letdown at Fresno State.
There's more than the squad's No.
1 ranking or perfect record at
stake. Stanford has an opportunity
to prove to itself and the rest of
college baseball that it can domi
nate on any diamond in the coun

try, and that's an opportunity the
Cardinal can't let slip through its
fingers.

Joseph Beyda hopes that the
Stan ford baseball team fares better
on the road than the Stanford men's
basketball team did at Utah last
weekend. Calm his nerves at jbey

heads to Arizona to face the pro
jected Pac-12 runners-up Wildcats
in a month's time. In the long run,
it's more important than either
next week's showdown with No. 4
Rice or Stanford's two dominant
series wins over Vanderbilt and
Texas.
The reason is simple: Sunken
Diamond isn't in Omaha.
If the Cardinal meets its presea
son expectations it will host a re
gional, and if it keeps playing the
way it has to open the season, it
could host a Super Regional as
well. But no matter what, the Car
dinal is going to have to leave the
Stanford bubble, stay in a hotel and
remain competitive in a foreign
ballpark if it wants to compete for
the national title.
A weekend series at Fresno
State might not compare to the
grueling 12-day marathon that is
the College World Series. A 170-
mile bus ride to the Central Valley
isn't the same as a 1,700-mile plane
flight to the central United States.
And the Bulldogs who received
the 34th most votes in this week's
coaches' poll aren't exactly the
type of team you expect to be play
ing in late June.
But home success can only take
you so far, and this weekend Stan
ford has its only chance to establish
itself as a road warrior before the
highly competitive Pac-12 season
gets into full swing. After taking
two of three from Rice in Houston
to open the 2011 season, the Cardi
nal lost five of its next seven road
games. It can't afford to let that
happen again, with projected 2-4-5
Pac-12 finishers Arizona, UCLA
and Oregon State hosting Stanford
later this season.
So even though the Cardinal is
off to an impressive start, it can't
afford any letdown at Fresno State.
There's more than the squad's No.
1 ranking or perfect record at
stake. Stanford has an opportunity
to prove to itself and the rest of
college baseball that it can domi
nate on any diamond in the coun

try, and that's an opportunity the
Cardinal can't let slip through its
fingers.

Joseph Beyda hopes that the
Stan ford baseball team fares better
on the road than the Stanford men's
basketball team did at Utah last
weekend. Calm his nerves at jbey

If you were to take a quick
glance at Stanford baseball's
nonconference schedule be
fore the season started, the
trio of early home series
against highly ranked teams would
catch your eye instantly. This
weekend's three-game set at Fres
no State would pale in comparison
with the preseason No. 2 Cardi
nal's matchups with then-No. 12
Vanderbilt, No. 5 Texas and No. 7
Rice.
A lot of things have changed in
the last two weeks, not the least of
which is Stanford's 8-0 surge to
claim the No. 1 spot in this week's
coaches' poll. And even though the
Cardinal's weekend sweeps of the
Commodores and Longhorns look
less impressive now that those two
squads have both fallen well below
.500, there hasn't been much of an
answer for Stanford's high-octane
offense and stellar pitching in the
early going.
But as the Cardinal prepares to
head out on its first major road trip
of the season for a three-game stint
in Fresno, I'd be surprised if the
team escapes the weekend with its
perfect record still intact. Stanford
was a dominant 18-7 playing on the
Farm last season that's equiva
lent to taking two of three over the
weekend as well as the midweek
game but a mediocre 15-15 on
the road. The squad's one sweep
last year was at home, although it
was in position do the same at Cal
to close the regular season before
the third game was called due to
rain.
This Cardinal team sure looks
a lot better than last year's in
every area. Its bats have been on
fire since opening day. Its defense
has made less than half as many
errors as opposing squads. Its top
two starting pitchers are allowing
a hit just every other inning, and
talented freshman John
Hochstatter has looked like a vet
eran in the Sunday slot. And, of
course, a lineup that consisted al
most entirely of freshmen and
sophomores last season is now
full of experienced sophomores
and juniors with a Super Region
al run behind them.
Yet will any of that translate to
the road, where Stanford struggled
to pull out a 9-7 win in extra in
nings over unranked Pacific last
Tuesday?
With that question in mind, this
weekend's series is probably the
most important for Cardinal base
ball, at least before the squad
heads to Arizona to face the pro
jected Pac-12 runners-up Wildcats
in a month's time. In the long run,
it's more important than either
next week's showdown with No. 4
Rice or Stanford's two dominant
series wins over Vanderbilt and
Texas.
