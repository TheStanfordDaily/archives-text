### â€“ Caroline Caselli 
The No. 14 Stanford Softball
team went 5-0 at the Cathedral
City Classic in Cathedral City,
Calif., beating San Diego State
and New Mexico State on Sunday
to go undefeated in the three-day
tournament.
Senior Ashley Hansen helped
the Card grab an early lead
against New Mexico State, hitting
an RBI single to score freshman
Hanna Winter in the top of the
first. Classmate Jenna Becerra tal
lied an RBI of her own, driving
home junior Jenna Rich in the top
of the fourth to give Stanford a 2-
0 lead.
After the Cardinal scored two
more runs in the top of the fifth,
New Mexico State would take ad
vantage of a Stanford pitching
change. In the bottom of the fifth,
with bases loaded, junior Tehani

Kaaihue hit a two-run double to
bring the score to 4-2. However,
the Aggies would not score again,
and an RBI from Rich in the top
of the seventh capped off the Car
dinal's 5-2 victory.
Once again, Stanford would
start off fast against San Diego
State, tallying three runs in the top
of the third. The Aztecs answered
with a solo homerun in the bot
tom of the inning, but Stanford
would expand the lead to 6-1 in
the fifth inning, with sophomore
Caitlyn Pura, freshman Leah
White and Hansen all scoring for
the Card. San Diego State would
score two runs in the sixth, but
Stanford again added a pair of
late runs to seal the game at 8-3.
Junior pitcher Teagan Gerhart
earned both wins for the Cardinal
(13-3), striking out 12 batters and
allowing just one run and three
hits in her 11.2 innings on the
mound.
Earlier in the weekend, Stan
ford also defeated Long Beach
State, Long Island University-
Brooklyn and No. 6 Oklahoma.
The Cardinal has won seven
straight games.
Next weekend, Stanford will
hit the road again, traveling to
Fullerton, Calif., for the DeMarini
Invitational. The Cardinal will
face Indiana, Northwestern, Flori
da International, East Carolina
