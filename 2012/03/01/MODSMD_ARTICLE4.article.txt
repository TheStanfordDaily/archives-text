# SLAC calls for restored benefits
## Student labor group circulates petitions for dining employees 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
While stating that no labor violations are taking place,
University officials have agreed to consider demands by
the Stanford Labor Action Coalition (SLAC) to restore
employee benefits for Row House dining chefs and hash
ers, according to representatives of both groups.
SLAC released these demands and issued a petition to
raise student awareness last December, wrote SLAC rep
resentative Laurel Fish 'l4 in an email to the Daily.
Earlier this month, SLAC released another petition,
this time advocating for the resolution of benefit cuts for
employees in Stanford dining halls. According to the new
petition, there have been cases of employees who have
been reduced from full time status to 75-percent status.
Being at 75-percent status, the petition states, means these
workers' benefits including health care, vacation pay
and accrued time toward retirement are significantly
reduced.
Eric Montell, executive director of Stanford Dining,
responded in a Feb. 10 online comment to the second pe-
tition, writing that "the statements
in the highly inflammatory peti
tion are grossly inaccurate, misrep
resent the facts and do not reflect
the business practices and core
values of Stanford Dining."
Referencing procedure for dis
cussions with students groups,
Montell wrote, "We are certain that
process will allow the SLAC mem
bers to fully understand the reasons
why we categorically refute the un
warranted and groundless allega
tions leveled against the practices
and human resource treatment of
workers in Stanford Dining."
He added that administrators
reached out to SLAC in response
to the petition.
Fish, however, said that Dining
administrators have ignored two
separate requests for a meeting
over these new issues.
Demands in the initial petition
were crafted after a self-op kitchen
manager alerted the organization
in December to benefit cuts affect
ing Row dining workers, according
to Fish. She added that SLAC
went on to confirm these cuts with
chefs and hashers of multiple self
operating houses.
"We believe that the response
to the petition, with over 1,341 sig
natures from members of the
Stanford community (as counted
by the number of unique, valid
email addresses), demonstrates
the importance of these issues and
the widespread support for work
ers on the Row," Fish wrote.
The cuts may be the result of
changes in the sub-contracting
process within the 2012 contract
for Student Organized Services
(SOS). In a January email to sup
porters about the campaign,
SLAC stated that SOS, previously
the only provider of Row house
kitchen labor, may have been
forced to make cuts in order to
compete with outside bidders.
SLAC presented four specific
demands after talks with the af
fected workers.The demands dealt
with reinstating vacation pay and
granting full health care benefits
removed after the 2010-11 aca
demic year; covering parking per
mits and health certification ex
penses; and giving chefs, hashers
and students more control than
SOS over self-op, Greek and
theme house kitchens.
Fish wrote that the demands
represent the most direct cost-cut
ting measures included in the 2012
contract for the Row and take into
account the slight pay increases
that some workers received,
which, when reconciled with bene
fit cuts, have resulted in a 6.8-per
cent average decrease in net com
pensation for workers.
"We are hoping that full bene
fits, including five weeks of paid
vacation, significant holiday
bonuses (as opposed to the $2O
- that workers received this year
as part of a trivial revenue-sharing

plan), and full health care cover
age will be mandated as basic stan
dards for any sub-contractors that
submit a bid to provide labor on
the Row," Fish wrote.
SLAC representatives met
with Dean of Residential Educa
tion Deborah Colder and Vice
Provost Greg Boardman in De
cember. Golder wrote in an email
to The Daily that she and Board
man "clarified that in fact, there
are no labor violations taking
place" and highlighted that that
there have been changes in em
ployee contracts with SOS.
"SLAC's advocacy is for the
well being of the men and women
who serve in these roles," Golder
wrote. "We share this concern and
are fully invested in supporting
these hard working individuals
many of whom have served on the
Row for decades."
University administrators held
a meeting with SLAC once again
earlier this month in which they
agreed to take the issues into con
sideration, especially SLAC's re
quest for the University to have
Row student leaders involved in
the conversations in preparation
for the vendor bid process.
In the meantime, the Stanford
Asian American Activism Com
mittee (SAAAC), and the Nation
al Association for the Achieve
ment of Colored People
(NAACP), among others, are
working as coalition partners for
SLAC's campaign against cost
cutting both on the Row and in
dining halls.
"Although we did not solicit
group co-sponsorships for the
Row petition, we view issues on
the Row and in dining halls as in
terrelated instances of cost-cutting
that sacrifice worker's rights for
the bottom line, disrespect the
hardworking food service workers
on campus, threaten the autonomy
of student communities, and un
dermine justice and food sustain
ability on campus," Fish wrote.
SLAC's most recent petition
stated that Stanford Residential
and Dining Enterprises (RD&E)
"reduced many workers to part
time, 75 percent status, even
though they still assign many of
these works a 40-hour weekly
workload."
The petition also states that
"R&DE managers have prohibit
ed workers from talking to stu
dents and, when they do, threat
ened to move them to work at Ar
rillaga Dining, which already has a
notorious reputation among the
workers as one of the worst work
ing environments."
"Even after building Arrillaga
[Family Dining Commons] and
converting Yost, East, Murray, and
Toyon from eating clubs to dining
halls, R&DE has cut corners by
not hiring more workers to serve
the increase in work that needs to
be done," Fish said.
The demands of the new peti
tion include that R&DE "return
all workers to permanent, full
time status with full-time benefits
as defined in the workers' collec
tive bargaining agreement" and to

"ensure supervisors respect work
ers and value their work as re
quired by Stanford policy and
R&DE Core Values," among
other demands.

The petition also states that
"R&DE managers have prohibit
ed workers from talking to stu
dents and, when they do, threat
ened to move them to work at Ar
rillaga Dining, which already has a
notorious reputation among the
workers as one of the worst work
ing environments."
"Even after building Arrillaga
[Family Dining Commons] and
converting Yost, East, Murray, and
Toyon from eating clubs to dining
halls, R&DE has cut corners by
not hiring more workers to serve
the increase in work that needs to
be done," Fish said.
The demands of the new peti
tion include that R&DE "return
all workers to permanent, full
time status with full-time benefits
as defined in the workers' collec
tive bargaining agreement" and to

"ensure supervisors respect work
ers and value their work as re
quired by Stanford policy and
R&DE Core Values," among
other demands.

While stating that no labor violations are taking place,
University officials have agreed to consider demands by
the Stanford Labor Action Coalition (SLAC) to restore
employee benefits for Row House dining chefs and hash
ers, according to representatives of both groups.
SLAC released these demands and issued a petition to
raise student awareness last December, wrote SLAC rep
resentative Laurel Fish 'l4 in an email to the Daily.
Earlier this month, SLAC released another petition,
this time advocating for the resolution of benefit cuts for
employees in Stanford dining halls. According to the new
petition, there have been cases of employees who have
been reduced from full time status to 75-percent status.
Being at 75-percent status, the petition states, means these
workers' benefits including health care, vacation pay
and accrued time toward retirement are significantly
reduced.
Eric Montell, executive director of Stanford Dining,
responded in a Feb. 10 online comment to the second pe-
tition, writing that "the statements
in the highly inflammatory peti
tion are grossly inaccurate, misrep
resent the facts and do not reflect
the business practices and core
values of Stanford Dining."
Referencing procedure for dis
cussions with students groups,
Montell wrote, "We are certain that
process will allow the SLAC mem
bers to fully understand the reasons
why we categorically refute the un
warranted and groundless allega
tions leveled against the practices
and human resource treatment of
workers in Stanford Dining."
He added that administrators
reached out to SLAC in response
to the petition.
Fish, however, said that Dining
administrators have ignored two
separate requests for a meeting
over these new issues.
Demands in the initial petition
were crafted after a self-op kitchen
manager alerted the organization
in December to benefit cuts affect
ing Row dining workers, according
to Fish. She added that SLAC
went on to confirm these cuts with
chefs and hashers of multiple self
operating houses.
"We believe that the response
to the petition, with over 1,341 sig
natures from members of the
Stanford community (as counted
by the number of unique, valid
email addresses), demonstrates
the importance of these issues and
the widespread support for work
ers on the Row," Fish wrote.
The cuts may be the result of
changes in the sub-contracting
process within the 2012 contract
for Student Organized Services
(SOS). In a January email to sup
porters about the campaign,
SLAC stated that SOS, previously
the only provider of Row house
kitchen labor, may have been
forced to make cuts in order to
compete with outside bidders.
SLAC presented four specific
demands after talks with the af
fected workers.The demands dealt
with reinstating vacation pay and
granting full health care benefits
removed after the 2010-11 aca
demic year; covering parking per
mits and health certification ex
penses; and giving chefs, hashers
and students more control than
SOS over self-op, Greek and
theme house kitchens.
Fish wrote that the demands
represent the most direct cost-cut
ting measures included in the 2012
contract for the Row and take into
account the slight pay increases
that some workers received,
which, when reconciled with bene
fit cuts, have resulted in a 6.8-per
cent average decrease in net com
pensation for workers.
"We are hoping that full bene
fits, including five weeks of paid
vacation, significant holiday
bonuses (as opposed to the $2O
- that workers received this year
as part of a trivial revenue-sharing

plan), and full health care cover
age will be mandated as basic stan
dards for any sub-contractors that
submit a bid to provide labor on
the Row," Fish wrote.
SLAC representatives met
with Dean of Residential Educa
tion Deborah Colder and Vice
Provost Greg Boardman in De
cember. Golder wrote in an email
to The Daily that she and Board
man "clarified that in fact, there
are no labor violations taking
place" and highlighted that that
there have been changes in em
ployee contracts with SOS.
"SLAC's advocacy is for the
well being of the men and women
who serve in these roles," Golder
wrote. "We share this concern and
are fully invested in supporting
these hard working individuals
many of whom have served on the
Row for decades."
University administrators held
a meeting with SLAC once again
earlier this month in which they
agreed to take the issues into con
sideration, especially SLAC's re
quest for the University to have
Row student leaders involved in
the conversations in preparation
for the vendor bid process.
In the meantime, the Stanford
Asian American Activism Com
mittee (SAAAC), and the Nation
al Association for the Achieve
ment of Colored People
(NAACP), among others, are
working as coalition partners for
SLAC's campaign against cost
cutting both on the Row and in
dining halls.
"Although we did not solicit
group co-sponsorships for the
Row petition, we view issues on
the Row and in dining halls as in
terrelated instances of cost-cutting
that sacrifice worker's rights for
the bottom line, disrespect the
hardworking food service workers
on campus, threaten the autonomy
of student communities, and un
dermine justice and food sustain
ability on campus," Fish wrote.
SLAC's most recent petition
stated that Stanford Residential
and Dining Enterprises (RD&E)
"reduced many workers to part
time, 75 percent status, even
though they still assign many of
these works a 40-hour weekly
workload."
The petition also states that
"R&DE managers have prohibit
ed workers from talking to stu
