## Stanford Ally Week seeks to unite queer community 
### LINDSEY TXAKEEYANG 
Stanford Ally Week, a series of events organ
ized by campus Queer Volunteer Student Or
ganizations (QVSOs) to unite queer communi
ties and raise campus awareness and support, is
an effort to bridge divides, according to student
group leaders.
"It's about the cultural centers coming to
gether because we have these very separate
meetings and these very separate groups," said
Elizabeth Patino 'l4, "which I think is good. It
really works. But we also want to come back to
gether."

Patino was a key figure in the organization of
Stanford Ally Week. She said she had been re
flecting since summer to think of ways to inte
grate allies more into the queer community.
"I wanted to make the ally community visi
ble, so that it's not just a one community strug
gle not only queer people fighting for queer
rights," Patino said.
Organizers of the event had slightly differing
definitions of what makes someone an ally to
queer rights.
According to Patino, an ally is somebody
who "actively supports and helps further the
rights of certain kinds of population," in this

case the queer community.
"So if you're a queer and Asian ally, then
you're going to fight for those rights," Patino
said. "Or if you're an Asian community ally,
you're going to be in those groups trying to fight
for those rights."
On the other hand, Isabella Arzeno 'l2 of
fered a more relaxed version of who is an ally.
She said being born and raised in Puerto Rico, a
country she said is still not very accepting of
LGBT people, has given her an appreciation of
even the smallest of steps.
"l will consider anyone that em
braces my queer identity as an ally,
especially if you are willing to go
with me to LGBT events because
that would be totally unheard of
from where I come from," Arzeno
said.
Patino said Stanford's queer
community is one that, in her opin
ion, has its own "niche."
"It's a very tight knit community.
We know each other," she added.
"We're kind of like our own family."
Monday's event was a reading
and discussion with Stanford Stu
dents for Queer Liberation
(SSQL) of "Queers Read This," an
anonymous pamphlet distributed

at a New York City pride march in
June 1990. Queer and Asian
(Q&A) held a discussion about the
reading on Tuesday.
About 19 students gathered in
the lounge of El Centro Chicano
Wednesday to talk to a panel of stu
dents from the Latino queer group,
Familia, and the group Safe and
Open Spaces at Stanford
(SOSAS).
Although distinct communities
sponsored the events on Tuesday
and Wednesday, on Thursday the
groups will come together for a
mixer at El Centro Chicano, fol
lowed by a gathering on Friday at
noon in White Plaza with food and
music.
Patino described the unifying
events as an attempt to "make a call
for everyone to get together."
"I'm hoping that this week will
demonstrate just how much corn

munity there is here at Stanford,"
wrote Nathaniel Williamson 'l3,
co-chair of Queer Straight Alliance
(QSA), in an email to The Daily.
"Being queer, LGBTQ-identified,
and allied at Stanford is perhaps the
best experience one can have in the
U.S."
Arzeno echoed his thoughts
saying, "If there was a place to rede
fine your identity, Stanford is defi
nitely it."
"[Stanford Ally Week] is a dou
ble learning experience," she
added. "It's not only allies learning
to be involved with the queer com
munity, but the queer community
learning to be involved with allies.
We're tackling both homophobia
and heterophobia at the same
time."

munity there is here at Stanford,"
wrote Nathaniel Williamson 'l3,
co-chair of Queer Straight Alliance
(QSA), in an email to The Daily.
"Being queer, LGBTQ-identified,
and allied at Stanford is perhaps the
best experience one can have in the
U.S."
Arzeno echoed his thoughts
saying, "If there was a place to rede
fine your identity, Stanford is defi
nitely it."
"[Stanford Ally Week] is a dou
ble learning experience," she
added. "It's not only allies learning
to be involved with the queer com
munity, but the queer community
learning to be involved with allies.
We're tackling both homophobia
and heterophobia at the same
time."
