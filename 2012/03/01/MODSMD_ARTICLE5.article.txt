## Stanford Ally Week seeks to unite queer community 
### LINDSEY TXAKEEYANG 
Stanford Ally Week, a series of events organ
ized by campus Queer Volunteer Student Or
ganizations (QVSOs) to unite queer communi
ties and raise campus awareness and support, is
an effort to bridge divides, according to student
group leaders.
"It's about the cultural centers coming to
gether because we have these very separate
meetings and these very separate groups," said
Elizabeth Patino 'l4, "which I think is good. It
really works. But we also want to come back to
gether."

Patino was a key figure in the organization of
Stanford Ally Week. She said she had been re
flecting since summer to think of ways to inte
grate allies more into the queer community.
"I wanted to make the ally community visi
ble, so that it's not just a one community strug
gle not only queer people fighting for queer
rights," Patino said.
Organizers of the event had slightly differing
definitions of what makes someone an ally to
queer rights.
According to Patino, an ally is somebody
who "actively supports and helps further the
rights of certain kinds of population," in this

case the queer community.
"So if you're a queer and Asian ally, then
you're going to fight for those rights," Patino
said. "Or if you're an Asian community ally,
you're going to be in those groups trying to fight
for those rights."
On the other hand, Isabella Arzeno 'l2 of
fered a more relaxed version of who is an ally.
She said being born and raised in Puerto Rico, a
country she said is still not very accepting of
LGBT people, has given her an appreciation of
even the smallest of steps.
