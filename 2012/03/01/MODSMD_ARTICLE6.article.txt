## StartX panel commends program 
### ARIELLA AXLER 
Student entrepreneurs from
the Stanford StartX accelerator
gathered at a panel Wednesday
night to share insights from their
experiences developing compa
nies. The event was a part of Stan
ford's Entrepreneurship Week,
which runs from Feb. 27 to March
7 and aims to showcase the best of
entrepreneurship in the Stanford
community.
"We don't want to create a
room with padded walls," said
Cameron Teitelman 'll, StartX
founder and senior managing di
rector. "We have direct feedback
so people can learn whether or not
what they're doing is effective."
The StartX model involves the
centralization of the extensive re

sources at Stanford in order to
provide for Stanford student en
trepreneurs. StartX which is a
division of the financial arm of the
ASSU, Stanford Student Enter
prises (SSE) is the largest stu
dent start-up accelerator at Stan
ford and aspires to promote inde
pendent learning through experi
ential education.
The entrepreneurs who spoke
at the panel event gave testi
monies to the success of StartX so
far. In addition, two undergradu
ates and four graduate students
who had each launched successful
companies in the biotech and in
formation technology fields were
members of the panel. As the indi
viduals shared their personal sto
ries and challenges, the discussion
focused on the frustrations and

difficulties of start-up develop
ment.
"The biggest hurdle for
everyone is going from the
wanting to the believing," said
Michael Carter, co-founder at
Game Closure. "But at the point
where you have nothing outside
of what you're working on, you
have nothing to do but succeed."
The moderator asked the pan
elists what they do when they are
told they cannot succeed.
"Either your idea really isn't
good, or you didn't explain your
self well," said Brenden Millstein
M.B.A 'lO M.S.'ll, CEO and co
founder of Carbon Lighthouse.
"Keeping this self-reflexive mind
set is helpful, and outside feed

back can be very beneficial."
The student entrepreneurs also
spoke about how to navigate
working with a close friend. The
panelists all agreed that trusting
other's strengths is the underlying
key to successful business develop
ment.
"One of the biggest failures of
student companies is the inability
of friends to separate personal and
professional relationships, which
can really hinder a company," Teit
elman said. "It is important to form
relationships and have a proactive
method to evaluate who would be
good to work with."
A primary benefit of the StartX
program is the community of peer
support for companies, the pan

elists said.
"You learn from information
and peer exchange, as well as accu
mulate resources and build a net
work," said Divya Nag 'l3, a co
founder at Stem Cell Theranostics.
"It paints a picture of how the
world works from other people's
perspectives."
Because most companies expe
rience similar struggles in the de
velopment process, Teitelman said
that StartX emphasizes a peer and
mentor education system, which is
rooted in questioning and prob
lem-solving collaboration.
"StartX has been incredibly
beneficial because of the commu
nity," Millstein added. "Being able
to walk around to 10 or 20 compa
nies that had just solved the exact
issue we needed to solve literally
saved hundreds of hours."
