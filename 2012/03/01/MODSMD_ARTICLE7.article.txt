## Resolution to support Quran fails by one vote 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
After a charged, three-hour
debate lasting past midnight
Tuesday, the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate rejected a bill au
thored by senators expressing
concern for the welfare of Fadi
Quran'lo and urging the Univer
sity to issue a statement on behalf
of the Stanford alumnus arrested
last week and since released in
the West Bank. Several senators
alleged factual uncertainty, anti-
Israeli undercurrents and inade
quate grounding for the resolu
tion's proposed measures as ra
tionales for rejection. The Senate
also unanimously approved a bill
supporting the continued inde
pendence of Chi Theta Chi
(XOX).
Senator Daniel DeLong 'l3
commented on the often acrimo
nious and frequently disrupted
nature of the meeting, saying to
The Daily, "This is the most
ridiculous meeting we've ever
had, in terms of order."

Israeli soldiers in the West Bank

non-violent protest. Quran was
released on bail from an Israeli
prison yesterday.
"This is an issue that comes to
the heart of Stanford because it
concerns an alumnus," Ra
machandran said. "I want to high
light that Quran is a non-violent
protestor, something that's com
mendable."
Ramachandran cited the col
lective concern for Quran's wel
fare expressed by faculty and the
University administration, as well
as by both pro-Israel and pro-
Palestine groups on campus.
Representatives from both
groups attended the public Sen
ate meeting.
Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4 ap
plauded the bill's sentiment, and
noted the efforts of the resolu
tion's authors in reaching out to
disparate and often conflicting
groups on campus.
Elhanan asserted, however,
that he had encountered sus
tained student concerns about the
language utilized in the original
copy of the bill, seen as implicitly
equating Israel with human rights
violations. He suggested that
Quran's proximity to a violent
