## Resolution to support Quran fails by one vote 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
After a charged, three-hour
debate lasting past midnight
Tuesday, the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate rejected a bill au
thored by senators expressing
concern for the welfare of Fadi
Quran'lo and urging the Univer
sity to issue a statement on behalf
of the Stanford alumnus arrested
last week and since released in
the West Bank. Several senators
alleged factual uncertainty, anti-
Israeli undercurrents and inade
quate grounding for the resolu
tion's proposed measures as ra
tionales for rejection. The Senate
also unanimously approved a bill
supporting the continued inde
pendence of Chi Theta Chi
(XOX).
Senator Daniel DeLong 'l3
commented on the often acrimo
nious and frequently disrupted
nature of the meeting, saying to
The Daily, "This is the most
ridiculous meeting we've ever
had, in terms of order."
Resolution in support of Fadi
Quran
The "Resolution to Support
the Safety and Security of Fadi
Quran," authored by Senators
Samar Alqatari 'l4 and Janani
Ramachandran 'l4 and co-spon
sored by Senate Chair Rafael
Vazquez 'l2, was proposed in re

sponse to the detention and trial
of Quran, a Palestinian-Ameri
can Stanford alumnus arrested by
Israeli soldiers in the West Bank
Friday while participating in a
non-violent protest. Quran was
released on bail from an Israeli
prison yesterday.
"This is an issue that comes to
the heart of Stanford because it
concerns an alumnus," Ra
machandran said. "I want to high
light that Quran is a non-violent
protestor, something that's com
mendable."
Ramachandran cited the col
lective concern for Quran's wel
fare expressed by faculty and the
University administration, as well
as by both pro-Israel and pro-
Palestine groups on campus.
Representatives from both
groups attended the public Sen
ate meeting.
Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4 ap
plauded the bill's sentiment, and
noted the efforts of the resolu
tion's authors in reaching out to
disparate and often conflicting
groups on campus.
Elhanan asserted, however,
that he had encountered sus
tained student concerns about the
language utilized in the original
copy of the bill, seen as implicitly
equating Israel with human rights
violations. He suggested that
Quran's proximity to a violent
protest may partially explain the
reaction of Israeli security forces.
He also noted that, while the res
olution called for a statement on
the issue by Provost and Acting
President John Etchemendy 'B2,
Etchemendy had previously ex
pressed his reluctance to make
such a declaration.
"There needs to be very nar
row, specific language and I don't
think this abides by that," El
hanan said.
Multiple senators, including
Elhanan and Ben Laufer 'l2, ex
pressed concern that the resolu
tion had insufficient grounds
within the ASSU Constitution to
allow Senate action on the issue,
which is reserved for issues af
fecting Stanford students.
"A matter shall be construed as
directly affecting Stanford stu
dents only if there is at least one
Stanford student who is affected
by the matter in a substantially dif
ferent manner than would be the
case if he or she were not a univer
sity student," states Article I, Sec
tion 5.8 of the ASSU Constitution
as cited by the resolution.
Laufer argued that Quran's
graduation, and the lack of evi
dence that his treatment by Is
raeli security forces was in any
way prejudiced by his affiliation
with Stanford, meant his plight
was no longer incorporated
under the ASSU Constitution.
Responding to Laufer's con
cerns, Ramachandran cited the
precedent created by the Sen
ate's prior willingness to address
issues such as police violence
against University of California
students beyond the immedi
ate Stanford community. She ar
gued that Quran's ongoing links
to the Stanford community
emanating from his time as presi
dent of Students Confronting
Apartheid by Israel (SCAI), now
Stanford Students for Palestinian
Equal Rights (SPER), from 2007
to 2009 made his ordeal rele
vant to the University communi
ty, a position echoed by ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2.

"It's an issue that has come to
campus, and it [has] spurred a lot
of people to think about this con
flict," Alqatari said.
Input from members of pro-
Israel and pro-Palestine groups
accentuated and polarized the
debate. Daniel Bardenstein 'l3,
co-president of the Stanford Is
rael Alliance, expressed concern
that the ASSU was moving be
yond the interests of a student
body that, he asserted, had yet to
engage with the issue. He argued
that, following Quran's release,
the legislation had no purpose.
Bardenstein also alleged that
the bill, by assuming Quran's mis
treatment while in Israeli cus
tody, made an implicit judgment
on Israel. Vazquez supported this
point, arguing that the resolution
in its current form failed to delin
eate sufficiently between Quran
and the broader conflict.
After substantial revisions re
moving clauses referring to the
Israeli government and moderat
ing the tone of the statement re
quested of Etchemendy, in addi
tion to repeated recesses to en
courage further collaboration
and compromise, the Senate re
mained sharply divided.
Senators agreed, however, on the
need to address the issue with the
information available in a timely
fashion.
A roll-call vote on the bill, re
quiring six votes for approval,
came up one vote short, with four
Senators opposing the measure
and four abstaining. Despite the
setback, the Senate approved a
motion to reconsider the motion.
"I support the literal wording
of much of this bill," DeLong
said. "I voted 'no' because I'm
concerned about the political un
dercurrents and tensions."
Despite further efforts at rec
onciling opposing viewpoints,
and the increasing frustration of
its Chair, the Senate continued to
struggle in finding consensus. Ar
guing against further compro
mise, and opposing a proposed
amended version of the resolu
tion that would remove the re
quest for a University statement,
the bill's authors emphasized the
need for an emphatic and unify
ing resolution.
"Don't water it down into

nothing," a visibly upset Ra
machandran argued. "We just
want compromise on something
that affects a fellow student."
Facing mutual recriminations
about the lack of progress
through three hours of debate,
the Senate rejected a motion to
adjourn and returned to an
adapted version of the original
resolution for another roll-call
vote. Needing eight votes for suc
cessful passage, the measure was
only able to garner seven. Four
senators voted against the bill
and two abstained.
Elhanan put an optimistic spin
on the evening.
"This was extremely unchar
acteristic," he told The Daily.
"But it shows how seriously we
take this."
ChiTheta Chi
By contrast, the passage of a
"Resolution to Support the Inde
pendence of Chi Theta Chi"
posed few problems and passed
unanimously from previous no
tice. The bill, authored by De-
Long , Laufer, Gerad Hanono
'l2, XOX house manager, and
Jonathan Anderson 'l2, former
XOX resident assistant, in re
sponse to the recent termination
of XOX's lease, called for ASSU
promotion of XOX's continued
independence and for a dialogue
between the XOX Alumni Asso
ciation and the University "to
find an amicable and workable
solution."
"The ASSU represents the en
tire student body," Hanono said
before the meeting. "We feel they
have an important role to play in
our community engagement in
trying to preserve our independ
ence."
In front of 30 XOX residents,
Anderson noted that while
Stanford recently delayed the
transition to University manage
ment until Aug. 31 Chi Theta
Chi has been actively seeking to
rectify the administration's con
cerns and create a long-term pro
posal for the house's manage
ment. While hesitating to draw
conclusions, DeLong identified
the postponement as potentially
indicating a promising outcome
for XOX.
While he expressed his sup

port for XOX's continued inde
pendence, Elhanan noted lessons
the co-op could learn.
"I think we can agree this has
served as a wake-up call to you, to
ensure that communication with
the administration is working,"
he said.
Special Fees
Prior to discussing Fadi
Quran, the Senate turned its at
tention to the issue of special fees.
While the Senate approved a cor
rection to an erroneous bylaw
reference in a Feb. 21 resolution
granting The Daily an exemption
from banking its non-special fee
funds with Student Service En
terprises (SSE), senators ex
pressed concern about eight or
ganizations, including The Daily,
that missed the Feb. 21 deadline
for filing special fee disclosure
packets.

Elhanan argued that the affect
ed Voluntary Student Organiza
tions (VSOs) should come before
the Appropriations Committee to
explain the delay in document
submission. DeLong supported
the suggestion, suggesting legisla
tion to impose a "late fee" on VSO
reserves to deter future tardiness.
Appropriations Committee
Chair Brianna Pang 'l3 argued
that the delay may have emanat
ed from confusion among the
VSOs about the deadline date, or
with which body to file the re
quests.
"It's not that these groups
weren't prepared, it's just that
they didn't physically submit it,"
she argued.
The bill was tabled for discus
sion at next week's Senate meeting.
