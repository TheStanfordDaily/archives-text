With Toulouse
Lautrec and Ma
tisse-like vintage
posters lined on
the walls, the
works of Descartes on the library
shelves and beef bourguignon
served at meals, La Maison
Francaise lives up to its name as
the campus' French enclave.
La Maison Francaise, other
wise known as French House, is an
undergraduate cultural themed
house located on the Row. It is a
self-op, run and organized by its
residents.
Patricia de Castries, La Maison
Francaise faculty affiliate, de
scribes it as a place where stu
dents "are young and are allowed
to make and learn from their mis
takes."
According to Edouard Negiar
'l3, academic theme associate, the
house enjoys being a very close
knit community. He attributes this
to the residents' shared interest in
French culture.
There are three routes to at
taining residence at La Maison
Frangaise. Students can pre-assign
prior to the housing draw, apply to
be a resident by selecting tier two
in the housing draw or take their
chances at being drawn in by se
lecting tier one.
In the past, the house required
applicants to speak French, have
successfully completed one year
of French at Stanford or have
studied abroad for at least one
quarter through the Bing Over
seas Study Program (BOSP) in
Paris.
The current application, writ
ten in French, asks the candidates
to detail their connection to
France and what they can con
tribute to the house.
Last year, half the current resi
dents pre-assigned while the
other half drew into the house, a
ratio that has been relatively con
stant in recent years.
However, starting this year, ap
plicants do not necessarily have to
speak French to apply for resi
dence in La Maison f rancaise.

"We don't want to exclude
anyone if they don't speak the lan
guage, but rather ask them why
they have a particular interest in
French culture and what they can
add to the community," Negiar
said.
"Part of the excitement is that
people are glad to be here and get
involved in the French communi
ty, but not necessarily speak the
language," he added. "The more
people buy into that, the more
fun."

A unique feature of the house
is the classes offered almost every
day of the week. On Monday,
French conversation classes at be
ginner, intermediate, and ad
vanced levels are held while intro
ductory and advanced wine tast
ing classes, taught by de Castries,
are offered on Tuesdays.
"These classes are among the
most popular at Stanford and they
are almost always filled up the
second registration opens," de
Castries said.

On Wednesdays, Negiar teach
es a French cinema seminar,
screening new wave cinema,
comedies, old classics and modern
French movies.
"What's important about the
French Flouse is that we don't
take ourselves too seriously, but
instead try to informally organize

fun events around French cul
ture," Negiar said.
The house also places an em
phasis on French cuisine and tries
to recreate the French culinary
culture in the residence by offer
ing French cooking classes and
hosting La Table Francaise on
Mondays, which attracts a variety
of people including graduate stu
dents, faculty members and even
Bay Area entrepreneurs to sam
ple classic French food.
The dishes are prepared by

Juan Jose, a Spanish born chef
who trained in France. He serves
some of his best French classics on
the night, such as coq au vin, or
chicken in wine.
"The experience is surreal; if a
foreign student just came in, he
would think he was transported to
some weird French enclave where
the baguettes, cheese and bab
bling away in French never stops,"
Negiar said.
Fun-loving Chef Jose, who res
idents refer to as J.J., is a key part
of the house community.
'"J.J. has a great relationship
with the students," said resident
Andrea Fuentes 'l2. "He's per
sonable, fun to be around, jokes a
lot and he's a great cook, as well."
La Maison Fran§aise also
throws public events such as
Crepe Night. In preparation, resi
dents put up wall decorations, lay
tablecloths and hang Christmas
lights to give the house a romantic
feel. When the guests arrive, the
students transform into cooks and
waiters and serve savory and
sweet crepes.
The profits from Crepe Night
go toward funding house activi
ties and excursions. In the past, ex
cursions have included trips to the
de Young Fine Arts Museum of
San Francisco to see a Picasso ex
hibition on loan from the Musee
national Picasso in Paris, or simply
taking outings to French bistros in
the area.
Another popular public event
held at La Maison Franchise is
Cafe Night, which has a more
party-like atmosphere complete
with a D J on one side of the house
and a live jazz band on the other.
"Cafe Night is the best, most
social alternative to the Greek
houses on campus for people who
do not find themselves represent
ed in the crowds at fratjernity]
parties," Negiar said.
Students agree, hailing nights,
classes and food at La Maison
Franchise as a welcome addition
to their Stanford experience.
"My first experience at the
French House was great," said
MauricioAntunano Ts."linstant
ly noticed the unique vibe and it
was a very welcome change from
the usual Stanford atmosphere."
"I love going to the French
House with my friends," said Nar
jis Sarehane 'l3. "Its a charming
place where people can blend into
French culture and traditions in a
different country."

"What's important about the
French Flouse is that we don't
take ourselves too seriously, but
instead try to informally organize

fun events around French cul
ture," Negiar said.
The house also places an em
phasis on French cuisine and tries
to recreate the French culinary
culture in the residence by offer
ing French cooking classes and
hosting La Table Francaise on
Mondays, which attracts a variety
of people including graduate stu
dents, faculty members and even
Bay Area entrepreneurs to sam
ple classic French food.
The dishes are prepared by

Juan Jose, a Spanish born chef
who trained in France. He serves
some of his best French classics on
the night, such as coq au vin, or
chicken in wine.
"The experience is surreal; if a
foreign student just came in, he
would think he was transported to
some weird French enclave where
the baguettes, cheese and bab
bling away in French never stops,"
Negiar said.
Fun-loving Chef Jose, who res
idents refer to as J.J., is a key part
of the house community.
'"J.J. has a great relationship
with the students," said resident
Andrea Fuentes 'l2. "He's per
sonable, fun to be around, jokes a
lot and he's a great cook, as well."
La Maison Fran§aise also
throws public events such as
Crepe Night. In preparation, resi
dents put up wall decorations, lay
tablecloths and hang Christmas
lights to give the house a romantic
feel. When the guests arrive, the
students transform into cooks and
waiters and serve savory and
sweet crepes.
The profits from Crepe Night
go toward funding house activi
ties and excursions. In the past, ex
cursions have included trips to the
de Young Fine Arts Museum of
San Francisco to see a Picasso ex
hibition on loan from the Musee
national Picasso in Paris, or simply
taking outings to French bistros in
the area.
Another popular public event
held at La Maison Franchise is
Cafe Night, which has a more
party-like atmosphere complete
with a D J on one side of the house
and a live jazz band on the other.
"Cafe Night is the best, most
social alternative to the Greek
houses on campus for people who
do not find themselves represent
ed in the crowds at fratjernity]
parties," Negiar said.
Students agree, hailing nights,
classes and food at La Maison
Franchise as a welcome addition
to their Stanford experience.
"My first experience at the
French House was great," said
MauricioAntunano Ts."linstant
ly noticed the unique vibe and it
was a very welcome change from
the usual Stanford atmosphere."
"I love going to the French
House with my friends," said Nar
jis Sarehane 'l3. "Its a charming
place where people can blend into
French culture and traditions in a
different country."

With Toulouse
Lautrec and Ma
tisse-like vintage
posters lined on
the walls, the
works of Descartes on the library
shelves and beef bourguignon
served at meals, La Maison
Francaise lives up to its name as
the campus' French enclave.
La Maison Francaise, other
wise known as French House, is an
undergraduate cultural themed
house located on the Row. It is a
self-op, run and organized by its
residents.
Patricia de Castries, La Maison
Francaise faculty affiliate, de
scribes it as a place where stu
dents "are young and are allowed
to make and learn from their mis
takes."
According to Edouard Negiar
'l3, academic theme associate, the
house enjoys being a very close
knit community. He attributes this
to the residents' shared interest in
French culture.
There are three routes to at
taining residence at La Maison
Frangaise. Students can pre-assign
prior to the housing draw, apply to
be a resident by selecting tier two
in the housing draw or take their
chances at being drawn in by se
lecting tier one.
In the past, the house required
applicants to speak French, have
successfully completed one year
of French at Stanford or have
studied abroad for at least one
quarter through the Bing Over
seas Study Program (BOSP) in
Paris.
The current application, writ
ten in French, asks the candidates
to detail their connection to
France and what they can con
tribute to the house.
Last year, half the current resi
dents pre-assigned while the
other half drew into the house, a
ratio that has been relatively con
stant in recent years.
However, starting this year, ap
plicants do not necessarily have to
speak French to apply for resi
dence in La Maison f rancaise.

"We don't want to exclude
anyone if they don't speak the lan
guage, but rather ask them why
they have a particular interest in
French culture and what they can
add to the community," Negiar
said.
"Part of the excitement is that
people are glad to be here and get
involved in the French communi
ty, but not necessarily speak the
language," he added. "The more
people buy into that, the more
fun."

A unique feature of the house
is the classes offered almost every
day of the week. On Monday,
French conversation classes at be
ginner, intermediate, and ad
vanced levels are held while intro
ductory and advanced wine tast
ing classes, taught by de Castries,
are offered on Tuesdays.
"These classes are among the
most popular at Stanford and they
are almost always filled up the
second registration opens," de
Castries said.

On Wednesdays, Negiar teach
es a French cinema seminar,
screening new wave cinema,
comedies, old classics and modern
French movies.

French Flouse is that we don't
take ourselves too seriously, but
