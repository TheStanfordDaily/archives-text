## Nneka closing out against Cal 
### DEAN MCARDLE STAFF WRITER 
Four years ago, Nnemkadi Ogwumike ar
rived on the Farm as a highly touted recruit
out of Texas. Over the course of her career
she has played in four Final Fours, won four
conference championships, and sits in the
top five in several career statistics. On Sun
day, Ogwumike will play in the final regular
season game of her historic career, as the
Cardinal takes on archrival California on
the road.
Stanford (27-1, 17-0) has already been
crowned the 2012 Pac-12 Champions, but it
will put its perfect conference record on the
line against the Golden Bears. Cal (22-7,13-
4) clinched second place in the conference
with their win over Colorado on Wednes
day.

The last meeting between Stanford and
Cal came down to the wire in an overtime
thriller at Maples. The Cardinal prevailed
74-71, in what would prove to be its only
overtime game of the season thus far.
In that matchup, Stanford led late into
the game before Cal stormed back, scoring
the last nine points of the second half to
force the extra session. In overtime, Cal
missed eight of its nine shots, including two
late three pointers that could have tied the
ballgame.
Sophomore forward Chiney Ogwumike
led the Cardinal against the Golden Bears
in January, posting a double-double with 27
points and 18 rebounds. Sophomore guard
Toni Kokenis joined Chiney in double fig
ures with a 16-point performance.
More recently, in Stanford's 76-52 win
over Seattle on Wednesday, it was business

for usual for Nneka, as she put up a game
high 19 points and collected 11 rebounds. In
addition, younger sister Chiney poured in
18 points and junior forward Joslyn Tinkle
added 14 points. Tinkle has been a stalwart
contributor all season for the Cardinal, av
eraging 8.5 points per game and 5.5 re
bounds per game.
Freshman point guard Amber Orrange
also put up an impressive game against
Seattle, contributing 10 points and dishing
out a career-high nine assists.
Junior guard Layshia Clarendon leads
the Golden Bears with 12.7 points per game.
Clarendon racked up 15 points in Cal's win
over Colorado on Wednesday, and posted
17 against the Cardinal in their last meeting.
