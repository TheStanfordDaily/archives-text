# RIVALRY REMATCH
## CAL VISITS FARM HOPING TO CAPTURE PAC- 12 CROWN 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
It's safe to say that last weekend's games defined
the Stanford men's basketball team's year a sea
son that has featured more twists and turns than a
Martin Scorsese movie. After upsetting 19-9 Col
orado in a convincing 24-point win, the Cardinal
put up a dud against a weak 6-22 Utah team, losing
by one point in the last minute.
But despite the ups and down, when California
rolls into town, everything that happened earlier in
the season ceases to matter. Past matchups, current
records, Pac-12 rankings and tournament position
ing will be irrelevant.
This is an important game for Cal (23-7, 13-4
Pac-12), as they sit just a half game back of Wash
ington for the Pac-12 lead. A win against Stanford
(19-10, 9-8) and a Washington loss against either
USC or UCLA would propel the Golden Bears to a
regular season Pac-12 championship. In Stanford's

Golden Bears defeated the Cardinal 69-59 earlier this season, in part due to the Cardinal's poor shooting performance.
case, a win and a UCLA loss
would move them into the sixth
spot in the conference, and the
chance to exact resssvenge
against Utah. While a lot rests in
the balance for both teams, the
biggest thing on the line is pride
and a year's worth of bragging
rights.
The two teams met up for the
first time on Jan. 29 in Berkeley,
where Stanford put up a disap
pointing road effort. Despite
being down just three points with
8:36 remaining, the Card could
not overcome the deficit, as Cal
went on to beat Stanford by a
final score of 69-59. Sophomore
guard Allen Crabbe led a very
balanced Cal attack with 18
points, and three other Bears fin
ished in double figures. Senior
guard Jorge Gutierrez pitched in
with a solid-11 point, 12-rebound
performance of his own.
Stanford had one of its worst
offensive performances of the
season, failing to score more
than 60 points and shoot over 40
percent. The Card will need to
improve its offensive efficiency if
it wishes to upset a talented Cal
team at Maples Pavilion.
Cal, coming off of a disap
pointing 70-57 loss to Colorado
that saw its Pac-12 regular sea
son title hopes take a serious hit,
will be looking to end the season
with a statement win against
their rival. Their trio of guards
will play a major role, as they are
the top three scorers on the Cali
fornia roster. Crabbe leads the

way, averaging 15.2 points per
game. The 6-foot-6 guard is also
an underrated threat down low,
posting a respectable 5.7 re
bounds per game this season.
Both Gutierrez and sopho
more guard Justin Cobbs are av
eraging 13 points per game, just
off Crabbe's pace. Cobbs, a trans
fer from Minnesota, has been
CaFs best distributor this season,
dishing out five assists per game.
He has largely contributed to
Cal's balanced scoring attack, but
he is also the most efficient scorer
of the trio, shooting 49 percent
from the field. Stanford will need
to slow down Cal's backcourt if it
wishes to thwart its rival's chance
of bringing home a Pac-12 regular
season title.
The Card has no reason to
feel overwhelmed, as it features
two very solid guards of its own
in freshman Chasson Randle and
sophomore Aaron Bright. The
young pair has led Stanford this
season, with Randle averaging
13 points and Bright 11. They will
have the daunting task of slow
ing down the Cal backcourt.
Senior forward Josh Owens is
Stanford's biggest advantage.
Owens, the Cardinal's second
leading scorer on the year, poses
the biggest mismatch for the
Golden Bears, as they do not
have a player who can rival his
skill and athleticism on the post.
He will need to come up big if
Stanford wishes to pull off the
upset.
The underdog Cardinal wel
comes the Bears into Maples
Pavilion at 2:30 p.m. on Sunday,
March 4.
