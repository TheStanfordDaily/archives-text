# VYING FOR NUMBER ONE
## 
### DANIEL LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
The mark of a good team is righting the
ship and making the necessary adjustments
to improve on its mistakes the next time
out. The Stanford men's volleyball team,
ranked No. 2 in the nation, has a chance to
prove that it can make these adjustments
coming off a weekend split against Pepper
dine and USC.
The Cardinal (12-3,9-2 MPSF) will face
UC-San Diego (3-13,1-10) and No. 3 UC-
Irvine (12-3,8-3) in a rematch of the games
played two weeks ago, in which the Cardi
nal swept its Southern California foes on
the road.
Defending its home turf will continue
to be crucial for Stanford if the team hopes
to keep pace with top-ranked and first
place UCLA in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) conference
race. The Cardinal currently stands one
game behind the Bruins and one slip-up
could prove to be the difference at the
end, especially in a conference as tough as
the MPSF.
"You can't breathe that sigh of relief in
the MPSF until you score the final point,
and that's something we can do better,"
senior captain Brad Lawson said. "Bat
tling until the end and maintaining focus
and intensity over the course of an entire
match."
The challenge for the Cardinal on Fri
day may very well be the focus and intensi
ty Lawson talked about. Stanford will take
on cellar-dwelling UCSD in a warm-up for
its match against UCI on Saturday. The Tri-

tons come into the match having lost their
past six matches, two of them coming from
last week at the hands of Cal State-North
ridge and Long Beach State,
The last time these two teams met, Stan
ford prevailed in four sets thanks to stand
out performances from Lawson, senior
Evan Barry and sophomore Brian Cook.
Stanford was able to have its way offensive
ly, cruising to 60 kills on 99 attempts with a
.455 hitting percentage. Three players
Lawson, Cook, and sophomore Steven
Irvin each finished with 15 or more kills.
The key to stalling UCSD's attack will
once again be stopping redshirt junior Carl
Eberts and sophomore Vaun Lennon, both
of whom average better than 2.5 kills per
set. Also joining in the mix will be emerging
junior Johl Awerkamp, who posted the
match high for kills in both of UCSD's
matches last week.
Against UC-Irvine, the team that cur
rently sits one game behind the Cardinal in
the conference standings, the game plan
should be more of the same: efficient of
fense and solid defense.
In Stanford's three-set win over the
Anteaters two weeks ago, the Cardinal's
hitters were able to hit for a combined .463
hitting percentage, an impressive perform
ance against anyone, especially the No. 3
team in the country. Momentum, however,
may have been the key to the match. The
Cardinal was able to seize control following
a marathon first set, fighting off eight set
points before a kill from Irvin won the set
for Stanford.
The Anteaters head into the weekend
on a three-game win streak, thanks to out-

standing play by senior All-American Car
son Clark and juniors Chris Austin and
Kevin Tillie. Much of Stanford's success last
time can be attributed to keeping Clark and
Tillie in check, as the duo was held to a com
bined .238 hitting percentage for the match.
When the Cardinal plays high-percent
age volleyball, it has been hard to beat this
season. In all three of Stanford's defeats,
the Cardinal was thoroughly out-hit, in
cluding a weak performance in its disap
pointing loss to USC last Saturday.

"After watching film we saw that we just
need to do the little things better. Cover our
hitters better, better block moves, and then
we'll continue to improve our serve-and
pass game," Irvin said. "If we improve on all
of these things we should great in the tight
matches."
Stanford is back in action tonight and to
morrow night at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.

match."
The challenge for the Cardinal on Fri
day may very well be the focus and intensi
ty Lawson talked about. Stanford will take
on cellar-dwelling UCSD in a warm-up for
its match against UCI on Saturday. The Tri-

tons come into the match having lost their
past six matches, two of them coming from
last week at the hands of Cal State-North
ridge and Long Beach State,
The last time these two teams met, Stan
ford prevailed in four sets thanks to stand
out performances from Lawson, senior
Evan Barry and sophomore Brian Cook.
Stanford was able to have its way offensive
ly, cruising to 60 kills on 99 attempts with a
.455 hitting percentage. Three players
Lawson, Cook, and sophomore Steven
Irvin each finished with 15 or more kills.
The key to stalling UCSD's attack will
once again be stopping redshirt junior Carl
Eberts and sophomore Vaun Lennon, both
of whom average better than 2.5 kills per
set. Also joining in the mix will be emerging
junior Johl Awerkamp, who posted the
match high for kills in both of UCSD's
matches last week.
Against UC-Irvine, the team that cur
rently sits one game behind the Cardinal in
the conference standings, the game plan
should be more of the same: efficient of
fense and solid defense.
In Stanford's three-set win over the
Anteaters two weeks ago, the Cardinal's
hitters were able to hit for a combined .463
hitting percentage, an impressive perform
ance against anyone, especially the No. 3
team in the country. Momentum, however,
may have been the key to the match. The
Cardinal was able to seize control following
a marathon first set, fighting off eight set
points before a kill from Irvin won the set
for Stanford.
The Anteaters head into the weekend
on a three-game win streak, thanks to out-

standing play by senior All-American Car
son Clark and juniors Chris Austin and
Kevin Tillie. Much of Stanford's success last
time can be attributed to keeping Clark and
Tillie in check, as the duo was held to a com
bined .238 hitting percentage for the match.
When the Cardinal plays high-percent
age volleyball, it has been hard to beat this
season. In all three of Stanford's defeats,
the Cardinal was thoroughly out-hit, in
cluding a weak performance in its disap
pointing loss to USC last Saturday.

"After watching film we saw that we just
need to do the little things better. Cover our
hitters better, better block moves, and then
we'll continue to improve our serve-and
pass game," Irvin said. "If we improve on all
of these things we should great in the tight
matches."
Stanford is back in action tonight and to
morrow night at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
