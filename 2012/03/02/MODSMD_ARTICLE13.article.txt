# CARD SET FOR PAC- 12 DOUBLE DIP
## 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
It's been a few weeks since the
Stanford women's tennis team
handed then-No. 1 ranked Florida
its first loss, replacing the Gators
as the top team in the nation. This
victory gave the Cardinal the mo
mentum it needed to easily cruise
past both St. Mary's and San Fran
cisco in its most recent matches.
Due to a new computer-gener
ated ITA ranking system, howev
er, No. 11 Stanford (6-0,1-0 Pac
-12) enters this weekend as the un
derdog once more at least on
paper.
Stanford will take on No. 7 Cal
ifornia (6-3, 0-0) this Friday and
then travel north to Washington
to face the No. 28 Huskies (5-2,0-
0) in a double-header weekend.
Although the Stanford players
don't pay much attention to the
rankings, this weekend's matches
will nonetheless provide the team
with an opportunity to prove it
self. Cal especially will be a tough
test for the Cardinal as both
squads have nationally ranked
singles players backed up by deep
lineups.
"I think regardless of the sport,
there's always something special
and exciting about playing Cal,
but it really couldn't be much
more competitive than for ten
nis." sophomore Kristie Ahn said.
"I've known some of their players
since the [junior tennis], so it's al
ways entertaining to think that
we're mortal enemies."
Cal's No. 1 player, Jana Jurico
va, has not been playing as of late,
but Ahn acknowledged that the
Cardinal needs to be prepared,
whether she steps back into the
lineup or not.
Senior captain Veronica Li
kept the focus on the Cardinal, as
she views this weekend's upcom
ing match as a chance to measure
Stanford's development this far
into the regular season.
"I'm really excited for this
match because I think it will push
all of us individually and chal
lenge us to play our best," Li said.

"Playing Cal at their house is al
ways a battle, but I'm looking for
ward to gauging our improvement
in the past few weeks."
No. 28 Washington will also
test the players' adaptability, as
they will be playing in unfamiliar
conditions.
"Washington definitely has a
home court advantage because
they're used to playing on indoor
courts," Li explained. "The court
surface is quicker, and we're going
to have to adjust our games to be
prepared for that."
Li and Ahn both recognized
the hardships that come along
with not only competing in two
matches in one weekend, but also
the travel associated with it.
"I think being on the road
forces us to prepare even more
carefully," Li said. "It's taxing to
spend that many hours traveling
and by the time we get back,
everyone is usually exhausted.
We're traveling a lot over the next
two weeks so it's important to get
ahead in school right now, rest and
prepare."
As captain, Li said she realizes
that she's lucky to be surrounded
by such driven teammates.
"My job has been easy in the
sense that I don't have to micro
manage people," Li said. "Every
one is pretty independent and
good at taking care of issues like
class conflicts and injuries. Travel

ing definitely brings the team to
gether because it's only us away
from the chaos of campus."
Ahn, who just recently re
turned from injury, highlighted
the benefits of playing alongside
her teammates once again, even in
an unfamiliar environment.
"I forgot how much of a boost
you can get from seeing your
teammate taking the lead or fight
ing through a tough point," she
said.
She should get plenty of moti
vation in this weekend's two
matches, especially from Li, her
doubles partner. Although Ahn,
who played doubles with Gibbs
for much of last year, has switched
to the forehand side with Li, she
feels confident about both singles
and doubles going into the week
end.
"I think I've done pretty well
considering the circumstances,"
she said. "Although, I do have a lot
of room for improvement."
Ahn and the Stanford
women's squad will all have the
opportunity to put their hard
work to the test this weekend at
Cal on Friday at 1:30 p.m. and
again at Washington on Sunday at
noon.
