## MARKS MY WORDS Hugging or bugging? 
### Miriam Marks 
How do you say "hi" to that
person you're really happy
to see? You can wave,
pound fists or flash a big smile and
just say something like,"Wow, it is
so great to see you!" But in this
day and age, only one thing really
does the moment justice, captur
ing the full range of happy senti
ments in one action: a hug.
Do you like hugs? Yes, you do.
You shouldn't even have to think
about the question, because biol
ogy suggests that we humans are
programmed to love hugs. The
sensation of touch is a fundamen
tal part of our animal instincts,
and studies show that hugs may
also boost the release of oxytocin,
our "cuddle hormone," Even if
you think you don't like hugs, if
you find hugging to be a useless
and pointless ritual, chances are
your hormones say otherwise.
Still, it's one thing to enjoy a
hug from a close friend, family
member or significant other. It's
another thing to want to hug
every random person you come
across on campus. But that's the
way things are developing
there are hugs everywhere and

from almost everyone, whether
you like it or not. From Free Hug
campaigns to hugs from col
leagues who are not quite your
friends, less-than-intimate hug
ging is here to stay.
And while you don't have to
seek out a free hug from a hippie
holding a cardboard sign, the eter
nally complicated question re
mains: When are you metaphori
cally close enough to someone to
warrant a hug?
The strangest hug of all, in my
opinion, is the goodbye hug after
the first meeting with a stranger.
You've been emailing this
stranger for a week, and finally
the two of you meet in a coffee
shop or cafe to talk about some
thing vaguely professional. This
person is definitely not your peer,
but he or she is only a few years
older than you, so you get along
quite well. Soon enough, it is time
to say goodbye.
So, is it time for a hug? An
swers may vary, but my experi
ence has shown that the hug is the
unofficially proper way to end
that type of interaction. But the
person was a stranger! Ah yes, a

stranger an hour ago. After that
hour, you two must celebrate the
fact that you managed to get
along by hugging.
The unique thing about hug
ging is that once someone goes in
for the hug, you can't back away:
The intent to hug is binding. How
many times has a proffered hug
completely caught you off guard?
"Oh, I didn't know we were hug
ging friends ..." you think to
yourself as you extend your arms
stiffly in return and close your
eyes to make the moments pass by
more quickly. Or perhaps, in a mo
ment of unbridled enthusiasm,
you open yourself up for a hug
only to have the other person ten
tatively do the same, barely brush
you and recoil as if you were dis
eased.
Then there are the hugs that,

even if mutual, just don't feel
right. Because hugs mean differ
ent things to different people,
styles may clash. For some peo
ple, a "hug" just means a simulta
neous pat on the back. Serious
huggers prefer the full-body,
two-arm, front-to-front hug,
while others go for a one-arm,
side-to-side hug that is more like
a mutual lean than a true em
brace. Of equal consideration
are hug duration and hug move
ment: Some huggers want to

hold onto you for about 30 sec
onds longer than you anticipat
ed. Some huggers want to sway
from side to side while holding
onto you. In this brave new
world of hugging, we have no
choice but to acclimate to oth
ers' quirks.
Is hugging on the rise? We may
be hugging more because we're
comfortable being uninhibited in
our biological instincts or, maybe,
because everybody else is doing
it. A 2009 article in The New York
Times observed the growing phe
nomenon at the high school level,
in which many teenagers' most
common greeting had suddenly
become the hug. Now, in 2012,
many of those teenagers are col

lege students. This means that
hugging, like knowledge of the
Backstreet Boys, is moving up the
generational ladder.
This suggests that the race to
embrace will only continue in the
future. Even as I type, thousands
of college students accustomed
to hugging are moving into the
professional realm. Are you and
your professors on hugging
terms? Not yet. Do you hug your
boss? It may happen soon. It's
time for us to get used to hugs, for
they will only continue to bring
us closer together.
