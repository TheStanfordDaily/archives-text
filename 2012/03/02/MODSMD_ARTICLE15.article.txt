# EXISTENTIAL FORTUNE COOKIES
## Time machines and the bubble 
### Sebastain Gould 
I have been told repeatedly not
to make gross generalizations
about the state of the world and
the beliefs of millions I've never
met before. This time, I will make a
justifiable exception to the rule. I
think people generally do not have
a desire to die; this is evident be
cause so many people are alive
today. People like to live.
This desire to live is a very pecu
liar thing. While there is only one
opposite to living, there is an
unimaginable number of ways in
which to not die. What fascinates
me then, is the many different ways
in which people choose to live.
Let's look at two common phrases:
Is the "unexamined life not worth
living" as Socrates says, or is "igno
rance bliss"?
While I can't tell you which
choice is better, I can tell you one
thing: how I choose to live.
Stanford has afforded me the
opportunity to explore the world
with little recourse. I could go
abroad, not go abroad, read books
all day or just sleep in. At the end of
the day, there is still a sense of secu
rity because at least until I gradu
ate, Stanford isn't going anywhere.
This sense of security leads us all to
believe that the world is waiting for

us to take charge of it. We learn
more than our friends from back
home, we learn more than our par
ents ever did. Some may even think
that we learn more than students at
other top-tier universities. But at
the end of the day, that learning
takes place under this sense of se
curity.
When you think of Stanford stu
dents, you see them working hard,
overachieving and, well, thriving. It
isn't easy, but in away it is blissful.
You don't think of someone failing.
At Stanford we can have that sense
of security ignorance, even
because there is no one there warn
ing us about failure. Everything
and everyone around us indicates
that we will succeed no matter
what.
When I left Stanford, I felt that
security evaporate. I joined the Ma
rine Corps, but that wasn't the
hardest part. The hardest part was
being unable to find a part-time job

when I returned from Iraq, while I
was waiting to come back to school.
No one would hire me, even as a
short-order cook. The idea that I
might not be able to get a job to
feed myself, and would conse
quently be unable to return to
Stanford, was frightening. In the
end, I did find a part-time job and I
did come back to Stanford, but be
fore those events happened, I had
no way of knowing they would take
place. I tell you this because I've re
alized that I will have to face that
same uncertainty again, but this
time when I graduate. How will I
act, then?
The answer, of course, is simple,
but the process is difficult.The dan
ger we all face by being in this Stan
ford bubble is that if we ever do fail,
we are unprepared. We could sit all
day and convince ourselves that we
will succeed, but if we do fail, it can
be devastating. What we should do
is think about what it means to fail.
Instead of being ignorant about the
potentiality of failure, we should
consider what we would do if we
don't succeed in our endeavors.
This is where the idea of an exam
ined life becomes very important.

In preparing for graduation I
encourage you all to do as I have:
consider what would happen if
you fail. If you have never failed
before, over-commit yourself
while you're here to the point that
you fail at something. Then exam
ine that failure, and prepare your
self for a future outside the Stan
ford bubble of security.

Never failed in your entire life?
