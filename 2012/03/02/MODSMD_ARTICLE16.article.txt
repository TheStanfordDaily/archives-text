# OP-ED
## Putting the Fadi Quran episode in perspective 
### 
This past week has seen two
op-eds published in The
Daily supporting Fadi
Quran and trying to mobilize the
campus to issue a resolution ex
pressing concern for his welfare. I
find it a bit ironic that the discus
sion in the ASSU Senate took
place after Fadi was released
from prison, but this, perhaps
more than anything, highlights
the conviction among certain
groups on this campus to issue
anti-Israel resolutions at all costs.
What is more concerning to
me is the way in which Israel has
been represented in these op-eds.

As if for some reason Israel has
nothing better to do with its re
sources and the lives of its young
men than to occupy the Palestini
ans, and according to an op-ed
piece published yesterday by Jeff
Mendelman ("Shame on us,"
March 1), it somehow "benefits"
from the occupation "at the ex
pense of the Palestinians."
So lets just get one thing
straight here: Nobody wants to
occupy the Palestinians. Not the
Israeli people, not the Israeli gov
ernment and certainly not the Is
raeli soldiers who are shown on
the video footage arresting Fadi. I

can assure you that these soldiers,
who are most likely 20 years old,
would much rather be at college
than be drafted into the army,
where they face stones and Molo
tov cocktails on good days, and
live fire and suicide bombers on
bad ones.
So if nobody wants it, why does
it still exist? Well, lets start with a
brief history lesson. In the past 12
years, Israel unilaterally withdrew
its forces from two areas under its
control in the hope of achieving
peace with its neighbors. In 2000
Israel withdrew from southern
Lebanon, and in 2006 they did the

same from the Gaza Strip. In re
turn, Israel has been attacked
with more than 10,000 rockets
and missiles from the terrorist or
ganizations which took over:
Hezbollah and Hamas. And while
Israel is being criticized here al
most daily, no one seems to be
bothered by the fact that the char
ters of these organizations openly
call for the destruction of the state
of Israel and the rejection of any
peace initiative with the state of
Israel and the latter even calls
for the murder of Jews wherever
they may be.
But what does all that have to

do with a non-violent protest
against the occupation? Well, ac
cording to a recent poll conduct
ed by the Palestinian Center for
public opinion, support for the
Hamas organization is on the
rise, and it has recently joined the
official Palestinian government.
Furthermore, according to the
same poll, the overwhelming ma
jority of Palestinians' notion of
peace includes the right of return.
The right of return essentially
means that five million Palestin
ian refugees will be allowed to
immigrate to Israel, almost dou
bling its current population. This
is effectively a call to the de
struction of Israel. And when the
current chairman of the Pales
tinian authority refuses to even
utter the words "Jewish state,"
let alone acknowledge its right
to exist, one does not need to
think very hard about what a
unilateral Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank would look
like. This time however, Israel's
enemies would be able to estab
lish their bases just 10 miles

away from Israel's largest cities.
Just imagine Al-Qaeda setting
up shop in San Jose and you
would get the idea.
So next time someone talks to
you about ending the occupa
tion, remember to read the fine
print, because any discussion of
the occupation without address
ing these concerns is simply slan
der against the state of Israel.
Now don't get me wrong, I sup
port Fadi, his non-violent ways,
and I support his goal of estab
lishing a Palestinian state. I just
want to see it established along
side the state of Israel, not in its
place.
