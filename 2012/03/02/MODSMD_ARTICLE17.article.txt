## Facebook flippancy and public debate 
### 
In 1916, Eugen Rosenstock-
Huessy and Franz Rosen
zweig, two prominent Ger
man intellectuals with differing
religious beliefs, engaged in a
spirited exchange of letters about
the place of Judaism and Christi
anity within the broader trajecto
ry of history. Written from the
trenches of WWI, the letters are
rich with allusions to theological
debates between Judaism and
Christianity and lively with pas
sionate defenses of their particu
lar religious tradition.Though the
two friends were in disagree
ment, the letters showed a deep
engagement with the substance
of the other's ideas; the positions
are defended eruditely and each
man is forced to engage with a
position deeply different from his
own.

opposing position in five words
or fewer. These flippant Face
book statuses become a conver
sation-stopper few of us want
to become mired in a public
"comment war" and in the ab
sence of someone sitting across
the dinner table or a friend to
challenge your view, opinions are
left half-formed, unexplained
and often unchallenged.
Of course, Facebook can be
used to quickly raise awareness
and spread information, which
makes it an important comple
ment to face-to-face or well-writ
ten moral and political debates.
The support expressed following
Stanford graduate and activist
Fadi Quran's arrest is a perfect
example of this, where Facebook
posters, perhaps sensing that the
campus is more divided on the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict than it is
on other issues, offered more
well-reasoned descriptions and
defenses of his protest actions.
Occasionally, Facebook is also
used as a forum for productive
discussion about a topic for
example, the lively debate about
Ezra Klein's Wall Street recruit
ment column published in
Bloomberg News but the neg
ative connotation surrounding
the term "comment war" to de
scribe a back-and-forth disagree
ment on Facebook suggests that
on the whole, we do not see Face
book as a forum for spirited dis
agreement. Facebook and
Twitter, according to some, have
become valuable tools of self-ex
pression, but it is important that
we do not let one-line proclama
tions and two-line rebuttals serve
as replacements for deep and
complex engagement with the
substance of each other's ideas.
What is lost in these abbreviated
proclamations and stilted rebut
tals is more than a fascinating ex
change of ideas; we lose the op
portunity to have our opinions
challenged and shaped by lively
argument. The ways in which we
use Facebook and Twitter often
make these would-be arguments
either nonexistent or shallow and
ineffectual.
Because more and more of
our public discourse plays out on
these online media, we ought to
use them in away that does not
suppress discussion regarding
controversial political views. So
perhaps rather than posting com
ments that ridicule certain politi
cal or ideological beliefs, thereby
closing the door for an effective
dialogue, we should frame our
posts in away that respects those
with whom we disagree. We
should attempt to forge a more
productive public discourse, both
on these forums and outside of
them, and avoid the polarization
that stems from brazen one-line
pronouncements and angry
three-word rebuttals.

Trying to imagine the 2012
equivalent of this exchange
played out with Twitter @'s or
Facebook likes â€”is dispiriting.
Has the brevity and extempora
neous nature of social media flat
tened the richness of well-rea
soned argument? Has it allowed
us to brazenly post articles ac
companied by ten-word taglines
in lieu of developing substantive
positions on important issues?
Do the posted words of a Huffin
gton Post blogger become a sub
stitute for our own ideas? Abor
tion and contraception are just
some of the issues that have ignit
ed Facebook statuses and Twitter
feeds over the past few weeks.
Statuses loudly condemn Rick
Santorum's objections to abor
tion as those of a religious zealot
or decry Catholic input into con
traception as a vast overreaching
of the Church's power. People
make brazen and potentially of
fensive proclamations that they
would perhaps frame in more nu
anced tones over a dining hall dis
cussion or in a conversation with
an acquaintance, settings where
they would be forced to offer a
reasoned argument for their posi
tion. In this sense, it is far too easy
for Facebook to become a tool of
self-validation, where you post an
article with a bold proclamation
of your position, your circle of
friends who share your opinion
"like" it, and you feel validated
that your view is well reasoned.
These Facebook posts offer little
to no opportunity to explore
knotty and nuanced questions
about the interplay between pri
vate moral convictions and public
political candidacy, the role of re
ligiously motivated nonprofits in
civil society, or other interesting
questions of our time.
We advocate safe and open
spaces at Stanford, where respect
for different opinions and
lifestyles is emphasized, yet often
Facebook turns into a hostile
space where flippant proclama
tions are posted that dismiss the
