## LEAP DAY â€“ TOP 5 RANDOM FACTS 
### 
This past week, the rarest of events took
place: February 29. This elusive day
comes around only once every four
years and turns out to have some pretty
fascinating trivia associated with it.
Check out our list of the most random
Leap Day info.

Birthdays
People born on Leap Day have acquired
a number of nicknames, from "leapers" to,
adorably, "leaplings." On non leap-year
years (officially called common years),
leaplings typically celebrate their birthdays
on March Ist, though some take advantage
of the oddity and celebrate both days. The
fact that leaplings age every year but only
have official birthdays every four years has
been played for laughs, including in the
Pirates of Penzance when Frederic the pirate
apprentice discovers that he has to serve the
pirates until his twenty-first birthday not
his twenty-first year meaning extra
decades of servitude.

Proposals
According to many European traditions,
women may only propose to men in leap
years, or sometimes only on Leap Day. And
the men that refuse these proposals have to
"pay fines." This dates from a rumored law,
passed in 1288 by the then-5-year-old Queen
Margaret, which said men must pay for
refusals with a kiss or a silk gown. In
Denmark, refusal must be compensated with
12 pairs of gloves. Meanwhile, Greek tradi
tion says it's unlucky to marry on a leap year
one in five Greek couples will wait to
avoid getting married during a leap year.

Academy Awards
The Academy Awards usually happen near
the end of February, so it's unsurprising that a
few ceremonies have actually taken place on

Leap Day. Highlights include 2004, when
"Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"
won eleven Academy Awards, tying the all
time record held by "Titanic" and "Ben Hur."
Also, on the Leap Day of 1940, "Gone with
the Wind" won eight awards. You don't really
need an excuse to watch these classic films,
but we're giving you one anyway.

Important Events
Leap years currently coincide with both US
presidential elections and the Summer
Olympic Games. This year, the Summer
Olympics will be held in London, and in the
fall Barack Obama will be up for re-election.
It's not just your imagination this is a big
year for news.

Other Leap systems
While the Gregorian calendar uses a Leap
Day to make up for the fact that earth takes
slightly more than 365 days to orbit the sun
fully, other systems do it differently. Both the
Hindu and Buddhist calendars add an extra
month every few years, while the Iranian cal
endar adds an extra day every four years, but
every 33 years the leap years are five years
apart. This system is more accurate than ours,
but also a bit more confusing.
