## Occupy Stanford rallies, marches at Cal 
### NEEL THAKKAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Members of Occupy Stanford spent
Thursday demonstrating in Berkeley
and Oakland in support of Occupy Ed
ucation, a movement protesting fund
ing cuts of public education and tuition
hikes in the University of California
system.
The rallies, which were part of a na
tionwide Day of Action to support pub
lic education, kicked off a five-day
march in Northern California to the
Capitol building in Sacramento, where
demonstrators plan to begin occupying
the Capitol on Monday.
"This movement won't stop," said

Laura Wells, the Green Party candidate
for governor in 2010, to The Daily. "You
can't deal the next generation a lack of
opportunity and expect them to sit
there and take it."
After smaller teach-ins and discus
sions under the rafters of the UC-
Berkeley Martin Luther King Jr. Stu
dent Union building, Thursday's main
action began at noon in Berkeley's
Sproul Plaza, under drizzling rain.
The 16 Stanford demonstrators led
off the rally, taking turns reading an en
thusiastically received statement of sol
idarity to a huddled group of about 150
UC-Berkeley students and staff and

Occupy movements from around the state gathered at UC-Berkeley Thursday for a rally
on California's higher education system. Occupy Stanford began the event by reading a
statement of support and later marched with demonstrators six miles to Oakland.
city locals.
"An education like one re
ceives at Stanford should not be
'elite,' and you should not have
to be 'lucky' to get an education,"
the statement read. "We won't
accept a future where access to
education is a privilege, and not a
right."
Students drafted the state
ment in Meyer Library Wednes
day evening.
"I know California is in a
budget crisis," said Josh Schott
'l4 to The Daily before the event,
"but education should always be
a No. 1 priority because it's a key
ingredient of democracy."
The hour-long rally featured
speakers whose various demands
reflected the diversity of the au
dience.
Andrea Barrera, a senior at
UC-Berkeley, called for the
restoration of affirmative action,
while Joshua Clover, an English
professor from UC-Davis, said a
wholesale restructuring of capi
talism is necessary.
Others recounted previous
protest experiences or asked for
protection of union rights. Deco
rating the plaza were murals
painted by local high school stu
dents for the occasion.
"Don't close the colleges,"
one painting read. "We're com
ing."
After the rally, with the
weather clearing up, about 100
protesters gathered to make the
six-mile march to Oakland's
Oscar Grant Plaza, where Occu
py Oakland and students from
other area colleges were meet-

ing. To chants of "No cuts, no fees,
education must be free," the
crowd fanned across the breadth
of Telegraph Avenue.
The public they met along the
way matched their enthusiasm,
for the most part. The marchers
were met with many honks of ap
preciation, but also a few ob
scene gestures. One motorist was
so incensed he got out of his car,
punched a demonstrator and
sped away.
Though the rally and march
were smaller than previous
demonstrations, the atmosphere
among the protesters remained
hopeful.
Edwin Okongo, a lecturer in
Swahili at UC-Berkeley, said he
was marching for his nine
month-old daughter, whom he
used to bring to Occupy Oakland
protests.

"She's part of that, the
protest," he said, "and [it's im
portant] to know that you can't
just sit back and wait for things to
be handed to you. You have to
fight for them."
It helps that he also lives in
Oakland, Okongo added.
"If this runs into any trouble
or anything, I'll just say I was
walking home," he laughed.
Another marcher, Paul
Bloom said he has been a resi
dent of Berkeley for almost 40
years and has been involved in
activism for even longer.
"You make your path by
walking, and this is kind of con
sciously doing that," Bloom said.
"This is just one day, and a rainy
day at that... I don't think you
can take a quick measurement
and say we're doing well because
we have a thousand people or
we're not doing so well because
we have 200 or this or that."
After two hours of walking,

during which the number of
marchers dwindled to about 80,
the crowd arrived at Oscar Grant
Plaza, chanting, "Here comes
Berkeley."
Joined with the protesters al
ready there, the size of the whole
crowd swelled to just under 200,
as it prepared to begin the "99
Mile March for Education and
Social Justice" to Sacramento.
Though about 80 people were
committed to walking at least
part of the way, organizers said
they expect thousands at the
protest that on March 5.
Here the group from Stanford
parted ways with one of its mem-

bers, Peter McDonald Tl, who is
walking the entire distance to the
Capitol. Other Occupy Stanford
members will join him when he
gets there.
McDonald explained why he
decided to make the "99-mile
march," saying that Stanford stu
dents are usually too concerned
with academics.
"[At Stanford], everyone's al
ways so focused on the class in
front of them that it's hard to en
gage," he said. "Marching 80
miles is a really important state
ment."
Occupy Stanford expanded
the scope of its operations this

quarter, participating in Occupy
Wall Street West in January and
coordinating with Occupy move
ments around the Bay Area.
The group has faced questions
on campus about the size and
strength of its movement, but
Occupy members said they be
lieve their involvement in
demonstrations such as Thurs
day's proves otherwise.
"You can always criticize peo
ple for shouting," said Emma
Wilde Botta 'l4. "But this is more
doing something concrete,"
