It goes without saying that when a
concert involves bassist Dave
Holland and saxophonist Chris
Potter in collaboration it's going
to be good. Holland's rhapsodic synco
pated bass lines and Potter's counter
point cerebral, dissonant, rich sax are at
their best live and always sound amaz
ing, no matter who the two are playing
with.
They've both played with their fair
share of masters: Holland with Miles
Davis and Potter recently with Herbie
Hancock and McCoy Tyner. These two
are born performers, completely bril
liant and enthralling on stage; despite
owning all of their albums, I rarely lis
ten to them at home but never miss
their concerts. Yet what makes these two
real performers is not just their inven
tiveness but also their knack for togeth
erness.
Holland and Potter have been play
ing together in the Dave Holland
Overtone Quartet for years, and it
shows; they are remarkably in sync.
Holland knows how to lead a band to
collaborate, to build off one another, to
keep adding layers of rhythm and har
mony step by step. I've seen Potter do
the same when he leads his
Underground band. While most jazz
groups play next to one another
alternating turns in solos and melodies

Holland and Potter are all about
playing together, with and against each
other and other players.
In short, these two are masters. It's
because of these incredibly high stan
dards that last Friday's sold-out Dave
Holland Overtone Quartet concert at
the Palace of Fine Arts was a disap
pointment. It was still a great night of
jazz, but it was missing their trademark
cohesiveness.
The group played all original pieces
by each of the band members. They
started out with Potter's "The
Outsiders," which established the basic
form and rules of the group. The
modus operandi was for the two to
build on one another by synchronizing
completely in a melodic or rhythmic
element, then diverging to eventually
create four separate parts interde
pendent melodically but each mov
ing and developing independently.
The result was four layers of sound.
As the saxophonist, Potter's layer had the
greatest clarity; Holland's was equally
lucid when audible, but the poor
acoustics of the hall tended to drown out
much of his work. Though he is a talent
ed pianist, Jason Moran's playing sound
ed muddy in the quarter; he was best
showcased in his own compositions, like
