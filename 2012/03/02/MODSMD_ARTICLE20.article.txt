It goes without saying that when a
concert involves bassist Dave
Holland and saxophonist Chris
Potter in collaboration it's going
to be good. Holland's rhapsodic synco
pated bass lines and Potter's counter
point cerebral, dissonant, rich sax are at
their best live and always sound amaz
ing, no matter who the two are playing
with.
They've both played with their fair
share of masters: Holland with Miles
Davis and Potter recently with Herbie
Hancock and McCoy Tyner. These two
are born performers, completely bril
liant and enthralling on stage; despite
owning all of their albums, I rarely lis
ten to them at home but never miss
their concerts. Yet what makes these two
real performers is not just their inven
tiveness but also their knack for togeth
erness.
Holland and Potter have been play
ing together in the Dave Holland
Overtone Quartet for years, and it
shows; they are remarkably in sync.
Holland knows how to lead a band to
collaborate, to build off one another, to
keep adding layers of rhythm and har
mony step by step. I've seen Potter do
the same when he leads his
Underground band. While most jazz
groups play next to one another
alternating turns in solos and melodies

Holland and Potter are all about
playing together, with and against each
other and other players.
In short, these two are masters. It's
because of these incredibly high stan
dards that last Friday's sold-out Dave
Holland Overtone Quartet concert at
the Palace of Fine Arts was a disap
pointment. It was still a great night of
jazz, but it was missing their trademark
cohesiveness.
The group played all original pieces
by each of the band members. They
started out with Potter's "The
Outsiders," which established the basic
form and rules of the group. The
modus operandi was for the two to
build on one another by synchronizing
completely in a melodic or rhythmic
element, then diverging to eventually
create four separate parts interde
pendent melodically but each mov
ing and developing independently.
The result was four layers of sound.
As the saxophonist, Potter's layer had the
greatest clarity; Holland's was equally
lucid when audible, but the poor
acoustics of the hall tended to drown out
much of his work. Though he is a talent
ed pianist, Jason Moran's playing sound
ed muddy in the quarter; he was best
showcased in his own compositions, like

"Gummy Moon," which emphasizes
what the piano can offer. Eric
Harland, on drums, sidestepped the
normal errors of the percussion sec
tion: he didn't bang but worked
meticulously to play with pitch, vol
ume, silences and rhythm.

Unfortunately, his commitment to
complex rhythms more often than
not resulted in chaotic rhythms.
Things picked up with oppor
tunities to showcase Holland and
Potter in extended solos in
Holland's "Walkin' the Walk" and

Eric Harland's "Treachery."
Harland's "Patterns" was an exercise
in repetition: while Potter looped
through the same few bars, each of
the others slowly built up addition
al layers of sound with their own
internal repetitive logic. It could
have been stagnant but it was
dynamic, with a real sense of for
ward motion.
Harland is no Nate Smith, the
drummer in both the Dave
Holland Quintet another group
of Holland's and Chris Potter's
Underground. Smith has proven
himself to be the Jack Dejohnette
of our generation: he builds har
monies and uses others' rhythms to
develop a scintillating base rhythm,
which all other parts play off of and
complement. His drumming has
been the glue that holds these two
groups together because it adds to

advancements in rhythmic com
plexities and points us in the direc
tion that the music is developing.
Harland doesn't take advantage of
silences enough to do this, which
means that while he can play off
one or two of the parts successfully
and he did so beautifully in
Holland's "Veil of Tears" his
playing doesn't tie everyone togeth
er in a singular, cohesive unit.
What we have, at best, are two
players who completely integrate
and mesh; we can even have two
sets of two. But never did the four
consistently develop each other's
work. Don't get me wrong this
still leads to some great music. It
just highlights the inherent disso
nance in the kind of music they
play, and it doesn't showcase what
these performers and bandleaders
can galvanize on stage.

The two-hour, intermission
free concert of the Dave Holland
Overtone Quartet was met with a
warm and well-deserved standing
ovation. These are still some of the
best musicians in the world. But
when you hold them to their own
high standards, they could have
done better. The space certainly
didn't help; dampened sound, an
over-large stage and a very wide
auditorium all created awkward
distance between the audience and
performers, which made it more
difficult to engage. Nevertheless, the
SF Jazz Festival Spring Season is
starting off with a bang, and there's
much more great music to come,
from the Brad Mehldau Trio to
Gonzalo Rubalcalba.

with.
They've both played with their fair
share of masters: Holland with Miles
Davis and Potter recently with Herbie
Hancock and McCoy Tyner. These two
are born performers, completely bril
liant and enthralling on stage; despite
owning all of their albums, I rarely lis
ten to them at home but never miss
their concerts. Yet what makes these two
real performers is not just their inven
tiveness but also their knack for togeth
erness.
Holland and Potter have been play
ing together in the Dave Holland
Overtone Quartet for years, and it
shows; they are remarkably in sync.
Holland knows how to lead a band to
collaborate, to build off one another, to
keep adding layers of rhythm and har
mony step by step. I've seen Potter do
the same when he leads his
Underground band. While most jazz
groups play next to one another
alternating turns in solos and melodies

Holland and Potter are all about
playing together, with and against each
other and other players.
In short, these two are masters. It's
because of these incredibly high stan
dards that last Friday's sold-out Dave
Holland Overtone Quartet concert at
the Palace of Fine Arts was a disap
pointment. It was still a great night of
jazz, but it was missing their trademark
cohesiveness.
The group played all original pieces
by each of the band members. They
started out with Potter's "The
Outsiders," which established the basic
form and rules of the group. The
modus operandi was for the two to
build on one another by synchronizing
completely in a melodic or rhythmic
element, then diverging to eventually
create four separate parts interde
pendent melodically but each mov
ing and developing independently.
The result was four layers of sound.
As the saxophonist, Potter's layer had the
greatest clarity; Holland's was equally
lucid when audible, but the poor
acoustics of the hall tended to drown out
much of his work. Though he is a talent
ed pianist, Jason Moran's playing sound
ed muddy in the quarter; he was best
showcased in his own compositions, like

"Gummy Moon," which emphasizes
what the piano can offer. Eric
Harland, on drums, sidestepped the
normal errors of the percussion sec
tion: he didn't bang but worked
meticulously to play with pitch, vol
ume, silences and rhythm.

Unfortunately, his commitment to
complex rhythms more often than
not resulted in chaotic rhythms.
Things picked up with oppor
tunities to showcase Holland and
Potter in extended solos in
Holland's "Walkin' the Walk" and

Eric Harland's "Treachery."
Harland's "Patterns" was an exercise
in repetition: while Potter looped
through the same few bars, each of
the others slowly built up addition
al layers of sound with their own
internal repetitive logic. It could
have been stagnant but it was
dynamic, with a real sense of for
ward motion.
Harland is no Nate Smith, the
drummer in both the Dave
Holland Quintet another group
of Holland's and Chris Potter's
Underground. Smith has proven
himself to be the Jack Dejohnette
of our generation: he builds har
monies and uses others' rhythms to
develop a scintillating base rhythm,
which all other parts play off of and
complement. His drumming has
been the glue that holds these two
groups together because it adds to

advancements in rhythmic com
plexities and points us in the direc
tion that the music is developing.
Harland doesn't take advantage of
silences enough to do this, which
means that while he can play off
one or two of the parts successfully
and he did so beautifully in
Holland's "Veil of Tears" his
playing doesn't tie everyone togeth
er in a singular, cohesive unit.
What we have, at best, are two
players who completely integrate
and mesh; we can even have two
sets of two. But never did the four
consistently develop each other's
work. Don't get me wrong this
still leads to some great music. It
just highlights the inherent disso
nance in the kind of music they
play, and it doesn't showcase what
these performers and bandleaders
can galvanize on stage.

The two-hour, intermission
free concert of the Dave Holland
Overtone Quartet was met with a
warm and well-deserved standing
ovation. These are still some of the
best musicians in the world. But
when you hold them to their own
high standards, they could have
done better. The space certainly
didn't help; dampened sound, an
over-large stage and a very wide
auditorium all created awkward
distance between the audience and
performers, which made it more
difficult to engage. Nevertheless, the
SF Jazz Festival Spring Season is
starting off with a bang, and there's
much more great music to come,
from the Brad Mehldau Trio to
Gonzalo Rubalcalba.
It goes without saying that when a
concert involves bassist Dave
Holland and saxophonist Chris
Potter in collaboration it's going
to be good. Holland's rhapsodic synco
pated bass lines and Potter's counter
point cerebral, dissonant, rich sax are at
their best live and always sound amaz
ing, no matter who the two are playing
with.
