cc corched" creeps up on
slowly, and before
know it, you find
yourself simultaneously terrified,
engrossed, impassioned and
queasy. The play finds a jarring
start in an elaborate set that doesn't
seem to belong in any particular
place, where Simon (Babak Tafti)
and Janine (Annie Purcell) make
an uncomfortable visit to the
notary Alphonse (David
Strathairn, "Good Night and Good
Luck") to hear their mother's will.
The pair stands still for seemingly
unending minutes while Alphonse,
in an almost authentic Quebecois
accent, tries desperately to lighten
the mood with desultory conversa
tion and malapropisms. It's disori
enting, but this makes sense los
ing a parent is just that and it's a
subtle beginning to a complex
build-up of stories.
The pair's mother, Nawal, has
stipulated in her will that her chil
dren must each perform Herculean
tasks of delivering letters to
unknown relatives in her home

country. Simon must track down
their father; Janine must track
down their older brother. Once
complete, they can engrave her
name on her tombstone and
receive an all-important last letter
from her to them, perhaps with an
explanation of why she didn't
speak a word in the five years lead
ing up to her death.
Nawal was a Canadian immi
grant from an unnamed Middle
Eastern country, and her children
have written her off as an anachro
nistic, out of touch, unloving and
crazy. As we get glimpses of her
past, we see how visceral and
immediate their mother's life was.
Her children are a stark con
trast to her. Simon is a boxer, unin
terested in family history or woes,
concerned only about the advance
ment of his own career; Janine is a
cold mathematician. The contrast
is important: it's the difference
between the luxury of the West, the
wars in the Middle East and the
difference between the new and old
generations. So we can forgive the

playwright Wajdi Mouawad for the
ridiculous mathematics talk, which
reduces Janine to someone only
capable of thinking in alienating
mathematical metaphors graph
theory is haphazardly thrown in to
little effect and is insulting to
any intellectual in the sciences with
an aptitude for social interaction.
Their mission sends them off
on a long trek trying to unravel the
mystery of who and where their
father and brother are. In the
process, they uncover their moth
er's history: her life in the war-torn
Middle East, her ascent from
poverty and despair, her revolu
tionary ideas and the horrors she
faced because of them.
It's a play about methodically
retracing steps. We watch stories
all related to their mother's
from years past unfold on stage
alongside the current journey of
our characters. Janine and Simon
retread their mother's path: visiting
relevant places and retelling her
story. We watch Simon and Janine
retread the same ground physically,
and in so doing, revise their own
notion of history and of their own
story. Director Carey Perloff's
blocking is deliberate, meticulous
and so natural that you can easily
miss all the meaning contained
therein.
The set is beautifully designed
by Scott Bradley to be an abstract
piece: evoking all kinds of emo
tions and seamlessly doubling for
contradictory places. It works just
as well as a peaceful Canadian city,
a quaint small Middle-Eastern
town and the streets of a war-torn
nation. As the play progresses, the
audience is forced to revise their
notion of what the set represents

and what it means to be in differ
ent parts of the stage. There are
obstacles across the set rocks,
trellises, etc. to help create the
illusion of trekking as the charac
ters weave between them.
The journey takes on a mythic
quality, like something out of
Greek tragedy. The pair meets a
wizened, wise old man (Apollo
Dukakis) who talks about people
with monikers like "The Woman

Who Sings." The same actor plays
Nawal's aged grandmother, whose
invaluable love and advice set the
course for her life's journey. The
children and their mother work
towards achieving catharsis, every
event taking on new meaning as
the story unravels. And we have
Alphonse, the fool and the
Westerner prattling on at intervals

"Scorched" is so rich in themes, charac
ters and plot threads that you can imagine
people dubbing the play as representative of
"life" itself. It's about the stories we tell and

the ones we can't; about family, connection
and disconnection; about the futility of war
and the impossibility of fighting it; about
love; about finding your place within the
world and between cultures that often times
clash. Wajdi Mouawad's play is ambitious
but unassuming. It's been translated from

the French "Incendies" (which was also
made into an Academy-Award-winning
film), and no meaning was lost in the
process. "Scorched" is the kind of play that

will change on you with repeat viewings
because there's so much information you
could keep unpacking thanks to the

script, the nuanced acting, the thoughtful
blocking and the wonderful set design.

and disconnection; about the futility of war
and the impossibility of fighting it; about
love; about finding your place within the
world and between cultures that often times
clash. Wajdi Mouawad's play is ambitious
but unassuming. It's been translated from

the French "Incendies" (which was also
made into an Academy-Award-winning
film), and no meaning was lost in the
process. "Scorched" is the kind of play that

will change on you with repeat viewings
because there's so much information you
could keep unpacking thanks to the

script, the nuanced acting, the thoughtful
blocking and the wonderful set design.
cc corched" creeps up on
slowly, and before
know it, you find
yourself simultaneously terrified,
engrossed, impassioned and
queasy. The play finds a jarring
start in an elaborate set that doesn't
seem to belong in any particular
place, where Simon (Babak Tafti)
and Janine (Annie Purcell) make
an uncomfortable visit to the
notary Alphonse (David
Strathairn, "Good Night and Good
Luck") to hear their mother's will.
The pair stands still for seemingly
unending minutes while Alphonse,
in an almost authentic Quebecois
accent, tries desperately to lighten
the mood with desultory conversa
tion and malapropisms. It's disori
enting, but this makes sense los
ing a parent is just that and it's a
subtle beginning to a complex
build-up of stories.
The pair's mother, Nawal, has
stipulated in her will that her chil
dren must each perform Herculean
tasks of delivering letters to
unknown relatives in her home

country. Simon must track down
their father; Janine must track
down their older brother. Once
complete, they can engrave her
name on her tombstone and
receive an all-important last letter
from her to them, perhaps with an
explanation of why she didn't
speak a word in the five years lead
ing up to her death.
Nawal was a Canadian immi
grant from an unnamed Middle
Eastern country, and her children
have written her off as an anachro
nistic, out of touch, unloving and
crazy. As we get glimpses of her
past, we see how visceral and
immediate their mother's life was.
Her children are a stark con
trast to her. Simon is a boxer, unin
terested in family history or woes,
concerned only about the advance
ment of his own career; Janine is a
cold mathematician. The contrast
is important: it's the difference
between the luxury of the West, the
wars in the Middle East and the
difference between the new and old
generations. So we can forgive the

playwright Wajdi Mouawad for the
ridiculous mathematics talk, which
reduces Janine to someone only
capable of thinking in alienating
mathematical metaphors graph
theory is haphazardly thrown in to
little effect and is insulting to
any intellectual in the sciences with
an aptitude for social interaction.
Their mission sends them off
on a long trek trying to unravel the
mystery of who and where their
father and brother are. In the
process, they uncover their moth
er's history: her life in the war-torn
Middle East, her ascent from
poverty and despair, her revolu
tionary ideas and the horrors she
faced because of them.
It's a play about methodically
retracing steps. We watch stories
all related to their mother's
from years past unfold on stage
alongside the current journey of
our characters. Janine and Simon
retread their mother's path: visiting
relevant places and retelling her
story. We watch Simon and Janine
retread the same ground physically,
and in so doing, revise their own
notion of history and of their own
story. Director Carey Perloff's
blocking is deliberate, meticulous
and so natural that you can easily
miss all the meaning contained
therein.
The set is beautifully designed
by Scott Bradley to be an abstract
piece: evoking all kinds of emo
tions and seamlessly doubling for
contradictory places. It works just
as well as a peaceful Canadian city,
a quaint small Middle-Eastern
town and the streets of a war-torn
nation. As the play progresses, the
audience is forced to revise their
notion of what the set represents

and what it means to be in differ
ent parts of the stage. There are
obstacles across the set rocks,
trellises, etc. to help create the
illusion of trekking as the charac
ters weave between them.
The journey takes on a mythic
quality, like something out of
Greek tragedy. The pair meets a
wizened, wise old man (Apollo
Dukakis) who talks about people
with monikers like "The Woman

Who Sings." The same actor plays
Nawal's aged grandmother, whose
invaluable love and advice set the
course for her life's journey. The
children and their mother work
towards achieving catharsis, every
event taking on new meaning as
the story unravels. And we have
Alphonse, the fool and the
Westerner prattling on at intervals
