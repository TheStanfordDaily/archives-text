# AWARD SEASON
## BILLY CRYSTAL RETURNS TO HOST THE 84TH ACADEMY AWARDS 
### â€“ brady HAMED contact brady: bhamed@stanford. edu 
The highlight of the film year has
officially passed. After months of
period dramas and auteur-directed,
highfalutin movies not to mention the
never-ending parade of meaningless award
shows the big one has come and gone.
This year, like always, the Academy
Awards wrapped up the year rather pre
dictably, but with a class and panache
reserved only for the Oscars.
If you tune in to the Oscars to see who
gets which award, there weren't too many

surprises. Martin Scorsese's children's
movie "Hugo" received five technical
awards while the big winner was black
and-white silent French film "The Artist." It
took home many of the biggest prizes of
the evening, including Best Picture, Best
Director for Frenchman Michel
Hazanavicius, Best Actor for the endlessly
charming lean Dujardin and two other
technical awards. With those two jugger
nauts hogging the majority of the awards,
no other film received more than two

awards.
Predictably and deservedly,
Christopher Plummer walked away with a
Best Supporting Actor statue for his por
trayal of an out-of-the-closet gay father in
the movie "Beginners," while Octavia
Spencer ended her long awards circuit with
the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for "The
Help." The only real surprise and it was
truly a surprise was Meryl Streep con
quering the favorite, Viola Davis, to win for
the Best Actress Oscar. While the public

opinion is that Meryl Streep is constantly
winning things, it just simply isn't true.
This is her first Academy Award win since
1983 for "Sophie's Choice," and she sealed
her win with one of the most graceful and
reverent speeches of the evening. However,
it is a tragic upset that the bold and bril
liant performance from Davis, one of the
finest African-American actresses working
today, went unsung.
If the awards bore you and you only
watch the Oscars for the spectacle, you
were out of luck. After attempting to man
ufacture spectacle for the past couple of
years with flat-lining hosting duos, the
Academy responded to the incendiary
comments of Brett Ratner with the safest,
most conservative show they could put on.
Cue Billy Crystal.
It was certainly a welcome sight to see
him back on stage with light one-liners,
and he treated us to his famous videos of
inserting himself into the Best Picture
nominated films. However, that's where the
fun really ended. The only moments really
worth You Tubing were Jim Rash's mockery
of Angelina Jolie's infamous right leg and a
few of the more touching acceptance
speeches from Spencer, Plummer, Streep
and Asghar Farhadi, the director of the
Iranian Best Foreign Language Winner "A
Separation." Besides that, the ceremony was
a classy event that was certainly an
improvement over previous failures.
But at least a failure is fun to watch
this year was just simple and safe.
