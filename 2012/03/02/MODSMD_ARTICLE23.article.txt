Anyone who has ever been in a rela
tionship or anyone ill-fated
enough to have friends in relation
ships —knows first-hand how much a
breakup can rock even the tightest-knit friend
groups. Part true-facts, part satire and part
courtroom drama, "The Ex-Trials" an origi
nal play written and produced by Savannah
Kopp' 14 and directed by Laura Petree' 15,
seeks to illustrate just that. Complete with
gavel-wielding kidnaps, Watergate-tier recon
naissance and flirtation recapitulations, "The
Ex-Trials" captures with accuracy and come
dy of a group of five friends dealing with the
aftershock of a nasty breakup.
After Jack and Erika—the couple for
merly known as Jerika —part ways for
ambiguous reasons, their three theatrical
friends take them hostage and set them on

trial. Hilarity ensues when the judge, jury and
defendants take on revolving roles, casting
blame and veiling bias in what becomes the
O.J. trial of friendship, taking us back to the
high school days of shenanigans and imma
turity — oh wait, those are our college days,
too. The five recount stories of failed flirta
tions, dubious fidelity and a custody agree
ment for a shared treasure while offering
social commentary on those 'compromises'
we think we make for our partners, and the
sacrifices they make for us.
In the lead male role, James Seifert 'l5
meets the expectations he has set in other
Stanford roles, namely as Leland Stanford
Junior in this year's "Gaieties" and in "Playing
Co-Op," both Ram's Head productions. As in
those roles, Seifert exhibits a skilled dorkiness,
but ups the ante with slides of rage and diffi

dence in "Trials" A more dynamic role than
his previous parts, Seifert demonstrates a
multi-faceted capacity hopefully to be har
vested in his next three years at Stanford.
Nora Tjossem 'l5 plays the female half
of Jerika with all the vindictiveness and acer
bity reserved for the scorned teenage female.
Though not quite the typical teenage girl
friend absorbed with 160-plus character text
messages or obsessing over her boyfriend,
Erika lists flirting, bossiness and aloofness as
her vices. Tjossem plays her to a biting tee.
But it's the energy of Austin Caldwell' 15
who will have the audience in stitches. His
brewing supply of energy surfaces, explodes,
and then re-charges for the next right
moment Caldwell's performance is an awe-

inspiring feat, combining many cari
catures into one character, which
bears an effusive energy that flutters
off the stage and will have the audi
ence laughing.
"The Ex-Trials" wraps up with
two plot twists worthy of "The
Usual Suspects" that will have the
audience laughing at just how
absurd real life relationships are. The
jealousy, vengeance, lusting and
rejection that doom the breakups of
our own lives become a hilarious
pastiche in this Stanford original.
"The Ex-Trials" is funded by a
Spark! grant from the Stanford
Institute for Creativity and the Arts.
The play will run in Roble Theatre
at 7p.m. on Friday, March 2, and 2
p.m. and 7p.m. on Saturday,
March 3.
