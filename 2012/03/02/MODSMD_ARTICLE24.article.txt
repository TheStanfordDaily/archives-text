## holla for CHALLAH 
### â€“ rachel ZARROW contact rachel: rjzarrow@stanford. edu 
Growing up in a Jewish household,
challah was about as standard a sta
ple in my family's kitchen as butter
is in anyone else's. My parents would pur
chase a large challah on Friday afternoon
that we would eat with dinner on Friday
night as well as for breakfast on the week
ends. Upon arriving at college, however, I
learned that not everyone had experienced
the joys of challah. What was an ordinary
part of my diet was foreign and mysterious
to many of my classmates.
Challah, the traditional Jewish bread
eaten on the Sabbath, is a fluffy, braided loaf
made with an extraordinary number of eggs,
as well as other typical ingredients flour,
water, yeast and sugar. It is commonly pre
pared with an egg wash on top and is often
sprinkled with sesame seeds or poppy seeds
for added flavor. A traditional Jewish meal
commences with a blessing over this bread,
and after one taste, it's easy to understand
why it deserves such special attention.
At Stanford, I found a clear solution to

my classmates' lack of exposure to this par
ticular delicacy: Challah for Hunger.
Challah for Hunger is an international
organization in which college students bake

and sell challah,
donating 100 percent
of the proceeds to

hunger and disaster relief

organizations. Stanford's
chapter is part of the

Jewish Student Association

and works with other groups, including
Greek life, social action groups and interfaith
groups.
Given my years of experience with chal
lah consumption and enjoyment, I recom-

mend eating it plain or toasted, and you can
even use it to make dense bread pudding or
French toast. Stanford's Challah for Hunger
makes the traditional flavors plain, poppy
seed and sesame as well as some wildly
creative options like cinnamon raisin, choco
late chip and sundried tomato garlic. They
also branch out seasonally, making pump
kin, pumpkin chocolate chip, cinnamon,
olive rosemary and craisin chocolate chip.
While I like the traditional flavors, the
chocolate chip and the pumpkin chocolate
chip are absolutely divine eaten warm out of
the oven or even microwaved. There is noth
ing better than freshly baked bread, except
for freshly baked bread that is studded with
melting chocolate chips.
Stanford's challah is made by volunteers
weekly; everyone is welcome to participate in
baking and selling the challah on Thursday
nights at Hillel. To pre-order a loaf, go to
stanford.edu/group/jewishstudents and any
questions can be sent to
rhecht@stanford.edu.
So whether you are a veteran challah
lover or just a hungry freshman, I highly rec
ommend ordering a loaf of this "heavenly"
treat.
