San Francisco has a solid indie
pop band in Geographer,
but there's still something
disappointing about the group.
Vocalist/guitarist/synth player
Michael Deni, cellist Nathan Blaz
and drummer Brian Osteicher are
good musicians, and their new
album "Myth" sits comfortably
amongst other indie-synth pop
releases from the likes of Hot Chip
and Phantogram. It would be a lie
to call them groundbreaking
but evidently, this is not a problem

for either the band or the music
world.
Ever since Peter Gabriel and
Annie Lennox started experiment
ing with synthesizers, Geographer
(or bands just like them) has been
churning out rhythmic electronica,
inspired and impelled by their
musical context. And while it
would be wrong to judge bands
merely for taking inspiration from
obvious musical paragons (despite
how tempting it is), is there any
value in having three hundred ver

sions of the same song written,
recorded and performed by 300
bands with the same musical con
sciousness?
That's not to say that
Geographer has no charm. Nathan
Blaz's cello adds an interesting
touch to the synth-infused pop the
band delivers in this their sopho
more effort. "Life of Crime" would
not be the star opener that it is
without the twisting cello line in
the background. And while
Michael Deni's falsetto sounds at

times exactly like Alexis Taylor
from Hot Chip, the more original
songs have him slurring and hic
cupping his way through would-be
'Bos hits.

The issue is not that
Geographer is unpleasant, but their
"charm" is a quality other bands
