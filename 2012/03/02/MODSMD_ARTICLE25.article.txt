San Francisco has a solid indie
pop band in Geographer,
but there's still something
disappointing about the group.
Vocalist/guitarist/synth player
Michael Deni, cellist Nathan Blaz
and drummer Brian Osteicher are
good musicians, and their new
album "Myth" sits comfortably
amongst other indie-synth pop
releases from the likes of Hot Chip
and Phantogram. It would be a lie
to call them groundbreaking
but evidently, this is not a problem

for either the band or the music
world.
Ever since Peter Gabriel and
Annie Lennox started experiment
ing with synthesizers, Geographer
(or bands just like them) has been
churning out rhythmic electronica,
inspired and impelled by their
musical context. And while it
would be wrong to judge bands
merely for taking inspiration from
obvious musical paragons (despite
how tempting it is), is there any
value in having three hundred ver

sions of the same song written,
recorded and performed by 300
bands with the same musical con
sciousness?
That's not to say that
Geographer has no charm. Nathan
Blaz's cello adds an interesting
touch to the synth-infused pop the
band delivers in this their sopho
more effort. "Life of Crime" would
not be the star opener that it is
without the twisting cello line in
the background. And while
Michael Deni's falsetto sounds at

times exactly like Alexis Taylor
from Hot Chip, the more original
songs have him slurring and hic
cupping his way through would-be
'Bos hits.

The issue is not that
Geographer is unpleasant, but their
"charm" is a quality other bands

have already capitalized on (Ra Ra Riot any
one?), and it can no longer ascribe individu
ality on any band.
"Myth" is a collection of standard,
shimmery indie pop tracks one would
expect from its genre, but that's not to say it
is completely devoid of gems. One of
Geographer's strong suits is taking inspira
tion from the past without translating it too
literally: "Kaleidoscope" has an odd, rever

berating background vocal line that echoes
throughout the song, lending it a brassy 'Bos
feel, while "Blinders" has an interesting solo
on keyboards that sounds like a Hammond
organ, a throwback to '7os classic rock. The
best one-word description of "Lover's
Game" is retro: incredibly catchy, with a
great hook in its staccato chorus and croon
ing reminiscent of a sixties boy band, the
track is all sugar. The only issue is that it

lacks soul.
I am a big believer in last tracks repre
senting a band's sound, and "Kites" does
credit to my conviction. It does not sound
like a throwback to another time it's cur
rent, the synths are tight and controlled and
the cello softens the atmosphere while com
plementing the drawn-out chorus line. It's a
good track, but that's not to say it isn't para
digmatic: it is. I'm not saying we should

expect every single indie band to reinvent the
wheel, because most of the time, the wheel
works just fine. The question to ask is: how
many "Kites" do we want, and will we ever
be satisfied with just one?
