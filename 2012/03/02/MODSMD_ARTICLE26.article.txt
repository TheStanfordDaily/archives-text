-w- -w-ave you ever wanted to see

I I the world, but you just

-L -Leant find the time

to do so? Maybe you didn't

get a chance to study

abroad this year, or money is

tight. Fear no more! Map Crunch will
drop you off anywhere in the world, and
it's your job to find your way around.
The trick is, you don't know where you've
been dropped ofif (unless you want to, of
course).
The website is kind of like the
stereotypical college student experience
of backpacking around Europe, except
you don't actually go to Europe or go
backpacking, and all you really get to see
are the streets that Google has charted
with its Street View option. Beware: when
I first tried the site out, the web traffic
was far too much for the Map Crunch
servers to handle and the site crashed.
This issue has since been fixed, and there
is even a little "We <3 Tumblr" tag that
pops up as the map loads, a nod to the
blogging service that is largely responsible
for their popularity.
Elsewhere, you can get your travel
kick from the Find the Airport game,
which has cropped up on sites such as

Tumblr

and Reddit in the last few weeks, taking
the Internet by storm. It has also seriously
frustrated a lot of lost "tourists" who are
getting tired of being dropped into a field
of sheep out in the middle of Ireland.
The game is played by navigating
yourself to the nearest airport without
referring to any outside sources. If you
want, you can narrow down the options
of where you are dropped, but your
placement will still be random.
Obviously, since the point of this website
is to explore places around the world that
you might not have previously not con
sidered searching on Google Maps, you'll
see some pretty interesting stuff.
You'll definitely become acquainted
with the various roads of the world (odds
are, they will be profoundly vacant roads
through some of the most beautiful land
scapes on Earth), and you might wish
you had taken a different route, but then
you'll see the random person who knew

that Google was coming around
to take photos of their street and decid
ed to dress up for them. Sometimes
these individuals are terrifying (mass
gatherings of people who look to be
doing highly questionable activities)
and sometimes they're downright
bizarre (several people trying to walk
their cats, teenagers doing stupid things
and, of course, a guy in a Big Bird cos
tume).
Procrastination and potential frus
tration aside, Map Crunch and Find the
Airport show how much there is to
explore of the world, regardless of
whether the location of the nearest air
port is known. If you ever find yourself
with a few minutes to spare, need a study
break or have a burning desire to see just
how many open pastures there are in the
world, why not spend some time getting
lost in a far-away part of the world?
