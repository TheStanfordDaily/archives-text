## ROXY SASS THE 						WORST STANFORD SCOPE-OUTS 
### 
Last week, Roxy divulged
some of her best places to
meet potential hook-ups
(Roxy has never been very good
at keeping secrets). Ever a woman
of extremes, this week, Roxy's
decided to share the worst places
to meet people on campus.
The Co Ho
Roxy may be something of a ho,
but even she doesn't make moves
at Stanford's central coffee house.
Why, you might ask, should the
CoHo only be a place to get your
caffeine fix and nothing else? Two
words: CoHo smell.
Vaden
If you hook up with someone
you met in the Vaden waiting
room, you're bound to swap
more than spit during your
make-out sesh. Unless you're
already monogamous, Roxy
believes no one's worth getting
mono for.
SLE
While Roxy's got a thing for
nerds, even she doesn't sleep with
the Sle-ople. The only thing
worse would be FroSoCo (where,
ironically enough, Roxy never
gets her O).
Special Dinner
Roxy's experienced many a
Special D in her day, but she tries
to avoid stealing other people's
dates. (Even Roxy has a moral

compass it just usually points
to the bedroom.)
Green Library Cubicles
Believe it or not, even Roxy gets
her study (and keeps her clothes)
on once in a while. And Roxy
knows the dangers of multitask
ing: when she's hard at work at
Green, she can't be focusing on
getting anything else hard.
And of course, if you're a creepy
grad student (if you're not sure of
the answer, it's probably yes),
pretty much anywhere is a bad
choice. It's probably for the best
to stay in that ivory tower.
Know any grad students who aren't
creepy? Roxy may be an under
grad, but she's really good on top.
