## PA, Stanford merge dispatches 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Palo Alto, Los Altos, Moun
tain View and Stanford will spend
$2.7 million within the next year
to consolidate their police dis
patch services, according to Palo
Alto Police Department Techni
cal Services Director Charles
Cullen. Palo Alto City Council
estimates Stanford will con
tribute roughly $224,000 to the
project.
"We're doing a virtual consol
idation, which is a little different
from a brick-and-mortar consoli
dation, for both economic and
operational reasons," said Moun
tain View Police Chief Scott Ver
meer. "From an economic stand
point, we're able to buy one sys
tem instead of having the three
cities buy multiple systems. Oper

ationally, it allows us all to be
working on the same system,
which provides opportunities for
much smoother assistance of
each other in sharing informa
tion."
Los Altos Police Department
Services Manager Elizabeth Var
gas specified that the unification
will allow each city access to high
er-quality technology.
"The three agencies together
can purchase a much higher level
system than they could purchase
on their own," Vargas said. "We
can purchase a more robust sys
tem when we combine."
Vargas wrote in a separate
email to The Daily that there
have been instances where coor
dinated dispatch would have
been helpful in the past.
"Typically when a crime oc
curs on a border of any of the

three cities, the city handling the
situation needs to either make a
phone call or send a Teletype to
that neighboring jurisdiction to
inform them of the activity," Var
gas said. "With the new system,
cities will be able to monitor this
activity in real time."
The city of Palo Alto ap
proved a plan for the dispatch
unification at a city council meet
ing on Feb. 21. Palo Alto was the
last of the three cities to author
ize the purchase.
According to Cullen, Santa
Clara County decided how much
each city will be expected to con
tribute to the unification plan by
following a method the city has
used for past county projects.
Half of the cost will be split
equally between the three cities,
