## PA, Stanford merge dispatches 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Palo Alto, Los Altos, Moun
tain View and Stanford will spend
$2.7 million within the next year
to consolidate their police dis
patch services, according to Palo
Alto Police Department Techni
cal Services Director Charles
Cullen. Palo Alto City Council
estimates Stanford will con
tribute roughly $224,000 to the
project.
"We're doing a virtual consol
idation, which is a little different
from a brick-and-mortar consoli
dation, for both economic and
operational reasons," said Moun
tain View Police Chief Scott Ver
meer. "From an economic stand
point, we're able to buy one sys
tem instead of having the three
cities buy multiple systems. Oper

ationally, it allows us all to be
working on the same system,
which provides opportunities for
much smoother assistance of
each other in sharing informa
tion."
Los Altos Police Department
Services Manager Elizabeth Var
gas specified that the unification
will allow each city access to high
er-quality technology.
"The three agencies together
can purchase a much higher level
system than they could purchase
on their own," Vargas said. "We
can purchase a more robust sys
tem when we combine."
Vargas wrote in a separate
email to The Daily that there
have been instances where coor
dinated dispatch would have
been helpful in the past.
"Typically when a crime oc
curs on a border of any of the

three cities, the city handling the
situation needs to either make a
phone call or send a Teletype to
that neighboring jurisdiction to
inform them of the activity," Var
gas said. "With the new system,
cities will be able to monitor this
activity in real time."
The city of Palo Alto ap
proved a plan for the dispatch
unification at a city council meet
ing on Feb. 21. Palo Alto was the
last of the three cities to author
ize the purchase.
According to Cullen, Santa
Clara County decided how much
each city will be expected to con
tribute to the unification plan by
following a method the city has
used for past county projects.
Half of the cost will be split
equally between the three cities,
and the other half will be based on
population. In both cases, Stan
ford is included in the Palo Alto
portion.
Stanford currently accounts
for approximately 25 percent of
Palo Alto's use of dispatch servic
es, and the University pays for ap
proximately 16 percent of the per
sonnel and 25 percent of the capi
tal costs, Cullen said.
According to Cullen, the con
solidation has three levels or
steps: computerized dispatch,
pubic safety application and com
bining the three 911 systems. The
central piece of the unification is
the computerized dispatch sys

tem.
The purchase agreement for
the unification is currently being
finalized, Vermeer said.
"We are then going to get in the
process of more of a planning,
training and implementation
stage," Vermeer said. "The general
thought is that we plan to go live in
fall 2012."
The implementation process
may take up to a year before the
new system goes live, according to
Vargas.
Administrative work, software
installation and training will take
up the bulk of this time period as
dispatchers and police and fire of
ficers in the field will have to learn
the new system, according to Ver
meer.
"There will be work involved
in changing the process of how we
do things now and adjusting be

cause of the sharing of the sys
tem," Vermeer said.
This last step will include estab
lishing a radio frequency allowing
officers from all three cities and
the Stanford campus to talk to one
other. The departments have al
ready received grant funding for
this radio frequency and are cur
rently working on its develop
ment. The state will fund work on
the 911 system later this year.
The consolidation is expected
to be particularly helpful with fire
department services and automat
ic-vehicle-location (AVL) capa
bilities.
Each department will be able
to see the location of all police and
fire vehicles in the three cities and
on the Stanford campus. This im
provement will allow one city's
department, for example, Palo
Alto's, to request assistance from

either the Los Altos or Mountain
View department if their officers
are closer to the scene of an emer
gency.
"If we need a specialized type
of unit, say a canine or a Spanish
speaking officer, we would be able
to identify that quickly and send it
to the area," Cullen said. "For fire,
it's going to give us the opportuni
ty to do more boundary drop and
auto aid so we are not duplicating
resources."
Cullen also said that the unifi
cation is expected to cut costs for
the three cities in the long run, and
if there were an emergency that
made one of the centers uninhab
itable, those dispatchers would be
able to go to one of the other two
centers and take 911 calls for their
city.
"It's going to be a much better
system for all the participating

agencies and Stanford," Cullen
said. "Stanford is an equal partner.
They have our mobile application
in their vehicles, and they will have
enhanced capabilities once the
new systems are in place."
Currently, the Stanford Uni
versity Department of Public
Safety has a separate records
management system from the
Palo Alto Police Department, and
this may be a possible area of fu
ture unification if the University is
so inclined, Cullen said.
"The unification is a regional
effort, and it's fairly unique,"
Cullen said. "We're using technol
ogy to work together and realize a
lot of the efficiencies of consolida
tion without the upfront costs of a
physical consolidation."
