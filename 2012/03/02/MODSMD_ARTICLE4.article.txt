## Storify CEO talks to 'hacks' and 'hackers' 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
"Social media has more
eyewitnesses than ever,
recording the voices of people
on the ground," said Storify
CEO and co-founder Burt
Herman, a former Daily editor
in chief, to an audience in Mc-
Clatchy Hall yesterday after
noon. "There is so much amaz
ing source material out there
that we can't just passively
look at what people are saying,
but we have to drive through
social media and see what peo
ple think."
As part of Entrepreneur
ship Week at Stanford, the
Graduate Program in Journal
ism hosted "Hacks and Hack

ers" Thursday afternoon to
bridge the gap between jour
nalists, the "hacks," and com
puter scientists, the "hackers."
The program invited Herman
a Knight Fellow at Stanford
during the 2008-09 academic
year, a former correspondent
for the Associated Press and
co-founder of international
grassroots journalism organi
zation Hacks/Hackers to
talk about his experiences with
journalism.
Following Herman's pres
entation, the event featured an
exercise with the audience to
brainstorm solutions to simpli
fy the morning news experi
ence for consumers.


KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY/The Stanford Daily
Burt Herman, CEO and co-founder of Storify and co-founder of
Hacks/Hackers, spoke to journalists, "hacks," and technologists
"hackers," Thursday afternoon about bridging the two groups.
Herman began the event dis
cussing the conditions that led to
the founding of Storify, which he
said is meant to "bring together
social media, make it more read
able and curate it."
While working for the Associ
ated Press, Herman said he no
ticed how social media was be
coming more and more impor
tant.
"We had 3,000 staff, but there's
no way they could have someone
everywhere," Herman said. "Now
everyone with a smartphone is es
sentially your supporting staff.
What this means is that those peo
ple are more important than ever,
and instead of running around try
ing to catch events, journalists can
just find information in social
media. Storify is away for journal
ists to do that."
Storify's main goal is to make
social media more aesthetic and
understandable, Herman said,

mentioning the appeal of Twitter
in particular.
"There's really compelling
stuff there, and my question was,
'How do you bring that to a larger
audience?'" Herman said.
Herman described all the in
formation in social media as one
continuous "real-time stream"
and called print newspapers "old
media." He said that now, as jour
nalists are struggling to figure out
what to do online in addition to
publishing articles, the challenge
on the Internet is to figure out how
to organize all the information that
is out there.
Mission and passion drive jour
nalists and technologists, he said.
They exist for the public, be it to
write an article that everyone
reads, or to make a mobile app that
everyone uses. Both care about
freedom of information and trans
parency and "do what it takes to
get the job done."
However, Herman said, there are
some challenges based on the dif
ferent thinking styles of the two
groups.
"Journalists try to simplify
ideas and put in away the general

audience can understand, but tech
nologists get more excited the
more complex challenges are,"
Herman said. "Journalists want to
make sure that everything is per
fect after editing and after the
article is done, there are no more
changes to it. But technologists
have to debug and change their
software according to how their
audience reacts to it."
Herman also mentioned that
journalists and technologists think
of competition and collaboration
differently and that their styles of
work contrast with one another.
Herman used the analogy "ink
is to newspaper as code is to web"
to explain the bridge that he said
journalists and technologists need
to build together.
"Just as much as journalists are
realizing that they need technolo
gists to publish their work online,
technologists are realizing that
they need journalists to sift
through all the information and
see what is relevant," Herman
said.
Herman then discussed his ex
perience with Hacks/Hackers.
According to Herman, there

are currently more than 9,000
members of Hack/Hackers meet
up groups, which host talks and
hackathons, among other events.
These groups are in cities all across
the United States, including San
Francisco, New York and Boston.
They have also spread to five
countries outside the United
States.
Ann Grimes, director of the
Graduate Program in Journalism,
said she had been to one of the
workshops held in San Francisco.
"It's really amazing how much
curiosity there is on the part of the
technologists on what we hacks are

all about," Grimes said. "We're
bringing these groups, which are
usually operating in their own silos,
together. After all, you have to
know what can be done online in
order to be able to be published on
line."
Herman concluded his presen
tation by commenting on the
largest differences between Storify
and traditional journalism.
"As opposed to quoting experts,
instead we are using the audience
as away to create the story."

technologists on what we hacks are

all about," Grimes said. "We're
bringing these groups, which are
usually operating in their own silos,
together. After all, you have to
know what can be done online in
order to be able to be published on
line."
Herman concluded his presen
tation by commenting on the
largest differences between Storify
and traditional journalism.
"As opposed to quoting experts,
instead we are using the audience
as away to create the story."

"Social media has more
eyewitnesses than ever,
recording the voices of people
on the ground," said Storify
CEO and co-founder Burt
Herman, a former Daily editor
in chief, to an audience in Mc-
Clatchy Hall yesterday after
noon. "There is so much amaz
ing source material out there
that we can't just passively
look at what people are saying,
but we have to drive through
social media and see what peo
ple think."
As part of Entrepreneur
ship Week at Stanford, the
Graduate Program in Journal
ism hosted "Hacks and Hack

ers" Thursday afternoon to
bridge the gap between jour
nalists, the "hacks," and com
puter scientists, the "hackers."
The program invited Herman
a Knight Fellow at Stanford
during the 2008-09 academic
year, a former correspondent
for the Associated Press and
co-founder of international
grassroots journalism organi
zation Hacks/Hackers to
talk about his experiences with
journalism.
Following Herman's pres
entation, the event featured an
exercise with the audience to
brainstorm solutions to simpli
fy the morning news experi
ence for consumers.

Burt Herman, CEO and co-founder of Storify and co-founder of
Hacks/Hackers, spoke to journalists, "hacks," and technologists
"hackers," Thursday afternoon about bridging the two groups.
Herman began the event dis
cussing the conditions that led to
the founding of Storify, which he
said is meant to "bring together
social media, make it more read
able and curate it."
While working for the Associ
ated Press, Herman said he no
ticed how social media was be
coming more and more impor
tant.
"We had 3,000 staff, but there's
no way they could have someone
everywhere," Herman said. "Now
everyone with a smartphone is es
sentially your supporting staff.
What this means is that those peo
ple are more important than ever,
and instead of running around try
ing to catch events, journalists can
just find information in social
media. Storify is away for journal
ists to do that."
Storify's main goal is to make
social media more aesthetic and
understandable, Herman said,

mentioning the appeal of Twitter
in particular.
"There's really compelling
stuff there, and my question was,
'How do you bring that to a larger
audience?'" Herman said.
Herman described all the in
formation in social media as one
continuous "real-time stream"
and called print newspapers "old
media." He said that now, as jour
nalists are struggling to figure out
what to do online in addition to
publishing articles, the challenge
on the Internet is to figure out how
to organize all the information that
is out there.
Mission and passion drive jour
nalists and technologists, he said.
They exist for the public, be it to
write an article that everyone
reads, or to make a mobile app that
everyone uses. Both care about
freedom of information and trans
parency and "do what it takes to
get the job done."
However, Herman said, there are
some challenges based on the dif
ferent thinking styles of the two
groups.
"Journalists try to simplify
ideas and put in away the general

audience can understand, but tech
nologists get more excited the
more complex challenges are,"
Herman said. "Journalists want to
make sure that everything is per
fect after editing and after the
article is done, there are no more
changes to it. But technologists
have to debug and change their
software according to how their
audience reacts to it."
Herman also mentioned that
journalists and technologists think
of competition and collaboration
differently and that their styles of
work contrast with one another.
Herman used the analogy "ink
is to newspaper as code is to web"
to explain the bridge that he said
journalists and technologists need
to build together.
"Just as much as journalists are
realizing that they need technolo
gists to publish their work online,
technologists are realizing that
they need journalists to sift
through all the information and
see what is relevant," Herman
said.
Herman then discussed his ex
perience with Hacks/Hackers.
According to Herman, there

are currently more than 9,000
members of Hack/Hackers meet
up groups, which host talks and
hackathons, among other events.
These groups are in cities all across
the United States, including San
Francisco, New York and Boston.
They have also spread to five
countries outside the United
States.
Ann Grimes, director of the
Graduate Program in Journalism,
said she had been to one of the
workshops held in San Francisco.
"It's really amazing how much
curiosity there is on the part of the
technologists on what we hacks are

all about," Grimes said. "We're
bringing these groups, which are
usually operating in their own silos,
