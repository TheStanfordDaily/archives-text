### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
"Social media has more
eyewitnesses than ever,
recording the voices of people
on the ground," said Storify
CEO and co-founder Burt
Herman, a former Daily editor
in chief, to an audience in Mc-
Clatchy Hall yesterday after
noon. "There is so much amaz
ing source material out there
that we can't just passively
look at what people are saying,
but we have to drive through
social media and see what peo
ple think."
As part of Entrepreneur
ship Week at Stanford, the
Graduate Program in Journal
ism hosted "Hacks and Hack

ers" Thursday afternoon to
bridge the gap between jour
nalists, the "hacks," and com
puter scientists, the "hackers."
The program invited Herman
a Knight Fellow at Stanford
during the 2008-09 academic
year, a former correspondent
for the Associated Press and
co-founder of international
grassroots journalism organi
zation Hacks/Hackers to
talk about his experiences with
journalism.
Following Herman's pres
entation, the event featured an
exercise with the audience to
brainstorm solutions to simpli
fy the morning news experi
