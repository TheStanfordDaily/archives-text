## Clergy chat on religion, politics 
### CHRISTINA WANG 
Christian faith and the complicat
ed overlaps between religion and pol
itics highlighted a talk by Dean of Re
ligious Life Reverend Scotty McLen
nan and Ron Sanders, a member of
the Stanford Association of Religions
Executive Committee, Thursday af
ternoon. The event, "Looking at the
Christian Faith and Politics in the 21st
Century," was part of a regular series
of lunch panels and talks hosted by
Stanford in Government (SIG).
McLennan and Sanders began
their discussion by sharing their per
spectives on Christianity, how they
think the general public perceives it
and the role of religion in politics
today.
McLennan said he wished to clar
ify three commonly misunderstood
aspects of Christianity. First, he said,
the Scripture was not written by God,
but a reflection of mankind's quest
for the divine; second, McLennan
said, no personal conversion experi
ence is necessary for someone to be
come a Christian; and finally, he con
cluded, Jesus was someone who was
"not God, but a great historical
teacher," and McLennan's "Lord and
Savior."
McLennan then read a verse from
Isaiah, in which Jesus proclaims that
the "spirit of the Lord is upon me ...
he tells me to bring peace to the
poor."
McLennan told the audience to
take away the notion that Jesus was
"very social justice-oriented, very
open to people of other religions
and traditions and very open to
marginalized peoples."
McLennan then added that
Jesus was a "promoter of the free
exercise of religion," and a "de
fender of people of all back
grounds."
When applying this introduc
tion of Jesus and Christianity to
politics, McLennan said that reli
gion should be involved in politics,
citing the "Mother Teresas,
Desmond Tutus, Martin Luther
Kings" in history as the prophets
who had carried out Christian
ideals and had been instigators of
political change.
He added that Christians
should beware of using religion as
a trump card.
"Never make a political argu
ment that ends with 'I think this be
cause I'm a Christian,"' he said.
"Instead, people of all faiths should
learn to speak in a common civic
language."
Sanders then spoke about his
experiences with evangelism.
What he has found through his
interactions with his audiences,
Sanders said, is that "Jesus general
ly receives a neutral or positive re
action from most people, while
Christianity as a religion mostly re
ceives negative sentiment."
Offering his explanation for this

perception, Sanders said that when
the values of the secular and the re
ligious clash, evangelicals are in
clined toward debating heatedly
against their "earthly government."
And as a result, Sanders added,
"We're not quite at home ... we're
exiles, we're aliens."
Sanders said that evangelicals
know that they are asked to pray
for peace for people of all back
grounds and faiths. This fact is not
always conveyed to the public,
however, he said.
Halfway through the lunch,
McLennan and Sanders opened
the discussion up to questions. Stu
dents asked about contemporary
social issues, such as the death
penalty.
Both Sanders and McLennan
said that they oppose the death
penalty, believing that Jesus
"preached forgiveness" and asked
his followers not to "return evil for
evil."
Their response led to a follow
up question whether they
viewed Jesus as a pacific figure.
Sanders said he believes Jesus'
greatest commandment of "loving
the Lord your God with all your
heart" and "loving your neighbor."
"Loving your neighbor,"
Sanders said, "means that you do
not fight him."
Sanders said that Jesus was not
entirely pacific, however, and
traced back to the Roman Em
pire's adoption of the "just war the
ory," arguing that there can be cir
cumstances when one nation has to
fight a just war.
The Iraq War, Sanders said, was
not one of those just wars. He also
argued that there is a wide gap be

tween just war theory and paci
fism, but that the Christian ideals in
just war theory are slowly surfacing
in international laws concerning
justice and humanitarian protec
tion.
Another student asked how the
speakers respond to people who
see faith and reason as completely
separate entities.
McLennan acknowledged that
it is very possible for religion to
"end a conversation" because one
party does not consider that faith
could be part of anyone's reason
ing.
"There are conversation enders
in completely secular conversa
tions, too," he said, adding that faith
is not the sole reason why produc
tive conversations may end.
McLennan said he acknowl
edges that the institution of reli
gion has alienated many, but that
the prospects and ideals grounded
in Christian ideology are prevalent
enough that productive conversa
tion can easily occur between peo
ple of all faiths and ideologies on
campus.
"I heard McLennan and
Sanders speak in SLE this year and
thought it was interesting how they
were talking about their different
perspectives on religion in a ration
al and reasoned way," said Adri
enne von Schulthess 'l5, a member
of the SIG Campus Awareness
committee that organized the
event and a Daily reporter. "I
thought it would be great if I could
open that up to the rest of the com
munity."

thought it was interesting how they
were talking about their different
perspectives on religion in a ration

committee that organized the
event and a Daily reporter. "I

Christian faith and the complicat
ed overlaps between religion and pol
itics highlighted a talk by Dean of Re
ligious Life Reverend Scotty McLen
nan and Ron Sanders, a member of
the Stanford Association of Religions
Executive Committee, Thursday af
ternoon. The event, "Looking at the
Christian Faith and Politics in the 21st
Century," was part of a regular series
of lunch panels and talks hosted by
Stanford in Government (SIG).
McLennan and Sanders began
their discussion by sharing their per
spectives on Christianity, how they
think the general public perceives it
and the role of religion in politics
today.
McLennan said he wished to clar
ify three commonly misunderstood
aspects of Christianity. First, he said,
the Scripture was not written by God,
but a reflection of mankind's quest
for the divine; second, McLennan
said, no personal conversion experi
ence is necessary for someone to be
come a Christian; and finally, he con
cluded, Jesus was someone who was
"not God, but a great historical
teacher," and McLennan's "Lord and
Savior."
McLennan then read a verse from
Isaiah, in which Jesus proclaims that
the "spirit of the Lord is upon me ...
he tells me to bring peace to the
poor."
McLennan told the audience to
take away the notion that Jesus was
"very social justice-oriented, very
open to people of other religions
and traditions and very open to
marginalized peoples."
McLennan then added that
Jesus was a "promoter of the free
exercise of religion," and a "de
fender of people of all back
grounds."
When applying this introduc
tion of Jesus and Christianity to
politics, McLennan said that reli
gion should be involved in politics,
citing the "Mother Teresas,
Desmond Tutus, Martin Luther
Kings" in history as the prophets
who had carried out Christian
ideals and had been instigators of
political change.
He added that Christians
should beware of using religion as
a trump card.
"Never make a political argu
ment that ends with 'I think this be
cause I'm a Christian,"' he said.
"Instead, people of all faiths should
learn to speak in a common civic
language."
Sanders then spoke about his
experiences with evangelism.
What he has found through his
interactions with his audiences,
Sanders said, is that "Jesus general
ly receives a neutral or positive re
action from most people, while
Christianity as a religion mostly re
ceives negative sentiment."
Offering his explanation for this

perception, Sanders said that when
the values of the secular and the re
ligious clash, evangelicals are in
clined toward debating heatedly
against their "earthly government."
And as a result, Sanders added,
"We're not quite at home ... we're
exiles, we're aliens."
Sanders said that evangelicals
know that they are asked to pray
for peace for people of all back
grounds and faiths. This fact is not
always conveyed to the public,
however, he said.
Halfway through the lunch,
McLennan and Sanders opened
the discussion up to questions. Stu
dents asked about contemporary
social issues, such as the death
penalty.
Both Sanders and McLennan
said that they oppose the death
penalty, believing that Jesus
"preached forgiveness" and asked
his followers not to "return evil for
evil."
Their response led to a follow
up question whether they
viewed Jesus as a pacific figure.
Sanders said he believes Jesus'
greatest commandment of "loving
the Lord your God with all your
heart" and "loving your neighbor."
"Loving your neighbor,"
Sanders said, "means that you do
not fight him."
Sanders said that Jesus was not
entirely pacific, however, and
traced back to the Roman Em
pire's adoption of the "just war the
ory," arguing that there can be cir
cumstances when one nation has to
fight a just war.
The Iraq War, Sanders said, was
not one of those just wars. He also
argued that there is a wide gap be

tween just war theory and paci
fism, but that the Christian ideals in
just war theory are slowly surfacing
in international laws concerning
justice and humanitarian protec
tion.
Another student asked how the
speakers respond to people who
see faith and reason as completely
separate entities.
McLennan acknowledged that
it is very possible for religion to
"end a conversation" because one
party does not consider that faith
could be part of anyone's reason
ing.
"There are conversation enders
in completely secular conversa
tions, too," he said, adding that faith
is not the sole reason why produc
tive conversations may end.
McLennan said he acknowl
edges that the institution of reli
gion has alienated many, but that
the prospects and ideals grounded
in Christian ideology are prevalent
enough that productive conversa
tion can easily occur between peo
ple of all faiths and ideologies on
