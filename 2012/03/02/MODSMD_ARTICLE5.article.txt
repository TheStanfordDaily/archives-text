## Clergy chat on religion, politics 
### CHRISTINA WANG 
Christian faith and the complicat
ed overlaps between religion and pol
itics highlighted a talk by Dean of Re
ligious Life Reverend Scotty McLen
nan and Ron Sanders, a member of
the Stanford Association of Religions
Executive Committee, Thursday af
ternoon. The event, "Looking at the
Christian Faith and Politics in the 21st
Century," was part of a regular series
of lunch panels and talks hosted by
Stanford in Government (SIG).
McLennan and Sanders began
their discussion by sharing their per
spectives on Christianity, how they
think the general public perceives it
and the role of religion in politics
today.
McLennan said he wished to clar
ify three commonly misunderstood
aspects of Christianity. First, he said,
the Scripture was not written by God,
but a reflection of mankind's quest
for the divine; second, McLennan
said, no personal conversion experi
ence is necessary for someone to be
come a Christian; and finally, he con
cluded, Jesus was someone who was
"not God, but a great historical
teacher," and McLennan's "Lord and
Savior."
McLennan then read a verse from
Isaiah, in which Jesus proclaims that
the "spirit of the Lord is upon me ...
he tells me to bring peace to the
poor."
