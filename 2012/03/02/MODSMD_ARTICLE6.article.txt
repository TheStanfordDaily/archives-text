## Activist Grace Lee Boggs 'reimagines revolution' 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
"We can't just be active," said so
cial activist Grace Lee Boggs to a
group at the Black House Communi
ty Room Thursday afternoon. "We've
got to be philosophical activists."
Boggs came to Stanford as part of
a co-sponsorship between the Asian
American
Activities Center (A3C), Okada
House and the Stanford Institute for
Diversity in the
Arts (IDA) for an event entitled,"The
Next American Revolutionary." The
event was named after her latest
book, "The Next American Revolu
tion: Sustainable Activism in the 21st
Century," of which she signed copies
after the event.
Scott Kurashige, co-author of
Bogg's book, and David Palumbo-
Liu, director of the Stanford Asian
American Studies Program, served as
moderators
Boggs' legacy as an activist spans
more than 70 years she was in
volved with most of the 20th century's
major social movements, including
the labor, civil rights black power,
women's rights and environmental
justice movements.
Boggs said the best way to make a
change on institutional issues in our
modem world is to reimagine our
selves the institutions and revolution
itself
Boggs focused her discussion on
her activist work in Detroit, her home
town, and on the lack of jobs in both
Detroit and the nation. The solution,
she said, is not the creation of more
jobs she described as having "man
gled us and made us into machines"
but instead a revolution based on
reimagining.
"We thought we could compen
sate for our dehumanization at work
by our consumption," Boggs said,
"Reimagining revolution means
reimagining jobs that make us
human."
Boggs also spoke about education
issues and how "we need to see young
people as the solution and not part of
the problems"
She advocated a more horizontal
relationship between students and
teachers and a community-based ed

ucation that maximizes student cre
ativity.
"Reimagining education means
relating to our children in a more
human way," Boggs said.
Monica Vu 'l4, who attended as
part of Palumbo-Liu's Comparative
Fiction of Race and Ethnicity class,
said Boggs' concept of revolution as
reimagining and her emphasis on
community struck a chord.
"I've been to conferences; I've
tried to promote issues that pertain to
Asian American activism but no one's
every really addressed them as point
edly as [Boggs] has," Vu said. "She
talks about making something of
yourself and affecting your communi
ty through your own means without
discounting what leaders can do."
Kurashige echoed Boggs' idea of a
more visionary form of activism and
said that the book aims to share these
ideas and observations from their
work in Detroit as away to start dia
logue.
"It's not just that we need to go out
and protest all the things that we think
are wrong and all the people that we
think are in charge of the country,"
Kurashige said. "What we really need
to do is develop a new vision that goes
along with creating new actions that
will bring about the potential transfor
mations we need in terms of our
selves, our communities and our insti
tutions."
IDA Executive Director Jeff
Chang wrote in an email to The Daily,
"There are a lot of Grace Lee Boggs'
fans and followers on the Stanford
campus and in the larger community,
so it made perfect sense for us to try to
bring her here to speak."
Chang went on to say that IDA
was interested in the way Boggs talks
about culture as a vehicle to shift peo
ple's values toward inclusivity, sustain
ability and freedom, and how she
doesn't exclude culture from politics.
"She argues that the arts and
artists play a crucial role in transform
ing their communities and their world
that cultural change precedes po
litical change," Chang wrote, "That is
IDA's founding philosophy in a nut
shell."
