## The 						perks of working in sports 
### Jack Blanchat 
If you're a sports fan, there's a
good chance you thought about
all the changes you would make
to a team if you were in charge.
You definitely would not have
signed Barry Zito to a seven-year,
$126-million deal. You would have
drafted Aaron Rogers instead of
Alex Smith with that first pick. The
Chris Paul-to-the-Lakers trade was
totally your idea. If you think like
this, chances are you've probably
spent some time perusing team web
sites to see who might be willing to
hire you and train you to become the
talented general manager you know
you'll be someday.
Every year, college kids line up in
droves to try and work for every
MLB, NFL, NBA and NHL team
out there and if you're reading
this column there's a good chance
you're among that horde —so I
thought I might be able to impart to
you, dear reader, a little wisdom
from my past experiences. For two
years, I was one of the lucky few kids
who had an internship with a pro
sports team (an NFL team), and
there are some things you should
know before you consider applying
for a job in pro sports.
For every pro sports team in
every league, employment opportu
nities are limited at best. There are a
couple jobs available with every
team in the NFL, NBA, MLB and
NHL, but there's a couple of catches.
The first one is that you have to
know someone in the organization
to get a job there. It's close to impos
sible to get a job if you don't know
somebody who already works for
the team.Teams always tell you they
had several thousand applications
for just five positions (or something
like that), so the only way to pick
from among that group is to pick
those who have connections.
The next thing that's not so good
about working for a pro sports team
is the pay. Simply put, it's not very
good. Like, terrible. This is mostly be
cause most teams don't pay their in
terns they offer internships in ex
change for college credit, not mone
tary compensation. Personally, I've
always felt that if a front office offers
you college credit instead of money,
they're exploiting you they're
getting free labor, and a lot of it. For
example, the typical workweek dur
ing an NFL training camp is between
60 and 80 hours a week.
That said, I can't blame them for
not paying their employees well
it's good economics on their part.
When supply rapidly outstrips de
mand, they know they don't have to
offer much compensation in return.
Because so many kids would cut off
their left hand for a chance to work
for the St. Louis Cardinals or the
New York Jets, they can offer next to
nothing and still get thousands of ap
plications for those jobs.
Despite the crummy aspects of
working in pro sports, the perks are
outstanding they make the long
hours and low pay all worth it. You
get more team gear than one person
could ever wear, free food and the
ability to walk around everywhere
in a pro stadium, even on game days.
Sometimes, teams will even give
their regular employees access to
the players' weight room. It's hard
not to feel like a boss when you roll
around a stadium during a game
rocking a walkie-talkie with an ear
piece (like you're in the secret serv
ice, so legit) while you're decked out
in official team clothes.
The best perk has to be the food,
because you get to eat at the same
cafeteria that the players do, and
teams go all out to make sure their
multimillion-dollar investments are
well fed. Did I mention that you also
get to rub elbows with those players
every day? It's pretty cool to walk by
an All-Star player every time you
walk down the hall.
So if you've gotten to the end of
this column and aren't sure whether
or not you should apply to work in

the world of sports, I'll give you one
final piece of advice do it. It's a lot
of hours and grunt work for not
much pay, but you won't find a job
anywhere else that is more fun and
will make all your friends jealous.
And who knows: If you're really
lucky, you might get Jonah Hill to
play you in a movie someday.

an All-Star player every time you
walk down the hall.
So if you've gotten to the end of
this column and aren't sure whether
or not you should apply to work in

the world of sports, I'll give you one
final piece of advice do it. It's a lot
of hours and grunt work for not
much pay, but you won't find a job
anywhere else that is more fun and
will make all your friends jealous.
And who knows: If you're really
lucky, you might get Jonah Hill to
play you in a movie someday.

If you're a sports fan, there's a
good chance you thought about
all the changes you would make
to a team if you were in charge.
You definitely would not have
signed Barry Zito to a seven-year,
$126-million deal. You would have
drafted Aaron Rogers instead of
Alex Smith with that first pick. The
Chris Paul-to-the-Lakers trade was
totally your idea. If you think like
this, chances are you've probably
spent some time perusing team web
sites to see who might be willing to
hire you and train you to become the
talented general manager you know
you'll be someday.
Every year, college kids line up in
droves to try and work for every
MLB, NFL, NBA and NHL team
out there and if you're reading
this column there's a good chance
you're among that horde —so I
thought I might be able to impart to
you, dear reader, a little wisdom
from my past experiences. For two
years, I was one of the lucky few kids
who had an internship with a pro
sports team (an NFL team), and
there are some things you should
know before you consider applying
for a job in pro sports.
For every pro sports team in
every league, employment opportu
nities are limited at best. There are a
couple jobs available with every
team in the NFL, NBA, MLB and
NHL, but there's a couple of catches.
The first one is that you have to
know someone in the organization
to get a job there. It's close to impos
sible to get a job if you don't know
somebody who already works for
the team.Teams always tell you they
had several thousand applications
for just five positions (or something
like that), so the only way to pick
from among that group is to pick
those who have connections.
The next thing that's not so good
about working for a pro sports team
is the pay. Simply put, it's not very
good. Like, terrible. This is mostly be
cause most teams don't pay their in
terns they offer internships in ex
change for college credit, not mone
tary compensation. Personally, I've
always felt that if a front office offers
you college credit instead of money,
they're exploiting you they're
getting free labor, and a lot of it. For
example, the typical workweek dur
ing an NFL training camp is between
60 and 80 hours a week.
That said, I can't blame them for
not paying their employees well
it's good economics on their part.
When supply rapidly outstrips de
mand, they know they don't have to
offer much compensation in return.
Because so many kids would cut off
their left hand for a chance to work
for the St. Louis Cardinals or the
New York Jets, they can offer next to
nothing and still get thousands of ap
plications for those jobs.
Despite the crummy aspects of
working in pro sports, the perks are
outstanding they make the long
hours and low pay all worth it. You
get more team gear than one person
could ever wear, free food and the
ability to walk around everywhere
in a pro stadium, even on game days.
Sometimes, teams will even give
their regular employees access to
the players' weight room. It's hard
not to feel like a boss when you roll
around a stadium during a game
rocking a walkie-talkie with an ear
piece (like you're in the secret serv
ice, so legit) while you're decked out
in official team clothes.
The best perk has to be the food,
because you get to eat at the same
cafeteria that the players do, and
teams go all out to make sure their
multimillion-dollar investments are
well fed. Did I mention that you also
get to rub elbows with those players
every day? It's pretty cool to walk by
an All-Star player every time you
walk down the hall.
