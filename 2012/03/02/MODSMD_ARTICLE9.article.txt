# READY FOR THE ROAD
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The top-ranked Stanford baseball team
opens a series at Fresno State tonight in what
will be a weekend of firsts for the 8-0 Cardinal.
This is the squad's first three-game set on
the road after losing five of its eight away series
a year ago. This is the first time this year that
Stanford has stability in its pitching rotation
following the emergence of freshman Sunday
starter John Hochstatter. And it's also the first
time the Cardinal can call itself the No. 1 team
in the country in eight years, ending Stanford's
longest sojourn from the top of the national
rankings since longtime head coach Mark
Marquess' first days at the helm of the pro

gram in the late '7os and early 'Bos.
The Cardinal earned that ranking by
throwing off preseason top-15 teams Vander
bilt and Texas without much difficulty, sweep
ing those two squads by a combined score of
62-18. But even though this weekend's oppo
nent, the Bulldogs (3-5), might not be as high
ly touted, Stanford can't afford to take the
weekend off.
"We'll bring the same intensity," Marquess
said. "[The players] know that it doesn't make
any difference whom you're playing if you
don't play well. Pacific hadn't won a game yet
and they almost had us beat over there. If you
don't play well, you get beat."
The Cardinal's closest call this season was a
9-7 extra-innings win over Pacific on Feb. 21 in

the team's only road game at that point. Avoid
ing a similar lapse is a priority heading into this
weekend's trip to Fresno.
"Our motto this year has been that we're
going to outwork every team in the country,
and I think we've just got to keep that mental
ity going into Fresno," junior centerfielder
Jake Stewart said. "They're going to be tough,
and especially playing them down there, we've
got to be sure that we go down there and play
our best every day, and not let one get by us."
Fresno State fell flat in its last game, a 7-1
home loss to UC-Santa Barbara, while the
Cardinal won its Tuesday game against UC-
Davis 5-1 thanks to two hits and a leadoff
home run from Stewart, his second dinger of
the season.

Stanford holds a 77-44 advantage in the all
time series with the Bulldogs, though it has not
met Fresno State in five years. When the Car
dinal hosted the Bulldogs in 2007, weather lim
ited the series to two games and Stanford
earned the partial sweep.
For the squad to take all three contests this
weekend and return back to the Farm with an
11-0 record on Sunday, it's going to have to go
through a pair of Bulldog starters who have
rarely faltered this season. Don't be fooled by
the 1-1 records of lefthanders Thomas Harlan
and Tyler Linehan; their respective 0.71 and
0.59 ERAs are clearly going to be a test for
Stanford's loaded lineup.
Even with offensive explosions, such as an
eight-run inning in the series finale against
Vanderbilt and a 13-run frame last Sunday
against Texas, the Cardinal is looking to add a
degree of consistency to all areas of its game
with the season still in its early stages.
"We have guys who aren't hitting like they
would like right now, and I think that it's only
a matter of time before those guys start to, and
we have all the confidence in the world in
those guys," Stewart said. "The schedule we've
played has helped us because we came here to
play the best, and playing these good teams is
really setting us up well."
This series can also be a proving ground for
Stanford's pitching staff, which seems to have
answered questions about the Sunday starter
and closer spots, with freshmen Hochstatter
and David Schmidt stepping into those roles.
Behind feared juniors Brett Mooneyham and
Mark Appel who was named the Pac-12
Pitcher of the Week after striking out 10 bat
ters and giving up one run in seven innings last
Friday Hochstatter's challenge will be to
keep up his 0.71 ERA and .116 opponents'
batting average pitching in a hostile environ
ment for the first time.
Fresno State's lineup averaged over eight
runs per contest in its four-game opening se-

ries with Butler, but its production
has fallen off considerably since
then, putting up just 11 runs in five
games and being shut out twice. By
comparison, the Cardinal has
scored 40 times in its last five con
tests, and seven of Stanford's nine
regular starters have at least six
RBIs the tally for the Bulldogs'
team leaders, freshman rightfield

er Jordan Luplow and senior sec
ond baseman Patrick Hutcheson
on the season.
The difficulty of Stanford's
conference schedule makes this
weekend seem that much more
important, with six Pac-12 schools
already climbing into the rankings
at some point this season. And
even though the Cardinal seems to
have created some separation for
itself at the top of the conference
with its early play, Stanford still has
work to do before conference play
begins.
"We've played well, we've

scored a lot of runs and we've got
some timely hitting," Marquess
said. "We're really swinging the
bats well. But we've still got to go
to Fresno, play a tough Fresno
State team there, and play [No. 4]
Rice. So we'll still be tested some
more. We're still finding things
out."
The series kicks off tonight at 6
p.m. in Fresno, with the Saturday
start set for 6 p.m. and the Sunday
matchup slated for 1 p.m.

9-7 extra-innings win over Pacific on Feb. 21 in

the team's only road game at that point. Avoid
ing a similar lapse is a priority heading into this
weekend's trip to Fresno.
"Our motto this year has been that we're
going to outwork every team in the country,
and I think we've just got to keep that mental
ity going into Fresno," junior centerfielder
Jake Stewart said. "They're going to be tough,
and especially playing them down there, we've
got to be sure that we go down there and play
our best every day, and not let one get by us."
Fresno State fell flat in its last game, a 7-1
home loss to UC-Santa Barbara, while the
Cardinal won its Tuesday game against UC-
Davis 5-1 thanks to two hits and a leadoff
home run from Stewart, his second dinger of
the season.

Stanford holds a 77-44 advantage in the all
time series with the Bulldogs, though it has not
met Fresno State in five years. When the Car
dinal hosted the Bulldogs in 2007, weather lim
ited the series to two games and Stanford
earned the partial sweep.
For the squad to take all three contests this
weekend and return back to the Farm with an
11-0 record on Sunday, it's going to have to go
through a pair of Bulldog starters who have
rarely faltered this season. Don't be fooled by
the 1-1 records of lefthanders Thomas Harlan
and Tyler Linehan; their respective 0.71 and
0.59 ERAs are clearly going to be a test for
Stanford's loaded lineup.
Even with offensive explosions, such as an
eight-run inning in the series finale against
Vanderbilt and a 13-run frame last Sunday
against Texas, the Cardinal is looking to add a
degree of consistency to all areas of its game
with the season still in its early stages.
"We have guys who aren't hitting like they
would like right now, and I think that it's only
a matter of time before those guys start to, and
we have all the confidence in the world in
those guys," Stewart said. "The schedule we've
played has helped us because we came here to
play the best, and playing these good teams is
really setting us up well."
This series can also be a proving ground for
Stanford's pitching staff, which seems to have
answered questions about the Sunday starter
and closer spots, with freshmen Hochstatter
and David Schmidt stepping into those roles.
Behind feared juniors Brett Mooneyham and
Mark Appel who was named the Pac-12
Pitcher of the Week after striking out 10 bat
ters and giving up one run in seven innings last
Friday Hochstatter's challenge will be to
keep up his 0.71 ERA and .116 opponents'
batting average pitching in a hostile environ
ment for the first time.

runs per contest in its four-game opening se-

has fallen off considerably since
then, putting up just 11 runs in five
games and being shut out twice. By
comparison, the Cardinal has
scored 40 times in its last five con
tests, and seven of Stanford's nine
regular starters have at least six
RBIs the tally for the Bulldogs'
team leaders, freshman rightfield

er Jordan Luplow and senior sec
ond baseman Patrick Hutcheson
on the season.
The difficulty of Stanford's
conference schedule makes this
weekend seem that much more
important, with six Pac-12 schools
already climbing into the rankings
at some point this season. And
even though the Cardinal seems to
have created some separation for
itself at the top of the conference
with its early play, Stanford still has
work to do before conference play
begins.
"We've played well, we've

scored a lot of runs and we've got
some timely hitting," Marquess
said. "We're really swinging the
bats well. But we've still got to go
to Fresno, play a tough Fresno
State team there, and play [No. 4]
Rice. So we'll still be tested some
more. We're still finding things
out."

The top-ranked Stanford baseball team
opens a series at Fresno State tonight in what
will be a weekend of firsts for the 8-0 Cardinal.
This is the squad's first three-game set on
the road after losing five of its eight away series
a year ago. This is the first time this year that
Stanford has stability in its pitching rotation
following the emergence of freshman Sunday
starter John Hochstatter. And it's also the first
time the Cardinal can call itself the No. 1 team
in the country in eight years, ending Stanford's
longest sojourn from the top of the national
rankings since longtime head coach Mark
Marquess' first days at the helm of the pro

gram in the late '7os and early 'Bos.
The Cardinal earned that ranking by
throwing off preseason top-15 teams Vander
bilt and Texas without much difficulty, sweep
ing those two squads by a combined score of
62-18. But even though this weekend's oppo
nent, the Bulldogs (3-5), might not be as high
ly touted, Stanford can't afford to take the
weekend off.
"We'll bring the same intensity," Marquess
said. "[The players] know that it doesn't make
any difference whom you're playing if you
don't play well. Pacific hadn't won a game yet
and they almost had us beat over there. If you
don't play well, you get beat."

9-7 extra-innings win over Pacific on Feb. 21 in
