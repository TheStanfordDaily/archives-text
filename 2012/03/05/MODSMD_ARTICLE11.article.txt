# ALLISON CARRUTH
## SPICING UP STS 
### KATY STORCH 
Much like a chef prepares an
elaborate meal with diverse
ingredients, Allison Carruth
'O4 M.A. 'OB Ph.D., the new
associate director of Stan
ford's Science, Technology and Society pro
gram (STS), has returned to campus to con
coct a dish of her own. However, instead of
a gourmet meal, this dish comes in the form
of spicing up the major with a blend of STS
courses and concentrations relating to the
intersection between contemporary cul
ture, biotechnology and food science.
The STS program, which provides stu
dents with an interdisciplinary approach to
studying science, technology, engineering
and other interrelated fields, recently un
derwent administrative changes, with the
hiring of a new director, Fred Turner of the
Communication Department, and Carruth,
formerly an associate professor of English
at the University of Oregon.
Since arriving on campus, Carruth has
assisted in revamping the entire STS major
after evaluating similar programs across
the country and receiving input from stu
dents and faculty. The new curriculum will
keep much of its initial focus, but will ex
pand to include two new tracks: Environ
ment and Sustainability and Life Science
and Biotechnology. In addition, a more
concentrated core will directly inform each
of the six individual tracks within the
major.The changes are set to take effect on
Sept. 1,2012.
Carruth comes to Stanford with a back
ground in food studies, environmental hu
manities and post-industrial American lit
erature and culture experience that has
allowed her to contribute to innovations in
the new STS curriculum.
"Dr. Carruth brings an exceptional ex
pertise to bear on the intersection of cul
ture and technology," Turner said." [She has
incorporated] a forward-looking desire to
integrate new areas of scientific and tech-

nological activity into
conversation with new
approaches in the hu
manities and social sci
ences."
As a result of her con
tributions to the pro
gram, STS students such
as Maya Amoils 'l2, a
peer advisor in the STS
program, are able to fur
ther specialize their aca
demic focus within the
major.
"The concentration
options seem exciting,
cutting-edge and rele
vant to Stanford's broad
er ethos ... and ensure
that students graduate
with more concentrated
interests and expertise,"
Amoils said.

Aside from polishing the STS curricu
lum, Carruth also teaches courses in the de
partment, including a new course titled,
"Wired Space, Green Space," open to all
class years and majors, and a senior collo
quium titled, "Food in the Information
Age."
Along the lines of her interest in food
studies, Carruth's senior colloquium focus
es on the culture and politics of food in the
modern age, allowing students to incorpo
rate ideas and material from the arts, an
thropology and natural sciences into their
studies. Among other class projects, Car
ruth splits the students into teams and as
signs them a Bay Area start-up dealing with

food and environmental
issues to profile in order
to understand food sys
tems and practices in
contemporary society.
"Dr. Carruth did not
fall short of my expecta
tions," said Amoils, who
took the colloquium this
past fall quarter. "It was
one of my favorite class
es at Stanford."
Carruth said she feels
equally inspired by her
interactions with the stu
dents taking her course
and those who are under
her guidance as STS ma
jors.

According to Car
ruth, "The students are
curious, ask really great
questions and are very
entrepreneurial" as they pursue their con
centrations within the major.
Carruth said she believes that the honors
students in the program are especially im
pressive as they carve out their own aca
demic fields and push for an understanding
of the ethical dilemmas and social potential
faced by a technologically advanced society.
She cited one student who is carrying
out studies on the California high-speed
rail project, a topic Carruth argues bridges
both quantitative and qualitative research
methods in its focus on the infrastructure of
the project and the technological obstacles
that stand in its way.
Despite her varied intellectual interests,

Carruth suggests she was not raised in an
"academic" family.
"My grandfather went as far as the sev
enth grade and then worked in an oil re
finery all his life, but he was a self-taught
student of history and science," Carruth
said.
As a child, Carruth was a voracious
reader and recalls frequently reading
books with her grandparents, an activity
that instilled in her the value of education
and hard work from a young age.
Raised in an extended family that in
cludes factory workers, ranchers, entrepre
neurs, educators and psychologists, Car
ruth's interest in the transformative powers
and environmental consequences of the In
dustrial Age took hold early on.
She completed her master's and doctor
ate degrees at Stanford in English and
American literature and wrote her disser
tation on the history of industrial agricul
ture in America. Her work has recently
been expanded into a book titled, "Global
Appetites: American Power and the Litera
ture of Food." According to Carruth, the
book examines work by American writers
and artists, arguing that industrial agricul
ture became a facilitator of American
power, and that food became an inspiration
for new kinds of art.
In the future, Carruth hopes to continue
to publish work that inspires discussion and
interest in others.
"Having a career where I get to be in a
world-class research community environ
ment, collaborating with great scholars
[makes up] one big piece of the long-term
goal," she said.
The Stanford community, in other
words, is a pivotal ingredient in the broader
scope of her career as both an architect
or chef of the STS program, and as a
contributor to the greater "dish" of acade
mia.
