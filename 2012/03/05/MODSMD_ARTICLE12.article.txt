## EDITORIAL Activism is more than just clicking a button 
### 
How many times in recent
weeks have you as a stu
dent or community mem
ber added your name to the latest
online petition? Change.org, one
of the larger online sites for gen
erating "e-petitions," has a dizzy
ing array of topics subject to on
line activism: Apple's labor prac
tices in China, MPAA movie rat
ings, North Korean refugees and
more. These online petitions, ac
cording to a University of West
minster study, are being generat
ed at far greater rates than their
non-online predecessors. This
deluge of online petitions leads
us to ask the question: How effec
tive is this new form of digital ac
tivism?
Change.org certainly believes
in the efficacy of online petitions:
It cites a number of examples of
petitions that have arguably led
to companies and governments
amending policies. For instance,
after an online petition drive at
Change.org and a mass exodus of
customers, Bank of America de
cided not to implement a new $5
per month banking fee. Verizon
similarly dropped a proposed $2
online payment fee after highly
negative Internet coverage and
130,000 Change.org signatures.
But how critical were the on
line petitions in achieving these
ends? In both of the above exam
ples as with many of the other
Change.org examples the on
line petition was merely one com
ponent of public disapproval.
Furthermore, most of the suc
cessful petitions ultimately con
cern corporate decisions or high
profile criminal cases while more
substantial issues generally re
quire more institutional support
to effect change. For instance, a
wildly popular citizen-initiated
petition at Whitehouse.gov that
called for marijuana legalization
was unsuccessful in producing
meaningful discourse in govern
ment over reform of controlled
substances laws.
Many believe that online peti
tions have greatly risen in popu
larity because the strategy allows
the signatories to "feel good" be

cause they have "done some
thing," without necessarily hav
ing accomplished anything sub
stantive. This phenomenon,
termed "slacktivism," could be
counterproductive: Citizens who
may have otherwise engaged in
effective advocacy, such as writ
ing their representatives or
protesting, might instead feel
content signing online petitions
without realizing that each signa
ture has a minimal effect on the
policymaking process.
In addition to doubts about
the efficacy of online petitions,
the Editorial Board questions
whether effective online peti
tions are even desirable. For in
stance, one oft-cited instance of
an effective online petition is the
Road Tax petition in the United
Kingdom, calling for the scrap
ping of a pay-as-you-drive tax. In
the span of a few months in 2006
and 2007, the Road Tax petition
managed to accumulate more
than 1.8 million signatures in a
nation of just 60 million; the
British government was, accord
ing to the Westminster study, sub
sequently forced to scrap its road
tax plans that "many considered
an unpopular but necessary path
to safeguard the environment."
When government steps in to
make difficult decisions
whether unpopular tax hikes
aimed at protecting the environ
ment or research for diseases that
have few victims the ease and
swiftness with which online peti
tions can garner the appearance
of massive public opposition to a
measure may kill legislation
aimed at the long-term, best in
terests of constituents.
The Internet undoubtedly
presents exciting new opportuni
ties for citizens to become in
volved in the policymaking
process and to present their con
cerns directly to corporations and
governments. However, given
that the overall efficacy of such
petitions has not been convinc
ingly shown, the Editorial Board
suggests to readers that they do
more than sign a petition if they
want to bring about change.
