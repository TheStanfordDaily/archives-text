## One lingering question for the Palestinian nonviolence movement

Fadi Quran is a remarkable
man. Peter Beinart suggest
ed it in his Daily Beast fea
ture. Robert Wright wrote it in
The Atlantic. I know it from our
three memorable overlapping
years at Stanford.
In fall 2006, I approached a
freshman Fadi, asking, "So, when
are you and I going to get to know
each other?" Despite a plethora
of ideological obstacles, the trust
the two of us would forge over
weekly campus walks, a Shabbat
dinner at my home, and even pub
lic debate, was unique. I passion
ately disagreed with his views. Yet
I understood that the enlightened
values, intellect, and a once-in-a
generation leadership he exuded
predestined him to become a man
capable of transforming a conflict
that enflames the passions of
Arab and Jew alike.
By now, many of us have
doubtless seen the video of Fadi's
arrest in Hebron. Undoubtedly,
Fadi's protest was entirely nonvi
olent, and the soldier's brutal ar
rest was unjustifiable. Fair-mind
ed people, be they pro-Israel (as I
am) or otherwise, were right to

call for Fadi's release from jail and
for his charges to be dropped (as I
did). And out of respect for his
hardship, I felt a duty to await his
release before publishing this
piece.
Nonviolence has the capability
to transform the Israeli-Palestin
ian conflict. Indeed, Kenneth Pol
lack of the Brookings Institution
famously argued that "if [the
Palestinians] had been led by
Gandhi rather than [former PLO
Chairman] Yasser Arafat, they
would have had a state twenty
years ago." The means are worthy.
And if these nonviolent means
are paired with worthy ends, we
ought to cheer the movement on
and do everything possible to em
power it.
Free thinkers are predisposed
to rally behind nonviolent move
ments, with good reason. Histori
cally, such justified means have
been married to equally just ends.
Our collective memory of nonvio
lence is tied to Gandhis and Kings,
men who stood for righteousness
while confronting hardship and
