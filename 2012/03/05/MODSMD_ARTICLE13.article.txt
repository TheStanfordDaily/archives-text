# OP-ED
## One lingering question for the Palestinian nonviolence movement 
### MARK DONIG '09 Former co-president of the Stanford Israel Alliance 
Fadi Quran is a remarkable
man. Peter Beinart suggest
ed it in his Daily Beast fea
ture. Robert Wright wrote it in
The Atlantic. I know it from our
three memorable overlapping
years at Stanford.
In fall 2006, I approached a
freshman Fadi, asking, "So, when
are you and I going to get to know
each other?" Despite a plethora
of ideological obstacles, the trust
the two of us would forge over
weekly campus walks, a Shabbat
dinner at my home, and even pub
lic debate, was unique. I passion
ately disagreed with his views. Yet
I understood that the enlightened
values, intellect, and a once-in-a
generation leadership he exuded
predestined him to become a man
capable of transforming a conflict
that enflames the passions of
Arab and Jew alike.
By now, many of us have
doubtless seen the video of Fadi's
arrest in Hebron. Undoubtedly,
Fadi's protest was entirely nonvi
olent, and the soldier's brutal ar
rest was unjustifiable. Fair-mind
ed people, be they pro-Israel (as I
am) or otherwise, were right to

call for Fadi's release from jail and
for his charges to be dropped (as I
did). And out of respect for his
hardship, I felt a duty to await his
release before publishing this
piece.
Nonviolence has the capability
to transform the Israeli-Palestin
ian conflict. Indeed, Kenneth Pol
lack of the Brookings Institution
famously argued that "if [the
Palestinians] had been led by
Gandhi rather than [former PLO
Chairman] Yasser Arafat, they
would have had a state twenty
years ago." The means are worthy.
And if these nonviolent means
are paired with worthy ends, we
ought to cheer the movement on
and do everything possible to em
power it.
Free thinkers are predisposed
to rally behind nonviolent move
ments, with good reason. Histori
cally, such justified means have
been married to equally just ends.
Our collective memory of nonvio
lence is tied to Gandhis and Kings,
men who stood for righteousness
while confronting hardship and
discrimination. Likewise, an em
powered, emboldened, effective
nonviolent Palestinian move
ment whose ultimate aims were
an end to occupation and a real
ization of the all-too-elusive two
state solution (one Jewish, one
Palestinian) could be the greatest
opportunity for peace in this con
flict's history. Moreover, Israel
would be wise to reach out and
strengthen nonviolent Palestini
ans protesting for a two-state so
lution because such a movement
would not present a strategic
threat to Israel. Quite the con
trary: it would present an existen
tial threat to anti-Israel terrorist
entities like Hamas by fundamen
tally undercutting two assertions
that underpin the extremist nar
rative: that the Palestinians must
exterminate Israel to achieve in
dependence, and that they can
only do so through violence.
If, however, the goal of the
nonviolent movement is itself ex
tremist to turn Israel, the West
Bank, and Gaza into a single na
tion, demographically rendering
Jews a minority and effectively
wiping off the map the Jewish
state it will lose people like me
forever. A movement's just
means does not negate entirely
unjustifiable ends. The Jewish
people have yearned for millen
nia to take the reins of their own
destiny, in their own autonomous

nation and in their ancestral
homeland. That Jews today have
realized this dream despite un
ending historical persecution and
constant threats of Israel's exter
mination is nothing short of
miraculous. I acknowledge that
the Palestinians, too, have a claim
to this land, and I accept their
right for statehood. But just as I
hope nonviolence paves the way
for Palestinian independence, no
actor can be considered accept
able if its stated goal would mean
the destruction of another sover
eign state. Such unjust proclama
tions require no Gandhian or
Kingian moral courage, but in
stead evoke the radical senti
ments of Hamas and Hezbollah.
Fadi has tapped into some
thing. Never before have I seen so
many proudly pro-Israel Jews rally
behind a Palestinian. The nonvio
lent movement is real and grow
ing, and I believe that within a gen
eration its leaders have the poten
tial to replace both Fatah and
Hamas as the legitimate represen
tation of Palestinian aspirations.
Now, with Fadi freed, is the
time for the leaders of this move
ment to state their ultimate goal.
Do you acknowledge Israel's
right to exist, or not? Is it the two
state solution you seek, or a de
facto destruction of Israel? The
answers will determine whether I,
and those like me, can stand with
you for your means or cannot
for your ends.

tial threat to anti-Israel terrorist
entities like Hamas by fundamen
tally undercutting two assertions
that underpin the extremist nar
rative: that the Palestinians must
exterminate Israel to achieve in
dependence, and that they can
only do so through violence.
If, however, the goal of the
nonviolent movement is itself ex
tremist to turn Israel, the West
Bank, and Gaza into a single na
tion, demographically rendering
Jews a minority and effectively
wiping off the map the Jewish
state it will lose people like me
forever. A movement's just
means does not negate entirely
unjustifiable ends. The Jewish
people have yearned for millen
nia to take the reins of their own
destiny, in their own autonomous

nation and in their ancestral
homeland. That Jews today have
realized this dream despite un
ending historical persecution and
constant threats of Israel's exter
mination is nothing short of
miraculous. I acknowledge that
the Palestinians, too, have a claim
to this land, and I accept their
right for statehood. But just as I
hope nonviolence paves the way
for Palestinian independence, no
actor can be considered accept
able if its stated goal would mean
the destruction of another sover
eign state. Such unjust proclama
tions require no Gandhian or
Kingian moral courage, but in
stead evoke the radical senti
ments of Hamas and Hezbollah.
Fadi has tapped into some
thing. Never before have I seen so
many proudly pro-Israel Jews rally
behind a Palestinian. The nonvio
lent movement is real and grow
ing, and I believe that within a gen
eration its leaders have the poten
tial to replace both Fatah and
Hamas as the legitimate represen
tation of Palestinian aspirations.
Now, with Fadi freed, is the
time for the leaders of this move
ment to state their ultimate goal.
Do you acknowledge Israel's
right to exist, or not? Is it the two
state solution you seek, or a de
facto destruction of Israel? The
answers will determine whether I,
and those like me, can stand with
you for your means or cannot
for your ends.
Fadi Quran is a remarkable
man. Peter Beinart suggest
ed it in his Daily Beast fea
ture. Robert Wright wrote it in
The Atlantic. I know it from our
three memorable overlapping
years at Stanford.
In fall 2006, I approached a
freshman Fadi, asking, "So, when
are you and I going to get to know
each other?" Despite a plethora
of ideological obstacles, the trust
the two of us would forge over
weekly campus walks, a Shabbat
dinner at my home, and even pub
lic debate, was unique. I passion
ately disagreed with his views. Yet
I understood that the enlightened
values, intellect, and a once-in-a
generation leadership he exuded
predestined him to become a man
capable of transforming a conflict
that enflames the passions of
Arab and Jew alike.
By now, many of us have
doubtless seen the video of Fadi's
arrest in Hebron. Undoubtedly,
Fadi's protest was entirely nonvi
olent, and the soldier's brutal ar
rest was unjustifiable. Fair-mind
ed people, be they pro-Israel (as I
am) or otherwise, were right to

call for Fadi's release from jail and
for his charges to be dropped (as I
did). And out of respect for his
hardship, I felt a duty to await his
release before publishing this
piece.
Nonviolence has the capability
to transform the Israeli-Palestin
ian conflict. Indeed, Kenneth Pol
lack of the Brookings Institution
famously argued that "if [the
Palestinians] had been led by
Gandhi rather than [former PLO
Chairman] Yasser Arafat, they
would have had a state twenty
years ago." The means are worthy.
And if these nonviolent means
are paired with worthy ends, we
ought to cheer the movement on
and do everything possible to em
power it.
Free thinkers are predisposed
to rally behind nonviolent move
ments, with good reason. Histori
cally, such justified means have
been married to equally just ends.
Our collective memory of nonvio
lence is tied to Gandhis and Kings,
men who stood for righteousness
while confronting hardship and
discrimination. Likewise, an em
powered, emboldened, effective
nonviolent Palestinian move
ment whose ultimate aims were
an end to occupation and a real
ization of the all-too-elusive two
state solution (one Jewish, one
Palestinian) could be the greatest
opportunity for peace in this con
flict's history. Moreover, Israel
would be wise to reach out and
strengthen nonviolent Palestini
ans protesting for a two-state so
lution because such a movement
would not present a strategic
threat to Israel. Quite the con
trary: it would present an existen
tial threat to anti-Israel terrorist
entities like Hamas by fundamen
tally undercutting two assertions
that underpin the extremist nar
rative: that the Palestinians must
exterminate Israel to achieve in
dependence, and that they can
only do so through violence.
