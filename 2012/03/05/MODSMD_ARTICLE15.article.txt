# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Conflict and cooperation 
### Miles Unterreiner 
This is the third and last in a series of
columns by the author dealing with
divestment and the Israeli-Palestin
ian conflict.
When talking about Is
rael/Palestine, it's all too
easy to focus on the
things we don't agree about. That
is natural and to some extent nec
essary. Without deeply engaging
with, acknowledging and working
out compromises on issues of fun
damental difference, no long
term solution will ever be possi
ble.
But we also shouldn't lose
sight of things we can all agree on.
Here on campus, with the hotly
contested issue of divestment so
often taking center stage, it's easy
to forget that there are other op
tions out there options that all
sides in this debate should feel
safe supporting. Even better,
they're options that can have a
concrete and measurable impact
on real people, right now.
Two years ago, the Stanford Is

rael Alliance proposed an initia
tive called Invest for Peace (IFP),
which sought to raise money and
support for microfinance and
peace-building organizations op
erating in the occupied territo

ries. Unfortunately, Students
Confronting Apartheid by Israel
(SCAI), the predecessor to Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER), viewed IFP as an
attempt to blunt the momentum
of its own drive for divestment,
while the inevitable graduation of
students involved with the pro
gram slowly bled it of drive and
energy.
We should bring IFP, or a form
of it, back to campus.
A reconstituted cooperative
investment board, composed of
representatives from both SPER
and Stanford Israel Alliance
(SIA), would have an encourag
ingly broad and diverse array of
programs from which to select.
It could start by fundraising
for Seeds of Peace, a peace-build
ing organization targeted specifi
cally toward children and adoles
cents. Founded in 1993, the pro
gram brings young Israelis and
Palestinians together at its inter-

national camp in Maine for ses
sions of constructive, rational, in
tense dialogue. In doing so, Seeds
of Peace tries to reach impres
sionable young people before the
embittering draught of experi
ence permanently makes recon
ciliation impossible empower
ing "seeds" who will one day
grow into world leaders commit
ted to finding peaceful solutions
to intractable problems.
The board could also consid
er Lend for Peace, a Kiva-esque
microfinance organization
doing on-the-ground invest
ment work in the Palestinian
territories. Founded by two Jews
and two Palestinians, LFP "was
created to enable people of all
faiths and backgrounds to make
a tangible difference in the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict by co
operatively addressing the
often-ignored issue of economic
inequality and Palestinian pover
ty." Its website connects potential
investors directly with aspiring
Palestinian small business own
ers people like Hadeel, 29,
who hopes to start her own pho
tography business, or Lutfia, 45,
who is looking for a loan of
$l,OOO to purchase sheep for her

growing agricultural firm.
These are only two of many
options, all of which the new In
vest for Peace board could and
should consider. I could talk
about the Peres Center for Peace,
the Valley of Peace Initiative,
Green Action or dozens of other
ventures promoting joint Israeli-
Palestinian economic develop
ment and cooperative dialogue.
It is sometimes objected that
such initiatives merely paint a
pleasant-looking gloss over more
fundamental structural issues,
implicitly authorizing or legiti
mating Israeli human-rights
abuses by offering surface-level
solutions to deeper problems.
One critic characterized pro
grams like Invest for Peace as
"dropping a quarter in someone's
tin cup after you've chopped off
her hands."
Believing that would be a mis
take. The very real difference
such initiatives make is not triv
ial. Furthermore, cooperative in
vestment need not operate in a
vacuum, nor should it be con
strued as a roadblock to other av
enues for peace-building. It is
only one element an absolute
ly essential one of a broader
human rights framework.
In 2001's Promises, one of my
favorite documentaries, Israeli
filmmaker B.Z. Goldberg chroni
cles the lives of seven Israeli and
Palestinian children who, though

only a few miles apart, live in what
seem like different universes.

The initial stages of the film
are chilling. Moishe lives in an Is
raeli settlement, next to a firing
range for Israeli soldiers. The fir
ing range inspires him. "Maybe if
they miss," he muses, "they'll hit
an Arab." A half-smile lights up
his face.
Faraj, meanwhile, lives in the
Deheishe refugee camp in the
West Bank and is an ardent sup
porter of Hamas. He lives in a
world where schools seem to
teach children little but how to
hate Jews and Israel, and where
hastily scrawled anti-Israel graf
fiti adorns walls and doorways.
But by the film's astonishing
conclusion, the exceptional Mr.
Goldberg has brought the chil
dren together in one place, for
one day. And despite some initial
distrust, they do what all kids do;
they play, eat and laugh together.
It might at first seem a senti
mental, useless gesture. But like
Mr. Goldberg, we shouldn't un
derestimate the power of cooper
ation to effect real and lasting
change. Let's get started.

Miles has truly enjoyed hearing
your opinions on this series of

created to enable people of all
faiths and backgrounds to make
a tangible difference in the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict by co
operatively addressing the
often-ignored issue of economic
inequality and Palestinian pover
ty." Its website connects potential
investors directly with aspiring
Palestinian small business own
ers people like Hadeel, 29,
who hopes to start her own pho
tography business, or Lutfia, 45,
who is looking for a loan of
$l,OOO to purchase sheep for her

growing agricultural firm.
These are only two of many
options, all of which the new In
vest for Peace board could and
should consider. I could talk
about the Peres Center for Peace,
the Valley of Peace Initiative,
Green Action or dozens of other
ventures promoting joint Israeli-
Palestinian economic develop
ment and cooperative dialogue.
It is sometimes objected that
such initiatives merely paint a
pleasant-looking gloss over more
fundamental structural issues,
implicitly authorizing or legiti
mating Israeli human-rights
abuses by offering surface-level
solutions to deeper problems.
One critic characterized pro
grams like Invest for Peace as
"dropping a quarter in someone's
tin cup after you've chopped off
her hands."
Believing that would be a mis
take. The very real difference
such initiatives make is not triv
ial. Furthermore, cooperative in
vestment need not operate in a
vacuum, nor should it be con
strued as a roadblock to other av
enues for peace-building. It is
only one element an absolute
ly essential one of a broader
human rights framework.
In 2001's Promises, one of my
favorite documentaries, Israeli
filmmaker B.Z. Goldberg chroni
cles the lives of seven Israeli and
Palestinian children who, though

only a few miles apart, live in what
seem like different universes.

The initial stages of the film
are chilling. Moishe lives in an Is
raeli settlement, next to a firing
range for Israeli soldiers. The fir
ing range inspires him. "Maybe if
they miss," he muses, "they'll hit
an Arab." A half-smile lights up
his face.
Faraj, meanwhile, lives in the
Deheishe refugee camp in the
West Bank and is an ardent sup
porter of Hamas. He lives in a
world where schools seem to
teach children little but how to
hate Jews and Israel, and where
hastily scrawled anti-Israel graf
fiti adorns walls and doorways.
But by the film's astonishing
conclusion, the exceptional Mr.
Goldberg has brought the chil
dren together in one place, for
one day. And despite some initial
distrust, they do what all kids do;
they play, eat and laugh together.
It might at first seem a senti
mental, useless gesture. But like
Mr. Goldberg, we shouldn't un
derestimate the power of cooper
ation to effect real and lasting
change. Let's get started.

This is the third and last in a series of
columns by the author dealing with
divestment and the Israeli-Palestin
ian conflict.
When talking about Is
rael/Palestine, it's all too
easy to focus on the
things we don't agree about. That
is natural and to some extent nec
essary. Without deeply engaging
with, acknowledging and working
out compromises on issues of fun
damental difference, no long
term solution will ever be possi
ble.
But we also shouldn't lose
sight of things we can all agree on.
Here on campus, with the hotly
contested issue of divestment so
often taking center stage, it's easy
to forget that there are other op
tions out there options that all
sides in this debate should feel
safe supporting. Even better,
they're options that can have a
concrete and measurable impact
on real people, right now.
Two years ago, the Stanford Is

rael Alliance proposed an initia
tive called Invest for Peace (IFP),
which sought to raise money and
support for microfinance and
peace-building organizations op
erating in the occupied territo

ries. Unfortunately, Students
Confronting Apartheid by Israel
(SCAI), the predecessor to Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER), viewed IFP as an
attempt to blunt the momentum
of its own drive for divestment,
while the inevitable graduation of
students involved with the pro
gram slowly bled it of drive and
energy.
We should bring IFP, or a form
of it, back to campus.
A reconstituted cooperative
investment board, composed of
representatives from both SPER
and Stanford Israel Alliance
(SIA), would have an encourag
ingly broad and diverse array of
programs from which to select.
It could start by fundraising
for Seeds of Peace, a peace-build
ing organization targeted specifi

cents. Founded in 1993, the pro

Palestinians together at its inter-
