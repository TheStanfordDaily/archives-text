# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Conflict and cooperation 
### Miles Unterreiner 
This is the third and last in a series of
columns by the author dealing with
divestment and the Israeli-Palestin
ian conflict.
When talking about Is
rael/Palestine, it's all too
easy to focus on the
things we don't agree about. That
is natural and to some extent nec
essary. Without deeply engaging
with, acknowledging and working
out compromises on issues of fun
damental difference, no long
term solution will ever be possi
ble.
But we also shouldn't lose
sight of things we can all agree on.
Here on campus, with the hotly
contested issue of divestment so
often taking center stage, it's easy
to forget that there are other op
tions out there options that all
sides in this debate should feel
safe supporting. Even better,
they're options that can have a
concrete and measurable impact
on real people, right now.
Two years ago, the Stanford Is

rael Alliance proposed an initia
tive called Invest for Peace (IFP),
which sought to raise money and
support for microfinance and
peace-building organizations op
erating in the occupied territo

ries. Unfortunately, Students
Confronting Apartheid by Israel
(SCAI), the predecessor to Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER), viewed IFP as an
attempt to blunt the momentum
of its own drive for divestment,
while the inevitable graduation of
students involved with the pro
gram slowly bled it of drive and
energy.
We should bring IFP, or a form
of it, back to campus.
A reconstituted cooperative
investment board, composed of
representatives from both SPER
and Stanford Israel Alliance
(SIA), would have an encourag
ingly broad and diverse array of
programs from which to select.
It could start by fundraising
for Seeds of Peace, a peace-build
ing organization targeted specifi
cally toward children and adoles
cents. Founded in 1993, the pro
gram brings young Israelis and
Palestinians together at its inter-

We should bring
Invest for Peace,
or a form of it,
back to campus.
