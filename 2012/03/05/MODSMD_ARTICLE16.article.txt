# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## Three of my favorite movies 
### Nina Chung 
Once upon a time, fresh
from high school, I arrived
at Stanford with plans to
double major in film and commu
nication. Before college, most of
my money used to vanish, albeit
with my consent, at the box office
at least once every two weeks.
Movie nights with friends had
been Friday staples. So, freshman
year sans car, the inaccessibility of
the theater was one of the first
grave things I felt. Over time, my
tap on the movie scene dimin
ished; the balance of movies I've
seen against movies I want to see
tipped more precariously toward
the latter.
Most of us realize there was a
thing we didn't pack with us in the
move to Stanford. Yet I haven't
quit saying that I love watching
movies sitting still in one place
and getting lost in a visual story. I
love how favorite movies become
campaigns we make to convert
our friends into fans. I love how
we can debate whether a movie
was realistic or not. I love how we

can sit right next to each other
watching the same movie and no
tice entirely different details on
the screen before us.
With that, ladies and gentle
men, I now transform this little
newspaper section into a strategic
soapbox about the following
three movies, among those I keep
watching over and over again.
(And in so doing, possibly subject
myself to the familiar criticism:
"You like that movie?") My un
abashed objective here, of course,
is to persuade you to see them all.
Here goes ...
"Ocean's Twelve"
Because it's enchanting to
watch people with chemistry. My
little brother and I watched this

movie maybe a dozen times one
summer, repeatedly enjoying
what felt like a two-hour long in
side joke. I hadn't noticed at first,
but "Twelve" constantly refer
ences "Eleven" (and I loved
"Eleven"); Rusty (Brad Pitt) is
talking with a full mouth in almost
every one of his scenes and snarky
double entendre dominates the
script. There's a scene in which
Rusty and Isabel (Catherine
Zeta-Jones) first meet in Italy
it's a second of eye contact as she
sits alone at a cafe and he grins at
her while sprinting away from the
local policemen chasing him.
Later:
"I think I saw you yesterday,"
she says.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Yeah, you were being chased
by the police."
"Chasing me? No. I don't think
so," he says.
"I'm quite sure it was you."
"Doesn't say much for the police,"'

That's how the love-affair-of
the-movie starts. It's a microcosm
of the entire movie: hints of an
idea, mysterious nods to a past
event, characters that totally click
and forget that technically they're
in complete disagreement. Don't
we love when that happens in real
life?

"The Royal Tenenbaums"
Because in the process of
doing what we think is best, we
often foil others trying to do the
same exact thing. Royal (Gene
Hackman) is an estranged hus
band and father who attempts to
reconnect his splintered family by
pretending he's dying of cancer
after getting kicked out of the
hotel he was living in for years.
Now-grown children, grandchil

dren, an adopted child, unique
coping mechanisms and hidden
love interests all end up under the
same roof like in the olden days,
except less willingly. In their re
acquaintances, they surprise each
other as they learn how much
they had all attempted to escape
each other.
"Looks like you and Dad are
back together again, huh?" Chas
(Ben Stiller) says.
"He's your dad, too, Chas,"
Richie (Luke Wilson) says.
"No, he's not."
"Yes, he is."
"You really hate me, don't
you?"
"No, I don't. I love you."
"The Science of Sleep"
Because we know how great
our minds are at making compli
cated situations out of tiny facts.
Stephane (Gael Garcia Bernal)
falls in love with his neighbor
Stephanie (Charlotte Gains
bourg). But our protagonist is not

simply an artist by occupation
he is an overactive dreamer
whose imagination starts confus
ing him as to which events have
happened and which he has only
dreamt. He seems childish to us at
times; really, though, he puts pic
tures to the ideas that can haunt
anyone with an unshakable crush.
The way he sees it:
"It's not fair. She changed ex
actly the second I started to like
her. It's like a big bang. You know,
the first instant, it's very small and
then the next nanosecond, huge
infinite. I wish I could travel
back to the time when I didn't
find her attractive."
So there you have it my first
list-style column! And, yes I'll
admit that this column was
spurred on by my viewing, finally,
of "Hugo" this past weekend.

Convinced?? Not quite? That's
okay! —we can talk about this.

at least once every two weeks.
Movie nights with friends had
been Friday staples. So, freshman
year sans car, the inaccessibility of
the theater was one of the first
grave things I felt. Over time, my
tap on the movie scene dimin
ished; the balance of movies I've
seen against movies I want to see
tipped more precariously toward
the latter.
Most of us realize there was a
thing we didn't pack with us in the
move to Stanford. Yet I haven't
quit saying that I love watching
movies sitting still in one place
and getting lost in a visual story. I
love how favorite movies become
campaigns we make to convert
our friends into fans. I love how
we can debate whether a movie
was realistic or not. I love how we

can sit right next to each other
watching the same movie and no
tice entirely different details on
the screen before us.
With that, ladies and gentle
men, I now transform this little
newspaper section into a strategic
soapbox about the following
three movies, among those I keep
watching over and over again.
(And in so doing, possibly subject
myself to the familiar criticism:
"You like that movie?") My un
abashed objective here, of course,
is to persuade you to see them all.
Here goes ...
"Ocean's Twelve"
Because it's enchanting to
watch people with chemistry. My
little brother and I watched this

movie maybe a dozen times one
summer, repeatedly enjoying
what felt like a two-hour long in
side joke. I hadn't noticed at first,
but "Twelve" constantly refer
ences "Eleven" (and I loved
"Eleven"); Rusty (Brad Pitt) is
talking with a full mouth in almost
every one of his scenes and snarky
double entendre dominates the
script. There's a scene in which
Rusty and Isabel (Catherine
Zeta-Jones) first meet in Italy
it's a second of eye contact as she
sits alone at a cafe and he grins at
her while sprinting away from the
local policemen chasing him.
Later:
"I think I saw you yesterday,"
she says.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Yeah, you were being chased
by the police."
"Chasing me? No. I don't think
so," he says.
"I'm quite sure it was you."
"Doesn't say much for the police,"'

That's how the love-affair-of
the-movie starts. It's a microcosm
of the entire movie: hints of an
idea, mysterious nods to a past
event, characters that totally click
and forget that technically they're
in complete disagreement. Don't
we love when that happens in real
life?

"The Royal Tenenbaums"
Because in the process of
doing what we think is best, we
often foil others trying to do the
same exact thing. Royal (Gene
Hackman) is an estranged hus
band and father who attempts to
reconnect his splintered family by
pretending he's dying of cancer
after getting kicked out of the
hotel he was living in for years.
Now-grown children, grandchil

dren, an adopted child, unique
coping mechanisms and hidden
love interests all end up under the
same roof like in the olden days,
except less willingly. In their re
acquaintances, they surprise each
other as they learn how much
they had all attempted to escape
each other.
"Looks like you and Dad are
back together again, huh?" Chas
(Ben Stiller) says.
"He's your dad, too, Chas,"
Richie (Luke Wilson) says.
"No, he's not."
"Yes, he is."
"You really hate me, don't
you?"
"No, I don't. I love you."
"The Science of Sleep"
Because we know how great
our minds are at making compli
cated situations out of tiny facts.
Stephane (Gael Garcia Bernal)
falls in love with his neighbor
Stephanie (Charlotte Gains
bourg). But our protagonist is not

simply an artist by occupation
he is an overactive dreamer
whose imagination starts confus
ing him as to which events have
happened and which he has only
dreamt. He seems childish to us at
times; really, though, he puts pic
tures to the ideas that can haunt
anyone with an unshakable crush.
The way he sees it:
"It's not fair. She changed ex
actly the second I started to like
her. It's like a big bang. You know,
the first instant, it's very small and
then the next nanosecond, huge
infinite. I wish I could travel
back to the time when I didn't
find her attractive."
So there you have it my first
list-style column! And, yes I'll
admit that this column was
spurred on by my viewing, finally,
of "Hugo" this past weekend.

Convinced?? Not quite? That's
okay! —we can talk about this.

Once upon a time, fresh
from high school, I arrived
at Stanford with plans to
double major in film and commu
nication. Before college, most of
my money used to vanish, albeit
with my consent, at the box office
at least once every two weeks.
