# THE
						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## Three of my favorite movies 
### Nina Chung 
Once upon a time, fresh
from high school, I arrived
at Stanford with plans to
double major in film and commu
nication. Before college, most of
my money used to vanish, albeit
with my consent, at the box office
at least once every two weeks.
Movie nights with friends had
been Friday staples. So, freshman
year sans car, the inaccessibility of
the theater was one of the first
grave things I felt. Over time, my
tap on the movie scene dimin
ished; the balance of movies I've
seen against movies I want to see
tipped more precariously toward
the latter.
Most of us realize there was a
thing we didn't pack with us in the
move to Stanford. Yet I haven't
quit saying that I love watching
movies sitting still in one place
and getting lost in a visual story. I
love how favorite movies become
campaigns we make to convert
our friends into fans. I love how
we can debate whether a movie
was realistic or not. I love how we

can sit right next to each other
watching the same movie and no
tice entirely different details on
the screen before us.
With that, ladies and gentle
men, I now transform this little
newspaper section into a strategic
soapbox about the following
three movies, among those I keep
watching over and over again.
(And in so doing, possibly subject
myself to the familiar criticism:
"You like that movie?") My un
abashed objective here, of course,
is to persuade you to see them all.
Here goes ...
"Ocean's Twelve"
Because it's enchanting to
watch people with chemistry. My
little brother and I watched this

movie maybe a dozen times one
summer, repeatedly enjoying
what felt like a two-hour long in
side joke. I hadn't noticed at first,
but "Twelve" constantly refer
ences "Eleven" (and I loved
"Eleven"); Rusty (Brad Pitt) is
talking with a full mouth in almost
every one of his scenes and snarky
double entendre dominates the
script. There's a scene in which
Rusty and Isabel (Catherine
Zeta-Jones) first meet in Italy
it's a second of eye contact as she
sits alone at a cafe and he grins at
her while sprinting away from the
local policemen chasing him.
Later:
"I think I saw you yesterday,"
she says.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Yeah, you were being chased
by the police."
"Chasing me? No. I don't think
so," he says.
"I'm quite sure it was you."
"Doesn't say much for the police,"'
