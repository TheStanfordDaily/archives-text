## BEARS BUMPED OFF CAL DENIED PAC- 12 TITLE 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
In Stanford's biggest game of the sea
son Sunday, the Cardinal was able to beat
rival Cal and deny the Golden Bears a
share of the Pac-12 regular season title.
The victory secured Stanford's first 20-
win season since 2007-08 and gave the
squad plenty of momentum going into the
season-ending conference tournament.
The Cardinal (20-10, 10-8 Pac-12)
came into the game knowing that, win or
lose, it would finish the regular season sev
enth in the Pac-12. Cal (23-8,13-5), how
ever, had the regular season conference
title on the line and was sure to come out
fighting. Stanford was determined to ruin
this for the Golden Bears, as well as pro
vide a great end to the season in front of
an energetic home crowd on Senior Night.
The Cardinal came out hard, roaring to
a 17-7 lead eight minutes into the game. As
usual, the catalyst for the offense was
freshman guard Chasson Randle, who
scored eight early points and finished with
a team-high 17.
Despite Stanford's offensive push, the
game got off to a chippy start with two
early technical fouls called on an ex
change between Cal guard Justin Cobbs
and Stanford senior guard Jarrett Mann in
the first three minutes. The two squads
would eventually combine for 40 fouls,
though the Maples Pavilion crowd was au
dibly upset with many calls the Golden
Bears only had seven fouls to Stanford's
19 at one point in the second half.
Stanford took one of its largest leads of
the game, 14 points, at the 7:30 mark due
to a rare three from senior Andrew Zim
mermann. The forward was definitely de
termined to take advantage of his final
home regular-season game, scoring a sea
son-high 13 points while playing his high
est minutes total of the season.

sure to point out Zimmermann's contri-

butions, even with his three first
half fouls.
"[Zimmermann] came out and
gave us a big lift," Dawkins said. "1
felt good with Zimmermann in the
game, and I knew he understood
how to play with three fouls. I
knew he wouldn't go out there and
pick up another one quick, and
that's the trust you have to have in
a player, especially a senior."
Cal couldn't be counted out,

however, as the Golden Bears
took advantage of Stanford's 12
first-half fouls. Senior forward
Harper Kamp, also playing his
final regular season game, scored
nine of his 19 points in the final
eight minutes of the half and sunk
five free throws as Cal closed the
gap to single-digits, 39-34, at the
break.
A three-pointer from sopho
more guard Allen Crabbe cut the
Stanford lead to two to start the
half. Crabbe, Cal's leading scorer,
had a game-high 20 points, with 13
coming in the second half.
Stanford, however, refused to
give up any ground, going on a 9-2
run to keep the momentum on the
Cardinal side and hold onto its ad
vantage into the final minutes. The
Golden Bears struck back time
and time again, finally cutting the
Cardinal lead to 72-70 with 1:11 to
go-
With the game on the line and
42 seconds remaining, sophomore
guard Aaron Bright put it on him
self to win the game for the Cardi
nal. After he was fouled, Bright hit
the first free throw but missed the

second. The 5-foot-ll guard may
have been the smallest guy on the
court, but he was not intimidated,
grabbing the offensive rebound of
his own shot and drawing another
foul.
Bright again hit the first and
missed the second to make it 74-
70, but yet again, he was able to
collect the offensive rebound. He
would be fouled and hit one more
free throw to stretch the Stanford
lead to five and seal the game for
the Cardinal.
Stanford was outrebounded
for one of the only times all year,
but made up for it with one of the
squad's best shooting performanc
es of the season. The team shot
46.7 percent from the field and
44.4 percent from behind the arc
to best the Golden Bears, whose
24-for-59 afternoon fell short of
Cal's conference-leading clip of
48.1 percent.
Stanford has now won four of
its last six games with the two loss
es being a one-point heartbreaker
at Utah and a four-point loss
against Oregon in which the Car
dinal led for the first 37 minutes.
Momentum is key for Stanford
heading into the Pac-12 tourna
ment this week, as the Cardinal's
poor middle of the season has left
it with no chance of receiving an
at-large bid to the Big Dance,
"We know that we have to win
the tournament [to make the
NCAA tournament]," Zimmer
mann said. "We're playing with
nothing to lose and that's always a
great feeling, because some of the
other teams might be a little
tighter."
As the 7th seed in the tourna
ment, Stanford will face Arizona
State (10-20, 6-12) in the first
round. The Cardinal played the
Sun Devils earlier in the year and
demolished them, winning 68-44.
A victory against Arizona State
would give Stanford a rematch
with Cal in the second round.
Dawkins feels optimistic about
the Cardinal's chances.
"There are a number of teams
that have a chance at winning the
Pac-12 tournament," he said. "It
starts with believing, first of all,
and it starts with going out there
and executing."
After last night's victory, Stan
ford definitely believes it can pull
off a Cinderella story and make it
to March Madness. All that's left
to do is execute.

We know we
have to win the
[Pac-12]
tournament.
— ANDREW
ZIMMERMANN,
senior forward
In Stanford's biggest game of the sea
son Sunday, the Cardinal was able to beat
rival Cal and deny the Golden Bears a
share of the Pac-12 regular season title.
The victory secured Stanford's first 20-
win season since 2007-08 and gave the
squad plenty of momentum going into the
season-ending conference tournament.
The Cardinal (20-10, 10-8 Pac-12)
came into the game knowing that, win or
lose, it would finish the regular season sev
enth in the Pac-12. Cal (23-8,13-5), how
ever, had the regular season conference
title on the line and was sure to come out
fighting. Stanford was determined to ruin
this for the Golden Bears, as well as pro
vide a great end to the season in front of
an energetic home crowd on Senior Night.
The Cardinal came out hard, roaring to
a 17-7 lead eight minutes into the game. As
usual, the catalyst for the offense was
freshman guard Chasson Randle, who
scored eight early points and finished with
a team-high 17.
Despite Stanford's offensive push, the
game got off to a chippy start with two
early technical fouls called on an ex
change between Cal guard Justin Cobbs
and Stanford senior guard Jarrett Mann in
the first three minutes. The two squads
would eventually combine for 40 fouls,
though the Maples Pavilion crowd was au
dibly upset with many calls the Golden
Bears only had seven fouls to Stanford's
19 at one point in the second half.
Stanford took one of its largest leads of
the game, 14 points, at the 7:30 mark due
to a rare three from senior Andrew Zim
mermann. The forward was definitely de
termined to take advantage of his final
home regular-season game, scoring a sea
son-high 13 points while playing his high
est minutes total of the season.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins made
sure to point out Zimmermann's contri-

Senior forward Andrew Zimmermann (center) had one of the best games of his Stanford career in

title and will provide the Card with momentum going into the Pac- 12 tournament.
butions, even with his three first
half fouls.
"[Zimmermann] came out and
gave us a big lift," Dawkins said. "1
felt good with Zimmermann in the
game, and I knew he understood
how to play with three fouls. I
knew he wouldn't go out there and
pick up another one quick, and
that's the trust you have to have in
a player, especially a senior."
Cal couldn't be counted out,

however, as the Golden Bears
took advantage of Stanford's 12
first-half fouls. Senior forward
Harper Kamp, also playing his
final regular season game, scored
nine of his 19 points in the final
eight minutes of the half and sunk
five free throws as Cal closed the
gap to single-digits, 39-34, at the
break.
A three-pointer from sopho
more guard Allen Crabbe cut the
Stanford lead to two to start the
half. Crabbe, Cal's leading scorer,
had a game-high 20 points, with 13
coming in the second half.
Stanford, however, refused to
give up any ground, going on a 9-2
run to keep the momentum on the
Cardinal side and hold onto its ad
vantage into the final minutes. The
Golden Bears struck back time
and time again, finally cutting the
Cardinal lead to 72-70 with 1:11 to
go-
With the game on the line and
42 seconds remaining, sophomore
guard Aaron Bright put it on him
self to win the game for the Cardi
nal. After he was fouled, Bright hit
the first free throw but missed the

second. The 5-foot-ll guard may
have been the smallest guy on the
court, but he was not intimidated,
grabbing the offensive rebound of
his own shot and drawing another
foul.
Bright again hit the first and
missed the second to make it 74-
70, but yet again, he was able to
collect the offensive rebound. He
would be fouled and hit one more
free throw to stretch the Stanford
lead to five and seal the game for
the Cardinal.
Stanford was outrebounded
for one of the only times all year,
but made up for it with one of the
squad's best shooting performanc
es of the season. The team shot
46.7 percent from the field and
44.4 percent from behind the arc
to best the Golden Bears, whose
24-for-59 afternoon fell short of
Cal's conference-leading clip of
48.1 percent.
Stanford has now won four of
its last six games with the two loss
es being a one-point heartbreaker
at Utah and a four-point loss
against Oregon in which the Car
dinal led for the first 37 minutes.
Momentum is key for Stanford
heading into the Pac-12 tourna
ment this week, as the Cardinal's
poor middle of the season has left
it with no chance of receiving an
at-large bid to the Big Dance,
"We know that we have to win
the tournament [to make the
NCAA tournament]," Zimmer
mann said. "We're playing with
nothing to lose and that's always a
great feeling, because some of the
other teams might be a little
tighter."
As the 7th seed in the tourna
ment, Stanford will face Arizona
State (10-20, 6-12) in the first
round. The Cardinal played the
