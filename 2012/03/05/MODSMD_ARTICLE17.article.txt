## BEARS BUMPED OFF CAL DENIED PAC- 12 TITLE 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
In Stanford's biggest game of the sea
son Sunday, the Cardinal was able to beat
rival Cal and deny the Golden Bears a
share of the Pac-12 regular season title.
The victory secured Stanford's first 20-
win season since 2007-08 and gave the
squad plenty of momentum going into the
season-ending conference tournament.
The Cardinal (20-10, 10-8 Pac-12)
came into the game knowing that, win or
lose, it would finish the regular season sev
enth in the Pac-12. Cal (23-8,13-5), how
ever, had the regular season conference
title on the line and was sure to come out
fighting. Stanford was determined to ruin
this for the Golden Bears, as well as pro

an energetic home crowd on Senior Night.
The Cardinal came out hard, roaring to
a 17-7 lead eight minutes into the game. As
usual, the catalyst for the offense was
freshman guard Chasson Randle, who
scored eight early points and finished with
a team-high 17.
Despite Stanford's offensive push, the
game got off to a chippy start with two
early technical fouls called on an ex
change between Cal guard Justin Cobbs
and Stanford senior guard Jarrett Mann in
the first three minutes. The two squads
would eventually combine for 40 fouls,
though the Maples Pavilion crowd was au
dibly upset with many calls the Golden
Bears only had seven fouls to Stanford's
19 at one point in the second half.
Stanford took one of its largest leads of
the game, 14 points, at the 7:30 mark due
to a rare three from senior Andrew Zim
mermann. The forward was definitely de
termined to take advantage of his final
home regular-season game, scoring a sea
son-high 13 points while playing his high
est minutes total of the season.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins made
sure to point out Zimmermann's contri-

his last regular season contest Sunday. Stanford's upset stopped Cal from earning a share of the Pac- 12
