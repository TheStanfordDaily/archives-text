## Card drops its first but takes series 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford baseball team dropped
its first decision of the season in last Friday's
series opener against Fresno State, but
bounced back with two decisive wins to grab
its third straight series win.
Sophomore first baseman Brian Ragira
and junior third baseman Stephen Piscotty
continued to set the tone for Stanford (10-1)
at the plate, combining for seven RBIs and 12
hits over the weekend. Despite junior

righthander Mark Appel's first loss of the
season to begin the road trip, Saturday starter
Brett Mooneyham and Sunday starter John
Hochstatter clamped down, allowing two
total runs over their 12.1 innings of work in
the final two games of the series. No batter for
the Bulldogs (5-7) had more than four hits on
the weekend, and the Cardinal earned its sec
ond shutout of the season on Saturday to go
along with a 16-0 offensive onslaught.
The Cardinal lost its first game of the sea
son on Friday, falling 7-4 thanks to a four-run
Bulldog sixth inning just the second four

spot laid on Stanford all year. Appel (2-1) had
his third career complete game for Stanford
and set a career high in strikeouts for the sec
ond straight weekend, but eight Fresno State
hits and a pair of home runs from Bulldog
centerfielder Aaron Judge outweighed
Appel's 11 punchouts.
Down 2-0 in the top of the third after a
two-run shot from the Bulldog sophomore,
Stanford tied the game on a two-run double
from Ragira. Judge hit a solo homer in the
fourth to put Fresno State ahead
again, but the Cardinal responded
in the top of the fifth on a Piscotty
double that made it 4-3.
Things unraveled in the sixth,
however, and five hits by the Bull
dogs put Stanford in the hole. No
Cardinal player had a multi-hit
night, and juniors Tyler Gaffney
and Kenny Diekroeger each strik
ing out twice at the heart of the
lineup.
After their disappearing act on
Friday, Stanford's bats were back
in time for the late Saturday start.
The squad put up a seven-run
beating on Fresno State starter
Cody Kendall in his one-plus in
nings of work and never stopped
hitting en route to a 16-0 win. Ten
Cardinal batters including
eight of nine starters had base

hits as part of the team's third
double-digit victory in as many
weekends this season.
Meanwhile, Mooneyham's
homecoming to the Fresno area
was spectacular, as the redshirt
junior lefthander took a no-hitter
into the sixth and struck out 13
Bulldog batters, matching his ca
reer-best, to move to 3-0 on the
season.
Ragira and Diekroeger made it
3-0 in the first inning with RBI hits,
and junior centerfielder Jake Stew
art added a three-run homer in the
top of the second to blow open the
scoring. Gaffney and Piscotty fol
lowed with back-to-back doubles
to tack on another run and chase
Kendall, before junior catcher Eric
Smith hit a home run of his own
this one a solo shot in the third.

After being held off the board
in the fourth, the Cardinal batted
around in a six-run fifth inning to
increase its lead to 14, highlighted
by a two-RBI double by Smith
rand Diekroeger's second two
bagger of the evening.
Sophomore rightfielder Austin
Wilson hit another solo shot for
Stanford in the sixth, and fresh
man catcher Wayne Taylor had his
first career RBI on a ninth-inning
double to cap the scoring at 16-0.
The Cardinal rode its offensive
momentum into the rubber game,
greeting Bulldog lefthander Tom
Harlan with a four-run opening
frame. Stewart and Gaffney led
off the afternoon with singles and
were brought home by a Ragira
fielder's choice and a Diekroeger
double. The first of two RBI sin
gles from sophomore shortstop
Lonnie Kauppila and a Wilson
fielder's choice made it 4-0 to end
the first.
A fourth-inning error by Fres
no State extended the lead to 5-0,
but Stanford already had all the
offense it needed as Hochstatter
clamped down in his second ca
reer start. His only two earned
runs came at the end of his six-hit
outing in the bottom of the sixth
inning. The freshman from
Danville, Calif, scattered just
three hits over the first five
frames.
A two-out rally by Stanford in
the top of the seventh made it 9-2
with Kauppila singling home a
run, Wilson doubling home anoth
er and Smith adding two more
with his only hit of the afternoon.
Junior righthander Dean
McArdle cleaned things up yet
again for the Cardinal, getting out
of the sixth before the Bulldogs
could do too much damage and al
lowing just one hit in his 2.2 in
nings of relief. Freshman closer
David Schmidt wrapped the
weekend up with a near-perfect
ninth inning, giving up just one
baserunner on a walk.
Stanford wraps up its noncon
ference stretch this week, travel
ing to St. Mary's on Tuesday at 2
p.m. and then hosting No. 4 Rice
on the weekend at Sunken Dia
mond. Rice also came into this
weekend undefeated before
falling to Texas on Friday, but
bounced back with two strong
wins to improve to 11-1.
