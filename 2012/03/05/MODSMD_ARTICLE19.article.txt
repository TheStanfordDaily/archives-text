# CAL NOT EVEN CLOSE
## 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Stanford
women's basketball team de
feated archrival Cal 86-61 in the
harsh atmosphere of the Haas
Pavilion in Berkeley.
With the win, No. 2 Stanford
(28-1, 18-0 Pac-12) finished off
its third straight unbeaten con
ference season, with its last such
loss coming in the 2008-09 sea
son against the Golden Bears.
Though on the losing end last
night, Cal (22-8,13-5 Pac-12) has
already secured the No. 2 seed in
the Pac-12 tournament that will
take place this week in Los An
geles. Should both teams live up
to expectations in the confer
ence tournament, last night's
game might not be the final time
that they square off against each
other this year or even this
week.
Four Cardinal players scored
in double figures. Sophomore
guard Toni Kokenis narrowly
beat senior forward Nnemkadi
Ogwumike for the team lead in
points with 23 and 22, respec
tively. Sophomore forward
Chiney Ogwumike took home
another double-double with 12
points and 12 rebounds. Addi
tionally, both Kokenis and fresh
man forward Bonnie Samuelson
hit three shots from behind the
arc, while junior forward Joslyn
Tinkle had two threes as part of
her 16-point haul. Just two Gold
en Bears made it into double fig

ures and their leading point
scorers were kept below their
season averages, including fresh
man forward Reshanda Gray,
who fouled out of the game.
Though Stanford won the tip
off, Nneka Ogwumike missed on
her first jumper, and by the end
of the opening minute, the Gold
en Bears held a 4-0 lead. In the
next three and a half minutes,
though, Cal missed four shots,
turned the ball over three times
and conceded two fouls, handing
a 7-4 advantage to the Cardinal.
Any chance that early lead may
have given Cal to turn the tables
on the Pac-12 champion had
been lost as Stanford hit its
stride, and by the half, the visi
tors held a comfortable 43-24
lead.
"It's hard to credit Stanford
enough," said Cal head coach
Lindsay Gottlieb after the game.
"They're really good. I really
think that Chiney and Nneka
might be the best post combina
tion to ever play in women's col
lege basketball. And I thought
their supporting cast played re
ally, really well, and I thought
they played very, very hard,
made life difficult for us."
Gottlieb's biggest concern at
half, though, was her own team's
poor cooperation on the floor.
Berkeley went into the break
with an assist-to-turnover ratio of
just 0.33, compared to Stanford's
2.00. Worse still, the Golden

Sophomore guard Toni Kokenis had 23 points for Stanford, fueling a
dominant first half for the Cardinal that left the squad up 19 at the break.
Kokenis contributed three treys to the squad's 8-20 perimeter clip.
Bears had only scored four points
from the four turnovers made by
the Cardinal, whereas Stanford
had notched up 19 from the nine
turnovers made by its cross-Bay ri
vals.
The last time these two teams
played each other, back on Jan. 28
on the Farm, California pulled
back from a nine-point deficit at
the end of the first period to force
overtime before ultimately
falling 74-71. This time around,
though, there was no fairytale
comeback in regulation. The
Golden Bears were better after
the break, making just three

more turnovers and adding seven
assists to bring their ratio up to a
more respectable 0.83, but the
gap was just too large and Stan
ford ultimately too good.
Cal only narrowly lost out on
points to the Cardinal through
the second half, forcing eight
turnovers and making nine steals,
but this came in part from Stan
ford's freer approach to the sec
ond half. The squad dazzled the
crowd with gutsy plays that didn't
always work out, but highlighted
the team's potential when suc
cessful.
"We really tried to be aggres
sive," Chiney Ogwumike ex
plained. "We collectively all
looked to score and I think that
shows how much we've been
practicing and working on our of
fense. Our team is gelling, and

we're working hard, and it's the
time where you either get with it
or you sort of give up."
Older sister Nneka put a
slightly different spin on things as
her collegiate career heads into its
final postseason.
"I think at this point in time
people really need to buy into
having fun out and being out
there and just playing for each
other for 40 minutes," she said.
"Because if you have fun, there's
really no stress."
Both Stanford and California
will be back in action this Thurs
day at the Galen Center in Los
Angeles against the winners of
Washington/Oregon and
Utah/Colorado, respectively.
