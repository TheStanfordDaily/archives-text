"Television trumps newsprint,
Twitter has trumped the press re
lease [and] the blog post outpaces
the first broadcast news," said John
Githongo, CEO of Inuka Kenya
Trust and former Permanent Sec
retary for Government and Ethics
to the President of Kenya, to inter
national innovators and Stanford
students in Cubberley Auditorium
Saturday.

Githongo delivered the
keynote address for the Stanford
Association for International De
velopment (SAID) conference on
"Rethinking Reform: Innovations
in Improving Governance."
Karl Eikenberry, former United
States Ambassador to Afghanistan,

remarks of the conference but

Former Senior Special Assistant to the President of Nigeria Hajia Amina
Mohammed Az-Zubair (right) spoke Saturday on a panel at the Stanford
Association for International Development's annual conference.
of the program on social entrepre
neurship at the Freeman Spogli In
stitute for International Studies
(FSI), replaced him.
The SAID Conference, organ
ized in conjunction with FSI, is the
association's capstone event. Ac
cording to conference director
Colin Casey 'l2, the conference
seeks to address "some of the most
pressing and intractable dialogues
today."
"[The] conference is predicat
ed on the idea that there is still a
long way to go in improving gov
ernance," he said. "We hope to en
gage the most salient debates in
the field."
"We bring speakers from
across the gamut, but they all
share the same conviction that
government needs to be im
proved," said Casey's fellow con
ference director Jonah Rexer 'l2.
Githongo discussed the impli

cations of a new digital world on
governance in his keynote ad
dress.
"Leaders need to learn differ
ent language and social media,"
he said.
But Githongo also noted that
the digital age may harm gover
nance as much as it helps, through
digital media's potential to
strengthen human trafficking and
money laundering networks.
He said that the ultimate chal
lenge to developing countries
today is reconciling the "hardware
of democracy," such as education
and poverty, with the "software of
democracy," such as freedom of
speech and accountability. Githon
go said that if this balance cannot
be achieved, the system crashes.
"Equality has replaced simple
measures of poverty as the greatest
challenge facing the world today,"
he said.
"Countries are forced to inno
vate from poverty," Githongo
added. "Digital technology has al
lowed countries in the third world
to go from the third world to the
first world."

He cited Nigeria as an example
of a country where the people ac
complish a great deal through the
use of mobile phones.
In her closing remarks, Ramdas
reemphasized the issues Githongo
raised and accentuated the impor
tance of "being in a conversation
that is inclusive" when discussing
issues such as transparency and ac
countability in government.

Ramdas said that improving
governance is as much a top-down
as a bottom-up approach because
both government and citizens must
apply effort equally.
The conference also featured
four different panels: Transparency
and Accountability in Fighting
Corruption, Technological Innova
tion and Governance, Governance
at the Grassroots and Leadership
and State Capacity.
"The panels went really well,"
said Larry Diamond, director of
the Center on Democracy, Devel
opment, and the Rule of Law, and
moderator for the panel on Trans
parency and Accountability. "We
were not only exposed to the inten
sity and scope of the problem, but
positive things that are happening
and very practical initiatives that
governments are adopting to im
prove the quality of government."
Ramdas, who also moderated
the panel on Technological Innova
tion and Governance, noted the
honesty with which speakers ad
dressed the issue, from admitting
the relative failure of some World
Bank initiatives to openly dis

cussing controversial government
reforms.
Robert Klitgaard, professor at
the Claremont Graduate Universi
ty, discussed two specific innova
tions in reform during the Trans
parency and Accountability in
Fighting Corruption panel: a Peru
vian non-governmental organiza
tion called Ciudadanos al Dla that
researches good governance and
awards local governments for suc
cessfully implementing transpar
ent practices and an Indian website
called ipaidabribe.com, where citi
zens can report and complain
about corrupt government.
Past SAID conference topics
have included innovations in de
velopment and post-conflict global
health issues.
Next year's SAID conference
theme has yet to be decided.
"I couldn't have asked for it to
go more smoothly," Rexer said of
the event. "We came up with some
productive insights and actionable
changes."
