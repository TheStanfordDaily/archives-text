# Maples rocking yet again
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
For the first time in sever
al years, Maples Pavilion
on Sunday resembled
the Maples Pavilion of
old as the Stanford men's
basketball team held off archrival
Cal on Senior Day.
Sure, this wasn't anywhere near
undefeated Stanford stunning Ari
zona on The Shot, nor was it even a
game with national implications.
But considering where this pro
gram has been for the past few
years, a tough win over the best
team in the conference in the final
game of the regular season was still
a momentous achievement.
The Cardinal's win was even
more impressive considering the
team had to play most of the contest
5-on-8. Despite playing at home,
Stanford couldn't catch a break
from the officials, and to say that the
calls were questionable is a drastic
understatement. There were 24
fouls called on Stanford compared
to 16 on the Golden Bears, and
three of those fouls came in Cal's
desperation mode in the final
minute.
But the sheer numbers don't tell
the full story. There were charges
called as blocks, blocks called as
charges and several phantom fouls
that the players themselves didn't
seem to understand. The Cardinal's
starting frontcourt of seniors Josh
Owens and Andrew Zimmermann
was in foul trouble early and at least
half the calls were perplexing. On
the other hand, the Bears had al
most no foul issues, particularly in
the second half
As frustrating as the officiating
was, the response from the Maples
crowd was encouraging. Despite
the presence of a substantial Cal
contingent, the crowd responded to
the questionable calls by raining
boos louder than I've heard in my
four years on the Farm.
I've been fairly disappointed
with Stanford men's basketball in
my time here because this program
has been underachieving for years. I
haven't been convinced that John
ny Dawkins is necessarily the right
coach to lead the Cardinal, and one
game hasn't changed that. But for
40 minutes, you could see the po
tential of this squad, and as the team
improves, maybe the fan base will
as well.
Back when I started watching
Stanford basketball as a kid,
Maples Pavilion was known as one
of the tougher environments for
opposing teams to enter, and Sixth
Man was among the nation's most
intimidating student sections. Go
back and check out The Shot on
You Tube. Look how insane that at
mosphere was. Heck, Tiger Woods
was celebrating right there with the
students.
These days, Sixth Man has had
to lower its price from cheap to re
ally cheap to free to the current
state of needing to bribe students
with raffles and prizes just to get
them to come to the arena. There
was a time when people with no in
terest in basketball would come out
to Maples just to be a part of the at
mosphere. Now, plenty of basket
ball fans skip games to watch others
on television.
Sunday's game wasn't quite like
the old days, but it was a start.
Maples was near capacity, and the
place was rocking from the get-go.
Yes, some of the noise came from
the Cal section (which still feels the
need to yell lame cheers during the
national anthem), but that only
helped spark the Stanford faithful
into even more raucousness.
Of course, it all comes back to
the team. On a campus with world
class athletes in virtually every
sport, where multiple other top-five
teams also play home games at
Maples Pavilion, the fan support
will always struggle if the team isn't
competitive.
And that is exactly why Sun
day's win was so encouraging. The
Cardinal's 20th win of the season
didn't get close to putting Stanford
in NCAA tournament contention,
but it did give the team some much
needed momentum before this
week's Pac-12 tournament.
Zimmermann played perhaps
his most inspired game in his final
home game, and the Cardinal back
court of freshman Chasson Randle,
sophomore Anthony Brown and

sophomore Aaron Bright com
bined for 39 important points to
make up for a subpar game from
Owens, the team's second-leading
scorer. Fellow seniors Jarrett
Mann and Jack Trotter had high
lights of their own, as each had a
crowd-thrilling dunk to keep the
momentum on Stanford's side.
And, oh yeah, it stopped the
Cardinal's biggest rival from win
ning a share of the conference
title.
Moving forward, the team's
short-term and long-term paths are
very much up in the air. This win
showed that the Cardinal has the

ability to beat any team in the con
ference, but last week in Utah, the
team showed it can lose to any
team in the conference as well. The
Pac-12 is wide open, and Stanford
has a legitimate shot at contending
for the title, but also has a similarly
legitimate shot at losing to Arizona
State on Wednesday.
The future is unknown, but Sun
day could be a good start to getting
Stanford men's basketball where it
once was.

Jacob Jaffe almost slipped on a ref
eree's uniform for the second half
to help call the game, but recent
Pac-12 football history convinced
him otherwise. Suggest a classier
