## Klahn and Thacher take home Pacific Coast Doubles crown 
### Joseph Beyda 
Seniors Bradley Klahn and Ryan
Thacher repeated as Pacific Coast Doubles
champions on Sunday in La Jolla, Calif.,
fending off the independent duo of Kris
Kwinta and John Peers in a tight 6-4, 6-4
match.
After winning the same title last March,
Klahn and Thacher are now the first dou
bles team to win the Pacific Coast crown in
back-to-back seasons in over 20 years. The
last pair to do so was former Stanford All-

Grand Slam titles after reaching the 1991
NCAA Doubles final together and taking
home the 1990 team national title,
Klahn and Thacher breezed through
their early matches, dropping just four
games in the first two rounds. They stormed
past Peter Lucassen and Jaak Poldma of
Pac-12 rival and three-time defending
NCAA champion USC in the fourth round
before getting past a duo from Cal 6-4,6-1 in
the quarterfinals.
On Sunday, Klahn and Thacher beat Se
bastian Fanselow and Jenson Turner of Pep
perdine 6-2,7-6 (3) in their semifinal match
before moving on to the finals.
Stanford freshmen John Morrissey and
Robert Stineman also participated in the
tournament, falling in the third round to the
UCLA duo of Dennis Mkrtchian and
Maxime Tabatruong.
