# CARD ROLLS IN PAC- 12 OPENERS
## 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
With a weekend spent more in transit than on the
courts, the No. 11 Cardinal continued to cruise as it
flew by No. 7 Cal (6-4) on Friday with a 5-2 beating
and finished off business at No. 28 Washington on
Sunday with a 6-1 victory.
Stanford (8-0, 2-0 Pac-12) showed strength in
doubles play, as the Cardinal went six for six this
weekend in doubles matches. In fact, it has yet to
drop a doubles match thus far in the regular season,
as junior Mallory Burdette who plays on court
one with sophomore Nicole Gibbs pointed out.
"We've been working a lot on doubles in practice,
and it's definitely showing in our matches," Burdette
acknowledged. "It has to do with chemistry, and I
think all three courts have it this year."
Stanford captured the first point in the Cal match
with three doubles victories, though the Cardinal
was only up a break on courts two and three.
"Doubles is about instinctive play," Burdette said.
"With Nicole, I have to be able to read when she hits

a good shot or a weaker shot. I have to know when to
move back or when to attack. I think we're continu
ally improving."
She also described how freshman Ellen Tsay and
junior Stacey Tan make a formidable pair on court
two, with Tan bringing the big groundstrokes and
Tsay right there on top of the net to finish the point.
Similarly, sophomore Kristie Ahn and senior Veron
ica Li complement each other as they both move
around well at the net.
In singles play, Tan lost the first match to Cal's
Anett Schutting 6-3, 6-3, evening the score at 1-1.
Gibbs quickly launched the Cardinal ahead again
with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Zsofi Susanyi. Li, Burdette
and Tsay also came out triumphant, as Ahn fell in
straight sets to Annie Goransson.
Burdette fought hard to pull out a three-set
tiebreaker win over Cal's Taylor Davis. Although Cal
was ranked above Stanford going into the weekend,
the Cardinal's hard-fought victory was more impor
tant for helping to boost the squad's confidence than
moving past the Golden Bears in the ITA rankings.
"I knew going into the match that we might be a
little rusty," Burdette said. "So I was trying to keep
my cool out there. [Davis] was doing a good job of
getting my big shots back, so it was about executing
and putting short balls away."
In the heat of such a close match, Burdette said
she had to concentrate her emotions in order to play
her best.
"I think at times I can show too much emotion,"
she admitted. "Now, I have routines that I do in be
tween points to keep me in the moment and focused
on the things that I can control. It's important to go
up to the line with the same energy and mentality
every time."
Burdette's composure paid off in the Washington
match as well, as she defeated Andjela Nemcevic 6-
1, 6-4 on Sunday. Stanford had already taken the
doubles point with victories on every court and con
tinued to roll with wins from Gibbs, Tan, Tsay and Li.
Junior Natalie Dillon lost to Riko Shimizo after a
very close first set. Tsay also was forced to fight back
after dropping the first set and came back to win in a
tiebreaker, 4-6,6-4 (10-7).
"The 6-1 score doesn't reflect what went on in the
match," Burdette noted. "It got really tight in the
middle of the match, and the courts were split so that
you couldn't see how everyone else was doing. We
were all happy with the way it turned out."
Stanford continues their travels this weekend to
the Pac-12's newest competitors, Colorado and
Utah. Like at Washington, the Cardinal will be play
ing indoors.
"We've been hearing a lot about their conditions
and facilities," Burdette explained. "Our court sur
faces at Stanford are lightning fast and might even be
faster than the indoor courts, so no matter the
change, it shouldn't be too big of a deal."
Stanford will be looking to capture its ninth win at
12:30 p.m. this Friday, March 9, against No. 33 Utah.

Junior Mallory Burdette was one of several undefeated
Cardinal players this weekend, as she eked out a
three-set win over Cal's Taylor Davis before beating
Washington's Andjela Nemcevic 6-1, 6-4 on Sunday.
With a weekend spent more in transit than on the
courts, the No. 11 Cardinal continued to cruise as it
flew by No. 7 Cal (6-4) on Friday with a 5-2 beating
and finished off business at No. 28 Washington on
Sunday with a 6-1 victory.
Stanford (8-0, 2-0 Pac-12) showed strength in
doubles play, as the Cardinal went six for six this
weekend in doubles matches. In fact, it has yet to
drop a doubles match thus far in the regular season,
as junior Mallory Burdette who plays on court
one with sophomore Nicole Gibbs pointed out.
"We've been working a lot on doubles in practice,
and it's definitely showing in our matches," Burdette
acknowledged. "It has to do with chemistry, and I
think all three courts have it this year."
Stanford captured the first point in the Cal match
with three doubles victories, though the Cardinal
was only up a break on courts two and three.
"Doubles is about instinctive play," Burdette said.
"With Nicole, I have to be able to read when she hits

a good shot or a weaker shot. I have to know when to
move back or when to attack. I think we're continu
ally improving."
She also described how freshman Ellen Tsay and
junior Stacey Tan make a formidable pair on court
two, with Tan bringing the big groundstrokes and
Tsay right there on top of the net to finish the point.
Similarly, sophomore Kristie Ahn and senior Veron
ica Li complement each other as they both move
around well at the net.
In singles play, Tan lost the first match to Cal's
Anett Schutting 6-3, 6-3, evening the score at 1-1.
Gibbs quickly launched the Cardinal ahead again
with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Zsofi Susanyi. Li, Burdette
and Tsay also came out triumphant, as Ahn fell in
straight sets to Annie Goransson.
Burdette fought hard to pull out a three-set
tiebreaker win over Cal's Taylor Davis. Although Cal
was ranked above Stanford going into the weekend,
the Cardinal's hard-fought victory was more impor
tant for helping to boost the squad's confidence than
moving past the Golden Bears in the ITA rankings.
"I knew going into the match that we might be a
little rusty," Burdette said. "So I was trying to keep
my cool out there. [Davis] was doing a good job of
getting my big shots back, so it was about executing
and putting short balls away."
In the heat of such a close match, Burdette said
she had to concentrate her emotions in order to play
her best.
"I think at times I can show too much emotion,"
she admitted. "Now, I have routines that I do in be
tween points to keep me in the moment and focused
on the things that I can control. It's important to go
up to the line with the same energy and mentality
every time."
Burdette's composure paid off in the Washington
match as well, as she defeated Andjela Nemcevic 6-
1, 6-4 on Sunday. Stanford had already taken the
doubles point with victories on every court and con
tinued to roll with wins from Gibbs, Tan, Tsay and Li.
Junior Natalie Dillon lost to Riko Shimizo after a
very close first set. Tsay also was forced to fight back
after dropping the first set and came back to win in a
tiebreaker, 4-6,6-4 (10-7).
"The 6-1 score doesn't reflect what went on in the
match," Burdette noted. "It got really tight in the
middle of the match, and the courts were split so that
you couldn't see how everyone else was doing. We
were all happy with the way it turned out."
Stanford continues their travels this weekend to
the Pac-12's newest competitors, Colorado and
Utah. Like at Washington, the Cardinal will be play
ing indoors.
"We've been hearing a lot about their conditions
and facilities," Burdette explained. "Our court sur
faces at Stanford are lightning fast and might even be
faster than the indoor courts, so no matter the
change, it shouldn't be too big of a deal."
Stanford will be looking to capture its ninth win at
12:30 p.m. this Friday, March 9, against No. 33 Utah.
