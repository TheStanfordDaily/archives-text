## Federalist Society's annual event returns to the Farm 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Law School
Chapter of the Federalist Society
hosted a student symposium this
past weekend to discuss and de
bate "Bureaucracy Unbound:
Can Limited Government and
the Administrative State Co-
Exist?" Around 500 law students
from across the nation witnessed
lively debates and presentations
in Cemex Auditorium on March
2 and 3.
Twenty-five prominent legal
scholars, practitioners and offi
cials from across the nation, in
cluding five judges and Larry
Kramer, dean of Stanford Law
School, led the discussions. U.S.
Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah), a
member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, presented the
keynote address at a banquet for
400 people Saturday night at the
Arrillaga Alumni Center.
Students from a range of top

law schools, including Harvard,
Yale, the University of Chicago,
Columbia University and the
University of Texas at Austin, at
tended the 31st annual confer
ence, which had not been held at
Stanford since 1996.
Kramer said that one of the
goals of the event was to "bring
top lawyers and scholars from all
sides of the issues to debate."
Conference co-chair Ilan
Wurman J.D. 'l3 echoed
Kramer's sentiments, saying,
"there was no answer in one par
ticular direction [to the main
question of the symposium] be
cause we had a strong balance of
liberal and conservative views on
each panel."
"The conservative panelists
tended to answer that the admin
istrative state needs to be dimin
ished dramatically if it can coex
ist with principles of limited gov
ernment," Wurman said.
Friday evening's panel dis
cussing the "Rule of Law and the
Administrative State," was mod

erated by the Honorable Carlos
Bea '56, J.D. '5B, who currently
serves on the U.S. Court of Ap
peals for the Ninth Circuit. In
light of the plurality of voices,
there were disagreements among
the panelists regarding the defi
nition of the rule of law, a term
the speakers pointed out as orig
inating from Aristotle and
Locke. Panelists included Har
vard Law School Professor
David Barron, NYU Law School
Professor Richard Epstein, Ohio
State University Law School
Professor Peter Shane and the
Honorable Brett Kavanaugh, a
judge on the U.S. Court of Ap
peals for the D.C. Circuit.
Panelists discussed whether
the modern conditions of life and
governmental administration re
quire some redefinition of the
rule of law. The opaque constitu
tional underpinnings of a regula
tory state were hotly contested.
According to Wurman, the
