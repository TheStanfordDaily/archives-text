## Federalist Society's annual event returns to the Farm 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Law School
Chapter of the Federalist Society
hosted a student symposium this
past weekend to discuss and de
bate "Bureaucracy Unbound:
Can Limited Government and
the Administrative State Co-
Exist?" Around 500 law students
from across the nation witnessed
lively debates and presentations
in Cemex Auditorium on March
2 and 3.
Twenty-five prominent legal
scholars, practitioners and offi
cials from across the nation, in
cluding five judges and Larry
Kramer, dean of Stanford Law
School, led the discussions. U.S.
Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah), a
member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, presented the
keynote address at a banquet for
400 people Saturday night at the
Arrillaga Alumni Center.
Students from a range of top

law schools, including Harvard,
Yale, the University of Chicago,
Columbia University and the
University of Texas at Austin, at
tended the 31st annual confer
ence, which had not been held at
Stanford since 1996.
Kramer said that one of the
goals of the event was to "bring
top lawyers and scholars from all
sides of the issues to debate."
Conference co-chair Ilan
Wurman J.D. 'l3 echoed
Kramer's sentiments, saying,
"there was no answer in one par
ticular direction [to the main
question of the symposium] be
cause we had a strong balance of
liberal and conservative views on
each panel."
"The conservative panelists
tended to answer that the admin
istrative state needs to be dimin
ished dramatically if it can coex
ist with principles of limited gov
ernment," Wurman said.
Friday evening's panel dis
cussing the "Rule of Law and the
Administrative State," was mod

erated by the Honorable Carlos
Bea '56, J.D. '5B, who currently
serves on the U.S. Court of Ap
peals for the Ninth Circuit. In
light of the plurality of voices,
there were disagreements among
the panelists regarding the defi
nition of the rule of law, a term
the speakers pointed out as orig
inating from Aristotle and
Locke. Panelists included Har
vard Law School Professor
David Barron, NYU Law School
Professor Richard Epstein, Ohio
State University Law School
Professor Peter Shane and the
Honorable Brett Kavanaugh, a
judge on the U.S. Court of Ap
peals for the D.C. Circuit.
Panelists discussed whether
the modern conditions of life and
governmental administration re
quire some redefinition of the
rule of law. The opaque constitu
tional underpinnings of a regula
tory state were hotly contested.
According to Wurman, the
debate about the administrative
state is crucial due to its om
nipresence in the United States.
"The framers created a gov
ernment that would enable self
government by channeling the
passions of the people but also
checking the ambition of the
rulers," Wurman said. He empha
sized that this "required a rule of
law and a separation of powers,
but the administrative state often
undermines these important prin
ciples."
Barron, who served as acting
Assistant Attorney General for
the Office of Legal Counsel in the
Department of Justice, said that
"as the world grew more com
plex, more delegation was needed
[to administrative rule-making]
as Congress could not delve into
everything."
He added that a question re
mains regarding how to "regular
ize and confine" the administra
tive side of U.S. government.
Some Federalist members refer
to the administrative state as "a
fourth branch of governance"
alongside the traditional three
branches of government.
Wurman emphasized how the
rule of law is undermined by the
inherent complexity of the legal
system. Referencing the panel

discussing "Congress v. Agencies:
Gridlock, Organized Interests
and Regulatory Capture," Wur
man said that "the most fascinat
ing part for me was Professor
Michael McConnell's illustra
tions of just how voluminous and
complex our modern laws are
such that not even lawmakers
know what they are reading."
Wurman noted that this recur
ring theme was re-emphasized by
Lee in his keynote speech.
Barron added that there has
been much "open-ended delega
tion [and growth in] the adminis
trative state since the New Deal."
"Congress makes rules, then
delegates," he said.

The panel on Technology and
Regulation included Pay Pal co
founder Peter Thiel 'B9, J.D. '92,
Stanford Law School Professor
Mark Lemley, Anthony Falzone
of the Stanford Center for Inter
net and Society and Ted Ullyot,
general counsel for Facebook.
Panelists explored the relation
ship between technology and the
administrative state. They consid
ered to what degree development
in technology has been slower
than anticipated in recent years
and whether the administrative
state has been an asset or a hin
drance to effective use of technol
ogy-
Thiel highlighted that the pace
of technological de velopment has
been "decelerating" for several
decades, but that the fields of fi
nance and computers have pro
vided exceptions. Thiel noted that
both "computers and finance
[have] been lightly regulated dur
ing the last 40 years."
"Rocket scientists went to Wall
Street because they weren't able
to build rockets," he commented.
The panelists, including Thiel,
urged extreme caution about reg
ulation in the computer industry.
The faster computer products are
changed and undated, "the harder
it is for government regulators to
follow," Thiel said.
"Cultivate, invest and get out
of the way," Falzone said.

David Barron, NYU Law School
Professor Richard Epstein, Ohio
State University Law School
Professor Peter Shane and the
Honorable Brett Kavanaugh, a
judge on the U.S. Court of Ap
peals for the D.C. Circuit.
Panelists discussed whether
the modern conditions of life and
governmental administration re
quire some redefinition of the
rule of law. The opaque constitu
tional underpinnings of a regula
tory state were hotly contested.
According to Wurman, the
debate about the administrative
state is crucial due to its om
nipresence in the United States.
"The framers created a gov
ernment that would enable self
government by channeling the
passions of the people but also
checking the ambition of the
rulers," Wurman said. He empha
sized that this "required a rule of
law and a separation of powers,
but the administrative state often
undermines these important prin
ciples."
Barron, who served as acting
Assistant Attorney General for
the Office of Legal Counsel in the
Department of Justice, said that
"as the world grew more com
plex, more delegation was needed
[to administrative rule-making]
as Congress could not delve into
everything."
He added that a question re
mains regarding how to "regular
ize and confine" the administra
tive side of U.S. government.
Some Federalist members refer
to the administrative state as "a
fourth branch of governance"
alongside the traditional three
branches of government.
Wurman emphasized how the
rule of law is undermined by the
inherent complexity of the legal
system. Referencing the panel

discussing "Congress v. Agencies:
Gridlock, Organized Interests
and Regulatory Capture," Wur
man said that "the most fascinat
ing part for me was Professor
Michael McConnell's illustra
tions of just how voluminous and
complex our modern laws are
such that not even lawmakers
know what they are reading."
Wurman noted that this recur
ring theme was re-emphasized by
Lee in his keynote speech.
Barron added that there has
been much "open-ended delega
tion [and growth in] the adminis
trative state since the New Deal."
"Congress makes rules, then
delegates," he said.

The panel on Technology and
Regulation included Pay Pal co
founder Peter Thiel 'B9, J.D. '92,
Stanford Law School Professor
Mark Lemley, Anthony Falzone
of the Stanford Center for Inter
net and Society and Ted Ullyot,
general counsel for Facebook.
Panelists explored the relation
ship between technology and the
administrative state. They consid
ered to what degree development
in technology has been slower
than anticipated in recent years
and whether the administrative
state has been an asset or a hin
drance to effective use of technol
ogy-
Thiel highlighted that the pace
of technological de velopment has
been "decelerating" for several
decades, but that the fields of fi
nance and computers have pro
vided exceptions. Thiel noted that
both "computers and finance
[have] been lightly regulated dur
ing the last 40 years."
"Rocket scientists went to Wall
Street because they weren't able
to build rockets," he commented.
The panelists, including Thiel,
urged extreme caution about reg
ulation in the computer industry.
The faster computer products are
changed and undated, "the harder
it is for government regulators to
follow," Thiel said.
"Cultivate, invest and get out
of the way," Falzone said.

The Stanford Law School
Chapter of the Federalist Society
hosted a student symposium this
past weekend to discuss and de
bate "Bureaucracy Unbound:
Can Limited Government and
the Administrative State Co-
Exist?" Around 500 law students
from across the nation witnessed
lively debates and presentations
in Cemex Auditorium on March
2 and 3.
Twenty-five prominent legal
scholars, practitioners and offi
cials from across the nation, in
cluding five judges and Larry
Kramer, dean of Stanford Law
School, led the discussions. U.S.
Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah), a
member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, presented the
keynote address at a banquet for
400 people Saturday night at the
Arrillaga Alumni Center.
Students from a range of top

law schools, including Harvard,
Yale, the University of Chicago,
Columbia University and the
University of Texas at Austin, at
tended the 31st annual confer
ence, which had not been held at
Stanford since 1996.
Kramer said that one of the
goals of the event was to "bring
top lawyers and scholars from all
sides of the issues to debate."
Conference co-chair Ilan
Wurman J.D. 'l3 echoed
Kramer's sentiments, saying,
"there was no answer in one par
ticular direction [to the main
question of the symposium] be
cause we had a strong balance of
liberal and conservative views on
each panel."
"The conservative panelists
tended to answer that the admin
istrative state needs to be dimin
ished dramatically if it can coex
ist with principles of limited gov
ernment," Wurman said.
Friday evening's panel dis
cussing the "Rule of Law and the
Administrative State," was mod

erated by the Honorable Carlos
Bea '56, J.D. '5B, who currently
serves on the U.S. Court of Ap
peals for the Ninth Circuit. In
light of the plurality of voices,
there were disagreements among
the panelists regarding the defi
nition of the rule of law, a term
the speakers pointed out as orig
inating from Aristotle and
Locke. Panelists included Har
vard Law School Professor
David Barron, NYU Law School
Professor Richard Epstein, Ohio
State University Law School
Professor Peter Shane and the
