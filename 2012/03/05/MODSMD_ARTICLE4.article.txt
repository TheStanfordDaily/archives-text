## Researchers celebrate trial's lasting success 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers from the Stanford School of
Medicine gathered with patients Sunday to
celebrate a successful clinical trial that tested
an alternative to the immunosuppressant
drug regimen that patients must normally fol
low after a transplant procedure.
"If one were able to make to make every
transplantation a reality in the 20th century,
the goal for the 21st century should be to do it
without drugs," said Samuel Strober, an asso
ciate professor in the immunology and
rheumatology department.
Traditionally, patients who receive trans
plants must take immunosuppressant drugs
to prevent their own immune systems from
attacking the new organ because the immune
system recognizes it as foreign.
In order to prevent the transplant recipi
ent's body from attacking the new organ
without a drug regimen, the researchers sup
pressed each patient's immune system via ra
diation therapy and then introduced some of
the donor's immune cells into the recipient's
immune system via the thymus and peripher
al lymphoid tissue. Introducing immune cells

from the donor prevented the recipient's im
mune system from recognizing the trans
planted organ's cells as foreign and attacking
the tissue.
This alternative, which worked in 12 of 15
kidney transplant patients who participated
in the trial, would eliminate the potential to
contract drug-induced toxicity that can result
from taking the immunosuppressant drugs. It
would also eliminate the cost of the immuno
suppressant drugs for patients, which can run
anywhere from $20,000 to $120,000 over a pa
tient's lifetime.

Patients on the traditional immunosup
pressant regimen may experience negative
side effects, such as increased susceptibility to
infection. Some ultimately reject their donat
ed organ.
"In patients using drugs nowadays, half of
transplants will be lost over a couple of
months," Strober said.
One of the study participants, John Every,
former vice president of the University of Pa
cific and an early participant in the trial, re-

ceived his kidney transplant 11
years ago on his birthday, what he
refers to as the "best birthday
present." Although Every even
tually had to return to a lower
dosage of one of his previous
drugs, he said he is grateful for
how the team's research im
proved his quality of life.
Likewise, Karen Burke, who
received her kidney transplant in
2006, also benefited from the
grant funded by the National In
stitutes of Health, without which
she said she could not have af
forded her treatment. As her kid
neys declined to 12 percent of
their full functionality, she met
with her nephrologist John Scan
dling, director of kidney and pan
creas transplantation at the
School of Medicine, who recom
mended she undergo an organ
transplant. Since the trial, Burke
has remained off immunosup
pressant drugs and lives in
Modesto with her two daughters.
"What's the best drug? No
drug," said Stephan Busque, di
rector of the adult kidney and
pancreas transplant program at
the School of Medicine.
