## Study tracks ocean path of baby turtles 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Alice Phillips 
The Stanford-affiliated Center
for Ocean Solutions (COS) in Mon
terey, Calif, released research last
week connecting a baby turtle's
chance at survival with the location
of its birth. The study found that
strong currents off the coast of Costa
Rica are particularly successful at
shepherding baby turtles to the safe
ty of offshore waters. This informa
tion, coupled with the researchers'
look at turtle breeding grounds, may
direct future conservation efforts.
According to former COS marine
biologist and executive director of
the Stanford-affiliated Tag-a-Giant
Foundation George Shillinger, the
Playa Grande beach in Costa Rica is
a popular breeding ground for turtles
because regional winds create large
eddies on the beach that provide the
turtles with shelter from the ele
ments. The vegetation in the ed
dies offers nutrients for the breed
ing turtles.
The strong ocean currents then
carry baby turtles far offshore into
the warm waters that promote
growth.
"The study shows that there are
areas in this world that are special
for the leatherback, and if you de
stroy the nesting beach, you take
away from the turtles a very im
portant launch pad," Shillinger
said in a Stanford News Service re
lease.
Baby leatherback turtles are
only the size of a computer mouse
and could not support the size of a
satellite tag or radio transmitter,
so the researchers had to use com
puter models to simulate the path
of the baby turtles in the ocean.
The team entered physical
oceanographic characteristics
such as water temperature, sea
surface height, winds and currents
in the eastern Pacific region area
from Mexico to Panama, where
leatherbacks are known to nest.
The researchers then used this
data to simulate the dispersal of
hatchlings from four nesting
beaches, providing for the first
time an idea of the locations to

which baby turtles disperse.
"Once we put all of this to
gether we might start to really
understand the life history of
these turtles from emergence to
adulthood," Shillinger said. "And
that information helps us devel
op conservation strategies that
link leatherback nesting beaches,
hatchling highways and nursery
habitats with migration corridors
and foraging hotspots for juve
nile and adult turtles across the
Pacific."
The study was released online
last week in the Proceedings of the
Royal Society B British scientific
journal.
