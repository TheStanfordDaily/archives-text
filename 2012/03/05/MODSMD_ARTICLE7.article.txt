## ASSU leaders attend Israel policy event 
### LINDSEY TXAKEEYANG 
Six Stanford students traveled
to Washington, D.C., this week to
attend the annual American Israel
Public Affairs Committee
(AIPAC) policy conference, head
lined by speakers including Presi
dent Barack Obama. Conference
events began Sunday and will last
through Tuesday.
Three out of the six Stanford stu
dents in attendance are ASSU rep
resentatives, including ASSU Presi
dent Michael Cruz 'l2, Deputy
Chair of the Undergraduate Senate
Dan Ashton 'l4 and Senator Alon
Elhanan 'l4. Each student attend
ing the conference, however, made
an individual decision to attend the
conference out of interest, not as a
representative of the ASSU
"I want to make this clear: Stan
ford is not sending anyone, [and
the] ASSU is not sending anyone,"
Cruz said, adding that the students
in attendance are students who
happen to be interested in national
or international policy. "But Stan
ford student body presidents typi
cally are invited to attend AIPAC,"
he added.
Cruz said his predecessors have
attended this conference, as well,
"so it's something of a tradition."
According to Ashton, An
AIPAC field organizer approached
him as someone who might be in
terested in learning more about the
American-Israeli relationship.
"I'm hoping to learn where the
American-Israeli relationship is
from the standpoint of American
policymakers to sort of see
where the discussion is because
obviously right now it's very much
in the news with Iran and Israel pos
sibly having conflict, so it's some
thing that's probably on the fore
front of a lot of people's minds,"
Ashton said. "I'm just interested in
seeing where the dialogue is."
Confirmed speakers for the con
ference include Israeli Prime Minis
ter Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli
President Shimon Peres and the
U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon
Panetta. A number of U.S. repre
sentatives and senators will be in at
tendance as well.
