# New drug gives hope to blood cancer patients
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Alice Phillips 
A randomized, double-blind
and placebo-controlled study in
volving Stanford University
School of Medicine researchers
showed that people with myelofi
brosis blood cancer can
benefit from ruxolitinib, the first
FDA-approved therapy for
myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib blocks
the JAK2 tyrosine kinase protein
that is both mutated and unusual
ly active in 50 to 60 percent of

myelofibrosis patients.
Myelofibrosis patients in the
advanced stage suffer from wors
ening blood counts, spleen en
largement and other sporadic
symptoms such as fever, night
sweats and muscle and bone
pains. Patients in the study re
ported decreases in these symp
toms when given ruxolitinib.
In the trial, 155 patients re
ceived ruxolitinib while 154 took
a placebo twice daily. The two
groups' spleen volumes were
measured over 24 weeks via mag
netic resonance imaging with the
primary endpoint for the study at
a 35 percent reduction in the
spleen volume.
Approximately 46 percent of
patients on ruxolitinib reported
experiencing a 50 percent or
greater improvement in their
myelofibrosis symptoms. Five
percent of patients receiving the
placebo drug reported the same
improvement of their symptoms.
Myelofibrosis, affecting
roughly 30,000 people in the
United States, is one of the many
myeloproliferative neoplasm
(MPN) diseases that affect ap
proximately 150,000 people in
the United States. MPN diseases
are characterized by the overpro
duction of red blood cells,
platelets or white blood cells by
the patient's bone marrow. This
overproduction can lead to scar
ring within the bone marrow, thus
decreasing the bone marrow's

blood-making ability.
The multi-site phase-3 trial,
published March 1 in the New
England Journal of Medicine,
was led by researchers at the MD
Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston and the Mayo Clinic in
Scottsdale, Ariz. Jason Gotlib, an
associate professor of medicine,
managed the Stanford University
School of Medicine researchers
who participated in the trial. With
15 participating patients, Stan
ford was the single largest re
cruiting site in the 300-patient,
89-site trial.
"Ruxolitinib doesn't cure the
disease, but the degree of benefit
is clinically meaningful and sub
stantial and allows many patients
to re-engage in their daily activi
ties," Gotlib said in a School of
Medicine press release.
In November, the FDA ap
proved the treatment for patients
with intermediate to advanced
cases of myelofibrosis. Ruxoli
tinib is called Jakafi when mar
keted and is produced by Incyte,
Corp., which also funded the clin
ical trial.

department of leukemia in the
Division of Cancer Medicine at
MD Anderson Cancer Center, is
the study's senior author. Srdan
Verstovsek, an associate profes
sor in Katarjian's department,
