# Delving into the virtual
## 
### AMRITA RAO 
It's difficult to walk when you can't see
your feet, but misstep and you will still
fall.
Authentic as the stomach-eliminating
weightless feeling was, the lack of impact
at the bottom reminded me that I was
standing firmly on carpeted floor. It was
more disorienting to look "up" at the lab
manager speaking to me and to see no
one.
I was participating in a virtual reality
demo called the "pit world" at Stanford's
Virtual Human Interaction Lab on the
fourth floor of McClatchy Hall in the
Main Quad. Recently renovated, the lab
is full of cutting-edge Virtual Reality
(VR) technology, including an elevated
haptic floor and an ambisonic sound oral
izer to create touch and sound feedback
in virtual worlds.
Lab researchers study how everyday
interactions are carried over into the vir
tual world and how virtual experiences
can change physical behavior.
"We try to stay three to four years ahead
of what other [researchers] are doing," said
Jeremy Bailenson, director of the lab and an
associate professor of communication.

Bailenson developed the lab from a
four-person project in 2003 and nur
tured it into the sophisticated facility it
is today.
Virtual Human Interaction Lab re
searchers collaborate on interdisciplinary
projects with various departments at
Stanford and other universities, as well as
with tech companies. Current research
topics include environmental conserva
tion behavior, gesturing in teaching and
social identity in virtual networks.
As part of my tour of the lab, I experi
enced a conservation behavior demon
stration firsthand. When I put on the
head-mounted display a hefty piece of
headgear with goggles I was transport
ed into a woodland scene and grasped a
chainsaw firmly with large, manly arms
that appeared to come out of my sides.
Donning the avatar of a lumberjack for 30
seconds, I cut down a tree and watched it
fall.
Subjects of the actual experiment were
told that using recycled toilet paper could
save the tree. After it fell, the forest
sounds died out.
"It's what we call pro-social behavior
encouragement," said Cody Karutz, the
lab manager. Speeding up time in VR al

lows the participant to virtually compress
his or her impact on the environment over
30 or 40 years into a couple of minutes.
"Right now, the idea of climate change
is very abstract, and VR can put you in
places that you never could be to make
these connections more visceral," Bailen
son said.
In order to run the lab, Bailenson and
his team employ 15 undergraduate pro
grammers recruited through a summer
training program. Programming each vir
tual world takes 200 to 300 hours.
"We have a lot of really fantastic
equipment," said undergraduate pro
grammer Tina Roh 'l4.
"We're trying to figure out how we can
use all that technology together," said
Pamela Martinez 'l3."lt's really exciting
to work with a new technology in away
that no one has ever done before,"
Martinez was part of a team that
hacked the Microsoft Kinect system to
use it as an alternative to the lab's track
ing devices. Virtual reality involves track
ing motions and rendering feedback, and
with the Kinect emerging as the fastest
selling gadget in consumer history, mil
lions of homes now have half of what they
need for VR. In fact, Microsoft represen
tatives visited the lab recently to study its

use of the Kinect.
Karutz said he belie ves it is only a mat
ter of time before the VR technology the
lab uses becomes sophisticated enough to
make distinguishing between real and vir
tual spaces difficult.
Entering the lab, one first sees a lentic
ular display on the opposite wall that ren
ders 3D images without requiring the
viewer to wear glasses. With increased de
velopment of haptic, or tactile, feedback,
touch will no longer serve as a test of real
ity. Technically, the viewer could become
immersed in a VR scene without being
sure if the world is real or virtual.
This may raise ethical questions, espe
cially in terms of advertising and market
ing research, in addition to the manipula
tion of participant behavior in the sustain
ability experiment. The lab asserts, how
ever, that all of its experiments are run
through the Institutional Review Board
and have zero ethical concerns.
"Our job as a lab is to think about how
technology is changing and stay ahead of
that," Bailenson said. "We want to under
stand the ethics of people spending time
in virtual spaces."

"We have a lot of really fantastic
equipment," said undergraduate pro
grammer Tina Roh 'l4.
"We're trying to figure out how we can
use all that technology together," said
Pamela Martinez 'l3."lt's really exciting
to work with a new technology in away
that no one has ever done before,"
Martinez was part of a team that
hacked the Microsoft Kinect system to
use it as an alternative to the lab's track
ing devices. Virtual reality involves track
ing motions and rendering feedback, and
with the Kinect emerging as the fastest
selling gadget in consumer history, mil
lions of homes now have half of what they
need for VR. In fact, Microsoft represen
tatives visited the lab recently to study its

use of the Kinect.
Karutz said he belie ves it is only a mat
ter of time before the VR technology the
lab uses becomes sophisticated enough to
make distinguishing between real and vir
tual spaces difficult.
Entering the lab, one first sees a lentic
ular display on the opposite wall that ren
ders 3D images without requiring the
viewer to wear glasses. With increased de
velopment of haptic, or tactile, feedback,
touch will no longer serve as a test of real
ity. Technically, the viewer could become
immersed in a VR scene without being
sure if the world is real or virtual.
This may raise ethical questions, espe
cially in terms of advertising and market
ing research, in addition to the manipula
tion of participant behavior in the sustain
ability experiment. The lab asserts, how
ever, that all of its experiments are run
through the Institutional Review Board
and have zero ethical concerns.
"Our job as a lab is to think about how
technology is changing and stay ahead of
that," Bailenson said. "We want to under
stand the ethics of people spending time
in virtual spaces."

Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab is full of cutting-edge virtual reality technology
that lab researchers use to study how everyday interactions work in the virtual world.
It's difficult to walk when you can't see
your feet, but misstep and you will still
fall.
Authentic as the stomach-eliminating
weightless feeling was, the lack of impact
at the bottom reminded me that I was
standing firmly on carpeted floor. It was
more disorienting to look "up" at the lab
manager speaking to me and to see no
one.
I was participating in a virtual reality
demo called the "pit world" at Stanford's
Virtual Human Interaction Lab on the
fourth floor of McClatchy Hall in the
Main Quad. Recently renovated, the lab
is full of cutting-edge Virtual Reality
(VR) technology, including an elevated
haptic floor and an ambisonic sound oral
izer to create touch and sound feedback
in virtual worlds.
Lab researchers study how everyday
interactions are carried over into the vir
tual world and how virtual experiences
can change physical behavior.
"We try to stay three to four years ahead
of what other [researchers] are doing," said
Jeremy Bailenson, director of the lab and an
associate professor of communication.

Bailenson developed the lab from a
four-person project in 2003 and nur
tured it into the sophisticated facility it
is today.
Virtual Human Interaction Lab re
searchers collaborate on interdisciplinary
projects with various departments at
Stanford and other universities, as well as
with tech companies. Current research
topics include environmental conserva
tion behavior, gesturing in teaching and
social identity in virtual networks.
As part of my tour of the lab, I experi
enced a conservation behavior demon
stration firsthand. When I put on the
head-mounted display a hefty piece of
headgear with goggles I was transport
ed into a woodland scene and grasped a
chainsaw firmly with large, manly arms
that appeared to come out of my sides.
Donning the avatar of a lumberjack for 30
seconds, I cut down a tree and watched it
fall.
Subjects of the actual experiment were
told that using recycled toilet paper could
save the tree. After it fell, the forest
sounds died out.
"It's what we call pro-social behavior
encouragement," said Cody Karutz, the
lab manager. Speeding up time in VR al

lows the participant to virtually compress
his or her impact on the environment over
30 or 40 years into a couple of minutes.
"Right now, the idea of climate change
is very abstract, and VR can put you in
places that you never could be to make
these connections more visceral," Bailen
son said.
In order to run the lab, Bailenson and
his team employ 15 undergraduate pro
grammers recruited through a summer
training program. Programming each vir
tual world takes 200 to 300 hours.
