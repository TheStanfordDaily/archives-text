## FROM FARM TO FORK A 						Stanford CSA for EPA 
### Jenny Rempel 
In elementary school, I may not
have understood the full social
and economic ramifications of
my family's decision to participate
in community-supported agricul
ture (CSA), but I certainly under
stood the excitement and child
hood delight that came from open
ing a box filled with a weekly sur
prise. Each Wednesday, my sister
and I would marvel at the wonder
ful new assortment of fruits and
veggies to be touched, named, nib
bled, cooked and noshed. In the
process, my parents not only taught
their daughters about food, but also
brought them to the forefront of the
local foods movement.
Community-supported agricul
ture represents a growing model for
connecting consumers with farmers
to provide support for local food
systems. Membership in a CSA typ
ically involves pledging financial
support for a local farm or farms,
such that CSA members cover the
anticipated costs of farm operation
and, in return, receive shares of the
farm's products. My childhood
CSA operated by having share
holders pay a monthly or quarterly
fee, for which they received a week
ly box of vegetables, fruit, herbs,
flowers and even eggs.
CSAs are on the rise in the Unit
ed States, having grown from a
grand total of two in 1986 to over
4,500 as of this January. There are
several CSAs in our area, some with
drop-off points right on campus.
This past fall, Earth Systems alumni
Briana Swette and Simon Neely
began a successful CSA and deliv
ered weekly boxes of kale, heirloom
tomatoes, eggplant and other treats
from their farm in Morgan Hill.
I'm in favor of almost any activi
ty that increases food literacy and
connects individuals with their
farmers, and the Stanford commu
nity now has an opportunity to go
beyond this typical CSA model and
support a more creative framework
for strengthening local food sys
tems. A team of undergraduates has
spent the quarter devoting their
Senior Seminar project in Earth
Systems to sustaining the East Palo
Alto Farmers' Market by initiating
a new CSA at Stanford.
The East Palo Alto (EPA)
Farmers' Market began in June
2008 "to provide a local, easily ac
cessible alternative food source to
residents who now travel distances
outside the city to find stores with
quality, fresh produce," according
to Collective Roots, an EPA non
profit organization that sponsors
the market.
Unfortunately, the EPA Farm
ers' Market is perhaps facing its last
season, as it does not provide mar
ket vendors with enough revenue
to make their continued presence
profitable. There are many reasons
why farmers' markets in low-in
come communities struggle to stay
afloat, and some would argue that
we should focus on the consumer
side, perhaps via educational out-

reach or broader efforts to restruc
ture food access in EPA. However,
the Stanford team working to sus
tain the market has focused on the
supply chain.
Their goal is to guarantee mar
ket vendors a minimum income
level. To sustain two to five farmers
at the market, they are aiming to es
tablish a CSA with 50 to 75 mem
bers, comprised primarily of Stan
ford faculty, staff and graduate stu
dents.
Should this new CSA actually
succeed, it will be an impressive op
portunity for the Stanford commu
nity to strengthen local food sys
tems on several fronts. First, CSA
members will be supporting local
farmers from the Agriculture &
Land-Based Training Association
(ALBA) in Salinas, Calif. Stanford
Dining already sources much of its
produce from ALBA, an organiza
tion operating on the triple bottom
line of "economic viability, social
equity and ecological land manage
ment." ALBA educates and em
powers limited-resource farm
workers, helping them develop
their own sustainable farms. Sec
ond, CSA members will promote
food security in EPA by ensuring
that these ALBA farmers will be
come dedicated farmers' market
vendors.
However, there's a distinct risk to
this CSA. It's possible that the Earth
Systems students have found a busi
ness model (the CSA) that is better
for the farmers than sustaining the
market. If that happens, the farmers
and CSA members will benefit, but
the initial goal of supporting the
EPA farmers' market itself will not
be met. There's a simple solution:
Farmers participating in the CSA
should sign a contract guaranteeing
they will stay at the market in order
to participate in the CSA.
Once this contract is secured, the
novel EPA-Stanford-ALBA com
munity-supported agriculture proj
ect will be an excellent opportunity
for local food systems engagement.
Ideally, the CSA will grow to per
haps even subsidize a differential
price range whereby EPA residents
can participate in the CSA at a re
duced price. Because it's hard for fi
nancially strapped EPA residents
to shoulder the upfront costs of
membership in a CSA, this type of
differential price model, already in
place at locations such as the Phat
Beets Produce in Oakland, is an ob
vious next step once the initial CSA
is economically viable.

Jenny would love to give you more
information about the EPA CSA.
