# HALF INVENTED
## Something left behind 
### Chase Ishii 
I started teaching math to
kindergarteners and first
graders after school twice a
week. For two major reasons, I
feel obligated to share that I get
paid for this. First, I want to give
an honest depiction: I am a starv
ing college student looking for a
relatively easy minimum wage
job, not Mother Teresa. Second,
by stating that I get paid, it implies
it is through a professional organ
ization and that Fm not just ran
domly showing up to elementary
schools, giving out snacks and
teaching tiny kids how to add of
my own accord. That would be
kind of creepy.
Some days, I take my group of
students outside to do math on
the playground, partially because
they are kindergarteners and
don't have the attention span to
be inside a classroom for two
hours, and partially because I'm in
college but still don't have the at
tention span to be inside a class
room for two hours. On this par
ticular day, we were doing sub
traction by jumping backwards on
a number line near the kickball
court. (Best teacher ever!) The
children were laughing and excit
ed to be outside, and everything
was great.
But then one girl started crying
a soft, slow cry. At first, it was
just sniffles and heavy breathing,
but the other children began to
notice, and her panic began to
grow. I had no idea why she was
upset. I started walking over to as
sess the situation, but the moment
she saw me coming, she screamed
and ran across the blacktop to the
jungle gym on the other side of
the playground. I began to run
after her, leaving the rest of the
class of kindergarteners standing
there with no instruction other
than to "do math with each
other." (Worst teacher ever.)

She was hiding in the winding
tunnel slide. But she didn't come
out when I called her name. I
stuck my head inside and called
her again, and when she saw me,
her face grew terrified, and she
began to scamper backwards up
the slide out of fear. It was the
most scared I'd ever seen a child.
She eventually came down, or
rather was forced down by the
other kids using the slide. And
once she had taken many slow,
deep breaths, she was able to tell
me what was going on. She had
seen her mother and younger sis
ter walk by across the parking lot,
but her mother had promised her
on that day that she would be
picked up before her sister. She
felt forgotten. Abandoned. She
felt "like nothing."
I know many of us deal with
feelings of shame and inadequacy
on a very real level, but there was
something about seeing the re
sponse of a seven-year-old, so vul
nerable and uninhibited, that
made the pain seem that much
more visceral.
Shame, for something we've
done or that has been done to us,
often rears its ugly head through
unhealthy addictions, resentment
toward others or complete bitter
ness and hatred toward oneself.
And it's not like a skinned knee
on a playground, where we can
just slap a band-aid on it and call it
a day. These wounds run so deeply
to the core of our emotional
health and conception of identity
that we deem them too dangerous
or painful to expose to others. We
get really good at climbing back
wards up the slide.
At least from my experience,
hiding shame or sorrow doesn't
make the pain go away or allevi
ate it. In fact, refusing to identify
or acknowledge it just compounds
the problem; it breeds the loneli-

ness that no one truly knows or
understands you. The pain of
abandonment or rejection, self
loathing or self-pity, needs to be
brought into the light in order for
the hope of healing to be seen.
What the crying kindergarten
girl from my math class needed
most was to be heard. Only when
we can talk openly with someone
about our faults or ways we've
been hurt can we begin to tell our
story in a more positive light, fo
cusing on how things can be bet
ter. Only then can we re-conceive
the suffering and creatively
choose how to deal with it.
Healing requires an openness
to sharing your story with others
and a boldness to receiving and
embracing their stories without
shying away. Shame and suffering
exist, and they are very real. We ei
ther choose to support and share
our pain together in love, or we
are left to bear it alone.
