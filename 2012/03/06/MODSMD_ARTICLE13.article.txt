## No. 31 is no problem for Card 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's swimming team
faced off against some of the best teams in
the nation this past weekend, as three of the
top six teams competed at the inaugural
Pac-12 Championships in East Los Ange
les. But none of those teams came even
close to stopping the Cardinal from taking
the 2012 Pac-12 crown and winning its 31st
consecutive conference title in the process.
Unfazed by the high level of competi
tion, No. 3 Stanford (7-1, 3-1 Pac-12) fin
ished on top of the scoreboard with 939.5
points, more than 100 points ahead of sec

ond-place Cal and almost 400 points ahead
of third-place Arizona.
Despite the Cardinal's large margin of
victory, it would have been difficult to pre
dict the final results before the meet kicked
off on Wednesday night. Even with Stan
ford's storied success in the conference set
ting, Arizona could easily have been con
sidered the favorite heading into the week
end. The Wildcats were ranked No. 1 in the
nation and also defeated the Cardinal in a
dual meet in January.
The only time that Stanford ever found
itself trailing was after the first event, when
the team was touched out by Cal in the 200
medley relay. In the very next event, how

ever, the Cardinal answered with a victory
in the 800 freestyle relay thanks to a clutch
anchor swim by senior David Mosko.
The team had unrivaled success in relay
events, a huge contributing factor to their
ultimate victory. What made the Cardinal's
stellar performance even more impressive
was the fact that going into the meet, the
team didn't have a single top seed in any of
the relays. By the end of Saturday night,
however, Stanford had won three of the
five relay events in which it competed.
Other than the team's overall domi
nance at the four-day meet, the biggest
story this past weekend was freshman
David Nolan. The talented youngster an

nounced his presence as an elite college
swimmer at the national level after being
named the Swimmer of the Meet for his in
dividual triple-win effort. Nolan won the
200 backstroke along with his specialty, the
200 individual medley.
The freshman's most impressive victory,
however, may have come in the 100 back
stroke, where Nolan edged out Cal's Tom
Shields, the defending NCAA and confer
ence champion in that event. Nolan dis
played his speed by finishing the first half of
his race over a half-second faster than the
rest of the field, and then he somehow man
aged to hold off a charging Shields down
the stretch for the victory. Nolan also
played a critical role in the three winning
relays for Stanford, bringing his total gold
medal count to six.
But Nolan wasn't the only freshman
who was critical to Stanford's success in the
pool. Distance specialist Drew Cosgarea
won the 400 individual medley and also
placed fourth in the 1650 freestyle. In the
medley event, Cosgarea led a 1-2-3 sweep
for Stanford. The team was able to fully
capitalize off its tremendous depth in that
event, as four of the top five finishers were
Stanford swimmers. In that event alone,
Stanford scored 85 points, which put the
Cardinal well ahead of its opponents with
just one day of competition left.
While the talented freshmen were criti
cal to the Cardinal's success at the confer
ence championship, senior leadership also
played a major role in the win. Senior Chad
La Tourette defended his conference title
in the 1650 freestyle one last time as he beat
second-place finisher Cristian Quintero by
almost 15 seconds. With the win, La
Tourette captured his fourth-consecutive
conference championship in the 1650. The
senior also added to his already-impressive
postseason resume by winning the 500
freestyle, his first conference title in that
event.
In a few weeks, the newly crowned Pac
-12 champion will carry its momentum to
the NCAA championships, where the Car
dinal will try to win the grand prize the
national title.
