# Republican candidates fit for office?
## 
### Tom Taylor 
It's Super Tuesday. The day
when 10 states, accounting for
410 delegates, will hold their
primaries and caucuses to de
cide the Republican nomina
tion for this year's presidential elec
tion in November.
Huh? You might be wondering:
Why has politics managed to spill out
of the News section and leak into the
Sports section? And why should I
care? I myself am not even a citizen
of this country, why should it even be
important who gets to sit in the Oval
Office?
As much as I might not want to
admit it, the identity of the U.S. presi
dent does actually have a big impact
on my life; the president is able to
make a huge impact, for good or bad,
on my world both inside and outside
of this country's borders. And the
health of the president is perhaps j ust
as important as all the other issues
that have been endlessly debated
over this drawn-out campaign.
A candidate's health is important
primarily because it would not be a
good thing if the President were un
able to do his or her job due to health
problems. But being healthy has
other advantages too: Being physi
cally fit aids cognitive abilities and
being able to blow off steam by going
for a run or hitting the gym reduces
stress. There is a third reason as well.
Ahead of the last Gulf War, a senior
Iraqi made the suggestion that Presi
dents George W. Bush and Saddam
Hussein could square up against
each other mano-a-mano to settle
their differences. It might have been
a joke, but if it weren't, maybe it
would have been worth seriously
considering. Almost 5,000 Allied sol
diers died as a direct result of the in
vasion and its aftermath, and the
number of Iraqi lives lost could num
ber anything from between 100,000
to 1,000,000.
So, assuming one of them can de
feat incumbent President Barack
Obama, the athletic abilities of the
four remaining Republican candi
dates might just turn out to be pretty
important over the next four years.
But how could we analyze this
important facet of the candidates?
Last week, the professional football
world turned to the NFL scouting
combine to learn more about the
players in the upcoming NFL Draft.
If it's good enough for football,
maybe it should be good enough for
the Republicans. At the very least, I'd
rather see the candidates doing cone
drills and the 40-yard dash than de
bate again.
Given that, disappointingly, this is
probably not going to be happening
any time soon, what can we learn
about the candidates? Time to turn
with trepidation to the Internet. My
trepidation stems from that fact that
I'm not entirely convinced that all
the "facts" on the Web are incredibly
reliable, and also because searching
for Santorum famously produces
some "interesting" hits.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is rela
tively hard to get detailed facts on
the physical attributes of these four,
but after a little bit of work I came up
with age and some estimate of their
heights and weights: Newt Gingrich
is 68 years old, 5-foot-10 and 240
pounds; Ron Paul is 76 years old, 5-
foot-10 and 135 pounds; Mitt Rom
ney is 64 years old, 6-foot-2 and 197
pounds; and Rick Santorum is 53
years old, 6-foot-4 and 170 pounds.
And, for comparison, the stats of
their biggest rival Barack Obama
is 50 years old, 6-foot-l and 180
pounds.

While Obama beats all four on
age, that is perhaps a cheap shot that
doesn't take into account lifestyle
factors. We could instead look at
Body Mass Index, a simple way to es
timate whether a person is the nor
mal weight for his or her height (any
thing between 18.5 and 24.9 is con

sidered normal.) Gingrich, Paul,
Romney and Santorum measure up
as 34.4,19.4,25.3 and 20.7 on this sta
tistic, respectively, and Rival-in-
Chief Obama is 23.7. While Paul,
Santorum and Obama are classified
within the normal range, Romney is
marginally overweight, and Gin
grich is obese. This analysis, though,
has its limitations. Simply being
heavier doesn't imply that someone
necessarily has greater body fat
though Gingrich is probably not all
muscle and lighter bodies can still
be unfit ones.
However, probably the best clue
to their athletic fitness is to look at
what they do to stay healthy. Gin
grich's exercise of choice is appar
ently golf, and it shows. He is clearly
not among the fittest of the candi
dates. Santorum supposedly does 50
push-ups a day, but doesn't seem to
have a publicized health routine
apart from that. The other three,
though, all at least represented high
school teams, Romney and Paul as
runners. In fact, Paul was even Penn
sylvania's 220-yard dash state cham
pion in 1952, and Obama was on his
high school's basketball team. Rom
ney still runs; Paul, though holding
the honor of being the oldest, regu
larly walks and rides his bike, even
challenging others to a bike ride in
the Houston heat; and Obama still
plays basketball and hits the gym.
Obama is going to be a tough
competitor to beat, but if health does
play a part in this election, perhaps
Romney or Paul might be best suit
ed to keep pace with him.

Obama, the athletic abilities of the
four remaining Republican candi
dates might just turn out to be pretty
important over the next four years.
But how could we analyze this
important facet of the candidates?
Last week, the professional football
world turned to the NFL scouting
combine to learn more about the
players in the upcoming NFL Draft.
If it's good enough for football,
maybe it should be good enough for
the Republicans. At the very least, I'd
rather see the candidates doing cone
drills and the 40-yard dash than de
bate again.
Given that, disappointingly, this is
probably not going to be happening
any time soon, what can we learn
about the candidates? Time to turn
with trepidation to the Internet. My
trepidation stems from that fact that
I'm not entirely convinced that all
the "facts" on the Web are incredibly
reliable, and also because searching
for Santorum famously produces
some "interesting" hits.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is rela
tively hard to get detailed facts on
the physical attributes of these four,
but after a little bit of work I came up
with age and some estimate of their
heights and weights: Newt Gingrich
is 68 years old, 5-foot-10 and 240
pounds; Ron Paul is 76 years old, 5-
foot-10 and 135 pounds; Mitt Rom
ney is 64 years old, 6-foot-2 and 197
pounds; and Rick Santorum is 53
years old, 6-foot-4 and 170 pounds.
And, for comparison, the stats of
their biggest rival Barack Obama
is 50 years old, 6-foot-l and 180
pounds.

While Obama beats all four on
age, that is perhaps a cheap shot that
doesn't take into account lifestyle
factors. We could instead look at
Body Mass Index, a simple way to es
timate whether a person is the nor
mal weight for his or her height (any
thing between 18.5 and 24.9 is con

sidered normal.) Gingrich, Paul,
Romney and Santorum measure up
as 34.4,19.4,25.3 and 20.7 on this sta
tistic, respectively, and Rival-in-
Chief Obama is 23.7. While Paul,
Santorum and Obama are classified
within the normal range, Romney is
marginally overweight, and Gin
grich is obese. This analysis, though,
has its limitations. Simply being
heavier doesn't imply that someone
necessarily has greater body fat
though Gingrich is probably not all
muscle and lighter bodies can still
be unfit ones.
However, probably the best clue
to their athletic fitness is to look at
what they do to stay healthy. Gin
grich's exercise of choice is appar
ently golf, and it shows. He is clearly
not among the fittest of the candi
dates. Santorum supposedly does 50
push-ups a day, but doesn't seem to
have a publicized health routine
apart from that. The other three,
though, all at least represented high
school teams, Romney and Paul as
runners. In fact, Paul was even Penn
sylvania's 220-yard dash state cham
pion in 1952, and Obama was on his
high school's basketball team. Rom
ney still runs; Paul, though holding
the honor of being the oldest, regu
larly walks and rides his bike, even
challenging others to a bike ride in
the Houston heat; and Obama still
plays basketball and hits the gym.
Obama is going to be a tough
competitor to beat, but if health does
play a part in this election, perhaps
Romney or Paul might be best suit
ed to keep pace with him.

It's Super Tuesday. The day
when 10 states, accounting for
410 delegates, will hold their
primaries and caucuses to de
cide the Republican nomina
tion for this year's presidential elec
tion in November.
Huh? You might be wondering:
Why has politics managed to spill out
of the News section and leak into the
Sports section? And why should I
care? I myself am not even a citizen
of this country, why should it even be
important who gets to sit in the Oval
Office?
As much as I might not want to
admit it, the identity of the U.S. presi
dent does actually have a big impact
on my life; the president is able to
make a huge impact, for good or bad,
on my world both inside and outside
of this country's borders. And the
health of the president is perhaps j ust
as important as all the other issues
that have been endlessly debated
over this drawn-out campaign.
A candidate's health is important
primarily because it would not be a
good thing if the President were un
able to do his or her job due to health
problems. But being healthy has
other advantages too: Being physi
cally fit aids cognitive abilities and
being able to blow off steam by going
for a run or hitting the gym reduces
stress. There is a third reason as well.
Ahead of the last Gulf War, a senior
Iraqi made the suggestion that Presi
dents George W. Bush and Saddam
Hussein could square up against
each other mano-a-mano to settle
their differences. It might have been
a joke, but if it weren't, maybe it
would have been worth seriously
considering. Almost 5,000 Allied sol
diers died as a direct result of the in
vasion and its aftermath, and the
number of Iraqi lives lost could num
ber anything from between 100,000
to 1,000,000.
