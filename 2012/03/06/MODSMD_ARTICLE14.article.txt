# Republican candidates fit for office?
## 
### Tom Taylor 
It's Super Tuesday. The day
when 10 states, accounting for
410 delegates, will hold their
primaries and caucuses to de
cide the Republican nomina
tion for this year's presidential elec
tion in November.
Huh? You might be wondering:
Why has politics managed to spill out
of the News section and leak into the
Sports section? And why should I
care? I myself am not even a citizen
of this country, why should it even be
important who gets to sit in the Oval
Office?
As much as I might not want to
admit it, the identity of the U.S. presi
dent does actually have a big impact
on my life; the president is able to
make a huge impact, for good or bad,
on my world both inside and outside
of this country's borders. And the
health of the president is perhaps j ust
as important as all the other issues
that have been endlessly debated
over this drawn-out campaign.
A candidate's health is important
primarily because it would not be a
good thing if the President were un
able to do his or her job due to health
problems. But being healthy has
other advantages too: Being physi
cally fit aids cognitive abilities and
being able to blow off steam by going
for a run or hitting the gym reduces
stress. There is a third reason as well.
Ahead of the last Gulf War, a senior
Iraqi made the suggestion that Presi
dents George W. Bush and Saddam
Hussein could square up against
each other mano-a-mano to settle
their differences. It might have been
a joke, but if it weren't, maybe it
would have been worth seriously
considering. Almost 5,000 Allied sol
diers died as a direct result of the in
vasion and its aftermath, and the
number of Iraqi lives lost could num
ber anything from between 100,000
to 1,000,000.
So, assuming one of them can de
feat incumbent President Barack
Obama, the athletic abilities of the
four remaining Republican candi
dates might just turn out to be pretty
important over the next four years.
But how could we analyze this
important facet of the candidates?
