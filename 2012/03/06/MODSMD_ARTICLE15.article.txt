# MOSBACHER MINUTE
## Stanford baseball passes first true test 
### JACK MOSBACHER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of the Stanford
baseball team from 2008 to 2011. Each week,
he'll take a look at the Cardinal's ups and
downs on its road to the College World Series.
When you looked at the No. 1 Stanford
baseball team's schedule prior to the start of
the year, this past weekend's series against
Fresno State would not have stood out one
bit.
Because it was sandwiched between series
with No. 12 Vanderbilt, No. 5 Texas and No. 7
Rice, you probably wouldn't have guessed
that this would be the series when we'd really
learn about the character and resilience of this
highly touted baseball team.
But it was. In fact, we learned far more

about the Cardinal this weekend than in any
other week because the Cardinal was on the
road for the first time, and because the Cardi
nal actually lost.
Rolling into Fresno touting an unblem
ished 8-0 record, the Cardinal had plenty to be
confident about. Following back-to-back
sweeps of Vanderbilt and Texas, the Cardinal
wore a No. 1 national ranking on its back for
the first time in a decade. And on a cold, windy
Friday night, the Cardinal (and stud pitcher
Mark Appel) was beaten.
Frankly, you don't learn much about the
character of a team in an early-season sweep.
After all, you have no way of knowing how
good or bad the losing team actually was until
it is tested in the crucible of later competition.
So despite the early-season excitement sur
rounding Stanford's two early sweeps, you

weren't going to see me too excited. The sam
ple size available for judgment was just too
small, and the sample quality of these tradi
tional powerhouses was misleading at best
(See: Vanderbilt being swept by Oregon and
Texas limping out of the gates at 4-7, including
a loss to lowly UT-Arlington).
After this weekend, however, I'm truly ex
cited. Why? Because the Cardinal lost and
then responded like a champion should.
Trust me when I say that the Stanford base
ball players like being good. They enjoy the
pressure of being called the best team in the
nation. And they knew how disastrous a series
loss to an unranked opponent would be for
their national standings. So, when the Cardi
nal dropped its first game of the year on Fri-
