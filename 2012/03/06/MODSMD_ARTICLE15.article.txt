# MOSBACHER MINUTE
## Stanford baseball passes first true test 
### JACK MOSBACHER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of the Stanford
baseball team from 2008 to 2011. Each week,
he'll take a look at the Cardinal's ups and
downs on its road to the College World Series.
When you looked at the No. 1 Stanford
baseball team's schedule prior to the start of
the year, this past weekend's series against
Fresno State would not have stood out one
bit.
Because it was sandwiched between series
with No. 12 Vanderbilt, No. 5 Texas and No. 7
Rice, you probably wouldn't have guessed
that this would be the series when we'd really
learn about the character and resilience of this
highly touted baseball team.
But it was. In fact, we learned far more

about the Cardinal this weekend than in any
other week because the Cardinal was on the
road for the first time, and because the Cardi
nal actually lost.
Rolling into Fresno touting an unblem
ished 8-0 record, the Cardinal had plenty to be
confident about. Following back-to-back
sweeps of Vanderbilt and Texas, the Cardinal
wore a No. 1 national ranking on its back for
the first time in a decade. And on a cold, windy
Friday night, the Cardinal (and stud pitcher
Mark Appel) was beaten.
Frankly, you don't learn much about the
character of a team in an early-season sweep.
After all, you have no way of knowing how
good or bad the losing team actually was until
it is tested in the crucible of later competition.
So despite the early-season excitement sur
rounding Stanford's two early sweeps, you

weren't going to see me too excited. The sam
ple size available for judgment was just too
small, and the sample quality of these tradi
tional powerhouses was misleading at best
(See: Vanderbilt being swept by Oregon and
Texas limping out of the gates at 4-7, including
a loss to lowly UT-Arlington).
After this weekend, however, I'm truly ex
cited. Why? Because the Cardinal lost and
then responded like a champion should.
Trust me when I say that the Stanford base
ball players like being good. They enjoy the
pressure of being called the best team in the
nation. And they knew how disastrous a series
loss to an unranked opponent would be for
their national standings. So, when the Cardi
nal dropped its first game of the year on Fri-
day night, the players didn't just
get mad; they got even. And then
they rubbed it in a little bit.
In the final two games, the Car
dinal treated Fresno State like a
little brother who had just scored
a lucky basket in a pickup basket
ball game. Stanford outscored the
Bulldogs on Saturday and Sunday
by a combined score of 25-2. I
think the message the Cardinal
sent to the baseball world was
clear: losses are not only flukes,
but we will treat them as personal
insults.
That's an exciting prospect be
cause this won't be the only Friday
game the Cardinal loses this year.
While you're unlikely to find any
one outside of the Appel family
who believes in Mark as much as I
do, the Stanford ace will be going
up against some of the best oppos
ing pitchers in the country this
year, including fellow first-round
talents like Arizona's Kurt Fleyer
and Arizona State's Brady
Rodgers.
Like I've said, we didn't learn
much that we didn't already know
about the Cardinal in its first two

weekend series. We knew the
team was loaded with talent and
that, on paper, it could play with
any team in the country. What we
didn't know was how it would re
spond to eventual adversity.
Would Stanford be like the el
ementary school bully who push
es kids around until somebody ac
tually hits back? Or would the
Cardinal be the type of team that
relishes the challenge of playing
the underdog every once in a
while, much like the last Stanford
team to make it to the College
World Series in 2008?
Three weeks into the season,
I'm ready to admit that I'm excit
ed about this Stanford baseball
team, because it is exactly the type
of team that people like to watch.
The players have confidence and
swagger they know they're
good but they also aren't afraid
to play like they have a chip on
their shoulder. They believe that
anything short of a trip to the
World Series in Omaha would be
a disappointment.
The Cardinal's reaction to Fri
day's loss speaks volumes about
the character of this team. One
thing is for sure: Stanford won't be
going down without a fight.
