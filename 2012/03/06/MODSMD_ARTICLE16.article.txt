# SETTLING FOR A SPLIT
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
Of the many emotions
sport induces, disappointment
is unfortunately often at the
top of the list. The No. 3 Stan
ford men's volleyball team
was once again confronted
with this uncomfortable feel
ing following a split at home
this weekend against UC-San
Diego and No. 2 UC-Irvine,
one that set the team back in
its quest for a Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation (MPSF)
title. The Cardinal (13-4, 10-3
MPSF) now sits in a tie for sec
ond place with UCI, one and a
half games back of first-place
UCLA, following a 25-21, 25-
15, 22-25, 25-19 win over
UCSD on Friday and a 25-21,
17-25,25-17,25-15 loss to UCI
on Saturday.
Friday's win over UCSD
(3-15,1-12) was a step in the
right direction for the Cardi
nal following the loss to No. 4
USC the previous weekend.
Consistent as ever, All-Ameri
can outside hitter Brad Law
son continued his remarkable
senior campaign, finishing
with a match-high 18 kills and
a pair of rocket aces that em
phatically closed out the
match for Stanford. He was
joined in double-figure kills by

After a bit of a shaky start
in the first set, the Cardinal
was able to take control fol
lowing a 10-4 run that put it
ahead 15-10. The Tritons were
able to keep the set close,
trimming the lead to 22-19
thanks to strong play by junior
Johl Awerkamp, who had five
kills in the set. Stanford was fi
nally able to close UCSD out
on a kill by Mochalski to end it
at 25-21.
The second set went more
quickly for Stanford, as Law
son, Mochalski and Irvin com
bined for 14 kills in the set to
lead the Cardinal. Lawson fin
ished off UCSD on consecu
tive kills.
The same fighting spirit
that allowed UCSD to stay
close in the first set finally pre
vailed in the third, as the Tri
tons took the back-and-forth
affair. UCSD jumped out to a
14-10 lead on the strength of
good defense and opportunis-

sophomores Steven Irvin and
Eric Mochalski, who finished
with 15 and 12, respectively.
