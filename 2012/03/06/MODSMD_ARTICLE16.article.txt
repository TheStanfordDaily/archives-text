# SETTLING FOR A SPLIT
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
Of the many emotions
sport induces, disappointment
is unfortunately often at the
top of the list. The No. 3 Stan
ford men's volleyball team
was once again confronted
with this uncomfortable feel
ing following a split at home
this weekend against UC-San
Diego and No. 2 UC-Irvine,
one that set the team back in
its quest for a Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation (MPSF)
title. The Cardinal (13-4, 10-3
MPSF) now sits in a tie for sec
ond place with UCI, one and a
half games back of first-place
UCLA, following a 25-21, 25-
15, 22-25, 25-19 win over
UCSD on Friday and a 25-21,
17-25,25-17,25-15 loss to UCI
on Saturday.
Friday's win over UCSD
(3-15,1-12) was a step in the
right direction for the Cardi
nal following the loss to No. 4
USC the previous weekend.
Consistent as ever, All-Ameri
can outside hitter Brad Law
son continued his remarkable
senior campaign, finishing
with a match-high 18 kills and
a pair of rocket aces that em
phatically closed out the
match for Stanford. He was
joined in double-figure kills by

After a bit of a shaky start
in the first set, the Cardinal
was able to take control fol
lowing a 10-4 run that put it
ahead 15-10. The Tritons were
able to keep the set close,
trimming the lead to 22-19
thanks to strong play by junior
Johl Awerkamp, who had five
kills in the set. Stanford was fi
nally able to close UCSD out
on a kill by Mochalski to end it
at 25-21.
The second set went more
quickly for Stanford, as Law
son, Mochalski and Irvin com
bined for 14 kills in the set to
lead the Cardinal. Lawson fin
ished off UCSD on consecu
tive kills.
The same fighting spirit
that allowed UCSD to stay
close in the first set finally pre
vailed in the third, as the Tri
tons took the back-and-forth
affair. UCSD jumped out to a
14-10 lead on the strength of
good defense and opportunis-

sophomores Steven Irvin and
Eric Mochalski, who finished
with 15 and 12, respectively.

Sophomore middle blocker Eric Mochalski (13, above) helped the Stanford men's
volleyball team beat UC-San Diego in four sets on Friday. The Cardinal could not
duplicate the victory against UC-lrvine on Saturday, though, falling in four sets.
tic hitting by Awerkamp. Stanford
eventually tied the set at 22
apiece, but it was not enough, as
UCSD came up with consecutive
blocks to hold on.
Stanford prevailed in the
fourth despite more pesky play
from the Tritons, who reduced an
18-12 lead to 22-19 before a serv
ice error by sophomore Vaun
Lennon set up Lawson's back-to
back aces to finish off the victory.
Looking to build on the mo
mentum of Friday's success, Stan
ford came out hoping to make a
statement against the Anteaters
(14-3,10-3), but in the end Irvine
was the team making the state
ment.
After a pair of highly competi
tive sets to open the match, Stan
ford struggled with its passing, re
sulting in a .117 hitting percent
age in the final two sets of the
match. Despite another strong
outing from Lawson, who fin
ished with 21 kills, the Cardinal
was not able to make a serious run
at the Anteaters, a team it had
beaten in straight sets just two
weeks prior.
The Cardinal started promis
ingly enough, as Stanford
jumped out to a 10-5 lead in the
opening set on a combined block
by senior Gus Ellis and sopho
more Brian Cook. Then things
took a turn for the worse, as jun
ior Kevin Tillie took control of
the set for UCI en route to a ca
reer-high 22 kills for the
Anteaters. Stanford mustered
just nine kills in the set, as UCI
closed out Stanford on consecu
tive kills by Tillie.
Stanford appeared to regain its
footing in the second, finishing the
set with a .476 hitting percentage
behind eight kills from Lawson.
This time, Stanford jumped out to
an 11-4 lead and never looked
back, trading blows with the
Anteaters until the decisive block
by Ellis and Irvin.
But then the troubles that
plagued the Cardinal the entire
night reared their ugly heads in
the third set and never disap
peared, as Stanford slogged its
way through two of its worst sets

of the season. The only man for
Stanford who seemed to be find
ing any success was Lawson, who
bashed his way through the UCI
defense despite minimal offensive
help from his teammates.
The Cardinal will look to re
gain its footing today and tomor

row night against No. 14 Hawaii.
Tonight's match will be in Burn
ham Pavilion, and Wednesday's
will be in Maples Pavilion, both
starting at 7 p.m.
