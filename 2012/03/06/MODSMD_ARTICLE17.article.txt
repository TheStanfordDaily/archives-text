# STRUGGLES CONTINUE
## STANFORD BLOWS HALFTIME LEAD 
### SARAH MAISEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite building an early lead
against No. 11 Vanderbilt on Sat
urday, the No. 16 Stanford
women's lacrosse team (1-4)
could not hold its early momen
tum and fell 15-9 to continue its
early season struggles. The team
had hoped to carry its momentum
off its thrilling first win of the sea
son, but the strength and speed of
the Commodore offense eventu
ally overpowered the Cardinal.
The first half opened with a
strong and balanced showing by
Stanford on both sides of the
field. Seniors Catherine Swanson
and Emilie Boeri both scored
within the first 10 minutes, setting
the tone for a period of offensive
dominance. Boeri then assisted
the Card's next two goals, one by
freshmen Emily Newstrom and
another by her sister, senior Anna
Boeri.

Stanford held the advantage in
possession in the first half, due in
part to a strong showing by the
Cardinal defense. Led by junior
Elizabeth Adam and sophomore
goalkeeper Lyndsey Munoz, the
backfield held the usually explo
sive Vanderbilt attack to just
three goals. Going into the break,
Stanford led 6-3 and showed no
signs of slowing down.
However, the Commodores'
offense finally awoke and tied the
score 6-6 within the first two min
utes of the second period. Fresh
man Kyle Frasier responded with
her second goal of the game to
push the Card up by one, but it
would be the team's last lead of
the game. Vanderbilt scored its
next three goals in under a
minute, and while Newstrom's
second goal of the game a few
minutes later pushed Stanford
within one, that was as close as the
Cardinal would get for the rest of
the game.
Vanderbilt went on four three
goal runs to outscore Stanford 12-
3 in the second period. The Com
modores ran a fast-paced attack
and dominated possession, which
prevented the Cardinal from hold
ing the ball long enough to mount
a comeback. Vanderbilt's edge in
draw control proved crucial and
allowed it to score multiple goals
in the span of a few minutes.

"I think our biggest struggle
right now is the transition,"
Munoz said. "This is where most
of our turnovers are coming from,
and this causes unsettled play for
our defense. In the second half,
the turnovers in transition are
what led to Vanderbilt's goals and
shifted momentum for the game."
While another loss in the early
season was a frustrating result,
perhaps part of the problem was
that the Cardinal was without one
of its leading scorers, sophomore
Anna Kim, who dislocated her
shoulder last weekend when she
scored the game-winning goal in
the final seconds against James
Madison. The offense did receive
a boost from freshmen Frasier
and Newstrom, who combined for
four goals, a good sign that the
youthful team has potential for
future development. Although
the team eventually lost its lead,
this was the first game in which
Stanford did not trail at the break.

While the 1-4 record against
top-20 teams is not where the
Cardinal would like to be, it now
heads into its first contest against
an unranked team with a chance
to regain its feet.
"When we work as hard as we
possibly can, the wins will come,"
Munoz said. "Yes, unfortunately
we're 1-4 right now but I know if
we keep working hard we'll start
to win. I also think it's good that
we're starting our season with
such tough competition, and it
will prepare us not only for con
ference play, but for the NCAA
tournament as well."
Sunday's game against New
Hampshire is the last at Cagan
Stadium until April 13. The team
will then travel east to face
Brown, Harvard and Albany be
fore conference play begins April
3 at Fresno State.

Stanford led 6-3 and showed no
signs of slowing down.
However, the Commodores'
offense finally awoke and tied the
score 6-6 within the first two min
utes of the second period. Fresh
man Kyle Frasier responded with
her second goal of the game to
push the Card up by one, but it
would be the team's last lead of
the game. Vanderbilt scored its
next three goals in under a
minute, and while Newstrom's
second goal of the game a few
minutes later pushed Stanford
within one, that was as close as the
Cardinal would get for the rest of
the game.
Vanderbilt went on four three
goal runs to outscore Stanford 12-
3 in the second period. The Com
modores ran a fast-paced attack
and dominated possession, which
prevented the Cardinal from hold
ing the ball long enough to mount
a comeback. Vanderbilt's edge in
draw control proved crucial and
allowed it to score multiple goals
in the span of a few minutes.

"I think our biggest struggle
right now is the transition,"
Munoz said. "This is where most
of our turnovers are coming from,
and this causes unsettled play for
our defense. In the second half,
the turnovers in transition are
what led to Vanderbilt's goals and
shifted momentum for the game."
While another loss in the early
season was a frustrating result,
perhaps part of the problem was
that the Cardinal was without one
of its leading scorers, sophomore
Anna Kim, who dislocated her
shoulder last weekend when she
scored the game-winning goal in
the final seconds against James
Madison. The offense did receive
a boost from freshmen Frasier
and Newstrom, who combined for
four goals, a good sign that the
youthful team has potential for
future development. Although
the team eventually lost its lead,
this was the first game in which
Stanford did not trail at the break.

While the 1-4 record against
top-20 teams is not where the
Cardinal would like to be, it now
heads into its first contest against
an unranked team with a chance
to regain its feet.
"When we work as hard as we
possibly can, the wins will come,"
Munoz said. "Yes, unfortunately
we're 1-4 right now but I know if
we keep working hard we'll start
to win. I also think it's good that
we're starting our season with
such tough competition, and it
will prepare us not only for con
ference play, but for the NCAA
tournament as well."
Sunday's game against New
Hampshire is the last at Cagan
Stadium until April 13. The team
will then travel east to face
Brown, Harvard and Albany be
fore conference play begins April
3 at Fresno State.
