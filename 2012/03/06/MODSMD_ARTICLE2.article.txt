# Barghouti calls for non-violence
## SPER hosts prominent Palestinian leader 
### ANTONIO RAMIREZ 
Mustafa Barghouti, doctor and for
mer Palestinian presidential candidate,
endorsed a peaceful means to end the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict when he
spoke Nonday evening at a Students
for Palestinian Equal Rights (SPER)
presentation titled, "The Voice of
Palestinian Civil Society: A Call for
Non-Violent Resistance."
Barghouti, an alumnus of the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business,
founded the Union of Palestinian Med
ical Relief Committees, a healthcare or
ganization serving the Gaza Strip and
West Bank. He was a candidate to suc
ceed Yasser Arafat as the Palestinian
Authority president until his arrest by
Israeli soldiers. Barghouti still received
19.8 percent of the vote in 2005.
Barghouti advocated through his
talk for a peaceful means to end the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict, giving ac
counts from a Palestinian perspective.
He recounted stories of trying to break
through the Israeli naval blockade in

the Gaza Strip to provide medical serv
ices.
SPER is a student group best known
for its calls for divestment from Israeli
companies committing human rights
violations in Israel settlements. Bargh
outi spent much of his speech dis
cussing his view on these violations,
which many on the Israeli side of the
conflict refute.
"I am sure, there is much discomfort
when Israelis hear the word apartheid,"
Barghouti said, referring to an accusa
tion SPER and others level at Israeli
treatment of Palestinians.
"If I was an Israeli, I would feel dis
comfort, too," he said.
Barghouti addressed the plight of
the Palestinians, describing to the audi
ence how Palestinians are frequently
humiliated at Israeli border crossings
on their way to work. One of the slides
he presented showed men jammed into
a metal turnstile gate as they made
their way to work.

Former Palestinian presidential candidate Mustafa Barghouti advocated in a Monday night speech
for non-violent protests and boycotts to oppose violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Barghouti reminded the audi
ence that students, not just adult
workers, also face a daily border
crossing into Israel for school. To
make it through the gates on time,
Palestinians are forced to arrive
at 4 a.m. on an average day.
The separation itself, accord
ing to Barghouti, is oppressive for
many Palestinians.
"I am forbidden from entering

the city I was born in," he said, re
ferring to Jerusalem.
Barghouti showed the audi
ence several videos depicting
graphic scenes. One showed Is
raeli soldiers using bullets to clear
out a building in order to send in a
military police dog that attacked
an unarmed woman, while anoth
er showed soldiers beating a
young man at an Israeli-Palestin
ian checkpoint.
"We are not respected by Is
rael," Barghouti said, while con
tinuing to advocate for a non-vio
lent approach to solving the con
flict.

Barghouti also referenced
Hana al-Shalabi, a Palestinian
woman placed in an Israeli
prison, who is currently ap
proaching day 19 of her hunger
strike.
In addition, Barghouti called
for boycotts to stimulate change
in global opinion toward Israel.
He referred to the Arab Spring
revolutions as a model for inciting
change in the oppression of Pales
tinians through nonviolent
protest.
