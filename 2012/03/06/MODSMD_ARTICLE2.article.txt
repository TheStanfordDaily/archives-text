# Barghouti calls for non-violence
## SPER hosts prominent Palestinian leader 
### ANTONIO RAMIREZ 
Mustafa Barghouti, doctor and for
mer Palestinian presidential candidate,
endorsed a peaceful means to end the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict when he
spoke Nonday evening at a Students
for Palestinian Equal Rights (SPER)
presentation titled, "The Voice of
Palestinian Civil Society: A Call for
Non-Violent Resistance."
Barghouti, an alumnus of the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business,
founded the Union of Palestinian Med
ical Relief Committees, a healthcare or
ganization serving the Gaza Strip and
West Bank. He was a candidate to suc
ceed Yasser Arafat as the Palestinian
Authority president until his arrest by
Israeli soldiers. Barghouti still received
19.8 percent of the vote in 2005.
Barghouti advocated through his
talk for a peaceful means to end the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict, giving ac
counts from a Palestinian perspective.
He recounted stories of trying to break
through the Israeli naval blockade in

the Gaza Strip to provide medical serv
ices.
SPER is a student group best known
for its calls for divestment from Israeli
companies committing human rights
violations in Israel settlements. Bargh
outi spent much of his speech dis
cussing his view on these violations,
which many on the Israeli side of the
conflict refute.
"I am sure, there is much discomfort
when Israelis hear the word apartheid,"
Barghouti said, referring to an accusa
tion SPER and others level at Israeli
treatment of Palestinians.
"If I was an Israeli, I would feel dis
comfort, too," he said.
Barghouti addressed the plight of
the Palestinians, describing to the audi
ence how Palestinians are frequently
humiliated at Israeli border crossings
on their way to work. One of the slides
he presented showed men jammed into
a metal turnstile gate as they made
their way to work.
