# STUDENT LIFE
## OAPE focuses on pre-gaming Castro downplays rise in alcohol transport numbers 
### DANIELLE LUSSIER 
The number of alcohol-related
transportations this year has in
creased from 44 cases at this point
last year to 53 this year, according
to the Office of Alcohol Policy &
Education (OAPE), though direc
tor Ralph Castro warned that the
slight increase may be deceptive.
The University created OAPE
this academic year with a goal of
combating alcohol-related injury.
According to Castro, a main target
for the office is to address the trend
of "pre-gaming," when students
drink large amounts of alcohol,
usually in the form of hard liquor,
in a short period of time before at

tending an event.
Castro said in an email to The
Daily that 14 of this year's cases oc
curred before highly advertised
all-campus events seven each
were related to pre-gaming before
Full Moon on the Quad and Mau
soleum party.
Castro said that the increase in
alcohol-related hospitalizations
may be the result of increased stu
dent awareness toward dangerous
situations.
"[The numbers] may actually
be reflective of pro-social, anti
bystanding behaviors," he said,
referring to the goals of OAPE's
current programming. "[ln
creased attention] could be posi
tively contributing to students
being more willing to call for help,
thus increasing the numbers."
Say Something at Stanford, the

OAPE's major
promotion this
year, tries to en- V
gage bystanders
to intervene when y
they see fellow stu
dents at dangerous
levels of intoxication.
OAPE is also working on
an official sober monitor program
for Stanford events and parties, ac
cording to Castro.
Others around campus have
noticed changes from the presence
of the OAPE.
Stuart Bennett, a resident fel
low in Serra, said, "Educating stu
dents to take some responsibility
for their friends who are drinking
irresponsibly rather than be by
standers can be effective."
Tessa Smith 'l3, a residential
peer health educator, said she

views OAPE
as a resource
that allows
students who
choose to drink
/ to do so safely,
in addition to be
coming educated
" on other issues in the
"big picture of the alcohol
scene."
Smith described the OAPE as a
valuable new resource on campus
for health and wellness, "even if it
takes some time to get rolling with
in the student body."
The OAPE's initiative to pro
mote alternatives to alcohol-cen
tric social events has taken shape
with Cardinal Nights, which, as
stated on the OAPE's website,


AUBRIE LEE/The Stanford Daily
seeks to "provide consistent, viable,
and novel opportunities for social
izing without alcohol on Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday nights."
Castro noted success with the
Cardinal Nights program and said,
"there have been nearly 7,000 stu
dent contacts at Cardinal Nights
events since October."
Rocio Novo 'l5 appreciated the
opportunity presented by Cardinal
Nights to attend Cirque du Soleil in
December.
"I really enjoyed it, and I would
recommend events like that for
anyone," Novo said.
This past fall quarter, Ujamaa
dorm staff planned an alcohol-free
event in coordination with the
OAPE to bring together West
Campus residents during the week
end of Big Game. Tubbs said the
OAPE provided event funding and
helped her and the Ujamaa staff
develop event ideas.
"We really wanted something
that would have alternate activities
for people to do," said Taj ah Tubbs
'l2, resident assistant in Ujamaa.

"We didn't want it to be like a typi
cal party."
Even this event wasn't entirely
immune to pre-gaming. Though he
did not enter the event, one student
was transported after arriving
heavily intoxicated.
One of the biggest challenges
that the OAPE faces is student mis
conception about alcohol use on
campus. With hospitalizations ris
ing, students may take this as an in
dication of a strong alcohol pres
ence on campus.
"People think that a lot more
people drink on campus than actu
ally do," Smith said.
The OAPE recently distributed
its Core Survey on Alcohol and
Drug Use to collect more exact sta
tistics on student alcohol and drug
habits. Results from the survey,
which concluded in late February,
have not yet been released.
The survey sought to quantify
and challenge assumptions about
the drinking culture at Stanford.
The OAPE's goal is to keep drink
ing safe and social, not to eliminate
it from campus culture, according
to Castro.
"The alcohol policy was clari
fied last year, and emphasis was
placed on discouraging high-risk
drinking practices," Castro said.

Other dorm staff members are
also taking steps to cultivate safe
drinking environments.
"You have to look out for one
another, and that message needs to
begin in the dorm," Bennett said.
"One of the things I liked dur
ing RA training is that they
stressed to us being open about
drinking and our experiences," said
Annika Graangard, resident assis
tant in Serra. Graangard said she
believes that this openness con
tributes to increased awareness
about alcohol and the issues associ
ated with it.
The OAPE also seeks to pro
mote an appropriate attitude to
ward drinking for students turning
21. Castro said that the office sends
out 21st birthday cards with safety
messages to all students the day be
fore their birthdays.
Additionally, the OAPE
"launched a social media campaign
that pushes out pro-social alcohol
messages via Twitter, Facebook and
You Tube," Castro said.
As a new entity on campus, the
OAPE is "not engrained in the
Stanford culture yet, but it will be,"
Smith said.

seeks to "provide consistent, viable,

izing without alcohol on Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday nights."
Castro noted success with the
Cardinal Nights program and said,
"there have been nearly 7,000 stu
dent contacts at Cardinal Nights
events since October."
Rocio Novo 'l5 appreciated the
opportunity presented by Cardinal
Nights to attend Cirque du Soleil in
December.
"I really enjoyed it, and I would
recommend events like that for
anyone," Novo said.
This past fall quarter, Ujamaa
dorm staff planned an alcohol-free
event in coordination with the
OAPE to bring together West
Campus residents during the week
end of Big Game. Tubbs said the
OAPE provided event funding and
helped her and the Ujamaa staff
develop event ideas.
"We really wanted something
that would have alternate activities
for people to do," said Taj ah Tubbs
'l2, resident assistant in Ujamaa.

"We didn't want it to be like a typi
cal party."
Even this event wasn't entirely
immune to pre-gaming. Though he
did not enter the event, one student
was transported after arriving
heavily intoxicated.
One of the biggest challenges
that the OAPE faces is student mis
conception about alcohol use on
campus. With hospitalizations ris
ing, students may take this as an in
dication of a strong alcohol pres
ence on campus.
"People think that a lot more
people drink on campus than actu
ally do," Smith said.
The OAPE recently distributed
its Core Survey on Alcohol and
Drug Use to collect more exact sta
tistics on student alcohol and drug
habits. Results from the survey,
which concluded in late February,
have not yet been released.
The survey sought to quantify
and challenge assumptions about
the drinking culture at Stanford.
The OAPE's goal is to keep drink
ing safe and social, not to eliminate
it from campus culture, according
to Castro.
"The alcohol policy was clari
fied last year, and emphasis was
placed on discouraging high-risk
drinking practices," Castro said.

Other dorm staff members are
also taking steps to cultivate safe
drinking environments.
"You have to look out for one
another, and that message needs to
begin in the dorm," Bennett said.
"One of the things I liked dur
ing RA training is that they
stressed to us being open about
drinking and our experiences," said
Annika Graangard, resident assis
tant in Serra. Graangard said she
believes that this openness con
tributes to increased awareness
about alcohol and the issues associ
ated with it.
The OAPE also seeks to pro
mote an appropriate attitude to
ward drinking for students turning
21. Castro said that the office sends
out 21st birthday cards with safety
messages to all students the day be
fore their birthdays.
Additionally, the OAPE
"launched a social media campaign
that pushes out pro-social alcohol
messages via Twitter, Facebook and
You Tube," Castro said.
As a new entity on campus, the
OAPE is "not engrained in the
Stanford culture yet, but it will be,"
Smith said.

The number of alcohol-related
transportations this year has in
creased from 44 cases at this point
last year to 53 this year, according
to the Office of Alcohol Policy &
Education (OAPE), though direc
tor Ralph Castro warned that the
slight increase may be deceptive.
The University created OAPE
this academic year with a goal of
combating alcohol-related injury.
According to Castro, a main target
for the office is to address the trend
of "pre-gaming," when students
drink large amounts of alcohol,
usually in the form of hard liquor,
in a short period of time before at

tending an event.
Castro said in an email to The
Daily that 14 of this year's cases oc
curred before highly advertised
all-campus events seven each
were related to pre-gaming before
Full Moon on the Quad and Mau
soleum party.
Castro said that the increase in
alcohol-related hospitalizations
may be the result of increased stu
dent awareness toward dangerous
situations.
"[The numbers] may actually
be reflective of pro-social, anti
bystanding behaviors," he said,
referring to the goals of OAPE's
current programming. "[ln
creased attention] could be posi
tively contributing to students
being more willing to call for help,
thus increasing the numbers."
Say Something at Stanford, the

OAPE's major
promotion this
year, tries to en- V
gage bystanders
to intervene when y
they see fellow stu
dents at dangerous
levels of intoxication.
OAPE is also working on
an official sober monitor program
for Stanford events and parties, ac
cording to Castro.
Others around campus have
noticed changes from the presence
of the OAPE.
Stuart Bennett, a resident fel
low in Serra, said, "Educating stu
dents to take some responsibility
for their friends who are drinking
irresponsibly rather than be by
standers can be effective."
Tessa Smith 'l3, a residential
peer health educator, said she

views OAPE
as a resource
that allows
students who
choose to drink
/ to do so safely,
in addition to be
coming educated
" on other issues in the
"big picture of the alcohol
scene."
Smith described the OAPE as a
valuable new resource on campus
for health and wellness, "even if it
takes some time to get rolling with
in the student body."

mote alternatives to alcohol-cen
tric social events has taken shape
