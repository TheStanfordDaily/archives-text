## OAPE focuses on pre-gaming Castro downplays rise in alcohol transport numbers 
### DANIELLE LUSSIER 
The number of alcohol-related
transportations this year has in
creased from 44 cases at this point
last year to 53 this year, according
to the Office of Alcohol Policy &
Education (OAPE), though direc
tor Ralph Castro warned that the
slight increase may be deceptive.
The University created OAPE
this academic year with a goal of
combating alcohol-related injury.
According to Castro, a main target
for the office is to address the trend
of "pre-gaming," when students
drink large amounts of alcohol,
usually in the form of hard liquor,
in a short period of time before at

tending an event.
Castro said in an email to The
Daily that 14 of this year's cases oc
curred before highly advertised
all-campus events seven each
were related to pre-gaming before
Full Moon on the Quad and Mau
soleum party.
Castro said that the increase in
alcohol-related hospitalizations
may be the result of increased stu
dent awareness toward dangerous
situations.
"[The numbers] may actually
be reflective of pro-social, anti
bystanding behaviors," he said,
referring to the goals of OAPE's
current programming. "[ln
creased attention] could be posi
tively contributing to students
being more willing to call for help,
thus increasing the numbers."
Say Something at Stanford, the

OAPE's major
promotion this
year, tries to en- V
gage bystanders
to intervene when y
they see fellow stu
dents at dangerous
levels of intoxication.
OAPE is also working on
an official sober monitor program
for Stanford events and parties, ac
cording to Castro.
Others around campus have
noticed changes from the presence
of the OAPE.
Stuart Bennett, a resident fel
low in Serra, said, "Educating stu
dents to take some responsibility
for their friends who are drinking
irresponsibly rather than be by
standers can be effective."
Tessa Smith 'l3, a residential
peer health educator, said she

views OAPE
as a resource
that allows
students who
choose to drink
/ to do so safely,
in addition to be
coming educated
" on other issues in the
"big picture of the alcohol
scene."
Smith described the OAPE as a
valuable new resource on campus
for health and wellness, "even if it
takes some time to get rolling with
in the student body."
The OAPE's initiative to pro
mote alternatives to alcohol-cen
tric social events has taken shape
with Cardinal Nights, which, as
stated on the OAPE's website,
