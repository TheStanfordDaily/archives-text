## Sleep and Dreams professor finds caffeine disrupts sleep of "morning people" 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Billy Gallagher 
Getting a midday jolt of caffeine at the
CoHo or an energy drink at the Axe and
Palm could leave you tossing and turning
at night, unless you are already a "night
owl," said a recent Stanford study. The
study showed that "morning people" are
more likely than "night owls" to awaken
during the night after consuming caffeine.
Jamie Zeitzer, an assistant professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences, led the
research, which was published in Sleep
Medicine and further covered by Scientif
ic American. Zeitzer is also the assistant
lecturer for the popular course Sleep and
Dreams.
According to the researchers, this was
the first study to examine the effects of
caffeine consumption while categorizing
people by the time of day when they are
most alert. Fifty college students were
asked to record their daily intake of caf
feine as well as their wake and sleep times
over the course of a week.
Zeitzer noted that most of the college
aged participants were so sleep deprived
that they slept well after going to bed re
gardless; however, the more caffeine that
the early risers had in their body, the
longer they spent awake during
the night.
