# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Industry experts discuss future of automotive industry, electric cars 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
With the automotive industry on the verge
of major changes due to rising oil prices and
increasing emissions restrictions, the Stanford
Energy Club's Energy 360° program brought
together experts and executives Monday
evening for a holistic discussion about the in
dustry's future.
"We do a deep dive into energy topics,"
said Karim Farhat, president of the Stanford
Energy Club.
Energy 360° is a quarterly interdisciplinary
program that tries to address all aspects of
predominant energy issues, including the

technology, policy and business perspectives.
The panel featured representatives from
longstanding automakers, new entries in the
market, new software service providers and
legislators.
Panelist Jim McKinney from the Califor
nia Energy Commission set the scene for the
discussion's importance with statistics about
California transportation. According to McK
inney, California boasts 26.2 million cars and
just fewer than one million trucks on the road.
In a single year, the state uses 18.8 billion gal
lons of gasoline and diesel fuel.
The main topic of discussion at the panel

Executives from General Motors, Tesla Motors, RelayRides, Streetline and the California Energy
Commission discussed the future of transportation in California in a panel Monday.
was the question of electric vehi
cles entering a market previously
dominated by internal combus
tion engine vehicles for over 100
years. Panelist Marc Tarpenning,
co-founder of one of the biggest
challengers to the major au
tomakers, Tesla Motors, described
how battery technology is just
reaching the point at which elec
tric cars can be practical upmar
ket, but the technology is on pace
to drop in price.
"Cell phones used to be 10
grand apiece," Tarpenning said.
"Each model of Tesla has been
cheaper than the previous one,
and it's going to continue like that
for a long time."
Byron Shaw, managing direc
tor at General Motors' Advanced
Technology Office, sat on the
panel to discuss GM's outlook on
the future of cars and trucks.
"We look out toward 2030
when we start planning our
products," Shaw said. He noted
that some demographic projec
tions indicate most of the world
living in cities much larger than
any currently in existence by
2030, and such dense popula
tions may change transportation
completely.
For now, however, Shaw em
phasized that GM is staying with
consumer demands.
"The internal combustion en
gine is not going away anytime
soon," he said. "What you'll see is
more and more miles being re
placed .. . with battery or fuel

cells as the technology develops."
Other panelists commented
on new transportation models
and software services. S he 1 -
by Clark, founder of Relayßides,
discussed his company's philoso
phy. Relayßides allows car own
ers to rent their cars to others for
personal profit.
Clark said that much of the en
vironmental impact from cars
comes from the manufacturing
and resources needed to make the
vehicle. Car sharing programs
such as Relayßides promote the
possibility of having less cars on
the road by allowing people to use
cars that would otherwise be sit
ting idly in parking lots.
"The challenge we face is this
American love of our cars," Clark
said. "Maybe we can all start
thinking about the fact that you
don't have to own your car.
"You don't get upset about not
owning your train," he added.
Kurt Buecheler, vice presi
dent and general manager of
Streetline, a company develop
ing sensor-based systems to opti
mize parking for cities, offered a
different perspective on the
panel. Streetline presents data in
a mobile phone application that
points users to available parking
spots.
The panelists were generally in
agreement that legislation and
regulation will need to evolve
along with the automotive indus
try to address future problems.
Regulating parking in the face of
massive overpopulation and deal
ing with increased load on the
electric grid from the charging of
electric vehicle batteries may
pose major obstacles in the near
future.

Shaw noted, however, the diffi
culties that governmental actions
pose for automakers.
"It takes us about seven years
to design a vehicle from concep
tion to seeing that car on the
street," he said, referring to
changes over the last decade in
Environmental Protection
Agency and Corporate Average
Fuel Economy regulations.

Tarpenning recognized
Japan's success with setting a
price floor on gasoline after the
oil scare of the 19705. The price
floor forced Japanese automakers
such as Toyota and Honda to en
gineer more efficient cars to meet
consumer demand.
In the start-up realm, Buechel
er encouraged entrepreneurs to
focus on reinventing industries.

calling for "medicine" for major
problems in the world instead of
"vitamins" to slightly enhance
life.
"Is something transformation
al? Did it really make a differ
ence?" he asked.

tion engine vehicles for over 100
years. Panelist Marc Tarpenning,
co-founder of one of the biggest
challengers to the major au
tomakers, Tesla Motors, described
how battery technology is just
reaching the point at which elec
tric cars can be practical upmar
ket, but the technology is on pace
to drop in price.
"Cell phones used to be 10
grand apiece," Tarpenning said.
"Each model of Tesla has been
cheaper than the previous one,
and it's going to continue like that
for a long time."
Byron Shaw, managing direc
tor at General Motors' Advanced
Technology Office, sat on the
panel to discuss GM's outlook on
the future of cars and trucks.
"We look out toward 2030
when we start planning our
products," Shaw said. He noted
that some demographic projec
tions indicate most of the world
living in cities much larger than
any currently in existence by
2030, and such dense popula
tions may change transportation
completely.
For now, however, Shaw em
phasized that GM is staying with
consumer demands.
"The internal combustion en
gine is not going away anytime
soon," he said. "What you'll see is
more and more miles being re
placed .. . with battery or fuel

cells as the technology develops."
Other panelists commented
on new transportation models
and software services. S he 1 -
by Clark, founder of Relayßides,
discussed his company's philoso
phy. Relayßides allows car own
ers to rent their cars to others for
personal profit.
Clark said that much of the en
vironmental impact from cars
comes from the manufacturing
and resources needed to make the
vehicle. Car sharing programs
such as Relayßides promote the
possibility of having less cars on
the road by allowing people to use
cars that would otherwise be sit
ting idly in parking lots.
"The challenge we face is this
American love of our cars," Clark
said. "Maybe we can all start
thinking about the fact that you
don't have to own your car.
"You don't get upset about not
owning your train," he added.
Kurt Buecheler, vice presi
dent and general manager of
Streetline, a company develop
ing sensor-based systems to opti
mize parking for cities, offered a
different perspective on the
panel. Streetline presents data in
a mobile phone application that
points users to available parking
spots.
The panelists were generally in
agreement that legislation and
regulation will need to evolve
along with the automotive indus
try to address future problems.
Regulating parking in the face of
massive overpopulation and deal
ing with increased load on the
electric grid from the charging of
electric vehicle batteries may
pose major obstacles in the near
future.

Shaw noted, however, the diffi
culties that governmental actions
pose for automakers.
"It takes us about seven years
to design a vehicle from concep
tion to seeing that car on the
street," he said, referring to
changes over the last decade in
Environmental Protection
Agency and Corporate Average
Fuel Economy regulations.

Tarpenning recognized
Japan's success with setting a
price floor on gasoline after the
oil scare of the 19705. The price
floor forced Japanese automakers
such as Toyota and Honda to en
gineer more efficient cars to meet
consumer demand.
In the start-up realm, Buechel
er encouraged entrepreneurs to
focus on reinventing industries.

With the automotive industry on the verge
of major changes due to rising oil prices and
increasing emissions restrictions, the Stanford
Energy Club's Energy 360° program brought
together experts and executives Monday
evening for a holistic discussion about the in
dustry's future.
"We do a deep dive into energy topics,"
said Karim Farhat, president of the Stanford
Energy Club.
Energy 360° is a quarterly interdisciplinary
program that tries to address all aspects of
predominant energy issues, including the

technology, policy and business perspectives.
The panel featured representatives from
longstanding automakers, new entries in the
market, new software service providers and
legislators.
Panelist Jim McKinney from the Califor
nia Energy Commission set the scene for the
discussion's importance with statistics about
California transportation. According to McK
inney, California boasts 26.2 million cars and
just fewer than one million trucks on the road.
In a single year, the state uses 18.8 billion gal
lons of gasoline and diesel fuel.
The main topic of discussion at the panel
