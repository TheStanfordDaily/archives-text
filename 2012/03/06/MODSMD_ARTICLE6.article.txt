## GSB grads head into education Joint degree program with School of Ed. offers variety 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Graduates of Stanford's Grad
uate School of Business (GSB)
are pursuing a more diverse array
of careers of late, according to the
GSB's Career Management Cen
ter. Many of these graduates are
looking to the education industry
rather than business or finance,
"The most significant trend we
have seen in recent years has been
an extraordinary diversification
in what GSB students choose to
pursue," said Pulin Sanghvi MBA
'97, director and assistant dean of
the GSB Career Management
Center. "We have approximately
780 MBA students and more than
300 firms that hire them, which
means that, any given year, 80 per
cent of employers will hire only
one student."
Sanghvi also noted that a sig
nificant number of MBA students
are pursuing joint degrees with
other schools at Stanford.
Nereyda Salinas, managing di
rector of career resources for the
School of Education, has seen an
increase in students applying to
the joint MBA-Master's of Edu
cation program.
"A good portion of these
joint-degree students are defi
nitely pursuing long-term careers
in education," Salinas said.
"These students are looking to
pursue education-management
careers . . . They are trying to im
pact the field of education in a
scalable manner."
"Students who are interested
in education who get an MBA will
look for opportunities where they
can drive change," Sanghvi
echoed.
Education Pioneers, a non
profit that places graduate stu
dent fellows into education or
ganizations to gain experience in
the industry, has been a starting
point for many GSB students.
"I think the opportunity to do
well by kids, particularly low-in
come kids, makes an education
profession a really attractive
one," said Liam Garland, Bay
Area managing director of Edu
cation Pioneers. "We are also
catching grad students at a part of
their career where they are not as
interested in being a teacher, but
are more excited by system-wide
reform."
Many of the Education Pio
neers fellows are current GSB
students.
"We get a lot of applications
from current GSB-ers to be a part
of our fellowship," Garland said.
"Stanford is one of the top ten
schools for Education Pioneers ..
. This tells me that not just Educa
tion Pioneers, but also our part
ner education organizations are
really impressed by them."
Garland also noted that he be
lieves a joint degree is a powerful
tool in the education field.
"The fact that Stanford has a
dual degree in business and edu
cation distinguishes it from other
schools," Garland said. "Dual-de
gree candidates are really great
for the Education Pioneers expe
rience ... We think that better
solutions will be developed from
people in different backgrounds
and different degree types strug
gling over the same problems. We

want to create conversations with
multiple perspectives represent
ed."
Stanford graduates have en
tered a diverse array of educa
tion-related opportunities. Some,
like Eduardo Briceno, graduate
of the joint MBA-Master's of Ed
ucation program and an 'O6 Edu
cation Pioneers fellow, are pursu
ing careers in nonprofits. Briceno
co-founded Brainology, an educa
tion and entrepreneurial non
profit.
"There's a trend where alumni
gain a few years of private sector
experience after their fellowship
with Education Pioneers and
then come back to education
after that," Garland said.
Others are entering charter
management and government or
ganizations. Ash Solar, another
graduate of the joint MBA-Mas
ter's of Education program and
an 'O7 Education Pioneers Fel
low, is now the chief talent and
strategy officer for the Tennessee
State Department of Education.
"When you've got somebody
in business school, and they are
looking at career paths, there's an
opportunity oftentimes to gain
really substantial experience
quickly in education," Garland
said. "This is another thing that
attracts MBA students to the in
dustry."
