## SPARKS OF CREATIVITY 
### CHRIS FREDERICK 
In a crowded garage at the Hasso Plat
tner Institute of Design at Stanford
(d.school), a group of students lounge
on red couches, fiddle with Legos and
rethink education. The students' plan
is straightforward: Buy a red truck, fill it
with tools and drive it to schools. The team
Jason Chua 'll M.S. 'l2, Prat Ganapathy
M.S. 'l2, Kathayoon Khalil Ph.D. 'l4, Eu
gene Korsunskiy M.EA. 'l2, Diane Lee 'l2
and Aaron Peck 'l2 calls itself Spark Lab
and hopes to deliver hands-on learning to
Bay Area students.
Spark Lab was developed as part of a
mechanical engineering class known infor
mally as "Design Garage." Other teams in
the class are tackling projects rethinking
journalism and redesigning the wheelchair.
The teams are advised by prominent fig
ures, such as IDEO founder David Kelly.
"Our whole point is that manipulating
matter with your hands is how you get a
sense of empowerment that you can change
the world around you," Korsunskiy said of
his team's vision.
Korsunskiy said he realized, reflecting
on his own experience in school, that "tin
kering opportunities" tended to diminish as
he advanced through the grade levels. The
team saw a problem with hands-on work in
the current education system.
"There's a lot of high-level education
policymakers who in theory claim to agree
that the future of the country depends on a
workforce that's creative ... but no one's
doing anything about it," Korsunskiy said.
"As [they]'re talking about how creativity
needs to be expanded, shop classes are
being cut... so we decided: 'We are going
to do something about this.'"
When the Spark Lab team talked to
working teachers, they learned that many
lacked the time and space to emphasize
creativity in the classroom.
"We came up with the idea that maybe
we can be this mobile-tinkering field trip
that comes to you," Korsunskiy said.
Spark Lab plans to target middle school
students initially. Inside the truck, the team
will guide students through the process of
creating their own product.
Take the example of middle school stu
dents building a homemade lamp. First,
they would choose their favorite lamp de

signs. Then, they would create a rough ver
sion using materials such as Popsicle sticks
and twist ties before building a clay proto
type. At that point, the Spark Lab team
would use software called Autodesk 123 D
to photograph the clay prototype from
multiple angles, generating a three-dimen
sional model of the lamp. Finally, a 3D
printer would spit out layers of hot glue to
produce a physical copy of the lamp.
While the technology itself is impres
sive, "the most important part is for kids to
have an artifact that they can take home
and show their parents," Peck said.
The Spark Lab team also aims to balance
the expensive tools with plenty of low-tech
items of the sort that might be found in a
shop class.
The truck's physical location outside of
schools is key to the project's effectiveness.
Khalil described the classroom as a "psy
chological barrier" for some kids.
"It's not just a physical, outside space,
it's psychological space," Chua said. "Once
students step out of the classroom, it frees
them to be more creative."
Unlike a conventional startup, Spark-
Lab does not expect to generate any rev
enue. Instead, the project will rely on fund
ing from an online Kickstarter campaign
thus far, Spark Lab has raised over $7,500
toward a target of $25,000. Team members
hope to persuade tool companies to donate
expensive items such as laser cutters or 3D
printers.
Despite its promise, Spark Lab faces

some obstacles. With $25,000, the team
would only be able to afford a single truck,
limiting the number of students who could
benefit from the project. However, as Chua
emphasized, "right now, we're concentrat
ing on focused impact, rather than super
scaled impact."
In this stage of their project, the Spark-
Lab team has also been busy holding work
shops and attending interviews, and they've
found it hard to find time for introspection,
according to Korsunskiy. Nevertheless, the
Spark Lab team has been able to meet im
portant Bay Area contacts at events such as
Maker Faire, a two-day festival celebrating
creativity and hands-on making.
"It seems like we've struck a nerve
somewhere, where this idea resonates with
a lot of people," Chua said.
Among other local figures, the group
met the founder of Make, a magazine fo
cused on do-it-yourself (DIY) projects, as
well as officials from the San Francisco Ex
ploratorium, design software company Au
todesk and San Jose-based nonprofit Re
source Area For Teaching (RAFT). Re
sponses to the project have been positive.
"This is an incredibly cool idea get
ting these tools into the hands of kids!"
wrote Carl Bass, CEO of Autodesk, on
Spark Lab's Kickstarter page.
"I love the truck. This is a great way to
bring the tools and materials for making to
more young makers," wrote Dale Dougher
ty, founding editor of MAKE magazine, on
the same page.

The Spark Lab team tested out their idea
on campus last year by running design
workshops at Splash!, a program that
brings middle school, high school and un
derserved students to Stanford's campus
for two days. Working with sixth graders
and Yahoo! executives, the team was sur
prised to find that the younger students
were more creative.
"It's really sad to see what happens be
tween those ages that really squashes any
semblance of fearless, creative endeavors,"
Korsunskiy said.
With a hectic schedule, the team mem
bers say that it is important to beat stress
and maintain their enthusiasm. Their team
dynamic reflects this ethos.
"We believe that the team that has the
most fun together comes up with the best
ideas," Korsunskiy said.
"We basically spend our waking lives to
gether, so we'd better have fun, or our lives
will suck," Chua added. "Some of us are to
the point where we communicate in blinks
and grunts."
Despite all the support, developing a
unique education project has not been easy.
"Every person has an opinion on educa
tion . . . We have trouble figuring out
what's new," Khalil said. "But we decided, it
doesn't matter if the solution is new the
problems are still here, and they don't go
away."

"It's really sad to see what happens be

Korsunskiy said.

dynamic reflects this ethos.
"We believe that the team that has the

"We basically spend our waking lives to

will suck," Chua added. "Some of us are to
the point where we communicate in blinks
and grunts."
Despite all the support, developing a
unique education project has not been easy.
"Every person has an opinion on educa

what's new," Khalil said. "But we decided, it
doesn't matter if the solution is new the
problems are still here, and they don't go
away."

In a crowded garage at the Hasso Plat
tner Institute of Design at Stanford
(d.school), a group of students lounge
on red couches, fiddle with Legos and
rethink education. The students' plan
is straightforward: Buy a red truck, fill it
with tools and drive it to schools. The team
Jason Chua 'll M.S. 'l2, Prat Ganapathy
M.S. 'l2, Kathayoon Khalil Ph.D. 'l4, Eu
gene Korsunskiy M.EA. 'l2, Diane Lee 'l2
and Aaron Peck 'l2 calls itself Spark Lab
and hopes to deliver hands-on learning to
Bay Area students.
Spark Lab was developed as part of a
mechanical engineering class known infor
mally as "Design Garage." Other teams in
the class are tackling projects rethinking
journalism and redesigning the wheelchair.
The teams are advised by prominent fig
ures, such as IDEO founder David Kelly.
"Our whole point is that manipulating
matter with your hands is how you get a
sense of empowerment that you can change
the world around you," Korsunskiy said of
his team's vision.
Korsunskiy said he realized, reflecting
on his own experience in school, that "tin
kering opportunities" tended to diminish as
he advanced through the grade levels. The
team saw a problem with hands-on work in
the current education system.
"There's a lot of high-level education
policymakers who in theory claim to agree
that the future of the country depends on a
workforce that's creative ... but no one's
doing anything about it," Korsunskiy said.
"As [they]'re talking about how creativity
needs to be expanded, shop classes are
being cut... so we decided: 'We are going
to do something about this.'"
When the Spark Lab team talked to
working teachers, they learned that many
lacked the time and space to emphasize
creativity in the classroom.
"We came up with the idea that maybe
we can be this mobile-tinkering field trip
that comes to you," Korsunskiy said.
Spark Lab plans to target middle school
students initially. Inside the truck, the team
will guide students through the process of
creating their own product.
Take the example of middle school stu
dents building a homemade lamp. First,
they would choose their favorite lamp de

signs. Then, they would create a rough ver
sion using materials such as Popsicle sticks
and twist ties before building a clay proto
type. At that point, the Spark Lab team
would use software called Autodesk 123 D
to photograph the clay prototype from
multiple angles, generating a three-dimen
sional model of the lamp. Finally, a 3D
printer would spit out layers of hot glue to
produce a physical copy of the lamp.
While the technology itself is impres
sive, "the most important part is for kids to
have an artifact that they can take home
and show their parents," Peck said.
The Spark Lab team also aims to balance
the expensive tools with plenty of low-tech
items of the sort that might be found in a
shop class.
The truck's physical location outside of
schools is key to the project's effectiveness.
Khalil described the classroom as a "psy
chological barrier" for some kids.
"It's not just a physical, outside space,
it's psychological space," Chua said. "Once
students step out of the classroom, it frees
them to be more creative."
Unlike a conventional startup, Spark-
Lab does not expect to generate any rev
enue. Instead, the project will rely on fund
ing from an online Kickstarter campaign
thus far, Spark Lab has raised over $7,500
toward a target of $25,000. Team members
hope to persuade tool companies to donate
expensive items such as laser cutters or 3D
printers.
Despite its promise, Spark Lab faces

some obstacles. With $25,000, the team
would only be able to afford a single truck,
limiting the number of students who could
benefit from the project. However, as Chua
emphasized, "right now, we're concentrat
ing on focused impact, rather than super
scaled impact."
In this stage of their project, the Spark-
Lab team has also been busy holding work
shops and attending interviews, and they've
found it hard to find time for introspection,
according to Korsunskiy. Nevertheless, the
Spark Lab team has been able to meet im
portant Bay Area contacts at events such as
Maker Faire, a two-day festival celebrating
creativity and hands-on making.
"It seems like we've struck a nerve
somewhere, where this idea resonates with
a lot of people," Chua said.
Among other local figures, the group
met the founder of Make, a magazine fo
cused on do-it-yourself (DIY) projects, as
well as officials from the San Francisco Ex
ploratorium, design software company Au
todesk and San Jose-based nonprofit Re
source Area For Teaching (RAFT). Re
sponses to the project have been positive.
"This is an incredibly cool idea get
ting these tools into the hands of kids!"
wrote Carl Bass, CEO of Autodesk, on
Spark Lab's Kickstarter page.
"I love the truck. This is a great way to
bring the tools and materials for making to
more young makers," wrote Dale Dougher
ty, founding editor of MAKE magazine, on
the same page.

The Spark Lab team tested out their idea
on campus last year by running design
workshops at Splash!, a program that
brings middle school, high school and un
derserved students to Stanford's campus
for two days. Working with sixth graders
and Yahoo! executives, the team was sur
prised to find that the younger students
were more creative.
