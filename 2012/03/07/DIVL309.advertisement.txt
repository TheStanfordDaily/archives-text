In December 2010, the skeletal remains of a Columbian
Mammoth (Mammuthus columbii were found in the artichoke
fields on a family farm in Castroville. An extensive team
composed of faculty and students from Foothill College,
UC Santa Cruz, San Jose State University, UCLA, DeAnza
College, UC Berkeley, Stanford, Penn State, and Santa
Clara University was invited to investigate, excavate, and
analyze this find. Directed by archaeologist Mark Hylkema,
after nearly two excavation seasons the team has retrieved
around 40 percent of the mammothâ€”a male in his late
twenties or early thirties.
In this talk, Timothy King, Anthropologist; Epigrapher;
and Co-director, Castroville Mammoth Project, will address
the methods and goals of this project, and will also review
recent developments at the site such as the other Ice Age
animals discovered there.
