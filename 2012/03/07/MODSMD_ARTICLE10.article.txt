## CYCLING TOWARD SAFETY 
### ERIKAALVERO KOSKI DESK EDITOR 
A flurry of emails circulated among the
student body earlier this quarter, sent by
students warning their peers of a recent
upsurge in biking citations by police offi
cers stationed strategically around cam
pus at various intersections. This increase was only
one part of a larger and ever-growing movement on
campus to promote bike safety.
Of the proponents of this movement, the Stan
ford Department of Public Safety (SUDPS) is a
major force.
"If you've ever been the first person to an acci
dent scene where there are serious injuries, it's pret
ty traumatic," said Deputy Allen James. "I liken it to
being in wartime because I spent two years in Viet
nam."

James
came to Stan-
ford 20 years ago
after working on the force in
the East Bay. In addition to
his other duties, he teaches
the SUDPS bicycle safety
diversion class, a one
hour class usually
taught twice a month
that allows students to
void their bicycle cita
tions in favor of bicy
cle safety education.
The $194 fine that ac
companies a bike tick
et is part of what
pushed James to become in
volved in the movement and
the class.
"I always felt so bad when
we were out here trying to enforce the law, because
I would look at the students, and I'm thinking,
'They're going to be eating Top Ramen noodles for
months to pay this stupid ticket,' because I knew
how much it was," James said.
The bike safety movement emphasizes a collab
orative effort among various departments on cam
pus. James, for example, works closely with Ariadne
Scott, bicycle coordinator at Parking and Trans
portation Services (P&TS). An avid cyclist, Scott
aims to promote bicycle usage while implementing
programs to enforce student safety. She has not
owned a car in over 23 years.
"I think bikes symbolize freedom and the power
to move and be self-propelled, ... especially with
global warming and the idea that you can actually
do something to offset that carbon [emission] by not
driving. You can have a direct [impact on] making
the world a better place," Scott said. "We want peo
ple to ride we just want people to be safe."
Some of the new measures designed to promote
safety include stronger enforcement of bike laws, a
bike safety summit in November with the Stanford
Trauma Center and signs below stop signs that read,
"Bikes are required to stop at all stop signs." P&TS
sponsored a Bike Safety Dorm Challenge this past
fall in which the winning dorm, Muwekma-tah-ruk,
won a free charter bus to Tahoe.

As a result, Stanford has been designated the
first and only Bicycle Friendly University at the
Platinum level, the highest distinction given by the
League of American Bicyclists.
Ultimately, campus administrators agree that
students must be the driving force ensuring the
movement's success in changing campus culture
especially in reducing the negative perception of
helmet use.
"All student leaders have a huge role in this, as is
true for a lot of other topics," wrote Donnovan Yis
rael 'B9, manager of Relationship and Sexual Health
Programs and member of the "I Thrive @ Stanford"
unit at Vaden Health Center, in an email to The
Daily. "If an RA [residential assistant] or PHE [peer
health educator] in an all-frosh dorm stands up and
says, 'We want you all to wear helmets and we are
going to model that by all of us wearing helmets,'
that is a powerful message."
Students with personal bike accident experience
are some of the most vocal advocates for bicycle
safety and awareness. Kali Lindsay 'l2 is one such
advocate. During her sophomore year, on her way
to an appointment with an oral communication
tutor, Lindsay was involved in a serious bike acci
dent.
"I kind of remember getting off my bed, and that
was the last thing I remembered," Lindsay said.
"The next thing I remembered, really clearly, was
my parents getting to the hospital about 2 a.m....
more than 12 hours later."

Though Lindsay was unable to recall the event
itself, witnesses later told her that she had fallen be
tween freshman dorm Larkin and Meyer
Library, hitting her head on the right
temple. She sustained epidural
hematoma, an injury in
volving bleeding be
tween the skull and brain.
The injury caused
initial short-term
memory loss and
dizziness, which
prevented her
from reading for
almost two
I months, forcing
I her to take the
rest of fall quarter
rtff

"When you're
young you think,
'Well, this can't hap
pen to me, and if it
does happen, I'll be
fine,'" Lindsay said. "I
started realizing this
is real, and this is
more than just a one
time thing ... it felt like I
couldn't control my mind
anymore."
While she was able to
return for winter quarter of
that year, it would be a year
and a half before Lindsay felt

like her former self again. She ex
perienced unexpected panic attacks in seemingly in
nocuous situations and had to undergo therapy to
overcome her emotional instability. She is now a
freshman RA and has become involved in cam
paigning for helmet usage and bike safety.
"It's hard when I still see my freshmen going
around and not wearing their helmets," Lindsay
said. "It's hard to get up every day to go to class and
see people biking without their helmets, texting [or]
riding on each other's handlebars."
She worked with both Scott and James, along
with the Office of Residential Education
(ResEd), to fund bike helmets for her entire dorm,
Larkin. The program has been expanded to fund
the purchase of helmets for all freshman dorms
and "everyone who wants them," according to
James.
While helmet usage is far from becoming the
norm, the accounts provided by students such as
Lindsay and the efforts of P&TS and the SUDPS
may be beginning to take effect.
"I've been on campus on and off since 1985, and
I've never seen this much attention being paid to
promoting helmet wearing," Yisrael said. "I'm hop
ing that we are reaching a 'critical mass."'

Biking has been a part of Stanford's culture for over 100 years, as proven by a group of bicyclists dubbed
"the Encina wheelmen," seen here posing in front of Encina Hall in 1891, when the hall was first opened.
