# JENNIFER SUMMIT
## RENAISSANCE WOMAN 
### JUSTINE ZHANG 
The objects scattered
around Jennifer Sum
mit's office give glimpses
of the English professor's
interests. Framed me
dieval images embellish the walls,
and on the bookshelf, nestled be
tween volumes of Chaucer's "Can
terbury Tales," are her own two
award-winning books on medieval
and Renaissance literature. A book
mark for the "What is a Reader?"
project, which she directs, sits on the
desk next to a folder from the Study
of Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES), on which she
serves as a committee member.
"The work that I do is about
reading and writing, the history of
literature, the history of books and
how people use them," Summit
said. Much of her academic efforts
branch out from this fascination
with the trends surrounding the lit
erary process.
Summit grew up around the
Stanford campus and witnessed the
great technological changes that
came with the rise of Silicon Valley.
"I remember growing up as a
reader at the same time computers
started infiltrating Silicon Valley,"
she said. "A lot of the questions
I'm interested in ... come out of
that personal wonder about media
and the difference it makes."
As an undergraduate at Vassar
College in New York, Summit
started reading medieval literature
and was immediately drawn in.
"[Medieval literature] blew me
away because it was so resistant to
change," Summit said. "In order to
make sense of it, you had to put
yourself in a completely different
place intellectually."
Summit's training in both me
dieval and Renaissance literature
is unique among scholars, giving
her a distinct perspective on early
modern texts. Her research focus
es on cultural change through liter
ature. One concept that particular
ly fascinates her is the transition
from manuscript to print culture.
"Before print culture, manu
script was a form of both personal
and mass production," she said.
With the popularization of the
printing press as the prevalent
mode for mass production of texts,
the manuscript was relegated to
being a much more personal means
of communication a change re
flected in the Renaissance fascina
tion with the individualized nature
of handwriting.
The questions Summit poses in
her study of early literature are re
capitulated in her "What is a Read
er?" project, which examines cur
rent trends in undergraduate litera
cy. She directs this project in collab
oration with UC-Berkeley and UC-
Santa Cruz. One study within the
project contrasted how undergrad
uate students read on a physical
page versus on a computer screen.
This was partly in response to a sim
ilar National Endowment for the
Arts study that concluded that,
given new online modes of reading,

undergraduate students are experi
encing a crisis in literacy. Summit's
study provided a less dire conclu
sion.
"Page literacy seems to be good
for intensive [detailed] reading,
while screen literacy is good for ex
tensive reading or skimming," Sum
mit said.
She argued that the transition in
modes of reading, like the change
from manuscript to print, does not
destroy the original medium, but
simply redefines it.
Summit has received many ac
colades for her research.
"She is among the most admired
scholars under 50 worldwide in
both fields [of medieval and Ren
aissance literature]," wrote fellow
English Prof. Roland Greene in an
email to The Daily.
Summit's work has redefined
the core of the English major. She
was chair of the English Depart
ment when the new core was imple
mented, adding a core sequence of
literary history.
"[She] was its author as much as
anyone can be," Greene said of
Summit's role in the new curricu
lum. "Her chairmanship was char
acterized by a deeper attention to
the undergraduate curriculum,
which is undoubtedly a result of her
commitment to undergraduate ed
ucation."
Summit's passion for teaching
provides an outlet for her boundless
ideas and energy. In previous quar
ters she has taught the literary histo
ry core, offering classes such as a
workshop in paleography, the study
of old texts, as a complement to her
research interests.
"I'm really interested in devel
oping classes on the history of read
ing and writing, conceived as a long
history that includes the present,"
Summit said.
Summit's ability to integrate her
research with her teaching im
presses both students and fellow
faculty.
"Her teaching absorbs her re
search interests very well," Greene
said. "Students get the benefit of
hearing a scholar thinking on her
feet about her current work."
Bridget Whearty, a doctoral can
didate in the English department
and Summit's advisee, has served as
Summit's teaching assistant.
"Jennifer [Summit] encourages
me to see all the work that profes
sors do teaching, research and
service to the University and their
professional organizations in
harmony rather than in conflict,"
Whearty wrote in an email to The
Daily. "She is passionate about con
necting her research to her teaching
in ways that invite her students to
share in the labor of intellectual dis
covery."
For Summit, her intellectual cu
riosity is constantly driven by her
research and teaching.
"I'm always surprised by my re
search," she said. "I think that when
you stop being surprised by your re
search, it's time to stop."

"Jennifer [Summit] encourages
me to see all the work that profes
sors do teaching, research and
service to the University and their
professional organizations in
harmony rather than in conflict,"
Whearty wrote in an email to The
Daily. "She is passionate about con
necting her research to her teaching
in ways that invite her students to
share in the labor of intellectual dis
covery."
For Summit, her intellectual cu
riosity is constantly driven by her
research and teaching.
"I'm always surprised by my re
search," she said. "I think that when
you stop being surprised by your re
search, it's time to stop."

The objects scattered
around Jennifer Sum
mit's office give glimpses
of the English professor's
interests. Framed me
dieval images embellish the walls,
and on the bookshelf, nestled be
tween volumes of Chaucer's "Can
terbury Tales," are her own two
award-winning books on medieval
and Renaissance literature. A book
mark for the "What is a Reader?"
project, which she directs, sits on the
desk next to a folder from the Study
of Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES), on which she
serves as a committee member.
"The work that I do is about
reading and writing, the history of
literature, the history of books and
how people use them," Summit
said. Much of her academic efforts
branch out from this fascination
with the trends surrounding the lit
erary process.
Summit grew up around the
Stanford campus and witnessed the
great technological changes that
came with the rise of Silicon Valley.
"I remember growing up as a
reader at the same time computers
started infiltrating Silicon Valley,"
she said. "A lot of the questions
I'm interested in ... come out of
that personal wonder about media
and the difference it makes."
As an undergraduate at Vassar
College in New York, Summit
started reading medieval literature
and was immediately drawn in.
"[Medieval literature] blew me
away because it was so resistant to
change," Summit said. "In order to
make sense of it, you had to put
yourself in a completely different
place intellectually."
Summit's training in both me
dieval and Renaissance literature
is unique among scholars, giving
her a distinct perspective on early
modern texts. Her research focus
es on cultural change through liter
ature. One concept that particular
ly fascinates her is the transition
from manuscript to print culture.
"Before print culture, manu
script was a form of both personal
and mass production," she said.
With the popularization of the
printing press as the prevalent
mode for mass production of texts,
the manuscript was relegated to
being a much more personal means
of communication a change re
flected in the Renaissance fascina
tion with the individualized nature
of handwriting.
The questions Summit poses in
her study of early literature are re
capitulated in her "What is a Read
er?" project, which examines cur
rent trends in undergraduate litera
cy. She directs this project in collab
oration with UC-Berkeley and UC-
Santa Cruz. One study within the
project contrasted how undergrad
uate students read on a physical
page versus on a computer screen.
This was partly in response to a sim
ilar National Endowment for the
Arts study that concluded that,
given new online modes of reading,

undergraduate students are experi
encing a crisis in literacy. Summit's
study provided a less dire conclu
sion.
"Page literacy seems to be good
for intensive [detailed] reading,
while screen literacy is good for ex
tensive reading or skimming," Sum
mit said.
She argued that the transition in
modes of reading, like the change
from manuscript to print, does not
destroy the original medium, but
simply redefines it.
Summit has received many ac
colades for her research.
"She is among the most admired
scholars under 50 worldwide in
both fields [of medieval and Ren
aissance literature]," wrote fellow
English Prof. Roland Greene in an
email to The Daily.
Summit's work has redefined
the core of the English major. She
was chair of the English Depart
ment when the new core was imple
mented, adding a core sequence of
literary history.
"[She] was its author as much as
anyone can be," Greene said of
Summit's role in the new curricu
lum. "Her chairmanship was char
acterized by a deeper attention to
the undergraduate curriculum,
which is undoubtedly a result of her
commitment to undergraduate ed
ucation."
Summit's passion for teaching
provides an outlet for her boundless
ideas and energy. In previous quar
ters she has taught the literary histo
ry core, offering classes such as a
workshop in paleography, the study
of old texts, as a complement to her
research interests.
"I'm really interested in devel
oping classes on the history of read
ing and writing, conceived as a long
history that includes the present,"
Summit said.
Summit's ability to integrate her
research with her teaching im
presses both students and fellow
faculty.
"Her teaching absorbs her re
search interests very well," Greene
said. "Students get the benefit of
hearing a scholar thinking on her
feet about her current work."
Bridget Whearty, a doctoral can
didate in the English department
and Summit's advisee, has served as
Summit's teaching assistant.
