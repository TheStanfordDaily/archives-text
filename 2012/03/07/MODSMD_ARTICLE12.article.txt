## EDITORIAL SUES report right to call for mandatory IntroSems 
### 
One of the more hotly de
bated changes recom
mended by the Study of
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES) report suggests
that all freshmen be required to
take one Introductory Seminar
(IntroSem). The response to this
recommendation was swift, with
current ASSU Senator Daniel De-
Long 'l3, currently mounting a
campaign for ASSU vice presi
dent, publicly labeling it as "one of
the most destructive recommen
dations that emerged from the
SUES report."
Some students agreed with
DeLong, arguing that a mandate
would transform IntroSems into
something resented by under
graduates, much like the Intro
duction to Humanities (IHUM)
requirement. However, this argu
ment ignores several key aspects
of both the existing and recom
mended structure of IntroSems.
This Editorial Board believes that
requiring IntroSems will enhance
the overall quality of undergradu
ate education at Stanford.
The benefits of Introductory
Seminars are numerous, includ
ing close interaction with faculty,
the opportunity to explore a spe
cific interest in-depth and the de
velopment of a network of peers
with similar interests. IHUM
struggled in part because its edu
cational format limited these op
portunities, with students placed
in large lectures and given rela
tively little choice as to the topic
of exploration.
The argument that suggests
Stanford students resent classes
merely because they are mandat
ed is also flawed. The Program in
Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) re
quires two classes, but is general
ly well regarded due to the semi
nar environment and the variety
of course topics that fulfill the re
quirement. The Introductory
Seminar requirement would
offer a similar breadth of choice,
with students able to choose from
seminars in the humanities, sci
ences, engineering and social sci
ences.
Statistics also don't seem to
support the fears of IntroSem de

tractors. Every year, 2,300 fresh
men and sophomores, or 70 per
cent, take an Introductory Semi
nar. Given that these courses are
so popular already, it would seem
plausible that many students who
do not take an Introductory Sem
inar are interested in taking one
but do not have the time, a prob
lem that is particularly acute
among athletes and STEM ma
jors. By paring down the length of
IHUM to a one-quarter Thinking
Matters course and diversifying
class times, the SUES report rec
ommendations create the struc
ture necessary to give the remain
ing 30 percent of students an op
portunity to take an IntroSem.
This is not to say that there will
not be challenges in expanding
the Introductory Seminars pro
gram, including ensuring a truly
diversified set of classes to appeal
to a variety of student interests,
maintaining adequate funding
and providing incentives for fac
ulty whose IntroSem responsibil
ities may take them away from
teaching larger lectures and high
er-level courses. Some say that a
mandate will lead to more apa
thetic students taking Introducto
ry Seminars, lowering the overall
quality of the classroom environ
ment. However, these arguments
are predicated on condescending
assumptions of Stanford students
and faculty as unmotivated and
disengaged, a fundamentally
flawed premise. Students, faculty
and staff at Stanford are here to
engage deeply on the most excit
ing intellectual ideas of the day,
and the structure of an Introduc
tory Seminar offers an ideal
mechanism through which fresh
man can join the vibrant intellec
tual culture on campus.
As an institution, Stanford
does not shy away from chal
lenges, and closing the gap of In
troSem participation is well with
in the realm of Stanford's capabil
ity. The benefits of an Introducto
ry Seminar are tremendous, and
in mandating that all freshmen
take one, the SUES report en
sures that all students will access
an exciting intellectual opportu
nity in their first year at Stanford.
