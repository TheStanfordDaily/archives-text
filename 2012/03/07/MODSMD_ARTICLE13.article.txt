# RAVALATIONS
## (Not) crying out for help 
### Ravali Reddy 
I can't remember exactly what it
is, but there's some statistic that
gets thrown around a lot during
New Student Orientation (NSO)
about what percentage of Stanford
students say that they have, at some
point or another, felt as though they
didn't belong at Stanford. It's one
that most people tend to shrug off
the first few times they hear it, my
self included. When we're first pre
sented with that statistic, as new
Stanford students, most of us are too
busy feeling like we're on top of the
world to take it seriously.
But then, one day, right in the
midst of your busy Stanford life, it
hits you in the gut, and you sudden
ly come across a horrible feeling:
you feel overwhelmed.
I don't think there's anything
worse than feeling overwhelmed. It
has stages, just like grief, and experi
ence has taught me that the first is
always denial. When I start to feel
overwhelmed, I deny it so fiercely
that, for an hour or two, I actually
manage to convince myself that I'm
actually underwhelmed. I tell my
self that I'm worried for no reason,
that everything is fine, and that,
worst-case scenario, I can just not
sleep for a day or two to get every
thing done.
I don't think this stage has ever
lasted longer than a few hours, be
cause following in its footsteps is the
dawn of realization: that awful mo
ment when you hit the wall that's

made up of all the books, papers and
extracurricular activities waiting to
be completed. The denial melts
away and is replaced by a strange
sense of shock you're surprised
that you have so much to do, but
you're also surprised that you didn't
realize it earlier.
Then comes the anger, which is
mainly directed inwards. I become
angry at myself for signing up for
too many classes, for not spending
all my waking hours in the library,
for making too many promises, for
having gone out on Friday night, for
watching that movie when I should
have been reading and for spending
time with my best friend when I
should have been writing. I'm even
mad at myself for writing this col
umn when I should be studying for
chemistry.
It's easy to get consumed in these
moments (particularly as the week
nine midterms and finals begin to
loom ominously in the forefront of
your thoughts). I'm as guilty as
everyone else is, but what's impor
tant to remember is that these ob
stacles are not the end of the world,
and that maneuvering through

them is actually feasible. All you
have to do is remember that college
is about more than the numbers on
our p-sets and tests. It's about more
than beating the average. It's the
one time in our lives when we're sur
rounded by fascinating people with
a variety of talents and interests,
people who can be great resources
when trying to deal with what seems
like impending defeat.
Thought I sometimes have diffi
culty admitting it, I'm saying it now:
it's okay to ask for help.
I know, it seems like such an ob
vious solution, but I feel like it's one
that is often overlooked. The simple

fact of the matter is that everyone
has different strengths, and that it's
totally acceptable to ask a peer to
help you out with something that
may not be your strong point. Sure,
asking for help does mean admit
ting that something isn't your forte,
but it's important to realize that ask
ing for help isn't the same as giving
up. Giving up is considered a weak
ness, but asking for help simply
means that you have developed a
self-awareness that is going to help
you grow.
So, next time you feel stressed
out, remind yourself that there's
nothing wrong with taking a mo

ment or two to relax and reassess
the situation to find out where you
can turn for help. Despite what you
may think, no one expects you to be
Superman or grow an extra pair of
arms (although if you have either of
these skills, I would really appreci
ate a tutorial in how to go about get
ting them myself), so just breathe,
pat yourself on the back and re
member that at least we have sun
shine!

self included. When we're first pre
sented with that statistic, as new
Stanford students, most of us are too
busy feeling like we're on top of the
world to take it seriously.
But then, one day, right in the
midst of your busy Stanford life, it
hits you in the gut, and you sudden
ly come across a horrible feeling:
you feel overwhelmed.
I don't think there's anything
worse than feeling overwhelmed. It
has stages, just like grief, and experi
ence has taught me that the first is
always denial. When I start to feel
overwhelmed, I deny it so fiercely
that, for an hour or two, I actually
manage to convince myself that I'm
actually underwhelmed. I tell my
self that I'm worried for no reason,
that everything is fine, and that,
worst-case scenario, I can just not
sleep for a day or two to get every
thing done.
I don't think this stage has ever
lasted longer than a few hours, be
cause following in its footsteps is the
dawn of realization: that awful mo
ment when you hit the wall that's

made up of all the books, papers and
extracurricular activities waiting to
be completed. The denial melts
away and is replaced by a strange
sense of shock you're surprised
that you have so much to do, but
you're also surprised that you didn't
realize it earlier.
Then comes the anger, which is
mainly directed inwards. I become
angry at myself for signing up for
too many classes, for not spending
all my waking hours in the library,
for making too many promises, for
having gone out on Friday night, for
watching that movie when I should
have been reading and for spending
time with my best friend when I
should have been writing. I'm even
mad at myself for writing this col
umn when I should be studying for
chemistry.
It's easy to get consumed in these
moments (particularly as the week
nine midterms and finals begin to
loom ominously in the forefront of
your thoughts). I'm as guilty as
everyone else is, but what's impor
tant to remember is that these ob
stacles are not the end of the world,
and that maneuvering through

them is actually feasible. All you
have to do is remember that college
is about more than the numbers on
our p-sets and tests. It's about more
than beating the average. It's the
one time in our lives when we're sur
rounded by fascinating people with
a variety of talents and interests,
people who can be great resources
when trying to deal with what seems
like impending defeat.
Thought I sometimes have diffi
culty admitting it, I'm saying it now:
it's okay to ask for help.
I know, it seems like such an ob
vious solution, but I feel like it's one
that is often overlooked. The simple

fact of the matter is that everyone
has different strengths, and that it's
totally acceptable to ask a peer to
help you out with something that
may not be your strong point. Sure,
asking for help does mean admit
ting that something isn't your forte,
but it's important to realize that ask
ing for help isn't the same as giving
up. Giving up is considered a weak
ness, but asking for help simply
means that you have developed a
self-awareness that is going to help
you grow.
So, next time you feel stressed
out, remind yourself that there's
nothing wrong with taking a mo

ment or two to relax and reassess
the situation to find out where you
can turn for help. Despite what you
may think, no one expects you to be
Superman or grow an extra pair of
arms (although if you have either of
these skills, I would really appreci
ate a tutorial in how to go about get
ting them myself), so just breathe,
pat yourself on the back and re
member that at least we have sun
shine!

Ravali is serious about learning to
grow an extra pair of arms. If you
think you can help her, send her an
