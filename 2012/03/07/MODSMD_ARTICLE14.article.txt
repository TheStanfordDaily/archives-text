# BURSTING THE BUBBLE
## Time for the GOP to stand up to Rush

▼ Y Susan Fluke who
goes before congressional commit
tee and essentially says that she
must be paid to have sex? It makes
her a slut, right?" Rush Limbaugh
said on his radio show on March 1.
"It makes her a prostitute."
Never mind that his faux out
rage is groundless; never mind that
he can't even be bothered to get
her name right.
Sandra, a third-year George
town law student, was rejected as a
witness late last month on a con
gressional hearing on Obamacare's
contraception mandate.
Never mind and this may be
difficult his level of obscenity
and amount of vitriol personally di
rected at an innocent student.
Never mind that this episode
has brought Mr. Limbaugh to a
new low, which is really saying a lot
because we certainly know better
than to expect more from this
shock jock overstaying his wel
come.
Let's talk for a moment about
the pushback or lack thereof
against Mr. Limbaugh from promi
nent Republicans.
John Boehner, the highest
ranking Republican in Congress,
believes his "use of words was inap
propriate," leading George Will,
the most sensible conservative
voice in media today, to compare
the impotent denunciation to
"using the salad fork for your en
tree."
"An entertainer can be absurd,"
said Rick Santorum, presidential
candidate and culture warrior, al
most defending Mr. Limbaugh in
the context of his niche in the party.
He "cringed" at the comments, he
said.
What a pathetically cringe-wor
thy response.
And of course, Newt Gingrich
did what he does best. "I am aston
ished at the desperation of the elite

media to avoid rising gas prices ...
and to suddenly decide that Rush
Limbaugh is the great national cri
sis of the week," he said in trade
mark jackass style on Sunday.
However, the very worst re
sponse came from the once-sensible
Mitt Romney, who said Rush's des
picable "slut" comment was "not
the language I would have used."
Perhaps his comment isn't the worst
based on what was uttered, but it be
comes so knowing whose mouth the
comment came from.
Mr. Romney is the last of the
presidential contenders for whom
there was hope to find the bright,
sensible center. It is now painfully
evident that he extinguished this
flickering candle many months
ago.
And what could he possibly be
afraid of? A radio host who has
pushed himself further and further
away from relevance (and sanity)
has just personally attacked a col
lege student. The press asks you for
a reaction. Why would you not
offer an unqualified condemnation
of this abuse abuse far better
suited to "Mean Girls" than our na
tional discourse?
Because, of course, this isn't any
radio host. His name is Rush Lim
baugh, and though he no longer
represents the GOP like Ed
Schultz would have you believe, he
somehow still has enough clout for
politicians to think they need him.
The fact of the matter is that
they don't. "Republican leaders...
don't have the courage to say what
they say in quiet. Which [is that]
Rush Limbaugh is a buffoon," said
political analyst Matthew Dowd.
"Nobody takes him seriously."
Certainly in this pandering mess
of a presidential field, no one has the
courage to step up and reject Lim
baugh's blubbering buffoonery.
As advertisers flee from his
show as if it were contagious no
fewer than 25 businesses have
pulled their material at press time

Mr. Limbaugh may have finally
succumbed to some of the pressure
put on him in quiet.
"My choice of words was not
the best," he said in a statement on
Saturday. And how pathetic his
'apology' was: qualified, nitpicking
ly specific, reeking of insincerity.
His "attempt to be hilarious"
belied his disgusting diction; his
characterization of Ms. Fluke's
"personal sexual recreational ac
tivities" belied any basis of fact.
"My choice of words was not
the best."
As walking yawn-fest Mitt
Romney begins to pull away from
his competitors in the presidential
field, perhaps we should remember
the choice of words he offered up
when asked to remark on Rush
Limbaugh.
It was "not the language I would
have used," he said.
How sad is the state of affairs
when the plausible 45th president
of the United States spits out an
apology for Rush Limbaugh that so
closely resembles the fringe fanat
ic's own comment, he wouldn't
even hurdle the bar for academic
plagiarism.
If Mr. Romney had any courage
at all, he would have stood up to
Rush Limbaugh and firmly, un
equivocally denounced him.
Perhaps he does have that
courage.
Too bad what came out of his
mouth wasn't the language he
should have used.

have used? Email him at

gressional hearing on Obamacare's
contraception mandate.
Never mind and this may be
difficult his level of obscenity
and amount of vitriol personally di
rected at an innocent student.
Never mind that this episode
has brought Mr. Limbaugh to a
new low, which is really saying a lot
because we certainly know better
than to expect more from this
shock jock overstaying his wel
come.
Let's talk for a moment about
the pushback or lack thereof
against Mr. Limbaugh from promi
nent Republicans.
John Boehner, the highest
ranking Republican in Congress,
believes his "use of words was inap
propriate," leading George Will,
the most sensible conservative
voice in media today, to compare
the impotent denunciation to
"using the salad fork for your en
tree."
"An entertainer can be absurd,"
said Rick Santorum, presidential
candidate and culture warrior, al
most defending Mr. Limbaugh in
the context of his niche in the party.
He "cringed" at the comments, he
said.
What a pathetically cringe-wor
thy response.
And of course, Newt Gingrich
did what he does best. "I am aston
ished at the desperation of the elite

media to avoid rising gas prices ...
and to suddenly decide that Rush
Limbaugh is the great national cri
sis of the week," he said in trade
mark jackass style on Sunday.
However, the very worst re
sponse came from the once-sensible
Mitt Romney, who said Rush's des
picable "slut" comment was "not
the language I would have used."
Perhaps his comment isn't the worst
based on what was uttered, but it be
comes so knowing whose mouth the
comment came from.
Mr. Romney is the last of the
presidential contenders for whom
there was hope to find the bright,
sensible center. It is now painfully
evident that he extinguished this
flickering candle many months
ago.
And what could he possibly be
afraid of? A radio host who has
pushed himself further and further
away from relevance (and sanity)
has just personally attacked a col
lege student. The press asks you for
a reaction. Why would you not
offer an unqualified condemnation
of this abuse abuse far better
suited to "Mean Girls" than our na
tional discourse?
Because, of course, this isn't any
radio host. His name is Rush Lim
baugh, and though he no longer
represents the GOP like Ed
Schultz would have you believe, he
somehow still has enough clout for
politicians to think they need him.
The fact of the matter is that
they don't. "Republican leaders...
don't have the courage to say what
they say in quiet. Which [is that]
Rush Limbaugh is a buffoon," said
political analyst Matthew Dowd.
"Nobody takes him seriously."
Certainly in this pandering mess
of a presidential field, no one has the
courage to step up and reject Lim
baugh's blubbering buffoonery.
As advertisers flee from his
show as if it were contagious no
fewer than 25 businesses have
pulled their material at press time

Mr. Limbaugh may have finally
succumbed to some of the pressure
put on him in quiet.
"My choice of words was not
the best," he said in a statement on
Saturday. And how pathetic his
'apology' was: qualified, nitpicking
ly specific, reeking of insincerity.
His "attempt to be hilarious"
belied his disgusting diction; his
characterization of Ms. Fluke's
"personal sexual recreational ac
tivities" belied any basis of fact.
"My choice of words was not
the best."
As walking yawn-fest Mitt
Romney begins to pull away from
his competitors in the presidential
field, perhaps we should remember
the choice of words he offered up
when asked to remark on Rush
Limbaugh.
It was "not the language I would
have used," he said.
How sad is the state of affairs
when the plausible 45th president
of the United States spits out an
apology for Rush Limbaugh that so
closely resembles the fringe fanat
ic's own comment, he wouldn't
even hurdle the bar for academic
plagiarism.
If Mr. Romney had any courage
at all, he would have stood up to
Rush Limbaugh and firmly, un
equivocally denounced him.
Perhaps he does have that
courage.
Too bad what came out of his
mouth wasn't the language he
should have used.

£ £ ~w That does it say about

▼ Y Susan Fluke who
goes before congressional commit
tee and essentially says that she
must be paid to have sex? It makes
her a slut, right?" Rush Limbaugh
said on his radio show on March 1.
"It makes her a prostitute."
Never mind that his faux out
rage is groundless; never mind that
he can't even be bothered to get
her name right.
