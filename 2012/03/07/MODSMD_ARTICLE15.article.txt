## Must-win March for women 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
There's home-court ad
vantage, and then there's
what the 2012 class of
Stanford women's bas
ketball accomplished in
its four years on the Farm.
Before we laud our departing
players for what has been one of the
most dominant runs by a group of
seniors in the history of the sport,
it's important to put Stanford's ac
colades in context. The fact that this
information isn't widely known
speaks volumes to the distance
women's sports still needs to travel,
but it doesn't downplay just how
unbelievably remarkable this team
has been under head coach Tara
VanDerveer.
With a road win over California
this past weekend, Stanford cap
tured the inaugural Pac-12 champi
onship, a fitting reward for the team
that has won the past 12 conference
titles. In fact, the last loss to a league
opponent took place Jan. 18,2009,
when the Golden Bears bested the
Cardinal in Berkeley. The squad
hasn't lost to its most hated rival in
the eight meetings since. On a larg
er scale, Stanford has reached the
NCAA tournament every year
since 1988 and has made the Final
Four 10 times since 1990.
It's safe to say that things could
be worse.
Now back to the elder
stateswomen. In their 64 games in
Maples Pavilion since arriving on
campus in the fall of 2008, the Stan
ford seniors have won 64 times. For
those sabermetricians at home, that
is a grand total of zero losses. Those
64 contests are part of a 79-game
home wining streak that dates all
the way back to the 2007-08 season.
In the past four seasons, the seniors
have notched a ridiculous regular
season record of 108-8, an astound
ing mark by any measure.
With three consecutive Final
Four appearances and more indi
vidual awards than can fit into any
respectably sized trophy case, Stan
ford is once again primed to earn a
No. 1 seed in the NCAA tourna
ment and make a compelling run at
a national title, the only achieve
ment missing from an otherwise
flawless four years in Palo Alto.
While basketball is traditionally
a male-dominated sport, this group
of seniors has kept Maples from de
teriorating into a lifeless venue. The
women regularly attract more fans
than their male counterparts, and
although the faces in the crowd may
be a bit more wrinkled, you'd be
hard pressed to find more knowl
edgeable and passionate fans in the
Bay Area. For all the attention (de
servedly) devoted to the success of
Cardinal football, women's basket
ball has quietly remained the pre
mium model of athletic consistency,
more so than any other contributor
to the oft-mentioned 17 consecu
tive Directors' Cups.
Yet despite all their success, the
fact of the matter is that the absence
of a competitive men's team has de
moted basketball into the role of
second fiddle on this campus. While
this is a ludicrous thought for any
pre-Harbaugh student, it's some
thing that's accepted as universal
truth by all others. Has the recent
lack of hoops awareness cast an all
too-unfair shadow over the illustri
ous careers of some of the school's
best athletes? You tell me how
many other 800-game winners have
failed to make national headlines.
But this year can be different. It
has to be. Four straight agonizing
trips to the Final Four must amount
to more than just free T-shirts and
unrelenting disappointment. Cardi
nal fans can't bear another Fiesta
Bowl moment, where a victory sure
to resonate throughout the country
was ripped out of our hands. Stan
ford women's basketball can't be
relegated back to the shadows, not
when surrounded by a fan base beg
ging for an injection of elation.
Maybe it's inappropriate to de
mand a title this year. After all, it's
impossible to knock a coach with a
quarter-century of service under
her belt and a team that has made a
permanent home atop the AP
standings. Plus, even if the Card
can't get it done this year, we know
that any and all vacancies will be
filled with the best talent that lega
cy can find.
Good luck telling that to the
