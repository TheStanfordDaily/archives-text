# ONE FINAL SHOT
## DO OR DIE FOR MEN'S HOOPS 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
It's finally March, which, in the world of
college basketball, can only mean one thing:
it's tournament time.
In the next two weeks, all of NCAA Divi
sion I conferences will host their league tour
naments, with the winners of each guaranteed
a spot in the Big Dance. For Stanford, and
possibly every other team in the infamously
weak Pac-12, winning the conference tourna
ment is the only way in.This week is do-or-die
for the Cardinal, as a loss means the Card
goes home.
Stanford (20-10,10-8 Pac-12) travels down
to Los Angeles as the No. 7 seed to take on No.
10 Arizona State (10-20, 6-12 Pac-12) at the
Staples Center. On paper, the Cardinal's first
matchup appears to be favorable. But as Stan
ford has learned time and time again this year,
no conference opponent can be overlooked.
The Cardinal delivered one of its best de
fensive performances of the year the first and
only time these two teams met at Maples
Pavilion this season. Stanford held the Sun
Devils to a meager 44 points on just 34 per
cent shooting.The Card also grabbed 15 more
rebounds than Arizona State, using its athleti
cism on the blocks to outwork ASU. The
freshman-sophomore backcourt of Chasson
Randle and Aaron Bright were nearly un
stoppable, scoring a combined 30 points on
12-of-23 shooting. Bright, who led all scorers
with 16, added four assists to help lead the
Card to a 68-44 victory.
Much of Stanford's focus this time around
will be on stopping Arizona State's monster
in the middle, 7-foot-2 center Jordan Bachyn
ski. Bachynski, although not considered
much of a scoring threat, torched the Card in
the paint for a game-high 20 points despite
averaging just 5.8 per night.
The matchup at the Staples Center will be
different than the one at Maples, as Arizona
State will be playing with junior guard Trent
Lockett, who was sidelined in the first meet
ing with an ankle injury. Although his six
game hiatus hurt Lockett's play, he has re
cently regained the midseason form that al
lowed him to lead the Sun Devils in scoring.
In the team's most recent matchup against
Arizona, Lockett scored a team-high 21
points on 6-of-12 shooting.
Both teams are riding positive momentum
heading into the conference tournament, as
both are coming off upset wins in big rivalry
games.
Stanford ended Cal's hopes of a regular
season Pac-12 title in a shocking 75-70 victo
ry, as the Card was finally able to pull out a

close game that came down to the wire,
thanks in large part to two offensive re
bounds from Bright in the final minute. Down
in the Grand Canyon State, the Sun Devils re
deemed themselves by avenging an early
season blowout, defeating Arizona in a sur
prising 87-80 win.
Stanford and Arizona State have had sim
ilar seasons that began with high hopes but
ended with disappointment. However, the
Card players are confident heading into the

tournament, and after upending Cal, there is
no reason to believe they can't make a run at
a conference championship. A win against the
Sun Devils would mean another date with
Cal, a game that would have major postsea
son implications.
The Card will look to keep its season alive
tonight at 6 p.m. in the Staples Center.
