# MIDWEEK BREEZE

### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford baseball team won its
third midweek game of the season Tuesday af
ternoon at Saint Mary's, as three Cardinal
pitchers held the Gaels to just five total hits in a
5-0 victory for the squad's second shutout in
three games.
Stanford (11-1) got three-hit performances
from junior centerfielder Jake Stewart and jun
ior third baseman Stephen Piscotty on a day
when the Cardinal's top five batters each came
around to score once against the Gaels (8-5).
The Cardinal opened the scoring in the first
inning for the eighth time this season, a particu
larly impressive stat because Stanford has yet
to allow an opponent to bring home a runner in
the opening frame. Sophomore lefthander Ben
Griset struggled with his command for Saint
Mary's, and despite having given up just three
walks and posting a 1.38 ERA in his 13 previous
innings of work, he loaded the bases with Stan
ford's first three batters of the game. Junior
Kenny Diekroeger singled home Stewart and

junior leftfielder Tyler Gaffney with one out to
make it 2-0, a strong start to the second base
man's two-hit, three-RBI performance.
The Gaels threatened with a baserunner of
their own in the first, as sophomore Ricky Boas
reached on an error, advanced on a groundout
and then stole third with just one out, but Stan
ford sophomore A.J. Vanegas got out of the in
ning unscathed.
The afternoon quickly turned into a bounce
back outing for the righthander, who came into
the matchup with five earned runs to his name
in only 3.1 innings pitched this season. He
struck out the side in the bottom of the third
against the top of the Saint Mary's lineup and
added two more punchouts over his five innings
of three-hit work to earn the win, his first deci
sion of the season.
Stanford's bats were also held relatively
quiet in the early going, however, as the squad
stranded three runners in scoring position be
tween the second and fourth frames.
