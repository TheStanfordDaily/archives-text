## Pechanec, Card cruise to victory 
### CONNOR SCHERER STAFF WRITER 
In the final regular-season meet at
Burnham Pavilion of her career, senior
Nicole Pechanec made sure to go out with
a bang, as she won the overall competition
with a career-best score of 39.450 points.
She helped the No. 11 Cardinal earn its
best score of the season (196.575) as well
as the double victory against No. 17 Ari
zona (195.025) and No. 47 Cal (191.450).
It was a day of record breaking for
Stanford, which ended up setting 15 sea
son-best and eight career-best scores by
the end of the afternoon to extend its
streak to 34 straight victories against con
ference opponents at home. The team has
now won 26 straight meets over Cal,
which hasn't beaten the Cardinal since
2000.
Starting on vault, freshman Ivana
Hong's 9.900 led Stanford to a 49.200,
0.100 points shy of its season-best score in
the event. Hong's performance ac
counted for one of five scores of
9.900 or above for the Cardinal.
Pechanec put up a 9.825 for the
Cardinal, which got out to an early
0.375-point lead over second-place
Arizona.
Entering the meet in the top 10
nationally in uneven bars, Stanford
tied its season-best score in the
event with a 49.400, the same score
the team put up last time it faced

Cal on Feb. 12. Pechanec led the
charge, posting a 9.925 in the event
for only the second time all season
(the last time being against Cal as
well).
The Cardinal managed to win
the beam event despite four of its
six competitors scoring under
9.800 and the team finishing shy of
49.000. Sophomore Amanda Spin
ner won the event once again,
recording a 9.850. Pechanec fol
lowed close behind with a 9.800.
The Cardinal sealed the victory
on the floor exercise, tying its sec
ond-best score of the season with a
49.000. Junior Ashley Morgan
highlighted the event, scoring a ca

reer-high 9.950, the best individual
score in any event all season for
Stanford. Pechanec put up her sec
ond score of 9.900 or better in the
event to round out her career-best
performance.
Seniors Jenny Peter and Alyssa
Brown were also honored and
helped the Cardinal improve to 9-3
on the season. The Stanford
women compete next against Ari
zona State on Friday.
Though posting a season-high
score for the second straight week,
the No. 4 Stanford men's gymnas
tics team lost to No. 1 Oklahoma
for the second time this season. The
Cardinal was hoping to exact re
venge for a loss to Oklahoma in
Berkeley earlier this season, but
the Stanford effort ultimately fell
short, losing to the Sooners
356.950-351.400.
After the first two rounds, the
Cardinal had a 0.200-point lead.
The early going was highlighted by
junior Eddie Penev's 15.900 in the
floor exercise, which earned him
second in the event. Freshman
Sean Senters also put up an im
pressive score, but his 15.200 was
not enough as the team lost the
event, 60.050-59.950. It was
on the pommel horse where the
Cardinal made up its deficit, capi
talizing on a poor performance by
the Sooners. Stanford turned a
0.100-point deficit into a 0.200-
point lead with a 58.550 on pom
mel horse, led by junior John Mar
tin, who won the event with a
15.250.
However, Oklahoma took ad
vantage of the rings in the third
round to regain the lead a lead it
would not surrender for the rest of
the meet. Although junior James
Fosco earned the victory in the
event with a score of 15.600, the
Sooners outscored the Cardinal
60.550 to 58.550 to hold a 1.800-
point lead going into the fourth
round.
The Sooners were able to ex
pand their lead, as Stanford score's
dropped in the final few rounds to
let Oklahoma run away with it.
Penev would ultimately finish sec
ond overall with a score of 87.900.
The loss dropped the Cardinal
to 4-5 on the season, but the team is
improving its score each week and
looks poised to make a surge with
playoffs around the corner. The
team has two meets this coming
weekend, as it competes at Ohio
State on Friday and at the Univer
sity of Illinois-Chicago on Sunday.

Senior Nicole Pechanec finished her career in Burnham Pavilion in dominant
fashion, recording a career-best score of 39.450 in a double
victory for the No. 11 Stanford women's gymnastics team.
In the final regular-season meet at
Burnham Pavilion of her career, senior
Nicole Pechanec made sure to go out with
a bang, as she won the overall competition
with a career-best score of 39.450 points.
She helped the No. 11 Cardinal earn its
best score of the season (196.575) as well
as the double victory against No. 17 Ari
zona (195.025) and No. 47 Cal (191.450).
It was a day of record breaking for
Stanford, which ended up setting 15 sea
son-best and eight career-best scores by
the end of the afternoon to extend its
streak to 34 straight victories against con
ference opponents at home. The team has
now won 26 straight meets over Cal,
which hasn't beaten the Cardinal since
2000.
Starting on vault, freshman Ivana
Hong's 9.900 led Stanford to a 49.200,
0.100 points shy of its season-best score in
the event. Hong's performance ac
counted for one of five scores of
9.900 or above for the Cardinal.
Pechanec put up a 9.825 for the
Cardinal, which got out to an early
0.375-point lead over second-place
Arizona.
Entering the meet in the top 10
nationally in uneven bars, Stanford
tied its season-best score in the
event with a 49.400, the same score
the team put up last time it faced

Cal on Feb. 12. Pechanec led the
charge, posting a 9.925 in the event
for only the second time all season
(the last time being against Cal as
well).
The Cardinal managed to win
the beam event despite four of its
six competitors scoring under
9.800 and the team finishing shy of
49.000. Sophomore Amanda Spin
ner won the event once again,
recording a 9.850. Pechanec fol
lowed close behind with a 9.800.
The Cardinal sealed the victory
on the floor exercise, tying its sec
ond-best score of the season with a
49.000. Junior Ashley Morgan
highlighted the event, scoring a ca

reer-high 9.950, the best individual
score in any event all season for
Stanford. Pechanec put up her sec
ond score of 9.900 or better in the
event to round out her career-best
performance.
Seniors Jenny Peter and Alyssa
Brown were also honored and
helped the Cardinal improve to 9-3
on the season. The Stanford
women compete next against Ari
zona State on Friday.
Though posting a season-high
score for the second straight week,
the No. 4 Stanford men's gymnas
tics team lost to No. 1 Oklahoma
for the second time this season. The
Cardinal was hoping to exact re
venge for a loss to Oklahoma in
Berkeley earlier this season, but
the Stanford effort ultimately fell
short, losing to the Sooners
356.950-351.400.
After the first two rounds, the
Cardinal had a 0.200-point lead.
The early going was highlighted by
junior Eddie Penev's 15.900 in the
floor exercise, which earned him
second in the event. Freshman
Sean Senters also put up an im
pressive score, but his 15.200 was
not enough as the team lost the
event, 60.050-59.950. It was
on the pommel horse where the
Cardinal made up its deficit, capi
talizing on a poor performance by
the Sooners. Stanford turned a
0.100-point deficit into a 0.200-
point lead with a 58.550 on pom
mel horse, led by junior John Mar
tin, who won the event with a
15.250.
However, Oklahoma took ad
vantage of the rings in the third
round to regain the lead a lead it
would not surrender for the rest of
the meet. Although junior James
Fosco earned the victory in the
event with a score of 15.600, the
Sooners outscored the Cardinal
60.550 to 58.550 to hold a 1.800-
point lead going into the fourth
round.
The Sooners were able to ex
pand their lead, as Stanford score's
dropped in the final few rounds to
let Oklahoma run away with it.
Penev would ultimately finish sec
ond overall with a score of 87.900.
The loss dropped the Cardinal
to 4-5 on the season, but the team is
improving its score each week and
looks poised to make a surge with
playoffs around the corner. The
