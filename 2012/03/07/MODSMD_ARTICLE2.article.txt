# Stanford, Coursera partner
## University to offer five more online courses this month 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford will offer five more free online
courses this month through a new partner
ship with Coursera, an online education
start-up founded by computer science pro
fessors Andrew Ng and Daphne Roller, the
University announced today. The partner
ship is the latest in a series of steps the Uni
versity is taking to explore online education
both on and off campus.
President John Hennessy recently indi
cated that Stanford is deliberately pursuing
ways to develop technology in and out of
the classroom, comparing online education
to a tsunami.
"We want to get ahead of this wave," he
told the Faculty Senate at a January meet
ing. "I want to be surfing the wave, not

drowning in it."
Stanford's biggest venture in online edu
cation thus far has been the creation of free
online courses, also known as "MOOCs," or
Massive Open Online Courses. Stanford's
pilot program, which began last August, at
tracted more than 350,000 students around
the world to its three classes.
Recently, professors in the Computer
Science department have pushed the notion
of free online classes even further by found
ing their own online education start-ups.
Professor Sebastian Thrun recently found
ed Udacity, an independent company. Pro
fessors Daphne Roller and Andrew Ng
founded Coursera, which will now be part
nering with Stanford as the University's
platform for new courses.
The new course offerings are Design and
Analysis of Algorithms, Natural Language

Processing, Cryptography, Game Theory
and Probabilistic Graphical Models, all of
which are scheduled to launch in mid
March. Enrollment for the five classes has
already reached 335,000.
Internal changes
In addition to the free online courses, the
University has been working on more mod
est projects within the campus to enhance
class experience for Stanford students. The
Office of the Vice Provost for Education re
cently set up a Technology and Pedagogy
Initiative to help faculty find methods to
best achieve their teaching goals.
Professor John Mitchell, currently serv
ing as special assistant for educational tech
nology to President Hennessy, identified
four areas in which Stanford is trying to
bring technology into education on campus:

interactive video lectures, social networking
forums for class discussion, interactive
quizzes and tests that take place outside of
the classroom and collaboration software to
help students work on group projects. Some
professors, including Koller, have already
started to employ the "inverted classroom
model," in which students watch lectures at
home before coming to class for more inter
active discussions.
"We like to make the time everyone
