# Stanford, Coursera partner
## University to offer five more online courses this month 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford will offer five more free online
courses this month through a new partner
ship with Coursera, an online education
start-up founded by computer science pro
fessors Andrew Ng and Daphne Roller, the
University announced today. The partner
ship is the latest in a series of steps the Uni
versity is taking to explore online education
both on and off campus.
President John Hennessy recently indi
cated that Stanford is deliberately pursuing
ways to develop technology in and out of
the classroom, comparing online education
to a tsunami.
"We want to get ahead of this wave," he
told the Faculty Senate at a January meet
ing. "I want to be surfing the wave, not

drowning in it."
Stanford's biggest venture in online edu
cation thus far has been the creation of free
online courses, also known as "MOOCs," or
Massive Open Online Courses. Stanford's
pilot program, which began last August, at
tracted more than 350,000 students around
the world to its three classes.
Recently, professors in the Computer
Science department have pushed the notion
of free online classes even further by found
ing their own online education start-ups.
Professor Sebastian Thrun recently found
ed Udacity, an independent company. Pro
fessors Daphne Roller and Andrew Ng
founded Coursera, which will now be part
nering with Stanford as the University's
platform for new courses.
The new course offerings are Design and
Analysis of Algorithms, Natural Language

Processing, Cryptography, Game Theory
and Probabilistic Graphical Models, all of
which are scheduled to launch in mid
March. Enrollment for the five classes has
already reached 335,000.
Internal changes
In addition to the free online courses, the
University has been working on more mod
est projects within the campus to enhance
class experience for Stanford students. The
Office of the Vice Provost for Education re
cently set up a Technology and Pedagogy
Initiative to help faculty find methods to
best achieve their teaching goals.
Professor John Mitchell, currently serv
ing as special assistant for educational tech
nology to President Hennessy, identified
four areas in which Stanford is trying to
bring technology into education on campus:

interactive video lectures, social networking
forums for class discussion, interactive
quizzes and tests that take place outside of
the classroom and collaboration software to
help students work on group projects. Some
professors, including Koller, have already
started to employ the "inverted classroom
model," in which students watch lectures at
home before coming to class for more inter
active discussions.
"We like to make the time everyone

spends here, both for students and
faculty, as effective and produc
tive as possible," Mitchell said.
"Technology can help restructure
a course so that the time people
are in a room together is more in
teractive."
Currently, The Center for
Teaching and Learning, recently
joined by new Associate Director
for Technology and Teaching,
Amy Collier, is at the heart of
these initiatives. Collier and her
team meet with faculty one on one
to determine what teaching
strategies will make best use of
classroom time,
"We sit down with the faculty
to identify what it is they want the
students to leave their course
with," Collier said. "They need to
ask: how do we know that they
have learned these things, and can
we assess that online? If we can,
then how?"
Mitchell said he believes that
the process of reevaluating teach
ing strategies will help make facul
ty more effective. Mitchell himself
has been preparing to teach one of
his classes online.
"What I found from doing this
is that putting material I taught

one way in a different format is a
good way to rethink it," he said.
"Viewing things in 15 minutes seg
ments seems to be better for stu
dents, but it also seems to be a use
ful for the instructor you have
to think about making each 15
minutes self-contained and mean
ingful, since you don't have 30
minutes to ramble.
Questions going forward
As Stanford continues to ex
plore online education and its po
tential benefits for the University,
there are still many questions that
remain unanswered, especially re
garding free online courses. The
online courses currently offer
grading but no accreditation, and
there are no formal restrictions or
guidelines for professors who
wish to offer their courses online
through sites such as Udacity or
Coursera.
One potential concern
Mitchell identified is other univer
sities incorporating Stanford's
free classes into their curriculum
and charging students for it.
"It's an unknown," Mitchell
said. "We have to think about it."
However, Mitchell said he feels
Stanford should not be overly
cautious.
"One of our strengths is that
our faculty are enterprising and
energetic," Mitchell said. "It
would be a mistake for the Uni

versity to stand in the way of try
ing new things. I think at the same
time, we as a university and as a
faculty will need to develop some
ideas as to what is helpful for our
university."
Collier said she believes that
exploring public courses as a Uni
versity endeavor also benefits stu
dents on campus.
"I would say that this initiative
has a heart and a soul," she said.
"The heart of the initiative is mak
ing the classroom space more en
gaging for Stanford students. The
soul is sharing this information
with the world. This is a contribu
tion that we can make to the
world, to people who don't have
the access to the resources at Stan
ford. What's really great about this
heart and soul method is that they
can really work together hav
ing an open online course with
people across the world contribut
ing to it could give you interac
tions that help you professionally
as a student. They fit really nicely
together."
Ultimately, Mitchell said that
Stanford's vision is both for its stu
dents and for the larger world: "If
we could all do something good
for the world while still serving
our students well, we all want
to do that."
