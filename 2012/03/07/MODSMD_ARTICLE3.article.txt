## SURF panel tackles Russian online gaming 
### ROSS THORBURN 
The Stanford US-Russia Forum (SURF)
teamed up with the student-run initiative
Emerging Silicon Valleys Tuesday evening to
host a panel of Russian entrepreneurs in a
forum titled, "The Russians Are Coming:
Global Online Games, Entrepreneurship &
Innovation in a Changing Society."The event
aimed to inform students of the prospects of
the Russian online gaming market and en
courage collaboration between entrepre
neurs in the United States and Russia.
The forum, which attracted undergradu
ate and business and law students, featured
prominent members of the Russian gaming
industry, including Sergey Titov, CEO of
Arktos Entertainment Group, and Sergey
Klimov, founder of Snowberry Connection
and Snowbird Game Studios. The speakers
emphasized the opportunities to be found in
the emerging Russian online markets, which
they said have been developing rapidly in re
cent years.

Titov and Klimov underlined the possibil
ities stemming from the exponential growth
of the online gaming industry. Even through
the financial crisis of 2007-08, the gaming
user base grew by approximately 70 to 80
percent in Russia. Many gaming companies
can be sold for several hundred million dol
lars once they develop an avid user base and

advertising revenues, the pair said.
Furthermore, vast possibilities remain in
the mobile gaming market in Russia, which
has remained relatively flat in recent years.
Developing social games that use platforms
such as Facebook to attract users is also

promising, the speakers said.
Klimov remarked, however,
that there is more to the industry
than compensation alone. He said
that it is more important that en
trepreneurs remain passionate
and believe in what they do.
"I chose to do something with
more creative freedom and a busi
ness that is not really established,"
Klimov said. "That just doesn't
exist in the car industry or the in
surance industry. The mix of tech
nology and creativity gives you a
lot of freedom."
The emerging Russian online
technology market enables a great
deal of creativity and flexibility, as
it has yet to become a stable mar
ket, he added.
The SURF panel examined re
cent economic changes in Russia,
which have helped contribute to
the success of the online gaming
industry. The panelists explained
that there were few barriers to
entry in the industry, as salaries
were relatively low but compara
ble to other lines of work. Global
ization and an increased availabil
ity of capital from venture capital
ists have helped many companies
find success.
Despite the improving eco
nomic environment, the panelists
noted increased regulation and in
creasing costs as a negative conse
quence.
Dmitriy Devishev, vice presi

dent of online games for mail.ru,
noted that these obstacles make
far greater capital necessary to
start a company, whereas previ
ously a group of friends could start
a company at minimal cost.
However, there remained a
general consensus among the pan
elists that the barriers to entry gen
erally have been reduced over the
years, despite the few difficulties
that have arisen through increas
ing regulation.
Finally, the panel discussed the
increased prospects of collabora
tion between entrepreneurs in Sil
icon Valley and Russia. They said
that, surprisingly, language barri
ers prove a relatively minor incon
venience, with cultural barriers
being a far more complex issue.
The entrepreneurs explained that
it takes knowledge of the local
market to be successful in the in
dustry, making collaboration be
tween U.S. and Russian entrepre
neurs necessary.
Titov told the audience, howev
er, that even with increased coop
eration, it remains difficult for a
company to be equally successful
in the United States and Russia, as
the countries are very different
marketplaces, each with its own
dominant culture,
Titov offered one solution:
closer work between graduates
from the United States and Russia
to achieve a greater international
understanding and cooperation
between the two dynamic mar
kets.
