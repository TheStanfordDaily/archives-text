Innovation in a Changing Society."The event

The forum, which attracted undergradu
ate and business and law students, featured
prominent members of the Russian gaming
industry, including Sergey Titov, CEO of
Arktos Entertainment Group, and Sergey
Klimov, founder of Snowberry Connection
and Snowbird Game Studios. The speakers
emphasized the opportunities to be found in
the emerging Russian online markets, which
they said have been developing rapidly in re

Titov and Klimov underlined the possibil

of the online gaming industry. Even through
the financial crisis of 2007-08, the gaming
user base grew by approximately 70 to 80
percent in Russia. Many gaming companies
can be sold for several hundred million dol
lars once they develop an avid user base and

advertising revenues, the pair said.
Furthermore, vast possibilities remain in
the mobile gaming market in Russia, which
has remained relatively flat in recent years.
