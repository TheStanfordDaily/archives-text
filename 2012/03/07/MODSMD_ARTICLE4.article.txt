## Senate debates allocation of discretionary fund 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
With eight weeks remaining in their
term, the ASSU Undergraduate Senators
debated at their Tuesday night meeting how
to allocate the $5,800 remaining in their dis
cretionary fund. Since only eight of the 15
Senators attended the meeting, a lack of
quorum at moments during the meeting

prevented the Senate from voting on sever
al of its action items.
In open forum, Galaan Dafa 'l2, repre
senting the Stanford Association for Inter
national Development (SAID), asked the
Senate for suggestions on acquiring the over
$50,000 necessary to bring Tony Blair, for
mer British Prime Minister, to speak at
Stanford.
Dafa said that after receiving confirma

tion around four days ago that Blair is avail
able to come to Stanford, the group has ap
proached numerous financing organiza
tions, attempting to accumulate the money
within the next 10 days before the opportu
nity closes. The $50,000 is needed to pay ex
clusively for security and travel detail rather
than honorarium, according to Dafa.
ASSU Appropriations Chair
Briana Pang 'l3 expressed frus
tration that the ASSU Speakers
Bureau hadn't offered to support
the event.
"The Speaker's Bureau . . .
has $86,000 in their honorarium
line item and ... $65,000 in re
serves. Why can't they pull from
their reserves?" Pang said. "I feel
like convincing the Speaker's Bu
reau to give them the money is
better than getting it from the
buffer fund."
Dafa specifically asked the
Senate to consider taking the
funds from the ASSU buffer fund
or Senate discretionary funds, but
both suggestions were rejected.
Senators rebuffed the idea to use
their discretionary funds since the
amount would provide only a
fraction of the necessary support.
Dafa claimed that he and
other SAID leaders approached
President John Hennessy and
were advised to seek support
through the Senate buffer fund.
Both Senators and Director of
Student Activities and Leader
ship (SAL) Nanci Howe ex
pressed surprise that Hennessy
would have advised this.
"I'm pretty sure . . . we've
tried to get Tony Blair [to come]
in the last couple of years and it

hasn't worked out," said Dafa,
who expressed his frustration at
being unable to finance such a
prestigious speaker. "It is nice
that we've got this [opportunity]
now ... Being unable to find the
funding at Stanford just seems
paradoxical."
ASSU Elections Commission
er Adam Adler 'l2 also requested
funding from the Senate's discre
tionary account for his event The
Stanford 2020, a program mod
eled after TED Talks, at which
seven to eight professors would
present their research to students.
Having run successfully last year,
this would be the second annual
Stanford 2020, Adler said.
Adler added that the event
could not receive funding
through an ASSU Executive Ac
tion Grant, even though it had
been awarded the funding last
year. When asked why they hadn't
received the grant again, Adler
speculated that the Executive
might have been concerned about
the event conflicting with its own
agenda.
"The Executive's Service
Summit is about the same time ..
. and he [ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2] didn't want our
event overshadowing his event,"
Adler said. "I think that's what he
is worried about."
"It is certainly not an obliga
tion of the Senate to [fund] this,
but it is something that is nice, and
you have the money for it, and
there aren't any other initiatives

on the table," Adler added. He en
couraged the Senate to draw from
its discretionary funds, and said
he hoped to secure the money this
week so that he could focus on lo
gistical questions, which necessi
tate funds before the quarter
ends.
"We do have $5,800," Senate
Treasurer lan Chan 'l4 said. "I
don't see any other significant
proposals by any other commit
tees to be needing any significant
funding, nor do I see us giving all
our $5,800 to bring Tony Blair
here ... We have seen this work
before and it is worth trying to get
it to work again."
The potential of the money
being used to fund Tony Blair
coming to campus as well the
desire to include the Executive in
discussion caused Senators
Nate Garcia 'l4 and Janani Ra
machandran 'l4, respectively, to
abstain from the vote to fund
Adler's event, automatically dis
qualifying the budgetary alloca
tion since fewer senators voted
than was necessary for quorum.
The Senate will return to the
request next week.
Without the necessary number
of voters, the Senate also had dif
ficultly passing a bill that would
have extended the Special Fees
submission deadline for several
prominent student groups, includ
ing The Daily. Although he said
he did not want to endorse the
bill, Senator Ben Laufer 'l2
changed his vote from abstention
to approval after acknowledging
the urgency of such an extension
to allow the action to pass.

senting the Stanford Association for Inter
national Development (SAID), asked the
Senate for suggestions on acquiring the over
$50,000 necessary to bring Tony Blair, for
mer British Prime Minister, to speak at
Stanford.
Dafa said that after receiving confirma

tion around four days ago that Blair is avail
able to come to Stanford, the group has ap
proached numerous financing organiza
tions, attempting to accumulate the money
within the next 10 days before the opportu
nity closes. The $50,000 is needed to pay ex
clusively for security and travel detail rather
than honorarium, according to Dafa.
ASSU Appropriations Chair
Briana Pang 'l3 expressed frus
tration that the ASSU Speakers
Bureau hadn't offered to support
the event.
"The Speaker's Bureau . . .
has $86,000 in their honorarium
line item and ... $65,000 in re
serves. Why can't they pull from
their reserves?" Pang said. "I feel
like convincing the Speaker's Bu
reau to give them the money is
better than getting it from the
buffer fund."
Dafa specifically asked the
Senate to consider taking the
funds from the ASSU buffer fund
or Senate discretionary funds, but
both suggestions were rejected.
Senators rebuffed the idea to use
their discretionary funds since the
amount would provide only a
fraction of the necessary support.
Dafa claimed that he and
other SAID leaders approached
President John Hennessy and
were advised to seek support
through the Senate buffer fund.
Both Senators and Director of
Student Activities and Leader
ship (SAL) Nanci Howe ex
pressed surprise that Hennessy
would have advised this.
"I'm pretty sure . . . we've
tried to get Tony Blair [to come]
in the last couple of years and it

hasn't worked out," said Dafa,
who expressed his frustration at
being unable to finance such a
prestigious speaker. "It is nice
that we've got this [opportunity]
now ... Being unable to find the
funding at Stanford just seems
paradoxical."
ASSU Elections Commission
er Adam Adler 'l2 also requested
funding from the Senate's discre
tionary account for his event The
Stanford 2020, a program mod
eled after TED Talks, at which
seven to eight professors would
present their research to students.
Having run successfully last year,
this would be the second annual
Stanford 2020, Adler said.
Adler added that the event
could not receive funding
through an ASSU Executive Ac
tion Grant, even though it had
been awarded the funding last
year. When asked why they hadn't
received the grant again, Adler
speculated that the Executive
might have been concerned about
the event conflicting with its own
agenda.
"The Executive's Service
Summit is about the same time ..
. and he [ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2] didn't want our
event overshadowing his event,"
Adler said. "I think that's what he
is worried about."
"It is certainly not an obliga
tion of the Senate to [fund] this,
but it is something that is nice, and
you have the money for it, and
there aren't any other initiatives

on the table," Adler added. He en
couraged the Senate to draw from
its discretionary funds, and said
he hoped to secure the money this
week so that he could focus on lo
gistical questions, which necessi
tate funds before the quarter
ends.
"We do have $5,800," Senate
Treasurer lan Chan 'l4 said. "I
don't see any other significant
proposals by any other commit
tees to be needing any significant
funding, nor do I see us giving all
our $5,800 to bring Tony Blair
here ... We have seen this work
before and it is worth trying to get
it to work again."
The potential of the money
being used to fund Tony Blair
coming to campus as well the
desire to include the Executive in
discussion caused Senators
Nate Garcia 'l4 and Janani Ra
machandran 'l4, respectively, to
abstain from the vote to fund
Adler's event, automatically dis
qualifying the budgetary alloca
tion since fewer senators voted
than was necessary for quorum.
The Senate will return to the
request next week.
Without the necessary number
of voters, the Senate also had dif
ficultly passing a bill that would
have extended the Special Fees
submission deadline for several
prominent student groups, includ
ing The Daily. Although he said
he did not want to endorse the
bill, Senator Ben Laufer 'l2
changed his vote from abstention
to approval after acknowledging
the urgency of such an extension
to allow the action to pass.

With eight weeks remaining in their
term, the ASSU Undergraduate Senators
debated at their Tuesday night meeting how
to allocate the $5,800 remaining in their dis
cretionary fund. Since only eight of the 15
Senators attended the meeting, a lack of
quorum at moments during the meeting

prevented the Senate from voting on sever
al of its action items.
