## Senate debates allocation of discretionary fund 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
With eight weeks remaining in their
term, the ASSU Undergraduate Senators
debated at their Tuesday night meeting how
to allocate the $5,800 remaining in their dis
cretionary fund. Since only eight of the 15
Senators attended the meeting, a lack of
quorum at moments during the meeting

prevented the Senate from voting on sever
al of its action items.
In open forum, Galaan Dafa 'l2, repre
senting the Stanford Association for Inter
national Development (SAID), asked the
Senate for suggestions on acquiring the over
$50,000 necessary to bring Tony Blair, for
mer British Prime Minister, to speak at
Stanford.
Dafa said that after receiving confirma

tion around four days ago that Blair is avail
able to come to Stanford, the group has ap
proached numerous financing organiza
tions, attempting to accumulate the money
within the next 10 days before the opportu
nity closes. The $50,000 is needed to pay ex
clusively for security and travel detail rather
than honorarium, according to Dafa.
