Student panelists Aditya Mantha '10, Abena Bruce '12 and Surabhi Nirkhe '13 discussed their
international community projects in a panel moderated by Anne FIrth Murray Tuesday afternoon.
that the panel's purpose was "to
demonstrate that students can be
come involved in interesting expe
riences that will guide you through
the rest of your human life."
She encouraged students to
apply for grants that fund interna
tional service projects.
"What you do may be impor
tant, but the way you do it is more
important," Murray added. "Go in a
humble way with a learning atti
tude."
Murray recommended that stu
dents "interact in away to solve
problems jointly. People will open
up and they may have the answers
themselves, or not." She highlighted
the role that these experiences play
in helping students chart their fu
ture course.

Panelist Surabhi Nirkhe 'l3, a
human biology major, spent her
summer in India and Nepal work
ing in tandem with two anti-human
trafficking groups. Nirkhe assisted
at a residential school for young
girls who are at risk of being traf
ficked "while their mothers are out
working in red-light districts," she
said.
Nirkhe developed a new cur
riculum to teach the girls health and
life skills.
The topics are "stigmatized is
sues there, so girls know little about
this," Nirkhe said.
The Committed Communities
Development Trust in Mumbai,
India, funded her fellowship to
work with girls at risk of falling vic
tim to child marriage and prostitu
tion rings.
Panel member Aditya Mantha
'lO, a current co-term student in epi
demiology, reflected on his experi
ence teaching emergency para
medic services in India and Nepal

during the summer. He described
the challenging role of a volunteer
paramedic and recounted one in
stance when his supervisor had to
"bail out" medical personnel being
held hostage by rioters following a
bomb blast.
The third panelist, Abena Bruce
'l2, a human biology major, trav
eled to Cape Town, South Africa,
with a Stanford program to teach
emergency medicine to middle
school students in poor, minority
townships that are medically under
served. Bruce informed listeners
that the National Institutes of
Health "funds different colleges to
[support service projects] interna
tionally."
Panelists were concerned with
how and to what extent their sum
mer work could leave a lasting im
pact after they left their sites. Man
tha said he would like to build "a
peer leadership project" to sustain
his work while others expressed a
desire to return in the future. Bruce

stated that her goal is to "teach the
older girls the curriculum I taught,
and then teach them how to teach
the younger girls" in an attempt to
create a self-sustaining cycle.
"The best piece of advice ever
given to me was to learn another
language," Mantha said. He advised
students to attend "as many confer
ences as possible to make contacts,
find like-minded individuals and
learn about summer opportunities."
When audience members asked
the panel how to find and secure
such opportunities, Bruce respond
ed that networking is key.
"I kept asking people who to
talk to and introducing myself to
people, saying, 'l'm interested in
global health, can you help me,' and
followed up with, 'Do you know
anyone else who I should talk to?'"
Bruce said.
The panelists discussed the ethi
cal issues related to unavoidably
short summer internships, during
which many volunteers, according
to Bruce, openly wonder, "Am I re
ally helping? They train me, but I
don't know their history or culture."
"I learned more than I gave,
which is difficult," Bruce added.
However, Murray injected,
"Don't be ashamed that you're
going to be learning so much."
"You're in the first third of life, and
you should be learning and finding
out what kind of person you want to
be," Murray said.
"There is nothing wrong with
being on a steep learning curve," she
continued. "No doubt you have
helped."

learn about summer opportunities."
When audience members asked
the panel how to find and secure
such opportunities, Bruce respond
ed that networking is key.
"I kept asking people who to
talk to and introducing myself to
people, saying, 'l'm interested in
global health, can you help me,' and
followed up with, 'Do you know
anyone else who I should talk to?'"
Bruce said.
The panelists discussed the ethi
cal issues related to unavoidably
short summer internships, during
which many volunteers, according
to Bruce, openly wonder, "Am I re
ally helping? They train me, but I
don't know their history or culture."
"I learned more than I gave,
which is difficult," Bruce added.
However, Murray injected,
"Don't be ashamed that you're
going to be learning so much."
"You're in the first third of life, and
you should be learning and finding
out what kind of person you want to
be," Murray said.
"There is nothing wrong with
being on a steep learning curve," she
continued. "No doubt you have
helped."

Student panelists Aditya Mantha '10, Abena Bruce '12 and Surabhi Nirkhe '13 discussed their
international community projects in a panel moderated by Anne FIrth Murray Tuesday afternoon.
that the panel's purpose was "to
demonstrate that students can be
come involved in interesting expe
riences that will guide you through
the rest of your human life."
She encouraged students to
apply for grants that fund interna
tional service projects.
"What you do may be impor
tant, but the way you do it is more
important," Murray added. "Go in a
humble way with a learning atti
tude."
Murray recommended that stu
dents "interact in away to solve
problems jointly. People will open
up and they may have the answers
themselves, or not." She highlighted
the role that these experiences play
in helping students chart their fu
ture course.

Panelist Surabhi Nirkhe 'l3, a
human biology major, spent her
summer in India and Nepal work
ing in tandem with two anti-human
trafficking groups. Nirkhe assisted
at a residential school for young
girls who are at risk of being traf
ficked "while their mothers are out
working in red-light districts," she
said.
Nirkhe developed a new cur
riculum to teach the girls health and
life skills.
The topics are "stigmatized is
sues there, so girls know little about
this," Nirkhe said.
The Committed Communities
Development Trust in Mumbai,
India, funded her fellowship to
work with girls at risk of falling vic
tim to child marriage and prostitu
tion rings.
Panel member Aditya Mantha
'lO, a current co-term student in epi
demiology, reflected on his experi
ence teaching emergency para
medic services in India and Nepal

during the summer. He described
the challenging role of a volunteer
paramedic and recounted one in
stance when his supervisor had to
"bail out" medical personnel being
held hostage by rioters following a
bomb blast.
The third panelist, Abena Bruce
'l2, a human biology major, trav
eled to Cape Town, South Africa,
with a Stanford program to teach
emergency medicine to middle
school students in poor, minority
townships that are medically under
served. Bruce informed listeners
that the National Institutes of
Health "funds different colleges to
[support service projects] interna
tionally."
Panelists were concerned with
how and to what extent their sum
mer work could leave a lasting im
pact after they left their sites. Man
tha said he would like to build "a
peer leadership project" to sustain
his work while others expressed a
desire to return in the future. Bruce

stated that her goal is to "teach the
older girls the curriculum I taught,
and then teach them how to teach
the younger girls" in an attempt to
create a self-sustaining cycle.
"The best piece of advice ever
given to me was to learn another
language," Mantha said. He advised
students to attend "as many confer
ences as possible to make contacts,
find like-minded individuals and
learn about summer opportunities."
When audience members asked
the panel how to find and secure
such opportunities, Bruce respond
ed that networking is key.
"I kept asking people who to
talk to and introducing myself to
people, saying, 'l'm interested in
global health, can you help me,' and
followed up with, 'Do you know
anyone else who I should talk to?'"
Bruce said.
