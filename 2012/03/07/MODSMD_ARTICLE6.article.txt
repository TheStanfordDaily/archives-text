## New ASSU Constitution faces review Document requires votes in Senate and Graduate Student Council 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Governing Documents
Commission (GDC) concluded a series
of public feedback sessions on a new
draft of the ASSU Constitution Monday
evening. Although no non-ASSU-affili
ated students attended the final feedback
session, the GDC's co-chairs ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2 and ASSU
Parliamentarian and Senator Alex
Kindel 'l4 said they are happy with
the constitution's direction and are opti
mistic about its chances of being passed
by the ASSU Undergraduate Senate and
Graduate Student Council (GSC). If ap
proved by these bodies, the new constitu
tion will require two-thirds approval by
students on the spring campus-wide bal
lot.
The GDC, which the ASSU Executive
first charged with the task of rewriting
the constitution in spring 2011, based the
Constitution's reforms on suggestions
from internal officers and members of
the Stanford community.
One major change within the new
governing document is the creation of
two standing joint committees, a Joint
Administration Committee and a Joint
Nominations Committee, chaired re
spectively by the ASSU President and
Parliamentarian. The committees would
include representatives from the Senate
and GSC and would meet three times a
quarter. The second committees reflects
and effort to expand oversight over the
Nominations Commission, a branch of
the ASSU that nominates students for
University committees.
The new constitution also seeks to
compact the Executive, GSC and Senate
bylaws into one document.
Both Cruz and Kindel cited increasing
centralization and improving the rela
tionship between the Graduate Student
Council (GSC), the Senate and the rest of
ASSU as one of the new constitution's
major objectives.The GDC executive re
port noted that there is currently "very
little communication between" the GSC
and the Senate, which, according to Cruz,
weakens ASSU advocacy for students.
Rather than having one unified voice
approach the University with petitions
and recommendations, the current struc
ture of the Senate, GSC and Executive
creates inefficiency and redundancy,
Cruz said.
"One of the hugest disadvantages to
this disconnect has been the decentral
ization of advocacy," Cruz said. "It would
be significantly more fruitful to have a
singular policy advocacy group instead of
multiple policy advocacy groups all rep
resenting ultimately the ASSU."
The GDC executive summary of the
changes described the old governing doc
uments as including "large swaths of ir
relevant regulations." Cruz noted that the
documents also used circuitous legalese,
which made the documents dense
and difficult to understand.
Kindel agreed, adding that the ex
isting constitution contains con
tradictory clauses that often
make it nearly impossible to in
terpret.
The new 32-page ASSU Con
stitution is half the document's
former length. The proposed con
stitution also requires that the
ASSU Executive charter a Gov
erning Documents Commission
every three years to reexamine
the functionality of the docu
ment's regulations.
According to Cruz, the com
mission decided on every three
years so that every Stanford stu
dent except master's candi
dates — would see at least one
GDC during their time at Stan
ford.
"One thing that we wanted to
make sure never happened again
was inheriting a document like
this, a document which hasn't
seen significant change in more
than a decade," Cruz said. "One of
the problems [with the old struc
ture] was that nobody ever did
have to look at it to see where the

document was. And now it will
have to be looked at at least every
three years."
Because of negative feedback
from ASSU senators, Kindel and
Cruz have altered or abandoned
some of their initial amendments,
including a proposal to add a sec
ond vice president to the Execu
tive and to decrease the number
of elected undergraduate sena
tors from 15 to nine, according to
Kindel.
Ratifying the new document
The GDC held four open feed
back sessions for the student body
to ask about the new governing
documents and make suggestions.
After the constitution was pre
sented on Feb. 25, the feedback
sessions were all held within a
week.
Although both Cruz and
Kindel said that the first three ses
sions were well attended, they did
not give approximate attendance
figures.
Sjoerd de Ridder, a graduate
student and GSC representative,
said that he saw eight people at
one of last week's feedback ses
sion, although most of the atten
dees were ASSU representatives,
he added.
"I think it [is] not surprising
that the people who feel strongly
about the ASSU and its constitu

tion are already in some way or an
other involved with the ASSU,"
Ridder said.
Students can still contribute
their opinions and questions over
email until the Senate's vote this
Tuesday.
If the Senate and GSC both ap
prove the governing documents
through a constitutional amend
ment, the document will be subject
to a student vote during the spring
election. The new constitution
must receive approval from two
thirds of student voters with at
least 15 percent of the student
body voting and the Board of
Trustees before taking effect next
fall.
Since the objections and con
cerns of most of the ASSU officers
have already been addressed,
Kindel said he expects the docu
ment to pass following public
forum debate.
"Not too much is contentious
right now," he said.
The Senate tabled a discussion
about the constitution at its Tues
day meeting this week, while the
GSC is scheduled to begin debate
on the document today. Both
groups will vote on the amend
ments next week at their respec
tive meetings.

GDC during their time at Stan
ford.
"One thing that we wanted to
make sure never happened again
was inheriting a document like
this, a document which hasn't
seen significant change in more
than a decade," Cruz said. "One of
the problems [with the old struc
ture] was that nobody ever did
have to look at it to see where the

document was. And now it will
have to be looked at at least every
three years."
Because of negative feedback
from ASSU senators, Kindel and
Cruz have altered or abandoned
some of their initial amendments,
including a proposal to add a sec
ond vice president to the Execu
tive and to decrease the number
of elected undergraduate sena
tors from 15 to nine, according to
Kindel.
Ratifying the new document
The GDC held four open feed
back sessions for the student body
to ask about the new governing
documents and make suggestions.
After the constitution was pre
sented on Feb. 25, the feedback
sessions were all held within a
week.
Although both Cruz and
Kindel said that the first three ses
sions were well attended, they did
not give approximate attendance
figures.
Sjoerd de Ridder, a graduate
student and GSC representative,
said that he saw eight people at
one of last week's feedback ses
sion, although most of the atten
dees were ASSU representatives,
he added.
"I think it [is] not surprising
that the people who feel strongly
about the ASSU and its constitu

tion are already in some way or an
other involved with the ASSU,"
Ridder said.
Students can still contribute
their opinions and questions over
email until the Senate's vote this
Tuesday.
If the Senate and GSC both ap
prove the governing documents
through a constitutional amend
ment, the document will be subject
to a student vote during the spring
election. The new constitution
must receive approval from two
thirds of student voters with at
least 15 percent of the student
body voting and the Board of
Trustees before taking effect next
fall.
Since the objections and con
cerns of most of the ASSU officers
have already been addressed,
Kindel said he expects the docu
ment to pass following public
forum debate.
"Not too much is contentious
right now," he said.
The Senate tabled a discussion
about the constitution at its Tues
day meeting this week, while the
GSC is scheduled to begin debate
on the document today. Both
groups will vote on the amend
ments next week at their respec
tive meetings.

The ASSU Governing Documents
Commission (GDC) concluded a series
of public feedback sessions on a new
draft of the ASSU Constitution Monday
evening. Although no non-ASSU-affili
ated students attended the final feedback
session, the GDC's co-chairs ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2 and ASSU
Parliamentarian and Senator Alex
Kindel 'l4 said they are happy with
the constitution's direction and are opti
mistic about its chances of being passed
by the ASSU Undergraduate Senate and
Graduate Student Council (GSC). If ap
proved by these bodies, the new constitu
tion will require two-thirds approval by
students on the spring campus-wide bal
lot.
The GDC, which the ASSU Executive
first charged with the task of rewriting
the constitution in spring 2011, based the
Constitution's reforms on suggestions
from internal officers and members of
the Stanford community.
One major change within the new
governing document is the creation of
two standing joint committees, a Joint
Administration Committee and a Joint
Nominations Committee, chaired re
spectively by the ASSU President and
Parliamentarian. The committees would
include representatives from the Senate
and GSC and would meet three times a
quarter. The second committees reflects
and effort to expand oversight over the
Nominations Commission, a branch of
the ASSU that nominates students for
University committees.
The new constitution also seeks to
compact the Executive, GSC and Senate
bylaws into one document.
Both Cruz and Kindel cited increasing
centralization and improving the rela
tionship between the Graduate Student
Council (GSC), the Senate and the rest of
ASSU as one of the new constitution's
major objectives.The GDC executive re
port noted that there is currently "very
little communication between" the GSC
and the Senate, which, according to Cruz,
weakens ASSU advocacy for students.
Rather than having one unified voice
approach the University with petitions
and recommendations, the current struc
ture of the Senate, GSC and Executive
creates inefficiency and redundancy,
Cruz said.
"One of the hugest disadvantages to
this disconnect has been the decentral
ization of advocacy," Cruz said. "It would
be significantly more fruitful to have a
singular policy advocacy group instead of
multiple policy advocacy groups all rep
resenting ultimately the ASSU."
The GDC executive summary of the
changes described the old governing doc
uments as including "large swaths of ir
relevant regulations." Cruz noted that the
documents also used circuitous legalese,
which made the documents dense
and difficult to understand.
Kindel agreed, adding that the ex
isting constitution contains con
tradictory clauses that often
make it nearly impossible to in
terpret.
The new 32-page ASSU Con
stitution is half the document's
former length. The proposed con
stitution also requires that the
ASSU Executive charter a Gov
erning Documents Commission
every three years to reexamine
the functionality of the docu
ment's regulations.
According to Cruz, the com
mission decided on every three
years so that every Stanford stu
dent except master's candi
dates — would see at least one
GDC during their time at Stan
ford.
"One thing that we wanted to
make sure never happened again
