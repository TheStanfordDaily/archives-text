## New ASSU Constitution faces review Document requires votes in Senate and Graduate Student Council 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Governing Documents
Commission (GDC) concluded a series
of public feedback sessions on a new
draft of the ASSU Constitution Monday
evening. Although no non-ASSU-affili
ated students attended the final feedback
session, the GDC's co-chairs ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2 and ASSU
Parliamentarian and Senator Alex
Kindel 'l4 said they are happy with
the constitution's direction and are opti
mistic about its chances of being passed
by the ASSU Undergraduate Senate and
Graduate Student Council (GSC). If ap
proved by these bodies, the new constitu
tion will require two-thirds approval by
students on the spring campus-wide bal
lot.
The GDC, which the ASSU Executive
first charged with the task of rewriting
the constitution in spring 2011, based the
Constitution's reforms on suggestions
from internal officers and members of
the Stanford community.
One major change within the new
governing document is the creation of
two standing joint committees, a Joint
Administration Committee and a Joint
Nominations Committee, chaired re
spectively by the ASSU President and
Parliamentarian. The committees would
include representatives from the Senate
and GSC and would meet three times a
quarter. The second committees reflects
and effort to expand oversight over the
Nominations Commission, a branch of
the ASSU that nominates students for
University committees.
The new constitution also seeks to
compact the Executive, GSC and Senate
bylaws into one document.
Both Cruz and Kindel cited increasing
centralization and improving the rela
tionship between the Graduate Student
Council (GSC), the Senate and the rest of
ASSU as one of the new constitution's
major objectives.The GDC executive re
port noted that there is currently "very
little communication between" the GSC
and the Senate, which, according to Cruz,
weakens ASSU advocacy for students.
Rather than having one unified voice
approach the University with petitions
and recommendations, the current struc
ture of the Senate, GSC and Executive
creates inefficiency and redundancy,
Cruz said.
"One of the hugest disadvantages to
this disconnect has been the decentral
ization of advocacy," Cruz said. "It would
be significantly more fruitful to have a
singular policy advocacy group instead of
multiple policy advocacy groups all rep
resenting ultimately the ASSU."
The GDC executive summary of the
changes described the old governing doc
uments as including "large swaths of ir
relevant regulations." Cruz noted that the
documents also used circuitous legalese,
