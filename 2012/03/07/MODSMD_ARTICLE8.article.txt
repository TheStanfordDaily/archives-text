## Palo Alto City Council moves forward with new theatre and office complex 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ileana Najarro 
The Palo Alto City Council
voted Monday to move forward on
a plan proposed by John Arrillaga
'6O to build a new theatre and of
fice complex next to the city's tran
sit center, agreeing in an 8-0 vote to
spend $250,000 on design and en
vironmental reviews.
The Council plans to use funds
from the $2.25 million Stanford
gave the city last year, earmarked
for pedestrian and bicycling im
provements, as compensation for
the University's Medical Center
expansion project.
According to an article by the
San Jose Mercury News, Deputy
City Manager Steve Emslie said
the money will go toward hiring an
architect, urban designer and plan
ner to work with the developer and

ensure that the proposal will in
deed improve bicycle and pedes
trian conditions.
The proposed 60,000- to 80,000-
square-foot theatre and multi
story office building, complete
with a three-level underground
garage, will replace the historic
Mac Arthur Park Restaurant at 27
University Ave. on Stanford
owned land. The relocation spot
for the restaurant has yet to be de
termined.
The restaurant carries a rich
history, having once served as a
hostess house for visiting families
of World War I servicemen, ac
cording to a previous San Jose
Mercury News article. Emslie
noted that the proposed complex
would add to the site 's significance.
"The importance of a site in this
area is the link between the Uni
versity and the city of Palo Alto,"
Emslie said. "The area provides a
direct link to the University Cal
train station, direct vehicular ac
cess and public visibility. The
prominence of the site enables a
theatre to be a community land
mark while having a physical asso
ciation with Stanford."
