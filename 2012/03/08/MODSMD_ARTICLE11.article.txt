## OFF THE BEATEN PATH Gap years provide adventure, insight for small number of Stanford admits 
### CHRIS FREDERICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While most freshmen
sit or snooze
through IHUM
lecture, some of
their fellow ad
mits are learning Mandarin in
China, working for a nonprofit in
their home state or following their
passions around the globe.
Approximately 20 to 30 stu
dents defer their admission to
Stanford every year, an option
commonly known as taking a gap
year, according to Assistant Di
rector of Admissions David
Lazo.
"Common gap year plans in
clude language immersion pro
grams through the U.S. State De
partment, professional participa
tion in the fine and performing
arts and nonprofit work," wrote
Lazo in an email to The Daily.
He noted that a few students
defer their admission in order to
complete national military service
for instance, international stu
dents from countries such as Sin
gapore, which has a two-year na
tional service requirement for all
male citizens.
Although national news
sources have stated that universi
ties are reporting increasingly
popularity of gap years, Lazo said
that this is not the case at Stan
ford.
"The number of students re
questing a gap year has remained
relatively stable for the past sev
eral years," he said.
During her gap year, Caroline
Hodge 'l3 apprenticed at an or
ganic farm in Connecticut, in
terned as a reporter for the Palo
Alto Daily News, volunteered and
traveled in South America and
worked as a counselor at a sum
mer camp focused on social and
environmental justice.
"I learned a lot about myself,"
Hodge said. "I had space from the
frenetic pace of high school. I had
the time and space to remember

why I liked learning."
Hodge added that she appreci
ated the unique opportunity to
live in a different environment
when traveling in South America.
"I would meet people who had
no idea what it meant that I was
from California, or that I was
going to Stanford next year or
that I was taking a year off," she
said.
Taking a year off also helped
Hodge discover new interests.
"My whole interest in sustain
able agriculture, which has been
such a big part of my college expe
rience that all came from
working on a farm [during my gap

year]," she said. "I didn't think it
would make a lasting impression
on me, [but] it really did."
Unlike Hodge, some gap year
students, such as British national
George Burgess 'l5, choose to de
vote themselves to a single proj
ect. Burgess used his year off to
expand EducationApps, an edu
cational mobile app business he
started while in high school. He
noted that being a young entre
preneur was difficult at times.
"It gets sort of lonely running
your own business at some
points," Burgess said. "For a long
time, it was just me working alone
the entire day, but it was definite

ly worthwhile."
Burgess added that many of his
peers took gap years, a popular
option for high school graduates
in England, according to the Wall
Street Journal.
"It seems like in the U.S. fewer
people are even familiar with this
idea," Burgess said. "I don't know
why because I think it's a fantastic
experience."
"It's the only chance you really
have to take an entire year off, and
not have any commitments, any
worries, work a bit, travel [or do]
whatever you're going to do. I just
think that sort of freedom doesn't
come too often in life," he added.

For Olympian Rachael Flatt
'l5, a gap year was a chance to
spend time honing her skill as a
figure skater. After a hectic senior
year, which included training for
the 2010 Winter Olympics and
taking four AP classes, Flatt said
she was "busy and exhausted."
"I needed a little bit more time
to sort everything out, and I really
wanted to give skating a good
shot, just focusing on training,"
she said.
While l latt's gap year provid
ed a respite from academic pres
sures, the intense focus on athlet
ics was draining at times.
"The hardest part about my
gap year was knowing that it was
solely about skating," Flatt said.
"For me, I need a balance, and
school was that good distraction
from skating."
Due to overtraining, Flatt suf
fered injuries during the year, in
cluding a stress fracture. Never
theless, she said the time allowed
her "to grow up quite a bit."
According to Lazo, newly ad
mitted students are often curious
about gap years when they come
to Admit Weekend, but ultimate
ly, few choose to take time off.
" Most students who request
and are granted a gap year have
plans in place well before they
learn of their admission decision,"
he said.
He warned students wishing to
pursue a gap year that they should
be able to present a "fully formed
and researched plan" to the ad
missions office.
While the experience is not for
everyone, students who take gap
years can continue to benefit even
after they arrive at the Farm.
"Pursuing a gap year is a per
sonal decision," Lazo added. "Ap
plicants who take a gap year often
report to us that they are invigor
ated and ready to fully immerse
themselves in the Stanford expe
rience."

"For me, I need a balance, and
school was that good distraction
from skating."
Due to overtraining, Flatt suf
fered injuries during the year, in
cluding a stress fracture. Never
theless, she said the time allowed
her "to grow up quite a bit."
According to Lazo, newly ad
mitted students are often curious
about gap years when they come
to Admit Weekend, but ultimate
ly, few choose to take time off.
" Most students who request
and are granted a gap year have
plans in place well before they
learn of their admission decision,"
he said.
He warned students wishing to
pursue a gap year that they should
be able to present a "fully formed
and researched plan" to the ad
missions office.
While the experience is not for
everyone, students who take gap
years can continue to benefit even
after they arrive at the Farm.
"Pursuing a gap year is a per
sonal decision," Lazo added. "Ap
plicants who take a gap year often
report to us that they are invigor
ated and ready to fully immerse
themselves in the Stanford expe
rience."

While most freshmen
sit or snooze
through IHUM
lecture, some of
their fellow ad
mits are learning Mandarin in
China, working for a nonprofit in
their home state or following their
passions around the globe.
Approximately 20 to 30 stu
dents defer their admission to
Stanford every year, an option
commonly known as taking a gap
year, according to Assistant Di
rector of Admissions David
Lazo.
"Common gap year plans in
clude language immersion pro
grams through the U.S. State De
partment, professional participa
tion in the fine and performing
arts and nonprofit work," wrote
Lazo in an email to The Daily.
He noted that a few students
defer their admission in order to
complete national military service
for instance, international stu
dents from countries such as Sin
gapore, which has a two-year na
tional service requirement for all
male citizens.
Although national news
sources have stated that universi
ties are reporting increasingly
popularity of gap years, Lazo said
that this is not the case at Stan
ford.
"The number of students re
questing a gap year has remained
relatively stable for the past sev
eral years," he said.
During her gap year, Caroline
Hodge 'l3 apprenticed at an or
ganic farm in Connecticut, in
terned as a reporter for the Palo
Alto Daily News, volunteered and
traveled in South America and
worked as a counselor at a sum
mer camp focused on social and
environmental justice.
"I learned a lot about myself,"
Hodge said. "I had space from the
frenetic pace of high school. I had
the time and space to remember

why I liked learning."
Hodge added that she appreci
ated the unique opportunity to
live in a different environment
when traveling in South America.
"I would meet people who had
no idea what it meant that I was
from California, or that I was
going to Stanford next year or
that I was taking a year off," she
said.
Taking a year off also helped
Hodge discover new interests.
"My whole interest in sustain
able agriculture, which has been
such a big part of my college expe
rience that all came from
working on a farm [during my gap

year]," she said. "I didn't think it
would make a lasting impression
on me, [but] it really did."
Unlike Hodge, some gap year
students, such as British national
George Burgess 'l5, choose to de
vote themselves to a single proj
ect. Burgess used his year off to
expand EducationApps, an edu
cational mobile app business he
started while in high school. He
noted that being a young entre
preneur was difficult at times.
"It gets sort of lonely running
your own business at some
points," Burgess said. "For a long
time, it was just me working alone
the entire day, but it was definite

ly worthwhile."
Burgess added that many of his
peers took gap years, a popular
option for high school graduates
in England, according to the Wall
Street Journal.
"It seems like in the U.S. fewer
people are even familiar with this
idea," Burgess said. "I don't know
why because I think it's a fantastic
experience."
"It's the only chance you really
have to take an entire year off, and
not have any commitments, any
worries, work a bit, travel [or do]
whatever you're going to do. I just
think that sort of freedom doesn't
come too often in life," he added.

For Olympian Rachael Flatt
'l5, a gap year was a chance to
spend time honing her skill as a
figure skater. After a hectic senior
year, which included training for
the 2010 Winter Olympics and
taking four AP classes, Flatt said
she was "busy and exhausted."
"I needed a little bit more time
to sort everything out, and I really
wanted to give skating a good
shot, just focusing on training,"
she said.
While l latt's gap year provid
ed a respite from academic pres
sures, the intense focus on athlet
ics was draining at times.
"The hardest part about my
gap year was knowing that it was
solely about skating," Flatt said.
