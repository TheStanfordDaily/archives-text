## SEEING GREEN Climb every mountain 
### Holly Moeller 
QUEENSTOWN, NZ. Once
again, I was indebted to
Kathrin's driving skills. Al
ready foiled by my inability to
drive a car with manual transmis
sion, now I could only sit back as
she maneuvered our truck up the
four-wheel drive ski lift road. It
being austral summer, there was
n't a speck of snow in sight, but
there were plenty of trees. And as
usual, we were in search of one
species in particular: Douglas fir,
which is rapidly becoming a nasty
invasive species following its in
troduction from my North Ameri
can home.
This site, a few kilometers out
side of the city, was perhaps the
least remote of the places we'd
visit during our research in south
ern New Zealand. Most of the
time, we're privileged to work in
pretty isolated spots: Though my
field sites are marked by Douglas
fir plantations, an obvious human
modification, they generally lack
cell phone reception, paved roads
or other humans. I double-check
the first aid kit and emergency lo
cator beacon every time I shoul
der my pack.
We get off the beaten path par
ticularly quickly in New Zealand
because its human population
density is exceptionally low at
least, compared to that of the
United States (and my home state
of New Jersey in particular). Each
Kiwi could, in theory, sprawl out
over six hectares, or roughly a
dozen American football fields. Of
course, 71 percent of people live in
one of the country's urban centers,
which leaves a whole lot of real es
tate open to roving ecologists. By
comparison, we denizens of the
Lower 48 the contiguous Unit
ed States squat on just 2.5
hectares per person.
And yet, at the start of every
hike, we find the trappings of hu
manity. Usually it's a beer bottle or
two tossed at the side of the road.
(I once spotted the remains of an
entire case tucked discretely into
the shrubbery.) As we trek uphill,
the casual merrymakers drop out,
and we encounter only the occa
sional tramping hut, an overnight
bunkhouse for hikers, firewood
stacked neatly at its door.
Off-track, signs of human occu
pation are only indirect: Deer
browse here, pine saplings grow
there. Both species were deliber
ate human introductions to the
country. Likewise, the absence of
moa the famed giant flightless
birds, hunted to extinction around
A.D. 1400 and general silence
of the forests, whose songbirds
have been devastated by non-na
tive rats and possums, reveal
human impacts to the trained ob
server.
Inevitably, our field surveys
bring us above the tree line
which is, admittedly, exceptionally
low in New Zealand. Even here,
out among the tussock grasses
with spectacular views of a rugged,
untamed landscape, we find
wildling conifer seedlings, foreign
ers sprouting where no native tree
could stand.
It's easy to get depressed here
in New Zealand, where so many
human-introduced organisms are
overrunning the native flora and
fauna. But Aotearoa — as the
First Peoples call their homeland

is still a land of wildness. It's still
the place where you can hike for
days without encountering anoth
er human being. It's still the place
where city folk take off for the hills
over a weekend and return with
fresh venison in their packs. It's
still the place that calls those of us
who feel the urge to "get away
from it all."
I love New Zealand for this
reason for the same reason that
I loved Alaska when I worked
there so many years ago. I'm intox
icated by the knowledge that I am
looking out over distant peaks
that are rarely if ever visited
by humans. I don't consider myself
an explorer or trailblazer. I simply
like to reach the edge of human
civilization and look out over a
limitless landscape, as its edges
disappear beyond the horizon.
But just because something is
out of sight doesn't mean it's out
of reach.
Last week, the seventh episode
of the BBC's Frozen Planet series
aired here in New Zealand. This is
the infamous "climate change
episode," once deemed too con
troversial for American audi
ences. Sir David Attenborough
we were treated to the British ver
sion of the documentary, perhaps
as a reward for tolerating British
road rules points out shrinking
ice shelves and thinning per
mafrost, both signs of human im
pact even at the farthest extremes
of our world.
As it warms our poles and
mountaintops, climate change will
deliver even more untamed
wilderness into our hands. Un
doubtedly, we will press our advan
tage, first laying new tracks, before
charting opened shipping routes
and finally farming thawed soil.
But what of the beer bottle -
and cigarette butt-strewn rubble
we leave behind? Will this frontier
slide inexorably forward as well?
Will we call our domination of the
Earth complete? And what will it
mean for our humanity when we
do?

places she prefers not to reach.

mountaintops, climate change will
deliver even more untamed
wilderness into our hands. Un
doubtedly, we will press our advan
tage, first laying new tracks, before
charting opened shipping routes
and finally farming thawed soil.
But what of the beer bottle -
and cigarette butt-strewn rubble
we leave behind? Will this frontier
slide inexorably forward as well?
Will we call our domination of the
Earth complete? And what will it
mean for our humanity when we
do?

QUEENSTOWN, NZ. Once
again, I was indebted to
Kathrin's driving skills. Al
ready foiled by my inability to
drive a car with manual transmis
sion, now I could only sit back as
she maneuvered our truck up the
four-wheel drive ski lift road. It
being austral summer, there was
n't a speck of snow in sight, but
there were plenty of trees. And as
usual, we were in search of one
species in particular: Douglas fir,
which is rapidly becoming a nasty
invasive species following its in
troduction from my North Ameri
can home.
This site, a few kilometers out
side of the city, was perhaps the
least remote of the places we'd
visit during our research in south
ern New Zealand. Most of the
time, we're privileged to work in
pretty isolated spots: Though my
field sites are marked by Douglas
fir plantations, an obvious human
modification, they generally lack
cell phone reception, paved roads
or other humans. I double-check
the first aid kit and emergency lo
cator beacon every time I shoul
der my pack.
We get off the beaten path par
ticularly quickly in New Zealand
because its human population
density is exceptionally low at
least, compared to that of the
United States (and my home state
of New Jersey in particular). Each
Kiwi could, in theory, sprawl out
over six hectares, or roughly a
dozen American football fields. Of
course, 71 percent of people live in
one of the country's urban centers,
which leaves a whole lot of real es
tate open to roving ecologists. By
comparison, we denizens of the
Lower 48 the contiguous Unit
ed States squat on just 2.5
hectares per person.
And yet, at the start of every
hike, we find the trappings of hu
manity. Usually it's a beer bottle or
two tossed at the side of the road.
(I once spotted the remains of an
entire case tucked discretely into
the shrubbery.) As we trek uphill,
the casual merrymakers drop out,
and we encounter only the occa
sional tramping hut, an overnight
bunkhouse for hikers, firewood
stacked neatly at its door.
Off-track, signs of human occu
pation are only indirect: Deer
browse here, pine saplings grow
there. Both species were deliber
ate human introductions to the
country. Likewise, the absence of
moa the famed giant flightless
birds, hunted to extinction around
A.D. 1400 and general silence
of the forests, whose songbirds
have been devastated by non-na
tive rats and possums, reveal
human impacts to the trained ob
server.
Inevitably, our field surveys
bring us above the tree line
which is, admittedly, exceptionally
low in New Zealand. Even here,
out among the tussock grasses
with spectacular views of a rugged,
untamed landscape, we find
wildling conifer seedlings, foreign
ers sprouting where no native tree
could stand.
It's easy to get depressed here
in New Zealand, where so many
human-introduced organisms are
overrunning the native flora and
fauna. But Aotearoa — as the
First Peoples call their homeland

is still a land of wildness. It's still
the place where you can hike for
days without encountering anoth
er human being. It's still the place
where city folk take off for the hills
over a weekend and return with
fresh venison in their packs. It's
still the place that calls those of us
who feel the urge to "get away
from it all."
I love New Zealand for this
reason for the same reason that
I loved Alaska when I worked
there so many years ago. I'm intox
icated by the knowledge that I am
looking out over distant peaks
that are rarely if ever visited
by humans. I don't consider myself
an explorer or trailblazer. I simply
like to reach the edge of human
civilization and look out over a
limitless landscape, as its edges
disappear beyond the horizon.
But just because something is
out of sight doesn't mean it's out
of reach.
Last week, the seventh episode
of the BBC's Frozen Planet series
aired here in New Zealand. This is
the infamous "climate change
episode," once deemed too con
troversial for American audi
ences. Sir David Attenborough
we were treated to the British ver
sion of the documentary, perhaps
as a reward for tolerating British
road rules points out shrinking
ice shelves and thinning per
mafrost, both signs of human im
pact even at the farthest extremes
of our world.
As it warms our poles and
mountaintops, climate change will
deliver even more untamed
wilderness into our hands. Un
doubtedly, we will press our advan
tage, first laying new tracks, before
