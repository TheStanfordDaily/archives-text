# MODERN MANNERS
## Special Fees process needs reinventing 
### Jeff Mandell 
The Special Fees process ex
ists so that student groups
that want more than $6,000
in annual funding from student
government can take their re
quests directly to the student body
in the spring quarter elections.
There are three ways to get on the
ballot: for groups already receiving
Special Fees (and meeting a few
other requirements), approval of
their budgets by 60% of the Senate
is enough, while other groups must
collect the signatures of 10% of un
dergraduates plus Senate ap
proval, or they can bypass the Sen
ate completely with signatures of
15% of undergraduates.
The more groups that receive
Special Fees, the more students
are charged to supply the funding.
If there were only a few student
groups that needed Special Fees,
such that each application could
be scrutinized by campus media
and the voters, then perhaps the
system we have would make
sense. However, the reality is that
Special Fees allows dozens of stu
dent groups to pursue large
amounts of funding without much
oversight, and the natural result is
overfunding.
In last year's elections, 44 stu
dent groups' petitions for under
graduate Special Fees were ap
proved by voters, while two were
rejected. The rejects, Stanford
Chaparral and The Claw Maga
zine, both missed approval by less
than 2 percent of the vote. In a
brilliant act of satire-turned-truth,
The Stanford Flipside received
funding approval with 69 percent
of the vote, despite flaunting its in
tention to spend the bulk of the
money on a Segway in its weekly
satirical publication, purportedly
for "distribution." Unfortunately,
it appears that the stunt wasn't
enough to change the system.
Next year, maybe they should ask
for a hot air balloon or a camel to
further revolutionize their distri
bution efforts.
Clearly, many of the groups
that are currently petitioning to
be on this year's Special Fees bal
lot will have little reason to fear
rejection by the student body. Ac
cordingly, they do not have much
incentive to be economical. In the
majority of cases, asking for

$60,000 when $50,000 would suf
fice is not going to put a group's
approval in jeopardy. The result is
unnecessary spending that comes
out of students' pockets. Even
worse, the lack of accountability
reduces incentives for organizing
great campus events. Groups
would work harder if they
thought that their future funding
depended on proving their worth.
The problem is not that stu
dent groups are corrupt or waste
ful. When you are heavily in
volved in a community or a cause
that is important to you, it is only
natural to use all available re
sources to fulfill your vision, and it
is better to have money left over
than to have asked for too little. I
myself am a financial officer for
STAND, a group that fights
against genocide and other mass
atrocities. Though we do not make
use of Special Fees, I know from
experience how tricky it is even
within the General Fees system to
balance thriftiness with the need
to ensure that one's group has
enough cash to perform its func
tions. In the Special Fees system,
where a single all-or-nothing vote
determines budgets a year in ad
vance, the stakes are much higher.
When I vote on Special Fees, I
feel like I have to assume that
groups would cease operations if
they don't get approval. I don't
know if this is true or not many
groups do have other sources of
funding, and indeed the Chaparral
still received funding from the
ASSU this year. Like about 70 per
cent of voters, I end up voting yes
for nearly every group because,
being unfamiliar with many of
them, I am simply not qualified to
decide which group should get the
money and which shouldn't. It's
practically an invitation to be prej
udiced. If I vote for the Black Stu
dent Union, the Jewish Student As
sociation and the Queer-Straight
Alliance, how can I possibly justify
turning down the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization or Stan
ford Women in Business, given that
I know nothing about how any of
these groups operate?
Granting large sums of money
to student groups is too complex a
task for voters. It's ridiculous that
we're expected to gauge, in a few

minutes of spare time, which five
and six-figure requests are valid
and which are excessive. As hard
working students, we simply don't
have the time or the interest to
pore through forty-plus budgets,
and besides, the budgets are so
vaguely written that we still
wouldn't learn anything. To accu
rately evaluate requests, the
group leaders who write them
need to be questioned line-by-line
on how they plan to use their
funding and why they can be
trusted to do a good job.
We need a trusted student
committee that can take owner
ship of the entire Special Fees
process. Besides just voting pro
posals up or down, the committee
could work with student groups to
revise their budgets to appropri
ate spending levels. A process
overseen by people who actually
care about budgetary details is
sure to save money over the cur
rent system, which revolves
around voters who would proba
bly prefer that someone else did
the job.

Granting large sums of money
to student groups is too complex a
task for voters. It's ridiculous that
we're expected to gauge, in a few

minutes of spare time, which five
and six-figure requests are valid
and which are excessive. As hard
working students, we simply don't
have the time or the interest to
pore through forty-plus budgets,
and besides, the budgets are so
vaguely written that we still
wouldn't learn anything. To accu
rately evaluate requests, the
group leaders who write them
need to be questioned line-by-line
on how they plan to use their
funding and why they can be
trusted to do a good job.
We need a trusted student
committee that can take owner
ship of the entire Special Fees
process. Besides just voting pro
posals up or down, the committee
could work with student groups to
revise their budgets to appropri

overseen by people who actually
care about budgetary details is
sure to save money over the cur
rent system, which revolves
around voters who would proba

the job.

Granting large
sums of money to
student groups is
too complex a
task for voters.

The Special Fees process ex
ists so that student groups
that want more than $6,000
in annual funding from student
government can take their re
quests directly to the student body
in the spring quarter elections.
There are three ways to get on the
ballot: for groups already receiving
Special Fees (and meeting a few
other requirements), approval of
their budgets by 60% of the Senate
is enough, while other groups must
collect the signatures of 10% of un
dergraduates plus Senate ap
proval, or they can bypass the Sen
ate completely with signatures of
15% of undergraduates.
The more groups that receive
Special Fees, the more students
are charged to supply the funding.
If there were only a few student
groups that needed Special Fees,
such that each application could
be scrutinized by campus media
and the voters, then perhaps the
system we have would make
sense. However, the reality is that
Special Fees allows dozens of stu
dent groups to pursue large
amounts of funding without much
oversight, and the natural result is
overfunding.
In last year's elections, 44 stu
dent groups' petitions for under
graduate Special Fees were ap
proved by voters, while two were
rejected. The rejects, Stanford
Chaparral and The Claw Maga
zine, both missed approval by less
than 2 percent of the vote. In a
brilliant act of satire-turned-truth,
The Stanford Flipside received
funding approval with 69 percent
of the vote, despite flaunting its in
tention to spend the bulk of the
money on a Segway in its weekly
satirical publication, purportedly
for "distribution." Unfortunately,
it appears that the stunt wasn't
enough to change the system.
Next year, maybe they should ask
for a hot air balloon or a camel to
further revolutionize their distri
bution efforts.
Clearly, many of the groups
that are currently petitioning to
be on this year's Special Fees bal
lot will have little reason to fear
rejection by the student body. Ac
cordingly, they do not have much
incentive to be economical. In the
majority of cases, asking for

$60,000 when $50,000 would suf
fice is not going to put a group's
approval in jeopardy. The result is
unnecessary spending that comes
out of students' pockets. Even
worse, the lack of accountability
reduces incentives for organizing
great campus events. Groups
would work harder if they
thought that their future funding
depended on proving their worth.
The problem is not that stu
dent groups are corrupt or waste
ful. When you are heavily in
volved in a community or a cause
that is important to you, it is only
natural to use all available re
sources to fulfill your vision, and it
is better to have money left over
than to have asked for too little. I
myself am a financial officer for
STAND, a group that fights
against genocide and other mass
atrocities. Though we do not make
use of Special Fees, I know from
experience how tricky it is even
within the General Fees system to
balance thriftiness with the need
to ensure that one's group has
enough cash to perform its func
tions. In the Special Fees system,
where a single all-or-nothing vote
determines budgets a year in ad
vance, the stakes are much higher.
When I vote on Special Fees, I
feel like I have to assume that
groups would cease operations if
they don't get approval. I don't
know if this is true or not many
groups do have other sources of
funding, and indeed the Chaparral
still received funding from the
ASSU this year. Like about 70 per
cent of voters, I end up voting yes
for nearly every group because,
being unfamiliar with many of
them, I am simply not qualified to
decide which group should get the
money and which shouldn't. It's
practically an invitation to be prej
udiced. If I vote for the Black Stu
dent Union, the Jewish Student As
sociation and the Queer-Straight
Alliance, how can I possibly justify
