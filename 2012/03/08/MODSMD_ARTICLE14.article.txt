## Manning decision a no-brainer 
### Jack Blanchat 
By now, you've probably
heard that the great Pey
ton Manning's time is
over in Indianapolis.
Cue the Andrew Luck
era for the Colts.
But if you're aware that Peyton's
days in blue and white are over,
you've probably also seen the range
of immediate reactions to this mo
mentous announcement. For the
most part, those in the national
media are throwing up their hands,
asking Colts owner Jim Irsay how he
could do such a thing, promising that
Peyton will make the Colts rue the
day they ever cut him and damning
the cold and cruel business of foot
ball for ending the career of a legend
in such ignominious fashion.
But hold on just a second. Take a
step back and remove the emotions,
and you'll see that the Indianapolis
Colts organization did the only logi
cal thing for the prolonged success of
its football team.
You don't have to ignore how
great No. 18 is (was),but don't ignore
the facts in this situation. Peyton
Manning is old in football years,
missed the entirety of last season
with a significant neck injury and
was due a huge bonus that would
have forced the Colts to break the
bank for him, a guy who could con
ceivably never play in the NFL again
if there's any setback in his rehab
process.
When you're faced with all those
morbid details, holding the No. 1
pick in the draft and the incoming
player happens to be the most pro
ready NFL quarterback prospect
since Manning, the choice you
should make is obvious.
In the NFL, you always want to
get rid of a talented player too early
instead of too late, and when you've
got a younger talent waiting in the
wings, the choice becomes even eas
ier. That's why the Packers got rid of
Brett Favre for Aaron Rodgers.
That's why the 49ers got rid of Joe
Montana (who was better than
Manning, by the way) for Steve
Young. That's why the Patriots rou
tinely trade away great veteran play
ers to get draft picks, a strategy that
seems to work pretty well for them.
But instead of many in the media
fully realizing all these details, you
get writers like ESPN's Gene Woj
ciechowski making arguments for
why the Colts should have kept
Manning.
He writes, "Irsay would rather
roll the bones on Andrew Luck or
Robert Griffin 111 than on Manning.
Luck and RG3 have a combined
zero NFL snaps. Manning has a
Super Bowl ring and four league
MVP awards, and has thrown for
more yards in NFL history than
everyone except Brett Favre and
Dan Marino. And never mind what
caused this divorce or where he'll
end up next."
No, Gene, we have to mind what
caused this divorce. You can't ignore
Manning's bum neck just because of
what he did in the past. You also can't
ignore that you're sitting on the first
pick in the draft and all you have to
do to secure your team's future is
cash in your winning lottery ticket by
writing "Andrew Luck" on a piece of
paper in April.
Oh, but Gene says that's not
good enough. He continues, "Luck,
the presumptive No. 1 choice, was a
remarkable college quarterback.
But show me the documentation
that guarantees he'll be a remark
able NFL quarterback. I'll go read
and finish James Joyce's
"Ulysses" as you try to find that pa
perwork."
Tell you what, Gene, while I find
that paperwork on Luck, why don't
you go find the paperwork that says
Manning will definitely return to full
form once he hits the field. Oh, wait,
that paperwork doesn't exist... and
your argument is specious and total
ly idiotic. Once again, the Colts'
choice is obvious.
Finally, it's worth mentioning that
the way the Colts let go of Manning
was more than classy. They called a
press conference, laid out all the de
tails of the lamentable split, Irsay
and Manning both cried and Irsay
promised that no Colt would ever
wear No. 18 again.The Colts reiterat
ed just how important Manning will
forever be to their franchise and
wished him along in the classiest way
possible. We should all be so lucky
when we get fired.
So when you look at the whole of
this Peyton Manning situation, re
member that, at a certain point, we
all have to face facts. When Manning
gets into the Hall of Fame someday,
there's no way he'll deliver a bitter,
Michael Jordan-esque rant about
how the Colts slighted him by letting

him go. He, and we, all should realize
that this situation doesn't come up
often and the Colts made the
only logical decision.

Jack Blanchat just praised the Patri
ots for the first and last time in his
life. Kick him off the Brady Band

since Manning, the choice you
should make is obvious.
In the NFL, you always want to
get rid of a talented player too early
instead of too late, and when you've
got a younger talent waiting in the
wings, the choice becomes even eas
ier. That's why the Packers got rid of
Brett Favre for Aaron Rodgers.
That's why the 49ers got rid of Joe
Montana (who was better than
Manning, by the way) for Steve
Young. That's why the Patriots rou
tinely trade away great veteran play
ers to get draft picks, a strategy that
seems to work pretty well for them.
But instead of many in the media
fully realizing all these details, you
get writers like ESPN's Gene Woj
ciechowski making arguments for
why the Colts should have kept
Manning.
He writes, "Irsay would rather
roll the bones on Andrew Luck or
Robert Griffin 111 than on Manning.
Luck and RG3 have a combined
zero NFL snaps. Manning has a
Super Bowl ring and four league
MVP awards, and has thrown for
more yards in NFL history than
everyone except Brett Favre and
Dan Marino. And never mind what
caused this divorce or where he'll
end up next."
No, Gene, we have to mind what
caused this divorce. You can't ignore
Manning's bum neck just because of
what he did in the past. You also can't
ignore that you're sitting on the first
pick in the draft and all you have to
do to secure your team's future is
cash in your winning lottery ticket by
writing "Andrew Luck" on a piece of
paper in April.
Oh, but Gene says that's not
good enough. He continues, "Luck,
the presumptive No. 1 choice, was a
remarkable college quarterback.
But show me the documentation
that guarantees he'll be a remark
able NFL quarterback. I'll go read
and finish James Joyce's
"Ulysses" as you try to find that pa
perwork."
Tell you what, Gene, while I find
that paperwork on Luck, why don't
you go find the paperwork that says
Manning will definitely return to full
form once he hits the field. Oh, wait,
that paperwork doesn't exist... and
your argument is specious and total
ly idiotic. Once again, the Colts'
choice is obvious.
Finally, it's worth mentioning that
the way the Colts let go of Manning
was more than classy. They called a
press conference, laid out all the de
tails of the lamentable split, Irsay
and Manning both cried and Irsay
promised that no Colt would ever
wear No. 18 again.The Colts reiterat
ed just how important Manning will
forever be to their franchise and
wished him along in the classiest way
possible. We should all be so lucky
when we get fired.
So when you look at the whole of
this Peyton Manning situation, re
member that, at a certain point, we
all have to face facts. When Manning
gets into the Hall of Fame someday,
there's no way he'll deliver a bitter,
Michael Jordan-esque rant about
how the Colts slighted him by letting

him go. He, and we, all should realize
that this situation doesn't come up
often and the Colts made the
only logical decision.

By now, you've probably
heard that the great Pey
ton Manning's time is
over in Indianapolis.
Cue the Andrew Luck
era for the Colts.
But if you're aware that Peyton's
days in blue and white are over,
you've probably also seen the range
of immediate reactions to this mo
mentous announcement. For the
most part, those in the national
media are throwing up their hands,
asking Colts owner Jim Irsay how he
could do such a thing, promising that
Peyton will make the Colts rue the
day they ever cut him and damning
the cold and cruel business of foot
ball for ending the career of a legend
in such ignominious fashion.
But hold on just a second. Take a
step back and remove the emotions,
and you'll see that the Indianapolis
Colts organization did the only logi
cal thing for the prolonged success of
its football team.
You don't have to ignore how
great No. 18 is (was),but don't ignore
the facts in this situation. Peyton
Manning is old in football years,
missed the entirety of last season
with a significant neck injury and
was due a huge bonus that would
have forced the Colts to break the
bank for him, a guy who could con
ceivably never play in the NFL again
if there's any setback in his rehab
process.
When you're faced with all those
morbid details, holding the No. 1
pick in the draft and the incoming
player happens to be the most pro
ready NFL quarterback prospect
since Manning, the choice you
should make is obvious.
