# RUNAWAY RANDLE
## CARD ROUTS ASU IN OPENER 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
Chasson Randle may be just a freshman,
but he in no way seemed intimidated by his
first trip to the big stage of the Pac-12 tourna
ment. The guard was impossible to stop on
Wednesday night, scoring a career-high 30
points, as Stanford cruised by Arizona State
85-65 in the opening round.
The Cardinal (21-11,11-8 Pac-12) entered
the tournament as the No. 7 seed but appears
to be reverting back to the winning ways that
had it leading the Pac-12 at the start of the
season.
From the start, it was apparent that Ari
zona State (10-21,6-13) was again unable to
keep up with the Cardinal. Stanford proved
unstoppable from behind the arc early, as
Randle, sophomore guard Aaron Bright and
sophomore forward Anthony Brown con
nected on a series of threes. The Cardinal
went an incredible nine of 15 behind the
three-point line in the first half alone.
Throughout the first half, Randle demon
strated why he was named to the Pac-12 All-
Freshman team earlier this week. The guard
alternated between attacking the rim and
draining threes, shredding any defense
thrown at him. He had 27 of his 30 points in
the first half, setting a conference tournament
record for most points in a half, and also con
tributed three steals on the defensive end.
In an attempt to slow him down, the Sun
Devils resorted to fouling Randle almost
every time he touched the ball, and the fresh
man made them pay. A 73.8-percent free
throw shooter this season, Randle got 12 at
tempts from the free-throw line in the first
half and sunk 10 of them.
He was equally dangerous from the field,
hitting five of six threes in the first half and six
of eight on the game. He scored his 30 on just
11 shot attempts in the most efficient and pro
ductive game of his young career.
Despite his hot shooting hand, Randle
showed no interest in padding his stats in the
second half, preferring to get his teammates
into the action. He took just three shots, as
head coach Johnny Dawkins allowed the
bench to get some tournament experience.
The comfortable lead held by the Cardinal al
lowed Dawkins to rest his starters, knowing
that Stanford still has three more games to
win if it hopes to capture the Pac-12 title.
Overall, Dawkins has to be happy with
how the Stanford team played, as the Cardi
nal shot 47.3 percent from the field and 52.6
percent from three-point range, and out-re
bounded Arizona State 32-28. Stanford also
controlled the ball far better than usual, com
mitting just 10 turnovers.
With Arizona State behind them, Stanford
turns to a rematch with Cal, the tournament's
No. 2 seed. In their meeting Sunday, the Car
dinal defeated its rival 75-70, preventing the
Golden Bears from winning the Pac-12 regu
lar season title. Stanford would love to earn
its second victory over Cal in less than a week
by knocking them out of tournament-title
contention as well.

The Golden Bears will definitely not go
down without a fight, however. Not only do
they want to avenge the loss that cost them
the No. 1 seed, but a victory could ensure
them a spot in the NCAA tournament. Cal
and Washington are the only Pac-12 teams
with the potential to earn at-large bids, but an
early loss in the Pac-12 tournament would
greatly hurt their chances.
To beat Cal, Stanford has to do a better job
of stopping forward Harper Kamp and guard
Allen Crabbe. Kamp has averaged just 11.3
points and 5.1 rebounds per game this season,
but has put up an average of 17 and 6.5 in
Cal's two meetings with Stanford this year.
Crabbe, the Golden Bears' leading scorer,
has averaged 19 points against Stanford, well

above his 15.4 average for the season.
Another key to defeating Cal is to force
the Golden Bears to rely on their bench. Al
though Stanford has exceptional depth, Cal
does not, with the entire bench averaging just
five points per game against Stanford. If CaFs
starting lineup gets into foul trouble, like it
did last Sunday, the reserve unit will struggle
to pick up the scoring slack.
The Cardinal will face off with Cal tonight
at 6 p.m. at the Staples Center. The winner of
that matchup will face the winner of the 8:30
p.m. game between No. 3 seed Oregon and
No. 6 seed Colorado.
