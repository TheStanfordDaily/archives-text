# FAMILIAR TERRITORY
## WOMEN PURSUE NINTH TOURNAMENT TITLE 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After receiving a first-round bye, the Stanford
women's basketball team will begin its Pac-12 tourna
ment campaign today against Washington at the Galen
Center in Los Angeles. The No. 2 Cardinal looks to cap
ture the inaugural Pac-12 tournament title in addition to
the regular season title, which it clinched with a victory
over Oregon last month.
Top-seeded Stanford (28-1, 18-0 Pac-12) a team
that has appeared in every championship game since the
first Pac-10 tournament in 2002 hopes to pick up its
ninth tournament title this weekend, but it will need to
win three straight games on consecutive days. However,
the task is even harder for Washington (17-12, 8-10),
which defeated Oregon yesterday 72-56. Although the
Huskies will be buoyed by the momentum of yesterday's
victory, they would need to win four games in as many
days to take home the trophy, including tomorrow's un
even matchup against the Cardinal.
The Huskies are one of only two Pac-12 squads that
Stanford played just once this season, with the other being
their in-state rival, Washington State. The Cardinal won
that game back on Jan. 23,65-47, with a solid second-half
performance that made up for a tight opening period. But
if Stanford follows its season trend it has drastically
improved against all of the teams that gave it a tough ride
the first time around there should be no struggle
against the Huskies tomorrow. Stanford edged Oregon
State at Maples 67-60 and then routed the Beavers 78-45
in Corvallis, and the squad hung on to win 74-71 in over
time against California on the Farm before thrashing its
archrival 86-61 across the Bay last Sunday.
"I think we have been constantly growing since the be
ginning," said sophomore forward Chiney Ogwumike.

Chiney Ogwumike, above, was one of three Stanford players named to the All-Pac-12
team, along with sister Nnemkadi Ogwumike and Toni Kokenis. After a
first-round bye, the Card will open Pac-12 tournament play against Washington.
"We've never been too high, and
we've never been too low, and
that's a good thing because we
steadily keep improving. We're
just hoping to build off of our last
win at Cal... for the [Pac-12]
tournament, and then build on
that for the bigger tournament."
The recent Pac-12 awards hon
ored that steady progress, naming
senior forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike the Player of the Year; sister
Chiney the Defensive Player of
the Year; and both, along with
sophomore guard Toni Kokenis,
to the All-Pac-12 team. Head
coach Tara VanDerveer took
home the conference's Coach of
the Year award, and the Ogwu
mike sisters remain among the 15
players shortlisted for the nation
al John R. Wooden Player of the
Year. But with the regular season
now behind them, Stanford's
players face their biggest tests of
the season this weekend and in
the weeks to come.
"[We're taking it] just one day
at a time, really," Nnemkadi Og
wumike said. "At this point we're
only guaranteed two games, and
we want to play way more than
that. I think we're just taking
every day gratefully and trying to
have fun. I think when we have
fun, we do well, so that's kind of
what we're focusing on."
The Huskies were led in scor
ing through the regular season by
redshirt senior center Regina
Rogers and freshman point guard
Jazmine Davis, with averages of
16.3 and 16.2 points per game, re
spectively. The two were in excep
tional form against the Ducks
yesterday, with Davis putting up
23 points and Rogers 21. Wash
ington also had standout per
formances from freshman for
ward Aminah Williams and red
shirt senior forward Mackenzie
Argens, pulling down 16 and 10

rebounds, respectively.
In comparison, the Ogwumike
sisters have double-double sea
son averages, with 21.6 points per
game and 10.5 rebounds per
game for Nnemkadi, and 15.9 and

10.1 for Chiney. Although other
players might seem further off
statistically Kokenis and jun
ior forward Joslyn Tinkle come
next in scoring with 9.7 and 8.8
ppg, respectively multiple ca
reer highs have been set by many
of them over the season.
But despite the statistical edge
her team holds, VanDerveer is
taking nothing for granted this
weekend.
"We have to be hungry," Van-
Derveer said. "We have to go into
it no matter who we're playing,
and 1 think there's going to be
some really exciting basketball
with all the teams. There's such a
jumble there that you don't know
who you are going to play. Who
ever we play, if you're in that
championship game you're going
to have to play well."
The second-round contest of
the Pac-12 tournament between
Stanford and Washington will tip

that. I think we're just taking
every day gratefully and trying to
have fun. I think when we have
fun, we do well, so that's kind of
what we're focusing on."
The Huskies were led in scor
ing through the regular season by
redshirt senior center Regina
Rogers and freshman point guard
Jazmine Davis, with averages of
16.3 and 16.2 points per game, re
spectively. The two were in excep
tional form against the Ducks
yesterday, with Davis putting up
23 points and Rogers 21. Wash
ington also had standout per
formances from freshman for
ward Aminah Williams and red
shirt senior forward Mackenzie
Argens, pulling down 16 and 10

rebounds, respectively.
In comparison, the Ogwumike
sisters have double-double sea
son averages, with 21.6 points per
game and 10.5 rebounds per
game for Nnemkadi, and 15.9 and

10.1 for Chiney. Although other
players might seem further off
statistically Kokenis and jun
ior forward Joslyn Tinkle come
next in scoring with 9.7 and 8.8
ppg, respectively multiple ca
reer highs have been set by many
of them over the season.
But despite the statistical edge
her team holds, VanDerveer is
taking nothing for granted this
weekend.
"We have to be hungry," Van-
Derveer said. "We have to go into
it no matter who we're playing,
and 1 think there's going to be
some really exciting basketball
with all the teams. There's such a
jumble there that you don't know
who you are going to play. Who
ever we play, if you're in that
championship game you're going
to have to play well."
The second-round contest of
the Pac-12 tournament between
Stanford and Washington will tip
off today at 12 p.m. at the Galen
Center in Los Angeles.

After receiving a first-round bye, the Stanford
women's basketball team will begin its Pac-12 tourna
ment campaign today against Washington at the Galen
Center in Los Angeles. The No. 2 Cardinal looks to cap
ture the inaugural Pac-12 tournament title in addition to
the regular season title, which it clinched with a victory
over Oregon last month.
Top-seeded Stanford (28-1, 18-0 Pac-12) a team
that has appeared in every championship game since the
first Pac-10 tournament in 2002 hopes to pick up its
ninth tournament title this weekend, but it will need to
win three straight games on consecutive days. However,
the task is even harder for Washington (17-12, 8-10),
which defeated Oregon yesterday 72-56. Although the
Huskies will be buoyed by the momentum of yesterday's
victory, they would need to win four games in as many
days to take home the trophy, including tomorrow's un
even matchup against the Cardinal.
The Huskies are one of only two Pac-12 squads that
Stanford played just once this season, with the other being
their in-state rival, Washington State. The Cardinal won
that game back on Jan. 23,65-47, with a solid second-half
performance that made up for a tight opening period. But
if Stanford follows its season trend it has drastically
improved against all of the teams that gave it a tough ride
the first time around there should be no struggle
against the Huskies tomorrow. Stanford edged Oregon
State at Maples 67-60 and then routed the Beavers 78-45
in Corvallis, and the squad hung on to win 74-71 in over
time against California on the Farm before thrashing its
archrival 86-61 across the Bay last Sunday.
"I think we have been constantly growing since the be
ginning," said sophomore forward Chiney Ogwumike.

Chiney Ogwumike, above, was one of three Stanford players named to the All-Pac-12
team, along with sister Nnemkadi Ogwumike and Toni Kokenis. After a
first-round bye, the Card will open Pac-12 tournament play against Washington.
"We've never been too high, and
we've never been too low, and
that's a good thing because we
steadily keep improving. We're
just hoping to build off of our last
win at Cal... for the [Pac-12]
tournament, and then build on
that for the bigger tournament."
The recent Pac-12 awards hon
ored that steady progress, naming
senior forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike the Player of the Year; sister
Chiney the Defensive Player of
the Year; and both, along with
sophomore guard Toni Kokenis,
to the All-Pac-12 team. Head
coach Tara VanDerveer took
home the conference's Coach of
the Year award, and the Ogwu
mike sisters remain among the 15
players shortlisted for the nation
al John R. Wooden Player of the
Year. But with the regular season
now behind them, Stanford's
players face their biggest tests of
the season this weekend and in
the weeks to come.
"[We're taking it] just one day
at a time, really," Nnemkadi Og
wumike said. "At this point we're
only guaranteed two games, and
we want to play way more than
that. I think we're just taking
every day gratefully and trying to
have fun. I think when we have
