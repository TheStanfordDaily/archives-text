## WOMEN PURSUE NINTH TOURNAMENT TITLE 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After receiving a first-round bye, the Stanford
women's basketball team will begin its Pac-12 tourna
ment campaign today against Washington at the Galen
Center in Los Angeles. The No. 2 Cardinal looks to cap
ture the inaugural Pac-12 tournament title in addition to
the regular season title, which it clinched with a victory
over Oregon last month.
Top-seeded Stanford (28-1, 18-0 Pac-12) a team
that has appeared in every championship game since the
first Pac-10 tournament in 2002 hopes to pick up its
ninth tournament title this weekend, but it will need to
win three straight games on consecutive days. However,
the task is even harder for Washington (17-12, 8-10),
which defeated Oregon yesterday 72-56. Although the
Huskies will be buoyed by the momentum of yesterday's
victory, they would need to win four games in as many
days to take home the trophy, including tomorrow's un
even matchup against the Cardinal.
The Huskies are one of only two Pac-12 squads that
Stanford played just once this season, with the other being
their in-state rival, Washington State. The Cardinal won
that game back on Jan. 23,65-47, with a solid second-half
performance that made up for a tight opening period. But
if Stanford follows its season trend it has drastically
improved against all of the teams that gave it a tough ride
the first time around there should be no struggle
against the Huskies tomorrow. Stanford edged Oregon
State at Maples 67-60 and then routed the Beavers 78-45
in Corvallis, and the squad hung on to win 74-71 in over
time against California on the Farm before thrashing its
archrival 86-61 across the Bay last Sunday.
"I think we have been constantly growing since the be
ginning," said sophomore forward Chiney Ogwumike.
