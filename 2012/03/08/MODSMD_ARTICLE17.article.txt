# TROPICAL DEPRESSION
## 
### DANIEL LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
The month of March has
proven unkind to the No. 3 Stan
ford men's volleyball team. After
winning 12 of its first 15 matches,
the Cardinal has gone 2-2 in the
past week, entering a 22-day break
after last night's loss to No. 14
Hawaii in Maples Pavilion.
Wednesday evening's 3-1 de
feat (20-25,25-22,25-20,25-23) to
the Warriors was all the more
painful because just one night be
fore, Stanford (14-5, 11-4 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
beat Hawaii (7-12, 4-10) in the
same number of sets.
Moving forward, it will be in
teresting to see how the team re
sponds to real adversity for the
first time, A theme has developed
for the Cardinal despite consis
tent play from senior All-Ameri
cans Brad Lawson and Erik Shoji,
Stanford has struggled in matches
in which the supporting cast has
not been at its best which it will
need to address in order to be suc
cessful in the deep MPSF.
Tuesday night's match was suc
cessful for the Card due in large
part to sophomore Steven Irvin
and senior Gus Ellis. Irvin paced
the Cardinal with 19 kills en route
to a career-high night, and Ellis
was a perfect eight-for-eight on his
hitting attempts. The team won a
hard-fought match 22-25, 25-19,
25-18,25-23, the likes of which the

team's ardent supporters have
come to expect.
Despite losing a sloppy first set
in which the two teams combined
for 11 service errors, including
four in a row at one point, Stan
ford was able to find its footing in
the second. Trailing 8-10 after yet
another service error, the Card
embarked on a 10-3 run that was
catalyzed by an Ellis solo block.
After trading points for much of
the rest of the set, Ellis, alongside
sophomore Brian Cook, came up
with a crucial block to seal the set
for Stanford.
Stanford's offense, which had
struggled in the first two sets, came
to life in the third. The Cardinal
would hit .481 as a team for the
rest of the match, with Ellis and
Irvin leading the way.The two con
tributed 16 of their combined 27
kills in the final two games, includ
ing Irvin's eight fourth-quarter
kills and his match-deciding point.
On Wednesday night, the War
riors would return the favor in al
most identical fashion. Stanford
won the first set, holding Hawaii to
a .237 hitting percentage, by far its
lowest clip of the match, while the
Card hit .387.
The tides turned in the second
set for Hawaii, when the Cardi
nal's offense came to a halt. The
Warriors were able to best Stan
ford's lowly .194 hitting percent
age in the set by using a balanced
attack, with five different Hawaii
hitters registering kills in the set.

Senior Steven Hunt, who led
the Warriors with 22 kills in the
match, was instrumental in the
team's third set victory, registering
three early kills to give Hawaii a 5-
3 lead. Despite going back and
forth, Stanford was never able to
take the lead. Hawaii capitalized,
reeling off five straight points to
close out the set after blocking
Lawson.
The final set of the match be
longed to Hawaii freshman and
German national J.P. Marks, who
tallied eight of his career-high 18
kills in the final and deciding set.
Despite holding a 19-18 lead and
tying the score at 23, Stanford was
unable to come up with the big
plays necessary to prolong the
match one set further.
Cook and Lawson finished
with a combined 35 kills for the
Cardinal, but it was enough, as the
rest of the team hit a paltry .244.
Senior Evan Barry had 48 assists
and 12 digs in the loss.
Stanford will have an extended
break to rest and regroup before
resuming the grueling final stretch
of MPSF play.
"We will look at what weak
nesses they exploited and work to
fix those," Irvin said after the loss.
The Cardinal has until March
30 to work out the kinks, when it
will head to Malibu, Calif, to take
on Pepperdine.

tributed 16 of their combined 27
kills in the final two games, includ
ing Irvin's eight fourth-quarter
kills and his match-deciding point.
On Wednesday night, the War
riors would return the favor in al
most identical fashion. Stanford
won the first set, holding Hawaii to
a .237 hitting percentage, by far its
lowest clip of the match, while the
Card hit .387.
The tides turned in the second
set for Hawaii, when the Cardi
nal's offense came to a halt. The
Warriors were able to best Stan
ford's lowly .194 hitting percent
age in the set by using a balanced
attack, with five different Hawaii
hitters registering kills in the set.

Senior Steven Hunt, who led
the Warriors with 22 kills in the
match, was instrumental in the
team's third set victory, registering
three early kills to give Hawaii a 5-
3 lead. Despite going back and
forth, Stanford was never able to
take the lead. Hawaii capitalized,
reeling off five straight points to
close out the set after blocking
Lawson.
The final set of the match be
longed to Hawaii freshman and
German national J.P. Marks, who
tallied eight of his career-high 18
kills in the final and deciding set.
Despite holding a 19-18 lead and
tying the score at 23, Stanford was
unable to come up with the big
plays necessary to prolong the
match one set further.
Cook and Lawson finished
with a combined 35 kills for the
Cardinal, but it was enough, as the
rest of the team hit a paltry .244.
Senior Evan Barry had 48 assists
and 12 digs in the loss.
Stanford will have an extended
break to rest and regroup before
resuming the grueling final stretch
of MPSF play.
"We will look at what weak
nesses they exploited and work to
fix those," Irvin said after the loss.
The Cardinal has until March
30 to work out the kinks, when it
will head to Malibu, Calif, to take
on Pepperdine.

The No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball team suffered its second loss in a week and its fifth on the season. The
Card fell to No. 13 Hawaii in four sets on Wednesday after defeating the Warriors just one day before.
The month of March has
proven unkind to the No. 3 Stan
ford men's volleyball team. After
winning 12 of its first 15 matches,
the Cardinal has gone 2-2 in the
past week, entering a 22-day break
after last night's loss to No. 14
Hawaii in Maples Pavilion.
Wednesday evening's 3-1 de
feat (20-25,25-22,25-20,25-23) to
the Warriors was all the more
painful because just one night be
fore, Stanford (14-5, 11-4 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
beat Hawaii (7-12, 4-10) in the
same number of sets.
Moving forward, it will be in
teresting to see how the team re
sponds to real adversity for the
first time, A theme has developed
for the Cardinal despite consis
tent play from senior All-Ameri
cans Brad Lawson and Erik Shoji,
Stanford has struggled in matches
in which the supporting cast has
not been at its best which it will
need to address in order to be suc
cessful in the deep MPSF.
Tuesday night's match was suc
cessful for the Card due in large
part to sophomore Steven Irvin
and senior Gus Ellis. Irvin paced
the Cardinal with 19 kills en route
to a career-high night, and Ellis
was a perfect eight-for-eight on his
hitting attempts. The team won a
hard-fought match 22-25, 25-19,
25-18,25-23, the likes of which the

team's ardent supporters have
come to expect.
Despite losing a sloppy first set
in which the two teams combined
for 11 service errors, including
four in a row at one point, Stan
ford was able to find its footing in
the second. Trailing 8-10 after yet
another service error, the Card
embarked on a 10-3 run that was
catalyzed by an Ellis solo block.
After trading points for much of
the rest of the set, Ellis, alongside
sophomore Brian Cook, came up
with a crucial block to seal the set
for Stanford.
Stanford's offense, which had
struggled in the first two sets, came
to life in the third. The Cardinal
would hit .481 as a team for the
rest of the match, with Ellis and
Irvin leading the way.The two con
tributed 16 of their combined 27
kills in the final two games, includ
ing Irvin's eight fourth-quarter
kills and his match-deciding point.
