### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
"The danger in Ciudad Juarez is to be alive," said Judith
Torrea, a John S. Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford,
speaking Wednesday night at the Women's Community
Center on her experience as an award-winning journalist
and blogger.
Torrea, who is originally from Spain, won the Re
porters Without Borders 808 (Best of Blogs) award in
2011 for reporting from the front line of the Mexican drug
conflict in her blog "Ciudad Juarez, en la sombra del nar
cotrafico". The title, when translated to English, reads
"Ciudad Juarez, under the shadow of drug trafficking."
Ciudad Juarez, a Mexican town that borders the Texan
city of El Paso, is one of the most dangerous cities in the
world and is a focal point of Mexican President Felipe
Calderon's "war on drug trafficking." Torrea estimated
that there have been over 10,000 deaths by violence in the
city since the "war on drug trafficking" was launched in
2006.
Torrea said that, while working for the Spanish-lan
guage People magazine in New York City from 2007 to
2009, she witnessed how the celebrity culture of drug
usage in the United States is linked to the drug conflict in

Mexico. In 2009, she left her post
at People and moved back to Ciu
dad Juarez.
"People thought I was crazy
because they were trying to leave
and I was coming back," she said.
"But I felt obligated to tell socie
ty what was happening."
"I found the life, the happiness
[in Ciudad Juarez] that I do not
find in other parts of the world,"
she added. "It is not a beautiful
city, but the people are amazing."
During her talk,Torrea shared
a slideshow of her photos from
Ciudad Juarez and recounted
several anecdotes from her time
reporting and living in the city.
She emphasized that she wit
nessed firsthand how accounts of
events in Ciudad Juarez put for
ward by the Mexican authorities
rarely match what is really hap
pening on the ground.
She criticized the security,
business and governmental insti
tutions in Mexico, citing their cor
ruption and ineffectiveness. Tor
rea also claimed that the
Calderon administration started
the "so-called war on drugs" be
cause it had links to the Sinaloa
Cartel, and thus had an interest in
defeating the Juarez Cartel.
Torrea said the outspoken na
ture of her blog posts has led to
threats from government and se
curity officials, but she remains
undeterred.
"When you are a journalist,
you do not need to believe any
thing that somebody is telling
you, you need to prove what is re
ally happening," she said. "The
only thing I am afraid of is not
doing what I know I need to do."
Torrea also said she is passion
ate about representing the voice
of the people rather than focusing
on the voice of the "powerful," in
addition to avoiding characteriz
ing people by labels of "good"

and "evil" a negative trait she
attributed to the mainstream
media.
She recounted meetings with
those involved in the drug trade
in Ciudad Juarez who have no op
portunity for further education
and employment.
"They are trapped in a prison
in the desert... They turn to con
suming drugs then being involved
in a cartel," she said. "This is a
world of people with no opportu
nities they did not choose to
be born into this."
"The Calderon administration
is trying to change the image of
Ciudad Juarez .. . They should
change the reality instead," she
added.
As a project for her Knight
Fellowship, Torrea intends to
build a multimedia platform for
women bloggers in conflict zones
worldwide. She said her next step
will be to recruit Stanford stu
dents to help with programming,
translation and networking.
"Silicon Valley might be pri
marily men but it is women who
are making the most difference
with technology in conflict
zones," she said.
After her talk, audience mem
bers raised questions on topics
ranging from her work as a jour
nalist to her thoughts on policy is
sues.
Responding to a question on
the difficulties of being a female
journalist in a conflict zone, Tor
rea said, "I think women are often
better at reporting the situation
because of the instinctive sensi
tivity they bring to the story."
"It's fascinating to hear her
story and how she risked her life
to provide the facts," said audi
ence member Shahab Fadavi 'l5.
"It was a genuinely inspiring
talk."
Torrea's talk was part of a se
ries of events put on this week to
recognize International Women's
Week.
