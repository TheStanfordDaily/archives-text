# Faculty predict long primary
## Super Tuesday results suggest race will continue until convention 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
While Mitt Romney's six victories
in the "Super Tuesday" Republican
primaries will allow him to maintain
his status as the presumptive Republi
can presidential nominee, a protract
ed and ugly battle for primary dele
gates could continue even up to the
August convention, according to Stan
ford faculty observers.
Romney, a former governor of
Massachusetts, currently holds 415
delegates, more than the combined to
tals of the other contenders, and will
require 1,144 delegates to clinch the
nomination. The Romney campaign
has sought to portray his victories on
Tuesday including a narrow win in
the crucial battleground state of Ohio
and his superiority in the delegate
count as cues for the Republican party
to coalesce behind his candidacy.
Bill Whalen, a research fellow at
the Hoover Institution, expressed

skepticism, however, that the Super
Tuesday results changed the dynamic
of the primary race, arguing that
while Newt Gingrich and Rick Santo
rum remain Romney's principal chal
lengers no candidate offered a par
ticularly strong performance.
"There was no big winner on Tues
day, but Romney avoided a disaster,"

said Tammy Frisby, lecturer in political
science and a research fellow at the
Hoover Institution. "To say he was a
big winner is to overplay what he ac
complished."
Whalen described both Santo
rum's comfortable victory in Ten
nessee despite indications of a
surge by Romney in the days before
the primary and the narrowness of
Romney's margin of victory in Ohio
as surprising outcomes.
"Romney won by 10,000 votes in a
state where he outspent Santorum 4 to
1, in a state where he was far more or
ganized than Santorum," Whalen said.
Despite Romney's substantial lead
in delegates, Whalen noted that his in
ability to connect with socially conser
vative Republicans and his failure
to mobilize the Republican base
could create a problematic enthusi
asm gap for the party in the upcoming
general election against President
