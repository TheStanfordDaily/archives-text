# Faculty predict long primary
## Super Tuesday results suggest race will continue until convention 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
While Mitt Romney's six victories
in the "Super Tuesday" Republican
primaries will allow him to maintain
his status as the presumptive Republi
can presidential nominee, a protract
ed and ugly battle for primary dele
gates could continue even up to the
August convention, according to Stan
ford faculty observers.
Romney, a former governor of
Massachusetts, currently holds 415
delegates, more than the combined to
tals of the other contenders, and will
require 1,144 delegates to clinch the
nomination. The Romney campaign
has sought to portray his victories on
Tuesday including a narrow win in
the crucial battleground state of Ohio
and his superiority in the delegate
count as cues for the Republican party
to coalesce behind his candidacy.
Bill Whalen, a research fellow at
the Hoover Institution, expressed

skepticism, however, that the Super
Tuesday results changed the dynamic
of the primary race, arguing that
while Newt Gingrich and Rick Santo
rum remain Romney's principal chal
lengers no candidate offered a par
ticularly strong performance.
"There was no big winner on Tues
day, but Romney avoided a disaster,"

said Tammy Frisby, lecturer in political
science and a research fellow at the
Hoover Institution. "To say he was a
big winner is to overplay what he ac
complished."
Whalen described both Santo
rum's comfortable victory in Ten
nessee despite indications of a
surge by Romney in the days before
the primary and the narrowness of
Romney's margin of victory in Ohio
as surprising outcomes.
"Romney won by 10,000 votes in a
state where he outspent Santorum 4 to
1, in a state where he was far more or
ganized than Santorum," Whalen said.
Despite Romney's substantial lead
in delegates, Whalen noted that his in
ability to connect with socially conser
vative Republicans and his failure
to mobilize the Republican base
could create a problematic enthusi
asm gap for the party in the upcoming
general election against President


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
Barack Obama.
While attaining 1,144 dele
gates may be mathematically im
probable for Santorum and Gin
grich, Whalen said that if both
continue to siphon off delegates
from Romney's tally, they may
have the opportunity to block
Romney from winning on the first
ballot at the Republican conven
tion.
Romney's reliance on narrow
plurality wins has led to increased
vulnerability and, in Whalen's es
timation, the race's possible con
tinuation up to the June 5 Califor
nia primary.
"If the race continues on its
current trajectory, Romney can
win the majority of the delegates
before the convention," Frisby
said.
However, citing Santorum and
Gingrich's refusals to drop out of
the race, she added, "Super Tues
day did nothing to change the
likelihood that we're going all the
way to the convention."
Whalen further downplayed
the chances of Santorum or Gin
grich winning the nomination,
noting that even though Santo
rum had won states around the
country unlike Gingrich, who

has only won so far in Georgia
and South Carolina his losses
in Ohio and Michigan diminished
his assertion that he could be
competitive in blue-collar states
in a general election.
Whalen said that Obama
could be the principal beneficiary
of the Republicans' intra-party
conflict, citing the negative effects
of the protracted primary's heat
ed rhetoric. He added that the
uninspiring victory margins could
hurt Romney's popularity with
independent voters.
"The longer Republicans fight
each other, the more presidential
Barack Obama looks," Whalen
said. "He looks like a leader, and
the Republicans look divided."
Frisby highlighted the 2008
Democrat primary contest be
tween Hillary Clinton and
Obama as evidence that an ex
tended primary has the potential
to produce a tested and polished
candidate, but disputed the no
tion that any such benefits are
currently accruing to the Repub
lican contenders.
"You want to move into the
general election with a strong or
ganization and a clear message,"
Frisby said. "The Republicans ap
pear to be failing on that dramat
ically ... The lack of a compelling
message is quite striking."

as surprising outcomes.
"Romney won by 10,000 votes in a
state where he outspent Santorum 4 to
1, in a state where he was far more or
ganized than Santorum," Whalen said.
Despite Romney's substantial lead
in delegates, Whalen noted that his in
ability to connect with socially conser
vative Republicans and his failure
to mobilize the Republican base
could create a problematic enthusi
asm gap for the party in the upcoming
general election against President


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
Barack Obama.
While attaining 1,144 dele
gates may be mathematically im
probable for Santorum and Gin
grich, Whalen said that if both
continue to siphon off delegates
from Romney's tally, they may
have the opportunity to block
Romney from winning on the first
ballot at the Republican conven
tion.
Romney's reliance on narrow
plurality wins has led to increased
vulnerability and, in Whalen's es
timation, the race's possible con
tinuation up to the June 5 Califor
nia primary.
"If the race continues on its
current trajectory, Romney can
win the majority of the delegates
before the convention," Frisby
said.
However, citing Santorum and
Gingrich's refusals to drop out of
the race, she added, "Super Tues
day did nothing to change the
likelihood that we're going all the
way to the convention."
Whalen further downplayed
the chances of Santorum or Gin
grich winning the nomination,
noting that even though Santo
rum had won states around the
country unlike Gingrich, who

has only won so far in Georgia
and South Carolina his losses
in Ohio and Michigan diminished
his assertion that he could be
competitive in blue-collar states
in a general election.
Whalen said that Obama
could be the principal beneficiary
of the Republicans' intra-party
conflict, citing the negative effects
of the protracted primary's heat
ed rhetoric. He added that the
uninspiring victory margins could
hurt Romney's popularity with
independent voters.
"The longer Republicans fight
each other, the more presidential
Barack Obama looks," Whalen
said. "He looks like a leader, and
the Republicans look divided."
Frisby highlighted the 2008
Democrat primary contest be
tween Hillary Clinton and
Obama as evidence that an ex
tended primary has the potential
to produce a tested and polished
candidate, but disputed the no
tion that any such benefits are
currently accruing to the Repub
lican contenders.
"You want to move into the
general election with a strong or
ganization and a clear message,"
Frisby said. "The Republicans ap
pear to be failing on that dramat
ically ... The lack of a compelling
message is quite striking."
