## Mother-son pair discusses startups 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Entrepreneurship Week which ex
tended three days past its usual weeklong time peri
od this year concluded Wednesday with a joint
presentation by entrepreneur Sandra Kurtzig and
her son Andy Kurtzig. The duo shared their experi
ences founding companies, and advised those in at
tendance to seek out work that inspires them.
As founder of ASK Corporation in 1972, Sandra
Kurtzig spent much of her career selling minicom
puters precursors of modern PCs to business
es. ASK is best known for its Man Man brand, an ab
breviation for the manufacturing management soft
ware the company sold.
Despite her success with decades-old computer
hardware, Kurtzig encouraged audience members
to stay ahead of trends and anticipate future oppor
tunities.
"When everything else is trying to go into a par
ticular market... that's probably the time to start
thinking about what the next market is going to be,"
she said.
Sandra Kurtzig is currently chairman and CEO
of Kenandy, a company she founded in 2010 with the
intent of bringing social platforms to business and
manufacturing.
"We think the next market is going to be [busi
ness to business]," she said, referring to companies
such as ASK and Kenandy that sell services prima
rily to enterprise customers.
Andy Kurtzig followed in his mother's footsteps
on the entrepreneurial track.
"He's really been an entrepreneur, a serial entre
preneur, since he's been a kid," said Sandra Kurtzig,
recounting a story of Andy selling balloons during a
party in his childhood. "He continues to have ideas
one after another all his life."

Andy Kurtzig, founder of JustAnswer, spoke about his entrepreneurial
endeavours as part of Stanford Entrepreneurship Week. He was
joined by his mother Sandra, founder of ASK Corporation.
Andy Kurtzig currently
CEO of Just Answer, a company he
founded in 2003 then spoke
about his own experiences, recall
ing personal stories of wanting to
drop out of college to follow his en
trepreneurial dreams.
"All the superstars, Steve Jobs,
Bill Gates, etc, dropped out of col
lege and were super successful,"
Andy Kurtzig said. He added that
his mother convinced him to gradu
ate a year early from the University
of California, Berkeley instead of
dropping out.
Andy shared several stories of
his ultimately unsuccessful ideas to
illustrate his method of testing a
market. One of his early online en
terprises, a website called File Fun,
tried to create a resell market for

music and other files online, a con
cept quickly ended by Apple's in
clusion of Digital Rights Manage
ment (DRM) software in its music.
Another site he created.
Darester, tried to apply the eßay
online auction model to sell servic
es instead of goods. Kurtzig started
the venture with auctioning off
dares in a college setting, offering
the example of paying someone to
shove a pie in an employer's face,
"After two months ... I realized
it was not the kind of business I
wanted to be in," he said, laughing
at the unexpected ways people
used the service.
With persistence, however,
Andy Kurtzig found major success
with his current company, Just A
nswer.
He attributed the company's
conceptual origins to his wife's
pregnancy, when despite her fre
quent medical questions she
had less frequent access to doctors
for qualified and timely medical ad

vice. Following the experience,
Andy Kurtzig decided to create a
service that provides personalized
and on-demand help from real doc
tors, lawyers and other specialists.
He emphasized the lengthy hir
ing and verification process, which
includes everything from standard
ized tests to software verification.
"It's actually harder to become
a Just Answer expert than it is to get
into Stanford," he quipped.
Andy Kurtzig stressed that,
more so than simply working for
money, entrepreneurs have to love
what they do.
"It's really important that
you're passionate about making a
difference in the world," he said. "I
get letters all the time from cus
tomers that say, 'You saved my
daughter's life' and things like that.
That's what we do. We help people
all day."

about his own experiences, recall
ing personal stories of wanting to
drop out of college to follow his en
trepreneurial dreams.
"All the superstars, Steve Jobs,
Bill Gates, etc, dropped out of col
lege and were super successful,"
Andy Kurtzig said. He added that
his mother convinced him to gradu
ate a year early from the University
of California, Berkeley instead of
dropping out.
Andy shared several stories of
his ultimately unsuccessful ideas to
illustrate his method of testing a
market. One of his early online en
terprises, a website called File Fun,
tried to create a resell market for

music and other files online, a con
cept quickly ended by Apple's in
clusion of Digital Rights Manage
ment (DRM) software in its music.
Another site he created.
Darester, tried to apply the eßay
online auction model to sell servic
es instead of goods. Kurtzig started
the venture with auctioning off
dares in a college setting, offering
the example of paying someone to
shove a pie in an employer's face,
"After two months ... I realized
it was not the kind of business I
wanted to be in," he said, laughing
at the unexpected ways people
used the service.
With persistence, however,
Andy Kurtzig found major success
with his current company, Just A
nswer.
He attributed the company's
conceptual origins to his wife's
pregnancy, when despite her fre
quent medical questions she
had less frequent access to doctors
for qualified and timely medical ad

vice. Following the experience,
Andy Kurtzig decided to create a
service that provides personalized
and on-demand help from real doc
tors, lawyers and other specialists.
He emphasized the lengthy hir
ing and verification process, which
includes everything from standard
ized tests to software verification.
"It's actually harder to become
a Just Answer expert than it is to get
into Stanford," he quipped.
Andy Kurtzig stressed that,
more so than simply working for
money, entrepreneurs have to love
what they do.
"It's really important that
you're passionate about making a
difference in the world," he said. "I
get letters all the time from cus
tomers that say, 'You saved my
daughter's life' and things like that.
That's what we do. We help people
all day."
