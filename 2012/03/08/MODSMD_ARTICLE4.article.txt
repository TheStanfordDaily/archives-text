As founder of ASK Corporation in 1972, Sandra
Kurtzig spent much of her career selling minicom
puters precursors of modern PCs to business
es. ASK is best known for its Man Man brand, an ab

ware the company sold.
Despite her success with decades-old computer
hardware, Kurtzig encouraged audience members
to stay ahead of trends and anticipate future oppor
tunities.
"When everything else is trying to go into a par
ticular market... that's probably the time to start
thinking about what the next market is going to be,"
she said.
Sandra Kurtzig is currently chairman and CEO
of Kenandy, a company she founded in 2010 with the
intent of bringing social platforms to business and
manufacturing.
"We think the next market is going to be [busi
ness to business]," she said, referring to companies
such as ASK and Kenandy that sell services prima
rily to enterprise customers.
Andy Kurtzig followed in his mother's footsteps
on the entrepreneurial track.
"He's really been an entrepreneur, a serial entre
preneur, since he's been a kid," said Sandra Kurtzig,
recounting a story of Andy selling balloons during a
party in his childhood. "He continues to have ideas
one after another all his life."
