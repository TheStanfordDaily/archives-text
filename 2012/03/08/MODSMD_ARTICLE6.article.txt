## Prenatal test raises ethical questions 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recently developed and newly released Stan
ford-created blood test can detect Down syndrome
and two other major genetic defects at early stages of
pregnancy. Experts have expressed concerns, howev
er, about the ethics of knowing a fetus's genetics dur
ing a period of pregnancy when abortion is both safer
and more commonly legal.
The $1,200 test, which analyzes fetal DNA in ex
pectant mothers at 10 weeks, is being offered by Veri
nata Health a Redwood City biotechnology com
panyâ€” which licensed a technique designed by
Stanford biophysicist Stephen Quake.
A Verinata-sponsored clinical trial, published in
the journal of the American Congress of Obstetrics
and Gynecology, demonstrated the test's effective
ness. The technique was able to predict all 89 cases of
Down syndrome in 532 maternal blood samples, 35 of
36 cases of Edwards syndrome and 11 of 14 cases of
Patau syndrome.
The new test offers the possibil
ity of being able to examine fetal
DNA as early as five weeks into
pregnancy and to test it with just a
blood drop, according to Stanford
Law School professor and tech
nology ethics expert Hank Greely
'74.
The blood test eliminates the
risk of more invasive tests such as
amniocentesis, which can only be
carried out later in pregnancy and
create a higher risk of miscarriage.
The blood test counts the millions
of free-floating fetal DNA in ma
ternal blood, detecting excessive
genetic material that might signal a
birth defect.
"This would not entirely re
place the more invasive method of
amniocentesis, but it might signifi
cantly reduce the number of moth
ers that undergo amniocentesis,"
wrote Ahmad Salehi, a clinical as
sociate professor in the Stanford
School of Medicine, in an email to
The Daily.
"This is the first step toward a
real transformation to how we
have babies in this country," Greely
said. "We've been able to do prena

tal testing for over forty years but it
involves difficult, expensive, un
pleasant, risky procedures. This is
no long needle or invasive proce
dure."
"There are five million preg
nancies in the world and 2 percent
get genetic testing," Greely added.
"In a few years, this kind of testing
will be very common."
While testing is currently limit
ed to Down syndrome, Edwards
syndrome and Patau syndrome,
the technique may be broadly ap
plied in the future.
"Soon you will be able to look at
any section of the genome you
want," Greely said. Doctors would
be able to see if the fetus has Tay
Sachs disease, sickle cell anemia, "if
they're a redhead, a boy or a girl."
The test opens up "broader dis
cussions," according to Greely.
"We need to let parents have
complete decision-making power,"
he added. "It's just better than hav
ing the government decide what
you can and can't do in pregnancy."
"I believe the availability of
rather easy techniques for prenatal
detection of Down syndrome
would be like a double-edged
sword," Salehi wrote. "On the one
hand, it may lead to an increase in
abortion rates of fetuses with
Down syndrome. However, it may
also open up a new window for

early detection and treatment."
"It needs to become more ac
curate to become diagnostic.
Right now it's recognized as
screening, not as diagnostic,"
added Greely. "By making it easi
er to test you make it easier to ter
minate pregnancies you don't

want. It raises some hard ques
tions for some people."
"Our research has shown that
among more than 300 genes tripli
cated in Down syndrome there are
a few genes that play major roles in
cognitive disabilities," Salehi
wrote. "For this reason, targeting

these specific genes and reducing
their expression to normal in utero
might be a fundamental therapy
for children with Down syn
drome."
