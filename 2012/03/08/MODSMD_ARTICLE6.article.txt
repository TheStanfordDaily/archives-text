## Prenatal test raises ethical questions 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recently developed and newly released Stan
ford-created blood test can detect Down syndrome
and two other major genetic defects at early stages of
pregnancy. Experts have expressed concerns, howev
er, about the ethics of knowing a fetus's genetics dur
ing a period of pregnancy when abortion is both safer
and more commonly legal.
The $1,200 test, which analyzes fetal DNA in ex
pectant mothers at 10 weeks, is being offered by Veri
nata Health a Redwood City biotechnology com
panyâ€” which licensed a technique designed by
Stanford biophysicist Stephen Quake.
A Verinata-sponsored clinical trial, published in
the journal of the American Congress of Obstetrics
and Gynecology, demonstrated the test's effective
ness. The technique was able to predict all 89 cases of
Down syndrome in 532 maternal blood samples, 35 of
36 cases of Edwards syndrome and 11 of 14 cases of
Patau syndrome.
