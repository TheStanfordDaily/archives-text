## PA Fire Chiefs sign new contract, concede cuts 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marshall Watkins 
The Palo Alto City Council
voted Monday in favor of a new
contract with the city's Fire Chiefs'
Association that will save the city
tens of thousands of dollars in up
coming years. The council's vote
was unanimous.
The agreement matches similar
concessions made previously by
other labor groups with the intent
of helping to cut municipal spend
ing and to balance the city budget.
The new contract will save the
city approximately $51,000 in fiscal
year 2012 and nearly $84,000 in fis
cal year 2013, according to a report
by the city's human resources de
partment. The bulk of the savings
will be achieved through the dis
continuation of bonuses provided
in exchange for meeting perform
ance targets, and through associa
tion members funding 10 percent
of their medical premiums for the
first time.
A further reform included in
the contract will reduce the city's
pension obligations to new associ

ation employees. The reform,
which will include increasing the
retirement age from 50 to 55, isn't
expected to generate savings for
the city until fiscal year 2015.
