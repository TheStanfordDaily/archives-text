# Stanford-based group develops earthquake warning system
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Marshall Watkins 
Quake-Catcher Network, a
Stanford-based group, has devel
oped a network of seismic sensors
capable of giving subscribers ad
vance warning of imminent earth
quakes. The network detected
Monday morning's 4.0 magnitude
earthquake 10 seconds before it hit
Stanford.
The network employs around
2,000 inexpensive seismic sensors
plugged into volunteers' comput
ers, which communicate with
Stanford servers over the Inter
net. The system has the ability to
warn customers electronically
by means such as text message or

email as far ahead as tens of
seconds before the strongest
shaking occurs, allowing them to
take cover.
Corporate clients can also use
this warning system, allowing
firms to save documents, turn off
sensitive equipment or stop eleva
tors at the nearest floor to allow
passengers to escape. Subscribers
would also receive a post-earth
quake notification noting the
tremor's magnitude and duration.
"The concept is ultimately to
get to the place where we can reli
ably identify and characterize
earthquakes before they've ex
panded to the surrounding re
gions," said Jesse Mitchell, net
work co-founder and assistant
geophysics professor, to the Stan
ford News Service.
Quake-Catcher Network's seis
mic sensors range from $3O to $l5O
in cost —as compared to tradi
tional prices upwards of $3,000
allowing the group to create a larg
er network and thus enjoy greater
accuracy and detection rates while
covering a larger area.
"There's an amazing amount of
science that one can do with lots
and lots of sensors, science that's
much harder to do when you have
fewer sensors," Mitchell said.
