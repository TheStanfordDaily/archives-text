# OPEN SOURCE CANDIDATES Daniel Koning and Kian Ameli

### 
| The Stanford Chaparral decided to field a slate with
a unique twist this year, taking the idea of "crowdsourc
ing" to its extreme the entire slate can be defined and
modified by anyone.
Daniel Koning 'l4 and Kian Ameli 'l3, sporting
matching aviators and gloves, answered questions about
their slate's platform with poetic waxing on moonlight,
and discussed the moral implications of supporting food
trucks which the pair suggested may run someone
over on campus.
An interesting moment came when Ameli defined
his vision for the role of the ASSU vice president.
"It's a subtly domineering role," Ameli said, turning
to Koning to ask, "You're OK with that right?"
"You're my anchor, and I love you for that," respond
ed Koning.
"Right," Amelia said. "Another way to say it would
be, 'first the worst, second the best'."
Despite their unconventional methods, don't jump
to label the pair a "joke-slate" they see themselves as
the "channel for democracy."
"If people choose to treat us as a joke, we'll never rise
above that," said Koning. "But remember, this is democ
ratization. The people decide."
"Well," qualified Ameli, "whoever edits the Wiki de
cides."
Two of the tamer suggestions currently on the cam
paign's wiki are banning all police from campus on
weekends and dissolving the ASSU Senate.
