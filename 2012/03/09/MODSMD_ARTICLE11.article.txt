| Stewart Macgregor-Dennis, current ASSU Vice-
President, is widely credited with forming the new en
trepreneur-themed dorm on campus. In fact, he's a bit of
a campus celebrity, earning his own meme on the Stan
ford meme page "MemeChu" and going around to
freshmen dorms to talk with students about the ASSU.
While it was common knowledge Macgregor-Dennis
would run for ASSU Executive, his running mate re
mained a question mark until now. Druthi Ghanta
'l4 has never been involved in the ASSU, though Mac
gregor-Dennis praised her for her effectiveness.
"Her more service-oriented and non-profit back
ground combines well with my slightly more entrepre
neurial background," said Macgregor-Dennis, adding
that the pair had "synergy" when they met recently to
discuss running together.
Due to being ill, Ghanta was not available to inter
view with The Daily before publication.
Though Macgregor-Dennis and Ghanta will not re
lease their full platform until the beginning of spring
quarter, Macgregor-Dennis cited several items, such as
hard liquor consumption on campus and the lack of
housing for international students during winter break,
as examples of challenges he hopes to tackle.
"We don't have to go through the lengthy process of
building relationships and figuring out how the ASSU
works," Macgregor-Dennis said, commenting on his ex
perience in the ASSU Executive.
"There are definitely areas where it took us a while
to learn, as I think it does with all executives," Macregor-
Dennis said of his current term with ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2. "I think [Druthi and I] will be able to
start on day one." reservations and student groups.
