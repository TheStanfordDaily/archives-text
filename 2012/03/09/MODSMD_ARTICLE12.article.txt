### 
| Brianna Pang 'l3 and Dan DeLong 'l3 both served
in this year's ASSU Senate, with Pang as chair of the Ap
propriations Committee. Both have extensive experi
ence working with students, in particular financial offi
cers of different student groups..
The pair originally discovered their desire to be in
student government while living in Toyon their sopho
more year. They take partial responsibility for prevent
ing Toyonito, the student performance center located
behind Toyon, from being converted to a package cen
ter for East Campus. By bringing in University adminis
trators, DeLong and Pang say they were able to advo
cate for students' concerns that they would lose a valu
able performance space,
"Through that experience, we realized the ASSU has
a unique platform to affect change, being the intermedi
aries between students and administrators," Pang said.
Both Pang and DeLong stress the ASSU's role as a
facilitator instead of pursuing its own initiatives, the
role of the ASSU Executive is to help student groups,
they said.
"Why don't we give those student groups access to
administrators, the funding, the resources and the tools
that are necessary for those student groups to carry out
their mission?" asked DeLong.
Unlike several other slates, Pang and DeLong are fo
cused on reforming the internal workings of the ASSU.
Referring to complaints about problems with Stanford
Student Enterprises (SSE), the arm of the ASSU that
manages student group banking and student invest
ments on campus, Pang and DeLong said they would
guarantee student reimbursement checks within seven
days.
"It's an internal function of [the] ASSU, but it also af
fects so many students and student groups," Pang said.
The pair also referenced transparency and talked
about their plan to scan and make available to the entire
campus all receipts of the ASSU and student groups.
