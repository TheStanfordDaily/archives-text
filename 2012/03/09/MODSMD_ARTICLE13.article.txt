## Harvard prof Louis Menand tells tale of Great Books 
### NEEL THAKKAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Harvard English professor
Louis Menand declared the era of
Great Books curriculum "over" at
a talk Thursday evening at the
Stanford Humanities Center. He
added, however, that vestiges of
the curriculum still linger, and the
effect it has had on the structure of
American universities has been
profound.
The Great Books are a collec
tion of canonical Western texts, in
cluding authors such as Plato, Aris
totle, Homer and Dante. Stan
ford's Introduction to the Human
ities (IHUM) program is currently
an effort to introduce freshmen to
some of these works while the
Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) program makes them its
focus.

According to Menand, a
Pulitzer prize winner and con
tributing writer to The New Yorker
and The New York Review of
Books, the Great Books idea
the grouping of those books to
gether and elevation of them over
others emerged in the late 19th
century.

"They were intended for peo
ple who didn't have the chance to
go to college," Menand said.
Since then, he said, "the market
for Great Books has moved
around, but there always seems to
be a market someplace."
For most of the 20th century,
that market has been at least part
ly in universities. Menand focused
on the histories of Columbia Uni
versity and the University of
Chicago, which both have Great
Books "core" curricula, as well as
Harvard, his own institution, which

has a more flexible program.
Though Columbia was the first
to institute a version of the Great
Books curriculum, each university
has been through multiple cycles
and renamings since World War I.
"There has never been a golden
age of Great Books curriculum,"
Menand said.

Explaining how the idea of such
a curriculum came about, he point
ed to two factors in early and mid
dle 20th-century America: increas
ing socioeconomic and racial di
versity, as well as a trend of intel
lectual relativism in American
thought.
For example, Menand said,
John Erskine, an English professor
at Columbia who founded the
forerunner to the school's current
Literature Humanities program,
noticed that Columbia students
were increasingly first- or second

generation immigrants.
"He wanted to provide people
of different background with a
common culture," Menand said.
At the University of Chicago,
Robert Maynard Hutchins
president of the university from
1929-1951 —wanted to institute a
four-year Great Books curriculum
based on the ancient system of the
trivium and quadrivium methods
of the Renaissance.
But American academia turned
away from that model.
When Harvard University set
out to change its undergraduate
curriculum in 2007, "one of the
things we discussed was a Great
Books program," Menand said.
"We decided it was a bad idea to
require it of everybody," he added.
In the end, Menand said, "The
Great Books idea was a tolerated
guest in the system of the modern

research university."
Instead of the general, human
ist approach of the Great Books
thinkers, based on the idea that the
classics were accessible to every
one, U.S. universities committed to
specialization.

"The humanities had to make
their way in a world science had
shaped," Menand said.
Minku Kim, a postdoctoral
scholar in the Department of East
Asian Languages and Culture, said
Menand's lecture helped him
think about how he would ap
proach teaching his own students.
"It was a great opportunity to
learn about the historical develop
ment [of the Great Books idea]...
and how it connects to teaching
and learning at Stanford," he said.
