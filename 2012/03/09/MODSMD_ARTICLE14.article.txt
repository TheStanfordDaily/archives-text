## EDITORIAL North Korea's human rights abuses 
### 
On Feb. 29, the U.S. State
Department announced a
deal with North Korea.
The country, under the new lead
ership of Kim Jong Eun, agreed to
suspend its uranium-enrichment
program at its Yongbyon facility,
to halt long-range missile launch
es and to allow limited interna
tional inspection in return for
240,000 metric tons of food aid
from the United States. This deal
was not unprecedented. During
North Korea's famine in the
19905, the United States tried to
use food aid to lure North Korea
to the nuclear bargaining table. As
Georgetown University Profes
sor Andrew Natsios argues, these
efforts have generally been un
successful in diminishing North
Korea's nuclear threat. Similarly,
John Bolton, former U.S. ambas
sador to the United Nations,
pointed to North Korea's contin
ual flouting of commitments it has
made to halt the progression of its
nuclear and missile activities in
exchange for aid.
Yet the media discussion, fo
cusing on the impact or lack
thereof the deal would have
on North Korea's nuclear capabil
ities, shows how critical attention
regarding North Korea is dispro
portionately focused on national
security issues and occludes the
grave human rights abuses under
which the country's citizens suf
fer. The nation is an island state on
multiple fronts: the apartments of
North Korean citizens are outfit
ted with loudspeakers that blast
propaganda from the party-con
trolled station and foreign visitors
allowed to enter the nation are led
on carefully maneuvered tours of
Potemkin prosperity. Our limited
amount of authentic information
either comes from academics
such as our own Professor
Siegfried Hecker who are al
lowed to enter North Korea to ex
amine its nuclear facilities, or de
fectors who often speak under
conditions of anonymity.

nately drowned out. When the
media does cover human rights is
sues in North Korea, the focus is
typically on food shortages.
Unfortunately, North Korean
citizens not only face the threat of
starvation, but around 200,000 are
subject to persecution through
political concentration camps,
where tortures and executions are
common and relatives of prison
ers are also subject to imprison
ment. Furthermore, these human
rights abuses are not perpetrated
by North Korea alone. Citizens
who seek to escape the politically
repressive North Korea byway of
neighboring China are treated as
illegal "economic migrants" by
the Chinese government, making
the refugees subject to arrest and
deportation. China, openly flout
ing its commitment to the United
Nations' 1951 Convention on the
Status of Refugees, refuses to
grant the refugees protection, in
stead allowing them to be repatri
ated to face punishment in North
Korea, including "beatings, tor
ture, detention, forced labor, sex
ual violence, and in the case of
women suspected of becoming
pregnant in China, forced abor
tions or infanticide," according to
Roberta Cohen of the Brookings
Institution.

North Korea has many facets
that make the nation a media
spectacle, ranging from its bur
geoning nuclear capabilities to the
late Kim Jong Il's fondness for
Hennessey cognac. Yet lurking be
hind North Korea's military dan
ger is a torturous system of eco
nomic and political repression
that robs its citizens of dignity and
freedom. This political repression
is at least indirectly aided by
China, whose government pro
vides some of the last significant
economic and political support for
the North Korean regime. We may
never learn to love North Korea's
bomb, but it is important that dis
cussion of the country's military
capabilities does not overshadow
important attention to the status
of its repressed citizens and en
dangered refugees. We owe it to
the North Korean citizens not to
let their humanitarian crisis be
eclipsed by our media's fascina
tion with nuclear issues.

Much of the media attention
seems to focus on the threat of a
nuclear Korea to world security
and, in the midst of this discourse,
discussion of the country's politi
cal, physical, and psychological re
pression of its citizens is unfortu-

On Feb. 29, the U.S. State
Department announced a
deal with North Korea.
The country, under the new lead
ership of Kim Jong Eun, agreed to
suspend its uranium-enrichment
program at its Yongbyon facility,
to halt long-range missile launch
es and to allow limited interna
tional inspection in return for
240,000 metric tons of food aid
from the United States. This deal
was not unprecedented. During
North Korea's famine in the
19905, the United States tried to
use food aid to lure North Korea
to the nuclear bargaining table. As
Georgetown University Profes
sor Andrew Natsios argues, these
efforts have generally been un
successful in diminishing North
Korea's nuclear threat. Similarly,
John Bolton, former U.S. ambas
sador to the United Nations,
pointed to North Korea's contin
ual flouting of commitments it has
made to halt the progression of its
nuclear and missile activities in
exchange for aid.
Yet the media discussion, fo
cusing on the impact or lack
thereof the deal would have
on North Korea's nuclear capabil
ities, shows how critical attention
regarding North Korea is dispro
portionately focused on national
security issues and occludes the
grave human rights abuses under
which the country's citizens suf
fer. The nation is an island state on
multiple fronts: the apartments of
North Korean citizens are outfit
ted with loudspeakers that blast
propaganda from the party-con
trolled station and foreign visitors
allowed to enter the nation are led
on carefully maneuvered tours of
Potemkin prosperity. Our limited
amount of authentic information
either comes from academics
such as our own Professor
Siegfried Hecker who are al
lowed to enter North Korea to ex
amine its nuclear facilities, or de
fectors who often speak under
conditions of anonymity.

nately drowned out. When the
media does cover human rights is
sues in North Korea, the focus is
typically on food shortages.
Unfortunately, North Korean
citizens not only face the threat of
starvation, but around 200,000 are
subject to persecution through
political concentration camps,
where tortures and executions are
common and relatives of prison
ers are also subject to imprison
ment. Furthermore, these human
rights abuses are not perpetrated
by North Korea alone. Citizens
who seek to escape the politically
repressive North Korea byway of
neighboring China are treated as
illegal "economic migrants" by
the Chinese government, making
the refugees subject to arrest and
deportation. China, openly flout
ing its commitment to the United
Nations' 1951 Convention on the
Status of Refugees, refuses to
grant the refugees protection, in
stead allowing them to be repatri
ated to face punishment in North
Korea, including "beatings, tor
ture, detention, forced labor, sex
ual violence, and in the case of
women suspected of becoming
pregnant in China, forced abor
tions or infanticide," according to
