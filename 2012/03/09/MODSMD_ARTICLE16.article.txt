## Breaking the silence 
### Miriam Marks 
Are you an early arriver to
class? Or do you rush in
breathless, five minutes
late? If you're in the former cate
gory, you've probably experienced
the pre-seminar silence.
This is usually how it goes: You
walk into section five-to-seven
minutes early. It's quiet; very
quiet. There are a few students in
the room already, busily clicking
away on their laptops or tinkering
on iPhones. You pick a seat, not
too near the other people but not
necessarily too far away. You wait
a moment or two and then follow
suit by pulling out your own dis
traction. More students slowly fil
ter into class. There's still no con
versation. Eventually a professor
or TA rushes in, the clock strikes
the appointed minute and class
commences.
These first five minutes of si

lence before a class or a meet
ing, or a seminar, or whatever it is
can drag on forever. Such a si
lence is strange to me. Everyone is
in the room together; everyone
will soon hear the same lecture
and everyone may even engage in
a lively debate with one another.
But some powerful force holds
back any form of preliminary
chatter.

Sadly, few try to break the
metaphorical ice of silence. And
with each new person who walks
in the door, the ice becomes thick
er. If you walk into a room full of
silent people, will you start mak
ing conversation? Probably not.
Let someone else talk, if they
want. It's not your responsibility.
But even if you did want to
strike up a conversation, where
would you begin? Often you're in
a room with a bunch of people you

barely know. Sitting in this room of
strangers, your only commonality
is the homework for the class. This
makes conversation very difficult
to start. What would you even say?
"Hey, what'd you think of read
ing for this week? I totally love
democratic peace theory!"
No. Did you seriously expect to
bond with the person next to you
over the reading? It won't happen.
Even if the person also liked the
reading, no one wants to be labeled
as that kid you know, the kid
who actually does all the reading.
So you decide to try the oppo
site approach.
