## Breaking the silence 
### Miriam Marks 
Are you an early arriver to
class? Or do you rush in
breathless, five minutes
late? If you're in the former cate
gory, you've probably experienced
the pre-seminar silence.
This is usually how it goes: You
walk into section five-to-seven
minutes early. It's quiet; very
quiet. There are a few students in
the room already, busily clicking
away on their laptops or tinkering
on iPhones. You pick a seat, not
too near the other people but not
necessarily too far away. You wait
a moment or two and then follow
suit by pulling out your own dis
traction. More students slowly fil
ter into class. There's still no con
versation. Eventually a professor
or TA rushes in, the clock strikes
the appointed minute and class
commences.
These first five minutes of si

lence before a class or a meet
ing, or a seminar, or whatever it is
can drag on forever. Such a si
lence is strange to me. Everyone is
in the room together; everyone
will soon hear the same lecture
and everyone may even engage in
a lively debate with one another.
But some powerful force holds
back any form of preliminary
chatter.

Sadly, few try to break the
metaphorical ice of silence. And
with each new person who walks
in the door, the ice becomes thick
er. If you walk into a room full of
silent people, will you start mak
ing conversation? Probably not.
Let someone else talk, if they
want. It's not your responsibility.
But even if you did want to
strike up a conversation, where
would you begin? Often you're in
a room with a bunch of people you

barely know. Sitting in this room of
strangers, your only commonality
is the homework for the class. This
makes conversation very difficult
to start. What would you even say?
"Hey, what'd you think of read
ing for this week? I totally love
democratic peace theory!"
No. Did you seriously expect to
bond with the person next to you
over the reading? It won't happen.
Even if the person also liked the
reading, no one wants to be labeled
as that kid you know, the kid
who actually does all the reading.
So you decide to try the oppo
site approach.

"Dude, the reading for this
week was so boring. Can you be
lieve people actually study this
crap?"

Also no. First of all, you might
offend someone who secretly
loved the reading. But more im
portantly you risk the possibility
that the professor will walk in pre
cisely as you make your pro
nouncement. No amount of office
hours would save this blunder.

But wait, you say, what is this
pressure to make conversation
before section? Sometimes
you're using your computer be
fore class for an urgent and press
ing need: You allotted those five
minutes to send 14 emails, com
pose three "happy birthday" mes
sages on Facebook and order a

new pair of pants. You don't have
time to talk to the people sitting
next to you you're busy and
important! And those five min
utes of idle chatter aren't in your
Google Calendar, so they're not
an option.

The thing is, not everyone is
that busy. Last week I arrived at a
seminar class on the early side;
there were three people in the
room, and everyone was sitting in
silence, glued to a laptop screen. I
was disappointed that no one felt
the need to talk to anybody else,
and so my eyes naturally wan
dered to the laptop screen of the
girl next to me.
She was rapidly scrolling back
and forth over her Facebook
newsfeed. No typing, no compos
ing, no scrutinizing of content. Did
she just want to avoid conversa
tion by seeming busy?
I don't know. And I certainly
can't generalize from her behav
ior. What I can say is that a few

minutes of friendly conversation is
worth the investment, and some
times it just takes one bit of dia
logue to break the ice in the room.
I redirected my attention away
from Facebook-idling girl and
looked at someone else across the
room. He was eating a burrito
while trying to type something on
his computer.
"Hey, what kind of burrito is
that?" I ventured.

Everyone looked up from their
computers. Did someone just say
something? The burrito-eating
guy looked a little surprised but fi
nally told me: chicken.Ten seconds
later he was asking me about
something else related to the class.
Soon we were engaged in full
fledged conversation. The silence
was overcome, and all it took was
one first move.

time to talk to the people sitting
next to you you're busy and
important! And those five min
utes of idle chatter aren't in your
Google Calendar, so they're not
an option.

The thing is, not everyone is
that busy. Last week I arrived at a
seminar class on the early side;
there were three people in the
room, and everyone was sitting in
silence, glued to a laptop screen. I
was disappointed that no one felt
the need to talk to anybody else,
and so my eyes naturally wan
dered to the laptop screen of the
girl next to me.
She was rapidly scrolling back
and forth over her Facebook
newsfeed. No typing, no compos
ing, no scrutinizing of content. Did
she just want to avoid conversa
tion by seeming busy?
I don't know. And I certainly
can't generalize from her behav
ior. What I can say is that a few

minutes of friendly conversation is
worth the investment, and some
times it just takes one bit of dia
logue to break the ice in the room.
I redirected my attention away
from Facebook-idling girl and
looked at someone else across the
room. He was eating a burrito
while trying to type something on
his computer.
"Hey, what kind of burrito is
that?" I ventured.

Everyone looked up from their
computers. Did someone just say
something? The burrito-eating
guy looked a little surprised but fi
nally told me: chicken.Ten seconds
later he was asking me about
something else related to the class.
Soon we were engaged in full
fledged conversation. The silence
was overcome, and all it took was
one first move.

Are you an early arriver to
class? Or do you rush in
breathless, five minutes
late? If you're in the former cate
gory, you've probably experienced
the pre-seminar silence.
This is usually how it goes: You
walk into section five-to-seven
minutes early. It's quiet; very
quiet. There are a few students in
the room already, busily clicking
away on their laptops or tinkering
on iPhones. You pick a seat, not
too near the other people but not
necessarily too far away. You wait
a moment or two and then follow
suit by pulling out your own dis
traction. More students slowly fil
ter into class. There's still no con
versation. Eventually a professor
or TA rushes in, the clock strikes
the appointed minute and class
commences.
These first five minutes of si

lence before a class or a meet
ing, or a seminar, or whatever it is
can drag on forever. Such a si
lence is strange to me. Everyone is
in the room together; everyone
will soon hear the same lecture
and everyone may even engage in
a lively debate with one another.
But some powerful force holds
back any form of preliminary
chatter.

Sadly, few try to break the
metaphorical ice of silence. And
with each new person who walks
in the door, the ice becomes thick
er. If you walk into a room full of
silent people, will you start mak
ing conversation? Probably not.
Let someone else talk, if they
want. It's not your responsibility.
But even if you did want to
strike up a conversation, where
would you begin? Often you're in
a room with a bunch of people you

barely know. Sitting in this room of
strangers, your only commonality
is the homework for the class. This
makes conversation very difficult
to start. What would you even say?
"Hey, what'd you think of read
ing for this week? I totally love
democratic peace theory!"
No. Did you seriously expect to
bond with the person next to you
over the reading? It won't happen.
Even if the person also liked the
reading, no one wants to be labeled
as that kid you know, the kid
who actually does all the reading.
So you decide to try the oppo
site approach.

"Dude, the reading for this
week was so boring. Can you be
lieve people actually study this
crap?"

Also no. First of all, you might
offend someone who secretly
loved the reading. But more im
portantly you risk the possibility
that the professor will walk in pre
cisely as you make your pro
nouncement. No amount of office
hours would save this blunder.

But wait, you say, what is this
pressure to make conversation
before section? Sometimes
you're using your computer be
fore class for an urgent and press
ing need: You allotted those five
minutes to send 14 emails, com
