# EXISTENTIAL FORTUNE COOKIES
## State funded paradise 
### Sebastain Gould 
The other day I was consider
ing what Stanford could do
to help incoming freshmen.
My own academic transition to
Stanford came much easier than it
would have if I hadn't gotten the
education that I did get. The
preparation that I am talking
about was my high school in
downtown Oklahoma City, the
Oklahoma School of Science and
Mathematics. The acronym
OSSM is pronounced "awesome,"
and can readily be punned. OSSM
fact: About 70 percent of the fac
ulty hold doctorates. The high
school is best described though as
"thirty-two acres of state-funded
paradise."
What made the rigorous two
year state-funded public boarding
school paradise was the commit
ment to the academic success of
the students lucky enough and
smart enough to be admitted to
the school. At OSSM, there was a
very straightforward list of classes
that every student had to take,
with little-to-no room for elec
tives. If one did have room for
electives, the only options were
more science and mathematics, or
an internship if you had the time.
You could only go out on the
weekend in the school vans that
would take you to Wal-Mart, the

mall or the downtown area. You
weren't allowed to have cell
phones, there was mandatory
study time for several hours every
night and after 11 p.m. the lights
shut off and you had to go to bed.
So why do I still insist that this
seeming prison was paradise?
While at OSSM, I had no obli
gations to my family or the world.
My only purpose in life was to
learn. Without going there I
would not have been able to get
into Stanford, nor would I possess
the conviction that I have now
that I should pursue knowledge
simply for the sake of it, without
worrying about the economic re
turns.
My financial transition to Stan
ford came much harder than the
academic one. Without any eco
nomic training whatsoever, Stan
ford threw me into class and said
"good luck." My summer before
Stanford did not allow me to save
the money that they expected me
to have for books, and so I had to
ask for a loan from a professor at
OSSM and get a credit card. Jobs
that undeclared, inexperienced
freshmen could qualify for were
really hard to find at Stanford too,
and it took me several months to
get one. Once I did find employ
ment, it was hard to keep up with

my credit card because I was al
ways skipping lunch to work
more.

This all matters because we
were taught at OSSM that being a
student is a full-time job. We were
not students Monday through Fri
day, or Monday through Thursday
as it is at Stanford; we were stu
dents always. That is why they for
bid us from working; the only way
you can work and still not do
poorly in your courses is if the ac
ademic program isn't rigorous
enough or if you are deliberately
taking classes that are below your
level. I understand that having to
work and learn at the same time
teaches you life skills and encour
ages maturity. I learned that be
cause I started working when I
was 15; poverty taught me the im
portance of money. What I can't
understand is why Stanford ex
pects students to earn money to
contribute to their academics.
The logic I've heard uses desire
to overcome difficulty as justifica
tion for this. If students really
want to learn, then they should be
willing to work for it. No argu

ment there I completely agree
that one should ensure that stu
dents actually care about their ed
ucation. What 1 can't understand
is how forcing someone to work
when they go to school proves
that they actually value educa
tion. Are they worried that stu
dents who don't work will be
lazy? Then simply put strict re
quirements on those students'
performances. Stanford expects
students with a full ride to save
around $3,000 from their summer
earnings to use during the school
year for expenses. If you get sum
mer federal work-study money to
help a professor do research at
Stanford, the maximum amount
you can earn is around $5,500.
That means you have to live for

over three months on $2,500. For
students who can't go home to
live with their families, or don't
have families to go home to, that
amount is a paltry figure when
you look at how much rent and
living expenses are in the Bay
Area.

I loved my experience at
OSSM because all I was asked to
do was learn for the sake of learn
ing. At least from the way finan
cial aid is structured, it doesn't
seem that Stanford holds that
same belief. If Stanford wants to
help incoming freshmen transi
tion, perhaps it could help them
transition financially, at least dur
ing their first quarter, by provid
ing a book stipend and offering a
class on how to manage their
money in the future.
