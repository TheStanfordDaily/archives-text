## Perceptions of higher education 
### 
The etymology of "universi
ty" is "institution of higher
learning." University does
not mean "institution of higher
profit." Unfortunately, this latter
meaning is an apt description of
some practices at universities, in
cluding Stanford. For instance, the
University sells corporations ac
cess to students based on how
much money a corporation is will
ing to pay the University. The Ca
reer Development Center's Em
ployer Partner program explicitly
states on the CDC website that
"Platinum" level employers (cor
porations that pay $lO,OOO per
year to $25,000 for three years) re
ceive unlimited email distribution,
premier double table location for
Fall and Spring Career Fairs in
White Plaza, up to twenty Cardi
nal Recruiting interview rooms
per day, a campus-wide flyer distri
bution team and much more. This
contrasts with the crumbs non
profits receive, which are allotted
just one email distribution per ac
ademic year, participation in
workshops and career events, and
a table at the Silicon Valley Non
profit Career fair in the upstairs of
Tresidder.

As a result, rich corporations
like oil companies, financial insti
tutions, consulting firms and tech
companies enjoy tremendous ad
vantage over employers with
smaller pockets. If you've ever
used the CDC's job database as a
student or alumnus, you'll notice
the jobs listed mostly come from
the four mentioned industries. Stu
dents who don't want to work for
those companies receive little as
sistance from the career center in
finding alternatives. The CDC's
duty, however, is to serve the stu
dents, not leverage them for profit.
The CDC's role raises deep
questions about the University it
self. The perception that the sole
purpose of higher education is to
train students to acquire a lucra
tive job is prevalent. This serves
the University's coffers well be
cause alumni with lucrative ca
reers pay back the University with
larger donations, but the real pur
pose of institutions of higher
learning is to expand and strength
en students' minds and intellectual
prowess. It doesn't matter that
Stanford is a private university; it
doesn't excuse the University's
(subtle) attempt to funnel its stu
dents into a narrow career pool on
a monetary basis.
Students are not blameless for
fostering this false perception of
higher education. As students, we
need to evaluate if the wealth we
gain by taking a job with Goldman
Sachs outweighs the substantial
social harm this company inflicts
upon innocent third parties. For
example, Goldman Sachs created
an oil speculation bubble in 2008
that caused food prices to soar,
forcing 100 million people into
starvation. We need to ask our
selves if the only purpose of our
education is to make an unneces
sary amount of money at the ex
pense of others. We live in a cul
ture that sets profit maximization
as the most important goal. We ig
nore who is harmed in the process.
Profit maximization through the
exploitation of others is not natu
ral, ethical or rational. Humans
are social beings and depend on
one another. There are other cul
tures and societies that equate
collective well-being with that of
the individual. We need to liberate
ourselves from the false percep
tion that our higher education is
for the sole purpose of acquiring a

lucrative job. Once we develop an
understanding of happiness that is
derived from more than just mate
rial wealth, it can open up a
plethora of opportunities.
Some argue that if Stanford,
Harvard, or Princeton students
work for Goldman Sachs, then
they can create change from the
inside and introduce reforms.
However, those who manage and
work for such companies have al
ways come from these elite uni
versities in the first place. The
highly educated workforce has
not prevented these companies
from profiting at the expense of
others. On the contrary, many
from these elite universities are
responsible for bringing devasta
tion upon our society and world.
Because someone was a student
at an elite university doesn't mean
he or she has a higher moral com
pass than the rest of society; it only
means the person is talented and
can work hard for whatever goal
set by the corporation.
As students, we need to chal
lenge our school to not sell us to
the highest bidder and to act more
like a university should, rather
than a corporation. We also need
to challenge ourselves and each
other to think what effect the jobs
and career paths we pursue will
have on other people and society
as a whole.
