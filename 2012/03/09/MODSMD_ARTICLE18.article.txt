## Perceptions of higher education 
### 
The etymology of "universi
ty" is "institution of higher
learning." University does
not mean "institution of higher
profit." Unfortunately, this latter
meaning is an apt description of
some practices at universities, in
cluding Stanford. For instance, the
University sells corporations ac
cess to students based on how
much money a corporation is will
ing to pay the University. The Ca
reer Development Center's Em
ployer Partner program explicitly
states on the CDC website that
"Platinum" level employers (cor
porations that pay $lO,OOO per
year to $25,000 for three years) re
ceive unlimited email distribution,
premier double table location for
Fall and Spring Career Fairs in
White Plaza, up to twenty Cardi
nal Recruiting interview rooms
per day, a campus-wide flyer distri
bution team and much more. This
contrasts with the crumbs non
profits receive, which are allotted
just one email distribution per ac
ademic year, participation in
workshops and career events, and
a table at the Silicon Valley Non
profit Career fair in the upstairs of
Tresidder.

As a result, rich corporations
like oil companies, financial insti
tutions, consulting firms and tech
companies enjoy tremendous ad
vantage over employers with
smaller pockets. If you've ever
used the CDC's job database as a
student or alumnus, you'll notice
the jobs listed mostly come from
the four mentioned industries. Stu
dents who don't want to work for
those companies receive little as
sistance from the career center in
finding alternatives. The CDC's
duty, however, is to serve the stu
dents, not leverage them for profit.
The CDC's role raises deep
questions about the University it
self. The perception that the sole
purpose of higher education is to
train students to acquire a lucra
tive job is prevalent. This serves
the University's coffers well be
cause alumni with lucrative ca
reers pay back the University with
larger donations, but the real pur
pose of institutions of higher
learning is to expand and strength
en students' minds and intellectual
prowess. It doesn't matter that
Stanford is a private university; it
