## READY FOR RICE OWLS FLOCK TO THE FARM 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 4 Rice baseball team
has yet to play a single game out
side the state of Texas, but the
Owls will be in for their toughest
test of the season this weekend.
In their first excursion from the
Lone Star State, they will meet
the No. 2 Cardinal at Sunken Di
amond for a three-game series.
And though Stanford (11-1)
has already swept a pair of oppo
nents that were ranked in the top
15 when they made their trips to
the Farm (and have since
dropped in the standings consid
erably), Rice seems like the real
deal through 14 games this sea
son, going 12-2 and winning all
nine of its home contests.
This will be the Cardinal's last
chance to work out any kinks be
fore its conference season kicks
off against No. 29 USC and No. 11
Arizona on back-to-back week
ends. It's hard to find much to nit
pick so far, though, as the squad
ranks fourth in the nation in runs
scored and has two starters
amongst the top 15 strikeout men
in the country, lefthander Brett
Mooneyham (28 strikeouts) and
righthander Mark Appel (26).
A week ago on Friday, Stan
ford fell for the first time this sea
son to unranked Fresno State (5-
7), and if the Owls are going to
leave Sunken Diamond with a se
ries win, they're going to have to
use the Bulldogs' 7-4 win as a
model of how to dismantle the
dominant Cardinal.
Fresno State's seven runs are
notable in and of themselves
Stanford has only allowed more
than five on two occasions this

season yet the fact that they
all came off projected No. 1 pick
Appel is even more striking.
Appel's outing wasn't all bad, as
he struck out 11 in eight innings
and gave up just one hit per
frame, but the difference in the
game was the Bulldogs' four-run
sixth inning, a rare crooked num
ber in the box score for a Stan
ford team that allows a run just
once per three frames. Rice will
have to duplicate the break
through offense it came up with
in its 11-1 win over Tennessee on
Sunday if it wants any chance of
shaking the Cardinal's solid

pitching staff.
Another key for the Owls will
be shutting down the heart of the
Stanford lineup just like Fresno
State did a week ago, when the
Cardinal's 5-6-7-8 batters had no
hits, struck out five combined
times and reached base only once
on a walk to junior catcher Eric
Smith.The four men in those slots
last Friday junior second base
man Kenny Diekroeger, junior
designated hitter Christian Grif
fiths, sophomore shortstop Lon
nie Kauppila and Smith have
accounted for 38 RBI and 52 hits
this season. In Stanford's 16-0

bounce-back win on Saturday,
the group knocked in six runs and
reached base seven times.
Rice's starters are more than
capable of giving their opponents
trouble, as this weekend's likely
rotation of senior Matthew
Reckling, sophomore Austin Ku
bitza and freshman Jordan
Stephens have yet to drop a deci
sion this season. Reckling
whose grandfather's name is on
the Owls' stadium has allowed
just 10 hits in 22 innings pitched
en route to an 0.82 ERA this sea

No. 4 Rice, as the No. 2 Cardinal baseball team tries to continue its strong start this weekend at home.
son, including a stellar perform
ance in Rice's 2-0 win over Dal
las Baptist two weeks ago in
which he gave up just two hits in
8.1 innings.
Senior Michael Fuda, batting
in the three-hole, paces the Owls
at the plate. After missing a
month of his 2011 season with a
hamstring injury and hitting just
.255, the centerfielder now leads
the squad with a .424 average
and 11 RBI, not to mention six
doubles.
Rice is also by far the best de
fensive team Stanford will have
faced this season, and the only
squad on the Cardinal's schedule
so far that has a better fielding
percentage, .977 to Stanford's
.971, putting the Owls in the top
30 nationally. By contrast, Texas
sits at 185 th and Vanderbilt at
257 th with respective .958 and
.943 percentages.
Accordingly, the Cardinal
can't expect to get many of the er
rors it took advantage of in its
early series. The squad will need a
lift from junior third baseman
Stephen Piscotty, and though the
preseason All-American's 21
RBI are still a team-best, his pace
has slowed a bit after a monstrous
11-RBI first week of the season.
Stanford will once again try to
lean on the top-to-bottom offen
sive consistency, as all but two
starting batters are hitting .300 or
better and six have driven in
more than 10 runs. The Owls can't
boast quite the same hitting
prowess, with five spots in the
lineup hitting .267 or worse so far.
Both of these offenses tend to
fade in the final innings in part
because of late pinch-hitters who
swing for the fences but often
strike out with each team
scoring 43 percent of its runs in
the first three frames. Interesting
ly enough, however. Rice is a per
fect 3-0 when its opponents score
in the first inning, a feat accom
plished eight times by the Cardi
nal, which has yet to lose in that
situation.

Tonight's game begins at 5:30
p.m. before a 1 p.m. Saturday
start and Sunday's finale at noon.
