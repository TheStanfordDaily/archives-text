## READY FOR RICE OWLS FLOCK TO THE FARM 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 4 Rice baseball team
has yet to play a single game out
side the state of Texas, but the
Owls will be in for their toughest
test of the season this weekend.
In their first excursion from the
Lone Star State, they will meet
the No. 2 Cardinal at Sunken Di
amond for a three-game series.
And though Stanford (11-1)
has already swept a pair of oppo
nents that were ranked in the top
15 when they made their trips to
the Farm (and have since
dropped in the standings consid
erably), Rice seems like the real
deal through 14 games this sea
son, going 12-2 and winning all
nine of its home contests.
This will be the Cardinal's last
chance to work out any kinks be
fore its conference season kicks
off against No. 29 USC and No. 11
Arizona on back-to-back week
ends. It's hard to find much to nit
pick so far, though, as the squad
ranks fourth in the nation in runs
scored and has two starters
amongst the top 15 strikeout men
in the country, lefthander Brett
Mooneyham (28 strikeouts) and
righthander Mark Appel (26).
A week ago on Friday, Stan
ford fell for the first time this sea
son to unranked Fresno State (5-
7), and if the Owls are going to
leave Sunken Diamond with a se
ries win, they're going to have to
use the Bulldogs' 7-4 win as a
model of how to dismantle the
dominant Cardinal.
Fresno State's seven runs are
notable in and of themselves
Stanford has only allowed more
than five on two occasions this

season yet the fact that they
all came off projected No. 1 pick
Appel is even more striking.
Appel's outing wasn't all bad, as
he struck out 11 in eight innings
and gave up just one hit per
frame, but the difference in the
game was the Bulldogs' four-run
sixth inning, a rare crooked num
ber in the box score for a Stan
ford team that allows a run just
once per three frames. Rice will
have to duplicate the break
through offense it came up with
in its 11-1 win over Tennessee on
Sunday if it wants any chance of
shaking the Cardinal's solid

pitching staff.
Another key for the Owls will
be shutting down the heart of the
Stanford lineup just like Fresno
State did a week ago, when the
Cardinal's 5-6-7-8 batters had no
hits, struck out five combined
times and reached base only once
on a walk to junior catcher Eric
Smith.The four men in those slots
last Friday junior second base
man Kenny Diekroeger, junior
designated hitter Christian Grif
fiths, sophomore shortstop Lon
nie Kauppila and Smith have
accounted for 38 RBI and 52 hits
this season. In Stanford's 16-0

bounce-back win on Saturday,
the group knocked in six runs and
reached base seven times.
Rice's starters are more than
capable of giving their opponents
trouble, as this weekend's likely
rotation of senior Matthew
Reckling, sophomore Austin Ku
bitza and freshman Jordan
Stephens have yet to drop a deci
sion this season. Reckling
whose grandfather's name is on
the Owls' stadium has allowed
just 10 hits in 22 innings pitched
en route to an 0.82 ERA this sea
