# Farewell to IHUM
## 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Concluding a multi-year review of the
methods and goals of a Stanford education,
the Faculty Senate voted Thursday in favor
of replacing the current Introduction to Hu
manities (IHUM) program. Freshmen will
instead be required to take a one-quarter
"Thinking Matters" course starting this up
coming academic year.
The Senate will reconsider a recommen
dation to require freshmen seminars in the

2015-16 academic year.
Earlier in the meeting, the Senate also
voted on two revisions to the University's
policies governing faculty conflicts of inter
est and outside consulting, which were
prompted by new federal regulations. These
measures, which had been discussed at the
Senate's Feb. 23 meeting, were unanimously
approved without floor discussion.
C-USP recommendations
The Senate reviewed a report by the
Committee on Undergraduate Standards

and Policy (C-USP) for a second time. C
USP issued the report in response to pro
posed changes to the freshman academic ex
perience made in the Study of Undergradu
ate Education at Stanford (SUES) report.

discussion by highlighting the most signifi
cant aspects of Thinking Matters, noting that

spread across the University.
Goldstein added that freshmen
will be able to choose Thinking
Matters courses in away similar to
normal lecture classes, rather than
being bound to a particular class
or quarter.

Goldstein also emphasized the
reduced time commitments sug
gested by the C-USP report, which
recommended requiring freshman
to enroll in two courses one
Thinking Matters course and one
freshman seminar instead of
the current three-quarter IHUM
sequence. Freshmen would still
take a Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) class as a require
ment.

Senate Chair Rosemary
Knight, professor of geophysics, re
minded the Senate of concerns
about the freshman seminar re
quirement expressed in the Sen
ate's previous meeting.
Senators had expressed skepti
cism that the University would be
able to preserve the character of
seminars if they were made
mandatory citing issues with
scheduling, inadequate seminar
numbers and student and faculty
enthusiasm.

Amending requirements
Acknowledging Knight's con
cerns, Russell Berman, director
of the IHUM and Introductory
Seminar programs, put an
amended version of C-USP's
recommendations before the
Senate for its consideration.

While the amendment pre
served the role of Thinking Mat
ters as a requirement, it removed
the freshman seminar require
ment. Instead, Berman proposed
that the Vice Provost of Under
graduate Education work to ex
pand seminar availability and en
courage student participation in
seminars. The Senate would re
consider the requirement of
freshmen seminars in the 2015-

16 academic year.
"I'm making these amend
ments in the spirit of endorsing the
SUES report," Berman said.
Maintaining that increased semi
nar participation remains a princi
pal objective, Berman emphasized
that he wants to make sure that
available seminars offer sufficient
breadth and depth before any such
requirement is implemented.
"We're asking for several
years in which we can pursue this
strategy aggressively," Berman
said. "It could be the case that
there are good reasons for stu
dents not to do it... Let's leave
open the possibility that some stu
dents are making wise choices."
Faculty discussion of the
amendment focused on the ade
quacy of requiring only one
course alongside PWR, citing
IHUM as providing a common
experience for all Stanford fresh
man that might not be adequately
replaced.

Dissenting opinions
Carolyn Lougee Chappell,
professor of history, argued that a
freshman requirement should
aim to bridge the gap for students
between high school and univer
sity education.
"IHUM, in the course of a
year, builds the skills that students
will need for their whole universi
ty education," Lougee Chappell
said. "I'm skeptical that one quar
ter is sufficient."

Berman acknowledged that
any freshman requirement should
ease the transition to university
classes, but said that he'd encoun
tered a majority of faculty that felt
three quarters was excessive. He
also expressed doubt that an ex
tended freshman requirement
would resonate academically with
students.

"I don't think the way to solve
the learning issues is by compelling
students into courses they would
n't take otherwise," Berman said.
Noting the continued growth in
the number of units demanded by
majors, Chris Edwards, professor
of mechanical engineering, empha
sized the significance of ensuring

that reduced requirements trans
lates into greater freedom for
freshmen to explore, rather than
allowing departments to stipulate
course requirements earlier in stu
dents' academics careers.

Jeremy Weinstein, professor of
political science, also spoke out
against the amendment. Contrast
ing the amendment's "wait-and
see" attitude toward seminars with
the original recommendation's
mandate for requiring it, he ex
pressed doubt that faculty would
engage with the initiative at the
level required.
"The amendment is set up to
fail, as departments don't have a
strong incentive to offer more
courses," Weinstein said.
"Just at the start"
Vice Provost of Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam noted that
his office, department chairs and
the Office of the Provost will com
mence a discussion next week con
cerning compensation for faculty
participation in seminars. Elam
said that thirty more seminars
would be required to accommo
date the entirety of the freshman
class.
"I actually think we can [accom
modate the added seminars]," said
Provost and Acting President John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2. "I don't
think it's a forgone conclusion that
it'll be hard to do."
Expressing concern that requir
ing freshman seminars might result
in Thinking Matters becoming a
"dumping ground" for students un
able to find a seminar of interest,
James Campbell, co-chair of the
SUES committee, endorsed the
amendment.
"We're just at the start of a real
ly long conversation," Campbell
said. "I hope people will remember
that as we implement a whole series
of innovations."
The Senate voted by a margin of
27 to eight votes to accept
Berman's amendments, and by 27
to six votes with two abstentions
in favor of the amended motion.

dents' academics careers.

Jeremy Weinstein, professor of
political science, also spoke out
against the amendment. Contrast
ing the amendment's "wait-and
see" attitude toward seminars with
the original recommendation's
mandate for requiring it, he ex
pressed doubt that faculty would
engage with the initiative at the
level required.
"The amendment is set up to
fail, as departments don't have a
strong incentive to offer more
courses," Weinstein said.
"Just at the start"
Vice Provost of Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam noted that
his office, department chairs and
the Office of the Provost will com
mence a discussion next week con
cerning compensation for faculty
participation in seminars. Elam
said that thirty more seminars
would be required to accommo
date the entirety of the freshman
class.
"I actually think we can [accom
modate the added seminars]," said
Provost and Acting President John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2. "I don't
think it's a forgone conclusion that
it'll be hard to do."
Expressing concern that requir
ing freshman seminars might result
in Thinking Matters becoming a
"dumping ground" for students un
able to find a seminar of interest,
James Campbell, co-chair of the
SUES committee, endorsed the
amendment.
"We're just at the start of a real
ly long conversation," Campbell
said. "I hope people will remember
that as we implement a whole series
of innovations."
The Senate voted by a margin of
27 to eight votes to accept
Berman's amendments, and by 27
to six votes with two abstentions
in favor of the amended motion.

Concluding a multi-year review of the
methods and goals of a Stanford education,
the Faculty Senate voted Thursday in favor
of replacing the current Introduction to Hu
manities (IHUM) program. Freshmen will
instead be required to take a one-quarter
"Thinking Matters" course starting this up
coming academic year.
The Senate will reconsider a recommen
dation to require freshmen seminars in the

2015-16 academic year.
Earlier in the meeting, the Senate also
voted on two revisions to the University's
policies governing faculty conflicts of inter
est and outside consulting, which were
prompted by new federal regulations. These
measures, which had been discussed at the
Senate's Feb. 23 meeting, were unanimously
approved without floor discussion.

spread across the University.
Goldstein added that freshmen
will be able to choose Thinking
Matters courses in away similar to
normal lecture classes, rather than
being bound to a particular class
or quarter.

Goldstein also emphasized the
reduced time commitments sug
gested by the C-USP report, which
recommended requiring freshman
to enroll in two courses one
Thinking Matters course and one
freshman seminar instead of
the current three-quarter IHUM
sequence. Freshmen would still
take a Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) class as a require
ment.

Senate Chair Rosemary
Knight, professor of geophysics, re
minded the Senate of concerns
about the freshman seminar re
quirement expressed in the Sen
ate's previous meeting.
Senators had expressed skepti
cism that the University would be
able to preserve the character of
seminars if they were made
mandatory citing issues with
scheduling, inadequate seminar
numbers and student and faculty
enthusiasm.

Amending requirements
Acknowledging Knight's con
cerns, Russell Berman, director
of the IHUM and Introductory
Seminar programs, put an
amended version of C-USP's
recommendations before the
Senate for its consideration.

While the amendment pre
served the role of Thinking Mat
ters as a requirement, it removed
the freshman seminar require
ment. Instead, Berman proposed
that the Vice Provost of Under
graduate Education work to ex
pand seminar availability and en
courage student participation in
seminars. The Senate would re
consider the requirement of
freshmen seminars in the 2015-

16 academic year.
"I'm making these amend
ments in the spirit of endorsing the
SUES report," Berman said.
Maintaining that increased semi
nar participation remains a princi
pal objective, Berman emphasized
that he wants to make sure that
available seminars offer sufficient
breadth and depth before any such
requirement is implemented.
"We're asking for several
years in which we can pursue this
strategy aggressively," Berman
said. "It could be the case that
there are good reasons for stu
dents not to do it... Let's leave
open the possibility that some stu
dents are making wise choices."
Faculty discussion of the
amendment focused on the ade
quacy of requiring only one
course alongside PWR, citing
IHUM as providing a common
experience for all Stanford fresh
man that might not be adequately
replaced.

Dissenting opinions
Carolyn Lougee Chappell,
professor of history, argued that a
freshman requirement should
aim to bridge the gap for students
between high school and univer
sity education.
"IHUM, in the course of a
year, builds the skills that students
will need for their whole universi
ty education," Lougee Chappell
said. "I'm skeptical that one quar
ter is sufficient."

Berman acknowledged that
any freshman requirement should
ease the transition to university
classes, but said that he'd encoun
tered a majority of faculty that felt
three quarters was excessive. He
also expressed doubt that an ex
tended freshman requirement
would resonate academically with
students.

"I don't think the way to solve
the learning issues is by compelling
students into courses they would
n't take otherwise," Berman said.
Noting the continued growth in
the number of units demanded by
majors, Chris Edwards, professor
of mechanical engineering, empha
sized the significance of ensuring

that reduced requirements trans
lates into greater freedom for
freshmen to explore, rather than
allowing departments to stipulate
course requirements earlier in stu
dents' academics careers.

Jeremy Weinstein, professor of
political science, also spoke out
against the amendment. Contrast
