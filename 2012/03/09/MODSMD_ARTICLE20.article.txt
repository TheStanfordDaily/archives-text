## Card whisks past the Huskies 
### DEAN MCARDLE STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball team
took the first step on the road to a Pac-12 con
ference tournament championship last night,
defeating Washington 76-57.
Senior All-American Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike led the Cardinal with 18 points, while her
younger sister Chiney added 16 points and 11
rebounds. The Ogwumikes were joined in dou
ble figures by freshman Bonnie Samuelson,
who nailed a trio of three-pointers and tallied
11 points.

Stanford (29-1, 18-0 Pac-12) entered the
game as the Pac-12 regular season champion
and winner of eight of nine conference tourna
ments since the Pac-10 started the postseason
tournament in 2002. However, the Huskies
certainly did not lie down.
"Washington came out and played really
hard. They gave us a challenge inside with

Regina Rogers," said Stanford coach TaraVan-
Derveer. "I thought it was a very good first
game. But we have some things to work on for
next game,"
Washington played particularly rigorous in
terior defense, forcing the Ogwumikes off the
block, where they usually dominate.
"Scoring on the block today wasn't as easy
as it usually was, so we tried to expand the post
game by going out and cutting to the basket
and looking for each other high-low," Nneka
Ogwumike said. "I think it prepares us for the

games that are coming up. It's not
going to be handed to us from here
on out."

While the Washington defense
kept the game close, the Stanford
defense kept the team ahead. The
Huskies shot just 31 percent from
the floor, and were limited to
seven assists as a team.

Experienced upperclassmen
led the Washington attack. Red
shirt senior Regina Rodgers paced
the Huskies with 13 points. Red
shirt senior Mackenzie Argens
and senior Mollie Williams also
contributed 12 points apiece.
The 6-foot-3 Rodgers also
stymied Nneka's inside game and
forced the Player of the Year can

didate to take more outside shots.

"It's always good to [play] a
good post because it's a challenge,
both defensively and offensively,"
said Nneka.

Stanford fans collectively held
their breath during a scary mo
ment when Rodgers smashed an
elbow into the face of Nneka while
going up for a shot. The senior
reeled away with blood streaming
from both nostrils, but shook it off
and continued to score at a torrid
pace.

"When she went up for that
basket my face was just where her
elbow was," Nneka said. "I don't
think she tried to flagrantly foul
me or anything, she just made her
move."
Washington won the tip and a
quick three-pointer by Jazmine
Davis gave them an early lead in a
back-and-forth first half. Minutes
later, with the scoreboard reading

the 12 to 11 Stanford, Nneka and
sophomore guard Toni Kokenis
orchestrated an eight-point run
that stretched the Cardinal advan
tage.

Stanford held the lead through
the remainder of the half and went
into the locker room up 37-24.
Early in the second half, the two
teams traded baskets until the
Cardinal went on a 12-to-zero run
that gave it a 22-point lead and
sealed the victory.
With the win, Stanford ad
vances to the semifinals of the
tournament to take on Arizona
State. The Sun Devils defeated in
state rival Arizona 68-53 last night.
Senior forward Kimberly
Brandon, the Sun Devils' leading
scorer, led ASU with 15 points and
six rebounds. Center Kali Bennet
also scored in double figures for
the Sun Devils with 10 points.
Arizona State (20-10,10-8 Pac

12) is the four seed in the inaugural
Pac-12 tournament. At the Feb. 2
meeting in Tempe, Stanford de
feated the Sun Devils by a score of
62-49. In that game Nneka unsur
prisingly dominated in the post to
a tune of 22 points and 16 re
bounds, while Chiney followed her
older sister close behind, racking
up 20 points and 16 rebounds of
her own.

If the Sun Devils hope to upset
the Cardinal, ASU will need to
find an answer for Stanford's
powerful post game. The Cardi
nal outrebounded the Wildcats
48-24 in the last meeting, and
outscored them in the paint by a
34-20 margin.
The semifinal matchup will tip
off at noon on Friday in Los Ange
les.
