# END OF THE LINE
## CAL RALLIES FROM HALFTIME DEFECIT TO END CARD'S RUN 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
Andrew Zimmerman was not going to end his Stan
ford career quietly. The senior forward, who averaged
less than four points and 13 minutes per game during
the regular season, played the game of his life in Thurs
day night's quarterfinals matchup against the Califor
nia Golden Bears, but ultimately it wasn't enough, as
the Cardinal fell to the Bears 77-71 to end its roller
coaster season in a disappointing fashion.
Zimmerman, known for his grizzly hairstyle and
brute determination, scored a career-high 22 points on
8-15 shooting in his last ever game in a Stanford Cardi
nal uniform.

3/08, Los Angeles Staples Center
Stanford (21-11,10-8 Pac-12) was looking to follow
in Oregon State's footsteps, as the Beavers managed to
shock the first-ranked Washington Huskies earlier in
the day, upsetting them by a final count of 86-84. A win
against Cal (24-8,13-5 Pac-12) would have put Stan
ford in good position to claim the Pac-12 conference
crown, and with it, an automatic bid in the NCAA
Tournament. However, despite a quick start and a ca
reer-best performance from Zimmerman, the Cardi
nal came up just short in a hard-fought game.
The two rivals traded baskets for much of the first
half. In the first eight minutes, there were six lead
changes and three ties, as neither team could pull away
from its opponent. The Cardinal gradually managed to
grab the lead, going up 28-21 on a pair of free throws

Senior forward Josh Owens (above) scored six points, but got into early foul trouble as
the Stanford men's basketball team was unable to hold a seven-point halftime lead
against Cal in the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 tournament. Despite the Cardinal's hot
start to the season, it will miss the NCAA tournament for the fourth consecutive season.
