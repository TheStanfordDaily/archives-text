# END OF THE LINE
## CAL RALLIES FROM HALFTIME DEFECIT TO END CARD'S RUN 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
Andrew Zimmerman was not going to end his Stan
ford career quietly. The senior forward, who averaged
less than four points and 13 minutes per game during
the regular season, played the game of his life in Thurs
day night's quarterfinals matchup against the Califor
nia Golden Bears, but ultimately it wasn't enough, as
the Cardinal fell to the Bears 77-71 to end its roller
coaster season in a disappointing fashion.
Zimmerman, known for his grizzly hairstyle and
brute determination, scored a career-high 22 points on
8-15 shooting in his last ever game in a Stanford Cardi
nal uniform.

3/08, Los Angeles Staples Center
Stanford (21-11,10-8 Pac-12) was looking to follow
in Oregon State's footsteps, as the Beavers managed to
shock the first-ranked Washington Huskies earlier in
the day, upsetting them by a final count of 86-84. A win
against Cal (24-8,13-5 Pac-12) would have put Stan
ford in good position to claim the Pac-12 conference
crown, and with it, an automatic bid in the NCAA
Tournament. However, despite a quick start and a ca
reer-best performance from Zimmerman, the Cardi
nal came up just short in a hard-fought game.
The two rivals traded baskets for much of the first
half. In the first eight minutes, there were six lead
changes and three ties, as neither team could pull away
from its opponent. The Cardinal gradually managed to
grab the lead, going up 28-21 on a pair of free throws

Senior forward Josh Owens (above) scored six points, but got into early foul trouble as
the Stanford men's basketball team was unable to hold a seven-point halftime lead
against Cal in the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 tournament. Despite the Cardinal's hot
start to the season, it will miss the NCAA tournament for the fourth consecutive season.
from senior forward Josh Owens.
Unfortunately for Owens, he did
not have a large impact on the
game, as he was forced to sit due
to foul trouble.
Stanford managed to close out
the first half well, as sophomore
guard Aaron Bright hit a runner
in traffic just as time expired to
put the Cardinal up 30-23. Stan
ford was able to capitalize on 14
Cal turnovers in the first twenty
minutes to take the lead. Zimmer
man led Stanford with nine points
on 3-of-6 shooting in the first half.
However, the Cardinal lead
wouldn't last long. Cal got off to a
quick start in the second half, tak
ing a 38-33 lead after sophomore

guard Alan Crabbe hit a three
pointer in transition with 16 min
utes to go. Freshman guard Chas
son Randle managed to halt a 15-
3 Cal run with a driving layup to
pull Stanford to within three. The
Cardinal struggled to overcome
this deficit, though, as a balanced
and confident Cal offensive at
tack kept Stanford on its heels.
Much of Cal's offensive suc
cess could be attributed to senior
guard Jorge Gutierrez. The senior
knifed through the Stanford de
fense time and again, hurting
them both in the paint and from
the three-point line. Every time
the Golden Bears needed a big
shot, Gutierrez was the go-to guy.
After Aaron Bright hit a three to
cut Cal's lead to three, Gutierrez
countered with a long ball of his
own to put the Golden Bears up
48-43.
Still, the Card continued to cut

away at Cal's lead, finally manag
ing to tie the game at 56 apiece
after Randle went two for two
from the charity stripe. After that,
the Zimmerman show began.
After a three-point attempt from
Bright rimmed out, Zimmerman
soared into the paint for an offen
sive rebound and put-back to tie
the game at 60 with 6:03 remaining.
At that point, Cal decided that
it was not going to be embar
rassed by its cross-Bay rivals for a
second straight game, orchestrat
ing a quick 10-2 run to go back up
by eight with just 2:58 left. Just
when the game appeared out of
reach, Randle hit a huge three
pointer with 1:40 remaining. He
followed it with a runner on the
next possession, cutting Cal's lead
to 73-69. Unfortunately, it was too
little too late for the Card, as the
Golden Bears managed to close
out a 77 to 71 victory with solid

free throw shooting down the
stretch.

For Cal, it was a tale of two
halves. After committing double
digit turnovers in the first period,
they were much more secure with
the ball down the stretch, giving it
up just three times in the second
half. Additionally, the Cardinal
could not slow down Gutierrez,
who torched Stanford for 22
points, 19 of which came in the
second half. The senior guard
made a strong case for Pac-12
Player of the Year with his Thurs
day night performance.
Stanford's Chasson Randle fol
lowed up a phenomenal Wednes
day night performance in
which he scored a Pac-12 tourna
ment record 27 points in the first
half with 19 points. While Ran
dle struggled offensively in the
first half, he regained the form that
has turned him into Stanford's

premier scorer in the second.
The story for Stanford was
Zimmerman, who closed out his
Cardinal career, one that has been
defined by hard work, with a
bang. He left every ounce of fight
he had left on the Staples Center
court, but it wasn't enough.
While head coach Johnny
Dawkins and his Cardinal players
are surely disappointed by the
abrupt end to their season, they
were able to accomplish many
things that past teams have failed
to do. Dawkins eclipsed 20 wins
for the first time in his short Stan
ford career, and the Cardinal will
look to build on this momentum
next season.

The Pac-12 tournament contin
ues tomorrow with the semifinal
round.
