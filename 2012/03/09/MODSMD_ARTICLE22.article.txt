# Crowds put tourney in jeopardy
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
The eighth game of this
most recent incarnation
of the Pac-12 Men's Bas
ketball Tournament is
just half over at the time
I'm writing this column, but it has
already reminded us just what
makes a conference tournament so
special.
Last night's four matchups were
just about as good as they could get.
Underdog Oregon State, the only
team still alive below the top eight,
knocked off No. 1 seed Washington.
Arizona and UCLA, who dominat
ed the conference in the 19905, went
to the final minutes of the Wildcats'
66-58 win with the game still up in
the air. Archrivals Stanford and
Cal, going blow-for-blow for 40
minutes, faced each other for the
third time in a season for the first
time since 1990.
Conference tournaments have
become something of a given in col
lege basketball, with every confer
ence besides the Ivy League
which is still living in the dark ages,
sans athletic scholarships hold
ing one each year. But that wasn't
always the case, and the then-Pac
-10 departed from the tournament
format between 1991 and 2001,
with the regular-season conference
champion getting the automatic bid
to the NCAA Tournament in lieu of
a conference-tourney winner.
When the Pac-10 Tournament
was re-instituted in 2002 by an 8-2
vote Stanford and Arizona, who
had been on top of the conference
for four ye ars at that point, were the
only naysayers the idea was to
make it "a major attraction on the
Pacific Coast," according to the
Pac-10's October 2000 release. And
since just about everyone in the
conference had a chance to make it
to the Big Dance the tourna
ment was expanded from eight to
10 teams with the addition of a play
in round in 2006 regardless of
regular-season performance, the
Pac-10 Tournament had all the
makings of an exciting display of
West Coast basketball.
But in recent years it has be
come a poorly attended event that
attracted just 12,000 spectators to
19,000-seat Staples Center last sea
son for the finals, despite its fair
share of exciting action. The cham
pionship game has been decided by
four or fewer points in each of the
last four years, and three times in
the last 10 seasons, a team seeded
fourth or worse has taken home the
conference title.
This year's tournament looked
to be one of the most wide-open in
conference history, with Stanford
head coach Johnny Dawkins saying
that the Cardinal and "11 other
teams" all had a legitimate shot at
competing. After top-seeded Wash
ington was eliminated last night the
championship is still completely up
for grabs, and the entertainment
value seems as high as ever. But
only 6,747 fans were in attendance
for Wednesday's opening games
and the stands still looked pretty
empty last night, even for the game
between in-state schools Stanford
and Cal.
If anything, the stakes are higher
in the Pac-12 Tournament this year
with so many teams fighting for at
large bids to the Big Dance, but fans
still aren't flocking to L.A. for the
four days of games.
Because of the ailing atten
dance, the conference has been
forced to consider leaving the
prominent Southern California
market in search of a better venue
announced by Pac-12 Commis
sioner Larry Scott on Wednesday
as Los Angeles' bid for the event
comes to an end this season. One of
the leading contenders is Las Vegas
of all places, over 250 miles away
from the nearest Pac-12 school,
USC.That doesn't exactly seem like
the right answer to increasing atten
dance, unless you're an Arizona or
Arizona State fan who would have
an hour-shorter drive to Sin City.
Hopefully the Pac-12's new TV
deals will spark some more interest
in the tournament in the coming
years, but regardless, it's time to face
the facts: Despite its postseason im
plications and down-to-the-wire
showdowns year after year, this
event just won't draw crowds in the
near future.
The 2008 tournament drew
more than 80,000 spectators over
four days, back when the Lopez
Twins were battling Kevin Love in
the Stanford-UCLA final, but the
