# BACK ON THE FARM

### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team returns to
action this Saturday against a rare East Coast
opponent: the Yale Bulldogs.The Cardinal has
been off for two weeks since the annual ITA
National Team Indoor Championship at the
end of February. The team is in the midst of a
lull in its schedule before competition picks
up after spring break in the buildup to May's
NCAA Championship.

Stanford will be looking to try to build off
of the momentum that it has generated in its
past few matches. The return of senior ail-
American Bradley Klahn has infused life
back into a Cardinal lineup that had seemed
listless for much of the beginning of the dual
match season.

Klahn's presence has provided some need
ed depth for head coach John Whitlinger's
squad and has consequently given the Cardi
nal much better head-to-head singles
matchups in its contests. Since Klahn's return.

the Cardinal is 3-1 against quality opponents,
including top ten teams Virginia, Baylor and
Kentucky.

Coach Whitlinger must hope that Stan
ford's momentum has not dissipated over the
course of the two-week break from team com
petition. When asked about this possibility,
senior Ryan Thacher said Stanford would be
ready.

"The team has taken the past few weeks to
address some of the health issues that often
arise mid-season," Thacher said. "That said,
practices have been very focused and guys
seem anxious to get back out on the court."
Health issues like the back injury that side
lined Klahn for the beginning of the season
are serious concerns for the Cardinal and this
two-week lull is the perfect time to address
them.

"We know that teams really look forward
to playing us on our home courts, and we will
have to be ready to compete against Yale,"
said Thacher. "Hopefully, we can continue to
build off the momentum from our last few

matches as we enter into spring break."
The Bulldogs (4-3) are definitely consid
ered to be underdogs heading into Saturday's
match with No. 9 Stanford. Junior John Huang
and Daniel Hoffman, two products of Califor
nia Huang from Irvine and Hoffman an
Atherton native lead the Bulldogs in sin
gles.
Stanford is currently 9-4 on the season in
what promises to be a very competitive and
strong Pac-12 race as always. In the mix is
USC, the three-time defending national
champion, and UCLA, which demolished
Stanford in a 6-1 win a month ago. In recent
years however, Stanford has started off slowly
much like this season but then went on
to play its best tennis in May.
Saturday's match is the Cardinal's final
match before spring break. The action begins
at 1 p.m. on Saturday at theTaube Family Ten
nis Center.
