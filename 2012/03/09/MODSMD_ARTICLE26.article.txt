## TOP 5 ANIMATED DISNEY MOVIES 
### 
At this point in the quarter, it's easy to
remember why being a kid is so fan
tastic and, of course, we're all look
ing for procrastination in any form:
especially a movie. As we sob over a
generation of kids who have never
seen Cinderella because they're too
busy texting on their iPhones at age
seven, Intermission takes a look at the
greatest Disney animated classics.
Fantasia (1940)
One of Disney's early productions,
"Fantasia" transforms eight classical
works into cartoon form with the help
of Mickey Mouse, who plays a star
ring role as a sorcerer's apprentice.
Though seen as one of Disney's
"high-brow" movies, resulting in
mixed reviews from critics, "Fantasia"
represents one of Disney's more suc
cessful deviations from the norm dur
ing the Disney Princess era.
Cinderella (1950)
Th is wouldn't be a top Disney list
without Cinderella, one of the major
films of Disney's "golden era" and a
giant leap into the hearts of countless
little girls. With some of the most
memorable Disney compositions
("Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo," "The Work
Song,") and the perfect happily ever
after, no fairy tale will ever top that of
Prince Charming and his princess.
Alice in Wonderland
(1951)
Kids love "Alice" because it makes no
sense. White Rabbits, Mad Hatters,
random growth spurts, cards as peo
ple - Lewis Carroll was allegedly
under several influences while writing

the original story, as evidenced in the
final product. However, everyone
secretly wants to have as epic an
adventure as Alice did, even if it
requires sketchy sidekicks.

Aladdin (1992)
"Aladdin" was one of Disney's first
attempts at reaching a larger market
it was the beginning of the wave
of more international tales, such as
"The Lion King" and "Mulan." One
of the last hand-drawn animations
produced by Disney, "Aladdin" gives
hope to every viewer as it weaves a
tale of endless possibilities in both
romance and material possessions.

The Lion King (1994)
"The Lion King" still stands as
Disney's highest grossing 2D animat
ed film in the United States, and for
good reason. Rereleased in 2011 in a
3D version (and yes, we still cried
during the film ...), "The Lion King"
follows Simba's transformation into a
king after his father's demise. Mostly,
though, Scar is one of the most epic
villains in cinematic history. Too bad
his kids weren't equally cunning.
