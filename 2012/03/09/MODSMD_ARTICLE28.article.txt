On Saturday, March 3, a lecture hall
in the Geology corner, typically
utilized for academic events, played
host to a show far from the likes of an
IHUM lecture. People filled the room to
witness the end of quarter show of the
Robber Barons, Stanford's only sketch com
edy group.
In a little over an hour, the Robber
Barons provided laughs with a show enti

innuendo-filled impersonation of Winston

that the audience could relate to and thus
got some big laughs. Scenarios included a
dining hall argument over the last burrito, a
manipulation of the RA interview process, a
hilarious, somewhat "douchey" retelling of a
study-abroad experience and the statistic
filled PowerPoint presentation of a profes
sor's findings on the infidelity of his wife.
The real audience favorite, however,
was a skit that included the impersonations
of — and a mock rap battle between two
students who have acquired a degree of
campus fame: Stewart MacGregor-Dennis
'l3, the ASSU Vice President; and Ralph
Nguyen 'l2, a comedian and creator of the
popular Facebook page "MemeChu." A
third party ultimately decided the battle,
when a member dressed as Andrew Luck
