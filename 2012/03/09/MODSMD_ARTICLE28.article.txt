## ROBBER BARONS TAKE ON MEMES, MICKEY AND MUSIC 
### – isaac HALYARD contact isaac: ihalyard@stanford. edu 
On Saturday, March 3, a lecture hall
in the Geology corner, typically
utilized for academic events, played
host to a show far from the likes of an
IHUM lecture. People filled the room to
witness the end of quarter show of the
Robber Barons, Stanford's only sketch com
edy group.
In a little over an hour, the Robber
Barons provided laughs with a show enti
tled "NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL ROB
BER BARONS!" The group performed 15
"tracks" (or short skits), many of which tied

in to the '9os pop music and culture theme.
The show started with a welcome rou
tine in which members of the group Tristan
Kruth 'l2 and Kevin Hurlbutt 'l4 thanked
the audience for coming to the show. The
welcome quickly developed into an inter
vention of Kruth's Altoid addiction. Hilarity
and absurdity ensued, giving the audience a
taste of was in store for them.
The Robber Barons showcased a vari
ety of skits, one of which included a sexual,
innuendo-filled impersonation of Winston
Churchill. Many of the skits were well-writ
ten satires of everyday "Stanford" scenarios
that the audience could relate to and thus
got some big laughs. Scenarios included a
dining hall argument over the last burrito, a
manipulation of the RA interview process, a
hilarious, somewhat "douchey" retelling of a
study-abroad experience and the statistic
filled PowerPoint presentation of a profes
sor's findings on the infidelity of his wife.
The real audience favorite, however,
was a skit that included the impersonations
of — and a mock rap battle between two
students who have acquired a degree of
campus fame: Stewart MacGregor-Dennis
'l3, the ASSU Vice President; and Ralph
Nguyen 'l2, a comedian and creator of the
popular Facebook page "MemeChu." A
third party ultimately decided the battle,
when a member dressed as Andrew Luck
stepped in and dropped his own
verse.
Outside of Stanford humor,
the group provided an eclectic
variety of skits, ranging from the
divorce trial of Mickey and
Minnie Mouse (which included
an amusing Donald Duck imper
sonation by Mary Glen Fredrick
'l2) to a skit that captured the tri
als and tribulations of a new stu
dent who didn't have a butt.
Playing well with the '9os theme, a
student led a delusional existence
in which he believed himself to be
a character from the popular teen
series, "Saved by the Bell."
All in all, the show was hys
terical. The Robber Barons show
cased an array of skits filled with
absurdity, childhood nostalgia and
Stanford satirical humor to shape
an ordinary Saturday night into a
hilarious experience.
