# THEATER
## A 						BRAND NEW 'BEAUTY' 
### â€“ alexandra HEENEY contact alexandra: aheeney@stanford. edu 
On opening night of "Beauty and
the Beast" the audience was filled
with parents and their young
daughters, many of whom were dressed as
princesses. While this is an appropriate and
fun musical for kids, with enduring music, it
is based on an 18th-century fairytale and

thus is a bit outdated. While it's a story of
inner beauty triumphing over outer beauty,
it must be noted that the story requires that
the beautiful woman, Belle, see past the bad
looks and bad temper of the man, the Beast,
and not the reverse. Would the story be so
popular and believable if the gender roles

were reversed? It's the 21st century, so is it
too much to ask for a tale about a beautiful
man and an ugly woman with inner beauty
where the man must see past her looks?
But curmudgeon aside, this is a thrilling
production of the musical "Beauty and the
Beast." It's the same tale, as old as time, from
the 1991 animated film, but with seven extra
musical numbers and an amazing spectacle
on stage. "Beauty" is the eighth-longest run
ning Broadway musical: It ran for 13 years
and is now remounted and on tour, stopping

in San Jose this week. The
new production reimag
ines this simple fairytale as
live theatre, with lavish

sets, fabulous choreogra
phy, appropriate genre act
ing and memorable songs
composed by Alan
Menken with lyrics by
Howard Ashman.
The production is at
its best during the song
and-dance numbers, which
are beautifully choreo
graphed by Matt West. The
opening number in a
provincial town effortlessly
introduces us to the hustle
and bustle, as the towns-

people meet and greet and
Belle bemoans her exis-

tence as an outsider meant
for bigger and better

things. The most thrilling
dance routine is in the famous "Be Our
Guest," where the clocks and dishes invite
Belle out to dinner in the casde. Women
dressed as plates circle and fan around Belle;
forks and knives parade and dance; and

there's even some impressive back flips done
by a man dressed as a carpet. West creates a
constant feeling of action and liveliness that's
never too chaotic.

As this is a fairytale, the characters are
all played as over-the-top caricatures. Most
of the time this works, though it does make
some of the jokes difficult to land with the
adult audience. Emily Behny as Belle has
wonderful stage presence, and while her
character is the relatively banal bright-eyed
youth, she's instantly likable and always
seems natural in her movements; she's also
got a great voice. Baritone Dane Agostinis as
the Beast is playful in his approach to the
Beast in need of taming; he plays for the

laughs, but it's a welcome choice since it
gives us some sympathy for the Beast early
on. Best of all is Gaston (Logan Deninghoff),

Belle's unwanted suitor, full of arrogance and
biceps, beloved by all the other local women.
Deninghoff is so over-the-top that while
Gaston remains incredibly unlikable, he's not
altogether creepy, and he's a great source of
laughs.

The sets, designed by Stanley A. Meyer,
are lavish and magical, effortlessly transport
ing us from a terrifying forest to a baroque
castle and then to a quaint provincial town.
These locations may all occur on the same
stage, but you constantly feel like you're trav
elling to a far-off place. There are multiple
set pieces that wheel on and offstage from
houses to the library to the town square
which not only evoke place but also help to
drive the action and blocking on stage.
There's a beautiful scene that plays out
between Belle and the Beast in the library,
where they snuggle up over a good book,
high up on the set piece. Meanwhile, the ser
vants, on the ground and stage right, watch
the couple hopefully. There's enough physi
cal space between them both vertical and
horizontal that you can actually believe

that Belle and the Beast can't hear or see the
servants and that the servants inhabit some
thing of a different world than the Beast.
The lighting designed by Natasha Katz
works beautifully with the sets and is respon
sible for creating much of the magic. The
spotlight on the Beast when the curse is bro
ken is startling as the rest of the stage goes
dark. The lighting cues throughout are used
wonderfully to isolate parts of the stage, like
allowing Belle and the Beast to court in a
small corner downstage while the moonlight
looms over everything else: the stage doesn't
seem empty, and it creates a romantic mood.
The spectacle is flawless, and it's exciting
to see how the production has imagined the
enchanted forest, the wolves, the witch, the
costumes and all of the locations. There's a
lot of technical know-how involved which
makes for sets so perfect that despite their
extravagance, they can go unnoticed because
they simply fit It's impossible to leave the

theatre without humming one of the
tunes, from "Gaston" to "Belle" to the
title number "Beauty and the Beast": the
music, if not the story, is timeless.
Nevertheless, I can't help hoping that
something a bit more modern, a bit
more feminist and a bit less encourag
ing of the beautiful princess fable will
come out soon to entertain our young
girls. Because while it's good fun to
dress up like a princess at age five and
escape to the world of "Beauty and the
Beast," it might be nice to give young
women something more realistic and
empowering to aspire to.
