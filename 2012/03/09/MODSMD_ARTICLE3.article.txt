## Online privacy concerns experts Stanford researchers address Google's open-ended policy 
### I LEAN A NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
Stanford and Bay Area Internet privacy
researchers and analysts are cautious about
recent government calls for online privacy
legislation and expressed concern about the
possible direction of consumer privacy
rights at Google.
Researchers at the Stanford Center for
Internet and Society (CIS) commented on
President Obama's recently proposed Fed
eral Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights and on
new developments at Google, most notably
the company's March 1 privacy policy con
solidation and reports that Google was by

passing Safari's default privacy settings and
tracking users through cookies.
CIS student fellow Jonathan Mayer, who
published the initial report about Google
and Safari, said that Google's new policy
highlights a growing corporate concern
over online consumer privacy. According to
Mayer, a second year graduate student in
law and computer science, the policy
changes have already garnered internation
al criticism and raised questions about the
company's relationship with its consumers.
"Privacy is right now undergoing the
renaissance that computer security under
went a decade ago," Mayer said. "It wasn't
until, give or take, the last five to 10 years
ago that people really started to put their
entire lives online."
Mayer said that concerns for privacy
protection have grown steadily, as con
sumers post more personal information on

line, and as advertising corporations deter
mine practices for using this information.
Aleecia McDonald, a CIS resident fel
low specializing in Internet privacy, said in
an email to The Daily, "there has been a
steady procession of problems, including


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
privacy problems from what were
once highly trusted brands and
companies."
"Government and press are
responding to the same underly
ing issues that companies are not
respecting users' choice and con
trol over data pertaining to
them," McDonald said.

Google privacy changes
According to Mayer, the only
two things that have substantially
changed with Google's privacy
policy are that Google is now able
to use web search history with all
the other data it collects, and that
it now has access to You Tube
data.

Otherwise, Mayer said that the
policy is still too open-ended and
raises concerns of liability.
"One real issue about moving
towards an open-ended privacy
policy is let's say they do mess up,
or move in a direction that's less

consumer friendly, now there's
not a lot to hold them to," Mayer
said.

Mayer added while Google
has maintained a good reputation
with the exception of particu
lar issues regarding data collec
tion, as in the Safari case there
is still value in being able to hold
companies responsible for priva
cy matters.
Lee Tien '79, senior staff attor
ney at the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF), said in an
email to The Daily that Google
only partly succeeded in alleviat
ing privacy concerns.

"The short story is that Google
did a good thing in terms of trans
parency by explaining what they
were doing, but did a poor job of
explaining what was new and dif
ferent," Tien said.

Mayer said that there is a cur
rent debate over Google's legal li
ability with regards to the Safari
incident, as well as whether the
Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) would need to enforce
Google's statement on its web
site, advising Safari users that dis
abling Safari cookies would mean
disabling Google cookies as well.
Federal action
On Feb. 23, the Obama Ad
ministration unveiled a Federal
Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights
aimed precisely at the issues
raised in conversations about

Google's practices.
McDonald said it is merely a
coincidence that Mayer's report
was published just before the fed
eral announcement.
While EFF is in favor of the
federal formulation, legislation
must now be created since it is
currently only a statement of
rights, Tien said.
McDonald agreed that the leg
islation would most likely only
happen in a second Obama term,
but for now the Do Not Track

(DNT) policy which allows
users to opt out of being tracked
on major browsers and other on
line corporations with access to
consumer information â€”is the
most reliable form of privacy pol
icy enforcement for companies
like Google.
Tien said the EFF gives
Google credit for agreeing to im
plement "Do Not Track" into the
Chrome browser by the end of
the year.

Mayer predicted that DNT
will serve as a political football in
coming weeks, "given that it's the
furthest along of all the attempts
at making a multi-stakeholder,
good-faith effort at a solution to a
consumer privacy problem."
Mayer's current research
looks into how the advertising in
dustry plans to adopt the DNT
technology, as well as how he
foresees this being an unsuccess
ful strategy, he said.
Regardless, Mayer said he has
high hopes for Do Not Track's fu
ture as currently the most reliable
form of enforcement.
"Initiatives like DNT are
going to be the standard bearers
into a new generation where gov
ernment does place some de
mands on companies' interaction
with personal information,"
Mayer said.
