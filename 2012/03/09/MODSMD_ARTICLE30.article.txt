## GETTING UPPITY AT Cal Avenue Farmers' Market

CC ■ armers' Market" There
was a time when the
.X. phrase would invoke an
image of your quirky middle school
physics teacher heading into town
on a tandem bike carrying empty
hemp-knit bags to pick up his
weekly stock of unpronounceable
root vegetables. That era has passed.

Today, farmers' markets are a
refuge of terminally hip foodies.

The same crowd that waits hours
amidst snowdrifts and yappy, pure
bred dogs at famed Parisian mac
aron maker Laduree's new Upper
East Side outpost also arises early
and adjusts brunch plans on the

weekends in order to hit up the
farmers' market. You're just as likely
to see artisan lattes (more about
that later) at a farmers' market as
you are to see a back-to-the land
love child in a tie-dyed muumuu.

So naturally, our fair city of Palo

Alto has not one, but two

every week.
Although the
Downtown Palo Alto

Farmers' Market has its merits,
the California Avenue Farmers'
Market is certainly the more rar-

efied of our local options and

therefore much more interesting to
write about. It's become a Sunday
staple for many Stanford students,
most notably the type who wears
sundresses and posts photos to
Instagram of salted, caramel-fla-

vored cupcakes (guilty as charged).

True to farmers' markets' new
image, California Ave. on Sunday
mornings is a literal smorgasbord of
the Bay Area's trendiest artisan pro
ducers. Every week, you'll find a

huge array of local produce, obscure
ethnic snack foods and fresh-baked

goods. This past week, I

counted no fewer
than ten different
orange varieties for
sale from just as

many family-owned

organic farms within a
hundred-mile radius

of the Stanford campus. Point

Reyes-based Cowgirl Creamer
always operates a small tent to sell
some seriously high-quality cheeses;
my personal favorite is the perfectly
balanced, triple-cream Mt. Tarn
(unfortunately, it costs about twenty
dollars a pound).
Another must is Bay Bread's
stand, which sells fresh baguettes,
quiches and other pastries the
same stuff you'll find at a string of
completely yummy cafes through
out San Francisco (Boulange, Cafe
Rigolo, etc). A dedicated kitchen

manager to my sorority house, I
picked up a bag of chocolate crois
sants and a boule of walnut bread

this past week for everyone; every
thing was gone within thirty min
utes. Equally popular were the two
rotisserie chickens I brought back
from Rolißoti, a gourmet food
truck equipped to cook chickens on
slowly rotating spits. And while they
may have been every sorority-girl
before-Cabo's worst nightmare, the

rosemary potatoes cooked in grease
drippings from the chicken spits

now hold a very special place in my
heart. Sadly, the girls in my house
will never know how wonderful the

artfully adorned lattes from
Zombießunner (yes, a running
store) taste I had drunk the last

drop within minutes of purchase.
Every Sunday from 9 a.m. to 1
p.m., the California Avenue

Farmers' Market is an absolute must

on any serious (or semi-serious)

tour of the Palo Alto food scene. It
isn't the sort of farmers' market you
would have found in ferry Garcia's
Palo Alto, but frankly that's a huge
improvement.
