## TV MEETS PSYCHOLOGY 'UNITED STATES OF TARA' BRINGS PERSONALITY 
### – aaron BRODER contact aaron: abroder@stanford. edu 
Like its title
character, "The United
States of Tara" has multi
ple personalities. At times it's a
comedy, poking fun at the zany
situations Tara's multiple personal
ities get her family into. At other
times it tries to be a suspense-driv
en thriller its most annoying
personality, and one that thankful
ly only emerges in the back half of
the last season. But its true person
ality, the one that's most developed

and nuanced, is an emotionally
grounded, character-driven family
drama about how the Gregson
family manages to stay whole
despite and sometimes because
of— Tara's dissociative identity
disorder.
I mean, when it wants to be,
this show can be dark. I'm not
talking about the creepy, unsatisfy
ing serial killer arc in the third sea
son. I'm talking about moments
like the one when Marshall
Gregson sets the family shed

on fire to get back at T, one of
Tara's personalities, for making out
with the guy he's crushing on. Or
when Charmaine, Tara's sister, tells
Tara she doesn't want her near her
newborn baby in case she transi
tions into another personality and
hurts the baby. These moments are
all driven by believable emotion,
and it's hard not to feel a pang of
sympathy for Tara and her family
when watching.
Of course, that only makes it
all the weaker when the show's

other personalities emerge. After
all, it might be funny to see Buck,
Tara's southern hick personality,
come out and crack a few jokes,
but once you've seen the emotion
al trauma he puts the family
through when he starts a relation-

ship with a local barkeeper, his
appearances become much less
funny. It's a difficult line to toe,
and oftentimes "United States"
ends up on the wrong side.

The character development
drives this show, which is why
when the plot takes center stage it
feels a little lacking. All of these
characters are distinctly human;
they all have their own problems:
take Kate, the other Gregson child
(played by Brie Larson, who I'm
happy to see again after first meet
ing in "Scott Pilgrim vs. the
World"), maturing from a petu
lant teenager to a mature adult.

She changes her mind as quickly
and often as Tara changes her per
sonality, but unlike Tara, she grows
by leaps and bounds in an evolu
tion that sometimes feels rushed,
but never forced.
When it comes to TV, I'm
often invested more in the story
than in the acting; bad acting will
pull me out of a show, but good
acting tends to just blend in to
the background for me. But it's

impossible to talk about "United
States" without Toni Collette, who
plays Tara, and the way she effort
lessly pulls off not one, but even
tually eight different characters,
each distinct from one another in
dress, voice and manner. Tara is
completely different from T, and
both are completely different
from Alice, the 'sos housewife
and so on.
Though it stumbles a few

times, eventually "United States"
manages to end on an emotionally
strong note. In fact, you'd never
guess that the third season finale
wasn't originally written to be a
season finale. Things in the
Gregson family still aren't good,
but it's better that way. I'm a suck
er for ambiguous endings, after all,
and after years of getting worse, it
doesn't make sense that it would
just snap back to normal. It's as

close to a happy ending as the
family can believably get, and after
three years of putting up with the
discordant states of Tara, boy does
that family deserve it.
