## TV MEETS PSYCHOLOGY 'UNITED STATES OF TARA' BRINGS PERSONALITY 
### – aaron BRODER contact aaron: abroder@stanford. edu 
Like its title
character, "The United
States of Tara" has multi
ple personalities. At times it's a
comedy, poking fun at the zany
situations Tara's multiple personal
ities get her family into. At other
times it tries to be a suspense-driv
en thriller its most annoying
personality, and one that thankful
ly only emerges in the back half of
the last season. But its true person
ality, the one that's most developed

and nuanced, is an emotionally
grounded, character-driven family
drama about how the Gregson
family manages to stay whole
despite and sometimes because
of— Tara's dissociative identity
disorder.
I mean, when it wants to be,
this show can be dark. I'm not
talking about the creepy, unsatisfy
ing serial killer arc in the third sea
son. I'm talking about moments
like the one when Marshall
Gregson sets the family shed

on fire to get back at T, one of
Tara's personalities, for making out
with the guy he's crushing on. Or
when Charmaine, Tara's sister, tells
Tara she doesn't want her near her
newborn baby in case she transi
tions into another personality and
hurts the baby. These moments are
all driven by believable emotion,
and it's hard not to feel a pang of
sympathy for Tara and her family
when watching.
Of course, that only makes it
all the weaker when the show's

other personalities emerge. After
all, it might be funny to see Buck,
Tara's southern hick personality,
come out and crack a few jokes,
but once you've seen the emotion
al trauma he puts the family
through when he starts a relation-

ship with a local barkeeper, his
appearances become much less
funny. It's a difficult line to toe,
and oftentimes "United States"
ends up on the wrong side.
