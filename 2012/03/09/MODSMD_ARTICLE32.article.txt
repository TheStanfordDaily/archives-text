## 'FOUR LITTLE INJUNS' STANFORD ORIGINAL TACKLES RACE, HUMOR 
### – paul BROWNLEE contact paul: pbrownle@stanford. edu 
cc ■ Little Injuns," produced as
part of the Drama Graduate
.X. Student Showcase, examines the
portrayals of Native Americans on film and
on stage, showing how stereotypical "Indian"
characters continually force out real Native
characters and their true stories.

"Injuns" opens on a Broadway show
rehearsal for a play that features Native
American characters. The stage manager, four
actors and a tech crew member are rehearsing
for "Twilight The Musical," featuring char
acters including Jacob Black, Pocahontas,
Chief Wahoo and Grandma Willow. The
rehearsal is quickly interrupted when four
actual Native Americans wander into the
space looking for an author to write their
story. After some resistance, the stage manager
decides to direct their story for the stage,
already seeing the interpersonal drama unfold

between the four Natives. Through their
retelling, we learn the tragic story of one of
the Native's relation with his two troubled
children and the man's mother (the children's
grandmother).
The dark story unfolds while the non-

Native actors watch and attempt to re-pres
ent the stories on their own. The Natives grow
frustrated with the actors' stereotypical repre
sentations and the censuring the stage manag
er attempts to impose on the controversial
subject matter. The actors and stage manager,
meanwhile, find themselves at odds with how
Natives are usually presented on stage versus
the actual Natives and the real stories they are
presenting.
The script for "Injuns" was written and
directed by Myrton Running Wolf, a drama
Ph.D. student and Native American. The
script for the piece is complex and socially
pointed, carefully weaving the tragic story of
one Native family along with ideas about
dilemmas in portraying Natives on the stage,
on TV and in film. In his director's note,

Running Wolf acknowledges that the script
was loosely adapted from Luigi Pirandello's
famous "Six Characters in Search of an

Author," the title of which explains the con
nection. Like in "Six Characters," the four
characters in "Injuns" are not real people, but
they do have real stories to tell.
While Running Wolf's script is strong,
the production falls short of achieving its

power and poignancy. Each of the actors has
strong moments in the show, but characters
fade when they are not the focus of the
action. One notable performance comes from
undergraduate Rachel RoseFigura 'l3, who
gives a hilarious performance as
"Pocahontas." RoseFigura's role offers wel
comed comic relief in an often-dark piece.
Running Wolf also acts in the piece, play
ing the Native American father, and the fact
that he plays a role serves as a possible expla
nation for the general lack of direction in the
piece as a whole. Actors seem to move with
little certainty or specificity. Much of the
movement and choreography feels forced and
confused, and the dialogue runs at a sloppy
pace; the actors often overlap lines, and sever
al pauses seem to go on longer than originally
intended.
In terms of technical elements, "Injuns"
is fairly simple. The set is a simple, bare

rehearsal studio. The costumes, like the set,
are primarily rehearsal or street clothing, with
the exception of a stunning and elaborate
"Indian" dress worn by RoseFigura. The dress
is suggestive of a Pocahontas costume and is
humorously mocked by the Native American
daughter as a "buckskin Halloween stripper
outfit."
While the production feels under
rehearsed and largely unfocused, "Four Little
Injuns" is honest and rich in its perspective on
Native American characters and stories in the
ater and on stage. Running Wolf's ideas are
strong, and with a skilled and dedicated direc
tor, the script could really amount to a power
ful show, giving Native Americans a play wor
thy of their history—just the kind of show
the Native characters in "Injuns" so earnestly
seek.
Four Little Injuns will play again in the
Nitery Theater this Saturday at 8 p.m. Tickets
are $5. Visit drama.stanford.edu for more infor
