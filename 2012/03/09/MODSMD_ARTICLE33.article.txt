## MASTERING MASS EFFECT 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
I recently spent the better
part of 1,000 words
explaining why, after no
small amount of personal
distress, I decided to let go of

my obsession with experiencing Mass Effect
3 in the "best way possible" if there is such
a thing and just play through the damn
game on its own terms, come what may. After
15 hours back on the Normandy with my

crew, you might call me hypocritical for com
ing back with a column explaining the ideal
way to play Mass Effect 3. And you might be
right. But to be fair, this time I'm not focus
ing on the peripheral parts of the experience:
the visuals, the sound, the controller and so
on. I'm talking about the direct experience of
what's going on in your head when you play
the game. In other words, a lot of your enjoy
ment from Mass Effect 3 is going to depend
on your attitude. It might sound picky, but no
game in recent memory has boasted quite the
buildup or payoff that Mass Effect 3 does if
you play it right, that is.

First of all, I might have to burst some
bubbles. Electronic Arts and Bio Ware Project

Director Casey Hudson have
emphasized how accessible the
Mass Elfect three-quel is for new
comers to the series. That's under-

standable from a marketing perspective, but
it's completely wrong. It takes about 30 sec
onds into a truly "new" game in Mass Effect 3
when it asks if you suffered the loss of
Kaidan, Ashley or "numerous" unknown
people in the earlier games to realize that
it simply shouldn't be played on its own.
There are simply too many gnarls to the
series' plot, and too many of its twists are
made poignant by the simple fact that they
are chosen by the player. But by the same
token, I can't imagine a more rewarding
game to cap off a trilogy so long in the mak
ing. Even if Mass Effect 3 were junk, I'd have
to play it. Like a good round of poker, I've
been at the table too long. By now, I'm com
mitted to the plot.
For a game with the predominant theme
of sacrifice, it's strangely fitting that you have
to make some concessions to properly enjoy
Mass Effect 3.1 know it's a little pretentious to
help someone enjoy a single-player game...
but you'll just have to deal with that. You

Be a completionist
Mass Effect 3 goes out of its way to instill
a sense of imminent demise. The Reapers are
coming, and you're not ready. I give the game
a world of credit for selling me on the notion
that Earth is totally screwed if we don't do
something right now. But like just about any
game with an apocalypse-to-come, there
aren't any gameplay mechanics that are natu
rally compatible with that notion (I should
note that in some ways, the Dead Rising
games actually take a shot at this idea.) In
other words, you can take all the time you

want. It's an odd juxtaposition to the game's
oppressively ominous tone, and it lessens the
immersion a bit. But once you get over it,
there's plenty of good story content to soak
in. So go ahead and scan every planet, listen
to every conversation and talk to everyone.
Really, everyone. Like you're playing Dragon
Quest in 1988 and you have no clue where to
go. Besides, if you aren't playing Mass Effect 3
for the story and dialogue, why the hell are
you playing it at all?

Forget the DLC
Electronic Arts managed to irk more
than a few fans when word got out that Mass
Effect 3 would reserve a sizeable chunk of
downloadable content (DLC) exclusively for


might thank me later.
