## MASTERING MASS EFFECT 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
I recently spent the better
part of 1,000 words
explaining why, after no
small amount of personal
distress, I decided to let go of

my obsession with experiencing Mass Effect
3 in the "best way possible" if there is such
a thing and just play through the damn
game on its own terms, come what may. After
15 hours back on the Normandy with my

crew, you might call me hypocritical for com
ing back with a column explaining the ideal
way to play Mass Effect 3. And you might be
right. But to be fair, this time I'm not focus
ing on the peripheral parts of the experience:
the visuals, the sound, the controller and so
on. I'm talking about the direct experience of
what's going on in your head when you play
the game. In other words, a lot of your enjoy
ment from Mass Effect 3 is going to depend
on your attitude. It might sound picky, but no
game in recent memory has boasted quite the
buildup or payoff that Mass Effect 3 does if
you play it right, that is.

First of all, I might have to burst some
bubbles. Electronic Arts and Bio Ware Project

Director Casey Hudson have
emphasized how accessible the
Mass Elfect three-quel is for new
comers to the series. That's under-

standable from a marketing perspective, but
it's completely wrong. It takes about 30 sec
onds into a truly "new" game in Mass Effect 3
when it asks if you suffered the loss of
Kaidan, Ashley or "numerous" unknown
people in the earlier games to realize that
it simply shouldn't be played on its own.
There are simply too many gnarls to the
series' plot, and too many of its twists are
made poignant by the simple fact that they
are chosen by the player. But by the same
token, I can't imagine a more rewarding
game to cap off a trilogy so long in the mak
ing. Even if Mass Effect 3 were junk, I'd have
to play it. Like a good round of poker, I've
been at the table too long. By now, I'm com
mitted to the plot.
For a game with the predominant theme
of sacrifice, it's strangely fitting that you have
to make some concessions to properly enjoy
Mass Effect 3.1 know it's a little pretentious to
help someone enjoy a single-player game...
but you'll just have to deal with that. You

Mass Effect 3 goes out of its way to instill
a sense of imminent demise. The Reapers are
coming, and you're not ready. I give the game
a world of credit for selling me on the notion
that Earth is totally screwed if we don't do
something right now. But like just about any
game with an apocalypse-to-come, there
aren't any gameplay mechanics that are natu
rally compatible with that notion (I should
note that in some ways, the Dead Rising
games actually take a shot at this idea.) In
other words, you can take all the time you

want. It's an odd juxtaposition to the game's
oppressively ominous tone, and it lessens the
immersion a bit. But once you get over it,
there's plenty of good story content to soak
in. So go ahead and scan every planet, listen
to every conversation and talk to everyone.
Really, everyone. Like you're playing Dragon
Quest in 1988 and you have no clue where to
go. Besides, if you aren't playing Mass Effect 3
for the story and dialogue, why the hell are
you playing it at all?

Forget the DLC

players who bought the $BO
Collector's Edition. (Unless you
fork over about $lO for it, of
course.) What really upset people,
though, was that the "From
Ashes" DLC, as it's called, includ
ed a new party member. What's
more, this character is a Prothean.
If you've put in a few hours across
Mass Effect 1 and 2, that sounds
like something you wouldn't want
to miss.
But for better or for worse,
it's nothing to lose sleep over.
"From Ashes" is a reasonably
well-put-together piece of con
tent, but it doesn't add anything
qualitatively new to the experi
ence. On top of that, I certainly
haven't seen any Prothean-sized
holes in the story so far. After an
admittedly interesting introduc
tion that you can catch on
You Tube, he's a pretty forgettable
character.

Adjust your expectations, but
don't lower them
Mass Effect 3 puts you face
to face with a lot of major issues
that the series has teased out over
the years, and for the most part,
it lets you decide how they play
out. That, of course, is the cen
tral draw of the whole game. But
if you expect "big decisions" to
mean " flexible decisions," you'd
be wrong. Where the original
Mass Effect's story had a blank
slate to work with and its sequel
had some wiggle-room, Mass
Effect 3 carries the significant
burden of tying everything up.
That means that in terms of
player choices, Mass Effect 3
flows more like a river than an
ocean. But that otherwise disap
pointing fact comes with an
important silver lining, which I
think more than makes up for it.
Unlike its predecessors, Mass
Effect 3 is primarily about seeing
how old decisions resolve them
selves, which is rewarding in its
own way. It's different, but
refreshing once you get used to
it.

Mass Effect 3 feels like a
subtly different game, but given
all the loose ends that Bio Ware
needed to tie up, I applaud them
for making the necessary changes
to maintain the core experience
while adjusting it to be a conclu

sion rather than a table-setter.

a world of credit for selling me on the notion

though, was that the "From

If you've put in a few hours across
Mass Effect 1 and 2, that sounds
like something you wouldn't want

But for better or for worse,
it's nothing to lose sleep over.
"From Ashes" is a reasonably
well-put-together piece of con
tent, but it doesn't add anything
qualitatively new to the experi
ence. On top of that, I certainly
haven't seen any Prothean-sized
holes in the story so far. After an

Adjust your expectations, but
don't lower them
Mass Effect 3 puts you face
to face with a lot of major issues
that the series has teased out over
the years, and for the most part,
it lets you decide how they play
out. That, of course, is the cen
tral draw of the whole game. But
if you expect "big decisions" to
mean " flexible decisions," you'd
be wrong. Where the original
Mass Effect's story had a blank
slate to work with and its sequel
had some wiggle-room, Mass
Effect 3 carries the significant
burden of tying everything up.
That means that in terms of
player choices, Mass Effect 3
flows more like a river than an
ocean. But that otherwise disap
pointing fact comes with an
important silver lining, which I
think more than makes up for it.
Unlike its predecessors, Mass
Effect 3 is primarily about seeing
how old decisions resolve them
selves, which is rewarding in its
own way. It's different, but
refreshing once you get used to
it.

Mass Effect 3 feels like a
subtly different game, but given
all the loose ends that Bio Ware
needed to tie up, I applaud them
for making the necessary changes
to maintain the core experience
while adjusting it to be a conclu

sion rather than a table-setter.
I recently spent the better
part of 1,000 words
explaining why, after no
small amount of personal
distress, I decided to let go of

my obsession with experiencing Mass Effect
3 in the "best way possible" if there is such
a thing and just play through the damn
game on its own terms, come what may. After
15 hours back on the Normandy with my

crew, you might call me hypocritical for com
ing back with a column explaining the ideal
way to play Mass Effect 3. And you might be
right. But to be fair, this time I'm not focus
ing on the peripheral parts of the experience:
the visuals, the sound, the controller and so
on. I'm talking about the direct experience of
what's going on in your head when you play
the game. In other words, a lot of your enjoy
ment from Mass Effect 3 is going to depend
on your attitude. It might sound picky, but no
game in recent memory has boasted quite the
buildup or payoff that Mass Effect 3 does if
you play it right, that is.

First of all, I might have to burst some
bubbles. Electronic Arts and Bio Ware Project

Director Casey Hudson have
emphasized how accessible the
Mass Elfect three-quel is for new
comers to the series. That's under-

standable from a marketing perspective, but
it's completely wrong. It takes about 30 sec

when it asks if you suffered the loss of
Kaidan, Ashley or "numerous" unknown
people in the earlier games to realize that
it simply shouldn't be played on its own.
