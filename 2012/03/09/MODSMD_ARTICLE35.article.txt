## 'Space Chronicles' explores the universe BOOK critiqua 
### – sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
The astrophysicist and prolific science
writer Neil deGrasse Tyson, popu
larly hailed as the intellectual heir of
the late Carl Sagan, has recently published a
collection of essays and interviews, entitled
"Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate
Frontier" (W. W. Norton, Feb. 2012). In a
style reminiscent of the bestselling "Surely
You're Joking, Mr. Feynman," "Space
Chronicles" discusses such varied topics as

the history and future of space exploration,
the state of science education in the United

States and the continued relevance of NASA
in today's political discourse.

The anthology presents a compelling case
for continued government investment in
NASA and a cautiously optimistic outlook on
human space exploration. Given the cancella
tion of the shuttle program and the increased
reliance on private enterprise to achieve even
suborbital spaceflight, such visionaries are ever
more crucial in keeping our dreams of the cos
mos alive; Tyson, in "Space Chronicles," proves
himself a formidable champion of the cause.
Tyson delivers lucid analysis on the moti
vations that drive exploration, namely war,

economic gain, and curiosity. This last, he
argues, is what makes the National Air and
Space Museum one of the most popular
tourist attractions in Washington, and brings
eager audiences to the American Museum of
Natural History —where he is director of the
Hayden Planetarium whenever an astro
naut is slated to lecture. The allure of the
great unknown, the final frontier, is more
powerful than that of any other natural phe
nomenon.

Such fascination, however, is not enough
when faced with the realities of budget con
straints and governmental turnover. His
anthology takes readers on a vivid journey

back to the days of the space race under
President Kennedy, when every Soviet techno-

logical success was seen as a blow to American
pride and a threat to national security; the

government spent millions on human space
flight, and science-fiction writers predicted
space colonies on Mars and beyond. He holds
out the possibility that with China and other
nations catching up to the United States, per
haps our Cold War-era competitive drive will
kick in to save NASA.

Tyson also tackles, quite ambitiously, the
problem of science and engineering education
in the United States. In the space race era,

astronauts were lauded as national heroes, and
shuttle launches were broadcast in every

school cafeteria, generating unprecedented
enthusiasm for engineering and the hard sci
ences among the nation's youth.
In a particularly farsighted line of argu
mentation, Tyson contends that the nation
needs, now more than ever, a similar symbol
of human scientific achievement—and that a
robust space program is the best way to fill the
gap. The cost to the nation a fraction of a
penny of every tax dollar is negligible com
pared to the military's annual budget, he
observes, and would produce greater returns
in terms of research and development on
related technologies. He cites a wide array of
inventions, ranging from biomedical to auto
motive technologies, that originated in NASA
research. Such cross-pollination between disci
plines, Tyson argues, is central to continued
American innovation. He writes, "For the U.S.

space program to die along with the crew of
the space shuttle Columbia because
nobody is willing to write the check to keep it
going would be to move backward just by
standing still."
"Space Chronicles" is an extremely liter
ate, timely and convincing defense of the value
of a particular American dream. Tyson argues
that it is in our nature to explore, to face that
final frontier with all the courage that our
ancestors marshaled in crossing the Atlantic,
and that the best investment our government
could make toward the future of our country,
and indeed the world, would be to fund the
manifestation of our hopes and dreams.
