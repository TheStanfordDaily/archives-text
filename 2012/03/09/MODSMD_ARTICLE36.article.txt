## ROXY SASS ROXY DOES POLITICS... OR MAYBE JUST POLITICIANS 
### 
Roxy's appreciation for pas
sion extends outside the
bedroom and onto the
campaign trail. While Roxy's best
Tuesdays usually involve shirtless
men and a respectable amount of
wine, this past Tuesday was sur
prisingly "super" for a day filled
with neither alcohol nor men Roxy
wanted to see naked.

Why, you might be wonder
ing, is Roxy so interested in pri
mary season? Like Roxy, the
Republican voters have demon
strated that they aren't interested in
monogamy; their inability to stick
with just one man reminds Roxy of
her typical weekend. And, of
course, Roxy loves a heated caucus.
As it turns out, politics are a great
way to get the bed Barack-ing all
night long.
If you're pursuing an intellec
tual, political type, the best way to
get blood flowing (to all their
organs) is with a well-timed com
ment about the latest Romney or
Santorum speech. Roxy can think
of at least one constructive outlet j
for the inevitable frustration her "
comment will bring on.
And while Roxy's idea of a
good party involves significantly
fewer senior citizens, the GOP's
stance on birth control has proven
surprisingly useful. "Want to stick
it to Rush? Let's have completely
protected sex right now." Though

there may be videos, Roxy certainly
won't be posting them online for
any grouchy Republican pundits.
Even with the politically
uninitiated, Roxy knows that the
right turn of phrase can be a total
turn on. "I'm definitely a fan of big

... government." "Did you hear
what Boner, ahem, Boehner said
today?" After Roxy drops a few
hints, most people will drop their
pants.

any Santorum jokes? Send her your
best ones at intermission@stanford
