### LINDSEY TXAKEEYANG 
"Most of us have dreamt as a kid
if we're being honest of finding a
mammoth," said anthropologist Timo
thy King 'O4 Ph.D. 'O6 to artichoke
farmers Ryan and Martin Jefferson on
stage at Cubberley Auditorium Thurs
day evening. "And what's wonderful is
that you guys did find it and you shared
it with all of us."
King is part of an extensive team
that has uncovered about 30 to 40 per
cent of a Columbian mammoth found
in Castroville, Calif., in Dec. 2010 by the
Jefferson brothers. The brothers dis
covered the fossil in the fields of their
farm after they found a strange rock
that Martin Jefferson said he recog
nized as a mammoth tooth.
Sponsored by Stanford Continuing
Studies, King and the Jeffersons came

to Stanford to present on "The Castro
ville Mammoth Project," along with
site director Daniel Cearley and proj
ect illustrator Joshua Ballze.
Martin Jefferson said that after dis
covering the tooth, he contacted a
friend working for the Natural Re
sources Conversation Service to begin
bringing in people who would know
what to do. It was his landlord's daugh
ter, however, who put him in touch with
California State Parks archaeologist
Mark Hylkema, who is the team proj
ect director. Hylkema then assembled
a team to form the Castroville Mam
moth Project.
The team consists of faculty and
staff from multiple schools, including
Stanford, Foothill College, Santa Clara
University, UCLA, UC-Santa Cruz,
