# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Mammoth discovery team discusses Castroville fossils 
### LINDSEY TXAKEEYANG 
"Most of us have dreamt as a kid
if we're being honest of finding a
mammoth," said anthropologist Timo
thy King 'O4 Ph.D. 'O6 to artichoke
farmers Ryan and Martin Jefferson on
stage at Cubberley Auditorium Thurs
day evening. "And what's wonderful is
that you guys did find it and you shared
it with all of us."
King is part of an extensive team
that has uncovered about 30 to 40 per
cent of a Columbian mammoth found
in Castroville, Calif., in Dec. 2010 by the
Jefferson brothers. The brothers dis
covered the fossil in the fields of their
farm after they found a strange rock
that Martin Jefferson said he recog
nized as a mammoth tooth.
Sponsored by Stanford Continuing
Studies, King and the Jeffersons came

to Stanford to present on "The Castro
ville Mammoth Project," along with
site director Daniel Cearley and proj
ect illustrator Joshua Ballze.
Martin Jefferson said that after dis
covering the tooth, he contacted a
friend working for the Natural Re
sources Conversation Service to begin
bringing in people who would know
what to do. It was his landlord's daugh
ter, however, who put him in touch with
California State Parks archaeologist
Mark Hylkema, who is the team proj
ect director. Hylkema then assembled
a team to form the Castroville Mam
moth Project.
The team consists of faculty and
staff from multiple schools, including
Stanford, Foothill College, Santa Clara
University, UCLA, UC-Santa Cruz,

Members of the Castroville Mammoth Project spoke about their experience excavating a mammoth
fossil that Martin and Ryan Jefferson discovered on their artichoke farm in December 2010.
Ohio University and others.
"This was a really good experi
ence and opportunity for our stu
dents," King said. "We said, 'Hey
listen, would you like to go on an
excavation for a number of
months? We can't pay you any
thing, but you get to come home
after the weekend and when
friends are like, "Oh, yeah, you
know, I saw a movie and I went to
the golf course, what did you do
this weekend?" it's like, "Yeah, I
dug up a mammoth.'""

The Castroville Mammoth
Project has no funding, however,
King said.
"We're not working on a grant
or anything," King said, "All of
this has been done pro bono. That
is, all of the labor is for free. We're
doing it because we believe in it."
A project of this size, however,
does run into some expenses,
King said. One such example
would be the radio-carbon dating
done on the uncovered bones.

King said that friends and col
leagues carried out the fossil dat
ing. The Jeffersons also made a few
donations. Other expenses came
out of team members' own pockets.
During his lecture, King dis
cussed the discovery of strands of
hair among the bones. He said
that if they turn out to be the hair

of the mammoth, they will be the
only known samples of
Columbian mammoth hair.
Ballze also said there are two
more known sites on the Jeffer
sons' 178-acre farm that are pro
ducing bones and fossils.
On stage. King brought up the
members of what he calls "the
most exclusive club in the Bay
Area," the Mammoth Hunter So
ciety. In addition to the Jefferson
brothers, Roger Castillo and lan
Butler, who have each discovered
a mammoth, represented mem
bers of the group.
In 2005, Castillo found a juve
nile Columbian mammoth along
the Guadalupe River that is now
on display in the Children's Dis
covery Museum of San Jose. But
ler is the most recent member of
the society, having found the re
mains of an adult Columbian
mammoth in Pacifica in fall 2011.

The members said they are ex
cited to be part of the club.
"Sometimes I wake up in the
morning and I think, 'Oh that was
a good dream,'" Castillo said.
"And then I realize that it really
happened."

"It makes me wish I could
change my daily job duties," Mar
tin Jefferson said about his fami
ly's artichoke fields potentially
holding more Ice Age animals.
"Looking for fossils instead of
looking at the fields."

in Castroville, Calif., in Dec. 2010 by the
Jefferson brothers. The brothers dis
covered the fossil in the fields of their
farm after they found a strange rock
that Martin Jefferson said he recog
nized as a mammoth tooth.
Sponsored by Stanford Continuing
Studies, King and the Jeffersons came

to Stanford to present on "The Castro
ville Mammoth Project," along with
site director Daniel Cearley and proj
ect illustrator Joshua Ballze.
Martin Jefferson said that after dis
covering the tooth, he contacted a
friend working for the Natural Re
sources Conversation Service to begin
bringing in people who would know
what to do. It was his landlord's daugh
ter, however, who put him in touch with
California State Parks archaeologist
Mark Hylkema, who is the team proj
ect director. Hylkema then assembled
a team to form the Castroville Mam
moth Project.
The team consists of faculty and
staff from multiple schools, including
Stanford, Foothill College, Santa Clara
University, UCLA, UC-Santa Cruz,

Members of the Castroville Mammoth Project spoke about their experience excavating a mammoth
fossil that Martin and Ryan Jefferson discovered on their artichoke farm in December 2010.
Ohio University and others.
"This was a really good experi
ence and opportunity for our stu
dents," King said. "We said, 'Hey
listen, would you like to go on an
excavation for a number of
months? We can't pay you any
thing, but you get to come home
after the weekend and when
friends are like, "Oh, yeah, you
know, I saw a movie and I went to
the golf course, what did you do
this weekend?" it's like, "Yeah, I
dug up a mammoth.'""

The Castroville Mammoth
Project has no funding, however,
King said.
"We're not working on a grant
or anything," King said, "All of
this has been done pro bono. That
is, all of the labor is for free. We're
doing it because we believe in it."
A project of this size, however,
does run into some expenses,
King said. One such example
would be the radio-carbon dating
done on the uncovered bones.

King said that friends and col
leagues carried out the fossil dat
ing. The Jeffersons also made a few
donations. Other expenses came
out of team members' own pockets.
During his lecture, King dis
cussed the discovery of strands of
hair among the bones. He said
that if they turn out to be the hair

of the mammoth, they will be the
only known samples of
Columbian mammoth hair.
Ballze also said there are two
more known sites on the Jeffer
sons' 178-acre farm that are pro
ducing bones and fossils.
On stage. King brought up the
members of what he calls "the
most exclusive club in the Bay
Area," the Mammoth Hunter So
ciety. In addition to the Jefferson
brothers, Roger Castillo and lan
Butler, who have each discovered
a mammoth, represented mem
bers of the group.
In 2005, Castillo found a juve
nile Columbian mammoth along
the Guadalupe River that is now
on display in the Children's Dis
covery Museum of San Jose. But
ler is the most recent member of
the society, having found the re
mains of an adult Columbian
mammoth in Pacifica in fall 2011.

The members said they are ex
cited to be part of the club.
"Sometimes I wake up in the
morning and I think, 'Oh that was
a good dream,'" Castillo said.
"And then I realize that it really
happened."

"It makes me wish I could
change my daily job duties," Mar
tin Jefferson said about his fami
ly's artichoke fields potentially
holding more Ice Age animals.
"Looking for fossils instead of
looking at the fields."
