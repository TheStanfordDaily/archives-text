## New eDorm to launch on West Campus ResEd, E2.0 collaborate to launch entrepreneurship-thmied dorm 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Marx House in Suites will become the
new entrepreneurship-themed
"eDorm" starting in the 2012-13 aca
demic year, as a result of collaboration
between E2.0 a student group fo
cused on providing help and services for
entrepreneurial students and Resi
dential Education (ResEd), along with
other administrators.
According to Res Ed's website, stu
dents living in the eDorm will form start
up teams, as well as attend seminars,
guest lectures and dinners with mentors.
According to Dean of Residential
Education Deborah Golder, ResEd typ
ically receives proposals for multiple
prospective dorm themes each year, but
decided to pursue the eDorm because of
its potential to reach all types of students.
"From any academic discipline, a stu
dent could say they have an idea, and
they want to explore it in the context of
eDorm," Golder said. "You don't have to
identify with a certain group. Literally
any upperclass student could express in
terest in this community of thinking and
learning together. The notion of entre
preneurialism is truly universal in the
Stanford context."
Logistics
Half of the 40 students in eDorm next
year will pre-assign into the house
through ResEd, and half will draw into
Marx individually or with a group.
"The pre-assigned students will be se
lected based on their entrepreneurial na
ture, their love for innovating and their
diverse skill sets and backgrounds that
they can bring to the community," said
Viraj Bindra 'l5, director of marketing
for E2.0. "Peter Thiel B.A. 'B9, J.D. '92
will be the faculty sponsor, and he'll
oversee selection."

According to Golder, Suites was cho
sen for the location of the new dorm
theme because students manage those
spaces, and the new themed dorm has a
goal of emphasizing student-initiated ac
tion.

"E2.0 is an organization on campus
with some incredible resources, and we
were trying to find one of the best ways
to channel these resources to create
maximum output at Stanford," Bindra
said. "What we identified as a chief mode
for us to give those resources to students
at Stanford was through a collaborative
effort like eDorm."

E2.0 and the eDorm
E2.0 was a branch of ASSU until it
separated in October, and had been
working on establishing an entrepre
neurship dorm prior to the split.
ResEd and E2.0 held meetings
with staff and University adminis
trators, including heads of Stu
dent Housing and President John
Hennessy, to shape and approve
the project.
In the past few months, E2.0
executive members Chase Har
mon 'l3, Stewart Macgregor-
Dennis 'l3 and Dan Thompson
'l3 met with advisers to revise
plans.

eDorm is one of a number of
projects that E2.0 is currently
working on. Other undertakings
include an eßesource Map to di
rect students to entrepreneurial
resources on- and off-campus and
Startup Bus, an effort to connect
with entrepreneurial students
across the nation.

The organization has received
some criticism about the level of
success and effectiveness that the
new themed dorm will have.

"This is a prototype of the con
cept of E2.0, and we're trying to
see how well it will work," Bindra
said. "We have eTracking in place,
which is our initiative to monitor
the success of all our initiatives,

including eDorm. We'll be track
ing it throughout the year and
making sure that it's successful
and we're getting the maximum
amount of utility out of our re
sources."
ResEd agreed with this exper
imentation-based philosophy.
"If we find out that this works,
we could create a model where we
start piloting different programs,
seeing if there's enough student
interest and creating a process
that allows some houses to
evolve," Golder said. "We want to
get some data and make decisions
based on that."
Response from Suites
Current Marx residents were
not notified of the change apart
from an update on the ResEd
website.
"The entrepreneurship theme
seems stimulating for people that
choose to follow that life path,"
said Michael Zoldos 'l2, club
manager of Beefeater's Eating
Club, where all Marx residents
eat. "Overall, I think it will be
something that positively benefits
those individuals that live there
and participate in the dorm activ
ities."

Morgan Priestley 'l2, CFO of
GovCo Dining, which manages
the four eating clubs in Suites,

does not expect any major
changes to eating club operations
but is slightly concerned about
the clash of cultures that eDorm
might have with the rest of Suites.
"As long as the program stays
within its bounds and doesn't
completely change the Suites en
vironment, doesn't completely
take things over, then I think it's
going to be great," Priestley said.
"We're a little apprehensive of
having them be at Suites mostly
because the culture doesn't seem
to fit, but I don't think it will be a
big issue. Suites is a very inde
pendent place as it is."
Not the first "eHouse"
eDorm will not be the first
housing option in Stanford's his
tory to have an entrepreneurship
focus. Naranja dorm in Lagunita
had a social-entrepreneurship
theme when it was a four-class
dorm, starting in the 2001-02 aca
demic year. Social entrepreneur
ship is a type of entrepreneurship
based on starting a business or or
ganization for the benefit of oth
ers.

Andrew Deagon 'O9 was the
theme focus assistant during
Naranja's last year with the social
entrepreneurship theme, in
charge of organizing guest speak
ers and informing students about
entrepreneurial events on cam
pus. Deagon described the
theme's success as "difficult" be
cause few students knew the
dorm was themed until they lived
there and only a handful of stu
dents were really dedicated to the
theme.

Resident Fellow Thomas
Massey was the driving force be
hind the dorm's entrepreneurial
focus, and after his passing in Jan.
2009, no one else took on his role.
Regarding eDorm, Deagon
said, "I think it has the potential to
be extremely successful if it's mar

keted to the right students because
there are a lot of great minds that
could gravitate toward that, but I
think that if the people that end up
in Marx are there by accident, then
it will be difficult to maintain."

Looking forward
E2.0 is currently working on a
marketing campaign to inform
students about the new housing

option.
"We are hoping by encouraging
this collaborative, creative atmos
phere, we will give a lot of people
the opportunity to create great
ideas and help others with theirs in
order to start something really re
markable," Bindra said.

"This is a prototype of the con
cept of E2.0, and we're trying to
see how well it will work," Bindra
said. "We have eTracking in place,
which is our initiative to monitor
the success of all our initiatives,

including eDorm. We'll be track
ing it throughout the year and
making sure that it's successful
and we're getting the maximum
amount of utility out of our re
sources."
ResEd agreed with this exper
imentation-based philosophy.
"If we find out that this works,
we could create a model where we
start piloting different programs,
seeing if there's enough student
interest and creating a process
that allows some houses to
evolve," Golder said. "We want to
get some data and make decisions
based on that."
Response from Suites
Current Marx residents were
not notified of the change apart
from an update on the ResEd
website.
"The entrepreneurship theme
seems stimulating for people that
choose to follow that life path,"
said Michael Zoldos 'l2, club
manager of Beefeater's Eating
Club, where all Marx residents
eat. "Overall, I think it will be
something that positively benefits
those individuals that live there
and participate in the dorm activ
ities."

Morgan Priestley 'l2, CFO of
GovCo Dining, which manages
the four eating clubs in Suites,

does not expect any major
changes to eating club operations
but is slightly concerned about
the clash of cultures that eDorm
might have with the rest of Suites.
"As long as the program stays
within its bounds and doesn't
completely change the Suites en
vironment, doesn't completely
take things over, then I think it's
going to be great," Priestley said.
"We're a little apprehensive of
having them be at Suites mostly
because the culture doesn't seem
to fit, but I don't think it will be a
big issue. Suites is a very inde
pendent place as it is."
Not the first "eHouse"
eDorm will not be the first
housing option in Stanford's his
tory to have an entrepreneurship
focus. Naranja dorm in Lagunita
had a social-entrepreneurship
theme when it was a four-class
dorm, starting in the 2001-02 aca
demic year. Social entrepreneur
ship is a type of entrepreneurship
based on starting a business or or
ganization for the benefit of oth
ers.

Andrew Deagon 'O9 was the
theme focus assistant during
Naranja's last year with the social
entrepreneurship theme, in
charge of organizing guest speak
ers and informing students about
entrepreneurial events on cam
pus. Deagon described the
theme's success as "difficult" be
cause few students knew the
dorm was themed until they lived
there and only a handful of stu
dents were really dedicated to the
theme.

Resident Fellow Thomas
Massey was the driving force be
hind the dorm's entrepreneurial
focus, and after his passing in Jan.
2009, no one else took on his role.
Regarding eDorm, Deagon
said, "I think it has the potential to
be extremely successful if it's mar

keted to the right students because
there are a lot of great minds that
could gravitate toward that, but I
think that if the people that end up
in Marx are there by accident, then
it will be difficult to maintain."

Looking forward
E2.0 is currently working on a
marketing campaign to inform
students about the new housing

option.
"We are hoping by encouraging
this collaborative, creative atmos
phere, we will give a lot of people
the opportunity to create great
ideas and help others with theirs in
order to start something really re
markable," Bindra said.

Marx House in Suites will become the
new entrepreneurship-themed
"eDorm" starting in the 2012-13 aca
demic year, as a result of collaboration
between E2.0 a student group fo
cused on providing help and services for
entrepreneurial students and Resi
dential Education (ResEd), along with
other administrators.
According to Res Ed's website, stu
dents living in the eDorm will form start
up teams, as well as attend seminars,
guest lectures and dinners with mentors.
According to Dean of Residential
Education Deborah Golder, ResEd typ
ically receives proposals for multiple
prospective dorm themes each year, but
decided to pursue the eDorm because of
its potential to reach all types of students.
"From any academic discipline, a stu
dent could say they have an idea, and
they want to explore it in the context of
eDorm," Golder said. "You don't have to
identify with a certain group. Literally
any upperclass student could express in
terest in this community of thinking and
learning together. The notion of entre
preneurialism is truly universal in the
Stanford context."
Logistics
Half of the 40 students in eDorm next
year will pre-assign into the house
through ResEd, and half will draw into
Marx individually or with a group.
"The pre-assigned students will be se
lected based on their entrepreneurial na
ture, their love for innovating and their
diverse skill sets and backgrounds that
they can bring to the community," said
Viraj Bindra 'l5, director of marketing
for E2.0. "Peter Thiel B.A. 'B9, J.D. '92
will be the faculty sponsor, and he'll
oversee selection."

According to Golder, Suites was cho
sen for the location of the new dorm
theme because students manage those
spaces, and the new themed dorm has a
goal of emphasizing student-initiated ac
tion.

"E2.0 is an organization on campus
with some incredible resources, and we
were trying to find one of the best ways
to channel these resources to create
maximum output at Stanford," Bindra
said. "What we identified as a chief mode
for us to give those resources to students
at Stanford was through a collaborative
effort like eDorm."

E2.0 and the eDorm
E2.0 was a branch of ASSU until it
separated in October, and had been
working on establishing an entrepre
neurship dorm prior to the split.
ResEd and E2.0 held meetings
with staff and University adminis
trators, including heads of Stu
dent Housing and President John
Hennessy, to shape and approve
the project.
In the past few months, E2.0
executive members Chase Har
mon 'l3, Stewart Macgregor-
Dennis 'l3 and Dan Thompson
'l3 met with advisers to revise
plans.

eDorm is one of a number of
projects that E2.0 is currently
working on. Other undertakings
include an eßesource Map to di
rect students to entrepreneurial
resources on- and off-campus and
Startup Bus, an effort to connect
with entrepreneurial students
across the nation.

The organization has received
some criticism about the level of
success and effectiveness that the
new themed dorm will have.

"This is a prototype of the con
cept of E2.0, and we're trying to
see how well it will work," Bindra
said. "We have eTracking in place,
