## New eDorm to launch on West Campus ResEd, E2.0 collaborate to launch entrepreneurship-thmied dorm 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Marx House in Suites will become the
new entrepreneurship-themed
"eDorm" starting in the 2012-13 aca
demic year, as a result of collaboration
between E2.0 a student group fo
cused on providing help and services for
entrepreneurial students and Resi
dential Education (ResEd), along with
other administrators.
According to Res Ed's website, stu
dents living in the eDorm will form start
up teams, as well as attend seminars,
guest lectures and dinners with mentors.
According to Dean of Residential
Education Deborah Golder, ResEd typ
ically receives proposals for multiple
prospective dorm themes each year, but
decided to pursue the eDorm because of
its potential to reach all types of students.
"From any academic discipline, a stu
dent could say they have an idea, and
they want to explore it in the context of
eDorm," Golder said. "You don't have to
identify with a certain group. Literally
any upperclass student could express in
terest in this community of thinking and
learning together. The notion of entre
preneurialism is truly universal in the
Stanford context."

Half of the 40 students in eDorm next
year will pre-assign into the house
through ResEd, and half will draw into
Marx individually or with a group.
"The pre-assigned students will be se
lected based on their entrepreneurial na
ture, their love for innovating and their
diverse skill sets and backgrounds that
they can bring to the community," said
Viraj Bindra 'l5, director of marketing
for E2.0. "Peter Thiel B.A. 'B9, J.D. '92
will be the faculty sponsor, and he'll
oversee selection."

According to Golder, Suites was cho
sen for the location of the new dorm
theme because students manage those
spaces, and the new themed dorm has a
goal of emphasizing student-initiated ac
tion.

"E2.0 is an organization on campus
with some incredible resources, and we
were trying to find one of the best ways
to channel these resources to create
maximum output at Stanford," Bindra
said. "What we identified as a chief mode
for us to give those resources to students
at Stanford was through a collaborative
effort like eDorm."

E2.0 and the eDorm
E2.0 was a branch of ASSU until it
separated in October, and had been
working on establishing an entrepre
neurship dorm prior to the split.
