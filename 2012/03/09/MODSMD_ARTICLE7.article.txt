### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DEPUTY EDITOR 
| James Mwaura and Charles Mbatia, both current jun
iors, are running because they haven't felt represented
by their student government lately.
""There's a feeling that a lot of these other slates
have been in the ASSU for quite some time, and one of
their main focuses is making the ASSU run more effi
ciently," Mwaura said. However according to Mwaura,
this focus causes the ASSU to lose sight of what they are
supposed to do provide students with a service.
"Our vision is very clear ... we want to provide the
best possible services and most unclouded dialogue,"
said Mwaura.
Mwaura is involved in several business-oriented stu
dent groups, such as the Business Association of Stan
ford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES), while Mbatia
serves as an officer for Intramural Sports, leadership ex
periences the pair says complement each other well.
Of all the candidates, Mwaura and Mbatia stressed
the importance of the ASSU representing the student
voice to the administration the most.
"While the ASSU might be good at running itself,
what they're there for to represent the students for
the administration they're failing in that respect."
They cited the Chi Theta Chi lease termination and
rising tuition prices as areas where they would engage
the University in conversation to represent student in
terest.
"A lot of times, you tend to wonder where your dol
lar is actually going," said Mwaura, referring to increas
es in tuition, bookstore prices and late night dining
prices.
The group brings several other new ideas as well
including end-of-quarter yard sales, improving non
techie career fairs and working with faculty to bring on
line lectures to humanities classes, which often lack that
option.

The race for ASSU Executive has begun, and a
number of slates have launched petitions on the
ASSU elections site. The Daily sat down with the
candidates to gain a better sense of what each slate
hopes to accomplish if elected.
