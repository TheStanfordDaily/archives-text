â–  "There's an inherent fallacy that the ASSU Exec can
revolutionize our Stanford experience by incorporating
changes into all these different facets of the administra
tion and student life," said Ben Hoffman 'l3, of the Fam
ily Matters slate.
Hoffman, along with Julian Okuyiga 'l3, are unique
among the field this year because they propose no
major changes for the way the ASSU currently oper
ates. They largely want to keep the status quo, except for
one, huge initiative:
Bring back Lake Lagunita.
The pair doesn't want to destroy the ASSU they
(somewhat uncaringly) say they would appoint quali
fied and experienced cabinet officials, and maintain the
ASSU's role as a liaison between student groups and
the University. They just have a different focus.
"We'd put forth efforts to bring experienced people
in as Cabinet officers, draw on that insight, but that
won't be our biggest problem," Okuyiga said.
It may be a long shot, but both Hoffman and Okuyi
ga have given the problem of Lake Lag some thought.
They've identified four main issues: the tiger salaman
der, water usage, restoration of a derelict dam and liabil
ity issues. The solutions aren't fully formed yet the
slate suggested species relocation may solve the tiger
salamander problem and requiring students to learn to
swim like other colleges may solve the liability issues
however the pair believes that with alumni support,
bringing back the Lake is an achievable goal.
-"It would bring a whole new aspect to Stanford life
in general," Hoffman said, recalling how alumni he has
talked to recall their time around Lake Lag very fondly.
The pair even noted that a place for Stanford stu
dents to chill, relax and unwind may improve mental
health on campus. Or, as Hoffman put it, "Solving the
Stanford duck syndrome with a lake."
