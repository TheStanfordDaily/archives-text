# ZIMBROFF – WAGSTAFF Robbie Zimbroff and William Wagstaff

■ Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 and William Wagstaff 'l2 are
ASSU outsiders, but the two Ujamaa Resident Assis
tants and future co-terms believe this offers them a
fresh opportunity to "reconnect" the ASSU with the
student body.
While both have a track record and future plan fo
cusing on promoting diversity on campus, their cam
paign isn't so simple the pair also wants to bring con
crete changes to what they termed "student problems."
"People with ASSU experience have already shown
they fall into the same cycle of jargon and a big election
cycle, where you promise big things, but they don't actu
alize in away that people want," Zimbroff said.
Talking with each other and other students about
simple problems, such as a perceived lack of late-night
dining options and poor quality of Vaden Health Cen
ter, the pair said they began to discuss the things they
would do if in charge. Then they thought, "Why not us?"
"The ASSU is disconnected [from students]," Zim
broff said. "If we re-focus on what people are talking
about, that could be a really positive thing."
The pair also identified a problem of scope. By nar
rowing the focus of the ASSU to these "student prob
lems", the duo hopes to improve the efficiency of the
ASSU.
"We're not going to be able to promise every single
person every single thing that they want," Zimbroff
said. "All we want to do is to help people and take action
toward those goals in concrete ways."
