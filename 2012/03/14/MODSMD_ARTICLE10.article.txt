## Two student teams travel to Startup Bus Stanford fields first college teams in Texas entrepreneurship competition 
### ALLY ARRI ETA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A group of aspiring entrepreneurs rep
resented Stanford this past week in the
third annual Startupßus competition.
Working in two teams, the students had 74
hours to brainstorm, develop and launch
a start-up while traveling by bus from
Stanford to Austin, Texas, before present
ing their concepts to a professional panel
at the SXSW Interactive Conference.

"The basic premise is to see how peo
ple stretch and push themselves with con
strained resources," said Chase Harmon
'l3, CEO of E2.0, a student entrepreneur
ship group. "So what is done in three
years in some cases will be done in three

days."
One hundred teams from across the
United States and Mexico participated in
the competition, pioneering ideas in con
strained settings and under severe time
pressure. The teams from Stanford or
ganized by E2.0 and sponsored by Mi
crosoft were the first entirely colle
giate teams to enter the competition, with
both able to secure corporate deals by the
end of the weekend.

"We're all about entrepreneurship and
getting the juices flowing mentally and
creatively, so we thought that this would
be a great outlet for us," said Viraj Bindra
'l5, E2.o's director of marketing. "Twitter
and Foursquare launched there [at
SXSW], so it's a great basis for amazing
ideas to take shape and gain traction."
E2.0 was only accepted into the com
petition five days before the departure
date. David Hornick partner at August

Capital and a member of the E2.0 board
of advisors helped put Harmon in
touch with executives at Microsoft to se
cure a last-minute sponsorship.
"Basically we called up Microsoft at 11
a.m. on Wednesday, and they really pulled
in last minute, so we need to thank them
for making all this possible," Harmon
said.
E2.0 then worked quickly to distribute
applications across the Stanford campus
and to locate a bus with the amenities
necessary for the competition, such as Wi-
Fi. Harmon said E2.0 searched for a
group of students representing a "nice, di
verse spread between hustlers, designers
and coders."
Leaving Stanford at 7 a.m. on Tuesday,
March 6, the group pitched ideas and
formed teams in Palm Springs before
working on their start-ups
throughout the remainder of the
journey. Before arriving in
Austin late Friday afternoon, the
teams faced challenges includ
ing delays posed by a dust storm
and unreliable Internet access.
"In a three-day span, my
team and I worked for 60 hours.
By the end of it, all of us were a
little delirious and saying the
most ridiculous things," said
Herry Lian 'l2, one of the "bus
preneurs." "The most rewarding
part of that is when a venture
capitalist praises you for a good
pitch, which made pushing our
selves that hard worth it."
Jesse Clayburgh 'l3, Jesus
Salas 'l2 and Song Zheng, a
UCLA alumnus who works for
Tokbox, collaborated to form
Txtßoo, a review system service
for people without smartphone
access. Noting that users of sim
ple phones which often lack
Internet access outnumber
smartphone users five to one,
the team decided to pioneer a
service allowing users to receive
and write reviews through stan
dard text messaging services.
Lian, Dan Tran 'O6 and
George Burgess 'l5, co-COO of
E2.0, pioneered Gourmair, a site
that consolidates top online
food-delivery services. Ac
knowledging that consumers
face many such services to
choose between, the team aimed
to make ordering food online
more convenient and reliable.
The teams used Elance.com
an online employment plat
form and one of the team's
sponsors to hire engineering
help to construct wireframes,
landing pages and computer

servers.
"They provided us with sev
eral contractors to help us ac
complish our goals," Clayburgh
said. "On the Startupßus, things
that would usually take two
weeks to do took two hours or
sometimes even two minutes."
On Saturday, the teams pre
sented their start-ups to a panel
including technology journal
ists, venture capitalists and
start-up accelerator representa
tives. Both teams advanced to
the semifinals.
"Most people are profession
als, so it is definitely an honor
for us to be here, and it was a re
lief for us to be passed to the
next round," Harmon said.
Both of the Stanford start
ups began to attract corporate
customers interested in using
their technologies early in the
competition. Txtßoo succeeded
in creating a prototype and se
curing deals with a large num
ber of restaurants, while Gour
mair which signed deals with
food suppliers from around the
country was one of six teams
that advanced to the final
round.
On Sunday evening, the E2.0
contingent began its trip back to
campus, satisfied with a success
ful first Startupßus run. Many of
the participants emphasized
their interest in continuing to
develop their start-ups after the
competition.
"All in all, I think most every
one had a great time, and we
built really strong relation
ships," Clayburgh said. "You get
to know someone very, very well
after spending that kind of time
together in such an intense envi
ronment. No doubt, this has
been one of the coolest things
I've done."

Both of the Stanford start
ups began to attract corporate
customers interested in using
their technologies early in the
competition. Txtßoo succeeded
in creating a prototype and se
curing deals with a large num

mair which signed deals with
food suppliers from around the
country was one of six teams
that advanced to the final
round.
On Sunday evening, the E2.0
contingent began its trip back to
campus, satisfied with a success
ful first Startupßus run. Many of
the participants emphasized
their interest in continuing to
develop their start-ups after the
competition.
"All in all, I think most every
one had a great time, and we
built really strong relation
ships," Clayburgh said. "You get
to know someone very, very well
after spending that kind of time
together in such an intense envi
ronment. No doubt, this has
been one of the coolest things
I've done."

A group of aspiring entrepreneurs rep
resented Stanford this past week in the
third annual Startupßus competition.
Working in two teams, the students had 74
hours to brainstorm, develop and launch
a start-up while traveling by bus from
Stanford to Austin, Texas, before present
ing their concepts to a professional panel
at the SXSW Interactive Conference.

"The basic premise is to see how peo
ple stretch and push themselves with con
strained resources," said Chase Harmon
'l3, CEO of E2.0, a student entrepreneur
ship group. "So what is done in three
years in some cases will be done in three

days."
One hundred teams from across the
United States and Mexico participated in
the competition, pioneering ideas in con
strained settings and under severe time
pressure. The teams from Stanford or
ganized by E2.0 and sponsored by Mi
crosoft were the first entirely colle
giate teams to enter the competition, with
both able to secure corporate deals by the
end of the weekend.

"We're all about entrepreneurship and
getting the juices flowing mentally and
creatively, so we thought that this would
be a great outlet for us," said Viraj Bindra
'l5, E2.o's director of marketing. "Twitter
and Foursquare launched there [at
SXSW], so it's a great basis for amazing
ideas to take shape and gain traction."
E2.0 was only accepted into the com
petition five days before the departure
date. David Hornick partner at August

Capital and a member of the E2.0 board
of advisors helped put Harmon in
touch with executives at Microsoft to se
cure a last-minute sponsorship.
"Basically we called up Microsoft at 11
a.m. on Wednesday, and they really pulled
in last minute, so we need to thank them
for making all this possible," Harmon
said.
E2.0 then worked quickly to distribute
applications across the Stanford campus
and to locate a bus with the amenities
necessary for the competition, such as Wi-
Fi. Harmon said E2.0 searched for a
group of students representing a "nice, di
verse spread between hustlers, designers
and coders."
Leaving Stanford at 7 a.m. on Tuesday,
March 6, the group pitched ideas and
formed teams in Palm Springs before
working on their start-ups
throughout the remainder of the
journey. Before arriving in
Austin late Friday afternoon, the
teams faced challenges includ
ing delays posed by a dust storm
and unreliable Internet access.
"In a three-day span, my
team and I worked for 60 hours.
By the end of it, all of us were a
little delirious and saying the
most ridiculous things," said
Herry Lian 'l2, one of the "bus
preneurs." "The most rewarding
part of that is when a venture
capitalist praises you for a good
pitch, which made pushing our
selves that hard worth it."
Jesse Clayburgh 'l3, Jesus
Salas 'l2 and Song Zheng, a
UCLA alumnus who works for
Tokbox, collaborated to form
Txtßoo, a review system service
for people without smartphone
access. Noting that users of sim
ple phones which often lack
Internet access outnumber
smartphone users five to one,
the team decided to pioneer a
service allowing users to receive
and write reviews through stan
dard text messaging services.
Lian, Dan Tran 'O6 and
George Burgess 'l5, co-COO of
E2.0, pioneered Gourmair, a site
that consolidates top online
food-delivery services. Ac
knowledging that consumers
face many such services to
choose between, the team aimed
to make ordering food online
more convenient and reliable.
The teams used Elance.com
an online employment plat
form and one of the team's
sponsors to hire engineering
help to construct wireframes,
landing pages and computer

servers.
"They provided us with sev
eral contractors to help us ac
complish our goals," Clayburgh
said. "On the Startupßus, things
that would usually take two
weeks to do took two hours or
sometimes even two minutes."
On Saturday, the teams pre
sented their start-ups to a panel
including technology journal
ists, venture capitalists and
start-up accelerator representa
tives. Both teams advanced to
the semifinals.
"Most people are profession
als, so it is definitely an honor
for us to be here, and it was a re
lief for us to be passed to the
next round," Harmon said.
