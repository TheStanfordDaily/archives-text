## Two student teams travel to Startup Bus Stanford fields first college teams in Texas entrepreneurship competition 
### ALLY ARRI ETA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A group of aspiring entrepreneurs rep
resented Stanford this past week in the
third annual Startup√üus competition.
Working in two teams, the students had 74
hours to brainstorm, develop and launch
a start-up while traveling by bus from
Stanford to Austin, Texas, before present
ing their concepts to a professional panel
at the SXSW Interactive Conference.

"The basic premise is to see how peo
ple stretch and push themselves with con
strained resources," said Chase Harmon
'l3, CEO of E2.0, a student entrepreneur
ship group. "So what is done in three
years in some cases will be done in three

days."
One hundred teams from across the
United States and Mexico participated in
the competition, pioneering ideas in con
strained settings and under severe time
pressure. The teams from Stanford or
ganized by E2.0 and sponsored by Mi
crosoft were the first entirely colle
giate teams to enter the competition, with
both able to secure corporate deals by the
end of the weekend.

"We're all about entrepreneurship and
getting the juices flowing mentally and
creatively, so we thought that this would
be a great outlet for us," said Viraj Bindra
'l5, E2.o's director of marketing. "Twitter
and Foursquare launched there [at
SXSW], so it's a great basis for amazing
ideas to take shape and gain traction."
E2.0 was only accepted into the com
petition five days before the departure
date. David Hornick partner at August

Capital and a member of the E2.0 board
of advisors helped put Harmon in
touch with executives at Microsoft to se
cure a last-minute sponsorship.
"Basically we called up Microsoft at 11
a.m. on Wednesday, and they really pulled
in last minute, so we need to thank them
for making all this possible," Harmon
said.
E2.0 then worked quickly to distribute
applications across the Stanford campus
and to locate a bus with the amenities
necessary for the competition, such as Wi-
Fi. Harmon said E2.0 searched for a
group of students representing a "nice, di
verse spread between hustlers, designers
and coders."
Leaving Stanford at 7 a.m. on Tuesday,
March 6, the group pitched ideas and
formed teams in Palm Springs before
