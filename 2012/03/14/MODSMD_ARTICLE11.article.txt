## ResEd responds to Row House alcohol sales 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kristian Davis Bailey 
Residential Education (ResEd) dis
covered last week that some houses Row
have been selling alcohol to students dur
ing all-campus events, according to Assis
tant Director of Residential Education
Zac Sargeant. ResEd, which did not dis
close the names of houses charging stu
dents for alcohol, may partner with the
Office of Alcohol Policy and Education
(OAPE) and other administrative
groups at the beginning of next quarter
to address policy and regulations around
student events, houses and alcohol,
Sargeant said.
It is unclear whether the houses in
question sold alcohol to underage stu
dents.
"It has come to our attention that some
houses have been selling alcohol in addi
tion to food at all-campus events,"
Sargeant wrote in an email to Row house
managers on March 7. "The State of Cali
fornia and the University have regulations
on the sale of alcohol, and we are current
ly working with the Office of Alcohol Ed
ucation to make our alcohol sale policy
more clear. For now we ask that no house
sell alcohol to students regardless of their
age. We will have more information soon."
According to California state law, no
person or entity is allowed to sell alcohol
without a license.
Sargeant wrote in an email to The Daily
that the circumstances require clarifica
tion about University alcohol policies.
"Clearly this situation raises serious
questions about our current process of
party registration, regulation of house
funds and proper venues for student
groups hosting events," Sargeant said.
Sargeant added that ResEd and the
OAPE may form a working group at the
beginning of spring quarter to explore al
cohol sales within the undergraduate com
munity.
"This working group will likely be com
prised of University Administrators repre
senting various offices, and students repre
senting various parts of campus," Sargeant
said. "We hope to identify options that can
be put forth as a set of recommendations
to the University with the goal of meeting
student needs while protecting the safety
of all involved. In the interim, we are ask
ing all of our student staff to make sure
that they comply with both State and Fed
eral laws, as well as University policies."
