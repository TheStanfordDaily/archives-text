## PLANTING HER ROOTS Q&A with Stanford's new Tree 
### â€“ Molly Vorwerck 
For the first time in seven years, a
female student was chosen as
Stanford University's unofficial
mascot, the Tree, after the annual
Tree Week shenanigans. Nicoletta
von Heidegger 'l3 is a longtime member of

the drum section of the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB), a competitive equestri
an, staff activities coordinator at the
Sexual Health Peer Resource Cen- I
ter, a peer counselor at The Bridge
Peer Counseling Center, a Synergy

resident, a psychology major and, rather fit
tingly, a lover of trees her favorite is the
oak, an image of which is tattooed on the in
side of her wrist. For von Heidegger, being
the Tree is both an honor and a chance to
reinvent Stanford's arboreal mainstay. The
Daily sat down with von Heidegger to chat
about Tree Week and her plans for the fu
ture of our school's eccentric mascot:

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why did you
decide to audition for the role of the Tree?
Nicoletta von Heidegger (NH): I've been in
the LSJUMB since freshman year, and I
obviously love the Band. I wanted to give
back and do something in that realm ...
There hasn't been a girl Tree in seven years,
and I felt that I was a good, strong female
type role model who would really enjoy
dancing and representing Stanford in away
that could be fun, but also be a good public
figure in the social media hopefully!

TSD: What plans do you have in terms of
designing the Tree's costume?
NH: There are all sorts of things you have to
look at when you're designing the Tree. You
want something that's ergonomic, light and
nice to dance in, but you also want some
thing that looks good on camera and looks
big enough from high up. I also want to add
some feminine aspect to the Tree like a
giant red tutu.

TSD: What was the process of Tree Week
like?

NH: Well, it's basically just kind of a do-as
you wish sort of week, within reasonable
limits ... For my introduction stunt, I rode
in on horseback. Because I ride horses com
petitively, I rode into the Band Shack on a
friend's horse, with chaps on and a long
wig and a cowboy hat, with some-

one following me [carrying v
speakers playing] the

"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" sound
track. We [also] recreated a giant seesaw. It
was 20-feet long, and it goes 13-feet high. A
former senator of Wisconsin [Russell Fein-

gold, distinguished
visitor at the Haas
Center for Public
Service] and his
friend . . . hap- C
pened to walk

by, and [the friend] tried it out. Also, my
Band nickname is Pac Man, so we did a
giant game of Pac Man starting in the Circle
of Death, running in between tour groups
and bicycles, and made our way through
Tresidder and The Axe and Palm during
lunch, which was pretty busy. I also did a KY
wrestling event at Sigma Nu, and it happened
to coincide with Parents' Weekend, which
was not ideal, but some of my friends brought
their parents, and they thought it was fun.

TSD: Other than playing drums in the Band
and being the Tree, are you involved in any
other activities at Stanford?

NH: It was a big decision to become the Tree
because I'm very involved in a lot of other
things on campus, so I'm definitely going to
have to cut back on a lot of those things for
my senior year, which is kind of bittersweet
... I'm super busy as it is, but now I'm going
to be busy mostly doing Tree things instead.

TSD: Was there a formal process involved
when you were named the Tree?

NH: When you are announced [as the new
Tree], the entire Band comes to your house
to roll you out. So at 2:30 a.m. you hear the
whistle blowing downstairs, and then the
entire Band, however many people show up
at that early in the morning ... were all
playing. It was the best moment of my life.
They had some of the old Trees there, and
they carried me down the stairs we were
dancing on the tables, they were playing
songs for me and I was hugging all of my
friends in Band. It was like a blur of time just
because it was so exciting.

TSD: You're the first female Tree in seven
years. Do you think that the role of the Tree
is affected by gender?

NH: I suppose I consider myself a bit of a
feminist, but at the same time I also consid
er myself a tomboy in some ways. Going
into it, I definitely was assertive in terms of
my femininity just because there hadn't
been a female tree in so long, but I also want
to be seen as an awesome Tree who happens
to be female. That being said, [I am] the first
girl [Tree] in a long time, and I would like
that to be a more commonplace thing. I'd
like to make my Tree sort of represent
something more feminine, like I said, with
the tutu or ... Rhinestones, but who says
that couldn't be a guy's thing, too, if he wants
it to be? In terms of [the reputation of the
Tree as the most active kisser at] FMOTQ
[Full Moon on the Quad], I think a girl set
the Tree record, so I don't have any con
cerns about that.

that to be a more commonplace thing. I'd
like to make my Tree sort of represent
something more feminine, like I said, with
the tutu or ... Rhinestones, but who says
that couldn't be a guy's thing, too, if he wants
it to be? In terms of [the reputation of the
Tree as the most active kisser at] FMOTQ
[Full Moon on the Quad], I think a girl set
the Tree record, so I don't have any con
cerns about that.

For the first time in seven years, a
female student was chosen as
Stanford University's unofficial
mascot, the Tree, after the annual
Tree Week shenanigans. Nicoletta
von Heidegger 'l3 is a longtime member of

the drum section of the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB), a competitive equestri
an, staff activities coordinator at the
Sexual Health Peer Resource Cen- I
ter, a peer counselor at The Bridge
Peer Counseling Center, a Synergy

resident, a psychology major and, rather fit
tingly, a lover of trees her favorite is the
oak, an image of which is tattooed on the in
side of her wrist. For von Heidegger, being
the Tree is both an honor and a chance to
reinvent Stanford's arboreal mainstay. The
Daily sat down with von Heidegger to chat
about Tree Week and her plans for the fu
ture of our school's eccentric mascot:

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why did you
decide to audition for the role of the Tree?
Nicoletta von Heidegger (NH): I've been in
the LSJUMB since freshman year, and I
obviously love the Band. I wanted to give
back and do something in that realm ...
There hasn't been a girl Tree in seven years,
and I felt that I was a good, strong female
type role model who would really enjoy
dancing and representing Stanford in away
that could be fun, but also be a good public
figure in the social media hopefully!

TSD: What plans do you have in terms of
designing the Tree's costume?
NH: There are all sorts of things you have to
look at when you're designing the Tree. You
want something that's ergonomic, light and
nice to dance in, but you also want some
thing that looks good on camera and looks
big enough from high up. I also want to add
some feminine aspect to the Tree like a
giant red tutu.

TSD: What was the process of Tree Week
like?

NH: Well, it's basically just kind of a do-as
you wish sort of week, within reasonable
limits ... For my introduction stunt, I rode
in on horseback. Because I ride horses com
petitively, I rode into the Band Shack on a
friend's horse, with chaps on and a long
wig and a cowboy hat, with some-

one following me [carrying v
speakers playing] the

"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" sound
track. We [also] recreated a giant seesaw. It
was 20-feet long, and it goes 13-feet high. A
former senator of Wisconsin [Russell Fein-

gold, distinguished
visitor at the Haas
Center for Public
Service] and his
friend . . . hap- C
pened to walk

by, and [the friend] tried it out. Also, my
Band nickname is Pac Man, so we did a
giant game of Pac Man starting in the Circle
of Death, running in between tour groups
and bicycles, and made our way through
Tresidder and The Axe and Palm during
lunch, which was pretty busy. I also did a KY
wrestling event at Sigma Nu, and it happened
to coincide with Parents' Weekend, which
was not ideal, but some of my friends brought
their parents, and they thought it was fun.

TSD: Other than playing drums in the Band
and being the Tree, are you involved in any
other activities at Stanford?

NH: It was a big decision to become the Tree
because I'm very involved in a lot of other
things on campus, so I'm definitely going to
have to cut back on a lot of those things for
my senior year, which is kind of bittersweet
... I'm super busy as it is, but now I'm going
to be busy mostly doing Tree things instead.

TSD: Was there a formal process involved
when you were named the Tree?

NH: When you are announced [as the new
Tree], the entire Band comes to your house
to roll you out. So at 2:30 a.m. you hear the
whistle blowing downstairs, and then the
entire Band, however many people show up
at that early in the morning ... were all
playing. It was the best moment of my life.
They had some of the old Trees there, and
they carried me down the stairs we were
dancing on the tables, they were playing
songs for me and I was hugging all of my
friends in Band. It was like a blur of time just
because it was so exciting.

TSD: You're the first female Tree in seven
years. Do you think that the role of the Tree
is affected by gender?

NH: I suppose I consider myself a bit of a
feminist, but at the same time I also consid
er myself a tomboy in some ways. Going
into it, I definitely was assertive in terms of
my femininity just because there hadn't
been a female tree in so long, but I also want
to be seen as an awesome Tree who happens
to be female. That being said, [I am] the first
girl [Tree] in a long time, and I would like
that to be a more commonplace thing. I'd
like to make my Tree sort of represent
