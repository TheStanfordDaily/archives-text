# Constructing change
## 
### ALYA NAQVI 
The day began at 7:15 a.m., when I
grudgingly got out of my bed and
threw on the crummiest clothes I
could find. I met the rest of the vol
unteers for the March 3 Habitat for
Humanity Build outside of Tresidder Union.
Our tired faces lit up when we saw the bag of
bagels that was provided for us the day
seemed to be off to a good start.
The Daly City project we would work on
that day was the largest ever for Habitat for
Humanity Greater San Francisco. The final re
sult would be a four-story condominium devel
opment projected to house 36 families.
We reached the construction site at around
8:30 a.m. There were males and females of all
ages and ethnicities lined up in front of the tool
shed to sign waivers. Of course, by the time it
was my turn, they had run out of waivers. I re
membered what Keren Mikva 'l2, co-president
of Stanford's Habitat for Humanity chapter,
had said about the number of volunteers today
being "unheard of."
I stood awkwardly in my oversized con
struction hat and mismatched pair of gloves,
shivering in the morning breeze and unsure of
what to do next, until Dawn Adams, the charis
matic construction manager on the site, asked
for everyone's attention. Her eyes twinkled
from behind circular glasses and her bright red
hair was tied into playful pigtails, but her ener
getic voice was firm and no-nonsense. She
talked briefly about Habitat's general mission
and the manner in which the organization op
erates.
Families that qualify for Habitat typically
make 40 to 60 percent of the area's median in
come and often live in very crowded spaces or
spend exorbitant portions of their income on
housing expenses, she said. Habitat keeps
homes affordable by implementing zero-inter
est mortgage payments and calculating the du
ration of the mortgage based on how much
each family can afford to pay. For their part,
families must commit to an initial down pay
ment of 500 hours of "sweat equity," meaning
that they physically work on Habitat's project
alongside volunteers.
"I think that's probably the coolest part of
the program," Mikva said. "Their slogan is a
'hand-up,' not a 'hand-out.'"
Dawn concluded her talk by emphasizing
how integral volunteers are to Habitat's proj
ects.
"Ninety percent of the work done in build
ing Habitat homes is done by volunteers like
you guys," she said. "There's no carpenters
waiting in the wings to come finish things off.
We want to acknowledge and appreciate that."
Next, Ryan Poling, a Habitat employee
from Atlanta, Gaâ€ž gave us a safety briefing.
"The first thing that we say about safety out
here is that safety is a personal concern," he said.
"This is an active construction site; things are
changing all the time. You all need
to be looking out for yourselves."
After he had finished, it was
time for us to choose a crew to join.
As I was considering which
crew I wanted to be on, I thought
about what Frank Guzman 'l4, the
Stanford Habitat chapter's educa
tion and advocacy coordinator,
had said to me earlier:
"I think it's really nice that the
level of physical fitness for anyone
who goes on one of these builds
doesn't matter," he said. "There
are crews that do a lot of light
work that anyone can do, and then
there are crews that require you
not to be afraid of heights or to do
some heavy lifting."
Not trusting myself in any situ
ation that would involve ham
mers, nails or heavy objects, I ap
preciated the variety of options of
fered. I decided to go with the inte
rior painting crew of which Pol
ing was the team leader along
with around five other volunteers
from Stanford. One of these vol
unteers was Sean Scott 'l5, who
will be the build coordinator for
Stanford's chapter next year. Scott
was driven to get involved with
Habitat because of its physical as
pect.

"I like building things," he said.
"I like physical work."
Poling showed us the different
tools we would need and ex
plained the cutting, scraping and
rolling techniques that we would
use. As we began to paint, I real
ized it was harder than it seemed.
First, cutting is painfully boring.
Second, those long, wooden roller
extensions may look like fun, but
my neighbor whom I nearly
whacked in the face twice may
not agree. On top of that, every

time I tilted my head back to get a
better look at the ceiling, my hel
met and goggles which I wore
over my glasses slid back, and I
would have to adjust them with
my paint-smeared gloves. By
noon, when we had lunch break, I
had somehow managed to get
more paint on my clothes, my hair
and my shoes than everyone else
combined and quite possibly,
more than on the wall. I must
admit though, I felt a strange
sense of pride and satisfaction as
1 walked into the Subway across
the street splattered in white
paint.
After lunch, I talked to Poling
about his experience with Habitat.
"What I like most about the dy
namic of Habitat is that you get to
work side by side with the benefici
aries of your work," he said. "You
get a really nice, close connection."
He also discussed how Habi
tat's project goes beyond just em
powering individual families and
relates to larger social issues.
"One of the ways we've been
dealing with the foreclosure crisis
is buying abandoned homes from
banks and then fixing them," Pol
ing said. "That puts our families in
homes and improves entire neigh
borhoods."
Poling has been working with
Habitat for Humanity through
AmeriCorps for a year and a half.
He has a degree in construction
and management.
By 3 p.m., around an hour be
fore we called it a day, three other
Stanford students and I had fin
ished painting just one room in one
condominium. Thinking about
how long it took us to complete the
task in light of all the other rooms
that still needed to be painted was

overwhelming. And that was only
one small part of all the tasks wait
ing to be completed. For the first
time, I got an idea of how much can
be accomplished in two years,
mostly because of inexperienced
volunteers like me.
"I looked back at what we did,
and I felt a sense of pride because I
could see my volunteering efforts,"
Guzman had said earlier. "They
were tangible."
I felt the same way.

Volunteers at the Daly City build, the largest ever for Habitat for Humanity Greater San Francisco, worked to
construct a four-story condominium development projected to house 36 families. Habitat estimates that
volunteers will provide 90 percent of the labor, or 120,000 hours of work, until the project is completed.
