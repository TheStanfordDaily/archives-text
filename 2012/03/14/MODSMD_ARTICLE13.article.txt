# Constructing change

### ALYA NAQVI 
The day began at 7:15 a.m., when I
grudgingly got out of my bed and
threw on the crummiest clothes I
could find. I met the rest of the vol
unteers for the March 3 Habitat for
Humanity Build outside of Tresidder Union.
Our tired faces lit up when we saw the bag of
bagels that was provided for us the day
seemed to be off to a good start.
The Daly City project we would work on
that day was the largest ever for Habitat for
Humanity Greater San Francisco. The final re
sult would be a four-story condominium devel
opment projected to house 36 families.
We reached the construction site at around
8:30 a.m. There were males and females of all
ages and ethnicities lined up in front of the tool
shed to sign waivers. Of course, by the time it
was my turn, they had run out of waivers. I re
membered what Keren Mikva 'l2, co-president
of Stanford's Habitat for Humanity chapter,
had said about the number of volunteers today
being "unheard of."
I stood awkwardly in my oversized con
struction hat and mismatched pair of gloves,
shivering in the morning breeze and unsure of
what to do next, until Dawn Adams, the charis
matic construction manager on the site, asked
for everyone's attention. Her eyes twinkled
from behind circular glasses and her bright red
hair was tied into playful pigtails, but her ener
getic voice was firm and no-nonsense. She
talked briefly about Habitat's general mission
and the manner in which the organization op
erates.
Families that qualify for Habitat typically
make 40 to 60 percent of the area's median in
come and often live in very crowded spaces or
spend exorbitant portions of their income on
housing expenses, she said. Habitat keeps
homes affordable by implementing zero-inter
est mortgage payments and calculating the du
ration of the mortgage based on how much
each family can afford to pay. For their part,
families must commit to an initial down pay
ment of 500 hours of "sweat equity," meaning
that they physically work on Habitat's project
alongside volunteers.
"I think that's probably the coolest part of
the program," Mikva said. "Their slogan is a
'hand-up,' not a 'hand-out.'"
Dawn concluded her talk by emphasizing
how integral volunteers are to Habitat's proj
ects.
"Ninety percent of the work done in build
ing Habitat homes is done by volunteers like
you guys," she said. "There's no carpenters
waiting in the wings to come finish things off.
We want to acknowledge and appreciate that."
Next, Ryan Poling, a Habitat employee
from Atlanta, Gaâ€ž gave us a safety briefing.
"The first thing that we say about safety out
here is that safety is a personal concern," he said.
"This is an active construction site; things are
