# SHERIFF
## STANFORD She's the Bomb 
### â€“ Katie Leigh Kramon 
She approaches with the exuber
ance of a puppy, wagging her tail
so hard that her whole body
shakes, wearing an ear-to-ear
doggie grin. Dangling from her
collar is what Deputy Police Chief Adam
Cullen calls her "bling," an oversized
sheriffs badge that drags on the floor as
she heads out on missions.
Her name is Red, and she is the Stan
ford Police Department's trusty eight
year-old Labrador, charged with sniffing
out areas for explosives before big

events and the arrival of high-profile
campus visitors, from the Dalai Lama to
the president of Mexico. As she trots by
the desks of her co-workers in the Police
Department, they call out, "Red!"
Red is an anomaly at Stanford: a
school dropout. She was brought to the
Farm in Feb. 2007 after failing out of a
hunting dog class. The Department of
Flomeland Security had placed Stan
ford's new football stadium on its list of
likely Bay Area terrorist targets, and the
Stanford Department of Public Safety

became interested in purchasing a
"bomb dog." She now lives with Cullen
and his family, including "her little sis
ters," Cullen's five and seven-year-old
daughters.
Though the black Labrador's name
may seem arbitrary, she was dubbed
"Red" after a dog collar she wore as a
puppy. She trains once a week for four to
six hours, sniffing out fake bombs, which
she always finds with uncanny speed.
