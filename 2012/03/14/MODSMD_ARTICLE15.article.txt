## EDITORIAL The 						justification for affirmative action and its unforeseen effects 
### 
Affirmative action, and its
role in the American uni
versity system, has al
ways been a contentious issue.
With the Supreme Court granti
ng certiorari last month to Fisher
v. The University of Texas, affir
mative action is once again at the
front of the debate over higher
education. The case involves two
white applicants, both rejected
from the University of Texas at
Austin, who filed suit claiming
that the university's admissions
policies unconstitutionally dis
criminated against them on the
basis of race. In Grutter v.
Bollinger (2003), the most recent
affirmative action case before the
Court, the majority ruled that the
Constitution "does not prohibit
the [University of Michigan Law
School's] narrowly tailored use of
race in admissions decisions to
further a compelling interest in
obtaining the educational bene
fits that flow from a diverse stu
dent body."
Although many support affir
mative action as away to correct
for past and/or present racial dis
crimination, universities rely on
this diversity argument to justify
their race-based admissions poli
cies. Stanford is no different, ref
erencing on its web page a "com
mitment to diversity" that in
cludes, but is not limited to, diver
sity in terms of race and ethnicity.
Were Stanford to eliminate affir
mative action practices, Stan
ford's student body would be
come less racially diverse, similar
to what happened with the Uni
versity of California schools after
Proposition 209 prohibited race
based admissions policies in
1996.

Indeed, this Editorial Board
believes avoiding racial homoge
nization in elite educational insti
tutions is certainly a worthwhile
goal; among other positive bene
fits, a university with more diver
sity (defined broadly) can attract
a larger applicant pool and im
prove the experiences of all stu
dents. However, we believe that
the traditional diversity argu
ment for affirmative action has
troubling components, primarily
in treating underrepresented mi
norities Hispanics, Native
Americans and African Ameri
cans as a means to the educa
tional outcomes of whites and
Asians, the two predominant
groups at top universities today.

In Grutter, the majority af
firmed the Law School's policy to
admit a diverse group of students
who, among other things, would
"'contribute to the learning of
those around them.'" On its face,
this practice is hardly objection
able we all want our peers to
improve our overall experience.
But at its core, this practice treats
these "diverse" students as a

means to the education of the
white/Asian majority. Although
this may not seem pernicious at
first, in practice we often see the
less appealing effects of the di
versity-as-a-means argument.
At Stanford, the debate over
the presence of ethnic theme
dorms is one such unforeseen ef
fect. A 2010 article in the Stan
ford Review argued that the
presence of ethnic theme dorms
"denies the significant benefits
of a diverse residence to the rest
of the Stanford community." Re
gardless of one's stance on ethnic
theme dorms, the article points
out a valid hypocrisy in the tradi
tional diversity justification.
Stanford is committed to admit
ting minority students who,
among other things, create a
racially diverse class. But at what
point does this commitment
end? If we are to take the Review
article at face value, some stu
dents clearly believe that white
students at Stanford have a right
to live with students from a diver
sity of racial and ethnic back
grounds, regardless of the wishes
of those minority students.
This logic is deeply troubling.
Underrepresented minorities
should not be at Stanford be
cause their presence benefits a
particular group of students. No
student at Stanford should be
viewed as instrumental in that
way. Though we support race
based affirmative action to bring
about a more diverse student
body, we reject the justification
that diversity should be promot
ed as a means toward improved
educational experiences for the
majority group. Rather, this
Board feels there are other com
pelling reasons for increasing di
versity that do not rely on treat
ing one group as instrumental to
another. Stanford, and other elite
institutions, should begin to fully
explore the nuances of their affir
mative action policies and ulti
mately frame them in a more ap
propriate manner.

come less racially diverse, similar
to what happened with the Uni
versity of California schools after
Proposition 209 prohibited race
based admissions policies in
1996.

Indeed, this Editorial Board
believes avoiding racial homoge
nization in elite educational insti
tutions is certainly a worthwhile
goal; among other positive bene
fits, a university with more diver
sity (defined broadly) can attract
a larger applicant pool and im
prove the experiences of all stu
dents. However, we believe that
the traditional diversity argu
ment for affirmative action has
troubling components, primarily
in treating underrepresented mi
norities Hispanics, Native
Americans and African Ameri
cans as a means to the educa
tional outcomes of whites and
Asians, the two predominant
groups at top universities today.

In Grutter, the majority af
firmed the Law School's policy to
admit a diverse group of students
who, among other things, would
"'contribute to the learning of
those around them.'" On its face,
this practice is hardly objection
able we all want our peers to
improve our overall experience.
But at its core, this practice treats
these "diverse" students as a

means to the education of the
white/Asian majority. Although
this may not seem pernicious at
first, in practice we often see the
less appealing effects of the di
versity-as-a-means argument.
At Stanford, the debate over
the presence of ethnic theme
dorms is one such unforeseen ef
fect. A 2010 article in the Stan
ford Review argued that the
presence of ethnic theme dorms
"denies the significant benefits
of a diverse residence to the rest
of the Stanford community." Re
gardless of one's stance on ethnic
theme dorms, the article points
out a valid hypocrisy in the tradi
tional diversity justification.
Stanford is committed to admit
ting minority students who,
among other things, create a
racially diverse class. But at what
point does this commitment
end? If we are to take the Review
article at face value, some stu
dents clearly believe that white
students at Stanford have a right
to live with students from a diver
sity of racial and ethnic back
grounds, regardless of the wishes
of those minority students.
This logic is deeply troubling.
Underrepresented minorities
should not be at Stanford be
cause their presence benefits a
particular group of students. No
student at Stanford should be
viewed as instrumental in that
way. Though we support race
based affirmative action to bring
about a more diverse student
body, we reject the justification
that diversity should be promot
ed as a means toward improved
educational experiences for the
majority group. Rather, this
Board feels there are other com
pelling reasons for increasing di
versity that do not rely on treat
ing one group as instrumental to
another. Stanford, and other elite
institutions, should begin to fully
explore the nuances of their affir
mative action policies and ulti
mately frame them in a more ap
propriate manner.

Affirmative action, and its
role in the American uni
versity system, has al
ways been a contentious issue.
With the Supreme Court granti
ng certiorari last month to Fisher
v. The University of Texas, affir
mative action is once again at the
front of the debate over higher
education. The case involves two
white applicants, both rejected
from the University of Texas at
Austin, who filed suit claiming
that the university's admissions
policies unconstitutionally dis
criminated against them on the
basis of race. In Grutter v.
Bollinger (2003), the most recent
affirmative action case before the
Court, the majority ruled that the
Constitution "does not prohibit
the [University of Michigan Law
School's] narrowly tailored use of
race in admissions decisions to
further a compelling interest in
obtaining the educational bene
fits that flow from a diverse stu
dent body."
Although many support affir
mative action as away to correct
for past and/or present racial dis
crimination, universities rely on
this diversity argument to justify
their race-based admissions poli
cies. Stanford is no different, ref
erencing on its web page a "com
mitment to diversity" that in
cludes, but is not limited to, diver
sity in terms of race and ethnicity.
Were Stanford to eliminate affir
mative action practices, Stan
ford's student body would be
come less racially diverse, similar
to what happened with the Uni
versity of California schools after
Proposition 209 prohibited race
based admissions policies in
1996.
