## Pitching your ditch 
### Miriam Marks 
Last week, you decided to
schedule a dinner date with
that friend who lives across
campus. It seemed like a great
idea at the time of course
you'd be able to dash out of sec
tion, peddle madly over to the
dining hall, have a leisurely 20-
minute meal and then arrive a
few minutes late to your next
meeting. You like this friend so
much that the hassle would be
worth it.

Right? Maybe. But now it's
Dead Week, when Stanford is
anything but dead, and you've
probably realized that the plan
you made was pretty unrealistic.
It's not that dinner will have to be
15 minutes; it's that you'll have to
skip dinner altogether. What
about your friend? Your friend is
faithfully waiting for you, count
ing down the minutes to meet you
at the door to the dining hall.
Unfortunately for this friend,
you'll have to bail. Ditch. Flake.
We have a lot of names for this
kind of person the person who
does not always follow through
with plans or keep commitments.
Let's retell the story from the
other perspective.
Last week your friend, who

lives all the way across campus,
initiated a plan to grab dinner to
gether. This friend is usually pret
ty busy, so a dinner is a rare occur
rence. You've been planning your
outfit all day in preparation for
this momentous occasion. Okay,
maybe not. But you're at least
somewhat excited, and you've
made a few minor schedule ad
justments to accommodate this
friend.

A few hours before dinner you
receive this text message: "Hey
dude, I'm so sorry, but I can't
make dinner after all." There
might be a sad-face emoticon too.
Ouch. Off you go, alone, to the
dining hall or the movie, or the
party, or whatever engagement is
at hand. Countless people are
ditched all the time, in all sorts of
ways and situations. And ditching
is especially common on a cam
pus full of busy, slightly over
worked and likely overcommit
ted university students.
If you've been ditched, you
know that it doesn't feel very
good. At the same time, most of us
have also ditched someone at
some recent point in our lives.
We're all human. The question is
how to pitch your ditch: how to

make your cancellation seem the
least offensive or absent-minded.
I usually feel a little better
when a friend bails on me if I get
to hear exactly why I'm getting
ditched. The mysterious text or
email that merely calls off a plan
leaves me guessing and wonder
ing why my company is so un
pleasant. I start to picture all the
other things that my friend would
be doing instead of spending time
with me. Am I not worth their
time? Are they eating dinner with
a better friend? Did they really
have something better to do than
hang out with me?
So, the next time you prepare
to bail on your friend, consider
explaining the reason for your
flakiness. You don't have to out
line your schedule minute-by
minute, but your ditched friend
gains peace of mind if you pro
vide a general outline of your
other activities. For example, it
wouldn't kill your fingers to text

the following: "Hey dude, sorry I
can't make dinner tonight! I have
only 20 minutes between office
hours and a mandatory meeting."
If you're positive that you can
make the commitment, you can
also pacify your ditched friend by
making a second set of plans. Re
member, your friend may be feel
ing personally rejected by your
cancellation. A second proposi
tion to hang out reaffirms that
you like your friend but that you
were momentarily busy. That text
might look something like: "Hey,
I'm sorry I can't make dinner
tonight, but are you free next
week instead?"
Then there's the common rea
son for ditching: sickness. How
many times has someone bailed

on you because they had any
thing from a headache to acute
food poisoning? You really can't
hold this against your friend; if
someone ditches you for medical
reasons, you'll just have to con
tain your frustration. The danger
is in using sickness as a fictitious
excuse. When you're sick for the
fifth time, this friend may start to
wonder why you get a headache
every time the two of you plan to
get together.
But no matter your reason for
flaking, it's most comforting for
the person on the other end if you
explain your true reasons for
doing so. Even if you're ditching
to take a nap, to go to the gym or
to have a few moments of quiet
time to yourself, let your friend
know. You'll both appreciate the
honesty.

please don't ditch her.
