## On civility 
### Sebastain Gould 
As we come into the end of
the quarter, we start ramp
ing up for finals by sleep
ing less and studying more. As in
all times of stress, it is important to
not lose sight of civility. It takes so
little effort to treat others with a
small degree of respect, and none
at all to at least be ambivalent to
them. Being uncivil can ruin
someone else's day. Why do it?
Being uncivil because you are
tired or stressed does not convey
to the world that you are stressed
and tired. It conveys the message
that you are not a nice person, and
don't care if you are rude. If you
are uncivil to someone, they will
have a negative impression of
you, and remember you as being
rude when they see you again.
One place I've seen this play
out is the room reservation sys
tem at Old Union. Groups and in
dividuals can reserve rooms in
Old Union to study and have
group meetings for a limited

amount of time that they enter
into the online reservation sys
tem. When it is time for a group to
enter the room, if it is already oc
cupied, it is customary for a mem
ber from the new group to go to
the room and announce politely
that they are there to claim the
room next. At that point the indi
viduals in the room will be given
time to leave before the new
group enters.
There are two reasons why oc
cupants are not ready to leave the
room immediately, when their
time is up. The first is that they had
simply not paid attention to the
time, and their meeting ran over.
The second is that many times a
group will reserve a room in Old
Union and not show up, and so
there is no reason to leave a room
until someone comes from the
next group and announces that
they are present and waiting.
Tuesday of last week, my fi
ancee and I were at the Old Union

studying in a room. About 15 min
utes before the next group was
scheduled to show up, people
walking by started giving really
mean looks, distracting me from
studying. We could only presume

The fabric of
society is woven
by the polite "good
mornings" and
"thank yous."
