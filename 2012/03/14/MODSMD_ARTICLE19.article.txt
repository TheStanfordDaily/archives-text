## Why everything is okay 
### Ravali Reddy 
I have had plenty of advice
given to me during my time
here at Stanford. Some of it is
solicited, some of it obvious and
some of it unwanted, but all of it
is provided with good intentions.
TAs have tried to help me under
stand what types of questions will
be on the exam, girlfriends have
helped me pick what shoes to
wear and discussions over late
night food have provided me
with life lessons that I'm starting
to live by. Granted, some of the
advice isn't always the best, but
every now and then, I receive a
piece of advice so wonderful, that
I feel the need to shout it from
the top of Hoover Tower.
Unfortunately, however, I
spent the first year and half of
college with no platform to speak
from, and I was forced to resort
to excited text messages and in
spirational Facebook statuses
the ones that everyone hates but
ends up pressing the "Like" but
ton on anyway. But lucky for me,

the wonderful people over at The
Daily have decided to provide
me with this column, which gives
me the chance to share the wis
dom that I've been fortunate
enough to receive, so here it goes.
As winter quarter wraps up
and we begin to prepare for fi
nals, all the stress we've been
avoiding while basking in the
sunshine is slowly beginning to
rear its ugly head. People are
starting to worry about grades,
finals, spring break plans and, if
you're a sophomore, what to
major in. Naturally, with all this
stress comes the feelings and
emotions associated with it, and,
like the little Stanford ducks
