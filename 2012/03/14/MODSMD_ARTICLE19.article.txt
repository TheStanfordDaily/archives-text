# RAVALATIONS
## Why everything is okay 
### Ravali Reddy 
I have had plenty of advice
given to me during my time
here at Stanford. Some of it is
solicited, some of it obvious and
some of it unwanted, but all of it
is provided with good intentions.
TAs have tried to help me under
stand what types of questions will
be on the exam, girlfriends have
helped me pick what shoes to
wear and discussions over late
night food have provided me
with life lessons that I'm starting
to live by. Granted, some of the
advice isn't always the best, but
every now and then, I receive a
piece of advice so wonderful, that
I feel the need to shout it from
the top of Hoover Tower.
Unfortunately, however, I
spent the first year and half of
college with no platform to speak
from, and I was forced to resort
to excited text messages and in
spirational Facebook statuses
the ones that everyone hates but
ends up pressing the "Like" but
ton on anyway. But lucky for me,

the wonderful people over at The
Daily have decided to provide
me with this column, which gives
me the chance to share the wis
dom that I've been fortunate
enough to receive, so here it goes.
As winter quarter wraps up
and we begin to prepare for fi
nals, all the stress we've been
avoiding while basking in the
sunshine is slowly beginning to
rear its ugly head. People are
starting to worry about grades,
finals, spring break plans and, if
you're a sophomore, what to
major in. Naturally, with all this
stress comes the feelings and
emotions associated with it, and,
like the little Stanford ducks

that we are, we do what we do
best we start paddling like
crazy and we start freaking out.
My personal freak-out ses
sions are usually accompanied
by cookies (most recently
they've been Samoas, thanks to
the Girl Scouts camped out in
White Plaza), brief Netflix
breaks and little rant sessions
with my best friends. During one
of these rant sessions, a friend of
mine brought up a great point
about how to deal with times like
these.
Stress can make it seem like
the world around you is about to
come crashing down, but it's im
portant to realize that nothing is
actually collapsing. People love
to say that everything is going to
be okay, but the other day, a
friend made me realize some
thing much more accurate

everything already is okay. It's
easy to get caught up in stress
and worry about everything
that's difficult in your life. It's
even easier to believe that
you've fallen prey to circum
stance to think that your
classes are too hard, that your
problems are too big and that
things are too difficult to fix. But
the other day, I was reminded
that you control your state of
mind, not the other way around.
So despite the fact that your
brain may be screaming at you
and trying to prompt a freak-out
session of your own, here's a re
minder that you can always take
a moment to breathe and clear
your mind. As cheesy as it may
sound, just remember that you
are in charge of yourself. Some
times, it's the obvious advice that
is the best.
So happy Dead Week, Stan
ford, and good luck on finals!
