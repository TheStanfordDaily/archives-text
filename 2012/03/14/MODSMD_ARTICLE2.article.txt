## ASSU Senate struggles for relevancy, lasting effect 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DEPUTY EDITOR 
Despite having passed over 40
pieces of legislation during its
term thus far, the 13th ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate has struggled
to make an impact this year due
to bureaucratic gridlock, opposi
tion from University officials and
inconsistency in following its own
legislation. The Senate's actions
have proven largely internal or
ineffectual a far cry from the
representatives' platforms tout

and student life issues.
Transparency
On May 31, near the start of its
term, the Senate unanimously

improve accountability of the
Undergraduate Senate," The bill
sought to improve transparency
of Senate action by requiring sen

site for all students to see. The
then-fresh senators recognized
student body sentiment of confu

Senate and sought to change this
pattern.
Senators have not referred to
the bill in their weekly meetings
since it was passed last May. No
database of senator projects ex

have no central location, but are
scattered in the minutes of Senate
meetings posted on the body's
website, which didn't exist until
more than halfway through the
year.

limited its transparency by begin
ning to hold 15- to 20-minute "in
formal" meetings excluding re
porters before each of its consti
tutionally mandated open meet
ings each week. The informal
meetings began at the third meet
ing after a Daily article ("Senate
bill fails: 5 in favor, 4 opposed,"
Nov. 30) reported on a con
tentious moment between Senate
Deputy Chair Dan Ashton 'l4
and Senator Janani Ramachan
dran 'l4. According to Senate
Chair Rafael Vazquez 'l2, the in
formal meetings are intended to
allow "personal issues" to be
aired outside of the public's view;
however, the meetings serve
other purposes, as well.
"Not all senators have time to
be up-to-date to what's on the
agenda," Deputy Chair Dan Ash
