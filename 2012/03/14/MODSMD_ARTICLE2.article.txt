## ASSU Senate struggles for relevancy, lasting effect 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DEPUTY EDITOR 
Despite having passed over 40
pieces of legislation during its
term thus far, the 13th ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate has struggled
to make an impact this year due
to bureaucratic gridlock, opposi
tion from University officials and
inconsistency in following its own
legislation. The Senate's actions
have proven largely internal or
ineffectual a far cry from the
representatives' platforms tout
ing transparency, accountability,
and student life issues.
Transparency
On May 31, near the start of its
term, the Senate unanimously
passed UGS-S2Oll-20, a bill "to
improve accountability of the
Undergraduate Senate," The bill
sought to improve transparency
of Senate action by requiring sen
ators to put any individual and
committee projects, accompanied
by timelines, on the Senate web
site for all students to see. The
then-fresh senators recognized
student body sentiment of confu
sion and disconnect regarding the
Senate and sought to change this
pattern.
Senators have not referred to
the bill in their weekly meetings
since it was passed last May. No
database of senator projects ex
ists and bills passed by the Senate
have no central location, but are
scattered in the minutes of Senate
meetings posted on the body's
website, which didn't exist until
more than halfway through the
year.

In January, the Senate further
limited its transparency by begin
ning to hold 15- to 20-minute "in
formal" meetings excluding re
porters before each of its consti
tutionally mandated open meet
ings each week. The informal
meetings began at the third meet
ing after a Daily article ("Senate
bill fails: 5 in favor, 4 opposed,"
Nov. 30) reported on a con
tentious moment between Senate
Deputy Chair Dan Ashton 'l4
and Senator Janani Ramachan
dran 'l4. According to Senate
Chair Rafael Vazquez 'l2, the in
formal meetings are intended to
allow "personal issues" to be
aired outside of the public's view;
however, the meetings serve
other purposes, as well.
"Not all senators have time to
be up-to-date to what's on the
agenda," Deputy Chair Dan Ash
ton 'l4 said as part of an explana-
tion for the pre-meetings, though
he directed questions about the
meetings to Vazquez. While sena
tors have maintained that they do
not directly discuss bills at the
meeting, they do acknowledge
using the time to review agenda
items.
"Disintegrating initiatives"
Of the 40 bills passed thus far,
six made internal ASSU ap
pointments, four created inter
nal divisions within the ASSU
and three were "resolutions" on
behalf of the student body, each
of which ultimately failed to gar
ner response or action from the
University.
The Senate launched three
initiatives this year that sought
to affect student life but failed to
gain traction.
After several weeks of debate
in October, the Senate passed
two bills creating the Division of
Internal Review (DIR). headed
by Andrew Aguilar 'l4. The
DIR, strongly supported by
ASSU Executive Michael Cruz
'l2, was intended to promote ef
ficiency and reform within the
ASSU. Instead, it suffered
months of delay due to difficulty
accessing the necessary docu
mentation for review from SSE.
The DIR did not receive Sen
ate renewal in January following
complaints that Aguilar hadn't
been communicating with the
Senate properly, and the group
failed to produce any reports. A
form of the group now exists
under a different name in the
ASSU Executive branch, but has
not produced any public docu
ments.

A second initiative sought to
support the Stanford football
team. Senators Ben Laufer 'l2
and Nate Garcia 'l4 aimed to
offer students a package deal to
make the USC football game in
Los Angeles affordable. Laufer
and Garcia said after they se
cured funding sources, Nanci
Howe, director of Student Activ
ities and Leadership (SAL),
halted their project. Howe told
The Daily that the trip didn't
meet requirements from the Of
fice of Risk Management, which

recommended that the ASSU
not promote the event in the
University's name. Howe said
the Senate was aware that this
was a recommendation; howev
er, senators repeatedly referred
to it as a prohibition.
"What that made it difficult
to do was market effectively,"
Garcia said. "Technically, we
weren't allowed to market it as
an ASSU initiative."
The senators then transi
tioned to a rebate program, hop
ing to subsidize ticket costs. The
program received hundreds of
submissions for the rebate; how
ever, since the Oct. 29 game,
only one refund check has been
processed. Garcia blamed the
hold-up on Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE), the financial
arm of the ASSU, but SSE CEO
Neveen Mahmoud 'll said the
Senate has only submitted three
check requests so far, and only
one has been picked up.
In October, the Senate set up
a Vaden Advisory Board to es
tablish a "well-informed link be
tween Vaden Health Center and
the student body." The Senate
appointed three members
two of them senators to the
advisory committee in January.
When asked this week, Senator
Tara Trujillo 'l4 initially said the
committee hadn't held any meet
ings or taken any action, but Sen
ator Lily Fu 'l4 clarified that the
board met with Vaden officials in
February to discuss increasing
student access to off-campus
medical options.
"We advise and keep open
lines of communication with
Vaden, but do not necessarily
program nor legislate on Vaden's
activities," Fu said in an email to
The Daily.
University opposition
One attempt by the Senate to
address student need resulted in
an empty call for action by Uni
versity officials who then object
ed to the legislation.
The CARDINAL Act, a reso
lution passed in February and co
authored by five senators in
cluding Brianna Pang 'l3 and
Dan DeLong 'l3, now running
together for ASSU Executive,
and Cruz called upon the
Language Center to modify its
policy regarding attendance, ar
guing unfairness to disabled stu
dents.

The Senate called upon the
Office of Accessible Education
(OAE), the University depart
ment responsible for ensuring
access for disabled students, to
act on behalf of disabled students
regarding the issue. OAE Direc
tor Joan Bisagno had harsh
words for the bill's authors.
"The author of that bill really
misstated the issue and used our
office in an inappropriate way,"
Bisagno said in an interview with
The Daily. "To use disability as
the reason to push this law
through is absolutely incorrect."
Bisagno said the Language
Center's policy does not violate
any laws and that the department
has been helpful in accommodat
ing disabled students in the past.
Buffer fund debate
Two bills and months of work
went into providing funding for
the Stanford Concert Network
(SCN) and Blackfest concert or
ganizers from an ASSU buffer
fund. The fund, which many sena
tors didn't know existed before
SCN organizer Stephen Trusheim
'l3 requested money from it, is
funded from excess special fees
and intended to fund groups that
don't receive enough votes for
special fees. The Senate passed
bills that granted $35,000 to SCN,
but loaned Blackfest $40,000, a
double standard that has never
been explained.
In addition to these inequity
concerns, SSE CEO Neveen
Mahmoud 'll expressed con
cerns after the passage of the bill
about the use of this buffer fund,
saying, "I don't believe that this
should be a regular use for buffer
fund money."

Funding and advocacy
When interviewed, no senator
listed any of the above bills or ini
tiatives as the most important ac
tion resulting from their term. In
stead, senators cited effective dis
bursement of funds to student
groups and advocacy to adminis
trators as their top accomplish
ments for the year.
The funding of student groups
occurs almost entirely in the ap
propriations committee. While
senators vote on funding bills as a
group, no funding bill has ever
made it through the appropria
tions committee and then failed its
vote in the 13th Senate. Funding
bills are typically passed unani
mously and without discussion at
the start of every meeting.
While senators refer to meet
ings with administrators as a key
part of their service to the student
body, this unique aspect of the role
is nearly impossible to quantify.
These reported meetings occur be
hind closed doors, meaning the
student body has no way of know
ing what is said or advocated on its
behalf.
There are notable exceptions to
the Senate's struggles with pro
grams this year. A one-on-one ad
vocacy program created by De-
Long has served over 30 students,
he said.

Another key outcome of this
year may be a new version of the
ASSU governing documents,
which were re-written and short
ened this year, almost entirely by
Cruz and Senator Alex Kindel 'l4,
in the hopes of simplifying internal
ASSU rules and regulations. The
new draft is currently in a feedback
phase. Former ASSU Executives
sent Cruz and the current Senate a
letter advising to delay the self-im
posed ratification deadline of
April 14 for at least a quarter. This
action would push the ratification
process to the next Senate.
Prescient, if ineffective
The Senate predicted its woes
and diagnosed systemic problems
as far back as UGS-S2Oll-20 on
May 31.
"Projects initiated by Senators
are not always carried out within
the initially determined time
frame, and sometimes disinte
grate altogether," read the legis
lation.
With elections for next year
approaching and no current sena
tors running for re-election to the
Senate, the window for action by
this year's representatives is
swiftly closing.
