# All about the major
## Freshmen reflect on choosing a major 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
£ £ ~w- k are you majoring in?" is a
% A J question we have all been
% / % / asked when making new ac
1/ 1/ quaintances at Stanford or
T Y meeting people out in the
real world. The query is usually followed by some
mumbling from those of us who are still unsure;a rat
tling off of two majors, two minors and a thesis from
those overly sure; and a standard response from all
the rest.
To be fair, there are many possible answers. Stan
ford offers over 80 majors ranging from geo
physics to Slavic languages and literature in 70
departments spread out over three schools: the
School of Earth Sciences, the School of Engineering
and the School of Humanities and Sciences. There
are options to double major, minor or pursue an in
dividually designed major.
According to the Office of the University Regis
trar, in the 2008-09 academic year, the most popular
majors, measured by number of degrees conferred,
were human biology, economics and international
relations. In 2010-2011, computer science moved up
to become the second most popular major.
"[The major] provides a set of topics, a focus and
discipline that becomes the locus for their intellectu
al development," said Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9, dean
of freshmen and undergraduate advising, in a July
2011 interview.
"The worst reason to pick a major is because you
think you should study that or 'everybody is studying
that' or 'this is the up-and-coming major," she added.
While Stanford offers a wide range of majors, stu
dents tend to classify options into "techie" and
"fuzzy" categories, the former referring to hard and
applied sciences and the latter to the humanities. Al
though 80 percent of degrees are awarded in the
School of Humanities and Sciences and Times High
er Education ranked Stanford first in humanities and
arts subject rankings this past fall, the University has
developed a reputation as a "techie" school due its
location and connections to Silicon Valley.
"I came to Stanford because I knew I could get an
amazing liberal arts education here," said Eleanor
Walker 'l5, a self-declared "fuzzy." "Honestly, I was
surprised by the emphasis on engineering and other
hard sciences."
Another common student concern is balancing
general requirements with classes in the major, espe
cially if pursuing a major with a demanding course
load.
"The prerequisites are onerous, and I would
rather not do them if I had a choice," said Aaron
Sekhri 'l5, a potential symbolic systems major. "But
I am of firm opinion that no knowledge is ever a
waste and that regardless of the lack of utility of
those courses, there must be a reason the program di
rectors have selected them."
For student-athletes, with practice, game and
travel commitments, major options can become lim
ited.
"It would be really hard to pursue something like

pre-med or engineering because of time con
straints," said golfer Mariko Tumangan 'l5. "I am
confident that athletes at Stanford could succeed at
their sport and a demanding major if we had more
than 24 hours in a day."
Despite Stanford's many resources, including ac
ademic advisors, pre-major advisors, workshops and
fairs designed to help students find their passions, se
lecting a major can be particularly confusing for
freshman.
Eri Gamo 'l5, is unsure about her potential
major.
"I am thinking about everything from symbolic
systems to computer science to neurology," she said.
"I did not come to Stanford with a concrete plan or
idea because 1 wanted to explore."
Gamo said she believes her eventual choice will
stem from her passions.
"[l] want to major in something I love and some
thing 1 can do in the future," she said.
Other freshmen, like Paul Benigeri 'l5, who in
tends to major in computer science, are already sure
that they have made the right decision in selecting a
major.
"My eyes were opened to computer science in
high school, and so I came to Stanford to chase my
dreams," he said. "I cannot imagine doing anything
else."
Indecision about major choice may not be limited
to the freshman year, as one upperclassman ex
plained. Narjis Sarehane 'l3 was pursuing electrical
engineering before recently deciding to switch to
management science and engineering.
"People often get worried about switching majors,
but if you are not happy in your current major, it re
ally is not worth it," she said.
