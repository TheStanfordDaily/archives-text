# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## In defense of KONY 2012 
### Miles Unterreiner 
If you're on Facebook or if
you've been compulsively
playing and replaying Carly
Rae Jepsen's hit single "Call Me
Maybe" on You Tube, which I cer
tainly haven't then you know
by now about KONY 2012, the
new campaign to arrest Joseph
Kony and bring him before the In
ternational Criminal Court (ICC)
by the end of 2012.
You've probably also heard
that KONY 2012's parent organi
zation, Invisible Children, and
IC's head filmmaker, Jason Rus
sell, have received a great deal of
criticism since the release of their
viral video on March sth. Some of
these criticisms are fair; some are
well-intended but ultimately mis
guided and some are simply irrel
evant.
Let's go through them one by
one.
The Video Oversimplifies a Real
ly Complex Situation.
This frequently raised objec
tion is factually accurate but ulti
mately immaterial. There's no
doubt that KONY 2012, clocking
in at all of 30 minutes, fails to
paint a nuanced picture of what's
really going on in Uganda
most notably the fact that Joseph
Kony isn't actually there any
more.
But it's a bit much to demand
that any half-watchable video de
signed to inspire millions to ac
tion also takes into account the
full intricacies of a decades-old
problem stretching across four
countries, all thousands of miles
away.
By adopting this clear, simplis
tic medium, Mr. Russell has suc
ceeded where all of his critics
have failed: in getting someone
besides policymakers and aca
demics to actually care about a
problem that doesn't affect them
directly. Where we go from here,
and whether we acknowledge
and move beyond the inherent
limitations of a 30-minute
You Tube video, is up to us but
thanks to Mr. Russell, at least
we're talking about it, which is

better than you can say for Amer
icans most of the time.
But it advocates military inter
vention!
This objection is most often
raised by people who love the
idea of international law in the
abstract but recoil in horror at the
thought of it actually being en
forced. If the ICC is ever to be
come more than a pleasant
sounding mouthpiece that peri
odically issues useless arrest war
rants for powerful men, then
somebody eventually needs to
give it some teeth.
And let's be fair; the continued
presence of 100 military advisors
who will see no combat and
whose roles will be limited to pro
viding advice to Ugandan mili
tary units hardly constitutes in
tervention. If American "inter
ventions" looked more like what
IC is proposing and less like Iraq
and Afghanistan, I think we'd all
be pretty happy.
Isn't this just the White Man's
Burden all over again?
Critics of KONY 2012 on the
anticolonial left see Invisible
Children at best as a malevolent
reincarnation of what Nigerian-
American novelist Teju Cole
called the "White Savior Industri
al Complex," and at worst a badly
disguised front group for Wash
ington's ravenous, oil-grabbing
militarists. According to this view,
IC represents the cancer of white
privilege metastasized into coun
terproductive hipster "slack
tivism" on behalf of hapless
Africans who allegedly don't
know better. Even worse, Russell
and his team at IC could simply
be what political scientist Adam
Branch termed '"useful idiots,'
being used by those in the US
government who seek to milita
rize Africa" unwitting tools in
the greedy hands of carbon-hun
gry neoimperialists.
The former charge, which
should be taken seriously given
the real history of European
domination justified by benevo-

lence, is a bit unfair in this case. 95
percent of IC's staff is Ugandan,
and it's unclear exactly why being
white, or any color, should dis
qualify one from offering help to
a fellow human being.
As for the conspiracy theories
of imminent large-scale American
invasion, I have yet to see any proof
that the state has had any role in the
promotion, financing or develop
ment of Invisible Children.
There are a lot of other problems
out there, and just arresting one
man won't solve them.
This objection, while of course
true, misses the point.
Most development initiatives
are prospective and consequen
tialist: they hope to increase wel
fare in the future. A significant
part of the KONY 2012 cam
paign, on the other hand, is retro
spective and to some degree de
ontological. Arresting Kony is im
portant not only because it will
prevent him from killing in the fu
ture (or deter others like him),
but also because he has commit
ted heinous crimes in the past.
When the police arrest a domes
tic criminal, they don't do it on
the grounds that he will probably
commit another crime later; they
rightfully lock him up on the
grounds that he has already
stolen, injured or damaged.
Therefore, even if capturing
Kony had no positive effect on
anyone's future welfare (which it
clearly would), arresting him
would still be a legitimate goal
a goal that needs to be balanced
against the costs and benefits of
other goals, to be sure, but a legit
imate one nonetheless.

the greedy hands of carbon-hun
gry neoimperialists.
The former charge, which
should be taken seriously given
the real history of European
domination justified by benevo-

lence, is a bit unfair in this case. 95
percent of IC's staff is Ugandan,
and it's unclear exactly why being
white, or any color, should dis
qualify one from offering help to
a fellow human being.
As for the conspiracy theories
of imminent large-scale American
invasion, I have yet to see any proof
that the state has had any role in the
promotion, financing or develop
ment of Invisible Children.
There are a lot of other problems
out there, and just arresting one
man won't solve them.
This objection, while of course
true, misses the point.
Most development initiatives
are prospective and consequen
tialist: they hope to increase wel
fare in the future. A significant
part of the KONY 2012 cam
paign, on the other hand, is retro
spective and to some degree de
ontological. Arresting Kony is im
portant not only because it will
prevent him from killing in the fu
ture (or deter others like him),
but also because he has commit
ted heinous crimes in the past.
When the police arrest a domes
tic criminal, they don't do it on
the grounds that he will probably
commit another crime later; they
rightfully lock him up on the
grounds that he has already
stolen, injured or damaged.
Therefore, even if capturing
Kony had no positive effect on
anyone's future welfare (which it
clearly would), arresting him
would still be a legitimate goal
a goal that needs to be balanced
against the costs and benefits of
other goals, to be sure, but a legit
imate one nonetheless.

If you're on Facebook or if
you've been compulsively
playing and replaying Carly
Rae Jepsen's hit single "Call Me
Maybe" on You Tube, which I cer
tainly haven't then you know
by now about KONY 2012, the
new campaign to arrest Joseph
Kony and bring him before the In
ternational Criminal Court (ICC)
by the end of 2012.
You've probably also heard
that KONY 2012's parent organi
zation, Invisible Children, and
IC's head filmmaker, Jason Rus
sell, have received a great deal of
criticism since the release of their
viral video on March sth. Some of
these criticisms are fair; some are
well-intended but ultimately mis
guided and some are simply irrel
evant.
Let's go through them one by
one.
The Video Oversimplifies a Real
ly Complex Situation.
This frequently raised objec
tion is factually accurate but ulti
mately immaterial. There's no
doubt that KONY 2012, clocking
in at all of 30 minutes, fails to
paint a nuanced picture of what's
really going on in Uganda
most notably the fact that Joseph
Kony isn't actually there any
more.
But it's a bit much to demand
that any half-watchable video de
signed to inspire millions to ac
tion also takes into account the
full intricacies of a decades-old
problem stretching across four
countries, all thousands of miles
away.
By adopting this clear, simplis
tic medium, Mr. Russell has suc
ceeded where all of his critics
have failed: in getting someone
besides policymakers and aca
demics to actually care about a
problem that doesn't affect them
directly. Where we go from here,
and whether we acknowledge
and move beyond the inherent
limitations of a 30-minute
You Tube video, is up to us but
thanks to Mr. Russell, at least
we're talking about it, which is

better than you can say for Amer
icans most of the time.
But it advocates military inter
vention!
This objection is most often
raised by people who love the
idea of international law in the
abstract but recoil in horror at the
thought of it actually being en
forced. If the ICC is ever to be
come more than a pleasant
sounding mouthpiece that peri
odically issues useless arrest war
rants for powerful men, then
somebody eventually needs to
give it some teeth.
And let's be fair; the continued
presence of 100 military advisors
who will see no combat and
whose roles will be limited to pro
viding advice to Ugandan mili
tary units hardly constitutes in
tervention. If American "inter
ventions" looked more like what
IC is proposing and less like Iraq
and Afghanistan, I think we'd all
be pretty happy.
Isn't this just the White Man's
Burden all over again?
Critics of KONY 2012 on the
anticolonial left see Invisible
Children at best as a malevolent
reincarnation of what Nigerian-
American novelist Teju Cole
called the "White Savior Industri
al Complex," and at worst a badly
disguised front group for Wash
ington's ravenous, oil-grabbing
militarists. According to this view,
IC represents the cancer of white
privilege metastasized into coun
terproductive hipster "slack
tivism" on behalf of hapless
Africans who allegedly don't
know better. Even worse, Russell
and his team at IC could simply
be what political scientist Adam
Branch termed '"useful idiots,'
being used by those in the US
government who seek to milita
rize Africa" unwitting tools in
the greedy hands of carbon-hun
gry neoimperialists.
