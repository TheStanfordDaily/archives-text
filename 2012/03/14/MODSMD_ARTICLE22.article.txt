## Students, faculty support GMO transparency legislation Students organize to support California label requirement for genetically modified food 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Due to health and transparency concerns, some
Stanford students and faculty have expressed sup
port for a proposed ballot initiative that would re
quire the labeling of genetically modified food on re
tail grocery products in California. The California
Right to Know Genetically Engineered Food Act of
2012 requires 504,760 signatures to appear on the
Nov. 2012 ballot in California.
Hannah Kohrman, co-president of the Stanford
Farm Project and a coterminal student in earth sys
tems, said she "fully supports" the ballot initiative.
"Genetically engineered (GE) foods are highly
controversial to begin with," Kohrman said. "Many
consumers don't trust their safety and think we don't
know enough about the consequences of eating and
growing GE foods."
The Farm Project will discuss the ballot initiative
at its normal Wednesday night meeting this week.
Kohrman said she will "recommend that [the
group's] members sign the online petition" at the
meeting.
Kohrman called into question the rationale be
hind the food industry's reluctance to label foods.
"The fact that the food industry would be so
against labeling genetically modified crops makes
me even more skeptical," she said.
According to Kari Nadeau, Stanford associate
professor of pediatrics, "if something has been genet
ically modified the public ought to know."
Nadeau stressed the importance of a label "that
states what type of genetic modification has oc
curred."
"If to increase the protein content of a food you
have inserted nut proteins, the food product has to be
labeled," Nadeau said.
The health risk of splicing peanut and tree nut
proteins into other foods to enhance the protein
count is an issue that needs to be researched further,
she said. According to Nadeau, seemingly minor al
terations can have unintended life-threatening rami
fications for the growing number of food allergy suf
ferers, and not labeling genetically modified foods
risks creating serious anaphylactic allergic reactions.
Nadeau noted that doctors are curious if allergies
were as common among the population before there
were genetically modified (GM) foods.
"When the soybean started to become genetical
ly modified, those modifications were at the fulcrum,
and we began to see an increase in the prevalence of
food allergies," Nadeau said. "Modern hygiene is
probably also a factor," she added.
"As we move forward with generations, things are
getting worse and worse, with a steady rise of food al
lergies and asthma," Nadeau said. "TTiere's an entire
profile of a nation that's becoming more allergic."
According to the California Secretary of State
website, the ballot initiative would "require labeling
on raw or processed food offered for sale to con
sumers if made from plants or animals with genetic
material changed in specific ways."
The initiative would exempt certain foods from
being labeled such as certified organic food, products
of animals that ate or were dosed with genetically
modified material and foods that are "processed with
or containing only small amounts of genetically mod
ified ingredients."

The Secretary of State website indicates that the
fiscal impact would be a "potential increase in state

administrative costs of up to one million dollars an
nually to monitor compliance with the disclosure re
quirements specified in the measure." Legal costs
due to "possible violations to the provisions of this
measure" to the courts and attorney general could
add up to "potentially significant costs."
Ruthie Schwab MBA 'l3, president of the Gradu
ate School of Business Food and Agricultural Re
source Management Club, said she views informing
consumers and clearly labeling food as the best poli
cy. Schwab highlighted implications on a national
and governmental level, nothing that "it ensures a
higher level of transparency and accountability
along supply chains, which can be valuable from a
food safety perspective."

"While in the short term it may create an initial
burden for industry, the European Union (EU) has
shown it can be done and, once implemented, does
not seem to pose a significant ongoing challenge,"
Schwab continued.
A submission to the California Attorney Gener
al's office by James Wheaton, attorney for the initia
tive's proponents and visiting lecturer in the Stan
ford department of Communication, said that "polls
consistently show that more than 90 percent of the
public want to know if their food was produced using
genetic engineering."
The proponent findings statement continues, stat
ing "no federal or California law requires that food
producers identify whether foods were produced
using genetic engineering," whereas, "fifty countries
including the EU member states, Japan and other
key U.S. trading partners have laws mandating
disclosure of genetically engineered foods."
The initiative materials also note the environ
mental impact of increased GM food production,
stressing the "hundreds of millions of pounds of ad
ditional herbicides ... used on U.S. farms" on GE
crops that tolerate herbicides.
"Organic farming is a significant and increasingly
important part of California agriculture," the state
ment continues. California has "one out of every four
certified organic operations in the nation," and these
farmers' crops "are regularly threatened with acci
dental contamination from neighboring lands where
genetically engineered crops abound."
Student supporters of the initiative differentiate
between base objection to genetically modified
foods and a desire for greater transparency for con
sumers.
"The initiative is not debating the safety or use of
GE foods, but it's supporting the consumer's right to
know," Kohrman said.
"GMOs aren't always bad in themselves, and they
may be necessary to feed a growing world popula
tion, but it's important to protect consumer choice by
labeling foods that contain genetically modified
plants," said Elaine Albertson, a coterminal student
in earth systems and urban food systems.

HANNAH KOHRMAN,
Stanford Farm Project
Due to health and transparency concerns, some
Stanford students and faculty have expressed sup
port for a proposed ballot initiative that would re
quire the labeling of genetically modified food on re
tail grocery products in California. The California
Right to Know Genetically Engineered Food Act of
2012 requires 504,760 signatures to appear on the
Nov. 2012 ballot in California.
Hannah Kohrman, co-president of the Stanford
Farm Project and a coterminal student in earth sys
tems, said she "fully supports" the ballot initiative.
"Genetically engineered (GE) foods are highly
controversial to begin with," Kohrman said. "Many
consumers don't trust their safety and think we don't
know enough about the consequences of eating and
growing GE foods."
The Farm Project will discuss the ballot initiative
at its normal Wednesday night meeting this week.
Kohrman said she will "recommend that [the
group's] members sign the online petition" at the
meeting.
Kohrman called into question the rationale be
hind the food industry's reluctance to label foods.
"The fact that the food industry would be so
against labeling genetically modified crops makes
me even more skeptical," she said.
According to Kari Nadeau, Stanford associate
professor of pediatrics, "if something has been genet
ically modified the public ought to know."
Nadeau stressed the importance of a label "that
states what type of genetic modification has oc
curred."
"If to increase the protein content of a food you
have inserted nut proteins, the food product has to be
labeled," Nadeau said.
The health risk of splicing peanut and tree nut
proteins into other foods to enhance the protein
count is an issue that needs to be researched further,
she said. According to Nadeau, seemingly minor al
terations can have unintended life-threatening rami
fications for the growing number of food allergy suf
ferers, and not labeling genetically modified foods
risks creating serious anaphylactic allergic reactions.
Nadeau noted that doctors are curious if allergies
were as common among the population before there
were genetically modified (GM) foods.
"When the soybean started to become genetical
ly modified, those modifications were at the fulcrum,
and we began to see an increase in the prevalence of
food allergies," Nadeau said. "Modern hygiene is
probably also a factor," she added.
"As we move forward with generations, things are
getting worse and worse, with a steady rise of food al
lergies and asthma," Nadeau said. "TTiere's an entire
profile of a nation that's becoming more allergic."
According to the California Secretary of State
website, the ballot initiative would "require labeling
on raw or processed food offered for sale to con
sumers if made from plants or animals with genetic
material changed in specific ways."
The initiative would exempt certain foods from
being labeled such as certified organic food, products
of animals that ate or were dosed with genetically
modified material and foods that are "processed with
or containing only small amounts of genetically mod
ified ingredients."

The Secretary of State website indicates that the
fiscal impact would be a "potential increase in state

administrative costs of up to one million dollars an
nually to monitor compliance with the disclosure re
quirements specified in the measure." Legal costs
due to "possible violations to the provisions of this
measure" to the courts and attorney general could
add up to "potentially significant costs."
Ruthie Schwab MBA 'l3, president of the Gradu
ate School of Business Food and Agricultural Re
source Management Club, said she views informing
consumers and clearly labeling food as the best poli
cy. Schwab highlighted implications on a national
and governmental level, nothing that "it ensures a
higher level of transparency and accountability
along supply chains, which can be valuable from a
food safety perspective."

"While in the short term it may create an initial
