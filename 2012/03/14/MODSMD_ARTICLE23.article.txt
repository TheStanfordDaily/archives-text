## NOT DONE YET CARDINAL STOMPS CLEVELAND STATE 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
With a dominant second-half performance
on Tuesday, the Stanford men's basketball
team captured its first postseason win in three
years with a 76-65 victory over Cleveland
State in the first round of the National Invita
tion Tournament (NIT).
Led by sophomore guard Aaron Bright's
17 points and complimented by sophomore
Anthony Brown and senior forward Josh
Owens, who both added 15 points, the Cardi
nal (22-11,10-8 Pac-12) blew away the Vikings
(22-11, 12-6 Horizon) down the stretch to
cruise to the second round of the nation's sec
ond-best postseason tournament.
After Viking guard Tim Kamczyc made a
three-pointer to give Cleveland State a 33-31
lead just 11 seconds into the second half, Stan
ford rode the trio of Bright, Brown and Owens
on a 27-9 run over the next 10 minutes to bury
the Vikings for good.
Bright gave the Cardinal a much-needed
spark on Tuesday, racking up all 17 of his
points in the second half by going 4-for-7 from
the field and 8-for-10 from the free-throw line,
while also adding three assists and two steals
to his stat line.
Bright's quality performance off the pine
may have been the only one that outshone
Brown, though, as the sophomore from Foun
tain Valley, Calif., added a career-high 12 re
bounds to his 15 points and had three assists of
his own.
On the whole, the Cardinal had one of its
most efficient offensive nights all season,
going 24-of-49 from the floor, even though it
was out-rebounded by 40-31 margin, includ
ing a 13-5 differential on the offensive glass.
While Bright, Brown and Owens were rock
solid all night, the Vikings also were their own
worst enemy on Tuesday night, as they turned
the ball over 21 times, a number that stood in
stark contrast to the Cardinal's 12 turnovers.
Additionally, Cleveland State may have been
hampered by the loss of senior guard Trey
Harmon, who limped off the court early in the
second half, although he was a dismal 0-for-7
from the floor before he headed to the locker
room.
The Vikings turned the ball over nine times
in the game's first 12 minutes, while the Cardi
nal took advantage of those mistakes to get off

to a hot start. Just six minutes into the game,
Stanford held a 17-7 lead, but Cleveland State
answered with a rally of its own moments
later. Led by guard Jeremy Montgomery, who
finished the day with 15 points, the Vikings
tied the score at 18 just four minutes later.
From there, the teams traded baskets until
freshman guard Chasson Randle hit a three
with 10 seconds left in the half to give Stanford
a 31-30 lead going into the break.

The Cardinal will now play the winner of
Mississippi and Illinois State, but must wait
until tonight to find out whether it will travel
to Oxford, Miss., to play the No. 1 seed Rebels
or welcome the No. 8 seed Redbirds into
Maples next week. Mississippi and Illinois
State play tonight in Oxford at 6:30 p.m. PST.
