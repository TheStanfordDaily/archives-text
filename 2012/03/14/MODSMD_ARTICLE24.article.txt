## Pac-12 title back to Farm OGWUMIKES KEY TO TITLE WIN OVER CAL 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At the Staples Center in Los An
geles over the weekend, the Stanford
women's basketball team captured its
ninth conference tournament title
and the inaugural Pac-12 tournament
crown by defeating rival Cal 77-62
in Saturday's final.
On Friday, the No. 2 Cardinal (31-
1,18-0 Pac-12) first had to overcome
a difficult test against Arizona State
(20-11,10-8 Pac-12), recording a sea
son-low in points in a 52-43 victory
over the Sun Devils.Then, in the final,
the Golden Bears (24-9,13-5) refused
to let Stanford walk away with the
game, threatening to rein the Card
back in throughout a physical con
test.
With the two wins, Stanford ex
tended its unbeaten run against Pac
-12 opposition to 78 games.
Both Ogwumike sisters recorded
double-doubles in both games, as sen
ior forward Nnemkadi led the team
in points both times with 24 against
ASU and 29 against Cal, and sopho
more forward Chiney narrowly out
rebounded her older sister with 13 in
each contest. The starting five made
every single point in both games, and
in the final, freshman guard Amber
Orrange picked up 13 points while
junior forward Joslyn Tinkle and
sophomore guard Toni Kokenis
grabbed nine points each.
In the semifinal, Arizona State's
pressing defense, which has held op
posing teams to an average of just
52.5 points this year, proved to be
tricky for Stanford. Following a 1-for
-7 shooting performance from the
field in the first half, the Card re
sponded to lead 29-15 by the break,
but its shooting woes returned in the
second period. It opened the half 0-
for-7 from the field and went almost nine
whole minutes without hitting a shot
from the floor.
Arizona State cut the lead back to just
seven points with a few minutes left, but
ultimately could not edge ahead of Stan
ford. When the Sun Devils began to send
the Cardinal to the charity stripe in order
to get possession back, Nneka and Tinkle
hit every free throw and moved the Car
dinal further ahead.
In Saturday's final, Cal was looking to
avenge the defeat it suffered less than a
week before in Berkeley. The Bears start
ed poorly, allowing the Cardinal to pull
out to an 11-3 lead in the opening three
minutes. Cal recovered to cause problems
for Stanford and closed to within six by
the half. Freshman guard Brittany Boyd
played her part, hitting three of Cal's five
first-half three-pointers.
After the break, Cal continued to
harry Stanford, playing a full-court press
and closing the gap to just four points, but
its success from outside completely dried
up as the Cardinal stretched back ahead.
With just under 10 minutes remaining,
though, the momentum seemed to be
switching back toward Berkeley, and
fouls began to look like they might hin
der Stanford's star sisters. However,
Nneka was not about to lose this game,
and the senior seized back control.
Nneka faces tough competition from
Baylor forward Brittney Griner and
Delaware forward Elena Delle Donne for
the National Player of the Year honor, but
Saturday's performance showed why she
might walk away with that title, including a
surprisingly strong performance from be
yond the arc. In her entire career, Nneka
had shot just 2-for-15 from three, but
stepped up to go 3-for-4 from deep to kill
off Cal's growing momentum.
"I think we were really just focused on
winning," Nneka said. "And as a team we
wanted to go out there and be aggressive.
I've worked on my three before and so I

tried my best to really perform for my
team tonight."
While Nneka's performance was the
one that grabbed headlines, sister
Chiney also showed her mettle through
out the contest. The Golden Bears tar
geted the pair, looking to draw fouls and
reduce their time on the court with foul
trouble. In part this worked, as Chiney
went down with an elbow to her face in
the first half, and her older sister suf
fered the same fate in the second. Addi
tionally, the Bears' physical play kept
Chiney off the floor for a few minutes,
but even though both sisters suffered
four personal fouls, they kept their cool
to lead Stanford comfortably across the
finish line.
"Every game is great because every
one plays us competitively, but we try our
best to leave it all out on the floor,"
Nneka said.
It was a night full of highlights for
Nneka, as she passed Stanford legend
Candice Wiggins' conference tourna
ment points record on Saturday, even
though she played one less game than
Wiggins against conference competition.
"She is such a class individual," head
coach Tara VanDerveer said of Nneka.
"A great basketball player; a better per
son ... she does whatever our team
needs, and I just love coaching her and
love our whole team. That was a great
win for us."
For the first time in three years, Stan
ford will now head out on the road this
weekend for the first round of the
NCAA tournament, as Maples Pavilion
will not be hosting any action this year.
Instead, the Cardinal is the No. 1 seed in
the Fresno region and will head to Nor
folk, Va. to play No. 16 seed Hampton in
the first round on Saturday, March 17 at
10:30 p.m.PST.

field in the first half, the Card re
sponded to lead 29-15 by the break,
but its shooting woes returned in the
second period. It opened the half 0-
for-7 from the field and went almost nine
whole minutes without hitting a shot
from the floor.
Arizona State cut the lead back to just
seven points with a few minutes left, but
ultimately could not edge ahead of Stan
ford. When the Sun Devils began to send
the Cardinal to the charity stripe in order
to get possession back, Nneka and Tinkle
hit every free throw and moved the Car
dinal further ahead.
In Saturday's final, Cal was looking to
avenge the defeat it suffered less than a
week before in Berkeley. The Bears start
ed poorly, allowing the Cardinal to pull
out to an 11-3 lead in the opening three
minutes. Cal recovered to cause problems
for Stanford and closed to within six by
the half. Freshman guard Brittany Boyd
played her part, hitting three of Cal's five
first-half three-pointers.
After the break, Cal continued to
harry Stanford, playing a full-court press
and closing the gap to just four points, but
its success from outside completely dried
up as the Cardinal stretched back ahead.
With just under 10 minutes remaining,
though, the momentum seemed to be
switching back toward Berkeley, and
fouls began to look like they might hin
der Stanford's star sisters. However,
Nneka was not about to lose this game,
and the senior seized back control.
Nneka faces tough competition from
Baylor forward Brittney Griner and
Delaware forward Elena Delle Donne for
the National Player of the Year honor, but
Saturday's performance showed why she
might walk away with that title, including a
surprisingly strong performance from be
yond the arc. In her entire career, Nneka
had shot just 2-for-15 from three, but
stepped up to go 3-for-4 from deep to kill
off Cal's growing momentum.
"I think we were really just focused on
winning," Nneka said. "And as a team we
wanted to go out there and be aggressive.
I've worked on my three before and so I

tried my best to really perform for my
team tonight."
While Nneka's performance was the
one that grabbed headlines, sister
Chiney also showed her mettle through
out the contest. The Golden Bears tar
geted the pair, looking to draw fouls and
reduce their time on the court with foul
trouble. In part this worked, as Chiney
went down with an elbow to her face in
the first half, and her older sister suf
fered the same fate in the second. Addi
tionally, the Bears' physical play kept
Chiney off the floor for a few minutes,
but even though both sisters suffered
four personal fouls, they kept their cool
to lead Stanford comfortably across the
finish line.
"Every game is great because every
one plays us competitively, but we try our
best to leave it all out on the floor,"
Nneka said.
It was a night full of highlights for
Nneka, as she passed Stanford legend
Candice Wiggins' conference tourna
ment points record on Saturday, even
though she played one less game than
Wiggins against conference competition.
"She is such a class individual," head
coach Tara VanDerveer said of Nneka.
"A great basketball player; a better per
son ... she does whatever our team
needs, and I just love coaching her and
love our whole team. That was a great
win for us."
For the first time in three years, Stan
ford will now head out on the road this
weekend for the first round of the
NCAA tournament, as Maples Pavilion
will not be hosting any action this year.
Instead, the Cardinal is the No. 1 seed in
the Fresno region and will head to Nor
folk, Va. to play No. 16 seed Hampton in
the first round on Saturday, March 17 at
10:30 p.m.PST.

Sophomore forward Chiney Ogwumike (above), along with older sister Nnemkadi, steered the
Stanford women's basketball team to its ninth Pac-12 conference tournament title over the
weekend, defeating Arizona State 52-43 in the semifinals and beating Cal 77-62 in the final.
At the Staples Center in Los An
geles over the weekend, the Stanford
women's basketball team captured its
ninth conference tournament title
and the inaugural Pac-12 tournament
crown by defeating rival Cal 77-62
in Saturday's final.
On Friday, the No. 2 Cardinal (31-
1,18-0 Pac-12) first had to overcome
a difficult test against Arizona State
(20-11,10-8 Pac-12), recording a sea
son-low in points in a 52-43 victory
over the Sun Devils.Then, in the final,
the Golden Bears (24-9,13-5) refused
to let Stanford walk away with the
game, threatening to rein the Card
back in throughout a physical con
test.
With the two wins, Stanford ex
tended its unbeaten run against Pac
-12 opposition to 78 games.
Both Ogwumike sisters recorded
double-doubles in both games, as sen
ior forward Nnemkadi led the team
in points both times with 24 against
ASU and 29 against Cal, and sopho
more forward Chiney narrowly out
rebounded her older sister with 13 in
each contest. The starting five made
every single point in both games, and
in the final, freshman guard Amber
Orrange picked up 13 points while
junior forward Joslyn Tinkle and
sophomore guard Toni Kokenis
grabbed nine points each.
In the semifinal, Arizona State's
pressing defense, which has held op
posing teams to an average of just
52.5 points this year, proved to be
tricky for Stanford. Following a 1-for
-7 shooting performance from the
field in the first half, the Card re
