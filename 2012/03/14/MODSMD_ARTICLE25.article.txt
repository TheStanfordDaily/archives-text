# Quarterback race already narrowing
## 
### JACK BLANC HAT MANAGING EDITOR 
After the Stanford
football team's
first week of
spring practice
the first week
without Andrew Luck in over
three years redshirt junior
outside linebacker Chase
Thomas only had one word to
describe what it was like to be
back between the lines.
"It's weird. It was weird
coming out here the first day
of spring ball and not having
those guys out here," Thomas
said.
Unusual emotions aside,
the Cardinal completed its
first session of spring practice
on Saturday afternoon, mark
ing its first foray into a world
without number 12 running
the show. Naturally, all eyes
are on who will fill the void left
by Luck, and on the five quar
terbacks competing for Luck's
vacant spot.
After just a week of prac
tices, the open competition ap
pears to have narrowed down
to just two leaders sopho
more Brett Nottingham,
Luck's primary backup last
season, and junior Josh Nunes,
who was the primary backup
two seasons ago.
The two quarterbacks split
time with the first team of
fense and could both audible
to new plays at will throughout
Saturday's scrimmage, but
head coach David Shaw was
unwilling to claim that one
quarterback was nosing out
the other at this point.
"It's still pretty open; we'll
evaluate this [session], but
we're not gonna make any de
cisions during spring," Shaw
said. "It's just more informa
tion gathering. We tell them to
approach every single day like

it's a game. They're battling,
they're fighting it out. Both guys
have executed, both guys threw
some nice balls today, both guys
made a couple mistakes today."
In the first session of spring
practice, Shaw promised that all
five quarterbacks would get
equal practice reps, but the head
coach also mentioned that it
would be too hard to maintain
that egalitarian attitude when
the Cardinal returns to the prac
tice field after finals and spring
break. For now, that means that
Nunes and Nottingham will take
their duel for the starting spot
into the next practice session,
which begins on April 2.
While the quarterback duel
will continue to get most of the
attention as spring practice
winds along, Shaw also took time
to highlight that other position
groups did exist and were per
forming quite well.
"I would say the outside line
backers have just been phenom
enal, and the running back posi
tion too," Shaw said. "Even with
out Tyler Gaffney and without
Anthony Wilkerson, Stepfan
[Taylor] has been outstanding,
and Ricky Seale has been great."
Shaw also specifically high
lighted freshman Kelsey
Young's impressive first session,
as the Norco, Calif., native im
pressed at both wide receiver
and running back.
"He's been kind of that X
factor for us," Shaw said. "We've
moved him around a little bit
and he's shown speed and explo
siveness. We're not sure where
we're going to use him or how
we're going to use him, but he
made some plays out there
today."
"What we're going to do is
make sure he has some kind of a
package so he can help us," Shaw
continued.
Shaw also complimented the
play of the outside linebackers,
one of the most experienced and
talented groups on the team.
Thomas echoed his coach's senti
ment and attributed the de
fense's impressive play to the
smooth transition from last sea
son.
"Our defense is flying around
and playing around a lot faster
than I've seen us play in the
past," Thomas said. "I think that
just goes along with the experi
ence. We haven't had a change to
our defense like we did the last
couple years, so that definitely
allows us to play faster and more
aggressive up front."
Thomas also pointed out that
the secondary, which will have to

replace three departing starters
from the 2011 team, also had a
good first week.
"We might have lost three
guys, but I don't feel like we
did," Thomas said. "Barry
Browning and Terrence Brown
all played a significant amount
of football last year, same with
Devon Richards and Jordan
Carrington. And Wayne Lyons
was playing a good amount be
fore he got injured, so we have a
lot more depth and experience
back there than people give us
credit for."
But no matter how good both
sides of the ball looked in the
first practice session, Shaw said
that the offense in particular still
had a long way to go before it be
gins to look like a finished prod
uct, especially along the offen
sive line.
"There's nobody that's really
separated themselves at the
right guard or left tackle posi
tion, which would have been
nice if there was, but that just
leaves the competition open," he
said.
Shaw also added that the of
fense hadn't installed the entire
ty of its playbook, instead choos
ing to feed the playbook to the
new group of quarterbacks in
small, deliberate increments.
"We went this whole session
without putting in any red zone
on either side of the ba11... no
red zone, no short yardage, no
goal line. A lot of base and third
down was what this was about,
so we'll put in a little more situa
tions in the next session."
Shaw said the Cardinal would
also return a couple of players in
the second session of spring who
had been held out of the first ses
sion with injuries namely, de
fensive end Kevin Anderson and
linebacker Patrick Skov. Wide
receiver Ty Montgomery, who in
jured his hand during the first
week of practice, might also re
turn to the field in the second
session.
For now, while the Cardinal
players have three weeks off for
dead week, finals and spring
break, Shaw and his staff will
stay busy building for the future
of Cardinal football.
"We go full speed into recruit
ing," Shaw said. "We go right into
our spring recruiting. We'll eval
uate this session, start to script
and get ready for the next session
of spring, and start to get some
ideas ready for [fall's] training
camp."
ITie Cardinal will return to
the practice field on April 2 and
wrap up its spring practice on
April 14 with the annual Cardi
nal-White Spring Game at San
Francisco's Kezar Stadium.

Carrington. And Wayne Lyons
was playing a good amount be
fore he got injured, so we have a
lot more depth and experience
back there than people give us
credit for."
But no matter how good both
sides of the ball looked in the
first practice session, Shaw said
that the offense in particular still
had a long way to go before it be
gins to look like a finished prod
uct, especially along the offen
sive line.
"There's nobody that's really
separated themselves at the
right guard or left tackle posi
tion, which would have been
nice if there was, but that just
leaves the competition open," he
said.
Shaw also added that the of
fense hadn't installed the entire
ty of its playbook, instead choos
ing to feed the playbook to the
new group of quarterbacks in
small, deliberate increments.
"We went this whole session
without putting in any red zone
on either side of the ba11... no
red zone, no short yardage, no
goal line. A lot of base and third
down was what this was about,
so we'll put in a little more situa
tions in the next session."
Shaw said the Cardinal would
also return a couple of players in
the second session of spring who
had been held out of the first ses
sion with injuries namely, de
fensive end Kevin Anderson and
linebacker Patrick Skov. Wide
receiver Ty Montgomery, who in
jured his hand during the first
week of practice, might also re
turn to the field in the second
session.
For now, while the Cardinal
players have three weeks off for
dead week, finals and spring
break, Shaw and his staff will
stay busy building for the future
of Cardinal football.
"We go full speed into recruit
ing," Shaw said. "We go right into
our spring recruiting. We'll eval
uate this session, start to script
and get ready for the next session
of spring, and start to get some
ideas ready for [fall's] training
camp."
ITie Cardinal will return to
the practice field on April 2 and
wrap up its spring practice on
April 14 with the annual Cardi
nal-White Spring Game at San
Francisco's Kezar Stadium.

After the Stanford
football team's
first week of
spring practice
the first week
without Andrew Luck in over
three years redshirt junior
outside linebacker Chase
Thomas only had one word to
describe what it was like to be
back between the lines.
"It's weird. It was weird
coming out here the first day
of spring ball and not having
those guys out here," Thomas
said.
Unusual emotions aside,
the Cardinal completed its
first session of spring practice
on Saturday afternoon, mark
ing its first foray into a world
without number 12 running
the show. Naturally, all eyes
are on who will fill the void left
by Luck, and on the five quar
terbacks competing for Luck's
vacant spot.
After just a week of prac
tices, the open competition ap
pears to have narrowed down
to just two leaders sopho
more Brett Nottingham,
Luck's primary backup last
season, and junior Josh Nunes,
who was the primary backup
two seasons ago.
The two quarterbacks split
time with the first team of
fense and could both audible
to new plays at will throughout
Saturday's scrimmage, but
head coach David Shaw was
unwilling to claim that one
quarterback was nosing out
the other at this point.
"It's still pretty open; we'll
evaluate this [session], but
we're not gonna make any de
cisions during spring," Shaw
said. "It's just more informa
tion gathering. We tell them to
approach every single day like

it's a game. They're battling,
they're fighting it out. Both guys
have executed, both guys threw
some nice balls today, both guys
made a couple mistakes today."
In the first session of spring
practice, Shaw promised that all
five quarterbacks would get
equal practice reps, but the head
coach also mentioned that it
would be too hard to maintain
that egalitarian attitude when
the Cardinal returns to the prac
tice field after finals and spring
break. For now, that means that
Nunes and Nottingham will take
their duel for the starting spot
into the next practice session,
which begins on April 2.
While the quarterback duel
will continue to get most of the
attention as spring practice
winds along, Shaw also took time
to highlight that other position
groups did exist and were per
forming quite well.
"I would say the outside line
backers have just been phenom
enal, and the running back posi
tion too," Shaw said. "Even with
out Tyler Gaffney and without
Anthony Wilkerson, Stepfan
[Taylor] has been outstanding,
and Ricky Seale has been great."
Shaw also specifically high
lighted freshman Kelsey
Young's impressive first session,
as the Norco, Calif., native im
pressed at both wide receiver
and running back.
"He's been kind of that X
factor for us," Shaw said. "We've
moved him around a little bit
and he's shown speed and explo
siveness. We're not sure where
we're going to use him or how
we're going to use him, but he
made some plays out there
today."
"What we're going to do is
make sure he has some kind of a
package so he can help us," Shaw
continued.
Shaw also complimented the
play of the outside linebackers,
one of the most experienced and
talented groups on the team.
Thomas echoed his coach's senti
ment and attributed the de
fense's impressive play to the
smooth transition from last sea
son.
"Our defense is flying around
and playing around a lot faster
than I've seen us play in the
past," Thomas said. "I think that
just goes along with the experi
ence. We haven't had a change to
our defense like we did the last
couple years, so that definitely
allows us to play faster and more
aggressive up front."
Thomas also pointed out that
the secondary, which will have to

replace three departing starters
from the 2011 team, also had a
good first week.
"We might have lost three
guys, but I don't feel like we
did," Thomas said. "Barry
Browning and Terrence Brown
all played a significant amount
of football last year, same with
Devon Richards and Jordan
Carrington. And Wayne Lyons
was playing a good amount be
fore he got injured, so we have a
lot more depth and experience
back there than people give us
credit for."
