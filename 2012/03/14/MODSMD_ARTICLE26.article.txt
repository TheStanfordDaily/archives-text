# NIT: Where the real ballers are
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
It's finally mid-March, which
means you've set aside your
textbooks and notecards in
favor of something much
more important than finals:
March Madness. You've been por
ing over the bracket in front of you,
figuring out which low seeds can
find away to knock off the big boys
and which four teams will outlast
the rest to take the coveted spots at
the end.
You've probably heard all the
wisdom of past years: the team that
wants to be there more is the more
dangerous team, where you play
the games matters and seedings
don't mean nearly as much as indi
vidual matchups.
You might even have scouted
some of the teams. Drexel has won
25 of its past 27, lowa will be an un
derdog despite playing its first
game at home and Middle Ten
nessee State shoots 50 percent from
the field as a team.
Wait, those don't sound right to
you? Silly you. You're probably
thinking of that other tournament,
the one with 68 teams and all that
media hype.
I'm talking about the real March
Madness: the NIT.
I mean, seriously, the "Big
Dance" was dumb enough to leave
Stanford out for the fourth year in a
row, which shows you how flawed
