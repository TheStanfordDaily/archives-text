# NIT: Where the real ballers are
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
It's finally mid-March, which
means you've set aside your
textbooks and notecards in
favor of something much
more important than finals:
March Madness. You've been por
ing over the bracket in front of you,
figuring out which low seeds can
find away to knock off the big boys
and which four teams will outlast
the rest to take the coveted spots at
the end.
You've probably heard all the
wisdom of past years: the team that
wants to be there more is the more
dangerous team, where you play
the games matters and seedings
don't mean nearly as much as indi
vidual matchups.
You might even have scouted
some of the teams. Drexel has won
25 of its past 27, lowa will be an un
derdog despite playing its first
game at home and Middle Ten
nessee State shoots 50 percent from
the field as a team.
Wait, those don't sound right to
you? Silly you. You're probably
thinking of that other tournament,
the one with 68 teams and all that
media hype.
I'm talking about the real March
Madness: the NIT.
I mean, seriously, the "Big
Dance" was dumb enough to leave
Stanford out for the fourth year in a
row, which shows you how flawed

that tournament is. But as Stanford
fans, it's probably better this way.
Think about it: The NIT doesn't
have any teams with losing
records, but that other tourney
does. The champion of Stanford's
conference isn't wasting its time in
that 68-team field; it's in the NIT.
Fans of schools in the NIT get to
watch their teams play on campus
instead of paying hundreds of dol
lars to follow them around the
country like those supporters of
other schools. And you want the
toughest competition? Stanford is
5-3 against teams in The Tourna
ment That Must Not Be Named,
but the Cardinal is 0-4 against NIT

teams. Challenge accepted.
So with all the media idiotically
focused on You Know What, you
probably haven't gotten a real
sense of what March Madness is all
about. Luckily for you, here's a
glimpse at what the NIT has in store
for true college basketball fans this
month.
The format is simple. Rather
than having crazy play-in games
and regional sites, the NIT works
like this: 32 teams are split up into
four brackets of eight teams each,
and the teams are seeded one
through eight. For the first three
rounds, the games take place at the
home of the team with the better
seed (except Dayton, which unfor
tunately sold out to The Man and
has to play all its games on the road
because its arena is hosting the
other tournament). The real Final
Four teams will square off in the

most famous arena in the world:
Madison Square Garden. Yep, the
NIT plays its basketball games in a
basketball arena, not a football sta
dium.
Washington, Tennessee, Seton
Hall and Arizona are the four No. 1
seeds, with Dayton, Miami, St.
Joseph's and Ole Miss as the No. 2
seeds. Stanford checks in at a No. 3
seed, giving the Cardinal a first
round home game Tuesday against
sixth-seeded Cleveland State. Ore
gon is also a No. 3 seed, giving the
Pac-12 four bids, tied with the At
lantic-10 for the most in the tour
nament.
In order for any team to hoist the
trophy, it will need to win five
games. For Stanford, if seedings
hold, that would mean a home win
over Cleveland State, road wins
over Ole Miss and Arizona and neu
tral-site wins over Seton Hall and ei

ther Washington or Tennessee.
Of course, as in any tournament,
upsets will greatly alter the expect
ed matchups. Ole Miss could have
its hands full with Illinois State, a
team whose 13-loss record is
skewed by five losses to Wichita
State and Creighton. Oral Roberts
will be a very difficult second
round matchup for Arizona after
winning 20 of its past 22 contests.
Either of these potential upsets
could pave the way for Stanford to
play more home games and possi
bly advance all the way to the finals.
In other parts of the bracket,
teams are lurking for a potential
run to the title. Northwestern,
sporting a well-known drought of
never having reached the NIT
semifinals, could ruin Washington's
tournament in the second round,
while Tennessee could face a daunt
ing challenge from in-state rival

Middle Tennessee State, which en
ters the tournament at 25-6 on the
year. And don't sleep on Mississip
pi State. The fourth-seeded Bull
dogs have lost six of their past eight,
but they still boast wins over No. 1
seeds Arizona and Tennessee,
So there are some hints for all
your bracket competitions. This
seems like a year of upsets, so I en
vision only one No. 1 seed reaching
Madison Square Garden, with a
team from a smaller conference
eventually winning the crown.
No matter who wins, though, the
NIT will surely make college bas
ketball fans forget about that other
tournament.

pi State. The fourth-seeded Bull
dogs have lost six of their past eight,
but they still boast wins over No. 1
seeds Arizona and Tennessee,
So there are some hints for all
your bracket competitions. This
seems like a year of upsets, so I en
vision only one No. 1 seed reaching
Madison Square Garden, with a
team from a smaller conference
eventually winning the crown.
No matter who wins, though, the
NIT will surely make college bas
ketball fans forget about that other
tournament.

It's finally mid-March, which
means you've set aside your
textbooks and notecards in
favor of something much
more important than finals:
March Madness. You've been por
ing over the bracket in front of you,
figuring out which low seeds can
find away to knock off the big boys
and which four teams will outlast
the rest to take the coveted spots at
the end.
You've probably heard all the
wisdom of past years: the team that
wants to be there more is the more
dangerous team, where you play
the games matters and seedings
don't mean nearly as much as indi
vidual matchups.
You might even have scouted
some of the teams. Drexel has won
25 of its past 27, lowa will be an un
derdog despite playing its first
game at home and Middle Ten
nessee State shoots 50 percent from
the field as a team.
Wait, those don't sound right to
you? Silly you. You're probably
thinking of that other tournament,
the one with 68 teams and all that
media hype.
I'm talking about the real March
Madness: the NIT.
I mean, seriously, the "Big
Dance" was dumb enough to leave
Stanford out for the fourth year in a
row, which shows you how flawed

that tournament is. But as Stanford
fans, it's probably better this way.
Think about it: The NIT doesn't
have any teams with losing
records, but that other tourney
does. The champion of Stanford's
conference isn't wasting its time in
that 68-team field; it's in the NIT.
Fans of schools in the NIT get to
watch their teams play on campus
instead of paying hundreds of dol
lars to follow them around the
country like those supporters of
other schools. And you want the
toughest competition? Stanford is
5-3 against teams in The Tourna
ment That Must Not Be Named,
but the Cardinal is 0-4 against NIT

teams. Challenge accepted.
So with all the media idiotically
focused on You Know What, you
probably haven't gotten a real
sense of what March Madness is all
about. Luckily for you, here's a
glimpse at what the NIT has in store
for true college basketball fans this
month.
The format is simple. Rather
than having crazy play-in games
and regional sites, the NIT works
like this: 32 teams are split up into
four brackets of eight teams each,
and the teams are seeded one
through eight. For the first three
rounds, the games take place at the
home of the team with the better
seed (except Dayton, which unfor
tunately sold out to The Man and
has to play all its games on the road
because its arena is hosting the
other tournament). The real Final
Four teams will square off in the

most famous arena in the world:
Madison Square Garden. Yep, the
NIT plays its basketball games in a
basketball arena, not a football sta
dium.
Washington, Tennessee, Seton
Hall and Arizona are the four No. 1
seeds, with Dayton, Miami, St.
Joseph's and Ole Miss as the No. 2
seeds. Stanford checks in at a No. 3
seed, giving the Cardinal a first
round home game Tuesday against
sixth-seeded Cleveland State. Ore
gon is also a No. 3 seed, giving the
Pac-12 four bids, tied with the At
lantic-10 for the most in the tour
nament.
In order for any team to hoist the
trophy, it will need to win five
games. For Stanford, if seedings
hold, that would mean a home win
over Cleveland State, road wins
over Ole Miss and Arizona and neu
tral-site wins over Seton Hall and ei

ther Washington or Tennessee.
Of course, as in any tournament,
upsets will greatly alter the expect
ed matchups. Ole Miss could have
its hands full with Illinois State, a
team whose 13-loss record is
skewed by five losses to Wichita
State and Creighton. Oral Roberts
will be a very difficult second
round matchup for Arizona after
winning 20 of its past 22 contests.
Either of these potential upsets
could pave the way for Stanford to
play more home games and possi
bly advance all the way to the finals.
In other parts of the bracket,
teams are lurking for a potential
run to the title. Northwestern,
sporting a well-known drought of
never having reached the NIT
semifinals, could ruin Washington's
tournament in the second round,
while Tennessee could face a daunt
ing challenge from in-state rival

Middle Tennessee State, which en
ters the tournament at 25-6 on the
year. And don't sleep on Mississip
pi State. The fourth-seeded Bull
dogs have lost six of their past eight,
but they still boast wins over No. 1
seeds Arizona and Tennessee,
