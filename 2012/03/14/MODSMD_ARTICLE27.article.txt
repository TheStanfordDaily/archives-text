# Nneka, Chiney all Card needs

Candice Wiggins set Stan
ford and Pac-12 scoring
records and took home
the Wade Trophy. Jayne
Appel put up the best ca
reer marks in school history in both
boards and blocks. Kayla Pedersen
stole the rebound crown from
Appel a year later and was one of
the Cardinal's three leading scorers
for the fourth straight season.
Jeanette Pohlen set a Stanford
record for most three-pointers in a
season in 2010-11 and engineered
the Cardinal's 71-59 win over
UConn to break the Huskies' 90-
game win streak.
All four were top-10 WNBA
Draft picks. They combined for 12
Final Four appearances. And none
of them could win a national title at
Stanford.
So with the No. 2 Stanford (31-1)
women's basketball team ap
proaching the NCAA tournament
as a No. 1 seed for the third straight
year, are we just weeks away from
adding Nnemkadi Ogwumike's
name to that list?
On paper, the case for Stanford
as this year's NCAA champion
after the Cardinal has come up short
for four straight years doesn't
seem all that convincing at first. This
is the first season since 2005-06 that
Stanford doesn't have three players
averaging in double figures in scor
ing, and the squad looked out
matched earlier this season against
perennial contender Connecticut,
which kept the Cardinal from a title
in the championship game two sea
sons ago. Stanford also sunk its
fewest three-pointers in four years
this season, falling well short of its
average during the last four Final
Four seasons.
Instead, the Cardinal is led by a
pair of double-double machines
down low in the Ogwumike sisters,
Nneka and sophomore sister
Chiney Ogwumike, Each has scored
and rebounded in double figures 17
times, with both sisters posting dou
ble-doubles in the same game on
nine occasions and Chiney accom
plishing the feat in all three Pac-12
tournament games.
Even though strong rebounding
is hardly strange for a team coached
by Tara VanDerveer, the Ogwu
