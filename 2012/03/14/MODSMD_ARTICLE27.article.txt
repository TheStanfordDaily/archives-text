# Nneka, Chiney all Card needs

### Joseph Beyda 
Candice Wiggins set Stan
ford and Pac-12 scoring
records and took home
the Wade Trophy. Jayne
Appel put up the best ca
reer marks in school history in both
boards and blocks. Kayla Pedersen
stole the rebound crown from
Appel a year later and was one of
the Cardinal's three leading scorers
for the fourth straight season.
Jeanette Pohlen set a Stanford
record for most three-pointers in a
season in 2010-11 and engineered
the Cardinal's 71-59 win over
UConn to break the Huskies' 90-
game win streak.
All four were top-10 WNBA
Draft picks. They combined for 12
Final Four appearances. And none
of them could win a national title at
Stanford.
So with the No. 2 Stanford (31-1)
women's basketball team ap
proaching the NCAA tournament
as a No. 1 seed for the third straight
year, are we just weeks away from
adding Nnemkadi Ogwumike's
name to that list?
On paper, the case for Stanford
as this year's NCAA champion
after the Cardinal has come up short
for four straight years doesn't
seem all that convincing at first. This
is the first season since 2005-06 that
Stanford doesn't have three players
averaging in double figures in scor
ing, and the squad looked out
matched earlier this season against
perennial contender Connecticut,
which kept the Cardinal from a title
in the championship game two sea
sons ago. Stanford also sunk its
fewest three-pointers in four years
this season, falling well short of its
average during the last four Final
Four seasons.
Instead, the Cardinal is led by a
pair of double-double machines
down low in the Ogwumike sisters,
Nneka and sophomore sister
Chiney Ogwumike, Each has scored
and rebounded in double figures 17
times, with both sisters posting dou
ble-doubles in the same game on
nine occasions and Chiney accom
plishing the feat in all three Pac-12
tournament games.
Even though strong rebounding
is hardly strange for a team coached
by Tara VanDerveer, the Ogwu
mikes' dominance at the post de
fines Stanford's offense this year.
The Cardinal has been getting to
the line consistently and is shooting
free throws at a .767 clip, its highest
percentage since 2003-04 and 10
percent better than its rate just
three seasons ago.
Stanford's turnover numbers
have improved as well; the Cardinal
gives the ball up fewer than 13 times
a game, a statistic that reached as
high as 15 three years ago.Two give
aways might not seem like much,
but last year's 63-62 Final Four loss
to Texas A&M in which Stan
ford turned the ball over 22 times to
the Aggies' 12 made the impor
tance of avoiding turnovers readily
apparent. The Ogwumikes have set
an example in this area as well, com
bining for just 131 turnovers in 32
games played; by contrast, Pohlen
alone gave the ball up 111 times as
the 2011 Pac-10 Player of the Year.
But as steadily as the Ogwu
mike sisters have played, it's the
Stanford bench that will likely
make the biggest difference this

postseason. Neither Chiney nor
Nneka averages over 30 minutes
per game, while each of the past
four Final Four teams had at least
two players who did so. This year's
team relies more on its depth,
which could be key in winning six
games in two weeks en route to the
championship. A strong support
ing cast is useful in and of itself, but
getting the Ogwumike sisters off
the floor for a periodic breather
keeps them energized and makes
them that much more dangerous
for opponents.
Nobody's expecting an early exit
for Stanford this year, and rightfully
so, as the squad steamrolled the rest
of the weak Pac-12 with yet another
perfect conference season. It's all
about what happens when the Car
dinal makes it to the late rounds.
And even without a Wiggins, an
Appel, a Pedersen or a Pohlen on its
side, Stanford has all it needs to fi
nally bring home its third national
title in women's basketball: two Og
wumikes.

Joseph Bey da feels more confident
about the Ogwumike sisters than
even his own soon-to-be-perfect
March Madness bracket. Send him

for Stanford this year, and rightfully
so, as the squad steamrolled the rest
of the weak Pac-12 with yet another
perfect conference season. It's all
about what happens when the Car
dinal makes it to the late rounds.
And even without a Wiggins, an
Appel, a Pedersen or a Pohlen on its
side, Stanford has all it needs to fi
nally bring home its third national
title in women's basketball: two Og
wumikes.

Candice Wiggins set Stan
ford and Pac-12 scoring
records and took home
the Wade Trophy. Jayne
Appel put up the best ca
reer marks in school history in both
boards and blocks. Kayla Pedersen
stole the rebound crown from
Appel a year later and was one of
the Cardinal's three leading scorers
for the fourth straight season.
Jeanette Pohlen set a Stanford
record for most three-pointers in a
season in 2010-11 and engineered
the Cardinal's 71-59 win over
UConn to break the Huskies' 90-
game win streak.
All four were top-10 WNBA
Draft picks. They combined for 12
Final Four appearances. And none
of them could win a national title at
Stanford.
So with the No. 2 Stanford (31-1)
women's basketball team ap
proaching the NCAA tournament
as a No. 1 seed for the third straight
year, are we just weeks away from
adding Nnemkadi Ogwumike's
name to that list?
On paper, the case for Stanford
as this year's NCAA champion
after the Cardinal has come up short
for four straight years doesn't
seem all that convincing at first. This
is the first season since 2005-06 that
Stanford doesn't have three players
averaging in double figures in scor
ing, and the squad looked out
matched earlier this season against
perennial contender Connecticut,
which kept the Cardinal from a title
in the championship game two sea
sons ago. Stanford also sunk its
fewest three-pointers in four years
this season, falling well short of its
average during the last four Final
Four seasons.
Instead, the Cardinal is led by a
pair of double-double machines
down low in the Ogwumike sisters,
Nneka and sophomore sister
Chiney Ogwumike, Each has scored
and rebounded in double figures 17
times, with both sisters posting dou
ble-doubles in the same game on
nine occasions and Chiney accom
plishing the feat in all three Pac-12
tournament games.
Even though strong rebounding
is hardly strange for a team coached
by Tara VanDerveer, the Ogwu
mikes' dominance at the post de
fines Stanford's offense this year.
The Cardinal has been getting to
the line consistently and is shooting
free throws at a .767 clip, its highest
percentage since 2003-04 and 10
percent better than its rate just
three seasons ago.
Stanford's turnover numbers
have improved as well; the Cardinal
gives the ball up fewer than 13 times
a game, a statistic that reached as
high as 15 three years ago.Two give
aways might not seem like much,
but last year's 63-62 Final Four loss
to Texas A&M in which Stan
ford turned the ball over 22 times to
the Aggies' 12 made the impor
tance of avoiding turnovers readily
apparent. The Ogwumikes have set
an example in this area as well, com
bining for just 131 turnovers in 32
games played; by contrast, Pohlen
alone gave the ball up 111 times as
the 2011 Pac-10 Player of the Year.
But as steadily as the Ogwu
mike sisters have played, it's the
Stanford bench that will likely
make the biggest difference this

postseason. Neither Chiney nor
Nneka averages over 30 minutes
per game, while each of the past
four Final Four teams had at least
two players who did so. This year's
team relies more on its depth,
which could be key in winning six
games in two weeks en route to the
championship. A strong support
ing cast is useful in and of itself, but
getting the Ogwumike sisters off
the floor for a periodic breather
keeps them energized and makes
them that much more dangerous
for opponents.
Nobody's expecting an early exit
for Stanford this year, and rightfully
so, as the squad steamrolled the rest
of the weak Pac-12 with yet another
perfect conference season. It's all
about what happens when the Car
dinal makes it to the late rounds.
And even without a Wiggins, an
Appel, a Pedersen or a Pohlen on its
side, Stanford has all it needs to fi
nally bring home its third national
title in women's basketball: two Og
wumikes.
