# ROLLING PAST RICE
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford baseball team concluded its
stellar non-conference season with a series win over
No. 4 Rice this weekend, moving to 13-2 on the year
after taking two of three from the Owls (13-4) at
Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal battled back from early Rice leads
on Friday and Saturday even with junior centerfield
er and team-leading .404 hitter Jake Stewart shelved
with a back injury, but then fell flat in a 1-0 Sunday fi
nale that left much to be desired from Stanford's
powerful bats. The three-game tilt marked the first
time that the Cardinal has failed to score 20 runs in a
weekend, and the three-through-six slots in the line
up had no hits on Friday and Sunday.
After cruising through one of the toughest non
conference schedules in the country, though, the Car
dinal is still the clear headliner in the competitive
Pac-12 leading into conference play later this month.
Stanford will benefit in Pac-12 play from some of
the depth it showed off Friday night, with junior
Justin Ringo inserted into the lineup in Stewart's
stead for just his ninth career start.
"I found out literally like 40 minutes before the
game [that I'd be starting]," Ringo said. "I was excit
ed, I was nervous, but through the game I got more
comfortable, and I just tried to do my thing."
Ringo would prove the hero in one of the Cardi
nal's tightest games of the season, which went into

extra innings with the score 2-2. Junior righthander
Mark Appel gave up just four hits and set a career
high in strikeouts (14) for the second straight week,
going nine full innings and keeping the Owls off the
scoreboard after they jumped out to a 2-0 first-inning
lead. A sac bunt by Ringo in the third frame put two
runners in scoring position, and they promptly came
home on a wild pitch and a groundout from junior
third baseman Stephen Piscotty, yet the Cardinal had
only mustered four hits entering the 10th inning.
Freshman closer David Schmidt bounced back
from a leadoff single in the 10th, and junior outfield
er Tyler Gaffney drew a one-out walk in Stanford's
half of the inning. Ringo came to the plate still look
ing for his first hit of the season, and instead walloped
the first pitch he saw over the right-field fence to win
the opener for the Cardinal.
"It's tough coming in,not playing every single day,
and just getting comfortable, and I was just missing
balls all game," he said. "I was joking about hitting a
walk-off earlier during the game, and when it hap
pened, I was in shock. I didn't know what to do. I just
ran as fast as I could around the bases."
Stanford's lineup ran away with the Saturday
clincher, scoring in every inning from the second to
the seventh in an 11-6 shootout that saw both teams
put up double digits in hits. Rice scored in the first
frame for the second straight game, but sophomore
shortstop Lonnie Kauppila singled home a run in the
