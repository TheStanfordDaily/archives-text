# ROLLING PAST RICE
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford baseball team concluded its
stellar non-conference season with a series win over
No. 4 Rice this weekend, moving to 13-2 on the year
after taking two of three from the Owls (13-4) at
Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal battled back from early Rice leads
on Friday and Saturday even with junior centerfield
er and team-leading .404 hitter Jake Stewart shelved
with a back injury, but then fell flat in a 1-0 Sunday fi
nale that left much to be desired from Stanford's
powerful bats. The three-game tilt marked the first
time that the Cardinal has failed to score 20 runs in a
weekend, and the three-through-six slots in the line
up had no hits on Friday and Sunday.
After cruising through one of the toughest non
conference schedules in the country, though, the Car
dinal is still the clear headliner in the competitive
Pac-12 leading into conference play later this month.
Stanford will benefit in Pac-12 play from some of
the depth it showed off Friday night, with junior
Justin Ringo inserted into the lineup in Stewart's
stead for just his ninth career start.
"I found out literally like 40 minutes before the
game [that I'd be starting]," Ringo said. "I was excit
ed, I was nervous, but through the game I got more
comfortable, and I just tried to do my thing."
Ringo would prove the hero in one of the Cardi
nal's tightest games of the season, which went into

extra innings with the score 2-2. Junior righthander
Mark Appel gave up just four hits and set a career
high in strikeouts (14) for the second straight week,
going nine full innings and keeping the Owls off the
scoreboard after they jumped out to a 2-0 first-inning
lead. A sac bunt by Ringo in the third frame put two
runners in scoring position, and they promptly came
home on a wild pitch and a groundout from junior
third baseman Stephen Piscotty, yet the Cardinal had
only mustered four hits entering the 10th inning.
Freshman closer David Schmidt bounced back
from a leadoff single in the 10th, and junior outfield
er Tyler Gaffney drew a one-out walk in Stanford's
half of the inning. Ringo came to the plate still look
ing for his first hit of the season, and instead walloped
the first pitch he saw over the right-field fence to win
the opener for the Cardinal.
"It's tough coming in,not playing every single day,
and just getting comfortable, and I was just missing
balls all game," he said. "I was joking about hitting a
walk-off earlier during the game, and when it hap
pened, I was in shock. I didn't know what to do. I just
ran as fast as I could around the bases."
Stanford's lineup ran away with the Saturday
clincher, scoring in every inning from the second to
the seventh in an 11-6 shootout that saw both teams
put up double digits in hits. Rice scored in the first
frame for the second straight game, but sophomore
shortstop Lonnie Kauppila singled home a run in the

bottom of the second, and junior
catcher Eric Smith doubled home
two more to make it 3-1. Piscotty
doubled in the third, and sopho
more first baseman Brian Ragira
singled him home in response to a
two-run Owl half of the inning, as
the Cardinal retook the lead.
After that rally, though, Stan
ford wouldn't relinquish the ad
vantage again. Kauppila and
Smith singled to lead off the
fourth and came home on sopho
more rightfielder Austin Wilson's
third home run of the season, a
long fly ball that cleared the left
field fence with ease. A leadoff
homer by Ragira in the fifth frame
for his third hit of the afternoon
made it 8-3, and Piscotty tacked
on another run by singling home
Gaffney.
A Smith double and Wilson sin
gle added two more runs in the sev
enth to cap Stanford's scoring, yet
Rice kept fighting, dinging up jun
ior reliever Dean McArdle for

three scores in two innings. But the
Cardinal had built enough of a lead
to get redshirt junior lefthander
Brett Mooneyham his fourth win
of the year, as the Atwater, Calif.,
native has yet to drop a decision in
his first four starts.
For all the offense on Saturday,
though, the series finale on Sunday
turned into a duel between two
freshman righthanders, Stanford's
John Hochstatter and Rice's Jor
dan Stephens.The pair put up near
ly identical lines: 6.2 innings
pitched, no earned runs, three
walks and two strikeouts apiece,
with neither allowing more than
five hits.
In the end it was the Cardinal's
defense that proved costly, as Pis
cotty made his sixth error of the
season to put a second Owl runner
on in the third with just one out.
Junior rightfielder Jeremy Rathjen
promptly singled home the game's
only run, and Stanford's offense
failed to back up Hochstatter (3-1),
who still has a dominant 1.09 ERA
in his first year on the Farm despite
his first career loss.

"[l-0 games] are the exciting
ones, and this time we fell on the
wrong side of it, but it's always fun

to compete like that," Hochstatter
told GoStanford.com. "It was a big
game, but I think taking the series
was big, and you've just got to look
forward. With a team like we have,
we're going to bounce back real
quick."
The Cardinal now has two
weeks off for finals before opening
the Pac-12 season at home against
USC. After a 7-0 start, the Trojans
(12-3) fell out of the rankings com
ing into last weekend thanks to
three straight losses against Pep
perdine and North Carolina, but
bounced back with a home sweep
of CSU Bakersfield and No. 9
UCLA in the third annual Dodger
town Classic on Tuesday night.
USC will actually begin its con
ference season a week in advance
of its trip to the Farm, hosting Utah
in a three-game tilt this coming
weekend.

The Cardinal and Trojans will
play next Saturday, Sunday and
Monday at Sunken Diamond, and
Stanford will continue its busy start
to spring quarter with a one-game
trip to UC-Davis on Tuesday.

season to put a second Owl runner
on in the third with just one out.
Junior rightfielder Jeremy Rathjen
promptly singled home the game's
only run, and Stanford's offense
failed to back up Hochstatter (3-1),
who still has a dominant 1.09 ERA
in his first year on the Farm despite
his first career loss.

"[l-0 games] are the exciting
ones, and this time we fell on the
wrong side of it, but it's always fun

to compete like that," Hochstatter
told GoStanford.com. "It was a big
game, but I think taking the series
was big, and you've just got to look
forward. With a team like we have,
we're going to bounce back real
quick."
The Cardinal now has two
weeks off for finals before opening
the Pac-12 season at home against
USC. After a 7-0 start, the Trojans
(12-3) fell out of the rankings com
ing into last weekend thanks to
three straight losses against Pep
perdine and North Carolina, but
bounced back with a home sweep
of CSU Bakersfield and No. 9
UCLA in the third annual Dodger
town Classic on Tuesday night.
USC will actually begin its con
ference season a week in advance
of its trip to the Farm, hosting Utah
in a three-game tilt this coming
weekend.

The Cardinal and Trojans will
play next Saturday, Sunday and
Monday at Sunken Diamond, and
Stanford will continue its busy start
to spring quarter with a one-game
trip to UC-Davis on Tuesday.

The No. 2 Stanford baseball team concluded its
stellar non-conference season with a series win over
No. 4 Rice this weekend, moving to 13-2 on the year
after taking two of three from the Owls (13-4) at
Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal battled back from early Rice leads
on Friday and Saturday even with junior centerfield
er and team-leading .404 hitter Jake Stewart shelved
with a back injury, but then fell flat in a 1-0 Sunday fi
nale that left much to be desired from Stanford's
powerful bats. The three-game tilt marked the first
time that the Cardinal has failed to score 20 runs in a
weekend, and the three-through-six slots in the line
up had no hits on Friday and Sunday.
After cruising through one of the toughest non
conference schedules in the country, though, the Car
dinal is still the clear headliner in the competitive
Pac-12 leading into conference play later this month.
Stanford will benefit in Pac-12 play from some of
the depth it showed off Friday night, with junior
Justin Ringo inserted into the lineup in Stewart's
stead for just his ninth career start.
"I found out literally like 40 minutes before the
game [that I'd be starting]," Ringo said. "I was excit
ed, I was nervous, but through the game I got more
comfortable, and I just tried to do my thing."
Ringo would prove the hero in one of the Cardi
nal's tightest games of the season, which went into

extra innings with the score 2-2. Junior righthander
Mark Appel gave up just four hits and set a career
high in strikeouts (14) for the second straight week,
going nine full innings and keeping the Owls off the
scoreboard after they jumped out to a 2-0 first-inning
lead. A sac bunt by Ringo in the third frame put two
runners in scoring position, and they promptly came
home on a wild pitch and a groundout from junior
third baseman Stephen Piscotty, yet the Cardinal had
only mustered four hits entering the 10th inning.
Freshman closer David Schmidt bounced back
from a leadoff single in the 10th, and junior outfield
er Tyler Gaffney drew a one-out walk in Stanford's
half of the inning. Ringo came to the plate still look
ing for his first hit of the season, and instead walloped
the first pitch he saw over the right-field fence to win
the opener for the Cardinal.
"It's tough coming in,not playing every single day,
and just getting comfortable, and I was just missing
balls all game," he said. "I was joking about hitting a
walk-off earlier during the game, and when it hap
pened, I was in shock. I didn't know what to do. I just
ran as fast as I could around the bases."
Stanford's lineup ran away with the Saturday
clincher, scoring in every inning from the second to
the seventh in an 11-6 shootout that saw both teams
put up double digits in hits. Rice scored in the first
frame for the second straight game, but sophomore
shortstop Lonnie Kauppila singled home a run in the

bottom of the second, and junior
catcher Eric Smith doubled home
two more to make it 3-1. Piscotty
doubled in the third, and sopho
more first baseman Brian Ragira
singled him home in response to a
two-run Owl half of the inning, as
the Cardinal retook the lead.
After that rally, though, Stan
ford wouldn't relinquish the ad
vantage again. Kauppila and
Smith singled to lead off the
fourth and came home on sopho
more rightfielder Austin Wilson's
third home run of the season, a
long fly ball that cleared the left
field fence with ease. A leadoff
homer by Ragira in the fifth frame
for his third hit of the afternoon
made it 8-3, and Piscotty tacked
on another run by singling home
Gaffney.
A Smith double and Wilson sin
gle added two more runs in the sev
enth to cap Stanford's scoring, yet
Rice kept fighting, dinging up jun
ior reliever Dean McArdle for

three scores in two innings. But the
Cardinal had built enough of a lead
to get redshirt junior lefthander
Brett Mooneyham his fourth win
of the year, as the Atwater, Calif.,
native has yet to drop a decision in
his first four starts.
For all the offense on Saturday,
though, the series finale on Sunday
turned into a duel between two
freshman righthanders, Stanford's
John Hochstatter and Rice's Jor
dan Stephens.The pair put up near
ly identical lines: 6.2 innings
pitched, no earned runs, three
walks and two strikeouts apiece,
with neither allowing more than
five hits.
In the end it was the Cardinal's
defense that proved costly, as Pis
cotty made his sixth error of the
season to put a second Owl runner
on in the third with just one out.
Junior rightfielder Jeremy Rathjen
