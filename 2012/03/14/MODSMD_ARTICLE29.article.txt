# Cardinal clobbers Bulldogs
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
After more than 10 days off from compe
tition, the Stanford men's tennis team
looked sharp on Saturday, dispatching the
Yale Bulldogs five points to two. The Cardi
nal will now have another two weeks off be
fore play really starts to take off in anticipa
tion of the NCAA Championship in May.

Stanford (10-4) continued its
strong play following the return of senior
All-American Bradley Klahn. Sophomore
Denis Lin has been one of the players who
has benefited from Klahn's return, now
playing out of the No. 4 position, instead of
the more competitive No. 3.
"Having BK back is huge for our team,"
Lin said. "With his talent and ability to win
at the top of the singles and doubles lineups,
we all feel a lot more confident in our team's
ability to win any match that we play. It helps
our confidence immensely now that BK is
back, and we really feel like we'll be able to
compete with the best once May comes
around."
Saturday's win was important for keep
ing the team's momentum alive. A loss to
unranked Yale going into the three-week
break would surely have damaged the Car
dinal's confidence. Instead, the squad now
has a chance to rest up, recuperate and start
looking ahead to May.
Lin voiced similar sentiments after the

match.
"This was definitely an important win for
us going into Dead Week and finals week,"
Lin said. "Even though Yale was an un
ranked team, they were still tough to play,
especially with a lot of local friends and fam
ily cheering them on. It was also our first
match after the La Jolla doubles tourna
ment, so it was nice to get a win after a cou
ple of weeks off from dual-match competi
tion."
In the match, Stanford got off to a fantas
tic start. At the top of the doubles lineup,
Klahn and Thacher dominated their way to
an 8-1 win. Their victory was soon followed
up by an 8-3 win from the No. 2 doubles
team of Lin and partner Matt Kandath. The
freshmen duo of Robert Stineman and John
Morrissey then completed the doubles
sweep by winning 8-5 on the third court.

The singles play went nearly just as well
for the Cardinal. Morrissey, Stineman and
Klahn quickly dispatched their Bulldog op
ponents in straight sets, locking up the
match victory for Stanford and making the
final three matches formalities. Head Coach
John Whitlinger was confident enough in
the singles play of his team to rest senior
Ryan Thacher, normally Stanford's No. 2
player behind Klahn.
The tennis team will now focus on rest
ing, practice and academics in their 18-day
break from competition. Upon returning
from spring break, the team heads right out
on a three-match road trip: Pepperdine on
March 28, Arizona on March 30 and Utah on
April 1.
