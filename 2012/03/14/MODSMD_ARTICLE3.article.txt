# LSJUMB reacts to alcohol suspension
## Irreverent group faces post-Fiesta Bowl sanction 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (LSJUMB)
V was placed on alcohol suspension Feb. 6
by the Office for Student Affairs, following
ncidents surrounding the abuse of alcohol at
the Fiesta Bowl, according to band manag
er Brian Kooiman 'l2.

"There were several alcohol-related inci
dents at the Fiesta Bowl that led to alcohol sus
pension," Kooiman said in an email to The Daily.
Kooiman denied, however, that the LSJUMB
has had an unusual amount of alcohol-related
accidents or hospitalizations this year.
When asked how the LSJUMB has respond
ed to the incidents in order to prevent similar

ones from occurring in the future,
Kooiman said, "We are currently
following our alcohol suspen
sion."
University policy for alcohol
suspension requires that all organ
ization activities and events be al
cohol-free, according to Chris
Griffith, associate vice provost
and dean of student life.
"Other than events planned by
the organization for its members,
it can be difficult for non-housed
groups to define what activities
constitute an organization event,"
Griffith said in an email to The
Daily. "We trust that they will
abide by expectations and will
consult with us if they have ques
tions."
This is not the first time that
the Office of Student Affairs has
imposed an alcohol suspension
on the LSJUMB. Griffith said
that the Band was placed on in
definite provisional status in
cluding alcohol suspension in
2006 after band members vandal
ized and destroyed the Band
Shak.
Griffith said that the current
alcohol suspension will be re
viewed at the end of Spring Quar
ter.
Band member reaction
Citing directions from
LSJUMB staff that discouraged
non-staff members from talking
to the press, several band mem
bers declined to speak to The
Daily.
Responding to the imposition
of the alcohol suspension, howev
er, one member sent out an email
to the Band's email list express
ing frustration with the LSJUMB
staffs non-resistance to Univer

sity regulations. Noting their tra
dition of irreverence, the student
argued that the Band should
challenge the University's judg
ments rather than comply with
them.
The email thread received
over 100 responses in one night.
The imposition of the alcohol
suspension has unintentionally
coincided with the University ter
minating the independent lease
of Chi Theta Chi, a co-op which
one band member said has tradi
tionally housed an unusually high
proportion of band participants.
With this development along
with separate regulations the
University has recently placed
upon band operations related to
transportation, field show regula
tions and the Band's internal dis
ciplinary management other
band members said they felt frus
trated with the University in
more ways than one.
Alleged hijinks
The abuse of alcohol was not
been the only controversy involv
ing the LSJUMB's behavior at
the Fiesta Bowl.
Following Stanford's defeat in
the football game, the former
drum major continued to call
songs during the presentation of
the trophy and the playing of
Oklahoma State's alma mater,
disrupting the awards ceremony
and riling fans of both teams. Sev
eral members of the audience
tweeted about the Band's inter
ference, and many posted com
plaints online.
Although OSU fan Mark
Lash acknowledged the joviality
of the halftime show's "trash
talk," Lash wrote on his blog that
the post-game behavior of the
LSJUMB was "offensive, disre
spectful and way out of line."
Lash posted a letter that he
had written to the Stanford Ath
letic Department, saying that he

had heard that members of the
band mimed a plane crash during
the halftime show, a reference to
the crash that killed the coach
and assistant coach of OSU's
women's basketball team this
November.
However, one LSJUMB
member, who wished to remain
anonymous, gave an opposing ac
count, saying that a few band
members ran onto the field with
extended arms, like they do at
every halftime show before get
ting into formation, and that they
did not intend any such allusion.
"Running onto the fields with
your arms out is a lot different
than mimicking a plane crash,"
the source said.
According to the band mem
ber, Lash's complaint about the
Band's conduct at the Fiesta
Bowl was one of about 80 re
ceived by the University. Griffith,
however, said that the exact
count is unknown due to the dis
persion of complaints among ad
ministrative departments and of
fices.
"We replied and expressed
our apologies for disrupting the
award ceremony," Griffith said of
the University's response. "We
are working closely with the
Band leadership to develop pro
tocols that will alleviate the possi
bility of similar occurrences in
the future,"
A band member also set off
small explosives at the Phoenix
Zoo preceding the Band's Fiesta
Bowl performance, according to
two other band members who
also wished to remain anony
mous.
LSJUMB staff declined to
comment about delaying the
award ceremony and about the
alleged use of small explosives at
the Phoenix Zoo.
