## Pair of weekend victories MEN, WOMEN BOTH TAKE HOME WINS 
### CONNOR SCHERER STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's gymnastics
team had a busy weekend, facing Ohio
State on Friday and then wrapping up its
regular season against University of Illi
nois-Chicago on Sunday.
The Cardinal had a tough test on Fri
day against No. 5 Ohio State, but han
dled the challenge with ease and beat
the Buckeyes 355.800-347.400. This
meet marked the third consecutive
meet that the Cardinal has posted a sea
son-high score, beating its previous high
of 351.400, which it tallied last week in a
loss to the No. 1 University of Oklaho
ma.
Stanford won five of the six events
against Ohio State, led by Junior Eddie
Penev, who won the all-around compe
tition with a score of 87.750 and the indi
vidual floor exercise with a 15.650. Jun
ior James Fosco won rings (15.500),
sophomore Cale Robinson won vault
(15.500) and junior Cameron Foreman
won high bar (15.200) and parallel bars
(14.750). Robinson's vault score tied a
season-best for the Cardinal, while
Foreman's high bar score set a new sea
son-high.
In its second meet of the weekend,
the Cardinal nearly eclipsed its
season-high score once again,
beating host University of Illinois-
Chicago 355.500-337.800 in an
easy win to close out the regular
season.
Stanford won all six team
events and had five individual win
ners: junior John Martin on pom
mel horse (15.700), Fosco on rings
(16.000), freshman Sean Senters
on vault (14.900), Foreman on par
allel bars (15.200) and Penev on
high bar (14.400).
The Cardinal next competes on
April 7 at the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Championships
in Colorado. The extended break
will help the team recover some of
its injured competitors and allow
the squad to field a more complete
squad as playoffs begin.
In addition to the men's team
capturing a pair of wins this week
end, the No. 11 Stanford women's
gymnastics team wrapped up its
regular season at Arizona State on
Friday by earning its third consec
utive victory. The Cardinal
eclipsed the Sun Devils by a score
of 196.475-194.975 and extended

its winning streak over the Sun
Devils to 19 matches.
The meet was highlighted by
the Cardinal's effort on beam, as
the team posted a season-high
49.350 in the event, beating its pre
vious best score of 49.175. Only
twice has the team had a better
event score than 49.350, both
49.400s on the uneven bars. Senior
Alyssa Brown won the event with
a score of 9.925, one of three scores
of 9.9 or better in the event. Soph
omore Amanda Spinner and
freshman Ivana Hong both scored
9.900s on beam, as all three either
set or tied their season-high scores
in the event.
Senior Nicole Pechanec post
ed a career-best 9.950 in uneven
bars to win the event, a score that
has only been achieved once be
fore for the Cardinal this season,
as junior Ashley Morgan put up
the same score on floor last week.
Morgan won floor again this
week, scoring a 9.850 to tie with
Hong.
The team's score of 196.475
was its second best of the season.
The team's win improved the Car
dinal's record to 10-3 as it goes into
the Pac-12 Championships in two
weeks at Utah.
