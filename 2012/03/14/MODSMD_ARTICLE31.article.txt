# MOSBACHER MINUTE
## Baseball exceeds high expectations already 
### JACK MOSBACHER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of the Stan
ford baseball team from 2008-2011. Each
week, he'll take a look at the Cardinal's ups
and downs on its road to the College World
Series.
Following a grueling nonconference
schedule, the No. 2 Stanford baseball team
finally has some time to breathe, as it heads
into a two-week break for finals. As always,
the Cardinal opened its 2012 campaign
with series against some of the country's
most prestigious programs, including No. 6
Rice, No. 10 Vanderbilt, No. 13 Texas and
2008 national champion Fresno State.
Frankly, this Stanford team is better
than I expected it to be, A slew of players
have so far performed better than I could
have imagined. The talented but largely un

proven quartet of John Hochstatter, Brett
Mooneyham, David Schmidt and Jake
Stewart has been instrumental in helping
Stanford to its most impressive start in
nearly a decade.
Before the season started, I hadn't heard
much about the freshman Hochstatter. At
first blush, the highly touted recruit from
the East Bay doesn't seem to have over
powering stuff. So far this season, however,
Hochstatter has been a poster boy for the
age-old pitching axiom, "Keep the ball
down in the strike zone and mix your pitch
es well," by using a good fastball and two
solid off-speed pitches to keep batters off
balance. It's a good thing, too, as a College
World Series-caliber team requires three
good starting pitchers. Hochstatter has
been more than impressive so far, and Stan
ford's success this season will rely greatly
on his continued performance.

Mooneyham showed flashes of bril
liance in his first two years at Stanford, but
the big lefty's constant control issues led
some to wonder if he would ever achieve
his true potential on the Farm. To make
matters worse, Mooneyham cut his finger
in a fluke can-opening accident last year
and eventually had to miss the entire sea
son. So far in 2012, though, Mooneyham
has been a new man, dominating opposing
lineups with a more consistent motion that
has led to increased command of his fast
ball and renewed confidence to attack bat
ters early in the count. If he continues to
pitch this way, expect the Cardinal to keep
doing big things, and don't be surprised if
the lefty from the Central Valley has his
draft stock skyrocket.
With the departure of first-round pick
Chris Reed from the bullpen, Stanford's
early success this year has been buoyed by

the performance of the freshman Schmidt,
who has compiled a dominant 0.73 ERA
over eight appearances as Stanford's shut
down specialist. There are few things more
entertaining than watching a pitcher mow
down a lineup with a single pitch, as
Schmidt has done with the almost exclusive
use of his heavy 94-mph fastball. Don't let
his ever-present grin fool you: Schmidt's
bullish, "hit it if you can" attitude is perfect
ly suited for a closer role, which will be vital
in late-season nail-biters.
Perhaps the greatest surprise of the first
four weeks of the season has been the of
fensive performance of Stewart. A peerless
athlete with huge potential, the centerfield
er has been one of the country's best defen
sive centerfielders over the past two years;
unfortunately, his offensive output has
been less than stellar. After mak
ing noticeable changes to his me
chanics and approach at the plate
this fall, Stewart has arguably
been the Cardinal's most valu
able offensive player so far this
year, pacing the team with a .404
batting average. More tellingly,
Stewart has drilled three home
runs in the first three weeks of the
season after hitting zero in 174 at
bats last year. Moreover, with
Stewart missing this past week
end's series against then-No. 4
Rice with a minor back injury, the
Cardinal had by far their worst of
fensive stretch of the year. Fear
not, Stanford fans: Stewart should
be back when play resumes
against USC in two weeks. This
weekend simply proved how
valuable Stewart has become to
the Cardinal's offensive perform
ance.
The performances of these
four players have been key to
Stanford's early success. Most im
portantly, the Stanford baseball

team itself seems to be allergic to
losing. It has seen two games go
into extra innings, winning both in
dramatic fashion. It followed its
first loss of the season in the series
opener against Fresno State with
two decisive, vengeful victories.
There are even positive outcomes
associated with Stanford's loss in
the series finale against Rice on
Sunday, as the frustrating defeat
will be motivation for improve
ment as the Cardinal head into
this two-week break.

Granted, Stanford still has
areas for improvement. On the
mound, too many free bases are
being surrendered through walks,
and pitchers have made the of
fense play catch-up too often by
giving up runs early. Offensively,
Tyler Gaffney has yet to catch fire
boy, will the offense be intimi
dating when he does. Defensively,
the Cardinal has been a little
shaky in the infield, which I'm
sure they will shore up during
their time off.
Nonetheless, at 13-2, the No. 2
Cardinal has plenty to be excited
about.

dramatic fashion. It followed its
first loss of the season in the series
opener against Fresno State with
two decisive, vengeful victories.
There are even positive outcomes
associated with Stanford's loss in
the series finale against Rice on
Sunday, as the frustrating defeat
will be motivation for improve
ment as the Cardinal head into
this two-week break.

Granted, Stanford still has
areas for improvement. On the
mound, too many free bases are
being surrendered through walks,
and pitchers have made the of
fense play catch-up too often by
giving up runs early. Offensively,
Tyler Gaffney has yet to catch fire
boy, will the offense be intimi
dating when he does. Defensively,
the Cardinal has been a little
shaky in the infield, which I'm
sure they will shore up during
their time off.
Nonetheless, at 13-2, the No. 2
Cardinal has plenty to be excited
about.

Jack Mosbacher was a member of the Stan
ford baseball team from 2008-2011. Each
week, he'll take a look at the Cardinal's ups
and downs on its road to the College World
Series.
Following a grueling nonconference
schedule, the No. 2 Stanford baseball team
finally has some time to breathe, as it heads
into a two-week break for finals. As always,
the Cardinal opened its 2012 campaign
with series against some of the country's
most prestigious programs, including No. 6
Rice, No. 10 Vanderbilt, No. 13 Texas and
2008 national champion Fresno State.
Frankly, this Stanford team is better
than I expected it to be, A slew of players
have so far performed better than I could
have imagined. The talented but largely un

proven quartet of John Hochstatter, Brett
Mooneyham, David Schmidt and Jake
Stewart has been instrumental in helping
Stanford to its most impressive start in
nearly a decade.
Before the season started, I hadn't heard
much about the freshman Hochstatter. At
first blush, the highly touted recruit from
the East Bay doesn't seem to have over
powering stuff. So far this season, however,
Hochstatter has been a poster boy for the
age-old pitching axiom, "Keep the ball
down in the strike zone and mix your pitch
es well," by using a good fastball and two
solid off-speed pitches to keep batters off
balance. It's a good thing, too, as a College
World Series-caliber team requires three
good starting pitchers. Hochstatter has
been more than impressive so far, and Stan
ford's success this season will rely greatly
on his continued performance.

Mooneyham showed flashes of bril
liance in his first two years at Stanford, but
the big lefty's constant control issues led
some to wonder if he would ever achieve
his true potential on the Farm. To make
matters worse, Mooneyham cut his finger
in a fluke can-opening accident last year
and eventually had to miss the entire sea
son. So far in 2012, though, Mooneyham
has been a new man, dominating opposing
lineups with a more consistent motion that
has led to increased command of his fast
ball and renewed confidence to attack bat
ters early in the count. If he continues to
pitch this way, expect the Cardinal to keep
doing big things, and don't be surprised if
the lefty from the Central Valley has his
draft stock skyrocket.
With the departure of first-round pick
Chris Reed from the bullpen, Stanford's
early success this year has been buoyed by

the performance of the freshman Schmidt,
who has compiled a dominant 0.73 ERA
over eight appearances as Stanford's shut
down specialist. There are few things more
entertaining than watching a pitcher mow
down a lineup with a single pitch, as
Schmidt has done with the almost exclusive
use of his heavy 94-mph fastball. Don't let
his ever-present grin fool you: Schmidt's
bullish, "hit it if you can" attitude is perfect
ly suited for a closer role, which will be vital
in late-season nail-biters.
Perhaps the greatest surprise of the first
four weeks of the season has been the of
fensive performance of Stewart. A peerless
athlete with huge potential, the centerfield
er has been one of the country's best defen
sive centerfielders over the past two years;
unfortunately, his offensive output has
been less than stellar. After mak
ing noticeable changes to his me
chanics and approach at the plate
this fall, Stewart has arguably
been the Cardinal's most valu
able offensive player so far this
year, pacing the team with a .404
batting average. More tellingly,
Stewart has drilled three home
runs in the first three weeks of the
season after hitting zero in 174 at
bats last year. Moreover, with
Stewart missing this past week
end's series against then-No. 4
Rice with a minor back injury, the
Cardinal had by far their worst of
fensive stretch of the year. Fear
not, Stanford fans: Stewart should
be back when play resumes
against USC in two weeks. This
weekend simply proved how
valuable Stewart has become to
the Cardinal's offensive perform
ance.
The performances of these
four players have been key to
Stanford's early success. Most im
portantly, the Stanford baseball

team itself seems to be allergic to
losing. It has seen two games go
into extra innings, winning both in
dramatic fashion. It followed its
first loss of the season in the series
opener against Fresno State with
