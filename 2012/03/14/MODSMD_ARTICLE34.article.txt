## THE
						5 THINGS YOU SHOULD BE DOING THIS SPRING BREAK 
### 
A week and a half from now, you'll be
in the midst of spring break, that
happy hiatus between the bleakest
and the brightest quarters. In one
week's time you will molt from stud
ied hermit into prancing California
college kid. Here's how to do it.

Not Checking Grades
Sure, you know that grades will be due
at 5 p.m. Tuesday, March 27 and will
be available as soon as your professor
has posted them providing you
have completed your evaluations.
Obviously. But this isn't a time for
grades, it's a time for spring and break
and everything non-Stanford related.
Bronzing Your Largest
Organ
Wilbur Field, that grassy patch near
GovCo and the Claw are crooning
your name. Fountain hopping is a
Stanford tradition for a reason we're
located in sunny California, so make
sure your sun-bathed bod matches
that bathing suit and get ready for
spring quarter, partially clothed. Of
course, remember to stay healthy and
hit up that 30 SPF. Sunburn never
looks good in a fountain.
Catching Up on
Television
We would tell you this is important
because you'll be so busy with school
during spring quarter, but who are we
kidding? You'll be busy alright par
ties, concerts and being outside (and
not near study materials) will occupy so
much of your time that you'll want to
catch up on your two-dimensional

friends' lives before resuming your real
one come spring quarter. And with
entire discographies of shows like
"Mad Men" and "Skins" accessible on
Netflix and Hulu, we think you'll have
plenty of watchin' to do.

Starting up that Start-Up
This one's for all those fuzzies out
there techies be doing this one on
the daily. Now that you can put down
your first edition "Hamlet," find some
time to do that project you've always
wanted to do. Make a "Stuff Techies
Say" video, write your first screenplay,
experiment with web design heck!
The possibilities are endless! Just make
sure you don't recruit any overzealous
techies to help with the programming.

Recreating Yourself
By this point in your Stanford career,
you've probably heard it in some form
or another: "We were all nerds in high
school!" If this doesn't apply to you,
you're probably just in denial. If by this
point at Stanford you haven't com
pletely recreated yourself from a bash
ful dork into a robust popular kid, let
your spring break transform you into
the proverbial badass you've always
aspired to. That, or read Stewart
MacGregor-Dennis' 40-page life plan.
