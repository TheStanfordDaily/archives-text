## WILLFERRELL talks man-child characters and cowboys

Will Ferrell first made a name for him
self in the 1990s as a cast member on
the NBC sketch show "Saturday
Night Live" before embarking on a successful film
career with hits like "Elf," "Anchorman" and
"Talladega Nights." As an unofficial member of
the critic-dubbed "Frat Pack," he is best known
for his juvenile man-child characters and pro
longed comedic timing. "Casa de mi Padre," how
ever, casts him in an entirely different light: as a
naive Mexican cowboy who gets caught in the
crossfire between two rival drug lords.
Although the film pushes boundaries for its
genre, the greatest departure for Ferrell fans will
be seeing the comedian act entirely in Spanish.
"I didn't want the joke of the movie to be
that I spoke Spanish poorly," the actor said in an
interview with The Daily. "I wanted it to be a
thing where halfway through the movie it sneaks
up on you 'Oh my god! I forgot he doesn't
speak Spanish.'"
For a month before filming Ferrell worked
extensively with a tutor to master his character's
Mexican accent, and even during the shoot would
practice his lines relentlessly on the way to and
from set. But aside from the preparation, acting in
a foreign language presented other challenges,
especially for someone used to improvising.
"It [was] kind of an out of body experience,"
he recalls. "Acting almost came third because it
was all I could do to memorize in Spanish and
then my focus was on pronunciation."
Even so, Ferrell and his cast mates relished
the opportunity to be completely over the top.
" [Co-star] Diego Luna described it as we're
all characters playing characters," says Ferrell.
"We're like really bad actors trying to win an
Academy Award with every scene."
Set just south of the border, "Casa de mi
Padre" toys with the issue of transnational drug
trafficking, replete with bumbling DEA agents
dispatched from the Department of Justice. But

as Americans, the creative team, which also
includes writer Andrew Steele and director Matt
Piedmont, was sensitive to how the trade and the
characters were portrayed.
"We wanted this movie, while also being
outlandish and funny and different, be a little
satirical in the way that we comment on our
cliche views of Mexico and vice versa," says
Ferrell. "The fact that I'm an American playing a
Mexican talking about the crazy 'shit-eating
monster babies of America' that shows that
we have an understanding."
The film's style exhibits a similarly shrewd
irreverence, continually breaking the fourth wall
and reminding audiences that they're watching a
film. While creating continuity errors and visual
gags became like a game for the cast, getting the
crew to cooperate was another matter.
"In a business where you're not supposed to
make mistakes, it was so hard to get [the crew] to
mess up on purpose," laughs Ferrell. "So in some
ways I think we could have even had more mis
takes."
Of course, the film's many quirks and sub
versive elements have come at a price. Sensing
that the material would be much less accessible
than Ferrell's previous films, studios have been
slow to reach a distribution deal. This doesn't
seem to faze the actor at all, who is proud of the
finished product and optimistic about its future.
"It's like any of these movies we've done,
whether they're commercial successes or not," he
said breezily. "We firmly believe in what we're
doing, but we have no idea if it will work.
"It's a bigger release in Mexico, actually, than
it is here," he continues. "So what would be great
is if it were a big hit in Mexico and not so here
[in the States]. That would make me laugh hard
er than anything."
