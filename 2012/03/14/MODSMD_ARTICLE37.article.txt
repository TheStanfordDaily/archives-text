## 'Friends with Kids' funny and poignant 
### – alexandra HEENEY contact alexandra: aheeney@stanford. edu 
Ten years ago, Jennifer Westfeldt
launched onto the independent film
scene as the co-writer and star of the
hilarious sleeper hit "Kissing fessica Stein," an
edgy film about a straight woman who sur
prisingly finds herself embarking on a same
sex relationship. Westfeldt has it all: looks,
wit, comic timing, dramatic skill and writing
chops. It's a delight to see her back in action
in "Friends with Kids" a tamer concept
with more mainstream appeal, but with the
same clever writing for smart people about
smart people, that's both funny and emo
tionally resonant. "Kissing Jessica Stein"
launched Jon Hamm's screen career by giv
ing him his first substantial speaking part;
here's hoping "Friends with Kids" will bring
Westfeldt into the mainstream.
"Friends with Kids" is another pre
dictable yet fresh story about how best
friends in this case, single, neurotic New
Yorkers approaching forty, Jason (Adam
Scott) and Julie (Jennifer Westfeldt) eventu
ally find themselves realizing, after 20 years,
that they don't just have good banter but are
also in love. All it takes is for them to decide
to have a child together as friends, com-

mitted 100 per
cent, half the
time to realize
that they are soul
mates in and out
of the bedroom.

Jason and Julie, however, have watched
their friends have kids and then turn into
seemingly unrecognizable people. Their
friends Leslie (Maya Rudolph) and Alex (Chris
O'Dowd) have moved to lowly Brooklyn and
seem to have become inexplicably mean.
Missy (Kristin Wiig) and Ben (Jon Hamm),
who used to be incapable of keeping their
hands off one another, after having kids, now
only resent each other. Superficially, at first, it
seems to our rom-com stars that children ruin
marriages.
There are a lot of laughs to be had as
Jason and Julie decide and plan to conceive.
They like to play a game of picking which
death would be worse by alligators or by
shark —on the phone while in bed with other
people. They comment, wittily, on all the
absurdities of parenthood: that parents bring
rowdy kids to $lOO-a-meal restaurants, never
sleep and throw tantrums because of it and

obsessively inform other people of their child's
progress, including their first successful visit to
the toilet. Westfeldt, like Woody Allen, has a
knack for accurately writing neuroses in away
that allows us to laugh at them, and Julie's
neuroses provide a lot of comedic material.
Jason and Julie's child-rearing arrange
ment works in the beginning. They are great
friends and can communicate healthily to
share responsibility civilly and find away to
get sleep, eat and not turn their respective
apartments into unlivable dumps. In one
adorable scene, Jason comes downstairs in the
middle of the night to feed the baby with
breast milk from the fridge, helpfully labeled:
"pure," "one latte," "one glass of wine" and
"sushi for dinner."
But of course, the pair starts to get jeal
ous and has problems when they each meet
a cute someone new: he the young in every
way, lithe, gorgeous, but smart and quip-y
Mary Jane (Megan Fox), and she the good
looking, mature Kurt (Edward Burns). It's
around this time when the film shifts from a
lightweight sitcom vibe to a more emotion
ally complicated place. On a ski trip, the
non-couple is confronted with some difficult
questions. How they are going to explain
their situation to their kid, and handle his
emotional response, once he is old enough
to start asking questions?
This is dangerous territory because it
draws attention to the plot's flaws the rash
decision by smart people to have and share a
child to suit their own sex lives with little
regard for the child itself— but it succeeds

at deepening the characters and their rela
tionships. Though Ben seems to have
become the cliche of the husband-turned
jerk, he is the one that starts asking these
mature questions, albeit in a cruel and con
frontational manner. The answers to these
questions and how this propels the story
forward reveal a lot about the characters
and how our leads almost got things right. It
forces Jason and Julie to deal with their
issues, and the film earns the self-knowledge
that these two achieve. Their friends' rela
tionships, which are first played for comedy
their fights and their lack of sex life are
deepened, and we see why one marriage
failed and the other succeeded, despite both
being grown-up partnerships of equals.
There seems to be a new trend in rom
coms to put smart characters in stupid situa
tions, and yet end with the most modern,
funny and poignant films as a result: "Juno,"
"Friends with Benefits," "Easy A" and now
"Friends with Kids" all fit this bill. We need
more contemporary stories like these to
challenge conventional romantic narratives
and stereotypes. Westfeldt has proven herself
adept at telling these stories, writing charac
ters with wit and vulnerability, and I look
forward to seeing what she comes up with
next; with any luck, it will be something a lit
tle more realistic, and we won't have to wait
another decade.
