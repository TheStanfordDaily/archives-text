## INDIE SWEETHEART TAKES OVER SF LA 						SERA, LA BELLA 
### â€“ heidi SIGUA contact heidi: hsigua3l@stanford. edu 
On an intimate stage in San Francisco, indie
music sweetheart Katy Goodman crooned,
" Waiting to tell you I can't ever be with you so
run back to her, love, because it's over now," in her
deceptively sweet voice, inspiring fervor in the hip,
young and swaying crowd. Later in the set, she used
the same siren voice to introduce a song about death,
coating her new breakup album, "La Sera Sees the
Light," with enough granules of dream-pop sugar to
rot your ex's teeth. Last Wednesday, Stanford's own
KZSU sponsored a show with indie band La Sera
Goodman's stage name as well as the name of the
group at San Francisco's Rickshaw Stop, a dimly lit
music venue and bar, complete with bearded patrons
and their tattooed maidens.
Since I was punctual, as well as uninformed of the
etiquette of shows, I had the pleasure of being greeted
by the lead singer Katy Goodman at the merchandise
table, as she charmed me into purchasing her new
album and the obligatory t-shirt. She talked about the
benefits of living in sprawling Los Angeles, and I
handed her half of my paycheck for a few minutes of
her down-to-earth monologue about gentrification.
Then, I spent the first hour listening to local band
Swiftumz, and the second hour with Los Angeles
band, Cold Showers, whose 1970s post-punk sound
succeeded in washing away the resentment I felt from
the previous band.
At 11 p.m., La Sera assumed their rightful place
on stage. My feet forgave me for standing for two
hours because my ears were reliving the bittersweet

highs and lows of the breakup experience for all 20-
somethings. Goodman's show featured the music of
her new album along with a few tracks from the self
titled "La Sera," weaving the new work's grittier and
more aggressive sound with the dreamy landscape of
old favorites such as "Never Come Around" and
"Devils Hearts Grow Gold." The highlight of the night
was when Katy stepped down from the platform to
perform a guitar solo among her fans and then
allowed an inebriated audience member to dance
alongside her on stage. The same inebriated fan suc
ceeded in elbowing me in the face, which would have
ended in a back alley brawl if I didn't consider the
prospect of being kicked out in the middle of the set.
When Goodman performed her newest single off the
album, the crowd went into a ffen2y, feeding off the
barrage of the drums and Katy's voice hovering above
the instrumentals. At that very moment, I as a wit
ness to La Sera's great musical power was seized by
the intoxicating sentiment that breakups should feel
this empowering.
After the show and the high, I asked Goodman
what she thought of San Francisco. She smiled
earnestly and said, "In my opinion, San Francisco is
one of the greatest cities in our country." After last
Wednesday, San Francisco thinks you're pretty great,
too, Katy Goodman.
