Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom series
first appeared in 1912 with the
immensely popular "A Princess of
Mars." Over the course of Burroughs' life,
he wrote 10 more books about Barsoom
or Mars, for us human folk all of which
became massively influential both during
his lifetime and long after his death.

Famous science-fiction authors as diverse
as Arthur C. Clarke and H.P. Lovecraft were
inspired by the series, and both George

Lucas and James Cameron cited the books
as explicit influences for "Star Wars" and
"Avatar." With such a wide swath of the
American Zeitgeist carved by Burroughs'
stories, it is surprising that it has taken a full
century for Barsoom itself to appear on the
silver screen in "John Carter."
The plot revolves around the epony
mous title character (Taylor Kitsch), a
Confederate veteran with a troubled past,
as he is thrust into a war between

Barsoom's two remaining city-states:
Zodanga, the aggressors, and Helium, the
last stronghold against them. On the
periphery are the nomadic Tharks, who
play an important role as the movie pro
gresses. By virtue of his transference to the
red planet, Carter's physical prowess is
increased, making him highly coveted by all
parties involved in the war, including the
Therns (led by the always-creepy Mark
Strong), an immortal race that is control-

ling the conflict from
the shadows.
The plot deserves
ample explanation
because the film
places so much

emphasis on it. Though the action prom
ised by trailers is present in spades, there are
also long stretches of plot exposition in the
