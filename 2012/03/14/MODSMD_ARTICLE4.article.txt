## AxeComm requests special fees increase 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Two student groups, the Stanford Axe Com
mittee and the Viennese Ball Committee, have
requested significantly different amounts in
special fees this year compared to their past
budgets. The Axe Committee's (AxeComm) re
quest increased by 319 percent from $9,161.19
to $38,400, and the Viennese Ball Committee's

request decreased 60 percent from $25,000 to
$lO,OOO.
Petitions were due Friday, March 9 at 5 p.m.
The ASSU Elections Commission will validate
the petition signatures by Sunday, March 15.
AxeComm
According to AxeComm Chairman Brad
Moylan 'l3, the student group is requesting
more funding than it received for the 2011-12

school year because it plans on adding to its pro
gramming and has lost substantial funding from
other sources.

"We are completely revamping Big Game
Rally and adding a lot of components to it,
which unfortunately costs more money," Moy
lan said. "We're adding a big pyrotechnic ele
ment in tribute to the Big Game bonfires of the
The Big Game bonfire tradition
at Lake Lagunita dates back to
1898. The University ended the tra
dition in 1994 to protect the habitat
of the California tiger salamander.
Next year, AxeComm hopes to re
vive bonfire memories through a
fireworks spectacular costing
$12,000, according to the group's
requested budget.
Moylan said that additional in
creased expenses for next year in
clude more spirit programming
and viewing parties for every road
football game.
This past year, AxeComm lost
the considerable financial support
of two alumni, one who moved out
of the area and one who passed
away.
"AxeComm is on a big upswing
in the last couple years as far as how
active we've been on campus and
expanding our role, so that's why
we're needing an increase in re
sources," Moylan said. "As far as re
cent memory is concerned, the re
quest is a high."
Concerning spending adjust
ments for next year, Moylan said
that AxeComm has reduced its
budget for some operational as
pects of Big Game Week but is
mainly focused on expanding its
impact on campus. The spending in
creases therefore greatly outweigh
any cutbacks, he said. If the student
body does not approve Ax
eComm's request on the spring bal
lot, the group will struggle to sup
port the level of programming it
has had in the past, and most new
plans will not be fulfilled, he added.
Viennese Ball
The Viennese Ball Committee
reduced its 2012 fees request by
$15,000 because last year's request
was not approved.
"We're not in a dire position,"
said Viennese Ball Committee
Treasury Chair JJ Liu 'l4. "We're
still able to get revenue from the
ticket sales and different merchan
dise, but we hope to reduce prices if
our petition is approved. That will
be up to next year's committee."
Annually, the largest part of the
Viennese Ball Committee's budget
is dedicated to renting facilities and
equipment and hiring live bands.
Next year's budget will include ad
ditional expenses for new elements
being added to the ball.
"We're trying to make the ball
better for everyone. We created a
new 'History of the Ball' exhibit
and hired a photographer," Liu
said. "We hope to be able to contin
ue those for future balls."
The Committee currently re
ceives financial support from gen
eral ASSU funds and The Stanford
Fund (TSF). The group annually
partners with Swing Kids to fund
the swing room at the ball.
Other groups
Other student groups, including
Stanford Dil Se, a Bollywood dance
group, and Sixth Man Club, are re
questing fees, though they did not
do so last year.
"Last year we didn't apply for
special fees because we didn't get

into any competitions, but this year
we got into some of the best com
petitions, so we want to continue
that competitive nature of Dil Se,"
said Stanford Dil Se Financial Offi
cer Kathy Zabrocka 'l3. "Part of
[the cost] is travel, but we also have
to pay for putting on the produc
tion with the costumes, set the
whole Bollywood production. In
order to be competitive with other
college teams, we have to be as pro
fessional as they are."
Dil Se, which receives funding
from TSF, is requesting $29,550.
The group was granted around
$9,000 in Special Fees in 2010 and
paid for its expenses this year
through TSF and group reserves.
"If we don't get special fees, it
will put a big strain on the budget,"
Zbrocka said. "We might be able to
go to one local competition unless
there are some team members who
want to contribute a lot of money to
the team, which is what happens at
a lot of other colleges, but we don't
want to kick people out because
they can't contribute a certain
amount."

If Dil Se receives special fees,
the group plans to participate in
four competitions, the same
amount as this year. The group has
budgeted to spend $14,000 on trav
el fares, $5,000 on accommodations
and $2,000 each on honoraria fees
and equipment rentals.
Similarly, Sixth Man Club, the
men's basketball fan club, is peti
tioning for $27,355 in special fees.
According to Sixth Man CFO Max
Wernecke 'l3, this is the first time
the group has requested special
fees. He said that Sixth Man is
doing so because student section
admission was lowered to no cost
for students beginning with the
2010-11 season. Johnny Dawkins,
head coach of men's basketball,
made this decision with the goal of
increasing attendance at games.
For the 2009-10 season, students
were charged $65 to be part of Sixth
Man, which included season access
to home games. The Stanford Ath
letic Department's marketing
budget sustained the group's oper
ating costs last year and this year
since the special fees deadline had
already passed when the group
stopped charging students. Howev
er, promotions and food giveaways
at games decreased as a conse
quence.
"We're trying to bring it back to
how it once was," Wernecke said.
"The marketing budget is very
tight, so we need to look at other
sources of funding."
If the group does not receive
special fees, giveaways will likely
decrease even more, but the section
will remain free to students.
"We want to keep the student
section strong with a lot of people
attending," Wernecke said. "We
want to keep the enthusiasm there,
and we're trying to get a bit of fund
ing so we can keep all our traditions
intact."
In order to receive special fees
funding, student groups must re
ceive at least 50 percent of all votes
cast, with at least 15 percent of the
relevant student body voting. Stu
dents will vote on special fee re
quests, along with other election
items, on April 13 and 14.

quest is a high."
Concerning spending adjust
ments for next year, Moylan said
that AxeComm has reduced its
budget for some operational as
pects of Big Game Week but is
mainly focused on expanding its
impact on campus. The spending in
creases therefore greatly outweigh
any cutbacks, he said. If the student
body does not approve Ax
eComm's request on the spring bal
lot, the group will struggle to sup
port the level of programming it
has had in the past, and most new
plans will not be fulfilled, he added.
Viennese Ball
The Viennese Ball Committee
reduced its 2012 fees request by
$15,000 because last year's request
was not approved.
"We're not in a dire position,"
said Viennese Ball Committee
Treasury Chair JJ Liu 'l4. "We're
still able to get revenue from the
ticket sales and different merchan
dise, but we hope to reduce prices if
our petition is approved. That will
be up to next year's committee."
Annually, the largest part of the
Viennese Ball Committee's budget
is dedicated to renting facilities and
equipment and hiring live bands.
Next year's budget will include ad
ditional expenses for new elements
being added to the ball.
"We're trying to make the ball
better for everyone. We created a
new 'History of the Ball' exhibit
and hired a photographer," Liu
said. "We hope to be able to contin
ue those for future balls."
The Committee currently re
ceives financial support from gen
eral ASSU funds and The Stanford
Fund (TSF). The group annually
partners with Swing Kids to fund
the swing room at the ball.
Other groups
Other student groups, including
Stanford Dil Se, a Bollywood dance
group, and Sixth Man Club, are re
questing fees, though they did not
do so last year.
"Last year we didn't apply for
special fees because we didn't get

into any competitions, but this year
we got into some of the best com
petitions, so we want to continue
that competitive nature of Dil Se,"
said Stanford Dil Se Financial Offi
cer Kathy Zabrocka 'l3. "Part of
[the cost] is travel, but we also have
to pay for putting on the produc
tion with the costumes, set the
whole Bollywood production. In
order to be competitive with other
college teams, we have to be as pro
fessional as they are."
Dil Se, which receives funding
from TSF, is requesting $29,550.
The group was granted around
$9,000 in Special Fees in 2010 and
paid for its expenses this year
through TSF and group reserves.
"If we don't get special fees, it
will put a big strain on the budget,"
Zbrocka said. "We might be able to
go to one local competition unless
there are some team members who
want to contribute a lot of money to
the team, which is what happens at
a lot of other colleges, but we don't
want to kick people out because
they can't contribute a certain
amount."

If Dil Se receives special fees,
the group plans to participate in
four competitions, the same
amount as this year. The group has
budgeted to spend $14,000 on trav
el fares, $5,000 on accommodations
and $2,000 each on honoraria fees
and equipment rentals.
Similarly, Sixth Man Club, the
men's basketball fan club, is peti
tioning for $27,355 in special fees.
According to Sixth Man CFO Max
Wernecke 'l3, this is the first time
the group has requested special
fees. He said that Sixth Man is
doing so because student section
admission was lowered to no cost
for students beginning with the
2010-11 season. Johnny Dawkins,
head coach of men's basketball,
made this decision with the goal of
increasing attendance at games.
For the 2009-10 season, students
were charged $65 to be part of Sixth
Man, which included season access
to home games. The Stanford Ath
letic Department's marketing
budget sustained the group's oper
ating costs last year and this year
since the special fees deadline had
already passed when the group
stopped charging students. Howev
er, promotions and food giveaways
at games decreased as a conse
quence.
"We're trying to bring it back to
how it once was," Wernecke said.
"The marketing budget is very
tight, so we need to look at other
sources of funding."
If the group does not receive
special fees, giveaways will likely
decrease even more, but the section
will remain free to students.
"We want to keep the student
section strong with a lot of people
attending," Wernecke said. "We
want to keep the enthusiasm there,
and we're trying to get a bit of fund
ing so we can keep all our traditions
intact."
In order to receive special fees
funding, student groups must re
ceive at least 50 percent of all votes
cast, with at least 15 percent of the
relevant student body voting. Stu
dents will vote on special fee re
quests, along with other election
items, on April 13 and 14.

Two student groups, the Stanford Axe Com
mittee and the Viennese Ball Committee, have
requested significantly different amounts in
special fees this year compared to their past
budgets. The Axe Committee's (AxeComm) re
quest increased by 319 percent from $9,161.19
to $38,400, and the Viennese Ball Committee's

request decreased 60 percent from $25,000 to
$lO,OOO.
Petitions were due Friday, March 9 at 5 p.m.
The ASSU Elections Commission will validate
the petition signatures by Sunday, March 15.
AxeComm
According to AxeComm Chairman Brad
Moylan 'l3, the student group is requesting
more funding than it received for the 2011-12

school year because it plans on adding to its pro
gramming and has lost substantial funding from
other sources.

"We are completely revamping Big Game
Rally and adding a lot of components to it,
which unfortunately costs more money," Moy
lan said. "We're adding a big pyrotechnic ele

The Big Game bonfire tradition

of the California tiger salamander.
Next year, AxeComm hopes to re

fireworks spectacular costing
$12,000, according to the group's
requested budget.
Moylan said that additional in
creased expenses for next year in
clude more spirit programming
and viewing parties for every road
football game.
This past year, AxeComm lost
the considerable financial support
of two alumni, one who moved out
of the area and one who passed
away.
"AxeComm is on a big upswing
in the last couple years as far as how
active we've been on campus and
expanding our role, so that's why
we're needing an increase in re
