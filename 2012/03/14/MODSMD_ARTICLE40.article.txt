## DANGEROUS, ALONE WHAT IS 'ZELDA,' ANYWAY? 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
At just two and a half hours into my
first honest playthrough of The
Legend of Zelda, I've died 26 times.
I know because the game keeps track. That's
more deaths, I'm sure, than I've suffered in 10
runs through Ocarina of Time. When I boot
up the game tomorrow, that number will be
the first thing I see, a reminder to swallow my
pride and strap myself in. (A good use for
home gaming's first save battery, to be sure.)
Zelda has cast me blindly into the wilds
more aggressively than any game I've played
in the last decade. In A Link to the Past, I
knew I needed to get to the castle. In Ocarina
of Time, the Deku Tree asked for my help. In
Zelda, there's nothing. No internal guidance
at all. The title screen comes up, I hit start
and off I go. Apart from a bit of grammati
cally questionable advice from a few old sages
hobbling around in caves, I'm on my own.
It starts with a sword, a rusty-looking
thing that Link (whose name isn't given) can
only jab straightforward. No side-slashes, no
spin attacks. The series' old staple of energy
beams at full health is thankfully present in
the first game, but it's not too helpful with
enemies cluttering the screen and a tiny, tem
peramental shield. I manage to stumble upon
the first dungeon: a relief at first, but a bit
disconcerting. First, I find a bow and arrow.
Cool, yes, and typical first-dungeon material.
But then I pick up a boomerang not in a
chest, just right off the ground. Two core
items in the same dungeon? It's like bizarro-
Zelda or a bad imposter; all the basics are
here, but something's off. Someone's tarn-

pered with it. I'm not sure I like it, but I keep
going.
Maybe things will come together.
A few deaths later, I make it through with
enough health to defeat the first boss (a sim
ple, green dragon how quaintly charming),
but after that, I'm once again a stranger in a
strange land. When I leave the dungeon, I still
have a small key. A simple transgression, but it
breaks one of the most basic Zelda rules. If I
didn't need it, perhaps even the dungeons are
more open-ended in this game.
Does that lantern have... Blue Fire?
Like in Ocarina of Time?
With no sage or fairy leading me on, my
first thought is to expand my mental map of
the area. I head southwest and stumble into a
repeating area of forest the first iteration
of the Lost Woods, I have to assume. My
heart warms a bit; now that's Zelda. I get
jabbed by a moblin spear, die and return to
my nameless little starting area. I head north
this time, then die again at what seems like
Death Mountain, complete with Ocarina
esque rockslides. At this point, I'm feeling a
little defeated. I'm waiting for the same warm
tinglies I got playing Link's Awakening on my
flight home a few days ago, or when I played
around with Wind Waker last month. That's
what Zelda does for me. But they're not com
ing. All I want to do is find another dungeon.
I would kill to find one. At least then I could
focus on something a puzzle, an enemy, a
door. Something besides all this sacrilege; this
wandering, bush-burning and dying. Maybe
then I could nestle myself back into the Great
Lie, seeing only maps, compasses and keys.
I finally head off in the direction of the

fabled EASTMOST PENNINSULA of mis
spellization, but on my way I come across a
lonely tree. Burn it, I say. Burn it to hell. Stairs
appear. Another moblin, I presume. But no
I step in, the music changes and my map
disappears. At last, a dungeon!
Whoops.
1 walk through just one door, and a
four-headed blue thing rips my head off and
riddles my body with laser bolts. Before
dying, I notice some text in the corner.
"Level-8," it says.
Well, crap.
That's another blow to my confidence,
on two levels. I don't have the skill to contend
with what I assume is nearly the final dun
geon, and more importantly, I'm left ques
tioning my Zelda knowledge even more. Why
can I even access this dungeon? It's like the
hook-shot for Ocarina's Water Temple, or the
flippers for Catfish's Maw in Link's
Awakening.
In my mind, the game and I are now at
an impasse. Either it would show me its
Zelda-ness, or I'd change my view of what
makes up a Zelda game in the first place.
At this point, I have to give in a little.
"This isn't Zelda," I think. The game showed
itself to me across two dungeons, and its
basic formula wasn't about to change.
Perhaps I had the wrong idea about this
series all along.
Now, I wrestled with that idea for a bit
and then came at it from a different angle. I

took a step back and tried my best to pretend
it was 1986. In other words, I stopped being
so picky.
From that approach, the moment-to
moment gameplay is pure Zelda, even com
pared to the series' most recent outings. The
enemies, controls and aesthetics are all there.
Stalfos, keese and moblins crowd dungeons,
the boomerang stuns them, Link has two slots
for equipping items, the screen scrolls when
you reach the end of an area, bombs expose
secret areas the list goes on. Like a kid com
plaining about a new baseball glove, I was too
busy grappling with minor differences to see
the infinitude of essential similarities.
Compared to their contemporaries,
Zelda games have always been light on expo
sition. Link is a silent hero with a simple
quest; it's up to us to fill in the details. It's a
winning formula that fosters a personal con
nection with the series, and I dare to say that
the original Zelda does it best. It doesn't get
simpler than this without a manual, we
don't even know who Link is, let alone what
he must accomplish. We don't know where to
go, and we won't know what to do until we
get there. It's existential, completely depend
ent on the player's imagination. In that sense,
at least, it's quintessentially "Zelda" in away
that modern games wouldn't dare to be.

the boomerang stuns them, Link has two slots
for equipping items, the screen scrolls when
you reach the end of an area, bombs expose
secret areas the list goes on. Like a kid com
plaining about a new baseball glove, I was too
busy grappling with minor differences to see
the infinitude of essential similarities.
Compared to their contemporaries,
Zelda games have always been light on expo
sition. Link is a silent hero with a simple
quest; it's up to us to fill in the details. It's a
winning formula that fosters a personal con
nection with the series, and I dare to say that
the original Zelda does it best. It doesn't get
simpler than this without a manual, we
don't even know who Link is, let alone what
he must accomplish. We don't know where to
go, and we won't know what to do until we
get there. It's existential, completely depend
ent on the player's imagination. In that sense,
at least, it's quintessentially "Zelda" in away
that modern games wouldn't dare to be.


At just two and a half hours into my
first honest playthrough of The
Legend of Zelda, I've died 26 times.
I know because the game keeps track. That's
more deaths, I'm sure, than I've suffered in 10
runs through Ocarina of Time. When I boot
up the game tomorrow, that number will be
the first thing I see, a reminder to swallow my
pride and strap myself in. (A good use for
home gaming's first save battery, to be sure.)
Zelda has cast me blindly into the wilds
more aggressively than any game I've played
in the last decade. In A Link to the Past, I
knew I needed to get to the castle. In Ocarina
of Time, the Deku Tree asked for my help. In
Zelda, there's nothing. No internal guidance
at all. The title screen comes up, I hit start
and off I go. Apart from a bit of grammati
cally questionable advice from a few old sages
hobbling around in caves, I'm on my own.
It starts with a sword, a rusty-looking
thing that Link (whose name isn't given) can
only jab straightforward. No side-slashes, no
spin attacks. The series' old staple of energy
beams at full health is thankfully present in
the first game, but it's not too helpful with
enemies cluttering the screen and a tiny, tem
peramental shield. I manage to stumble upon
the first dungeon: a relief at first, but a bit
disconcerting. First, I find a bow and arrow.
Cool, yes, and typical first-dungeon material.
But then I pick up a boomerang not in a
chest, just right off the ground. Two core
items in the same dungeon? It's like bizarro-
Zelda or a bad imposter; all the basics are
here, but something's off. Someone's tarn-

pered with it. I'm not sure I like it, but I keep
going.
Maybe things will come together.
A few deaths later, I make it through with
enough health to defeat the first boss (a sim
ple, green dragon how quaintly charming),
but after that, I'm once again a stranger in a
strange land. When I leave the dungeon, I still
have a small key. A simple transgression, but it
breaks one of the most basic Zelda rules. If I
didn't need it, perhaps even the dungeons are
more open-ended in this game.
Does that lantern have... Blue Fire?
Like in Ocarina of Time?
With no sage or fairy leading me on, my
first thought is to expand my mental map of
the area. I head southwest and stumble into a
repeating area of forest the first iteration
of the Lost Woods, I have to assume. My
heart warms a bit; now that's Zelda. I get
jabbed by a moblin spear, die and return to
my nameless little starting area. I head north
this time, then die again at what seems like
Death Mountain, complete with Ocarina
esque rockslides. At this point, I'm feeling a
little defeated. I'm waiting for the same warm
tinglies I got playing Link's Awakening on my
flight home a few days ago, or when I played
around with Wind Waker last month. That's
what Zelda does for me. But they're not com
ing. All I want to do is find another dungeon.
I would kill to find one. At least then I could
focus on something a puzzle, an enemy, a
door. Something besides all this sacrilege; this
wandering, bush-burning and dying. Maybe
then I could nestle myself back into the Great
Lie, seeing only maps, compasses and keys.
I finally head off in the direction of the

fabled EASTMOST PENNINSULA of mis
spellization, but on my way I come across a
lonely tree. Burn it, I say. Burn it to hell. Stairs
appear. Another moblin, I presume. But no
I step in, the music changes and my map
disappears. At last, a dungeon!
Whoops.
1 walk through just one door, and a
four-headed blue thing rips my head off and
riddles my body with laser bolts. Before
dying, I notice some text in the corner.
"Level-8," it says.
Well, crap.
That's another blow to my confidence,
on two levels. I don't have the skill to contend
with what I assume is nearly the final dun
geon, and more importantly, I'm left ques
tioning my Zelda knowledge even more. Why
can I even access this dungeon? It's like the
hook-shot for Ocarina's Water Temple, or the
flippers for Catfish's Maw in Link's
Awakening.
In my mind, the game and I are now at
an impasse. Either it would show me its
Zelda-ness, or I'd change my view of what
makes up a Zelda game in the first place.
At this point, I have to give in a little.
"This isn't Zelda," I think. The game showed
itself to me across two dungeons, and its
basic formula wasn't about to change.
Perhaps I had the wrong idea about this
series all along.
Now, I wrestled with that idea for a bit
and then came at it from a different angle. I

took a step back and tried my best to pretend
it was 1986. In other words, I stopped being
so picky.
From that approach, the moment-to
moment gameplay is pure Zelda, even com
pared to the series' most recent outings. The
enemies, controls and aesthetics are all there.
