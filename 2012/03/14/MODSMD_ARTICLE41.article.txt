## 'Casa de mi Padre' brings laughs to the big screen 
### â€“ misa SHIKUMA contact misa: mshikuma@stanford. edu 
Will Ferrell portrays a simple
minded Mexican cattle
rancher in the Spanish-lan
guage "Casa de mi Padre," a kitschy
telenovela-meets-Spaghetti Western
written and directed by fellow "Saturday
Night Live" alumni Andrew Steele and
Matt Piedmont. Co-starring Diego Luna
and Gael Garcia Bernal as rival drug
lords who get caught up in the
American Drug Enforcement
Administrations schemes, the film's sur
prising charm lies in its sheer implausi
bility.
Armando Alvarez (Ferrell), an affa
ble yet dim-witted young man, finds his
livelihood threatened when his family's
beloved cattle ranch teeters on the brink
of financial ruin. The sudden return of
the elder and more successful Alvarez
brother Raul (Luna) and his Sports
Illustrated model of a fiancee Sonia
(Genesis Rodriguez) initially promises
to restore the family to its former pros
perity, but Armando quickly discovers
that the sibling he idolized is not all that
he seems to be.
Family drama and drug warfare
collide as Armando begins to fall for
Sonia in the midst of escalating tensions
between Raul and the fearsome local
overlord Onza (Bernal). But little do the
Alvarez brothers know that Sonia has
secret ties to Onza's drug cartel. When
the DEA steps in to orchestrate a fatal
standoff between Raul and Onza in

order to
prevent
Mexican I
drugs '
from
crossing th(

border, it is up to Armando to try to rec
tify the situation. But naturally, noth
ing goes quite according to plan.
Viewers with at least first-year
proficiency in the Spanish language
will notice the unrealistic and almost
inauthentic quality of the dialogue, a
product of Steele writing the script
first in English and then deliberately
translating each line. The subtitles at
the bottom of the screen only call
more attention to the intentionally
poor writing, with riotous results. But
of course, even the cheesiest of lines
would be nothing without the over
the-top, telenovela-style delivery.
Luna and Bernal, established dra
matic actors in their native Mexico
who first burst onto the international
scene with 200l's "Y Tu Mama
Tambien," prove their comedic chops
beyond doubt. Bernal, as the two-tim
ing Onza, takes the villainous carica
ture to new extremes, while Luna, per
petually dressed in gaudy suits with
his fingers dripping with jewels, is all
sleaze and slicked-back hair.
Although under Piedmont's
direction the actors push the bound
aries of their stock characters in inven

tive ways, "Casa de mi Padre" is not
merely a parody of genre but rather a
parody of moviemaking itself. Much
like the script, the camera has no
qualms about revealing the inherently
contrived nature of cinema. From
painted backgrounds to choppy edit
ing, the film refuses to passively offer
the viewer an alternate reality to sink
into.
Despite an undertone of social
commentary, "Casa de mi Padre" is
arguably more subversive when it
comes to style than content. The por
trayal of Raul, Onza and the DEA
offer a subtle message that the drug
war is a universal problem unfettered
by geographic boundaries, and yet the
film's attitude toward Mexican stereo
types seems to be more self-aware
than self-righteous.
And while I wouldn't go so far as
to say that the film proves that Ferrell
has range, his performance is
nonetheless refreshingly hilarious, per
haps because for once his physical
awkwardness as an actor matches his
stilted speech as a non-native Spanish
speaker. Either way, by the time the
credits roll, it's clear he's done his job
well kept us laughing the whole
time and wanting more.
