## TOWN AND COUNTRY steps up the lunch game

In Silicon Valley, everything moves fast.
The Internet is fast, the sports cars are
fast and the people are faster yet. While
we would all like to slow down and smell the
roses, this is not always an option with the
rigors of work, school and other commit-

ments.
While I
believe in the
idea of eating

slowly and savor
ing mealtime, the

American office place and

work schedule are not organ-

ized in away conducive to three-hour lunch
es. Equipped with the knowledge that people
in the valley are on a tight schedule and
exhibiting typical Silicon Valley entrepre
neurial instincts, a few smart folks have
opened up new eateries catering to people
who do not want to choose between eating
well and eating fast.
In the Town & Country shopping cen
ter, two such places just opened. If one can
find parking (and not get too frustrated by
the swarming high schoolers), both are

worth trying.
The first place is called Tava Indian
Kitchen, located in the back corner of the
shopping center behind Trader Joe's. (Note:
Do not make the same mistake I made,

expecting a restaurant experience: Do not
invite your friends to go out to eat dinner at
Tava there are not tables; you will end up
eating in your car... which will then smell
like curry... for a few days...). Despite the
current lack of tables, Tava has some tasty
and quick food, perfect for on-the-go lunch
es or dinners. Tava's concept is kind of like
Chipotle, but for Indian food: you first pick
your base: rice bowl, salad bowl or Burroti
(burrito-like wrap made of Roti bread); then
pick your sauce: tomato tikka sauce or lentil
dahl; then pick your protein: chicken, lamb

or paneer cheese and chick peas; and finally,
you pick varying levels of spice or flavor with
sauces and toppings.
Overall, Tava is a great concept: fast,
fresh and creative. The paneer and garbanzo
bean protein is a nice respite from the tofu
"choice" vegetarians are usually forced to
make. I especially like how the Tikka sauce
does not already have meat mixed in, there
fore making it an option for non-carnivores.
The portions are plentiful and the Tava Lava
hot sauce is sufficiently fiery. Although that
particular sauce was quite hot, the dishes
could use a bit more general spice.
The other new spot in Town & Country
is called Asian Box. This time, I knew to
expect a take-out cafe, so I did not have to eat
in my car. I did, however, drive with my
Asian box in my car and therefore, for a sec

ond time in one week, found myself driving
around in what smelled like an Asian fusion

restaurant. But I digress.
Similar to Tava and Chipotle, Asian Box
is a build-your-own place. You first pick the
base from different types of rice, vegetables
and noodles, then pick among chicken, beef,
tofii and shrimp and then add on. The add
ons are where it starts getting fun you can
choose vegetables and then pick any or all of
the box toppers (most of which are free).
Box-toppers include chopped peanuts, pick
led vegetables, fresh herbs and crispy shallots.
Then, of course, it's sauce time. The food at
Asian Box tasted incredibly fresh and each
bite in the box provides a new and exciting
flavor. While my taste buds were curious as to
what to expect with each bite, they felt a bit
overwhelmed by all of the competing tastes.
Both Tava and Asian Box create fast and
flavorful fusion food, and both are perfect for
days when a salad or sandwich seems a bit
boring. They don't compromise on quality or
taste. My only other recommendation: no
matter how much of a rush you are in, don't
forget to open your car windows.
