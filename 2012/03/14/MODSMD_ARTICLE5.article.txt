## XOX says Univ. talks promising 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Following a month of dialogue
between Chi Theta Chi (XOX)
representatives and University
administrators, reports from both
sides suggest that they are making
progress toward a mutually ac
ceptable settlement, following the
University's February decision to
take control of the house.
Citing "pressing life safety is
sues," the University moved Feb. 8
to terminate the lease of XOX,
with the stated intent of assuming
control of the house on April 2.
Even after delaying the
takeover to Aug. 31 the expira
tion date of the annually renewed
lease the University main
tained that it would assume con
trol of the XOX house despite
protests from the XOX communi
ty and the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate.
"This decision was the result of
longstanding and unresolved is
sues ... as well as the determina
tion that the Chi Theta Chi Alum
ni Board was not able to provide
effective oversight or satisfactorily
meet the conditions of the lease,"
wrote Vice Provost of Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman and Senior As
sociate Vice Provost for Residential
and Dining Enterprises Shirley
Everett in an email to The Daily.
Abel Allison 'OB, president of the
XOX alumni board, said that while as
of a Feb. 23 meeting with University
administrators the University still in
tends to end the current lease, he felt
that the actual continuation of a dia
logue between XOX and the Univer
sity is in part due to the support XOX
received from the Stanford communi
ty-
"We believe the University is be
ginning to understand why inde
pendence is critical to the house's
unique character, thanks to the out
pouring of support from alumni and
the community at large," Allison
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"We have heard from students,
parents and alumni about Chi Theta
Chi's inimitable character and the
life-changing effect it has had on
them, and we have taken this into ac
count as we engage in discussions
about future arrangements," Board
man and Everett wrote.
While declining to discuss specif
ic details of ongoing talks with the
University, Allison emphasized that
the University and XOX share the
goal of "ensuring that the student
living environment is a safe and
healthy one." He noted that XOX's
alumni association is in the process
of undertaking structural reforms to
accomplish more effective and con
sistent oversight and house manage
ment, including proposals such as
the hiring of a property manager, a
role used by the only other inde
pendently operated house on cam
pus, Sigma Chi.
Allison also highlighted the ef
forts of the alumni board to disprove
the issues such as fire hazards, the

risk of default and a failure to main
tain corporate status referenced
by the University as grounds for let
ting the lease expire. The alumni
board submitted more than 200
pages of evidence to the University at
a Feb. 23 meeting.

"We provided a response to the
University that documents our ac
tions and status as a corporation in an
effort to show that the decision to end
the lease is extreme and that the cul
ture of the house is inextricably tied
to its independent operation," Alli
son wrote.

Explaining the University's initial
attempt to assume control on April 2,
Boardman and Everett cited "alarm
ing reports" from fire and health in
spectors about conditions in the
XOX house. With the most pressing
issues resolved, the University was
able to continue the dialogue with
XOX, but Boardman and Everett
expressed concerns about the ability
of the alumni board to effectively and
safely operate the house.
"Moving forward while we are in
discussion about the status of Chi
Theta Chi, other facilities projects
will only be undertaken after a fully
collaborative process has been estab
lished and followed," Boardman and
Everett wrote.

Boardman and Everett empha
sized that the alumni board "effec
tively communicated the critical na
ture of their independence from the
University," and they acknowl
edged the effect that input from
XOX community members had on
discussions about future arrange
ments. They also highlighted the
University's desire to maintain a
"rich variety of living environ
ments" incorporating Chi Theta
Chi's unique culture.
"We appreciate the opportunity
to be in dialogue with the Alumni
Board, and we expect to have a reso
lution soon that honors core (and
often shared) values and priorities of
both the University and Chi Theta
Chi," Boardman and Everett wrote.

Citing "pressing life safety is
sues," the University moved Feb. 8
to terminate the lease of XOX,
with the stated intent of assuming
control of the house on April 2.
Even after delaying the
takeover to Aug. 31 the expira
tion date of the annually renewed
lease the University main
tained that it would assume con
trol of the XOX house despite
protests from the XOX communi
ty and the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate.
"This decision was the result of
longstanding and unresolved is
sues ... as well as the determina
tion that the Chi Theta Chi Alum
ni Board was not able to provide
effective oversight or satisfactorily
meet the conditions of the lease,"
wrote Vice Provost of Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman and Senior As
sociate Vice Provost for Residential
and Dining Enterprises Shirley
Everett in an email to The Daily.
Abel Allison 'OB, president of the
XOX alumni board, said that while as
of a Feb. 23 meeting with University
administrators the University still in
tends to end the current lease, he felt
that the actual continuation of a dia
logue between XOX and the Univer
sity is in part due to the support XOX
received from the Stanford communi
ty-
"We believe the University is be
ginning to understand why inde
pendence is critical to the house's
unique character, thanks to the out
pouring of support from alumni and
the community at large," Allison
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"We have heard from students,
parents and alumni about Chi Theta
Chi's inimitable character and the
life-changing effect it has had on
them, and we have taken this into ac
count as we engage in discussions
about future arrangements," Board
man and Everett wrote.
While declining to discuss specif
ic details of ongoing talks with the
University, Allison emphasized that
the University and XOX share the
goal of "ensuring that the student
living environment is a safe and
healthy one." He noted that XOX's
alumni association is in the process
of undertaking structural reforms to
accomplish more effective and con
sistent oversight and house manage
ment, including proposals such as
the hiring of a property manager, a
role used by the only other inde
pendently operated house on cam
pus, Sigma Chi.
Allison also highlighted the ef
forts of the alumni board to disprove
the issues such as fire hazards, the

risk of default and a failure to main
tain corporate status referenced
by the University as grounds for let
ting the lease expire. The alumni
board submitted more than 200
pages of evidence to the University at
a Feb. 23 meeting.

"We provided a response to the
University that documents our ac
tions and status as a corporation in an
effort to show that the decision to end
the lease is extreme and that the cul
ture of the house is inextricably tied
to its independent operation," Alli
son wrote.

Explaining the University's initial
attempt to assume control on April 2,
Boardman and Everett cited "alarm
ing reports" from fire and health in
spectors about conditions in the
XOX house. With the most pressing
issues resolved, the University was
able to continue the dialogue with
XOX, but Boardman and Everett
expressed concerns about the ability
of the alumni board to effectively and
safely operate the house.
"Moving forward while we are in
discussion about the status of Chi
Theta Chi, other facilities projects
will only be undertaken after a fully
collaborative process has been estab
lished and followed," Boardman and
Everett wrote.

Boardman and Everett empha
sized that the alumni board "effec
tively communicated the critical na
ture of their independence from the
University," and they acknowl
edged the effect that input from
XOX community members had on
discussions about future arrange
ments. They also highlighted the
University's desire to maintain a
"rich variety of living environ
ments" incorporating Chi Theta
Chi's unique culture.
"We appreciate the opportunity
to be in dialogue with the Alumni
Board, and we expect to have a reso
lution soon that honors core (and
often shared) values and priorities of
both the University and Chi Theta
Chi," Boardman and Everett wrote.
