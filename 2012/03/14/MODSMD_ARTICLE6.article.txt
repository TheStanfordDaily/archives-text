### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
"There are one billion potential
customers in emerging markets that
we have to tap into," CEO of General
Electric (GE) Jeffrey Immelt said Fri
day evening to the nearly 400 atten
dees of the 2012 Stanford Institute for
Economic Policy and Research
(SIEPR) Economic Summit. The din
ner and Immelt's keynote speech
were held at the Arrillaga Alumni
Center.
During Immelt's talk, several pro
testors stood outside the Alumni Cen
ter carrying a banner emblazoned
with the words "GE, here is a bright
idea: pay your fair share of taxes."
The protestors said that the com
pany acquired $10.5 billion in profits
over the past three years, but has not
paid federal taxes on this revenue.
"We are here because we know the
president of GE is here, and we want
to raise awareness on this topic so that
GE is accountable," said protestor
Peter McDonald 'll. "Some people
have given us the thumbs up, and oth
ers have tried to call the cops."
The summit was a daylong event
that included seminars, such as "An

Institutional Approach to the End
of Western Ascendancy" given by
Niall Ferguson, a history professor
at Harvard University. CEO of
Gilead Sciences John Martin and
CEO of Hewlett Packard Meg
Whitman participated in a semi
nar titled, "CEO Perspectives on
the Economy."
Immelt emphasized the role
and importance of China in the
global economy throughout his
speech, stating that it will be the
"engine for the world market."
"If you [businesses] are not in
China, you are not in the world,"
he said. "But the problem with
China is that it is hard to do busi
ness there."
"The government is the player,
and you really have to study the
five-year plans they write up," he
continued.
Immelt stated that cyber secu
rity and intellectual property is
sues in China particularly concern
him.
Despite his assessment of
China, Immelt said that resource
rich regions such as Africa and the
Middle East will be the key to the
world economy in the future.
Citing what he believes to be
the United States' comparative
advantages in technology and ed
ucation, Immelt expressed opti
mism about economic recovery
and growth in the country.
"The positive outcome of the
crisis is that we have learned to
make better risk-reward equa
tions," he said.
Immelt added that "populism
and anger does not solve prob

lems" and instead advocated in
vestment in sectors such as health
care, education and energy.
"It is a sin when we are number
25 in the world for math and invest
only 2 percent of our GDP in re
search and development," Immelt
said. "Science is the secret to suc
cess, so we have to be a country of
technology and science."
"We are the Saudi Arabia of
natural gas," he said. "We can take
control of our energy future."
While Immelt had positive eco
nomic assessments for many re
gions of the world, he predicted
that Europe's future economic sit
uation will be "somewhere be
tween bad and terrible."
After his speech, Immelt an
swered questions from the audi
ence. The topics ranged from how
to conduct business in China to
economic policies of the Obama
administration.
"We have had an incredible
collection of speakers today," said
William Faulkner 'l3, who works
with SIEPR. "It's very complex
putting together all the parts of the
summit, but it's satisfying to see it
all work out."
"It was a dynamic day with con
flicting views of the world and
economy," said Camille
Townsend, president of the Palo
Alto Unified School District, who
attended the dinner and keynote
speech as well as several of the
day's events. "The ideas on where
education should head were par
ticularly compelling."

of Western Ascendancy" given by
Niall Ferguson, a history professor
at Harvard University. CEO of
Gilead Sciences John Martin and
CEO of Hewlett Packard Meg
Whitman participated in a semi
nar titled, "CEO Perspectives on
the Economy."
Immelt emphasized the role
and importance of China in the
global economy throughout his
speech, stating that it will be the
"engine for the world market."
"If you [businesses] are not in
China, you are not in the world,"
he said. "But the problem with
China is that it is hard to do busi
ness there."
"The government is the player,
and you really have to study the
five-year plans they write up," he
continued.
Immelt stated that cyber secu
rity and intellectual property is
sues in China particularly concern
him.
Despite his assessment of
China, Immelt said that resource
rich regions such as Africa and the
Middle East will be the key to the
world economy in the future.
Citing what he believes to be
the United States' comparative
advantages in technology and ed
ucation, Immelt expressed opti
mism about economic recovery
and growth in the country.
"The positive outcome of the
crisis is that we have learned to
make better risk-reward equa
tions," he said.
Immelt added that "populism
and anger does not solve prob

lems" and instead advocated in
vestment in sectors such as health
care, education and energy.
"It is a sin when we are number
25 in the world for math and invest
only 2 percent of our GDP in re
search and development," Immelt
said. "Science is the secret to suc
cess, so we have to be a country of
technology and science."
"We are the Saudi Arabia of
natural gas," he said. "We can take
control of our energy future."
While Immelt had positive eco
nomic assessments for many re
gions of the world, he predicted
that Europe's future economic sit
uation will be "somewhere be
tween bad and terrible."
After his speech, Immelt an
swered questions from the audi
ence. The topics ranged from how
to conduct business in China to
economic policies of the Obama
administration.
"We have had an incredible
collection of speakers today," said
William Faulkner 'l3, who works
with SIEPR. "It's very complex
putting together all the parts of the
summit, but it's satisfying to see it
all work out."
"It was a dynamic day with con
flicting views of the world and
economy," said Camille
Townsend, president of the Palo
Alto Unified School District, who
attended the dinner and keynote
speech as well as several of the
day's events. "The ideas on where
education should head were par
ticularly compelling."
Dodge and Cox Investment
Managers, Koret Foundation &
Taube Philanthropies, URS Cor

and GE sponsored the summit.
