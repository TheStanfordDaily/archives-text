## Etchemendy balances additional duties 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
University Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 told The
Daily that filling in for President
John Hennessy has required mini
mal adjustment over the past few
weeks.
Etchemendy has been serving as
acting president â€”in addition to
his role as provost since Feb. 15
when Hennessy officially began his
sabbatical. Hennessy announced
he would be taking a sabbatical last
September and plans to return to
the University in June for Com
mencement Weekend.
Etchemendy largely credited
the ease of slipping into this tempo
rary role to his prior experience as
acting president of the University
while Hennessy travels.

"I've been acting president
many, many times," Etchemendy
said. "The difference with this is it's
for a much more extended period
of time."
Etchemendy also highlighted
the large overlap between the job
of the University provost and the
job of the president as a factor con
tributing to the smooth transition.
"The important thing to under
stand is that John Hennessy and I
work very, very closely together
and have worked closely together
for almost 12 years," he said. "Al
most everything that I do, any
major decision made by either of
us, we talk to the other. So in that
sense, Em quite familiar with what
the president does just as the presi
dent is quite familiar with what I
do."
Etchemendy added that the

standard replacement when a Uni
versity president goes on sabbatical
is often the provost or in some
cases, a former president.
On a day-to-day level, the addi
tional post has meant that
Etchemendy must now meet both
with the people who report to the
provost as well as those who report
to the president, he said. This has
packed his schedule with more
meetings than usual.
Etchemendy said that Hen
nessy's absence has also altered the
office dynamic.
"The way we work, John Hen
nessy and I, we generally see each
other and talk to each other two or
three times a day about issues that
have come up because, as 1 say, we
work very closely together,"
