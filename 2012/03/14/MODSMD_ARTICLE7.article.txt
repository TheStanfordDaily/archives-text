## Etchemendy balances additional duties 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
University Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 told The
Daily that filling in for President
John Hennessy has required mini
mal adjustment over the past few
weeks.
Etchemendy has been serving as
acting president â€”in addition to
his role as provost since Feb. 15
when Hennessy officially began his
sabbatical. Hennessy announced
he would be taking a sabbatical last
September and plans to return to
the University in June for Com
mencement Weekend.
Etchemendy largely credited
the ease of slipping into this tempo
rary role to his prior experience as
acting president of the University
while Hennessy travels.

"I've been acting president
many, many times," Etchemendy
said. "The difference with this is it's
for a much more extended period
of time."
Etchemendy also highlighted
the large overlap between the job
of the University provost and the
job of the president as a factor con
tributing to the smooth transition.
"The important thing to under
stand is that John Hennessy and I
work very, very closely together
and have worked closely together
for almost 12 years," he said. "Al
most everything that I do, any
major decision made by either of
us, we talk to the other. So in that
sense, Em quite familiar with what
the president does just as the presi
dent is quite familiar with what I
do."
Etchemendy added that the

standard replacement when a Uni
versity president goes on sabbatical
is often the provost or in some
cases, a former president.
On a day-to-day level, the addi
tional post has meant that
Etchemendy must now meet both
with the people who report to the
provost as well as those who report
to the president, he said. This has
packed his schedule with more
meetings than usual.
Etchemendy said that Hen
nessy's absence has also altered the
office dynamic.
"The way we work, John Hen
nessy and I, we generally see each
other and talk to each other two or
three times a day about issues that
have come up because, as 1 say, we
work very closely together,"

University Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. '82 has been serving as
Acting President since Feb. 15, when President John Hennessy began
his sabbatical. Hennessy will return for Commencement weekend.
Etchemendy said. "With the pres
ident away, that doesn't happen."
To help fill his shoes as provost
while he is serving as acting presi
dent, Etchemendy has asked
Robert D. Simoni, the Donald
Kennedy chair in the School of
Humanities and Sciences and pro
fessor of biology, to assist with
reading all of the faculty promo
tion and reappointment files that
are processed by the provost.
"[Simoni] has extensive expe
rience as a member of the Adviso
ry Board," Etchemendy said, re
ferring to the committee of facul
ty that advises on appointments
and promotions. "He's been on
the advisory board for many,
many years. He's been the chair of
the advisory board for many
years, and so is extremely knowl
edgeable."

While Hennessy is on sabbati
cal, the University will continue its
search for a new dean of the
School of Medicine and a new di
rector of the SLAC National Ac
celerator Laboratory, as well as
Stanford's foray into the world of
online education, according to
Etchemendy, who said that Hen
nessy's sabbatical will not effect
those initiatives.
"Things do come up out of the
blue and you have to make a deci
sion day to day on lots of different
things," Etchemendy said. "But in
terms of the major overall proj
ects, there are no projects that
weren't in process before Presi
dent Hennessy went on sabbatical
and no projects that we didn't
think about in advance."
"I can still always ask him
questions if I feel that a decision
shouldn't be made without his
input," he added. "It's not as if he's
dropped off the face of the earth."
