## BOSP unconcerned by fall application numbers 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though the Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram (BOSP) is still accepting late applica
tions for six of its fall quarter programs,
BOSP director Bob Sinclair said the exten
sions are a standard practice and that he is
not worried about the health of any of the
programs.

The BOSP programs in Florence,
Madrid, Moscow and Santiago have not
filled to capacity and are still seeking appli
cants for fall quarter. The Paris and Oxford
are accepting applicants for the waitlist.
While the programs in Florence, Madrid and
Santiago each have 40 spots, Florence re
ceived only 27 applications, Madrid received
36 and Santiago received 32. In addition, the
Moscow program, which is only offered fall
quarter, had 18 applicants for a capacity of 25
students.

Sinclair said he believes that the practice
of accepting late applications is linked to stu
dent interest in the overseas seminar pro
grams, which are offered for three weeks
over the summer.

"We are still accepting late applications to
try and maximize the number of students
who go overseas," Sinclair said. "We had a
huge number of applicants for the overseas
seminars, so if there were students who ap
plied for the seminar and not the regular pro
gram, then we wanted to give them an oppor
tunity to rethink applying for the regular

program."
Sinclair noted that that the trend for the
Moscow program is not unusual.
"Moscow has always been at a little bit
less than capacity, but it is such an important
program that we don't worry about the num
bers," Sinclair said. "When I visited last au
tumn, I was impressed with the students' en
thusiasm. Moscow is a very unique opportu
nity amongst all the programs."
Although the Moscow program closed in
2003 due to limited interest and high admin
istrative costs, and did not reopen until 2005,
Sinclair said he feels that the 2012 program
does not face the same potential fate.
"We really have a lot of belief in the
strength and necessity of the program," Sin
clair said. "As far as we are concerned, we
will offer it."
Faculty and students seem to agree with
Sinclair's positive assessment of the Moscow
program. Over the past few weeks, numer
ous letters and testimonials have been wide
ly circulated through Stanford chat lists.
One such appeal written by professors
Jack and Nancy Kollmann, two faculty-in
residence members from the 2010 program
in Moscow highlighted many of the
strengths of the program. Students, they
wrote, can intern at a variety of companies in
the city and are also able to travel extensive
ly through Europe.
"The thing about Moscow is that it's a
place you might never go to on your own, but
it's a dynamic society with great things hap

pening and fascinating political changes," the
two professors wrote.
Moscow, the Kollmanns also noted, is one
of the few BOSP programs that does not
have a language requirement.
"If you have no Russian, you can go in
late August to start an intensive language
program that gives you some basic function
ality before classes start," they wrote.
The other programs still accepting appli
cations, with the exception of the program in
Oxford, require at least three quarters of col
lege-level language classes. Madrid now re
quires six quarters of language classes, a
change from the 2011-12 requirements,
which only expected students to have taken
a minimum of one year of Spanish, according
to Sinclair.
"This change is on a trial basis at first, so
we can see the results," Sinclair said. "Proba
bly the main reason is that there is a pretty
strong language pledge at Madrid. We want
to make sure that students are comfortable
with that."
The change in Madrid's requirements,
however, does not seem to have significantly
impacted the application numbers for fall.
"Application numbers don't seem to be so
much different," Sinclair said. "Each pro
gram goes up and down ... you just can't pre
dict it. There's nothing of concern about
Madrid applications."
