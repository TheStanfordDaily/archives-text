APRIL is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.
Winter kept us warm, covering
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
A little life with dried tubers.
Summer surprised us,
coming over the Starnbergersee
With a shower of rain;
we stopped in the colonnade,
And went on in sunlight,
into the Hofgarten,
And drank coffee,
and talked for an hour.
-from T.S. Eliot's
"The Waste Land

NEW COURSES THIS SPRING
ENGLISH 136E: Romantic Ruins
This course examines the idea of the ruin. We will examine romanticism in theory; literary treatments of ruins, fragments,
remnants and remains; and the problem of post-romantic reception and a tradition in ruins. Authors considered are Shelley,
Byron, Austen, and others. TTh l:15-3:05pm (Rovee)
ENGLISH 151 C: Wastelands
Beginning with a sustained examination of T.S. Eliot's "The Waste Land," this class will explore the trope of ecological and/
or spiritual devastation as it enters into other modernist (Hemingway, Cather, Faulkner, O'Neill) and postmodernist (Ballard,
Atwood, McCarthy) projects, tracing this theme to its culmination in the contemporary zombie apocalypse.
TTh 3:15-s:ospm (McGurl)
ENGLISH 171: History of the English Language
This course traces the history of the English language from its roots through its earliest written records into the present. It will
trace the fundamental changes that English has undergone in terms of morphology, phonology, syntax, semantics,
and vocabulary. It will also explore some of the social, cultural, and historical forces that affect language. The course
emphasizes the pre-modern history of English. MWF 10-10:50 am (Karnes)
ENGLISH 262G; Globalization, Literature, & the Environment
To examine the relations between globalization, empire, and ecology, we will turn to postcolonial writers in English from
Africa, the Caribbean, South Asia, and the Pacific Islands and examine how they inscribe threats to the world environment.
We will draw from diverse genres such as short stories, poetry, film, and the novel. Topics to be considered include
indigenous and diasporic relationships to the land, plantation agriculture, gardening, nuclear militarization, oil drilling, and
human and environmental sustainability. W 3:15-6:ospm (DeLoughrey)
