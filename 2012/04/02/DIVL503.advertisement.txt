This course investigates the relationship between law and public policy on current issues
related to economic regulation, health care, electoral politics and finance, civil rights;

much government regulation or too littlel Do Democratic and Republican 2013 budget plans hold
up to scrutiny? Can a state prevent you fiom buying and carrying a gun? Can it permit you to use a
gun to "standyour ground"?
We will explore how 'the law" both facilitates and constrains public policy reforms in an

explore sentencing theories end their application, the nature, scope
and function of corrections, the impact of mass incarceration on
crime and communities, the effectiveness of rehabilitation, the
