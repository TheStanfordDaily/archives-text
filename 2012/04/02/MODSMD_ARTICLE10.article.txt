## Mapping space and time Stanford's Spatial History Lab digitally navigates history through spatial and temporal analysis 
### JUSTINE ZHANG 
The Spatial History Lab, located on the top floor
of Wallenberg Hall, resembles the office of a
thriving new start-up. The brightly lit space is
filled with computers and whiteboards, the walls
are lined with maps and infographics, and a
water cooler sits somewhere in the corner.
Studying history, it seems, is no longer a matter of por
ing over books in a library, but a matter of exploring the
past and present dynamically.
"The idea behind it is that history takes place in space,
as well as time, so historians study change over time, but the
changes that take place across space are just as important,"
said History Prof. Jon Christensen 'Bl M.A. 'O6 Ph.D. 'l2, a
principal investigator of multiple projects in the lab.
Christensen, along with fellow history professors
Richard White and Zephyr Frank, founded the lab in 2007
with a grant given to White by the Mellon Foundation.
Since its inception, the lab has branched out into several re
search project topics spanning from ecological history in
the Bay Area to Chinese-Canadian immigration.
The spatial aspect of the research, however, has re
mained consistent. The group's output includes research
papers as well as animated displays of data and trends
throughout time and space, which are posted on the
group's website.
According to Frank, the lab's current director, creating
a dynamic visualization of a historical event allows a re
searcher to glean new perspectives.
"Visualization leads us to be explicit about spatial di
mensions in historical arguments, instead of assuming
space is an empty container and human activity is au
tonomous to spatial constraints," he said.
For instance, a group of researchers developed a visual
ization of a yellow fever outbreak in Rio de Janeiro in 1850.
The visual overlays a map of the region with discrete points
showing individual incidences of yellow fever and continu
ous colored regions indicating hot spots of the epidemic.
The display is then animated through the months that the
epidemic occurred, allowing a viewer to see how the dis
ease moved across the city through space and time.
"[Conventional] literature tends to refer to epidemics
as a unified whole," Frank said. "An epidemic is usually re
ferred to very generally by city and by year."
This approach overlooks the individual experience or,
as Frank termed it, "what one person in Rio is thinking
about right now, yesterday or last week."
The visualization revealed the surprising trend that the
disease migrated unpredictably instead of spreading out
ward from a point of origin, appearing in different loca
tions in a seemingly random fashion.
According to Frank, the visualization thus allows a

modern observer to experience the human side of the
event the increased sense of fear brought on by the idea
that the disease spread to new places randomly and with
out warning.
To affiliated researchers, the visual aspect of the lab al
lows for new trends and insights to be extracted from old
information.
"Mapping data spatially enables us to tease apart rela
tionships that would not otherwise be apparent were the
data stuck in spreadsheet form," said Jenny Rempel 'l2 in
an email to The Daily.

Rempel, an earth systems major and Daily columnist,
has been working with Christensen to study the interac
tions between natural and urban areas in cities. She said
that the spatial tools she has used have been crucial to un
derstanding these correlations.
"Spatial analysis lets us visualize otherwise static and
cumbersome data in a more dynamic and understandable
fashion, and, in the process, it makes this data accessible to
a much wider audience," Rempel said.
Along with representing data visually, the lab is also
concerned with extracting existing data. Often information
exists in forms that are dense in data but difficult to under
stand easily for example, as points on a map or scattered
references in an historical text.
Cameron Blevins, a third-year graduate student special
izing in American history, is working on a study of 19th
century Texas newspapers to reconstruct how the period's

newspapers presented geographic conceptions of the
world to their readers. His research involves mining un
structured texts to extract place names.
"In an age of 'big data,' scholars from history to litera
ture are facing a deluge of information and sources to ana
lyze," Blevins said in an email to The Daily. "The problem
is not necessarily going to be a problem of scarcity, but one
of abundance."
In this respect, the Spatial History Lab is as much a tech
nological study as it is an historical one. To compile and
parse historical data, the lab uses a program that can pick
up cues such as geographical references in historical litera
ture so that they can be recognized by a computer. To this
end, the lab enlists people from a variety of disciplines.
While the areas of study may interest students majoring
in history or urban studies, the data-processing angle has
attracted engineering and computer science students, as
well.
"This project has opened their minds to creative possi
bilities in the humanities," Christensen said. "If human be
ings are an important part of the human-computer interac
tion, one must understand the human side of the equation,
and that's what the humanities are about."
The interdisciplinary nature of the lab is one reason why
it has grown to become a highly collaborative research fa
cility.
"The degree of complexity and the technical knowledge
that's required in a project generally exceeds any one per
son's capacity," Frank said.
The collaborative atmosphere is highly appealing to stu
dent researchers such as Blevins.
"It offers a think-tank workspace in which people can
bounce ideas off of one another, draw on each other for ex
pertise and be exposed to other projects and topics," Frank
said.
Frank said he envisions increased collaboration with
other departments as the project expands. This year, the
project began making formal connections with other digi
tal humanities projects such as the Stanford Literary Lab.
In fact, a name change for the lab is pending because these
two ventures are planning to merge together.
As the lab expands, it continues to attract a wide variety
of faculty members and student research assistants.
"[The lab was] one of the main reasons why I applied to
Stanford as it was a truly unique resource that no other pro
gram in the country could match," Blevins said.
For its founding members, the continued appeal of the
lab's innovative approach has not gone unnoticed.
"It's fun and interesting and creative," Christensen said
of the lab. "It's exciting to work in new ways using comput
er technologies and techniques to do new kinds of re
search."
