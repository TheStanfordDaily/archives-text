## EDITORIAL Reflecting on Dean Julie's departure 
### 
As announced over break,
Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9,
associate vice provost for
undergraduate education and
dean of freshmen and undergrad
uate advising, will step down
from her role at Stanford at the
end of spring quarter to pursue a
graduate degree in writing. Lyth
cott-Haims, known to many as
"Dean Julie," has had a tremen
dous impact at Stanford since
joining the administration in
1998, and we at the Editorial
Board would like to reflect on her
time at Stanford.

plaud both directives, as many
freshmen choose to narrow their
academic experiences at a time
when the faculty and administra
tion want them to explore the
most. We hope that Dean Julie's
successor can maintain enthusi
asm for these initiatives while
critically examining other areas
of Stanford life for underclass
men.

With that in mind, Dean Julie's
energy and school-spirit may
never be matched. While the Uni
versity searches for her replace
ment, we believe that the search
team should prioritize candidates
who are undergraduate alumni of
the university. Not only should
the candidate bleed Cardinal red,
but he or she should be someone
who, by the nature of having at
tended Stanford, has an instant
connection with each incoming
class of freshmen.

Dean Julie first came to the
University as an undergraduate
majoring in American Studies.
She lived in Branner as a fresh
man, and she was also an RA
there during her junior and sen
ior years. After graduating in
1989, she attended Harvard Law
School and briefly worked in cor
porate law before returning to
Stanford in 1998 as the associate
dean of student affairs in the Law
School. Two years later she be
came a member of President
Hennessy's senior staff, and in
2002 she became Stanford's first
dean of freshman.

Dean Julie was able to tran
scend the role of an administrator
she was one of us. When refer
ring in an interview to the Stan
ford band playing at Admit Week
end, she said: "you're not in Cam
bridge, you're not in New Haven,
you're not in Princeton, you're in
Palo Alto, and we do things differ
ently here." Dean Julie knew what
made Stanford unique, and her
successor should as well.

When the Freshman Dean's
Office merged with Undergradu
ate Advising and Research
(UAR) in 2009, Dean Julie be
came the head of the undergrad
uate advising system at Stanford.
So although among students she
is perhaps most known for her
class role-calls at campus events,
her inspiring school-spirit at foot
ball games or repping Stanford
on her Twitter account, Dean
Julie has had a significant impact
on broadening the role of pre
major advising and expanding
undergraduate access to re
sources to conduct their own re
search. One significant change is
that undeclared students are now
required to meet with their pre
major advisor once per quarter
before enrolling in classes. At a
minimum, this provides a needed
opportunity for underclassmen
to reflect on what they have done,
what they want to do and where
they are headed.

It is safe to say that Dean Julie
positively impacted thousands of
students, and her presence on
campus will be sorely missed. De
spite her considerable adminis
trative duties, she also managed
to personally connect with many
individual students, writing
words of encouragement on their
Facebook walls, reading graduate
school personal statements and
meeting personally with disillu
sioned students. One of our fond
est memories was the 2009 Big
Game, when Stanford was stag
ing a comeback late in the fourth
quarter. Dean Julie, in the first
row of the Red Zone, turned
around and started shouting "Do
you believe?" This was followed
by hundreds of students yelling
back "We believe!" Although
Stanford eventually lost the
game, Dean Julie's fighting spirit
left a profound impression. We
are confident that she will take
this enthusiasm to her writing en
deavors, and we can't wait to see
what she will accomplish.

In addition, Dean Julie has
spearheaded an 18-month effort
to plan the Reflection Seminars,
currently a pilot program that
aims to provide even more intro
spection for freshmen. We ap-
