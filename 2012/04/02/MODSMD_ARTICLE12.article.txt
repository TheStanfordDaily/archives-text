## On the passing of Sam Wopat'14 
### GREG BOARDMAN Vice Provost for Student Affairs 
Dear Stanford students:
As many of you may already
know, the university tragi
cally lost a member of the
sophomore class and of the
women's volleyball team on March
25, just as many of you were ending
finals and beginning spring break.
Samantha "Sam" Wopat died at
Stanford Hospital, where she had
been hospitalized since Saturday,
March 17. A memorial service for
the Stanford community has been
scheduled for Memorial Church
on Wednesday, April 18, at 1:30
p.m.

The death of a student is one
that profoundly affects all of us. It
touches the entire university com
munity. It is human nature to seek
explanations and closure, especial
ly when faced with the issue of
death; however, it is not always
possible to have the certainty we
seek.

It is unlikely that the university
will release further information
out of respect for the wishes of the
Wopat family. I hope that, like the
university, each of you will contin
ue to recognize and respect the

family's need for privacy. We hope
you will keep them in your
thoughts during this difficult time.
The university continues to pro
vide support for Sam's teammates
and friends. It is always incredibly
heartbreaking when a member of
our community passes away. So I
would like to remind you of the
campus resources that are avail
able to Stanford students.
They include:
• Residential Education: resident
assistants, resident fellows, resi
dence deans
• Counseling and Psychological
Services
• Office of Religious Life
• The Bridge Peer Counseling
Center
We hope you will seek help
from those resources if you need to
in order to process the thoughts
and feelings that may emerge in
the aftermath of Sam's passing.

Sincerely,
