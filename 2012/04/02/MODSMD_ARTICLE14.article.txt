# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## The 						invisible why 
### Nina Chung 
By the end of 12th grade, I
had achieved "the good
life" a preview version
of what I thought I wanted for the
rest of my life. My name and face
was broadcast to the student body
twice weekly; I had an impressive
resume; I had a solid group of hi
larious friends, and options in the
romance arena; I was seen as
super nice because I distributed
baked goods, mix CDs and car
pool rides; I was labeled a good
person because I led so much
community service. I was enjoying
the perfect balance of high
achievement alongside magnani
mous reputation; I was comfort
able, ambitious and really happy. I

was decent, while hoping to
change the world in my name.
Thankfully, that kind of life aspi
ration was and is completely so
cially condoned. Pride in self may
not be, but as long as I never con
sciously addressed my own self
ishness, and others around me be
lieved I was "good," I was safe. So
when my Stanford career began,
everything I said and did was driv
en by my heart's ultimate inten
tion: the ideal life I tasted that sen
ior year.

But today, the beginning of my
last quarter here begins, com
mencement beckons and much of
what I used to want from college
and beyond seems like someone

else's dream. Somehow, my exis
tence at this school and my pic
ture of the future seems ... dif
ferent. For a while, though, I
couldn't figure out why. After all,
the "Work" bookmark group in
my browser is filled with listings I
would have tagged four years
ago, too; I find myself looking
into the same general post-col
lege plans I would have picked
out during freshman year. Plus, I

look the same, my hobbies
haven't changed much and casu
al, four-year-old acquaintances
say I'm still recognizably me. The
trajectory of my time here seems
to have run along with general
logic and predictability. What
changed, then? Why does that
girl four years ago feel like a
stranger I'd probably be interest
ed to meet?
This question has been the
backdrop for the numerous job
related chats I've been having re
cently with friends and various
other income-earning human be
ings in the world. I initially started
contacting these people to learn
what their work was like and if I
would like it: publishing, free
lance writing, consulting, gradu
ate study, urban nonprofits. But
what I found myself learning
most was how little their job title
told me relative to their purposes
behind it. "Why are you doing
what you do?" is the question that
has uncovered the most.
I honestly didn't expect a grad
uate course professor to ask me if
what I wanted from grad school
was an entrance to a fascinating
subject, or just an escape from the
job search. I didn't expect my
music major friend to tell me she
had loved performing ever since
seeing the joy it gave her grand
parents during their most painful
days. I didn't expect my own fa
ther to explain how he was leav
ing consulting to start a new in
vestment firm in order to have
deeper relationships with the

people with whom he was work
ing. Why didn't I expect these an
swers? It's because I forget that
there's a heart inside every story
the part of the story I actually
love the most. Behind every
word, action and interaction
there is intention, and I think that
intention is born ultimately in our
hearts.
Of course, not everyone is
thinking about their heart and
what it seeks most, or about
whether it's necessary to under
stand how their heart plays into
their version of the "good life."
Our deepest life objective is an
invisible thing, with little territo
ry in daily conversations. It is
quiet and completely unan
nounced, even if it guides every
thing any of us will ever do . . .
which I believe it does.
Sometime in the first century, a
guy named Matthew wrote a rev
olutionary statement: where our
treasures are, our hearts are also.
And I agree. He suggested that
what people desire most from life
goes beyond rationale or intellect
and right to the core of who we
are. He suggested that what we
treasure is the giveaway of our
heart, which defines us. Well, no
wonder my life is different. Some
where between four years ago
and now, what I want from life
and what I want to want com
pletely changed. And it wasn't a
mere head decision.
In the end, this is just a school
column written by a random 21-
year old girl. Yet I hope it means
something, if it comes straight
from my heart.

related chats I've been having re
cently with friends and various
other income-earning human be
ings in the world. I initially started
contacting these people to learn
what their work was like and if I
would like it: publishing, free
lance writing, consulting, gradu

what I found myself learning
most was how little their job title
told me relative to their purposes
behind it. "Why are you doing
what you do?" is the question that
has uncovered the most.
I honestly didn't expect a grad
uate course professor to ask me if
what I wanted from grad school
was an entrance to a fascinating
subject, or just an escape from the
job search. I didn't expect my
music major friend to tell me she
had loved performing ever since
seeing the joy it gave her grand
parents during their most painful
days. I didn't expect my own fa
ther to explain how he was leav
ing consulting to start a new in
vestment firm in order to have
deeper relationships with the

people with whom he was work
ing. Why didn't I expect these an
swers? It's because I forget that
there's a heart inside every story
the part of the story I actually
love the most. Behind every
word, action and interaction
there is intention, and I think that
intention is born ultimately in our
hearts.
Of course, not everyone is
thinking about their heart and
what it seeks most, or about
whether it's necessary to under
stand how their heart plays into
their version of the "good life."
Our deepest life objective is an
invisible thing, with little territo
ry in daily conversations. It is
quiet and completely unan
nounced, even if it guides every
thing any of us will ever do . . .
which I believe it does.
Sometime in the first century, a
guy named Matthew wrote a rev
olutionary statement: where our
treasures are, our hearts are also.
And I agree. He suggested that
what people desire most from life
goes beyond rationale or intellect
and right to the core of who we
are. He suggested that what we
treasure is the giveaway of our
heart, which defines us. Well, no
wonder my life is different. Some
where between four years ago
and now, what I want from life
and what I want to want com
pletely changed. And it wasn't a
mere head decision.
In the end, this is just a school
column written by a random 21-
year old girl. Yet I hope it means
something, if it comes straight
from my heart.

By the end of 12th grade, I
had achieved "the good
life" a preview version
of what I thought I wanted for the
rest of my life. My name and face
was broadcast to the student body
twice weekly; I had an impressive
resume; I had a solid group of hi
larious friends, and options in the
romance arena; I was seen as
super nice because I distributed
baked goods, mix CDs and car
pool rides; I was labeled a good
person because I led so much
community service. I was enjoying
the perfect balance of high
achievement alongside magnani
mous reputation; I was comfort
able, ambitious and really happy. I

was decent, while hoping to
change the world in my name.
Thankfully, that kind of life aspi
ration was and is completely so
cially condoned. Pride in self may
not be, but as long as I never con
sciously addressed my own self
ishness, and others around me be
lieved I was "good," I was safe. So
when my Stanford career began,
everything I said and did was driv
en by my heart's ultimate inten
tion: the ideal life I tasted that sen
ior year.

But today, the beginning of my
last quarter here begins, com
mencement beckons and much of
what I used to want from college
and beyond seems like someone

else's dream. Somehow, my exis
tence at this school and my pic
ture of the future seems ... dif
ferent. For a while, though, I
couldn't figure out why. After all,
the "Work" bookmark group in
my browser is filled with listings I
would have tagged four years
ago, too; I find myself looking
into the same general post-col
lege plans I would have picked
out during freshman year. Plus, I

look the same, my hobbies
haven't changed much and casu
al, four-year-old acquaintances
say I'm still recognizably me. The
trajectory of my time here seems
to have run along with general
logic and predictability. What
changed, then? Why does that
girl four years ago feel like a
stranger I'd probably be interest
ed to meet?
This question has been the
backdrop for the numerous job
related chats I've been having re
cently with friends and various
other income-earning human be
ings in the world. I initially started
contacting these people to learn
