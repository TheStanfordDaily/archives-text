# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## The 						tyranny of homogeneity 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Alexis de Tocqueville, wor
ried about the undue power
American democracy
granted to the people, famously
warned about the "tyranny of the
majority." There is now a new des
potism, equally dangerous. It is a
tyranny of the individual over him
self as damaging to social utility
as it is to personal intellectual
growth.
In his recent New Yorker essay
"Groupthink," Jonah Lehrer ex
amines the efficacy of brainstorm
ing most specifically, its key
strategic rule that brainstormers
refrain from criticizing each
other's ideas during the thought
generation process. He finds that
while hundreds of businesses,
think tanks and schools continue
to employ brainstorming as a strat
egy for finding solutions to tough
problems, there's just one prob
lem: "It doesn't work."
In fact, explains Lehrer, count
less studies have shown that ban
ning criticism during brainstorming
sessions lowers the number, quality
and efficacy of the groups' final de
cisions. Groups that encourage crit
icism of faulty ideas regularly out
perform groups where a friendly
but false consensus prevails.
But technology particularly
the Internet tends to generate
precisely this type of dangerous
consensus among the like-minded.
Legal scholar Cass Sunstein has
warned in his book "Republic.com
2.0" that new forms of social media
have allowed individuals to control
what they read, see and hear to an
unprecedented degree. Since we

prefer to consume things we know
and like, argues Sunstein, this has
fragmented and polarized the de
livery of previously nonpartisan
content to consumers of new
media. Thus liberals can watch
Rachel Maddow every night with
out ever reading Charles
Krauthammer, while conservatives
can obsessively replay You Tube
clips of Newt Gingrich pontificating
about food stamps without ever
taking a serious look at Paul Krug
man. The results are "echo cham
bers" and "information cocoons"
where sheltered citizens successful
ly avoid dealing with opinions they
don't want to hear.

Social networking contributes
to the problem. Our friends, on the
whole, tend to share our ideological
and political outlook on the world,
and Facebook has now enabled us
to take that comforting consensus
online (thus the domination of my
news feed by links to the Huffing
ton Post and The New York Times
and the general absence of links to
the National Review and the Week
ly Standard). Surrounding our
selves with circles of the pleasantly
like-minded, argues Sunstein, can
be comfortable. But it comes at the
cost of increasing partisan polariza
tion and the calcification of existing
ideological prejudices.
This is all, of course, little more
than statistical confirmation of
what British philosopher John Stu
art Mill recognized nearly one hun
dred and fifty years ago in his 1869
work "On Liberty" that dis
agreement and discord tend to
maximize social utility, while con

formity, forged by legal or social
pressure, tends to minimize it.
First of all, notes Mill, never tak
ing intellectual opposition seriously
undermines our ability to see where
we may be wrong and to change our
opinions accordingly. Society and
the individual both lose out when
errors go unchallenged. Equally im
portantly, conformity limits our
ability to more keenly discern why,
when and how we are right. With
out the blessing of a loyal opposi
tion, we can start to take the cor
rectness of our opinions for grant
ed, without fully appreciating the
underlying premises or reasons for
that correctness. The luxury of con
sensus thus begets intellectual com
placency.
While Stanford is in some ways a
beautifully diverse place, inhabited
by people from nearly all back
grounds and cultures, I think that it
can also be ideologically homoge
neous to a degree that Sunstein,
Lehrer and Mill would find damag
ing.
I don't buy Rick Santorum's as
sertion that college is a liberal con
spiracy to indoctrinate young peo
ple; every political science and
ethics professor with whom I've
taken classes has done his or her

best to encourage real debate, and
to present both sides of controver
sial political issues.
But the student responses to
such intellectual exercises tend to
be one-sided, or at best prefaced
by "I don't actually believe this,
but..." There are generally lots
of people willing to argue for
more limits on corporations and
more spending on the social safe
ty net, but few willing to advance a
principled case against regulation
or mount a spirited defense of the
free market. The fact that I agree
with most of it makes matters
worse; I much prefer a nuanced

refutation of my own beliefs to
endless variations on them.
Transcending this reflexive con
formity requires a deliberate effort
to continuously engage with argu
ments we find wrong and even ab
surd. Here at Stanford, it might re
quire a daily dose of David Brooks
or George Will, some Hayek or
Friedman alongside Rawls and
Marx a spoonful of distasteful
medicine forced down the throat to
cure the ailment of ideological ho
mogeneity.
It might rankle at first. But in the
end, both the individual and society
as a whole benefit from a real en
gagement with thoughtful opposi
tion.
