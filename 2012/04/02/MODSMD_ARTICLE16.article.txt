## BEARS TOPPLE CARD NNEKA'S 22 NOT ENOUGH IN SEMIS 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Five straight Aprils, five straight heart
breaks.
Last night, the No. 1 Baylor women's bas
ketball team defeated No. 2 Stanford 59-47 in
the semifinals of the NCAA tournament in
Denver.
It was the fifth straight time the Cardinal
(35-2) had made the trip to the Final Four and
its fifth straight loss in the last two rounds. In the
previous four seasons it was knocked out of the
tournament by the eventual national champi
on, and many expect the undefeated Lady
Bears (39-0) to repeat that success. If it wins the
final, Baylor will also make history by becom
ing the first team to win 40 games in a season.
"Obviously, no one feels good after a loss, es
pecially if it's in the Final Four," senior forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike said after losing her last
collegiate game. "But I just kind of look back and
reflect on what it took for us to get here, and I
would have rather gone down with my team
than up with any other team."
Having not played against the Bears since
2008, a year before Associated Press National
Player of the Year Brittney Griner started her
collegiate career, both teams were unknown to
one another. Trying to crack the puzzle of how to
deal with the 6-foot-8 junior center, Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer set her team up
with the radical strategy of playing five on four;
leaving the Bears' junior guard Jordan Madden
(who had a shooting percentage in the tourna
ment of just 26.3) free to take her shot and using
the spare player to double-team Griner.
The tactic seemed to work. Griner had a rel
atively quiet game, going without scoring for a
full 15 minutes spanning halftime and ending
with 13 points, eight rebounds and just two
blocks. In comparison, Nneka Ogwumike
scored 22 points to set a new single-season

record for a Cardinal player with 807 points over
a single year, and also grabbed nine boards.
Beyond Griner's abilities to block shots, re
bound, shoot and even dunk, the real effect that
she has on other teams is that her presence
changes the way they play basketball. Stanford
had shot 42.1 percent from the field and 23.8 per
cent from beyond the arc in the tournament up
to Sunday's semifinal; against Baylor it shot just
33.3 percent and 11.8 percent from downtown.
Both Nneka Ogwumike and her sister, soph

omore forward Chiney, got into foul trouble in
the second hall) and when the latter fouled out
with 7:39 remaining in the game, the Cardinal
had trouble recovering. The Card also commit
ted 17 fouls to Baylor's nine, sending the Bears
to the charity stripe 26 times.
In the first half Stanford refused to let the
Lady Bears open up a gap and responded to an
early four-point deficit to tie and then lead the

Stanford senior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike put up 22 points in her final career game to set
a school record for scoring in a season, but Stanford was still eliminated in the Final Four.
