## Stanford slips, drops four of five 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The last week has been anything but a break
for the No. 3 Stanford baseball team, which
played seven games in eight days to open its
conference season. And while a pair of victories
against No. 29 USC in a doubleheader got that
busy stretch off to a promising start, spring
break quickly turned into a humbling experi
ence for the Cardinal (16-6,2-4 Pac-12), whose

sloppy play cost it four Pac-12 games in a row
and its first series loss of the season.

No. 15 Arizona ranked as highly as
eighth in some polls before the weekend
may have been picked to finish second in the
Pac-12 behind Stanford, but it got a quick series
win in Tucson, edging the Cardinal on Friday
and Saturday before securing the sweep Sun
day with its second straight complete-game
performance on the mound.
Stanford's play over the last several contests

seems hardly characteristic of the squad, which
jumped out to a 13-2 record before its confer
ence opener thanks to consistent defense and
excellent hitting from everyone in the lineup.
The Cardinal committed just 15 errors in its
first 17 contests but has tacked on 14 more in
the last five games alone. Meanwhile, its 1-2-3
batters have combined for just 10 hits over the
same stretch.
