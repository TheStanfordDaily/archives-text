## Stanford slips, drops four of five 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The last week has been anything but a break
for the No. 3 Stanford baseball team, which
played seven games in eight days to open its
conference season. And while a pair of victories
against No. 29 USC in a doubleheader got that
busy stretch off to a promising start, spring
break quickly turned into a humbling experi
ence for the Cardinal (16-6,2-4 Pac-12), whose

sloppy play cost it four Pac-12 games in a row
and its first series loss of the season.

No. 15 Arizona ranked as highly as
eighth in some polls before the weekend
may have been picked to finish second in the
Pac-12 behind Stanford, but it got a quick series
win in Tucson, edging the Cardinal on Friday
and Saturday before securing the sweep Sun
day with its second straight complete-game
performance on the mound.
Stanford's play over the last several contests

seems hardly characteristic of the squad, which
jumped out to a 13-2 record before its confer
ence opener thanks to consistent defense and
excellent hitting from everyone in the lineup.
The Cardinal committed just 15 errors in its
first 17 contests but has tacked on 14 more in
the last five games alone. Meanwhile, its 1-2-3
batters have combined for just 10 hits over the
same stretch.
Those deficiencies began to emerge
against the Trojans (16-9,3-5) who brought a
13-6 record to Sunken Diamond and kept
things close all weekend. After the March 24
game was postponed to the following after
noon due to rain, the Cardinal needed a
three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth and
a two-run, walk-off homer by sophomore
rightfielder Austin Wilson to get junior
righthander Mark Appel a complete-game
win in the series opener.
Junior lefthander Brett Mooneyham and
freshman closer David Schmidt held USC to
just two runs in the second game that
evening, but Stanford could barely squeak

out the 3-2 decision. The Cardinal would not
escape the mediocre weekend unscathed,
committing a season-high six errors five
of them by sophomore shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila in an 8-4 loss that saw freshman
starter John Hochstatter last just 1.2 innings.
The squad briefly returned to form on
Wednesday after another scheduling irregu
larity, which saw a rained-out Tuesday trip to
UC-Davis replaced at the last minute by a
home bout with St. Mary's. Stanford got
three runs on freshman designated hitter
Alex Blandino's first career homer and went
on to win 10-4, continuing its midweek dom
inance of the Gaels (14-12,1-5 WCC), which

came into the Wednesday matchup with the
lowest ERA in the country (2.04).
But errors would haunt the Cardinal yet
again against Arizona, and Stanford came up
short in a weekend series for the first time this
season. A passed ball set up a two-RBI single
for Blandino to open the scoring in the sec
ond inning of the Friday night opener, but
Arizona responded with two runs of its own
in the bottom half of the frame and jumped
out to a 4-3 lead in the third. Stanford showed
its resilience, though, knotting things up in the
sixth on a poor throw by Wildcat starter Kurt
Heyer and adding three more unearned runs
on a trio of Arizona errors in the seventh.

Appel rode the 7-4 advantage into the
bottom of the ninth, but hit the leadoff batter
and quickly walked another. Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess then brought in
Schmidt, and the freshman gave up a walk of
his own and allowed two runs with a one-out
single. Senior designated hitter Bobby
Brown then added a single which should
have just brought home the Wildcats' sev
enth tally, but the ball slipped under the glove
of sophomore centerfielder Jake Stewart for
his first error of the season and the winning
run came around to score.

The Saturday matchup between a pair of
undefeated starters 5-0 Mooneyham for
the Cardinal and 3-0 sophomore Konner
Wade for Wildcats produced a lower
scoring game than the 8-7 Friday contest. But
Stanford's lefthander was outdueled for the
first time this season, as Arizona's righty
pitched a complete-game three-hitter in a 4-
2 Wildcat victory.
The Cardinal couldn't break up the no
hitter until the top of the sixth but grasped a
momentary 2-1 lead on a rally set up by a
Kauppila infield single and a Stewart double.
Yet the Wildcats refused to back down, tack
ing on two runs of their own both un
earned in the bottom of the frame.

Stanford couldn't bring home its two en
suing baserunners in the seventh, couldn't
get another hit off Wade in the final three in
nings and couldn't draw even with Arizona,
which tacked on an eighth-inning run on
Schmidt's third hit batsman of the season en
route to a 4-2 win.
Defense was less of a concern for the Car
dinal in the Sunday finale, but the squad's
error-free performance was not nearly
enough, as its bats fell silent yet again to give
Arizona its first sweep over Stanford in 19
years.

A Wilson triple opened the scoring in the
top of the fourth as the Cardinal jumped out
to an early 2-0 lead, yet the Wildcats respond
ed with runs in the next three innings to give
freshman righty John Hochstatter (3-3) his
third straight loss. Sophomore righthander
James Farris (4-1) tossed a six-hit complete
game for Arizona in its 6-2 victory.
As little production as Stanford has got
ten out of its offense over the last week,
though, sophomore first baseman Brian Ra
gira has shown flashes of brilliance. He came
up with two hits off Farris and is currently rid
ing an eight-game hit streak.
Stanford will hope to revive the rest of its
lineup again tonight against the Gaels, which
will come to Sunken Diamond for the second
time in six days.Though the Cardinal beat St.
Mary's 5-0 on the road earlier this season be
fore last week's 10-4 win, both teams come
into this matchup fatigued just a day after re
turning from weekend road trips.

Sophomore first baseman Brian Ragira has been one of the few bright spots for the Cardinal lineup recently. He is riding an eight-game
hit streak even through the difficulties of the squad, which has lost four of its last five games, all of them against conference foes.
The last week has been anything but a break
for the No. 3 Stanford baseball team, which
played seven games in eight days to open its
conference season. And while a pair of victories
against No. 29 USC in a doubleheader got that
busy stretch off to a promising start, spring
break quickly turned into a humbling experi
ence for the Cardinal (16-6,2-4 Pac-12), whose

sloppy play cost it four Pac-12 games in a row
and its first series loss of the season.

No. 15 Arizona ranked as highly as
eighth in some polls before the weekend
may have been picked to finish second in the
Pac-12 behind Stanford, but it got a quick series
win in Tucson, edging the Cardinal on Friday
and Saturday before securing the sweep Sun
day with its second straight complete-game
performance on the mound.
Stanford's play over the last several contests

seems hardly characteristic of the squad, which
jumped out to a 13-2 record before its confer
ence opener thanks to consistent defense and
excellent hitting from everyone in the lineup.
The Cardinal committed just 15 errors in its
first 17 contests but has tacked on 14 more in
the last five games alone. Meanwhile, its 1-2-3
batters have combined for just 10 hits over the
same stretch.
Those deficiencies began to emerge
against the Trojans (16-9,3-5) who brought a
13-6 record to Sunken Diamond and kept
things close all weekend. After the March 24
game was postponed to the following after
noon due to rain, the Cardinal needed a
three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth and
a two-run, walk-off homer by sophomore
rightfielder Austin Wilson to get junior
righthander Mark Appel a complete-game
win in the series opener.
Junior lefthander Brett Mooneyham and
freshman closer David Schmidt held USC to
just two runs in the second game that
evening, but Stanford could barely squeak

out the 3-2 decision. The Cardinal would not
escape the mediocre weekend unscathed,
committing a season-high six errors five
of them by sophomore shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila in an 8-4 loss that saw freshman
starter John Hochstatter last just 1.2 innings.
The squad briefly returned to form on
Wednesday after another scheduling irregu
larity, which saw a rained-out Tuesday trip to
UC-Davis replaced at the last minute by a
home bout with St. Mary's. Stanford got
three runs on freshman designated hitter
Alex Blandino's first career homer and went
on to win 10-4, continuing its midweek dom
inance of the Gaels (14-12,1-5 WCC), which

came into the Wednesday matchup with the
lowest ERA in the country (2.04).
But errors would haunt the Cardinal yet
again against Arizona, and Stanford came up
short in a weekend series for the first time this
season. A passed ball set up a two-RBI single
for Blandino to open the scoring in the sec
ond inning of the Friday night opener, but
Arizona responded with two runs of its own
in the bottom half of the frame and jumped
out to a 4-3 lead in the third. Stanford showed
its resilience, though, knotting things up in the
sixth on a poor throw by Wildcat starter Kurt
Heyer and adding three more unearned runs
on a trio of Arizona errors in the seventh.

Appel rode the 7-4 advantage into the
bottom of the ninth, but hit the leadoff batter
and quickly walked another. Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess then brought in
Schmidt, and the freshman gave up a walk of
his own and allowed two runs with a one-out
single. Senior designated hitter Bobby
Brown then added a single which should
have just brought home the Wildcats' sev
enth tally, but the ball slipped under the glove
of sophomore centerfielder Jake Stewart for
his first error of the season and the winning
run came around to score.

The Saturday matchup between a pair of
undefeated starters 5-0 Mooneyham for
the Cardinal and 3-0 sophomore Konner
Wade for Wildcats produced a lower
scoring game than the 8-7 Friday contest. But
Stanford's lefthander was outdueled for the
first time this season, as Arizona's righty
pitched a complete-game three-hitter in a 4-
2 Wildcat victory.
The Cardinal couldn't break up the no
hitter until the top of the sixth but grasped a
momentary 2-1 lead on a rally set up by a
Kauppila infield single and a Stewart double.
Yet the Wildcats refused to back down, tack
ing on two runs of their own both un
earned in the bottom of the frame.

Stanford couldn't bring home its two en
suing baserunners in the seventh, couldn't
get another hit off Wade in the final three in
nings and couldn't draw even with Arizona,
which tacked on an eighth-inning run on
Schmidt's third hit batsman of the season en
route to a 4-2 win.
Defense was less of a concern for the Car
dinal in the Sunday finale, but the squad's
error-free performance was not nearly
enough, as its bats fell silent yet again to give
Arizona its first sweep over Stanford in 19
years.

A Wilson triple opened the scoring in the
top of the fourth as the Cardinal jumped out
to an early 2-0 lead, yet the Wildcats respond
ed with runs in the next three innings to give
freshman righty John Hochstatter (3-3) his
third straight loss. Sophomore righthander
James Farris (4-1) tossed a six-hit complete
game for Arizona in its 6-2 victory.
As little production as Stanford has got
ten out of its offense over the last week,
though, sophomore first baseman Brian Ra
gira has shown flashes of brilliance. He came
up with two hits off Farris and is currently rid
ing an eight-game hit streak.
