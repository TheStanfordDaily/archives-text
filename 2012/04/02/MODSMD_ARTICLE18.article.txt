# Men are a trendier team
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
For several years, there has
really been no comparison
between Stanford men's
basketball and women's
basketball. While the men
have struggled to get over .500, the
women have been blowing out their
opposition left and right. The men
haven't been able to sniff NCAA
tournament contention, whereas the
women are locks to be national title
contenders year after year.
This year, that reality has not
changed one bit. In a weak Pac-12,
the Stanford men still managed to
finish in the bottom half of the con
ference, and the team has been on
such a downward trend that an NIT
berth was seen as quite an achieve
ment. On the other hand, the women
continued their destruction of the
Pac-12 by running their winning
streak over conference foes to 78
games and had an overall winning
streak of 32 games this year.
However, sometimes perception
plays an even bigger role than reality,
and for the first time in recent mem
ory, the perception is much more fa
vorable to the Stanford men than the
women.

Stanford women's basketball has
gone to the Final Four each of the last
five years, which is one of the most
impressive streaks in the sport's his
tory. But after falling to No. 1 Baylor
last night, the Cardinal has yet again
failed to secure the elusive national
title. For the seniors, particularly Ail-
American Nnemkadi Ogwumike,
last night marks the end of four un
satisfying trips to the Final Four. At
some point, the national view of
Stanford women's basketball has be
come similar to that of Andy Murray
in men's tennis —an immaculate
record and total domination of lesser
foes, but just not enough against the
top-quality competition to win the
big one.

For a team with such an impres
sive resume and the amount of talent
that Stanford has, almost no one in
the media gave Stanford a shot to
win the national championship,
which says something about the ef
fect of all these Final Four defeats.
I'm not suggesting that the team has
stopped believing it can win, but you
have to wonder if doubts start creep
ing in when Stanford falls behind by
eight or 10 points deep in the postsea
son.

Doubts about whether the team
can indeed close the deal can also be
detrimental to recruiting. Stanford

will invariably have one of the top re
cruiting classes in the country
thanks to its success under Tara
VanDerveer and the allure of what
the Farm has to offer. The only
question is if that one extra top re
cruit will pick a place like Connecti
cut instead of Stanford. And if
you've watched any amount of
women's basketball, you know
what kind of impact one player can
have (see: Brittney Griner, Maya
Moore, Candace Parker, Diana
Taurasi, etc.).
Meanwhile, the Stanford men's
basketball team has faced none of
the expectations and pressure that
have followed the women for years.
The Stanford men quietly extended
their season with an NIT berth, and
despite less-than-stellar attendance
at Maples Pavilion, the Cardinal ad
vanced past Cleveland State before
the rest of the bracket disintegrated
in Stanford's favor.
As a three-seed, Stanford faced
two five-seeds, two six-seeds and a
seven-seed while playing three
home games and two neutral-site
games en route to an NIT title. Al
though no win in particular was
truly notable (Stanford was favored
in all five), stringing together five
straight wins in any postseason
tournament is impressive. Winning
games you should win is an impor
tant part of sports —just ask Mis
souri and Duke and it's an area

where Stanford has struggled (see:
losses to Butler and Utah).
In the past few weeks, though,
the Stanford men did anything but
struggle. The Cardinal played in
spired basketball, getting impres
sive contributions from a variety of
players while gaining momentum
with each game. The way Stanford
played on both ends of the floor by
the end of the tournament brought
back memories of the "good old
days" of Mike Montgomery and
yearly trips to the Big Dance. It was
easily the best Stanford has looked
in Johnny Dawkins' four-year
tenure, and it brought back some
thing that has been missing for all
four of those years: hope. For once,
Stanford men's basketball is trend
ing upward, and with a strong crop
of recruits ready to join the Cardi
nal's solid core of underclassmen,
the future looks bright.
Of course, if you're placing early
bets on the 2012-13 season,you'd still
be smart to predict the Stanford
women to advance deep into the
NCAAs, and you'd be foolish to ex
pect the men to do the same.
But for the first time in a long time,
the buzz surrounding the men's team
has at least equaled that of the
women's team. And considering that
women's team just made the national
semifinals for the fifth straight year,
I'd call that a pretty positive sign.

Brittney Griner one-on-one to re

For several years, there has
really been no comparison
between Stanford men's
basketball and women's
basketball. While the men
have struggled to get over .500, the
women have been blowing out their
opposition left and right. The men
haven't been able to sniff NCAA
tournament contention, whereas the
women are locks to be national title
contenders year after year.
This year, that reality has not
changed one bit. In a weak Pac-12,
the Stanford men still managed to
finish in the bottom half of the con
ference, and the team has been on
such a downward trend that an NIT
berth was seen as quite an achieve
ment. On the other hand, the women
continued their destruction of the
Pac-12 by running their winning
streak over conference foes to 78
games and had an overall winning
streak of 32 games this year.
However, sometimes perception
plays an even bigger role than reality,
and for the first time in recent mem
ory, the perception is much more fa
vorable to the Stanford men than the
women.

Stanford women's basketball has
gone to the Final Four each of the last
five years, which is one of the most
impressive streaks in the sport's his
tory. But after falling to No. 1 Baylor
last night, the Cardinal has yet again
failed to secure the elusive national
title. For the seniors, particularly Ail-
American Nnemkadi Ogwumike,
last night marks the end of four un
satisfying trips to the Final Four. At
some point, the national view of
Stanford women's basketball has be
come similar to that of Andy Murray
in men's tennis —an immaculate
record and total domination of lesser
foes, but just not enough against the
top-quality competition to win the
big one.

For a team with such an impres
sive resume and the amount of talent
that Stanford has, almost no one in
the media gave Stanford a shot to
win the national championship,
which says something about the ef
fect of all these Final Four defeats.
I'm not suggesting that the team has
stopped believing it can win, but you
have to wonder if doubts start creep
ing in when Stanford falls behind by
eight or 10 points deep in the postsea
son.

Doubts about whether the team
can indeed close the deal can also be
detrimental to recruiting. Stanford

will invariably have one of the top re
cruiting classes in the country
thanks to its success under Tara
VanDerveer and the allure of what
the Farm has to offer. The only
question is if that one extra top re
cruit will pick a place like Connecti
cut instead of Stanford. And if
you've watched any amount of
women's basketball, you know
what kind of impact one player can
have (see: Brittney Griner, Maya
Moore, Candace Parker, Diana
Taurasi, etc.).
Meanwhile, the Stanford men's
basketball team has faced none of
the expectations and pressure that
have followed the women for years.
The Stanford men quietly extended
their season with an NIT berth, and
despite less-than-stellar attendance
at Maples Pavilion, the Cardinal ad
vanced past Cleveland State before
the rest of the bracket disintegrated
in Stanford's favor.
As a three-seed, Stanford faced
two five-seeds, two six-seeds and a
seven-seed while playing three
home games and two neutral-site
games en route to an NIT title. Al
though no win in particular was
truly notable (Stanford was favored
in all five), stringing together five
straight wins in any postseason
tournament is impressive. Winning
games you should win is an impor
tant part of sports —just ask Mis
souri and Duke and it's an area

where Stanford has struggled (see:
losses to Butler and Utah).
In the past few weeks, though,
the Stanford men did anything but
struggle. The Cardinal played in
spired basketball, getting impres
sive contributions from a variety of
players while gaining momentum
with each game. The way Stanford
played on both ends of the floor by
the end of the tournament brought
back memories of the "good old
days" of Mike Montgomery and
yearly trips to the Big Dance. It was
easily the best Stanford has looked
in Johnny Dawkins' four-year
tenure, and it brought back some
thing that has been missing for all
four of those years: hope. For once,
Stanford men's basketball is trend
ing upward, and with a strong crop
of recruits ready to join the Cardi
nal's solid core of underclassmen,
the future looks bright.
Of course, if you're placing early
bets on the 2012-13 season,you'd still
be smart to predict the Stanford
women to advance deep into the
NCAAs, and you'd be foolish to ex
pect the men to do the same.
But for the first time in a long time,
the buzz surrounding the men's team
has at least equaled that of the
women's team. And considering that
women's team just made the national
semifinals for the fifth straight year,
I'd call that a pretty positive sign.
