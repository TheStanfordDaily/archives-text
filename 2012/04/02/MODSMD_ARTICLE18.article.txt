# Men are a trendier team
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
For several years, there has
really been no comparison
between Stanford men's
basketball and women's
basketball. While the men
have struggled to get over .500, the
women have been blowing out their
opposition left and right. The men
haven't been able to sniff NCAA
tournament contention, whereas the
women are locks to be national title
contenders year after year.
This year, that reality has not
changed one bit. In a weak Pac-12,
the Stanford men still managed to
finish in the bottom half of the con
ference, and the team has been on
such a downward trend that an NIT
berth was seen as quite an achieve
ment. On the other hand, the women
continued their destruction of the
Pac-12 by running their winning
streak over conference foes to 78
games and had an overall winning
streak of 32 games this year.
However, sometimes perception
plays an even bigger role than reality,
and for the first time in recent mem
ory, the perception is much more fa
vorable to the Stanford men than the
women.

Stanford women's basketball has
gone to the Final Four each of the last
five years, which is one of the most
impressive streaks in the sport's his
tory. But after falling to No. 1 Baylor
last night, the Cardinal has yet again
failed to secure the elusive national
title. For the seniors, particularly Ail-
American Nnemkadi Ogwumike,
last night marks the end of four un
satisfying trips to the Final Four. At
some point, the national view of
Stanford women's basketball has be
come similar to that of Andy Murray
in men's tennis â€”an immaculate
record and total domination of lesser
foes, but just not enough against the
top-quality competition to win the
big one.

For a team with such an impres
sive resume and the amount of talent
that Stanford has, almost no one in
the media gave Stanford a shot to
win the national championship,
which says something about the ef
fect of all these Final Four defeats.
I'm not suggesting that the team has
stopped believing it can win, but you
have to wonder if doubts start creep
ing in when Stanford falls behind by
eight or 10 points deep in the postsea
son.

Doubts about whether the team
can indeed close the deal can also be
detrimental to recruiting. Stanford
