After finishing seventh in the Pac-12 dur
ing the regular season, Stanford found itself
in the postseason for the first time since 2009,
competing in the National Invitational Tour
nament (NIT). The Cardinal would end up
cruising through the bracket and securing the
second NIT title in school history, finishing a
once-disappointing season with an impres
sive 26-11 record.
"This season has been a little bit of a roller
coaster ride for us," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "We started off so strong, battled
through some adversity in the middle and
then we ended as strong as we ever could
have imagined."
As the No. 3 seed in its region, Stanford
faced No. 6 Cleveland State in the opening
round. The Cardinal took an early lead, but
the Vikings mounted a furious comeback,
cutting the Stanford advantage to just one at
the half.

After the break, an early three by Cleve
land State gave the Vikings their first lead of
the game at 33-31. Forward Anthony Brown
then scored six unanswered points as the
Cardinal retook control of the game. Stan
ford pushed the lead as high as 20 points with
three minutes remaining, ultimately winning
76-65.

Brown led the Cardinal, as the sophomore
complemented his 15 points with a career
high 12 rebounds in one of his greatest games
at the Farm. Sophomore guard Aaron Bright
also had the first of his many brilliant tourna
ment performances with a game-high 17
points.
In the second round, Stanford found itself
pitted against No. 7 Illinois State, which was
coming off a stunning overtime upset of No. 2

Sophomore guard Aaron Bright averaged 16.8 points per game in the NIT, never scoring below double figures, and was named the
tournament's Most Outstanding Player after Stanford dominated Minnesota 75-51 in the final at Madison Square Garden in New York.
