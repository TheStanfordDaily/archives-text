# CARD CAPTURES NIT CROWN
## 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ ANDERS MIKKELSEN 
After finishing seventh in the Pac-12 dur
ing the regular season, Stanford found itself
in the postseason for the first time since 2009,
competing in the National Invitational Tour
nament (NIT). The Cardinal would end up
cruising through the bracket and securing the
second NIT title in school history, finishing a
once-disappointing season with an impres
sive 26-11 record.
"This season has been a little bit of a roller
coaster ride for us," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "We started off so strong, battled
through some adversity in the middle and
then we ended as strong as we ever could
have imagined."
As the No. 3 seed in its region, Stanford
faced No. 6 Cleveland State in the opening
round. The Cardinal took an early lead, but
the Vikings mounted a furious comeback,
cutting the Stanford advantage to just one at
the half.

After the break, an early three by Cleve
land State gave the Vikings their first lead of
the game at 33-31. Forward Anthony Brown
then scored six unanswered points as the
Cardinal retook control of the game. Stan
ford pushed the lead as high as 20 points with
three minutes remaining, ultimately winning
76-65.

Brown led the Cardinal, as the sophomore
complemented his 15 points with a career
high 12 rebounds in one of his greatest games
at the Farm. Sophomore guard Aaron Bright
also had the first of his many brilliant tourna
ment performances with a game-high 17
points.
In the second round, Stanford found itself
pitted against No. 7 Illinois State, which was
coming off a stunning overtime upset of No. 2

Sophomore guard Aaron Bright averaged 16.8 points per game in the NIT, never scoring below double figures, and was named the
tournament's Most Outstanding Player after Stanford dominated Minnesota 75-51 in the final at Madison Square Garden in New York.
Ole Miss in the opening round
and was looking to do the same to
the Cardinal.
The matchup was back and
forth for the first half, yet Illinois
State began to pull away in the
second. The Redbirds took an 11-
point lead before Bright took
over with nine straight points, and
the Cardinal began to even the
game up.

With the game tied at 78 and 20
seconds left on the clock, Stanford
held the ball hoping for a last-sec
ond victory. Unfortunately, a con
tested three by freshman guard
Chasson Randle would fall off the
mark, sending the game to over
time. While the Redbirds contin
ued to put up a fight, the Cardinal
prevailed 92-88 in the extra ses
sion.

The star of the game was again
Bright, who put up a game-high 29
points while shooting 11 of 13
from the field. The sophomore hit
six threes and also dished out six
assists. His backcourt mate Ran
dle added 19 points, while sopho
more forward Dwight Powell had
a season-high 18 as well as nine
rebounds off the bench.

The victory secured Stanford's
spot in the NlT's Elite Eight,
where the Cardinal hosted No. 5
Nevada. The Wolf Pack had not
been seriously tested in either of
its first two games, defeating both
No. 4 Oral Roberts and No. 8
Bucknell with ease.
In front of a home crowd for
the last time this season, Stanford
put on a show. The Cardinal
cruised to a 15-point lead in the
first half and didn't let up, thrash
ing Nevada, 84-56. Senior center
Josh Owens made the most of his
final game at Maples Pavilion,
pouring in a game-high 15 points,
while Randle was his usual bril
liant self, also scoring 15 as Stan
ford headed to the Final Four in
New York.

Stanford brought in Baltimore
Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis as
its pre-game motivational speak
er before the Cardinal's semifinal
matchup with Massachusetts, and
his speech propelled the team to
play its best basketball of the
year.

"If you ain't pissed off for
greatness, then you're okay with
being mediocre," Lewis told the
Stanford players. Unfortunately
for the UMass Minutemen, the
Card was definitely pissed off for
greatness that Tuesday night.

Stanford controlled much of
the first half, riding the wave of
momentum from Lewis' pep talk
to take an early lead. Nearly every
offensive possession resulted in
an easy bucket. A pair of 3-point
ers from Bright and Randle gave
the Cardinal its biggest lead of the
first half, as the squad went up 26-
14.

But UMass would turn it
around, buckling down on de
fense and heating up offensively.
The Minutemen began playing
selfless basketball, spreading the
ball around and setting them
selves up with open shots to go on
a quick 9-1 run and pull to within
two points of the Card. Stanford
could not break away from
UMass, and at the end of the first
half, Stanford led just 36-33 with a
chance to play for the NIT cham
pionship on the line.
Neither team managed to find
its offensive rhythm for the first
few minutes of the second half, as
they combined for just two field
goals in the first 2:44. The Minute
men managed to keep pace with
the Cardinal, answering each
Stanford score with a bucket of
their own. With just 7:17 remain
ing, sophomore guard Chaz
Williams hit a jumper to tie the
game at 52 apiece, but Bright
countered almost immediately
with a jumper on Stanford's next
possession. The sophomore had a
great game for the Cardinal, scor
ing 13 points off the bench. The
Cardinal would not lose their
lead, going on to beat UMass 74-
64 and earning the chance to play

Minnesota in the finals.

The last time Stanford played
in the NIT championship game
was 1991, when it beat Oklahoma
to capture the crown. The Cardi
nal was hoping for a similar result
against the Minnesota Golden
Gophers, a No. 6 seed that had
played well to earn its bid in the
championship game.
In the title matchup, the Cardi
nal delivered its most impressive
performance of the season
against a Minnesota team that
was completely overwhelmed.
Stanford could not have picked a
better game to shoot 50 percent
from the field and 46 percent
from the 3-point line, as well as
force 22 turnovers and grab 36 re
bounds. After senior Jarrett Mann
grabbed a steal and converted the
transition layup to even the score
at 21, Stanford would not look
back, closing out the first half on a

10-4 run to take a six-point lead.
The second half would be a
completely different story. Stan
ford scored 11 straight points to
open the period, cruising by Min
nesota on its way to an easy 75-51
victory. The Cardinal was firing on
all cylinders, converting both in
the paint and beyond the arc. The
guard combination of Randle and
Bright led the way, scoring 15
points each to help Stanford earn
its first NIT championship in 21
years. Bright's performance won
him Most Outstanding Player
honors for the tournament.

"We have had good runs be
fore, but never on a stage of this
magnitude where you're playing
for a championship," Dawkins
said of the dominant second half.
"It says a lot about our kids, their
belief and them being able to
share in those experiences."

The season could not have

ended on a more positive note for
the Card, and their dominant per
formance provided just a glimpse
of things to come. While seniors
Mann, Josh Owens, Andrew Zim
merman and Jack Trotter will be
missed — along with associate
head coach Dick Davey, who is re
tiring after a storied career — the
Cardinal boasts a young core that
will help it make a mark on the
NCAA next season and hopefully
earn an elusive spot in the Big
Dance.
With sophomores Bright, An
thony Brown and forward Josh
Huestis back next year along with
freshman standout Randle, Stan
ford has the pieces in place to
make a run at a Pac-12 title —
and maybe even a little more.

the Cardinal, answering each
Stanford score with a bucket of
their own. With just 7:17 remain
ing, sophomore guard Chaz
Williams hit a jumper to tie the
game at 52 apiece, but Bright
countered almost immediately
with a jumper on Stanford's next
possession. The sophomore had a
great game for the Cardinal, scor
ing 13 points off the bench. The
Cardinal would not lose their
lead, going on to beat UMass 74-
64 and earning the chance to play

Minnesota in the finals.

The last time Stanford played
in the NIT championship game
was 1991, when it beat Oklahoma
to capture the crown. The Cardi
nal was hoping for a similar result
against the Minnesota Golden
Gophers, a No. 6 seed that had
played well to earn its bid in the
championship game.
In the title matchup, the Cardi
nal delivered its most impressive
performance of the season
against a Minnesota team that
was completely overwhelmed.
Stanford could not have picked a
better game to shoot 50 percent
from the field and 46 percent
from the 3-point line, as well as
force 22 turnovers and grab 36 re
bounds. After senior Jarrett Mann
grabbed a steal and converted the
transition layup to even the score
at 21, Stanford would not look
back, closing out the first half on a

10-4 run to take a six-point lead.
The second half would be a
completely different story. Stan
ford scored 11 straight points to
open the period, cruising by Min
nesota on its way to an easy 75-51
victory. The Cardinal was firing on
all cylinders, converting both in
the paint and beyond the arc. The
guard combination of Randle and
Bright led the way, scoring 15
points each to help Stanford earn
its first NIT championship in 21
years. Bright's performance won
him Most Outstanding Player
honors for the tournament.

"We have had good runs be
fore, but never on a stage of this
magnitude where you're playing
for a championship," Dawkins
said of the dominant second half.
"It says a lot about our kids, their
belief and them being able to
share in those experiences."

The season could not have

ended on a more positive note for
the Card, and their dominant per
formance provided just a glimpse
of things to come. While seniors
Mann, Josh Owens, Andrew Zim
merman and Jack Trotter will be
missed — along with associate
head coach Dick Davey, who is re
tiring after a storied career — the
Cardinal boasts a young core that
will help it make a mark on the
NCAA next season and hopefully
earn an elusive spot in the Big
Dance.

After finishing seventh in the Pac-12 dur
ing the regular season, Stanford found itself
in the postseason for the first time since 2009,
competing in the National Invitational Tour
nament (NIT). The Cardinal would end up
cruising through the bracket and securing the
second NIT title in school history, finishing a
once-disappointing season with an impres
sive 26-11 record.
"This season has been a little bit of a roller
coaster ride for us," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "We started off so strong, battled
through some adversity in the middle and
then we ended as strong as we ever could
have imagined."
As the No. 3 seed in its region, Stanford
faced No. 6 Cleveland State in the opening
round. The Cardinal took an early lead, but
the Vikings mounted a furious comeback,
cutting the Stanford advantage to just one at
the half.

After the break, an early three by Cleve
land State gave the Vikings their first lead of
the game at 33-31. Forward Anthony Brown
then scored six unanswered points as the
Cardinal retook control of the game. Stan
ford pushed the lead as high as 20 points with
three minutes remaining, ultimately winning
76-65.

Brown led the Cardinal, as the sophomore
complemented his 15 points with a career
high 12 rebounds in one of his greatest games
at the Farm. Sophomore guard Aaron Bright
also had the first of his many brilliant tourna
ment performances with a game-high 17
points.
In the second round, Stanford found itself
pitted against No. 7 Illinois State, which was
coming off a stunning overtime upset of No. 2

and was looking to do the same to
the Cardinal.
The matchup was back and
forth for the first half, yet Illinois
State began to pull away in the
second. The Redbirds took an 11-
point lead before Bright took
over with nine straight points, and
the Cardinal began to even the
game up.

With the game tied at 78 and 20
seconds left on the clock, Stanford
held the ball hoping for a last-sec
ond victory. Unfortunately, a con
tested three by freshman guard
Chasson Randle would fall off the
mark, sending the game to over
time. While the Redbirds contin
ued to put up a fight, the Cardinal
prevailed 92-88 in the extra ses
sion.

The star of the game was again
Bright, who put up a game-high 29
points while shooting 11 of 13
from the field. The sophomore hit
six threes and also dished out six
assists. His backcourt mate Ran
dle added 19 points, while sopho
more forward Dwight Powell had
a season-high 18 as well as nine
rebounds off the bench.

The victory secured Stanford's
spot in the NlT's Elite Eight,
where the Cardinal hosted No. 5
Nevada. The Wolf Pack had not
been seriously tested in either of
its first two games, defeating both
No. 4 Oral Roberts and No. 8
Bucknell with ease.
In front of a home crowd for
the last time this season, Stanford
put on a show. The Cardinal
cruised to a 15-point lead in the
first half and didn't let up, thrash
ing Nevada, 84-56. Senior center
Josh Owens made the most of his
final game at Maples Pavilion,
pouring in a game-high 15 points,
while Randle was his usual bril
liant self, also scoring 15 as Stan
ford headed to the Final Four in
New York.

Stanford brought in Baltimore
Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis as
its pre-game motivational speak
er before the Cardinal's semifinal
matchup with Massachusetts, and
his speech propelled the team to
play its best basketball of the
year.

"If you ain't pissed off for
greatness, then you're okay with
being mediocre," Lewis told the
Stanford players. Unfortunately
for the UMass Minutemen, the
Card was definitely pissed off for
greatness that Tuesday night.

Stanford controlled much of
the first half, riding the wave of
momentum from Lewis' pep talk
to take an early lead. Nearly every
offensive possession resulted in
an easy bucket. A pair of 3-point
ers from Bright and Randle gave
the Cardinal its biggest lead of the
first half, as the squad went up 26-
14.

But UMass would turn it
around, buckling down on de
fense and heating up offensively.
The Minutemen began playing
selfless basketball, spreading the
ball around and setting them
selves up with open shots to go on
a quick 9-1 run and pull to within
two points of the Card. Stanford
could not break away from
UMass, and at the end of the first
half, Stanford led just 36-33 with a
chance to play for the NIT cham
pionship on the line.
Neither team managed to find
its offensive rhythm for the first
few minutes of the second half, as
they combined for just two field
goals in the first 2:44. The Minute
men managed to keep pace with
the Cardinal, answering each
Stanford score with a bucket of

State began to pull away in the
second. The Redbirds took an 11-
point lead before Bright took
over with nine straight points, and
the Cardinal began to even the
game up.

With the game tied at 78 and 20
seconds left on the clock, Stanford
held the ball hoping for a last-sec
ond victory. Unfortunately, a con
tested three by freshman guard
Chasson Randle would fall off the
mark, sending the game to over
time. While the Redbirds contin
ued to put up a fight, the Cardinal
prevailed 92-88 in the extra ses
sion.

The star of the game was again
Bright, who put up a game-high 29
points while shooting 11 of 13
from the field. The sophomore hit
six threes and also dished out six
assists. His backcourt mate Ran
dle added 19 points, while sopho
more forward Dwight Powell had
a season-high 18 as well as nine
rebounds off the bench.

The victory secured Stanford's
spot in the NlT's Elite Eight,
where the Cardinal hosted No. 5
Nevada. The Wolf Pack had not
been seriously tested in either of
its first two games, defeating both
No. 4 Oral Roberts and No. 8
Bucknell with ease.
In front of a home crowd for
the last time this season, Stanford
put on a show. The Cardinal
cruised to a 15-point lead in the
first half and didn't let up, thrash
ing Nevada, 84-56. Senior center
Josh Owens made the most of his
final game at Maples Pavilion,
pouring in a game-high 15 points,
while Randle was his usual bril
liant self, also scoring 15 as Stan
ford headed to the Final Four in
New York.

Stanford brought in Baltimore
Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis as
its pre-game motivational speak
er before the Cardinal's semifinal
matchup with Massachusetts, and
his speech propelled the team to
play its best basketball of the
year.

"If you ain't pissed off for
greatness, then you're okay with
being mediocre," Lewis told the
Stanford players. Unfortunately
for the UMass Minutemen, the
Card was definitely pissed off for
greatness that Tuesday night.

Stanford controlled much of
the first half, riding the wave of
momentum from Lewis' pep talk
to take an early lead. Nearly every
offensive possession resulted in
an easy bucket. A pair of 3-point
ers from Bright and Randle gave
the Cardinal its biggest lead of the
first half, as the squad went up 26-
14.

But UMass would turn it
around, buckling down on de
fense and heating up offensively.
The Minutemen began playing
selfless basketball, spreading the
ball around and setting them
selves up with open shots to go on
a quick 9-1 run and pull to within
two points of the Card. Stanford
could not break away from
UMass, and at the end of the first
half, Stanford led just 36-33 with a
chance to play for the NIT cham
pionship on the line.
Neither team managed to find
its offensive rhythm for the first
few minutes of the second half, as
they combined for just two field
goals in the first 2:44. The Minute
men managed to keep pace with
the Cardinal, answering each
Stanford score with a bucket of
their own. With just 7:17 remain
ing, sophomore guard Chaz
Williams hit a jumper to tie the
game at 52 apiece, but Bright
countered almost immediately
with a jumper on Stanford's next
possession. The sophomore had a
great game for the Cardinal, scor
ing 13 points off the bench. The
Cardinal would not lose their
lead, going on to beat UMass 74-
64 and earning the chance to play

Minnesota in the finals.

The last time Stanford played
in the NIT championship game
was 1991, when it beat Oklahoma
to capture the crown. The Cardi
nal was hoping for a similar result
against the Minnesota Golden
Gophers, a No. 6 seed that had
played well to earn its bid in the
championship game.
In the title matchup, the Cardi
nal delivered its most impressive
performance of the season
against a Minnesota team that
was completely overwhelmed.
Stanford could not have picked a
better game to shoot 50 percent
from the field and 46 percent
from the 3-point line, as well as
force 22 turnovers and grab 36 re
bounds. After senior Jarrett Mann
grabbed a steal and converted the
transition layup to even the score
at 21, Stanford would not look
back, closing out the first half on a

10-4 run to take a six-point lead.
The second half would be a
completely different story. Stan
ford scored 11 straight points to
open the period, cruising by Min
nesota on its way to an easy 75-51
victory. The Cardinal was firing on
all cylinders, converting both in
the paint and beyond the arc. The
guard combination of Randle and
Bright led the way, scoring 15
points each to help Stanford earn
its first NIT championship in 21
years. Bright's performance won
him Most Outstanding Player
honors for the tournament.

"We have had good runs be
fore, but never on a stage of this
magnitude where you're playing
for a championship," Dawkins
said of the dominant second half.
"It says a lot about our kids, their
belief and them being able to
share in those experiences."

The season could not have

ended on a more positive note for
the Card, and their dominant per
formance provided just a glimpse
of things to come. While seniors
Mann, Josh Owens, Andrew Zim
merman and Jack Trotter will be
missed — along with associate
head coach Dick Davey, who is re
tiring after a storied career — the
Cardinal boasts a young core that
will help it make a mark on the
NCAA next season and hopefully
earn an elusive spot in the Big
Dance.
With sophomores Bright, An
thony Brown and forward Josh
Huestis back next year along with
freshman standout Randle, Stan
ford has the pieces in place to
make a run at a Pac-12 title —
and maybe even a little more.
