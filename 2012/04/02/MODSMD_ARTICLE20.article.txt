# LUCK SHINES AT PRO DAY
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
In his last chance to impress scouts
and media members before April's NFL
draft, redshirt junior quarterback An
drew Luck didn't disappoint, putting to
gether a dazzling performance at the
Stanford football pro day on March 22.
And while the superstar quarterback
and future first overall pick didn't exactly
have a lot on the line at his pro day his
talent has been well-documented for
more than two years Luck still capital
ized on the opportunity to show more
than 100 scouts from all 32 NFL teams
just who will be taking snaps next season.
On a cold, windy day on the Farm,
Luck completed 46 of his 50 passes on
throws that highlighted his mobility, in
cluding several snaps where Luck was
forced to race away from a coach chasing
with a broom that was intended to simu
late the reach and speed of an NFL pass
rusher.

"I wanted to put my best foot forward
and show that I could make all the throws
that I am going to be asked to do. I
thought I did that to a degree, so it was a
good day in that regard," Luck said after
ward. "I wanted to go out there and show
that I could make every throw that an
NFL quarterback has to make."
Luck also said the pro day was a good
opportunity to highlight what he'd been
working on so far this offseason with
quarterback coach George Whitfield, the
mentor to last year's number one overall
pick, Carolina Panthers passer Cam New
ton.

"I've been working a lot on throwing
from awkward positions, maybe different
positions," Luck said. "I've tried to work
that in to some of the throws. Whether it's
running left and trying to get it across
your body or types of throws like that are
going to be throws you will have a chance
to complete at the next level."
With his final throw of the day, Luck
took the opportunity to add one addition
al highlight and show off a little bit,
launching a 70-yard pass downfield into
the hands of senior wide receiver Chris
Owusu, who dropped the pass at the goal
line.

"I think he could probably throw it
further than that," redshirt senior tight
end Coby Fleener said.
"Maybe, in fact, his arm strength isn't
his weakness after all," Fleener contin
ued, adding a quick shot at the scouts and
media members that have criticized
Luck's deep passing abilities this season.
For his part, Fleener also impressed

the NFL scouts by showcasing his impres
sive speed. The 6-foot-6,247-pound tight
end wowed teams by running the 40-yard
dash in 4.4 seconds, an effort that likely
helped Fleener solidify his status as a
first-round pick as the best tight end in
this season's draft class.

Also impressing were defensive tackle
Matthew Masifilo, safety Delano Howell
and cornerback Johnson Bademosi.
Masifilo showed off his strength by
bench-pressing 225 pounds 38 times,
Howell improved on his performance at
February's NFL combine by recording a
better broad jump, vertical leap and 40-
yard dash, and Bademosi blazed his way
to a 4.3-second 40-yard dash, then topped
it off with a 40-inch vertical leap of his
own.

Conversely, offensive tackle and likely
first-round pick Jonathan Martin, who
was unable to participate in the NFL
combine due to illness, didn't have a great
day. Martin only notched 20 reps on the
225-pound bench press, a low number for
an offensive lineman.

However, Martin and fellow first
round lineman David DeCastro both said
the atmosphere and fanfare of the pro
day were exciting as they head towards
the NFL draft.

"It is always nice when you can prove
your talents to as many people as possi
ble," Martin said. "It's always fun to get in
front of people and show what you can
do. I prefer to play football, obviously. I
am never going to run 40 yards in a game,
unless it is chasing down an interception
or something, but yeah, it is always fun to
compete."
Even though he did not run or partici
pate in any of the pro day drills, DeCastro
added that the event helped him to con
tinue to motivate himself as his NFL ca
reer comes ever closer.

"I still think that I might not get draft
ed, that is how I push myself," he said.
"The fear of failure, you have to get bet
ter every day or you aren't going to be any
good."

Martin echoed his teammate's senti
ments, saying that he wasn't going to
spend any time speculating about where
he might be drafted on April 26 at New
York's Radio City Music Hall.
"It's something that you can't pay at
tention to," he said. "There is all kinds of
buzz, but you don't think about it as a
player. You concentrate on what you can
do, set goals for yourself and cancel out all
the outside noise."
