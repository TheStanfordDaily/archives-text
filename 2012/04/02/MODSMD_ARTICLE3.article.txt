## Research suggests future of stroke recovery 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF — Alice Phillips 
Researchers at the School of Medicine
recently identified two molecules as poten
tially having a significant impact on future
stroke treatment and recovery.
Mice that were genetically engineered
to lack two immune system molecules or

their corresponding cell receptor in the
brain were better able to regain advanced
motor functions following a stroke.
The molecules, "K" and "D," and their
cell receptor, Pirß, are usually involved in
regulating the brain's ability to form and
eliminate connections between neurons.

Researchers found that when per
formed in excess, the formation and elimi
nation of brain synapses leads to a high risk
for conditions such as epilepsy or schizo
phrenia.

The study, published March 22 in Neu
ron, showed that mice that were genetically
engineered to lack either molecule or Pirß,
which is the receptor that molecules K and
D bind to in order to carry out their func
tion, experienced noticeably better motor
performance recovery after the researchers
induced strokes, compared to mice with
normal levels of K, D and Pirß.

Concentrations of molecules K and D
increased drastically after the induced
strokes, according to the results of the
study.

ITie mice that were deficient in mole
cules K and D recovered advanced motor
functions, such as traversing a horizontal
ladder or spinning on a rod, significantly
better than control mice and had smaller
stroke-affected areas following the induced
stroke. Results of the experiment with mice
that lacked the cell receptor Pirß mirrored
the results for mice lacking molecules K
and D.
The current treatment for
strokes, tissue plasminogen activa
tor (tPA), is only effective if ad
ministered within hours of a
stroke and only acts to limit the
damage of the stroke. tPA is also
not capable of restoring or replac
ing the lost connections in the
brain caused by the stroke.

The National Institutes of
Health, the Mathers Charitable
Foundation, the Ellison Founda
tion and the National Defense Sci
ence & Engineering Graduate
Fellowship funded the study.
