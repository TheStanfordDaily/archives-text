# Dean Julie to leave in June
## Alumna and freshman dean to pursue MFA in writing 
### MARGARET RAWSON EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Quarterback Andrew Luck isn't the
only Cardinal powerhouse who won't
be returning to the Farm this fall. Julie
Lythcott-Haims 'B9, associate vice
provost for undergraduate education
and dean of freshmen and undergradu
ate advising, will step down in June to
pursue a master of fine arts in writing,
with an emphasis in poetry, from the
California College of the Arts in San
Francisco.

"This is something that for four years
has been my hobby and I've decided to
make it my focus," Lythcott-Haims said
of her choice to turn to writing full-time.
"I got to a point where it felt that not to
do it would be to suppress an important
part of myself."
Lythcott-Haims, known across cam
pus as "Dean Julie," has been a part of
the Stanford community since her un
dergraduate years, when she served as a
Resident Assistant in Branner and as a
senior class president, in addition to
participating in a host of other extracur
ricular activities. After Stanford, she
graduated from Harvard Law School
and practiced corporate law in Silicon
Valley.
She joined Stanford in 1998 as asso
ciate dean for student affairs at Stanford
Law School and became a member of
University President John Hennessy's
senior staff in 2000. In 2002, she took on
the role of Stanford's first dean of fresh
men.

Lythcott-Haims became dean of Un
dergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR) in 2009 and continued her work
with freshmen and transfer students. In
2010, she was awarded the Lloyd W.
Dinkelspiel Award for contributions to
undergraduate education.

Courtesty of Julie and Dan Lythcott-Haims
Associate Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9
will leave Stanford to attend the Califor
nia College of the Arts in San Francisco
to pursue her passion for writing.

"She's been an incredible and iconic
figure at Stanford, both in terms of her
work with students but also her work
with faculty and parents," Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education Harry
Elam said. "Everybody knows Dean
Julie and I think that's a tribute to her
passion, her commitment to Stanford
and her concern about people."
According to Elam, the University
will begin a national search for a re
placement.

Discovering her voice as a writer
Lythcott-Haims' development into a
writer was not something she predicted.
"I got feedback when I was an under
graduate here that my writing needed a
lot of work - and they were right," she
said. "I shrank in the face of that advice.
I was ashamed."

Now, after discovering poetry, she is
coming full circle to embrace an identi
ty as a writer.

"Until NSO [New Student Orienta

tion] 2007,1 was pretty sure I couldn't
stand poetry," Lythcott-Haims said. She
connected with the medium for the first
time when she read Lucille Clifton's col
lection of poems, "Good Woman," for
the annual NSO Three Books panel that
fall â€”an event that Lythcott-Haims
herself kick-started.

"It was the first time a set of poems
really spoke directly and deeply to me
as a human being," she said, recalling
how she was moved to hear a white,
male freshman share how Clifton's
poems spoke to him as well.
A few months later, Lythcott-Haims
began writing.
"I was discovering myself, my voice,
through poetry," she said.
Though she has kept her work large
ly private, Lythcott-Haims has shared
some of her creative endeavors with the
public through the Stanford Story
telling Project, the Red Couch Project
and Dance Marathon, where she per
formed her song, "Can't Tell You His
Name," about a loved one's lost battle
with AIDS.

Her first formal project, however,
will be a work of nonfiction about par
enting in America.
"I intend to write about something I
care deeply about, which is the way in
which parenting has changed in the last
couple of decades and the importance
of young people turning into independ
ent, self-actualized adults and the po
tential consequences to us as a society

not to mention to the individual
of not doing so," she said.
Though she will draw from her role
at Stanford and her experience as a par
ent, this is a national issue that is not
special to Stanford, she noted.
Lythcott-Haims and her husband,

Dan, have a son, Sawyer, who is 12,
and a daughter Avery, who is 10.
Lythcott-Haims' departure
from Stanford will not be the first
significant change of direction in
her life.

"My first transition was to flee
something that was making me
terribly unhappy and to find some
thing that would bring me joy," she
said of her decision to leave the
world of corporate law to come to
Stanford.

"Being a university administra
tor has indeed brought me joy. The
difference now is I'm not fleeing,"
Lythcott-Haims said. "I love what
I do and yet I've decided that in
order to feel fulfilled I need to
turn to writing."
She said she hopes her deci
sion will inspire others.
"I hope that my decision to go
off into the realm of creative and
artistic expression may give some
students who are reluctant to
make that choice a little bit of
confidence that it is a path that
people pursue and an incredibly
rewarding one."

Advising at Stanford
Those who spoke with The
Daily agreed that Lythcott-
Haims' legacy will be her work in
transforming undergraduate ad
vising at Stanford.
"She's made a real difference,"
said Elam, noting a survey on
which 71 percent of students said
they were satisfied with advising.
This past fall, Lythcott-Haims
presented a report on undergrad
uate advising to the Faculty Sen
ate and cited similar positive sta
tistics, such as an increase in facul
ty and staff serving as pre-major
advisors. Much of Lythcott-
Haims' work has focused on lend
ing credibility and relevance to
the advising process for under
graduates, she said.
"I'm really proud of what my
team has done in the name of ad
vising," she said, particularly not
ing the developing Stanford 101
program, a University-wide col
laboration to create a curriculum
for freshmen with themes of nav
igation and reflection on their
time at Stanford.

One of our ongoing challenges
is to help our undergraduates
value getting advice from people
older than the upperclassman
down the hall, but I'm sensing
we're making real inroads there,"
she added.

Students and colleagues reflect
"She really made me confi
dent to pursue what I'm passion
ate about and what really inter
ests me, even though it wasn't
what my peers were doing," said
Brittany Rymer 'l3, who had
Lythcott-Haims as her pre-major
advisor. "Having her as an advisor
was really important to build that
confidence."

"Everyone at Stanford who's
been lucky enough to come into
contact with Julie has met a
deeply humane and compassion
ate person," said English Profes
sor Jennifer Summit. "Her mes
sage has always been to take risks
to bring our best selves to our
work and her decision shows that

that's a process that never stops."
"I know it's not an easy thing
to do to follow a dream and that's
what she's doing," Elam said of
Lythcott-Haims' choice to pursue
writing. "I think it's an exciting
time for her."
Michael Tubbs 'l2 described
Lythcott-Haims as "a fixture of
the freshman experience" and
referenced what many students
will remember most vividly: her
leading students in shouting their
class years at big campus events.
"I expect that Stanford stu
dents will be shouting their class
numerals into the next century
and beyond, I'll just miss getting
to be a part of it," Lythcott-Haims
said of the tradition, adding that
she will be back in two years to
shout hers at her 25th reunion.

A longtime fan, Lythcott-
Haims noted that she has re
newed her season tickets for
Stanford football. For the first
time in awhile, however, she
won't be cheering with students
in the Red Zone.
"Stanford is not an institution
in my life. Stanford is like a
human being to me that I cherish
like a mentor or like a good
friend," Lythcott-Haims reflect
ed. "There is nothing I won't
miss."
