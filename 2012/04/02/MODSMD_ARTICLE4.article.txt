# Dean Julie to leave in June
## Alumna and freshman dean to pursue MFA in writing 
### MARGARET RAWSON EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Quarterback Andrew Luck isn't the
only Cardinal powerhouse who won't
be returning to the Farm this fall. Julie
Lythcott-Haims 'B9, associate vice
provost for undergraduate education
and dean of freshmen and undergradu
ate advising, will step down in June to
pursue a master of fine arts in writing,
with an emphasis in poetry, from the
California College of the Arts in San
Francisco.

"This is something that for four years
has been my hobby and I've decided to
make it my focus," Lythcott-Haims said
of her choice to turn to writing full-time.
"I got to a point where it felt that not to
do it would be to suppress an important
part of myself."
Lythcott-Haims, known across cam
pus as "Dean Julie," has been a part of
the Stanford community since her un
dergraduate years, when she served as a
Resident Assistant in Branner and as a
senior class president, in addition to
participating in a host of other extracur
ricular activities. After Stanford, she
graduated from Harvard Law School
and practiced corporate law in Silicon
Valley.
She joined Stanford in 1998 as asso
ciate dean for student affairs at Stanford
Law School and became a member of
University President John Hennessy's
senior staff in 2000. In 2002, she took on
the role of Stanford's first dean of fresh
men.

Lythcott-Haims became dean of Un
dergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR) in 2009 and continued her work
with freshmen and transfer students. In
2010, she was awarded the Lloyd W.
Dinkelspiel Award for contributions to
undergraduate education.

Associate Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9
will leave Stanford to attend the Califor
nia College of the Arts in San Francisco
to pursue her passion for writing.

"She's been an incredible and iconic
figure at Stanford, both in terms of her
work with students but also her work
with faculty and parents," Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education Harry
Elam said. "Everybody knows Dean
Julie and I think that's a tribute to her
passion, her commitment to Stanford
and her concern about people."
According to Elam, the University
will begin a national search for a re
placement.

Discovering her voice as a writer
Lythcott-Haims' development into a
writer was not something she predicted.
"I got feedback when I was an under
graduate here that my writing needed a
lot of work - and they were right," she
said. "I shrank in the face of that advice.
I was ashamed."

Now, after discovering poetry, she is
coming full circle to embrace an identi
ty as a writer.

"Until NSO [New Student Orienta

tion] 2007,1 was pretty sure I couldn't
stand poetry," Lythcott-Haims said. She
connected with the medium for the first
time when she read Lucille Clifton's col
lection of poems, "Good Woman," for
the annual NSO Three Books panel that
fall â€”an event that Lythcott-Haims
herself kick-started.

"It was the first time a set of poems
really spoke directly and deeply to me
as a human being," she said, recalling
how she was moved to hear a white,
male freshman share how Clifton's
poems spoke to him as well.
A few months later, Lythcott-Haims
began writing.
"I was discovering myself, my voice,
through poetry," she said.
Though she has kept her work large
ly private, Lythcott-Haims has shared
some of her creative endeavors with the
public through the Stanford Story
telling Project, the Red Couch Project
and Dance Marathon, where she per
formed her song, "Can't Tell You His
Name," about a loved one's lost battle
with AIDS.

Her first formal project, however,
will be a work of nonfiction about par
enting in America.
"I intend to write about something I
care deeply about, which is the way in
which parenting has changed in the last
couple of decades and the importance
of young people turning into independ
ent, self-actualized adults and the po
tential consequences to us as a society

not to mention to the individual
of not doing so," she said.
Though she will draw from her role
at Stanford and her experience as a par
ent, this is a national issue that is not
special to Stanford, she noted.
