## Class of 2016 admit rate at historic low University accepts 6.6 percent of applicants, on track with peers 
### ELLORA ISRANI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
About 6.6 percent of applicants were
admitted to Stanford Friday when the
Office of Undergraduate Admissions
released notification letters via email.
The number is the lowest in University
history, down from last year's 7.1 per
cent admit rate.

The University received a total of
36,631 applications this year, a 6.6-per
cent jump over last year's applicant
pool. 755 students received offers of ad
mission in December due to the restric
tive early action process. These early ac
tion applicants faced a 12.8 admit rate.
Stanford extended offers to 1,672
more students on Friday. Another 789
were placed on the wait list.
"Stanford has been exceedingly for
tunate to attract a simply amazing
group of applicants from all over the
world," said Dean of Admission and Fi
nancial Aid Richard Shaw in a press re

lease. "In our review, we were humbled
by the exceptional accomplishments of
those candidates who have been admit
ted, as well as the competitive strength
of all of the applicants."
Nitish Kulkarni, who attends
Oakridge International School in Hy
derabad, India, was one such lucky
admit to the Class of 2016.
"One of the main reasons that made
me choose it is that Stanford wants stu
dents coming in to be students, and not
semi-professionals like other schools
want you to be," Kulkarni wrote in an
email to The Daily. "I see Stanford as a
place where I can just be myself."
On Thursday, six Ivy League univer
sities also posted all-time low admission
rates: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Dart
mouth, the University of Pennsylvania
and Cornell. Harvard's was the lowest
at 5.9 percent, followed by the other
Ivies at 6.8, 7.9, 9.4,12.3, and 16.2 per
cent, respectively.
Brown and Columbia saw slight in
creases in their admission rates, posting
final percentages of 9.6 and 7.4.

Princeton and Harvard reintroduced
their restrictive early action programs
this year after a four-year hiatus. This

gave students the option to receive their
decisions early without having to make a
binding commitment to enroll. Although
the schools each saw an overall drop in
applicants, both universities ultimately
admitted fewer students than in previous
years, anticipating a higher percentage of
admitted students to matriculate.

These admission changes at peer
universities also coincided with a de
crease of 18 percent in the number of
students who applied to Yale early ac
tion. Yale, however, experienced an
overall increase in its applicant pool
when regular decision applications
were taken into account.

Last year's 7.1 percent admit rate at
Stanford reflected a .1-point drop from
2010. In an effort to increase total stu
dent capacity and to accommodate 50
additional students, the University ex
panded classroom and residential facil
ities and ultimately admitted 96 more
individuals.

Admitted students have until May 1
to inform the University whether they
will be attending.
