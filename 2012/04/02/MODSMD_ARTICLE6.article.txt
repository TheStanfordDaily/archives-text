## GDC abandons push to place ASSU Constitution on ballot 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN MARSHALL WATKINS 
Amidst mounting criticism and concerns,
the ASSU Governing Documents Commis
sion (GDC) decided to cease attempts to
ratify a proposed new ASSU Constitution
this election season. The decision was made
shortly after a March 19 Joint Legislative
Meeting, in which the Undergraduate Sen
ate and the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) did not provide the two-thirds ma
jority in each legislative body required to
place the Constitution on the spring ballot.
While Senate and GSC representatives
expressed mostly favorable impressions of
the proposed Constitution, the bill failed to
receive enough votes at the Joint Legislative

Meeting, mostly reflecting representative
absences during finals week rather than sus
tained objections to the document's provi
sions. The Senate was three votes short of
the requisite for passage, while the GSC was
one vote short.

Former ASSU executive officials, howev
er, circulated emails in the days leading up to
the Joint Legislative meeting, identifying
areas that they foresaw as being problemat
ic in the proposed Constitution.
"In light of the ongoing dispute involving
ASSU alumni... the ASSU GDC has de
termined that it is unable to continue pursu
ing the ratification of the new ASSU Consti
tution," wrote ASSU President Michael
Cruz 'l2 and Parliamentarian
Alex Kindel 'l4, GDC co-chairs,
in an email to student government
representatives. "We do not be
lieve that to do so would be in the
best interests of the current Asso
ciation."
"Irreconcilably out of date"
Cruz and Kindel called the ex
isting Constitution, which has not
been updated since the 19705, "ir
reconcilably out of date." They
added that reform is necessary to
ensure the "long-term efficacy
and sustainability of the ASSU as
the representative body of Stan
ford students" and identified 15
flaws with the existing Governing

Documents, in particular, that are
in need of change.
They listed the current Consti
tution's lack of distinct boundary
between ASSU entities, under
representation of co-terminal and
transfer students and violation of
federal law as primary concerns.
At 32 pages, less than half the
current document's length, the
proposed Constitution includes
significant changes, such as the
consolidation of Executive, GSC
and Senate bylaws and authority.
It also adjusts the standard of
proof that students are subject to
in the case of disciplinary pro
ceedings, to align the standard
with federal law.

According to Kindel, other
suggestions, such as a reduction in
the number of Senators from 15 to
nine, were discarded due to feed
back before voting. There was also
discussion about reserving Senate

seats for upperclassmen; remov
ing the requirement that ASSU
legislation must exclusively ad
dress issues that "uniquely and di
rectly" affect Stanford students;
and establishing looser criteria for
closing ASSU meetings to the
public.

of the five former ASSU officials
and the 34 signatories concerned
the deletion of the Rights of the
Accused from the new Constitu
tion.

"The Rights of the Accused
section has been completely re
moved and replaced with a couple
watered down bullet points,"
wrote Kamil Dada 'll M.A. 'l2, a
GSC member and former Daily
editor in chief, in an email to the
Senate and the GSC.

Alumni criticism
The Constitution and its review
process received extensive criti
cism from ASSU alumni.
Five former ASSU executive
officials wrote an email to ASSU
and GSC member lists on March
12 expressing concerns with the
proposed Constitution. In particu
lar, they identified a requirement
that special fees groups petition
twice for ballot placement each
year and the removal of a Rights
of the Accused section of the cur
rent Constitution as the "two most
salient" issues.

Cruz and Kindel noted, howev
er, that the current Rights of the
Accused are not in accordance
with federal law and must be re
vised.

"If we keep [the Rights of the
Accused] in for Fundamental
Standard violations, we violate the
Dear Colleague Letter of the Of
fice for Civil Rights (OCR)," Cruz
said at a March 13 Senate meeting.
"If Stanford does not abide by the
Office for Civil Rights, it is put in
jeopardy of violating Title IX,
which means that it is no longer el
igible for federal funding."

Although they agreed that the
current Constitution could use im
provement, these alumni called
for a delay of at least one quarter
in the document's ballot submis
sion to allow more thorough pub
lic review.
"We are confident that addi
tional problems of such magni
tude exist in the current draft and
have yet to be identified," the for
mer executives wrote.

Cruz and Kindel also said a
Rights of the Accused clause is re
dundant in the ASSU Constitu
tion because such protections are
included in the University's judi
cial charter. ASSU Vice President
Stewart MacGregor-Dennis 'l3,
however, agreed with alumni and
former officials that retaining the
provision in the central Constitu
tion might provide extra protec
tion.

The concerns of the five former
executives were echoed and fur
ther expanded in a March 19 email
co-signed by 34 ASSU alumni. The
letter outlined 32 additional con
cerns with the Constitution and
similarly disapproved of the re
view period's brevity.
"Everyone had good inten
tions and saw all of the good things
that it was doing," former ASSU
President David Gobaud 'lO, who
endorsed both letters, said. "But
[they] didn't understand the mag
nitude and the consequences of
what they were doing, both in
tended and unintended."

"[While] the Rights to the Ac
cused might be represented in the
judicial charter as well, I think it
might still make sense to keep it in
the Constitution because that is
the ultimate constraint," he said.
Hurried process
The hurried discussion and
compromise surrounding the judi
cial protections clause reflected a
more general sense of urgency as
the ASSU rushed to complete the
document in time for spring elec-

One of the principle objections

tions and the end of its mem
bers' terms. To be placed on the
spring ballot, the document re
quired two-thirds approval from
both legislative bodies by March
21,21 days before the election.
The short time period that the
Constitution, released Feb. 26, was
available for public review was a
principle criticism of the GDC's
effort. The document, which Cruz
consistently emphasized to be a
"working draft," continued to un
dergo editing until the morning of
a March 14 Joint Legislative
Meeting.
"This did not give anyone suffi
cient time to read through the
document and note the ramifica
tions of the changes," Dada wrote
in an email to The Daily.

Cruz countered that all mem
bers of the community, including
some of the alumni who signed the
criticizing letter, had been invited
to give feedback throughout the
GDC's yearlong investigation.

"I think from the charter of the
GDC in the spring of 2011 until
the voting to place it on the ballot
not to confirm the Constitu
tion, but to place it on the ballot..
. that that year of process was a
long enough period of public
input," Cruz said.

The battle over the ASSU Gov
erning Documents continues to be
a clash between those eager for ur
gent reform and those wary of un
intended consequences. Dada em
phasized that his concern stems
from the importance of the Consti
tution — which must also be ap
proved by the Stanford Board of
Trustees following the student
body vote —in maintaining stu
dent and ASSU independence.
"This is the most important
document to the ASSU and ar
guably the most important docu
ment for the student body," Gob
aud concurred, "It deserves due
process."

Cruz agreed, standing by his
personal sentiment that reform of
the governing documents is neces
sary for student welfare.

"The structure of the ASSU
does matter to every single Stan
ford student, even if they don't see
exactly how it [does]," he said.
"This is important work that I
hope is carried into the future. But
as an outgoing ASSU President, I
believe that it is no longer my
place to advocate on these points."

This is the most important document
to the ASSU and arguably the
most important document for the
student body

DAVID GO BAUD,
former ASSU President
Amidst mounting criticism and concerns,
the ASSU Governing Documents Commis
sion (GDC) decided to cease attempts to
ratify a proposed new ASSU Constitution
this election season. The decision was made
shortly after a March 19 Joint Legislative
Meeting, in which the Undergraduate Sen
ate and the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) did not provide the two-thirds ma
jority in each legislative body required to
place the Constitution on the spring ballot.
While Senate and GSC representatives
expressed mostly favorable impressions of
the proposed Constitution, the bill failed to
receive enough votes at the Joint Legislative

Meeting, mostly reflecting representative
absences during finals week rather than sus
tained objections to the document's provi
sions. The Senate was three votes short of
the requisite for passage, while the GSC was
one vote short.

Former ASSU executive officials, howev
er, circulated emails in the days leading up to
the Joint Legislative meeting, identifying
areas that they foresaw as being problemat
ic in the proposed Constitution.
"In light of the ongoing dispute involving
ASSU alumni... the ASSU GDC has de
termined that it is unable to continue pursu
ing the ratification of the new ASSU Consti
tution," wrote ASSU President Michael
Cruz 'l2 and Parliamentarian
Alex Kindel 'l4, GDC co-chairs,
in an email to student government
representatives. "We do not be
lieve that to do so would be in the
best interests of the current Asso
ciation."
"Irreconcilably out of date"
Cruz and Kindel called the ex
isting Constitution, which has not
been updated since the 19705, "ir
reconcilably out of date." They
added that reform is necessary to
ensure the "long-term efficacy
and sustainability of the ASSU as
the representative body of Stan
ford students" and identified 15
flaws with the existing Governing

Documents, in particular, that are
in need of change.
They listed the current Consti
tution's lack of distinct boundary
between ASSU entities, under
representation of co-terminal and
transfer students and violation of
federal law as primary concerns.
At 32 pages, less than half the
current document's length, the
proposed Constitution includes
significant changes, such as the
consolidation of Executive, GSC
and Senate bylaws and authority.
It also adjusts the standard of
proof that students are subject to
in the case of disciplinary pro
ceedings, to align the standard
with federal law.

According to Kindel, other
suggestions, such as a reduction in
the number of Senators from 15 to
nine, were discarded due to feed
back before voting. There was also
discussion about reserving Senate

seats for upperclassmen; remov
ing the requirement that ASSU
legislation must exclusively ad
dress issues that "uniquely and di
rectly" affect Stanford students;
and establishing looser criteria for
closing ASSU meetings to the
public.

of the five former ASSU officials
and the 34 signatories concerned
the deletion of the Rights of the
Accused from the new Constitu
tion.

"The Rights of the Accused
section has been completely re
moved and replaced with a couple
watered down bullet points,"
wrote Kamil Dada 'll M.A. 'l2, a
GSC member and former Daily
editor in chief, in an email to the
Senate and the GSC.

Alumni criticism
The Constitution and its review
process received extensive criti
cism from ASSU alumni.
Five former ASSU executive
officials wrote an email to ASSU
and GSC member lists on March
12 expressing concerns with the
proposed Constitution. In particu
lar, they identified a requirement
that special fees groups petition
twice for ballot placement each
year and the removal of a Rights
of the Accused section of the cur
rent Constitution as the "two most
salient" issues.

Cruz and Kindel noted, howev
er, that the current Rights of the
Accused are not in accordance
with federal law and must be re
vised.

"If we keep [the Rights of the
Accused] in for Fundamental
Standard violations, we violate the
Dear Colleague Letter of the Of
fice for Civil Rights (OCR)," Cruz
said at a March 13 Senate meeting.
"If Stanford does not abide by the
Office for Civil Rights, it is put in
jeopardy of violating Title IX,
which means that it is no longer el
igible for federal funding."

Although they agreed that the
current Constitution could use im
provement, these alumni called
for a delay of at least one quarter
in the document's ballot submis
sion to allow more thorough pub
lic review.
"We are confident that addi
tional problems of such magni
tude exist in the current draft and
have yet to be identified," the for
mer executives wrote.

Cruz and Kindel also said a
Rights of the Accused clause is re
dundant in the ASSU Constitu
tion because such protections are
included in the University's judi
cial charter. ASSU Vice President
Stewart MacGregor-Dennis 'l3,
however, agreed with alumni and
former officials that retaining the
provision in the central Constitu
tion might provide extra protec
tion.

The concerns of the five former
executives were echoed and fur
ther expanded in a March 19 email
co-signed by 34 ASSU alumni. The
letter outlined 32 additional con
cerns with the Constitution and
similarly disapproved of the re
view period's brevity.
"Everyone had good inten
tions and saw all of the good things
that it was doing," former ASSU
President David Gobaud 'lO, who
endorsed both letters, said. "But
[they] didn't understand the mag
nitude and the consequences of
what they were doing, both in

seats for upperclassmen; remov
ing the requirement that ASSU
legislation must exclusively ad
dress issues that "uniquely and di
rectly" affect Stanford students;
and establishing looser criteria for
closing ASSU meetings to the
public.

of the five former ASSU officials
and the 34 signatories concerned
the deletion of the Rights of the
Accused from the new Constitu
tion.

"The Rights of the Accused
section has been completely re
moved and replaced with a couple
watered down bullet points,"
wrote Kamil Dada 'll M.A. 'l2, a
GSC member and former Daily
editor in chief, in an email to the
Senate and the GSC.

Alumni criticism
The Constitution and its review
process received extensive criti
cism from ASSU alumni.
Five former ASSU executive
officials wrote an email to ASSU
and GSC member lists on March
12 expressing concerns with the
proposed Constitution. In particu
lar, they identified a requirement
that special fees groups petition
twice for ballot placement each
year and the removal of a Rights
of the Accused section of the cur
rent Constitution as the "two most
salient" issues.

Cruz and Kindel noted, howev
er, that the current Rights of the
Accused are not in accordance
with federal law and must be re
vised.

"If we keep [the Rights of the
Accused] in for Fundamental
Standard violations, we violate the
Dear Colleague Letter of the Of
fice for Civil Rights (OCR)," Cruz
said at a March 13 Senate meeting.
"If Stanford does not abide by the
Office for Civil Rights, it is put in
jeopardy of violating Title IX,
which means that it is no longer el
igible for federal funding."

Although they agreed that the
current Constitution could use im
provement, these alumni called
for a delay of at least one quarter
in the document's ballot submis
sion to allow more thorough pub
lic review.
"We are confident that addi
tional problems of such magni
tude exist in the current draft and
have yet to be identified," the for
mer executives wrote.

Cruz and Kindel also said a
Rights of the Accused clause is re
dundant in the ASSU Constitu
tion because such protections are
included in the University's judi
cial charter. ASSU Vice President
Stewart MacGregor-Dennis 'l3,
however, agreed with alumni and
former officials that retaining the
provision in the central Constitu
tion might provide extra protec
tion.

The concerns of the five former
executives were echoed and fur
ther expanded in a March 19 email
co-signed by 34 ASSU alumni. The
letter outlined 32 additional con
cerns with the Constitution and
similarly disapproved of the re
view period's brevity.
"Everyone had good inten
tions and saw all of the good things
that it was doing," former ASSU
President David Gobaud 'lO, who
endorsed both letters, said. "But
[they] didn't understand the mag
nitude and the consequences of
what they were doing, both in
tended and unintended."

"[While] the Rights to the Ac
cused might be represented in the
judicial charter as well, I think it
might still make sense to keep it in
the Constitution because that is
the ultimate constraint," he said.
Hurried process
The hurried discussion and
compromise surrounding the judi
cial protections clause reflected a
more general sense of urgency as
the ASSU rushed to complete the
document in time for spring elec-

One of the principle objections

tions and the end of its mem
bers' terms. To be placed on the
spring ballot, the document re
quired two-thirds approval from
both legislative bodies by March
21,21 days before the election.
The short time period that the
Constitution, released Feb. 26, was
available for public review was a
principle criticism of the GDC's
effort. The document, which Cruz
consistently emphasized to be a
"working draft," continued to un
dergo editing until the morning of
a March 14 Joint Legislative
Meeting.
"This did not give anyone suffi
cient time to read through the
document and note the ramifica
tions of the changes," Dada wrote
in an email to The Daily.

Cruz countered that all mem
bers of the community, including
some of the alumni who signed the
criticizing letter, had been invited
to give feedback throughout the
GDC's yearlong investigation.

"I think from the charter of the
GDC in the spring of 2011 until
the voting to place it on the ballot
not to confirm the Constitu
tion, but to place it on the ballot..
. that that year of process was a
long enough period of public
input," Cruz said.

The battle over the ASSU Gov
erning Documents continues to be
a clash between those eager for ur
gent reform and those wary of un
intended consequences. Dada em
phasized that his concern stems
from the importance of the Consti
tution — which must also be ap
proved by the Stanford Board of
Trustees following the student
body vote —in maintaining stu
dent and ASSU independence.
"This is the most important
document to the ASSU and ar
guably the most important docu
ment for the student body," Gob
aud concurred, "It deserves due
process."

Cruz agreed, standing by his
personal sentiment that reform of
the governing documents is neces
sary for student welfare.

"The structure of the ASSU
does matter to every single Stan
ford student, even if they don't see
exactly how it [does]," he said.
"This is important work that I
hope is carried into the future. But
as an outgoing ASSU President, I
believe that it is no longer my
place to advocate on these points."
