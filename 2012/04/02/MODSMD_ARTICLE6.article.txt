## GDC abandons push to place ASSU Constitution on ballot

Amidst mounting criticism and concerns,
the ASSU Governing Documents Commis
sion (GDC) decided to cease attempts to
ratify a proposed new ASSU Constitution
this election season. The decision was made
shortly after a March 19 Joint Legislative
Meeting, in which the Undergraduate Sen
ate and the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) did not provide the two-thirds ma
jority in each legislative body required to
place the Constitution on the spring ballot.
While Senate and GSC representatives
expressed mostly favorable impressions of
the proposed Constitution, the bill failed to
receive enough votes at the Joint Legislative

Meeting, mostly reflecting representative
absences during finals week rather than sus

the requisite for passage, while the GSC was
one vote short.

Former ASSU executive officials, howev

the Joint Legislative meeting, identifying
areas that they foresaw as being problemat
ic in the proposed Constitution.
"In light of the ongoing dispute involving
ASSU alumni... the ASSU GDC has de
termined that it is unable to continue pursu
ing the ratification of the new ASSU Consti
tution," wrote ASSU President Michael
