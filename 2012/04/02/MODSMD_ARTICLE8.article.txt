## New Stanford center opens doors at Peking University 
### SANDY HUANG 
After almost five years of plan
ning, the University opened the
Stanford Center at Peking Uni
versity (SCPKU) last month.
SCPKU, a $7 million project de
signed to strengthen ties with
Peking University (PKU), builds
off of a partnership between the
two universities dating back to the
19705, which has included joint ac
ademic ventures and a Bing Over
seas Studies Program (BOSP) es
tablished in 2004.

University President John
Hennessy, currently on a sabbati
cal that began Feb. 15, attended
the opening ceremony at the new
center.

At minimum, several hundred
faculty and students will make use
of the SCPKU, according to An
drew Walder, senior fellow at the
Freeman Spogli Institute, in an
email to The Daily. Walder said
that over 50 members of the Stan
ford community have already par
ticipated in conferences or other
events at the new center in the
past two weeks alone.

This new education and re
search hub will welcome 10 of
Stanford's programs, including
the Asian Liver Center, the Cen
ter for Sustainable Development
& Global Competitiveness and
the Rural Education Action Proj

ect (REAP). The seven other de
partments that will conduct oper
ations at the center are the Center
on Philanthropy and Civil Society
(PACS), the Stanford China Pro
gram, the Graduate School of
Business, Stanford Hospital and
Clinics, the School of Engineering
and the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific
Research Center.
'As far as collaboration is con
cerned, Stanford does not operate
in a 'top down' model we ex
pect collaborations to develop
'from the bottom up,' through in
dividual programs and projects
that are directed by researchers
and heads of academic pro
grams," Walder said.
For example, REAP had previ
ously been collaborating with the
China Institute for Educational
Finance Research at PKU.

"Stanford's past collaboration
with PKU make it a natural host
for the expanded engagement
that Stanford envisions," wrote
Matthew Boswell, REAP project
manager for technology and
human capital, in an email to The
Daily. "The new center is a down
payment on this vision, and pro
vides some of the infrastructure
that a vibrant academic partner
ship requires."

Kim Meredith, the executive
director of PACS, stated that
SCPKU gives her research center

the opportunity "to add an addi
tional Ph.D. or two to our group
who would just focus on work in
China."

"We would hope to convene
what I would call a 'China Coun
cil' or 'China Advisory Council,"'
she added, "and really utilize the
individuals who participated with
us on the ground floor to help us
think about how we continue our
work in China over the future
years."

For Jenna Nicholas 'l2, who
accompanied Meredith on a
PACS trip to China, the opening
of the SCPKU marked a "symbol
ic turning point in East/West rela
tions" where American and Chi
nese students can "work side-by
side forging friendships, vision
and joint ventures in technology,
science and social initiatives."

BOSP's physical plant in
China may also benefit from the
new center.

Walder said that the BOSP of
fices may eventually move away
from Peking University's "aging
dormitory complex for overseas

students" and into the larger facil
ities at SCPKU.
"The distance between the for
eign student residences and
SCPKU is roughly the same as the
distance between Tresidder and
Maples Pavilion," Walder said.
"That's a serious hike, but it has
never been seen as a serious barri
er to a quality education at Stan
ford."

The architectural firm Mo At
elier Szeto designed the new cen
ter, which was named after the fa
ther of former Stanford trustee
Chien Lee '7s.The SCPKU build
ing incorporates three levels
courtyard, mezzanine and garden.
By using traditional gujian wood,
the building was constructed
without any nails or glue.
Brian Chhor 'l3, who is spend
ing spring quarter at the Beijing
BOSP program, said that explor
ing SCPKU gave him a "sense of
normalcy" akin to being in the
Stanford bubble, commenting that
SCPKU is much sleeker than the
older PKU academic buildings.

Chhor said that the new center

features the "best amalgamation
of Stanford and Chinese culture"
and that he was "particularly im
pressed by the paintings of Stan
ford at the four corners of the
eaves and overhangs, sort of like a
Chinese quad."
"It's things like this that re
mind me how lucky and proud I
am to be a part of such an amazing
institution," Chhor said. "So much
swag."
