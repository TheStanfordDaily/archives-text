## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Billy Gallagher 
Larry Kramer, dean of Stan
ford Law School since 2004, an
nounced Wednesday that he will
leave Stanford in August to serve
as president of the William and
Flora Hewlett Foundation.
"It has been an incredible
honor to work at Stanford Law

School these past eight years,"
Kramer said to The Stanford Re
port. "I had the privilege to work
with amazingly talented faculty,
staff and students to support
their innovative scholarship and
work and be part of what I believe
is easily the world's best universi
ty. It has been an exciting time of
great change and equally great
challenges, but the law school has
a strong, positive trajectory, and I
can't wait to see the direction it
takes under future leadership."

Kramer oversaw the Law
School's recent curriculum re
form, which took five years and
emphasized more team-oriented
problem-solving techniques. The
physical campus of the Law
School was also expanded and
improved under Kramer.
"Larry Kramer transformed
the Stanford Law School, both
physically and programmatical
ly," said Acting President and
Provost John Etchemendy to The
Stanford Report. "He pioneered
a new vision of legal education
and then oversaw the creation of
a physical plant capable of sup
porting the new program. His vi
sion has benefited not only law
students but the university at
large, by integrating the law
school with the rest of the univer
sity. Larry is a national leader in
legal academia and a university
leader at Stanford. His impact has
been tremendous and he will be
missed."
