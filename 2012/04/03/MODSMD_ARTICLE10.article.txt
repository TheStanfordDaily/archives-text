## Nuclear investigations Political Science Prof. Scott Sagan shares his passion for teaching nuclear deterrence and security 
### ELISE JOHNSON 
Imagine you are a soldier out in the middle of the
desert. An enemy tank formation faces you, and
there are no civilians within hundreds of miles.
Could you justify the use of nuclear weapons
against the enemy? For Political Science Profes
sor Scott Sagan, the answer is simple no.
From his realist perspective, Sagan believes that the use
of nuclear weapons in this case would set a dangerous
precedent. Such dilemmas drive him to find solutions for
problems beyond the palm trees and sandstone walls of
Stanford.
Sagan's interest in nuclear security was inspired by his
college thesis on failed deterrence efforts that led to the Pa
cific War during World War 11. After graduating from Ober
lin College in 1977 with a major in government, he pursued

a Ph.D. in political science at Harvard University. This led
to a job at the Pentagon where Sagan served as special as
sistant to the director of the Joint Staff.
"I went from the ivory tower of Harvard to a window
less room in the basement of the Pentagon, from studying
abstract theory to focusing on military operations and the
real world of preparing for nuclear war," he said.
This "real world" experience had a profound effect on
him.
"It convinced me that weapons are not controlled by ab
stract states or even statesmen," Sagan said. "I began to
question who actually controlled the weapons. Did the mil
itary have the autonomy to use them when they wanted?
Who made the actual decisions?"
Sagan started to provide intelligence about these deci
sions, producing literature about the control of nuclear
weapons.
"As a renowned nuclear weapons policy expert, his
work has influenced scholars and policymakers alike," said
Reid Pauly, a graduate of Cornell University and research
assistant to Sagan.
Sagan added that policymakers rely on scholars like
him.
"They [policymakers] are so busy putting out fires, they
rarely have time to question assumptions," he said. "So
scholars play an important role, bringing new ideas and
new facts to bear on government policies."
But Sagan does not just influence politicians. As the
Caroline S.G. Munro professor of political science at Stan
ford, he inspires students to take an interest in the world's
nuclear security issues. Besides teaching classes, he hires a
number of undergraduate research assistants each quarter.
"Stanford is a marvelous place because of the quality of
the students," he said. "I never have to reduce the level of
discussion and can try out new ideas in a creative way."
In partnership with Alan Weiner from the Stanford Law
School, Sagan developed a new spring quarter course this
year titled The Ethics and Law of War. The course, target
ed toward juniors and seniors, will analyze the standards
that countries use when determining whether or not to use

force. Sagan is also planning a freshman lecture course, The
Rules of War, for next year.
Role-playing and simulations of real-world situations
are important to Sagan's teaching style.
"I'm a big believer in active learning," he said. "It not
only helps capture what decision making is like, but also
forces students out of their box[es]."
Sagan also teaches a course in the Sophomore College
program titled The Face of Battle. The course involves him
taking approximately 10 students on a fieldtrip back in
time to the battlefields of Gettysburg, Penn. and Little
Bighorn, Mont.
Matthew Enriquez 'l3 spoke enthusiastically about his
2010 Sophomore College experience with Sagan.
"I got to interact in a very active way with such an amaz
ing professor, but also with history itself," Enriquez said.
"Professor Sagan's passion brought the battlefields to life,"
Aside from teaching classes, Sagan is also a senior fellow
at the Freeman Spogli Institute (FSI) and emeritus co-di
rector of the Center for International Security and Co-op
eration (CISAC) at Stanford.
Despite being busy with work on the Farm, Sagan con
tinues to engage with current nuclear weapons policy de
bates. He said he is concerned about countries with radical
military elements seeking out a nuclear bomb most no
tably Pakistan and Iran.
"Once Iran gets the bomb, the Iranian Revolutionary
Guard Corps may become more aggressive, not less ag
gressive," Sagan said. "And that's a danger we all have to
worry about."
According to him, issues like these are too important for
young people at major universities to ignore. Yet even for
those who want to make a difference, Sagan warns against
misguided passion.
"You can care passionately about something, but pas
sion itself doesn't produce influence," Sagan said. "Passion
armed with new knowledge and skillful ways to apply it can
have influence."

bates. He said he is concerned about countries with radical
military elements seeking out a nuclear bomb most no
tably Pakistan and Iran.
"Once Iran gets the bomb, the Iranian Revolutionary
Guard Corps may become more aggressive, not less ag
gressive," Sagan said. "And that's a danger we all have to
worry about."
According to him, issues like these are too important for
young people at major universities to ignore. Yet even for
those who want to make a difference, Sagan warns against
misguided passion.
"You can care passionately about something, but pas
sion itself doesn't produce influence," Sagan said. "Passion
armed with new knowledge and skillful ways to apply it can
have influence."

Scott Sagan, CISAC emeritus co-director, FSI senior fellow
and political science professor, reflected with The Daily on
how his career has spanned abstract theory and military
advising, due to his time in academia and at the Pentagon.
Imagine you are a soldier out in the middle of the
desert. An enemy tank formation faces you, and
there are no civilians within hundreds of miles.
Could you justify the use of nuclear weapons
against the enemy? For Political Science Profes
sor Scott Sagan, the answer is simple no.
From his realist perspective, Sagan believes that the use
of nuclear weapons in this case would set a dangerous
precedent. Such dilemmas drive him to find solutions for
problems beyond the palm trees and sandstone walls of
Stanford.
Sagan's interest in nuclear security was inspired by his
college thesis on failed deterrence efforts that led to the Pa
cific War during World War 11. After graduating from Ober
lin College in 1977 with a major in government, he pursued

a Ph.D. in political science at Harvard University. This led
to a job at the Pentagon where Sagan served as special as
sistant to the director of the Joint Staff.
"I went from the ivory tower of Harvard to a window
less room in the basement of the Pentagon, from studying
abstract theory to focusing on military operations and the
real world of preparing for nuclear war," he said.
This "real world" experience had a profound effect on
him.
"It convinced me that weapons are not controlled by ab
stract states or even statesmen," Sagan said. "I began to
question who actually controlled the weapons. Did the mil
itary have the autonomy to use them when they wanted?
Who made the actual decisions?"
Sagan started to provide intelligence about these deci
sions, producing literature about the control of nuclear
weapons.
"As a renowned nuclear weapons policy expert, his
work has influenced scholars and policymakers alike," said
Reid Pauly, a graduate of Cornell University and research
assistant to Sagan.
Sagan added that policymakers rely on scholars like
him.
"They [policymakers] are so busy putting out fires, they
rarely have time to question assumptions," he said. "So
scholars play an important role, bringing new ideas and
new facts to bear on government policies."
But Sagan does not just influence politicians. As the
Caroline S.G. Munro professor of political science at Stan
ford, he inspires students to take an interest in the world's
nuclear security issues. Besides teaching classes, he hires a
number of undergraduate research assistants each quarter.
"Stanford is a marvelous place because of the quality of
the students," he said. "I never have to reduce the level of
discussion and can try out new ideas in a creative way."
In partnership with Alan Weiner from the Stanford Law
School, Sagan developed a new spring quarter course this
year titled The Ethics and Law of War. The course, target
ed toward juniors and seniors, will analyze the standards
that countries use when determining whether or not to use

force. Sagan is also planning a freshman lecture course, The
Rules of War, for next year.
Role-playing and simulations of real-world situations
are important to Sagan's teaching style.
"I'm a big believer in active learning," he said. "It not
only helps capture what decision making is like, but also
forces students out of their box[es]."
Sagan also teaches a course in the Sophomore College
program titled The Face of Battle. The course involves him
taking approximately 10 students on a fieldtrip back in
time to the battlefields of Gettysburg, Penn. and Little
Bighorn, Mont.
Matthew Enriquez 'l3 spoke enthusiastically about his
2010 Sophomore College experience with Sagan.
"I got to interact in a very active way with such an amaz
ing professor, but also with history itself," Enriquez said.
"Professor Sagan's passion brought the battlefields to life,"
Aside from teaching classes, Sagan is also a senior fellow
at the Freeman Spogli Institute (FSI) and emeritus co-di
rector of the Center for International Security and Co-op
eration (CISAC) at Stanford.
