## RAVALATIONS Let's leave Trayvon alone 
### Ravali Reddy 
Simply put, the Trayvon Mar
tin case that has been in the
news since the night of Feb.
26 is a doozy. Though it has been
over a month since Trayvon's
death, it is of little surprise that
the case is still making headlines
across the nation. The story of
how neighborhood watch patrol
man George Zimmerman fatally
shot an unarmed, black 17-year
old walking around his own
neighborhood, and then claimed
self-defense, has all the makings
of a sensationalistic news story,
and the media has been having a
field day.
I've been following the case
closely since day one, curious to
see the outcome and keeping my
self updated by reading articles
from various sources as the days
go by. After listening to the 911
calls and reading through the mul
tiple accounts of the confronta
tion between Trayvon and Zim
merman, I now find myself com
ing across a different set of arti
cles: those attempting to dig into
Trayvon's past and paint the pic
ture of him as a troubled young
man.
Some media outlets have
made a point of emphasizing the
fact that Trayvon was with his fa
ther on the day that he was shot
because he had received a 10-day
suspension from his high school
a suspension that was issued
because Trayvon had been caught
in an unauthorized area on the
school's campus, according to his
father.
Others have chosen to focus on
Trayvon's multiple tattoos. Ap
parently, perusing Trayvon's Twit
ter and Myspace accounts have al
lowed reporters to procure pho
tos of Trayvon's two tattoos. One
was a large tattoo that took up
most of his upper arm and the
other was on his wrist. It said
"Sybrina," his mom's name.
Still others have gone on to
pull screen-captures of Facebook
posts from Trayvon's friends that
imply that he may have smoked
marijuana, a fact that they believe
is confirmed by the pictures of
blunts that some of his Twitter fol
lowers chose to post.
As I sort through the multitude
of articles focusing on this subject
matter, I can't help but wonder
how this information is being re
ceived.
If my conservative, immigrant
mother was told that there was a
kid at school with tattoos who
smoked weed and had been sus
pended, she would immediately
declare the described individual
as a "hoodlum" and tell me not to
hang out with him. But when I
hear these details, I can't help but
laugh and think about some of the
people I knew in high school who
fit this description. To me, the de
tails above make me think of
nothing more than a naive high
schooler at that point in his life
when he thinks he's invincible.
Someone young enough to think
the best way to make his mom
proud is to tattoo her name across
his wrist.
Still, I find myself thinking, so
what? How is any of this informa
tion at all relevant to the events of
Feb. 26?
These details being presented
about Trayvon and his life,regard-

less of whether they are true or
false, have absolutely nothing to
do with what transpired on the
night he was killed. They merely
serve to help those of us who did
n't know Trayvon form our own
prejudices and pick sides based on
irrelevant information. It pro
vides people with the means to
mold the story of that night in a
way that they see fit.
At the end of the day, it doesn't
matter whether Trayvon was sus
pended or even expelled. None of
this information about Trayvon or
his past is relevant to his death,
because the fact is that George
Zimmerman didn't know any
thing about Trayvon when they
came across each other that night.
He didn't shoot Trayvon because
he was an alleged drug dealer or
because he had multiple tattoos.
All we know is that he shot
Trayvon based on what happened
in the moments their lives inter
sected on that night, so why is it
even necessary for the media to
dig into Trayvon's past and slan
der him posthumously?
That having been said, it's im
portant to look at the flip side and
realize that the attempts to paint
Trayvon in an extremely positive
light are just as irrelevant as those
that are attempting to taint his
character. Both attempts to char
acterize Trayvon should not be
taken seriously.
Sure, Trayvon may not have
been the fresh-faced and innocent
kid that his family is portraying
him as, but can you really blame
his parents for trying to remem
ber their son in the best light pos
sible? The Martin family has been
criticized for their supposed at
tempts to "cover up" darker parts
of Trayvon's life, but is anyone re
ally surprised that two parents
who lost a young son are trying to
remember only the good parts of
his life? For the media to deny
them the right to ask others to re
member their son as they see fit is
simply adding insult to injury. At
this point, let's just remember to
focus on the events that happened
on that Sunday night, and in doing
so, let Trayvon rest in peace.
