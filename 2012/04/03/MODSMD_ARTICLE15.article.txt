# FROM FARM TO FORK
## Eric Schlosser's fears of elitism 
### Jenny Rempel 
It should come as no surprise
that Eric Schlosser can weave a
great narrative. Perhaps most
famous for authoring "Fast Food
Nation" and producing the movie
"Food, Inc.," Schlosser has had an
illustrious career as an investiga
tive journalist. Fie has delved into
the seedy depths of the fast food
industry to reveal truths as shock
ing as those described in Upton
Sinclair's muckraking work "The
Jungle." The Stanford community
had the opportunity to witness
Schlosser's storytelling abilities
and ponder the food movement's
tendency toward elitism at the an
nual Conradin Von Gugelberg
Memorial Lecture.
Schlosser's lecture began with
a history of the modern environ
mental movement, including a cri
tique of its later tendencies to
ward elitism. By focusing the
wilderness-preservation effort on
recreation or "improving land val
ues around second homes,"
Schlosser argued, the environ
mental movement became unwill
ing to compromise, and it lost
touch with ordinary, working peo
ple. "Environmentalism, often
with the best of intentions," said
Schlosser, "moved to a place
where it ignored the fact that

human beings are a part of these
ecosystems." Those working in
agriculture tend to have a greater
appreciation for just how funda
mentally humans have altered
and are a part of their ecosystems,
but this trend toward elitism also
affects the sustainable-foods
movement.
Following his brief but power
ful history of modern environ
mentalism, Schlosser moved onto
his own forte: industrialized food.
He began by stating that our food
system has changed more in the
past 40 years than in the previous
40,000, bringing attention to de
velopments such as genetic modi
fication, cloning and wide-scale
centralization. After touching on
pink slime and highlighting the
fact that the typical fast-food
hamburger may contain pieces of
1,063 different cattle coming from
up to five countries, Schlosser
characterized the movement that
has arisen to address these ills. He
praised colleges for the passion
behind campus food activism, but
he also cautioned against the dan
ger of having a "very, very narrow
base" of supporters.
Coming just a few days after a
Cesar Chavez Day discussion of
farmworkers' rights at El Centro
Chicano, Schlosser's words about
broadening the food movement
fell on eager ears. As a young ac
tivist striving to understand my
role within the food movement, it
was encouraging to hear Schloss
er emphasize the need for a
broader social-justice emphasis.
Too often, "foodies" can focus
so closely on the source and qual
ity of their own food that they fail
to recognize broader injustices
within the system. As Schlosser
said, we sometimes seem "to care
more about endangered snails
than about human beings" and
"more about the taste of some
Napa wine than about the migrant
workers who harvest those
grapes." Though Schlosser
brought up an important critique
of the marginalized voices farm
workers and the urban poor have
within the sustainable-food
movement, these realities are
changing and many food activists
do care deeply about creating a
system that is sustainable for
every participant.
The best outcome of talks such
as Schlosser's is rarely new infor
mation but instead new inspira
tion. As a relatively well-informed
student within the campus envi
ronmental and food movements, I
did not garner a great deal of new
knowledge from the lecture. This
was well offset by my sense of
newfound motivation at the end

of the talk, but I was rather sad
dened that Schlosser did not pro
vide any of his own visions for the
future. He did a wonderful job
characterizing the problems of in
dustrial food systems and caution
ing against the potential for ac
tivist elitism, but the talk lacked a
concrete, actionable strategy for
improving food systems or reduc
ing fragmentation within the larg
er environmental and sustain
able-food movements.
His narrative, though com
pelling, was also incapable of cov
ering the nuances of these food
movements in anything but broad
brushstrokes. As one student
pointed out during the question
and-answer section following the
lecture, Schlosser's very narrative
marginalized the voices of farm
worker activists and the urban
poor, the individuals for which he
encouraged greater inclusiveness.
Despite these shortcomings,
which are often inevitable in short
talks (and short opinion pieces), I
walked away from Cemex Audi
torium with a new sense of moti
vation and drive with which to
pursue my activism. And I also
walked out with my own vision.
Though it may be trite and simi
larly criticized for its lack of con
creteness, I hope to help create a
food system that is sustainable for
people and the planet at each
stage in its production and pro
cessing. Stanford truly does exist
in a bubble, and every activist
should be wary of this bubble's
tendency to amplify existing
trends toward elitism.

Schlosser's lecture began with
a history of the modern environ
mental movement, including a cri
tique of its later tendencies to
ward elitism. By focusing the
wilderness-preservation effort on
recreation or "improving land val
ues around second homes,"
Schlosser argued, the environ
mental movement became unwill
ing to compromise, and it lost
touch with ordinary, working peo
ple. "Environmentalism, often
with the best of intentions," said
Schlosser, "moved to a place
where it ignored the fact that

human beings are a part of these
ecosystems." Those working in
agriculture tend to have a greater
appreciation for just how funda
mentally humans have altered
and are a part of their ecosystems,
but this trend toward elitism also
affects the sustainable-foods
movement.
Following his brief but power
ful history of modern environ
mentalism, Schlosser moved onto
his own forte: industrialized food.
He began by stating that our food
system has changed more in the
past 40 years than in the previous
40,000, bringing attention to de
velopments such as genetic modi
fication, cloning and wide-scale
centralization. After touching on
pink slime and highlighting the
fact that the typical fast-food
hamburger may contain pieces of
1,063 different cattle coming from
up to five countries, Schlosser
characterized the movement that
has arisen to address these ills. He
praised colleges for the passion
behind campus food activism, but
he also cautioned against the dan
ger of having a "very, very narrow
base" of supporters.
Coming just a few days after a
Cesar Chavez Day discussion of
farmworkers' rights at El Centro
Chicano, Schlosser's words about
broadening the food movement
fell on eager ears. As a young ac
tivist striving to understand my
role within the food movement, it
was encouraging to hear Schloss
er emphasize the need for a
broader social-justice emphasis.
Too often, "foodies" can focus
so closely on the source and qual
ity of their own food that they fail
to recognize broader injustices
within the system. As Schlosser
said, we sometimes seem "to care
more about endangered snails
than about human beings" and
"more about the taste of some
Napa wine than about the migrant
workers who harvest those
grapes." Though Schlosser
brought up an important critique
of the marginalized voices farm
workers and the urban poor have
within the sustainable-food
movement, these realities are
changing and many food activists
do care deeply about creating a
system that is sustainable for
every participant.
The best outcome of talks such
as Schlosser's is rarely new infor
mation but instead new inspira
tion. As a relatively well-informed
student within the campus envi
ronmental and food movements, I
did not garner a great deal of new
knowledge from the lecture. This
was well offset by my sense of
newfound motivation at the end

of the talk, but I was rather sad
dened that Schlosser did not pro
vide any of his own visions for the
future. He did a wonderful job
characterizing the problems of in
dustrial food systems and caution
ing against the potential for ac
tivist elitism, but the talk lacked a
concrete, actionable strategy for
improving food systems or reduc
ing fragmentation within the larg
er environmental and sustain
able-food movements.
His narrative, though com
pelling, was also incapable of cov
ering the nuances of these food
movements in anything but broad
brushstrokes. As one student
pointed out during the question
and-answer section following the
lecture, Schlosser's very narrative
marginalized the voices of farm
worker activists and the urban
poor, the individuals for which he
encouraged greater inclusiveness.
Despite these shortcomings,
which are often inevitable in short
talks (and short opinion pieces), I
walked away from Cemex Audi
torium with a new sense of moti
vation and drive with which to
pursue my activism. And I also
walked out with my own vision.
Though it may be trite and simi
larly criticized for its lack of con
creteness, I hope to help create a
food system that is sustainable for
people and the planet at each
stage in its production and pro
cessing. Stanford truly does exist
in a bubble, and every activist
should be wary of this bubble's
tendency to amplify existing
trends toward elitism.

It should come as no surprise
that Eric Schlosser can weave a
great narrative. Perhaps most
famous for authoring "Fast Food
Nation" and producing the movie
"Food, Inc.," Schlosser has had an
illustrious career as an investiga
tive journalist. Fie has delved into
the seedy depths of the fast food
industry to reveal truths as shock
ing as those described in Upton
Sinclair's muckraking work "The
Jungle." The Stanford community
had the opportunity to witness
Schlosser's storytelling abilities
and ponder the food movement's
tendency toward elitism at the an
nual Conradin Von Gugelberg
