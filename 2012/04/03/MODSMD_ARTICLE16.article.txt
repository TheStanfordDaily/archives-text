## Women's ball needs the dunk 
### Tom Taylor 
After Baylor ensured
Stanford would be re
turning home empty
handed from its fifth
straight NCAA Final
Four appearance, it almost feels a bit
soon to be writing another column
about women's basketball. The
wounds haven't had time to heal.
But there is something I really want
to discuss before everyone forgets
about college basketball for another
few months.
At a media conference last
week, prior to the women's bas
ketball team jetting off to Denver,
I had my suspicions confirmed:
Stanford's star senior forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike can dunk.
This really shouldn't come as a
surprise. She can hit just about
any shot from the floor and, as
anyone who has seen her play
during her time on the Farm can
attest, she clearly has the neces
sary leaping ability. At just 6-foot
2, she might not stand as close to
the basket as 6-foot-8 Baylor jun
ior forward Brittney Griner, but
dunking is such an extreme rarity
in women's basketball that I have
to admit I wasn't sure.
At the same conference, Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer
talked about what it might take to
boost the popularity of her sport.
She also mentioned Griner's
dunking, enthusing that it was
great for the game and that, even
if Griner had slam-dunked the
ball during Sunday's semifinal, it
would only have hurt as much as a
standard two-point jump shot.
I find it hard not to see connec
tions between the two answers.
There are many who dismiss
women's basketball because of
the lack of such crowd-pleasing
moves. They are wrong, of course.
There might not be quite the pari
ty of talent across the whole of
women's college basketball as
there is in men's, perhaps evi
denced by all four No. 1 seeds
reaching the Final Four, but that
doesn't mean that the top players
aren't extraordinarily talented
athletes capable of thrilling those
sports fans knowledgeable and
enthusiastic enough to come
watch.
If women's basketball is to
grow in popularity, though, it is
going to need to appeal to the
less-informed and fickle fans. It is
going to need something eye
catching, something like a dunk
shot.
We know that Griner can dunk
she's shown us that twice in this
NCAA tournament alone but
knowing that Nneka is also capa
ble raises the question: How many
of the hundreds of talented col
lege players out there can also ac
complish this feat?
The answer is probably a lot.
Just looking at Stanford's team, it
is easy to suspect that at least
Nneka's sister, sophomore for
ward Chiney Ogwumike, proba
bly can. But, if they can, why don't
they?
My guess is that dunking is
caught in a vicious circle. It is con
sidered a high-risk shot, and thus
it is neither practiced nor encour
aged by coaches. As a result, play
ers don't hone their dunking
skills, and if they try and fail, they
are certain to be criticized for
turning the ball over.
I see the same problem in foot
ball with the lateral pass. As some
one who grew up in the country
that brought us American foot
ball's predecessor, rugby, I am
convinced that this play is not just
achievable, but could be used to
great effect to break through the
defensive line. But, because it al
most is never used, football play
ers just don't have the ball-han
dling skills and the learned expe
rience of how to use it to best ef
fect, and thus it becomes a very
risky play.
In close games, perhaps coach
es don't yet want to let the reins
off their players and allow them to
take a chance on a dunk, but there
are many contests in which the
top players could go for it without
risking the outcome. At the end of
a blowout, the starters often get
taken out early, and although it is
great to see bench player gaining
experience, why not, at least occa
sionally, just let the stars go and
show us what they can really do?
As more players get to show
off their abilities in-game, the ac
tual dunks themselves would im
prove, too. Griner's first dunk in
this year's tournament didn't
seem like anything to write home
about, but it stood out as impres
sive simply because this type of
shot never happens in women's
basketball. I don't mean to take
anything away from her skills by
saying this if more of her fel

low players were putting in the
same shot, I am sure that compe
tition would drive Griner to be
more spectacular.
And when dunking becomes a
regular feature of the women's
game, there won't be any excuses
left for sports fans to tune out.

Tom Taylor also wants to know if
anyone else thinks Brittney Griner
will be the second pick in the NBA
Draft after Anthony Davis. Tell him
why you hope that is the case at
torn. taylor@stanford. edu.
