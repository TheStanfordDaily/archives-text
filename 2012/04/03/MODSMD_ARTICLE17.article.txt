They say the third time's the charm, and
after the No. 6 Stanford baseball team domi
nated St. Mary's in both of the teams' previous
meetings, that looked like the case for the
Gaels at Sunken Diamond last night. In game
three, St. Mary's was up 8-3 heading to the bot
tom of the ninth, in position to finally secure a
win against the Cardinal.
Not so fast.
In a wild, four-hour-and-15-minute contest
that saw the Cardinal erase that five-run deficit,
get the game-winning hit from sophomore
Danny Diekroeger in just his fifth appearance
of the season and rely on junior third baseman
Stephen Piscotty to pitch coming in not
once, but twice for the win, Stanford got a
much-needed injection of energy in a 9-8 victo
ry on the Farm.
After the squad lost four of its past five, this
one has got to feel pretty sweet for the Cardinal

(17-6,2-4 Pac-12).
"As far as the momentum, I think we've got
that now," Piscotty said.
Stanford has struggled with its fielding and
hitting during its current slump, but this time it
was the Cardinal bullpen that took a beating, as
the Gaels burned through eight Stanford pitch
ers with 17 hits in the first nine innings and
forced head coach Mark Marquess to insert
Piscotty.
At the plate, though, the Cardinal got con
tinued production from sophomore first base
man Brian Ragira, who extended his hit streak
to eight games with three more base hits and
two RBI.

"I'm so impressed with Ragira, because he
went through a little bit of a slump a couple of
weeks ago," Piscotty said. "He doesn't let frus
tration get to him, and that really shows in how
quickly he rebounded and just the solid hits
he's been having."
Marquess used the midweek matchup as an
opportunity to tweak his struggling lineup. Be

sides giving juniors leftfielder Tyler Gaffney
and catcher Eric Smith the night off, Marquess
benched shortstop Lonnie Kauppila for just
the second time this season, a result of a 3-20
hitting stretch for the sophomore that included
a five-error disaster in an 8-4 loss to USC on
March 26. Taking his place was junior Kenny
Diekroeger, who started 56 of 57 games at short
in 2011 before switching to second base after
this year's opener, with upstart freshman Alex
Blandino getting his first start in the infield
after knocking in six runs in five games as the
squad's designated hitter last week.
The moves seemed to backfire in the top of
the second. With the Gaels already up 2-0 on a
pair of first-inning doubles off junior righty
Dean McArdle, senior catcher Tony DeMello
launched another two-bagger off the glove of
diving junior Justin Ringo, a play that would
have likely been made had the speedy Gaffney
been in left. Two batters later, Blandino booted
a two-out grounder that would've ended the in
ning but instead extended the St. Mary's lead to
three.
With Ragira on the basepaths, though,
Blandino made up for his mistake, launching
his second career home run into left to narrow
the margin to one.
The Gaels responded in the top of the third.
With the wind blowing out to left, catcher Troy
Channing skied a ball over Ringo's head that
just didn't seem to want to come down, clearing
the left-field fence to make it 4-2 and force
McArdle from the game. Junior reliever Sahil
Bloom quickly allowed another double to set
St. Mary's up in scoring position yet again.
But even after a terrible defensive stretch
that saw the Cardinal nearly double its error
total in a week's time, the Stanford fielders
came through in the third inning to bail out
Bloom. Kenny Diekroeger grabbed a grounder
and adeptly gunned out freshman first base
man Collin Ferguson at third instead of taking
the easy force out; on an ensuing single, sopho
more rightfielder Austin Wilson fired across
the diamond just in time for the tag at third
base.
"We're infinitely better [when we play good
defense]," Piscotty said. "When we don't allow
them any free bases, it makes it tough for the
other team to score runs."
Kenny Diekroeger came through again
with two on and two out in the fifth, ranging to
grab a grounder from senior Chris Murphy and
beating him to first with an off-balance throw.
