### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
They say the third time's the charm, and
after the No. 6 Stanford baseball team domi
nated St. Mary's in both of the teams' previous
meetings, that looked like the case for the
Gaels at Sunken Diamond last night. In game
three, St. Mary's was up 8-3 heading to the bot
tom of the ninth, in position to finally secure a
win against the Cardinal.
Not so fast.
In a wild, four-hour-and-15-minute contest
that saw the Cardinal erase that five-run deficit,
get the game-winning hit from sophomore
Danny Diekroeger in just his fifth appearance
of the season and rely on junior third baseman
Stephen Piscotty to pitch coming in not
once, but twice for the win, Stanford got a
much-needed injection of energy in a 9-8 victo
ry on the Farm.
After the squad lost four of its past five, this
one has got to feel pretty sweet for the Cardinal

(17-6,2-4 Pac-12).
"As far as the momentum, I think we've got
that now," Piscotty said.
Stanford has struggled with its fielding and
hitting during its current slump, but this time it
was the Cardinal bullpen that took a beating, as
the Gaels burned through eight Stanford pitch
ers with 17 hits in the first nine innings and
forced head coach Mark Marquess to insert
Piscotty.
At the plate, though, the Cardinal got con
tinued production from sophomore first base
man Brian Ragira, who extended his hit streak
to eight games with three more base hits and
two RBI.

"I'm so impressed with Ragira, because he
went through a little bit of a slump a couple of
weeks ago," Piscotty said. "He doesn't let frus
tration get to him, and that really shows in how
quickly he rebounded and just the solid hits
he's been having."
Marquess used the midweek matchup as an
opportunity to tweak his struggling lineup. Be

sides giving juniors leftfielder Tyler Gaffney
and catcher Eric Smith the night off, Marquess
benched shortstop Lonnie Kauppila for just
the second time this season, a result of a 3-20
hitting stretch for the sophomore that included
a five-error disaster in an 8-4 loss to USC on
March 26. Taking his place was junior Kenny
Diekroeger, who started 56 of 57 games at short
in 2011 before switching to second base after
this year's opener, with upstart freshman Alex
Blandino getting his first start in the infield
after knocking in six runs in five games as the
squad's designated hitter last week.
The moves seemed to backfire in the top of
the second. With the Gaels already up 2-0 on a
pair of first-inning doubles off junior righty
Dean McArdle, senior catcher Tony DeMello
launched another two-bagger off the glove of
diving junior Justin Ringo, a play that would
have likely been made had the speedy Gaffney
been in left. Two batters later, Blandino booted
a two-out grounder that would've ended the in
ning but instead extended the St. Mary's lead to
three.
With Ragira on the basepaths, though,
Blandino made up for his mistake, launching
his second career home run into left to narrow
the margin to one.
The Gaels responded in the top of the third.
With the wind blowing out to left, catcher Troy
Channing skied a ball over Ringo's head that
just didn't seem to want to come down, clearing
the left-field fence to make it 4-2 and force
McArdle from the game. Junior reliever Sahil
Bloom quickly allowed another double to set
St. Mary's up in scoring position yet again.
But even after a terrible defensive stretch
that saw the Cardinal nearly double its error
total in a week's time, the Stanford fielders
came through in the third inning to bail out
Bloom. Kenny Diekroeger grabbed a grounder
and adeptly gunned out freshman first base
man Collin Ferguson at third instead of taking
the easy force out; on an ensuing single, sopho
more rightfielder Austin Wilson fired across
the diamond just in time for the tag at third
base.
"We're infinitely better [when we play good
defense]," Piscotty said. "When we don't allow
them any free bases, it makes it tough for the
other team to score runs."
Kenny Diekroeger came through again
with two on and two out in the fifth, ranging to
grab a grounder from senior Chris Murphy and
beating him to first with an off-balance throw.

The Stanford baseball team overcame a five-run deficit in the ninth inning and eventually beat
St. Mary's, 9-8, in the 11 th. Sophomore Danny Diekroeger hit the game-winner for the Card.
Yet the Gaels tacked on a fifth run
on a sacrifice in the sixth, getting six
hits off Bloom in just over three in
nings, before making it 6-2 with a
two-out rally against freshman
righty David Schmidt in the sev
enth.
Stanford set itself up for a
comeback in the bottom half of
frame, getting two runners on with
no outs, but a double-play and a
full-count strikeout by Kenny
Diekroeger limited the damage to
a single run. St. Mary's reliever Jor
dan Brockett got out of the inning,
having to face just 16 Cardinal bat
ters in his four innings of work.
Stanford needed four different
hurlers to get out of the eighth, and
ironically it was Piscotty mak
ing his second pitching appearance
of the season who escaped the
jam after two runs had already
come around to score for the
Gaels.
With Piscotty going back to
third base for the ninth, redshirt
sophomore lefty Garrett Hughes
had a clean inning on the mound
for Stanford, striking out two bat
ters in his first appearance of the
season. Still, it looked like it would
n't really matter with the score at 8-
3 heading to the bottom of the
ninth.
"Honestly, it felt a little dejected
in the dugout," Danny Diekroeger
said. "Guys felt like maybe we
were going to lose this one."
But the Cardinal came up in the
clutch, loading the bases to force a
pitching change. After junior cen
terfielder Jake Stewart fouled out,
Stanford got one run back on a
Kenny Diekroeger single, but a
Piscotty pop fly didn't leave the in
field and the Cardinal was down to
its final out and was still down by
four.
Luckily it was Ragira who came
to the plate, and Stanford's best hit
ter of late doubled into right-center
to bring in two runs and make it 8-
6. With the Gaels outfielders play
ing deep in hopes of snagging a fly
ball from Cardinal power hitter
Wilson, the sophomore instead
blooped one into right field to tie
things up.
"That's what you've got to bank

on, those clutch hits down late in
the game," Piscotty said. "That's
what we had to do, and we did it."
Having pinch-hit for the desig
nated hitter spot with Piscotty as
the pitcher in the eighth. Marquess
no longer had access to his DH slot,
and he opted to bring the presea
son Ail-American back into the
game to pitch the 10th so he could
keep his star bat in the lineup. The
third baseman looked like a veter
an on the mound, though, allowing
just an infield single in the frame to
give the Cardinal a chance to win it
in the bottom half.
Stanford couldn't convert, but
Piscotty kept rolling on the mound
with a one-two-three top of the
11th. Piscotty also contributed at
the plate, singling in the bottom
half of the frame, but the Cardinal
couldn't move him over and the
marathon rolled past its fourth
hour.
With Gaffney loosening up in
the bullpen perhaps planning to
add reliever to his running
back/leftfielder repertoire Pis
cotty got out Ferguson, who was
hitting 5-of-6 on the night at that
point, to end the inning.
"Coming out twice was kind of

weird," Piscotty laughed after the
game, but his 3.2 innings of two-hit,
three-strikeout pitching would
prove to be enough as the Cardi
nal's leading RBI man moved to 1-
0 on the season. Blandino blooped
a single and was promptly bunted
over to second, and Danny
Diekroeger came to the plate with
the game on his bat.
"Everyone was getting a
chance, so I had a feeling I would
get in there," he said.
Danny Diekroeger made the
most of his opportunity, grounding
a 1 -0 pitch through the right side of
the infield to score Blandino and
get Stanford the win.
"When I hit it, I thought it was in
the right place," he said. "It's awe
some when a team rallies like this,
and I'm pretty confident that we'll
have a good weekend."
Stanford now has a much-need
ed two-day break before facing
Washington (16-9, 3-3 Pac-12) on
the road in a three-game series
starting this Thursday. The Huskies
most recently dropped two of
three at No. 19 Oregon State,

three.
With Ragira on the basepaths, though,
Blandino made up for his mistake, launching
his second career home run into left to narrow
the margin to one.
The Gaels responded in the top of the third.
With the wind blowing out to left, catcher Troy
Channing skied a ball over Ringo's head that

Bloom quickly allowed another double to set
St. Mary's up in scoring position yet again.
But even after a terrible defensive stretch
that saw the Cardinal nearly double its error
total in a week's time, the Stanford fielders
came through in the third inning to bail out
Bloom. Kenny Diekroeger grabbed a grounder
and adeptly gunned out freshman first base
man Collin Ferguson at third instead of taking
the easy force out; on an ensuing single, sopho
more rightfielder Austin Wilson fired across
the diamond just in time for the tag at third
base.
"We're infinitely better [when we play good
defense]," Piscotty said. "When we don't allow
them any free bases, it makes it tough for the

Kenny Diekroeger came through again

grab a grounder from senior Chris Murphy and
beating him to first with an off-balance throw.

The Stanford baseball team overcame a five-run deficit in the ninth inning and eventually beat
St. Mary's, 9-8, in the 11 th. Sophomore Danny Diekroeger hit the game-winner for the Card.
Yet the Gaels tacked on a fifth run
on a sacrifice in the sixth, getting six
hits off Bloom in just over three in
nings, before making it 6-2 with a
two-out rally against freshman
righty David Schmidt in the sev
enth.
Stanford set itself up for a
comeback in the bottom half of
frame, getting two runners on with
no outs, but a double-play and a
full-count strikeout by Kenny
Diekroeger limited the damage to
a single run. St. Mary's reliever Jor
dan Brockett got out of the inning,
having to face just 16 Cardinal bat
ters in his four innings of work.
Stanford needed four different
hurlers to get out of the eighth, and
ironically it was Piscotty mak
ing his second pitching appearance
of the season who escaped the
jam after two runs had already
come around to score for the
Gaels.
With Piscotty going back to
third base for the ninth, redshirt
sophomore lefty Garrett Hughes
had a clean inning on the mound
for Stanford, striking out two bat
ters in his first appearance of the
season. Still, it looked like it would
n't really matter with the score at 8-
3 heading to the bottom of the
ninth.
"Honestly, it felt a little dejected
in the dugout," Danny Diekroeger
said. "Guys felt like maybe we
were going to lose this one."
But the Cardinal came up in the
clutch, loading the bases to force a
pitching change. After junior cen
terfielder Jake Stewart fouled out,
Stanford got one run back on a
Kenny Diekroeger single, but a
Piscotty pop fly didn't leave the in
field and the Cardinal was down to
its final out and was still down by
four.
Luckily it was Ragira who came
to the plate, and Stanford's best hit
ter of late doubled into right-center
to bring in two runs and make it 8-
6. With the Gaels outfielders play
ing deep in hopes of snagging a fly
ball from Cardinal power hitter
Wilson, the sophomore instead
blooped one into right field to tie
things up.
"That's what you've got to bank

on, those clutch hits down late in
the game," Piscotty said. "That's
what we had to do, and we did it."
Having pinch-hit for the desig
nated hitter spot with Piscotty as
the pitcher in the eighth. Marquess
no longer had access to his DH slot,
and he opted to bring the presea
son Ail-American back into the
game to pitch the 10th so he could
keep his star bat in the lineup. The
third baseman looked like a veter
an on the mound, though, allowing
just an infield single in the frame to
give the Cardinal a chance to win it
in the bottom half.
Stanford couldn't convert, but
Piscotty kept rolling on the mound
with a one-two-three top of the
11th. Piscotty also contributed at
the plate, singling in the bottom
half of the frame, but the Cardinal
couldn't move him over and the
marathon rolled past its fourth
hour.
With Gaffney loosening up in
the bullpen perhaps planning to
add reliever to his running
back/leftfielder repertoire Pis
cotty got out Ferguson, who was
hitting 5-of-6 on the night at that
point, to end the inning.
"Coming out twice was kind of

weird," Piscotty laughed after the
game, but his 3.2 innings of two-hit,
three-strikeout pitching would
prove to be enough as the Cardi
nal's leading RBI man moved to 1-
0 on the season. Blandino blooped
a single and was promptly bunted
over to second, and Danny
Diekroeger came to the plate with
the game on his bat.
"Everyone was getting a
chance, so I had a feeling I would
get in there," he said.
Danny Diekroeger made the
most of his opportunity, grounding
a 1 -0 pitch through the right side of
the infield to score Blandino and
get Stanford the win.
"When I hit it, I thought it was in
the right place," he said. "It's awe
some when a team rallies like this,
and I'm pretty confident that we'll
have a good weekend."

They say the third time's the charm, and
after the No. 6 Stanford baseball team domi
nated St. Mary's in both of the teams' previous
meetings, that looked like the case for the
Gaels at Sunken Diamond last night. In game
three, St. Mary's was up 8-3 heading to the bot
tom of the ninth, in position to finally secure a
win against the Cardinal.
Not so fast.
In a wild, four-hour-and-15-minute contest
that saw the Cardinal erase that five-run deficit,
get the game-winning hit from sophomore
Danny Diekroeger in just his fifth appearance
of the season and rely on junior third baseman
Stephen Piscotty to pitch coming in not
once, but twice for the win, Stanford got a
much-needed injection of energy in a 9-8 victo
ry on the Farm.
After the squad lost four of its past five, this
one has got to feel pretty sweet for the Cardinal

(17-6,2-4 Pac-12).
"As far as the momentum, I think we've got
that now," Piscotty said.
Stanford has struggled with its fielding and
hitting during its current slump, but this time it
was the Cardinal bullpen that took a beating, as
the Gaels burned through eight Stanford pitch
ers with 17 hits in the first nine innings and
forced head coach Mark Marquess to insert
Piscotty.
At the plate, though, the Cardinal got con
tinued production from sophomore first base
man Brian Ragira, who extended his hit streak
to eight games with three more base hits and
two RBI.

"I'm so impressed with Ragira, because he
went through a little bit of a slump a couple of
weeks ago," Piscotty said. "He doesn't let frus
tration get to him, and that really shows in how
quickly he rebounded and just the solid hits
he's been having."
Marquess used the midweek matchup as an
opportunity to tweak his struggling lineup. Be

sides giving juniors leftfielder Tyler Gaffney
and catcher Eric Smith the night off, Marquess
benched shortstop Lonnie Kauppila for just
the second time this season, a result of a 3-20
hitting stretch for the sophomore that included
a five-error disaster in an 8-4 loss to USC on
March 26. Taking his place was junior Kenny
Diekroeger, who started 56 of 57 games at short
in 2011 before switching to second base after
this year's opener, with upstart freshman Alex
Blandino getting his first start in the infield
after knocking in six runs in five games as the
squad's designated hitter last week.
The moves seemed to backfire in the top of
the second. With the Gaels already up 2-0 on a
pair of first-inning doubles off junior righty
Dean McArdle, senior catcher Tony DeMello
launched another two-bagger off the glove of
diving junior Justin Ringo, a play that would
have likely been made had the speedy Gaffney
been in left. Two batters later, Blandino booted
a two-out grounder that would've ended the in
ning but instead extended the St. Mary's lead to
three.
With Ragira on the basepaths, though,

said. "Guys felt like maybe we
were going to lose this one."
But the Cardinal came up in the
clutch, loading the bases to force a
pitching change. After junior cen
terfielder Jake Stewart fouled out,
Stanford got one run back on a
Kenny Diekroeger single, but a
Piscotty pop fly didn't leave the in
field and the Cardinal was down to
its final out and was still down by
four.
Luckily it was Ragira who came
to the plate, and Stanford's best hit
ter of late doubled into right-center
to bring in two runs and make it 8-
6. With the Gaels outfielders play
ing deep in hopes of snagging a fly
ball from Cardinal power hitter
Wilson, the sophomore instead
blooped one into right field to tie
things up.
"That's what you've got to bank

on, those clutch hits down late in
the game," Piscotty said. "That's
what we had to do, and we did it."
Having pinch-hit for the desig
nated hitter spot with Piscotty as
the pitcher in the eighth. Marquess
no longer had access to his DH slot,
and he opted to bring the presea
son Ail-American back into the
game to pitch the 10th so he could
keep his star bat in the lineup. The
third baseman looked like a veter
an on the mound, though, allowing
just an infield single in the frame to
give the Cardinal a chance to win it
in the bottom half.
Stanford couldn't convert, but
Piscotty kept rolling on the mound
with a one-two-three top of the
11th. Piscotty also contributed at
the plate, singling in the bottom
half of the frame, but the Cardinal
couldn't move him over and the
marathon rolled past its fourth
hour.
With Gaffney loosening up in
the bullpen perhaps planning to
add reliever to his running
back/leftfielder repertoire Pis
cotty got out Ferguson, who was
hitting 5-of-6 on the night at that
point, to end the inning.
"Coming out twice was kind of

weird," Piscotty laughed after the
game, but his 3.2 innings of two-hit,
three-strikeout pitching would
prove to be enough as the Cardi
nal's leading RBI man moved to 1-
0 on the season. Blandino blooped
a single and was promptly bunted
over to second, and Danny
Diekroeger came to the plate with
the game on his bat.
"Everyone was getting a
chance, so I had a feeling I would
get in there," he said.
Danny Diekroeger made the
most of his opportunity, grounding
a 1 -0 pitch through the right side of
the infield to score Blandino and
get Stanford the win.
"When I hit it, I thought it was in
the right place," he said. "It's awe
some when a team rallies like this,
and I'm pretty confident that we'll
have a good weekend."

They say the third time's the charm, and
after the No. 6 Stanford baseball team domi
nated St. Mary's in both of the teams' previous
meetings, that looked like the case for the
Gaels at Sunken Diamond last night. In game
three, St. Mary's was up 8-3 heading to the bot
tom of the ninth, in position to finally secure a
win against the Cardinal.
Not so fast.
In a wild, four-hour-and-15-minute contest
that saw the Cardinal erase that five-run deficit,
get the game-winning hit from sophomore
Danny Diekroeger in just his fifth appearance
of the season and rely on junior third baseman
Stephen Piscotty to pitch coming in not
once, but twice for the win, Stanford got a
much-needed injection of energy in a 9-8 victo
ry on the Farm.
After the squad lost four of its past five, this
one has got to feel pretty sweet for the Cardinal

(17-6,2-4 Pac-12).
"As far as the momentum, I think we've got
that now," Piscotty said.
Stanford has struggled with its fielding and
hitting during its current slump, but this time it
was the Cardinal bullpen that took a beating, as
the Gaels burned through eight Stanford pitch
ers with 17 hits in the first nine innings and
forced head coach Mark Marquess to insert
Piscotty.
At the plate, though, the Cardinal got con
tinued production from sophomore first base
man Brian Ragira, who extended his hit streak
to eight games with three more base hits and
two RBI.

"I'm so impressed with Ragira, because he
went through a little bit of a slump a couple of
weeks ago," Piscotty said. "He doesn't let frus
tration get to him, and that really shows in how
quickly he rebounded and just the solid hits
he's been having."
Marquess used the midweek matchup as an
opportunity to tweak his struggling lineup. Be

sides giving juniors leftfielder Tyler Gaffney
and catcher Eric Smith the night off, Marquess
benched shortstop Lonnie Kauppila for just
the second time this season, a result of a 3-20
hitting stretch for the sophomore that included
a five-error disaster in an 8-4 loss to USC on
March 26. Taking his place was junior Kenny
Diekroeger, who started 56 of 57 games at short
in 2011 before switching to second base after
this year's opener, with upstart freshman Alex
Blandino getting his first start in the infield
after knocking in six runs in five games as the
squad's designated hitter last week.
The moves seemed to backfire in the top of
the second. With the Gaels already up 2-0 on a
pair of first-inning doubles off junior righty
Dean McArdle, senior catcher Tony DeMello
launched another two-bagger off the glove of
diving junior Justin Ringo, a play that would
have likely been made had the speedy Gaffney
been in left. Two batters later, Blandino booted
a two-out grounder that would've ended the in
ning but instead extended the St. Mary's lead to
three.
With Ragira on the basepaths, though,
Blandino made up for his mistake, launching
his second career home run into left to narrow
the margin to one.
The Gaels responded in the top of the third.
With the wind blowing out to left, catcher Troy
Channing skied a ball over Ringo's head that
just didn't seem to want to come down, clearing
the left-field fence to make it 4-2 and force
McArdle from the game. Junior reliever Sahil
Bloom quickly allowed another double to set
St. Mary's up in scoring position yet again.
But even after a terrible defensive stretch
that saw the Cardinal nearly double its error
total in a week's time, the Stanford fielders
came through in the third inning to bail out
Bloom. Kenny Diekroeger grabbed a grounder
and adeptly gunned out freshman first base
man Collin Ferguson at third instead of taking
the easy force out; on an ensuing single, sopho
more rightfielder Austin Wilson fired across
the diamond just in time for the tag at third
base.
"We're infinitely better [when we play good
defense]," Piscotty said. "When we don't allow
them any free bases, it makes it tough for the
other team to score runs."
Kenny Diekroeger came through again
with two on and two out in the fifth, ranging to
grab a grounder from senior Chris Murphy and
beating him to first with an off-balance throw.


MEHMET INONU/The Stanford Daily
The Stanford baseball team overcame a five-run deficit in the ninth inning and eventually beat
St. Mary's, 9-8, in the 11 th. Sophomore Danny Diekroeger hit the game-winner for the Card.
Yet the Gaels tacked on a fifth run
on a sacrifice in the sixth, getting six
hits off Bloom in just over three in
nings, before making it 6-2 with a
two-out rally against freshman
righty David Schmidt in the sev
enth.
Stanford set itself up for a
comeback in the bottom half of
frame, getting two runners on with
no outs, but a double-play and a
full-count strikeout by Kenny
Diekroeger limited the damage to
a single run. St. Mary's reliever Jor
dan Brockett got out of the inning,
having to face just 16 Cardinal bat
ters in his four innings of work.
Stanford needed four different
hurlers to get out of the eighth, and
ironically it was Piscotty mak
ing his second pitching appearance
of the season who escaped the
jam after two runs had already
come around to score for the
Gaels.
With Piscotty going back to
third base for the ninth, redshirt
sophomore lefty Garrett Hughes
had a clean inning on the mound
for Stanford, striking out two bat
ters in his first appearance of the
season. Still, it looked like it would
n't really matter with the score at 8-
3 heading to the bottom of the
ninth.
