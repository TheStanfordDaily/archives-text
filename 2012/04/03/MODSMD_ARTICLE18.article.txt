# MOSBACHER MINUTE
## A 						turning point for the Card STANFORD LOOKS TO VETS IN ADVERSE TIMES 
### JACK MOSBACHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of the
Stanford baseball team from 2008-2011.
Each week, he 'll take a look at the Cardinal's
ups and downs on its road to the College
World Series.
As No. 2 Stanford headed to Tucson this
past weekend to face No. 8 Arizona, the col
lege baseball world expected a dramatic
showdown between two of the West
Coast's premier teams. Instead, after a mo
mentum-killing, three-game sweep at the
hands of the Wildcats, the Cardinal sudden
ly finds itself in the midst of a midseason
mini-crisis.
These things sometimes happen in col
lege baseball. With the amount of parity
and talent that exists in the tough Pac-12
conference, it is commonly understood
that, on any given weekend, just about any
team can beat any opponent. Furthermore,
Arizona is no pushover. The Wildcats have
been one of the country's most talented and
accomplished teams so far this season, and
the Cardinal knew that it would have to
bring its A-game in order to leave the desert
with a series victory.
So, what was most shocking about this
weekend's series was not that the Cardinal
was swept, but rather how the Cardinal was
swept.
There's no nice way to put this: Stanford
played an ugly brand of baseball, both at
the plate and on the field. On the weekend,
the Stanford offense tallied 24 strikeouts
while the defense committed six costly er
rors, which largely accounted for the losses
on Friday and Saturday. Strikeouts and
sloppy defense are rarely on the resumes of
teams that make it to the College World Se
ries. The Cardinal committed strikeouts
and errors in bunches this weekend, and it
resulted in an ugly sweep at the hands of the
first team Stanford has played that is likely
good enough to make it to Omaha in July.
This Stanford team is overloaded with
talent. This road trip raised the interesting
question: Will they have the heart and soul
to match?
When all is said and done, I
wouldn't be surprised if this past
weekend marked a turning point in
the season. The college baseball
world was watching the Arizona-
Stanford series expectantly, hoping
to see whether or not Stanford was
the real deal. Frankly, the Cardinal
was embarrassed, and on a nation
al stage. Seeing how the team reacts
to this embarrassment will dictate
the rest of the season.
If I'm correct, there are two
ways the season can go from here:
either Stanford uses this past week
end as fuel for its tank and remem
ber that trotting out a stellar lineup
doesn't necessarily translate to vic
tories, or the team will spend too
much time licking its wounds and
ultimately refuse to face the fact
that they need to make some seri
ous midseason adjustments in
order to be a championship-caliber
team.
In this moment of adversity,
leadership is what the Card needs
the most. Stanford's lineup is filled
with players who have played near
ly every game since arriving on the
Farm as freshmen, and this trial will
tell us whether these players have
matured into the type of leaders re
quired on top-notch ball clubs.
Someone needs to stand up and

make it clear that this team expects
its hitters to be tougher in two
strike counts than in three-one
counts and that, while errors are a
part of the game, this team will be
making a new commitment to be
coming the most fundamentally
sound defensive squad in the game.
Someone else needs to stand up
and remind the pitching staff that
the Cardinal fears nobody, that
they are confident enough to go
right after hitters, get ahead in
counts and throw any pitch in any
situation. Someone needs to say
these things, and they'd better do it
fast.
There are clear messages that
need to be sent. The question is,
does the team have the messen
gers? Although Stanford doesn't
have an official team captain, jun
iors Stephen Piscotty and Mark
Appel are the unspoken leaders of
the offense and defense, respec
tively.
The outcome of the last two
thirds of this season will reflect
their ability to rally the troops and
communicate what is to be expect
ed when the Cardinal hits the field,
which is a lot of pressure to put on
the duo. At the same time, their
ability to lead is contingent on the
team's ability to buy into a shared
message, and their willingness to
use adversity as a reason to come
together rather than to break apart.

Jack Mosbacher was a member of the
Stanford baseball team from 2008-2011.
Each week, he 'll take a look at the Cardinal's
ups and downs on its road to the College
World Series.
As No. 2 Stanford headed to Tucson this
past weekend to face No. 8 Arizona, the col
lege baseball world expected a dramatic
showdown between two of the West
Coast's premier teams. Instead, after a mo
mentum-killing, three-game sweep at the
hands of the Wildcats, the Cardinal sudden
ly finds itself in the midst of a midseason
mini-crisis.
These things sometimes happen in col
lege baseball. With the amount of parity
and talent that exists in the tough Pac-12
conference, it is commonly understood
that, on any given weekend, just about any
team can beat any opponent. Furthermore,
Arizona is no pushover. The Wildcats have
been one of the country's most talented and
accomplished teams so far this season, and
the Cardinal knew that it would have to
bring its A-game in order to leave the desert
with a series victory.
So, what was most shocking about this
weekend's series was not that the Cardinal
was swept, but rather how the Cardinal was
swept.
There's no nice way to put this: Stanford
played an ugly brand of baseball, both at
the plate and on the field. On the weekend,
the Stanford offense tallied 24 strikeouts
while the defense committed six costly er
rors, which largely accounted for the losses
on Friday and Saturday. Strikeouts and
sloppy defense are rarely on the resumes of
teams that make it to the College World Se
ries. The Cardinal committed strikeouts
and errors in bunches this weekend, and it
resulted in an ugly sweep at the hands of the
first team Stanford has played that is likely
good enough to make it to Omaha in July.
This Stanford team is overloaded with
talent. This road trip raised the interesting
question: Will they have the heart and soul
to match?
When all is said and done, I
wouldn't be surprised if this past
weekend marked a turning point in
the season. The college baseball
world was watching the Arizona-
Stanford series expectantly, hoping
to see whether or not Stanford was
the real deal. Frankly, the Cardinal
was embarrassed, and on a nation
al stage. Seeing how the team reacts
to this embarrassment will dictate
the rest of the season.
If I'm correct, there are two
ways the season can go from here:
either Stanford uses this past week
end as fuel for its tank and remem
ber that trotting out a stellar lineup
doesn't necessarily translate to vic
tories, or the team will spend too
much time licking its wounds and
ultimately refuse to face the fact
that they need to make some seri
ous midseason adjustments in
order to be a championship-caliber
team.
In this moment of adversity,
leadership is what the Card needs
the most. Stanford's lineup is filled
with players who have played near
ly every game since arriving on the
Farm as freshmen, and this trial will
tell us whether these players have
matured into the type of leaders re
quired on top-notch ball clubs.
Someone needs to stand up and

make it clear that this team expects
its hitters to be tougher in two
strike counts than in three-one
counts and that, while errors are a
part of the game, this team will be
making a new commitment to be
coming the most fundamentally
sound defensive squad in the game.
Someone else needs to stand up
and remind the pitching staff that
the Cardinal fears nobody, that
they are confident enough to go
right after hitters, get ahead in
counts and throw any pitch in any
situation. Someone needs to say
these things, and they'd better do it
fast.
There are clear messages that
need to be sent. The question is,
does the team have the messen
gers? Although Stanford doesn't
have an official team captain, jun
iors Stephen Piscotty and Mark
Appel are the unspoken leaders of
the offense and defense, respec
tively.
The outcome of the last two
thirds of this season will reflect
their ability to rally the troops and
communicate what is to be expect
ed when the Cardinal hits the field,
which is a lot of pressure to put on
the duo. At the same time, their
ability to lead is contingent on the
team's ability to buy into a shared
message, and their willingness to
use adversity as a reason to come
together rather than to break apart.
