# MOSBACHER MINUTE
## A
						turning point for the Card STANFORD LOOKS TO VETS IN ADVERSE TIMES 
### JACK MOSBACHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of the
Stanford baseball team from 2008-2011.
Each week, he 'll take a look at the Cardinal's
ups and downs on its road to the College
World Series.
As No. 2 Stanford headed to Tucson this
past weekend to face No. 8 Arizona, the col
lege baseball world expected a dramatic
showdown between two of the West
Coast's premier teams. Instead, after a mo
mentum-killing, three-game sweep at the
hands of the Wildcats, the Cardinal sudden
ly finds itself in the midst of a midseason
mini-crisis.
These things sometimes happen in col
lege baseball. With the amount of parity
and talent that exists in the tough Pac-12
conference, it is commonly understood
that, on any given weekend, just about any
team can beat any opponent. Furthermore,
Arizona is no pushover. The Wildcats have
been one of the country's most talented and
accomplished teams so far this season, and
the Cardinal knew that it would have to
bring its A-game in order to leave the desert
with a series victory.
So, what was most shocking about this
weekend's series was not that the Cardinal
was swept, but rather how the Cardinal was
swept.
There's no nice way to put this: Stanford
played an ugly brand of baseball, both at
the plate and on the field. On the weekend,
the Stanford offense tallied 24 strikeouts
while the defense committed six costly er
rors, which largely accounted for the losses
on Friday and Saturday. Strikeouts and
sloppy defense are rarely on the resumes of
teams that make it to the College World Se
ries. The Cardinal committed strikeouts
and errors in bunches this weekend, and it
resulted in an ugly sweep at the hands of the
first team Stanford has played that is likely
good enough to make it to Omaha in July.
This Stanford team is overloaded with
talent. This road trip raised the interesting
question: Will they have the heart and soul
to match?
