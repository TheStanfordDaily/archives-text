# SOCAL SPLIT

### DANIEL E. LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
They say time heals all wounds, but for the
No. 5 Stanford men's volleyball team, the
longest layoff in school history brought mixed
results in a treacherous road trip through
Southern California.
The Cardinal certainly came out of the
break fighting, pulling out a tough road split
against No. 7 Pepperdine (13-11, 8-10 MPSF)
and No. 2 USC (18-4,14-4). Stanford (15-6,12-
5) tamed the Waves in five sets, 25-17,22-25,25-
23,20-25,15-12, before falling to the Trojans in
four, 25-22,25-20,15-25,25-20.
Stanford returned from its time off with a
bang, easily taking the first set from Pepper
dine, 25-17, behind good team play and out
standing serving from sophomore Eric
Mochalski, who had two aces that spurred a 7-
1 Stanford run. Mochalski, along with senior
captain Brad Lawson and sophomore Steven
Irvin, was one of three Cardinal hitters who
finished with double-digit kills. The trio had
the mojo working early, as they combined for
10 of their 48 kills in the first set.
"I actually enjoyed the layoff between
matches. It gave us a chance to recuperate and
also focus on individual skills that we needed
to get better at," Lawson said.
The ease with which Stanford controlled

play in the first set and gained a 16-14 advan
tage in the second literally burst when a low
hanging light bulb at Firestone Fieldhouse
shattered after a dig by Pepperdine star Mau
rice Torres. The Waves would use the distrac
tion to regroup, charging past the Cardinal to a
25-22 set victory.
The rest of the match featured a back-and
forth affair that saw 11 ties and four lead
changes in the final three sets. Stanford was fi
nally able to put Pepperdine away behind the
steady and relentless play of Irvin and Lawson,
who combined for 36 kills, 19 digs, five digs and
five aces. With his first ace of the match, Law
son broke the Stanford record for aces in a ca
reer with 116, passing Duncan Blackman for
first all-time. With the win, Stanford won at
Pepperdine for just the second time since 1998.
As tough as Firestone Fieldhouse has been
on the Cardinal in the past, the Trojans of USC
have also never been walk in the park, as they
have won the past three matchups between the
two teams. Despite another strong showing
from Lawson, who tallied his second consecu
tive double-double with 16 kills and 10 digs,
Stanford was not able to find its way past the
more consistent attack of the No. 2 Trojans.
Although the Cardinal considerably
slowed down Trojan senior Tony Ciarelli, the

dynamic outside hitter who regis
tered 28 kills in the last meeting
between the two squads, USC still
hit .351 as a team, paced by red
shirt sophomore Tanner Jansen.
He finished with 17 kills on a siz
zling .519 hitting percentage.
USC was able to take control
of the match in the first set behind
stellar hitting by Ciarelli, Jansen
and freshman Robert Feathers.
The three combined for 11 kills in
the set, including three by Jansen
when USC trailed 22-21.
The second set was different as
USC seized control at the start,
racing out to a 9-5 advantage. The
Cardinal eventually battled back
to tie it at 14, thanks to strong play
from sophomore Brian Cook.
USC would later gain a 23-20 ad
vantage, due in part to a pair of
service errors by Stanford, before
Jansen again closed Stanford out
with consecutive kills.

Stanford dominated the third
set with efficient hitting, as the
Cardinal connected on 13 of its 24
attempts in the period, highlight
ed by four kills from Cook.
USC never gave Stanford a
chance in the fourth set, however,
stifling the Cardinal attack from
the get-go.The Trojans closed out
Stanford in style, with senior
Steven Shandrick tallying his
sixth kill of the match on the final
point.
Following the loss, the Cardi
nal dropped a game behind four
other MPSF teams, including
USC, for first place in the confer
ence. Stanford has to continue im
proving if it wants to host the con
ference tournament.
"It's going to be very impor
tant for us to stick to Stanford vol
leyball, which is a consistent style
of play characterized by great
passing, defense and smart attack
ing," Lawson said.
The Cardinal is back in action
tonight at 7 p.m. against Pacific.
