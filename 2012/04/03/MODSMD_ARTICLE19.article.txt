# SOCAL SPLIT

### DANIEL E. LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
They say time heals all wounds, but for the
No. 5 Stanford men's volleyball team, the
longest layoff in school history brought mixed
results in a treacherous road trip through
Southern California.
The Cardinal certainly came out of the
break fighting, pulling out a tough road split
against No. 7 Pepperdine (13-11, 8-10 MPSF)
and No. 2 USC (18-4,14-4). Stanford (15-6,12-
5) tamed the Waves in five sets, 25-17,22-25,25-
23,20-25,15-12, before falling to the Trojans in
four, 25-22,25-20,15-25,25-20.
Stanford returned from its time off with a
bang, easily taking the first set from Pepper
dine, 25-17, behind good team play and out
standing serving from sophomore Eric
Mochalski, who had two aces that spurred a 7-
1 Stanford run. Mochalski, along with senior
captain Brad Lawson and sophomore Steven
Irvin, was one of three Cardinal hitters who
finished with double-digit kills. The trio had
the mojo working early, as they combined for
10 of their 48 kills in the first set.
"I actually enjoyed the layoff between
matches. It gave us a chance to recuperate and
also focus on individual skills that we needed
to get better at," Lawson said.
The ease with which Stanford controlled

play in the first set and gained a 16-14 advan
tage in the second literally burst when a low
hanging light bulb at Firestone Fieldhouse
shattered after a dig by Pepperdine star Mau
rice Torres. The Waves would use the distrac
tion to regroup, charging past the Cardinal to a
25-22 set victory.
The rest of the match featured a back-and
forth affair that saw 11 ties and four lead
changes in the final three sets. Stanford was fi
nally able to put Pepperdine away behind the
steady and relentless play of Irvin and Lawson,
who combined for 36 kills, 19 digs, five digs and
five aces. With his first ace of the match, Law
son broke the Stanford record for aces in a ca
reer with 116, passing Duncan Blackman for
first all-time. With the win, Stanford won at
Pepperdine for just the second time since 1998.
As tough as Firestone Fieldhouse has been
on the Cardinal in the past, the Trojans of USC
have also never been walk in the park, as they
have won the past three matchups between the
two teams. Despite another strong showing
from Lawson, who tallied his second consecu
tive double-double with 16 kills and 10 digs,
Stanford was not able to find its way past the
more consistent attack of the No. 2 Trojans.
Although the Cardinal considerably
slowed down Trojan senior Tony Ciarelli, the

The Stanford men's volleyball team looked sluggish after a record 23-day hiatus, requiring five
sets to down Pepperdine before losing in four to USC. The Card slipped to second in the MPSF.
