# GSB, Law School top rankings
## Administrators welcome praise, but point to other indicators 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business (GSB) and the Stanford
Law School (SLS) continue to excel
in the U.S. News and World Report's
(USNWR) rankings. The GSB tied
with Harvard University for first
place among business schools in the
publication's 2013 rankings, while
the Law School was ranked second
in the nation.
The tie for first place between the
GSB and the Harvard School of

Business is the third-such occur
rence in the past five years. The Law
School moved into sole possession
of second place, behind Yale Law
School, for the first time since 2007.
While expressing satisfaction
with their placement, both Law
School and GSB representatives
played down the rankings' signifi
cance while emphasizing alternate
means of measuring the programs'
Garth Saloner 'Bl M.S. 'B2 Ph.D.
'B2, dean of the GSB, stated that
although he is very proud of the

GSB's top ranking â€”he would
rather focus on measuring how the
GSB prepares students to succeed
after graduation.
Saloner emphasized that the
GSB prefers to focus on "preparing
our students... so they can make
significant impact in the world."
"We are obviously delighted
when we receive external recogni
tion ... but we keep a balanced per
spective and recognize that these
measurements are, at best, imprecise
