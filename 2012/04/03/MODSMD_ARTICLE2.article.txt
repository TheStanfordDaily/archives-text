# GSB, Law School top rankings
## Administrators welcome praise, but point to other indicators 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business (GSB) and the Stanford
Law School (SLS) continue to excel
in the U.S. News and World Report's
(USNWR) rankings. The GSB tied
with Harvard University for first
place among business schools in the
publication's 2013 rankings, while
the Law School was ranked second
in the nation.
The tie for first place between the
GSB and the Harvard School of

Business is the third-such occur
rence in the past five years. The Law
School moved into sole possession
of second place, behind Yale Law
School, for the first time since 2007.
While expressing satisfaction
with their placement, both Law
School and GSB representatives
played down the rankings' signifi
cance while emphasizing alternate
means of measuring the programs'
Garth Saloner 'Bl M.S. 'B2 Ph.D.
'B2, dean of the GSB, stated that
although he is very proud of the

GSB's top ranking —he would
rather focus on measuring how the
GSB prepares students to succeed
after graduation.
Saloner emphasized that the
GSB prefers to focus on "preparing
our students... so they can make
significant impact in the world."
"We are obviously delighted
when we receive external recogni
tion ... but we keep a balanced per
spective and recognize that these
measurements are, at best, imprecise

and incomplete," added Madhav
Rajan, senior associate dean for
academic affairs at the GSB.
Although the rankings assess
graduate programs through a
range of criteria such as peer
and corporate assessments, gradu
ates' starting salaries and the pro
gram's acceptance rate Saloner
argued that "rankings tend to put
[schools] into a single dimension."
Judith Romero, a Law School
spokesperson, stated that the law
school does not normally com
ment on rankings as a matter of
policy because "what's important
is that students find the right
school for them."
Saloner agreed that, while stu
dents may naturally judge an insti
tution primarily by its ranking, it is
more important to judge whether
a school is a good match for that
particular student.
In addition to the overall cate
gory, the U.S. News and World Re
port also ranked business and law
schools in several specialized cate
gories.
The GSB attained top-five
rankings in accounting, entrepre
neurship, management, market
ing, nonprofit, production/opera
tions and supply chain/logistics.
"The underlying reasons for
the [business] school's success in
these rankings has to do with the
differentiated education we sup
ply to our MBA students," Saloner
said.
Rajan conceded that Stanford
scored relatively poorly in the per
centage of students employed
three months after graduation, but
linked this apparent shortcoming

to the quality and type of educa
tion afforded to GSB graduates.
"Our students have the luxury
of being able to take time and sort
through a variety of career op
tions," Raj an said. "We also have
by far the greatest proportion of
graduates who choose to strike out
on their own in entrepreneurial
ventures."
The Law School excelled in
specific areas, ranking in the top
five law schools in the country for
intellectual property law and in
the list of best law schools ranked
solely by top law firms.
The Law School recently an
nounced the completion of a five
year reform to its second- and
third-year curriculum. The new
program incorporates a more in
terdisciplinary and international
approach, emphasizing clinical
training and team-oriented prob
lem solving and allowing students
greater flexibility to tailor joint de
grees.
"We are playing a critical role
in training the next generation of
leaders through innovative inter
disciplinary and international pro
grams," Romero said.
