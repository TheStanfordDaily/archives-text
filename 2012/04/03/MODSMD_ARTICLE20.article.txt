# MEN'S TENNIS
## Hot start in Pac-12 play 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 8 Stanford men's ten
nis team returned to action dur
ing the week of spring break,
playing in three matches after an
18-day hiatus from competition
for Dead Week and finals. The
long layoff proved costly in Stan
ford's first match back against
No. 7 Pepperdine in Los Angeles.
The match did not go well for
the Cardinal, which suffered one
of its worst defeats in recent
memory, 6-1.
"They killed us," head coach
John Whitlinger said. "The break
was tough on the guys, and I
thought we were ready. Pepper
dine, though, was just a little bit
more ready than we were."
Pepperdine got off to a strong
start against Stanford on its home
court and never looked back, win
ning the doubles points and the
first five singles points and secur
ing the match victory before
Stanford was even on the board.
The road trip continued to
Tucson, Ariz., where a feisty Ari
zona team was waiting for the
Cardinal. This match represented
an important first for Stanford
this season: its first Pac-12 confer
ence match.

"Tucson's not an easy place to
play," Whitlinger said. "There's a
little bit of altitude, there's a lot of
wind, the ball was flying all over
the place and it was 90 degrees."
The team nonetheless re
sponded well to the challenges of
the Arizona match, getting off to
a strong start by sweeping the
doubles point and refusing to let
the Wildcats get back into the
match, ultimately winning 5-2 be
hind a 6-2, 6-1 from senior
Bradley Klahn, a 6-4, 6-4 win
from senior Ryan Thacher and a
7-5, 6-0 win from freshman John
Morrissey.
If Whitlinger and the Cardinal
thought the conditions in Arizona
had been challenging, they were
in for a grueling test in the final
match of the road trip against
Utah.
"When we got in it was like 80
degrees, yet we knew that the
next day, when we would be play
ing the match, it was going to rain
or snow, which it did, with the
snow forcing us to move the
match indoors at an elevation of
5,000 feet," Whitlinger said.
Again, the Cardinal did not
seem to be fazed by the change in
conditions, winning a tightly con
tested, back-and-forth match
against the Utes 4-3. Stanford

dominated the doubles portion of
the match, winning all three con
tests to take a 1-0 lead and got off
to a strong start in singles play be
hind victories from Klahn at the
No. 1 position and Morrissey at
the No. 4 spot. After taking a 3-0
lead, however, the Cardinal strug
gled to record the pivotal fourth
point, losing two matches before
junior Denis Lin managed to
close out his opponent on the
fifth court and clinch victory for
Stanford.
The victories against Arizona
and Utah were big ones for Stan
ford, representing not only
bounce-back wins after the tough
loss against Pepperdine, but also
two big Pac-12 conference victo
ries to kick off the conference por
tion of the Cardinal's schedule.
"I'm really pleased and proud
of the way we bounced back from
Pepperdine and won two tough
matches in really difficult places
to play," Whitlinger said.
Stanford returns home for two
important Pac-12 matches this
weekend at theTaube Family Ten
nis Center, playing Friday against
Oregon and Saturday against
Washington.
