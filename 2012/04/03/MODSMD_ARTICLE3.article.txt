## Researchers find new side effects for drugs 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marshall Watkins 
Researchers from the Stanford
School of Medicine recently created an
algorithm that suggests that inadvertent
impacts of drag use vastly exceed those
detailed by seemingly exhaustive indus
try labeling.
The researchers were able to identify
1,332 drag side effects not currently list
ed on labels, while the algorithm
which sifts through millions of reports in
order to discern "true" side-effects
suggests that the average drug prompts
329 adverse reactions, nearly five times
the 69 currently listed.
The FDA maintains a database of ap
proximately 4 million side effects a
list compiled through consultation with
doctors and patients but the process
of establishing causation may often be
complicated by the consumption of mul
tiple drugs simultaneously and by varia
tion in individual reactions.
One notable side effect uncovered by
the algorithm is the adverse interaction
between common blood pressure med
ications and antidepressants. The combi
nation of the two drugs increases the risk
of a heart condition, which can lead to ir
regular heartbeat and sudden death.
Even after the algorithm's discoveries,
however, follow-up research and clinical
trials will be required before the FDA
can adjust labeling and expand consumer
awareness of adverse side effects.
