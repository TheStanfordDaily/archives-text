# FSI fellow addresses China education gap
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marshall Watkins 
Scott Rozelle, an economist and sen
ior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute
for International Studies, has led recent
efforts to measure and bridge the tech
nological disparities between Chinese
children in rural and urban settings.
While 80 percent of urban Chinese
students have Internet access, only two
percent of their rural counterparts have
the same privileges. Rozelle argues that
the vast gap could result in a "lost gener
ation" of children from rural back
grounds denied the skills to work in a
modern economy, derailing China's
rapid economic growth.
A pilot initiative in which 15 com
puters loaded with games and education
software were made accessible to 60 stu
dents in rural Qinghai province re
sulted in a quick payoff for Rozelle and
the Rural Education Action Project
(REAP), with test scores rising on aver
age from the equivalent of a C+ to a B
within 10 weeks.
Rozelle's work evoked a favorable
response from the Chinese government,
which recently laid out plans calling for
every student in China to have Internet
access within 10 years.
