# Researchers produce 'designer electrons'
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marshall Watkins 
Scientists from Stanford University
and the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory have developed a sys
tem of "designer electrons," an ad
vance that could result in the pro
duction of new devices and mate
rials.
Researchers used a scanning
tunneling microscope to create a
graphene structure a one
atom-thick honeycomb lattice of
carbon atoms which was manu
ally adjusted to mimic the posi
tions that atoms would warp to if
under the strain of magnetic fields
30 percent stronger than what ex
ists on Earth.
Having been repositioned,
electrons subsequently behaved

as if they were under the effect of
a magnetic field even while
none was present.
Researchers said that the out
come provides evidence of poten
tially enormous benefits for
physics testing, in addition to es
tablishing a framework for build
ing new molecules with cus
tomized electronic properties.
"The behavior of electrons in
materials is at the heart of essen
tially all of today's technologies,"
said Hari Manoharan M.S. '92, an
associate professor of physics and
the research team's leader, to
Gizmodo. "We're now able to
tune the fundamental properties
of electrons so they behave in
ways rarely seen in ordinary ma
terials."
