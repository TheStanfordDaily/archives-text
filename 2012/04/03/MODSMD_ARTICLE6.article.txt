## New antibody offers broad cancer treatment 
### JUDITH PELPOLA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers from the Stanford School of
Medicine have developed an antibody
shown to be effective in treating a wide
range of cancers. The antibody encourages
the body's immune system to attack cancer
ous cells and could help treat patients with
advanced cases of the disease.
Irving Weissman M.D. '65, a professor of
pathology at the Stanford Medical School
and the study's lead author, noted that can
cer cells often exhibit a "don't eat me" signal
caused by the CD47 protein, which stops the
body's immune system from attacking and
destroying the cells.
Weissman first observed the expression
of CD47 in blood stem cells, later noting its
presence in leukemia stem and cancer cells,
where the cancer is often more highly ex
pressed.

"This study, which is pretty surprising,
shows that [the signal] is present on every
human cancer that we've tested," Weissman
said.
Researchers took malignant tumors from
human patients and transplanted them into
immune-deficient mice. After a period of
time, the mice were treated with the anti
body, which blocks the CD47 protein and al
lows the immune system to attack unshield
ed cancer cells.
The treatment was effective in all cases,
reducing the spread of cancerous cells and
often even ridding the mice of tumors alto
gether. Researchers tested the treatment on
ovarian, breast, brain, pancreatic and colon
cancers.
"The chances that the tumor cells can de
velop resistance in away that we couldn't
overcome it are pretty low," said Jens-Peter
Volkmer, one of the study's co-authors.
Researchers noted, however, that the an

tibody treatment may initially induce tem
porary, mild anemia in test subjects. The
treatment often destroyed the mice's oldest
red blood cells which also use CD47 to
deter the body's immune system before
affecting cancer cells.
The study later used drugs that increase
red blood cell count to counter the anemia.
Red blood cell count did not decrease with
subsequent doses of the treatment.
The antibody treatment may also prove
significant in treating other diseases, accord
ing to the researchers.
"We definitely think CD47 is involved in
other forms of possibly auto-inflammatory
diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, and we're
investigating all these different pathways ...
but a lot of that is preliminary right now,"
said Stephen Willingham, another of the
study's co-authors.
As the treatment enters clini
cal trials which will test the ef
fect of the treatment and any pos
sible toxicity on human patients
with advanced cancers Weiss
man and his team will conduct
further testing with a group based
in the United Kingdom.
"Because they have a national
health plan and a single payer for
the insurance, they only have to
negotiate once," Weissman ex
plained.
The collaboration also grants
researchers access to a greater
pool of subjects, as significantly
more cancer patients in the Unit
ed Kingdom enter clinical trials
compared to the United States.
While there will be an "all-com
ers" clinical trial held at Stan
ford, the researchers said they
anticipate a substantial delay be
fore the trial becomes available.
The researchers noted that
the treatment will likely be
priced in away that increases ac
cessibility for patients without
insurance or whose insurance
does not cover the treatment.
However, they added that the
cost will depend in part on how
much of the antibody would be
needed to cure patients and

whether other drugs are needed
in combination with the anti
body.
"It's our intention to recom
mend setting a price that the
greatest benefit will go to the
most people, therefore it must be
at a lower price," Weissman said.
Treatments to be used in the
clinical trials will be manufac
tured by the end of 2013, though
Weissman expressed his desire to
push manufacturers to acceler
ate production.

"What we're doing now is
what people usually do in a start
up company," Weissman said.
"We're doing this with a batch of
Stanford medical students, Ph.D.
students, clinical fellows, post
doctoral fellows and almost
nobody is professional. So every
step of the way, we're training
people, and I'm learning myself
how you really do a clinical trial."
