## Palo Alto theater development plan moves ahead 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
After 42 years seeking a permanent
home, local professional theater company
Theatre Works may finally find one, thanks
to John Arrillaga's proposal to build a the
atre and office complex on University land in
downtown Palo Alto.
While the project's proposal is still under
development and no current formal doc
umentation exists Steve Emslie, Palo
Alto deputy city manager, said that concept
plans could be presented to the City Council
in a month. The Council previously author
ized the hiring of consultants to further ex
plore the proposal.
Any revenue from the office spaces pro
posed for Stanford land would go directly to
the University.
Jean McCown, Stanford director of com
munity relations, wrote in an email to The
Daily that while Stanford has not been in
volved in the development of the proposal,
the University supports the exploration cur

rently taking place.
"It is an intriguing project for the proper
ty adjacent to the University Avenue Cal
train station in Palo Alto, which is owned by
Stanford," McCown wrote. "The University
is pleased that the City of Palo Alto will be
giving this proposal its thoughtful and con
structive consideration."
According to Emslie, the current propos
al includes an office building at about
200,000 square feet, a retail center at about
20,000 to 50,000 square feet and a perform
ing arts center with a capacity of 600, all of
which will be at 27 University Ave.
Though Arrillaga initially proposed the
project in downtown Palo Alto as away to
better use the land adjacent to the Caltrain
station, the City Council shaped the idea for
a performing arts center.
"One of our premiere dramatic compa
nies, Theatre Works, has been in need of a
permanent home," Emslie said. "It would
provide stability to that organization and it
would provide a regional, cultural destina
tion for Palo Alto."

Theatre Works which employs a staff
of 45 is the third-largest professional the
ater company in the Bay Area. The compa
ny's roots date back to 1970, and the compa
ny puts on an average of 250 to 260 perform
ances a year.
Robert Kelley '6B, Theatre Works' artistic
director, said that the company is currently
involved in articulating its needs for the the
ater complex.
Concerns include the incorporation of
general necessities, such as a large auditori
um and a fly loft to move scenery around on
stage. Because of Theatre Works's education
al activities, a costume shop and classrooms
would be needed along with some office
space to coordinate operations.
For Kelley, the proposal would play a sig
nificant role in strengthening ties between
Stanford and Palo Alto, in addition to giving
Theater Works much-needed logistical sup
port.
"The idea of a free flow of people be-
