Course description: Today Iranian
plays—both in traditional and

Despite many obstacles, some
Iranian plays have been translated
into English and some prominent
Iranian figures are successful
stage directors outside Iran.
Forty six years ago when "Theater
in Iran" (a monograph on the
history of Iranian plays) by Bahram
Beyzaie was first published, it put
the then contemporary Iranian
theater movement—which was
altogether westernizing itself
blindly -face to face with a new
kind of self-awareness. Hence in

Contemporary Iranian
Theater
Instructor: Bahram Beyzaie
Day and Time: F 3:15-6:05
Classroom: 380-380F
Units: 1 -3
Course description: Today Iranian
plays—both in traditional and
contemporary styles—are staged
in theater festivals throughout the
world play their role in forming
a universal language of theater
which combine the heritages from
countries in all five continents.
Despite many obstacles, some
Iranian plays have been translated
into English and some prominent
Iranian figures are successful
stage directors outside Iran.
Forty six years ago when "Theater
in Iran" (a monograph on the
history of Iranian plays) by Bahram
Beyzaie was first published, it put
the then contemporary Iranian
theater movement—which was
altogether westernizing itself
blindly -face to face with a new
kind of self-awareness. Hence in
today's generation of playwrights
and stage directors in Iran, all
know something of their theatrical
heritage.
