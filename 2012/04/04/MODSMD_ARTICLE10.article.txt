resilient."
A calm, cool voice floats over the air,

highly reminiscent of one car drivers
might tune in to while trapped in an
early morning traffic jam. In this case it
is the voice of Jonah Willihnganz, direc
tor of the Stanford Storytelling Project,
as he opens the project's latest episode
on Stanford's radio station, KZSU. He
uses the example of geologist Alfred
Wegner, who doggedly defended the
concept of continental drift to a skepti
cal audience in the early 1900s, to intro
duce the week's topic: resilience.

Five different stories, written and
read by Stanford students and affiliates,
all dealing with the topic of resilience,
follow this introduction. The stories are
dramatically varied, accounts ranging
from the resilience required to work
for the Stanford Calling Center to the
resilience one individual called upon
while attending Burning Man, an arts
event in the Nevada desert.
