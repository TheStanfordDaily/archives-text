A calm, cool voice floats over the air,

highly reminiscent of one car drivers
might tune in to while trapped in an
early morning traffic jam. In this case it
is the voice of Jonah Willihnganz, direc
tor of the Stanford Storytelling Project,
as he opens the project's latest episode
on Stanford's radio station, KZSU. He
uses the example of geologist Alfred
Wegner, who doggedly defended the
concept of continental drift to a skepti
cal audience in the early 1900s, to intro
duce the week's topic: resilience.

Five different stories, written and
read by Stanford students and affiliates,
all dealing with the topic of resilience,
follow this introduction. The stories are
dramatically varied, accounts ranging
from the resilience required to work
for the Stanford Calling Center to the
resilience one individual called upon
while attending Burning Man, an arts
event in the Nevada desert.

The winners of the Stanford Storytelling Project's 2011 Fall Contest, Jacob Kovacs-Goodman, Jennifer Schaeffer and Molly
Kieran, receive their awards for outstanding creative writing. The theme for this contest was "What I Should Have Said."
"[A theme] can mean any
thing," said Dana Kletter, Stegn
er fellow and fiction editor of the
Storytelling Project. "People
start making these associations..
.. Have they heard a story that
might fit into this category, or
might fit in with this theme?"
The radio component of the
project experiments with the
ability of a "dismembered" voice
to convey a story, and according
to Willihnganz, parallels the
alienated nature of the modern
state of life.
"In the early 20th century the
voices were able to become com
pletely disconnected," Willihn
ganz said. "You could hear some
body's consciousness, richly,
without their being present. . .
The physical reality could be
come divorced from an essence."
Aside from these existentially
challenging traits, the medium of
radio also provides listeners with
an auditory experience that is
less detached than writing and
less passive than television.
"I really like audio because I
feel like it impacts us more emo
tionally than writing would, be
cause it's auditory and we re
spond to the sound of other hu
mans speaking, but it still leaves
room for the imagination," said
Hannah Kopp-Yates 'l2, a con
tributor to the Storytelling Proj
ect.
Though the KZSU show is
perhaps the most well-known
component of the Stanford Sto
rytelling Project, it is only one
segment. Founded in 2007, the
Stanford Storytelling Project was
created by Willinhganz, who was
a fellow with the Stanford Hu
manities Fund at the time. Real
izing the public impact of pro
grams such as NPR's "This
American Life," Willihnganz re
ceived funding through the
Hume Writing Center and the
Continuing Studies Program and
began to teach classes. In these
classes, students focused on writ
ing their own memoirs and on
collecting stories from around
campus. Soon however, the
"story collecting" expanded be
yond the courses.
In essence, the Storytelling
Project strives to teach people to
be effective storytellers while si
multaneously capturing the

many stories present in the Stan
ford community.
"It's really a lot like ethnogra
phy, which I'm really interested
in, and what we're all really inter
ested in," Kletter said. "That's
how we investigate other cul
tures, using these kind of ethno
graphic methods and field notes,
so why not examine ourselves
that way?"
Much of the Storytelling Proj
ect involves collaboration with
other University programs. On
Friday afternoons, members of
the Storytelling Project join with
oral communication tutors from
the Oral Communication Center
for a storytelling workshop. The
members serve as mentors to stu
dents who have a story to tell,
helping them with performance
and rhetorical techniques.
"[The Storytelling Project's]
purpose was not only to allow
students to create these things, to
help push them through the
process, but to also bring the
campus more storytelling," Willi
hnganz said.
Additionally, the Storytelling
Project has been working on im
plementing a program called
"Big Shorts" at the CoHo, which
brings in famous storytellers of
all kinds on Tuesday nights, from
radio show hosts to poets. There
has also been a recent upsurge in
collaboration with the Stanford
Medical School, particularly be
cause of the on-campus presence
of writer-doctor Abraham
Verghese. Verghese came to
Stanford as a tenured professor
in 2007 and currently holds the
position of Professor for the The
ory and Practice of Medicine at
the Stanford Universtiy School
of Medicine and Senior Associ
ate Chair of the Department of
Internal Medicine.
"There's actually a lot of writ
ers who were doctors," Kletter
said. "Maybe it's the fact that
they interact with patients,
maybe because you take a pa
tient's history, and there's a bi
narrative there. Behind the num
bers there is always a human
story."
Students can get involved
with the Storytelling Project as
staff members or as collabora
tors, a position that pays $lOO for
each story contributed. Kopp-
Yates first became involved with
the Storytelling Project while
studying abroad in Paris. Re
sponding affirmatively to an
email asking students to record
their adventures abroad, she re

ceived a microphone in the mail
and was charged with the task of
finding interesting personal nar
ratives in the City of Lights. Sto
ries she found included that of
two Stanford girls wooed by
three French men at the Eiffel
Tower on New Year's Eve and
that of a non-French-speaker
traveling to southern France to
learn a traditional French game.
As a human biology major fo
cusing on human-environmental
interactions, Kopp-Yates said she
believes narratives have great
potential to enact social change.
"I think that narrative is real
ly important in creating global
transformation," Kopp-Yates
said. "One of the reasons that
there's so much alienation and
disenfranchisement and discon
nection from the natural world is
because at least in America we
don't really know how to place
ourselves in it anymore."

"There's actually a lot of writ
ers who were doctors," Kletter
said. "Maybe it's the fact that
they interact with patients,
maybe because you take a pa
tient's history, and there's a bi
narrative there. Behind the num
bers there is always a human
story."

Yates first became involved with
the Storytelling Project while
studying abroad in Paris. Re
sponding affirmatively to an
email asking students to record
their adventures abroad, she re

ceived a microphone in the mail
and was charged with the task of
finding interesting personal nar
ratives in the City of Lights. Sto
ries she found included that of
two Stanford girls wooed by
three French men at the Eiffel
Tower on New Year's Eve and
that of a non-French-speaker
traveling to southern France to
learn a traditional French game.
As a human biology major fo
cusing on human-environmental
interactions, Kopp-Yates said she
believes narratives have great
potential to enact social change.
"I think that narrative is real
ly important in creating global
transformation," Kopp-Yates
said. "One of the reasons that
there's so much alienation and
disenfranchisement and discon
nection from the natural world is
because at least in America we
don't really know how to place
ourselves in it anymore."

A calm, cool voice floats over the air,

highly reminiscent of one car drivers

early morning traffic jam. In this case it
is the voice of Jonah Willihnganz, direc
tor of the Stanford Storytelling Project,
as he opens the project's latest episode
on Stanford's radio station, KZSU. He
uses the example of geologist Alfred
Wegner, who doggedly defended the
concept of continental drift to a skepti
cal audience in the early 1900s, to intro
duce the week's topic: resilience.

Five different stories, written and
read by Stanford students and affiliates,
all dealing with the topic of resilience,
follow this introduction. The stories are
dramatically varied, accounts ranging
from the resilience required to work
for the Stanford Calling Center to the
resilience one individual called upon
while attending Burning Man, an arts

The winners of the Stanford Storytelling Project's 2011 Fall Contest, Jacob Kovacs-Goodman, Jennifer Schaeffer and Molly
Kieran, receive their awards for outstanding creative writing. The theme for this contest was "What I Should Have Said."
"[A theme] can mean any
thing," said Dana Kletter, Stegn
er fellow and fiction editor of the
Storytelling Project. "People
start making these associations..
.. Have they heard a story that
might fit into this category, or
might fit in with this theme?"
The radio component of the
project experiments with the
ability of a "dismembered" voice
to convey a story, and according
to Willihnganz, parallels the
alienated nature of the modern
state of life.
"In the early 20th century the
voices were able to become com
pletely disconnected," Willihn
ganz said. "You could hear some
body's consciousness, richly,
without their being present. . .
The physical reality could be
come divorced from an essence."
Aside from these existentially
challenging traits, the medium of
radio also provides listeners with
an auditory experience that is
less detached than writing and
less passive than television.
"I really like audio because I
feel like it impacts us more emo
tionally than writing would, be
cause it's auditory and we re
spond to the sound of other hu
mans speaking, but it still leaves
room for the imagination," said
Hannah Kopp-Yates 'l2, a con
tributor to the Storytelling Proj
ect.
Though the KZSU show is
perhaps the most well-known
component of the Stanford Sto
rytelling Project, it is only one
segment. Founded in 2007, the
Stanford Storytelling Project was
created by Willinhganz, who was
a fellow with the Stanford Hu
manities Fund at the time. Real
izing the public impact of pro
grams such as NPR's "This
American Life," Willihnganz re
ceived funding through the
Hume Writing Center and the
Continuing Studies Program and
began to teach classes. In these
classes, students focused on writ
ing their own memoirs and on
collecting stories from around
campus. Soon however, the
"story collecting" expanded be
yond the courses.
In essence, the Storytelling
Project strives to teach people to
be effective storytellers while si
multaneously capturing the

many stories present in the Stan
ford community.
"It's really a lot like ethnogra
phy, which I'm really interested
in, and what we're all really inter
ested in," Kletter said. "That's
how we investigate other cul
tures, using these kind of ethno
graphic methods and field notes,
so why not examine ourselves
that way?"
Much of the Storytelling Proj
ect involves collaboration with
other University programs. On
Friday afternoons, members of
the Storytelling Project join with
oral communication tutors from
the Oral Communication Center
for a storytelling workshop. The
members serve as mentors to stu
dents who have a story to tell,
helping them with performance
and rhetorical techniques.
"[The Storytelling Project's]
purpose was not only to allow
students to create these things, to
help push them through the
process, but to also bring the
campus more storytelling," Willi
hnganz said.
Additionally, the Storytelling
Project has been working on im
plementing a program called
"Big Shorts" at the CoHo, which
brings in famous storytellers of
all kinds on Tuesday nights, from
radio show hosts to poets. There
has also been a recent upsurge in
collaboration with the Stanford
Medical School, particularly be
cause of the on-campus presence
of writer-doctor Abraham
Verghese. Verghese came to
Stanford as a tenured professor
in 2007 and currently holds the
position of Professor for the The
ory and Practice of Medicine at
the Stanford Universtiy School

ate Chair of the Department of
