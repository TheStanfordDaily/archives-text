# REMEMBERING THE UCA MASSACRE
## 
### â€“ Erika Alvero Koski 
The lobby of the museum of the
University of Central Ameri
ca (UCA) in San Salvador, El
Salvador, did not look very
different from any historical
site I had visited through my years of
class field trips and family outings. My
group, which consisted of students in the
religious studies class Issues in Libera
tion Theology and members of the Stan
ford Catholic Community, was clustered
together in a large, cheerful room with an
arched ceiling and palm trees peeking
through open windows. Introductory
screens were arranged artistically in the
center of the lobby so as to create a sort
of labyrinth, forcing visitors to educate
themselves before they can reach the gift
shop in the corner selling stickers, pens
and rosaries.
Beyond the gift shop, however, was an
ugly history that quietly reverberated in
the walls of the building. The introducto
ry screens themselves were pasted with
sheets of paper commemorating Sal
vadorans who were killed in the conflict
between government and guerilla forces
that ravaged the country in the 'Bos. The
true gravity of the situation revealed it
self more fully in the next room.
A central glass case displayed the

clothes that had covered the six Jesuit
priests who were killed at the UCA in
1989. Proponents of the philosophy of lib
eration theology, a new arm of the Jesuit
church that sought to liberate the impov
erished and minority indigenous peoples
from the repression of the government
and the violence of its military "death
squads," these six priests were seen as a
threat to the government and were elimi
nated on the morning of Nov. 16,1989.
The blue polo of Ignacio Baro was ripped
with bullet holes, as was the brown, tat
tered robe of Ignacio Ellacurfa.
In a separate case, a dictionary was
splayed open to the f-section, severed
cleanly by a line of machine gun fire. The
glass frame of a painting of Oscar
Romero, another Jesuit priest who was
assassinated nine years earlier, had been
shattered by a flamethrower, but the
painting itself remained intact, a fact con
sidered a miracle by some.
Leaving the museum, we lingered in
the UCA chapel for talks by our leaders.
The tenet of liberation theology advocat
ing for social justice through religion was
apparent in the chapel itself. The stations
of the cross, a prominent part of Catholic
churches, graced the back wall. Each sta
tion depicted a brutality suffered by Sal
vadoran civilians at the hands of the gov
ernment a reflection of the Salvado
ran reality that continues to affect the
country to this day.

The artwork in the UCA chapel combines typical Catholic Church embellishments with the reality of the Salvadoran people's situation. The
stations of the cross (above) is a prominent component of many Catholic churches and church services, depicting the various trials of Jesus.
The UCA chapel adapted its version of the stations of the cross in order to portray the suffering during the civil war of the 1980s.
