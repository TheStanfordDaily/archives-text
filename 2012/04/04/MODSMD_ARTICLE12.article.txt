## EDITORIAL The 						perils of happiness at Stanford 
### 
Spring quarter heralds the be
ginning of sunny weather,
blue skies and warm days
spent outside. It should be a love
ly time, a welcome liberation
from the stormy weather and
generally heavier workloads of
winter quarter. However, the first
few weeks of spring quarter also
contain some of the most socially
stressful times that many Stan
ford undergraduates especial
ly freshmen will face: fraterni
ty and sorority rush and the annu
al housing Draw.
Neither event is inherently
stressful. Greek rush events
should be enjoyable events dur
ing the less-busy first few weeks
of the quarter: A bid offer or lack
thereof hardly qualifies as a de
termination of a student's charac
ter. And the housing Draw ought
to be merely a luck-based system
for allocating housing space in an
egalitarian manner: Plenty of stu
dents will inevitably receive less
than-desirable housing, but a stu
dent's domicile and Draw group
are far from the ultimate factor
for the student's social life for the
coming year.
Yet rush and the Draw can
cause a great deal of emotional
stress. Students who do not re
ceive bids from their desired fra
ternity or sorority may feel per
sonally spurned and socially cast
aside, left to fend for themselves
without an organized social
group. Partitioning diverse and
amorphous friend networks into
eight-member-maximum groups
is incredibly challenging. It is im
possible to satisfy everyone in the
creation of Draw groups, and the
common practice of group Draw
ing ostensibly populates upper
class residences with pre-formed
friend groups, a fact which under
standably causes anxiety for solo
Drawers.
So why do Stanford students
experience so much stress over
these two processes? This stress is
a manifestation of the dreaded
"duck syndrome," the feeling of
struggling alone in a university
full of apparently happy and re
laxed students, all of whom are
struggling themselves.
The phrase "duck syndrome"
is likely familiar to most Stanford
undergraduates. Efforts are
made to introduce the concept to
freshmen at New Student Orien
tation (NSO), and every so often
the duck syndrome inevitably ap
pears on bathroom flyers. How
ever, the Editorial Board believes

the duck syndrome is a very im
portant student mental health
issue, and we wish to confront the
issue head-on.
To illustrate the duck syn
drome, we publish the following
excerpt from an email written by
an anonymous Stanford student
to Angelina Cardona 'll, during
her time as 2010-11 ASSU Presi
dent: "I think I can be fun some
times, and I sure know a lot of
people, but I don't have any real
friends... I want someone to feel
comfortable enough around me,
or to think that I'm fun enough,
that they don't feel weird about
randomly getting in touch... I
feel socially awkward and out-of
place and community-less."
The sentiments in this email
resonate strongly. Looking
around, most everyone looks in
credibly productive, seems sur
rounded by friends, and ultimate
ly appears to be fundamentally
happy. This aura of good cheer is
contagious. Many of us catch it in
the camp-like atmosphere of
admit weekend or NSO, and we
retain it because everybody else
seems so happy. Yet this conta
gious happiness has its dark side:
Feeling dejected or unhappy in a
place like Stanford causes one to
feel abnormal and out-of-place,
so we may tend to internalize and
brood over this lack of happiness
instead of productively address
ing the situation.
To minimize this effect, the
Editorial Board encourages the
administration to more thor
oughly address the fact that up
beat events during admit week
end and NSO can eventually lead
to some students feeling even
more isolated than normal. In ad
dition, we beseech students to
take care of themselves emotion
ally. It is normal indeed,
healthy to be sad, angry, frus
trated, or confused. Rather than
futilely suppressing these natural
feelings to maintain the facade of
happiness, express these emo
tions. Find a friend (this friend
doesn't necessarily need to be a
close one a housemate, dorm
neighbor or staff member who
listens will do) and share your ex
periences. Have a good cry.
Maybe call up a parental figure or
the Bridge to have a good rant.
Do not, however, resent these
natural emotions and attempt to
bury them with fake happiness.
Doing so is isolating and leads
only to further stress. Take care of
yourself!

stressful times that many Stan
ford undergraduates especial
ly freshmen will face: fraterni
ty and sorority rush and the annu
al housing Draw.
Neither event is inherently
stressful. Greek rush events
should be enjoyable events dur
ing the less-busy first few weeks
of the quarter: A bid offer or lack
thereof hardly qualifies as a de
termination of a student's charac
ter. And the housing Draw ought
to be merely a luck-based system
for allocating housing space in an
egalitarian manner: Plenty of stu
dents will inevitably receive less
than-desirable housing, but a stu
dent's domicile and Draw group
are far from the ultimate factor
for the student's social life for the
coming year.
Yet rush and the Draw can
cause a great deal of emotional
stress. Students who do not re
ceive bids from their desired fra
ternity or sorority may feel per
sonally spurned and socially cast
aside, left to fend for themselves
without an organized social
group. Partitioning diverse and
amorphous friend networks into
eight-member-maximum groups
is incredibly challenging. It is im
possible to satisfy everyone in the
creation of Draw groups, and the
common practice of group Draw
ing ostensibly populates upper
class residences with pre-formed
friend groups, a fact which under
standably causes anxiety for solo
Drawers.
So why do Stanford students
experience so much stress over
these two processes? This stress is
a manifestation of the dreaded
"duck syndrome," the feeling of
struggling alone in a university
full of apparently happy and re
laxed students, all of whom are
struggling themselves.
The phrase "duck syndrome"
is likely familiar to most Stanford
undergraduates. Efforts are
made to introduce the concept to
freshmen at New Student Orien
tation (NSO), and every so often
the duck syndrome inevitably ap
pears on bathroom flyers. How
ever, the Editorial Board believes

the duck syndrome is a very im
portant student mental health
issue, and we wish to confront the
issue head-on.
To illustrate the duck syn
drome, we publish the following
excerpt from an email written by
an anonymous Stanford student
to Angelina Cardona 'll, during
her time as 2010-11 ASSU Presi
dent: "I think I can be fun some
times, and I sure know a lot of
people, but I don't have any real
friends... I want someone to feel
comfortable enough around me,
or to think that I'm fun enough,
that they don't feel weird about
randomly getting in touch... I
feel socially awkward and out-of
place and community-less."
The sentiments in this email
resonate strongly. Looking
around, most everyone looks in
credibly productive, seems sur
rounded by friends, and ultimate
ly appears to be fundamentally
happy. This aura of good cheer is
contagious. Many of us catch it in
the camp-like atmosphere of
admit weekend or NSO, and we
retain it because everybody else
seems so happy. Yet this conta
gious happiness has its dark side:
Feeling dejected or unhappy in a
place like Stanford causes one to
feel abnormal and out-of-place,
so we may tend to internalize and
brood over this lack of happiness
instead of productively address
ing the situation.
To minimize this effect, the
Editorial Board encourages the
administration to more thor
oughly address the fact that up
beat events during admit week
end and NSO can eventually lead
to some students feeling even
more isolated than normal. In ad
dition, we beseech students to
take care of themselves emotion
ally. It is normal indeed,
healthy to be sad, angry, frus
trated, or confused. Rather than
futilely suppressing these natural
feelings to maintain the facade of
happiness, express these emo
tions. Find a friend (this friend
doesn't necessarily need to be a
close one a housemate, dorm
neighbor or staff member who
listens will do) and share your ex
periences. Have a good cry.
Maybe call up a parental figure or
the Bridge to have a good rant.
Do not, however, resent these
natural emotions and attempt to
bury them with fake happiness.
Doing so is isolating and leads
only to further stress. Take care of
yourself!

Spring quarter heralds the be
ginning of sunny weather,
blue skies and warm days
spent outside. It should be a love
ly time, a welcome liberation
from the stormy weather and
generally heavier workloads of
winter quarter. However, the first
few weeks of spring quarter also
contain some of the most socially
stressful times that many Stan
ford undergraduates especial

ty and sorority rush and the annu
