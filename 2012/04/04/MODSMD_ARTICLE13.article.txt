# BURSTING THE BUBBLE
## Slowing down to talk to each other 
### Edward Ngai 
We know Stanford stu
dents are busy. We hear
it all the time. It's this
campus's number one excuse.
Hell, we live it every day.
Only a few things can stop this
campus in its tracks, stopping
each and every one of us, busy
and stressed in our own unique
way, if for only a few moments.
One of these things is the sud
den loss of a loved one. In this re
spect, the Stanford community is
still trying to get its legs back un
derneath it; trying to reanimate
after a shocking, if brief paralysis.
Stanford, as a whole, will surely
move on, though some will mourn
longer and take more time to ad
just to life without one of our
own.
But few of us will look in the
mirror and ask ourselves how this
could happen on our watch.
Stanford students are busy.
That's why we're one of the best
and most desirable schools in the
world. It's also why we have our
own sociological condition

named after us. We're all ducks on
this farm, paddling furiously for
dear life.
If only I could count the num
ber of times I hear the exchange,
"What's up?" "Not too much," in
my freshman dorm. I'm guilty of
it too. I ask too many people how
they are without caring for their
answer. Sometimes visibly dis
turbed or stressed people tell me
they don't have much going on. I
don't believe them.

But whether you do or not, I
know I've got lots happening, and
I don't have time to sit down with
you and talk through your issues.
They're probably too complicat
ed. Too personal. You'll think I'm
nosy. So I say, "Cool, see you

around." And as quickly as we
stumbled upon each other, we
paddle away.
What a shame it is that this ex
change happens every day in a
freshman dorm that prides itself
on its community based on gen
uine love for each other.
At a Crossing the Line event
some months ago, our dorm com
munity made a commitment to
replace these stairwell chitchats
with honest sit-downs to
earnestly try to get to know one
another and to create an environ
ment where no one is afraid to
talk about their hopes and fears.
But then Stanford took over,
and its breakneck pace, driven
students and addiction to excel
lence consumed most of us. It's
what makes us the best in the
world. But it also lends itself to
our being too busy to get to know
those who don't happen to be in
our classes or in our crisscrossing
circles of friends.

It strikes me how I know noth
ing about many of my friends at
Stanford. I complain about early
mornings with them, laugh at
lunch with them and stay up late
working on problem sets with
them. But I don't know what they
love, who they strive to be or what
they are most challenged by. I cer
tainly do not know the challenges
they may face every day.
Some will undoubtedly shy
away from outreach. Some just
aren't in the mood to talk about
it, or aren't in the mood to talk
about it with you. But we never

know when one is on the brink,
and we never know whether the
tiny reassurances we give them
are enough to make a difference.
A good conversation makes
us feel cared about and loved, ft
tells us that we're not alone in our
struggles. It can nourish the soul
in ways success and constant
achievement cannot.
So perhaps it is incumbent on
all of us to take more time to sit
back and feed the ducks —in
soul if not in body. As blithe as we
look on the surface, one can
never know how desperately we
are paddling underneath.
