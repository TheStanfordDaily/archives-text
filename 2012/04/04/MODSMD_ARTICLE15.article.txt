# HALF-INVENTED
## The 						great divorce 
### Chase Ishii 
I love breaks from school, don't
get me wrong. I love the beach,
spending time with family and
friends and getting to peacefully
sleep late without the guilt of hav
ing missed morning classes ... or
afternoon classes. But after a cou
ple of days, there's something
about being away from school
that makes me go stir-crazy.
Now before Stanford copy
pastes that statement and slaps it
onto the cover of some recruiting
pamphlet, I should clarify: There
is something about being home
for a week or two that doesn't feel
like real life. It makes me restless.
It feels like a waiting room. Sure,
it's a really fun waiting room filled
with people I love, the television
isn't permanently stuck on the
local news and it doesn't smell like
old people, but it's a waiting room
nonetheless. It's as if none of my
actions have real consequences.
The way I spend my day, whether
positive or negative, has no lasting
impact upon my normal college

life at Stanford. I can't get ahead.
I can't get behind. All I can do is
wait.
This spring break, I finally got
around to reading "The Great Di
vorce" by C. S. Lewis. The story
describes a man that takes a bus
ride from Hell to Heaven, but in
this story Heaven is an extremely
vivid and dense reality where the
man appears only as a shadowy
phantom, and Hell is a sad, mun
dane neighborhood known as The
Grey Town. I pictured it as
Boston, probably because base
ball season is less than a week
away and I despise the Red Sox.
It's a novel that I highly recom
mend. And while it is in no way a
central theme, it speaks to the life
is-a-waiting-room feeling where
actions appear to have little effect
on "real life."
I often lull myself into the no
tion that my actions primarily af
fect others. If I give money to a
homeless man, he gets to eat. If I
don't let that lady in the Prius
merge in front of me on the free
way, she gets angry. But Lewis sug
gests the opposite: that we are the
primary beneficiary and victims of
our own choices. Sure, when I give
a homeless man money, he gets
food, but more importantly, I be
come a person who values the
needs of others ahead of myself.
And when I don't let that Prius in
ahead of me on the 101, /become
a person who values my time over
others.
In every action and decision, no
matter how inconsequential, we
are constantly choosing who we
are becoming. I've heard it said
that, "Your future is an amplifica
tion of your present," and our
present is right now. There are
people with dreams of helping the
poor who are waiting until they've
made their personal fortune so
they can give out of excess. But in
constantly choosing wealth over
charity, one may slowly, and al
most unnoticeably, become a per
son who values his or her comfort
over the needs of others to such an
extent that he or she no longer
considers the poor when they have
wealth. Others are working them
selves to death so they can one day
finally relax and be satisfied. But
in continuously choosing work
and stress over joy and rest, it is
very possible they may slowly be
come a person who is no longer
able to be content and satisfied. As
Lewis puts it,"First they will not, in

the end they cannot." Every mo
ment is eternally significant.
I have a friend from high
school who was a very close friend
for a good year or so. Then for
some valid reasons and some stu
pid reasons for which we were
both responsible, we stopped
being close friends. And as of now,
we've basically stopped talking al
together. Enough time has passed
that it doesn't bother me like it
used to, but I know I need to apol
ogize and ask for forgiveness.
This choice in no way affects
my future. It's not motivated by
blame or guilt or a search for clo
sure; I'm pretty content with
where I'm at right now. It's not to
make things right for the sake of a
future friendship; without effort
and intention, I could easily never
see this person again, that's just
the way life is. But by letting
things go to avoid uncomfortable
confrontation, I am choosing to
become a person who values
pride and stubbornness over for
giveness and reconciliation. And
that is a step down a road I do not
want to take.
Who we are in the future is
constantly decided by the choices
we make right now.

For some absurd reason, Chase is
an Angels fan. Help him get over his
horrible taste in baseball teams at
ninjaish@stanford.edu.

In every action and decision, no

are constantly choosing who we
are becoming. I've heard it said
that, "Your future is an amplifica

present is right now. There are
people with dreams of helping the
poor who are waiting until they've
made their personal fortune so
they can give out of excess. But in
constantly choosing wealth over
charity, one may slowly, and al
most unnoticeably, become a per
son who values his or her comfort
over the needs of others to such an
extent that he or she no longer
considers the poor when they have
wealth. Others are working them
selves to death so they can one day
finally relax and be satisfied. But
in continuously choosing work
and stress over joy and rest, it is
very possible they may slowly be
come a person who is no longer
able to be content and satisfied. As
Lewis puts it,"First they will not, in

I have a friend from high
school who was a very close friend
for a good year or so. Then for
some valid reasons and some stu
pid reasons for which we were
both responsible, we stopped
being close friends. And as of now,
we've basically stopped talking al
together. Enough time has passed
that it doesn't bother me like it
used to, but I know I need to apol
ogize and ask for forgiveness.
This choice in no way affects
my future. It's not motivated by
blame or guilt or a search for clo
sure; I'm pretty content with
where I'm at right now. It's not to
make things right for the sake of a
future friendship; without effort
and intention, I could easily never
see this person again, that's just
the way life is. But by letting
things go to avoid uncomfortable
confrontation, I am choosing to
become a person who values
pride and stubbornness over for
giveness and reconciliation. And
that is a step down a road I do not
want to take.
Who we are in the future is
constantly decided by the choices
we make right now.

I love breaks from school, don't
get me wrong. I love the beach,
spending time with family and
friends and getting to peacefully
sleep late without the guilt of hav
ing missed morning classes ... or
afternoon classes. But after a cou
ple of days, there's something
about being away from school
that makes me go stir-crazy.
Now before Stanford copy
pastes that statement and slaps it
onto the cover of some recruiting
pamphlet, I should clarify: There
is something about being home
for a week or two that doesn't feel
like real life. It makes me restless.
It feels like a waiting room. Sure,
it's a really fun waiting room filled
with people I love, the television
isn't permanently stuck on the
local news and it doesn't smell like
old people, but it's a waiting room
nonetheless. It's as if none of my
actions have real consequences.
The way I spend my day, whether
positive or negative, has no lasting
impact upon my normal college

life at Stanford. I can't get ahead.
I can't get behind. All I can do is
wait.
This spring break, I finally got
around to reading "The Great Di
vorce" by C. S. Lewis. The story
describes a man that takes a bus
ride from Hell to Heaven, but in
this story Heaven is an extremely
vivid and dense reality where the
man appears only as a shadowy
phantom, and Hell is a sad, mun
dane neighborhood known as The
Grey Town. I pictured it as
Boston, probably because base
ball season is less than a week
away and I despise the Red Sox.
It's a novel that I highly recom
mend. And while it is in no way a
central theme, it speaks to the life
is-a-waiting-room feeling where
actions appear to have little effect
on "real life."
I often lull myself into the no
tion that my actions primarily af
fect others. If I give money to a
homeless man, he gets to eat. If I
don't let that lady in the Prius
merge in front of me on the free
way, she gets angry. But Lewis sug
gests the opposite: that we are the
primary beneficiary and victims of
our own choices. Sure, when I give
a homeless man money, he gets
food, but more importantly, I be
come a person who values the
needs of others ahead of myself.
