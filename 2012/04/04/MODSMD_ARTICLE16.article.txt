## HOME COOKING STANFORD TAKES THIRD AT U.S. INTERCOLLEGIATE 
### AUSTIN BLOCK STAFF WRITER 
Hosting the U.S. Intercollegiate at the
Stanford Golf Course last weekend, the
Stanford men's golf team ranked No. 8 in
Golfweek's national rankings was un
able to recover from an early deficit, ulti
mately taking third at the tournament with
a score of 849. No. 7 Oregon jumped out to
a five-shot lead with a first round team score
of -8 and was able to hold on for a one
stroke team victory a 54-hole score of
841 (+1) over the No. 4 Southern Califor
nia.

Stanford freshman Patrick Rodgers, the
No. 4 collegiate golfer in the nation, shot 68-
67 to take a two-stroke lead into the last
round, but a final round 75 dropped him to
a tie for fifth place at even par. Senior An
drew Yun vaulted up the leaderboard on the
final day, shooting a 68 to tie for 10th at +2,
and senior captain David Chung also fin
ished strong, shooting a final round 69 to tie
for 14th at four over par. As a team, the Car
dinal finished eight shots behind Oregon at
+9.

"We had our chances but the lead that we
gave the [Oregon] Ducks was just too tough
to overcome," head coach Conrad Ray said.
"I feel like we can take a lot of positives
out of [the tournament]" Yun said. "Obvi
ously we didn't get the win like we wanted
to, but I think we played well, especially
coming down the stretch."

Senior captain Wilson Bowen said the
Cardinal was hurt by a stroke of bad luck:
On the second day of play, players had to
fight through rain and high winds before
flooding greens forced a rain delay.

"We had bad luck with the draw on the
second day because we ended up going off
early, and the greens were really hard at the
beginning of the round and it was very
windy," Bowen said. "Oregon and USC did
n't have to play through that. But I think our
guys did a great job of grinding it out despite
the conditions and posting good numbers."
Although players were disappointed that
the team was unable to pull out a win at

and Andrew Yun, who finished fifth and 10th, respectively. Stanford finished third as a team.
home, the Stanford "B" team im
pressed, finishing in a tie for sixth
out of 17 total teams and tying
the "A" team in the first round
with a team score of +4. The "B"
team was led by freshmen Patrick
Grimes and Marcel Puyat, who
finished the tournament at +5
and +6, respectively. Coming
back from injury, Bowen was the
team's third lowest scorer, shoot
ing an even par 70 on the final
day and finishing at seven over.
"Our *B' team this week
showed how good they can be, es
pecially with the first round that
they posted," Yun said. "They fin
ished sixth with that good of a
field, so it just speaks to our
depth [as a team]."
The U.S. Intercollegiate was
the Cardinal's second-to-last
tournament before the Pac-12
Championships. In two weeks,
the team travels to the famous,
and difficult, Pasatiempo course
in Santa Cruz, designed by Au
gusta National Golf Club design
er Alister Mackenzie, for its final
tournament of the season.
"It's a course which has very
undulating greens, and they're
going to be very fast, so there's
going to be an emphasis on lag
putting and short game," Bowen
said. "It's also going to be windy
so you're going to need to be able
to hit the ball low and control
your golf ball off the tee and into
the greens."
"We played [Pasatiempo] last
year and we finished 11th so it
was a bit disappointing. But we
obviously have the experience,
which is a good thing, and so I
think a lot of the guys are prepar
ing for the greens," Yun added. "I
think we have one of the best
short games in the country, so if
we just get that clicking then I
think we're going to have a really
good tournament."

Following the Western Colle
giate at Pasatiempo, the team will
journey to Corvallis, Ore., at the
end of April for the Pac-12
Championships. The Cardinal
has not won the highly competi
tive conference since 1994. As of
April 1, the Pac-12 boasted six of
the top-10 teams in the nation, in
cluding No. 4 UCLA.
No members of the Stanford
team have played the course in
Corvallis, but Bowen and Yun
aren't too concerned about the
team's lack of experience there.
NCAA regional playoffs, held at
the Stanford course, start on May
17, and Bowen felt this week's ex
perience of playing the Stanford
course in tournament conditions
would be helpful for the Cardinal.
"The course plays a lot differ
ently in competition than it does
[normally] because the rough is a
lot longer and the greens are real
ly fast, so there's some different
strategy that comes into play,"
Bowen said. "Any time you get to
play at a tournament on a course
where you'll play a tournament
again later, you're always going
to learn how the course plays dif
ferently, how to best approach it
and what holds up under pres
sure, which is very important, es
pecially coming down the stretch
at regionals."
Yun said the team is building
momentum, citing the team's
third place finish this weekend
and its fifth place finish at the
highly competitive Southern
Highlands Masters in March,
where the Cardinal beat out top
ranked Texas.
"I think we're peaking at the
right time. A lot of the guys had
really good finishes this week,"
Yun said. "I think it's just a mat
ter of time before we're all play
ing well at the same time. ...
Right now, we have like two or
three guys playing really well, but
it's just a matter of time before
we have all five guys clicking."
