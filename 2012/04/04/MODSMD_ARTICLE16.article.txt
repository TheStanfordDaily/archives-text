### AUSTIN BLOCK STAFF WRITER 
Hosting the U.S. Intercollegiate at the
Stanford Golf Course last weekend, the
Stanford men's golf team ranked No. 8 in
Golfweek's national rankings was un
able to recover from an early deficit, ulti
mately taking third at the tournament with
a score of 849. No. 7 Oregon jumped out to
a five-shot lead with a first round team score
of -8 and was able to hold on for a one
stroke team victory a 54-hole score of
841 (+1) over the No. 4 Southern Califor
nia.

Stanford freshman Patrick Rodgers, the
No. 4 collegiate golfer in the nation, shot 68-
67 to take a two-stroke lead into the last
round, but a final round 75 dropped him to
a tie for fifth place at even par. Senior An
drew Yun vaulted up the leaderboard on the
final day, shooting a 68 to tie for 10th at +2,
and senior captain David Chung also fin
ished strong, shooting a final round 69 to tie
for 14th at four over par. As a team, the Car
dinal finished eight shots behind Oregon at
+9.

"We had our chances but the lead that we
gave the [Oregon] Ducks was just too tough
to overcome," head coach Conrad Ray said.
"I feel like we can take a lot of positives
out of [the tournament]" Yun said. "Obvi
ously we didn't get the win like we wanted
to, but I think we played well, especially
coming down the stretch."

Senior captain Wilson Bowen said the
Cardinal was hurt by a stroke of bad luck:
On the second day of play, players had to
fight through rain and high winds before
flooding greens forced a rain delay.

"We had bad luck with the draw on the
second day because we ended up going off
early, and the greens were really hard at the
beginning of the round and it was very
windy," Bowen said. "Oregon and USC did
n't have to play through that. But I think our
guys did a great job of grinding it out despite
the conditions and posting good numbers."
Although players were disappointed that
the team was unable to pull out a win at
