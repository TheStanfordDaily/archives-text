### SARAH MAISEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team
dropped the last two games on its East Coast
trip to finish a grueling nonconference schedule
with a 2-7 record. The team ended its eastern

road trip winless after previously losing to
Brown, falling behind early and failing to find
the back of the net. But despite the losses, the
elite competition may have paid off for the
Card, which routed Fresno State 20-3 on Tues
day night in its first conference matchup of the
season.

The Harvard defense proved to be impene
trable and led the team to a 10-4 victory. How
ever, the final score did not reflect the statistics
of the game both teams won eight draw con
trols, and Stanford actually outshot the Crimson
18-14. The shots simply did not fall for the Card,
and Harvard entered the break with a 5-0 lead
and added two more in the early minutes of the
second period before freshman Hannah Farr fi
nally put the Cardinal on the board. The oppos
ing offense quickly bounced back and scored
three more times to pull ahead 10-1. Stanford
would eventually score three more goals of its
own in the last four minutes of regulation, but
the team never came close to closing the gap.
The Cardinal offense found more of a
rhythm against Albany, but it never retook the
lead after falling behind 5-1 and ultimately lost
11-9. Both senior Emilie Boeri and freshman
Emily Newstrom finished the game with hat
tricks, but it was not enough to overpower the
opposing attack. Three of Boeri's four goals
evened the score at 9-9, but the team was never
able to pull ahead. Albany outshot Stanford 29-
18 and won 13 of 22 draw controls, but sopho
more goalie Lyndsey Munoz's nine saves kept
the game competitive.
The disappointing results will hopefully pro
vide valuable experience for the Cardinal as it
kicks off Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) conference play looking for more suc
cess. The high caliber of opponents both
Harvard and Albany consistently compete
against the nation's top programs will pre
pare the youthful Card to vie for its conference
title.
Additionally, Stanford is still playing without
the talented offensive duo of sophomores Anna
Kim and Rachel Ozer. Kim, who scored eight
goals in only four games, has not played since in
juring herself on the game-winning shot against
James Madison on Feb. 25. However, these in
juries have allowed freshmen to gain experi
ence on the field.
After a frustrating two months, everything
finally appeared to come together for the Car
dinal, as it picked up a win in its first conference
game of the season as well as its first road
win of the year at Fresno State on Tuesday
night. In contrast to its last few losses, it was
Stanford that jumped out to an early lead over
the Bulldogs, scoring the first seven goals en
route to a 20-3 victory. Seniors Anna Boeri and
Catherine Swanson led the way with four goals
apiece, and 11 Stanford players found the back
of the net.
Although the first half of the season has
been disappointing, it is still too early to write
off the team that just a year ago went 16-3. If the
Cardinal wins the remainder of its games, it will
finish with a 9-7 record before the MPSF Tour
nament.
This Saturday, April 7, Stanford will travel
to face Denver in its second conference game
of the season, with first draw at noon.
