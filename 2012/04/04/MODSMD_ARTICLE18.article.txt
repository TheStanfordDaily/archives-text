# NIT win can catalyze Cardinal
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
The NIT is a tournament
begging to be punned.
It's the participation tro
phy for the grass pickers
in the outfield, a second
rate competition for second-rate
teams. It's the ultimate slap in the
face, a reminder that for a single col
lege basketball season, your team
was inferior to schools you've never
even heard of
Elite programs wouldn't be
caught dead with the ugly prom
date. Appearances are rare for the
top tier, and when they occur,
they're justified with humiliating,
"we're in rebuilding mode" excuses.
In a place like Chapel Hill.N. C.,the
year 2009 never happened.
But one man's trash is another
man's treasure, and for the Stanford
men's basketball team your 2012
NIT champions finishing the
season as the 69th best team in the
nation never felt so sweet.
It's hard to not be slightly cynical
about the postseason performance.
Stanford didn't play away from the
Farm until the Final Four in Madi
son Square Garden, and its road to
the championship featured no op
ponent seeded better than fifth. It
was, by nearly any quantitative
measure, the Cardinal's tourna
ment to lose.
There's also the shadow of re
cent history that taps the excitement
brakes after the win. Stanford's con
sistent level of talent, combined with
a now almost-forgotten legacy of the
late 20th century, should never lead
to D-list postseason losses and early
trips home. But it did, and the fluctu
ating showcases of effort and ability
for the first several years of Johnny
Dawkins' coaching career drove a
lot of passionate fans, like me, to dis
tribute copious amounts of irra
tional blame throughout the pro
gram.
So why be optimistic about the
Card's first postseason title since
1991? For starters, we finally got a
glimpse of how head coach Johnny
Dawkins has progressed in his role.
In his fourth year, Dawkins finally
settled on a suitable, predictable
and effective rotation this postsea
son. And how many coaches in the
country would be willing to take a
seldom-used player like Andrew
Zimmermann and thrust him into
their starting lineup during the most
important stretch of the year? Not
many, and even fewer would be able
to properly reconstruct offensive
and defensive schemes to accom
modate such a delayed adjustment.
Zimmermann, along with fellow
seniors Jarrett Mann, Jack Trotter
and Josh Owens, will not be around
for the next campaign, but the con
tinued emergence of the most dy
namic backcourt in the conference,
coupled with a boatload of return
ing and incoming talent, should
more than make up for graduation
attrition. Chasson Randle and
Aaron Bright, the fantastic under
classman guards, dazzled in the NIT
with stellar one-on-one play and
precision shooting. Not since
Brevin Knight has Stanford had a
triple-threat point guard with a
fondness for dribble-drive penetra
tion. Now, the Cardinal has two.
What's most important is the
confidence gained from stringing
together an impressive series of
convincing wins. The Ray Lewis
pregame speech was impressive,
but this group actually needed to
practice what he preached. It did,
and now Stanford has to be consid
ered a favorite heading into next
year's Pac-12. Don't believe me?
Regular season champion
Washington lost in the NIT semifi
nal to the same Minnesota team
that was shellacked by the Cardinal.
Cal, the only conference foe that re
ceived an at-large bid to the NCAA
tournament, put up just 13 points in
the first half of its play-in game loss
to USF. And Colorado, an 11-seed
in this year's dance following their
shocking conference tournament
victory, lost both contests against
Stanford this season by a combined
44 points.
With the loss of key Cal seniors,
the declaration of UW superfrosh
Tony Wroten for the NBA draft and
Colorado's inevitable regression to
the mean, it's impossible to find a
team better prepared for the up
coming season than the Cardinal.

It's a more-than-welcome position
for fans more accustomed to
months of uncertainty and disap
pointment.
I'm not one to blindly donate
my optimism. The NIT was an im
pressive stretch for a group of
young up-and-comers, but the re
sult still has to be taken with a grain
of salt. After all, this same Stanford
team was torched by the outside
shooting of the Illinois State Red
birds.
But for a team that has been
making a series of baby steps, this
was the first leap in quite some
time. With significant positive mo
mentum, Stanford can finally turn
the proverbial corner.
The NIT isn't the Big Dance.
But it's not the size of the trophy
that matters; it's how you use it.

Zach Zimmerman is happy about
the NIT win, but not as happy as
Johnny Daw kins is in the first few
seconds of the Ray Lewis video.

date. Appearances are rare for the
top tier, and when they occur,
they're justified with humiliating,
"we're in rebuilding mode" excuses.
In a place like Chapel Hill.N. C.,the
year 2009 never happened.
But one man's trash is another
man's treasure, and for the Stanford
men's basketball team your 2012
NIT champions finishing the
season as the 69th best team in the
nation never felt so sweet.
It's hard to not be slightly cynical
about the postseason performance.
Stanford didn't play away from the
Farm until the Final Four in Madi
son Square Garden, and its road to
the championship featured no op
ponent seeded better than fifth. It
was, by nearly any quantitative
measure, the Cardinal's tourna
ment to lose.
There's also the shadow of re
cent history that taps the excitement
brakes after the win. Stanford's con
sistent level of talent, combined with
a now almost-forgotten legacy of the
late 20th century, should never lead
to D-list postseason losses and early
trips home. But it did, and the fluctu
ating showcases of effort and ability
for the first several years of Johnny
Dawkins' coaching career drove a
lot of passionate fans, like me, to dis
tribute copious amounts of irra
tional blame throughout the pro
gram.
So why be optimistic about the
Card's first postseason title since
1991? For starters, we finally got a
glimpse of how head coach Johnny
Dawkins has progressed in his role.
In his fourth year, Dawkins finally
settled on a suitable, predictable
and effective rotation this postsea
son. And how many coaches in the
country would be willing to take a
seldom-used player like Andrew
Zimmermann and thrust him into
their starting lineup during the most
important stretch of the year? Not
many, and even fewer would be able
to properly reconstruct offensive
and defensive schemes to accom
modate such a delayed adjustment.
Zimmermann, along with fellow
seniors Jarrett Mann, Jack Trotter
and Josh Owens, will not be around
for the next campaign, but the con
tinued emergence of the most dy
namic backcourt in the conference,
coupled with a boatload of return
ing and incoming talent, should
more than make up for graduation
attrition. Chasson Randle and
Aaron Bright, the fantastic under
classman guards, dazzled in the NIT
with stellar one-on-one play and
precision shooting. Not since
Brevin Knight has Stanford had a
triple-threat point guard with a
fondness for dribble-drive penetra
tion. Now, the Cardinal has two.
What's most important is the
confidence gained from stringing
together an impressive series of
convincing wins. The Ray Lewis
pregame speech was impressive,
but this group actually needed to
practice what he preached. It did,
and now Stanford has to be consid
ered a favorite heading into next
year's Pac-12. Don't believe me?
Regular season champion
Washington lost in the NIT semifi
nal to the same Minnesota team
that was shellacked by the Cardinal.
Cal, the only conference foe that re
ceived an at-large bid to the NCAA
tournament, put up just 13 points in
the first half of its play-in game loss
to USF. And Colorado, an 11-seed
in this year's dance following their
shocking conference tournament
victory, lost both contests against
Stanford this season by a combined
44 points.
With the loss of key Cal seniors,
the declaration of UW superfrosh
Tony Wroten for the NBA draft and
Colorado's inevitable regression to
the mean, it's impossible to find a
team better prepared for the up
coming season than the Cardinal.

It's a more-than-welcome position
for fans more accustomed to
months of uncertainty and disap
pointment.
I'm not one to blindly donate
my optimism. The NIT was an im
pressive stretch for a group of
young up-and-comers, but the re
sult still has to be taken with a grain
of salt. After all, this same Stanford
team was torched by the outside
shooting of the Illinois State Red
birds.
But for a team that has been
making a series of baby steps, this
was the first leap in quite some
time. With significant positive mo
mentum, Stanford can finally turn
the proverbial corner.
The NIT isn't the Big Dance.
But it's not the size of the trophy
that matters; it's how you use it.

Zach Zimmerman is happy about
the NIT win, but not as happy as
Johnny Daw kins is in the first few
seconds of the Ray Lewis video.

The NIT is a tournament
begging to be punned.
It's the participation tro
phy for the grass pickers
in the outfield, a second
rate competition for second-rate
teams. It's the ultimate slap in the
face, a reminder that for a single col
lege basketball season, your team
was inferior to schools you've never
even heard of
