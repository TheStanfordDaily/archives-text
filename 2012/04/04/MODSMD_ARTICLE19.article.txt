# TIGERS TAMED
## NO.5 CARD SWEEPS PACIFIC AT HOME 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
As the Stanford men's volley
ball team heads into the home
stretch of the season, with only
five games remaining, the Cardi
nal picked up a vital win at home
on Tuesday night, sweeping
through conference foe Pacific in

three sets.
The No. 5 Cardinal (16-6,13-5
MPSF) rode an 11-kill perform
ance from senior Brad Lawson to
blow past the No. 13 Tigers, 25-15,
25-19,25-18, and pick up a big win
in conference play.
The game was a critical
matchup for both teams, as the
Cardinal is among five teams that
are vying for the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation (MPSF) reg
ular-season title and the No. 1
seed in the conference tourna
ment, while the Tigers (7-17,4-14)

were just one loss short of the
eighth and final spot for the play
offs before Tuesday's loss.
After a Lawson kill made the
score 7-7 in the first set, the Cardi
nal then caught fire, going on an
18-8 run to close out the first set
and secure a 1-0 match lead.
The second set was more hotly
contested, with the teams trading
points for the entirety of the
game to eventually tie the score
at 19. But when the set got tight,
Stanford responded by pounding
out six consecutive points, includ
ing a service ace from Lawson, to
capture the win.
The second set loss appeared
to deflate the Tigers' hopes in the
third, as the Cardinal took an
early lead and held it the entire
way, never letting Pacific get a
lead and comfortably closing out
the match.
In addition to Lawson's solid
game, sophomore Brian Cook
also contributed 10 kills, and fel
low sophomore Eric Mochalski
continued his hot play of late by
adding seven kills on just nine at
tempts to end up with an impres
sive .667 hitting percentage.
With the essential victory on
Tuesday, the Cardinal now turns
its eyes ahead to the last four
games of the season, which are all
home contests against MPSF
foes. Over the next two weeks,
No. 5 Stanford will take on No. 8
Long Beach State, No. 12 Cal
State-Northridge, UC-Santa Bar
bara and conference leader No. 3
UCLA. Every matchup will di
rectly affect which team is seeded
come conference tournament
time.
The win over Pacific on Tues
day was also Cardinal head coach
John Kosty's 100 th career victory,
making him one of three Stanford
men's volleyball coaches to join
the century club, along with
Ruben Nieves and former U.S. Na
tional Team coach Fred Sturm.
Stanford returns to the court
this Friday against Long Beach
State. The Cardinal and the 49ers
match up at Maples Pavilion at 7
p.m.
