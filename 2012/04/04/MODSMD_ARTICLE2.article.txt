# ResEd debuts substance-free
## Wing on first floor of Mirrielees to host pilot program 
### KURT CHIRBAS MANAGING EDITOR 
Mirrielees will serve as the test site
for a new substance-free undergradu
ate housing option this upcoming fall,
according to Deborah Golder, dean of
Residential Education (ResEd).
Twenty-four upperclassmen will par
ticipate in the pilot program, which
will be held in a first-floor wing of the
apartment residence.
These students, to be selected
through a pre-assignment process, will
make a commitment that they and
their guests will not "be in possession
of, use or be under the influence of"
identified substances while in the resi
dence, according to Res Ed's website.
The barred substances include alco
hol, illicit drugs and cigarettes, while
the misuse of prescription or over-the
counter medication will also be pro
hibited.
The initiative, which Golder re
ferred to as "a big experiment," fol

lows a recommendation from a Uni
versity alcohol policy study group
committee last spring. ResEd made
the final decision to launch the pro
gram for the 2012-13 academic year
just within the last few weeks, pushing
the project forward to meet this Fri
day's student deadline for pre-assign
ing.
"We were going to spend a little bit
more time in the planning stages,"
Golder said. "But I think folks felt,
'Hey, let's go for it. We don't need to
take over a whole house. Let's just try
it. Let's just see.'"
The program utilizes the pre-assign
ment process to ensure students com
mit upfront to making the community
substance-free, Golder said. She added
that the residence would differ from
other themed-housing options in that it
would have minimal special program
ming.
"It's not intended to be this overly
prescribed educational experience,"
Golder said. "It really is live your life,

do what you do, but you are committing
that alcohol will not be part of the living
environment."
"We don't imagine the program to
have lots of presentations on alcohol,"
she cited as an example. "Why would
you say that to people who have chosen
not to have that as part of their living
environment?"
According to Golder, this approach
is intended as an acknowledgement
that students may choose to pre-assign
in this residence for a variety of rea
sons. She said that students might elect
to live in substance-free housing for
reasons ranging from health, to reli
gion, to personal choice.
With the pre-assignment deadline
looming, and because of the relatively
short amount of time the housing appli
cation has been available, Golder said
that ResEd has decided to market the
residence based on "personal connec
tions." ResEd has reached out to offi-

cials from different departments
on campus including Stanford
Athletics, the Office for Religious
Life, Student Affairs and individ
ual Residential Fellows (RFs) to
ask if they know any students who
might be interested living in a sub
stance-free community.
"We might have moderate or
mild student interest, or we might
have abundant student interest,"
Golder said. "We don't need thou
sands of people to sign up. We just
need to know if there are students
who want this option to exist."
The Stanford Daily Editorial
Board, a body of students inde
pendent of the Daily staff, wrote
in February in support of a pilot
substance-free residence restrict
ed to upperclassmen ("Time to es
tablish substance-free housing,"
Feb. 27).
Relating to University efforts
The recommendation to es
tablish a substance-free residence
on campus came from an alcohol
policy committee made up of stu
dents, faculty and staff members
convened last year. This commit
tee served as a precursor to the
Office of Alcohol Policy and Edu
cation (OAPE), which was estab
lished in September and is head
ed up by Ralph Castro, former as
sociate director of the Vaden
Health Center.
Castro wrote in an email to
The Daily that he supports the

concept of substance-free hous
ing because it "fits into OAPE's
goal of increasing support for
non-drinkers and light drinkers."
"OAPE is focused on decreas
ing harm associated with alcohol
misuse and high-risk drinking,"
he said. "Substance-free housing
is one tool that can aid in further
ing this vision in my opinion."
Similar in aim to OAPE's Car
dinal Nights, ResEd plans to del
egate extra money to the resi
dents of the substance-free com
munity so they can throw events
that will offer non-alcoholic alter
natives to the typical on-campus
social scene, specifically during
weekends and before athletic
games. Golder assured, however,
that this residence would not get
a "disproportionate" funding
when compared with other
themed programs on campus.
"Students will often say that it
feels like the only thing to do so
cially is to go to a party where
there's alcohol," she added. "We
don't want the burden to be on
students [to finance non-alco
holic events]. We want to give
them the resources, so they can do
what they want to do."
She said the community might
use this money to finance trips to
go bowling or to the movies, or to
have a video game marathon or a
cooking night.
According to Golder, the mis
sion of substance-free housing ex

pands beyond the University's re
cent efforts to campaign against
alcohol abuse.
"I think [the residence] helps
to support the notion of responsi
ble and healthy use of alcohol as
an example by saying, 'l'm choos
ing not to have substance in my
home,'" Golder said. "So it sup
ports that.
"But in some sense," she
added. "I think of it as discreet. I
think of it as having a full-range of
options of student living environ
ments, and this should be one of
the options that we offer."
Choosing the location
ResEd chose Mirrielees, an
apartment residence that was
formerly a part of the Escondido
Village graduate community, as
the site of the pilot program be
cause of its history of being "up
perclassmen-run and more stu
dent-owned," according to Gold
er. Instead of a typical RF, Mir
rielees has a ResEd staff mem
ber, Tiffany Taylor, who serves as
an area coordinator.
"We want students to have
ownership of this experience,
and [for it not to] be because of
some parental notion," Golder
said. "Not that RFs only exist in
this way, but we want students to
be the drivers of their experience
instead of a program, or an
RF, or Res Ed."
For instance, Golder said that

the community will choose for it
self at the beginning of the year
how it wants to handle situations
when a resident breaches his or
her substance-free commitment,
instead of having reprimands is
sued by Res Ed. Golder said
ResEd wants to avoid the resi
dence becoming a "police state,"
"What I'm not interested in is
'ResEd said you can't do this.' So
what?" she added. "What mat
ters much more is if you and I
lived next door to each other,
that I care about you and respect
you enough to not do something
that would upset you or hurt
you."
She also said that Mirrielees
tends to be an attractive place
for students to live. In the 2009
Draw, Mirrielees was filled with
residents who had Tier 1 or low
Tier 2 draw numbers.
"We wanted to have a resi
dence that is somewhat popular
for upperclass students," Golder
said. "Wanting geography to be a
reward, not a punishment."
Based on the results of the
pilot program, ResEd will recon
sider where the substance-free
residence should be established
in the long term.

Evaluating success
While the Draw takes place
each year in the spring, a deci
sion must be made by the begin
ning of winter quarter next year

about what direction to take sub
stance-free housing in next,
Golder said. ResEd will seek
feedback now through the end of
fall quarter.
"Our first indicator will likely
be based on the number of stu
dents who apply for pre-assign
ment," wrote ResEd Assistant
Dean Zac Sargeant in an email
to The Daily. "We will continue
to gauge student interest, so we
can respond accordingly."
Sargeant said ResEd will also
look at "pre-assignment applica
tions, Draw data and community
assessments" to determine the
next step.
Golder said she could imagine
substance-free housing eventual
ly becoming similar to gender
neutral housing, offered at multi
ple residences on campus, or it
could expand into an entire build
ing if there is enough interest.
"This year will give us some
data instead of some hypotheti
cal," Golder said. "Then we can
make some good decisions based
on student interest and student
need."
"We are about choice in our
residential system," she added.
"We have 78 houses with all dif
ferent varieties of options avail
able to students ... We wanted
this to be one option."

convened last year. This commit
tee served as a precursor to the
Office of Alcohol Policy and Edu
cation (OAPE), which was estab
lished in September and is head
ed up by Ralph Castro, former as
sociate director of the Vaden
Health Center.
Castro wrote in an email to
The Daily that he supports the

concept of substance-free hous
ing because it "fits into OAPE's
goal of increasing support for
non-drinkers and light drinkers."
"OAPE is focused on decreas
ing harm associated with alcohol
misuse and high-risk drinking,"
he said. "Substance-free housing
is one tool that can aid in further
ing this vision in my opinion."
Similar in aim to OAPE's Car
dinal Nights, ResEd plans to del
egate extra money to the resi
dents of the substance-free com
munity so they can throw events
that will offer non-alcoholic alter
natives to the typical on-campus
social scene, specifically during
weekends and before athletic
games. Golder assured, however,
that this residence would not get
a "disproportionate" funding
when compared with other
themed programs on campus.
"Students will often say that it
feels like the only thing to do so
cially is to go to a party where
there's alcohol," she added. "We
don't want the burden to be on
students [to finance non-alco
holic events]. We want to give
them the resources, so they can do
what they want to do."
She said the community might
use this money to finance trips to
go bowling or to the movies, or to
have a video game marathon or a
cooking night.
According to Golder, the mis
sion of substance-free housing ex

pands beyond the University's re
cent efforts to campaign against
alcohol abuse.
"I think [the residence] helps
to support the notion of responsi
ble and healthy use of alcohol as
an example by saying, 'l'm choos
ing not to have substance in my
home,'" Golder said. "So it sup
ports that.
"But in some sense," she
added. "I think of it as discreet. I
think of it as having a full-range of
options of student living environ
ments, and this should be one of
the options that we offer."
Choosing the location
ResEd chose Mirrielees, an
apartment residence that was
formerly a part of the Escondido
Village graduate community, as
the site of the pilot program be
cause of its history of being "up
perclassmen-run and more stu
dent-owned," according to Gold
er. Instead of a typical RF, Mir
rielees has a ResEd staff mem
ber, Tiffany Taylor, who serves as
an area coordinator.
"We want students to have
ownership of this experience,
and [for it not to] be because of
some parental notion," Golder
said. "Not that RFs only exist in
this way, but we want students to
be the drivers of their experience
instead of a program, or an
RF, or Res Ed."
For instance, Golder said that

the community will choose for it
self at the beginning of the year
how it wants to handle situations
when a resident breaches his or
her substance-free commitment,
instead of having reprimands is
sued by Res Ed. Golder said
ResEd wants to avoid the resi
dence becoming a "police state,"
"What I'm not interested in is
'ResEd said you can't do this.' So
what?" she added. "What mat
ters much more is if you and I
lived next door to each other,
that I care about you and respect
you enough to not do something
that would upset you or hurt
you."
She also said that Mirrielees
tends to be an attractive place
for students to live. In the 2009
Draw, Mirrielees was filled with
residents who had Tier 1 or low
Tier 2 draw numbers.
"We wanted to have a resi
dence that is somewhat popular
for upperclass students," Golder
said. "Wanting geography to be a
reward, not a punishment."
Based on the results of the
pilot program, ResEd will recon
sider where the substance-free
residence should be established
in the long term.

Evaluating success
While the Draw takes place
each year in the spring, a deci
sion must be made by the begin
ning of winter quarter next year

about what direction to take sub
stance-free housing in next,
Golder said. ResEd will seek
feedback now through the end of
fall quarter.
"Our first indicator will likely
be based on the number of stu
dents who apply for pre-assign
ment," wrote ResEd Assistant
Dean Zac Sargeant in an email
to The Daily. "We will continue
to gauge student interest, so we
can respond accordingly."
Sargeant said ResEd will also
look at "pre-assignment applica
tions, Draw data and community
assessments" to determine the
next step.
Golder said she could imagine
substance-free housing eventual
ly becoming similar to gender
neutral housing, offered at multi
ple residences on campus, or it
could expand into an entire build
ing if there is enough interest.
"This year will give us some
data instead of some hypotheti
cal," Golder said. "Then we can
make some good decisions based
on student interest and student
need."
"We are about choice in our
residential system," she added.
"We have 78 houses with all dif
ferent varieties of options avail
able to students ... We wanted
this to be one option."

Mirrielees will serve as the test site
for a new substance-free undergradu
ate housing option this upcoming fall,
according to Deborah Golder, dean of
Residential Education (ResEd).
Twenty-four upperclassmen will par
ticipate in the pilot program, which
will be held in a first-floor wing of the
apartment residence.
These students, to be selected
through a pre-assignment process, will
make a commitment that they and
their guests will not "be in possession
of, use or be under the influence of"
identified substances while in the resi
dence, according to Res Ed's website.
The barred substances include alco
hol, illicit drugs and cigarettes, while
the misuse of prescription or over-the
counter medication will also be pro
hibited.
The initiative, which Golder re
ferred to as "a big experiment," fol

lows a recommendation from a Uni
versity alcohol policy study group
committee last spring. ResEd made
the final decision to launch the pro
gram for the 2012-13 academic year
just within the last few weeks, pushing
the project forward to meet this Fri
day's student deadline for pre-assign
ing.
"We were going to spend a little bit
more time in the planning stages,"
Golder said. "But I think folks felt,
'Hey, let's go for it. We don't need to
take over a whole house. Let's just try
it. Let's just see.'"
The program utilizes the pre-assign
ment process to ensure students com
mit upfront to making the community
substance-free, Golder said. She added
that the residence would differ from
other themed-housing options in that it
would have minimal special program
ming.
"It's not intended to be this overly
prescribed educational experience,"
Golder said. "It really is live your life,

do what you do, but you are committing
that alcohol will not be part of the living
environment."
"We don't imagine the program to
have lots of presentations on alcohol,"
she cited as an example. "Why would
you say that to people who have chosen
not to have that as part of their living
environment?"
According to Golder, this approach
is intended as an acknowledgement
that students may choose to pre-assign
in this residence for a variety of rea
sons. She said that students might elect
to live in substance-free housing for
reasons ranging from health, to reli
gion, to personal choice.
With the pre-assignment deadline
looming, and because of the relatively
short amount of time the housing appli
cation has been available, Golder said
that ResEd has decided to market the
residence based on "personal connec
tions." ResEd has reached out to offi-

cials from different departments
on campus including Stanford
Athletics, the Office for Religious
Life, Student Affairs and individ
ual Residential Fellows (RFs) to
ask if they know any students who
might be interested living in a sub
stance-free community.
"We might have moderate or
mild student interest, or we might
have abundant student interest,"
Golder said. "We don't need thou
sands of people to sign up. We just
need to know if there are students
who want this option to exist."

She also said that Mirrielees
tends to be an attractive place
for students to live. In the 2009
Draw, Mirrielees was filled with
residents who had Tier 1 or low
Tier 2 draw numbers.
"We wanted to have a resi
dence that is somewhat popular
for upperclass students," Golder
said. "Wanting geography to be a
reward, not a punishment."
Based on the results of the
pilot program, ResEd will recon
sider where the substance-free
residence should be established
in the long term.

Evaluating success
While the Draw takes place
each year in the spring, a deci
sion must be made by the begin
ning of winter quarter next year

about what direction to take sub
stance-free housing in next,
Golder said. ResEd will seek
feedback now through the end of
fall quarter.
"Our first indicator will likely
be based on the number of stu
dents who apply for pre-assign
ment," wrote ResEd Assistant
Dean Zac Sargeant in an email
to The Daily. "We will continue
to gauge student interest, so we
can respond accordingly."
Sargeant said ResEd will also
look at "pre-assignment applica
tions, Draw data and community
assessments" to determine the
next step.
Golder said she could imagine
substance-free housing eventual
ly becoming similar to gender
neutral housing, offered at multi
ple residences on campus, or it
could expand into an entire build
ing if there is enough interest.
"This year will give us some
data instead of some hypotheti
cal," Golder said. "Then we can
make some good decisions based
on student interest and student
need."
"We are about choice in our
residential system," she added.
"We have 78 houses with all dif
ferent varieties of options avail
able to students ... We wanted
this to be one option."

Mirrielees will serve as the test site
for a new substance-free undergradu
ate housing option this upcoming fall,
according to Deborah Golder, dean of
Residential Education (ResEd).
Twenty-four upperclassmen will par
ticipate in the pilot program, which
will be held in a first-floor wing of the
apartment residence.
These students, to be selected
through a pre-assignment process, will
make a commitment that they and
their guests will not "be in possession
of, use or be under the influence of"
identified substances while in the resi
dence, according to Res Ed's website.
The barred substances include alco
hol, illicit drugs and cigarettes, while
the misuse of prescription or over-the
counter medication will also be pro
hibited.
The initiative, which Golder re
ferred to as "a big experiment," fol

lows a recommendation from a Uni
versity alcohol policy study group
committee last spring. ResEd made
the final decision to launch the pro
gram for the 2012-13 academic year
just within the last few weeks, pushing
the project forward to meet this Fri
day's student deadline for pre-assign
ing.
"We were going to spend a little bit
more time in the planning stages,"
Golder said. "But I think folks felt,
'Hey, let's go for it. We don't need to
take over a whole house. Let's just try
it. Let's just see.'"
The program utilizes the pre-assign
ment process to ensure students com
mit upfront to making the community
substance-free, Golder said. She added
that the residence would differ from
other themed-housing options in that it
would have minimal special program
ming.
"It's not intended to be this overly
prescribed educational experience,"
Golder said. "It really is live your life,

do what you do, but you are committing
that alcohol will not be part of the living
environment."
"We don't imagine the program to
have lots of presentations on alcohol,"
she cited as an example. "Why would
you say that to people who have chosen
not to have that as part of their living
environment?"
According to Golder, this approach
is intended as an acknowledgement
that students may choose to pre-assign
in this residence for a variety of rea
sons. She said that students might elect
to live in substance-free housing for
reasons ranging from health, to reli
gion, to personal choice.
With the pre-assignment deadline
looming, and because of the relatively
short amount of time the housing appli
cation has been available, Golder said
that ResEd has decided to market the
residence based on "personal connec
tions." ResEd has reached out to offi-

cials from different departments
on campus including Stanford
Athletics, the Office for Religious
Life, Student Affairs and individ
ual Residential Fellows (RFs) to
ask if they know any students who
might be interested living in a sub
stance-free community.
"We might have moderate or
mild student interest, or we might
have abundant student interest,"
Golder said. "We don't need thou
sands of people to sign up. We just
need to know if there are students
who want this option to exist."
The Stanford Daily Editorial
Board, a body of students inde
pendent of the Daily staff, wrote
in February in support of a pilot
substance-free residence restrict
ed to upperclassmen ("Time to es
tablish substance-free housing,"
Feb. 27).
Relating to University efforts
The recommendation to es
tablish a substance-free residence
on campus came from an alcohol
policy committee made up of stu
dents, faculty and staff members
convened last year. This commit
tee served as a precursor to the
Office of Alcohol Policy and Edu
cation (OAPE), which was estab
lished in September and is head
ed up by Ralph Castro, former as
sociate director of the Vaden
Health Center.
Castro wrote in an email to
The Daily that he supports the

concept of substance-free hous
ing because it "fits into OAPE's
goal of increasing support for
non-drinkers and light drinkers."
"OAPE is focused on decreas
ing harm associated with alcohol
misuse and high-risk drinking,"
he said. "Substance-free housing
is one tool that can aid in further
ing this vision in my opinion."
Similar in aim to OAPE's Car
dinal Nights, ResEd plans to del
egate extra money to the resi
dents of the substance-free com
munity so they can throw events
that will offer non-alcoholic alter
natives to the typical on-campus
social scene, specifically during
weekends and before athletic
games. Golder assured, however,
that this residence would not get
a "disproportionate" funding
when compared with other
themed programs on campus.
"Students will often say that it
feels like the only thing to do so
cially is to go to a party where
there's alcohol," she added. "We
don't want the burden to be on
students [to finance non-alco
holic events]. We want to give
them the resources, so they can do
what they want to do."
She said the community might
use this money to finance trips to
go bowling or to the movies, or to
have a video game marathon or a
cooking night.
According to Golder, the mis
sion of substance-free housing ex

pands beyond the University's re
cent efforts to campaign against
alcohol abuse.
"I think [the residence] helps
to support the notion of responsi
ble and healthy use of alcohol as
an example by saying, 'l'm choos
ing not to have substance in my
home,'" Golder said. "So it sup
ports that.
"But in some sense," she
added. "I think of it as discreet. I
think of it as having a full-range of
options of student living environ
ments, and this should be one of
the options that we offer."
Choosing the location
ResEd chose Mirrielees, an
apartment residence that was
formerly a part of the Escondido
Village graduate community, as
the site of the pilot program be
cause of its history of being "up
perclassmen-run and more stu
dent-owned," according to Gold
er. Instead of a typical RF, Mir
rielees has a ResEd staff mem
ber, Tiffany Taylor, who serves as
an area coordinator.
"We want students to have
ownership of this experience,
and [for it not to] be because of
some parental notion," Golder
said. "Not that RFs only exist in
this way, but we want students to
be the drivers of their experience
instead of a program, or an
RF, or Res Ed."
For instance, Golder said that

the community will choose for it
self at the beginning of the year
how it wants to handle situations
when a resident breaches his or
her substance-free commitment,
instead of having reprimands is
sued by Res Ed. Golder said
ResEd wants to avoid the resi
dence becoming a "police state,"
"What I'm not interested in is
'ResEd said you can't do this.' So
what?" she added. "What mat
ters much more is if you and I
lived next door to each other,
that I care about you and respect
you enough to not do something
that would upset you or hurt
you."
She also said that Mirrielees
tends to be an attractive place
for students to live. In the 2009
Draw, Mirrielees was filled with
residents who had Tier 1 or low
Tier 2 draw numbers.
"We wanted to have a resi
dence that is somewhat popular
for upperclass students," Golder
said. "Wanting geography to be a
reward, not a punishment."
Based on the results of the
pilot program, ResEd will recon
sider where the substance-free
residence should be established
in the long term.
