# ResEd debuts substance-free
## Wing on first floor of Mirrielees to host pilot program 
### KURT CHIRBAS MANAGING EDITOR 
Mirrielees will serve as the test site
for a new substance-free undergradu
ate housing option this upcoming fall,
according to Deborah Golder, dean of
Residential Education (ResEd).
Twenty-four upperclassmen will par
ticipate in the pilot program, which
will be held in a first-floor wing of the
apartment residence.
These students, to be selected
through a pre-assignment process, will
make a commitment that they and
their guests will not "be in possession
of, use or be under the influence of"
identified substances while in the resi
dence, according to Res Ed's website.
The barred substances include alco
hol, illicit drugs and cigarettes, while
the misuse of prescription or over-the
counter medication will also be pro
hibited.
The initiative, which Golder re
ferred to as "a big experiment," fol

lows a recommendation from a Uni
versity alcohol policy study group
committee last spring. ResEd made
the final decision to launch the pro
gram for the 2012-13 academic year
just within the last few weeks, pushing
the project forward to meet this Fri
day's student deadline for pre-assign
ing.
"We were going to spend a little bit
more time in the planning stages,"
Golder said. "But I think folks felt,
'Hey, let's go for it. We don't need to
take over a whole house. Let's just try
it. Let's just see.'"
The program utilizes the pre-assign
ment process to ensure students com
mit upfront to making the community
substance-free, Golder said. She added
that the residence would differ from
other themed-housing options in that it
would have minimal special program
ming.
"It's not intended to be this overly
prescribed educational experience,"
Golder said. "It really is live your life,

do what you do, but you are committing
that alcohol will not be part of the living
environment."
"We don't imagine the program to
have lots of presentations on alcohol,"
she cited as an example. "Why would
you say that to people who have chosen
not to have that as part of their living
environment?"
According to Golder, this approach
is intended as an acknowledgement
that students may choose to pre-assign
in this residence for a variety of rea
sons. She said that students might elect
to live in substance-free housing for
reasons ranging from health, to reli
gion, to personal choice.
With the pre-assignment deadline
looming, and because of the relatively
short amount of time the housing appli
cation has been available, Golder said
that ResEd has decided to market the
residence based on "personal connec
tions." ResEd has reached out to offi-
