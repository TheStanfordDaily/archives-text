## Stanford aims to reduce traffic congestion 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ileana Najarro 
Congestion and Parking Relief In
centives (Capri), a new Stanford re
search program, enables 12,000 Stanford
and other local drivers to earn cash
prizes online by avoiding driving during
high-traffic hours.
Balaji Prabhakar, director of the proj
ect and professor of electrical engineer
ing and computer science, said in the
Stanford Report that the project's goal is
to effectively and efficiently motivate
people to reduce rush-hour traffic, a
growing concern in Santa Clara County,
by awarding monetary prizes.
Those eligible to enroll in the study
insert a unique identification tag to the
inside of their windshield detectable to
scanners at 10 main campus entry points.
Those that avoid the weekday 8 to 9 a.m.
rush hour and 5 to 6 p.m. are automati
cally rewarded credits for the project's
online game that pays users random cash
prizes of $2 to $5O.
"We couldn't think about doing this
kind of thing in the 20th century," Prab
hakar told the Stanford Report. "With
today's technology, it's feasible to install
low-cost sensors on a wireless network and
make use of new Internet technology."
If Capri reaches its goal of reducing
traffic by at least a few hundred cars, it may
qualify for University funding once its cur
rent federal funding runs out.
Students living on campus are ineligible.
The results of the project will be pre
sented and discussed at the Precourt In
stitute for Energy's weekly energy semi
nar on May 14.
