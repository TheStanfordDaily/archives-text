# Study shows butterfly population at risk
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Mary Ann Toman-Miller 
Stanford researchers have recently
shown that early snowmelts for two con
secutive years may significantly affect
variations in butterfly population growth
rates, demonstrating a link between cli-
mate change and insect popula
tion.
The research, performed in the
Colorado Rocky Mountains, ana
lyzed long-term data on the com
mon Mormon fritillary butterfly,
and predicts that this summer will
be difficult for butterflies due to a
low snowpack.
Early snowmelts caused flow
ers to bud too soon and subse
quently be destroyed by early-sea
son frosts, which result in a loss of
the butterfly's preferred nectar
flower. This reduced nectar avail
ability leads to a decline in the
number of eggs laid by females for
the next year's caterpillar popula
tion.
Carol Boggs, Bing director of
the Program in Human Biology at
Stanford and the study's lead au
thor, noted that previous studies
have shown a single climatic vari
able, such as an early snowmelt,
can have multiple effects on an or
ganism's population growth. How
ever, this link had not been
demonstrated for species like but

terflies that live for one year only.
The National Science Founda
tion and Stanford's Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education
funded the study. The results were
published in March 2012 by Ecol
ogy Letters, which is a joint U.S.-
French publication, with support
by France's major scientific re
search center, Le Centre National
de la Recherche Scientifique.
