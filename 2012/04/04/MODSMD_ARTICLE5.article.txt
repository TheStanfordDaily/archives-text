## CISAC receives $2.45 million research grant 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Center for International Security
and Cooperation (CISAC) received a $2.45
million grant for a span of four years from The
John D. and Catherine T. Mac Arthur Founda
tion to train future specialists in nuclear securi
ty and support ongoing projects, including sci
entific cooperation with China.
Mariano-Florentino Cuellar, law professor
and CISAC co-director, said that the institute is
lucky to have continued support from the
Mac Arthur Foundation, and that such support
is a testament to the institute's significant and
unique contributions.
"Historically, the Mac Arthur foundation
has recognized CISAC as one of the most
unique places in the country, bringing together
scientists and social scientists and different pol

icy professionals to work on national security
problems," Cuellar said.
The funds will support three to four new
Mac Arthur graduate and post-doctoral student
fellowships, in addition to policy seminars for all
15 to 20 fellows in the program.
Lynn Eden, CISAC associate director for re
search and senior research scholar, said these
policy seminars focus on "how to present more
effectively and how to think about how the
scholarship that you're doing can be relevant to
debates that are going on in Washington, or the
U.N., or other countries."
The seminars, Cuellar said, are an effective
training method that goes beyond scholarship.
"They are training to have one foot in the ac
ademic world, with the very best possible re
search, but another foot in the policy world so
they can actually make an impact," Cuellar said.
According to Eden, activities within the

seminar include a staged briefing, with Former
Secretary of Defense William Perry serving as a
mock secretary of energy to critique students'
performances and methods of questioning.
Toshihiro Fhguchi, a second year post-doc
toral fellow at CIS AC, wrote in an email to The
Daily that being a Mac Arthur fellow at CISAC
has been a unique experience, and that he is
grateful for the training he has received.
"The Mac Arthur Foundation's emphasis on
training is an exceptionally far-sighted and wise
investment at the time when we tend to meas
ure 'progress' only by reports and symposiums
attended by well-established scholars and prac
titioners," Higuchi wrote.
"CISAC, I believe, uniquely qualifies as a
long-term partner for the Mac Arthur Founda
tion because of its strong commitment to educa
tion, which sets us apart from most other re
search institutes in the field," he continued.
According to Cuellar, the continued part
nership with the Mac Arthur Foundation en
ables CISAC to vigorously pursue its mission to
help Stanford researchers working on issues of
security and international cooperation, drawing
in scholars from different disciplines into one
unique setting.
"It's a common meeting ground for people
from dramatically different disciplines who
share the common interest of making the world
safer," Cuellar said.
Higuchi, for instance, takes a historical ap
proach to his fellowship project on nuclear se
curity and risk, looking at the problem of ra
dioactive contamination a method he said is
often overlooked at other institutions.
"We tend to approach the subject as if scien
tific methods alone can establish the danger of
radioactive fallout as serious or negligible,"
Higuchi wrote.
Higuchi's research "critically examines the
actual process in which scientific experts from
different epistemic and political communities
during the Cold War era 'negotiated' among
themselves how to define the danger of global
ly dispersed radioactive fallout generated by at
mospheric nuclear tests," he said.
"The historical analysis of changes in our un
derstanding of global fallout through the social
institution of expertise sheds light upon how the
Cold War changed its course away from a nu
clear Armageddon," Higuchi added. "It also of
fers rare insights into the dynamic of global en
vironmental politics in general, which is a vital
component of international security in our
world."
