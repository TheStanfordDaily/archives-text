# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## ASSU senators consider departing early from student government 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
At its Tuesday night meeting, the 13th
Undergraduate Senate discussed how to al
locate its efforts in the remaining weeks of
the senators' terms, with senators debating
the possibility of transitioning to the new
Senate earlier, in week three or four of spring
quarter rather than week five as has tradi
tionally occurred.
When asked her motivation for propos
ing a shortened term, Senator Samar
Alqatari 'l4 said, "because I want to."
"I think two weeks should be enough

time to prepare them for Senate," she added.
"Campaigning takes two weeks. Why should
the transition take longer?"
"Also, there is more time to train," said
Appropriations Chair Brianna Pang 'l3 in
support of Alqatari's suggestion. "While
everyone is still on campus in spring quarter,
they can get a head start on their Senate
term. Last year was very rushed in our transi
tion; starting the transition earlier might be
beneficial."
Senator Ben Laufer 'l2 suggested using
the remainder of the body's term to initiate a
referendum to amend the "Rights of the Ac
cused" section in the current ASSU Consti

tution. As noted by ASSU President Michael
Cruz 'l2, the clause violates the Dear Col
league Letter of the Office for Civil Rights by
requiring a higher standard of proof in sexu
al assault cases than is mandated by Title IX.
However, in a straw poll vote to gauge in
terest in pursuing the initiative, only two sen
ators indicated that they would be willing to
pursue a referendum in the following weeks.
Several said that they voted negatively be
cause of concern that a referendum would
not be approved in the Senate because of
under-voting.
Senate Chair Rafa Vazquez 'l2 then sug
gested that the Senate require that the new

senators, who will be elected at the end of
week two, attend the last couple of weekly
Senate meetings as a transition, and that the
current Senate return to the question of ab
breviating its term next week.
Criticism of the Elections Commission
Although Elections Commissioner
Adam Adler 'l2 was not present at the meet
ing, Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4 voiced criti
cism of the Elections Commission, claiming
that it has disseminated inaccurate informa-
tion regarding the existence of a
cap on campaign spending.
"I've been disappointed with
the Elections Commission in gen
eral with a lot of things in this
cycle," Elhanan said. "At this point,
from the emails that have been dis
seminated to [the GSC and Senate
candidates], there is still a cap.
Which there isn't.
"There have been emails ...
toward the Elections Commission
er telling him that that is false, and
he has not sent out an email [to the
candidates]," he added.
When asked for comment on
Elhanan's comments, Adler said
that he notified the candidates of
the campaign cap after Parliamen
tarian Alex Kindel 'l4 forwarded
him a bill which he interpreted as
requiring such regulation. When
Elhanan told him that the Senate
had interpreted it otherwise,
Adler replied by informing El
hanan that he would defer to the
judgment of Kindel, as ASSU par
liamentarian.
"They are completely unprofes
sional," Adler said of the Senate.
"They don't have any sense of what
has or hasn't happened in the past."
"I just think there needs to be
greater accountability of the Elec
tions Commission," Elhanan said,
although he acknowledged that
Kindel may have been partly to
blame for not clearly passing along
the bill and its interpretation. El
hanan proposed having an assis
tant elections commissioner solely
responsible for campaign financing
in the future.
The senators also granted cam
paign funding to seven Senate can
didates who had been refused by
the Elections Commission because
they missed the deadline for appli
cation.

Reconsidering SSE leadership
After passing a bill urging the
University to support the Axe
Committee's efforts to reestablish
broadcast lights on Hoover Tower
for special events, the Senators de
bated an executive bill to renew the
employment of ASSU Financial
Manager and Student Service En
terprises (SSE) CEO Naveen
Mahmoud 'll.
Having been initially appointed
for a one-year-term, Mahmoud's
contract must be reapproved by
the Senate for a second term. The
Board of SSE, including Cruz,
Vazquez and others, considered
and approved Mahmoud's contin
ued employment after a thorough
investigation, but without consid
ering other candidates.
Cruz highlighted some of the
impressive financial advances
made by Mahmoud this year, in
cluding the successful initiation of
the campus mobile store and the
Ground Up cafe.
"I agree that Naveen has done a
good job with several of her initia
tives," Laufer said, "but I think that,
going forward, communication
should be better."
Laufer specifically referred to
Mahmoud's advice to the Senate
about the use of the ASSU buffer
fund, which he claimed was mis
leading.
A couple senators also ex
pressed concern about problems in
SSE that may have been related to
Mahmoud's leadership. After
hearing Cruz's overwhelmingly
positive reflection centered on suc
cess, Elhanan asked, "Was there
any discussion of the time it takes
to get receipts and the problems
within SSE? ... Were there discus
sions of the hurdles as well?"
"She's doing great work on ini
tiatives that are outside of her core
responsibilities," said Senator Dan
DeLong 'l3. "[But] one priority
that we may want to really urge the
new financial manager to prioritize
is the nuts and bolts of their posi

tion ... Stanford students are neg
atively affected as a result of the
SSE's financial manager failing to
do the job that they've been

charged to do."
The senators decided to post
pone the bill until next week's
meeting, with Mahmoud in atten

dance.

ing, Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4 voiced criti
cism of the Elections Commission, claiming
that it has disseminated inaccurate informa-
tion regarding the existence of a
cap on campaign spending.
"I've been disappointed with
the Elections Commission in gen
eral with a lot of things in this
cycle," Elhanan said. "At this point,
from the emails that have been dis
seminated to [the GSC and Senate
candidates], there is still a cap.
Which there isn't.
"There have been emails ...
toward the Elections Commission
er telling him that that is false, and
he has not sent out an email [to the
candidates]," he added.
When asked for comment on
Elhanan's comments, Adler said
that he notified the candidates of
the campaign cap after Parliamen
tarian Alex Kindel 'l4 forwarded
him a bill which he interpreted as
requiring such regulation. When
Elhanan told him that the Senate
had interpreted it otherwise,
Adler replied by informing El
hanan that he would defer to the
judgment of Kindel, as ASSU par
liamentarian.
"They are completely unprofes
sional," Adler said of the Senate.
"They don't have any sense of what
has or hasn't happened in the past."
"I just think there needs to be
greater accountability of the Elec
tions Commission," Elhanan said,
although he acknowledged that
Kindel may have been partly to
blame for not clearly passing along
the bill and its interpretation. El
hanan proposed having an assis
tant elections commissioner solely
responsible for campaign financing
in the future.
The senators also granted cam
paign funding to seven Senate can
didates who had been refused by
the Elections Commission because
they missed the deadline for appli
cation.

Reconsidering SSE leadership
After passing a bill urging the
University to support the Axe
Committee's efforts to reestablish
broadcast lights on Hoover Tower
for special events, the Senators de
bated an executive bill to renew the
employment of ASSU Financial
Manager and Student Service En
terprises (SSE) CEO Naveen
Mahmoud 'll.
Having been initially appointed
for a one-year-term, Mahmoud's
contract must be reapproved by
the Senate for a second term. The
Board of SSE, including Cruz,
Vazquez and others, considered
and approved Mahmoud's contin
ued employment after a thorough
investigation, but without consid
ering other candidates.
Cruz highlighted some of the
impressive financial advances
made by Mahmoud this year, in
cluding the successful initiation of
the campus mobile store and the
Ground Up cafe.
"I agree that Naveen has done a
good job with several of her initia
tives," Laufer said, "but I think that,
going forward, communication
should be better."
Laufer specifically referred to
Mahmoud's advice to the Senate
about the use of the ASSU buffer
fund, which he claimed was mis
leading.
A couple senators also ex
pressed concern about problems in
SSE that may have been related to
Mahmoud's leadership. After
hearing Cruz's overwhelmingly
positive reflection centered on suc
cess, Elhanan asked, "Was there
any discussion of the time it takes
to get receipts and the problems
within SSE? ... Were there discus
sions of the hurdles as well?"
"She's doing great work on ini
tiatives that are outside of her core
responsibilities," said Senator Dan
DeLong 'l3. "[But] one priority
that we may want to really urge the
new financial manager to prioritize
is the nuts and bolts of their posi

tion ... Stanford students are neg
atively affected as a result of the
SSE's financial manager failing to
do the job that they've been

charged to do."
The senators decided to post
pone the bill until next week's
meeting, with Mahmoud in atten

dance.

At its Tuesday night meeting, the 13th
Undergraduate Senate discussed how to al
locate its efforts in the remaining weeks of
the senators' terms, with senators debating
the possibility of transitioning to the new
Senate earlier, in week three or four of spring
quarter rather than week five as has tradi
tionally occurred.
When asked her motivation for propos
ing a shortened term, Senator Samar
Alqatari 'l4 said, "because I want to."
"I think two weeks should be enough

time to prepare them for Senate," she added.
"Campaigning takes two weeks. Why should
the transition take longer?"
"Also, there is more time to train," said
Appropriations Chair Brianna Pang 'l3 in
support of Alqatari's suggestion. "While
everyone is still on campus in spring quarter,
they can get a head start on their Senate
term. Last year was very rushed in our transi
tion; starting the transition earlier might be
beneficial."
Senator Ben Laufer 'l2 suggested using
the remainder of the body's term to initiate a
referendum to amend the "Rights of the Ac
cused" section in the current ASSU Consti

tution. As noted by ASSU President Michael
Cruz 'l2, the clause violates the Dear Col
league Letter of the Office for Civil Rights by
requiring a higher standard of proof in sexu
al assault cases than is mandated by Title IX.
However, in a straw poll vote to gauge in
terest in pursuing the initiative, only two sen
ators indicated that they would be willing to
pursue a referendum in the following weeks.
Several said that they voted negatively be
cause of concern that a referendum would
not be approved in the Senate because of
under-voting.
Senate Chair Rafa Vazquez 'l2 then sug
gested that the Senate require that the new

senators, who will be elected at the end of
week two, attend the last couple of weekly
Senate meetings as a transition, and that the
current Senate return to the question of ab
breviating its term next week.
