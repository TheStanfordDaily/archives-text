## ASSU senators consider departing early from student government 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
At its Tuesday night meeting, the 13th
Undergraduate Senate discussed how to al
locate its efforts in the remaining weeks of
the senators' terms, with senators debating
the possibility of transitioning to the new
Senate earlier, in week three or four of spring
quarter rather than week five as has tradi
tionally occurred.
When asked her motivation for propos
ing a shortened term, Senator Samar
Alqatari 'l4 said, "because I want to."
"I think two weeks should be enough

time to prepare them for Senate," she added.
"Campaigning takes two weeks. Why should
the transition take longer?"
"Also, there is more time to train," said
Appropriations Chair Brianna Pang 'l3 in
support of Alqatari's suggestion. "While
everyone is still on campus in spring quarter,
they can get a head start on their Senate
term. Last year was very rushed in our transi
tion; starting the transition earlier might be
beneficial."
Senator Ben Laufer 'l2 suggested using
the remainder of the body's term to initiate a
referendum to amend the "Rights of the Ac
cused" section in the current ASSU Consti

tution. As noted by ASSU President Michael
Cruz 'l2, the clause violates the Dear Col
league Letter of the Office for Civil Rights by
requiring a higher standard of proof in sexu
al assault cases than is mandated by Title IX.
However, in a straw poll vote to gauge in
terest in pursuing the initiative, only two sen
ators indicated that they would be willing to
pursue a referendum in the following weeks.
Several said that they voted negatively be
cause of concern that a referendum would
not be approved in the Senate because of
under-voting.
Senate Chair Rafa Vazquez 'l2 then sug
gested that the Senate require that the new

senators, who will be elected at the end of
week two, attend the last couple of weekly
Senate meetings as a transition, and that the
current Senate return to the question of ab
breviating its term next week.
Criticism of the Elections Commission
Although Elections Commissioner
Adam Adler 'l2 was not present at the meet
ing, Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4 voiced criti
cism of the Elections Commission, claiming
that it has disseminated inaccurate informa-
