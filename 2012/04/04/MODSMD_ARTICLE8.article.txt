# Stanford engineers publish wind energy study

Stanford engineers recently
published a study in Geophysical
Research Letters highlighting
their efforts using a weather
model to suggest the best place
ment of four interconnected wind
farms off the eastern coast of the
United States.
The four potential locations
recommended in the study came
from a selection of 12 and were
chosen based on their access to

consistent sea breezes.
The final grid has a total poten
tial maximum capacity of 2,000
megawatts. Each of the potential
farms would have about 100 tur
bines providing about 500
megawatts each.
Mark Z. Jacobson, senior au
thor of the study and professor of
civil and environmental engineer
ing, said in an article in the Stan
ford Report that these figures are
still theoretical due to unpredicted
conditions that may arise.
"Two thousand megawatts and
four farms are somewhat arbitrary
figures," Jacobson said. "The sizes
and locations could be adjusted for
economic, environmental and pol
icy considerations."
Jacobson said that he hopes the
study will serve a greater purpose
in policymaking for energy de
mands on a national level.
"This paper should be seen as a
tool for energy planners to better
inform their renewable energy de
cisions across a densely populated
area," he said. "It is an opportunity
to collaborate on a shared system
that reduces costs while benefiting
a large and important center of
electrical demand in the U.S."
