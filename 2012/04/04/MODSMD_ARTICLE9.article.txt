## Caffeine rush 
### â€“ Lucas Oswald 
One might expect Green Library to be the
most popular place on campus during fi
nals week, but during the last week of win
ter quarter it seemed harder to find a seat
in the CoHo than in the Bender Room.
This may not be entirely due to the CoHo's serve-your
self coffee dispensers and busy baristas. It could very
well be the coffee culture itself that continues to draw
students back.
"Coffee shops get me in the right state of mind to do
work," said coffee enthusiast Nick White 'l4.
Coffee is finding an ever-firmer foothold at Stan
ford. In the last few years, coffee shops have sprouted
up in every corner of campus. Coupa Cafe now offers
coffee from three different locations: Two are located in
University buildings in the Science & Engineering
Quad while another serves coffee between Green and
Meyer libraries, not to mention the automated machine
that serves students 24/7 on the first floor of Meyer Li
brary.
With the opening of Fraiche at Tresidder Memorial
Union in 2009, Stanford now offers third-tier coffee
fresh from Blue Bottle Coffee of San Francisco, provid
ing competition to Fraiche's neighbor, Peet's Coffee.
Additionally, Philz Coffee's new location just off El
Camino Real is bustling on an average afternoon, al
lowing students to escape the Stanford bubble in search
of their midday caffeine rush.
Why so much java?
"I just don't see why not," White said. "It's like a slap
in the face to get my work done, except in a good way.
And it literally spikes my IQ."

Sitting across from him over a
table of schoolwork in Philz Cof
fee, Reed Jobs 'l4 sips his steam
ing Code 33.
"Everyone likes to talk about
the health risks of coffee, but
what about all the health bene
fits?" Jobs said.
It is true that coffee is often
purported as a health risk, even
by Jamie Zeitzer, assistant pro
fessor of psychiatry and behav
ioral science, whose recent study
found that coffee has the poten
tial to disrupt sleep. Coffee, how
ever, does have a good side. Stud
ies have shown that drinkers
score higher on IQ tests after
drinking coffee and the beverage
has even been shown to reduce
the development of Alzheimer's
disease and Type 2 diabetes.
Coffee seems to be getting
more popular among the Stan
ford community, but the debate
surrounding its effects continues.
Nevertheless, with more and
more coffee options sprouting up
around campus, it's getting hard
er and harder to say "no" to grab
bing a hot cup of Joe between
classes.
