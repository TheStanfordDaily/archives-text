### JENNY THAI DESK EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate
closed the book on the
Introduction to the Hu
manities (IHUM) pro
gram by voting on
March 8 in favor of replacing the
program with a one-quarter
"Thinking Matters" course, sched
uled to launch this coming fall. Al
though IHUM was a quintessen
tial fixture of the Stanford experi
ence for recent students, it was
only the latest edition in Stanford's
history of freshman liberal arts
programs, an undergraduate tradi
tion that is nearly 90 years old.
Pioneering liberal arts
For the first three decades fol
lowing the University's founding
in 1891, there was no freshman
liberal arts core program in place.
In 1920, a yearlong course, The
Problems of Citizenship, became
a requirement for all freshmen.
Partly influenced by the pas
sage of the 19th Amendment, The
Problems of Citizenship course
endeavored to teach students the
necessary skills to become in
formed citizens cognizant of their
political environments. Topics on
the syllabus included Citizenship
in a Democratic World and Scien
tific Method and Attitude. In ad
dition to weekly lectures taught
by faculty from various depart
ments, students also had one-on
one sessions with the instructors.
The Problem of Citizenship
program lasted until 1934, when
dwindling student interest and
shaky faculty support led to its
termination.
The golden age of the Great
Books
Unlike its predecessor, The
History of Western Civilization
program (Western Civ), launched
in 1935, was taught only by the
History Department. Based on
the Great Books programs of Co
lumbia University and the Uni
versity of Chicago, Western Civ
was a single-track, three-quarter
course that used a core list of fif
teen "Great Books" to trace the
development of European
thought from the classical age to
modernity. The course reflected a
trend in American universities to
rediscover European roots and
affirm new prominence in global

politics after the chaotic confu
sion and loss of identity during the
decades following World War I.
Western Civ was an immensely
well-received program and lasted
well into the 19605. Although the
course was antiquated in the
sense that its reading list was com
posed of works by white Euro
pean males, many alumni have
cited the program as one of the
best academic experiences they
had at Stanford.
"It helped me become a histo
rian," said John Reider, '67 Ph.D.
'B3, former senior associate direc
tor of admission at Stanford and
former Structured Liberal Educa
tion (SLE) director. "Many peo
ple of my ancient era look back on
the course with great fondness."
Challenging Western thought: a
humanities free-for-all
Swept up by the volatile politi
cal atmosphere that propelled
campus disturbances in the latter
half of the 19605, Western Civ,
along with many other liberal arts
program requirements at other
American universities, succumbed
to the pressure of protesting stu
dents and faculty who condemned
the antiquated rigidity of a struc
tured liberal arts program. The
dominating rationale was that stu
dents could only flourish if they
were free from the constraints of
specific requirements.
"The reigning idea among
Stanford students was that every
thing was equal and students
should determine what they need
ed to know," Reider said. "The
world was their oyster. The faculty
was very happy with that because
they could teach what they want
ed to teach."
Beginning in 1969, there was
no liberal arts requirement to
bind Stanford students. Where
course selection outside their ma
jors of study was concerned, stu
dents were given only a loose set
of requirements and mostly left to
their own devices on how to com
plete them.
A return to structure: From West
ern Culture to a different CIV
In the middle of the '7os, it be
came clear to Stanford faculty
that the courses students chose
outside of their major disciplines
were more than often haphazard
and collectively lacked unity. In
an attempt to remedy the situa

tion by establishing a new set of
liberal arts requirements, a new
Western Culture requirement was
introduced. Western Culture was
a course that aimed to renew the
University's commitment to
Western intellectual thought and
tradition.
While the material in Western
Culture shared many similarities
with Western Civ, what set West
ern Culture apart from its prede
cessor was its multiple-emphases
structure, a compromise between
the single-track nature of Western
Civ and the total absence of tracks
in the '7os. Western Culture in
cluded eight different tracks cre
ated by different departments to
cater to a diversity of student in
tellectual interests. While tracks
such as Literature and Arts stuck
more closely to European intel
lectual tradition, other tracks such
as Values, Technology, Science and
Society offered reading material
that emphasized the role of tech
nology and science, which ap
pealed to the engineering-in
clined.
Given the choice to select from
a set of academic tracks. Western
Culture initially showed promise
for success. Yet the course was
crippled by the program's lack of
a coherent reading list. Although
each individual track had its own
tailored reading list, in an effort to
maintain the semblance of a com
mon reading experience, the
Western Culture program re
quired all tracks to also follow a
list of core texts. The imposition of
a core reading list proved difficult
as many tracks, particularly the
Values, Technology, and Science
track, could not coherently incor
porate the core texts into the les
sons.
At the same time, the student
population experienced a demo
graphic shift resulting in an in
creased presence of minority
groups, including African-Ameri
can, Asian and Latino students.
Disturbed by the Euro-centric
nature of the tracks, the Black
Student Union, later joined by
campus feminists and other mi
nority groups, spoke out against
racism and sexism in the Western
Culture curriculum.
"The Western culture program
as it is presently structured
around a core list and an outdated
