## The 						IHUM epic The 						transformation of the humanities at Stanford 
### JENNY THAI DESK EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate
closed the book on the
Introduction to the Hu
manities (IHUM) pro
gram by voting on
March 8 in favor of replacing the
program with a one-quarter
"Thinking Matters" course, sched
uled to launch this coming fall. Al
though IHUM was a quintessen
tial fixture of the Stanford experi
ence for recent students, it was
only the latest edition in Stanford's
history of freshman liberal arts
programs, an undergraduate tradi
tion that is nearly 90 years old.
Pioneering liberal arts
For the first three decades fol
lowing the University's founding
in 1891, there was no freshman
liberal arts core program in place.
In 1920, a yearlong course, The
Problems of Citizenship, became
a requirement for all freshmen.
Partly influenced by the pas
sage of the 19th Amendment, The
Problems of Citizenship course
endeavored to teach students the
necessary skills to become in
formed citizens cognizant of their
political environments. Topics on
the syllabus included Citizenship
in a Democratic World and Scien
tific Method and Attitude. In ad
dition to weekly lectures taught
by faculty from various depart
ments, students also had one-on
one sessions with the instructors.
The Problem of Citizenship
program lasted until 1934, when
dwindling student interest and
shaky faculty support led to its
termination.
The golden age of the Great
Books
Unlike its predecessor, The
History of Western Civilization
program (Western Civ), launched
in 1935, was taught only by the
History Department. Based on
the Great Books programs of Co
lumbia University and the Uni
versity of Chicago, Western Civ
was a single-track, three-quarter
course that used a core list of fif
teen "Great Books" to trace the
development of European
thought from the classical age to
modernity. The course reflected a
trend in American universities to
rediscover European roots and
affirm new prominence in global

politics after the chaotic confu
sion and loss of identity during the
decades following World War I.
Western Civ was an immensely
well-received program and lasted
well into the 19605. Although the
course was antiquated in the
sense that its reading list was com
posed of works by white Euro
pean males, many alumni have
cited the program as one of the
best academic experiences they
had at Stanford.
"It helped me become a histo
rian," said John Reider, '67 Ph.D.
'B3, former senior associate direc
tor of admission at Stanford and
former Structured Liberal Educa
tion (SLE) director. "Many peo
ple of my ancient era look back on
the course with great fondness."
Challenging Western thought: a
humanities free-for-all
Swept up by the volatile politi
cal atmosphere that propelled
campus disturbances in the latter
half of the 19605, Western Civ,
along with many other liberal arts
program requirements at other
American universities, succumbed
to the pressure of protesting stu
dents and faculty who condemned
the antiquated rigidity of a struc
tured liberal arts program. The
dominating rationale was that stu
dents could only flourish if they
were free from the constraints of
specific requirements.
"The reigning idea among
Stanford students was that every
thing was equal and students
should determine what they need
ed to know," Reider said. "The
world was their oyster. The faculty
was very happy with that because
they could teach what they want
ed to teach."
Beginning in 1969, there was
no liberal arts requirement to
bind Stanford students. Where
course selection outside their ma
jors of study was concerned, stu
dents were given only a loose set
of requirements and mostly left to
their own devices on how to com
plete them.
A return to structure: From West
ern Culture to a different CIV
In the middle of the '7os, it be
came clear to Stanford faculty
that the courses students chose
outside of their major disciplines
were more than often haphazard
and collectively lacked unity. In
an attempt to remedy the situa

tion by establishing a new set of
liberal arts requirements, a new
Western Culture requirement was
introduced. Western Culture was
a course that aimed to renew the
University's commitment to
Western intellectual thought and
tradition.
While the material in Western
Culture shared many similarities
with Western Civ, what set West
ern Culture apart from its prede
cessor was its multiple-emphases
structure, a compromise between
the single-track nature of Western
Civ and the total absence of tracks
in the '7os. Western Culture in
cluded eight different tracks cre
ated by different departments to
cater to a diversity of student in
tellectual interests. While tracks
such as Literature and Arts stuck
more closely to European intel
lectual tradition, other tracks such
as Values, Technology, Science and
Society offered reading material
that emphasized the role of tech
nology and science, which ap
pealed to the engineering-in
clined.
Given the choice to select from
a set of academic tracks. Western
Culture initially showed promise
for success. Yet the course was
crippled by the program's lack of
a coherent reading list. Although
each individual track had its own
tailored reading list, in an effort to
maintain the semblance of a com
mon reading experience, the
Western Culture program re
quired all tracks to also follow a
list of core texts. The imposition of
a core reading list proved difficult
as many tracks, particularly the
Values, Technology, and Science
track, could not coherently incor
porate the core texts into the les
sons.
At the same time, the student
population experienced a demo
graphic shift resulting in an in
creased presence of minority
groups, including African-Ameri
can, Asian and Latino students.
Disturbed by the Euro-centric
nature of the tracks, the Black
Student Union, later joined by
campus feminists and other mi
nority groups, spoke out against
racism and sexism in the Western
Culture curriculum.
"The Western culture program
as it is presently structured
around a core list and an outdated
philosophy of the West being
Greece, Europe, and Euro-Amer
ica is wrong," said Bill King, chair
man of the Black Student Union
in his 1988 address to the Faculty
Senate. "And worse, it hurts peo
ple mentally and emotionally in
ways that are not even recog
nized."
Western Culture was replaced
by Culture, Ideas and Values
(CIV). While retaining the multi
track structure of Western Cul
ture, the CIV track reading lists
were diversified to include repre
sentative works from women and
ethnic minorities alongside some
traditional readings. More impor
tantly, the core reading list bind
ing all tracks together was
dropped.
The birth of IHUM
Surprisingly, CIV, in compari
son to its predecessors, was a rela
tively short-lived program. The
Commission on Undergraduate
Education study in 1994 revealed
that many students found that the
tracks were too diverse not
only in content, but also in work
load and grading policy. Profes
sors also felt that there were too
many books to cover in a single
year. Introduction to the Hu
manities (IHUM) gradually re
placed CIV in the late 19905, the
University's tonic to clarify the
CIV curriculum. The number of
books designated for each track
was reduced and tracks were
modified to center around the
universality of ideas. According to
the IHUM website, IHUM cours
es dealt with the "issues, themes,
ideas and values of human identi
ty and existence," rather than fol
lowing a traditional canon.
SLE, the "Great Books" haven
While the main freshman lib
eral arts sequences have cycled
through several incarnations, one
residentially based program for
freshmen has endured the test of
time. Unlike IHUM and its prede
cessors, the Structured Liberal
Education (SLE) program has re
mained largely unchanged since
its founding. SLE developed from
an evening seminar series titled
"Social Thoughts and Institu
tions," in which professors and
students from various depart
ments, as equals, read and dis
cussed Great Books.

SLE became a fully-Hedged
residential program in 1974. With
only minor modifications to its
Great Books reading list, SLE's
Great Books approach has been
rated consistently high in student
evaluations. The self-selecting na
ture of SLE, which freshmen opt
into in place of IHUM, is one of
the main contributors to the pro
gram's enduring success.
"It's very simple they were
voluntary," Reider said. "They
wanted to be there."
Thinking Matters and diversifi
cation of the humanities
Although the findings of the
2011 Study of Undergraduate Ed
ucation at Stanford (SUES) on
the lukewarm student enthusiasm
toward the IHUM program may
be a recent development, the stu
dent voices speaking out against
the constraint of requirements
echo the spirit of the '6os, when
pressure from students to direct
their own liberal arts experiences
was the strongest.
Thinking Matters, a one-quar
ter course slated to replace the
three-quarter IHUM program
starting in the academic year
2012-2013, came from a SUES
recommendation to increase the
freedom freshmen, particularly
those enrolled in major programs
with high unit requirements, will
have to explore courses outside
their major fields of study.
Thinking Matters will also
break from the traditional mold
of humanities instruction with its

development of innovative course
themes. Proposed topics include
Brain, Behavior and Evolution;
Energy; Evil; and The Physics of
One. Many of these courses will
draw upon a diverse variety of dis
ciplines, including those not tradi
tionally studied alongside the hu
manities.
As reported by The Daily in
March, the Faculty Senate ap
proved the Committee on Under
graduate Standards and Policy
(C-USP) report supporting the
SUES recommendation on
March 8.
Given the speed with which
the Faculty Senate approved
Thinking Matters only two
months after the SUES recom
mendation some faculty are
skeptical of the success of the pro
posed course, or view the amor
phous, multi-disciplinary suggest
ed course topics as a sign of the at
rophying presence of the humani
ties at Stanford.
"It wasn't really that broken,"
said Greg Watkins, assistant direc
tor of SLE. "The evaluations of
IHUM from students were quite
favorable, more favorable than
student reputation. What the Uni
versity has caved into is the de
mand for choice."
"Not that there's something
wrong with that but students were
feeling the yoke of that require
ment," Watkins added. "I feel that
it's like giving up on taking re
sponsibility for teaching in the hu
manities and requiring our stu
dents a certain level of educa
tion."
Other faculty members how
ever are more optimistic, seeing
Thinking Matters as a means of
reviving declining student interest
in the humanities.
"I think it's plausible for us to
speculate that the humanities in
the future will no longer be a bur
densome requirement that every
one has to go through but it will be
one among many different oppor
tunities," said Russell Berman, di
rector of the IFIUM and Introduc
tory Seminars programs. "I say
that if we are concerned that stu
dents will no longer take humani
ties, we should just be more imag
inative in the kind of humanities
courses that we offer."
