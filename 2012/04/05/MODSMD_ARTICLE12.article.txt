## SEEING GREEN Plunging to the challenge(r) 
### Holly Moeller 
SOMEWHERE OVER THE
PACIFIC OCEAN —Over
the course of four decades,
Alvin, the famed submersible that
explored the sunken Titanic and
discovered black-smoker hy
drothermal vents, has made more
than 4,400 dives, but each time
only three people are treated to a
firsthand view. In all, 2,500 people
have taken the plunge. Courtesy
of my former life as an oceanogra
pher, I know a grand total of five
of them.
Glimpsing the sea floor is a rare
privilege. Human eyes have
touched only 5 percent of it; we
know less about the planet's deep
est reaches than we do about the
surface of the moon. On nearly
every submersible dive to the ocean
floor, a new species is discovered.
For us surface-dwellers, the
growth forms that have evolved
to survive the intense pressure
and unbelievable blackness of
the ocean floor are incredibly
alien. Their weirdness extends
beyond their physical appear
ance to metabolisms fueled by
strange chemicals, or slowed to
match the cold, barren environ
ment. And yet, as they float
through our TV screens or curve
across still photos, they show a
grace shaped by the liquid medi
um that envelops them.
No wonder we were so eager
for news last week from James
Cameron's solo journey to the
Challenger Deep, the very bottom
of the Mariana Trench. Not only
did the famed director promise to
assemble his footage into a docu
mentary, but his feat of engineer
ing and audacity also forced a fun
damental point: with some (ad
mittedly large) financial clout,
anyone can reach the sea floor.
Although, like the commer
cialization of space flight, deep
sea ventures for the common man
are a long time coming, their pos
sibility ties the ocean ever closer
to the realm of personal experi
ence. This is the first step toward
recognizing the intimate role the
deep ocean plays in maintaining
Earth as we know it.
That realization couldn't come
sooner.
The day after James Cameron
surfaced from his record-setting
dive, a new report was released on
the state of the seafloor in the
Gulf of Mexico.
Six months after the Deepwa
ter Horizon's 200 million gallon
oil spill, a deep-diving scientific
team (using manned and un
manned submersibles, including
Alvin) found a benthic communi
ty struggling to recover. Miles
from the spill source, they discov
ered corals choking on oil
residues and pale brittle stars
clinging to life, the sickly rem
nants of a once-thriving site.
At the surface, fishermen are
preparing to mark the second an
niversary of the spill on their cal
endars, and wondering what this
season's catches will show. They
doubt the reality will match BP's
rosy advertisements of recovery.
After all, hasn't it been 23 years
since the Exxon Valdez spill in
Alaska, where a damaged herring
fishery is just beginning to turn
the corner?
For most of us though, out of

sight is out of mind. Once oiled
seabirds stopped washing up in
media coverage, we started for
getting about the largest oil spill
in American history.
But deep below the sea sur
face, life is slow to forget. Like oil
residues, bottom trawling (the
marine version of clear-cutting re
sponsible for our catch of floun
der, cod, and scallops), ocean
warming, acidification and vari
ous other types of pollution cause
lasting damage.
The damage we do to the deep
ocean is also damage to its capaci
ty to support human life. The deep
ocean is the final recycling point
for many nutrients, shunting them
back to the surface to fuel life
anew. And the deep ocean also
slows global warming: cold, polar
water traps human carbon dioxide
emissions, and then sinks to the
sea floor, trapping the greenhouse
gas for up to a thousand years.
The deep sea also holds the
promise of new technology
compounds that could treat bac
terial infections or cure cancer
and new resources in minerals
and energy deposits that remain
untapped. Of course, as Deepwa
ter Horizon demonstrated, ac
cessing these resources comes
with risks risks that increase
with depth and that we cannot
fully understand so long as we do
not fully comprehend life in the
deep sea.
Skimming homeward over the
Pacific Ocean aboard a giant Boe
ing 747, wide-awake despite the
dimmed cabin and late hour, I
briefly wished for a window seat.
Of course, at our altitude, I would
n't be able to make out anything
below. But I could imagine: the sil
houettes of islands, the pinpricks
of ships' lights, James Cameron's
boat perched above the Mariana
Trench and the invisible realm of
life that lay thousands of meters
below.
One day, I might have an op
portunity to see that life for my
self. But until then and because
I'm not sure how much longer
that life will be around I'll have
to settle for documentaries.

Alvin, the famed submersible that
explored the sunken Titanic and
discovered black-smoker hy
drothermal vents, has made more
than 4,400 dives, but each time
only three people are treated to a
firsthand view. In all, 2,500 people
have taken the plunge. Courtesy
of my former life as an oceanogra
pher, I know a grand total of five
of them.
Glimpsing the sea floor is a rare
privilege. Human eyes have
touched only 5 percent of it; we
know less about the planet's deep
est reaches than we do about the
surface of the moon. On nearly
every submersible dive to the ocean
floor, a new species is discovered.
For us surface-dwellers, the
growth forms that have evolved
to survive the intense pressure
and unbelievable blackness of
the ocean floor are incredibly
alien. Their weirdness extends
beyond their physical appear
ance to metabolisms fueled by
strange chemicals, or slowed to
match the cold, barren environ
ment. And yet, as they float
through our TV screens or curve
across still photos, they show a
grace shaped by the liquid medi
um that envelops them.
No wonder we were so eager
for news last week from James
Cameron's solo journey to the
Challenger Deep, the very bottom
of the Mariana Trench. Not only
did the famed director promise to
assemble his footage into a docu
mentary, but his feat of engineer
ing and audacity also forced a fun
damental point: with some (ad
mittedly large) financial clout,
anyone can reach the sea floor.
Although, like the commer
cialization of space flight, deep
sea ventures for the common man
are a long time coming, their pos
sibility ties the ocean ever closer
to the realm of personal experi
ence. This is the first step toward
recognizing the intimate role the
deep ocean plays in maintaining
Earth as we know it.
That realization couldn't come
sooner.
The day after James Cameron
surfaced from his record-setting
dive, a new report was released on
the state of the seafloor in the
Gulf of Mexico.
Six months after the Deepwa
ter Horizon's 200 million gallon
oil spill, a deep-diving scientific
team (using manned and un
manned submersibles, including
Alvin) found a benthic communi
ty struggling to recover. Miles
from the spill source, they discov
ered corals choking on oil
residues and pale brittle stars
clinging to life, the sickly rem
nants of a once-thriving site.
At the surface, fishermen are
preparing to mark the second an
niversary of the spill on their cal
endars, and wondering what this
season's catches will show. They
doubt the reality will match BP's
rosy advertisements of recovery.
After all, hasn't it been 23 years
since the Exxon Valdez spill in
Alaska, where a damaged herring
fishery is just beginning to turn
the corner?
For most of us though, out of

sight is out of mind. Once oiled
seabirds stopped washing up in
media coverage, we started for
getting about the largest oil spill
in American history.
But deep below the sea sur
face, life is slow to forget. Like oil
residues, bottom trawling (the
marine version of clear-cutting re
sponsible for our catch of floun
der, cod, and scallops), ocean
warming, acidification and vari
ous other types of pollution cause
lasting damage.
The damage we do to the deep
ocean is also damage to its capaci
ty to support human life. The deep
ocean is the final recycling point
for many nutrients, shunting them
back to the surface to fuel life
anew. And the deep ocean also
slows global warming: cold, polar
water traps human carbon dioxide
emissions, and then sinks to the
sea floor, trapping the greenhouse
gas for up to a thousand years.
The deep sea also holds the
promise of new technology
compounds that could treat bac
terial infections or cure cancer
and new resources in minerals
and energy deposits that remain
untapped. Of course, as Deepwa
ter Horizon demonstrated, ac
cessing these resources comes
with risks risks that increase
with depth and that we cannot
fully understand so long as we do
not fully comprehend life in the
deep sea.
Skimming homeward over the
Pacific Ocean aboard a giant Boe
ing 747, wide-awake despite the
dimmed cabin and late hour, I
briefly wished for a window seat.
Of course, at our altitude, I would
n't be able to make out anything
below. But I could imagine: the sil
houettes of islands, the pinpricks
of ships' lights, James Cameron's
boat perched above the Mariana
Trench and the invisible realm of
life that lay thousands of meters
below.
One day, I might have an op
portunity to see that life for my
self. But until then and because
I'm not sure how much longer
that life will be around I'll have
to settle for documentaries.
