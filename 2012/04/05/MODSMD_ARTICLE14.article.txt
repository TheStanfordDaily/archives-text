# MODERN MANNERS
## The 						national pastime 
### Jeff Mandell 
I lived in Arroyo freshman year.
Escondido Road is famous in
some circles; for those who
enjoy hearing ambulance sirens at
all hours of the night, it is a pilgrim
age site. Arroyo made its fair con
tribution to the Stanford Police's
emergency call logs that year. I ac
tually could have been on first
name terms with many of the para
medics who serviced our dorm on
a regular basis. "Hey, Bob. How're
the wife and kids?" I might have
asked on a typical weekend night.
"How you doing, Jeff? They're just
fine. Becky lost another tooth.
Now who is it tonight?"
It got to the point that some
one decided that Arroyo needed
an official alcohol intervention.
Everyone was rounded up in the
common room to brainstorm so
lutions. One suggestion was for
everyone to start drinking earlier
in the day so that our systems
would have more time to handle
the alcohol. No one had the
courage to say that if you think
there is an amount of alcohol that
you have to drink each night, you
have a serious problem.
The closing words at the inter

vention can be summed up as fol
lows: 1) Mistakes will happen, and
that's okay. 2) No one will ever get
in trouble. 3) Friends will take
care of each other. Obviously, a
message that implies alcohol
abuse has no consequences is not
going to cause people to change
their behavior. Why are repeated
mistakes okay? Shouldn't we be
ashamed that a cadre of medical
professionals is required to keep
undergraduate, and especially
freshman, social life running
smoothly? There is a culture of ac
ceptance here at Stanford that
prevents alcohol abuse from
being taken seriously.
I do not mean to give the im
pression that I haven't made my
share of questionable late-night
decisions. One warm spring night
that year, my nostalgia for high
school baseball reached a peak,
and I enlisted a gang of Arroyo
friends to break into the Sunken
Diamond complex with me. I had
scouted the facilities in advance,
and I knew that the batting cages
could be accessed by scaling a 12-
foot chain-link fence.
We approached well after mid

night carrying bats, balls and
gloves. When we got to the fence,
it became apparent that not
everyone wanted to climb it. It did
look taller than I had remem
bered, and getting down from the
top looked a little tricky. Besides,
even at this late hour, there was a
steady stream of golf carts on the
nearby paths that seemed to be
patrolling the athletic fields. Fig
uring that they would definitely
hear the ping of metal bats, we
gave up on batting practice in
favor of a Wiffle Ball game on a
football practice field.
It is obvious that midnight Wif
fle Ball is not actively encouraged
by the University, but since no one
told me not to do it at NSO, I as
sumed it was allowed. The field
was not well lit, forcing us to play
on the edge closest to the street
lights. We also had to jump the
waist-high fence, but overcoming
barriers comes naturally to Stan
ford students.
After about 20 minutes, a golf
cart stopped next to our game and
we were ordered to leave the
field. "After this inning," I said.
At the same time on Mayfield
Avenue and in dorm rooms
throughout campus, hundreds of
students, many of them underage,
were drinking more than is safe or
healthy. In addition to the health
damage that is inherent to binge
drinking, some of them also made
bad decisions that further impact
ed their physical and emotional
health, as well as that of others.
Stanford students are adults (sort
of), and in my view it is appropri
ate that paternalistic laws against
underage drinking are practically
unenforced on campus. But when
fields are policed to prevent Wif
fle Ball games, yet it is tacitly ac
cepted that one of the most intel
lectual and high-achieving stu
dent bodies in the country sup
ports a very visible subculture of
escapist drinking, it makes me
wonder what our national pas
time really is.

After a quarter in Italy, Jeff is al
ways on the lookout for good,
cheap Italian wine. Send him tips at

mistakes okay? Shouldn't we be
ashamed that a cadre of medical
professionals is required to keep
undergraduate, and especially
freshman, social life running
smoothly? There is a culture of ac
ceptance here at Stanford that
prevents alcohol abuse from
being taken seriously.
I do not mean to give the im
pression that I haven't made my
share of questionable late-night
decisions. One warm spring night
that year, my nostalgia for high
school baseball reached a peak,
and I enlisted a gang of Arroyo
friends to break into the Sunken
Diamond complex with me. I had
scouted the facilities in advance,
and I knew that the batting cages
could be accessed by scaling a 12-
foot chain-link fence.
We approached well after mid

night carrying bats, balls and
gloves. When we got to the fence,
it became apparent that not
everyone wanted to climb it. It did
look taller than I had remem
bered, and getting down from the
top looked a little tricky. Besides,
even at this late hour, there was a
steady stream of golf carts on the
nearby paths that seemed to be
patrolling the athletic fields. Fig
uring that they would definitely
hear the ping of metal bats, we
gave up on batting practice in
favor of a Wiffle Ball game on a
football practice field.
It is obvious that midnight Wif
fle Ball is not actively encouraged
by the University, but since no one
told me not to do it at NSO, I as
sumed it was allowed. The field
was not well lit, forcing us to play
on the edge closest to the street
lights. We also had to jump the
waist-high fence, but overcoming
barriers comes naturally to Stan
ford students.
After about 20 minutes, a golf
cart stopped next to our game and
we were ordered to leave the
field. "After this inning," I said.
At the same time on Mayfield
Avenue and in dorm rooms
throughout campus, hundreds of
students, many of them underage,
were drinking more than is safe or
healthy. In addition to the health
damage that is inherent to binge
drinking, some of them also made
bad decisions that further impact
ed their physical and emotional
health, as well as that of others.
Stanford students are adults (sort
of), and in my view it is appropri
ate that paternalistic laws against
underage drinking are practically
unenforced on campus. But when
fields are policed to prevent Wif
fle Ball games, yet it is tacitly ac
cepted that one of the most intel
lectual and high-achieving stu
dent bodies in the country sup
ports a very visible subculture of
escapist drinking, it makes me
wonder what our national pas
time really is.

After a quarter in Italy, Jeff is al
ways on the lookout for good,
cheap Italian wine. Send him tips at
