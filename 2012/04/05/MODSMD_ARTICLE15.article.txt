## Stopping skid in Seattle CARDINAL TRAVELS TO FACE WASHINGTON 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
No one likes to be 10th in an 11-team con
ference, even just two weeks into the Pac-12
season. Yet that's exactly where the No. 6 Stan
ford baseball team stands at the moment after
four consecutive Pac-12 losses, and the Cardi
nal needs to get on the right track quickly if it

wants to compete in the nation's best confer
ence.
A three-game series starting tonight against
a weak Washington (16-9,3-3 Pac-12) squad in
Seattle looks like an opportunity to do just that
for Stanford (17-6,2-4), but there are no sure
things in college baseball, especially when you
have gone a meager 4-4 on the road to open up
the season. Add that to a stretch that saw the
Cardinal play eight games in nine days, ending
in a thrilling 9-8 win over St. Mary's on Monday,
and this series could prove as challenging as
any on Stanford's upcoming conference sched
ule.

"Our coach always says that you've just got
to come to play every day, no matter what," said
sophomore Danny Diekroeger, who had the
game-winning hit over the Gaels as a 12th-in
ning pinch hitter. "You can't make excuses
[when it comes to fatigue]. You've got to go out
and play, because the other team will always
come to play."
Even though the Cardinal easily swept the
Huskies at Sunken Diamond a year ago
Washington finished last in the Pac-10 you
never know when an opponent is going to be a

Junior Stephen Piscotty (above), one of the Stanford baseball team's best hitters and its starting third baseman, saw important action on the mound

handful, as St. Mary's demonstrat
ed Monday night on the Farm. The
extra-inning victory hardly resem
bled Stanford's other wins over the
Gaels earlier in the season by the
combined score of 15-4, as the Car
dinal needed a five-run, ninth-in
ning rally and some clutch relief
pitching from junior Stephen Pis
cotty, known much better for his
skills at third base and at the plate.
"I think this win shows that
we're not mentally fatigued after
getting beat three times [at No. 8
Arizona]," Piscotty said after the
game.
It was hardly the first time that
a recent Stanford team had battled
back to claim a win at the tail end
of a slump. After opening its Pac
-10 season with four straight wins a
year ago, the Cardinal lost five
conference contests in a row, in
cluding a disastrous home sweep
by Oregon State. With No. 11
UCLA in town the following
weekend, Stanford trailed the
Bruins 4-1 going into the bottom
of the ninth in the rubber matchup,

each team already having claimed
a game in the series.
UCLA got two quick outs to
seemingly crush the Cardinal's
chances, but a base hit and a walk
set up then-sophomore center
fielder Jake Stewart for an RBI
single and senior catcher Zach
Jones for a game-tying double. A
blooper from sophomore short
stop Kenny Diekroeger sealed the
5-4 win and sent the Bruins pack
ing with stunned looks on their
faces.
Those shocked expressions re
turned to Sunken Diamond on
Monday night, with the Gaels leav
ing town with a last-minute loss of
their own.
"It's really similar to [the
UCLA game]," Danny
Diekroeger said. "Guys just came
and got hits and showed how much
heart we have to come back and
put up five runs in the bottom of
the ninth."
Last year's comeback win was
followed by a midweek victory
over Cal two days later, but the
Cardinal quickly fell back into a
mini-slump, losing to St. Mary's the
following afternoon then dropping
two of three at Arizona State the
next weekend. Eventually it would
be the Washington sweep that

helped pull Stanford out of its
funk.
Will the Cardinal have similar
success against the Huskies this
time around, then? Picked to finish
10th in the Pac-12 ahead of only
conference newcomer Utah
Colorado doesn't have a varsity
baseball team Washington has
been moderately successful so far,
taking three of six games from the
middle-of-the-pack Oregon
schools. Offensively, the Huskies
are only in the top five in the con
ference in two statistical cate
gories: hit by pitches (35) and sac
rifice bunts (27).
The squad's fielding is a whole
different story. The Huskies are
second in the country in fielding
percentage, and their .983 mark is
within one thousandth of nation
al leader Radford, out of the Big
South. Though Washington has
only turned seven double plays
all season good for 289 th in
the nation that's in part be
cause it doesn't allow many base
runners, ranking in the top 10 na
tionally in hits allowed per game
(7.22)."
The Husky rotation is led by
righty ace Aaron West, who has
gone 4-1 with a 2.01 ERA to start
his junior season. West sets up an

interesting matchup with Stanford
junior righthander Mark Appel (3-
1), who was in position for the win
last Friday before the Cardinal
gave up five runs in the bottom of
the ninth at Arizona.
Getting over those road woes is
crucial at this point of the season
for Stanford, which would jettison
itself into the top half of the Pac-12
with a sweep this weekend.
"I think we've got our confi
dence up," Piscotty said. "We have

two days off. We're going to prac
tice, get better and take that confi
dence and go into the weekend."
The series is moved up a day for
Easter Sunday, so Appel and West
will square off tonight at 5 p.m. at
Husky Ballpark in a rare Thursday
opener. Tomorrow night's game
also begins at 5 p.m. in Seattle be
fore the 1 p.m. finale on Saturday.

No one likes to be 10th in an 11-team con
ference, even just two weeks into the Pac-12
season. Yet that's exactly where the No. 6 Stan
ford baseball team stands at the moment after
four consecutive Pac-12 losses, and the Cardi
nal needs to get on the right track quickly if it

wants to compete in the nation's best confer
ence.
A three-game series starting tonight against
a weak Washington (16-9,3-3 Pac-12) squad in
Seattle looks like an opportunity to do just that
for Stanford (17-6,2-4), but there are no sure
things in college baseball, especially when you
have gone a meager 4-4 on the road to open up
the season. Add that to a stretch that saw the
Cardinal play eight games in nine days, ending
in a thrilling 9-8 win over St. Mary's on Monday,
and this series could prove as challenging as
any on Stanford's upcoming conference sched
ule.

"Our coach always says that you've just got
to come to play every day, no matter what," said
sophomore Danny Diekroeger, who had the
game-winning hit over the Gaels as a 12th-in
ning pinch hitter. "You can't make excuses
[when it comes to fatigue]. You've got to go out
and play, because the other team will always
come to play."

Huskies at Sunken Diamond a year ago

ed Monday night on the Farm. The
extra-inning victory hardly resem
bled Stanford's other wins over the
Gaels earlier in the season by the
combined score of 15-4, as the Car
dinal needed a five-run, ninth-in
ning rally and some clutch relief
pitching from junior Stephen Pis

skills at third base and at the plate.
"I think this win shows that
we're not mentally fatigued after
getting beat three times [at No. 8

game.
It was hardly the first time that
a recent Stanford team had battled
back to claim a win at the tail end
of a slump. After opening its Pac
-10 season with four straight wins a
year ago, the Cardinal lost five
conference contests in a row, in
cluding a disastrous home sweep
by Oregon State. With No. 11
UCLA in town the following
weekend, Stanford trailed the
Bruins 4-1 going into the bottom
of the ninth in the rubber matchup,

each team already having claimed
a game in the series.
UCLA got two quick outs to
seemingly crush the Cardinal's
chances, but a base hit and a walk
set up then-sophomore center
fielder Jake Stewart for an RBI
single and senior catcher Zach
Jones for a game-tying double. A
blooper from sophomore short
stop Kenny Diekroeger sealed the
5-4 win and sent the Bruins pack
ing with stunned looks on their
faces.
Those shocked expressions re
turned to Sunken Diamond on
Monday night, with the Gaels leav
ing town with a last-minute loss of
their own.
"It's really similar to [the
UCLA game]," Danny
Diekroeger said. "Guys just came
and got hits and showed how much
heart we have to come back and
put up five runs in the bottom of
the ninth."
Last year's comeback win was
followed by a midweek victory
over Cal two days later, but the
Cardinal quickly fell back into a
mini-slump, losing to St. Mary's the
following afternoon then dropping
two of three at Arizona State the
next weekend. Eventually it would
be the Washington sweep that

helped pull Stanford out of its
funk.

success against the Huskies this
time around, then? Picked to finish

baseball team Washington has
been moderately successful so far,
taking three of six games from the
middle-of-the-pack Oregon
schools. Offensively, the Huskies
are only in the top five in the con
ference in two statistical cate
gories: hit by pitches (35) and sac
rifice bunts (27).
The squad's fielding is a whole
different story. The Huskies are
second in the country in fielding
percentage, and their .983 mark is
within one thousandth of nation
al leader Radford, out of the Big
South. Though Washington has
only turned seven double plays
all season good for 289 th in
the nation that's in part be
cause it doesn't allow many base
runners, ranking in the top 10 na
tionally in hits allowed per game
(7.22)."
The Husky rotation is led by
righty ace Aaron West, who has
gone 4-1 with a 2.01 ERA to start
his junior season. West sets up an

interesting matchup with Stanford
junior righthander Mark Appel (3-
1), who was in position for the win
last Friday before the Cardinal
gave up five runs in the bottom of
the ninth at Arizona.
Getting over those road woes is
crucial at this point of the season
for Stanford, which would jettison
itself into the top half of the Pac-12
with a sweep this weekend.
