## Stopping skid in Seattle CARDINAL TRAVELS TO FACE WASHINGTON 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
No one likes to be 10th in an 11-team con
ference, even just two weeks into the Pac-12
season. Yet that's exactly where the No. 6 Stan
ford baseball team stands at the moment after
four consecutive Pac-12 losses, and the Cardi
nal needs to get on the right track quickly if it

wants to compete in the nation's best confer
ence.
A three-game series starting tonight against
a weak Washington (16-9,3-3 Pac-12) squad in
Seattle looks like an opportunity to do just that
for Stanford (17-6,2-4), but there are no sure
things in college baseball, especially when you
have gone a meager 4-4 on the road to open up
the season. Add that to a stretch that saw the
Cardinal play eight games in nine days, ending
in a thrilling 9-8 win over St. Mary's on Monday,
and this series could prove as challenging as
any on Stanford's upcoming conference sched
ule.

"Our coach always says that you've just got
to come to play every day, no matter what," said
sophomore Danny Diekroeger, who had the
game-winning hit over the Gaels as a 12th-in
ning pinch hitter. "You can't make excuses
[when it comes to fatigue]. You've got to go out
and play, because the other team will always
come to play."
Even though the Cardinal easily swept the
Huskies at Sunken Diamond a year ago
Washington finished last in the Pac-10 you
never know when an opponent is going to be a
