# Games and grad school
## 
### ESTELA GO 
Melanie Murphy, a
guard on the Stan
ford women's bas
ketball team, re
ceived a full ath
letic scholarship in 2006 and
planned to graduate in three years.
She wanted to "move fast" and
"keep options open." But a sea
son-ending knee injury suffered
early in her sophomore year
meant that if Murphy wanted to
return to the court, she'd have to
spend another year in school.
"I saw an opportunity to get my
master's degree in communication
for free," Murphy said. "Needless
to say, I jumped on the chance and
even thought about going for my
second master's degree in psy
chology."
And with that same stroke of
bad luck that tore her knee liga
ment, Murphy became a member
of the rare group of athletes who
are also pursuing their coterminal
masters degrees.
Twenty-nine varsity student
athletes are currently taking ad
vantage of Stanford's unique
coterminal program that allows
students to simultaneously pursue
a bachelor's degree and master's
degree, according to Jim Young,
senior assistant athletic director in
communications and media rela
tions.
There are about 800 varsity stu
dent-athletes among 6,940 total
undergraduates, which means that
more than one in 10 students is a
varsity athlete. But not all consid
er a master's program at Stanford,
where all graduate programs rank
in the nation's top five.
"We encourage all our athletes
to do the coterm program if they
can," said Beth Goode, senior as
sociate athletic director in inter
collegiate services. "But some of
the undergraduate degrees take a
lot of time, and the likelihood of
fitting it all in is a lot tougher for
others."
Athletes who coterm represent
a rare group. The 29 student-ath
letes currently coterming were ei
ther just accepted into the pro

gram and are completing their
senior years or are in their fifth
year nearing the completion of a
graduate degree. They play on 16
different teams among Stan
ford's 35 Division I varsity sports
and are enrolled in 12 different
master's programs, from engineer
ing to linguistics.
"I think having my bachelor's
in communication and my mas
ter's in the communication field
will help me in terms of creden
tials when I'm applying to jobs,"
Softball infielder Jenna Becerra
'l2 said. "I used to want to be a
professional Softball player, but
the league is very small. I figured
since I have outside interests, I'll
probably be better off financially
if I just go off my [Stanford] de
grees."
Many reasons surround the de
cision to coterm. Some, like Becer
ra, add a graduate degree to their
resumes before entering the work
force while others attempt to
delay "the real world" by spending
another year at Stanford. Howev
er, this second route is expensive,
A fifth year at Stanford purely
as a graduate student means no fi
nancial aid from the University
and tuition of about $50,000. Stu
dent athletes who play all four
years and exhaust their eligibility
meaning they did not redshirt
one year are ineligible for a
fifth year of athletic scholarship.
The Stanford Athletics Depart
ment receives applications re
questing financial aid for a fifth
year and awards about 20 student
athletes each year with some per
centage of a scholarship.
"Our priority in allocating the
limited funding we have is in get
ting that first undergraduate de
gree so we'll help those students
first," Goode said. "If we can help
student-athletes beyond that as it
relates to finishing a coterm or get
ting a second major or finishing a
minor, then we'll try to help as
much as we can. But it's all based
on our budget and what the re
quests are in a given year."
