# How Card fell short five times
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
When the confetti fell
on the 40-0 Baylor
women's basket
ball team on Tues
day night, it wasn't
that surprising. After all, the Bears
were untouchable this season, and
had relatively little trouble dusting off
the Cardinal in the semifinal on Sun
day night. But the whole time the
Bears were cutting the nets down, I
kept wondering just how the Cardi
nal, which had been to live straight
Final Fours, hadn't managed to win
one, just one, title during that time.
When you go to the Final Four five
times in a row, you almost expect a
team to back into a championship
win. If you keep giving yourself
chances to win it all, you're eventually
bound to win one, right?
Unfortunately, that's not the case.
Instead, the 2007-2012 Stanford
Cardinal is destined to go down in his
tory as the women's college basket
ball version of the early '9os Buffalo
Bills a great team filled with great
players, but not champions.
The sad thing is, the Cardinal's
championship window, at least for
now, seems to have passed. It's hard to
imagine that next year's team will be
nearly as competitive or complete.
Without Nneka Ogwumike and with
a group of relatively inexperienced
freshmen expected to step up and
play major roles, the Cardinal will
probably still be the favorites to win
the Pac-12, but not national title con
tenders. So just how did this window,
when Stanford was so good for so
long, pass without the Cardinal taking
home a national championship?
Surely it's not talent Candice
Wiggins, Jayne Appel and Nnemkadi
Ogwumike are three of the greatest
players ever to play college basket
ball. It's definitely not the coach —
Tara VanDerveer is already in the
Hall of Fame for her efforts as a
coach. So why has the Cardinal been
unable to bring a big, shiny trophy
home to the Farm over the last five
Final Fours?
In three of those five trips, it's safe
to say that the Cardinal was beaten
by better teams. This year, Baylor
and Brittney Griner were not going
to be stopped on their road to a title.
1n2009, an undefeated UConn team
that was in the middle of the pro
gram's 90-game win streak handily
defeated Stanford in the semifinals,
83-64, and in 2008, the Tennessee
Volunteers, led by all-universe for
ward Candace Parker, smashed the
Cardinal in the title game, 64-48.

That said, Stanford did have two
very real chances to win a title dur
ing that stretch. In 2010, the Cardi
nal held an eight-point halftime
lead over the same UConn team
that had beaten it the year before,
but eventually succumbed to the
talented duo of Maya Moore and
Tina Charles, 53-47. While the Car
dinal did have four superstars on
that team Appel, Ogwumike,
Jeanette Pohlen and Kayla Peder
sen bad luck, coupled with an
ankle injury to Appel, was the main
factor that kept the Cardinal from
bringing home a ring. Appel, suffer
ing from a sprained ankle and a
stress fracture in the same foot,
went 0-for-12 from the field that
night in San Antonio, scored zero
points and ultimately failed to be
the difference-maker that she had
been in every game in her career up
to that point.
And as tough as that loss was to
swallow, Stanford's best chance to
win a title was last year, when Nneka
Ogwumike, Chiney Ogwumike,
Pedersen and Pohlen all had mag
nificent seasons but it all fell
apart in six terrible minutes in the
semifinal game against Texas A&M.
Leading by 10 points with six min
utes left to play in the game, every
thing began to implode for the Car
dinal. First, the Aggies cranked up
the defensive pressure. Next, several
dubious foul calls started to go
against the Cardinal. Finally, Chiney
Ogwumike fouled out, leaving Stan
ford without its best defensive play
er, and the collapse was complete.
The Aggies went on to win the na
tional title, but you couldn't help but
feel that the Cardinal players had al
most been cheated out of the nation
al title that was supposed to finally
be theirs.
Over these past five Final Four
runs, it's been extremely disappoint
ing that the Cardinal hasn't taken
home a title, mostly because it has
played so well for so long and still
hasn't achieved its ultimate goal.
Sometimes you get beat by a better
team. Sometimes you're victims of
bad luck and injuries. Other times
there's really no way to explain just
how you couldn't pull off the win.
Altogether, it appears the moral
of the story is clear: No matter how
hard you've worked, and no matter
how many times you get a chance to
achieve your goal, you're not guar
anteed anything. And that's a lesson
the Cardinal has learned in all too
bitter a fashion.

most been cheated out of the nation
al title that was supposed to finally
be theirs.
Over these past five Final Four
runs, it's been extremely disappoint
ing that the Cardinal hasn't taken
home a title, mostly because it has
played so well for so long and still
hasn't achieved its ultimate goal.
Sometimes you get beat by a better
team. Sometimes you're victims of
bad luck and injuries. Other times
there's really no way to explain just
how you couldn't pull off the win.
Altogether, it appears the moral
of the story is clear: No matter how
hard you've worked, and no matter
how many times you get a chance to
achieve your goal, you're not guar
anteed anything. And that's a lesson
the Cardinal has learned in all too
bitter a fashion.

Stanford did have
two very real chances
to win a title during
that stretch.
When the confetti fell
on the 40-0 Baylor
women's basket
ball team on Tues
day night, it wasn't
that surprising. After all, the Bears
were untouchable this season, and
had relatively little trouble dusting off
the Cardinal in the semifinal on Sun
day night. But the whole time the
Bears were cutting the nets down, I
kept wondering just how the Cardi
nal, which had been to live straight
Final Fours, hadn't managed to win
one, just one, title during that time.
When you go to the Final Four five
times in a row, you almost expect a
team to back into a championship
win. If you keep giving yourself
chances to win it all, you're eventually
bound to win one, right?
Unfortunately, that's not the case.
Instead, the 2007-2012 Stanford
Cardinal is destined to go down in his
tory as the women's college basket
ball version of the early '9os Buffalo
Bills a great team filled with great
players, but not champions.
The sad thing is, the Cardinal's
championship window, at least for
now, seems to have passed. It's hard to
imagine that next year's team will be
nearly as competitive or complete.
Without Nneka Ogwumike and with
a group of relatively inexperienced
freshmen expected to step up and
play major roles, the Cardinal will
probably still be the favorites to win
the Pac-12, but not national title con
tenders. So just how did this window,
when Stanford was so good for so
long, pass without the Cardinal taking
home a national championship?
Surely it's not talent Candice
Wiggins, Jayne Appel and Nnemkadi
Ogwumike are three of the greatest
players ever to play college basket
ball. It's definitely not the coach —
Tara VanDerveer is already in the
Hall of Fame for her efforts as a
coach. So why has the Cardinal been
unable to bring a big, shiny trophy
home to the Farm over the last five
Final Fours?
In three of those five trips, it's safe
to say that the Cardinal was beaten
by better teams. This year, Baylor
and Brittney Griner were not going
to be stopped on their road to a title.
1n2009, an undefeated UConn team
that was in the middle of the pro
gram's 90-game win streak handily
defeated Stanford in the semifinals,
83-64, and in 2008, the Tennessee
Volunteers, led by all-universe for
ward Candace Parker, smashed the
Cardinal in the title game, 64-48.

That said, Stanford did have two
very real chances to win a title dur
ing that stretch. In 2010, the Cardi
nal held an eight-point halftime
lead over the same UConn team
that had beaten it the year before,
but eventually succumbed to the
talented duo of Maya Moore and
Tina Charles, 53-47. While the Car
dinal did have four superstars on
that team Appel, Ogwumike,
Jeanette Pohlen and Kayla Peder
sen bad luck, coupled with an
ankle injury to Appel, was the main
factor that kept the Cardinal from
bringing home a ring. Appel, suffer
ing from a sprained ankle and a
stress fracture in the same foot,
went 0-for-12 from the field that
night in San Antonio, scored zero
points and ultimately failed to be
the difference-maker that she had
been in every game in her career up
to that point.
And as tough as that loss was to
swallow, Stanford's best chance to
win a title was last year, when Nneka
Ogwumike, Chiney Ogwumike,
Pedersen and Pohlen all had mag
nificent seasons but it all fell
apart in six terrible minutes in the
semifinal game against Texas A&M.
Leading by 10 points with six min
utes left to play in the game, every
thing began to implode for the Car
dinal. First, the Aggies cranked up
the defensive pressure. Next, several
dubious foul calls started to go
against the Cardinal. Finally, Chiney
Ogwumike fouled out, leaving Stan
ford without its best defensive play
er, and the collapse was complete.
The Aggies went on to win the na
tional title, but you couldn't help but
feel that the Cardinal players had al
most been cheated out of the nation
al title that was supposed to finally
be theirs.
