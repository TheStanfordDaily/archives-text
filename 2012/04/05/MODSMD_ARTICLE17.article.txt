# How Card fell short five times

### Jack Blanchat 
When the confetti fell
on the 40-0 Baylor
women's basket
ball team on Tues
day night, it wasn't
that surprising. After all, the Bears
were untouchable this season, and
had relatively little trouble dusting off
the Cardinal in the semifinal on Sun
day night. But the whole time the
Bears were cutting the nets down, I
kept wondering just how the Cardi
nal, which had been to live straight
Final Fours, hadn't managed to win
one, just one, title during that time.
When you go to the Final Four five
times in a row, you almost expect a
team to back into a championship
win. If you keep giving yourself
chances to win it all, you're eventually
bound to win one, right?
Unfortunately, that's not the case.
Instead, the 2007-2012 Stanford
Cardinal is destined to go down in his
tory as the women's college basket
ball version of the early '9os Buffalo
Bills a great team filled with great
players, but not champions.
The sad thing is, the Cardinal's
championship window, at least for
now, seems to have passed. It's hard to
imagine that next year's team will be
nearly as competitive or complete.
Without Nneka Ogwumike and with
a group of relatively inexperienced
freshmen expected to step up and
play major roles, the Cardinal will
probably still be the favorites to win
the Pac-12, but not national title con
tenders. So just how did this window,
when Stanford was so good for so
long, pass without the Cardinal taking
home a national championship?
Surely it's not talent Candice
Wiggins, Jayne Appel and Nnemkadi
Ogwumike are three of the greatest
players ever to play college basket
ball. It's definitely not the coach â€”
