# PERFECT SINCE FINALS

### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
After a two-week break for fi
nals, the No. 6 Stanford women's
tennis team got right back into ac
tion with four dual matches in eight
days. The Cardinal (14-0, 6-0 Pac
-12) showed no signs of rust, though,
winning all four dual matches with
out dropping a single point.
Stanford's first match after the
break, a March 25 matchup with
No. 38 Washington State, was can
celed due to rain, so the Cardinal
did not get underway until March

28, when the squad traveled to Las
Vegas to take on No. 51 UNLV.
The extra layoff was not an
issue, though, as Stanford swept
the three doubles matches against
the Lady Rebels, losing just six
games in total. Singles was similar
ly dominated by the Cardinal, as
Stanford dropped just one set en
route to a 7-0 win.Tlie lower courts
of doubles particularly favored
Stanford, as the Cardinal lost only
20 games in eight sets on courts
three through six. Including dou
bles, Stanford's junior Stacey Tan,
freshman EllenTsay, senior Veron

ica Li and junior Natalie Dillon
won 65 games and lost just 22.
After dismantling UNLV, the
Cardinal returned to conference
play, hosting the Arizona schools
over the weekend. The results
were similar, as Stanford rolled
over No. 27 Arizona State 7-0 be
fore beating No. 28 Arizona 4-0.
Against the Sun Devils, Stan
ford again lost just one set en route
to the sweep. In singles, Arizona
State reached five games in just
two of the 10 sets on the way to its
first shutout loss of the season. In
juries also played a role, as the Sun

Devils were forced to forfeit the
third doubles match and the sixth
singles match.
The Cardinal had similar suc
cess against the Wildcats before
rain ended the match early. The
threat of bad weather caused the
singles matches to go before the
doubles matches, and when sopho
more Nicole Gibbs finished off her
match on court one to give Stan
ford a 4-0 lead, the match was
called. Junior Mallory Burdette,
Tsay and Li also won in straight
sets, while Tan and Dillon did not
complete their matches.
Stanford ran its shutout streak
to six consecutive matches with an
easy 7-0 win over Cal Poly on
Wednesday afternoon. The Mus
tangs (7-7) are just the fourth un
ranked team Stanford has faced
this year, and they were no match
for the Cardinal at Taube Family
Tennis Center. Stanford won every
set and needed just one tiebreaker
to dispatch Cal Poly.
In doubles, Stanford took care
of business on all three courts, win
ning 8-3, 8-3 and 8-4. Head coach
Lele Forood changed up the sin
gles lineup, giving Tan a break and
allowing sophomore Amelia Her
ring to secure her first win in a sin
gles dual match. Gibbs and Bur
dette had no trouble on the top
two courts, as each won by an iden
tical 6-1,6-1 score. Herring closed
out the sweep with a 7-6,6-4 win on
court six.
The Cardinal will look to con
tinue its shutout streak against an
other unranked opponent in its
final nonconference match of the
season when Stanford hosts Santa
Clara this Saturday at 9:30 a.m.
