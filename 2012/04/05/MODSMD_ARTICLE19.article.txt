## Softball struggles over spring break 
### â€” Jack Blanchat 
The Stanford softball team was
riding high going into spring
break, having won 19 games in a
row, but the week off from school
was not good to the Cardinal, as it
went a miserable 2-5 during the
break.

In its first series of Pac-12 play,
the No. 14 Cardinal couldn't take
a single game from archrival Cal,
which swept all three games at
Smith Family Stadium. Friday's
contest was a 9-0 blowout that saw
the Bears give junior pitcher Tea
gan Gerhart just her second loss
of the season, dropping the pitch
er's record to 20-2.

After a rainout of Saturday's
contest, the Bears took both
halves of Sunday's doubleheader,
snagging a 4-3 victory. The Cardi
nal couldn't complete a comeback
after getting down 3-0 in the first
inning, and then Cal completed
the sweep with an 8-0 win, again at
the expense of Gerhart, who saw
her struggles in the circle continue
for the second straight game.

Stanford rebounded to pick up
a 9-2 midweek win against Santa
Clara, then traveled to Arizona to
take on the Wildcats in a three
game set.
The Cardinal continued its
winning ways in the Friday game
against Arizona, as Gerhart
tossed a two-hitter and struck out
nine in a 4-1 win, as senior Maya
Burns paced the Card by going 2-
for-3 at the plate with two RBI.
The win streak wouldn't last
for long, though; the Wildcats re
sponded by hitting around fresh
man pitcher Nyree White for
eight earned runs in a 9-1 Arizona
win. The Wildcats then picked up
the rubber game with a 3-1 win on
Sunday to end the Cardinal's road
trip on a sour note.
Stanford now returns home to
continue Pac-12 play at home
against Oregon this weekend, as it
continues its tough schedule with
nine conference games over the
next 11 days. The Ducks and Car
dinal square off at Smith Family
Stadium on Thursday and Friday
at 7 p.m. and finish the series Sat
urday at noon.
