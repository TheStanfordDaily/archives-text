## GSB receives platinum LEED award Knight Management Center earns highest sustainability certification 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
The Knight Management Center, which
became the new home to the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) over the past
year, achieved one of its major goals by re
ceiving the U.S. Green Building Council's
LEED Platinum certification the highest
level of sustainable building award current
ly possible late last month.
The Knight Center earned 60 accredita

platinum level certification.
"The idea behind reaching the highest
possible sustainability rating was to inspire
our students to promote sustainable prac

water at the facility itself," said Raj Chel

LEED, which stands for Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design, is an ini
tiative by the U.S. Green Building Council to
promote sustainable building development.
Factors from different areas of energy
sustainability contributed to the Knight
Center's high score, according to Chellaraj.
Narrow buildings that allow for 90 percent
of rooms to use natural lighting reduce the
electricity load of the facility. In addition,
photovoltaic panels produce 12.5 percent of
the electricity used by the building, and 80
percent of water used in the facility is either
collected rainwater or reclaimed water.
These sustainability measures have been
in place since the Knight Center opened in
April 2011; however, the U.S. Green Build
ing Council has a lengthy review process to
ensure that these energy measures perform
as expected before awarding LEED certifi
cations, Chellaraj said. That process con
cluded in late March.
"After a year in our new space, the
Knight Management Center has exceeded
our expectations," Chellaraj said.
Students and faculty alike have found the
new campus to be a vast improvement over
