## GSB receives platinum LEED award Knight Management Center earns highest sustainability certification 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
The Knight Management Center, which
became the new home to the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) over the past
year, achieved one of its major goals by re
ceiving the U.S. Green Building Council's
LEED Platinum certification the highest
level of sustainable building award current
ly possible late last month.
The Knight Center earned 60 accredita
tion points, well beyond the 52 required for
platinum level certification.
"The idea behind reaching the highest
possible sustainability rating was to inspire
our students to promote sustainable prac
tices in the future, as well to save energy and
water at the facility itself," said Raj Chel
laraj, associate dean for finance and admin
istration at the GSB, in an email to the Daily.
LEED, which stands for Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design, is an ini
tiative by the U.S. Green Building Council to
promote sustainable building development.
Factors from different areas of energy
sustainability contributed to the Knight
Center's high score, according to Chellaraj.
Narrow buildings that allow for 90 percent
of rooms to use natural lighting reduce the
electricity load of the facility. In addition,
photovoltaic panels produce 12.5 percent of
the electricity used by the building, and 80
percent of water used in the facility is either
collected rainwater or reclaimed water.
These sustainability measures have been
in place since the Knight Center opened in
April 2011; however, the U.S. Green Build
ing Council has a lengthy review process to
ensure that these energy measures perform
as expected before awarding LEED certifi
cations, Chellaraj said. That process con
cluded in late March.
"After a year in our new space, the
Knight Management Center has exceeded
our expectations," Chellaraj said.
Students and faculty alike have found the
new campus to be a vast improvement over

the previous GSB site, which cur

"Night and day," said Jeff Ca
bili, director of program and busi
ness development for the GSB.
"There's no comparison: it's fan
tastic."
The Knight Center project
sought to increase the natural
light and open spaces in the GSB
to make classes feel more open
and inclusive.
Cabili said that the windows
and natural light make a big dif
ference from the old facility, mak
ing the rooms feel open and
breathable. Fie also said that class
rooms have been restructured to
offer tiered seating, allowing him
to look directly at students as he
teaches.
Another goal of the project
was to make the Knight Center a
gathering area for people outside
the business program, in addition
to business students. The facility
features over 50 percent open
space, and centers around the Ar
buckle Cafe, an indoor-outdoor
dining facility that draws all kinds
of students to the Knight Center.
One feature of the Knight
Center that has turned out to be a
major improvement in the eyes of
many students is the d.School
CoLab located on the edge of the
Knight Center.
The CoLab is a collaborative

facility run by both the GSB and
Stanford's Hasso-Plattner Insti
tute of Design. The CoLab runs
programs that draw students from
all of the University's schools to
work together on hands-on proj
ects in a setting that Chellaraj de
scribed as "garage-like," in the
start-up garage sense.
"I feel like it's helping to inte
grate the business school a little
more," said Paige Rosetti, an
MBA student, of the CoLab.
CEMEX auditorium, the
Knight Center's largest gathering
space, has also become a major
campus venue for events and con
ferences, attracting undergrads
and graduate students from
across the University.
The school's push for more in
dividualized spaces has also
panned out to be a major im
provement over the old GSB.
Rooms called "breakout rooms"
are available for students to study
and collaborate in freely.
Chellaraj said that some facul
ty members have taken advantage
of the new, flexible spaces in cre
ative ways.
For example, he said that for
mer U.S. Secretary of State Con
doleezza Rice and former U.K.
Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs David
Miliband co-led the seminar Cri
sis Management on the World
Stage using the rooms.
