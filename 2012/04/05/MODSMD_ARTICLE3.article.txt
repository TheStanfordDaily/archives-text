# Bill Gates shares optimism
## Philanthropist visits the Farm to discuss innovation, developing world 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE MARGARET RAWSON 
Bill Gates brought a different message
to campus than many visiting CEOs and
speakers during a presentation to a packed
Cubberley Auditorium Wednesday after
noon. The private sector can't do it all, the
Microsoft founder said, emphasizing the
importance of foreign aid and philanthro
py to tackle the most pressing global chal
lenges.
Gates encouraged students to travel to
places of poverty and expose themselves to
these development issues, noting that noth
ing can replace on-the-ground experience.
"As long as you have the awareness of
these issues, you find yourself drawn in and
deeply engaged," Gates said after the event
in an interview with The Daily. "My main
advice would be, ideally before you be
come totally pulled into something, take a
chance to go out to visit Africa, see what's
great and see what's challenging."
"As I look back on my university expe
rience I wouldn't change anything but one
thing, which is that I definitely got through
school without having a sense of how the
poorest in the world lived," he told the au
dience assembled in Cubberley.
Gates spoke primarily on health and
agriculture, the two main areas of focus for
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
which Gates founded and currently co
chairs.
Gates brings optimism to his philan
thropic work and sought to impress this on
his audience.
"I want to give you a sense of optimism,
excitement about the progress we're mak
ing," he said, beginning his presentation
with graphs showing dramatic progress in
global child mortality, hunger and poverty.
Such upward trends, however, do not al
ways reflect the situation in the poorest
parts of the world, he said.

I define [innovation] very broadly. It doesn't
necessarily mean a new piece of software.
