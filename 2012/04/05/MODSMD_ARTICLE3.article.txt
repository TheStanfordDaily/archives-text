# Bill Gates shares optimism
## Philanthropist visits the Farm to discuss innovation, developing world 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE MARGARET RAWSON 
Bill Gates brought a different message
to campus than many visiting CEOs and
speakers during a presentation to a packed
Cubberley Auditorium Wednesday after
noon. The private sector can't do it all, the
Microsoft founder said, emphasizing the
importance of foreign aid and philanthro
py to tackle the most pressing global chal
lenges.
Gates encouraged students to travel to
places of poverty and expose themselves to
these development issues, noting that noth
ing can replace on-the-ground experience.
"As long as you have the awareness of
these issues, you find yourself drawn in and
deeply engaged," Gates said after the event
in an interview with The Daily. "My main
advice would be, ideally before you be
come totally pulled into something, take a
chance to go out to visit Africa, see what's
great and see what's challenging."
"As I look back on my university expe
rience I wouldn't change anything but one
thing, which is that I definitely got through
school without having a sense of how the
poorest in the world lived," he told the au
dience assembled in Cubberley.
Gates spoke primarily on health and
agriculture, the two main areas of focus for
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
which Gates founded and currently co
chairs.
Gates brings optimism to his philan
thropic work and sought to impress this on
his audience.
"I want to give you a sense of optimism,
excitement about the progress we're mak
ing," he said, beginning his presentation
with graphs showing dramatic progress in
global child mortality, hunger and poverty.
Such upward trends, however, do not al
ways reflect the situation in the poorest
parts of the world, he said.

I define [innovation] very broadly. It doesn't
necessarily mean a new piece of software.
BILL GATES, Microsoft founder

Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, addressed Stanford faculty, administrators and students
Wednesday afternoon about the challenges of innovating for developing nations.
"If you take Africa as a whole,
because of population growth,
they've made very limited
progress against their poverty
percentage," Gates said, stressing
the importance of continued aid
and focus on the continent.
"I'm very optimistic that we
can make progress on these
things," he said. "The thing that
makes me impatient about this,
though, is that the normal market
signals of what should we work
on, what's a priority, don't cause
us to prioritize this work."
Gates cited that more money
has been spent developing drugs
to combat baldness than to fight
malaria.
"Baldness is a bad problem,"
he joked, "but it takes awhile to
get it. You can buy a hat. Hats
aren't that expensive."
The challenge, Gates said, is to
elevate the voices of the poor in
the marketplace. Though noting
that he does not advocate an al
ternative to capitalism, he said
that the current system must be
complemented by, "enlightened
governments and philanthropy
that can be quite catalytic."
Innovation provides the key to
this effort, Gates said.
"I define [innovation] very
broadly, it doesn't necessarily
mean a new piece of software," he
said. "It can mean a bed net that
doesn't tear apart after a couple
of years because they use some
new fiber."
Gates presented three prod
ucts in particular to demonstrate
his theme of innovation, noting
that the developing world re
quires innovation where the de
veloped world does not.
"It's very different than what
the rich world needs," he said of
techniques to overcome techno
logical obstacles in the develop
ing world. "The rich world doesn't
care that its vaccines have to be
refrigerated."
The Gates Foundation has been
integral in manufacturing and dis
tributing a vaccine for Meningitis
A, which recurs every few years in
the "meningitis belt" of sub-Saha
ran Africa. Partnering with Indian
manufacturer Serum, the founda
tion hopes implementation of the
vaccine will decrease disease levels
by at least 90 percent.
The vaccine, the first devel
oped specifically for Africa, only
needs to be administered once
and is manufactured cheaply.
Fifty million people have re
ceived vaccinations so far, Gates
said.
The next innovation Gates
highlighted touched on what

could be a culturally sensitive
issue: circumcision. While an
AIDS vaccine may be over a
decade away from development,
male circumcision has been
shown to reduce the transmission
of AIDS by over 60 percent,
Gates said.
Gates highlighted a circular,
plastic ring, "Shang Ring" or
"PrePex," that renders circumci
sion surgery much more efficient,
sometimes taking only a few min
utes.
"It reduces the pain involved,
it reduces the cost involved,"
Gates said about the ring, adding
that it would cost about $1 billion
to roll out circumcision initiatives
of this kind across Africa.
"It's just plastic," he said of the
simple solution to the complex
health issue.
The agriculture advance Gates
presented also emphasized a sim
ple solution to a devastating
problem. A more efficient, triple
layer storage bag now stops wee
vil infestations in cassava, a pro
tein-rich crop in West Africa.
With two layers of polyethylene
and an outside layer of plastic
mesh to trap and suffocate wee
vils, these bags make a huge im
pact on post-harvest loss: 1.7 mil
lion households were able to in
crease their income by $l5O dol
lars, or 30 percent, due to the
triple-layered bags.
After presenting these innova
tions, Gates asked about the fu
ture, "how hopeful should we
be?" He answered his own ques
tion: "Well, I would say quite
hopeful."
Prior to his talk, Gates met
with faculty and students con
ducting research on campus relat
ed to global health.
President John Hennessy, de
spite being on sabbatical since
February, introduced Gates be
fore his talk, recalling a conversa
tion 15 years ago when Gates told
him he was "too busy" for philan
thropy.
"He said that he was too busy
leading Microsoft and didn't have
the time to be a thoughtful phi
lanthropist," Hennessy said, not
ing the dramatic shift in Gates'
career.
Gates acknowledged that he
didn't enter the world of philan
thropy until later in his life,
though he encourages Stanford
students not to wait. Following
the talk, Hennessy presented
Gates with a solar lantern created
by students in Design for Ex
treme Affordability, a course that
shares Gates' mission to harness
innovation to solve problems in
the developing world.
