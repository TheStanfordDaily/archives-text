## Summers debates Taylor on growth policy 
### AARON SEKHRI 
Economists Lawrence Summers and
John Taylor Ph.D. '73 debated the implica
tions of federal economic policy Wednes
day afternoon as part of an event hosted by
the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy
Research (SIEPR) in Cemex Auditorium.
Summers, who served as U.S. Secretary
of the Treasury from 1999 to 2001, president
of Harvard University from 2001 to 2006
and director of the National Economic
Council for President Barack Obama
through November 2010, addressed the
topic "Are Government Interventions an
Important Cause of Our Recent Economic

Problems?" along with Taylor.
Wednesday's event was the second of
two debates, after a February meeting by
the pair at Harvard.
During the debate, moderated by
SIEPR director John Shoven following 10
minutes of opening remarks from each
speaker, Taylor argued for the affirmative
and Summers asserted the negative, that
government interventions are not an im
portant cause of recent economic woes in
the United States.
Taylor, a government economist during
multiple administrations, including those of
George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush,
began the proceedings by rebuking the ac

tions of an "interventionist" government,
which he claimed led to America's anemic
recovery, in which unemployment lingered
and job creation remained stagnant.
Taylor argued that the Obama adminis
tration's initiatives created a grim picture,
claiming that they exacerbated, rather than
softened, the fallout from the 2008 financial
crisis.
Taylor said that the "on again, off again"
actions of the federal government created
an economic climate of "uncertainty and
unpredictability," and that actions that de
viated from established norms, historical
precedent and "sound rules" were
one of the key causes of our recent
economic predicament.
In a reference to his personal
research, Taylor said he had found
that governmental fiscal policy
created a "quantitative drag on
growth" and that pertinent histor
ical evidence showed that govern
ment transfers and purchases had
only a limited effect on economic
recovery.
Taylor closed with the ominous
statement that "failed" adminis
tration policies have "forced us to
relearn what we should have
learned 30 years ago, causing
enormous pain to people and the
economy."
Deferring to Taylor's expertise
on monetary policy, Summers fo
cused on the area of fiscal policy,
defending its implementation and
efficacy.
Summers argued that the stim
ulus was a sensible and necessary
measure, and one that prevented
an even greater crisis.
Noting that the origins of the
crisis "lie not in the stars, but in the
failure of the government to regu
late financial firms adequately,"
Summers emphasized the need of
smart government "activism"
when approaching problems as
calamitous as those faced at the
beginning of the economic crisis.
Summers touted the stimulat
ing effect of fiscal expansion at a
time when interest rates were ef
fectively at zero. He grounded his
argument in the counterfactual
scenarios that could
have emerged without govern
ment intervention, and in compar
ative assessments of places where

fiscal expansion had or had not
taken place.
Taylor and Summers found
areas of consensus in the need for
predictability, long-term ap
proaches to pressing economic
problems and intelligent banking
regulation, but they diverged on a
greater number of topics.
Taylor criticized the Obama
administration's use of unpre
dictable and unprecedented gov
ernmental actions during the cri
sis, to which Summers responded,
"Battlefield medicine is never
perfect," underscoring his stead
fast position that the magnitude of
the recession required strong gov
ernment activism.
Taylor maintained his empha
sis on data and historical evi
dence.
The debate audience asked a
diverse array of questions, engag
ing in topics such as healthcare,
real estate, bank capital limits and
bailouts.
Students and organizers of the
event said it was well received.
"It's just great to have so many
students interested in such a de
bate," Shoven said. "This was the
largest SIEPR Associate event
ever, with 500 people in atten
dance, and the debate was a good
balance of agreement and dis
agreement."
Otis Reid ' 12, chair of Stan
ford in Government, agreed that
he enjoyed watching the debate,
but had a complaint about the
substance of some of the argu
ments.
"It was fantastic to watch two
great figures in a such an honest
debate," Reid said. "I just wish
there had been more hard evi
dence on their parts, more show
and a little less tell."
