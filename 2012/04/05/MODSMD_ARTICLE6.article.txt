## Med school researchers discover hyper-adaptable fish 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Billy Gallagher 
Researchers at the Stanford School of Medicine
and the Broad Institute have discovered the entire
genome sequence of 21 threespine stickleback fish.
"To the uninitiated, the tiny threespine stickle
back might look like nothing more than a scruffy an
chovy with an attitude," wrote Krista Conger Ph.D.
'99 on Scope, a Stanford School of Medicine blog.
"But this tough little fish, with its characteristic finny
mohawk, is a darling of evolutionary biologists."
The researchers, led by developmental biologist
David Kingsley, noted that the stickleback demon
strates some of the most dramatic and adaptive
changes of any animal.
"Many genes work in multiple places in the body,"
Kingsley said. "If you change their protein product,
you simultaneously disrupt everything that gene
does. In contrast, if you alter the regulatory switches
that control where and when a gene is expressed, it
may become possible to confine a change to one
part of the body, or one developmental stage, for ex
ample, and avoid possible lethal consequences."
The team discovered that the fish adapts to dif
ferent environments by changing the same regions
of its genome.
In fact, they found 147 regions that varied in ma
rine-freshwater evolution. Most of these 147 regions
were small, with less than 5,000 base pairs of
DNA,4so the research team was
able to closely pinpoint which reg
ulatory regions were most affect
ed.
"Some sections of chromosomes
are chock full of differences that
are contributing to evolution,"
said Kingsley. "It is quite dramatic
to look at the entire genome and
see these powerful chunks being
used over and over again."
The researchers' findings will
appear in Nature on April 5.
