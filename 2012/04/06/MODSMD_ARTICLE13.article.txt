## EDITORIAL The 						ethics of health insurance 
### 
We tend to think about
ethics in terms of acute
crises; in this view, ethi
cal crises punctuate our mundane
day-to-day life, presenting dilem
mas that need to be solved with
reference to moral principles, in
tuitions, or other guideposts.
Rarely do we acknowledge that
more everyday decisions have
ethical or moral components, and
that "ethics" apply to a broader
range of decisions than we may
care to admit. The decision to
purchase health insurance is one
such mundane decision that we at
the Editorial Board argue should
be cast in ethical terms.
Amidst the recent political
and legal challenges to the Pa
tient Protection and Affordable
Care Act's proposed individual
insurance mandate, we argue that
the purchase of health insurance
as a healthy, young adult should
be viewed as an ethical action. If
you believe that being sick or
healthy is largely a matter of good
or bad luck that depends on ge
netics, socioeconomic status from
birth, and other outside factors,
being healthy is not a morally
praiseworthy characteristic that
should permit us the young
and healthy to forgo insur
ance. Though diluting an insur
ance risk pool may be less glam
orous than donating to charity, it
is an important action that helps
keep down premiums for the less
healthy participants. Regardless
of whether the individual insur
ance mandate stands or falls, we
should keep in mind that as
young, healthy adults, the pur
chase of health insurance should
be aimed at more than our per
sonal protection against expen
sive medical care.
The Affordable Care Act
(ACA) extends the option to stay
as a dependent on a family policy
until the age of 26, in recognition
of the fact that the transition from
college to adult independence is
often less smooth than parents
may hope. At age 26, or before
then for students who choose to
leave their parent's policy earlier,
we'll encounter the health insur
ance market: employer-spon
sored health insurance or individ
ual health insurance. If the ACA's
mandate stands, we'll be required
to purchase some form of health

insurance or pay a monetary
penalty of $695 per year (starting
in 2016, scaling up from $95 in
2014) or 2.5 percent of income,
whichever is higher.
As Ezra Klein points out in a
Washington Post blog entry, for
many young and healthy adults, it
makes financial sense to pay the
modest penalty and not purchase
insurance. Since insurance com
panies under the ACA aren't al
lowed to discriminate based on
preexisting health conditions,
young and healthy people can
wait until they develop a medical
condition that will be financially
burdensome, and then purchase
insurance instead of paying the
penalty.
Furthermore, the law does not
enforce payment of the penalty;
no criminal action can be pursued
against those who do not pay the
fine. So why buy insurance if
you're among the "young invinci
bles," if you're a healthy, young
adult who can afford insurance
but chooses not to purchase it be
cause you believe it is unneces
sary?
The answer, though it may be
unconvincing to some, lies in the
distinction between the "rational
choice" decision choosing to
forgo insurance and instead pay a
modest penalty and the ethi
cal decision to help uphold the
ACA's vision of expanding health
insurance coverage to millions. It
goes without saying that many
citizens do not fall in the "young"
and "invincible" category they
have expensive chronic condi
tions that require insurance. They
may be unemployed and lack af
fordable options in the individual
insurance market, and joining an
insurance risk pool as a young,
healthy adult helps insurance
companies avoid the "death spi
ral" they may face if their insur
ance pool is solely composed of
sick, expensive-to-cover citizens.
Diluting the health insurance
risk pool is not the first choice
that comes to mind when we
think about how to lead an ethi
cal life, but we at the Editorial
Board feel that regardless of
whether or not the mandate is up
held, young adults have an ethical
responsibility to aid in the acces
sibility of insurance by joining the
insurance pool.

to purchase some form of health

insurance or pay a monetary
penalty of $695 per year (starting
in 2016, scaling up from $95 in
2014) or 2.5 percent of income,
whichever is higher.
As Ezra Klein points out in a
Washington Post blog entry, for
many young and healthy adults, it
makes financial sense to pay the
modest penalty and not purchase
insurance. Since insurance com
panies under the ACA aren't al
lowed to discriminate based on
preexisting health conditions,
young and healthy people can
wait until they develop a medical
condition that will be financially
burdensome, and then purchase
insurance instead of paying the
penalty.
Furthermore, the law does not
enforce payment of the penalty;
no criminal action can be pursued
against those who do not pay the
fine. So why buy insurance if
you're among the "young invinci
bles," if you're a healthy, young
adult who can afford insurance
but chooses not to purchase it be
cause you believe it is unneces
sary?
The answer, though it may be
unconvincing to some, lies in the
distinction between the "rational
choice" decision choosing to
forgo insurance and instead pay a
modest penalty and the ethi
cal decision to help uphold the
ACA's vision of expanding health
insurance coverage to millions. It
goes without saying that many
citizens do not fall in the "young"
and "invincible" category they
have expensive chronic condi
tions that require insurance. They
may be unemployed and lack af
fordable options in the individual
insurance market, and joining an
insurance risk pool as a young,
healthy adult helps insurance
companies avoid the "death spi
ral" they may face if their insur
ance pool is solely composed of
sick, expensive-to-cover citizens.
Diluting the health insurance
risk pool is not the first choice
that comes to mind when we
think about how to lead an ethi
cal life, but we at the Editorial
Board feel that regardless of
whether or not the mandate is up
held, young adults have an ethical
responsibility to aid in the acces
sibility of insurance by joining the
insurance pool.

We tend to think about
ethics in terms of acute
crises; in this view, ethi
cal crises punctuate our mundane
day-to-day life, presenting dilem
mas that need to be solved with
reference to moral principles, in
tuitions, or other guideposts.
Rarely do we acknowledge that
more everyday decisions have
ethical or moral components, and
that "ethics" apply to a broader
range of decisions than we may
care to admit. The decision to
purchase health insurance is one
such mundane decision that we at
the Editorial Board argue should
be cast in ethical terms.
Amidst the recent political
and legal challenges to the Pa
tient Protection and Affordable
Care Act's proposed individual
insurance mandate, we argue that
the purchase of health insurance
as a healthy, young adult should
be viewed as an ethical action. If
you believe that being sick or
healthy is largely a matter of good
or bad luck that depends on ge
netics, socioeconomic status from
birth, and other outside factors,
being healthy is not a morally
praiseworthy characteristic that
should permit us the young
and healthy to forgo insur
ance. Though diluting an insur
ance risk pool may be less glam
orous than donating to charity, it
is an important action that helps
keep down premiums for the less
healthy participants. Regardless
of whether the individual insur
ance mandate stands or falls, we
should keep in mind that as
young, healthy adults, the pur
chase of health insurance should
be aimed at more than our per
sonal protection against expen
sive medical care.
The Affordable Care Act
(ACA) extends the option to stay
as a dependent on a family policy
until the age of 26, in recognition
of the fact that the transition from
college to adult independence is
often less smooth than parents
may hope. At age 26, or before
then for students who choose to
leave their parent's policy earlier,
we'll encounter the health insur
ance market: employer-spon
sored health insurance or individ
ual health insurance. If the ACA's
mandate stands, we'll be required
to purchase some form of health

insurance or pay a monetary
penalty of $695 per year (starting
in 2016, scaling up from $95 in
2014) or 2.5 percent of income,
whichever is higher.
