# EXISTENTIAL FORTUNE COOKIES
## GPA madness 
### Sebastain Gould 
I have been wanting to write
about our less-than-honorable
peers for a while now, but I
wasn't sure how I wanted to do it.
Then, an interesting article came
out last week in the San Jose Mer
cury News that talked about high
school students cheating. The arti
cle only had statistics on a couple
of schools, but I think it's reason
able to assume the rates of cheat
ing at those schools are broadly
accurate. After all, I've never
heard of one state or region being
more honest than another. With
rates as high as 70 to 80 percent at
some of these schools, we can
safely assume that this includes
students who will go to college.
After all, the biggest reason why
the students in the article cheated
was so they could get into college.
The students who don't cheat are
probably doing worse than the
students who do. These attitudes
must carry over to the students
who attend Stanford; if they did
n't, then why would people be
cheating in class?
One thing you will probably
find quickly, if you look outside of
yourself, is the prevalence of ques
tionable assistance on problem
sets and assignments. Sometimes
the cheating is blatant, like when

students in a certain economics
class sit next to each other and
copy their answers straight off an
other's homework. Not having to
show work greatly simplifies the
process of cheating, and the elec
tronic submission allows them to
submit it from their open comput
er without arousing suspicion
from the professor at the front of
the room.
Another way that students de
ceive professors is by doing sec
ondary literature research, at
times as simple as looking at
Wikipedia, and then presenting
the ideas gleaned from those
sources as their own. Presumably,
this makes them look more intel
ligent and insightful than anyone
else, and the professor will there
fore have a higher opinion of
them, leading to more generous
grading. After all, if the student al
ways comes up with such great
ideas, a less-than-stellar perform
ance on a paper can just be attrib

uted to a lack of time or some
other such excuse.
But by cheating on problem
sets with study groups, and cheat
ing on tests by using phones and
notes, these students raise the
curve, hurting students who work
alone and unaided. I don't cheat
and my GPA reflects that, but
sometimes I wonder if I should,
and this is why.
Upon graduation you are not a
finished product. There are still
schools that you must attend, on
the-job training that you must
complete and mentors to guide
you along the way. I don't think
what you learn in college actually
matters unless you are doing
something very technical. Even

then, you will probably only learn
the basics. The purpose of a col
lege education seems to be to de
velop the process through which
you learn. It is about forming
friendships and working with col
leagues. I am suggesting that
maybe, just maybe, the cheating
learned in school is essential to
working the real world. You will
form teams and groups to make
products, and people will lie, cheat
and steal their way to finishing.
The process of being immoral in
school simply prepares you to be
immoral in the workplace.
You could argue that a work
place ethic that encourages steal
ing and lying to get ahead is
wrong, as Greg Smith recently did

in his op-ed in the New York
Times. But if that is the sort of
workplace that exists, then to be
successful in it, we must do every
thing we can to get ready. There is
another option of course, and that
is to reject the cultural norm
not to cheat on exams and prob
lem sets, and not pretend to come
up with ideas that aren't your own
in section. We could blaze a new
society in which being good
means something. The problem
we have is that when everyone is
playing by the rules, breaking
them leads to a huge payoff.
