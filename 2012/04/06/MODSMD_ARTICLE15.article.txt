## Groupfood 
### Miriam Marks 
Another spring break, an
other week spent traveling
with a group. Whether you
opted for the sunny beaches of
Cabo, the intellectual thrill of a
service-learning trip or some
other adventure right in the mid
dle of that spectrum, there is likely
one element in common: you had
to spend every waking moment
with the same group of people.
To be fair, you also "got to"
spend every waking moment with
the same group of people. But for
those of us previously unused to
such a high level of human inter
action, it can get a little claustro
phobic at times. And because
you're stuck with said group in a
foreign city or country, there is
often no escape. When everyone
is struck by similar afflictions of
fatigue, irritation or hangover, it
isn't uncommon to want a vaca
tion from your vacation.
There are many, many ele
ments of group travel that can be
trying, and all of them are conve
niently highlighted in one
episode: the group meal.
First is the pain of indecision. A
critical mass of people in the
group becomes hungry, and so
popular opinion suggests that it's
time to eat. Wandering around a
neighborhood, your entire group
is inevitably split by choice: cui
sine, price, selection of cocktails,
attractiveness of the waitstaff, etc.
Your group bounces back and
forth between options, maybe
even creating a scene in the street.
After painstaking debate and
slow acquiescence, the group fi
nally decides on a restaurant.
Then you have to order, and so
begins the battle of individualists
against collectivists. Is it each per

son for his/herself, or should the
entire table approve of the other
dishes ordered? If two people
want to order the same item, will
that satisfy the tastes of those
craving variety? How many pitch
ers of sangria are enough for the
table? Each question invites new
possibilities for discord.
The situation takes a turn for
the worse when the food arrives.
Some of us are used to ordering
one item and eating only this item;
an entree ordered is a claim made
on a piece of property. Others
may assume that everything is up
for grabs, the dreaded "family
style" method of eating.
And so, before you know it, a
fork has begun to invade your
plate, and an eager voice is asking,
"Hey, can I try this? Thanks!"
without waiting for a sign of ap
proval. Can you be that person to
refuse your friend a bite of your
food? You can't. It's social suicide,
as some might say. Instead you're
forced to watch as other flocks of
forks descend upon your food. In a
moment of bitter irony, you realize
that the better your food, the less
of it you will be able to eat. Your
friends invite you to try their food,
and all you can think is, "I
would've ordered that if I wanted
it," as you force a smile and take a
small forkful.
The mutually acknowledged
split doesn't go much better. Let's
say you wisely decide to split huge
plate of nachos with the person
next to you. The nachos arrive,
and you both dig in eagerly. But
who's eating the nachos faster? It
might not be you. Soon enough
you're involuntarily caught in a
competition to keep up with your
hungry neighbor. If this person is

eating nachos faster than you, and
if you both eat until the plate of
nachos is empty, you will get fewer
nachos.
This is a particularly sensitive
issue when the bill finally arrives.
Do you pay for half the food if you
were only able to grab one-third
of it? The problem persists even if
the table generally stuck to a one
dish-per-person rule. Some peo
ple were under the impression
that they would pay only for the
food they ordered, while others
assumed that the total cost would
be split equally among the entire
group. And, unsurprisingly, you
notice that the strongest propo
nent of equal splitting is the per
son who ordered the lobster and
steak entree with a bottle of wine.
Here, in one group dinner,
dwells every problem associated
with group travel: the indecision,
the differing preferences and the
financial issues. These problems
rear their ugly heads in every as
pect of travel, from choosing a
hostel to planning tourist activi
ties and other expeditions.
Have I been too pessimistic? I
suppose I should mention that I
had a flawless group dinner at the
end of my spring break trip last
week. We had a fantastic evening
of conversation, food and bever
ages without any tension. Well, ex
cept that I had to negotiate the
plate of nachos that I split with my
neighbor, but I made sure to eat
them just as fast as he did.

Miriam hopes your group dinners
