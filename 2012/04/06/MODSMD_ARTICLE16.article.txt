## BACK ON TRACK 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 6 Stanford baseball
team appears to have resumed its
winning ways again.
The Cardinal (18-6, 3-4 Pac
-12) beat Washington (16-10,3-4)
5-2 in Seattle last night, marking
just the third time in its last 10
weekend-series games that the
squad scored at least five runs
after doing so in eight of its first
nine such contests.

Junior righthander Mark
Appel (4-1) threw his third com
plete game of the season and re
tired 15 straight batters, while
sophomore first baseman Brian
Ragira had a hit and two RBI to
extend his hit streak to nine games
in the win. Sophomore shortstop
Lonnie Kauppila also impressed
with three hits and an RBI in his
return to the lineup, having sat out
Monday against St. Mary's after
struggling both in the field and at
the plate.
The Huskies were held score
less by Appel after the first frame,
while junior righty Aaron West (4-
2) lasted just 5.1 innings and sur
rendered eight hits and three
walks to Stanford.
The Cardinal fell behind in the
first inning for the second game in
a row, as Appel walked a pair of
batters with two outs and then al
lowed a two-run double from jun
ior Jacob Lamb.
It took Stanford four innings to
end West's no-hitter, with junior
third baseman Stephen Piscotty
singling to break the ice. But the

floodgates didn't really open until
the fifth, when junior catcher Eric
Smith led off with a single. Ad
vancing on a passed ball and a fly
out from freshman designated hit
ter Alex Blandino, Smith came
around to score and narrow the
gap to one run.
Stanford then loaded the bases

and tied things up on a wild pitch,
before Ragira singled in two more
runs to make it 4-2.
Appel was dominating on the
mound, meanwhile, showing the
same brilliance that saw him
record a then-career-high nine
strikeouts against Washington last
year. Even though he only

punched out three Huskies on
Thursday, Appel gave up just four
hits, none of them coming between
the third and seventh innings.
The Cardinal defense also re
turned to form behind its ace, with
Ragira making a diving play in the
sixth inning and leftfielder Tyler
Gaffney quelling an eighth-inning
rally by throwing out junior Mac
Acker, who tried to advance from
first to third on a single but could
not beat the Stanford junior's
relay.
One more run came around in
the top of the ninth, when junior
second baseman Kenny
Diekroeger's two-out single and
stolen base turned into a 5-2 Car
dinal lead, courtesy of sophomore
Austin Wilson's 25th RBI of the
season. The rightfielder is now
tied with Piscotty for the team
lead in that category.
Stanford looks to have the
edge in the final two matchups of
the weekend. Redshirt junior left
hander Brett Mooneyham (5-1)
will pitch on Friday. Mooneyham
has looked sharp all year long,
and his ERA remains at 1.96 de
spite the Cardinal's recent slump.
Saturday will feature a pair of
underclassmen righties on the
mound: Stanford freshman John
Hochstatter and Husky sopho
more Austin Voth. Hochstatter
has fallen to 3-3 with three tough
losses in a row and will look to get
back on track Saturday after
noon in the 1 p.m. finale.
Mooneyham and the Card
will go up against Bay Area na
tive Tyler Davis, a freshman
righthander from Mountain
View, Calif., in tonight's 5 p.m.
contest.

The Cardinal defense also re
turned to form behind its ace, with
Ragira making a diving play in the
sixth inning and leftfielder Tyler
Gaffney quelling an eighth-inning
rally by throwing out junior Mac
Acker, who tried to advance from
first to third on a single but could
not beat the Stanford junior's
relay.
One more run came around in
the top of the ninth, when junior
second baseman Kenny
Diekroeger's two-out single and
stolen base turned into a 5-2 Car
dinal lead, courtesy of sophomore
Austin Wilson's 25th RBI of the
season. The rightfielder is now
tied with Piscotty for the team
lead in that category.
Stanford looks to have the
edge in the final two matchups of
the weekend. Redshirt junior left
hander Brett Mooneyham (5-1)
will pitch on Friday. Mooneyham
has looked sharp all year long,
and his ERA remains at 1.96 de
spite the Cardinal's recent slump.
Saturday will feature a pair of
underclassmen righties on the
mound: Stanford freshman John
Hochstatter and Husky sopho
more Austin Voth. Hochstatter
has fallen to 3-3 with three tough
losses in a row and will look to get
back on track Saturday after
noon in the 1 p.m. finale.
Mooneyham and the Card
will go up against Bay Area na
tive Tyler Davis, a freshman
righthander from Mountain
View, Calif., in tonight's 5 p.m.
contest.
