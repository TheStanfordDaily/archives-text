## CARD READY TO TAKE ON TOP-15 TEAMS AT HOME 
### DANIEL LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
During a season in which five teams are
separated by one game in the MPSF stand
ings, taking care of business at home has been
a top priority.
With No. 8 Long Beach State (13-12, 8-10
MPSF) and No. 12 Cal State-Northridge (10-
15, 6-12) coming to the Farm this weekend,
plus a date with conference co-leader UCLA
the following weekend, the No. 5 Stanford
men's volleyball team must defend its home
court if it wants to claim the conference title.
Despite a 9-2 conference road record that
includes wins over No. 4 BYU and No. 2 UC-
Irvine, the Cardinal (16-6,13-5) finds itself in
fifth place in the conference standings as a re
sult of its home struggles. The team is just 4-3
at home in league play. To complete the task
at hand, the team will have to defeat the Long
Beach State 49ers, a team Stanford has strug

gled with in recent memory. Despite outlast
ing the 49ers in five sets the last time these
two squads met, Stanford had lost the previ
ous three meetings with LBSU.
The key to the match when these two
teams played earlier in the season was the ef
ficiency of Stanford's middle blockers, senior
Gus Ellis and sophomore Eric Mochalski.The
two combined for 16 kills on 24 attempts,
which complemented the strong play of the
ever-consistent Brad Lawson in propelling
Stanford to victory. Stanford is a team that
prides itself on good defense and passing; a
strong showing from the middle blocker posi
tion is a good sign of both.
Luckily for the Cardinal, slowing down the
49ers attack may have gotten a little bit easier
this time around, thanks to a knee injury that
has sidelined Jim Baughman, LBSU's leading
hitter. The senior, who is averaging 2.89 kills
per set, is currently two kills shy of 1,000 ca
reer kills. His poor performance the last time
out helped Stanford come away with the vic
tory.
