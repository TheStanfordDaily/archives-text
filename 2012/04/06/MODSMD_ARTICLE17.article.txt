# THE 						PLOT THICKENS
## CARD READY TO TAKE ON TOP-15 TEAMS AT HOME 
### DANIEL LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
During a season in which five teams are
separated by one game in the MPSF stand
ings, taking care of business at home has been
a top priority.
With No. 8 Long Beach State (13-12, 8-10
MPSF) and No. 12 Cal State-Northridge (10-
15, 6-12) coming to the Farm this weekend,
plus a date with conference co-leader UCLA
the following weekend, the No. 5 Stanford
men's volleyball team must defend its home
court if it wants to claim the conference title.
Despite a 9-2 conference road record that
includes wins over No. 4 BYU and No. 2 UC-
Irvine, the Cardinal (16-6,13-5) finds itself in
fifth place in the conference standings as a re
sult of its home struggles. The team is just 4-3
at home in league play. To complete the task
at hand, the team will have to defeat the Long
Beach State 49ers, a team Stanford has strug

gled with in recent memory. Despite outlast
ing the 49ers in five sets the last time these
two squads met, Stanford had lost the previ
ous three meetings with LBSU.
The key to the match when these two
teams played earlier in the season was the ef
ficiency of Stanford's middle blockers, senior
Gus Ellis and sophomore Eric Mochalski.The
two combined for 16 kills on 24 attempts,
which complemented the strong play of the
ever-consistent Brad Lawson in propelling
Stanford to victory. Stanford is a team that
prides itself on good defense and passing; a
strong showing from the middle blocker posi
tion is a good sign of both.
Luckily for the Cardinal, slowing down the
49ers attack may have gotten a little bit easier
this time around, thanks to a knee injury that
has sidelined Jim Baughman, LBSU's leading
hitter. The senior, who is averaging 2.89 kills
per set, is currently two kills shy of 1,000 ca
reer kills. His poor performance the last time
out helped Stanford come away with the vic
tory.


MADELINE SIDES/The Stanford Daily
Senior middle blocker Gus Ellis (above) and the No. 5 Stanford men's volleyball team hope to
move up in the MPSF conference standings as the Cardinal takes on No. 8 Long Beach State and
No. 12 Cal State-Northridge in pivotal back-to-back showdowns at Maples Pavilion this weekend.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
LBSU still has a variety of
weapons at its disposal, most no
tably sophomore Taylor Crabb
and senior Brad Hemmerling.
Both players average better than
two kills per set and are a large
reason why the 49ers have not
struggled in Baughman's ab
sence. The 49ers are winners of
three in a row, a streak that can
currently be matched by only
two other teams in the confer
ence, No. 1 USC and No. 11 UC-
San Diego.
Saturday's match will prove
to be a different kind of test for
the Cardinal when it takes on the
Cal State-Northridge Matadors.
Similar to Long Beach State,
Northridge was defeated by
Stanford earlier this year on its

home floor and is looking to
exact some revenge. Unlike
LBSU however, the Matadors
are not playing their best ball of
the season at the moment.
Northridge was swept at the
hands of BYU last week, muster
ing just one game in two matches
in Provo.
Stanford held off Northridge
the last time these two teams
played thanks to the play of out
side hitter Brian Cook, who may
have had the best match of his
collegiate career thus far. The
sophomore tallied 26 kills on a
.450 hitting percentage and also
registered 8 digs.
To take down the Matadors a
second time, Stanford will have
to do a much better job of cover
ing junior middle blocker Jared
Moore, who had 13 kills on 14 at
tempts in the previous meeting
between the two schools. Moore
leads Northridge this season
with a .394 hitting percentage.
Not to be forgotten is fresh
man sensation Julius Hoefer, the
Matadors' leading hitter at bet
ter than three kills per set. The
German national poses obvious
problems with his 6-9 height. He
will be looking to prove himself
after Stanford held him to a.200
hitting percentage in the past
meeting between the two teams.
A sweep this weekend could
do wonders for the team's
chances at a conference title,
considering at least two teams
ahead of the Cardinal in the con
ference standings are guaran
teed a loss this weekend. Law
son, Cook, Ellis and company
will be in action at Maples Pavil
ion at 7 p.m. on Friday against
Long Beach State and again at 7
p.m. on Saturday against North
ridge.
