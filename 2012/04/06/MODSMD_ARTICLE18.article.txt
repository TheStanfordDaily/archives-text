## Card set to take on Broncos NO. 6 CARDINAL HOSTS SANTA CLARA 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
After a brief lapse in dual match play
due to dead week and finals, it's taken the
Stanford women's tennis team no time at
all to once again demonstrate its domi
nance. Stanford looks to continue its un
defeated season with a win over Bay Area
rival Santa Clara this Saturday.
The No. 6 Cardinal (14-0, 6-0 Pac-12)
will be aiming high in its final nonconfer
ence match of the season against the un
ranked Broncos. In the past two weeks,
Stanford has delivered four straight dev
astating blows to its opponents. The Stan
ford women defeated No. 51 UNLV, No.
27 Arizona State, No. 28 Arizona and most
recently the unranked Cal Poly Mustangs,
all without dropping a match.
"All of us did a good job of getting a lot
of court time during dead week and finals
week, so it wasn't difficult at all to get back
into the groove of things," explained fresh
man EllenTsay. "Every one of us has been
really motivated and disciplined this year,
whether it is extra workouts or practicing
on our own."
Senior captain Veronica Li described
the importance of maintaining momen
tum for the squad as the Cardinal enters
the last full month of competitive dual
match play before the Pac-12 Champi
onship in late April and the NCAA tour
nament in May.
"I think the team is looking really
good, and our goal is the national champi
onship in May, so we are still building to
wards that," Li acknowledged. "Hopefully
we'll keep getting better each day and be
ready to compete at our best come time."
Santa Clara (8-7) will commute to the
Farm on Saturday morning in hopes of
coming away with a victory against the
strong Cardinal squad. It will most likely
be sophomore Nicole Gibbs facing the
Broncos' No. 1 singles player, sophomore
Katie Le, on court one. However,Tsay has
played Le before, as both girls were top
Northern California junior players. Le was
named the WCC Women's Tennis Singles
Player of the Month on Thursday and,
coming off an 11-match win streak, will
lead her team in the fight.
"As always, we are going to concen
trate on playing our game and keeping our
focus against them,"Tsay said.
Despite the Cardinal's recent success
at this critical point in the season, its six
consecutive shutouts don't necessarily ac-
curately represent the toughness
of each match.
"My singles match against Cal
Poly was a mental test because it
was the first time I played on court
three," Tsay said. "My opponent
was tricky to play in the windy
conditions. I went up 3-0 in the first
set and then it went back to 3-all,
but during the critical time, I was
'resilient,' as coach Lele put it."
Resilient she was,executing a 6-3,
7-5 victory over Kathryn Webb and
securing her first stadium victory.
Doubles play has continued to
be a strength of the Stanford team,
as the No. 1 pairing of junior Mal
lory Burdette and Gibbs remains
undefeated and the No. 2 pairing of
junior StaceyTan and Tsay contin
ues to improve.
" [Tan] and I work really well to
gether and have gotten really good

at anticipating each other's ten
dencies as the season has pro
gressed," Tsay said. "We've been
doing a lot of doubles drills during
practice, and that has helped us
hone our strategies."
The No. 3 team of junior Natal
ie Dillon and Li has also been
dominant against recent oppo
nents. Continued strong doubles
performances will be needed in
the final weeks of the regular sea
son. After this weekend's match
against Santa Clara, the Cardinal
will face three conference rivals
consecutively: No. 4 USC, No. 1
UCLA and finally No. 9 Cal,
whom the Cardinal dismantled 5-
2 in an earlier meeting this season
that did not count towards confer
ence standings.
For now, the Stanford women's
tennis team is focusing solely on
defeating Santa Clara at 9:30 a.m.
on Saturday at the Taube Family
Tennis Center.

Senior Veronica Li (above) and the No. 6 Stanford women's tennis team,
coming off a 7-0 domination of Cal Poly, look to remain undefeated as
they take on Santa Clara on Saturday at the Taube Family Tennis Center.
After a brief lapse in dual match play
due to dead week and finals, it's taken the
Stanford women's tennis team no time at
all to once again demonstrate its domi
nance. Stanford looks to continue its un
defeated season with a win over Bay Area
rival Santa Clara this Saturday.
The No. 6 Cardinal (14-0, 6-0 Pac-12)
will be aiming high in its final nonconfer
ence match of the season against the un
ranked Broncos. In the past two weeks,
Stanford has delivered four straight dev
astating blows to its opponents. The Stan
ford women defeated No. 51 UNLV, No.
27 Arizona State, No. 28 Arizona and most
recently the unranked Cal Poly Mustangs,
all without dropping a match.
"All of us did a good job of getting a lot
of court time during dead week and finals
week, so it wasn't difficult at all to get back
into the groove of things," explained fresh
man EllenTsay. "Every one of us has been
really motivated and disciplined this year,
whether it is extra workouts or practicing
on our own."
Senior captain Veronica Li described
the importance of maintaining momen
tum for the squad as the Cardinal enters
the last full month of competitive dual
match play before the Pac-12 Champi
onship in late April and the NCAA tour
nament in May.
"I think the team is looking really
good, and our goal is the national champi
onship in May, so we are still building to
wards that," Li acknowledged. "Hopefully
we'll keep getting better each day and be
ready to compete at our best come time."
Santa Clara (8-7) will commute to the
Farm on Saturday morning in hopes of
coming away with a victory against the
strong Cardinal squad. It will most likely
be sophomore Nicole Gibbs facing the
Broncos' No. 1 singles player, sophomore
Katie Le, on court one. However,Tsay has
played Le before, as both girls were top
Northern California junior players. Le was
named the WCC Women's Tennis Singles
Player of the Month on Thursday and,
coming off an 11-match win streak, will
lead her team in the fight.
"As always, we are going to concen
trate on playing our game and keeping our
focus against them,"Tsay said.
Despite the Cardinal's recent success
at this critical point in the season, its six
consecutive shutouts don't necessarily ac-
curately represent the toughness
of each match.
"My singles match against Cal
Poly was a mental test because it
was the first time I played on court
three," Tsay said. "My opponent
was tricky to play in the windy
conditions. I went up 3-0 in the first
set and then it went back to 3-all,
but during the critical time, I was
'resilient,' as coach Lele put it."
Resilient she was,executing a 6-3,
7-5 victory over Kathryn Webb and
securing her first stadium victory.
Doubles play has continued to
be a strength of the Stanford team,
as the No. 1 pairing of junior Mal
lory Burdette and Gibbs remains
undefeated and the No. 2 pairing of
junior StaceyTan and Tsay contin
ues to improve.
" [Tan] and I work really well to
gether and have gotten really good

at anticipating each other's ten
dencies as the season has pro
gressed," Tsay said. "We've been
doing a lot of doubles drills during
practice, and that has helped us
hone our strategies."
The No. 3 team of junior Natal
ie Dillon and Li has also been
dominant against recent oppo
nents. Continued strong doubles
performances will be needed in
the final weeks of the regular sea
son. After this weekend's match
against Santa Clara, the Cardinal
will face three conference rivals
consecutively: No. 4 USC, No. 1
UCLA and finally No. 9 Cal,
whom the Cardinal dismantled 5-
2 in an earlier meeting this season
that did not count towards confer
ence standings.
For now, the Stanford women's
tennis team is focusing solely on
defeating Santa Clara at 9:30 a.m.
on Saturday at the Taube Family
Tennis Center.
