## Card set to take on Broncos NO. 6 CARDINAL HOSTS SANTA CLARA 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
After a brief lapse in dual match play
due to dead week and finals, it's taken the
Stanford women's tennis team no time at
all to once again demonstrate its domi
nance. Stanford looks to continue its un
defeated season with a win over Bay Area
rival Santa Clara this Saturday.
The No. 6 Cardinal (14-0, 6-0 Pac-12)
will be aiming high in its final nonconfer
ence match of the season against the un
ranked Broncos. In the past two weeks,
Stanford has delivered four straight dev
astating blows to its opponents. The Stan
ford women defeated No. 51 UNLV, No.
27 Arizona State, No. 28 Arizona and most
recently the unranked Cal Poly Mustangs,
all without dropping a match.
"All of us did a good job of getting a lot
of court time during dead week and finals
week, so it wasn't difficult at all to get back
into the groove of things," explained fresh
man EllenTsay. "Every one of us has been
really motivated and disciplined this year,
whether it is extra workouts or practicing
on our own."
Senior captain Veronica Li described
the importance of maintaining momen
tum for the squad as the Cardinal enters
the last full month of competitive dual
match play before the Pac-12 Champi
onship in late April and the NCAA tour
nament in May.
"I think the team is looking really
good, and our goal is the national champi
onship in May, so we are still building to
wards that," Li acknowledged. "Hopefully
we'll keep getting better each day and be
ready to compete at our best come time."
Santa Clara (8-7) will commute to the
Farm on Saturday morning in hopes of
coming away with a victory against the
strong Cardinal squad. It will most likely
be sophomore Nicole Gibbs facing the
Broncos' No. 1 singles player, sophomore
Katie Le, on court one. However,Tsay has
played Le before, as both girls were top
Northern California junior players. Le was
named the WCC Women's Tennis Singles
Player of the Month on Thursday and,
coming off an 11-match win streak, will
lead her team in the fight.
"As always, we are going to concen
trate on playing our game and keeping our
focus against them,"Tsay said.
Despite the Cardinal's recent success
at this critical point in the season, its six
consecutive shutouts don't necessarily ac-
