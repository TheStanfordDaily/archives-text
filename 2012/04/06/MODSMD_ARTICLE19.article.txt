# Fantasy Opening Day
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
With MLB Opening
Day in the books,
millions of Amer
icans have just
gotten their first
looks at their favorite teams' rosters,
scrupulously rehashed and refined
throughout the offseason. But for
many of us it was also the first full
day of fantasy baseball action, when
all the amateur GMs out there final
ly saw our own hand-picked players
filling the stat sheets in games that
count.
After two brief and wildly
unsuccessful sojourns into the
world of fantasy hockey, I finally de
cided to have a go at its much more
popular baseball counterpart. I had
been avoiding this for the past few
years because of all the horror sto
ries I'd heard about fantasy man
agers burning out by the end of the
162-game season. But with the illu
sion of free time afforded by spring
break, I coaxed myself into joining a
simple, rotisserie-style ESPN
league with an autopick draft made
just for fantasy amateurs like me,
knowing full well that we hadn't
done our preseason homework.
Clearly having learned nothing
from my two fantasy hockey teams
which both crashed and burned
due to their inordinately large con
centrations of San Jose Sharks I
named my team the "Posey Posers"
and bumped up San Francisco Gi
ants catcher Buster Posey, ace Tim
Lincecum and bearded closer
Brian Wilson significantly in my
pre-draft player rankings. All three
ended up on my team. (Needless to
say, Scott Cousins didn't make the
cut.)
Looking at my squad the morn
ing after the selections, I was sur
prised to see how many big-name
hitters the autodraft had given me:
Miguel Cabrera, Carlos Gonzalez,
Ryan Zimmerman, Shane Victori
no, Yoenis Cespedes and Andre
Ethier. Of course, a Los Angeles
Dodger on the Posey Posers just
wouldn't do, so I quickly dumped
Ethier in a trade for the speedy
Jimmy Rollins, also giving me an
extra slot to work with in the deep
free-agent outfielder pool.
My starting pitchers were even
more impressive. Besides Lince
cum, I ended up with Rays rookie
Matt Moore, Reds righty Mat
Latos, Cardinals curveballer Adam
Wainwright and Atlanta ace
Tommy Flanson. Putting injured
Yankee Michael Pineda on the DL
let me add the risky Johan Santana
to that group.
The one downside? The banged
up Wilson was my only true closer,
with Javy Guerra fighting for the job
in L.A. and newly converted Texas
starter Neftali Feliz still labeled as a
reliever by the autodraft. In the
hopes of putting up a respectable
showing in the saves column, I
quickly proposed trades to six of the
nine other teams, most of which had
three or four closers, but all my of
fers were either ignored or rejected.
What can I say, there's a first
time for everything.
And my first few days as a fanta
sy baseball manager were much
more enjoyable than I had expect
ed. There's a certain degree of ex
citement associated with playing a
GM, trying to one-up all the bigwigs
who are so fond of centering long
term payrolls around washed-up
superstars (Giants fans: see Barry
Zito) or letting homegrown heroes
leave without putting up much of a
fight (A's fans: see Barry Zito).
In away, the marathon that is the
MLB season adds a level of intrigue
to fantasy baseball. There's more
time to make up for early mistakes,
more chances to come up with a
high-risk trade and more need to
follow the waiver wire religiously.
And in a sport so heavily embodied
by slumps and hot streaks, I'm
going to have to face the fact that no
one not even Buster Posey
can be considered untouchable for
the long haul.
So how did the Posey Posers do
on Opening Day? We may have
gone 5-30 without a single RBI, but
Santana and Hanson pitching
against each other in the non-fanta
sy baseball world yesterday
combined for 10 six-hit, one-run in
nings, with an impressive WHIP of
1.10.
Sounds a lot like the Giants after
all.

Joseph Bey da might start an all- Gi
ants lineup if someone doesn't stop
him. Give him some quality fantasy
baseball advice at jbeyda@stan

league with an autopick draft made
just for fantasy amateurs like me,
knowing full well that we hadn't
done our preseason homework.
Clearly having learned nothing
from my two fantasy hockey teams
which both crashed and burned
due to their inordinately large con
centrations of San Jose Sharks I
named my team the "Posey Posers"
and bumped up San Francisco Gi
ants catcher Buster Posey, ace Tim
Lincecum and bearded closer
Brian Wilson significantly in my
pre-draft player rankings. All three
ended up on my team. (Needless to
say, Scott Cousins didn't make the
cut.)
Looking at my squad the morn
ing after the selections, I was sur
prised to see how many big-name
hitters the autodraft had given me:
Miguel Cabrera, Carlos Gonzalez,
Ryan Zimmerman, Shane Victori
no, Yoenis Cespedes and Andre
Ethier. Of course, a Los Angeles
Dodger on the Posey Posers just
wouldn't do, so I quickly dumped
Ethier in a trade for the speedy
Jimmy Rollins, also giving me an
extra slot to work with in the deep
free-agent outfielder pool.
My starting pitchers were even
more impressive. Besides Lince
cum, I ended up with Rays rookie
Matt Moore, Reds righty Mat
Latos, Cardinals curveballer Adam
Wainwright and Atlanta ace
Tommy Flanson. Putting injured
Yankee Michael Pineda on the DL
let me add the risky Johan Santana
to that group.
The one downside? The banged
up Wilson was my only true closer,
with Javy Guerra fighting for the job
in L.A. and newly converted Texas
starter Neftali Feliz still labeled as a
reliever by the autodraft. In the
hopes of putting up a respectable
showing in the saves column, I
quickly proposed trades to six of the
nine other teams, most of which had
three or four closers, but all my of
fers were either ignored or rejected.
What can I say, there's a first
time for everything.
And my first few days as a fanta
sy baseball manager were much
more enjoyable than I had expect
ed. There's a certain degree of ex
citement associated with playing a
GM, trying to one-up all the bigwigs
who are so fond of centering long
term payrolls around washed-up
superstars (Giants fans: see Barry
Zito) or letting homegrown heroes
leave without putting up much of a
fight (A's fans: see Barry Zito).
In away, the marathon that is the
MLB season adds a level of intrigue
to fantasy baseball. There's more
time to make up for early mistakes,
more chances to come up with a
high-risk trade and more need to
follow the waiver wire religiously.
And in a sport so heavily embodied
by slumps and hot streaks, I'm
going to have to face the fact that no
one not even Buster Posey
can be considered untouchable for
the long haul.
So how did the Posey Posers do
on Opening Day? We may have
gone 5-30 without a single RBI, but
Santana and Hanson pitching
against each other in the non-fanta
sy baseball world yesterday
combined for 10 six-hit, one-run in
nings, with an impressive WHIP of
1.10.
Sounds a lot like the Giants after
all.

Joseph Bey da might start an all- Gi
ants lineup if someone doesn't stop
