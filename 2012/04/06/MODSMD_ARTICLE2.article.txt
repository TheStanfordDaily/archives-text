## ASSU Senate to experience full turnover Lowest candidate turnout in the last decade, no senators seeking re-election 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The number of candidates for the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate has hit its lowest in at
least a decade this election cycle, with only 24
students set to appear on the spring ballot for
15 Senate seats. Of the candidates, 21 are fresh
men.
According to data from the Elections Com
mission archives, the number of Senate candi
dates has, in recent history, generally hovered
near 40 students each election cycle and has not
dipped below 30 in seven years. Last year, 39
undergraduates declared, petitioned and cam
paigned, and each received more than 150
votes in the election.
Although he could only speculate, Senator
Alon Elhanan 'l4 said he thinks this year's Sen
ate more honestly represented senator respon
sibilities to potential candidates, deterring the
less-committed who may have otherwise con
sidered running.
"I think we have more accurately portrayed
what being on the Senate is actually like, so I
think there is less fluff' he said. "We are legiti
mately trying to only get the people who actu
ally want to do the job, more than just hyping
[Senate]."
"Everyone wants to run for something, but
it's when you find out what you're running for
that I think people don't want to do it," he
added. "We've been really good about actually
giving the details of what people are running
for."

Outgoing Senator and Academ
ic Affairs Chair Janani Ramachan
dran 'l4, however, attributed the
smaller number of candidates to a
less accurate public perception of
Senate duties.
"More so recently than in previ
ous years, campus publications
have been posting negative criti
cisms against the ASSU Senate
rather than highlighting some of
the actual issues they are working
on," Ramachandran wrote in an
email to The Daily, "which might
contribute to them getting a nega
tive impression of what the ASSU
Senate does and deter them from
wanting to be a part of it."
According to Senator Dan Ash
ton 'l4, Frosh Council members
were not informed of election op
portunities this year until a month
later than traditionally, which he
said "certainly contributed" to the
decrease in candidates
ASSU President Michael Cruz
'l2 speculated that this year's lack
of widespread controversy sur
rounding ASSU legislation and ini
tiatives as compared to, for ex
ample, the ROTC debate of last

year may have resulted in in
creased student apathy.
Additionally, no current mem
bers of the Senate have plans to
continue in the ASSU, as none are
running for election to ASSU office
next year, though the body includes
only two graduating seniors. Cur
rent Senators Brianna Pang 'l3 and
Dan DeLong 'l3 had originally de
clared intent to run as a slate for the
ASSU Executive but recently
dropped out of the race, citing "aca
demic coursework, friendships and
the other priorities" in an email to
The Daily.
Every year since 2006, at least
one outgoing senator has sought ei
ther the ASSU presidency or re
election to the Senate. During this
same time period, each Senate
with the exception of the ninth
has had between one and three in
cumbents. Current Chair of the
13th Undergraduate Senate,
Rafael Vazquez 'l2 has served for
two years. Cruz served on both the
11th and 12th Undergraduate Sen
ates.
When asked why they decided
not to run for re-election, almost all
of the current sophomore senators
said they will be studying abroad
next year, rendering them ineligible
to serve on the Senate. Echoing the
sentiments of Pang and DeLong,
several senators also noted that the

ASSU position was a significant
commitment and prevented them
from engaging fully in other pur
suits.
"It's a very hard job. It takes up a
lot of your time, and you want to do
other things," Elhanan said. "We
only have four years [at Stanford]."
Senator Samar Alqatari 'l4 said
that she regretted that she could not
run again because she had accumu
lated knowledge over her one-year
term that would have been benefi
cial as a representative.
"I was thinking about it a lot, be
cause after my term I realized exact
ly what the point of the Senate is and
where its most influence is... and I
realized that I didn't know that run
ning for Senate last year," Alqatari
said.
Regardless, several senators said
that they hope to continue advocat
ing for change on campus.
"I've committed myself to mak
ing change on campus via other av
enues, such as the NAACP," Shawn
Dye 'l4 wrote of his decision in an
email to The Daily. "My passion for
social justice has been limited by my
position within the ASSU, and I
hope to alleviate myself from the
various barriers that exist within the
institution."

15 Senate seats. Of the candidates, 21 are fresh
men.
According to data from the Elections Com
mission archives, the number of Senate candi
dates has, in recent history, generally hovered
near 40 students each election cycle and has not
dipped below 30 in seven years. Last year, 39
undergraduates declared, petitioned and cam
paigned, and each received more than 150
votes in the election.
Although he could only speculate, Senator
Alon Elhanan 'l4 said he thinks this year's Sen
ate more honestly represented senator respon
sibilities to potential candidates, deterring the
less-committed who may have otherwise con
sidered running.
"I think we have more accurately portrayed
what being on the Senate is actually like, so I
think there is less fluff' he said. "We are legiti
mately trying to only get the people who actu
ally want to do the job, more than just hyping
[Senate]."
"Everyone wants to run for something, but
it's when you find out what you're running for
that I think people don't want to do it," he
added. "We've been really good about actually
giving the details of what people are running
for."

Outgoing Senator and Academ
ic Affairs Chair Janani Ramachan
dran 'l4, however, attributed the
smaller number of candidates to a
less accurate public perception of
Senate duties.
"More so recently than in previ
ous years, campus publications
have been posting negative criti
cisms against the ASSU Senate
rather than highlighting some of
the actual issues they are working
on," Ramachandran wrote in an
email to The Daily, "which might
contribute to them getting a nega
tive impression of what the ASSU
Senate does and deter them from
wanting to be a part of it."
According to Senator Dan Ash
ton 'l4, Frosh Council members
were not informed of election op
portunities this year until a month
later than traditionally, which he
said "certainly contributed" to the
decrease in candidates
ASSU President Michael Cruz
'l2 speculated that this year's lack
of widespread controversy sur
rounding ASSU legislation and ini
tiatives as compared to, for ex
ample, the ROTC debate of last

year may have resulted in in
creased student apathy.
Additionally, no current mem
bers of the Senate have plans to
continue in the ASSU, as none are
running for election to ASSU office
next year, though the body includes
only two graduating seniors. Cur
rent Senators Brianna Pang 'l3 and
Dan DeLong 'l3 had originally de
clared intent to run as a slate for the
ASSU Executive but recently
dropped out of the race, citing "aca
demic coursework, friendships and
the other priorities" in an email to
The Daily.
Every year since 2006, at least
one outgoing senator has sought ei
ther the ASSU presidency or re
election to the Senate. During this
same time period, each Senate
with the exception of the ninth
has had between one and three in
cumbents. Current Chair of the
13th Undergraduate Senate,
Rafael Vazquez 'l2 has served for
two years. Cruz served on both the
11th and 12th Undergraduate Sen
ates.
When asked why they decided
not to run for re-election, almost all
of the current sophomore senators
said they will be studying abroad
next year, rendering them ineligible
to serve on the Senate. Echoing the
sentiments of Pang and DeLong,
several senators also noted that the

ASSU position was a significant
commitment and prevented them
from engaging fully in other pur
suits.
"It's a very hard job. It takes up a
lot of your time, and you want to do
other things," Elhanan said. "We
only have four years [at Stanford]."
Senator Samar Alqatari 'l4 said
that she regretted that she could not
run again because she had accumu
lated knowledge over her one-year
term that would have been benefi
cial as a representative.
"I was thinking about it a lot, be
cause after my term I realized exact
ly what the point of the Senate is and
where its most influence is... and I
realized that I didn't know that run
ning for Senate last year," Alqatari
said.
Regardless, several senators said
that they hope to continue advocat
ing for change on campus.
"I've committed myself to mak
ing change on campus via other av
enues, such as the NAACP," Shawn
Dye 'l4 wrote of his decision in an
email to The Daily. "My passion for
social justice has been limited by my
position within the ASSU, and I
hope to alleviate myself from the
various barriers that exist within the
institution."
