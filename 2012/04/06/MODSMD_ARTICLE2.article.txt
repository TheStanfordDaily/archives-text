## ASSU Senate to experience full turnover Lowest candidate turnout in the last decade, no senators seeking re-election 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The number of candidates for the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate has hit its lowest in at
least a decade this election cycle, with only 24
students set to appear on the spring ballot for
15 Senate seats. Of the candidates, 21 are fresh
men.
According to data from the Elections Com
mission archives, the number of Senate candi
dates has, in recent history, generally hovered
near 40 students each election cycle and has not
dipped below 30 in seven years. Last year, 39
undergraduates declared, petitioned and cam
paigned, and each received more than 150
votes in the election.
Although he could only speculate, Senator
Alon Elhanan 'l4 said he thinks this year's Sen
ate more honestly represented senator respon
sibilities to potential candidates, deterring the
less-committed who may have otherwise con
sidered running.
"I think we have more accurately portrayed
what being on the Senate is actually like, so I
think there is less fluff' he said. "We are legiti
mately trying to only get the people who actu
ally want to do the job, more than just hyping
[Senate]."
"Everyone wants to run for something, but
it's when you find out what you're running for
that I think people don't want to do it," he
added. "We've been really good about actually
giving the details of what people are running
for."
