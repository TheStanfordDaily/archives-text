# STILL ROLLING
## MEN'S TEAM PREPARES FOR PAC-12 FOES 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford men's tennis
team returns home to the Taube Family
Tennis Center this weekend with back
to-back Pac-12 matches against Oregon
and Washington. These two matches
promise to be closely contested, as the
teams will try to get into good position
heading into the inaugural Pac-12
Championship starting April 25th in
Ojai, Calif.
On Friday afternoon the Cardinal
(12-5,2-0 Pac-12) will welcome the No.
62-ranked Oregon Ducks to the Farm.
The Ducks are coming off trouncings at
the hands of USC and UCLA and are
looking to rebound this weekend
against the Northern California power
houses Stanford and Cal.
The Ducks (5-7,0-2 Pac-12) are led
by a top-heavy singles lineup anchored
by underclassmen. Sophomores Alex
Rovello and Robin Cambier hold down
the top two spots of the singles rotation,
and Cambier is coming off a recent 15-
match winning streak. Playing in the
third slot for the Ducks is freshman
Daniel Sardu. The influx of talented un
derclassmen into the top of the lineup
has the Oregon coaches and fans excit
ed about their future. For the present,
however, it certainly looks as if Stanford
will be the favorite in Friday's match.
Saturday afternoon brings in the No.
22 Washington Huskies (12-5, 0-2 Pac
-12). Like the Ducks, the Huskies are
coming off losses in their first two Pac
-12 matches of the season, also against
USC and UCLA. The Huskies are led
by talented junior Kyle McMorrow, who

is ranked No. 14 in the country. His sin
gles match against either Bradley Klahn
or Ryan Thacher on the No. 1 singles
court will surely not be one to miss.
The Cardinal will be looking to im
prove upon the momentum that it gar
nered by beating pesky Pac-12 oppo
nents Arizona and Colorado last week
end. Head coach John Whitlinger has
been very careful to keep his team con
centrated on the task at hand by always
focusing on the next match.
"The biggest match is Friday; it's our
next match and the one we are focused
on," Whitlinger said. "After Friday's
match we will start preparing for Satur
day against Washington. We don't want
to look ahead to our road trip next
weekend to L.A. against USC and
UCLA. We'll save preparing for those
matches after the ones this weekend are
finished."
The team is beginning its stretch of
tennis that will define its season. Pac-12
play through the beginning of April will
lead up to the Pac-12 Championship
starting April 25. Then the Pac-12
Championship will lead to the season
ending NCAA Championship, begin
ning May 11 in Athens, Ga.
"All we're trying to do is keep im
proving," said Whitlinger. "We still have
a ways to go and will try to get a little
better with each match. We're hoping to
begin peaking at the right time."
The two matches this weekend will
be important building blocks if the
Stanford men's tennis team hopes to
reach its goal of winning the NCAA
tournament.
The Cardinal will host Oregon at
1:30 p.m. on Friday and then square off
against Washington at 1 p.m. on Satur
day.
