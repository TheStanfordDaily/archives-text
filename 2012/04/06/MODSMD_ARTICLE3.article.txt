# Tier 2 required for co-ops
## Requirement for co-op pre-assignment more stringent, deadline tonight 
### ISSRA OMER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With tonight's deadline for pre-assign
ment fast approaching, a new housing poli
cy will require students who wish to pre-as
sign into a cooperative house for the 2012-
13 academic year to use their Tier 2 housing
preference.
While in the past students had been able
to draw into co-ops such as Kairos and En
chanted Broccoli Forrest (EBF) with their
Tier 3 housing preference, now all co-ops
require the use of a Tier 2 preference.
This change means that for students who
have already used their Tier 2 housing,
choosing to pre-assign to a co-op will re
quire that they use their Tier 1 housing pref
erence.
Anthony So 'l4 was planning to use his

Tier 3 housing choice to pre-assign into a
co-op during his junior year. "But now I
can't," he said, suggesting that he doesn't
want to use his Tier 1 preference to land in
a co-op.
"I like the idea of pre-assigning," So
added. "Living in a co-op is a great way to
meet people and have a sense of communi
ty."
"It seems like this policy really limits the
amount that you can diversify your Stan
ford experience through housing," So said.
"Basically, you have to live in a dorm for the
majority of the time."
Gabriella Durango 'l2 said she also be
lieves that the new policy is restricting to in
dividuals who are looking to live in a co-op.
She predicted that the change would be met
with negative feedback.
"It seems like housing is getting homog

enized," Durango said.
"I personally don't like it," she added.
"Not only does it limit people's choices, but
it could destroy a community that people
really treasure."
According to Durango, the community
atmosphere of co-ops appeals strongly to
individuals who feel much more comfort
able living in a co-op rather than a dorm.
"Co-ops are getting more and more
popular, but it seems like this policy is just
another way to facilitate the homogeniza
tion of housing at Stanford," she said.
A ResEd assistant dean did not respond
to a request for comment in time for publi
cation.
Some students, however, said they be
lieve that the change of policy might offe
more enthusiasm and interest in
the co-ops themselves.
"Maybe people will have a bet
ter chance of drawing into the co
op that they want because they
are using their Tier 2," said Maddy
Sides 'l5, a Daily photo editor.
"That way, everyone who would
pre-assign to the co-op would be
really enthusiastic about it since it
would be their top choice."
Part of the appeal of the co-ops
at Stanford is that they offer an al
ternative style of living, with a
strong sense of community and
ownership. This is often a major
factor influencing students who
choose to pre-assign into co-ops,
according to Sides.
"Living in an all-freshman
dorm has been a cool part of the
year, and it's because of the sense
of community," Sides said of her
current living environment. "The
idea of drawing into a big sopho
more dorm doesn't really appeal
to me. I really want to continue to
live in a community."
Sides said she believes she can
find this sense of a close-knit com
munity in a co-op.
"I've heard from some of my
upperclassmen friends about co

ops," she added. "They have told
me about their positive experi
ences, and I wanted to look into
them."
Peter Johnston 'l4, a Synergy
resident, described his co-op is "a
big, loving, affectionate family."
"Coming home to Synergy is
like coming to your actual home,"
he said. "There is so much free
dom and independence living at
Synergy."
"With co-ops it's all about the
community," Durango said. "You
really invest yourself into the
housing community, cleaning and
cooking. Everyone feels responsi
ble and has a greater respect for
others, since there is a sense of
communal ownership."
Though the effects of the poli
cy have yet to be seen, Johnston
doesn't believe that the changes
will affect the atmosphere at Syn
ergy or other co-ops.
"This year we had lots of fresh
men come and visit Synergy, and
there were tons who pre-as
signed," Johnston said. "I think
this [policy] will just reduce the
number of people who pre-as
sign."
"Ultimately, it seems like most
of the people who would use Tier
3 to draw into co-ops would also
use their Tier 2 as well," he added.

strong sense of community and
ownership. This is often a major
factor influencing students who
choose to pre-assign into co-ops,
according to Sides.
"Living in an all-freshman
dorm has been a cool part of the
year, and it's because of the sense
of community," Sides said of her
current living environment. "The
idea of drawing into a big sopho
more dorm doesn't really appeal
to me. I really want to continue to
live in a community."
Sides said she believes she can
find this sense of a close-knit com
munity in a co-op.
"I've heard from some of my
upperclassmen friends about co

ops," she added. "They have told
me about their positive experi
ences, and I wanted to look into
them."
Peter Johnston 'l4, a Synergy
resident, described his co-op is "a
big, loving, affectionate family."
"Coming home to Synergy is
like coming to your actual home,"
he said. "There is so much free
dom and independence living at
Synergy."
"With co-ops it's all about the
community," Durango said. "You
really invest yourself into the
housing community, cleaning and
cooking. Everyone feels responsi
ble and has a greater respect for
others, since there is a sense of
communal ownership."
Though the effects of the poli
cy have yet to be seen, Johnston
doesn't believe that the changes
will affect the atmosphere at Syn
ergy or other co-ops.
"This year we had lots of fresh
men come and visit Synergy, and
there were tons who pre-as
signed," Johnston said. "I think
this [policy] will just reduce the
number of people who pre-as
sign."
"Ultimately, it seems like most
of the people who would use Tier
3 to draw into co-ops would also
use their Tier 2 as well," he added.

With tonight's deadline for pre-assign
ment fast approaching, a new housing poli
cy will require students who wish to pre-as
sign into a cooperative house for the 2012-
13 academic year to use their Tier 2 housing
preference.
While in the past students had been able
to draw into co-ops such as Kairos and En
chanted Broccoli Forrest (EBF) with their
Tier 3 housing preference, now all co-ops
require the use of a Tier 2 preference.
This change means that for students who
have already used their Tier 2 housing,
choosing to pre-assign to a co-op will re
quire that they use their Tier 1 housing pref
erence.
Anthony So 'l4 was planning to use his

Tier 3 housing choice to pre-assign into a
co-op during his junior year. "But now I
can't," he said, suggesting that he doesn't
want to use his Tier 1 preference to land in
a co-op.
"I like the idea of pre-assigning," So
added. "Living in a co-op is a great way to
meet people and have a sense of communi
ty."
"It seems like this policy really limits the
amount that you can diversify your Stan
ford experience through housing," So said.
"Basically, you have to live in a dorm for the
majority of the time."
Gabriella Durango 'l2 said she also be
lieves that the new policy is restricting to in
dividuals who are looking to live in a co-op.
She predicted that the change would be met
with negative feedback.
"It seems like housing is getting homog

enized," Durango said.
"I personally don't like it," she added.
"Not only does it limit people's choices, but
it could destroy a community that people
really treasure."
According to Durango, the community
atmosphere of co-ops appeals strongly to
individuals who feel much more comfort
able living in a co-op rather than a dorm.
"Co-ops are getting more and more
popular, but it seems like this policy is just
another way to facilitate the homogeniza
tion of housing at Stanford," she said.
A ResEd assistant dean did not respond
to a request for comment in time for publi
cation.
Some students, however, said they be
lieve that the change of policy might offe
more enthusiasm and interest in
the co-ops themselves.
"Maybe people will have a bet
ter chance of drawing into the co
op that they want because they
are using their Tier 2," said Maddy
Sides 'l5, a Daily photo editor.
"That way, everyone who would
pre-assign to the co-op would be
really enthusiastic about it since it
would be their top choice."
Part of the appeal of the co-ops
at Stanford is that they offer an al
ternative style of living, with a
strong sense of community and
ownership. This is often a major
factor influencing students who
choose to pre-assign into co-ops,
according to Sides.
