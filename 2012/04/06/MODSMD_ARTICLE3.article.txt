# Tier 2 required for co-ops
## Requirement for co-op pre-assignment more stringent, deadline tonight 
### ISSRA OMER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With tonight's deadline for pre-assign
ment fast approaching, a new housing poli
cy will require students who wish to pre-as
sign into a cooperative house for the 2012-
13 academic year to use their Tier 2 housing
preference.
While in the past students had been able
to draw into co-ops such as Kairos and En
chanted Broccoli Forrest (EBF) with their
Tier 3 housing preference, now all co-ops
require the use of a Tier 2 preference.
This change means that for students who
have already used their Tier 2 housing,
choosing to pre-assign to a co-op will re
quire that they use their Tier 1 housing pref
erence.
Anthony So 'l4 was planning to use his

Tier 3 housing choice to pre-assign into a
co-op during his junior year. "But now I
can't," he said, suggesting that he doesn't
want to use his Tier 1 preference to land in
a co-op.
"I like the idea of pre-assigning," So
added. "Living in a co-op is a great way to
meet people and have a sense of communi
ty."
"It seems like this policy really limits the
amount that you can diversify your Stan
ford experience through housing," So said.
"Basically, you have to live in a dorm for the
majority of the time."
Gabriella Durango 'l2 said she also be
lieves that the new policy is restricting to in
dividuals who are looking to live in a co-op.
She predicted that the change would be met
with negative feedback.
"It seems like housing is getting homog

enized," Durango said.
"I personally don't like it," she added.
"Not only does it limit people's choices, but
it could destroy a community that people
really treasure."
According to Durango, the community
atmosphere of co-ops appeals strongly to
individuals who feel much more comfort
able living in a co-op rather than a dorm.
"Co-ops are getting more and more
popular, but it seems like this policy is just
another way to facilitate the homogeniza
tion of housing at Stanford," she said.
A ResEd assistant dean did not respond
to a request for comment in time for publi
cation.
Some students, however, said they be
lieve that the change of policy might offe
