## ASB celebrates 25th year 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
A record 193 students participated
in the 18 Alternative Spring Break
(ASB) trips offered this year, which
tackled issues including education re
form in New York City and the preven
tion and treatment of Alzheimer's.
Celebrating its 25th anniversary
this year, ASB is a voluntary student
organization, closely affiliated with the
Flaas Center for Public Service, which
has the goal of exposing "students to
complex social and cultural issues
through community visits, experiential
learning, direct service, group discus
sion, readings and reflection activi
ties," according to the group's website.
The program received nearly 890
applications this year, submitted by
360 individuals. Each student may
apply for up to three trips each year.
"The turnout was definitely a lot
higher than last year," said Sarah Flen
nessy 'l2, executive director of ASB.
"Every year we're adding more trips.
Last year we had 17 trips, and next year
we're aiming to offer 20 to 22 ASB
trips."
Because of this high student inter

est, Hennessy said ASB is also plan
ning to expand its program this fall to
offer three to five trips during Thanks
giving break, what she described as a
"shorter version of ASB."
The ASB management team is cur
rently planning the new Thanksgiving
offerings, hoping to preserve the fac
tors that have made the spring break
trips a success.
"Students would attend one or two
six-hour seminars and then four days
out in the field before coming back to
the Haas Center to share their public
service experiences," Hennessy said of
the current proposal for the fall trips.
"We want to preserve the ethics and
principles of service learning taught
during ASB," she added. "We never
just send people out in the field; they
need to be prepared, know service
learning principles and have some con
tent knowledge. This will be built into
the Thanksgiving break program, but
just in a different way than the ASB
program is."
Spring ASB trips currently require
that participants take a one-unit
course throughout winter quarter to
