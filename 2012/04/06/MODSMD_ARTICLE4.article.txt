# STUDENT LIFE
## ASB celebrates 25th year 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
A record 193 students participated
in the 18 Alternative Spring Break
(ASB) trips offered this year, which
tackled issues including education re
form in New York City and the preven
tion and treatment of Alzheimer's.
Celebrating its 25th anniversary
this year, ASB is a voluntary student
organization, closely affiliated with the
Flaas Center for Public Service, which
has the goal of exposing "students to
complex social and cultural issues
through community visits, experiential
learning, direct service, group discus
sion, readings and reflection activi
ties," according to the group's website.
The program received nearly 890
applications this year, submitted by
360 individuals. Each student may
apply for up to three trips each year.
"The turnout was definitely a lot
higher than last year," said Sarah Flen
nessy 'l2, executive director of ASB.
"Every year we're adding more trips.
Last year we had 17 trips, and next year
we're aiming to offer 20 to 22 ASB
trips."
Because of this high student inter

est, Hennessy said ASB is also plan
ning to expand its program this fall to
offer three to five trips during Thanks
giving break, what she described as a
"shorter version of ASB."
The ASB management team is cur
rently planning the new Thanksgiving
offerings, hoping to preserve the fac
tors that have made the spring break
trips a success.
"Students would attend one or two
six-hour seminars and then four days
out in the field before coming back to
the Haas Center to share their public
service experiences," Hennessy said of
the current proposal for the fall trips.
"We want to preserve the ethics and
principles of service learning taught
during ASB," she added. "We never
just send people out in the field; they
need to be prepared, know service
learning principles and have some con
tent knowledge. This will be built into
the Thanksgiving break program, but
just in a different way than the ASB
program is."
Spring ASB trips currently require
that participants take a one-unit
course throughout winter quarter to
explore the topics of their trips.
Thirty-six student volunteers
led this year's trips. According to
Hennessy, leader selection, done
in pairs, happens during spring
quarter the year before a trip is
scheduled. Leaders propose a trip
topic with a rough itinerary and in
terview with the ASB directing
team.
After selection, leaders plan
their trip during summer and later
take a fall quarter leader prepara
tion class. After receiving appli
cants, team leaders rank potential
participants, who are then sorted
among the various trips they ap
plied for to ensure best fit.
"We try to create a balanced
group," said Dominique Mikell
'l4, a trip leader this year. "We
consider different experiences and
think about the group dynamics."
Mikell led "Justice Deferred:
The Realities of California's Juve
nile Justice System" with Rameer
ah Anderson 'l2 this year.
"We went on the Justice De
ferred ASB trip last year and had a
great time," Anderson said. "But
we also had different interests ...
and wanted to talk about main
topics that people weren't paying
too much attention to. Our own in
terests included education and
gender and race disparities."
"For our trip, we visited many
juvenile halls and organizations in
Oakland, Santa Clara and San
Mateo," Mikell said. "In Sacra
mento, we learned more in depth
about Senate Bill 9 and also had
dinner with a probation officer."
Mikell added that the group
also had an opportunity for direct
service, serving breakfast to the
homeless at a church that hosted
them during the break.
"All the participants got to talk
directly to the people that were
having these kinds of experi
ences," she said. "This created a
balance between learning and
service, so that we see what we can
do and the ways we can partici
pate."
ASB receives funding from
ASSU Special Fees. The student
body approved the program's
$80,358.25 budget last year. In this
year's spring election, ASB is cam
paigning for $84,760.00 in special
fees.
"Trip leaders are accountable
for all their expenses," said Sher

lene Chatterji 'l4, associate direc
tor of finance for ASB. As for the
participants, Chatterji said, "Each
student pays a fee to participate,
but we offer financial aid to those
who need it."
Chatterji reported that a total
of $ll,OOO of financial aid was
given to students: $9,000 for out
of-state airfare and $2,000 for non
airfare trips. She added, however,
that ASB doesn't pay entirely for
any individual, and each partici
pant pays a minimum of $4O for his
or her spring break trip.
This year marks the 25th an
niversary of ASB, and the group
will hold a reunion on Saturday to
mark the occasion.
"We've invited any program
alumni to come back, and we got a
huge response," Hennessy said.
She expects 200 to 250 people to
attend the reunion.
"In the future, we hope to cre
ate a mentorship program with
alumni who have gone on to ca
reers in public service, so that they
can show how to shape a path in
public service," she added.
"The relationships you create
with your fellow participants and
leaders continue. We still commu
nicate with our past ASB leaders,"
Mikell said. "ASB isn't just a one
week experience; it lasts for the
rest of your Stanford career."
Kue Chang 'l5, a participant in
the trip "Asian American Issues:
From Identity to Action," agreed
with these sentiments.
"I realized that people can
enact a big change through the
community or by organizing,"
Chang said. "Not only can an indi
vidual make a difference, but a
larger group of people can make
even more of a positive differ
ence."

learning, direct service, group discus
sion, readings and reflection activi
ties," according to the group's website.
The program received nearly 890
applications this year, submitted by
360 individuals. Each student may
apply for up to three trips each year.
"The turnout was definitely a lot
higher than last year," said Sarah Flen
nessy 'l2, executive director of ASB.
"Every year we're adding more trips.
Last year we had 17 trips, and next year
we're aiming to offer 20 to 22 ASB
trips."
Because of this high student inter

est, Hennessy said ASB is also plan
ning to expand its program this fall to
offer three to five trips during Thanks
giving break, what she described as a
"shorter version of ASB."
The ASB management team is cur
rently planning the new Thanksgiving
offerings, hoping to preserve the fac
tors that have made the spring break
trips a success.
"Students would attend one or two
six-hour seminars and then four days
out in the field before coming back to
the Haas Center to share their public
service experiences," Hennessy said of
the current proposal for the fall trips.
"We want to preserve the ethics and
principles of service learning taught
during ASB," she added. "We never
just send people out in the field; they
need to be prepared, know service
learning principles and have some con
tent knowledge. This will be built into
the Thanksgiving break program, but
just in a different way than the ASB
program is."
Spring ASB trips currently require
that participants take a one-unit
course throughout winter quarter to
explore the topics of their trips.
Thirty-six student volunteers
led this year's trips. According to
Hennessy, leader selection, done
in pairs, happens during spring
quarter the year before a trip is
scheduled. Leaders propose a trip
topic with a rough itinerary and in
terview with the ASB directing
team.
After selection, leaders plan
their trip during summer and later
take a fall quarter leader prepara
tion class. After receiving appli
cants, team leaders rank potential
participants, who are then sorted
among the various trips they ap
plied for to ensure best fit.
"We try to create a balanced
group," said Dominique Mikell
'l4, a trip leader this year. "We
consider different experiences and
think about the group dynamics."
Mikell led "Justice Deferred:
The Realities of California's Juve
nile Justice System" with Rameer
ah Anderson 'l2 this year.
"We went on the Justice De
ferred ASB trip last year and had a
great time," Anderson said. "But
we also had different interests ...
and wanted to talk about main
topics that people weren't paying
too much attention to. Our own in
terests included education and
gender and race disparities."
"For our trip, we visited many
juvenile halls and organizations in
Oakland, Santa Clara and San
Mateo," Mikell said. "In Sacra
mento, we learned more in depth
about Senate Bill 9 and also had
dinner with a probation officer."
Mikell added that the group
also had an opportunity for direct
service, serving breakfast to the
homeless at a church that hosted
them during the break.
"All the participants got to talk
directly to the people that were
having these kinds of experi
ences," she said. "This created a
balance between learning and
service, so that we see what we can
do and the ways we can partici
pate."
ASB receives funding from
ASSU Special Fees. The student
body approved the program's
$80,358.25 budget last year. In this
year's spring election, ASB is cam
paigning for $84,760.00 in special
fees.
"Trip leaders are accountable
for all their expenses," said Sher

lene Chatterji 'l4, associate direc
tor of finance for ASB. As for the
participants, Chatterji said, "Each
student pays a fee to participate,
but we offer financial aid to those
who need it."
Chatterji reported that a total
of $ll,OOO of financial aid was
given to students: $9,000 for out
of-state airfare and $2,000 for non
airfare trips. She added, however,
that ASB doesn't pay entirely for
any individual, and each partici
pant pays a minimum of $4O for his
or her spring break trip.
This year marks the 25th an
niversary of ASB, and the group
will hold a reunion on Saturday to
mark the occasion.
"We've invited any program
alumni to come back, and we got a
huge response," Hennessy said.
She expects 200 to 250 people to
attend the reunion.
"In the future, we hope to cre
ate a mentorship program with
alumni who have gone on to ca
reers in public service, so that they
can show how to shape a path in
public service," she added.
"The relationships you create
with your fellow participants and
leaders continue. We still commu
nicate with our past ASB leaders,"
Mikell said. "ASB isn't just a one
week experience; it lasts for the
rest of your Stanford career."
Kue Chang 'l5, a participant in
the trip "Asian American Issues:
From Identity to Action," agreed
with these sentiments.
"I realized that people can
enact a big change through the
community or by organizing,"
Chang said. "Not only can an indi
vidual make a difference, but a
larger group of people can make
even more of a positive differ
ence."
