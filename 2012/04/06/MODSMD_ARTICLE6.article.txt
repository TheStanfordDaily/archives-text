# NEWS BRIEF
## Researchers find that warm lab mice produce more accurate tests 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Matt Bettonville 
A study by a group of Stanford re
searchers shows that uncomfortable,
chilly conditions for lab mice may be
partly responsible for the low reliabili
ty of animal drug testing. Currently
nine out of ten drugs tested in mice fail
in humans.
Joseph Garner, associate professor
of comparative medicine, and his team
recommend that lab mice and other
lab testing animals be given materials
to build nests in lab environments. Gar
ner predicts that this change will allow
lab mice to more naturally regulate
their temperature, which might make
them accept drugs in a more human
like way.
"If you want to design a drug that
will help a patient in the hospital, you
cannot reasonably do that in animals
that are cold-stressed and are compen
sating with an elevated metabolic
rate," Garner said.
The study was published March 30
online in PLoS One.
