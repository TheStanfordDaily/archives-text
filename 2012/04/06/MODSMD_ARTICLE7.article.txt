# Entrepreneurship Network offering concierge service
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Matt Bettonville 
The Stanford Technology Ventures
Program has a new face to help stu-
dents. Angela Hayward, coming to
Stanford from Khosla Ventures,
will serve as the Stanford Entrepre
neurship Network's first entrepre
neurship concierge, a resource for
developing programming and rela
tionships with Silicon Valley.
"Entrepreneurship thrives at
Stanford, but entrepreneurship
means different things to different
people," Hayward told the Stan
ford Report. "Each student has
unique needs, experiences and ap
petite for risk. Therefore, there's no
such thing as a 'standard' entrepre
neurship inquiry. Listening and
staying connected to students from

all over campus is key to the success
of this role."
A main role of the concierge
will be focusing on interdisciplinary
aspects of entrepreneurship, help
ing bring together business and en
gineering aspects of the field.
Largely, however, the Stanford
Entrepreneurship Network (SEN)
is leaving the role open to fill what
ever niche it finds.
"We are currently doing a field
test to see what is missing as an en
trepreneurship resource at Stan
ford, and we hope to share this in
formation with Angela so that she
and the rest of SEN can help us fill
those gaps," said Mary McCann,
president of the Business Associa
tion of Stanford Entrepreneurial
Students, to the Stanford Report.
