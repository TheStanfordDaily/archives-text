## Rheingold calls for new literacy in social media 
### LINDSEY TXAKEEYANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"You have to understand that everything you do
[on the Internet] now is going to be there forever, is
going to be searchable, is going to be reproducible
and is going to be broadcast around the world," said
Howard Rheingold during a discussion about his lat
est book, "Net Smart: How to Thrive Online" at
Braun Auditorium Thursday evening.
" [Rheingold] 's a really important Bay Area fig
ure," said Professor Fred Turner, director of the Sci
ence, Technology, and Society Program, which co
sponsored the talk along with the Department of
Communication. "He was the first to ever use the
words 'virtual communities' in print. He's been a real
ly influential thinker on virtual communities and col
laboration online for several decades."
Rheingold has written four books, including his
latest, and has served as editor for several publica
tions. He currently teaches "Virtual Communities
and Social Media" at Stanford.
"Instead of confining my inquiry to 'ls Google
making us stupid?' 'ls Facebook commoditizing our
privacy,' or 'ls Twitter chopping our attention into mi
croslices' all good questions I've been asking
myself and others how to use social media intelligent
ly, humanely, and above all, mindfully," Rheingold
wrote in an email to The Daily.
Rheingold said that "Net Smart" is the culmina-

tion of nearly 30 years of online ex
perience, research and multiple in
terviews with "contemporary mas
ters of social media such as
Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales, Stan
ford's Cliff Nass and others."
His lecture Thursday focused
on a summary of what he called
the five essential literacies of so
cial media: attention, participa
tion, collaboration, critical con
sumption and network know-how.
Rheingold summarized each of
these literacies into a few points.
They ranged from remembering
to breathe while reading one's
email to the idea that one should
"triangulate" while passing
around information on the Inter
net that is, find three good
sources that confirm the piece of
information before passing it on.
"The biggest thing I'm going to
take away is something I think me
and my friends forget a lot: to
make sure we're not in that 'echo
chamber,' we're not listening to
opinions that are like our own,"
said Crystal Nwaneri 'l3, reflect
ing on a point Rheingold made
about critical consumption.
"Probably one of the biggest

points he brought up in his presen
tation was talking about participa
tion in social media," said Justin
Wiguna 'l5, a social media intern
for the non-profit organization Be
A Remedy. "Social media is not
just what the website is. It's so
much more than that. Making the
networks, the connections through
social media seems to be a very im
portant and critical part of actual
ly using the social media for a pur
pose."
Both students said they feel
they will be taking steps toward
being more mindful about their
use of social media.
"One of the great things about
the Internet being almost shallow
is that it's not that hard to simply
change your practices," Nwaneri
said.
"The way you use a search en
gine, stream video from your
phone, update your Facebook sta
tus matters to you, to me and to
everyone," Rheingold said, "be
cause so much of our real lives de
pends on how knowledgeably and
mindfully we navigate digital
media, and because the way we
use these emerging media today
will influence the way they are
used and misused for decades to
come."
