## Hailing spring through Holi 
### SHIRLEYYARIN 
Having a fistful of magenta pow
der thrown at you upon entering
a festival might seem threaten
ing at first. But at Holi, a Hindu
celebration heralding the com
ing of spring and a new harvest, it is actually a
way of saying "Happy Holi!"
This past weekend, on Saturday and Sun
day from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Stanford's Asha for
Education put on its annual Holi celebration
at Sand Hill Fields.
The celebration comes from an Indian leg
end in which the son of a tyrannical king sur
vives a fire through the power of his devotion
to the god Vishnu. Typically celebrated on
March 8, Asha postponed the celebration fes
tival by a month in hopes of warmer weather.
This weekend, the 5,500 pounds of blue,
red, yellow, green and orange powder at Holi
represented the ashes from this myth. The tra
dition of throwing colors is also attributed to
the blossoming colors of spring, from a past in
which India was predominantly an agrarian
society following the seasonal crop table.
"Holi is now seen as a Hindu cultural tradi
tion that transcends religious boundaries,"
said Asha projects coordinator Arvind Krish
na, a fifth year Ph.D. candidate.
Not only does Holi transcend religious
boundaries, but it also focuses on breaching
class and social structures.
"Holi is an event open to people from dif
ferent races, religions and classes who are able
to come together and let go of social inhibi
tions," said Arnruta Hardikar, Holi media co
ordinator.
The experience of attendees echoed these
remarks.
"It was my first time attending Holi, and I
was surprised by how freely old and young
people lost themselves in the powder," said
Rebekah Oragwu 'l5.
Stanford's Asha chapter, founded in 1992,
started hosting Holi in 1999. Asha, meaning
'hope,' is a non-profit organization founded at
the University of California, Berkeley in 1991.
Since then, it has expanded to include more
than 50 chapters throughout the United
States, Europe and India.
Correspondingly, Asha's Holi at Sand Hill
Fields has grown from a small event with
around 200 participating students to a widely
anticipated event with more than 7,500 atten
dees. As the biggest Holi party in the Bay
Area, Stanford Holi attracts a mix of students

and families from miles around.
Along with water and color fights, partici
pants can enjoy Bollywood and pop music
from DJ Tanveer, performances by dance
groups such as Dance Identity and Stanford
Dil Se, and fresh Indian food.
Asha for Education's mission is to
fundraise for the education of underprivi
leged children in India.
"Each year, we feature a particular project
to put a face on the kind of work we do," Kr
ishna said.
Specifically, Asha has funded the creation
of eco-friendly schools in rural India in coop
eration with Steve Blank, a lecturer in the De
partment of Management Science and Engi
neering (MS&E). The project seeks to com
bine education, energy and economics to im
prove the quality of government schools.
Using energy-efficient building designs that
run on low-cost solar power systems, the proj
ect leaders plan to educate villagers on ener
gy-efficient agricultural practices.
"This is done to help the economy and to
help villagers by giving them access to techni

cal knowledge," Krishna said.
Asha has also raised funds for a school for
handicapped children in India. This school
focuses on addressing problems that physi
cally handicapped children face on a daily
basis by offering features such as accessible
ramps and concentrated teacher attention.
According to Krishna, even $lOO can make a
huge difference in the life of a blind student
through the purchase of a text-to-speech
converter.
By addressing problems that are endemic
to certain regions in India, both rural and

urban, Asha is able to provide opportunities
to children who do not have educational op
tions or privileges.
"At the end of the day, my efforts make it
possible for Asha to put a few thousand kids in
school," Hardikar said. "I think in the long run
this will probably lead to the emergence of a
better India."
In addition to providing financial support,
Asha also aids schools by putting them in
touch with officials to inform them of the
progress of their government funds, a right
guaranteed by India's Right to Information
Act.
"Raising money, of course, is one thing that
we do, but our goal is not just to raise money
but also help [disadvantaged students] in any
way we can," Krishna said.
While Holi at Stanford allows students to
let loose by tossing colored powder at friends
and strangers alike, dancing freely to music
blasting over Sand Hill Fields, it also presents
an opportunity to help students thousands of
miles away receive a good education.
"I felt carefree and able to let go of inhibi
tions and just enjoy spring while having fun
with my friends," said Guadalupe Ramirez
'l5. "You could throw powder at people you
didn't even know, like the water fight my
friends and I had with little kids. It was also
nice knowing it went to a good cause."
