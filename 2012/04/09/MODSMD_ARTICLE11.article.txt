# Holi's mythological roots

a oli is a festival of
T exuberance," said
I I Linda Hess, senior
I lecturer in the De
-A. -A. partment of Reli
gious Studies at Stanford. "It is the ex
pression of our more wild nature."
Though celebrations of Holi vary
widely across different regions of
India, they all create a momentary in
version of the highly rigid social order
that has historically existed in the
country. The entire community joins
together to throw colors, dyes, mud
and even dung at one another, regard
less of gender or caste. These rowdy
festivities commence with a bonfire
the night before Holi and continue
until the next morning. Around mid
day, people clean themselves up and
begin to assume their regular social
roles once again.
This inversion has implications
both on a universal and individual
level. In his famous article "The Feast
of Love," an account of his experience
in India during Holi, anthropologist
McKim Marriott wrote, "The dramat
ic balancing of Holi the world de

struction and world renewal, the world
pollution followed by world purifica
tion occurs not only on the abstract
level of structural principles, but also
in the person of each participant."
In fact, the concept of world de
struction and world renewal that Mar
riott alludes to can be traced back to
the mythological origins of Holi.
"Holi is often associated with the
god Vishnu," Hess said. "[lt is] the
story of the supreme being who takes
form on earth in order to save the uni
verse from degenerating into being
dominated by the forces of evil and
falsehood."
As the legend goes, the evil king Hi
ranyakashipu planned to kill Prahla
da, his own son, because of his devo
tion to Vishnu. He built a raging fire,
from which Prahlada's aunt, a de
moness named Holika, was supposed
ly immune. Prahlada was placed in
Holika's lap and Holika sat herself
upon the pyre, assured of her own sur
vival and of Prahlada's doom. Howev
er, Vishnu answered Prahlada's
prayers, and Prahlada escaped from
the fire unscathed while his aunt

burned to death. Later, Vishnu ap
peared on earth in the form of a half
lion half-man creature, killing the evil
king.
Yet there is another story behind
the Holi festival, a story that Marriott
struggled to reconcile with his wild ex
perience of Holi. It revolves around
the impassioned love relationship be
tween Vishnu's most popular avatar,
Krishna, and Radha, another
supreme figure. Together, they began
the festival that is now called Holi,
throwing color at each other and rev
eling with the young people of the vil
lage.
How can such raucous behavior be
linked back to the idea of love? Mar
riott found a possible explanation
through his research.
"[Through the disorderly nature of
Holi] each [participant] may ... learn
to play his own routine roles afresh,
surely with renewed understanding,
possibly with greater grace, perhaps
with a reciprocating love," Marriott
wrote.

The color-throwing component of Holi may derive from Krishna
and Radha, two lovers from Hindu lore who started the
practice when revelling with young villagers on earth.
