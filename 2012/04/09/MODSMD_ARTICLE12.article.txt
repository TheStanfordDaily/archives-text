## EDITORIAL The 						ideal ASSU senator 
### 
As eager ASSU Senate
candidates mill about din
ing halls, White Plaza and
dorm meetings soliciting votes
from their peers, the question of
what makes a good Senator is in
creasingly present in campus con
versations. This year's ASSU Sen
ate has received especially harsh
criticism for its ineffectiveness,
and an uncharacteristically low
number of candidates are cur
rently seeking to become mem
bers of the 14th ASSU Senate.
With these barriers in mind, then,
this marks a particularly relevant
time to reflect upon what makes
an ideal senator.

Though 80 percent of the cur
rent ASSU Senate candidates are
in the class of 2015, the ideal sena
tor is not a freshman. Though
freshmen are enthusiastic and
dedicated to the idea of student
government, many of them lack a
comprehensive understanding of
the ASSU Constitution and the
purpose of the Senate, to say noth
ing of the intricacies of financial
appropriations. This is not to say
that all freshmen are unqualified;
rather, it is a reflection of an
emerging pattern in the ASSU
Senate whereby senators spend
the first quarter of their term get
ting up to speed instead of carry
ing out their platforms. The institu
tional memory that upperclass
men (both incumbents and stu
dents without prior ASSU experi
ence) offer to the Senate is invalu
able, as it helps to facilitate the
transition and ensure that incom
ing Senators have a strong existing
knowledge about how the ASSU
functions.

Current freshmen running for
Senate should not be precluded
from doing so, but they should be
diligent about ensuring that their
understanding of the Senate's
structure and purpose is sound.
Being realistic about what the
Senate can and cannot accomplish
is one of the most important char
acteristics of a Senator, as that hu
mility in turn informs the way the
candidate views the scope of his or
her responsibilities. Reflecting this
viewpoint, one of the recommen
dations of the recent governing

documents report was to mandate
that a minimum of four senators
be upperclassmen. A more het
erogeneous mix of undergraduate
senators, mixing both freshmen
and upperclassmen, would create
a stronger ASSU Senate.
Senate candidates should also
realize that the ASSU should not
be a vehicle for personal ambition.
Any extracurricular pursuit that is
motivated primarily by a desire to
spruce up a resume, particularly
student government, is not likely
to result in a productive outcome
for the senator or the students he
or she claims to represent. In the
context of student government,
hubris and ego are extraordinarily
destructive forces, impeding the
extent to which senators can work
together and create tangible leg
islative outcomes.
The ideal senator also has ex
perience outside of student gov
ernment that he or she can bring
to the ASSU. This experience is
broadly defined, and can include
working as a resident assistant
(RA), serving as the financial offi
cer (FO) for a voluntary student
organization, or leading a student
start-up. A resident assistant, for
example, understands how to
work with different (and some
times divergent) interests and in
dividuals. Experience as a leader
of a start-up or as an FO is espe
cially relevant, as well, as these
roles give the candidate crucial
background in the minutiae of ap
propriations, which is what the
ASSU Senate does writ large.
The core function of the ASSU
is to connect students with various
types of resources. Senate candi
dates may promise transparency,
advocacy and accessibility, but
many seem to drown in these
buzzwords, losing sight of what the
ASSU can and should do for stu
dents. The Editorial Board be
lieves that restoring trust in the
ASSU Senate means electing sen
ators who are realistic, experi
enced, and humble. By looking
past platitudes and searching for
substance and diverse experi
ences, Stanford students can elect
representatives who will produce
impactful results.
