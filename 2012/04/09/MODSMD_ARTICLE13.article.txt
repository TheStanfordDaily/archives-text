## What is love? 
### Nina Chung 
What is love? ("Baby, don't
hurt me.") No, seriously.
Searching after this ques
tion's answer has dominated much
of my time here in college. Once
upon a time, I thought I knew the
answer: love was a thing to be dis
covered, waiting within special peo
ple I encountered.
As a result, I've spent my life lov
ing people I already know I like.
Maybe this is normal. But all this
time, I've been practicing how to
love my friends and family first: how
to reciprocate love to those who are
nice to me; how to publicly love the
less-fortunate in big ways. That's all
acceptable. But, honestly, it only re
flects the assumption that love is
limited. Thus, the best of me was re
served only for those relationships
that garnered me the most in re
turns. Even if I never realized it, I
was discriminate about who most
deserved me. And still, left to my
own broken ideas of what's best, I
revert to this strategic kind of life.
Actually, I'm sure this is normal.
Even my college-level economics
and international relations courses
try to teach me similar things. They
are often based on perceptions of
people as purely profit-minded, des
ignating their scarcest resources in
places that minimize loss. Naturally,
believing myself to be a good person,
I would never say that I was like that.
Yet a scarce resource is exactly how I
regarded my ability to be compas
sionate: I showered it on a select few
who returned the favor. How effi
cient, how rewarding. Haddaway's
song, ultimately, is more than just the
soundtrack to a funny skit. It's the
summary of this world's "fair" aver
sion to loving people who have hurt
us in response.
But here's where I draw a line.
Because I'm convinced that deep
down, we all know this kind of hu

manity isn't inevitable that there
must exist something better, eter
nal, omniscient. And there's a com
munity of remarkably unsuspi
cious-looking people, here, on this
campus, who believe in that. They
act on a commitment to see beyond
achievements, faces and flaws to ac
cept who someone really is. And
geez is it a struggle.
Why? Well, think of the class
mate who shamelessly dropped the
ball on your group project, or the
dormmate who trades your smile on
the stairwell for an vacant nonre
sponse, or the boy who suggested
hopeful things to you and promptly
forgot them all. Personally, I'm used
to responding to these people with
harsh words behind their backs. I've
laughed countless times with other
friends about a perpetrator's
wrongs against me to support my
own self-righteousness. I've cut so
many people off from my life so that
I could ignore that my treatment of
them was still an integral part of
who I am. Because, just as easily as I
shower loved ones with understand
ing and empathy, I regress to hurting
those who hurt me.
Let's be real. The norm is every
man for himself. And I always rea
soned that no relationship was gra
cious enough that I should give
more than I get back, or get more
than I give. The highest ideal I could
think of was equal give-and-take.
The love that challenges me now
is different. I have to will it, because
it's completely against my nature,
making it the most difficult thing I
will ever opt into. It's the challenge
of remembering that those people
who keep witnessing the worst of
me, with whom I feel incompatible,
are truly filled with the same inher
ent value and beauty that I see ef
fortlessly in my closest friends. The
challenge is running into them on

the street and drawing up a smile or
a nod for them and, in my heart of
hearts, honoring them with respect.
To remember that there's a beating
heart, and sad and deep and impor
tant stories, hidden within the per
son who hurts me that's the
hardest to do.

This perfect love is really not hu
manly possible. But there are peo
ple putting all their bets in life on
that single love, and more than any
thing in the world I want to seek
what they seek, too.
Ultimately, this isn't a challenge
I can absolutely accomplish. I know
it takes more than the lifetime I've
got. But there's no way could I set
tle for the love I once thought was
good enough, now that I've met the
greatest kind there is.

munity of remarkably unsuspi
cious-looking people, here, on this
campus, who believe in that. They
act on a commitment to see beyond
achievements, faces and flaws to ac
cept who someone really is. And
geez is it a struggle.
Why? Well, think of the class
mate who shamelessly dropped the
ball on your group project, or the
dormmate who trades your smile on
the stairwell for an vacant nonre
sponse, or the boy who suggested
hopeful things to you and promptly
forgot them all. Personally, I'm used
to responding to these people with
harsh words behind their backs. I've
laughed countless times with other
friends about a perpetrator's
wrongs against me to support my
own self-righteousness. I've cut so
many people off from my life so that
I could ignore that my treatment of
them was still an integral part of
who I am. Because, just as easily as I
shower loved ones with understand
ing and empathy, I regress to hurting
those who hurt me.
Let's be real. The norm is every
man for himself. And I always rea
soned that no relationship was gra
cious enough that I should give
more than I get back, or get more
than I give. The highest ideal I could
think of was equal give-and-take.
The love that challenges me now
is different. I have to will it, because
it's completely against my nature,
making it the most difficult thing I
will ever opt into. It's the challenge
of remembering that those people
who keep witnessing the worst of
me, with whom I feel incompatible,
are truly filled with the same inher
ent value and beauty that I see ef
fortlessly in my closest friends. The
challenge is running into them on

the street and drawing up a smile or
a nod for them and, in my heart of
hearts, honoring them with respect.
To remember that there's a beating
heart, and sad and deep and impor
tant stories, hidden within the per
son who hurts me that's the
hardest to do.

This perfect love is really not hu
manly possible. But there are peo
ple putting all their bets in life on
that single love, and more than any
thing in the world I want to seek
what they seek, too.
Ultimately, this isn't a challenge
I can absolutely accomplish. I know
it takes more than the lifetime I've
got. But there's no way could I set
tle for the love I once thought was
good enough, now that I've met the
greatest kind there is.

The love that
challenges me
now is different.
I have to will it.

What is love? ("Baby, don't
hurt me.") No, seriously.
Searching after this ques
tion's answer has dominated much
of my time here in college. Once
upon a time, I thought I knew the
answer: love was a thing to be dis
covered, waiting within special peo
ple I encountered.
As a result, I've spent my life lov
ing people I already know I like.
Maybe this is normal. But all this
time, I've been practicing how to
love my friends and family first: how
to reciprocate love to those who are
nice to me; how to publicly love the
less-fortunate in big ways. That's all
acceptable. But, honestly, it only re
flects the assumption that love is
limited. Thus, the best of me was re
served only for those relationships
that garnered me the most in re
turns. Even if I never realized it, I
was discriminate about who most
deserved me. And still, left to my
own broken ideas of what's best, I
revert to this strategic kind of life.
Actually, I'm sure this is normal.
Even my college-level economics
and international relations courses
try to teach me similar things. They
are often based on perceptions of
people as purely profit-minded, des
ignating their scarcest resources in
places that minimize loss. Naturally,
believing myself to be a good person,
I would never say that I was like that.
Yet a scarce resource is exactly how I
regarded my ability to be compas
sionate: I showered it on a select few
who returned the favor. How effi
cient, how rewarding. Haddaway's
song, ultimately, is more than just the
soundtrack to a funny skit. It's the
summary of this world's "fair" aver
sion to loving people who have hurt
us in response.
But here's where I draw a line.
Because I'm convinced that deep
down, we all know this kind of hu

manity isn't inevitable that there
must exist something better, eter
nal, omniscient. And there's a com
munity of remarkably unsuspi
cious-looking people, here, on this
campus, who believe in that. They
act on a commitment to see beyond
achievements, faces and flaws to ac
cept who someone really is. And
