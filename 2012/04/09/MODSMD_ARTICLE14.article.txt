# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Personal boxes and the ethics of race 
### Miles Unterreiner 
In an eloquently argued New
York Times Sunday Review arti
cle on March 16th, entitled "As
Black as We Wish to Be," author
Thomas Chatterton Williams ad
vances a provocative and thought
provoking argument: "mixed-race
blacks have an ethical obligation to
identify as black and interracial
couples share a similar moral im
perative to inculcate certain ideas
of black heritage and racial identity
in their mixed-race children, re
gardless of how they look."
Is this a good argument? Do
mixed-race individuals have an eth
ical obligation to identify as mem
bers of one race, rather than many
or none? And is there a special obli
gation in the case of mixed-race
African-Americans, given this
country's long history of racial dis
crimination?
I must respectfully disagree with
Mr. Williams and answer all three
with "no."
The first problem with Mr.
Williams' fear about authentic
"blackness" being lost in the chaotic
kaleidoscope of multiracial identity
is that he implicitly assumes there to
be an authentic "blackness" to begin
with. Defining a monolithic "black
ness" or, for that matter, any
ness" at all is not so simple as say
ing it exists.
The peoples white America has
long uncritically lumped together as
"black" have histories and cultures
too diverse and too unique to be es
sentialized in the breath of a single
word.
America's so-called "blacks" are
first-generation Ghanaian immi
grants; they are old families whose

mystic chords of memory tie their
past inextricably to that of the
slaveholding South and the civil
rights movement; they are the de
scendants of Brazilian mestizos
whose family trees boast a brambly
tangle of Amerindian, African, and
European colonial branches; they
are the sons and daughters of South
African freedom fighters forged in
the fires of apartheid.
What, then, is "blackness," and
does anyone have the right to de
fine it?
I worry also that Mr. Williams
veers dangerously close to endors
ing the old racial fantasy that char
acter follows blood that, to quote
Aime Cesaire's dictum in "Dis
courses on Colonialism," "if we
plumb the depths" of the modern
multiracial man, "then what we will
find is fundamentally black." It
seems rather like buying into the
very racial myth long perpetuated
by the prejudiced and the small
minded: that genes determine (or
ought to determine) how one acts,
thinks or interacts with others.
Third, identity is an intensely per
sonal choice, and often multiple iden
tities coexist and overlap within a sin
gle person. It is no one's business but
our own how we adjudicate our own
internal struggle for identity
whether we identify with our mother
or father, our "blackness" or "white
ness," the moral legacy of Frederick
Douglass, Cesar Chavez or Abra
ham Lincoln, or all of these at once.
Indeed, perhaps one of the most
beautiful parts of this community we
have here at Stanford is the spectac
ular way in which it constantly ex
plodes categories and renders old

boundaries meaningless.
Society draws strength from its
plurality and imbibes vitality from
the hybrid experiences of its not
quite, in-between people. The
daughter of a Singaporean busi
nessman and a Venezuelan lawyer,
the son of a Nigerian diplomat and
a Haitian-American doctor

these people's stories are so power
ful precisely because, unrestrained
by artificially enforced fidelity to a
single aspect of themselves, they are
free to embrace the many facets of
their lived experience.
We need only look in this regard
to the incredible story of our presi
dent, the son of a black man from

Kenya and a white woman from
Kansas who, as he patiently remind
ed us in the aftermath of the Jeremi
ah Wright fiasco, "can no more dis
own him than I can disown my
white grandmother." We could look
to psychology, which tells us that
mixed-race individuals are per
ceived as more attractive, or music,
where the melding of ethnic genres
gave birth to Elvis and The Beatles,
or architecture, where Spanish
colonial grandiosity and ultramod
ern elan blend in the campus we
know and love.
With the pernicious legacy of the
one-drop rule still staring coldly over
our shoulders with white Ameri-

ca exerting more than sufficient
pressure on black people to conform
to ancient stereotypes; with the
charge of "acting white" still limiting
the aspirations of young black chil
dren across the country; with sup
port for anti-miscegenation laws
among Southern Republicans still
hovering between 20 and 30 percent
it is high time we stopped putting
people in boxes. It is time we began
taking them out.

In an eloquently argued New
York Times Sunday Review arti
cle on March 16th, entitled "As
Black as We Wish to Be," author
Thomas Chatterton Williams ad
vances a provocative and thought
provoking argument: "mixed-race
blacks have an ethical obligation to
identify as black and interracial
couples share a similar moral im
perative to inculcate certain ideas
of black heritage and racial identity
in their mixed-race children, re
gardless of how they look."
Is this a good argument? Do
mixed-race individuals have an eth
ical obligation to identify as mem
bers of one race, rather than many
or none? And is there a special obli
gation in the case of mixed-race
African-Americans, given this
country's long history of racial dis
crimination?
I must respectfully disagree with
Mr. Williams and answer all three
with "no."
The first problem with Mr.
Williams' fear about authentic
"blackness" being lost in the chaotic
kaleidoscope of multiracial identity
is that he implicitly assumes there to
be an authentic "blackness" to begin
with. Defining a monolithic "black
ness" or, for that matter, any
ness" at all is not so simple as say
ing it exists.
The peoples white America has
long uncritically lumped together as
"black" have histories and cultures
too diverse and too unique to be es
sentialized in the breath of a single
word.
America's so-called "blacks" are
first-generation Ghanaian immi
grants; they are old families whose

mystic chords of memory tie their
past inextricably to that of the
slaveholding South and the civil
rights movement; they are the de
scendants of Brazilian mestizos
whose family trees boast a brambly
tangle of Amerindian, African, and
European colonial branches; they
are the sons and daughters of South
African freedom fighters forged in
the fires of apartheid.
What, then, is "blackness," and
does anyone have the right to de
fine it?
I worry also that Mr. Williams
veers dangerously close to endors
ing the old racial fantasy that char
acter follows blood that, to quote
Aime Cesaire's dictum in "Dis
courses on Colonialism," "if we
plumb the depths" of the modern
multiracial man, "then what we will
find is fundamentally black." It
seems rather like buying into the
very racial myth long perpetuated
by the prejudiced and the small
minded: that genes determine (or
ought to determine) how one acts,
thinks or interacts with others.

sonal choice, and often multiple iden
tities coexist and overlap within a sin
