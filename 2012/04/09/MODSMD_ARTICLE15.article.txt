## ROAD WOES ERASED CARD TAKES TWO FROM HUSKIES 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball has exhibited
a flair for the dramatic recently, and
in clinching a series win at Washing
ton this weekend, the No. 6 Cardi
nal needed all the late-inning drama
it could get to earn a victory in the
Saturday rubber game.
Junior third baseman Stephen
Piscotty (2-0) got his second win as
a reliever in just six days, and Stan
ford (19-7,4-5 Pac-12) took advan
tage of opportunistic ninth-inning
baserunning in the form of a
controversial interference call and a
classic first-third double steal to
take the series finale 8-6. With the
critical midseason win, Stanford
moves into a tie for seventh place in
the conference.
The Huskies (17-11, 4-5) still
took a bite out of the preseason
Pac-12 favorite Cardinal, jumping
out to an early lead on Friday and
winning the second leg of the three
game set 6-4. But after Stanford re
cently lost four in a row to confer
ence opponents including a road
sweep by Arizona last weekend
Cardinal head coach Mark Mar
quess got all he could ask for out of
his squad's trip to Washington: a se
ries win.
"We've struggled," Marquess
told GoStanford.com after the Sat
urday clincher. "We've been really
inconsistent ever since we came
back from break. We really haven't
hit the ball very well, and we've
been a bit sloppy defensively."
"I was real proud of the way we
battled back," he added.
Junior catcher Eric Smith had
seven hits for three RBIs on the trip,
while sophomore first baseman
Brian Ragira knocked in three runs
of his own as he continued a hit
streak that now stands at 11 games.
Stanford had a decent game at
the plate on Friday, coming up with
nine hits, but those base knocks just
didn't come at the right times as the

Cardinal stranded eight baserun
ners. Unfortunately, the squad got
off to another slow start. After
recording no hits in the first three
innings of a 5-2 Thursday win, it
took until the top of the fifth by
which point Stanford trailed 3-0
to break Husky starter Tyler Davis'
no-hitter on a double by sopho
more rightfielder Austin Wilson.
The Cardinal did get its first run
when Smith singled Wilson home,
but Washington's freshman
righthander was on a short leash
and got yanked in favor of sopho
more righty Tyler Kane, who
cleaned things up quickly in relief

The Huskies, meanwhile,
forced redshirt junior lefthander
Brett Mooneyham from the game
in the bottom of the sixth, improv
ing their lead to 5-1 with a three
hit, two-out rally. Stanford coun
tered by loading the bases with no
outs in the top of the seventh but
could only bring home two runs,
and Washington stretched its lead
back to three in the bottom half of
the frame.
Back-to-back doubles from
Smith and freshman designated hit
ter Alex Blandino made it 6-4 in the
eighth, yet the Huskies would not
yield further and Kane escaped

with his second win of the season.
Mooneyham moved to 5-2, with
both losses coming within a week of
one another.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
would waste no time in grabbing
the early lead. A second-inning
Smith double turned into a 1-0 ad
vantage when junior second base
man Kenny Diekroeger singled
him in, and Smith brought home
two more with the bases loaded in
the third. Junior ccnteificldcr Jake
Stewart doubled home Diekroeger
in the next frame to finish building
what looked like a comfortable 4-0
lead, with sophomore righthander
A.J. Vanegas cruising on the mound
in his first start since Feb. 19.
But Washington would crawl
back into contention, getting two
out tallies off Vanegas in the fifth
and sixth before tying the game
with a pair of seventh-inning runs
off freshman righty David Schmidt.
Stanford answered with solo
homers by Ragira and Diekroeger
in the eighth, and Marquess put Pis
cotty in at pitcher to close things
out, hoping that the preseason All-
American hitter would come up
with the same magic on the mound
that spurred him to 3.2 shutout in
nings earlier in the week against St.
Mary's. The Huskies kept getting
clutch hits, though, and after they
loaded the bases on a hit batsman
and an infield single, senior right
fielder Caleb Brown doubled
home two runs to knot things up at
six heading to the ninth.
After a leadoff strikeout by
Stewart, junior leftfielder Tyler
Gaffney reached on a single and
moved to third on a base hit by
Wilson. The next batter, Piscotty,
grounded to third and the speedy
Gaffney was caught in a run
down, but he drew an interference
call against senior catcher B.K.
Santy in between third and home
to get the Cardinal an unconven
tional 7-6 lead.
In the same inning, Ragira
struck out with Piscotty attempting
to steal second, and banking on get
ting the third out at second base.

Sophomore rightfielder Austin Wilson had hits in all three games this
weekend, as the Cardinal got a big series win at Washington to improve
its Pac-12 positioning early in the conference season.
Santy threw across the diamond.
Piscotty beat the throw, though, and
Wilson came home on the double
steal to make it 8-6.
An easy bottom of the ninth for
Piscotty sealed the series win, as the
junior got his second relief victory of
the week.
With No. 17 Oregon coming to
town for a three-game set this week
end fresh off a series win against No.
7 UCLA, Stanford has to get past
the recent slump that has kept it in

the bottom half of the Pac-12 stand
ings through the first four weeks of
conference play.
"We've got a lot of room for im
provement, but we've got seven
more weekends in the league com
ing up," Marquess said. "Hopefully
if we keep working hard, we'll get
better."
Before the Ducks come to
town, though, the Cardinal has a
pair of midweek tests ahead. The
Cardinal travels across the Bay to
face rival Cal at 2:30 p.m. this after
noon and will host Pacific at 5:30
p.m. tomorrow.

Sophomore rightfielder Austin Wilson had hits in all three games this
weekend, as the Cardinal got a big series win at Washington to improve
its Pac-12 positioning early in the conference season.
Santy threw across the diamond.
Piscotty beat the throw, though, and
Wilson came home on the double
steal to make it 8-6.
An easy bottom of the ninth for
Piscotty sealed the series win, as the
junior got his second relief victory of
the week.
With No. 17 Oregon coming to
town for a three-game set this week
end fresh off a series win against No.
7 UCLA, Stanford has to get past
the recent slump that has kept it in

the bottom half of the Pac-12 stand
ings through the first four weeks of
conference play.
"We've got a lot of room for im
provement, but we've got seven
more weekends in the league com
ing up," Marquess said. "Hopefully
if we keep working hard, we'll get
better."
Before the Ducks come to
town, though, the Cardinal has a
pair of midweek tests ahead. The
Cardinal travels across the Bay to
face rival Cal at 2:30 p.m. this after
noon and will host Pacific at 5:30
p.m. tomorrow.

Stanford baseball has exhibited
a flair for the dramatic recently, and
in clinching a series win at Washing
ton this weekend, the No. 6 Cardi
nal needed all the late-inning drama
it could get to earn a victory in the
Saturday rubber game.
Junior third baseman Stephen
Piscotty (2-0) got his second win as
a reliever in just six days, and Stan
ford (19-7,4-5 Pac-12) took advan
tage of opportunistic ninth-inning
baserunning in the form of a
controversial interference call and a
classic first-third double steal to
take the series finale 8-6. With the
critical midseason win, Stanford
moves into a tie for seventh place in
the conference.
The Huskies (17-11, 4-5) still
took a bite out of the preseason
Pac-12 favorite Cardinal, jumping
out to an early lead on Friday and
winning the second leg of the three
game set 6-4. But after Stanford re
cently lost four in a row to confer
ence opponents including a road
sweep by Arizona last weekend
Cardinal head coach Mark Mar
quess got all he could ask for out of
his squad's trip to Washington: a se
ries win.
"We've struggled," Marquess
told GoStanford.com after the Sat
urday clincher. "We've been really
inconsistent ever since we came
back from break. We really haven't
hit the ball very well, and we've
been a bit sloppy defensively."
"I was real proud of the way we
battled back," he added.
Junior catcher Eric Smith had
seven hits for three RBIs on the trip,
while sophomore first baseman
Brian Ragira knocked in three runs
of his own as he continued a hit
streak that now stands at 11 games.
Stanford had a decent game at
the plate on Friday, coming up with
nine hits, but those base knocks just
didn't come at the right times as the

Cardinal stranded eight baserun
ners. Unfortunately, the squad got
off to another slow start. After
recording no hits in the first three
innings of a 5-2 Thursday win, it
took until the top of the fifth by
which point Stanford trailed 3-0
to break Husky starter Tyler Davis'
no-hitter on a double by sopho
more rightfielder Austin Wilson.
The Cardinal did get its first run
when Smith singled Wilson home,
but Washington's freshman
righthander was on a short leash
and got yanked in favor of sopho
more righty Tyler Kane, who
cleaned things up quickly in relief

The Huskies, meanwhile,
forced redshirt junior lefthander
Brett Mooneyham from the game
in the bottom of the sixth, improv
ing their lead to 5-1 with a three
hit, two-out rally. Stanford coun
tered by loading the bases with no
outs in the top of the seventh but
could only bring home two runs,
and Washington stretched its lead
back to three in the bottom half of
the frame.
Back-to-back doubles from
Smith and freshman designated hit
ter Alex Blandino made it 6-4 in the
eighth, yet the Huskies would not
yield further and Kane escaped

with his second win of the season.
Mooneyham moved to 5-2, with
both losses coming within a week of
one another.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
would waste no time in grabbing
the early lead. A second-inning
Smith double turned into a 1-0 ad
vantage when junior second base
man Kenny Diekroeger singled
him in, and Smith brought home
two more with the bases loaded in
the third. Junior ccnteificldcr Jake
Stewart doubled home Diekroeger
in the next frame to finish building
what looked like a comfortable 4-0
lead, with sophomore righthander
A.J. Vanegas cruising on the mound
in his first start since Feb. 19.
But Washington would crawl
back into contention, getting two
out tallies off Vanegas in the fifth
and sixth before tying the game
with a pair of seventh-inning runs
off freshman righty David Schmidt.
Stanford answered with solo
homers by Ragira and Diekroeger
in the eighth, and Marquess put Pis
cotty in at pitcher to close things
out, hoping that the preseason All-
American hitter would come up
with the same magic on the mound
that spurred him to 3.2 shutout in
nings earlier in the week against St.
Mary's. The Huskies kept getting
clutch hits, though, and after they
loaded the bases on a hit batsman
and an infield single, senior right
fielder Caleb Brown doubled
home two runs to knot things up at
six heading to the ninth.
After a leadoff strikeout by
Stewart, junior leftfielder Tyler
Gaffney reached on a single and
moved to third on a base hit by
Wilson. The next batter, Piscotty,
grounded to third and the speedy
Gaffney was caught in a run
down, but he drew an interference
call against senior catcher B.K.
Santy in between third and home
to get the Cardinal an unconven
tional 7-6 lead.
In the same inning, Ragira
struck out with Piscotty attempting
to steal second, and banking on get
ting the third out at second base.
