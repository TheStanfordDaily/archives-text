The No. 11 Stanford men's tennis team
began its spring quarter on a particularly
strong note over the weekend, shutting out
both Oregon and Washington in back-to-back
7-0 victories.
These two Pac-12 matches were important
tests for a Cardinal team that is trying to build
momentum and strong play in anticipation of
the inaugural Pac-12 Championships, begin
ning on April 25 and the season-ending NCAA
tournament in mid-May.

Stanford is coming off three spring-break
matches that had varying levels of success; the
team got trounced 6-1 by No. 7 Pepperdine,
then bounced back with two solid wins against
Pac-12 foes Arizona and Colorado.Those were
Stanford's first Pac-12 matches of the season,
and coupled with those from this past week
end, gave the Cardinal a 4-0 record in Pac-12
play with matches against USC, UCLA and
Cal remaining.
Against the No. 62 Ducks on Friday after
noon, Stanford dominated from the very start


ALISA ROYER/The Stanford Daily
Freshman John Morrissey notched his 20th and 21st wins of the season this weekend against
Oregon and Washington, remaining the team leader in victories toward the end of Pac-12 play.
to collect its first shutout of the
year. Playing out of the No. 6 spot,
sophomore Daniel Ho recorded
another impressive win to give
Stanford a 2-0 lead. The senior
tandem of Bradley Klahn and
Ryan Thacher, who head coach
John Whitlinger called his "pair of
No. 1 players," continued their
dominance on both the singles
and doubles courts, easily taking
both of their individual matches
after a tough 8-6 doubles win.
Complementing the strong
play of the seniors, freshman
Robert Stineman cruised
through his match at the No. 5
court, notching his team-leading
20th win of the year while his
classmate John Morrissey won at
No. 4 for his 11th consecutive vic
tory, a streak that dates back to
Feb. 4.
Stanford continued its strong
play from Friday into its match
Saturday against the tricky No. 22
Huskies. Adding to the intrigue of
Saturday's match were the Senior
Day festivities, a celebration of
Klahn and Thacher, who have
both had outstanding careers for
the Cardinal.
Klahn and Thacher have had
many special moments during
their Cardinal careers most
notably their eight doubles titles
since teaming up together as
freshmen. They have also direct
ed the Cardinal to three straight
NCAA tournament appearances,

including a quarterfinal berth last
season. Klahn also has the most
prestigious collegiate singles title
to add to his ledger, the 2010
NCAA singles championship.
"It is obviously a special occa
sion for Ryan and I, and I have
been very lucky to have him as a
teammate, doubles partner and
friend every step of the way for
four years on the team," Klahn
said. "It is hard to believe my
time at Stanford is nearing the
end, and I have been very fortu
nate to attend such an incredible
university and play with a great
group of teammates and coaches.
I couldn't ask for a better group
to battle day-in and day-out with,
and that is what makes every
match so special."
The match on Saturday began
with a closely contested doubles
point that came down to the third
doubles court, where the fresh
man duo of Morrissey and Stine
man was locked in a battle for the
match's pivotal first point. True to
the form they have shown all year,
the freshmen rose to the challenge
and outlasted their opponents 9-8
in a tiebreaker, paving the way for
the Cardinal's victory.
Stanford has a quick turn
around with its penultimate home
match against San Francisco on
Tuesday. The squad then hits the
road for a crucial road trip to Los
Angeles to battle the No. 5 UCLA
Bruins and the No. 1 USCTrojans,
which both crushed Stanford in
their meetings earlier in the sea
son.
