The No. 11 Stanford men's tennis team
began its spring quarter on a particularly
strong note over the weekend, shutting out
both Oregon and Washington in back-to-back
7-0 victories.
These two Pac-12 matches were important
tests for a Cardinal team that is trying to build
momentum and strong play in anticipation of
the inaugural Pac-12 Championships, begin
ning on April 25 and the season-ending NCAA
tournament in mid-May.

Stanford is coming off three spring-break
matches that had varying levels of success; the
team got trounced 6-1 by No. 7 Pepperdine,
then bounced back with two solid wins against
Pac-12 foes Arizona and Colorado.Those were
Stanford's first Pac-12 matches of the season,
and coupled with those from this past week
end, gave the Cardinal a 4-0 record in Pac-12
play with matches against USC, UCLA and
Cal remaining.
Against the No. 62 Ducks on Friday after
noon, Stanford dominated from the very start
