# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Broncos bucked in 7-0 win EARLY START DOESN'T HOLD BACK CARDINAL 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 women's tennis team com
pleted its seventh shutout victory in a row
on Saturday, defeating Santa Clara 7-0
without any player dropping a set.
Other than the rare decision to play the
singles matches first because of a poten
tial scheduling conflict with men's tennis,
everything ran like clockwork for the Car
dinal (15-0,6-0 Pac-12) in its last non-con
ference match of the season. According to
head coach Lele Forood, this match was
really about "sharpening up" and having
the team "keep playing better and better,"
as Stanford will need to be at its best as it
prepares for a tough finish to the Pac-12
season that includes a visit from current
No. 1 UCLA next Saturday.
Both the 9:30 a.m. start time and hav
ing the doubles pushed back created an
unusual set of conditions to begin the
match. The women usually play in the af
ternoon, and doubles are normally only
played second if there is fear of inclement
weather.
The changes did not take their toll on
the Cardinal, though, as all the players
took early first-set leads.
"[Playing singles first] takes us out of
our routine a little," said sophomore
Nicole Gibbs, "but everyone did a really
good job of jumping out early."
Stanford did a much better job than
Santa Clara of dealing with the change in
match preparation, as the Cardinal's con
tingent on the first five courts only lost a
combined five games in their first sets.
Sophomore Amelia Herring was the ex
ception, as she was pushed to a 7-5 first-set
victory on court six in only her third sin
gles match of the year. She found her
rhythm after breaking at 6-5 to win the set,
though, and was the only Stanford player
not to drop a game in her second set.
Gibbs did not have such an easy time
with her second set at court one. After
winning the first set 6-2 it looked like she
was on her way to a straightforward win,
but her opponent Katie Le came out
strong in the second set and actu
ally took a 4-3 lead. Gibbs was vis
ibly frustrated at her play, so
much so that Forood took her
first visit down to the court on the
changeover. Along with some
technical advice, "she really came
down there to settle me down,"
Gibbs said of the visit.
She broke the next game at 15,
at which point she was the last sin
gles match still playing. Gibbs
noted that being the last player on
the courts and having the rest of
her teammates watching "can be
a little stressful... but it upped
my energy and intensity." She
went on to win the rest of her
games and finish off Le 6-4.
Junior Mallory Burdette had
been finished on court two beside
Gibbs, cruising to a 6-1,6-1 victo
ry and getting off the courts be
fore any of her teammates.
"This is all just preparation for
the Big Dance in May," Burdette
said, noting that she is still looking
to improve on "being more ag
gressive in singles and finishing
more points off at the net."
Courts three and four saw
freshman Ellen Tsay and senior
Veronica Li take easy wins after
both players were shifted up a
court because of the absence of
the injured Stacey Tan. Tsay took
her sets 6-1,6-4 and Li won 6-1,6-
2. Junior Natalie Dillon won six
games in a row twice, losing the
first three games of the second set
in between, for a 6-0,6-3 win.
While Tan did not play singles,
she did pair up with Tsay in dou

bles for an 8-1 victory. Burdette
and Gibbs matched that with an
8-1 victory of their own, while Dil
lon and Li took a little bit more
time in their 8-3 win.
Stanford now prepares to host
USC and UCLA this weekend,
with the Trojans coming to the
Farm on Friday at 1:30 p.m. and
the Bruins arriving for a Saturday
showdown at noon.
