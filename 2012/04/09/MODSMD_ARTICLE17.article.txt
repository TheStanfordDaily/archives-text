## Broncos bucked in 7-0 win EARLY START DOESN'T HOLD BACK CARDINAL

The No. 6 women's tennis team com
pleted its seventh shutout victory in a row
on Saturday, defeating Santa Clara 7-0
without any player dropping a set.
Other than the rare decision to play the
singles matches first because of a poten
tial scheduling conflict with men's tennis,
everything ran like clockwork for the Car
dinal (15-0,6-0 Pac-12) in its last non-con
ference match of the season. According to
head coach Lele Forood, this match was
really about "sharpening up" and having
the team "keep playing better and better,"

the Cardinal, though, as all the players
took early first-set leads.
"[Playing singles first] takes us out of
our routine a little," said sophomore

Stanford did a much better job than
Santa Clara of dealing with the change in
match preparation, as the Cardinal's con
tingent on the first five courts only lost a
combined five games in their first sets.
Sophomore Amelia Herring was the ex
ception, as she was pushed to a 7-5 first-set
victory on court six in only her third sin
gles match of the year. She found her
rhythm after breaking at 6-5 to win the set,
though, and was the only Stanford player
not to drop a game in her second set.
Gibbs did not have such an easy time
with her second set at court one. After
winning the first set 6-2 it looked like she
was on her way to a straightforward win,
but her opponent Katie Le came out
