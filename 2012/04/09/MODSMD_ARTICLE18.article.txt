# Predicting the MLB season
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
It's the second week of April,
which means March Madness
and the Masters have given
way to the start of baseball
season. And that means it's
time for Jumping to Ridiculous
Conclusions, Volume 2! Since I'm
far too lazy to physically jump to
these conclusions, here's my second
annual way-too-early MLB col
umn.
Last year, I analyzed the first
week of the season to predict what
would happen at the end of the year,
and to everyone's surprise, the first
week didn't adequately predict the
entire season.
But I've learned my lesson. As a
mathematical and computational
science major, I can tell you that last
year's sample size was far too big. So
I've taken it upon myself to write
this column after the first full week
end of the season, when just 48 of
the 2,430 games have been played.
Here's what we've learned so far in
Major League Baseball.
As expected, the World Series
looks like it could very well come
down to a battle of eastern teams.
Both the Mets and Orioles complet
ed three-game home sweeps on
Sunday thanks to starters that flirt
ed with no-hitters. Next stop, Fall
Classic!
Likelihood of this happening:
about the chance of me getting a
double eagle in the final round of
the Masters. And I've never played
golf.
In fact, winning your opening se
ries isn't much of a sign of postsea
son success. Three of the last four
World Series champs lost their
opening series 2-1. So maybe we
should be looking for a Phillies-An
gels World Series after both lost two
in a row to sub-.500 central teams.
Likelihood of this happening:
decent. Despite their poor starts,
both are expected to contend for
their respective pennants. The
Phillies are aging but still as talented
as anyone in the National League,
while the Angels pulled the ultimate
offseason trifecta of adding the best
hitter available (Albert Pujols),
adding the best pitcher available
(C.J. Wilson) and subtracting the
worst hitter available (Jeff Mathis).
If you want to look for a star
pitcher in the American League,
you could look at obvious guys like
Justin Verlander and Jered Weaver,
who each threw eight shutout in
nings in their first start. But if you
want a real Cy Young threat, how
about Verlander's teammate Duane
Below? He leads the majors with
two wins already and has allowed
just one baserunner all year.
Likelihood of this happening:
none. Sorry, Duane, but a middle re
liever with zero career wins before
this season isn't going to take home
the trophy, even if you don't allow a
run all year.
As far as hitting, the early season
hasn't lacked power. Four players
Miguel Cabrera, Yoenis Ces
pedes, Corey Hart and Jay Bruce
have already hit three home runs
apiece. Hart and Bruce are two of
the better power hitters in the Na
tional League, and Cabrera may
very well be the best hitter in the
game, but Cespedes has been cap
turing the nation's attention (which
is hard to do when you play for the
A's) with his mammoth home runs.
Could this quartet be at the top of
the home run lists at season's end?
Likelihood of this happening:
unlikely, but definitely possible.
With the departures of Pujols and
Prince Fielder to the American
League, the National League lost
two of its three best home-run hit
ters, so Hart and Bruce could be two
of the best sluggers left. Cabrera has
hit 30 home runs in seven of the past
eight years, so I wouldn't put it past
him. At some point, AL pitchers will
stop throwing Cespedes belt-high
fastballs and make him work for his
homers, and you'd have to think that
Pujols and Fielder (not to mention
Jose Bautista and the whole Yan
kees and Rangers rosters) will fac
tor into the home run races.
For all the good so far, there's of
course been an equal amount of
bad, and for some of the big boys,
opening weekend was less than stel
lar. Three of the past five champs
the Giants, Yankees and Red Sox
got swept in their opening series.
This is particularly surprising for the

Yankees, who, prior to their week
end sweep at the hands of the Rays,
had not been swept to start a season
since 1998.Andthatyear New York
won 114 games and the World Se
ries. So don't cry for the Yankees yet
(not that you ever would).
Likelihood of this happening:
very unlikely. For as much talent as
the Yankees have (what else is
new), there is a whole lot of other
talent in that division. Winning over
70 percent of the next 159 games
will be almost impossible when
over a third of them will be against
Boston, Tampa Bay and Toronto, al
though the World Series is certainly
in play for the Bombers.

With so much to be determined
over the next seven months, I
might as well throw my own guess
es into the mix. I'll say the Rays,
Tigers and Rangers will win their
divisions in the American League,
with the Yankees and Angels as
the wild cards, and the Phillies,
Reds and Diamondbacks will win
their divisions in the National
League, with the Cardinals and
Giants as the wild cards. I'll go
Rays-Reds in the World Series,
with Tampa Bay bringing home its
first title.
Likelihood of this happening:
not a chance.

about Verlander's teammate Duane
Below? He leads the majors with
two wins already and has allowed
just one baserunner all year.
Likelihood of this happening:
none. Sorry, Duane, but a middle re
liever with zero career wins before
this season isn't going to take home
the trophy, even if you don't allow a
run all year.
As far as hitting, the early season
hasn't lacked power. Four players
Miguel Cabrera, Yoenis Ces
pedes, Corey Hart and Jay Bruce
have already hit three home runs
apiece. Hart and Bruce are two of
the better power hitters in the Na
tional League, and Cabrera may
very well be the best hitter in the
game, but Cespedes has been cap
turing the nation's attention (which
is hard to do when you play for the
A's) with his mammoth home runs.
Could this quartet be at the top of
the home run lists at season's end?
Likelihood of this happening:
unlikely, but definitely possible.
With the departures of Pujols and
Prince Fielder to the American
League, the National League lost
two of its three best home-run hit
ters, so Hart and Bruce could be two
of the best sluggers left. Cabrera has
hit 30 home runs in seven of the past
eight years, so I wouldn't put it past
him. At some point, AL pitchers will
stop throwing Cespedes belt-high
fastballs and make him work for his
homers, and you'd have to think that
Pujols and Fielder (not to mention
Jose Bautista and the whole Yan
kees and Rangers rosters) will fac
tor into the home run races.
For all the good so far, there's of
course been an equal amount of
bad, and for some of the big boys,
opening weekend was less than stel
lar. Three of the past five champs
the Giants, Yankees and Red Sox
got swept in their opening series.
This is particularly surprising for the

Yankees, who, prior to their week
end sweep at the hands of the Rays,
had not been swept to start a season
since 1998.Andthatyear New York
won 114 games and the World Se
ries. So don't cry for the Yankees yet
(not that you ever would).
Likelihood of this happening:
very unlikely. For as much talent as
the Yankees have (what else is
new), there is a whole lot of other
talent in that division. Winning over
70 percent of the next 159 games
will be almost impossible when
over a third of them will be against
Boston, Tampa Bay and Toronto, al
though the World Series is certainly
in play for the Bombers.

With so much to be determined
over the next seven months, I
might as well throw my own guess
es into the mix. I'll say the Rays,
Tigers and Rangers will win their
divisions in the American League,
with the Yankees and Angels as
the wild cards, and the Phillies,
Reds and Diamondbacks will win
their divisions in the National
League, with the Cardinals and
Giants as the wild cards. I'll go
Rays-Reds in the World Series,
with Tampa Bay bringing home its
first title.
Likelihood of this happening:
not a chance.

It's the second week of April,
which means March Madness
and the Masters have given
way to the start of baseball
season. And that means it's
time for Jumping to Ridiculous
Conclusions, Volume 2! Since I'm
far too lazy to physically jump to
these conclusions, here's my second
annual way-too-early MLB col
umn.
Last year, I analyzed the first
week of the season to predict what
would happen at the end of the year,
and to everyone's surprise, the first
week didn't adequately predict the
entire season.
But I've learned my lesson. As a
mathematical and computational
science major, I can tell you that last
year's sample size was far too big. So
I've taken it upon myself to write
this column after the first full week
end of the season, when just 48 of
the 2,430 games have been played.
Here's what we've learned so far in
Major League Baseball.
As expected, the World Series
looks like it could very well come
down to a battle of eastern teams.
Both the Mets and Orioles complet
ed three-game home sweeps on
Sunday thanks to starters that flirt
ed with no-hitters. Next stop, Fall
Classic!
Likelihood of this happening:
about the chance of me getting a
double eagle in the final round of
the Masters. And I've never played
golf.
In fact, winning your opening se
ries isn't much of a sign of postsea
son success. Three of the last four
World Series champs lost their
opening series 2-1. So maybe we
should be looking for a Phillies-An
gels World Series after both lost two
in a row to sub-.500 central teams.
Likelihood of this happening:
decent. Despite their poor starts,
both are expected to contend for
their respective pennants. The
Phillies are aging but still as talented
as anyone in the National League,
while the Angels pulled the ultimate
offseason trifecta of adding the best
hitter available (Albert Pujols),
adding the best pitcher available
(C.J. Wilson) and subtracting the
worst hitter available (Jeff Mathis).
If you want to look for a star
pitcher in the American League,
you could look at obvious guys like
Justin Verlander and Jered Weaver,
who each threw eight shutout in
nings in their first start. But if you
want a real Cy Young threat, how
about Verlander's teammate Duane
Below? He leads the majors with
two wins already and has allowed
just one baserunner all year.
Likelihood of this happening:
none. Sorry, Duane, but a middle re
