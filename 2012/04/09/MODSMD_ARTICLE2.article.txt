"Have you ever had snakemeat? Rat
meat? Have you ever stolen anything?"
Yosep Baek, a former North Korean sol
dier, asked a packed Old Union Clubhouse
Ballroom on Friday evening. "If you're part
of the North Korean army, you can't live
without those things."
Along with Eun-A Park, a fellow defec
tor, Baek led a panel discussion on the
human rights crisis in North Korea. The
evening focused in particular on the reset
tlement of North Korean youth defectors
within South Korea.
David Straub, associate director of Stan
ford's Korean Studies Program and the
event's moderator, stressed the importance
of moving beyond a focus on North Korea's
nuclear weapons program when discussing
the pariah state, advocating by contrast a re
newed focus on more human aspects such
as the experience of defectors.
According to Lily Kim 'l3, co-chair of
the Korean Students Association (KSA),
the event has been a regular occurrence
since 2009 and while defectors are not
necessarily brought to campus every year
the basic goal essentially remains the
same.
"We want to raise awareness, and we
want to share the story so that people gain
their perspective of looking at and under
standing North Korean issues, reality and
defectors, and how that's related to us," Kim
said.
"I don't specifically see it as a North Ko
rean issue or a South Korean issue," Kim
added. "I see it as our issue. I guess the point
was to see how we could bridge the gap."
Kim noted that bringing in youth defec-

tors offered the opportunity to
develop a connection with Stan
ford students, making similarities
and differences more immediate
and apparent.
"For people like us, who rela
tively [have] had very little hard
ship in our lives, it's hard to imag
ine how people like this both
want to tell that story and how
much it hurts to tell that story,"
Straub said.
Park was the first to speak,
with KSA member Rachelle Han
'l5 translating.
Park initially fled North Korea
for China with her mother in 1998
at the age of 10, prompted by
famine in her home country, but
they were unable to find the rela
tives they had planned to meet.
They were instead sold to a house
in rural China where they were
forced to work.
Being sold, Park said, is com
mon because it affords defectors
a relatively safe way to live and
eat.
"They treated us as an asset in
stead of people," Park said.
Park and her mother were
repatriated to North Korea three
times in total, each time fortunate
not to be executed upon their re
turn.
Returning for the first time
from the border to her home in
North Korea required a five-day
journey on a train lacking food
and water supplies. Park who
was only 12 years old at the time
recalled being on the brink of
fainting from hunger.
"I felt that I could even under
stand why people ate human be
ings," Park said. "If you starve for
three days, then you start seeing
people as meat."
Although they were caught
again in 2003, they fled for China
once more in 2006 before making
their way to Mongolia and even
tually South Korea.
In contrast to Park, Baek's ori
gins did not suggest his ultimate
defection. His father was a high
ranking general and his family
members were "true believers" in
the regime and in North Korea's
rulers as "great gods, greater than
any religious gods," he said.
"For me, betraying [the

regime] was a greater crime than
any other crime there was," Baek
said.
Baek entered the North Kore
an army at 17 and despite
weighing approximately 93
pounds and standing only five
feet tall suffered extensively
from malnutrition, dropping to 68
pounds after a year and a half.

Baek's journey began when he
heard a South Korean radio
broadcast, an extreme crime that
nevertheless made him realize
the problems in North Korea
were the result of its military
regime.
Like Park, Baek had to at
tempt to flee multiple times be
fore succeeding. After his second
failed attempt, he tried to commit
suicide but saved himself.
"I wanted to find that heaven
of South Korea. I believed there
would be some hope for me,"
Baek said. "The heaven I want,
it's not that special. Just to eat
very well, just be able to say
what's on my mind; that was my
heaven."
He finally managed to escape
and spent six years crossing
through China, Vietnam and Ger
many before settling in South
Korea.
Audience questions for the
panelists focused on how best to
help potential and actual defec
tors.
"You are already doing the
most important thing you can
do," Baek said. "You are listening
to my story, and you are echoing
the pain that I feel and the pain
that I am expressing. I believe
that attention, sympathy and love
if you have those ingredients,
the North Korean defectors will
survive."
