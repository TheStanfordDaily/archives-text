# Faculty lauds IntroSem delay
## SUES members see positives in delaying debate until 2016 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the Faculty Senate declined after
contentious debate to begin requiring in
troductory seminars (IntroSems) for fresh
men, as recommended by the Study of Un
dergraduate Education at Stanford
(SUES) report, both University adminis
trators and SUES members have wel
comed this revision to the report's recom
mendations.

The Faculty Senate supported an
amendment to the SUES recommenda
tions to delay considering mandating In
troSems until 2016, though other signifi
cant changes to the freshman experience
will take place this fall. Following the
SUES recommendations, the Introduction
to the Humanities (IHUM) program will
be replaced by a one-quarter Thinking
Matters course.
"The very notion of required seminars
had produced controversy among faculty

and students," said Russell Berman, direc
tor of both the IHUM and IntroSem pro
grams. Berman proposed the amendment
that will see the Senate revisit the issue of
mandatory seminars in 2016.
"Many people faculty and students
who admire the seminar program were
concerned that turning them into a re
quirement might have a deleterious im
pact," Berman added. "We really feared
that students might end up in
seminars far from their own areas
of interest."
Other faculty members
echoed Berman's sentiments.
"I think [the recommenda
tion] is a very wise decision," said
Susan McConnell, SUES com
mittee co-chair. "The idea of man
dating a seminar program if a sig
nificant fraction of the faculty
were not enthusiastic about it
seems to me a dangerous one. Al
though I do believe quite whole
heartedly that every freshman
should take a seminar, I think that
the decision to reevaluate in four
years is a very wise one."
James Campbell, SUES com
mittee co-chair, also supported
the amendment, voting in favor of
it at the Senate's March 8 meet
ing.
"The recommendation, while
it's clearly not what the SUES
committee had hoped, is broadly
in the spirit of what we recom
mended," Campbell said.
The SUES report's original
proposal required students to
take two Thinking Matters cours
es, with the option of replacing
one of these courses with an In
troSem. In 2014-15 and subse
quent years, freshmen would be
required to take one Thinking
Matters course and one In
troSem.
"Professor Berman worried
that students who did not get into
an oversubscribed seminar would
be put into a Thinking Matters
course as a second choice, having
the potential to adversely affect
their attitude towards the class,"
wrote Harry Elam, vice provost of
undergraduate education
(VPUE), in an email to The Daily.
"He, like all of us, very much
wants the new Thinking Matters
program to succeed."
Additionally, many faculty
members worried that the Uni
versity would not be able to pro
vide enough freshman seminars
in the next year to effectively sup
port a requirement while main
taining a high level of student in
terest.
"There were also concerns

about whether Stanford had the
current capacity to deliver ade
quate number of faculty-taught
seminars, particularly those that
would reflect the shape of student
demand," Campbell said. "The
demand will change fairly sub
stantially now that the IHUM re
quirement has been removed."

In the interim period, the of
fice of the VPUE and IntroSem
administrators plan to identify
and explore new ways of encour
aging greater numbers of fresh
man participation. Currently, only
50 to 60 percent of freshmen en
roll in an introductory seminar,
according to McConnell. Faculty
members would like to raise that
number to almost universal par
ticipation.
"I think there's a widespread
consensus that the seminars are
great and that everyone should
do them," Berman said. "The
question is only about what's the
mechanism by which we get to ef
fective universal participation. I
think we have the time from now
to 2016 to try and see how close
we can get to universal participa
tion on a voluntary basis."
Berman said that faculty and
administrators hope to produce
more seminars in traditionally
underrepresented areas, such as
engineering, social sciences and
the professional schools. The
scheduling of seminars will also
be shifted to accommodate more
students.
"One of the goals of SUES is
to strengthen the culture of teach
ing and learning at Stanford,"
Berman said. "That means that
the University community should

value teaching and learning more
and more. In that sense, if any
thing, the moral incentive [for a
faculty member] to participate in
the seminar program has only
grown."
Berman added, however, that
attaining universal participation
may simply be impossible.
"When all is said and done,
there may well be students who
just don't want to take seminars,"
Berman said. "I'd be eager to hear
from them why."
While the amendment re
ceived majority support in Facul
ty Senate voting, some faculty
members continue to be con
cerned with the impact of drop
ping yet another freshman re
quirement.
"The reason that I care so
much about the freshman semi
nar requirement —or at least
that opportunity is that the re
ally critical thing for students in
their freshmen year is to get to
know faculty," said Jeremy Wein
stein, professor of political sci
ence. "Increasing the number of
freshman seminars has to happen,
whether it's a requirement or
not."
"My concern is that by putting
this off for another three or four
years, we're not taking the recom
mendation from the SUES com
mittee," Weinstein continued. "I
don't want us to set ourselves up
for failure by not requiring it."
Andrea Goldsmith, professor
of electrical engineering, ex
pressed concern that leaving the
freshman year with only two re
quired courses Thinking Mat
ters and the Program in Writing
and Rhetoric (PWR) would
constitute an inadequate intro
duction to university-level educa
tion for incoming freshmen.
"I personally believe that
freshmen need some common
transformative learning experi
ences in their first year to prepare
them for the remainder of their
university education ... as well
as to create a sense of community
and shared pedagogy," Goldsmith
wrote in an email to The Daily. "I
worry that one Thinking Matters
course and one writing course is
not sufficient to accomplish this
goal."

ping yet another freshman re
quirement.
"The reason that I care so
much about the freshman semi
nar requirement —or at least
that opportunity is that the re
ally critical thing for students in
their freshmen year is to get to
know faculty," said Jeremy Wein
stein, professor of political sci
ence. "Increasing the number of
freshman seminars has to happen,
whether it's a requirement or
not."
"My concern is that by putting
this off for another three or four
years, we're not taking the recom
mendation from the SUES com
mittee," Weinstein continued. "I
don't want us to set ourselves up
for failure by not requiring it."
Andrea Goldsmith, professor
of electrical engineering, ex
pressed concern that leaving the
freshman year with only two re
quired courses Thinking Mat
ters and the Program in Writing
and Rhetoric (PWR) would
constitute an inadequate intro
duction to university-level educa
tion for incoming freshmen.
"I personally believe that
freshmen need some common
transformative learning experi
ences in their first year to prepare
them for the remainder of their
university education ... as well
as to create a sense of community
and shared pedagogy," Goldsmith
wrote in an email to The Daily. "I
worry that one Thinking Matters
course and one writing course is
not sufficient to accomplish this
goal."

JAMES CAMPBELL
SUES co-chair
While the Faculty Senate declined after
contentious debate to begin requiring in
troductory seminars (IntroSems) for fresh
men, as recommended by the Study of Un
dergraduate Education at Stanford
(SUES) report, both University adminis
trators and SUES members have wel
comed this revision to the report's recom
mendations.

The Faculty Senate supported an
amendment to the SUES recommenda
tions to delay considering mandating In
troSems until 2016, though other signifi
cant changes to the freshman experience
will take place this fall. Following the
SUES recommendations, the Introduction
to the Humanities (IHUM) program will
be replaced by a one-quarter Thinking
Matters course.
"The very notion of required seminars
had produced controversy among faculty

and students," said Russell Berman, direc
tor of both the IHUM and IntroSem pro
grams. Berman proposed the amendment
that will see the Senate revisit the issue of
mandatory seminars in 2016.
"Many people faculty and students
who admire the seminar program were
concerned that turning them into a re
quirement might have a deleterious im
pact," Berman added. "We really feared
that students might end up in
seminars far from their own areas
of interest."
Other faculty members
echoed Berman's sentiments.
"I think [the recommenda
tion] is a very wise decision," said
Susan McConnell, SUES com
mittee co-chair. "The idea of man
dating a seminar program if a sig
nificant fraction of the faculty
were not enthusiastic about it
seems to me a dangerous one. Al
though I do believe quite whole
heartedly that every freshman
should take a seminar, I think that
the decision to reevaluate in four
years is a very wise one."
James Campbell, SUES com
mittee co-chair, also supported
the amendment, voting in favor of
it at the Senate's March 8 meet
ing.
"The recommendation, while
it's clearly not what the SUES
committee had hoped, is broadly
in the spirit of what we recom
mended," Campbell said.
The SUES report's original
proposal required students to
take two Thinking Matters cours
es, with the option of replacing
one of these courses with an In
troSem. In 2014-15 and subse
quent years, freshmen would be
required to take one Thinking
Matters course and one In
troSem.
"Professor Berman worried
that students who did not get into
an oversubscribed seminar would
be put into a Thinking Matters
course as a second choice, having
the potential to adversely affect
their attitude towards the class,"
wrote Harry Elam, vice provost of
undergraduate education
(VPUE), in an email to The Daily.
"He, like all of us, very much
wants the new Thinking Matters
program to succeed."
Additionally, many faculty
members worried that the Uni
versity would not be able to pro
vide enough freshman seminars
in the next year to effectively sup
port a requirement while main
taining a high level of student in
terest.
"There were also concerns

about whether Stanford had the
current capacity to deliver ade
quate number of faculty-taught
seminars, particularly those that
would reflect the shape of student
demand," Campbell said. "The
demand will change fairly sub
stantially now that the IHUM re
quirement has been removed."

In the interim period, the of
fice of the VPUE and IntroSem
administrators plan to identify
and explore new ways of encour
aging greater numbers of fresh
man participation. Currently, only
50 to 60 percent of freshmen en
roll in an introductory seminar,
according to McConnell. Faculty
members would like to raise that
number to almost universal par
ticipation.
"I think there's a widespread
consensus that the seminars are
great and that everyone should
do them," Berman said. "The
question is only about what's the
mechanism by which we get to ef
fective universal participation. I
think we have the time from now
to 2016 to try and see how close
we can get to universal participa
tion on a voluntary basis."
Berman said that faculty and
administrators hope to produce
more seminars in traditionally
underrepresented areas, such as
engineering, social sciences and
the professional schools. The
scheduling of seminars will also
be shifted to accommodate more
students.
"One of the goals of SUES is
to strengthen the culture of teach
ing and learning at Stanford,"
Berman said. "That means that
the University community should

value teaching and learning more
and more. In that sense, if any
thing, the moral incentive [for a
faculty member] to participate in
the seminar program has only
grown."
Berman added, however, that
attaining universal participation
may simply be impossible.
"When all is said and done,
there may well be students who
just don't want to take seminars,"
Berman said. "I'd be eager to hear
from them why."
While the amendment re
ceived majority support in Facul
ty Senate voting, some faculty
members continue to be con
cerned with the impact of drop
ping yet another freshman re
quirement.
"The reason that I care so
