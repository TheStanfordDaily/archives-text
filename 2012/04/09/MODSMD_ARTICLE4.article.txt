## BSU, NAACP host panel on Trayvon Martin case 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
"The ante has been upped emotionally
for you with Trayvon Martin," said Stan
ford parent and attorney Simona Farrise
to an audience at the Black Community
Services Center (BCSC) Friday after
noon. "We have become comfortable with
police officers, under the color of the law,
killing young black men now we have
gone another step and said, 'An ordinary
person who I might see in the grocery
store, who has no training, no license, no
right nothing can just shoot some
body down and it will be okay.'"

Farrise was one of five panelists
brought together by the BCSC, Black Stu
dent Union (BSU) and Stanford NAACP
to discuss "Justice for Tray von." The event
focused on the legal and cultural ramifica
tions of George Zimmerman's February
killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed
black 17-year old, allegedly in self-de
fense.
Zimmerman has yet to be arrested or
formally charged.
Jan Barker-Alexander, associate dean
of students and BCSC director, began
moderating the event by explaining how a

student had approached her
shortly before spring break,
upset over Martin's killing and
feeling unable to discuss the case
with friends.
"We were looking at this from
research, policy, practice and pas
sion," Barker-Alexander said
about organizing a discussion
that would also allow the com
munity to reflect emotionally on
the case.
Mark Kelman, Stanford Law
School professor and vice dean,
stated that he didn't think Flori
da's "stand your ground" laws,
which allow residents to use
lethal force if they feel they are in
danger, applied to this case.
"The 'stand your ground' law
only comes into play when you
are already entitled to use deadly
force," Kelman said, asserting
that individuals must make an at
tempt to retreat before they are

entitled to use deadly force
against an alleged attacker.
"It upsets the role of law en
forcement," Farrise added, not
ing that, while California has self
defense laws, police are still al
lowed to make arrests and dis
trict attorneys are allowed to ini
tiate charges if it looks like a
crime has been committed. By
contrast, Florida law precludes
legal action.
Pamela Price, an Oakland
based civil rights attorney, then
speculated whether "stand your
ground" would have been ac
cepted had Martin and Zimmer
man's races been reversed.
"The police did not do a prop
er investigation because some
body made the decision early on
that this law was available to Mr.
Zimmerman," Price said. "Would
it have been available to
Trayvon? I seriously doubt it."
Price also asserted that Mar
tin's killing reflects larger issues
involving race.
"For some there is still very
much a perspective of white priv
ilege," she said. "'You are not a

white child, you are a black child
in a hoodie and you look suspi
cious to me, so therefore I have
the right to follow you . . . and
you have no rights from my per
spective.'"
Samy Alim M.A. 'O2 Ph.D. 'O3,
School of Education professor
and director of the Institute for
Diversity in the Arts, commented
on this presumed privilege, dis
cussing a blog post he wrote
about being viewed as suspicious
by a white couple while walking
home in his Mountain View
neighborhood.
"I was afraid of the conse
quences," Alim said. "If someone
fears me that much just walking
home, what might happen? Will
they call the police?"
Ajani Husbands 'O5 then dis
cussed "the talk" that black par
ents have with their children
particularly males about how
to act and interact outside the
home.
Husbands said his mother gave
him "the talk" a number of times,
but its meaning did not "hit home"
until Trayvon Martin's death.

"I realized that 'the talk' is not
necessarily 'study extra hard, be
extra diligent in your studies,' it's
'be extra careful because you can
and possibly will die at any mo
ment for anything.' It doesn't
matter how good you are, how
well you're dressed at any mo
ment, you can be a victim," Hus
bands said.
Martin's killing inspired Hus
bands to write "An Open Letter
to My Unborn Black Son," in
which he gave his own version of
the talk to his unborn son.
Husbands said that people
from around the world want to
see how the Constitution will be
reconciled with the reality of
what happens on the streets.
The panel concluded with
members warning students
about "the acquiescence of self,"
advising them not to be silent
about issues of race for fear of
making friends feel uncomfort
able.
"You must communicate,"
Farisse said.
An estimated 100 students
total attended some part of the

event, and a Q&A session lasted
nearly 40 minutes after the panel
concluded.

"My biggest takeaway would
be to have courage, to voice your
opinions and to not be afraid to
speak out against these injus
tices," said Milton Achelpohl 'l3,
vice president of the Stanford
NAACP. "That's the only way
that the unfortunately long list of
cases like this will be addressed,
when there's a collective conver
sation that leads to a collective
responsibility."
BSU president Anna Asare
'l4 said that it was important for
her to see the breadth of legal is
sues surrounding Zimmerman's
treatment.
Achelpohl and Asare added,
that beyond hosting "Hoodies
and Hijabs, "a rally against racial
discrimination tomorrow, the
NAACP, BSU and other student
groups will mobilize students to
call and write politicians demand
ing legal action.

with friends.
"We were looking at this from
research, policy, practice and pas
sion," Barker-Alexander said
about organizing a discussion
that would also allow the com
munity to reflect emotionally on
the case.
Mark Kelman, Stanford Law
School professor and vice dean,
stated that he didn't think Flori
da's "stand your ground" laws,
which allow residents to use
lethal force if they feel they are in
danger, applied to this case.
"The 'stand your ground' law
only comes into play when you
are already entitled to use deadly
force," Kelman said, asserting
that individuals must make an at
tempt to retreat before they are

entitled to use deadly force
against an alleged attacker.
"It upsets the role of law en
forcement," Farrise added, not
ing that, while California has self
defense laws, police are still al
lowed to make arrests and dis
trict attorneys are allowed to ini
tiate charges if it looks like a
crime has been committed. By
contrast, Florida law precludes
legal action.
Pamela Price, an Oakland
based civil rights attorney, then
speculated whether "stand your
ground" would have been ac
cepted had Martin and Zimmer
man's races been reversed.
"The police did not do a prop
er investigation because some
body made the decision early on
that this law was available to Mr.
Zimmerman," Price said. "Would
it have been available to
Trayvon? I seriously doubt it."
Price also asserted that Mar
tin's killing reflects larger issues
involving race.
"For some there is still very
much a perspective of white priv
ilege," she said. "'You are not a

white child, you are a black child
in a hoodie and you look suspi
cious to me, so therefore I have
the right to follow you . . . and
you have no rights from my per
spective.'"
Samy Alim M.A. 'O2 Ph.D. 'O3,
School of Education professor
and director of the Institute for
Diversity in the Arts, commented
on this presumed privilege, dis
cussing a blog post he wrote
about being viewed as suspicious
by a white couple while walking
home in his Mountain View
neighborhood.
"I was afraid of the conse
quences," Alim said. "If someone
fears me that much just walking
home, what might happen? Will
they call the police?"
Ajani Husbands 'O5 then dis
cussed "the talk" that black par
ents have with their children
particularly males about how
to act and interact outside the
home.
Husbands said his mother gave
him "the talk" a number of times,
but its meaning did not "hit home"
until Trayvon Martin's death.

"I realized that 'the talk' is not
necessarily 'study extra hard, be
extra diligent in your studies,' it's
'be extra careful because you can
and possibly will die at any mo
ment for anything.' It doesn't
matter how good you are, how
well you're dressed at any mo
ment, you can be a victim," Hus
bands said.
Martin's killing inspired Hus
bands to write "An Open Letter
to My Unborn Black Son," in
which he gave his own version of
the talk to his unborn son.
Husbands said that people
from around the world want to
see how the Constitution will be
reconciled with the reality of
what happens on the streets.
The panel concluded with
members warning students
about "the acquiescence of self,"
advising them not to be silent
about issues of race for fear of
making friends feel uncomfort
able.
"You must communicate,"
Farisse said.
An estimated 100 students
total attended some part of the

event, and a Q&A session lasted
nearly 40 minutes after the panel
concluded.

"My biggest takeaway would
be to have courage, to voice your
opinions and to not be afraid to
speak out against these injus
tices," said Milton Achelpohl 'l3,
vice president of the Stanford
NAACP. "That's the only way
that the unfortunately long list of
cases like this will be addressed,
when there's a collective conver
sation that leads to a collective
responsibility."
BSU president Anna Asare
'l4 said that it was important for
her to see the breadth of legal is
sues surrounding Zimmerman's
treatment.
Achelpohl and Asare added,
that beyond hosting "Hoodies
and Hijabs, "a rally against racial
discrimination tomorrow, the
NAACP, BSU and other student
groups will mobilize students to
call and write politicians demand
ing legal action.

"The ante has been upped emotionally
for you with Trayvon Martin," said Stan
ford parent and attorney Simona Farrise
to an audience at the Black Community
Services Center (BCSC) Friday after
noon. "We have become comfortable with
police officers, under the color of the law,
killing young black men now we have
gone another step and said, 'An ordinary
person who I might see in the grocery
store, who has no training, no license, no
right nothing can just shoot some
body down and it will be okay.'"

Farrise was one of five panelists
brought together by the BCSC, Black Stu
dent Union (BSU) and Stanford NAACP
to discuss "Justice for Tray von." The event
focused on the legal and cultural ramifica

killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed
black 17-year old, allegedly in self-de
fense.
Zimmerman has yet to be arrested or
formally charged.
Jan Barker-Alexander, associate dean
of students and BCSC director, began
