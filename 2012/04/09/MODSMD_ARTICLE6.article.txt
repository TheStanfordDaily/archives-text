## Admit Wknd Team expects more RoHos RoHo numbers lag behind target, but remain above 2011 levels 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
With less than three weeks until
Admit Weekend, approximately 500 ad
ditional room hosts (RoHos) may be
needed to accommodate visiting
prospective freshmen (ProFros). While
only 976 RoHos had registered for the
event as of Friday, the Admit Weekend
Team expressed optimism about reach
ing its target.
"The number of registered RoHos we
have isn't too far off our spring break
total goal of 1,000," said Matt Lopez 'l4,
an Admit Weekend coordinator. "We ex
pect that in the coming weeks, this num
ber will grow to the 1,400 to 1,500 that
we're looking for."
Lopez said that initially lagging regis
tration has been a consistent trend in re
cent years, with lower numbers of
RoHos signing up in advance of spring
break before a registration surge closer
to Admit Weekend.
"All Stanford students are so busy
with their own work. We open the appli
cation in February and early March and,
since Admit Weekend is not until April,
students think, 'I can put that off,"'
Lopez said. "After spring break, when
Admit Weekend is in three or four
weeks, students start thinking, 'lt's about
time I signed up.'"
Lopez emphasized the Admit Week
end Team's recent efforts to advertise
the weekend and increase the number of
registered RoHos by putting flyers in
White Plaza and providing information
to house hosts (HoHos) to distribute to
their dorms.
"Not meeting our goal isn't
something we've talked about,"
Lopez said, regarding whether
the team is creating a contingency
plan in case RoHo registration is
inadequate.
Lopez noted that, at a similar
time last year, the 2011 Admit
Weekend team had only about
900 RoHos registered but was
still able to meet its final goal.
"Last year, towards the end,
they thought they were going to
come up short, and they figured
something out to get more
RoHos," Lopez said. "One coor
dinator on our team this year was
also a coordinator last year, so he
is pretty knowledgeable about
what to do if we get to that point."
In sharp contrast to any
prospective shortage of RoHos,
Lopez noted that HoHo applica
tions exceeded the number of
available positions as early as

February this year.
"I wanted to be a FIoFIo be
cause my Admit Weekend experi
ence was good but not great, and
I want to make it really awesome
for this year's ProFros," said Will
Setrakian 'l5, a Larkin HoHo.
"I didn't get to come to my
Admit Weekend, so I want to live
vicariously through my Pro Fro,"
said Kelsey Lange 'l5, a RoHo.
In past years, Admit Weekend
has had roughly equal numbers of
ProFros and RoHos register.
"It's not worth it to give that
number [of registered ProFros] be
cause it can jump by 100 a day,"
Lopez said. "We've just started to
connect with ProFros more, asking
them to come to Admit Weekend."
"I don't think the number of
ProFros is going to vary that
much from previous years,"
Lopez added. "We expect about
the same numbers to come into
Stanford, and we don't think
there are any big discrepancies in
admitted students."
