## Admit Wknd Team expects more RoHos RoHo numbers lag behind target, but remain above 2011 levels 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
With less than three weeks until
Admit Weekend, approximately 500 ad
ditional room hosts (RoHos) may be
needed to accommodate visiting
prospective freshmen (ProFros). While
only 976 RoHos had registered for the
event as of Friday, the Admit Weekend
Team expressed optimism about reach
ing its target.
"The number of registered RoHos we
have isn't too far off our spring break
total goal of 1,000," said Matt Lopez 'l4,
an Admit Weekend coordinator. "We ex
pect that in the coming weeks, this num
ber will grow to the 1,400 to 1,500 that
we're looking for."
Lopez said that initially lagging regis
tration has been a consistent trend in re
cent years, with lower numbers of
RoHos signing up in advance of spring
break before a registration surge closer
to Admit Weekend.
"All Stanford students are so busy
with their own work. We open the appli
cation in February and early March and,
since Admit Weekend is not until April,
students think, 'I can put that off,"'
Lopez said. "After spring break, when
Admit Weekend is in three or four
weeks, students start thinking, 'lt's about
time I signed up.'"
Lopez emphasized the Admit Week
end Team's recent efforts to advertise
the weekend and increase the number of
registered RoHos by putting flyers in
White Plaza and providing information
to house hosts (HoHos) to distribute to
their dorms.
