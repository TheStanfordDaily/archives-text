# Stanford engineers create piezoelectric graphene

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marshall Watkins 
For the first time, Stanford en
gineers have engineered graphene
to produce an electrical charge
when bent, squeezed or twisted.
The advance the first example

of piezoelectricity in a nanoscale
material has the potential to be
applied across a range of indus
tries and offer developers a dra
matically expanded degree of con
trol in nanotechnology.
By depositing atoms on one
side of a grid of graphene which
has been called a 'wonder materi
al' for its conductivity, thinness
and strength engineers were
able to disrupt the grid's perfect
physical symmetry, which other
wise counters the piezoelectric ef
fect. By selectively placing atoms,
researchers were further able to
control how graphene responds to
electrical fields.
Piezoelectricity is also re
versible, offering engineers a
greater degree of control over the
modified graphene. Just as distort
ing piezoelectric materials gener
ates electricity, applying an electric
field to piezoelectric materials
causes those materials to change
shapes.
Researchers anticipate future
applications for the technique in
nanomaterials ranging in use from
electronics and photonics to
chemical sensing and high-fre
quency acoustics.
"Piezoelectric graphene could
provide an unparalleled degree of
electrical, optical or mechanical
control for applications ranging
from touchscreens to nanoscale
transistors," said Mitchell Ong, a
first author of the research paper,
to the Stanford Report.
