## SHARE connects low-income students with mentors 
### NITHYA VIJAYAKUMAR 
Launched at the beginning of the month,
the SHadow Alums in the REal World
(SHARE) pilot program aims to increase ex
ploration of career options for first-genera
tion college students by taking them into the
workplaces of Stanford alumni.
The program is the result of a partnership
between the First-Generation Low Income
Partnership (FLIP), the Career Develop
ment Center (CDC), Stanford Alumni Men
toring (SAM) and the ePortfolio project.
Applications to the program to the pro
gram closed April 1, and selected students
participated in an orientation last Tuesday in
Old Union. While the program encouraged
all interested Stanford students to apply, it
placed priority on those who identify as first
generation or low-income.
"SHARE is ideal for a range of interests:

from those who don't know what they want
and would like to explore to those who do
know what they want and have specific ques
tions," said Sonoo Thadaney, a leader for
SHARE at the Diversity and First Genera
tion Office.
Each alumnus mentor hosts a small group
of two to four undergraduates, with the goal
of giving students the opportunity to experi
ence the workplace, ask questions and begin
networking.
Stanford called upon alumni who identi
fied as first-generation, low-income or sup
porters to host students. According to
Thadaney, many alumni said they appreciat
ed the support they received at Stanford as
first-generation or low-income students and
were eager to pass the baton forward through
the SHARE program.
"[Alumni] commented that what may
seem commonplace to most Stanford stu

dents certainly was not to them as first-gen,"
Thadaney said. "And thus they were happy to
see the University's focus on the needs of this
student community."
While alumni from many companies of
fered to host students, the SHARE program
has decided to stay small for the pilot year.
Companies hosting students include Intuit;
Bailard; VMware, Inc.; Tarana Wireless;
Farella Braun+Martel LLP; and the KIPP
Foundation.
Each new student member of the program
creates an ePortfolio, an online platform for
each student to document academic work
such as papers, projects and audio files of pre
sentations. The Office of the Registrar has
spearheaded the ePortfolio pilot program
throughout campus to explore how online
learning portfolios can be used in the future.
"Unlike Facebook, which represents a stu
dent's social identity, the Stanford ePortfolio

is intended to help students document vari
ous aspects of their intellectual identity as a
learner," Thadaney said. The ePortfolio also
serves as a means of introducing students in
SHARE to alumni mentors and helping them
build a professional network.
According to Thadaney, the ePortfolios
will provide a valuable source of feedback
about SHARE, since it encourages alumni
and students to reflect on their experiences.
She said the qualitative data from these re
flections, combined with staff opinions and
ideas, will be used to improve and further de
velop SHARE.
Student and alumni participation in
SHARE have been finalized for the month of
April, but there are still a few spots available,
Thadaney added.
