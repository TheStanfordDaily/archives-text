## THE 						LURE OF WALL STREET Students discuss pursuing Wall Street careers in context of nationwide debate 
### NEHAN CHATOOR 
As Stanford students franti
cally try to secure summer
internships and jobs upon
graduation, the popularity
and presence of prominent
Wall Street firms such as Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley has led to a
University- and nation-wide debate
concerning the recruiting presence of
these firms on campus.
"There are three things that draw
students into finance: money, proce
dures and prestige," said Sanjay Saraf
'l2, a pre-med student.
Teryn Norris 'l2 and Eli Pollak 'l2
brought the debate to Stanford when
they penned an Oct. 2011 op-ed in The
Daily titled, "Stop the Wall Street Re
cruitment," in which they claimed that
over 15 percent of Stanford graduates
continue to join Wall Street firms annu
ally. The op-ed inspired the launch of the
Stop the Brain Drain campaign, which
aims to promote the public service in
dustry as an alternative to finance.
Director of the Career Develop
ment Center (CDC) Lance Choy con
tested the 15 percent figure. According
to him, only approximately 30 percent
of the student body responds to the
CDC career surveys from which Norris
and Pollak extrapolated their informa
tion.
Pollak, however, argued that a 30
percent response rate "should be more
than sufficient to yield a statistically sig
nificant sample."
Norris expressed opposition toward
the "magnitude of influence finance in
dustries exercised over the U.S higher
education system," and particularly on
recruitment advantages.
Choy, however, stated that the num

ber of technical firms far outweighs that
of finance firms at career fairs, citing that
Google is by far the largest employer of
Stanford students and has been for a
number of years. He also stated that 160
firms participated in campus Cardinal
Recruiting, out of which only 23 percent
were finance firms.
While to most students Wall Street
and money are closely tied, Norris said
he does not believe money is the key

reason Wall Street jobs appeal to stu
dents.
"Money is not primarily the issue,"
Norris said. "It is really more about what
is promoted by the CDC and the recruit
ment process. A part of it is cultural and
what people call a good career."
Many students also believe that a
Wall Street job can provide them with
valuable skills and tools for future en
deavors in other fields.
"Few students going the investment
banking or consulting route plan to
build a career in these fields," said
Shahryar Malik 'l2, who plans to pur
sue a consulting career himself.
"Rather they see their first two years
out of college as away to learn practical
skills and a professional work ethic they

can apply to business more broadly," he
added. "It allows them to get a cross
sectional view of many different indus
tries."
Bloomberg View columnist Ezra
Klein argued in a Feb. 2012 column that
this promise to "give graduates the
skills their [liberal arts] university edu
cation didn't" is a structural problem of
U.S. higher education titled "Harvard's
liberal arts failure is Wall Street's gain."

"There is uncertainty about what one
will do after graduation," Norris said.
"Due to the weakness of alternative ca
reer tracks, which are not as clear, and
[the fact that they] do not have as much
skill-based training, students end up opt
ing for a finance job."
Emma Pierson 'l3, president of the
Stanford Debate Society, noted that a
large portion of her fellow debaters
tend to opt for a finance job.
"You can definitely do good for the
world through finance and consulting,
but more so through other paths," she
said. "I have met some of the smartest
people in debates, and they could do so
much more good for the world by going
into something like research."
Saraf echoed this point.

"I am not saying that finance is bad,
but if you make a start-up that helps out
even a hundred people, I think that will
make more of a global impact than
working in investment banking or con
sulting," she said.
Students who choose finance as a ca
reer path disagree. Otis Reid 'l2, presi
dent of Stanford In Government (SIG),
plans to work for consulting firm McK
insey & Company.
When asked what he would say to
people who believe consulting careers
don't contribute to social good, he
asked, "What else would these people
want me to do?"
Other students say they feel that the
entire issue is not as problematic as pre
sented, arguing that Stanford graduates
are less inclined toward Wall Street
than their East Coat counterparts. Ac
cording to The New York Times, 14 per
cent of Yale graduates, 17 percent of
Harvard graduates and 35.9 percent of
Princeton graduates pursue finance ca
reers.
"At Stanford, students hoping to
pursue such careers are among a minor
ity," Saraf said. "In some sense, I think
the Occupy Movement has taken Wall
Street recruiting at Stanford out of pro
portion."
And for some, a career is finance is
no less legitimate than any other.
"I believe that if you are really inter
ested in entrepreneurship or tech, go do
it. If you are really interested in going di
rectly into government or nonprofit, go
do it," Reid said. "If you are interested in
finance ... it will be hard for me to ...
say 'I know you are interested in finance,
but you should go and work in a non
profit.'"
