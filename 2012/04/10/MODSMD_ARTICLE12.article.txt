## The 						campaign: Stranger times in ASSU history 
### â€“ Natasha Weaser 
In the spirit of the upcoming ASSU
elections on April 12 and 13, The
Daily took a look back on some of
the more humorous ASSU Execu
tive slates and one ASSU Sen
ate proposal of the past. Although
the Stanford Chaparral has traditionally
run a "joke" slate in elections, we assure
you that these slates except for one
were no joke.
ASSU presidential slate for 1971-72
On April 13,1971, The Daily reported
on a slate that proposed to eliminate the
ASSU entirely.
"The ticket of Chris Hocker '73 and
Robin Friedman '73 have campaigned
on a platform of dismantling the ASSU
and ending its influence on student or
ganizations. They support a program fee
of so,"The Daily reported.
"This is an unusually important elec
tion. It has come to rest on whether the
ASSU should continue to exist. [A fee of
$0 will] emasculate or destroy a lot of im
portant campus organizations," said
Larry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO,
current director of the Center for
Democracy, Development and The Rule
of Law (CDDRL), then a Stanford soph
omore and member of the competing
slate.
Diamond's slate won the election.

ASSU presidential slate for 1985-86
On April 10,1985, The Daily's ASSU
Elections handbook, where platforms
and budget requests were published be
fore the Internet, published presidential
slate Hammer and Coffin's official
statement. H & C, made up of Andrew
Frisch 'B7, Michael Collins 'B6, Leslie
Leland 'B6 M.S. 'B6 and Tim Quirk 'B6,
was the Chaparral "joke" slate that year.
"Fuck the Associated Students of
Stanford University. Something is wrong
when we really mean that. The time has
come to change, even to replace, this
government that once at least pretended
to serve the student interest. No longer.
Even that pretense is a thing of the past,"
the statement read.
The slate went on to call for the elim
ination of the ASSU Senate.
"We say that we would like to dis
band the student senate and it's true. It's
the least we could do. Disband the
ASSU. Now. Before every student or
ganization on campus is destroyed or
disenfranchised."
The Daily Editorial Board endorsed
the slate one day later, deciding to take
H & C seriously. The slate won, and on
April 19, stated plans to "individually
meet with all the senators, and try to
find out exactly what kind of beer they
like."

ASSU Executive slate for 2002-03
On April 11,2002, The Daily covered
the slate of Kellea Miller 'O4 and
Malavika Monahan 'O4 who ran an un
conventional campaign by refusing to
distribute flyers or express a concrete
message.
"Monahan and Miller and the rest of
the group said they merely wish to get
students to examine themselves and
their world instead of the campus during
the time of the ASSU elections," The
Daily reported.
"Someone asked me when the elec
tion was, and I was like, 'Uh ...Mona
han said, laughing.
"To elect people based on how
much paper they can spend is a little
disheartening to me," Miller said,
adding that she had approached candi
dates about using recycled paper for
the traditional White Plaza-flyering
mayhem.
"Tradition to kill trees!" she said.
The slate, although sincere, did not
win.

An absurd Senate proposal
On April 6,1994, The Daily reported
on a proposed bill Constitutional
Amendment: Senate Bill XXIV-A&R
-20 to require ASSU senators to don
uniforms on the days Minion Condensed
of Senate meetings.
"ASSU senators could be walking
around campus clad in official 'uniforms'
next year if students approve an amend
ment placed on the spring general elec
tion ballot last night by the ASSU Sen
ate," The Daily reported.
"The official Senate uniform will con
sist of 'an oatmeal-colored' sweatshirt
that reads on the front, 'What is an
ASSU senator?' and on the back,'l'm an
ASSU senator, silly!' The sweatshirt will
also display the time and location of
meetings as set by the Senate at the be
ginning of the year."
The Daily Editorial Board supported
the amendment as a means of improving
"the accountability and visibility of
ASSU senators."The amendment passed.

ination of the ASSU Senate.
"We say that we would like to dis
band the student senate and it's true. It's
the least we could do. Disband the
ASSU. Now. Before every student or
ganization on campus is destroyed or
disenfranchised."
The Daily Editorial Board endorsed
the slate one day later, deciding to take
H & C seriously. The slate won, and on
April 19, stated plans to "individually
meet with all the senators, and try to
find out exactly what kind of beer they
like."

ASSU Executive slate for 2002-03
On April 11,2002, The Daily covered
the slate of Kellea Miller 'O4 and
Malavika Monahan 'O4 who ran an un
conventional campaign by refusing to
distribute flyers or express a concrete
message.
"Monahan and Miller and the rest of
the group said they merely wish to get
students to examine themselves and
their world instead of the campus during
the time of the ASSU elections," The
Daily reported.
"Someone asked me when the elec
tion was, and I was like, 'Uh ...Mona
han said, laughing.
"To elect people based on how
much paper they can spend is a little
disheartening to me," Miller said,
adding that she had approached candi
dates about using recycled paper for
the traditional White Plaza-flyering
mayhem.
"Tradition to kill trees!" she said.
The slate, although sincere, did not
win.

An absurd Senate proposal
On April 6,1994, The Daily reported
on a proposed bill Constitutional
Amendment: Senate Bill XXIV-A&R
-20 to require ASSU senators to don
uniforms on the days Minion Condensed
of Senate meetings.
"ASSU senators could be walking
around campus clad in official 'uniforms'
next year if students approve an amend
ment placed on the spring general elec
tion ballot last night by the ASSU Sen
ate," The Daily reported.
"The official Senate uniform will con
sist of 'an oatmeal-colored' sweatshirt
that reads on the front, 'What is an
ASSU senator?' and on the back,'l'm an
ASSU senator, silly!' The sweatshirt will
also display the time and location of
meetings as set by the Senate at the be
ginning of the year."
The Daily Editorial Board supported
the amendment as a means of improving
"the accountability and visibility of
ASSU senators."The amendment passed.

In the spirit of the upcoming ASSU
elections on April 12 and 13, The
Daily took a look back on some of
the more humorous ASSU Execu
tive slates and one ASSU Sen
ate proposal of the past. Although
the Stanford Chaparral has traditionally
run a "joke" slate in elections, we assure
you that these slates except for one
were no joke.
ASSU presidential slate for 1971-72
On April 13,1971, The Daily reported
on a slate that proposed to eliminate the
ASSU entirely.
"The ticket of Chris Hocker '73 and
Robin Friedman '73 have campaigned
on a platform of dismantling the ASSU
and ending its influence on student or
ganizations. They support a program fee
of so,"The Daily reported.
"This is an unusually important elec
tion. It has come to rest on whether the
ASSU should continue to exist. [A fee of
$0 will] emasculate or destroy a lot of im
portant campus organizations," said
Larry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO,
current director of the Center for
Democracy, Development and The Rule
of Law (CDDRL), then a Stanford soph
omore and member of the competing
slate.
Diamond's slate won the election.

and budget requests were published be
fore the Internet, published presidential
slate Hammer and Coffin's official
statement. H & C, made up of Andrew
Frisch 'B7, Michael Collins 'B6, Leslie
Leland 'B6 M.S. 'B6 and Tim Quirk 'B6,
was the Chaparral "joke" slate that year.
"Fuck the Associated Students of
Stanford University. Something is wrong
when we really mean that. The time has
come to change, even to replace, this
government that once at least pretended
to serve the student interest. No longer.
Even that pretense is a thing of the past,"
the statement read.
The slate went on to call for the elim
ination of the ASSU Senate.
"We say that we would like to dis
band the student senate and it's true. It's
the least we could do. Disband the
ASSU. Now. Before every student or
