## FROM FARM TO FORK Let's get political 
### Jenny Rempel 
Coming in at more than 600
pages, the federal farm bill
is an elaborate and convo
luted piece of legislation that lays
out most federal food and farm
policies. Members of Congress
renegotiate this bill every five
years, and it governs everything
from farm subsidies to biofuels to
international food aid. The Food,
Conservation and Energy Act of
2008, our most recent farm bill, is
in effect through September,
meaning Congress is currently
working to broker a new farm bill.
Current estimates suggest we
have spent more than $4OO billion
on farm bill programs over the
past five years. That is a lot of fed
eral funding, and a slash-happy
Republican House noticed.
Congressman Paul Ryan's
"Path to Prosperity" FY2013
budget proposes removing over
$lBO billion from farm bill pro
grams over the next 10 years, in
cluding a $134 billion cut to the
federal nutrition program former
ly known as food stamps. By tar
geting nutrition assistance for
cuts, Ryan and the 228 Republi
can representatives who voted for
his plan told the nation that we
should let millions of Americans
go hungry to balance the budget.
Before automatically criticiz
ing these budget-cutting efforts, it
is important to review what the
farm bill actually funds. The Con
gressional Budget Office esti
mates that nine percent of farm
bill spending goes to conservation
programs, 10 percent goes to crop
insurance and 12 percent goes to
commodity crop subsidies for
corn, cotton, rice, wheat and soy
beans. Almost 70 percent of 2008-
2017 funding is allocated for nu
trition assistance, largely through
the Supplemental Nutrition As
sistance Program (SNAP), which
succeeded food stamps.
Considering that the majority
of farm bill spending now goes to
nutrition assistance, perhaps we
should rebrand this piece of legis
lation as the food and farm bill, or
even just the food bill. This would
better align the bill's title with its
current funding goals. And it
would send an important message
to legislators and voters: The bill is
not meant to be an archaic, con
fusing piece of legislation that
benefits only a small subset of
farmers and perpetuates an unjust
food system. In some ways, budg
et cuts and rebranding may be just
what we need to realign federal
funding with Americans' growing
desire to increase access to
healthy, sustainably grown food.
Currently, farmers receive com
modity crop subsidies whether
they produce a crop or not. We
spend eight times more farm bill
funding on commodity crops than
we do on fruits, nuts and vegeta
bles, but the economic returns on
commodity crops are only twice
those of these other "specialty
crops," giving our current subsidy
system a relatively poor return on
investment. Commodity crop sub
sidies are relics of early efforts to
avoid violations of international
trade laws, and these commodity
payments, which were intended to
phase out decades ago, currently
benefit a very small portion of
farmers. In fact, 62 percent of U.S.
farms do not collect any subsidy
payments, and in California, less
than 10 percent of farms receive
government subsidies.

Given the current budget-cut
ting climate in Washington, reduc
ing commodity crop subsidies
may finally be politically feasible.
This is an opportunity to strategi
cally restructure the food and
farm bill, but we must be careful
to ensure that cuts do not expand
to include crucial farm bill fund
ing for conservation and nutrition
assistance programs.
Congress could go beyond
budget cuts and encourage more
sustainable food systems by en
dorsing the Local Farms, Food and
Jobs bill introduced by Sen. Sher
rod Brown (D-Ohio) and Rep.
Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), an or
ganic farmer. Among many useful
reforms, the Pingree-Brown bill
would increase funding for local
processing and distribution cen
ters, promote the incorporation of
local produce into school lunches,
facilitate fruit and vegetable access
for food stamp recipients and sen
iors and increase funding for spe
cialty crops, organic producers, di
versified operations, small-scale
farms and beginning farmers. The
projected price tag is $lOO million
per year, which is less than 0.2 per
cent of average annual spending on
the last farm bill. When coupled
with reductions to commodity crop
subsidies, this could represent an
important opportunity to help re
shape agriculture policy and scale
up local and regional food systems.
Too often, sustainable food ac
tivists are content with buying
local and choosing organic. These
actions, though laudable, are not
enough. Many activists bemoan
subsidies in blog posts and casual
conversations, but these forms of
activism rarely make it to policy
makers' ears. It is time for us to get
political. Join me in calling your
Congressional representatives
and telling them your taxpayer
dollars should be spent creating
more sustainable and accessible
food systems. The message I
shared with Rep. Anna Eshoo (D
-CA), who represents the Stanford
community, was simple: no cuts
for nutrition programs, no cuts for
conservation programs and sup
port for the Local Farms, Food
and Jobs bill. I hope you'll join me
and send a strong message to
Washington, because voting with
our forks is not enough to change
our food systems.
