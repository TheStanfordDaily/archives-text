# HALF-INVENTED
## Think with your heart 
### Chase Ishii 
I never wanted to go to Stanford
for college. I never wanted to
go anywhere in particular. Of
course I wanted to go to college,
but I never had my heart set on a
specific college. This, however,
was not the case for the girl sitting
next to me in the outfield bleach
er seats at the Coliseum in Oak
land nearly two years ago. She had
finished spring quarter finals
early, so we decided to catch the
Angels vs. A's game to celebrate. I
had a final the next day, but it was
an IHUM final, so I accepted the
inevitable "B" and drove up to
Oakland.
Stanford University was her
lifelong dream. It was where her
parents met. It was her motivation
to ace tests and join clubs in high
school. It was the only future she'd
ever imagined. And it was the
cause of great despair and even
greater joy as she endured the
long, torturous months between
having been waitlisted and even
tually accepted. She was glowing
just talking about it. But the glow
eventually wore off as I began to

share the completely under
whelming story of how I only ap
plied to Stanford because my
mom wanted to see if I could get
in, and how, before applying to
any colleges, I had decided to go
wherever I got the most financial
aid. Thankfully, Stanford is very
generous with their money.
In one of my classes, we dis
cussed how it is a very common
tendency, especially at this school,
to analyze situations rather than
react emotionally because we feel
more comfortable on intellectual
grounds. This became evident as a
conversation intentionally geared
toward emotional reactions to a
recent, tragic event morphed into
an intellectual discussion on de
pression, complete with statistics
and psychological theories. I've
often been teased and labeled as
an "Emo Kid" (because I listen to
awesome music), but I still direct
problems to my intellect rather
than my emotion because emo
tions are scary. It is safer to think
than to feel.
Objectivity keeps us distant
and removed, an arm's length
from situations and possible fail
ure. It cleanses us of responsibility
by placing decisions purely into
the hands of cold reason and logic.
By choosing my college based on
numbers, I didn't bear the respon
sibility of choosing "wrong," and
by keeping the gravity of the situ
ation away from my desires, I in
sulated myself from the pain of
possible rejection. However, re
moving myself from the emotion
al experience consequentially
meant removing myself from ex
periencing the full joy of being ac
cepted.
This intellectual default also
allows us to maintain the image of
being composed, mature adults. (I
promised myself I wouldn't use
the Duck Syndrome here because
everyone uses the duck
metaphor.) It restrains our ex
pression of emotion to only what
is justified and considered ration
al and acceptable. But emotions
are hardly ever rational, and we
end up disguising how we really
feel and consequently who we
really are for the sake of look
ing composed. Part of the appeal
of "getting wasted" is the freedom
to reveal these dangerously vul
nerable feelings and emotions
through the newly provided justi
fication of "just being a little
tipsy." It's as if we need the excuse
of not being our normal selves in

order to be our real selves.
I'm not suggesting we com
pletely throw out rationality and
intellect and become slaves to our
impulses and emotions. I'm mere
ly giving the postmodern nudge to
the significance of emotion by
stating that there are limitations
to rationality and intellect, and
that living purely in your head is
not living at all. Analytical judg
ments allow you to calculate risks,
but it doesn't necessarily help you
take those risks. Jim Adkins of
Jimmy Eat World (an awesome
emo band) writes, "You'll sit alone
forever if you wait for the right
time. What are you hoping for?"
There's hardly ever that perfect
moment when chasing your
dreams and desires is also the
most sensible and rational choice.
Yet, even as the head shakes side
to-side, the heart continues to
beat feverishly.
Dustin Kensrue of Thrice (not
an emo band, but an awesome
band nonetheless) wrote in the
liner notes of a record, "Nothing
worth loving is safe to love."
Great rewards are preceded by
great risks, leaps of faith over
chasms far too vast and unpre
dictable for logic and sensibility to
dare tread. While both intellect
and emotion have limitations,
they compliment each other in
their weaknesses. By denying ei
ther when considering our ac
tions, convictions and overall
worldview, we are denying our
selves.

If your head kept saying "No!" but
your heart (or body) kept saying
"Yes!" while reading this, let Chase

It's as if we need
the excuse of not
being our normal
selves in order to
be our real selves.
