## The 						baseball bubble 
### Tom Taylor 
Joseph Stalin once famously
declared, "One death is a
tragedy; one million is a sta
tistic." Perhaps he wasn't
just talking about people.
The bigger a number becomes,
the less personal it feels, and when it
becomes truly enormous, it is some
times hard for us to even attempt to
comprehend it. Suddenly it's just a
cold statistic that we journalists can
use to pad out a story, but which re
ally doesn't add much meaning.
When you pay an average of
$26.92 to get into a ballpark, and,
once inside, get fleeced for around
$5 just to buy a bottle of water let
alone a luxury item like a hot dog or
even a beer it hurts. Maybe the
beer can take some of that pain
away, but knowing that your team,
in your house, is clearly taking ad
vantage of your support and your
wallet isn't a nice feeling. Sure,
you're grown up now, and you can't
crash at Mom and Dad's without
contributing something toward the
bills, but you don't quite expect
them to be taking you for a ride.
But when you see someone just
walk in and throw $2 billion on the
table to purchase an MLB franchise,
as just happened with the Los Ange
les Dodgers, it just doesn't seem to
register the same way.
First, let's get this straight: $2 bil
lion is not "a lot of money." It's far
more than that. It's an incompre
hensible amount of money. Try and
think of it this way: If it turned out
the price tag was actually $2.01 bil
lion, would you be significantly
more impressed? No. But that is an
extra $lO million, a quantity on its
own that few of us, even Stanford
graduates, will get to see in our life
times.
And what could $2 billion buy
you? A struggling baseball team,
obviously, but also around eight mil
lion tons of ballpark hot dogs, 1.6
million barrels of ballpark beer or
an entire stadium's worth of MLB
tickets for 10 consecutive seasons.
The biggest question, though,
about this quantity of money is
whether it is really worth it. What is
the Guggenheim Baseball Manage
ment group really getting for the
price tag?
Bought by Frank McCourt in
2004 for $355 million, the Dodgers
were valued at $727 million by
Forbes in 2010, less than half of the
aforementioned purchase. Remem
ber, too, that we are talking about a
team struggling with bankruptcy
the existing debt is greater than the
price paid in 2004 and without a
World Series appearance for more
than 20 years. If the Dodgers are
worth this much, what would a team
like the Yankees cost?
And can the new owners really
make this investment pay off? Tele
vision rights and real estate devel
opment may go a long way toward
that goal, but the physical price of
the franchise must at least remain at
the same level to make this work.
Arguably the biggest soccer club
in the United Kingdom, Manches
ter United was bought for nearly
$1.5 billion by the Glazer family in
2005. Even that was a significantly
smaller sum than we are talking
about right now, for a team and a
sport that have far greater global ap
peal than the Dodgers or baseball.
And has it worked? Although the
team looks certain to win the Pre
mier League yet again this year, it is
now saddled with around the $1 bil
lion in debt.
Right now we are still trying to
pull ourselves out of a deep hole cre
ated in part by the hyperinflation of
house prices. Has baseball not been
paying attention?
I honestly don't understand how
this valuation can be correct, or in
fact good, for either the sport or the
fans. This $2 billion isn't going to
provide new facilities, train new
players or even make the game-day
experience more enjoyable or af
fordable, There is, really, just one
small group that benefits: the other
29 MLB franchise owners. If the
going rate of a team keeps rising,
then they can feel certain that, win
or lose, invest in the team or not,
their perceived assets will continue
to grow.
At least, that is, until the music fi
nally stops. When the baseball bub
ble bursts, someone is set to lose an
inconceivable amount of money.

Please note that Tom Taylor never
said that Man U's debt made him
upset. Ask him how he really feels
about soccer's most popular squad
at tom.taylor@stanford.edu.

I honestly don't understand how
this valuation can be correct, or in
fact good, for either the sport or the
fans. This $2 billion isn't going to
provide new facilities, train new
players or even make the game-day
experience more enjoyable or af
fordable, There is, really, just one
small group that benefits: the other
29 MLB franchise owners. If the
going rate of a team keeps rising,
then they can feel certain that, win
or lose, invest in the team or not,
their perceived assets will continue
to grow.
At least, that is, until the music fi
nally stops. When the baseball bub
ble bursts, someone is set to lose an
inconceivable amount of money.

Joseph Stalin once famously
declared, "One death is a
tragedy; one million is a sta
tistic." Perhaps he wasn't
just talking about people.
The bigger a number becomes,
the less personal it feels, and when it
becomes truly enormous, it is some
times hard for us to even attempt to
comprehend it. Suddenly it's just a
cold statistic that we journalists can
use to pad out a story, but which re
ally doesn't add much meaning.
When you pay an average of
$26.92 to get into a ballpark, and,
once inside, get fleeced for around
$5 just to buy a bottle of water let
alone a luxury item like a hot dog or
even a beer it hurts. Maybe the
beer can take some of that pain
away, but knowing that your team,
in your house, is clearly taking ad
vantage of your support and your
wallet isn't a nice feeling. Sure,
you're grown up now, and you can't
crash at Mom and Dad's without
contributing something toward the
bills, but you don't quite expect
them to be taking you for a ride.
But when you see someone just
walk in and throw $2 billion on the
table to purchase an MLB franchise,
as just happened with the Los Ange
les Dodgers, it just doesn't seem to
register the same way.
First, let's get this straight: $2 bil
lion is not "a lot of money." It's far
more than that. It's an incompre
hensible amount of money. Try and
think of it this way: If it turned out
the price tag was actually $2.01 bil
lion, would you be significantly
more impressed? No. But that is an
extra $lO million, a quantity on its
own that few of us, even Stanford
graduates, will get to see in our life
times.
And what could $2 billion buy
you? A struggling baseball team,
obviously, but also around eight mil
lion tons of ballpark hot dogs, 1.6
million barrels of ballpark beer or
an entire stadium's worth of MLB
tickets for 10 consecutive seasons.
The biggest question, though,
about this quantity of money is
whether it is really worth it. What is
the Guggenheim Baseball Manage
ment group really getting for the
price tag?
Bought by Frank McCourt in
2004 for $355 million, the Dodgers
were valued at $727 million by
Forbes in 2010, less than half of the
aforementioned purchase. Remem
ber, too, that we are talking about a
team struggling with bankruptcy
the existing debt is greater than the
price paid in 2004 and without a
World Series appearance for more
than 20 years. If the Dodgers are
worth this much, what would a team
like the Yankees cost?
And can the new owners really
make this investment pay off? Tele
vision rights and real estate devel
opment may go a long way toward
that goal, but the physical price of
the franchise must at least remain at
the same level to make this work.
Arguably the biggest soccer club
in the United Kingdom, Manches
ter United was bought for nearly
$1.5 billion by the Glazer family in
2005. Even that was a significantly
smaller sum than we are talking
about right now, for a team and a
sport that have far greater global ap
peal than the Dodgers or baseball.
And has it worked? Although the
team looks certain to win the Pre
mier League yet again this year, it is
now saddled with around the $1 bil
lion in debt.
Right now we are still trying to
pull ourselves out of a deep hole cre
ated in part by the hyperinflation of
house prices. Has baseball not been
paying attention?
