# HELLO, OFFENSE!
## CARD BATS COME TO LIFE, BEAT CAL 19-6 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Bad news, Bears.
The No. 6 Stanford baseball team walloped
Cal 19-6 in a nonconference showdown at
Berkeley on Monday afternoon, pulling out
the big bats to reach double digits for the sixth
time this year and set a new season-high in
runs. The Cardinal's three best hitters —jun
ior third baseman Stephen Piscotty, junior sec
ond baseman Kenny Diekroeger and sopho
more first baseman Brian Ragira came to
getherfor 11 hits, two homers and an absurd 16
RBI to overcome the struggling Bears (17-13,
2-7 Pac-12).
Having averaged fewer than five runs per
game since March 31, the offensive explosion

couldn't come at a better time for Stanford
(20-7), which has conclusively pulled out of its
early-conference season slump by winning
four of five since last Monday. Cal, on the other
hand, is still mired in difficulties of its own, now
having lost three in a row after promising se
ries wins against No. 21 Arizona State and No.
23 Texas.
Junior righthander Sahil Bloom pitched
five stellar innings in relief for Stanford, allow
ing just three hits and retiring 11 straight bat
ters to get his first decision of the season, a de
cisive win.
The Cardinal swept the season series
against its Bay Area rival in 2011, winning all
four games before the fifth was rained out with
Stanford in the lead. But three of those four
victories were low-scoring nail-biters, as Stan
ford escaped with 3-2,3-2 and 4-2 decisions.
That wasn't the case yesterday, with the
Cardinal jumping on freshman righthander
Keaton Siomkin for four first-inning runs.
Sophomore rightfielder Austin Wilson had a

one-out double and came home on a Ragira
single. Junior catcher Eric Smith added a single
of his own before a two-RBI double from
Diekroeger, who scored on a single by fresh
man designated hitter Alex Blandino.
Piscotty quickly made it 7-0 in the second
with a three-run homer, his fourth big fly of the
year, and then brought home two more runs
with a bases-loaded single in the third.
Groundouts by Ragira and Smith brought
home two more runs to cap Stanford's 11-hit,
11-run onslaught over the first three innings.
Cal whittled away at the lead with three
runs of its own in the third to oust Cardinal
freshman John Hochstatter making his first
start since a 6-2 loss to Arizona on April 1
and made it 11-4 with a pair of sacrifices in the
bottom of the fourth. But Bloom kept things
under control and blanked the Bears in the
fifth, sixth and seventh frames.
