# COMEBACK BLOCKED
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
The great thing about sports is
that you never know what's going
to happen.
In a match that appeared
headed for a routine sweep, the
Stanford men's volleyball team
suddenly found itself with its
back up against the wall on Sat
urday night, forced to fight off
two match points in the final set.
Much to the relief of the rau
cous home crowd, the No. 5 Car
dinal (18-6, 15-5 MPSF) pre
vailed against the ever-resilient
No. 12 Cal State-Northridge
Matadors (11-16, 7-13) in five
epic sets, 25-19,25-21,22-25,22-
25,19-17.
The victory pushed Stanford's
winning streak to three, and more
importantly, kept the team in
contention for the No. 2 seed in
the conference tournament.
For much of the match, the
Cardinal appeared to be in firm
control. Sophomore Brian Cook
set the tone with his match-high
23 kills, senior setter Evan Barry
kept the offense cruising and
Northridge never led in either of
the first two sets. With star fresh
man Julius Hoefer struggling to
the tune of a .148 hitting percent
age and after a series of verbal
exchanges between Northridge
players and the Stanford student
section, it did not look as though
the Matadors were long for the
match.
Enter 6-foot-4 junior John
Baker, who completely changed
the dynamic of the match. Baker
tallied 20 kills in the final three
sets to lead a furious Matador
charge that saw the visitors rally
from 16-14 deficits in both the
third and fourth sets to force the
final game.
The fifth set was a back-and
forth affair in which neither team
seemed to be able to gain any
separation, until a kill by sopho
more Brandon Lebrock gave the

Matadors a 12-10 advantage.
Suddenly, the match that had
looked all but clinched for the
Cardinal nearly an hour earlier
was in serious jeopardy of slip
ping away.
Luckily for Stanford, there

would be multiple heroes on the
night. Senior libera Erik Shoji
showed why he is a three time
Ail-American and the soon-to
be MPSF Player of the Week, as
the veteran racked up 16 digs and
prolonged numerous rallies.

With the score at 12-11 follow
ing a Lebrock service error, Stan
ford sophomore Steven Irvin hit
a booming ace to even the set at
12 apiece. With the set even at 13,
Baker came through with his
20th kill of the match, bringing
the Matadors to the brink of
completing the comeback.
Stanford fought back once
more, extending the match on
senior Brad Lawson's 18th kill of
the evening. The Cardinal imme
diately found itself on the edge of
defeat following an errant swing
by Cook.
But losing was not in the cards
for Stanford, as Barry, who
played a flawless fifth set, came
up with the kill on the fake set to
give the Cardinal another shot at
15-15. After an attack error by
Baker, it was Northridge's turn to
stave off defeat. Lebrock again
came up with the kill Northridge
needed to even the match at 16.
Stanford was able to side out
once again, this time on an em
phatic kill by sophomore Eric
Mochalski, before Lebrock once
again responded, registering his
21st and final kill of the match.
Stanford was finally able to
break through thanks to another
beautiful set by Barry and the kill
by Irvin before closing the Mata
dors on a block of Baker by sen
ior Gus Ellis and Cook.
For the match, Lawson, Irvin
and Mochalski joined Cook in
recording double-digit kills with
18,16 and 13, respectively, while
Barry tallied 66 assists.
"That was such a fun match to
be part of," said Mochalski, who
at one point dove into the stands
in an attempt to prolong a point.
"Northridge did a great job
bouncing back after the first two
games. But towards the end of
the fifth, Barry took his game to
another level and willed us to the
end."

Senior middle blocker Gus Ellis (No. 3) was part of a game-winning
block that stifled a valiant comeback attempt by visiting Cal State Northridge. The Card escaped on Saturday with a five-set victory.
The great thing about sports is
that you never know what's going
to happen.
In a match that appeared
headed for a routine sweep, the
Stanford men's volleyball team
suddenly found itself with its
back up against the wall on Sat
urday night, forced to fight off
two match points in the final set.
Much to the relief of the rau
cous home crowd, the No. 5 Car
dinal (18-6, 15-5 MPSF) pre
vailed against the ever-resilient
No. 12 Cal State-Northridge
Matadors (11-16, 7-13) in five
epic sets, 25-19,25-21,22-25,22-
25,19-17.
The victory pushed Stanford's
winning streak to three, and more
importantly, kept the team in
contention for the No. 2 seed in
the conference tournament.
For much of the match, the
Cardinal appeared to be in firm
control. Sophomore Brian Cook
set the tone with his match-high
23 kills, senior setter Evan Barry
kept the offense cruising and
Northridge never led in either of
the first two sets. With star fresh
man Julius Hoefer struggling to
the tune of a .148 hitting percent
age and after a series of verbal
exchanges between Northridge
players and the Stanford student
section, it did not look as though
the Matadors were long for the
match.
Enter 6-foot-4 junior John
Baker, who completely changed
the dynamic of the match. Baker
tallied 20 kills in the final three
sets to lead a furious Matador
charge that saw the visitors rally
from 16-14 deficits in both the
third and fourth sets to force the
final game.
The fifth set was a back-and
forth affair in which neither team
seemed to be able to gain any
separation, until a kill by sopho
more Brandon Lebrock gave the

Matadors a 12-10 advantage.
Suddenly, the match that had
looked all but clinched for the
Cardinal nearly an hour earlier
was in serious jeopardy of slip
ping away.
Luckily for Stanford, there

would be multiple heroes on the
night. Senior libera Erik Shoji
showed why he is a three time
Ail-American and the soon-to
be MPSF Player of the Week, as
the veteran racked up 16 digs and
prolonged numerous rallies.

With the score at 12-11 follow
ing a Lebrock service error, Stan
ford sophomore Steven Irvin hit
a booming ace to even the set at
12 apiece. With the set even at 13,
Baker came through with his
20th kill of the match, bringing
the Matadors to the brink of
completing the comeback.
Stanford fought back once
more, extending the match on
senior Brad Lawson's 18th kill of
the evening. The Cardinal imme
diately found itself on the edge of
defeat following an errant swing
by Cook.
But losing was not in the cards
for Stanford, as Barry, who
played a flawless fifth set, came
up with the kill on the fake set to
give the Cardinal another shot at
15-15. After an attack error by
Baker, it was Northridge's turn to
stave off defeat. Lebrock again
came up with the kill Northridge
needed to even the match at 16.
Stanford was able to side out
once again, this time on an em
phatic kill by sophomore Eric
Mochalski, before Lebrock once
again responded, registering his
21st and final kill of the match.
Stanford was finally able to
break through thanks to another
beautiful set by Barry and the kill
by Irvin before closing the Mata
dors on a block of Baker by sen
ior Gus Ellis and Cook.
For the match, Lawson, Irvin
and Mochalski joined Cook in
recording double-digit kills with
18,16 and 13, respectively, while
Barry tallied 66 assists.
"That was such a fun match to
be part of," said Mochalski, who
at one point dove into the stands
