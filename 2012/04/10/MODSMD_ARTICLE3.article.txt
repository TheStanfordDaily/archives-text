## Law School Dean to leave for Hewlett Kramer led curriculum overhaul and shift to quarterly academic calendar 
### ANTONIO RAMIREZ 
Stanford Law School Dean Larry
Kramer announced Wednesday of spring
break that he will be leaving the University
to serve as president of the William and Flora
Hewlett Foundation, a philanthropy organi
zation that issues grants to solve social and
environmental problems. Kramer will suc
ceed current Hewlett Foundation President
Paul Brest, who took the role upon leaving
the Stanford Law School Dean position in
1999.
Kramer leaves behind a legacy of reforms
to the law school curriculum, including de
veloping clinics that allow law students to
represent clients, moving the law school to
the quarter system and overseeing expan
sion of the law campus.
"When Dean Kramer arrived, he made
the buildup of the legal clinic one of his pri
orities," said Lawrence C. Marshall, director
of the Mills Legal Clinic, which operates as a
single law firm and encapsulates
the Law School's assortment of
litigation clinics, including ones
devoted to international human
rights, environmental law, com
munity law and Supreme Court
litigation.
"Since Dean Kramer has ar
rived in 2004, the law school has
developed the capacity for every
student to take a legal clinic,"
Marshall said. "We've trans
formed the program from a part
time to a full-time program, ex
panded the range of opportunities
across subject areas for students
to study and engage in clinical
work, and went from two to 10
clinics."

Later this year, another new
clinic will be open at the Law
School the Stanford Juelsgaard
Intellectual Property and Innova
tion Clinic.

"It is a further testament to the
diversification of kinds of experi
ences that are available through
the program," Marshall said in ref
erence to the new clinic. "At a
time, clinics were almost exclu
sively engaged in litigation. Now,
we have clinics that work on trans
actions for nonprofit organiza
tions, clinics that do fact-finding in
the international human rights
arena and, now, the Juelsgaard
clinic, which will be engaged in
policy-oriented work on behalf of
clients."
With the intention of facilitat
ing interdisciplinary education
with the rest of the University, the
law school switched its academic
calendar from a semester to a
quarter system in the 2009-10
school year, under Kramer's lead
ership.
"Professors are used to think
ing about criminal law or contracts
as a semester course," Brest said.
"Changing the course to the more
intensive period of a quarter re
quires retooling and working with
faculty to overcome resistance. To

help them change requires politi
cal and personal skills and per
suasion."
Stanford is now among only a
handful of law schools to use the
quarter system.
Joint degree programs also saw
a rise under Kramer's leadership.
Currently, the number of formal
joint degree programs stands at 28.
In addition to reforms to the
curriculum, Kramer oversaw the
construction of the William H.
Neukom Building and the Munger
Residences.
"Mr. Neukom was a graduate
of the law school, and I had begun
getting to know him when I was
dean," said Brest in reference to
the process of constructing the
Neukom Building. "He seemed
well-disposed to the law school,
but it took Larry Kramer to build
the trust, the confidence, and to de
velop the common interest to
make the deal for Mr. Neukom to
put as much money as he did into
this beautiful new building.
"Underlying everything is a vi
sion of the importance of the law

school not just as a center for re
search but as away of better
preparing students for the legal
profession and for work in public
policy," Brest added.
Over the years, Kramer has also
held periodic, open town hall
meetings. At each meeting,
Kramer made a small presentation
about the school's current policies
and opened the floor to questions.
"He would be very straightfor
ward with the students," said
Adam Sieff, a first-year Stanford
law student, referring to his im
pression of Kramer at one of the
town hall meetings. "He would go
step-by-step and be very transpar
ent and very honest. I know as a
student I appreciated that."
Kramer's new occupation as
the president of the He wlett Foun
dation has significant worldly im
plications, according to Susan Bell,
vice president of the Hewlett
Foundation and the deputy chair
of the search committee for the
foundation's new president
"To conduct the process to
search for the next president of the
Hewlett Foundation, we decided
to take the time to talk to people
from all over the country and out
side the country about the world in
which this president would be op
erating the foundation over the
next decade," Bell said. "[We dis
cussed] what are some of the issues
that will be arising that will impact
the work we do in education, glob
al development and in the envi
ronment."
"Larry has all the things we
were looking for in terms of a
bright and lively mind, a hunger
and curiosity to make a difference
in the world about the big issues
that vex our socSHARE program
targets first-gen., low-income stu
dentsety," she added. "He has a
wonderful way of going about his
work, as has been demonstrated at
the law school."
Kramer also expressed his ex
citement for the new role.
"The role of the foundation is
to deploy resources not just fi
nancial, but human and intellec
tual to make the world a bet
ter place," Kramer said. "The op
portunity to head such an organi
zation was exciting to me, and
Hewlett in particular focuses on
issues that I care about and does
so in ways that make sense to
me."

tions, clinics that do fact-finding in
the international human rights
arena and, now, the Juelsgaard
clinic, which will be engaged in
policy-oriented work on behalf of
clients."
With the intention of facilitat
ing interdisciplinary education
with the rest of the University, the
law school switched its academic
calendar from a semester to a
quarter system in the 2009-10
school year, under Kramer's lead
ership.
"Professors are used to think
ing about criminal law or contracts
as a semester course," Brest said.
"Changing the course to the more
intensive period of a quarter re
quires retooling and working with
faculty to overcome resistance. To

help them change requires politi
cal and personal skills and per
suasion."
Stanford is now among only a
handful of law schools to use the
quarter system.
Joint degree programs also saw
a rise under Kramer's leadership.
Currently, the number of formal
joint degree programs stands at 28.
In addition to reforms to the
curriculum, Kramer oversaw the
construction of the William H.
Neukom Building and the Munger
Residences.
"Mr. Neukom was a graduate
of the law school, and I had begun
getting to know him when I was
dean," said Brest in reference to
the process of constructing the
Neukom Building. "He seemed
well-disposed to the law school,
but it took Larry Kramer to build
the trust, the confidence, and to de
velop the common interest to
make the deal for Mr. Neukom to
put as much money as he did into
this beautiful new building.
"Underlying everything is a vi
sion of the importance of the law

school not just as a center for re
search but as away of better
preparing students for the legal
profession and for work in public
policy," Brest added.
Over the years, Kramer has also
held periodic, open town hall
meetings. At each meeting,
Kramer made a small presentation
about the school's current policies
and opened the floor to questions.
"He would be very straightfor
ward with the students," said
Adam Sieff, a first-year Stanford
law student, referring to his im
pression of Kramer at one of the
town hall meetings. "He would go
step-by-step and be very transpar
ent and very honest. I know as a
student I appreciated that."
Kramer's new occupation as
the president of the He wlett Foun
dation has significant worldly im
plications, according to Susan Bell,
vice president of the Hewlett
Foundation and the deputy chair
of the search committee for the
foundation's new president
"To conduct the process to
search for the next president of the
Hewlett Foundation, we decided
to take the time to talk to people
from all over the country and out
side the country about the world in
which this president would be op
erating the foundation over the
next decade," Bell said. "[We dis
cussed] what are some of the issues
that will be arising that will impact
the work we do in education, glob
al development and in the envi
ronment."
"Larry has all the things we
were looking for in terms of a
bright and lively mind, a hunger
and curiosity to make a difference
in the world about the big issues
that vex our socSHARE program
targets first-gen., low-income stu
dentsety," she added. "He has a
wonderful way of going about his
work, as has been demonstrated at
the law school."
Kramer also expressed his ex
citement for the new role.
"The role of the foundation is
to deploy resources not just fi
nancial, but human and intellec
tual to make the world a bet
ter place," Kramer said. "The op
portunity to head such an organi
zation was exciting to me, and
Hewlett in particular focuses on
issues that I care about and does
so in ways that make sense to
me."

Law School Dean Larry Kramer leaves behind a legacy of significant reforms to the Law School curriculum, including expanding interdisciplinary education options and moving the Law School to the quarter system.
Stanford Law School Dean Larry
Kramer announced Wednesday of spring
break that he will be leaving the University
to serve as president of the William and Flora
Hewlett Foundation, a philanthropy organi
zation that issues grants to solve social and
environmental problems. Kramer will suc
ceed current Hewlett Foundation President
Paul Brest, who took the role upon leaving
the Stanford Law School Dean position in
1999.
Kramer leaves behind a legacy of reforms
to the law school curriculum, including de
veloping clinics that allow law students to
represent clients, moving the law school to
the quarter system and overseeing expan
sion of the law campus.
"When Dean Kramer arrived, he made
the buildup of the legal clinic one of his pri
orities," said Lawrence C. Marshall, director
of the Mills Legal Clinic, which operates as a
single law firm and encapsulates
the Law School's assortment of
litigation clinics, including ones
devoted to international human
rights, environmental law, com
munity law and Supreme Court
litigation.
"Since Dean Kramer has ar
rived in 2004, the law school has
developed the capacity for every
student to take a legal clinic,"
Marshall said. "We've trans
formed the program from a part
time to a full-time program, ex
panded the range of opportunities
across subject areas for students
to study and engage in clinical
work, and went from two to 10
clinics."

Later this year, another new
clinic will be open at the Law
School the Stanford Juelsgaard
Intellectual Property and Innova
tion Clinic.

"It is a further testament to the
diversification of kinds of experi
ences that are available through
the program," Marshall said in ref
erence to the new clinic. "At a
time, clinics were almost exclu
sively engaged in litigation. Now,
we have clinics that work on trans
actions for nonprofit organiza
tions, clinics that do fact-finding in
the international human rights
arena and, now, the Juelsgaard
clinic, which will be engaged in
policy-oriented work on behalf of
clients."
