# Exec candidates face off
## All slates defend compensation for student leaders 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
This year's ASSU Executive candidates
sparred Monday night during a debate at
the CoHo co-sponsored by The Daily and
The Stanford Review. Slates Zimbroff-
Wagstaff, Open Source Candidates and
Macgregor-Dennis & Druthi participated,
while a fourth and fifth slate, Family Mat
ters and Mwaura-Mbatia, dropped out of
the presidential race fewer than 24 hours
before the event.
Slates had one minute to respond to
each of 12 questions.
Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 and William
Wagstaff 'l2 emphasized that they did not
wish to "reinvent the wheel" of ASSU if
elected. The Open Source Candidates
slate, Daniel Koning 'l4 and Kian Ameli
'l3, representing the Chaparral, stressed
their accessibility through their campaign

wiki site, while Stewart Macgregor-Dennis
'l3, current ASSU vice president, and his
running mate Druthi Ghanta 'l4 highlight
ed that they offer a slate with an ASSU in
sider and outsider.
Macgregor-Dennis's work as ASSU
vice president and his nearly $lO,OOO salary
were the topic of much debate, but none of
the slates said they would take a wage-cut
or refuse payment altogether if elected.
"It's not right to view the presidency as
a leadership position in a student group,
Macgregor-Dennis said. "It's more like a
job that should be compensated that way."
Macgregor-Dennis added that he re
duced his course load in order to be able to
commit more time to ASSU work this year.
Wagstaff commented that as a first-gen
eration student who would not be able to
continue his work as a resident assistant
(RA) or maintain another job if elected, he
would not refuse monetary compensation

from the ASSU.
Koning said he would not turn away the
money either.
"We think there's nothing wrong with
taking the money and running," Koning
said. "It's actually part of our agenda."
Another recurring issue at the debate
was a textbook exchange program advo
cated by Zimbroff and Wagstaff.
"The textbook exchange could go a
long way, and the ASSU could be a conduit
for that," Zimbroff said. "It's an example of
what we would use money on, and we feel
that would be an effective use of funds."
Macgregor-Dennis countered by saying
there is no need for the exchange, pointing
to Book Bazaar, a student-initiated web
site that organizes student textbook trades
without cost to the ASSU. Macgregor-
Dennis noted that the program was started
