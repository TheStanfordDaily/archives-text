# Exec candidates face off
## All slates defend compensation for student leaders 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
This year's ASSU Executive candidates
sparred Monday night during a debate at
the CoHo co-sponsored by The Daily and
The Stanford Review. Slates Zimbroff-
Wagstaff, Open Source Candidates and
Macgregor-Dennis & Druthi participated,
while a fourth and fifth slate, Family Mat
ters and Mwaura-Mbatia, dropped out of
the presidential race fewer than 24 hours
before the event.
Slates had one minute to respond to
each of 12 questions.
Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 and William
Wagstaff 'l2 emphasized that they did not
wish to "reinvent the wheel" of ASSU if
elected. The Open Source Candidates
slate, Daniel Koning 'l4 and Kian Ameli
'l3, representing the Chaparral, stressed
their accessibility through their campaign

wiki site, while Stewart Macgregor-Dennis
'l3, current ASSU vice president, and his
running mate Druthi Ghanta 'l4 highlight
ed that they offer a slate with an ASSU in
sider and outsider.
Macgregor-Dennis's work as ASSU
vice president and his nearly $lO,OOO salary
were the topic of much debate, but none of
the slates said they would take a wage-cut
or refuse payment altogether if elected.
"It's not right to view the presidency as
a leadership position in a student group,
Macgregor-Dennis said. "It's more like a
job that should be compensated that way."
Macgregor-Dennis added that he re
duced his course load in order to be able to
commit more time to ASSU work this year.
Wagstaff commented that as a first-gen
eration student who would not be able to
continue his work as a resident assistant
(RA) or maintain another job if elected, he
would not refuse monetary compensation

from the ASSU.
Koning said he would not turn away the
money either.
"We think there's nothing wrong with
taking the money and running," Koning
said. "It's actually part of our agenda."
Another recurring issue at the debate
was a textbook exchange program advo
cated by Zimbroff and Wagstaff.
"The textbook exchange could go a
long way, and the ASSU could be a conduit
for that," Zimbroff said. "It's an example of
what we would use money on, and we feel
that would be an effective use of funds."
Macgregor-Dennis countered by saying
there is no need for the exchange, pointing
to Book Bazaar, a student-initiated web
site that organizes student textbook trades
without cost to the ASSU. Macgregor-
Dennis noted that the program was started
without any ASSU funding.
Book Bazaar is currently not
being maintained, but the pro
gram's website says it will return
in winter 2012.
Macgregor-Dennis and Ghan
ta emphasized the value of their
slate's combined experience,
both from within and outside of
student government.
"I've been a critic of the ASSU
and the ASSU not being connect
ed with the student body, which I
think will give us an advantage
next year because I'll have that
perspective," Ghanta said. She
also commented that Macgregor-
Dennis's extensive past work
with the ASSU would allow the
pair to start work with different
groups from day one instead of
having to learn the inner-work
ings of student government.
Zimbroff and Wagstaff
stressed their other student
group involvement, including
their work as RAs, in club sports
and in various other student or
ganizations.
"ASSU experience doesn't
prepare you better to be ASSU
president," Zimbroff said. "We
know students' day-to-day lives,
so our experiences prepare us
better."
The Open Source Candidates
also did not feel that their lack of
experience in student govern
ment hurts their qualifications.
"I don't have a whole lot of ex
perience, but I know what I'm
doing," Ameli said. To which
Koning added, "We may not be
smart, but we're both street
smart."
All slates were asked to de
scribe one action item from their
platform.
Macgregor-Dennis & Druthi
spoke about creating an ASSU
Civic Action Unit, which Ghanta
described as "the leveraging plat
form for students to pursue non
profit experiences next year."
Wagstaff and Zimbroff com
mented on campus tutoring pro
grams.
"There are 47 different groups
that go to tutor in [East Palo
Alto] EPA, and we think that's a
great thing, but we want to con
solidate," Wagstaff said. "We
want to condense our service ef
forts and also monitor the great
work there."
During a question-and-an
swer session with the audience,
the slates were asked how they
would discern which comments
and concerns from students merit
serious attention and which are
submitted as jokes.
"If I caught my son smoking a
cigarette, I would make him
smoke the whole pack," Koning
said. "If I caught my son smoking
a joint, I would make him smoke
an ounce blunt. If someone post
ed a joke to our wiki, you better
believe, boy howdy, that we
would implement it."

The Stanford Review. Slates Zimbroff-
Wagstaff, Open Source Candidates and
Macgregor-Dennis & Druthi participated,
while a fourth and fifth slate, Family Mat
ters and Mwaura-Mbatia, dropped out of
the presidential race fewer than 24 hours
before the event.
Slates had one minute to respond to
each of 12 questions.
Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 and William
Wagstaff 'l2 emphasized that they did not
wish to "reinvent the wheel" of ASSU if
elected. The Open Source Candidates
slate, Daniel Koning 'l4 and Kian Ameli
'l3, representing the Chaparral, stressed
their accessibility through their campaign

wiki site, while Stewart Macgregor-Dennis
'l3, current ASSU vice president, and his
running mate Druthi Ghanta 'l4 highlight
ed that they offer a slate with an ASSU in
sider and outsider.
Macgregor-Dennis's work as ASSU
vice president and his nearly $lO,OOO salary
were the topic of much debate, but none of
the slates said they would take a wage-cut
or refuse payment altogether if elected.
"It's not right to view the presidency as
a leadership position in a student group,
Macgregor-Dennis said. "It's more like a
job that should be compensated that way."
Macgregor-Dennis added that he re
duced his course load in order to be able to
commit more time to ASSU work this year.
Wagstaff commented that as a first-gen
eration student who would not be able to
continue his work as a resident assistant
(RA) or maintain another job if elected, he
would not refuse monetary compensation

from the ASSU.
Koning said he would not turn away the
money either.
"We think there's nothing wrong with
taking the money and running," Koning
said. "It's actually part of our agenda."
Another recurring issue at the debate
was a textbook exchange program advo
cated by Zimbroff and Wagstaff.
"The textbook exchange could go a
long way, and the ASSU could be a conduit
for that," Zimbroff said. "It's an example of
what we would use money on, and we feel
that would be an effective use of funds."
Macgregor-Dennis countered by saying
there is no need for the exchange, pointing
to Book Bazaar, a student-initiated web
site that organizes student textbook trades
without cost to the ASSU. Macgregor-
Dennis noted that the program was started
without any ASSU funding.
Book Bazaar is currently not
being maintained, but the pro
gram's website says it will return
in winter 2012.
Macgregor-Dennis and Ghan
ta emphasized the value of their
slate's combined experience,
both from within and outside of
student government.
"I've been a critic of the ASSU
and the ASSU not being connect
ed with the student body, which I
think will give us an advantage
next year because I'll have that
perspective," Ghanta said. She
also commented that Macgregor-
Dennis's extensive past work
with the ASSU would allow the
pair to start work with different
groups from day one instead of
having to learn the inner-work
ings of student government.
Zimbroff and Wagstaff
stressed their other student
group involvement, including
their work as RAs, in club sports
and in various other student or
ganizations.
"ASSU experience doesn't
prepare you better to be ASSU
president," Zimbroff said. "We
know students' day-to-day lives,
so our experiences prepare us
better."
The Open Source Candidates
also did not feel that their lack of
experience in student govern
ment hurts their qualifications.
"I don't have a whole lot of ex
perience, but I know what I'm
doing," Ameli said. To which
Koning added, "We may not be
smart, but we're both street
smart."
All slates were asked to de
scribe one action item from their
platform.
Macgregor-Dennis & Druthi
spoke about creating an ASSU
Civic Action Unit, which Ghanta
described as "the leveraging plat
form for students to pursue non
profit experiences next year."
Wagstaff and Zimbroff com
mented on campus tutoring pro
grams.
"There are 47 different groups
that go to tutor in [East Palo
Alto] EPA, and we think that's a
great thing, but we want to con
solidate," Wagstaff said. "We
want to condense our service ef
forts and also monitor the great
work there."
During a question-and-an
swer session with the audience,
the slates were asked how they
would discern which comments
and concerns from students merit
serious attention and which are
submitted as jokes.
"If I caught my son smoking a
cigarette, I would make him
smoke the whole pack," Koning
said. "If I caught my son smoking
a joint, I would make him smoke
an ounce blunt. If someone post
ed a joke to our wiki, you better
believe, boy howdy, that we
would implement it."
