## Class president slates cite unity as goal 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Next year's senior and sophomore
classes have some competition for class
president with three and two slates run
ning for office, respectively. One slate is
running uncontested for the junior class
presidency.
This turnout is a significant decrease
for the sophomore class, as the past two
elections each had four slates campaign
ing for sophomore class president. For at
least the past seven years, there have been
no fewer than three sophomore slates.
The number of slates for junior class
president is down to one, a more common

occurrence for junior elections.
The drop in sophomore slates does not
necessarily indicate that the class of 2015
is less engaged than freshman classes of
the past, wrote Alicia Hamar 'l5 of the
slate Sophomores: Order of the Cardinal
in an email to The Daily.
"Although there are less slates running
this year, it just may mean that freshmen
are as involved in other pursuits," Hamar
said. "Although there are only two slates
running, we are confident that both slates
are committed and interested in serving
the class. Class presidency isn't everyone's
cup of tea."
The other sophomore slate is The In
credibles, who agreed that their class is

very involved and accomplished on cam
pus.
"We know that students in our class
are extremely accomplished, but we don't
always hear about it," said Costner
McKenzie 'l5 of The Incredibles. The
group said that, if elected, it hopes to cre
ate a sophomore tracker that would in
form students of their class's achieve
ments.
Both slates for sophomore class presi
dent recognize that the transition out of
the freshmen experience can make stu
dents more independent and even less in
tune with the rest of their class.
"Many times, moving out of a
freshman dorm often destroys
class spirit and unity as classmates
are more scattered across cam
pus," Hamar said. "As freshmen,
we are privileged to have such
amazing class activities and
events that help us bond. Howev
er, many of those events disap
pear as the years go by. We want
to keep our class united through
different events that allow sopho
mores to meet other sopho
mores."
Unlike the freshmen running
for class presidency for the first
time, this year's upperclassmen
presidential elections feature
seasoned members of student
government. Foster the Juniors,
the lone junior class slate, has
two current class presidents on
its slate, and The Senior Experi
ence includes one current and
one former class president.
"I've had an incredible experi
ence as a junior class president
and think that being elected as
senior class president would yield
even more opportunities," said
Christine Kim 'l3 of The Senior
Experience. "I love being part of a
group that gets to work with vari
ous Stanford departments and
the administration, in addition to
planning a wide range of events.
Senior year is the last hoorah, and
I want to do everything I can to
make sure it's the best possible
experience for 2013."
Class presidents work as a li
aison between students, adminis
tration and alumni to plan cam
pus-wide events and address stu
dent needs.
"I think the greatest accom
plishment that a class president
can achieve is when you success
fully bring your class together,"
Kim said. "One way of enriching
the Stanford experience for our
entire class is planning academic
and social events."
Daniel Hosltein 'l3 of the
slate Senior Moments agreed
that the primary role of the class
president is social.
"We're not going to aggran
dize senior class president into
some lofty, university policy
making position," Holstein
wrote in an email to The Daily

"We want to foster moments
you remember as some of the
best in your life," he added. "For
most of us, this is the last year of

our college careers, and if it's
anything like high school, a lot of
these memory-ingrained mo
ments will be during this year."
Each slate has specific goals
to address the concerns and de
sires of its class. In order to make
these plans a reality, candidates
must first garner the support of
their peers. The slates' methods
for attracting students to their
campaigns are varied.
The Best Party slate running
for senior class president was in
spired by a documentary of Jon
Gnarr, the mayor of the capital
of Iceland.
"The world has always been
run by the wealthy, educated
people, but they really don't
know what the people want," said
George Malkin 'l3. "[His cam
paign] started as a joke, but he ac
tually ended up winning the
whole thing."
Some of The Best Party's goals
include "not treating sober peo
ple like second-class citizens" and
Pub Nights to which students can
invite professors as away to
bridge the student-faculty divide.
"We want to have fun, but we
are serious about being class pres
idents," said Savannah Gonzales

13.
The Incredibles were in White
Plaza on Friday, April 6 talking to
students about their campaign
goals and listening to feedback.
"We feel as if White Plaza is a
central point on campus, and it's
important for us to be visible to
the entire student body,"
McKenzie said.
Other class president slates
will be tabling on April 11. Order
of the Cardinal has a different
approach to reaching its peers.
"While we do appreciate peo
ple going around and actively
speaking to students as a form of
campaigning, the reality is that
we get most of our information
from . . . the Internet, so our
campaign is focused on grabbing
people's attention online,"
Hamar said. "In a generation and
era where communication hap
pens quickest through the Inter
net, we are showcasing our abili
ty to use our resources to get the
word out."
Voting for class presidents,
ASSU offices and specials fees
begins Thursday, April 12.
