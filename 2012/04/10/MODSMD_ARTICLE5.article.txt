## Class president slates cite unity as goal 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Next year's senior and sophomore
classes have some competition for class
president with three and two slates run
ning for office, respectively. One slate is
running uncontested for the junior class
presidency.
This turnout is a significant decrease
for the sophomore class, as the past two
elections each had four slates campaign
ing for sophomore class president. For at
least the past seven years, there have been
no fewer than three sophomore slates.
The number of slates for junior class
president is down to one, a more common

occurrence for junior elections.
The drop in sophomore slates does not
necessarily indicate that the class of 2015
is less engaged than freshman classes of
the past, wrote Alicia Hamar 'l5 of the
slate Sophomores: Order of the Cardinal
in an email to The Daily.
"Although there are less slates running
this year, it just may mean that freshmen
are as involved in other pursuits," Hamar
said. "Although there are only two slates
running, we are confident that both slates
are committed and interested in serving
the class. Class presidency isn't everyone's
cup of tea."
The other sophomore slate is The In
credibles, who agreed that their class is

very involved and accomplished on cam
pus.
"We know that students in our class
are extremely accomplished, but we don't
always hear about it," said Costner
McKenzie 'l5 of The Incredibles. The
group said that, if elected, it hopes to cre
ate a sophomore tracker that would in
form students of their class's achieve
ments.
Both slates for sophomore class presi
dent recognize that the transition out of
the freshmen experience can make stu
dents more independent and even less in
tune with the rest of their class.
