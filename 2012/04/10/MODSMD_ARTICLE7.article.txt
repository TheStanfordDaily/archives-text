## Searsville committee to evaluate impact 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
TJie newly formed Searsville Alternatives
Study Steering Committee is now directing
planning efforts for potentially major
changes to the Stanford-owned Searsville
Dam and Reservoir. Because the dam con
trols water flow to Stanford's Jasper Biologi
cal Preserve and has a controversial environ
mental impact on surrounding areas, the
committee formed to conduct thorough stud
ies over the next two years to precede any ac
tion, according to Philippe Cohen, adminis
trative director of Jasper Ridge and a mem
ber of the Searsville Alternatives Study
Steering Committee.

Cohen gave a presentation Monday night
at the Stanford National Accelerator Center
outlining the issues the committee faces.
Jasper Ridge presents a particularly chal
lenging situation for the committee. Accord
ing to Cohen, the reserve tries to maintain a
"hands-off' policy as a biological field sta
tion, leaving the terrain untouched by hu
mans. This policy allows for important field
research projects, including the Jasper Ridge
Global Change Experiment, which has been
collecting climate change data since 1992.
The preserve also protects several native
and endangered species, including the steel
headed trout and California red-legged frog.
The idea of the "hands-off" policy is to re
move the human influence factor from natu

ral environments. However, the manmade
Searsville Dam has had a major influence on
the local environment since its construction
in 1892 and the Jasper Ridge area is starting
to feel its long-term consequences, Cohen
said.
In particular, a 1998 study showed that the
dam trapped huge amounts of sediment in
Searsville Lake. The study recorded 207,000
tons of sediment flowing into the dam and
only 15,000 tons flowing out. Searsville Lake
was a public recreation area until Stanford
closed it to the public in 1975.
Over the last decade, the once-popular
lake has diminished in size and become over-
grown as it fills with sediment.
Stanford's Searsville Alterna
tives Study Steering Committee
formed in order to find the best
way to address this growing prob
lem, while mitigating effects on
Jasper Ridge and surrounding
areas. Cohen said that as a result of
the dam's impact over the last cen
tury, preserving the area requires
action.
"The status quo is the only op
tion not on the table," Cohen said.
"If you want to keep it the way it is,
you have to do something."
Cohen said that the committee
has hundreds of options to explore
for action. The major options he
outlined included targeting the
dam by either raising, lowering or
removing it; targeting the reser
voir by either removing sediment
or allowing the lake to fill in; and
exploring outside options such as
adding a bypass channel or divert
ing water.
Part of the recovery process for
the lake, according to Cohen, is

coming to terms with human im
pact on the environment in light of
the "hands-off" policy.
"The human fingerprint is
everywhere," Cohen said.
The challenge now, he said, is to
counteract the Dam's impact with
as little unintended effect as possi
ble on the surrounding San Fran
cisquito Creek and Corte Madera
Creek watersheds.
This goal proves particularly
difficult because the ecological
factors of the area interact in un
predictable ways. For example, ris
ing carbon dioxide levels, which
would intuitively seem positive for
plant growth, in reality, can inhibit
plant growth through various ef
fects on soil conditions and tem
perature.
Because of the complexity of
the ecosystem, the committee is
commissioning two years of stud
ies to determine the right course to
recommend to Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2.
Cohen said that funding con
versations will take place after the
studies, but Stanford will fund any
changes to the area.
