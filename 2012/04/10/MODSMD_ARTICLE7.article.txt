## Searsville committee to evaluate impact 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
TJie newly formed Searsville Alternatives
Study Steering Committee is now directing
planning efforts for potentially major
changes to the Stanford-owned Searsville
Dam and Reservoir. Because the dam con
trols water flow to Stanford's Jasper Biologi
cal Preserve and has a controversial environ
mental impact on surrounding areas, the
committee formed to conduct thorough stud
ies over the next two years to precede any ac
tion, according to Philippe Cohen, adminis
trative director of Jasper Ridge and a mem
ber of the Searsville Alternatives Study
Steering Committee.

Cohen gave a presentation Monday night
at the Stanford National Accelerator Center
outlining the issues the committee faces.
Jasper Ridge presents a particularly chal
lenging situation for the committee. Accord
ing to Cohen, the reserve tries to maintain a
"hands-off' policy as a biological field sta
tion, leaving the terrain untouched by hu
mans. This policy allows for important field
research projects, including the Jasper Ridge
Global Change Experiment, which has been
collecting climate change data since 1992.
The preserve also protects several native
and endangered species, including the steel
headed trout and California red-legged frog.
The idea of the "hands-off" policy is to re
move the human influence factor from natu

ral environments. However, the manmade
Searsville Dam has had a major influence on
the local environment since its construction
in 1892 and the Jasper Ridge area is starting
to feel its long-term consequences, Cohen
said.
In particular, a 1998 study showed that the
dam trapped huge amounts of sediment in
Searsville Lake. The study recorded 207,000
tons of sediment flowing into the dam and
only 15,000 tons flowing out. Searsville Lake
was a public recreation area until Stanford
closed it to the public in 1975.
Over the last decade, the once-popular
lake has diminished in size and become over-
