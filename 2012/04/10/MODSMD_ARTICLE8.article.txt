# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Rep.Issa discusses SOPA/PIPA Vocal critic of failed Internet regulations outlines future legislation 
### AARON SEKHRI 
Congressman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.)
engaged in a public conversation Mon
day evening with Anthony Falzone, di
rector of the Fair Use Project at the Cen
ter for Internet and Society (CIS), on the
broad subject of Internet freedoms and
intellectual property. The event, entitled
"SOPA, PIPA and Internet Freedom:
Where Do We Go From Here?" was held
at the Law School in front of a crowd of
mostly graduate students and faculty.
Honing in on the heavily opposed
Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Pro
tect IP Act (PIPA), which failed in the
U.S. Senate and House, respectively, Issa
discussed the need for unambiguous laws
in this domain.
Issa, chairman of the House Commit
tee on Oversight and Government Re
form, weighed in on SOPA and PIPA,
both of which he vocally opposed. Artic
ulating his primary concerns against the
laws, Issa claimed that the legislation was
"too loosely written" and exhibited an
unreasonable "expansion of individual
and judicial power."
When asked by Falzone about the in
troduction of the bills in Congress, Issa
said that many thought the law would
pass, and the defeat was a surprise to
many in Congress. The legislation's con
ception, he said, was lacking in intelli
gence, transparency and precision.
Issa detailed the strategy against the
law as "stalling for time, and making it ra
dioactive," citing the work of a number of
legislators, most significantly Rep. Jason
Chaffetz (R-Utah).
Explaining the key factors that de
railed SOPA and PIPA, Issa reflected on
what he saw as the most important criti-
cisms levied against the bills: Do
main Name System (DNS) block
ing and a stifling effect on innova
tion.
"The law would have basically
shut off the innovation created in
a 20-square mile radius of right
here," said Issa, referring to Sili
con Valley.
On Jan. 18, more than 7,000
websites issued "blackouts" in
protest of the two bills. Issa credit
ed the multitude of websites that
protested the bills as sounding
their death knell.
He proceeded to discuss his
own alternative, the Online Pro
tection and Enforcement of Digi
tal Trade (OPEN) Act, which he

claimed would more effectively
address the online piracy debate,
"We have to make legislation
as surgical and as minimal as pos
sible to diminish the unintended
consequences and the excesses
large, loose laws create," Issa said.
Issa also described his 'Madi
son' program, a crowdsourcing
platform that "integrates com
ments and suggestions from the
people at each step of the legisla
tive process."
He described his vision for the
legislative process as one in
which laws are presented as
working documents to be trans
parently viewed and critiqued as
they evolve, although he admit
ted the difficulties of achieving
such a goal.
Issa maintained that the "sig
nificant challenges we face in the
area of Internet legislation" are
the result of a tax structure that

balances legitimate ends against
the "arbitrary creation of taxes by
government to raise funds," sti
fling "innovative businesses."
In response to audience ques
tions, Issa continued to assert his
support for minimal, but effective
government regulation. He also
stressed the importance of reach
ing a consensus, conducting grad
ual change and creating transpar
ent, open government.
"The talk left me less cynical
about the nature of politics," said
Josh Horowitz, a first-year Ph.D.
student who attended the event.
"Hearing a congressperson speak
ing for the first time was a human
izing experience and removed
quite a few prejudices I had about
legislators and the process as a
whole."
