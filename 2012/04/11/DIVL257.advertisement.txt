Department of Physics, Stanford University presents
The Robert Hofstadter Memorial Lectures
Free Public lectures - no charge to attend!
April 16 and 17, 2012
Invited Speaker: Prof. Geoffrey West
Distinguished Professor, Santa Fe Institute
Public Lecture: Monday, April 16,2012
at 8:00 PM in the Hewlett Teaching Center
Rm. 200,370 Serra Mall, Stanford University
Searching for Simplicity and Unity in the Complexity of Life:
Cells to Cities, Companies to Ecosystems, Milliseconds to Millenia"
Why do we stop growing, live for 100 years and sleep 8 hours a day? Why do all companies (and people!) die
whereas cities keep growing and the pace of life continues to accelerate? Are cities and companies "just" large
organisms? How are these questions related to innovation, wealth creation and global sustainability?
Afternoon Colloquium: Tuesday, April 17,2012
at 4:15 PM in the Hewlett Teaching Center
Room 201, 370 Serra Mall, Stanford University
"Universal Scaling Laws from Cells to Cities: A Physicist's Search for Quantitative, Unified Theories of
Biological and Social Structure and Dynamics"
Many of the most challenging, exciting and profound questions facing science and society, from the origins of life
to global sustainability, fall under the banner of "complex adaptive systems." This talk explores how scaling can be
used to begin physics-inspired quantitative, predictive, coarse-grained theories for understanding their structure,
dynamics and organization based on underlying mathematisable principles.
