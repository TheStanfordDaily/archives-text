joint degrees for graduate students in law, business, medicine,
social sciences and MS&E and stand-alone degrees for students
from other disciplines. Multidisciplinary in nature, the graduate
program draws students and faculty from across campus.

health, regulation, science, international and education policy.
Currently-enrolled Stanford graduate and undergraduate
students may apply.
