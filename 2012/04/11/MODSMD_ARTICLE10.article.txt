## OVER TROUBLED WATER 
### â€“ Ethan Kessinger 
It's no secret: College life is replete
with its own set of unique expectations
and anxieties. Whether academic, ath
letic, professional or personal, these
demands can take a toll on student
well-being.
Though the Stanford campus is home to
a professional mental health and counsel
ing center, Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) located at Vaden Health
Center, the University hosts another stu
dent support resource: the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center.
The Bridge has been an integral part of
the Stanford community since 1971, when
it was founded as a student-run drug-coun
seling center by Vincent D'Andrea, former
staff psychiatrist for student health at Stan
ford. The name of the center was inspired
by the uplifting Simon and Garfunkel song
"Bridge over Troubled Water," released in
1970, which describes an individual's
promise to support his friend in dire times.
Since the 19705, the Bridge has evolved
into a peer counseling, workshop and sup
port center for Stanford and the surround
ing Palo Alto area.The Bridge staff counsels
between 400 to 600 visitors annually and
hosts wellness events throughout the year.
Until 2009, the annual Stanford Spring
Faire, an arts and craft fair that attracted
people from throughout California and the
Bay Area with a variety of booths and
events, funded the Bridge's operations.
Since then, however, the center has been
primarily funded through ASSU special
fees.
Located in Rogers House near the Fac
ulty Club and Tresidder Memorial Union,
the Bridge's office is a 24 hours a day, seven
days a week operation that invites students
to drop in from 9 a.m. to midnight or call at
any hour of the day for counseling con
ducted by trained undergraduate and
graduate students.
Several volunteer peer counselors live in
the house, and counselors bring homework
to their shifts, as away to give the counsel
ing center the casual, inviting appearance of
a friend's dorm room as opposed to that of
a professional counseling office. The goal is
to create a laid-back and comfortable envi
ronment in which students can feel safe and

at ease while discussing their problems.
Despite the inviting decor and the
friendly staff, a larger number of students
use the 24-hour call-in support system than
the drop-in services. According to the
Bridge, most cases they address relate to ro
mantic relationships or friendships, with the
second most common issue being academic
stress.
"I was feeling really stressed [during] my
freshman year, and I felt like everyone else
could handle it except for me," said a junior,
who chose to remain anonymous. "I called
the Bridge twice, and both times they really
helped me feel less anxious. I don't know if
I would have been able to get grounded
without their help."
Aspiring Bridge counselors must take
two mandatory classes and pass an evalua
tion. Education 193 A: Core Listening Skills,
a two-unit course, teaches general peer

counseling and listening skills. In addition to
serving as a necessary component of the
Bridge's training program, this class is a re
quirement for most counseling positions on
campus.
In addition to Education 193A, the
Bridge trainees must take Education 193P:
Peer Counseling at the Bridge, a one-unit
class that instructs participants on how to
properly counsel students and covers the
expectations of work at the center.

"We have guest speakers every week to
talk about issues students might call about,"
said Emily Cohodes 'l3, a teaching assistant
for Education 193A and a current peer
counselor at the Bridge.
"I had some pretty serious calls last
year," Cohodes said. "It is really important
to learn how to handle them."

The Bridge counselors who do not live in
the house take three-hour shifts and very
often do not receive many calls or drop-in
visitors. However, when calls do come in,
counselors can make a huge difference in
the lives of the students and other individu
als who enlist their services. For Tara Hasan
'l3, a counselor at the Bridge, the thanks she
receives from the students she counsels are a
constant reminder of why she volunteers
there.

"The reason I keep [working] with The
Bridge is at the end they are legitimately
thanking me for helping them," she said.
The Bridge is open for walk-ins from 9
a.m. to midnight. Their call-in service is avail
able 24 hours a day.
