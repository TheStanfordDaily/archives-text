# OPINIONS
## EDITORIAL Zimbroff-Wagstaff for ASSU Executive 
### 
For the 2012-13 ASSU Ex
ecutive, the Editorial
Board unanimously en
dorses Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 and
William Wagstaff 'l2, a pair of co
terms that we feel will best repre
sent the student body in the up
coming year.To reach this conclu
sion, the Board held forty minute
interviews this past Friday with
all three slates still in contention:
Zimbroff-Wagstaff, MacGregor-
Dennis & Druthi, and Open
Source Candidates, the joke
slate fielded by the Stanford
Chaparral. On Sunday, we spent
an additional hour discussing the
advantages and disadvantages
of the two sincere slates, Zim
broff-Wagstaff and MacGregor-
Dennis & Druthi. Our ideal
ASSU Executive would have a
nuanced understanding of the
position, broad experiences with
which to give context to their
work, a coherent platform with
concrete, relevant, and realiz
able initiatives, and a strong abil
ity to connect with students, fac
ulty, and administrators. On all
but the first qualification a
strong knowledge of the ASSU
we felt Zimbroff-Wagstaff
was the strongest slate.
Zimbroff and Wagstaff began
the interview by stating a desire
to not "reinvent the wheel," al
luding to the common-sense ap
proach that informs their plat
form. They understand that
there are student and adminis
trative groups already commit
ted to improving public service,
student health, dining and other
areas of campus life. Rather than
create ASSU policies that over
lap with or oppose the missions
of these groups, Zimbroff and
Wagstaff would work to fill in
the gaps. One of their many con
crete ideas that resonated with
us was giving freshman resident
assistants monetary incentives
to plan events with community
centers. In addition, we found
their objectivity commendable.
They recognized, for instance,
that Vaden provides valuable
services and, rather than wholly
criticize Vaden, they viewed stu
dent dissatisfaction as an out
growth of an unnecessary com
munication gap.
With that in mind, the slate of
Stewart MacGregor-Dennis 'l3
and Druthi Ghanta 'l4 demon
strated a superior knowledge of
the ASSU and the ways with
which to leverage the powers of
the Executive, which is not sur
prising given MacGregor-Den
nis' role as ASSU vice president
this year. But although Zimbroff
and Wagstaff are ASSU out
siders, they appear to be working
diligently to catch up, whether
through reading administrative
documents going back many
years, attending ASSU Senate
meetings, or talking with current
and former ASSU leaders and
campus administrators. We are
confident, then, that Zimbroff
and Wagstaff would acquaint
themselves quickly with the ins
and outs of the office if elected,
and their diverse academic and
extracurricular experiences over
a combined eight years at Stan
ford will surely be beneficial in
the adjustment.
Perhaps Zimbroff and
Wagstaff's most distinctive
strength, though, is that they are
highly personable. This quality is
even more important given the
current state of general student
apathy, if not distrust, surround
ing the ASSU. They were both
intelligible, straightforward
speakers who spoke in substance
rather than buzzwords. The two

also possess a synergy that will
make for a highly cohesive exec
utive unit. In addition, when
asked questions to which they
hadn't prepared an answer, their
thought process was calm and
deliberate. This is contrasted
with MacGregor-Dennis' self
identified approach to dive-in,
evaluate and then iterate. Al
though the latter philosophy
may be valuable in the start-up
world, we have doubts over its
efficacy in student government,
where one wrong remark can in
stantly alienate students and ad
ministrators. In short, we have
more reason to believe that Zim
broff and Wagstaff would effec
tively communicate and forge
relationships with the adminis
tration, Faculty Senate, student
groups and other ASSU bodies.
On many issues, ranging from
reimbursements by Stanford
Student Enterprises (SSE) to
graduate student involvement,
both slates offered similar re
sponses. However, the two slates
were vastly different in the scope
of their platforms. While Zim
broff-Wagstaff presented a fo
cused and coherent vision for
next year, we ultimately felt that
MacGregor-Dennis & Druthi
would offer more of the same as
Stanford 2.0: a highly bureau
cratic student government that
does little to inspire students and
administrators. Their 40-page
platform, which offers some
thing for everybody, is often
lacking in details. For instance,
the proposed "Academic Action
Unit" is defined as "representa
tives from each school [that]
work specifically on academic is
sues." What that means is be
yond us, and many of their other
platform points are similarly
vague. Of their more concrete
suggestions, many would do lit
tle to improve student life and/or
would conflict with services al
ready offered; they pledge, for
instance, to offer nutrition con
sulting services, which are al
ready provided through Vaden.
Although we endorse Zim
broff-Wagstaff, we were im
pressed with MacGregor-Den
nis' passion for student govern
ment and Ghanta's commitment
to learning the intricacies of the
ASSU.The two worked well as a
team, and MacGregor-Dennis
spoke sincerely of a commit
ment to become more pluralis
tic after criticisms this past year
of his focus on entrepreneur
ship. Furthermore, MacGregor-
Dennis' intensity would be a
welcome departure from ASSU
Senators who want to end their
terms early. Ultimately, though,
we worry that much of their
platform will not be realized; in
addition, there seems to be no
priority structure in place to en
sure that their most pressing ini
tiatives are effectively pursued.
Zimbroff and Wagstaff, on
the other hand, have for the mo
ment narrowed their focus to a
select number of pragmatic re
forms that would improve al
most everyone's Stanford expe
rience. This, along with their ap
proachable personalities and di
verse experiences, would go a
long way in restoring credibility
to the ASSU.

and Wagstaff would acquaint
themselves quickly with the ins
and outs of the office if elected,
and their diverse academic and
extracurricular experiences over
a combined eight years at Stan
ford will surely be beneficial in
the adjustment.
Perhaps Zimbroff and
Wagstaff's most distinctive
strength, though, is that they are
highly personable. This quality is
even more important given the
current state of general student
apathy, if not distrust, surround
ing the ASSU. They were both
intelligible, straightforward
speakers who spoke in substance
rather than buzzwords. The two

also possess a synergy that will
make for a highly cohesive exec
utive unit. In addition, when
asked questions to which they
hadn't prepared an answer, their
thought process was calm and
deliberate. This is contrasted
with MacGregor-Dennis' self
identified approach to dive-in,
evaluate and then iterate. Al
though the latter philosophy
may be valuable in the start-up
world, we have doubts over its
efficacy in student government,
where one wrong remark can in
stantly alienate students and ad
ministrators. In short, we have
more reason to believe that Zim
broff and Wagstaff would effec
tively communicate and forge
relationships with the adminis
tration, Faculty Senate, student
groups and other ASSU bodies.
On many issues, ranging from
reimbursements by Stanford
Student Enterprises (SSE) to
graduate student involvement,
both slates offered similar re
sponses. However, the two slates
were vastly different in the scope
of their platforms. While Zim
broff-Wagstaff presented a fo
cused and coherent vision for
next year, we ultimately felt that
MacGregor-Dennis & Druthi
would offer more of the same as
Stanford 2.0: a highly bureau
cratic student government that
does little to inspire students and
administrators. Their 40-page
platform, which offers some
thing for everybody, is often
lacking in details. For instance,
the proposed "Academic Action
Unit" is defined as "representa
tives from each school [that]
work specifically on academic is
sues." What that means is be
yond us, and many of their other
platform points are similarly
vague. Of their more concrete
suggestions, many would do lit
tle to improve student life and/or
would conflict with services al
ready offered; they pledge, for
instance, to offer nutrition con
sulting services, which are al
ready provided through Vaden.
Although we endorse Zim
broff-Wagstaff, we were im
pressed with MacGregor-Den
nis' passion for student govern
ment and Ghanta's commitment
to learning the intricacies of the
ASSU.The two worked well as a
team, and MacGregor-Dennis
spoke sincerely of a commit
ment to become more pluralis
tic after criticisms this past year
of his focus on entrepreneur
ship. Furthermore, MacGregor-
Dennis' intensity would be a
welcome departure from ASSU
Senators who want to end their
terms early. Ultimately, though,
we worry that much of their
platform will not be realized; in
addition, there seems to be no
priority structure in place to en
sure that their most pressing ini
tiatives are effectively pursued.
Zimbroff and Wagstaff, on
the other hand, have for the mo
ment narrowed their focus to a
select number of pragmatic re
forms that would improve al
most everyone's Stanford expe
rience. This, along with their ap
proachable personalities and di
verse experiences, would go a
long way in restoring credibility
to the ASSU.

For the 2012-13 ASSU Ex
ecutive, the Editorial
Board unanimously en
dorses Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 and
William Wagstaff 'l2, a pair of co
terms that we feel will best repre
sent the student body in the up
coming year.To reach this conclu
sion, the Board held forty minute
interviews this past Friday with
all three slates still in contention:
Zimbroff-Wagstaff, MacGregor-
Dennis & Druthi, and Open
Source Candidates, the joke
slate fielded by the Stanford
Chaparral. On Sunday, we spent
an additional hour discussing the
advantages and disadvantages
of the two sincere slates, Zim
broff-Wagstaff and MacGregor-
Dennis & Druthi. Our ideal
ASSU Executive would have a
nuanced understanding of the
position, broad experiences with
which to give context to their
work, a coherent platform with
concrete, relevant, and realiz
able initiatives, and a strong abil
ity to connect with students, fac
ulty, and administrators. On all
but the first qualification a
strong knowledge of the ASSU
we felt Zimbroff-Wagstaff
was the strongest slate.
Zimbroff and Wagstaff began
the interview by stating a desire
to not "reinvent the wheel," al
luding to the common-sense ap
proach that informs their plat
form. They understand that
there are student and adminis
trative groups already commit
ted to improving public service,
student health, dining and other
areas of campus life. Rather than
create ASSU policies that over
lap with or oppose the missions
of these groups, Zimbroff and
Wagstaff would work to fill in
the gaps. One of their many con
crete ideas that resonated with
us was giving freshman resident
assistants monetary incentives
to plan events with community
centers. In addition, we found
their objectivity commendable.
They recognized, for instance,
that Vaden provides valuable
services and, rather than wholly
criticize Vaden, they viewed stu
dent dissatisfaction as an out
growth of an unnecessary com
munication gap.
With that in mind, the slate of
Stewart MacGregor-Dennis 'l3
and Druthi Ghanta 'l4 demon
strated a superior knowledge of
the ASSU and the ways with
which to leverage the powers of
the Executive, which is not sur
prising given MacGregor-Den
nis' role as ASSU vice president
this year. But although Zimbroff
and Wagstaff are ASSU out
siders, they appear to be working
diligently to catch up, whether
through reading administrative
documents going back many
years, attending ASSU Senate
meetings, or talking with current
and former ASSU leaders and
campus administrators. We are
confident, then, that Zimbroff
and Wagstaff would acquaint
themselves quickly with the ins
and outs of the office if elected,
and their diverse academic and
extracurricular experiences over
a combined eight years at Stan
ford will surely be beneficial in
the adjustment.
