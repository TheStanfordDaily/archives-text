# BURSTING THE BUBBLE
## Manly men do cry 
### Edward Ngai 
As Bubba Watson watched
his shot from deep in the
woods dribble to within
feet of the hole at Augusta Na
tional on Sunday, perhaps he
knew he would soon be a house
hold name.
The new Masters champion,
the 33-year-old self-taught golfer
with the hot pink driver, is truly a
maverick in a staid sport. And so
when he dropped in his putt to
seal the win, there was no emphat
ic arm pump, no Tiger-esque
yelling. Instead, he broke down in
tears, hugging his caddie, his mom,
his colleagues, his caddie again,
his mom again, all while sobbing
like a baby.
Cue the armchair pundits, who
piled on mercilessly. "Kudos to
Bubba for winning, but what is
with all the blubbering?" wrote
Bart Pfankuch of the Herald Trib
une. Kathy Lee Griffin of the
Today show qualified her support
of Watson by saying that men who
cry too much should "go home to
mommy."
This is hardly a new phenome
non. For a long time, men crying in
public was considered a great
weakness. In the 1972 presidential
campaign, Democratic frontrun
ner Ed Muskie was forced to de
fend the integrity of his wife in
what is referred to as the "crying
speech." Having to stop three
times and wipe his face, his tears
were splashed on front pages
across the country. Voters decided
they didn't like this display of
emotion from their would-be
commander-in-chief, and so de
fected to support Muskie's rival,

George McGovern. Afterwards,
Muskie would assert that his
"tears" were in fact melting
snowflakes; regardless, his display
of emotion rebuffed what was a
sure march to the presidential
nomination.
Yet Mr. Muskie was hardly the
only man to have shed his tears in
public.
Walter Cronkite, whose boom
ing voice made him a pillar of
strength and integrity in living
rooms across the country, teared
up on the air in 1963 when report
ing on the assassination of John F.
Kennedy. "I choked up, I really
had a little trouble," he would re
call. "Fortunately, I grabbed hold
before really crying."
Andre Agassi, after having
played his last game in the 2006
U.S. Open, stood at midcourt in
tears, his hand clasped over his
mouth, as fans gave him a five
minute standing ovation.
And Ray Bourque, one of the
toughest players to play a sport
synonymous with grit and tough
ness â€” ice hockey cried freely
after winning the Stanley Cup in his
very last game as a pro. After mak
ing the playoffs 19 times, he finally
won his only Cup with Colorado;
the image of him holding Lord
Stanley's trophy above his head at
long last, tears streaming down his
face, is still an image burned into
the consciousness of the hockey
faithful from sea to sea.

This is simply a very abridged
compilation of the manly men
who have been overcome with
emotion. Indeed, the list grows
much longer, especially in our

time, where crying's salty stigma
seems to burn less.
Yes, the criers still get mocked
for example, the Speaker
dubbed-Weeper of the House,
John Boehner. Perhaps due to his
very public repeated endorse
ments of Kleenex, two years after
his ascension to the highest seat in
Congress, he is still the butt of
SNL jokes.
Yet it would also be a great
shame to let tears define our role
models. Sure, there was once a
time when sobs meant weakness
and emotional instability. There
was once a time where crying was
unbecoming of a man, and cer
tainly unbecoming of a champion.
But it should be abundantly
clear that this is not the case. The
most powerful men in the world
from George Washington to
the Honorable Weeper have
cried in public. The toughest men
in the world have cried in public.
The fact of the matter is, we all cry,
and doing so in the presence of
others simply shows them how
you feel.
Is that really so bad?
So go on, Bubba, cry it out.
After all, you've got a mighty
plush green sleeve to soak up the
tears.

Ray Bourqiie and theAvs may have
won it all in 2001, but Ed is sure it'll
be the Canucks in 2012. Cry over
