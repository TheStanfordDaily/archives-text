£ £ T m premed but I'm major-
I ing in communication."
-LCue awkward silence. The
small smile on my face stays put as
I count to 10 in my head, waiting for
the inevitable, when one of the peo
ple I'm talking to finally decides to
break the silence,
"That's . . . interesting. Why
did you decide to do that?"
This is the reaction that I've
gotten used to ever since I decid
ed to be a communication major
during winter break of this
school year. The idea that one
might be able to enjoy and pur
sue both science and the human
ities seems unfathomable to
many of the people I talk to, both
back at home and here on cam
pus. Some of my family members
don't understand why I wouldn't
just want to focus on being a biol
ogy or chemistry major, since the
major requirements for those de
partments line up neatly with a lot
of the premed requisites. Mean
while, quite a few of my friends at
Stanford remain stumped by my
decision. Those who are majoring
strictly in the humanities don't un
derstand how I could possibly
want to sit through a math class or
do a biology p-set, and those who
are premed stare at me like I'm
carrying a disease when I tell them
that I really enjoy writing. Neither
side understands how I could not
only be a fan but also be a part of
how the other half lives.
Despite the great techie-fuzzy
divide, however, I personally
don't see what the big deal is with
being a premed humanities major.
To me, the concept is simple:
thanks to some of my extracurric
ular pursuits in high school and
college, I have realized that I want
to spend my life helping others by

providing healthcare. That said, I
am aware of the fact that pursuing
medicine is no small feat. It re
quires the completion of many
prerequisite classes, followed by
four years at med school, and then
board exams, residencies and fel
lowships. It's a long process, and
the way I see it, my undergraduate
career is really my only chance to
delve into and hone my other aca
demic interests so that they can
aid me in the future, hence the
communication degree.
I don't see my interests as con
flicting. I've been slowly working
through the list of premed requi
sites since I arrived here at Stan
ford, and I still plan on taking the
MCAT and applying to med school
alongside my strictly scientific
classmates. The communication
classes that I've been taking have
merely supplemented those requi
sites. I have learned how to set and
adhere to strict deadlines, how to
outline something properly, how to
network, how to discern important
information from fluff and how to
ask the proper questions when try
ing to elicit information. All skills
that I see as helping me out when
dealing with patients.
To top it all off, medical schools
seem to be accepting the fact that
the humanities and social sciences
are becoming more relevant to the
doctors of tomorrow. It was recent
ly announced that the MCAT will
be different starting in 2015. The
test, which contains the traditional
biology, physics and dreaded or
ganic chemistry sections, is being
adapted to include a new social and
behavioral science section (think
psychology) as well as a new critical
analysis section that will ask stu
dents to analyze passages from a
wide range of social science and hu-

manities disciplines. The reason for
the changes? Because "it tests the
analysis and reasoning skills you
need for medical school and may
prompt you to read broadly as you
prepare," according to the preview
guide for the 2015 MCAT.
Recent studies have also shown
no difference between the accept
ance rates of science and non-sci
ence majors and no difference be
tween the performances of these
varied individuals at medical
school.
I often hear some of my fellow
premeds talking about philosophy
or psychology or other nontradi
tional paths, but at the end of the
day, most of them remain tradition
al graduates, leaving with degrees
in departments that they love but
never having fully explored their
other interests.To those of you who
are still trying to decide what to
major in, just consider this: the
numbers all say the same thing
there's no harm in majoring in what
you want to major in, even if you
plan on being premed.
So, for now, I'm going to keep
writing and I'm going to keep going
to lab. Sure, it may be the road less
traveled, but there's no indication
that it isn't going to take me where
I want to go in the end. And if col
lege has taught me anything, it's
that there's no harm in a little bit of
exploration along the way.
