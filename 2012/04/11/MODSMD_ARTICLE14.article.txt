## CATCHING UP WITH SMITH JUNIOR TALKS POSITION CHANGE, BREAKOUT YEAR 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Junior Eric Smith, the starting
catcher for the No. 6 Stanford
baseball team, took over behind
the plate this season after two
years as a backup infielder. He
currently leads the Cardinal (20-7,
4-5 Pac-12) with a .360 batting av
erage, recently getting three hits
and an RBI in the team's 19-6 win
at Cal on Monday. Smith recently
sat down with The Daily to discuss
Pac-12 baseball, the team's mid
season slump and catching for
first-round draft picks.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Eric,
you're 25 games into your first
season as a starting catcher and
you're currently the team's best
hitter. What have you been doing
right at the plate so far this year?
Eric Smith (ES): One of my big
things is just trying to stay as re

laxed and calm at the plate as pos
sible. I try to not let past at-bats,
past pitches, past whatever's hap
pened previously in the game or
previously in other games affect
what I'm trying to do at the plate.
Every at-bat is its own at-bat, and
nothing from the past should im
pact how you're doing now, be
cause if you carry at-bats, you
carry calls, you carry strikeouts or
you carry bad outcomes, it's going
to affect you during an at-bat or
during a game.
So I just try and take every
pitch as its own and cherish every
moment that I have up there with
these guys. I just look for a contin
ual goal I can [accomplish] at the
plate, whether it's moving a guy
up, getting a sac fly or trying to get
a hit.
TSD: You come in as a catcher for
your first time at Stanford, and all
