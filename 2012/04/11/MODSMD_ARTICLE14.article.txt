## CATCHING UP WITH SMITH JUNIOR TALKS POSITION CHANGE, BREAKOUT YEAR 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Junior Eric Smith, the starting
catcher for the No. 6 Stanford
baseball team, took over behind
the plate this season after two
years as a backup infielder. He
currently leads the Cardinal (20-7,
4-5 Pac-12) with a .360 batting av
erage, recently getting three hits
and an RBI in the team's 19-6 win
at Cal on Monday. Smith recently
sat down with The Daily to discuss
Pac-12 baseball, the team's mid
season slump and catching for
first-round draft picks.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Eric,
you're 25 games into your first
season as a starting catcher and
you're currently the team's best
hitter. What have you been doing
right at the plate so far this year?
Eric Smith (ES): One of my big
things is just trying to stay as re

laxed and calm at the plate as pos
sible. I try to not let past at-bats,
past pitches, past whatever's hap
pened previously in the game or
previously in other games affect
what I'm trying to do at the plate.
Every at-bat is its own at-bat, and
nothing from the past should im
pact how you're doing now, be
cause if you carry at-bats, you
carry calls, you carry strikeouts or
you carry bad outcomes, it's going
to affect you during an at-bat or
during a game.
So I just try and take every
pitch as its own and cherish every
moment that I have up there with
these guys. I just look for a contin
ual goal I can [accomplish] at the
plate, whether it's moving a guy
up, getting a sac fly or trying to get
a hit.
TSD: You come in as a catcher for
your first time at Stanford, and all


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Eric Smith spent two years as a backup infielder for the Stanford baseball
team before taking over as this year's starting catcher. He currently leads
the team with a .360 batting average, including three hits in Monday's win.
of a sudden you're catching guys
like juniors Mark Appel and
Brett Mooneyham, who are both
likely to be first-rounders this
summer. What has it been like
with those guys on the mound?
ES: This being my first year as a
catcher, having to catch guys like
Appel and Mooney and even
some of the guys like [senior re
liever Dean] McArdle and [fresh
man closer David] Schmidt
you're definitely thrown into the
fire right away. There are general
ly growing periods where I'm not
used to catching them, to develop
my catcher-pitcher relationship
with them, but when they're
going good like they have been all
year it makes my job pretty easy. I
just have to throw up my glove
and they're going to hit it most of
the time. They're awesome to
work with, and it's truly awesome
to be working with future first
round picks and possibly future
major leaguers.
TSD: For the team, there was that
really frustrating stretch where
you guys dropped that last game
to USC and then got swept by
Arizona. What do you think you
guys have been doing better to
pull yourselves out of that slump?
ES: In baseball that's why we play
so many games, because stretches
like this are going to happen to
teams, and even the best teams.
[Recent No. 1] Florida has lost
back-to-back series.
I think one of the major adjust
ments we've made is to try and let
go of some of the frustrations
people are having at the plate.
People are going to go through
spots, people are not going to be
hitting the ball as well as they like
to. I mean, everyone who's played
baseball has experienced this. I
think that period where we didn't
play our best baseball allows peo
ple to truly figure out their ap
proach, how they should go about
playing mentally. I think this kind
of stretch will really help us going
forward to the playoffs, and hope
fully to the College World Series.
TSD: Talk a little bit about that
19-6 win at Cal on Monday. It
must've felt pretty good to get a
bunch of crooked numbers up on
the scoreboard again.
ES: When we were at Arizona,
and even at Washington a little
bit, we kind of had our bats cool
off a little bit. But having a game

like that where we scored 19 runs
and everyone's getting hits, every
one's getting RBIs and every
one's hitting the ball hard, it's just
a huge confidence boost and it re
ally just goes back to, "Oh, this is
the type of team we are." We're
the type of team that's going to
put up monster numbers at the
plate and score tons of runs every
game. I think that's what we just
got back to and we kind of started
getting our confidence back a lit
tle bit, which is real nice to see.
TSD: Looking forward, where do
you see the most room for im
provement for yourself, and for
the team as a whole?
ES: For myself, I think it's to try to
develop better as a catcher. I do
everything I can to help the pitch
ing staff and to help the team win,
whether it's catching or hitting or
doing whatever I can. As a team, I
think this stretch that we've had
between USC, Arizona and
Washington we won four
games in that stretch, and I think
that stretch really gives us a kick
start, a little reality shock, which is
never a bad thing.
Monday really showed that we
got back to our basics and back to
our roots as the talented team
that we are. I think that if we just
maintain the same plate ap
proach, plate discipline and level
of enjoyment of playing every
day, I think we'll be good going
forward.
TSD: Lastly, you have the Oregon
Ducks coming to town this week
end. The series in Eugene a year
ago was really back and forth,
with both teams getting a come
back win. What do you think is the
key to pulling out the series this
weekend?
ES: They're a real good team.
They just took two out of three at
UCLA, a top-10 team at the time.
This is going to be a really good
test for us, but it's like that every
weekend in the Pac-12. It will be
nice to get back home and play in
front of our fans again.
I think one of the big keys will
be doing what we've been doing
all year, throwing strikes and
playing good defense, because a
team like Oregon will really hurt
you if you make too many defen
sive and pitching mistakes. As far
as offense goes, I just think we
need to carry the momentum that
we had from Saturday's game at
Washington and from Cal on
Monday, just carry that forward
to this weekend.
