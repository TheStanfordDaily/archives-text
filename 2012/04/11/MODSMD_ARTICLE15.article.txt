# Mosbacher Minute
## Have Stanford's bats come back to life? 
### JACK MOSBACHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of
the Stanford baseball team from
2008-2011. Each week, he'll take a
look at the Cardinal's ups and
downs on its road to the College
World Series.
For a few sweet hours on Mon
day night, things appeared to be
back to normal. In a 19-6 shellack
ing in Berkeley against the Califor
nia Golden Bears, the No. 6 Stan
ford men's baseball team returned
to its early season form, scoring
runs in bunches and making a
mockery of opposing pitching.
The previous weekend, howev
er, this same Stanford squad bare
ly pulled out a series victory over
unranked Washington to inch one
game closer to .500 in Pac-12 play.
Indeed, since conference competi
tion began, Stanford's highly tout
ed offense has been largely silent.
Will last night's breakout mark a
return to offensive dominance or
prove an aberration in a brutal
long-term slump?
In the lead-up to the season,

pundits around the country con
sidered Stanford's offensive lineup
one of the most talented in college
baseball. In the early season, Stan
ford's bats didn't disappoint, dis
playing power and poise from the
top of the lineup to the bottom.
Based on the Cardinal's brilliant
performance at the plate to start
the year, it was hard to imagine the
team losing more than 10 games
this season.
Stanford started the year by
lighting up the then-No. 5 Rice
pitching staff like the Fourth of
July after also dominating perenni
al powerhouses Vanderbilt, Texas
and Fresno State. It wasn't just that
the Cardinal could mash; it seemed
that every game, a new part of the
lineup was out-producing the oth
ers. It was a lineup with no obvious
weaknesses and eight or nine obvi
ous strengths.
However, since Pac-12 play
began, the Cardinal bats have gone
cold. This past weekend, as Stan
ford barely stole two of three
against a marginal conference op
ponent, the Card continued to
struggle to put runs on the board.
Since conference play began, this
has been a vastly less intimidating
incarnation of a team that won
four convincing series to open the
season.
Let's consider the statistics for
moment. Stanford has started the
Pac-12 season hitting just .250 as
a team and is trailing its oppo
nents in nearly every relevant of
fensive category. They have
struck out 52 times in just nine
conference games and mustered
a measly team on-base percentage
of just .291.
In short, the offense has more
than struggled; since league play
began, it's been straight-up bad.
Pardon the tacky metaphor, but
this slump hasn't just hit a few
branches of the Stanford baseball
tree it has started at the roots
and spread through the entire or
ganism. This offensive nosedive is

almost entirely responsible for
Stanford's underwhelming 4-5
conference record.
Now, hitting consistently in the
Pac-12 is difficult for a variety of
reasons. First, the Pac-12 is one of
the country's most talented con
ferences, arguably only surpassed
by the brutal SEC. Second, the
Pac-12's strength has historically
been its pitching. Since 2006, a
whopping 11 Pac-12 pitchers have
been selected in the first round of
the Major League Baseball draft.
Put simply, hitting in the Pac-12 is
harder than hitting just about any
where.
More importantly, this Stan
ford team is in a portion of the sea
son that begs for underperfor
mance, particularly at the plate.
After playing four high profile se
ries against some of the country's
best programs, the Stanford play
ers took 10 days off from competi
tion to complete their final exams.
Although 10 days might not sound
like a long time, for a hitter, 10 days
off is an eternity. The Cardinal has
obviously lost its early-season
rhythm and swagger at the plate

and is struggling mightily to re
claim some semblance of its for
mer self.
That's the bad news. The good
news is the slump might be over.
Sure, Cal's pitching staff was run
ning on fumes Monday night after
its series at USC this past week
end, but there is no denying that
Stanford's hitters looked more
patient and more confident than
they have for weeks. Most impor
tantly, the case of over-anxious
ness at the plate that has plagued
the team recently was nowhere to
be found.
This team is too talented and
too competitive to stay down on
the mat after taking a few punches.
As Stanford's lineup continues to
pile up at-bats and learn from its
struggles, I have no doubt that the
offense will return to its previous
form. As Monday's game proves,
these guys can turn on the fire
works at any moment. It's not a
matter of if, but when they catch
fire again.
