# STARTING SLOW
## CARDINAL FALLS 12-9 AT DENVER 
### SARAH MAISEL STAFF WRITER 
A slow offensive start coupled
with a slew of turnovers caused
the Stanford women's lacrosse
team to drop its matchup against
Denver last Saturday, registering
its first conference loss of the sea
son. With the loss, the Cardinal
falls to 1-1 in Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) play
and 3-8 overall.
Denver (10-1, 4-0), which has
not lost a game since its season
opener against Johns Flopkins,
proved from the opening whistle
that it will be a serious contender
to break Stanford's streak of
seven consecutive MPSF champi
onships come tournament play on
April 27. The Pioneers roared into
the first period, scoring six unan
swered goals in under 14 minutes.
Senior Emilie Boeri finally
broke through for the Cardinal on
an assist from classmate Maria
Fortino and then again on a free
position shot in the same minute
to put Stanford on the board.
Boeri then provided the assist to
freshman Emily Newstrom, who
cut the lead to three with just over
13 minutes to play in the period.
After being held scoreless for al
most eight minutes, Denver fresh
man Jill Remenapp found the
back of the net to end Stanford's
3-0 run. Both teams traded goals
once more before the Cardinal en
tered the break behind 8-4.
Stanford found itself in anoth
er quick deficit to start the second
period. After a goal by Fortino,
the Pioneers scored three times in
as many minutes to lead 11-5.
Freshmen Kyle Fraser and New
strom scored to keep Stanford in
the game, but Denver scored
again to pull ahead 12-7. Emilie
Boeri quickly shot back with a
goal of her own off an assist from
sister Anna Boeri, but the oppos
ing defense quashed whatever of
fensive momentum remained
until senior Catherine Swanson
scored one final time in the final
four minutes of the game. Despite
its late efforts, the Cardinal could
not claw back from its early deficit
and fell 12-9.
Stanford committed 25
turnovers to Denver's 15, and the
Pioneers capitalized on the un

forced errors. Although the Cardi
nal won nine of 13 draw controls in
the first period, it quickly turned
the ball over, allowing Denver to
drive back down the field and
score. These lost opportunities
cost Stanford, as it was outshot 17-
9 in the period. Denver junior
Kate Henrich, who leads the na
tion with 3.1 caused turnovers per
game, added six more to her sea
son tally as she helped the Pio
neers' defense shut down the Car
dinal. The second half was a closer
matchup statistically, but the Pio
neers won more draw controls,
committed fewer turnovers and
attempted more shots than the
Card.
Stanford, which comes home

to play at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium
for the first time in over a month,
faces another difficult conference
opponent in Oregon (9-4,4-0) on
Friday. The Ducks currently sit
atop the MPSF standings, winning
their most recent game against
UC-Davis 16-13. Stanford's de
fense will have to provide an an
swer to sophomores Shannon
Propst and Nikki Puszcz, who lead
the team with 23 and 25 goals, re
spectively, and a combined 26 as
sists.
More importantly, Stanford
will have to solve its own first peri
od woes. The Cardinal has proven
that it can compete with the na
