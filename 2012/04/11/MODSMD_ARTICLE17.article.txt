# Believing in another Maples moment
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
What is your favorite Maples Pavilion
moment? I bet you're scanning your
memory for a game-winning three that
capped off an improbable comeback
hoops victory over Cal. Or you're re
membering one of the NCAA tournament games that
catalyzed one of five consecutive Final Four runs for the
women's team.
My favorite moment? It may surprise you.
I'm a hoops fan through and through. That will never
change, I've chronicled my longing desire to witness Stan
ford basketball dominance, but I've come to accept that I
was recruited as a student during a rebuilding phase. This
isn't to say that the court hasn't provided its fair share of
excitement; it's just that for every one step forward, there
seem to be three tumover-prone steps back.
Flowever, the hardwood did its job for me in 2010,
when the Stanford men's volleyball team took destiny on

a date and eventually wifed her up. On May 8, Maples was
the loudest it's been in the new millennium, as the Card
captured a national title on its home floor, a feat rare in
any sport.
I'm absolutely nothing more than a casual volleyball
fan. I know more about the sport than the average stu
dent, but the rules only began making sense when I ar
rived on campus. My high school fielded an expansion
team of sorts during my senior year, but it was more of a
"you've played beach volleyball twice so congrats, you're
the starting middle blocker" kind of group than anything
resembling a legitimate varsity squad.
But here I am, making the case that a relatively un
known team in a relatively unfamiliar sport has a legiti
mate chance to repeat the magic from two seasons ago.
It's not an easy argument to make the talent level at

the top of the national rankings is un
paralleledâ€” but it's one that de
serves attention, which it has yet to re
ceive.
In 2010, Stanford was loaded at
every position, but none more so
than outside hitter. Every match was
a kill fest, and the Maples floor is un
doubtedly still dented from the
strikes of Evan Romero, Spencer
McLachlin and Brad Lawson. Per
haps the unsung hero of that match,
and of the entire championship
campaign, was then-sophomore
libera Erik Shoji. Now a senior,
Shoji ranks fifth in the nation in digs
per set, and the only reason he isn't
higher is because of the quality play
of his surrounding teammates. Plus,
he has a highlight reel that boasts
one of the most ridiculous plays
you'll ever see a kill-preventing
dig with his foot that was also a near
perfect set. It's hard to appreciate
the role of libera, as defense isn't
what packs stadiums. But Shoji, a
three-time All-American, may be
the most skilled player on the squad.
What's more surprising is the
emergence of senior setter Evan
Barry, who earned a starting role
once Kawika Shoji, Erik's brother,
graduated following the 2010 sea
son. Barry had enormous shoes to fill
but has arguably become the best
setter in America, leading the nation
with 11.88 assists per set. His passing
ability has enabled guys like Lawson
and sophomore Brian Cook to rank
among the top 20 outside hitters in
Division I.
To say this team is full of invalu
able, unsung heroes is a gross under
statement. With a slew of other veter
ans, including senior middle blocker
Gus Ellis, this team may rival the one
assembled in 2010 in terms of poten
tial.The only problem is that the com
petitive balance across the nation has
also improved. There are currently
five teams, Stanford included,within a
game of the top spot in the MPSF.
Seeding for the conference tourna
ment is crucial, especially considering
the Cardinal's home court advantage.
The gentlemen of Kappa Alpha,
as much of a spectacle as they are, are
among the most passionate, knowl
edgeable and intimidating fans in the
country. If Stanford is able to secure
a road to the national semifinals that

travels through Palo Alto with those
guys along the sidelines, the Cardinal
is in pretty good shape. I've never
tried competing at an elite level with
relentless opposing fans dressed as
cavemen and stormtroopers just a
few feet away, but I can't imagine it's
very fun.
With the aforementioned parity,
I'd be foolish to make any guaran
tees. After all, as a novice supporter,
I can't even pretend to accurately
break down the competition. What I
can do is recognize that all the pieces
that were in place in 2010 seem to be
there again, which means that if I'm
putting my eggs in one team's basket
this spring, I'm going with men's vol
leyball.
If you're searching for a similar
Maples moment, you should, too.

Zach Zimmerman was home for
break when Stanford women's bas
ketball ended UConn's 90-game
winning streak, but he imagines
that was epic, too. Share your fa
