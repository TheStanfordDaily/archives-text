## Chaparral diversifies for funding Humor magazine seeks new route to garner student support for special fees 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Chaparral, the campus
humor magazine founded in 1899, has not re
ceived special fees from students for the past
two years. While the group has benefited
from alternative sources of funding, co-edi
tor-in-chief Sam Coggeshall 'l2 says the pub
lication is expanding its services in an at
tempt to receive special fees funding this
year.
"We wanted to show that love was not just
about soft music and dinners but about
laughter, too," said Coggeshall in reference
to this year's Valentine's Day event "Black
Love," for which The Chaparral hosted co
median Kevin Avery.
The collaboration was part of an in
creased promotional effort from the publica
tion after failing to secure special fees for two
years in a row. Last year, it was one of two
campus groups that did not receive special
fees.
In order to secure special fees funding this
year, the publication has been employing
new strategies, including helping to host
comedy events on campus.
In addition to the "Black Love" event, the
magazine partnered with the Jewish Student
Association (JSA) to bring comedian Dan
Mintz to campus in November last year.
"This is part of our efforts to broaden
readership and presence," Coggeshall said.
"We are trying to get our name out there
by bringing more than the magazine to
campus."
According to Coggeshall, The Chapar
ral's strong support from alumni, including
some who write for popular television se
ries such as "The Simpsons" and "The Of
fice," enables it to bring guest comedians to
campus.
Tlie publication plans to host similar
events this quarter.
Although content changes were not part
of the publication's new strategy, the group
employed other methods, such as increasing
distribution, hosting open houses, experi
menting with new art designs and updating
its website.
Coggeshall attributed the loss of special
fees in part to the change in the voting system
in 2010.
According to Coggeshall, instead of
choosing which student groups not to vote
for, a new voting procedure was introduced
last year in which students had to select the
student groups that they specifically wanted
to receive special fees.
"Our presence just was not big enough,"
Coggeshall said. "Not everyone knows what
the Chappie is. Our humor may not necessar
ily be for everyone, but we feel that if more
people were aware of us they would enjoy
