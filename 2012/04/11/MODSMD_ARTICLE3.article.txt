## Politics damaging liberal education, study says 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
A recent study by the California
Association of Scholars has opened a
vigorous debate among professors
about the meaning of a liberal educa
tion: Is a liberal education about
learning all sides of the argument or
should it lean more toward student ac
tivism? The debate also touches on
whether party affiliation of professors
affects the traditional educational en
vironment.

Stanford Hoover Senior Fellow
Peter Berkowitz responded to the
study in a March 30 op-ed in the Wall
Street Journal, stating that the politi
cal affiliations of faculty members mo
tivates them to focus more on teaching
students to become agents of social
changes at the expense of focusing on

coursework that is faltering in quality.
The study reads, "When individual
faculty members and sometimes even
whole departments decide that their
aim is to advance social justice as they
understand it rather than to teach the
subject that they were hired to teach
with all the analytical skill that they
can muster, the quality of teaching and
research is compromised."
Robert Anderson, UC-Berkeley
economics and math professor and
chairman of the system-wide Academ
ic Senate, said that the study puts for
ward a lot of allegations that are not
supported by the facts presented, be
cause its main claim is that faculty
members' leftward political leanings
decrease the quality of undergraduate
education.
