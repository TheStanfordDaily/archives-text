## Politics damaging liberal education, study says 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
A recent study by the California
Association of Scholars has opened a
vigorous debate among professors
about the meaning of a liberal educa
tion: Is a liberal education about
learning all sides of the argument or
should it lean more toward student ac
tivism? The debate also touches on
whether party affiliation of professors
affects the traditional educational en
vironment.

Stanford Hoover Senior Fellow
Peter Berkowitz responded to the
study in a March 30 op-ed in the Wall
Street Journal, stating that the politi
cal affiliations of faculty members mo
tivates them to focus more on teaching
students to become agents of social
changes at the expense of focusing on

coursework that is faltering in quality.
The study reads, "When individual
faculty members and sometimes even
whole departments decide that their
aim is to advance social justice as they
understand it rather than to teach the
subject that they were hired to teach
with all the analytical skill that they
can muster, the quality of teaching and
research is compromised."
Robert Anderson, UC-Berkeley
economics and math professor and
chairman of the system-wide Academ
ic Senate, said that the study puts for
ward a lot of allegations that are not
supported by the facts presented, be
cause its main claim is that faculty
members' leftward political leanings
decrease the quality of undergraduate
education.

"I think the study as a matter
of social science is completely
flawed because the fact that two
things happen simultaneously
does not imply that one causes
the other," Anderson said. "The
only real evidence they provide
is that the party registration of
faculty is significantly leaning to
wards Democrats."
Anderson said that party affili
ation is not something he sees as a
factor in hiring faculty because it
would violate Article IX, Section
9 of the California State Constitu
tion, which reads, "The university
shall be entirely independent of
all political or sectarian influence
and kept free therefrom."
Anderson added that the rea
son for such a significant Demo
cratic presence among faculty has
to do with democratic ideals.
"It's people who are more con
cerned with increasing the welfare
of the society in general who tend
to be Democrats and who would
most likely go into university
teaching," Anderson said.
"While political affiliation
alone need not carry classroom
implications, the overwhelming
ly left-leaning faculty openly de
clare the inculcation of progres
sive political ideas their peda
gogical priority," Berkowitz
wrote.
He wrote that the study
brings attention to why profes
sors must avoid introducing dis
cussion opinions extraneous to
the subject to provide a well
rounded treatment of the matter
under consideration.
"That opens the classroom to
whatever professors wish to talk
about," Berkowitz wrote. "And
in all too many cases what they
wish to talk about in the class
room is the need to transform
America in a progressive direc
tion."
However, Jeff Chang, execu
tive director of Stanford's Insti
tute for Diversity in the Arts, said
allowing for students to gain
tools for becoming agents of
change is part of what a liberal
education can provide.
"Liberal education is an edu
cation in which people are ex
posed to many different kinds of
viewpoints and get to think criti
cally about themselves in society,
and they get to ask the big ques
tions of the world," Chang said.
"If you challenge some kind of
information and points of view,

that inspires you to think deeper
about where you stand in rela
tionship to those particular posi
tions."
Chang also said that political
expression on behalf of the stu
dents as agents of change does
not conflict with their academic
environment.
"Often action and activism is
a natural outgrowth of this
thought process that's been en
gendered in the education
process," Chang said. "People
can argue that any kind of politi
cal activity is sectarian, and I
think that would be too narrow
and literal a reading of that par
ticular section of the [State] Con
stitution."
Chang currently leads the Oc
cupy Art class series at Stanford
that explores the shifting mean
ings of the term "occupation."
"It's a direct way of being
able to have students talk about
big ideas with events that are
happening at this particular mo
ment, and it's away for students
to engage with and find connec
tions to debate with, to have ar
guments with, social movements
that are rising up," Chang said.
Anderson said that he agrees
with Chang's idea of the role of
political expression on a campus
with liberal education as its
model.
"I think the goal of a liberal
education is to expose undergrad
uates to a wide variety of disci
plines to help them concentrate in
one of those to become a knowl
edgeable citizen of the United
States," Anderson said. "Part of
being a good citizen is to be aware
of the current political and social
issues in your country."
