## Aesthetics and emotions drive successful design 
### AARON SEKHRI 
In a series of remarks dominated by anec
dotes and observations of the actions of com
panies that create successful products, Pro
fessor Emeritus James Adams supported his
supposition that, when it comes to design,
"emotions lead rather than follow."
On Monday afternoon, in the industrial
atrium of the Hasso Plattner Institute of De
sign (d.school), Mechanical Engineering
Prof. David Beach sat down with Adams to
discuss Adams' book, "Good Products, Bad
Products," and to reflect on the eponymous
course that Adams taught for over 20 years
at Stanford.
Speaking in front of a crowd composed
mainly of faculty and graduate students, the
two academics touched on the nature of
good design, with an emphasis on quality as
the defining factor in the success and
longevity of products.
Adams began the discussion by noting
how alien his design methodology and phi

losophy was at the time he first started teach
ing at Stanford during the mid-19605. The
predominant thinking at the time, he ex
plained, was to quantify quality and reject
any standard that was not immediately
measurable.
Adams' deviation from this standard, in
stead focusing on "qualitative quality cours
es," represented a major shift in the approach
of design. Beach labeled this divergence the
"intellectual core of our enterprise," Despite
admitting that such an understanding of
quality is "monumentally slippery," Adams
asserted that, without such intuitions, the
essence of good product design is lost be
cause of his hypothesis that "quality is funda
mentally a product of emotion."
Beach chimed in, saying that, "We may
think we are making rational decisions about
what products we buy or what products we
admire, but in fact probably the stronger
driving forces have something to do with our
