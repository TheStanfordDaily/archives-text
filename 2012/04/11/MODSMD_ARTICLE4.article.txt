## Aesthetics and emotions drive successful design 
### AARON SEKHRI 
In a series of remarks dominated by anec
dotes and observations of the actions of com
panies that create successful products, Pro
fessor Emeritus James Adams supported his
supposition that, when it comes to design,
"emotions lead rather than follow."
On Monday afternoon, in the industrial
atrium of the Hasso Plattner Institute of De
sign (d.school), Mechanical Engineering
Prof. David Beach sat down with Adams to
discuss Adams' book, "Good Products, Bad
Products," and to reflect on the eponymous
course that Adams taught for over 20 years
at Stanford.
Speaking in front of a crowd composed
mainly of faculty and graduate students, the
two academics touched on the nature of
good design, with an emphasis on quality as
the defining factor in the success and
longevity of products.
Adams began the discussion by noting
how alien his design methodology and phi

losophy was at the time he first started teach
ing at Stanford during the mid-19605. The
predominant thinking at the time, he ex
plained, was to quantify quality and reject
any standard that was not immediately
measurable.
Adams' deviation from this standard, in
stead focusing on "qualitative quality cours
es," represented a major shift in the approach
of design. Beach labeled this divergence the
"intellectual core of our enterprise," Despite
admitting that such an understanding of
quality is "monumentally slippery," Adams
asserted that, without such intuitions, the
essence of good product design is lost be
cause of his hypothesis that "quality is funda
mentally a product of emotion."
Beach chimed in, saying that, "We may
think we are making rational decisions about
what products we buy or what products we
admire, but in fact probably the stronger
driving forces have something to do with our

ego, our sensory experience, cul
tural stimuli and the overall emo
tional response."
The challenge at the time,
Adams argued, was communicat
ing this to a group of mechanical
engineers, a group whose quanti
tative inclinations left them hesi
tant to adopt such an approach.
The solution, Adams repeat
edly noted, was a firm grasp of
aesthetic appreciation. He credit
ed his year at the UCLA School of
Art and Architecture, which took
place after a "calculus-obsessed
undergraduate degree at Cal
tech," as the most important edu
cational experience of his life.
"Aesthetics was the game,"
Adams reflected. "And it got me
thinking differently."
Adams argued that what he
learned in his single year at
UCLA "sensitized [him] to aes
thetics."
"Any young engineer should
go to art school for a year," he
said.
Adams also pointed out that
creative endeavors have innate
risk.
"The higher the level of cre
ativity," Adams said, "the higher
the level of risk."

He emphasized the need to
find balance between creative
design and functional design,
which he grounded in the most
fundamental needs a consumer
will have of the product in ques
tion.
Echoing the interdisciplinary
ethos of Stanford's d.school,
Adams touted the diversity of ac
ademic interests of the students
he taught over the years and re
flected on the future of the course,
now led by Beach, and the
d.school itself.
In response to an audience
question about the role of high
technology tools detracting from
the design process, Adams assert
ed, "Digital tools in manufactur
ing are a source of excitement and
energy."
The event, with a generally
positive reception, was followed
by an informal chat session.
Sanjay Dastoor, a Ph.D. candi
date in mechanical engineering
who took the course Good Prod
ucts, Bad Products several years
ago, remarked, "I am involved in a
company now where we are mak
ing a tangible product, and I still
draw on my experience from the
class."
"It was a great talk," Dastoor
continued. "James Adams was
definitely a great teacher."

go to art school for a year," he
said.
Adams also pointed out that
creative endeavors have innate
risk.
"The higher the level of cre
ativity," Adams said, "the higher
the level of risk."

He emphasized the need to
find balance between creative
design and functional design,
which he grounded in the most
fundamental needs a consumer
will have of the product in ques
tion.
Echoing the interdisciplinary
ethos of Stanford's d.school,
Adams touted the diversity of ac
ademic interests of the students
he taught over the years and re
flected on the future of the course,
now led by Beach, and the
d.school itself.
In response to an audience
question about the role of high
technology tools detracting from
the design process, Adams assert
ed, "Digital tools in manufactur
ing are a source of excitement and
energy."
The event, with a generally
positive reception, was followed
by an informal chat session.
Sanjay Dastoor, a Ph.D. candi
date in mechanical engineering
who took the course Good Prod
ucts, Bad Products several years
ago, remarked, "I am involved in a
company now where we are mak
ing a tangible product, and I still
draw on my experience from the
class."
"It was a great talk," Dastoor
continued. "James Adams was
definitely a great teacher."
