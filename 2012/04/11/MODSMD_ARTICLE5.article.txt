## Senators address campaign finance 'mess' 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
In its regular Tuesday meeting, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate approved next year's
ASSU Financial Manager and appointed a
new member to the Constitutional Council.
The senators also settled their muddled
three-week debate surrounding the distribu
tion of public campaign financing and the ex
istence of a campaign spending cap.
The senators approved Ireri Hernandez
'l5, nominated by current ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2, to serve on the Constitu

tional Council. Hernandez served as a chair
on her high school student council. Though
she said she has yet to read the ASSU Consti
tution, she was appointed unanimously to the
post.
Due to conflicting records and informa
tion from senators, Elections Commissioner
Adam Adler 'l2 has, over the past three
weeks, disseminated sometimes conflicting
information to students running for the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate and the Grad
uate Student Council (GSC) concerning a
spending cap on campaigns.
"It wasn't at all clear which bill was con

trolling in terms of the spending caps and
public financing," Adler said. "There were
probably four or five different versions of the
bill that I saw ... There was no clear docu
mentation supporting which one passed and
which didn't pass."
He noted that the bills that were passed by
this year's Senate might conflict with regula
tions passed in 2009. Several senators charac
terized the situation as "a mess."
Adler said that the Elections Commission
will not be enforcing spending caps this elec-
