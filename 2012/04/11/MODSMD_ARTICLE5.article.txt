## Senators address campaign finance 'mess' 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
In its regular Tuesday meeting, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate approved next year's
ASSU Financial Manager and appointed a
new member to the Constitutional Council.
The senators also settled their muddled
three-week debate surrounding the distribu
tion of public campaign financing and the ex
istence of a campaign spending cap.
The senators approved Ireri Hernandez
'l5, nominated by current ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2, to serve on the Constitu

tional Council. Hernandez served as a chair
on her high school student council. Though
she said she has yet to read the ASSU Consti
tution, she was appointed unanimously to the
post.
Due to conflicting records and informa
tion from senators, Elections Commissioner
Adam Adler 'l2 has, over the past three
weeks, disseminated sometimes conflicting
information to students running for the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate and the Grad
uate Student Council (GSC) concerning a
spending cap on campaigns.
"It wasn't at all clear which bill was con

trolling in terms of the spending caps and
public financing," Adler said. "There were
probably four or five different versions of the
bill that I saw ... There was no clear docu
mentation supporting which one passed and
which didn't pass."
He noted that the bills that were passed by
this year's Senate might conflict with regula
tions passed in 2009. Several senators charac
terized the situation as "a mess."
Adler said that the Elections Commission
will not be enforcing spending caps this elec-
tion cycle.
Adler also reported that the
extension that the Senate ap
proved last week for candidates
who missed the public financing
deadline will not have its intended
effect, since only one of the seven
exempted students submitted a
budget by the new deadline.
Senators emphasized the im
portance of confidentiality for
public financing applicants and ex
pressed hope that future Senates
and Election Commissions will
learn from the messy execution of
this year's program. The body then
approved public financing for the
total four Senate candidates who
submitted budgets.
With only 21 candidates re
maining in the race, Ben Laufer
'l2 and Janani Ramachandran 'l4
expressed disappointed that the
offer of public campaign financing

did not encourage more students
to run.
The senators concluded their
debate over the reappointment of
Neveen Mahmoud 'll as ASSU Fi
nancial Manager and CEO of Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE).
Although several senators had
voiced concerns last week over the
performance of SSE and Mah
moud's leadership, they unani
mously approved her appointment
following her responses to their
questions over the past week.
"I'm quite pleased that Neveen
... put some time and thought
into this response to email," lan
Chan 'l4 said in support of her
candidacy. "A lot of things ... are
outside of her immediate control
and they're working on [them],
and I'm pretty confident that she
is aware of the issues that we've
been talking about for the past
couple of months and will do a
good job."
With their terms coming to a
close, the senators discussed the
transition to the 14th Senate,
which will be elected on Thursday

and Friday. They agreed to plan a
transition retreat, establish a men
toring relationship between out
going and incoming members. The
current Senate will have its last
meeting during week five of the
quarter.
Cruz and Senate Chair Rafael
Vazquez 'l2 both noted that next
year's ASSU budget must be ap
proved by the current Senate, The
GSC and Senate will hold a joint
legislative meeting next week to
discuss the budget. The senators
entertained the possibility of can
celing their weekly meeting for
next week but decided against it
when several, including Laufer
and Chan, suggested that having a
regular meeting is important for
teaching new senators about the
structure of meetings.
"Unlike last year... I think
we should really focus on the tran
sition, because they have a lot to
learn and we have a lot to teach
them," said Alon Elhanan 'l4.

close, the senators discussed the
transition to the 14th Senate,
which will be elected on Thursday

transition retreat, establish a men
toring relationship between out
going and incoming members. The
current Senate will have its last
meeting during week five of the
quarter.
Cruz and Senate Chair Rafael
Vazquez 'l2 both noted that next
year's ASSU budget must be ap
proved by the current Senate, The
GSC and Senate will hold a joint
legislative meeting next week to
discuss the budget. The senators
entertained the possibility of can
celing their weekly meeting for
next week but decided against it
when several, including Laufer
and Chan, suggested that having a
regular meeting is important for
teaching new senators about the
structure of meetings.
"Unlike last year... I think
we should really focus on the tran
sition, because they have a lot to
learn and we have a lot to teach
them," said Alon Elhanan 'l4.
