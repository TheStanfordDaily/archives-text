## SoFiloans popular with GSB Social financing loans offered, by alumni to GSB students 
### ROBERTO VARGAS 
With the U.S. Department of Edu
cation's recent finding that approxi
mately 9 percent of student loans are
in default, and in response to a grow
ing $1 trillion market, Social Finance,
Inc. (SoFi) has stepped in.
"It was really an opportune time to
intersect social and finance," said
Mike Cagney, SoFi CEO, of taking a
different approach to financial servic
es.
Cagney elaborated that SoFi ad
dresses the need for students to meet
their financial commitments at a rea
sonable interest rate. The business is
structured around raising funds from
alumni and dispersing them to current
students, creating both a financial and
social return.
At Stanford, SoFi originally chose
to target the Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB), where about 65 percent
of graduate students borrow funds.
SoFi raised approximately $2 million
from 40 alumni and dispersed the
funds to students. The approval
process for the loans was similar to
that of a standard loan, requiring a
credit check and some background in
formation.
A major draw of the program is the
vested interest that financiers have in
the students themselves as well as the
potential for alumni mentoring and
interaction. Although SoFi does not
provide direct one-on-one financing,
many students and alumni have taken
advantage of SoFi's online network
ing platform to form a social commu
nity, according to Cagney.
Another appeal of SoFi lies in the
numbers. SoFi's loans provide funds
at a fixed interest rate of 6.24 percent,
which is very competitive with other
financing options. Students generally
take advantage of a low interest of ap
proximately 4 percent for federal
Perkins loans, but they are often left
with a debt gap that they must address
at a later time. The Stafford loan is an
example of an option that students
might turn to, offered at 6.8 percent.
Compared to SoFi's 6.24 percent
interest rate (which can be lowered to
5.99 percent for students using an au
tomatic payment option), these loans
are much less attractive and burden
some.
Benjamin Kessler, a current user of
SoFi finance, praised the company.
"Compared to other student loan
programs, it's far and away the best"
with regards to the mutual benefits of
the loan as well as the fixed interest
rates, Kessler said.
Kessler is part of the SoFi
pilot program that has prospered
at Stanford. The pilot program
worked with a group of 100 GSB
students. The company plans to
run refinancing programs at
other elite institutions such as
Harvard, MIT, Kellogg Business
School and Wharton during the
next few months and hopes to ex
pand to 40 schools over the next
year.
