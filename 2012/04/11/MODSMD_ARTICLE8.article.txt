# NEWS BRIEF
## Stegner Fellows announced 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Mary Ann Toman-Miller 
The English Department an
nounced its ten Stegner Fellowship
recipients for poetry and fiction
last week. Each year Stanford's
Creative Writing Program offers
two-year fellowships that provide
a living stipend of $26,000. Recipi
ents commit to full-time academic
activity, although the program
does not confer degrees. Fellows
are seen as working artists who are
practicing and improving their
skills. No specific academic back
ground is required.
This year's winners for poetry
are Kimberly Grey, Christopher
Kempf, Hugh Martin, Jacques J.
Rancourt and Solmaz Sharif. The
new fiction fellows are NoViolet
Bulawayo, Nicole Cullen, Lydia
Fitzpatrick, Austin Smith and
Monique Wentzelis.

Over 1,700 applicants from
ages 22 to 75 applied for the fel
lowship award.
Wallace Stegner founded the
fellowship and The Stanford Cre
ative Writing Program in 1946.
Stegner, known as the "dean of
Western writers" aimed to create
a community of writers to discuss
and support one another's work.
The goal of the fellowship is for
each fellow to have completed a
publishable manuscript by the
end of the two years at Stanford.
Fellows also act as writing men
tors to undergraduates in the
Levinthal Tutorials and the Writ
ers Studio.
Ken Kelsey worked on One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest dur
ing his time at Stanford through a
Stegner Fellowship. While fellows
are in residence, there are no cur
riculum requirements other than
workshop attendance and writing
projects. Stanford faculty members
help guide the recipients' work.
