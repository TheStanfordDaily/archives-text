## Frost Amphitheater revived 
### LUCAS OSWALD 
At the heart of campus,
there lies a hidden sloping
field of wide grassy steps
surrounded by verdant
vegetation so tall and
thick that if it weren't for the distinc
tive Hoover Tower nearby, you
might forget you are in the center of
Stanford's campus.
The 20-acre field narrows slightly
as it dips into a stone uprising at its
bottom, where musical performanc
es take place. This outdoor arena is
known as Laurence Frost Amphithe
ater, and strangely enough, hardly
anything has been played from its
stage in the last two decades.
Frost wasn't always silent, howev
er. As many current Stanford stu
dents now lament, it was once the an
nual stomping ground of the Grate
ful Dead, just one of many popular
bands to visit the amphitheater. But
the frequent visits of The Dead caravan
were not Frost's only highlight.
The amphitheater was built in 1935 with
funds donated by the parents of John Laurence Frost
'35, who died of polio soon after his graduation from
Stanford. From 1938 to 1984, it served as the location for
Stanford's commencement ceremonies.

"All of my commencement exercises were held
there," recalled Steve Stathatos '74. "It was an ideal time
of year for the venue warm weather and all the foliage
in full display. As I recall, various flowering trees like
cherry and apple surrounded the place, and red and
white roses bloomed around the stage."
Although the amphitheater was originally used only
for University ceremonies, it soon found use as a concert
venue for jazz artists and classical productions. Duke
Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald played together at Frost for
students, as well Louis Armstrong and even Miles Davis.
As popular music shifted genres in the late 19605, Frost
was visited by a new era of musicians. On May 71967, Jef
ferson Airplane became the first major rock band to per
form at Frost, just as they were reaching international star
dom. Many other musicians followed, including Eric Clap
ton, Carlos Santana, Ray Charles and Creedence Clear
water Revival.
The stage was a favorite of the Grateful Dead, who
returned to the venue a total of 12 times. Their contin
ued dedication was due in part to the fact that they
themselves were from the Bay Area, but it has also been
attributed to their fondness for the venue.
Frost Amphitheater is not only surrounded by nature

but is also composed of it; the audience stands on ascend
ing grass flats that curve upward from the performers like
an upturned band shell, creating tremendous acoustic de
livery.
"Frost, at its best, is an unbeatable venue," Stathatos
said.
After an unfortunate turn of events including a motor
cycle gang brawl at an Elvin Bishop concert in 1971, the
venue began its slow cycle into disuse. With the growing
costs of concerts in combination with Frost's lack of infra
structure, fewer and fewer productions were held at Frost
over the years.
Today, Frost is rarely visited. In the last five years, the
only notable performances have been Grammy award
winning bassist Victor Wooten and rapper Mos Def.
However, the silence at Frost will not last long.
On May 19, Stanford will host the Frost Revival Music
and Arts Festival, an all-day event that will fill Frost with
Stanford students and members of the general public.
This seems like an unexpected shift in the University's
mentality toward Frost's use, but according to Stanford
Concert Network (SCN) co-director Alberto Aroeste 'l2,
the Stanford administration is largely supportive of their
efforts.
The lack of infrastructure is still a problem, but with a
lot of work and proper funding, the event will have full fa
cilities and services for performers and guests.

Emily Pol
lock 'l3, SCN co-director, notes that despite the beauty of
Frost, it remains a difficult venue to work with.
"What you see is really what you get a concrete
stage and lawn an awesome environment, but it's hard
to get all of the necessary equipment out there," she said.
The physical set-up of the concert may no longer be an
issue, but Stanford is now more concerned with selling all
6,000 tickets, which will be available to Stanford students
for $2O. But with headliner Modest Mouse and openers
Benjamin Francis Leftwich and Eyes Lips Eyes, it is likely
that the group will have little trouble selling tickets.
"I'm not worried about ticket sales since this event
holds so much intrinsic value to students and the general
public," Aroeste said. "We're very excited to bring back
Frost in a big way and have students experience the venue
some for the first time in the way it was meant to be
experienced."
And what does this mean for the future of Frost?
"We hope that new generations of students and the
general public will start appreciating Frost as SCN and
older generations of Bay Area residents and alumni do,"
Aroeste said.
With this newfound appreciation, perhaps there will be
more than just the sounds of crickets and other wildlife
coming from the amphitheater in coming years.

ton, Carlos Santana, Ray Charles and Creedence Clear
water Revival.
The stage was a favorite of the Grateful Dead, who
returned to the venue a total of 12 times. Their contin
ued dedication was due in part to the fact that they
themselves were from the Bay Area, but it has also been
attributed to their fondness for the venue.
Frost Amphitheater is not only surrounded by nature

but is also composed of it; the audience stands on ascend
ing grass flats that curve upward from the performers like
an upturned band shell, creating tremendous acoustic de
livery.
"Frost, at its best, is an unbeatable venue," Stathatos
said.
After an unfortunate turn of events including a motor
cycle gang brawl at an Elvin Bishop concert in 1971, the
venue began its slow cycle into disuse. With the growing
costs of concerts in combination with Frost's lack of infra
structure, fewer and fewer productions were held at Frost
over the years.
Today, Frost is rarely visited. In the last five years, the
only notable performances have been Grammy award
winning bassist Victor Wooten and rapper Mos Def.
However, the silence at Frost will not last long.
On May 19, Stanford will host the Frost Revival Music
and Arts Festival, an all-day event that will fill Frost with
Stanford students and members of the general public.
This seems like an unexpected shift in the University's
mentality toward Frost's use, but according to Stanford
Concert Network (SCN) co-director Alberto Aroeste 'l2,
the Stanford administration is largely supportive of their
efforts.
The lack of infrastructure is still a problem, but with a
lot of work and proper funding, the event will have full fa
cilities and services for performers and guests.

Emily Pol
lock 'l3, SCN co-director, notes that despite the beauty of
Frost, it remains a difficult venue to work with.
"What you see is really what you get a concrete
stage and lawn an awesome environment, but it's hard
to get all of the necessary equipment out there," she said.
The physical set-up of the concert may no longer be an
issue, but Stanford is now more concerned with selling all
6,000 tickets, which will be available to Stanford students
for $2O. But with headliner Modest Mouse and openers
Benjamin Francis Leftwich and Eyes Lips Eyes, it is likely
that the group will have little trouble selling tickets.
"I'm not worried about ticket sales since this event
holds so much intrinsic value to students and the general
public," Aroeste said. "We're very excited to bring back
Frost in a big way and have students experience the venue
some for the first time in the way it was meant to be
experienced."
And what does this mean for the future of Frost?
"We hope that new generations of students and the
general public will start appreciating Frost as SCN and
older generations of Bay Area residents and alumni do,"
Aroeste said.
With this newfound appreciation, perhaps there will be
more than just the sounds of crickets and other wildlife
coming from the amphitheater in coming years.

At the heart of campus,
there lies a hidden sloping
field of wide grassy steps
surrounded by verdant
vegetation so tall and
thick that if it weren't for the distinc
tive Hoover Tower nearby, you
might forget you are in the center of
Stanford's campus.
The 20-acre field narrows slightly
as it dips into a stone uprising at its
bottom, where musical performanc
es take place. This outdoor arena is
known as Laurence Frost Amphithe
ater, and strangely enough, hardly
anything has been played from its
stage in the last two decades.
Frost wasn't always silent, howev
er. As many current Stanford stu
dents now lament, it was once the an
nual stomping ground of the Grate
ful Dead, just one of many popular
bands to visit the amphitheater. But
the frequent visits of The Dead caravan
were not Frost's only highlight.
The amphitheater was built in 1935 with
funds donated by the parents of John Laurence Frost
'35, who died of polio soon after his graduation from
Stanford. From 1938 to 1984, it served as the location for
Stanford's commencement ceremonies.

"All of my commencement exercises were held
there," recalled Steve Stathatos '74. "It was an ideal time
of year for the venue warm weather and all the foliage
in full display. As I recall, various flowering trees like
cherry and apple surrounded the place, and red and
white roses bloomed around the stage."
Although the amphitheater was originally used only
for University ceremonies, it soon found use as a concert
venue for jazz artists and classical productions. Duke
Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald played together at Frost for
students, as well Louis Armstrong and even Miles Davis.
As popular music shifted genres in the late 19605, Frost
was visited by a new era of musicians. On May 71967, Jef
ferson Airplane became the first major rock band to per
form at Frost, just as they were reaching international star
dom. Many other musicians followed, including Eric Clap
ton, Carlos Santana, Ray Charles and Creedence Clear
water Revival.
