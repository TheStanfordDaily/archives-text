## Tuning in to entrepreneurial thought 
### JANEYOON 
A study conducted by the Uni
versity of Virginia showed
that the average American
spends about five hours a
day with his mind idle. This
includes time spent commuting, exer
cising and getting ready in the morning
valuable time that could be spent
learning. And what better way for stu
dents aspiring to create start-ups than
to learn through a podcast by some of
the world's leading entrepreneurs?
Named by Forbes as one of the best
podcasts, the Stanford Entrepreneurial
Thought Leaders series is a podcast
that promotes innovative thinking.
Evolving from the Entrepreneurial
Thought Leaders' Seminar (MS&E
472), the Stanford Entrepreneurial
Thought Leaders (ETL) podcast first
started in 2001 as short video clips of
guest speakers uploaded to the Stan
ford's Entrepreneurship Corner web
site. In 2005, the full-length lecture
recordings became available, and the
Stanford Entrepreneurial Thought
Leaders Podcasts series was born.
The ETL is now a weekly seminar
series on entrepreneurship, co-spon
sored by venture capital firm Draper
Fisher Jurvetson, BASES and the Stan
ford Technology Ventures Program
(STVP). While mainly targeted at stu
dents interested in entrepreneurship,
the podcast also aims to encourage fac
ulty to think about how entrepreneur
ship should be taught, to prepare edu
cational resources from the high-tech
nology industry for access by the gener
al public and to develop an archive of
digital recordings to provide a network
of resources for entrepreneurship edu
cators. The series features over 2,000
free online videos and podcasts of lead
ers in entrepreneurship and innovation
thought.
Speakers for the podcasts are nomi
nated each quarter and then voted
upon by faculty and students within
STVP and BASES. The speakers come
from a variety of backgrounds, all inter
ested in the technology sector. They are
usually founders or executives in tech
nology companies, venture capitalists
who have invested in a high-technology

startup or authors and philan
thropists whose efforts are fo
cused on high-technology entre
preneurship.
"One of the successes of this
podcast is the diversity of speak
ers we have had so far," said Matt
Harvey, ETL communications
director. "We try to vary the
speakers from background, per
spective and topics."
The podcasts emphasize that
speakers are not only entrepre
neurs in their respective fields,
but also role models to students
in the engineering community.
Past podcast topics have in
cluded start-ups, inspiration for
entrepreneurship, venture capi
tal success and building an entre
preneurial career. They focus on
sharing knowledge that students
feel is critical to impart to new
entrepreneurs.
"The most successful lectures
blend lessons learned about en
trepreneurship and leadership
with engaging stories from the
speaker's career journey to illu
minate these insights," Harvey
said.

Past speakers include: the
founders of Google, Jet Blue and
Yahoo!, venture capitalist John Doerr,
executives from market leaders such as
Cisco and social entrepreneurs from
The Global Fund for Women and
Craigslist
The podcast format of these lectures
has allowed ETL to reach out to a di
verse international audience not only in
higher education, but also reaching lis
teners who tune in purely out of inter
est in entrepreneurship.
"We frequently receive letters from
listeners from around the globe who
thank us for providing them with a
front row seat to the speaker series,"
said Tina Seelig, executive director of
the Stanford Technology Ventures Pro
gram. "They tell us that the content of
these talks has had a profound influ
ence on their lives."
With 98 percent of the previous class
recommending the course to other stu
dents, it is considered a gateway course
into entrepreneurship. Currently, the

ETL is the top iTunes podcast in higher
education with 11 million downloads
since its inception. Each lecture is
broadcast live on SITN channel E2 and
all presentations during the quarter are
archived and made available through
iTunes, Sound Cloud and STVP's En
trepreneurship Corner.
These podcasts show the audience
that entrepreneurship is more than just
starting companies. The speakers talk
about life lessons and insights they have
learned along their entrepreneurial
journeys that can apply to anyone who
is curious and willing to learn.
"The students love the candid na
ture of the talks from the speakers,"
Harvey said. "Even though the class is
being recorded, they feel a sense of
honesty and authenticity from the
speakers. It's a very intimate opportuni
ty to hear from these people in that for
mat."

The podcast format of these lectures
has allowed ETL to reach out to a di
verse international audience not only in
higher education, but also reaching lis
teners who tune in purely out of inter
est in entrepreneurship.
"We frequently receive letters from
listeners from around the globe who
thank us for providing them with a
front row seat to the speaker series,"
said Tina Seelig, executive director of
the Stanford Technology Ventures Pro
gram. "They tell us that the content of
these talks has had a profound influ
ence on their lives."
With 98 percent of the previous class
recommending the course to other stu
dents, it is considered a gateway course
into entrepreneurship. Currently, the

ETL is the top iTunes podcast in higher
education with 11 million downloads
since its inception. Each lecture is
broadcast live on SITN channel E2 and
all presentations during the quarter are
archived and made available through
iTunes, Sound Cloud and STVP's En
trepreneurship Corner.
These podcasts show the audience
that entrepreneurship is more than just
starting companies. The speakers talk
about life lessons and insights they have
learned along their entrepreneurial
journeys that can apply to anyone who
is curious and willing to learn.
"The students love the candid na
ture of the talks from the speakers,"
Harvey said. "Even though the class is
being recorded, they feel a sense of
honesty and authenticity from the
speakers. It's a very intimate opportuni
ty to hear from these people in that for
mat."

A study conducted by the Uni
versity of Virginia showed
that the average American
spends about five hours a
day with his mind idle. This
includes time spent commuting, exer
cising and getting ready in the morning
valuable time that could be spent
learning. And what better way for stu
dents aspiring to create start-ups than
to learn through a podcast by some of
the world's leading entrepreneurs?
Named by Forbes as one of the best
podcasts, the Stanford Entrepreneurial
Thought Leaders series is a podcast
that promotes innovative thinking.
Evolving from the Entrepreneurial
Thought Leaders' Seminar (MS&E
472), the Stanford Entrepreneurial
Thought Leaders (ETL) podcast first
started in 2001 as short video clips of
guest speakers uploaded to the Stan
ford's Entrepreneurship Corner web
site. In 2005, the full-length lecture
recordings became available, and the
Stanford Entrepreneurial Thought
Leaders Podcasts series was born.
The ETL is now a weekly seminar
series on entrepreneurship, co-spon
sored by venture capital firm Draper
Fisher Jurvetson, BASES and the Stan
ford Technology Ventures Program
(STVP). While mainly targeted at stu
dents interested in entrepreneurship,
the podcast also aims to encourage fac
ulty to think about how entrepreneur
ship should be taught, to prepare edu
cational resources from the high-tech
nology industry for access by the gener
al public and to develop an archive of
digital recordings to provide a network
of resources for entrepreneurship edu
cators. The series features over 2,000
free online videos and podcasts of lead
ers in entrepreneurship and innovation
thought.
Speakers for the podcasts are nomi
nated each quarter and then voted
upon by faculty and students within
STVP and BASES. The speakers come
from a variety of backgrounds, all inter
ested in the technology sector. They are
usually founders or executives in tech
nology companies, venture capitalists
who have invested in a high-technology

startup or authors and philan
thropists whose efforts are fo
cused on high-technology entre
preneurship.
"One of the successes of this
podcast is the diversity of speak
ers we have had so far," said Matt
Harvey, ETL communications
director. "We try to vary the
speakers from background, per
spective and topics."
The podcasts emphasize that
speakers are not only entrepre
neurs in their respective fields,
but also role models to students
in the engineering community.
Past podcast topics have in
cluded start-ups, inspiration for
entrepreneurship, venture capi
tal success and building an entre
preneurial career. They focus on
sharing knowledge that students
feel is critical to impart to new
entrepreneurs.
"The most successful lectures
blend lessons learned about en
trepreneurship and leadership
with engaging stories from the
speaker's career journey to illu
minate these insights," Harvey
said.

Past speakers include: the
founders of Google, Jet Blue and
Yahoo!, venture capitalist John Doerr,
executives from market leaders such as
Cisco and social entrepreneurs from
The Global Fund for Women and
Craigslist
