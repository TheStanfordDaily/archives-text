# LIBRARIAN POWER
## 
### â€” Jenny Thai 
Among the many rites of passage
for Stanford during their fresh
man year is stumbling, often
aimlessly, through the
labyrinthine stacks of Green Li
brary, looking for relevant sources for their
research. For students enrolled in manda
tory Program in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR) courses, the library can be an essen
tial, if sometimes overlooked, reservoir of
information.
According to a PWR student survey
conducted by Green Library in 2009, when
asked what resources students used the

most in their research, 99 percent cited the
library's catalog as the most preferred re
source, edging out Google search, which
achieved a score of 94 percent.
Green Library is home to the Universi
ty's main research collection in the social
sciences and humanities, a collection com
prised of nearly 3 million books. In addi
tion, Green also houses approximately
6,500 current periodicals and journals, as
well as 350 current newspapers. With such
an enormous collection, it is no wonder the
library remains an extremely popular site
for student research.

"The numbers of circulation materials
checked out are staggering," said Chris
Bourg, assistant university librarian for
public services. "According to the circula
tion data, in 2011, Stanford undergraduates
checked out over 150,000 books."
Do the math and that makes roughly 22
books per student.
Green's sheer size, however, can be
rather daunting for students unaccustomed
to navigating their way through research
databases and reference collections.
"The questions we get are a mixed bag,"
said James Jacobs, a government docu
ments librarian at the Information Center
Desk. "We get our share of basic questions,
like 'Where's the bathroom located?' or
'What time does the library close?' but we
also get lots of questions on a variety of re
search topics, some very specific and others
more general in nature."
According to Jacobs, some of the most
commonly asked research-related ques
tions involve the use of databases.
"Sometimes they come to me already
knowing exactly what they want to look for,
like an article in an academic journal," Ja
cobs said. "Other times, I help them refine
their topic. For example, a student I just

worked with was interested in state elec
tions, which was, of course, a really big
topic."
To further arm PWR students with the
tools necessary to conduct meaningful re
search, the Information Center arranges li
brary research workshops, which teach stu
dents how to not only physically navigate
their way through the library but also to con
sider a large array of sources beyond the tra
ditional books and reference material.
Student feedback on the PWR library
workshops has been overwhelmingly posi
tive. In a survey in which PWR students in
fall and winter quarters of this academic
year were asked to rate the usefulness of
the workshops on a scale of one to four,
over 80 percent of students rated the work
shops at least a three. Evaluations on the
helpfulness of librarians have also con
tributed to student enthusiasm for class
projects.
"Stanford's libraries can be very over
whelming and intimidating to search as a
freshman," a student wrote in the survey.
"[The] librarians really make things sim
pler and clearer."
