## MODERN MANNERS A
						call for great pizza 
### Jeff Mandell 
One of the things that I no
ticed last fall, when I was
lucky enough to be study
ing in Florence, Italy with the Bing
program, was the incredible re
gionalism of Italian food. For a
country that is about two-thirds
the size of California, it is amazing
that each state, and sometimes
each town, has its own slate of typ
ical dishes that are either not eaten
anywhere else or simply never pre
pared as well. Pasta with Bolog
nese sauce is all over Italian menus
in the U.S.; in Italy, it's mostly con
fined to Bologna. Picture how
weird it would be if there was a cer
tain great sandwich that you could
only find in Stockton, or a drink
that was delicious in San Diego
and mediocre everywhere else.
Naples is known as the birth
place of pizza. I was there for two
days, and I ate five pizzas at five
different pizzerias. Admittedly, I
didn't choose the pizzerias ran
domly; they had all been ranked
as being among the best or most
famous in the city. As different as
Italian pizza is from American
pizza it's wetter, and is eaten
with a fork and knife Neapoli
tan pizza is distinctly different in
style from all of the other pizza I
had in Italy. And it's really good:
there are a handful of great pizze
rias in Florence and Rome that
might compete on some levels,
but those five Neapolitan pizzas
were possibly the five best pizzas I
had during my three months in
Italy. At worst, they were five of
the seven best.
Of those Neapolitan pizzas,
one clearly stood out from the
others. That was the pizza
margherita I had at Gino Sorbillo,
located on Via Tribunali, 32. It was
an incredible experience, as I
knew from the first bite that it was
the best pizza I had ever tasted.
The price was <A.3O, or about
$4.30 with today's exchange rates,
for a personal pizza around four
teen inches across. That's less than
a Domino's pizza or a foot-long
Subway sandwich, and it was also
more food. How is it possible that
a pizza can be prepared by a mas
ter pizzaiolo using the best dough
recipe, the best tomato sauce and
fine mozzarella, with the result
costing less than fast food?
The farther you go from
Naples, the worse the pizza gets.
When I visited Venice's top pizza
place, there was no comparison.
The pizza was good by most stan
dards, but in Florence and Naples
the toppings were more flavorful
and the crusts more complex. Part
of this is due to the availability of
high quality local ingredients,
something that is very important
to Italians. Since rural Campania
(the state Naples is in) is known

for both its tomatoes and its buf
falo mozzarella, it's not surprising
that Neapolitan pizzas often fea
ture top-notch toppings. But it's
not like Campania is the only
place in the world with a climate
favoring tomatoes and cheese;
Naples' superiority comes just as
much from pride in its traditions.
Whenever Neapolitans over
heard me talking about pizza,
their ears perked up, and many of
them could not resist telling the
American their favorite places.
When you get out of Italy,
there is a dramatic drop in the
quality of the average pizza. It be
comes a challenge to find even a
decent slice. I find it totally bizarre
that this is true in an era of elec
tronic communication and rapid
transportation. Since people all
over the world love pizza, I think
that there would be tremendous
economic incentive for individu
als who know the secrets of great
pizza to open restaurants in new
markets. And while pizza-making
may be an art, I doubt it is neces
sary to grow up in Italy to learn
how to do it well.
Finding good pizza isn't easy in
the Bay Area. My favorite place
around here is A Slice of New
York, on El Camino Real in
Mountain View. New York-style
pizza now seems like an entirely
different product from what I had
in Italy, but I like it. There are
some expensive Italian restau
rants that people say make great
pizza, but my experience in Italy
suggests that white-tablecloth
restaurants needn't be our only
source. Chefs, entrepreneurs, Ital
ian expatriates: this is a call for
some new pizzerias in town. If you
don't act soon, I might have to
start one myself!
