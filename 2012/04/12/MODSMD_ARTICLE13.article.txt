# SEEING GREEN
## Scratching the surface 
### Holly Moeller 
Most of my fieldwork in
New Zealand took me in
land, up to the mountains
alongside the spectacular route
traced by the TranzAlpine rail
line. The route is popular among
tourists for its views of the South
ern Alps: each morning, a 10-car
passenger train studded with
viewing platforms and cafe cars
winds its way slowly through the
passes on the east-west traverse.
In all our to-ing and fro-ing be
tween field sites and our home
base, my field team and I spotted
only two such sightseeing tours.
But we saw the sleek black out
lines of coal trains almost daily.
Dozens of cars long, the indus
trial trains freight 70-million-year
old coal mined on the West Coast
to shipping ports on the East.
Given that New Zealand gets 6
percent of its electricity from coal
fired plants, I initially assumed the
trainloads were destined for local
(or at least, national) use.
"Actually, no," Kathrin, the only
Kiwi among us, said. "It's headed
to China and Japan; we only burn
the cheap, dirty stuff here."
Apparently, New Zealand's bi
tuminous coal is some of the best
in the world. Its lack of impurities
means it burns hot and clean, just
the stuff for steel mills in foreign
lands. In today's globalized world,
the laws of economics say it's best
to sell your high-quality coal on
the international market and buy
someone else's lower grade stuff
for home use.
Like most people occasionally
dismayed by the degree to which
money runs the world, I was as
disconcerted to hear Kathrin's
statement as she was to make it.
And unlike me, Kathrin spent

years living on New Zealand's
West Coast, and knew all too well
how the ecosystems there are
threatened by coal mining.
Similar to controversial recent
mining in the United States, New
Zealand's industry favors open
cast mines, which dynamite off
vegetation, topsoil and up to 400
feet of rock to expose near-sur
face coal seams.
As someone made rather
squeamish by stories of trapped
miners and cave-ins, I admit I'd
much rather work in an open-cast
mine. But they sure are hell on the
environment there's a reason
we've coined the term "mountain
top removal" for coal mining's lat
est incarnation.
At least New Zealand seems to
have a decent handle on environ
mental restoration. Apparently
the (largely government-owned)
mining firms take their cleanup
responsibilities seriously, likely a
response to the Kiwi culture of
environmental stewardship.
That's not to say, of course, that
it's all smooth sailing for the
unique snail and beetle popula
tions often displaced by mining
efforts.
Meanwhile, back home in the
USA, whatever the claims of the
mining company lawyers, no one
seems too pleased with the out
come. Mountaintop mines may
generate jobs, but they also literal
ly turn mountains into dust. And
once that's done, it's simply im
possible to restore the wildlife
habitat, local hydrology or iconic
views of someone's childhood.
That's why so many people
have added their voices to cam
paigns against strip mines and
mountaintop removal. For some,

it's about protesting a local eye
sore or demanding compensation
for a polluted water supply. For
others, it's about protecting na
ture or reducing carbon dioxide
emissions to slow climate change.
For everyone who knows the
story, it's deeply personal.
The fundamental question
we'll all have to wrestle with as cli
mate change accelerates and fuel
prices rise is simple. Flow far will
we let money drive us?
According to most estimates,
the United States has enough coal
in the ground to last through this
century longer, depending on
the estimator. We also have the
largest proven coal reserves in the
world, a reassuring piece of
knowledge for those of us worried
about the fossil fuel aspects of en
ergy security.
The thing is, getting coal from
our backyard means putting
mines in our backyard. It means
blowing apart mountains, killing
off entire populations of endan
gered species and changing
ecosystems in irreversible ways.
We're already realizing how
little we want to live with those
consequences.
So maybe, just maybe, the local
damage of coal mining will do
what the distant downsides of coal
burning cannot. Maybe we'll de
cide that some things are better
left in the ground.

According to most estimates,
the United States has enough coal

century longer, depending on
the estimator. We also have the

Most of my fieldwork in
New Zealand took me in
land, up to the mountains
alongside the spectacular route
traced by the TranzAlpine rail
line. The route is popular among
tourists for its views of the South
ern Alps: each morning, a 10-car
passenger train studded with
viewing platforms and cafe cars
winds its way slowly through the
passes on the east-west traverse.
In all our to-ing and fro-ing be
tween field sites and our home
base, my field team and I spotted
only two such sightseeing tours.
But we saw the sleek black out
lines of coal trains almost daily.
Dozens of cars long, the indus
trial trains freight 70-million-year
old coal mined on the West Coast
to shipping ports on the East.
Given that New Zealand gets 6
percent of its electricity from coal
fired plants, I initially assumed the
trainloads were destined for local
(or at least, national) use.
"Actually, no," Kathrin, the only
Kiwi among us, said. "It's headed
to China and Japan; we only burn
the cheap, dirty stuff here."
Apparently, New Zealand's bi
tuminous coal is some of the best
in the world. Its lack of impurities
means it burns hot and clean, just
the stuff for steel mills in foreign
lands. In today's globalized world,
the laws of economics say it's best
to sell your high-quality coal on
the international market and buy
someone else's lower grade stuff
for home use.
Like most people occasionally
dismayed by the degree to which
money runs the world, I was as
disconcerted to hear Kathrin's
statement as she was to make it.
And unlike me, Kathrin spent

years living on New Zealand's
West Coast, and knew all too well
how the ecosystems there are
threatened by coal mining.
Similar to controversial recent
mining in the United States, New
Zealand's industry favors open
cast mines, which dynamite off
vegetation, topsoil and up to 400
feet of rock to expose near-sur
face coal seams.
As someone made rather
squeamish by stories of trapped
miners and cave-ins, I admit I'd
much rather work in an open-cast
mine. But they sure are hell on the
environment there's a reason
we've coined the term "mountain
top removal" for coal mining's lat
est incarnation.
At least New Zealand seems to
have a decent handle on environ
mental restoration. Apparently
the (largely government-owned)
mining firms take their cleanup
responsibilities seriously, likely a
response to the Kiwi culture of
environmental stewardship.
That's not to say, of course, that
it's all smooth sailing for the
unique snail and beetle popula
tions often displaced by mining
efforts.
Meanwhile, back home in the
USA, whatever the claims of the
mining company lawyers, no one
seems too pleased with the out
come. Mountaintop mines may
generate jobs, but they also literal
ly turn mountains into dust. And
once that's done, it's simply im
possible to restore the wildlife
habitat, local hydrology or iconic
views of someone's childhood.
That's why so many people
have added their voices to cam
paigns against strip mines and
mountaintop removal. For some,

it's about protesting a local eye
sore or demanding compensation
for a polluted water supply. For
others, it's about protecting na
ture or reducing carbon dioxide
emissions to slow climate change.
For everyone who knows the
story, it's deeply personal.
The fundamental question
we'll all have to wrestle with as cli
mate change accelerates and fuel
prices rise is simple. Flow far will
we let money drive us?
