# OP-ED
## Stanford Democrats stand by endorsement 
### 
In recent years, ASSU Elections
have achieved near-joke status
with students outside of a small
group who are intimately involved
with the operation of student gov
ernment. This state of affairs is due
in part to widespread apathy among
voters and a chronic inability of can
didates to deliver on stereotypically
vague campaign proposals. As the
election approaches, the Executive
Board of the Stanford Democrats
would like to re affirm our belief that
the ASSU still has a role to play in
the lives of Stanford students, specif
ically as a bridge between adminis
trators and the student body and as
a platform that facilitates a wide va
riety of student-based initiatives. As
a result, the Stanford Democrats are
endorsing Shahab Fadavi 'l5, Lau
ren Miller 'l5, Jack Weller 'l5, and
Garima Sharma 'l5 as candidates
for ASSU Senate.
These candidates share a realis
tic idea of what the Senate can be
and what they can and, more impor
tantly, cannot achieve if they were to
be elected. Specifically, Shahab,
Jack, Lauren and Garima all con
vinced us that they were passionate
about changing the current Senate's
hostile atmosphere and lobbying
for a specific set of issues, notjust the
glamorous topic of appropriations
reform. Their individual commit
ments to student wellness, advising
reform and ASSU accessibility
(rather than "transparency"), are
the first steps towards redirecting
the focus of Senate from internal re
form and bickering to providing
tangible progress and changes for
the student body.
Three executive slates, MacGre
gor-Dennis/Ghanta, Mwaura/Mbat
ia and ZimbroffiWagstaff, applied

for our official endorsement. The
board was generally impressed with
all three slates. Mwaura and Mbatia
presented a fresh and clear set of ob
jectives that emphasized a commit
ment to achievable goals that would
safeguard student interests and re
focus ASSU actions on the needs of
the average student who does not
care about the specific wording of
the ASSU Constitution, for in
stance. The Zimbroff-Wagstaff slate
shared this common sense ap
proach to campaign priorities and a
clear focus on the student body
along with a collaborative de
meanor that would be well suited to
the position. The board felt, howev
er, that these two slates had the
same general goals as other slates
running in this and, more impor
tantly, previous elections. While we
appreciated the sincerity and fresh
personalities that Zimbroff and
Wagstaff offered, we regret that
they reverted to the many of same
"buzz words" and promises that we
have heard from several past ASSU
Execs. As such, the Stanford De
mocrats believe that Stewart Mac-
Gregor-Dennis's prior experience
as an ASSU Senator and current
ASSU Vice President makes him
the most qualified candidate to be
the next student body president.
Specifically, he has a thorough un
derstanding of the ASSU's rules,
procedures and abilities that will en
able him to effectively lobby for stu
dent interests and start achieving his
tangible campaign goals from day
one.
In the past, as MacGregor-Den
nis himself is quick to acknowledge
from personal experience, ASSU
Executives have wasted significant
portions of the year because they
lack this type of institutional knowl
edge and personal relationship with
University administrators. We also
believe that Druthi Ghanta pro

vides the slate with the necessary
balance of an ASSU outsider who
can bring new perspectives to the
table. MacGregor-Dennis and
Ghanta believe that the ASSU
should actively facilitate the various
initiatives brought to it by passion
ate students, rather than just pro
mote the platforms of its endorsers.
The Stanford Democrats firmly be
lieve that such an inclusive ap
proach, which will certainly pro
duce a mix of successes and some
failures, will lead to the develop
ment of initiatives that benefit all
students in the long term.
It is not the endorsing board's
job to defend all of MacGregor-
Dennis's actions; however, based
on our understanding of the facts
right now, he is being accused of
using his own money to engage in
actions that were legal at the time
he did them. We feel that the
amount of attention given to the re
cent Stewart MacGregor-Dennis
"outsourcing scandal" highlights
the extent to which non-issues per

vade the current ASSU campaign,
but we also understand and can re
late to the anger and outpouring of
concern towards MacGregor-Den
nis's actions. Hiring a company to
boost his social media profile is mis
leading, but legal and does not de
termine whether he can achieve his
platform or not. Finally, while Mac-
Gregor-Dennis's life plan has
reached quasi-meme status with
the student body, we believe that
such attention to detail, self-reflec
tion and refinement of his goals are
something the Exec should con
stantly be doing and will only help
the ASSU create tangible changes
for students. Whether his choices
were ethical is a decision to be
made by each individual voter, but
we sincerely hope that level heads
will prevail as the elections ap
proach.
In conclusion, the Stanford De
mocrats believe that the ASSU
should be composed of individuals
that have a realistic understanding
of how the ASSU functions and

what it can actually achieve. Institu
tional knowledge and personal re
lationships can in this case better
help an Executive team and sena
tors take full advantage of their
term to achieve the goals in their
platform. Therefore, we urge the
student body to consider Stewart
MacGregor-Dennis 'l3 and Druthi
Ghanta 'l4 for ASSU Executive
and Shahab Fadavi, Lauren Miller,
Jack Weller, and Garima Sharma
for ASSU Senate.
The Stanford Democrats Endorse
ment emphasized the candidates'
ability to work for the student body
rather than just their political affilia
tions. The endorsement process con
sisted of an application and inter
view conducted by members of the
executive board: Lindsay Lamont
'l3, Rahul Sastry 'l3, Namir Shah
'l4 and Russ Islam 'l5. Jack Weller,
who is the current co-chair of social
media for the Stanford Democrats,
was not involved in any aspect of the
endorsement process.
