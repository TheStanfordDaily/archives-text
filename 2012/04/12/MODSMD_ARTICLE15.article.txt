# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Symposium connects art, medicine 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
As part of an event Wednesday intended
to celebrate the intersection of medicine
and the arts, Stanford School of Medicine
students displayed creative works ranging
from an original violin piece to belly danc
ing. Three students were also recognized as
winners of the Global Flealth Essay Com
petition.
Held Wednesday night at the Li Ka
Shing Center, the 11th annual Medicine
and the Muse event featured keynote
speaker Sheri Fink, a Pulitzer Prize winner
for investigative journalism in 2010. Past
symposiums have included speakers such
as concert pianist Richard Kogan in 2011
and Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tip
ping Point and Blink, in 2010.
"This year was our inaugural year where
we actually debuted a new fellowship on
global health and the media," said Michele
Barry, senior associate dean for global
health at Stanford. "In order to be an effec
tive change agent to make a difference in
global health, you have to be able to tell
your story well."
The winners of the Global Health Essay
Competition, judged by Fink during its final

stages, were current medical students Laura
Saucier, who won first prize, Amrapali
Maitra, first runner-up, and Pria Anand,
who placed third.
"The multitalented medical students
maintained a balance between the arts, hu
manities and medicine," said Charles G.
Prober, senior associate dean for medical
student education, acknowledging the
theme of the symposium: transcendence.
According to Prober, the event was in
tended, "to celebrate the juxtaposition and
intertwining of the arts and medicine," since
there needs to be a reminder of the balanc
ing benefits of the two as way of "cultivating
and maintaining your outside interests."
The medical student presentations in
cluded an original violin piece, "Hermen
to's Woksape" by Ben Robison, a belly
dance performed by Patricia Ortiz-Tello, a
group poem titled "Body Parts," a comical
song "Ode to Advance Directives" by
Nicole D'Arcy and Anna Krawisz, and a
speech "Would you lie in a tub of cock
roaches?" by Shervin Wang.
"Many of you have experienced that
urge to express yourself, whether it is
through words, music or art," Fink said dur
ing her keynote speech, mentioning how
different forms of expression can help peo

pie cope and understand the emotions that
they feel as they go through different expe
riences in their lives.
"Words have power," Fink added.
"Words matter, like notes of a song, colors
of a painting, the moves of a dancer. We
have to remain mindful of the power these
forms of expression have,"
The floor was then opened to audience
questions. The audience included around
200 medical students, graduate students,
faculty and community members.
Fink reminded her audience, as physi
cians venturing into different fields, to re
spect and be aware of the different stan
dards and ethical obligations held by other
fields.
"Remember that with your pens and
paintbrushes, and with your laptops and lab
benches and offices, that you have the
power to do great good, the power to harm
and the power to do the work that impas
sions you," Fink concluded.
Audrey Shaffer, a professor of anesthe
sia and director of the program in arts, has
organized all of the Medicine and the Muse
events since the series' inception. Medicine
and the Muse is sponsored by the Center
for Biomedical Ethics; the School of Medi
cine's Arts, Humanities and Medicine Pro-

gram; and the Stanford Institute for Cre
ativity and the Arts, in addition to grants
