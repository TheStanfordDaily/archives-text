## Modest Mouse gets top billing at Frost Revival GSC to fund revival concert despite alcohol-pee venue 
### LINDSEY TXAKEEYANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Frost Amphitheatre is set to
come alive again on May 19 with a
performance by Modest Mouse in
the first Frost Revival Concert.
Tickets for the show, with opening
acts Eyes Lips Eyes and Benjamin
Francis Leftwich, will go on sale
April 23 at a student price of $2O.
Student-group funding of the
concert totals about $130,000 ac
cording to Emily Pollock 'l3, co
director Stanford Concert Net
work (SCN). Pollock said SCN
contributed $75,000 from the
group's special fees while the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC) dipped into buffer funds
to provide another $55,000.
Stephen Trusheim 'l3, one of
the members of the organizing
committee for the event, said that
the total cost of the concert can
not be calculated until "the end,
when we reconcile all the ac
counts."
Both Pollock and Trusheim are
part of a committee that has been
try to stage a concert at Frost Am
phitheatre for about a year. Al
though the concert is being pre
sented by SCN, it is also sponsored
by the ASSU (including the
GSC), Cardinal Nights, the Office
of Special Events and Protocol,
Student Activities and Leadership
and the Vice Provost for Student
Affairs.
"We all realize what each
other's expertise is, and there's
times we make group decisions
and, there's times we let, say, SCN
decide something,"Trusheim said.
Trusheim said his primary role
was ensuring that there was
enough money for the event, one
of the committee's biggest issues.
"We were told that Frost is un
touchable; it's way too hard," Pol
lock said. "But it seemed like all of
the aspects were coming together
last spring and we were like, 'Al
right, let's go for it. Everyone's in
support of it. We're going to make
this happen and it's going to be
great.'"
Marine Denolle, co-chair of
GSC, said that the GSC spent a lot
of time discussing how they could
contribute "because all we saw
was this amazing event."

The issue with graduate stu
dent involvement, however, was
the fact that Frost Revival will be
an alcohol-free event, Pollock
said.
"It's hard for graduate stu
dents to not have the option of
beer or alcohol," Denolle said.
"But we do understand that with
out our financial support the
event would not have happened,
so it was pre tty clear we wanted to
help let it happen anyways."
Pollock and Trusheim agreed
that the biggest hope financially
would be to go beyond breaking
even after ticket sales and have
enough profit to go toward a re
serve that will hopefully fund a
concert of this magnitude on an
annual basis.
To choose a headlining act, sur
veys were sent out to ensure that
the choice would be one favored
by students. Event planners com
piled a list of options from the
1,900 student responses. Modest
Mouse landed in the top five.
"Once we start to narrow it
down, it really depends on the
artist timing, and all the stars just
came together with Modest
Mouse," Pollock said. "We're real
ly pleased with the headlining. We
kind of have a progression from
acoustic rock to high-energy rock,
so it's going to be fun."
Eyes Lips Eyes is a band that
has played at smaller Stanford
venues before, so SCN had no
problems booking the group, Pol
lock said.
Alberto Aroeste 'l3, SCN co
director along with Pollock,
reached out to Benjamin Francis
Leftwich, an English singer-song
writer.
In an effort to make Frost Re
vival more of a music and arts fes
tival, the committee has been
working with groups such as the
Product Design Student Associa
tion (PDSA) to bring in artwork
to line the entrance to Frost Am
phitheatre. According to Pollock,
if everything works out, there will
be large and possibly interactive
art projects around the venue.
"Hopefully the concert itself
will just be an amazing capstone
to the year, just showing off every
thing we love about Stanford: art,
sustainability, music and hanging
out together in Frost Amphithe
atre," Trusheim said.

work (SCN). Pollock said SCN
contributed $75,000 from the
group's special fees while the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC) dipped into buffer funds
to provide another $55,000.
Stephen Trusheim 'l3, one of
the members of the organizing
committee for the event, said that
the total cost of the concert can
not be calculated until "the end,
when we reconcile all the ac
counts."
Both Pollock and Trusheim are
part of a committee that has been
try to stage a concert at Frost Am
phitheatre for about a year. Al
though the concert is being pre
sented by SCN, it is also sponsored
by the ASSU (including the
GSC), Cardinal Nights, the Office
of Special Events and Protocol,
Student Activities and Leadership
and the Vice Provost for Student
Affairs.
"We all realize what each
other's expertise is, and there's
times we make group decisions
and, there's times we let, say, SCN
decide something,"Trusheim said.
Trusheim said his primary role
was ensuring that there was
enough money for the event, one
of the committee's biggest issues.
"We were told that Frost is un
touchable; it's way too hard," Pol
lock said. "But it seemed like all of
the aspects were coming together
last spring and we were like, 'Al
right, let's go for it. Everyone's in
support of it. We're going to make
this happen and it's going to be
great.'"
Marine Denolle, co-chair of
GSC, said that the GSC spent a lot
of time discussing how they could
contribute "because all we saw
was this amazing event."

The issue with graduate stu
dent involvement, however, was
the fact that Frost Revival will be
an alcohol-free event, Pollock
said.
"It's hard for graduate stu
dents to not have the option of
beer or alcohol," Denolle said.
"But we do understand that with
out our financial support the
event would not have happened,
so it was pre tty clear we wanted to
help let it happen anyways."
Pollock and Trusheim agreed
that the biggest hope financially
would be to go beyond breaking
even after ticket sales and have
enough profit to go toward a re
serve that will hopefully fund a
concert of this magnitude on an
annual basis.
To choose a headlining act, sur
veys were sent out to ensure that
the choice would be one favored
by students. Event planners com
piled a list of options from the
1,900 student responses. Modest
Mouse landed in the top five.
"Once we start to narrow it
down, it really depends on the
artist timing, and all the stars just
came together with Modest
Mouse," Pollock said. "We're real
ly pleased with the headlining. We
kind of have a progression from
acoustic rock to high-energy rock,
so it's going to be fun."
Eyes Lips Eyes is a band that
has played at smaller Stanford
venues before, so SCN had no
problems booking the group, Pol
lock said.
Alberto Aroeste 'l3, SCN co
director along with Pollock,
reached out to Benjamin Francis
Leftwich, an English singer-song
writer.
In an effort to make Frost Re
vival more of a music and arts fes
tival, the committee has been
working with groups such as the
Product Design Student Associa
tion (PDSA) to bring in artwork
to line the entrance to Frost Am
phitheatre. According to Pollock,
if everything works out, there will
be large and possibly interactive
art projects around the venue.
"Hopefully the concert itself
will just be an amazing capstone
to the year, just showing off every
thing we love about Stanford: art,
sustainability, music and hanging
out together in Frost Amphithe
atre," Trusheim said.
