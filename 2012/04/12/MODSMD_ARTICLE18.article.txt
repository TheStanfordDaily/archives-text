## WATERPROOF CARD DESPITE RAIN, STANFORD CRUISES PAST PACIFIC 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
After a fortuitous, weather-in
duced day off gave the No. 6
Stanford baseball team some
much-needed rest, the Cardinal
beat Pacific 8-3 at home last night
and put away the Tigers in a mid
week matchup for the second
time this season.
Redshirt sophomore left
hander Garrett Hughes pitched
five brilliant innings for his first
career win, and Stanford (21-8,4-
5 Pac-12) got more consistent
production from its top six bat
ters to control the action at
Sunken Diamond from start to
finish. Junior leftfielder Tyler
Gaffney stole two bases while
junior second baseman Kenny
Diekroeger had one of his best
games of the year, recording
three extra-base hits.
The Cardinal would have
played 13 games in 17 days had
rain not delayed the contest with
the Tigers, which was originally
scheduled for Tuesday. Instead,
Stanford came in fresh and
jumped on Pacific (10-21,0-3 Big
West) early and often to secure
its third straight win.
"This is the kind of team we
know we are," Diekroeger said of
the Cardinal's 27 runs in two
games. "It's definitely good news
to just know that we're back to
the old ways."
For Hughes (1-0), a former
high-school Ail-American who
missed all of 2011 with an injury
and got his first career start
against these same Pacific Tigers
over two years ago, the win felt
validating after two years of frus
tration.
"It's a great feeling to get out
there and pitch again," he said. "I
went out there with a lot more
confidence today than I did two
years ago, as a freshman, and I'm
excited going forward."
Stanford got on the board
with a sacrifice fly from junior
centerfielder Jake Stewart in the
bottom of the second, and made
it 3-0 with a two-out rally in the
third. With Gaffney on second
after being hit by a pitch and
stealing second, junior third
baseman Stephen Piscotty dou
bled him home and later came
around to score on a single by
sophomore first baseman Brian
Ragira.
Hughes cruised through the
first three innings and looked
poised to get out of a fourth-in
ning jam when he snagged a one

out, comeback chopper. The red
shirt sophomore couldn't con
vert the double play, however,
overthrowing second to bring
home an unearned run.
He added two more innings of
solid work before departing, giv
ing up only four hits.
"You could just tell that he
was pitching with something to
prove out there," said
Diekroeger, Hughes' roommate.
"You could really tell that he was
giving it his all, and that's what
we really need from our guys on
the mound."
Stanford quickly got that run
back in the bottom of the fourth,
as junior catcher Eric Smith and

Diekroeger led off with a single
and a double. Shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila brought them both
around to score on a double of
his own â€”just the fifth of the
season for the sophomore and
came home on a Gaffney single
later in the frame, making it 6-1.
Diekroeger launched his sec
ond homer of the year deep over
the left-field fence to add anoth
er tally in the fifth.
Pacific narrowed the margin
by two runs in the sixth off soph
omore righty Sam Lindquist. but
an error and a wild pitch by the
Tigers in the bottom of the sev
enth got Stanford an 8-3 lead
that the Cardinal would hold.

Diekroeger also added his sec
ond double of the night in the
seventh, making for a team
leading 12 two-baggers on the
season.
"I'm just trying to see the ball
well and put a good swing on it,"
Diekroeger said of his 3-for-3
performance, "Sometimes you
hit the ball hard three times and
go 0-for-3."
Stanford will now prepare to
host No. 16 Oregon in a three
game series this weekend, with
the opener starting Friday at 5:30
p.m.
