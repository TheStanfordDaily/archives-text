# Tiger lost it, and it's not coming back
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
The story of this past
weekend's Masters
was, of course. Big
Bubba Watson bash
ing his way to his first
major championship victory at
Augusta. But even though Bubba
took home his first green jacket,
it's impossible to dissect what
happened at Augusta without at
least paying a shred of attention
to Stanford's most famous former
athlete. Of course, I'm talking
about Tiger Woods and his self
described atrocious play at Au
gusta.

The 14-time major winner
couldn't do anything right in
Georgia this past week, as he
recorded his worst-ever finish
after making a cut in a major and
his worst-ever finish in the Mas
ters by a long shot. And as I
watched Tiger cuss and mope his
way around Augusta this week
end, it became clearer than ever
to me that the greatest golfer of
our generation has lost the magic
that he once had, and that he'll
never be able to get it back. As of
this week, I feel more confident
than ever in saying that Tiger
doesn't have a chance at passing
Jack Nicklaus' 18 major champi
onship titles.
Indeed, there have been many
detractors that have said that
Tiger's game post-sex scandal will
never be the same, but why did
this week in particular make me
so willing to bury the future of
Tiger's golf game? Three reasons:
his top-to-bottom awful golf
game, the fact that his terrible
play came at Augusta and the
ever-quickening hands of time.
First and foremost, Tiger's
game is nowhere near where it
used to be, and it didn't show any
signs of life at a course that he
used to dominate. Off the tee, in
typical fashion, Tiger didn't even
hit Augusta's generous fairways
60 percent of the time. When he
did hit the fairway, he hit the
greens just 55 percent of the time
a dreadfully low number for
him. And when he did hit the
greens, while Tiger didn't have
that bad a week statistically
speaking, he didn't make any big
time putts to put himself into con
tention the putts he never
missed when he was at his peak.
What's more, every time he did
something right, he immediately
turned around and messed it up
on the next shot. He'd hit a fair
way then dump it in the greenside
bunker. He'd knock it close to the
pin then whiff a six-foot putt. His
game, once a harmony of tee-to
green excellence, was an utter ca
cophony of catastrophe. That's
not the way you win a golf tour
nament, much less a major cham
pionship against the 100 best
golfers in the world.
But even though Tiger's game
was no good this past week, the
bigger problem was the fact that
he played that poorly at Augusta
a course he has always domi
nated. Since turning pro, Tiger
has played in 16 Masters tourna
ments, and he's finished in the
top 10 a whopping 12 of those
times, including four wins. From
2005 to 2011, Tiger's worst finish
was a tie for sixth place in 2009.
Those stats are what make his
most recent Masters perform
ance so startling. Tiger's game
has so utterly failed him that he
can't even play well on the
course he's been the most com
fortable on during his career.
From a guy who made Augusta
his personal playground for
more than a decade, it's utterly
shocking to see him struggle so
mightily.
With that said, his perform
ance at Augusta does not bode

well for his future in major cham
pionships, the one area where he
still lags behind Nicklaus. Tiger is
only 36 years old, with a decade
or more of majors ahead of him,
but if he can't even play well at
Augusta anymore, how can we
expect him to contend at any
other major tournaments?
There's just no way Tiger can
catch up to and pass Jack
Nicklaus' record if he can't even
contend at Augusta anymore, the
course that has always presented
Tiger with his best chance to win
majors. As time ticks further into
the future and Tiger's body and
game continue to change and
look less and less like the man
who stormed his way to 14 major
titles, how can we expect him to
regain his greatness? While he
might win another major or two
(if he's lucky), it's flat-out unreal
istic to expect this iteration of
Tiger Woods to dip into the foun
tain of youth and start carving up
courses again.
I didn't think it would ever
come to this a couple years ago,
but finally, in April 2012, this
Masters finally showed me one
thing: Tiger's dominance has
slipped away. And it's never com
ing back.

Jack Blanchat didn't take into ac
count what would happen if Tiger
gets ahold of one of Bubba's pink
drivers. Tell Jack how well pink will
match Tiger's Sunday red at blan

The story of this past
weekend's Masters
was, of course. Big
Bubba Watson bash
ing his way to his first
major championship victory at
Augusta. But even though Bubba
took home his first green jacket,
it's impossible to dissect what
happened at Augusta without at
least paying a shred of attention
to Stanford's most famous former
athlete. Of course, I'm talking
about Tiger Woods and his self
described atrocious play at Au
gusta.

The 14-time major winner
couldn't do anything right in
Georgia this past week, as he
recorded his worst-ever finish
after making a cut in a major and
his worst-ever finish in the Mas
ters by a long shot. And as I
watched Tiger cuss and mope his
way around Augusta this week
end, it became clearer than ever
to me that the greatest golfer of
our generation has lost the magic
that he once had, and that he'll
never be able to get it back. As of
this week, I feel more confident
than ever in saying that Tiger
doesn't have a chance at passing
Jack Nicklaus' 18 major champi
onship titles.
Indeed, there have been many
detractors that have said that
Tiger's game post-sex scandal will
never be the same, but why did
this week in particular make me
so willing to bury the future of
Tiger's golf game? Three reasons:
his top-to-bottom awful golf
game, the fact that his terrible
play came at Augusta and the
ever-quickening hands of time.
First and foremost, Tiger's
game is nowhere near where it
used to be, and it didn't show any
signs of life at a course that he
used to dominate. Off the tee, in
typical fashion, Tiger didn't even
hit Augusta's generous fairways
60 percent of the time. When he
did hit the fairway, he hit the
greens just 55 percent of the time
a dreadfully low number for
him. And when he did hit the
greens, while Tiger didn't have
that bad a week statistically
speaking, he didn't make any big
time putts to put himself into con
tention the putts he never
missed when he was at his peak.
What's more, every time he did
something right, he immediately
turned around and messed it up
on the next shot. He'd hit a fair
way then dump it in the greenside
bunker. He'd knock it close to the
pin then whiff a six-foot putt. His
game, once a harmony of tee-to
green excellence, was an utter ca
cophony of catastrophe. That's
not the way you win a golf tour
nament, much less a major cham
pionship against the 100 best
golfers in the world.
But even though Tiger's game
was no good this past week, the
bigger problem was the fact that
he played that poorly at Augusta
a course he has always domi
nated. Since turning pro, Tiger
has played in 16 Masters tourna
ments, and he's finished in the
top 10 a whopping 12 of those
times, including four wins. From
2005 to 2011, Tiger's worst finish
was a tie for sixth place in 2009.
Those stats are what make his
most recent Masters perform
ance so startling. Tiger's game
has so utterly failed him that he
can't even play well on the
course he's been the most com
fortable on during his career.
From a guy who made Augusta
his personal playground for
more than a decade, it's utterly
shocking to see him struggle so
mightily.
With that said, his perform
ance at Augusta does not bode

well for his future in major cham
pionships, the one area where he
still lags behind Nicklaus. Tiger is
only 36 years old, with a decade
or more of majors ahead of him,
but if he can't even play well at
Augusta anymore, how can we
expect him to contend at any
other major tournaments?
There's just no way Tiger can
catch up to and pass Jack
Nicklaus' record if he can't even
contend at Augusta anymore, the
course that has always presented
Tiger with his best chance to win
majors. As time ticks further into
the future and Tiger's body and
game continue to change and
look less and less like the man
who stormed his way to 14 major
titles, how can we expect him to
regain his greatness? While he
might win another major or two
(if he's lucky), it's flat-out unreal
istic to expect this iteration of
Tiger Woods to dip into the foun
tain of youth and start carving up
courses again.
I didn't think it would ever
come to this a couple years ago,
but finally, in April 2012, this
Masters finally showed me one
thing: Tiger's dominance has
slipped away. And it's never com
ing back.
