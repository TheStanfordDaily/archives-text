# Tiger lost it, and it's not coming back

### Jack Blanchat 
The story of this past
weekend's Masters
was, of course. Big
Bubba Watson bash
ing his way to his first
major championship victory at
Augusta. But even though Bubba
took home his first green jacket,
it's impossible to dissect what
happened at Augusta without at
least paying a shred of attention
to Stanford's most famous former
athlete. Of course, I'm talking
about Tiger Woods and his self
described atrocious play at Au
gusta.

The 14-time major winner
couldn't do anything right in
Georgia this past week, as he
recorded his worst-ever finish
after making a cut in a major and
his worst-ever finish in the Mas
ters by a long shot. And as I
watched Tiger cuss and mope his
way around Augusta this week
end, it became clearer than ever
to me that the greatest golfer of
our generation has lost the magic
that he once had, and that he'll
never be able to get it back. As of
this week, I feel more confident
than ever in saying that Tiger
doesn't have a chance at passing
Jack Nicklaus' 18 major champi
onship titles.
Indeed, there have been many
detractors that have said that
Tiger's game post-sex scandal will
never be the same, but why did
this week in particular make me
so willing to bury the future of
Tiger's golf game? Three reasons:
his top-to-bottom awful golf
game, the fact that his terrible
play came at Augusta and the
ever-quickening hands of time.
First and foremost, Tiger's
game is nowhere near where it
used to be, and it didn't show any
signs of life at a course that he
used to dominate. Off the tee, in
typical fashion, Tiger didn't even
hit Augusta's generous fairways
60 percent of the time. When he
did hit the fairway, he hit the
greens just 55 percent of the time
a dreadfully low number for
him. And when he did hit the
greens, while Tiger didn't have
that bad a week statistically
speaking, he didn't make any big
time putts to put himself into con
tention the putts he never
missed when he was at his peak.
What's more, every time he did
something right, he immediately
turned around and messed it up
