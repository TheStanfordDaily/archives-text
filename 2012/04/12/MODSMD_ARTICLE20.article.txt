# TOP-FIVE TESTS AWAIT
## 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
The undefeated Stanford
women's tennis team is sure to be
tested this weekend as two of the
top five teams in the nation visit
the Farm for conference matches.
No. 6 Stanford (15-0, 6-0 Pac-12)
will play No. 4 USC on Friday and
then No. 1 UCLA on Saturday.
Stanford, which has shut out its
opponents in seven straight
matches and has not dropped
more than two points in a team
match all season, is in the unusual
position of being the underdog for
both matches, at least according to
the rankings.
"We are going in with an un
derdog mentality even though we
think we can win both matches,"
said sophomore Nicole Gibbs.
"This is definitely the biggest
weekend of our regular season."
Fellow undefeated UCLA has
also dominated its opponents this
season, recording 11 shutouts on
its way to a 20-0 start. The Bruins
are tough from the top down,
starting at the No. 1 position where
No. 4 Robin Anderson will take on
Gibbs, who is currently ranked
one spot above her at No. 3.
The competitive Gibbs, who is
well aware of Robinson's rise to
the No. 4 ranking this week, noted
the added importance that na
tional ranking implications give to
her match. Gibbs has lost only
once this year during Stanford's
regular season, a three-setter to
Florida's Allie Will, who is cur
rently ranked No. 1 in the country.

"I'm looking forward to a
tough, competitive weekend,"
said Gibbs, who will also face the
No. 20 player in the nation in
USC's Zoe Scandalis.
Looking past the No. 1 spot,
the entire Stanford team feels it
has something to prove this week
end. The Cardinal lost its top
ranking earlier in the season due
to questions about its strength of
schedule, despite being undefeat
ed and having beaten defending
national champion Florida.
"This weekend will be defin
ing," said junior Natalie Dillon. "If
we win we know we are the best
team in the country."
USC also brings an impressive
record into the weekend, which
means Stanford cannot overlook
either team. USC is 18-2 overall,
with both losses coming to
UCLA.
"We need to be fighting for
every point all weekend because
both teams are really going to
push us," Gibbs said.
USC and UCLA each have
four nationally ranked singles
players, the same number as Stan
ford, and all of their players have
experience playing against quality
opponents.
"There will be a lot of depth on
both of these teams, and hopeful
ly we will prove to be the deeper
team," Gibbs said.
Dillon, anchoring the No. 6
spot this weekend, is one of the
players at the back end for Stan
ford â€” a spot that is critical to

pick up team wins. She called the
matches this weekend "two of the
biggest matches of my time here
at Stanford," especially because
most teams across the country do
not have such quality players fill
ing out their rosters.
This weekend will also be cru
cial in deciding who the eventual
Pac-12 champion will be. Stan
ford has a long history of winning
the conference, and winning the
final three matches of the season
would guarantee another regular
season championship. Both
UCLA and USC are also unde
feated in Pac-12 play, though, so a
loss this weekend would severely
hurt Stanford's chances of taking
that trophy.
Rain is forecasted for this Fri
day, which means the USC match
could be moved to Sunday if the

courts are unplayable. Currently,
though, Friday's match against
USC is scheduled for 1:30 p.m.
and Saturday's match against
UCLA is at 12:00 p.m. Both
matches will take place at the
Taube Family Tennis Center.
