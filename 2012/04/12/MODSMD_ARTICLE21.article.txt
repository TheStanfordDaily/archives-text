# SECOND IS GOOD ENOUGH
## 
### CONNOR SCHERER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following a fourth-place finish in the
Pac-12 Championships in which the Stan
ford women's gymnastics team put up its
best score of the season with a 196.825, the
Cardinal was looking to make a statement
at Regionals as the team tried to qualify for
the NCAA championships for the fifth
time in six years. Facing five other teams, in
cluding a very strong Oklahoma team, the
Cardinal faced a daunting task.
The regional competition is among the
most pressure-packed tournaments all
year, as it determines whether or not teams

will qualify for nationals. However, Stan
ford was able to channel this pressure into
success, as it posted its second-best score of
the season with a 196.675. The team fin
ished second in the group, behind only
Oklahoma (197.025) and just beating host
Illinois (195.725) for the final qualifying po
sition.
Starting on floor, the team scored a
49.075, led by freshman Pauline Hanset's
9.875. Freshman Ivana Hong and senior
Nicole Pechanec both put up 9.850s to sup
port Hanset's effort. While having freshman
participants perform so well is not typical of
most teams, it is nothing new for head coach
Kristen Smyth and the Cardinal.

"From the beginning of the season, the
freshman class came in and really con
tributed, and not just in competitions,"
Smyth said.
Moving to the vault, Stanford kept up its
strong performance by earning a 48.950.
Senior Alyssa Brown led the effort on vault
with a 9.900, earning her the individual vic
tory in the event. It was her third individual
victory of the season, but her first on vault
(she won on beam twice before). Brown's
season was plagued by injuries, but she has
made a comeback to be one of Stanford's
strongest competitors in most recent com
petitions. Smyth, however, is used to
Brown's "inspirational comebacks," and
expected nothing less of the senior. A 9.825
by Hong also helped the Cardinal stay
within striking distance of Oklahoma head
ing into the third round.
On bars is where the Cardinal really
made its statement, putting up a 49.400, tied
for its season-best in the event. Stanford
won this event handily, and its 49.400 was
the second-best team score in any event be
hind Oklahoma's 49.450 on floor. As has
been the story all season, Pechanec was
magnificent on bars, earning a 9.925 and the
individual victory in the event. In fact, one
judge gave her a perfect 10, a very rare and
impressive feat for college gymnasts.
Brown and freshman Sami Shapiro nearly
matched Pechanec's score, as they each
scored a 9.900, a season-best score in the
event for both of them.
Heading into the final round down 0.500
points to Oklahoma and up 0.675 to Illinois
with two qualifying spots on the line, the
Cardinal had to make sure it posted a
strong final score on beam as it tried to so
lidify its nationals position.
When Pechanec, one of the team's
stronger competitors on beam, fell and
earned just a 9.175 as the second of six com
petitors in the event, the pressure mounted
on the four teammates behind her to pick
up her slack with a spot in nationals at risk.
But when the pressure got to be its high
est, the Cardinal responded, as none of
Pechanec's four teammates scored below a
9.800 to seal the team's spot at nationals.
Sophomore captain Amanda Spinner led
the way with a 9.900, which earned her a
four-way tie for the individual victory in the
event, while sophomore Shona Morgan put
up a 9.850. Freshman Becky Wing scored a
9.875 to lead off the event, an important po
sition for such a young competitor. Wing has
handled the added pressure with extreme
confidence throughout the entire year.
When it was all said and done, the Card
had earned a spot in nationals on April 20-
22 with Oklahoma. Smyth described how
proud she was of her team: "The way they
fought the entire meet, stayed poised and

confident throughout it all, it was very in
spiring."
Heading into nationals, Smyth gives her
team a good chance of winning, as long as it
reduces its errors and executes its routines.
"It's a hitter's meet. As long as we hit our
routines, we should move on. We all know
what we're capable of."
Smyth believes the season has followed
its plan extremely well, as the squad started
out slow and picked things up as the season
progressed. Ranked 10th of 12 teams in na
tionals, Stanford will have to have a season
best performance in order to come home
with the national title.
And while the Cardinal women were se
curing their chance to compete for an
NCAA title, the third-ranked Stanford
men's team finished second in a four-team
field at the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion (MPSF) Championships, with a score of
352.100, placing behind second-ranked
Oklahoma (355.600) but ahead of No. 7 Cal
(345.950) and No. 12 Air Force (335.950).
Starting off on floor, Stanford got out to
an early lead with a score of 60.950. Junior
Eddie Penev earned the individual title with
a 15.850, while redshirt sophomore Paul
Hichwa finished fifth overall in the event
(15.100) and redshirt junior Jordan Nolff
and sophomore Cale Robinson tied for
eighth (15.000).
The Cardinal fell to second behind Okla
homa with a 56.750 on pommel horse, led by
sophomore Chris Turner's 14.750 and red
shirt junior Gabriel Alvarado's 14.600.
Junior James Fosco earned the Cardinal's
second individual victory of the meet with a
15.300 on still rings, while Nolff's 14.750 and
Penev's 14.500 helped the Cardinal earn a
58.800 in the event. However, the team still
trailed Oklahoma as it headed into the
fourth round.
Penev scored a 15.350 on vault, good for
his second individual victory of the night and
Stanford's third, while redshirt freshman
Sean Senters tied for third with a 13.000.The
Cardinal earned a team score of 59.450 in
the event to help cut Oklahoma's lead.
Redshirt junior Cameron Foreman got
second overall on parallel bars with a
15.250, and even with four other top-10 fin
ishers in the event, Stanford's deficit to
Oklahoma grew to 1.600 points as the sixth
and final round started. Hichwa's 14.400 on
high bar helped the Cardinal earn a 58.750
in the event, but the effort was not good
enough to make up Oklahoma's lead.
Although the Sooners won the MPSF
Championships, Stanford will see them
again as it tries to defend its national title
on April 19-21 in Oklahoma.

ished second in the group, behind only
Oklahoma (197.025) and just beating host
Illinois (195.725) for the final qualifying po
sition.
Starting on floor, the team scored a
49.075, led by freshman Pauline Hanset's
9.875. Freshman Ivana Hong and senior
Nicole Pechanec both put up 9.850s to sup
port Hanset's effort. While having freshman
participants perform so well is not typical of
most teams, it is nothing new for head coach
Kristen Smyth and the Cardinal.

"From the beginning of the season, the
freshman class came in and really con
tributed, and not just in competitions,"
Smyth said.
Moving to the vault, Stanford kept up its
strong performance by earning a 48.950.
Senior Alyssa Brown led the effort on vault
with a 9.900, earning her the individual vic
tory in the event. It was her third individual
victory of the season, but her first on vault
(she won on beam twice before). Brown's
season was plagued by injuries, but she has
made a comeback to be one of Stanford's
strongest competitors in most recent com
petitions. Smyth, however, is used to
Brown's "inspirational comebacks," and
expected nothing less of the senior. A 9.825
by Hong also helped the Cardinal stay
within striking distance of Oklahoma head
ing into the third round.
On bars is where the Cardinal really
made its statement, putting up a 49.400, tied
for its season-best in the event. Stanford
won this event handily, and its 49.400 was
the second-best team score in any event be
hind Oklahoma's 49.450 on floor. As has
been the story all season, Pechanec was
magnificent on bars, earning a 9.925 and the
individual victory in the event. In fact, one
judge gave her a perfect 10, a very rare and
impressive feat for college gymnasts.
Brown and freshman Sami Shapiro nearly
matched Pechanec's score, as they each
scored a 9.900, a season-best score in the
event for both of them.
Heading into the final round down 0.500
points to Oklahoma and up 0.675 to Illinois
with two qualifying spots on the line, the
Cardinal had to make sure it posted a
strong final score on beam as it tried to so
lidify its nationals position.
When Pechanec, one of the team's
stronger competitors on beam, fell and
earned just a 9.175 as the second of six com
petitors in the event, the pressure mounted
on the four teammates behind her to pick
up her slack with a spot in nationals at risk.
But when the pressure got to be its high
est, the Cardinal responded, as none of
Pechanec's four teammates scored below a
9.800 to seal the team's spot at nationals.
Sophomore captain Amanda Spinner led
the way with a 9.900, which earned her a
four-way tie for the individual victory in the
event, while sophomore Shona Morgan put
up a 9.850. Freshman Becky Wing scored a
9.875 to lead off the event, an important po
sition for such a young competitor. Wing has
handled the added pressure with extreme
confidence throughout the entire year.
When it was all said and done, the Card
had earned a spot in nationals on April 20-
22 with Oklahoma. Smyth described how
proud she was of her team: "The way they
fought the entire meet, stayed poised and

confident throughout it all, it was very in
spiring."
Heading into nationals, Smyth gives her
team a good chance of winning, as long as it
reduces its errors and executes its routines.
"It's a hitter's meet. As long as we hit our
routines, we should move on. We all know
what we're capable of."
Smyth believes the season has followed
its plan extremely well, as the squad started
out slow and picked things up as the season
progressed. Ranked 10th of 12 teams in na
tionals, Stanford will have to have a season
best performance in order to come home
with the national title.
And while the Cardinal women were se
curing their chance to compete for an
NCAA title, the third-ranked Stanford
men's team finished second in a four-team
field at the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion (MPSF) Championships, with a score of
352.100, placing behind second-ranked
Oklahoma (355.600) but ahead of No. 7 Cal
(345.950) and No. 12 Air Force (335.950).
Starting off on floor, Stanford got out to
an early lead with a score of 60.950. Junior
Eddie Penev earned the individual title with
a 15.850, while redshirt sophomore Paul
Hichwa finished fifth overall in the event
(15.100) and redshirt junior Jordan Nolff
and sophomore Cale Robinson tied for
eighth (15.000).
The Cardinal fell to second behind Okla
homa with a 56.750 on pommel horse, led by
sophomore Chris Turner's 14.750 and red
shirt junior Gabriel Alvarado's 14.600.
Junior James Fosco earned the Cardinal's
second individual victory of the meet with a
15.300 on still rings, while Nolff's 14.750 and
Penev's 14.500 helped the Cardinal earn a
58.800 in the event. However, the team still
trailed Oklahoma as it headed into the
fourth round.
Penev scored a 15.350 on vault, good for
his second individual victory of the night and
Stanford's third, while redshirt freshman
Sean Senters tied for third with a 13.000.The
Cardinal earned a team score of 59.450 in
the event to help cut Oklahoma's lead.
Redshirt junior Cameron Foreman got
second overall on parallel bars with a
15.250, and even with four other top-10 fin
ishers in the event, Stanford's deficit to
Oklahoma grew to 1.600 points as the sixth
and final round started. Hichwa's 14.400 on
high bar helped the Cardinal earn a 58.750
in the event, but the effort was not good
enough to make up Oklahoma's lead.
Although the Sooners won the MPSF
Championships, Stanford will see them
again as it tries to defend its national title
on April 19-21 in Oklahoma.
