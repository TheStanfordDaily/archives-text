## Current ASSU VP'outsources' student data MacGregor-Dennis cites academic interest to explain ODesk activity 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DEPUTY EDITOR 
ASSU Vice President and current Execu
tive candidate Stewart MacGregor-Dennis
'l3, along with a friend whom he declined to
name, has paid for over $2,000 of personal
and ASSU-related services through an
ODesk account, including one task that in
volved giving access to student names and
emails to third-party contractors to aggre
gate the data.
The account on ODesk has over 50 jobs
posted since May 2011, including paying for
Facebook "likes," You Tube hits and Tumblr
followers. MacGregor-Dennis denied ever
paying for Facebook likes and You Tube hits,
though he said he hired social media man
agers whose main responsibilities were gen
erating likes, hits and followers.
Additionally, the account paid a third
party contractor listed by ODesk under the
name "Rebecca S." and as living in the Philip
pines, to "scrape" first names, last names and
email addresses of presidents, financial offi
cers, additional officers and E-commerce of
ficers of student groups from MyGroups, the
ASSU's student group software. The con
tractor organized the data into a spreadsheet
in August 2011.
These student email addresses were all
publicly available at the time,
though the MyGroups system was
later updated to require an SUID
web login to access the informa
tion. This shift was made, accord
ing to director of Student Activi
ties and Leadership (SAL) Nanci
Howe, out of consideration for
students, who were receiving
spam.
"It hasn't been public in many
years; we've directed them to the
directory," said Howe, whose de
partment oversees MyGroups,
since updated to MyGroups2.This
means that only emails of students
who had opted to have their
emails publicly available would
have shown up in this "scrape."
The Daily has not been able to
get into contact with Rebecca S.,
the ODesk contractor. Her job is
listed as "complete." Several fi
nancial officers for student groups
reported receiving personal
emails from MacGregor-Dennis
over the past few months asking to
meet and talk about what the
ASSU can do for their organiza
tions.
MacGregor-Dennis maintains
that he has never broken Universi
ty policy by paying for services
through ODesk or directing con
tractors to student information.
An email to Stanford Information
Technology Services asking for
clarification on the University's
policy regarding distributing pub
licly available student information
has not yet been answered.
Other jobs on the ODesk ac
count include a Social Media
Manager who has been paid over
$BOO, a Student Government
Email Assistant who has been

paid over $lOO and a Tumblr blog
follower who has been paid
$299.38 dollars.
MacGregor-Dennis later clari
fied that the social marketing posi
tions were largely related to mar
keting for the new eDorm and
"several other business ventures"
he was working on this year. His
most recent ASSU Facebook up
dates have been "liked" by be
tween 30 and 40 people, the major
ity of whom are fake Facebook ac
counts. They share similar "likes"
in addition to MacGregor-Dennis'
campaign page, such as D 9 music,
a book about the antichrist and a
company called MAK Financial.
"Facebook Like Generator,"
"Entrepreneurship Website Con
tent Creator" and "Get 1,000
views for my You Tube video" are
other items purchased through the
ODesk account.
The Tumblr blog follower's job
is listed as, "I need someone to fol
low other blogs on Tumblr for my
blog, and then later unfollow other
blogs on a different day."
"None of it is ASSU money,"
MacGregor-Dennis said, citing ac
ademic interest in social media.
"All of this would be distributed
among friends who are interested
in the area."
MacGregor-Dennis said he
does not have a problem with stu
dents learning any this informa
tion. Students, on the other hand,
have not taken kindly to MacGre
gor-Dennis' strategies and what
could amount to a political mis
step.
"This is an area of academic re
search for me. I think there are
huge social problems to be tackled
[in the labor field], and I am happy
to answer any questions about
this," MacGregor-Dennis said.

name "Rebecca S." and as living in the Philip
pines, to "scrape" first names, last names and
email addresses of presidents, financial offi
cers, additional officers and E-commerce of
ficers of student groups from MyGroups, the
ASSU's student group software. The con
tractor organized the data into a spreadsheet
in August 2011.
These student email addresses were all
publicly available at the time,
though the MyGroups system was
later updated to require an SUID
web login to access the informa
tion. This shift was made, accord
ing to director of Student Activi
ties and Leadership (SAL) Nanci
Howe, out of consideration for
students, who were receiving
spam.
"It hasn't been public in many
years; we've directed them to the
directory," said Howe, whose de
partment oversees MyGroups,
since updated to MyGroups2.This
means that only emails of students
who had opted to have their
emails publicly available would
have shown up in this "scrape."
The Daily has not been able to
get into contact with Rebecca S.,
the ODesk contractor. Her job is
listed as "complete." Several fi
nancial officers for student groups
reported receiving personal
emails from MacGregor-Dennis
over the past few months asking to
meet and talk about what the
ASSU can do for their organiza
tions.
MacGregor-Dennis maintains
that he has never broken Universi
ty policy by paying for services
through ODesk or directing con
tractors to student information.
An email to Stanford Information
Technology Services asking for
clarification on the University's
policy regarding distributing pub
licly available student information
has not yet been answered.
Other jobs on the ODesk ac
count include a Social Media
Manager who has been paid over
$BOO, a Student Government
Email Assistant who has been

paid over $lOO and a Tumblr blog
follower who has been paid
$299.38 dollars.
MacGregor-Dennis later clari
fied that the social marketing posi
tions were largely related to mar
keting for the new eDorm and
"several other business ventures"
he was working on this year. His
most recent ASSU Facebook up
dates have been "liked" by be
tween 30 and 40 people, the major
ity of whom are fake Facebook ac
counts. They share similar "likes"
in addition to MacGregor-Dennis'
campaign page, such as D 9 music,
a book about the antichrist and a
company called MAK Financial.
"Facebook Like Generator,"
"Entrepreneurship Website Con
tent Creator" and "Get 1,000
views for my You Tube video" are
other items purchased through the
ODesk account.
The Tumblr blog follower's job
is listed as, "I need someone to fol
low other blogs on Tumblr for my
blog, and then later unfollow other
blogs on a different day."
"None of it is ASSU money,"
MacGregor-Dennis said, citing ac
ademic interest in social media.
"All of this would be distributed
among friends who are interested
in the area."
MacGregor-Dennis said he
does not have a problem with stu
dents learning any this informa
tion. Students, on the other hand,
have not taken kindly to MacGre
gor-Dennis' strategies and what
could amount to a political mis
step.
"This is an area of academic re
search for me. I think there are
huge social problems to be tackled
[in the labor field], and I am happy
to answer any questions about
this," MacGregor-Dennis said.
