# Guaranteed success for SOCC
## Student interest group to have endorsed majority of next year's Senate 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
In recent years, perhaps no campus
group has been more influential in deter
mining the outcome of ASSU elections
than the Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC), which both endorses candidates
and offers campaign assistance.
The last three executive slates support
ed by SOCC Cruz-Macgregor-Dennis
in 2011, Cardona-Wharton in 2010 and
Avula-Jones in 2007 have been elected
to office. SOCC did not endorse executive

slates in 2008 or 2009.
Last year, 12 of 15 SOCC-endorsed can
didates were elected to the 13th Under
graduate Senate.
Candidates for the ASSU Senate and
the Executive, as well as current senators,
sat down with The Daily to discuss the sig
nificance of the SOCC endorsement for
ASSU elections as well as the ASSU's leg
islative agenda in the upcoming year.
SOCC is a coalition of six groups: the
Asian American Students' Association
(AASA), the Black Student Union (BSU),
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de

Aztlan (MEChA), the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN), the Nation
al Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP) and the Stan
ford American Indian Organization
(SAIO).
Candidates cited SOCC's extensive stu
dent network, as well as campaign experi
ence garnered by the coalition in previous
elections, as valuable assets in election sea
son.
