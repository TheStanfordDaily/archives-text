# Guaranteed success for SOCC
## Student interest group to have endorsed majority of next year's Senate 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
In recent years, perhaps no campus
group has been more influential in deter
mining the outcome of ASSU elections
than the Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC), which both endorses candidates
and offers campaign assistance.
The last three executive slates support
ed by SOCC Cruz-Macgregor-Dennis
in 2011, Cardona-Wharton in 2010 and
Avula-Jones in 2007 have been elected
to office. SOCC did not endorse executive

slates in 2008 or 2009.
Last year, 12 of 15 SOCC-endorsed can
didates were elected to the 13th Under
graduate Senate.
Candidates for the ASSU Senate and
the Executive, as well as current senators,
sat down with The Daily to discuss the sig
nificance of the SOCC endorsement for
ASSU elections as well as the ASSU's leg
islative agenda in the upcoming year.
SOCC is a coalition of six groups: the
Asian American Students' Association
(AASA), the Black Student Union (BSU),
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de

Aztlan (MEChA), the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN), the Nation
al Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP) and the Stan
ford American Indian Organization
(SAIO).
Candidates cited SOCC's extensive stu
dent network, as well as campaign experi
ence garnered by the coalition in previous
elections, as valuable assets in election sea
son.
"It gives you a base of people to work
with in terms of manpower [and]
flyering," said candidate William
Wagstaff 'l2. Robbie Zimbroff
'l2 and Wagstaff received this
year's SOCC endorsement for the
ASSU Executive.
"There's a huge difference be
tween supporters and voters,"
said Senator Dan DeLong 'l3.
"Some candidates are good at ob
taining supporters [but] SOCC is
excellent at ensuring that their
community votes."
DeLong was not endorsed by
SOCC last year. He said he did
not begin his campaign for Senate
in earnest until after the group's
deadline for candidates seeking
endorsements. DeLong sought
SOCC's endorsement this year as
a candidate for the ASSU Execu
tive along with Brianna Pang 'l3.
The pair dropped out of the race
due to "several factors," DeLong
said, including other interests and
time commitments.
"We did keep endorsements in
mind," he added.
DeLong linked SOCC's clout in
endorsing ASSU candidates to Uni
versity-imposed budget cuts of
2008, which threatened funding for
campus community centers favored
by SOCC coalition members.
"I think that [SOCC's influ
ence] happens when drastic
events unfold, and the natural re
action is to ensure that you have
candidates that won't let that hap
pen again," DeLong said. "For mi
nority groups on campus, the
stakes are higher."
Having endorsed 12 of the 18
candidates this year, SOCC is

guaranteed to again have sup
ported a majority of incoming
senators. The coalition has en
dorsed Ashley Harris 'l5, Bran
den Crouch 'l4, Brandon High
tower 'l5, Christos Haveles 'l5,
Daniela Olivos 'l5, Garima Shar
ma 'l5, Ish Menjivar 'l5, Jack
Weller 'l5, Janhavi Vartak 'l5,
Kimberly Bacon 'l5, Lauren
Miller 'l5 and Nancy Pham 'l4.
SOCC-endorsed candidates
disputed the notion that they
might adjust their platform in
order to attain the endorsement,
or that they might pursue differ
ent agendas if elected.
"We've been giving the same
pitch to every endorsing group,
that whatever the ASSU is doing
should be grounded in common
sense," Zimbroff said. "That
framework of thinking is some
thing that a lot of people can get
on board with."
"SOCC doesn't change who
you are," Miller added. "They
may give you extra advice or a
better platform, but it's mainly
about individuals who are already
very motivated."
While agreeing that SOCC
endorsed senators embraced a
range of perspectives and priori
ties in this year's Senate, Senator
Ben Laufer 'l2 expressed con
cern that relationships developed
through SOCC-endorsed candi
dates' collective campaigning
meant that other senators were
denied the opportunity to access
leadership roles at the Senate's
first meetings.
Laufer also expressed concern
that the perceived significance of
a SOCC endorsement for a suc
cessful campaign has led to a can
didate pool of diminishing quali
ty, in what DeLong deemed a
"self-fulfilling prophecy."

"If you don't get a SOCC en
dorsement, there's an unfortu
nate feeling that your chances of
getting elected are much lower,"
Laufer said. "The general consen
sus if that, if you're endorsed by
SOCC, you'll get 400-500 votes.
That preconception may affect
the candidate pool, and have ad
verse consequences in terms of
getting the best possible candi
dates elected."
"I personally don't think en
dorsements are very healthy at
Stanford," Laufer added.
"There's no real correlation be
tween endorsing groups and can
didates that make that relation
ship fundamentally viable."
SOCC-endorsed candidates
expressed their desire for contin
ued interaction with SOCC, and
with other student groups,
throughout their term in office as
part of maintaining accountabili
ty to the student body.
"The important thing about
ASSU office is that you don't re
treat [from your platform]," Zim
broff said. "These groups do a lot
of great work on campus, and
those are the people that you're
representing. You have to stay in
touch with the student body as a
whole, including those groups."
The candidates also argued in
support of group endorsements
as a means of bridging the gap be
tween the ASSU and the student
body.
"Advocacy [from groups like
SOCC] gathering minority inter
ests helps create places like the
Fire Truck House and the Black
Community Services Center,"
Wagstaff said. "Those are institu
tions to benefit all students."

In recent years, perhaps no campus
group has been more influential in deter
mining the outcome of ASSU elections
than the Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC), which both endorses candidates
and offers campaign assistance.
The last three executive slates support
ed by SOCC Cruz-Macgregor-Dennis
in 2011, Cardona-Wharton in 2010 and
Avula-Jones in 2007 have been elected
to office. SOCC did not endorse executive

slates in 2008 or 2009.
Last year, 12 of 15 SOCC-endorsed can
didates were elected to the 13th Under
graduate Senate.
Candidates for the ASSU Senate and
the Executive, as well as current senators,
sat down with The Daily to discuss the sig
nificance of the SOCC endorsement for
ASSU elections as well as the ASSU's leg
islative agenda in the upcoming year.
SOCC is a coalition of six groups: the
Asian American Students' Association
(AASA), the Black Student Union (BSU),
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de

Aztlan (MEChA), the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN), the Nation
al Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP) and the Stan
ford American Indian Organization
(SAIO).
Candidates cited SOCC's extensive stu
dent network, as well as campaign experi
ence garnered by the coalition in previous
elections, as valuable assets in election sea
son.
"It gives you a base of people to work
with in terms of manpower [and]
flyering," said candidate William
Wagstaff 'l2. Robbie Zimbroff
'l2 and Wagstaff received this
year's SOCC endorsement for the
ASSU Executive.
"There's a huge difference be
tween supporters and voters,"
said Senator Dan DeLong 'l3.
"Some candidates are good at ob
taining supporters [but] SOCC is
excellent at ensuring that their
community votes."
DeLong was not endorsed by
SOCC last year. He said he did
not begin his campaign for Senate
in earnest until after the group's
deadline for candidates seeking
endorsements. DeLong sought
SOCC's endorsement this year as
a candidate for the ASSU Execu
tive along with Brianna Pang 'l3.
The pair dropped out of the race
due to "several factors," DeLong
said, including other interests and
time commitments.
"We did keep endorsements in
mind," he added.
DeLong linked SOCC's clout in
endorsing ASSU candidates to Uni
versity-imposed budget cuts of
2008, which threatened funding for
campus community centers favored
by SOCC coalition members.
"I think that [SOCC's influ
ence] happens when drastic
events unfold, and the natural re
action is to ensure that you have
candidates that won't let that hap
pen again," DeLong said. "For mi
nority groups on campus, the
stakes are higher."
Having endorsed 12 of the 18
candidates this year, SOCC is

guaranteed to again have sup
ported a majority of incoming
senators. The coalition has en
dorsed Ashley Harris 'l5, Bran
den Crouch 'l4, Brandon High
tower 'l5, Christos Haveles 'l5,
Daniela Olivos 'l5, Garima Shar
ma 'l5, Ish Menjivar 'l5, Jack
Weller 'l5, Janhavi Vartak 'l5,
Kimberly Bacon 'l5, Lauren
Miller 'l5 and Nancy Pham 'l4.
SOCC-endorsed candidates
disputed the notion that they
might adjust their platform in
order to attain the endorsement,
or that they might pursue differ
ent agendas if elected.
"We've been giving the same
pitch to every endorsing group,
that whatever the ASSU is doing
should be grounded in common
sense," Zimbroff said. "That
framework of thinking is some
thing that a lot of people can get
on board with."
"SOCC doesn't change who
you are," Miller added. "They
may give you extra advice or a
better platform, but it's mainly
about individuals who are already
very motivated."
While agreeing that SOCC
endorsed senators embraced a
range of perspectives and priori
ties in this year's Senate, Senator
Ben Laufer 'l2 expressed con
cern that relationships developed
through SOCC-endorsed candi
dates' collective campaigning
meant that other senators were
denied the opportunity to access
leadership roles at the Senate's
first meetings.
Laufer also expressed concern
that the perceived significance of
a SOCC endorsement for a suc
cessful campaign has led to a can
didate pool of diminishing quali
ty, in what DeLong deemed a
"self-fulfilling prophecy."

"If you don't get a SOCC en
dorsement, there's an unfortu
nate feeling that your chances of
getting elected are much lower,"
Laufer said. "The general consen
sus if that, if you're endorsed by
SOCC, you'll get 400-500 votes.
That preconception may affect
the candidate pool, and have ad
verse consequences in terms of
getting the best possible candi
dates elected."
"I personally don't think en
dorsements are very healthy at
Stanford," Laufer added.
"There's no real correlation be
tween endorsing groups and can
didates that make that relation
ship fundamentally viable."
SOCC-endorsed candidates
expressed their desire for contin
ued interaction with SOCC, and
with other student groups,
throughout their term in office as
part of maintaining accountabili
ty to the student body.
"The important thing about
ASSU office is that you don't re
treat [from your platform]," Zim
broff said. "These groups do a lot
of great work on campus, and
those are the people that you're
representing. You have to stay in
touch with the student body as a
whole, including those groups."
The candidates also argued in
support of group endorsements
as a means of bridging the gap be
tween the ASSU and the student
body.
"Advocacy [from groups like
SOCC] gathering minority inter
ests helps create places like the
Fire Truck House and the Black
Community Services Center,"
Wagstaff said. "Those are institu
tions to benefit all students."
