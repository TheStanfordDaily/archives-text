## Americans Elect seeks third option Group amis to expand candidate selection, move from party politics 
### AARON SEKHRI STAFF WRITER 
"What would happen if the most talented
people in the country, the politicians, the busi
ness people, the activists, the engineers, what
if all of them could run for the presidential
nomination, unaffiliated from any party?"
This question, posed by Peter Ackerman,
chairman of Americans Elect, was the focus
of a panel discussion Wednesday night enti
tled "Americans Elect: A Third Candidate in
2012" held at CEMEX Auditorium.
The GSB Government and Politics Club
and Americans Elect hosted the event while
Larry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO, direc
tor of the Stanford Center on Democracy,
Development and the Rule of Law, moderat
ed the dialogue.
The goal of the group, as described by the
Americans Elect website, is "to nominate a
presidential ticket that will answer directly to
voters not the political system."
Ackerman described Americans Elect as
not a party, but a platform for candidates not
associated with a party. He added that the vot

ing process offered by Americans Elect
could, if successful, lead to a different type of
governance and more selection among candi
dates, and that better leaders would come
from this non-partisan system.
"The last thing this country needs is a new
party," Ackerman said.
Ackerman said he experienced a lot of dif
ficulty in his efforts to make Americans Elect
a reality, which he attributed to the dedication
of the Federal Election Committee (FEC) "to
preserving a monopoly of power between the
two parties."
"History raises some formidable chal
lenges for the success of this enterprise," said
Professor David Kennedy, Pulitzer-winning
historian and director of the Bill Lane Center
for the American West. "Since the Civil War,
only in five elections has a non-traditional
candidate won any electoral votes."
Kennedy added that these candidates
have traditionally aimed to be spoilers or to
change the political agenda, and that a third
candidate would face a particularly difficult
election without a presence in lower levels of
government.
