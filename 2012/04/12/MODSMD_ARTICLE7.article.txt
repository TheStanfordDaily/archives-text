# STUDENT GOV'T

### NEEL THAKKAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For most students interested in running
for ASSU office, an essential part of the
process is seeking endorsements from var
ious on-campus students groups. These
student organizations help the candidates
they endorse by tapping their large mail
ing lists, putting up flyers, posting on Face
book and holding events to introduce the
candidates to voters.
To see what goes into the endorsement
process, The Daily contacted the leaders of
several major endorsement groups to ex
plain how they choose which candidates to
support. The Daily contacted the Women's
Coalition and the Green Alliance for In
novative Action multiple times but did not
receive a response in time for publication.

"Not everyone has the opportunity to
speak to the candidates directly," wrote
Lena Sweeney 'l2, co-president of FLIP, in
an email to The Daily. "If they trust the
leaders of FLIP, the endorsements provide
information on how candidates support
and understand the first-generation/low
income community on campus."
According to Sweeney, the group se
lects candidates by reviewing applications
submitted by candidates online. From that
pool, some of the candidates are invited
back for an interview. The FLIP leadership
team then votes on all the candidates in
terviewed to determine whether or not to
endorse them.
This year, FLIP endorsed nine candi
dates for Senate and Robbie Zimbroff 'l2
and William Wagstaff 12 for ASSU Execu
tive.
