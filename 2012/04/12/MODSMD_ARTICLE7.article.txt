# STUDENT GOV'T
## Zimbroff/Wagstaff garners support from campus groups Stanford Denis maintain support of MacGregor-Dennis/Dndhi slate 
### NEEL THAKKAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For most students interested in running
for ASSU office, an essential part of the
process is seeking endorsements from var
ious on-campus students groups. These
student organizations help the candidates
they endorse by tapping their large mail
ing lists, putting up flyers, posting on Face
book and holding events to introduce the
candidates to voters.
To see what goes into the endorsement
process, The Daily contacted the leaders of
several major endorsement groups to ex
plain how they choose which candidates to
support. The Daily contacted the Women's
Coalition and the Green Alliance for In
novative Action multiple times but did not
receive a response in time for publication.

"Not everyone has the opportunity to
speak to the candidates directly," wrote
Lena Sweeney 'l2, co-president of FLIP, in
an email to The Daily. "If they trust the
leaders of FLIP, the endorsements provide
information on how candidates support
and understand the first-generation/low
income community on campus."
According to Sweeney, the group se
lects candidates by reviewing applications
submitted by candidates online. From that
pool, some of the candidates are invited
back for an interview. The FLIP leadership
team then votes on all the candidates in
terviewed to determine whether or not to
endorse them.
This year, FLIP endorsed nine candi
dates for Senate and Robbie Zimbroff 'l2
and William Wagstaff 12 for ASSU Execu
tive.
Jewish Students' Association
(JSA)
The JSA's endorsement
process has three parts: an appli
cation, an information session and
an interview. In an email to The
Daily, Doria Charlson 'l3, who
runs the endorsement process for
the Association, wrote that the
group looks for candidates with
passion, motivation and an inter
est in having "a relationship with
members of our community and
organization."
This year, the JSA endorsed
Zimbroff-Wagstaff for the Execu
tive post, and nine others for Sen
ate positions.
Queer Coalition
The Queer Coalition looks for
candidates with a "spirit of ally
ship" with the queer community,
according to Alex Kindel 'l4, who
heads the Queer Coalition's en
dorsement effort, in an email to
The Daily. Kindel, an ASSU Sena
tor, also currently serves as ASSU
Parlementarian.
Although all of the candidates
the Coalition has chosen to en
dorse this year identify as hetero
sexual, Kindel said that they all
"showed an understanding of
queer issues and a dedication to
addressing issues that they aren't
personally affected by."
The Queer Coalition has exist
ed for four years and is composed
of representatives from various
Queer Voluntary Student Organi
zations (QVSOs), who together
interview all candidates who
apply for endorsement.
This year, a majority of the can
didates seeking election applied
for an endorsement. Of that pool,
the Coalition selected six candi
dates to endorse for Senate and
one slate Zimbroff-Wagstaff
for Executive.
Stanford Democrats
Like most of the other endors
ing organizations, the Stanford
Democrats select their endorsees
after an application and an inter
view.
In an email to the Daily, Cam
paign Director Namir Shah 'l4
wrote that the Democrats look for
candidates who "can make the
most tangible impact on the lives
of Stanford students, and not nec
essarily the candidates with the
strongest liberal leaning."
Shah wrote that no more than
half of the candidates running
typically seek out the Democrats'
endorsement. This year, a group
of four interviewers, including
Shah, selected the group's four
Senate nominees as well as their
choice for Executive, Stewart
MacGregor-Dennis 'l3 and
Druthi Ghanta 'l4.
After MacGregor-Dennis re
ceived negative attention for his
use of social media contractors,
the group reconsidered its en
dorsment up until polls opened,
ultimately deciding to stand by its
initial decision.
Stanford Review
Like the Democrats, The Re
view has a defined political
stance.
According to Editor in Chief
Nadiv Rahman 'l3, The Review
does "not seek conservative can

didates," but does support those
who are "responsible with fi
nances" and do not try to use the
ASSU as an "overreaching action
committee."
This year, The Review re
ceived endorsement applica
tions from eight prospective
Senators and three Executive
slates. After reviewing the appli
cations, The Review endorsed
four candidates for Senate and
one slate Zimbroff-Wagstaff
for Executive.
Rahman views the endorse
ments as "signaling functions,"
helping people make voting deci
sions. Still, he sees some problems.
"While we are wary, and some
times frustrated, by some particu
lar groups whose candidates seem
to have an unnatural success
rate," he wrote in an email to the
Daily, "it would be beyond a con
servative or libertarian paper to
claim that there should be in
creased supervision on who can
endorse a candidate."
The Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC)
SOCC is composed of six eth
nic community groups: the Asian
American Students' Association
(AASA), the Black Student
Union (BSU), Movimiento Estu
diantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA), the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN),
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP) and the Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO).
According to SOCC Liason

Tina Duong 'l2, about 30 candi
dates apply for SOCC endorse
ment each year, making the
group's endorsement one of the
most sought after. This year, the
group endorsed Zimbroff-
Wagstaff for Executive and 12
candidates for Undergraduate
Senate.
With only 18 candidates running
for Senate this year, SOCC is guar
anteed to have endorsed at least
nine of next year's 15 Senators.
"All Stanford students have
some vested interest in SOCC is
sues," Duong wrote in an email to
the Daily. "Our candidates are not
homogeneous in their ideals, but
they all align with SOCC values."
The Daily Editorial Board
The Stanford Daily Editorial
Board is independent from The
Stanford Daily editorial staff.
Currently, five students sit on the
board. The Editor in Chief of The
Daily chooses the Editorial Board
chair through an interview
process. The chair then selects a
number of students to the Board
by application.
The Daily Editorial Board
only endorses Executive candi
dates. This year the Board, led by
Chair Adam Johnson 'l3, en
dorsed Zimbroff-Wagstaff. Board
members Mitul Bhat 'l2, Rebecca
Johnson 'll, Peter Johnston 'l4
and Meredith Wheeler 'l4 all par
ticipated in the endorsement
process as none hold affiliations
with other endorsing bodies.

Considering endorsements, class years and campaign presence on
social media, The Daily ASSU Elections Team has predicted the above
winners for Senate. After SOCC goes 12/12, Senator Palpatine, who received
439 votes last year, will get a bump due to the smaller field.

The Queer Coalition looks for
candidates with a "spirit of ally
ship" with the queer community,
according to Alex Kindel 'l4, who
heads the Queer Coalition's en
dorsement effort, in an email to
The Daily. Kindel, an ASSU Sena
tor, also currently serves as ASSU
Parlementarian.
Although all of the candidates
the Coalition has chosen to en
dorse this year identify as hetero
sexual, Kindel said that they all
"showed an understanding of
queer issues and a dedication to
addressing issues that they aren't
personally affected by."
The Queer Coalition has exist
ed for four years and is composed
of representatives from various
Queer Voluntary Student Organi
zations (QVSOs), who together
interview all candidates who
apply for endorsement.
This year, a majority of the can
didates seeking election applied
for an endorsement. Of that pool,
the Coalition selected six candi
dates to endorse for Senate and
one slate Zimbroff-Wagstaff
for Executive.
Stanford Democrats
Like most of the other endors
ing organizations, the Stanford
Democrats select their endorsees
after an application and an inter
view.
In an email to the Daily, Cam
paign Director Namir Shah 'l4
wrote that the Democrats look for
candidates who "can make the
most tangible impact on the lives
of Stanford students, and not nec
essarily the candidates with the
strongest liberal leaning."
Shah wrote that no more than
half of the candidates running
typically seek out the Democrats'
endorsement. This year, a group
of four interviewers, including
Shah, selected the group's four
Senate nominees as well as their
choice for Executive, Stewart
MacGregor-Dennis 'l3 and
Druthi Ghanta 'l4.
After MacGregor-Dennis re
ceived negative attention for his
use of social media contractors,
the group reconsidered its en
dorsment up until polls opened,
ultimately deciding to stand by its
initial decision.
Stanford Review
Like the Democrats, The Re
view has a defined political
stance.
According to Editor in Chief
Nadiv Rahman 'l3, The Review
does "not seek conservative can

didates," but does support those
who are "responsible with fi
nances" and do not try to use the
ASSU as an "overreaching action
committee."
This year, The Review re
ceived endorsement applica
tions from eight prospective
Senators and three Executive
slates. After reviewing the appli
cations, The Review endorsed
four candidates for Senate and
one slate Zimbroff-Wagstaff
for Executive.
Rahman views the endorse
ments as "signaling functions,"
helping people make voting deci
sions. Still, he sees some problems.
"While we are wary, and some
times frustrated, by some particu
lar groups whose candidates seem
to have an unnatural success
rate," he wrote in an email to the
Daily, "it would be beyond a con
servative or libertarian paper to
claim that there should be in
creased supervision on who can
endorse a candidate."
The Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC)
SOCC is composed of six eth
nic community groups: the Asian
American Students' Association
(AASA), the Black Student
Union (BSU), Movimiento Estu
diantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA), the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN),
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP) and the Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO).
According to SOCC Liason

Tina Duong 'l2, about 30 candi
dates apply for SOCC endorse
ment each year, making the
group's endorsement one of the
most sought after. This year, the
group endorsed Zimbroff-
Wagstaff for Executive and 12
candidates for Undergraduate
Senate.
With only 18 candidates running
for Senate this year, SOCC is guar
anteed to have endorsed at least
nine of next year's 15 Senators.
"All Stanford students have
some vested interest in SOCC is
sues," Duong wrote in an email to
the Daily. "Our candidates are not
homogeneous in their ideals, but
they all align with SOCC values."
The Daily Editorial Board
The Stanford Daily Editorial
Board is independent from The
Stanford Daily editorial staff.
Currently, five students sit on the
board. The Editor in Chief of The
Daily chooses the Editorial Board
chair through an interview
process. The chair then selects a
number of students to the Board
by application.
The Daily Editorial Board
only endorses Executive candi
dates. This year the Board, led by
Chair Adam Johnson 'l3, en
dorsed Zimbroff-Wagstaff. Board
members Mitul Bhat 'l2, Rebecca
Johnson 'll, Peter Johnston 'l4
and Meredith Wheeler 'l4 all par
ticipated in the endorsement
process as none hold affiliations
with other endorsing bodies.

Considering endorsements, class years and campaign presence on
social media, The Daily ASSU Elections Team has predicted the above
winners for Senate. After SOCC goes 12/12, Senator Palpatine, who received
439 votes last year, will get a bump due to the smaller field.
For most students interested in running
for ASSU office, an essential part of the
process is seeking endorsements from var
ious on-campus students groups. These
student organizations help the candidates
they endorse by tapping their large mail
ing lists, putting up flyers, posting on Face
book and holding events to introduce the
candidates to voters.
To see what goes into the endorsement
process, The Daily contacted the leaders of
several major endorsement groups to ex
plain how they choose which candidates to
support. The Daily contacted the Women's
Coalition and the Green Alliance for In
novative Action multiple times but did not
receive a response in time for publication.

First-Generation Low Income Partner
ship (FLIP)
"Not everyone has the opportunity to
speak to the candidates directly," wrote
Lena Sweeney 'l2, co-president of FLIP, in
an email to The Daily. "If they trust the
leaders of FLIP, the endorsements provide
information on how candidates support
and understand the first-generation/low
income community on campus."
According to Sweeney, the group se
lects candidates by reviewing applications
submitted by candidates online. From that
pool, some of the candidates are invited
back for an interview. The FLIP leadership
team then votes on all the candidates in
terviewed to determine whether or not to
endorse them.
This year, FLIP endorsed nine candi
dates for Senate and Robbie Zimbroff 'l2
and William Wagstaff 12 for ASSU Execu
tive.
Jewish Students' Association
(JSA)
The JSA's endorsement
process has three parts: an appli
cation, an information session and
an interview. In an email to The
Daily, Doria Charlson 'l3, who
runs the endorsement process for
the Association, wrote that the
group looks for candidates with
passion, motivation and an inter
est in having "a relationship with
members of our community and
organization."
This year, the JSA endorsed
Zimbroff-Wagstaff for the Execu
