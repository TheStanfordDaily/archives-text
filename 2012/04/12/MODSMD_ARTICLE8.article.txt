## TEDxStanford sells out in four hours Event with Tom Brokaw, Dean Julie, to be streamed live for free 
### FELIX BOYEAUX 
Tickets to TEDxStanford, an inde
pendently organized offshoot of the well
known TED talks series, sold out in less
than four hours early Monday, leaving stu
dents without a ticket to post on Facebook
and email classmates in hopes of gaining
entrance to the May 19 event.
The event will also be streamed live
free of charge online.

"TEDxStanford was not one person's
idea, but rather an idea that blossomed
after numerous students and alumni
began discussing it," said Melinda Sacks,
director of media initiatives at Stanford
and producer of TEDxStanford. "The Of
fice of Public Affairs is producing the
event in partnership with the Graduate
School of Business and the School of En
gineering."
A similar prototype event, STAN (Sci
ence, Technology, Art and Nature), was
produced last year at Stanford in
order to test the concept of short
talks interspersed with perform
ances.
"It was a great success," Sacks
said. "TEDxStanford was the nat
ural next step."
TEDxStanford with the
theme this year of "Illumination"
will feature performances
from Stanford Taiko and 14-year
old cello prodigy Ila Shon, as well
as talks by speakers including
Tom Brokaw, former anchor and
managing editor of "NBC Nightly
News," Dean of Freshmen and
Undergraduate Advising Julie
Lythcott-Haims 'B9 and Jason
Mayden, director of innovation at
Nike, Inc.
"We are lucky that Stanford
has so many wonderful stories to
tell, such a variety of exciting, cut
ting-edge research underway and
compelling speakers and perform
ers from every school, department
and center," Sacks said, adding
that the only real problem while
organizing the event was narrow
ing down which speakers and
groups to include in the program.
"It's not a bad problem to
have," she said.
As opposed to the majority of
other TEDx events, for which in
vitations are by application, the

580 available seats in Cemex Au
ditorium at the Knight Manage
ment Center were distributed on
a first-come, first-served basis,
with tickets allocated evenly be
tween students, faculty and gen
eral admission.
Tickets cost $35 for students,
$69 for faculty and staff and $99
for general admission.
Revenue from ticket sales will
be the primary source of financial
support for the event. Partner
ships with the Graduate School of
Business and the School of Engi
neering will help fund the
TEDxStanford showcase and re
ception. Perkins Coie LLC and
Ridge Winery also contributed fi
nancing to the event.
A team of nine undergradu
ates assisted the professional staff
in planning the event.
"I am pretty confident we will
be able to do it well," said Jay
Patel 'l4, co-chair of the student
organizing committee. "There are
obviously so many challenges to
overcome, people losing their
way and everything, but we can
do it."
Nick Ahamed 'l5 was one of
the lucky few to claim a ticket.
"I am really excited to be
going, but I feel bad that other
people couldn't go," Ahamed
said. "I am most excited about
seeing the 14-year old cellist and
Tom Brokaw."
