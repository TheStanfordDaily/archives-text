Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center
326 Galvez Street
STANFORD UNIVERSITY
Stanford experts from a range of disciplines will discuss the nexus
interconnecting humanity's needs for the use of water, food, energy, and the
environment. Drawing on their own research, the speakers will illustrate and
evaluate some of the ways in which decisions in one resource area can lead
to trade-offs or co-benefits in others. We will examine sustainable freshwater
resources and uses in Africa, Asia, and the arid West. Symposium attendees
will participate in breakout sessions, led by Stanford students and faculty,
on a range of challenges associated with sustainable freshwater.
