# HOME AT LAST
## CARD READY TO HOST DUCKS 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
It's been almost a month since
the No. 6 Stanford baseball team
hosted a weekend series, but with
No. 16 Oregon coming to town for
a three-game set at Sunken Dia
mond, the squad is playing some
of its best baseball at just the right
time, riding a three-game win
streak into tonight's opener.
That said, the Ducks have won
six of their last seven and are fresh
off an impressive series win
against No. 17 UCLA.
Having played just two of its
last nine contests on the Farm, the
Cardinal (21-7,4-5 Pac-12) will fi
nally have a chance to improve on
its 14-2 home record with seven
straight matchups at Sunken Dia
mond against Oregon (21-9, 8-4),
San Jose State and No. 21 Arizona
State. Those previous home wins
were fueled by Stanford's high
powered offense, which cooled off
some what during spring break but
has come back with three big
games in a row: an 8-6 win over
Washington, a 19-6 victory over
Cal and an 8-3 win over Pacific.
Leading the charge has been
sophomore first baseman Brian
Ragira, who is currently riding a
13-game hit streak and is one of
two Stanford starters hitting
above .300.
"I think I've been a little more
consistent early on this year than I
was last year," said Ragira, who
was named the 2011 Pac-12 Fresh
man of the Year with his .329,46-
RBI performance a year ago. "I
feel pretty good about it."
Ragira's not the only Cardinal
infielder with a hot bat, with junior
catcher Eric Smith hitting .366 and
third baseman Stephen Piscotty

totaling 34 RBI so far this season.
That type of hitting has been com
ing early in games, as Stanford has
jumped out to at least a three-run
lead through three innings in its
three consecutive wins.
According to Ragira, getting
on the board right away is going to
be important this weekend, as the
Cardinal by and large failed to do
so in its series loss to the Ducks in
Eugene a year ago.
"I think just scoring early and
playing good defense [are going to
be key]," he said. "Our pitching is
going to be good with Mark and
Mooney."
Oregon is going to be hard
pressed to score runs against Stan
ford's two stellar junior starters,
righthander Mark Appel and left
hander Brett Mooneyham. By no
means one of the best-hitting
teams in the conference, the
Ducks had a team batting average
of just .261 as of Monday, a mark
that doesn't even crack the top 200
nationally.
But questions have emerged
surrounding the Cardinal's Sun
day starter, a position that could
be earned by either freshman
John Hochstatter or sophomore
A.J. Vanegas. Hochstatter im
pressed with an early-season 3-0
record, but has dropped three
straight decisions and yielded the
starting spot to his fellow righty
last weekend against Washington.
Vanegas pitched well for his
first win of the season against the
Huskies, giving up just one earned
run in his six innings of work and
giving Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess all the more reason to
give him another look.
The Ducks will send out a pair
of righties to open the series in
senior Alex Keudel and freshman

Jake Reed. The duo has combined
for a 2.26 ERA and a 7-5 record,
and Oregon has won the first two
games in all of their last three se
ries with Keudel and Reed on the
mound.
To counter those hurlers the
Cardinal will need the same top
to-bottom offensive production
that it has been getting recently,
even with Marquess making
minor shifts to the batting order
and at designated hitter over the
last few weeks.
"It's good that we've got all this
momentum going into that series,"

said junior shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger, who had two doubles
and a solo homer in the squad's 8-
3 win over Pacific on Wednesday.
"Hopefully we can keep it."
Tonight's opener is scheduled
for 5:30 p.m. but with rain a possi
bility nothing is for certain, as the
Pacific game was postponed a day
to account for the weather.
Saturday's game begins at 1
p.m., with the Sunday finale set for
noon.

so in its series loss to the Ducks in
Eugene a year ago.
"I think just scoring early and
playing good defense [are going to
be key]," he said. "Our pitching is
going to be good with Mark and
Mooney."
Oregon is going to be hard
pressed to score runs against Stan
ford's two stellar junior starters,
righthander Mark Appel and left
hander Brett Mooneyham. By no
means one of the best-hitting
teams in the conference, the
Ducks had a team batting average
of just .261 as of Monday, a mark
that doesn't even crack the top 200
nationally.
But questions have emerged
surrounding the Cardinal's Sun
day starter, a position that could
be earned by either freshman
John Hochstatter or sophomore
A.J. Vanegas. Hochstatter im
pressed with an early-season 3-0
record, but has dropped three
straight decisions and yielded the
starting spot to his fellow righty
last weekend against Washington.
Vanegas pitched well for his
first win of the season against the
Huskies, giving up just one earned
run in his six innings of work and
giving Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess all the more reason to
give him another look.
The Ducks will send out a pair
of righties to open the series in
senior Alex Keudel and freshman

Jake Reed. The duo has combined
for a 2.26 ERA and a 7-5 record,
and Oregon has won the first two
games in all of their last three se
ries with Keudel and Reed on the
mound.
To counter those hurlers the
Cardinal will need the same top
to-bottom offensive production
that it has been getting recently,
even with Marquess making
minor shifts to the batting order
and at designated hitter over the
last few weeks.
"It's good that we've got all this
momentum going into that series,"

said junior shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger, who had two doubles
and a solo homer in the squad's 8-
3 win over Pacific on Wednesday.
"Hopefully we can keep it."
Tonight's opener is scheduled
for 5:30 p.m. but with rain a possi
bility nothing is for certain, as the
Pacific game was postponed a day
to account for the weather.
Saturday's game begins at 1
p.m., with the Sunday finale set for
noon.

Sophomore first baseman Brian Ragira (above) is currently riding a 13
game hit streak as the No. 6 Stanford baseball squad is ready for a
three-game homestand series against No. 16 Oregon starting tonight.
It's been almost a month since
the No. 6 Stanford baseball team
hosted a weekend series, but with
No. 16 Oregon coming to town for
a three-game set at Sunken Dia
mond, the squad is playing some
of its best baseball at just the right
time, riding a three-game win
streak into tonight's opener.
That said, the Ducks have won
six of their last seven and are fresh
off an impressive series win
against No. 17 UCLA.
Having played just two of its
last nine contests on the Farm, the
Cardinal (21-7,4-5 Pac-12) will fi
nally have a chance to improve on
its 14-2 home record with seven
straight matchups at Sunken Dia
mond against Oregon (21-9, 8-4),
San Jose State and No. 21 Arizona
State. Those previous home wins
were fueled by Stanford's high
powered offense, which cooled off
some what during spring break but
has come back with three big
games in a row: an 8-6 win over
Washington, a 19-6 victory over
Cal and an 8-3 win over Pacific.
Leading the charge has been
sophomore first baseman Brian
Ragira, who is currently riding a
13-game hit streak and is one of
two Stanford starters hitting
above .300.
"I think I've been a little more
consistent early on this year than I
was last year," said Ragira, who
was named the 2011 Pac-12 Fresh
man of the Year with his .329,46-
RBI performance a year ago. "I
feel pretty good about it."
Ragira's not the only Cardinal
infielder with a hot bat, with junior
catcher Eric Smith hitting .366 and
third baseman Stephen Piscotty

totaling 34 RBI so far this season.
That type of hitting has been com
ing early in games, as Stanford has
jumped out to at least a three-run
lead through three innings in its
three consecutive wins.
According to Ragira, getting
on the board right away is going to
be important this weekend, as the
Cardinal by and large failed to do
so in its series loss to the Ducks in
Eugene a year ago.
"I think just scoring early and
playing good defense [are going to
be key]," he said. "Our pitching is
going to be good with Mark and
Mooney."
