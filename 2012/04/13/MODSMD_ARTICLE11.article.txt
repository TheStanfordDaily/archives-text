# TAKING A PEEK

### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
In its final performance before the 2012 sea
son, the Stanford football team takes to the field
at San Francisco's historic Kezar Stadium on
Saturday in its annual Cardinal-White Spring
Game.
While the season is still six months away, the
Stanford coaches are hoping that Saturday's in
trasquad contest will help settle several critical
position battles before fall training camp, and
provide some continuity for the Cardinal head
ing into the 2012 season.
Naturally, all eyes are on the quarterback
competition, where redshirt junior Josh Nunes
and sophomore Brett Nottingham have
emerged as the leaders to take over Andrew
Luck's job. The two quarterbacks will split snaps
with the first team offense on Saturday, while
freshmen Kevin Hogan and Evan Crower will
work with the second team offense. Both Not
tingham and Nunes have impressed so far in the
two spring sessions not only with their physical
skills, but also with their ability to use audibles
to command the offense in a fashion similar to
Luck.
Behind Nunes and Nottingham, several run
ning backs will also have a chance to fight their
way into the starting lineup for next season, par
ticularly sophomore Ricky Seale and freshman
Kelsey Young. With sophomore Anthony Wilk
erson injured and junior Tyler Gaffney taking
his talents to the baseball field for the duration
of spring, Seale has carried the ball well enough
to be the likely successor to Jeremy Stewart as
the final piece of the four-back rotation that led
the Cardinal to two consecutive BCS bowls.
Meanwhile, Young has also carried the ball and
worked out of the backfield as a receiver as well,
making him a versatile option for the Cardinal
offense to exploit, especially with a lack of depth
at wide receiver.
Perhaps the most unclear position group this
spring is the offensive line, which could remain
in flux until the beginning of the 2012 season.
While juniors Kevin Danser and Khalil Wilkes

have been battling for the right guard spot and
sophomore Cole Underwood has squared off
with redshirt freshman Brendon Austin for the
all-important left tackle role, any leaders that
might emerge from this spring could be overtak
en by one of several players among the nation's
best recruiting class of offensive linemen.
On the outside, Stanford will be searching for
a starter across from freshman Ty Montgomery,
who has been participating in the second session
of spring practice while recovering from a hand
injury suffered during the first session of spring.
Young will square off with Drew Terrell and
Jamal-Rashad Patterson, who have been playing
with the first team offense all spring.
On the other side of the ball, the Cardinal de
fense will be looking for starters along the de
fensive line and in the backfield, and will once
again be without injured star linebacker Shayne
Skov, who is still recovering from a knee injury

he sustained last September.
Along the line, the replace
ment for graduating senior Matt
Masifilo will likely be either jun
ior Josh Mauro or sophomore
Henry Anderson, who both
bring 6-foot-6, 275-pound
frames to the competition. Both

played a small amount in relief
of Masifilo and redshirt junior
Ben Gardner last season, but the
two have played so well this
spring that they could possibly
overtake Gardner's spot at a
starter.
In the defensive backfield, a
rotation of players will look to
take over the spots of three de
parting starters, including fresh
man Wayne Lyons and sopho
more Ed Reynolds, both of
whom missed last season with in

juries. Lyons looks to be the
leader to take over Johnson
Bademosi's spot at cornerback,
which was expected out of a
player who was rated as the na
tion's sixth-best safety coming
out of high school just a year ago.
Reynolds, who Shaw said was
the spring's best safety so far, is a
surprise contender to take over
one of the starting safety spots,
as he seemed likely to be buried
behind Jordan Richards and
Devon Carrington, both of
whom saw significant playing
time last season while Reynolds
was sidelined by a knee injury.
While all of these spots are
open, and could continue to
change when the nation's fifth
best recruiting class comes to
the Farm this fall, Saturday's
Cardinal-White game in San
Francisco could go a long way to
tipping off fans and more im
portantly, the Cardinal coaching
staff as to which players will
be suiting up for the first Stan
ford squad in the post-Andrew
Luck era.
The Cardinal (and White) will
take the field at San Francisco's
Kezar Stadium at 2 p.m. on Satur
day.

Along the line, the replace
ment for graduating senior Matt
Masifilo will likely be either jun
ior Josh Mauro or sophomore
Henry Anderson, who both
bring 6-foot-6, 275-pound
frames to the competition. Both

played a small amount in relief
of Masifilo and redshirt junior
Ben Gardner last season, but the
two have played so well this
spring that they could possibly
overtake Gardner's spot at a
starter.
In the defensive backfield, a
rotation of players will look to
take over the spots of three de
parting starters, including fresh
man Wayne Lyons and sopho
more Ed Reynolds, both of
whom missed last season with in

juries. Lyons looks to be the
leader to take over Johnson
Bademosi's spot at cornerback,
which was expected out of a
player who was rated as the na
tion's sixth-best safety coming
out of high school just a year ago.
Reynolds, who Shaw said was
the spring's best safety so far, is a
surprise contender to take over
one of the starting safety spots,
as he seemed likely to be buried
behind Jordan Richards and
Devon Carrington, both of
whom saw significant playing
time last season while Reynolds
was sidelined by a knee injury.
While all of these spots are
open, and could continue to
change when the nation's fifth
best recruiting class comes to
the Farm this fall, Saturday's
Cardinal-White game in San
Francisco could go a long way to
tipping off fans and more im
portantly, the Cardinal coaching
staff as to which players will
be suiting up for the first Stan
ford squad in the post-Andrew
Luck era.
The Cardinal (and White) will
take the field at San Francisco's
Kezar Stadium at 2 p.m. on Satur

In its final performance before the 2012 sea
son, the Stanford football team takes to the field
at San Francisco's historic Kezar Stadium on
Saturday in its annual Cardinal-White Spring
Game.
While the season is still six months away, the
Stanford coaches are hoping that Saturday's in
trasquad contest will help settle several critical
position battles before fall training camp, and
provide some continuity for the Cardinal head
ing into the 2012 season.
Naturally, all eyes are on the quarterback
competition, where redshirt junior Josh Nunes
and sophomore Brett Nottingham have
emerged as the leaders to take over Andrew
Luck's job. The two quarterbacks will split snaps
with the first team offense on Saturday, while
freshmen Kevin Hogan and Evan Crower will
work with the second team offense. Both Not
tingham and Nunes have impressed so far in the
two spring sessions not only with their physical
skills, but also with their ability to use audibles
to command the offense in a fashion similar to
Luck.
Behind Nunes and Nottingham, several run
ning backs will also have a chance to fight their
way into the starting lineup for next season, par
ticularly sophomore Ricky Seale and freshman
Kelsey Young. With sophomore Anthony Wilk
erson injured and junior Tyler Gaffney taking
his talents to the baseball field for the duration
of spring, Seale has carried the ball well enough
to be the likely successor to Jeremy Stewart as
the final piece of the four-back rotation that led
the Cardinal to two consecutive BCS bowls.
Meanwhile, Young has also carried the ball and
worked out of the backfield as a receiver as well,
making him a versatile option for the Cardinal
offense to exploit, especially with a lack of depth
at wide receiver.
Perhaps the most unclear position group this
spring is the offensive line, which could remain
in flux until the beginning of the 2012 season.
While juniors Kevin Danser and Khalil Wilkes

have been battling for the right guard spot and
sophomore Cole Underwood has squared off
with redshirt freshman Brendon Austin for the
all-important left tackle role, any leaders that
might emerge from this spring could be overtak
en by one of several players among the nation's
best recruiting class of offensive linemen.
On the outside, Stanford will be searching for
a starter across from freshman Ty Montgomery,
who has been participating in the second session
of spring practice while recovering from a hand
injury suffered during the first session of spring.
Young will square off with Drew Terrell and
Jamal-Rashad Patterson, who have been playing
with the first team offense all spring.
On the other side of the ball, the Cardinal de
fense will be looking for starters along the de
fensive line and in the backfield, and will once
again be without injured star linebacker Shayne
Skov, who is still recovering from a knee injury
