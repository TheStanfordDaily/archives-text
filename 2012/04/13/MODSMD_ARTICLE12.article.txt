# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Seniors hope to end strong 
### DANIEL LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
The emotions promise to run
high in Maples Pavilion this week
end, as the seniors on the Stanford
men's volleyball team will play their
final two matches at home and have
a chance to end their storied careers
in style.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal (18-6,
15-5 MPSF) will take on the UC-
Santa Barbara Gauchos (7-17, 5-
15) on Friday night before squaring
off against No. 3 UCLA (21-6,15-5)
on Saturday in a match that has
major conference tournament
seeding ramifications. In addition to
Saturday being Senior Night, a trib
ute will be held for UCLA head
coach A1 Scales, who is coaching the
final regular season match of his ca
reer after 50 years at the helm of the
Bruin program.
The winningest senior class in
Stanford history, with a career
record of 82-32, will hope to send
off its seven members with a proper
tribute and a win against the rival
Bruins on Saturday. UCLA comes
into Maples Pavilion on the heels of
a disappointing and controversial
loss to BYU, one that knocked
them out of control of the race for
the top seed in the upcoming
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion (MPSF) tournament. The Bru
ins appeared to have won the
match, but that decision was over
turned after officials reviewed the
final two points and decided them
in favor of BYU.
Needless to say, UCLA will be
hungry and motivated when it
takes the court, not just because of
the loss, but also in honor of its
coach. Scales, who is considered
perhaps the greatest men's colle
giate volleyball coach ever, has led
UCLA to 21 national champi
onships.
But in order to set the stage for
the matchup with the Bruins, the
Cardinal must first take care of
business on Friday. Stanford can't
afford to lose focus against UCSB,
who stunned No. 4 BYU on the
road earlier this season. The Gau
chos, who were the national run
ners-up a season ago, are winners of
two in a row, following a sweep of
Hawaii last week. They are led by
junior Miles Evans and freshman
Kevin Donohue, who average 3.49
and 2.73 kills per set, respectively.
Should the Cardinal get past the
Gauchos unscathed, a tall order
stands ahead of them on Saturday
against UCLA. Stanford took per
haps its most lopsided loss earlier
this season in Westwood, falling to
the Bruins in straight sets and pro
viding little resistance. If things are
going to be any different this time
around, Stanford's seven seniors,
four of them starters, will have to
set the tone.
Outside hitter Brad Lawson is a
two-time All-American, National
Player of the Year candidate, the
school record holder in career aces
and the 2010 co-MVP of the
NCAA tournament. His 13 kills
against UCLA in January easily led
the team, and he will have to play
well for Stanford to find success.

"This past week of practice has
been the most fun week yet just be
cause I've finally started to realize
how little time remains and that I
need to just enjoy each moment,"
Lawson said.
"As far as UCLA goes, it's quite
obviously going to be huge for us,"
Lawson admitted. "If we get hot
and play like we have been this
week in practice, I don't think
there's a team in the MPSF that we
can't contend with."
Lawson is not the only senior
All-American on Stanford's roster.
Libero Erik Shoji is already a
three-time All-American, the
school and national record holder
for digs in a career and in a season,
and the reigning MPSF player of
the week after tallying 43 digs in
Stanford's three matches last week.
Possibly the best libero in collegiate
history, he will be crucial in
stymieing UCLA's efficient attack,
which hits .334 as a team, good
enough for third in the nation.
Setter Evan Barry is a two-year
starter and the national leader in
assists per set. Fie is an All-Ameri
can candidate himself.
Middle Blocker Gus Ellis is a
four-year starter who is just three
blocks away from breaking the
school's all time blocks record. Fie,
Lawson and Shoji are the three
starters who remain from Stan
ford's national championship team
in 2010.
Dylan Kordic, Charley Henrik
son and Jake Vandermeer have all
been used more sparingly through
out their Cardinal careers, but each
has made important contributions
to the Farm during their years here.
The final chance to salute Stan
ford's seniors will be at 7 p.m. on
Friday, against UCSB, and again at
7 p.m. on Saturday against UCLA.
