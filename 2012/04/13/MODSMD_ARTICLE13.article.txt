# MEN'S TENNIS
## Cardinal prepares to take on Bruins, Trojans 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
On the heels of a rained-out Tuesday
match against San Francisco, the No. 11
Stanford men's tennis team now faces a pair
of marquee matchups as it heads into one of
toughest and most important weekends of
the season.
The Cardinal (14-5,4-0 Pac-12) is taking a
road trip down to Los Angeles to face No. 6
UCLA (18-2,4-0) on Friday and No. 1 USC
(23-0,4-0) the next day.These pivotal match
es mark the final stretch of the regular sea
son as the inaugural Pac-12 Championship is
less than two weeks away.

The last time Stanford met the two
Southern California foes in early February,
the Cardinal was swept by USC, 7-0, and
then fell to UCLA, 6-1. The team was play
ing without star player Bradley Klahn in
both of the losses, crippling both the singles
and doubles lineups. The blowouts luckily
did not count towards the team's conference
record, but losing on home court certainly
fueled Cardinal in trying to redeem itself.
Since losing those two matches, Stanford
has rebounded by winning critical games
against tough opponents. A few weeks after
the lopsided losses, the Cardinal defeated
then-No. 6 Kentucky and then-No. 7 Baylor
at the National Team Indoor Champi

onships in February. Stanford then followed
up the impressive showing with a dominant
6-1 win over then-No. 13 Cal.
But even with Klahn back on Stanford's
roster, winning any of the two upcoming
matches will be no easy task for the Cardi
nal. UCLA has three singles players who are
ranked in the national top 120, with senior
Nick Meister leading the Bruins at No. 32. As
for doubles play, the duo of Meister and
sophomore Adrien Puget are ranked in the
top 50.
USC will most likely prove to be even
tougher to beat as the Trojans have been
crowned the national champions
the past three seasons and are
carrying a 43-match winning
streak. The fact that USC has
three singles players ranked in
the top 20 and five singles players
in the top 60 is a testament to the
team's depth. Among the talent
loaded Trojans lineup is defend
ing NCAA singles champion
Steve Johnson, who is ranked
second in the nation. Just as for
midable is USC's doubles lineup,
which consists of three doubles
teams that are ranked in the top
20 in the country.
Not to be outdone, Stanford
currently boasts two top-50 sin
gles players in No. 30 Ryan
Thacher and No. 46 Bradley
Klahn, who has been playing
and playing well despite a lin
gering back injury. The Cardinal
also appears in the national rank
ings in doubles play, with the duo
of Klahn and Thacher ranked

fifth while the team of Thacher
and freshman John Morrissey,
who stepped in for Klahn while
he was injured, ranks in the top
60.
The Cardinal has been play
ing well recently, sweeping both
Oregon and Washington in 7-0
victories last weekend as part of
Pac-12 play.
With only two weeks left in
the regular season, it's all the
more important for the team to
keep its conference record per
fect. Victories over elite teams
such as UCLA and USC are crit
ical in providing the Cardinal
with momentum for the postsea
son. The team's overall perform
ance down the stretch will cer
tainly have major implications
for its confidence heading into
the Pac-12 Championship and
eventually the NCAA tourna
ment in early May.
The Cardinal will face the
Bruins at 1:30 p.m. on Friday and
then battle the Trojans at 1:00 p.m.
on Saturday.
