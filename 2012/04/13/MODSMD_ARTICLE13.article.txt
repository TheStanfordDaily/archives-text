## Cardinal prepares to take on Bruins, Trojans 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
On the heels of a rained-out Tuesday
match against San Francisco, the No. 11
Stanford men's tennis team now faces a pair
of marquee matchups as it heads into one of
toughest and most important weekends of
the season.
The Cardinal (14-5,4-0 Pac-12) is taking a
road trip down to Los Angeles to face No. 6
UCLA (18-2,4-0) on Friday and No. 1 USC
(23-0,4-0) the next day.These pivotal match
es mark the final stretch of the regular sea
son as the inaugural Pac-12 Championship is
less than two weeks away.

The last time Stanford met the two
Southern California foes in early February,
the Cardinal was swept by USC, 7-0, and
then fell to UCLA, 6-1. The team was play
ing without star player Bradley Klahn in
both of the losses, crippling both the singles
and doubles lineups. The blowouts luckily
did not count towards the team's conference
record, but losing on home court certainly
fueled Cardinal in trying to redeem itself.
Since losing those two matches, Stanford
has rebounded by winning critical games
against tough opponents. A few weeks after
the lopsided losses, the Cardinal defeated
then-No. 6 Kentucky and then-No. 7 Baylor
at the National Team Indoor Champi

onships in February. Stanford then followed
up the impressive showing with a dominant
6-1 win over then-No. 13 Cal.
But even with Klahn back on Stanford's
roster, winning any of the two upcoming
matches will be no easy task for the Cardi
nal. UCLA has three singles players who are
ranked in the national top 120, with senior
Nick Meister leading the Bruins at No. 32. As
for doubles play, the duo of Meister and
sophomore Adrien Puget are ranked in the
top 50.
USC will most likely prove to be even
tougher to beat as the Trojans have been
