## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR 
### 
Dear Readers,
Campus dialogue hit a low this
week, disintegrating to a point un
precedented in my time at Stan
ford. For at least one student, this
University stopped being home.
We must not stand by a culture
that engenders attacks levied
against students by anonymous
peers. Those who think they are
providing a public service by traf
ficking in the most mean-spirited of
remarks are woefully mistaken.
Such violations of the Fundamen
tal Standard should be investigated

and duly addressed.
What troubles me the most
about the past 36 hours is the
marked absence of kindness. I am
shocked by the extremes reached
on campus this week, and I know
most Stanford students are, as well.
Our actions, our language, our
daily choices matter greatly. This
week's events must be addressed
and should never repeated.
Sincerely,

MARGARET RAWSON
President and Editor in Chief,
Vol. CCXLI
