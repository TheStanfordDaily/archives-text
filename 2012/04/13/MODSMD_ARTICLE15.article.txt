## Co-ops at Stanford 
### 
One of the perennial criti
cisms of life at Stanford is
the lack of community in
non-tier one housing, a criticism
that perhaps overlooks the good
fortune of guaranteed on-cam
pus housing in a very expensive
area with limited public trans
portation options. With the Hous
ing Draw now open, students can
rank the sixty-plus different
dorms, self-operated houses, and
cooperatively-operated houses.
A majority of students will ignore
the co-ops, writing them off as
"hippie housing." Given this rep
utation, the Editorial Board
would like to highlight coopera
tive housing as one of the best op
tions available, as it brings togeth
er desirable aspects of other
housing on campus.
Stanford's seven co-ops vary
considerably in size and culture.
If they do share a certain "some
thing," it is perhaps a common
pride in their cooperatively-oper
ated culture. This, however, is not
something to be written off. The
lessons in cooperatively manag
ing a house are manifold, from
learning how to delegate tasks or
follow directions in the kitchen to
the risks of free-ridership. The
few hours a week students put in
to cook, hash or clean bathrooms
offer valuable life lessons. Every
Stanford student will eventually
live independently after gradua
tion, and aside from teaching do
mestic skills, co-ops offer the
chance to learn how to more ef
fectively manage and work with
other people in a non-profession
al situation. These lessons are, of
course, not unique to co-ops. To
some extent students learn how
to live with others from their first
roommate experience freshman
year, and some students choose
to live independently while at
Stanford in Mirrielees or Rains.
At other schools without four
year housing guarantees, it is
even more common for students
to live independently and they
learn many of the same lessons
that co-ops offer.

What independent living does
not offer, however, is the sense of
community found in co-ops. Per
haps even more than freshman
dorms and self-operated houses,
co-ops have distinct personalities.
This is not to say that co-ops all
have the same community (stu
dents choosing to live in Terra
may well rather live in a self-op or
dorm than in Kairos or Colum
bae, and vice versa). Instead, they
engender feelings of belonging
among those choosing to live
there. This is partly due to the size
of the house it is far easier to
get to know everyone in a 40-per
son house than in a dorm with 200
people but it also has to do
with shared experiences. In a
freshman dorm, shared activities
bring everyone closer together
despite differences in personali
ties and interests, and the shared
experience of putting in the work
to keep the co-op running
smoothly has the same effect.
Co-ops, then, offer a best-of
both-worlds combination of the
closeness of freshman year and
the lessons of independent living
that we will all need to draw upon
post-Stanford. The decision by
Housing to require use of Tier 2
Housing for a year in a co-op is
perhaps a reflection of the inher
ent desirability of living in a co
op. Given their increasing popu
larity, the Editorial Board be
lieves housing should, if feasible,
consider creating additional co
ops on campus.
It is true that the subcultures
of the Stanford co-ops are not for
everyone, but this is not to say
that co-ops themselves are objec
tionable. If anything, more stu
dents choosing to live in co-ops
would allow for more diversity in
the cultures of co-ops. Students
who might not otherwise consid
er a co-op should think twice, re
alizing that a year in a co-op will
leave them more prepared for
the real world, both in the practi
cal skills they will have gained
and in the relationships they will
have made along the way.

One of the perennial criti
cisms of life at Stanford is
the lack of community in
non-tier one housing, a criticism
that perhaps overlooks the good
fortune of guaranteed on-cam
pus housing in a very expensive
area with limited public trans
portation options. With the Hous
ing Draw now open, students can
rank the sixty-plus different
dorms, self-operated houses, and
cooperatively-operated houses.
A majority of students will ignore
the co-ops, writing them off as
"hippie housing." Given this rep
utation, the Editorial Board
would like to highlight coopera
tive housing as one of the best op
tions available, as it brings togeth
er desirable aspects of other
housing on campus.
Stanford's seven co-ops vary
considerably in size and culture.
If they do share a certain "some
thing," it is perhaps a common
pride in their cooperatively-oper
ated culture. This, however, is not
something to be written off. The
lessons in cooperatively manag
ing a house are manifold, from
learning how to delegate tasks or
follow directions in the kitchen to
the risks of free-ridership. The
few hours a week students put in
to cook, hash or clean bathrooms
offer valuable life lessons. Every
Stanford student will eventually
live independently after gradua
tion, and aside from teaching do
mestic skills, co-ops offer the
chance to learn how to more ef
fectively manage and work with
other people in a non-profession
al situation. These lessons are, of
course, not unique to co-ops. To
some extent students learn how
to live with others from their first
roommate experience freshman
year, and some students choose
to live independently while at
Stanford in Mirrielees or Rains.
At other schools without four
year housing guarantees, it is
even more common for students
to live independently and they
learn many of the same lessons
that co-ops offer.

What independent living does
not offer, however, is the sense of
community found in co-ops. Per
haps even more than freshman
dorms and self-operated houses,
co-ops have distinct personalities.
This is not to say that co-ops all
have the same community (stu
dents choosing to live in Terra
may well rather live in a self-op or
dorm than in Kairos or Colum
bae, and vice versa). Instead, they
engender feelings of belonging
among those choosing to live
there. This is partly due to the size
of the house it is far easier to
get to know everyone in a 40-per
son house than in a dorm with 200
people but it also has to do
with shared experiences. In a
freshman dorm, shared activities
bring everyone closer together
despite differences in personali
ties and interests, and the shared
experience of putting in the work
to keep the co-op running
smoothly has the same effect.
Co-ops, then, offer a best-of
both-worlds combination of the
closeness of freshman year and
the lessons of independent living
that we will all need to draw upon
post-Stanford. The decision by
Housing to require use of Tier 2
Housing for a year in a co-op is
perhaps a reflection of the inher
ent desirability of living in a co
op. Given their increasing popu
larity, the Editorial Board be
lieves housing should, if feasible,
consider creating additional co
ops on campus.
It is true that the subcultures
of the Stanford co-ops are not for
everyone, but this is not to say
that co-ops themselves are objec
tionable. If anything, more stu
dents choosing to live in co-ops
would allow for more diversity in
the cultures of co-ops. Students
who might not otherwise consid
er a co-op should think twice, re
alizing that a year in a co-op will
leave them more prepared for
the real world, both in the practi
cal skills they will have gained
and in the relationships they will
have made along the way.
