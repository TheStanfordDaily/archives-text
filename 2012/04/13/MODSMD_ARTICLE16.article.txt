# OP-ED
## Why we are all responsible 
### MICHAEL CRUZ '12 ASSU President 2011-12 
This op-ed is in response to
the recent discussions by
the Stanford student body
surrounding Stewart MacGregor-
Dennis 'l3, a candidate for ASSU
Executive and the current ASSU
Vice President. I am glad that the
overwhelming statements and
comments that I have received
have been in opposition to the re
cent "Star Wars"-related email
and its deeply personal attacks
against Stewart.
Historically, Stanford student
body politics have not been per
sonal. When the Stanford student
body has had a disagreement, the
disagreement has usually been on
an issue of substance, whether on
ROTC, stipends, or ASSU-Univer
sity relations, disagreements have

usually been played out in well
thought and well-researched argu
ment. I am sad to say that I can no
longer praise the Stanford student
body and its rich civic dialogue; we
have descended into petty rehash
ings of who tweeted what.
However, we are all culpable for
that email, and any negative conse
quences it may have. All of this
Stewart-bashing started out rela
tively harmless; I'll admit, I defi
nitely smh'd at the lifehacking op
ed as well. Nevertheless, every sin
gle time that we joked about Stew
art made it more okay for someone
else to push the joking a little bit
further. While only some Stanford
students were directly involved in
sending these attacks, we are all re
sponsible for having created a
Stanford community where it was
okay to personally criticize another
student publicly. Someone took it
to another level one where per
sonal attacks on another student's

mental health were publicized for
the campus to see.
In the future, I ask us, the Stan
ford student body, to reflect on
our actions before we take them.
As a school of some of the
smartest and most driven individ
uals in the nation, many of us have
been bullied at some time or an
other. I was bullied often as a
child; my family and friends
helped me through that period of
my life, but that didn't make it any
easier. Our actions have conse
quences and our words matter.
Please consider the negative psy
chological impact that what you
say can have on someone else.
Thank you for your time and
this chance to serve you. It has been
an honor to serve the Stanford stu
dent body, and I wish the best of
luck to whoever succeeds me.
