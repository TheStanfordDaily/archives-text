# MARKS MY WORDS
## A 						time for introductions 
### Miriam Marks 
Imagine yourself having a long
awaited, intimate chat with a
friend. You could be anywhere
at a party, walking to class or
even in line at the CoHo to pick up
a hot cup of ChaiX (a caffeinated
concoction that blends a shot of
espresso into a chai tea latte). You
and your friend are happily catch
ing up on classes, love lives and
other gossip.
Suddenly your friend looks past
you and shrieks, "Oh my GOD I
haven't seen you in forever!"
You're puzzled until, turning
around, you realize that this excla
mation wasn't directed at you. And,
with only that warning, you realize
your one-on-one time must come to
an end. There is a third party on the
scene.
Who is this number three?
He, or she or N3, might be any
number of people. Sometimes, N3 is
a complete stranger to you. Your
friend lived with N3 freshman year,
or studied abroad with N3, or hiked
in the wilderness with N3 last sum
mer. Whatever the stories they
shared, you were unfortunately not
a part of them.
And so, as your friend and N3
excitedly exchange pleasantries,
you find yourself suddenly aban
doned. You check your phone; you
allow your eyes to wander around
the room; you count the moments
until N3 leaves. A small part of you
hates N3 for absolutely no reason.
Another part of you desperately
wants to be friends with N3.
It isn't a fun place to be, especial
ly when your friend and N3 manage
to only talk about the things that
completely exclude you. If they
talked about the weather, you'd
have just as good a claim to say

something. "No way, I think it's kind
of cold too!"
But you can't add much to the
discussion when N3 and your friend
immediately bring up their com
mon memories. In a worst-case sce
nario, their reminiscing rapidly in
tensifies. "Remember that time we
got totally lost? That was so funny!"
Was it? You wouldn't know. You
weren't there. Even if you try to fol
low the conversation, it wouldn't
matter because you don't know the
people and places involved in the
story. "John was so hilarious that
night!" Who's John? Why was that
hilarious? Oh, sorry, you had to be
there to appreciate it.
If they don't reminisce, some
thing equally exclusive might hap
pen: The conversation might turn
to personal details about N3 and
his/her classes, love life and other
gossip. As you listen to an unfold
ing saga that concerns why N3 can
never, ever hook up with so-and-so
again, you wonder if you should
still be there or pretend you have to
go to the bathroom.
But no! This was your conversa
tion with your friend first! You
have to take it back, no matter the
cost.
And so, rather than look around
aimlessly or check your email, you
insert yourself in the conversation.
You laugh when your friend and
N3 are laughing. You gasp, giggle
and say "aw" at all the right places
during the story, no matter what the
topic is. You casually slip in ques
tions like, "Whoa! What happened
next?" that let you stay engaged
without having to say anything else.
While these strategies can usu
ally work, it's annoying to have to
use them. The thing is, you should-

n't have to go on the offensive. You
shouldn't have to pretend you were
also lost on the streets of Madrid at
5 a.m. or hiking up the same moun
tain in the pouring rain.
Rather, the burden lies on your
friend. It is the unspoken, unwrit
ten responsibility of the mutual
friend in this case: the burden of the
introduction.
The mutual friend would do
well to introduce you to N3 as soon
as possible. The introduction paves
the way for an inclusive conversa
tion. It gives you some small
grounds for familiarity, and it gets
your foot in the metaphorical door
of conversation. Once you have a
name for N3, and you have been es
tablished as a participant in the
conversation, you can enter the
fray without feeling like a complete
outsider.
To all the mutual friends out
there: Yes, your position is a little
unfair. Introductions aren't easy,
and sometimes they don't seem
worthwhile. What if your friend
and N3 will never meet again? In
deed, they may not. But this is no
excuse. You never know if, some
where down the line, your friend
and N3 will be in a class, student
group or relationship. For the min
imal effort of one introduction,
you might take the extra step to
open up the conversation and po
tentially pave the way for some
thing more.

have just as good a claim to say

something. "No way, I think it's kind
of cold too!"
But you can't add much to the
discussion when N3 and your friend
immediately bring up their com
mon memories. In a worst-case sce
nario, their reminiscing rapidly in
tensifies. "Remember that time we
got totally lost? That was so funny!"
Was it? You wouldn't know. You
weren't there. Even if you try to fol
low the conversation, it wouldn't
matter because you don't know the
people and places involved in the
story. "John was so hilarious that
night!" Who's John? Why was that
hilarious? Oh, sorry, you had to be
there to appreciate it.
If they don't reminisce, some
thing equally exclusive might hap
pen: The conversation might turn
to personal details about N3 and
his/her classes, love life and other
gossip. As you listen to an unfold
ing saga that concerns why N3 can
never, ever hook up with so-and-so
again, you wonder if you should
still be there or pretend you have to
go to the bathroom.
But no! This was your conversa
tion with your friend first! You
have to take it back, no matter the
cost.
And so, rather than look around
aimlessly or check your email, you
insert yourself in the conversation.
You laugh when your friend and
N3 are laughing. You gasp, giggle
and say "aw" at all the right places
during the story, no matter what the
topic is. You casually slip in ques
tions like, "Whoa! What happened
next?" that let you stay engaged
without having to say anything else.
While these strategies can usu
ally work, it's annoying to have to
use them. The thing is, you should-

n't have to go on the offensive. You
shouldn't have to pretend you were
also lost on the streets of Madrid at
5 a.m. or hiking up the same moun
tain in the pouring rain.
Rather, the burden lies on your
friend. It is the unspoken, unwrit
ten responsibility of the mutual
friend in this case: the burden of the
introduction.
The mutual friend would do
well to introduce you to N3 as soon
as possible. The introduction paves
the way for an inclusive conversa
tion. It gives you some small
grounds for familiarity, and it gets
your foot in the metaphorical door
of conversation. Once you have a
name for N3, and you have been es
tablished as a participant in the
conversation, you can enter the
fray without feeling like a complete
outsider.
To all the mutual friends out
there: Yes, your position is a little
unfair. Introductions aren't easy,
and sometimes they don't seem
worthwhile. What if your friend
and N3 will never meet again? In
deed, they may not. But this is no
excuse. You never know if, some
where down the line, your friend
and N3 will be in a class, student
group or relationship. For the min
imal effort of one introduction,
you might take the extra step to
open up the conversation and po
tentially pave the way for some
thing more.

Imagine yourself having a long
awaited, intimate chat with a
friend. You could be anywhere
at a party, walking to class or
even in line at the CoHo to pick up
a hot cup of ChaiX (a caffeinated
concoction that blends a shot of
espresso into a chai tea latte). You
and your friend are happily catch
ing up on classes, love lives and
other gossip.
Suddenly your friend looks past
you and shrieks, "Oh my GOD I
haven't seen you in forever!"
You're puzzled until, turning
around, you realize that this excla
mation wasn't directed at you. And,
with only that warning, you realize
your one-on-one time must come to
an end. There is a third party on the
scene.
Who is this number three?
He, or she or N3, might be any
number of people. Sometimes, N3 is
a complete stranger to you. Your
friend lived with N3 freshman year,
or studied abroad with N3, or hiked
in the wilderness with N3 last sum
mer. Whatever the stories they
shared, you were unfortunately not
a part of them.
And so, as your friend and N3
excitedly exchange pleasantries,
you find yourself suddenly aban
doned. You check your phone; you
allow your eyes to wander around
the room; you count the moments
until N3 leaves. A small part of you
hates N3 for absolutely no reason.
Another part of you desperately
wants to be friends with N3.
It isn't a fun place to be, especial
ly when your friend and N3 manage
to only talk about the things that
completely exclude you. If they
talked about the weather, you'd
have just as good a claim to say

something. "No way, I think it's kind
of cold too!"
