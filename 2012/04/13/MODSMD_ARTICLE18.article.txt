# EXISTENTIAL FORTUNE COOKIES
## Take a hike! 
### Sebastain Gould 
Sometimes, when you are feel
ing stressed out and you have
no time at all in your sched
ule, you really just need to take a
break. The first week of class this
quarter was exceptionally busy
for me, I had all sorts of meetings
to attend, classes to shop and re
hearsal for a play every night. The
day-to-day grind of class and
meetings and practices leaves you
exhausted. By Friday I didn't even
want to get out of bed.
Friday night, I thought, "Ah, the
weekend is finally here. I can catch

up on everything that I haven't
done yet." Of course, there will al
ways be time to catch up on those
things. But how often do we sit
down at our computers and look at
lolcats? I decided that this week
end would be different. I wanted to
enjoy something out of the ordi
nary by finding something very or
dinary to do. I went for a hike.
Catherine and I drove down
Galvez to Embarcadero and kept
going until we got to the Bay. Once
we crossed over 101, we were at the
Palo Alto Baylands Nature Pre
serve. It is a great place to go for
day hikes and bike rides. Of course
the hike only lasted about half an
hour because we ran out of time.
Despite having left shortly after ar
riving, I highly recommend it as a
place to go and relax.
The water itself smells a little
because of the bacteria that builds
up in the marshes, so be warned.
Another thing that you want to
watch out for is the wind and the
cold. It gets quite chilly and I only
had a light jacket on. The trails are
peaceful though, and the traffic is
very light. I am surprised that there
weren't more people there. One of
the great things about the place is
the openness. You can sort of get a
sense of that when you go to the
Dish, but it is usually even more
windy there, and it's really steep.
The Baylands aren't much further,
and you can even ride your bike
there, although it's a long ride.
The best thing about the Bay
lands for me wasn't the flying
fowl, the giant odd-looking dog on
a leash or the lady painting land
scapes that didn't represent what
she was looking at. The thing that
really made the experience worth

it for me was the fact that the
parking lot we parked in was di
rectly under the flight path of the
small private aircraft landing at
the local Palo Alto Airport. I can't
really estimate the distance, but
they were close enough to touch .
.. figuratively. One of the other
things I thought about while
there, besides wishing I had an air
plane, was my hunger. I regretted
not bringing a bunch of sandwich
es to enjoy at the picnic tables that
border the water and the trails.
Besides the airplanes and ani
mals and fellow human beings, the
water itself is just peaceful. I spent
less than an hour there, but I felt a
lot more relaxed. It was like going
to a zoo, but I didn't have to pay
and there were no kids running
around screaming everywhere.
Once back at Stanford, I realized
that the Baylands have had a
more profound impact on my day
to-day life. When I am walking to
class or sitting at home on the
computer and start to get stressed
out about all the things I need to
do, I think about returning to the
park and walking around again.
Even if I don't go back to the
park, thinking about the peaceful
experience brings comfort to me.

Sebastain hopes you will all take the
time to check out this awesome
local spot. In the near future, he will
be going to some of the other Bay
parks and preserves, so if you want
to hear more make sure to shoot
