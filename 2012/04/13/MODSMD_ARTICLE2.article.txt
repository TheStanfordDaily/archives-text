## Oprah Winfrey surprises students Media giant brought two high school students from Leadership Academy for Girls to tour campus 
### KURT CHIRBAS MANAGING EDITOR 
Members of Stanford's
production of "The Color Pur
ple, the Musical" received text
messages and phone calls from
the play's director, Brandon
Jackson 'l3, early Thursday af
ternoon. Jackson told them he
was convening an emergency
meeting at 4:00 p.m. to discuss
the future of the show, and his
involvement with the produc
tion.
"A lot of them were nerv
ous," Jackson said. "But I had
to throw something out there
to get them to come."
According to Jackson,
many members of the cast and
crew missed classes and left
work earlier so they could at
tend the meeting at the Black
Community Services Center
(BCSC). After everyone ar
rived, Jackson along with
Jan Marie Barker-Alexander,
assistant dean of students and
BCSC director told the
crowd that they had important
news about the status of the
show.

But instead of any news
being announced, media giant
and philanthropist Oprah
Winfrey walked through the
door.
"No one believed that she
was standing in the room,"
Jackson said. "Once people re
alized, everyone started cheer
ing and clapping and hugging,
and were really over
whelmed."
"She was just as magnetic
as she was on TV," wrote Kel
sei Wharton 'l2, a cast mem
ber who was present at the
meeting, in an email to The
Daily. "It was truly amazing to
see how she captured every
one's attention and command
ed our respect."
The reveal, however, was
n't a complete shock, Wharton
said. He had heard earlier in
the morning that Winfrey had
toured the co-op Xanadu.
Combined with the fact that
Winfrey had starred as Sofia in
the 1985 film version of "The
Color Purple," Wharton said,
"It made sense that we would

be called for an important meet
ing on the day that Oprah was on
campus."
Still, he added, "I never imag
ined that she would be walking
around and engaging students on
campus all day long."
Winfrey spent Thursday tour
ing the University with two stu
dents from her Leadership Acad
emy for Girls, which she founded
in South Africa in 2007. Winfrey
was spotted around campus tak
ing pictures with Stanford under
graduates and being serenaded by
the student a capella group Talis
man.
Barker-Alexander said Dean
of Admission and Financial Aid
Richard Shaw put her in touch
with Winfrey because two stu
dents from Winfrey's leadership
academy had expressed interest
in applying to Stanford during
the upcoming admissions cycle.
Gayle King, Winfrey's close
friend whose daughter Kirby
Bumpus 'OB attended Stanford,
also helped connect her with
Barker-Alexander.
Winfrey and the two students
attended a lunch with Shaw,
Barker-Alexander, Judith Gold
stein, director of the internation
al relations program, and two
Stanford undergraduates,
Michael Tubbs 'l2 and Tumisang
Madigele 'l3. According to Bark
er-Alexander, Tubbs and Madi
gele were invited because their
academic interests matched
those of the prospective students.

Tubbs conducted research in
Cape Town, South Africa, and
Madigele is an international rela
tions major and international stu
dent from Botswana.
"It was incredibly inspiring,
something I'll remember for the
rest of my life, something that I
still can't believe really hap
pened," Tubbs said.
Tubbs said he was notified of
the lunch only moments before.
"Stanford is a place where you
get surprised," he said. "I'm so
thankful, and humbled, and I
thought, "This can only happen at
Stanford."'
Tubbs said a highlight was
Winfrey reaffirming his desire to
improve his hometown commu
nity of Stockton, Calif., where he
is currently a candidate for the
Stockton City Council.
Talisman member Nick Biddle
'l4 also said he heard midday that
Winfrey had visited Xanadu. This
launched a series of texts to the
Talisman chat list that notified
everyone to be on the watch for
Winfrey, he added.
"We were all on the lookout,"
Biddle said. "Anything that we
heard about we would text to the
list."
He said emails told members to
try to study in areas where Win
frey might be likely to visit, like
White Plaza and outside Hoover
Tower. Finally, the group heard
from a Talisman alumnus that
Winfrey and two students had at
tended a class at Encina Hall.
The group performed
"Avulekile Amasango," a tradi
tional South African song, out
side of the hall as Winfrey and
students were about to leave on a
golf cart, Biddle said.

"They stopped [the cart],"
Biddle said. "TTiey got out, and
started singing with us, and also
did all of our motions with us."
Biddle said that the students
were surprised that the Talisman
members knew the meaning of
the song, the title of which is
translated to "the gates of heaven
are open, we are crossing the
River Jordan." The group also
performed "Be Like Him," a
gospel rendition of another tradi
tional South African song.
"It was absolutely one of the
best experiences we've had as a
group probably," Biddle said. "I
think universally it just felt really
great because [Winfrey] kind of
affirmed what we do."
Jackson said that he had been
working for the past few months
with Barker-Alexander to have
Winfrey attend Stanford's per
formance of "The Color Pur
ple." He said the play, which is
being put on through a partner
ship between the Stanford
Drama Department and Black
Stage, went through a difficult
approval process last spring
quarter over concerns that the
production would not have
enough funding.
While the play won't open
until May, Jackson said having
Winfrey visit was "almost like
coming full circle . . . for her to
see the impact that we're mak
ing here at Stanford that she
made on a global scale." Winfrey
was a producer of the original
Broadway version of "The Color
Purple" musical.
Wharton said after the discus
sion he introduced himself to
Winfrey and shared that he will
be performing Harpo in the up

coming Stanford play. Harpo is
the husband of the character
Winfrey played in her perform
ance.
"ft was a great experience that
made me critically think about
my role in investing in others and
always doing what I can to lift
everyone up to their fullest and
deserved potential," he said.
However, most of the discus
sion was focused on the prospec
tive students, Wharton added.
"They talked about how their

academy is their home is much
like Stanford it's a bubble,"
Jackson said. "They share fears
about whether or not they are
ready for reality, and what comes
along with that. It was very good
to hear how brave they are in
even applying to school, and
show far they have come.
"It was indescribable," Jackson
said of Winfrey's visit
