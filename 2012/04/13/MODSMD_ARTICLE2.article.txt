Members of Stanford's
production of "The Color Pur
ple, the Musical" received text
messages and phone calls from
the play's director, Brandon
Jackson 'l3, early Thursday af
ternoon. Jackson told them he
was convening an emergency
meeting at 4:00 p.m. to discuss
the future of the show, and his
involvement with the produc

many members of the cast and
crew missed classes and left

Jan Marie Barker-Alexander,
assistant dean of students and
BCSC director told the
crowd that they had important
news about the status of the
show.

But instead of any news
being announced, media giant
and philanthropist Oprah
Winfrey walked through the
door.
"No one believed that she
was standing in the room,"
Jackson said. "Once people re

and were really over
whelmed."
"She was just as magnetic
as she was on TV," wrote Kel
sei Wharton 'l2, a cast mem

meeting, in an email to The
Daily. "It was truly amazing to
see how she captured every
one's attention and command
ed our respect."
The reveal, however, was
n't a complete shock, Wharton
said. He had heard earlier in
the morning that Winfrey had
toured the co-op Xanadu.
Combined with the fact that
Winfrey had starred as Sofia in
the 1985 film version of "The
Color Purple," Wharton said,
"It made sense that we would
