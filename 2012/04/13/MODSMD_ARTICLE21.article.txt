# 'CABIN IN THE WOODS'
## META-HORROR

For those of the techie variety,
winter quarter was a time of
scheduled interviews, job selec
tions and contract signing. In the cold
of winter, computer science majors
and engineers across Stanford took
refuge in the certainty of their sum
mer plans. But for fuzzies, especially
those pursuing careers in entertain
ment, April is the crudest month.
While many of us await emails or still
manage to schedule phone and Skype
interviews, the possibility of an
unpaid summer internship reading
(and rejecting) scripts is but the light
at the end of a tunnel leading to yet
more unsteady jobs and precarious
life plans. And this is the gravest of
many students' problems. In the
thawing of winter and the rush of
spring quarter, it's easy to forget how
easy we have it at Stanford, but Drew
Goddard's "The Cabin in the Woods"
kindly reminds college students
everywhere of their triviality in the
world as well as their capacity to seri
ously mess it up.
Goddard, known for his writing

work on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
and "Cloverfield," teams up with loss
Whedon ("Buffy,""Toy Story") and
J.J. Abrams ("Lost," "Super 8") again
this time for his directorial debut.
In the practically titled film, five
friends find themselves alone in
you guessed it! a cabin in the
woods, prepared to enjoy a weekend
of daring, debauchery and experi
mentation. From its premise to its
trailer, the film has all the trimmings
of a standard horror movie.
"I would be shocked if "Cabin" is
anything like those movies. Anything
like any movie," Goddard said with
an audible pause surrounding his
shock when I asked if "Cabin" will
join the ranks of typical thrillers like
"Silent House" and "House at the End
of the Street," both released this year.
"When I wrote 'Cabin' my hope
was for in the future, down the line
people to be saying, 'Well, is this like
"Cabin?"' not 'What is "Cabin" like?"'
he said.
And he's right. "The Cabin in the
Woods" defies expectation as much as

Goddard defied mine. When I met
the 37-year-old director in the parlor
of a Ritz-Carlton hotel room, he
appeared nothing like the Drew
Goddard I had studied from photos
and press interviews. Dressed in all
black with the facial hair to suggest a
pretty good Halloween attempt to
render Wolverine, Goddard had the
poise and impatience that speak to his
experience with these sorts of inter
views.
"It's an homage to the horror
movie really. It comes out of the love
for all horror movies," he said. "It's
not really one movie; it's about my
love for the genre."
The film may pay homage, but it
certainly turns the genre on its head.
Five friends in the woods is where all
conventionality ends, and any viewer
who thinks she knows what's coming
will be in store for a rule-breaking
story. As many fuzzies can attest, or
perhaps even a Stanford student stuck
in the right PWR might have heard,

"Buffy" has received record
amounts of critical and academic
coverage for its seminal status as
genre-setting. In the same way,
"Cabin" shrugs off its ostensibly
similar counterparts and fits
more aptly in the horror-comedy

genre with the likes of "Jennifer's
Body," "Dead Snow" and
"Zombieland."
And where those films
excelled in tight dialogue and a
surging craze, "Cabin" shines
with surprise and clever craft

ing, answering an age-old ques
tion: "Where do horror movies
come from?" If the meta-plot
does not sate the keenest of
intellectual viewers, perhaps the
Friday the 13th premier date can
at least assuage those with a

sense of humor.
