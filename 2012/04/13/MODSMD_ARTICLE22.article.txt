# THEATER
## CITY OF ANGELS takes on private investigation and jazz 
### â€“ brady HAMED contact brady: bhamed@stanford. edu 
Ram's Head's spring musical produc
tion in recent years has been largely
about putting on formidable versions
of recognizable shows that everyone can
enjoy. This year, the board made a decision
to choose something riskier, something less
famous: the 1989 musical comedy "City of
Angels," written by Cy Coleman, David
Zippel and Larry Gelbart. This risk paid off
well for the company.
The musical is divided between two

story lines, connected through the double
casting of one actor in two parts. In the real
world, Stine, played brilliantly by co-terminal
student Julian Kusnadi 'll, is a troubled
screenwriter, working in the power-hungry
Hollywood system. Along the way, he has to
deal with a whole host of alluring and exciting
characters. His boss is a successful and bois
terous film producer and director named
Buddy Fidler, played by Graham Roth 'l2. He
is constantly rewriting and claiming owner-

ship over Stine's story. But more importantly,
like in any good Hollywood story, many of his
problems arrive as a pair of long legs in a
well-cut dress. Stine's wife Gabby (Anneka
Kumli 'l3), his quick-witted secretary (Clare
Bruzek 'l2), the director's wife (Katie Straub
'l4) and a new starlet on the rise (Addy
Mendoza 'l3) all complicate Stine's life in var
ious ways.
What is twice as interesting is the movie
that Stine is writing. As the show progresses,
the audience watches the movie come to life
as Stine projects a taller, cooler version of
himself in the movies Private Detective
Stone, keenly portrayed by Weston Gaylord
'l5. Along the way, Stone meets characters
that are seemingly ripped right out of writer
Stine's life. Coincidentally, Stone has a capa
ble secretary and an alluring ex-wife, must
deal with a family with a powerful wife and,
like any film noir, bears a host of secrets.
The movie in the mind of screenwriter
Stine is where the musical truly succeeds.
Director Benno Rosenwald 'll draws inspi
ration from classic films such as "The
Maltese Falcon" and "The Big Sleep." This
heightened sense of drama and intrigue bub
bles through in the film with the fast and
sexy dialogue, which coupled with the ele
gant black and white set design makes for a
compelling directorial vision. The musical
itself also draws heavily on the 1940s influ
ence; much of the music is tinged with a
jazzy edge that builds on the excitement of
the rest of the show. Smooth jazz crooner
Jimmy Powers, played by Rob Biedry 'l5,
along with the chorus of Angel City all work
together to bring the music to the forefront
of the ensemble.
Fortunately, all of the singers on stage
are able to handle the technical jazz rhythms
and melodies pulsing throughout the show.
Leads Kusnadi and Gaylord play off of each

other well and share some of the most pas
sionate and invigorating songs. However, the
show is mostly an ensemble production;
each of the supporting players gets a
moment to shine and each takes full advan
tage of his or her time in the spotlight.
Highlights include Bruzek's sultry secretary,
Mendoza's revealing performance and Roth
doing pretty much anything on stage you
don't need to hire a private detective to real
ize that Roth truly steals the show.
Amid the high production values and
the talented singers on display, one thing is
painfully obvious. Even if the existing show
doesn't always meet lofiy expectations, the
cast and crew are incredibly passionate and
dedicated to the show and this love for the
production shines through every scene.
