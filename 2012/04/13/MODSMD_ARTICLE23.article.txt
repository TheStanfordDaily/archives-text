Beginning April 19, the San
Francisco International
Film Festival will once
again bring an eclectic mix of both
world cinema's rising stars and vet
eran filmmakers to the Bay Area.
With 200 films in 41 languages,
panels, master classes and more,
the 55th edition has something for
true cinephiles and casual filmgo

ers alike. So straight from the pro
grammers themselves, here is your
guide to the films and events not to
be missed.
Opening night showcases
director Benoit lacquot's "Farewell,
My Queen," starring Diane Kruger
as Marie Antoinette. This fresh take
on the events leading up to the
French Revolution tells the familiar

story through the eyes of the read
er to the queen.
The following weekend, Lynn
Shelton's excellent improvisational
dramedy "Your Sister's Sister" takes
the stage for the Centerpiece
screening. Emily Blunt, Mark
Duplass and Rosemarie DeWitt
star in this touching story about
testing the bonds between friends
and family.
The World Cinema Spotlight,
which runs throughout the festival,
highlights a diverse range of liter
ary adaptations, ranging from clas
sics such as "Wuthering Heights"
(dir. Andrea Arnold, starring Kaya
Scodelario) and the "Tess of the
d'Urbervilles" inspired
"Trishna" (dir. Michael
Winterbottom, starring Freida
Pinto) to more abstract fare such
as "Patience (After Sebald)," Grant
Gee's take on W.G. Sebald's genre
bending novel "The Rings of
Saturn." Literary enthusiasts should
also look out for "Chicken with
Plums" from Iranian graphic nov
elist Marjane Satrapi, the Chilean
comedy "Bonsai" (dir. Cristian
Jimenez) and Joachim Trier's
"Oslo, August 31," loosely based on
"Le Feu Follet."
As always, SFIFF packs a
strong documentary lineup, with
several this year focusing on
notable and inspiring women.

"Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to
Travel," directed by the late fashion
editor's granddaughter-in-law, pays
homage to the chic and witty leg
end, while Rory Kennedy's "Ethel"
chronicles the life and times of the
matriarch of one of America's most
formidable political dynasties.
"Marina Abramovic: The Artist is
Present" (dir. Matthew Akers) fol
lows the 2010 MOMA retrospective
celebrating the so-called "grand
mother of performance art."
Closing night features "Don't
Stop Believin': Everyman's
Journey," directed by Stanford
alum Ramona Diaz. The docu
mentary chronicles the unlikely
story of Arnel Pineda, who was
plucked from obscurity in his
hometown of Manila by the band
Journey to be the lead singer on
their upcoming world tour.
Novelist, essayist and short
story writer Jonathan Lethem will

deliver the State of Cinema
Address for the Live and Onstage
segment, which seeks to engage
festival-goers with filmmakers and
the cinematic experience in new
ways. Porchlight: True Stories from
the Frontiers of International
Filmmaking brings industry insid
ers to speak candidly about their
craft. The musically inclined may
enjoy Merrill Garbus of Oakland's
tUnE-yArDs for an evening of
reinterpretation of film scoring to
accompany Buster Keaton shorts,
or the live documentary presenta
tion at SFMOMA featuring Yo La
Tengo.
The festival continues until May 3.
