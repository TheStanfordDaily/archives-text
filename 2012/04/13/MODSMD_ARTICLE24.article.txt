Next week, the San
Francisco International
Film Festival will celebrate
its 55th year. Running from April 19
to May 20, the festival will showcase
hundreds of films in over forty lan
guages and offer prizes hitting the
$70,000 mark. With such a cine
matic smorgasbord, such little time
to wade through so many reels and
a major chunk of change on the
line, here are three of Intermission's
top picks you should be sure

to hit up.
Oslo, August 31st
Joachim Trier's melancholic
ode to urban life and the city of
Oslo, "Oslo, August 31st" is one of
the very best films of the last year
and a must-see. The film centers
around the charming Anders
(Anders Danielsen Lie), a former
drug dealer and addict, who gets a
one-day leave from rehab to return
to the city for a job interview and to

make a few personal stops. Over the
course of the day in Oslo, he jour
neys to his favorite haunts, seeing
friends of present and former days
and tying up loose ends. It's a cele
bration of all the things the city has
to offer and how even a neighbor
hood can have its own memories
and cast.
As a drug dealer, Anders, of
course, knew everyone. Trier care
fully shows us how Anders's rela
tionships have developed, and, in so

doing, the film becomes an explo
ration of growing up from carefree
twenty-somethings to more respon
sible thirty-year-olds. "Oslo, August
31st" is a dialogue-heavy film about
smart people, so the conversations
are interesting, real and resonant. If
you've ever lived in and loved a city,
"Oslo" will movingly touch on
familiar themes, friendships and
feelings.
I Wish
The latest film by japanese
director Hirokazu Koreeda, "I
Wish," is a quiet, mature and astute
exploration of childhood, hope and
broken families. "I Wish" is the
story of two young brothers torn
apart by divorce, each living with a
different parent and grasping onto
the hopeless prospect of reuniting
their parents. Bullet trains are being
constructed through their cities,
and they hear that if you make a
wish while two bullet trains pass
each other for the first time, it will
come true. The two brothers set out
with their group of friends, each
with his or her own wish (includ
ing one as far-fetched as to resusci
tate a cat), to meet up and make
these wishes properly.
"I Wish" successfully walks the
fine line between showing child-

hood as painful and full of helpless
ness and idyllic, simple and joyous.
As far-fetched as this journey is, we
can't help rooting for the children to
have their simple wishes granted,
and we are as heartbroken as they
are when the trip leads to a loss of
innocence. Much like "The Kid with
The Bike" and "Tomboy," two other
great films about childhood, this is a
film about kids that resonates deeply
with adults and is not to be missed.
The Loneliest Planet
"The Loneliest Planet" is a
quiet study of a couple's relation
ship Nica (Hani Furstenberg)
and Alex (Gael Garcia Bernal)
revealed subtly during their multi
day hike while on vacation in the
country of Georgia. They have
hired a local guide for their hike,
and we watch as his presence

shakes up their relationship and
hinders them from communicating
because they have an audience.
After a startling incident on the
hike, the film explores the fallout
for the couple and the strength of
their relationship. The dialogue in
the film is sparse, which lends
greater meaning to all of the seem
ingly small and insignificant body
language: when and how close they
stand together, the pace of their
walk and the simple games they do
or do not play, ft is a slow film, but
it's not slow in the league of "Uncle
Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past
Lives." The acting is very perceptive
and nuanced, and the scenery unfa
miliar and beautiful.
