Next week, the San
Francisco International
Film Festival will celebrate
its 55th year. Running from April 19
to May 20, the festival will showcase
hundreds of films in over forty lan
guages and offer prizes hitting the
$70,000 mark. With such a cine
matic smorgasbord, such little time
to wade through so many reels and
a major chunk of change on the
line, here are three of Intermission's
top picks you should be sure

to hit up.
Oslo, August 31st
Joachim Trier's melancholic
ode to urban life and the city of
Oslo, "Oslo, August 31st" is one of
the very best films of the last year
and a must-see. The film centers
around the charming Anders
(Anders Danielsen Lie), a former
drug dealer and addict, who gets a
one-day leave from rehab to return
to the city for a job interview and to

make a few personal stops. Over the
course of the day in Oslo, he jour
neys to his favorite haunts, seeing
friends of present and former days
and tying up loose ends. It's a cele
bration of all the things the city has
to offer and how even a neighbor
hood can have its own memories
and cast.
As a drug dealer, Anders, of
course, knew everyone. Trier care
fully shows us how Anders's rela
tionships have developed, and, in so

doing, the film becomes an explo
ration of growing up from carefree
twenty-somethings to more respon
sible thirty-year-olds. "Oslo, August
31st" is a dialogue-heavy film about
smart people, so the conversations
are interesting, real and resonant. If
you've ever lived in and loved a city,
"Oslo" will movingly touch on
familiar themes, friendships and
feelings.
