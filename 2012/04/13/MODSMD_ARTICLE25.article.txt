## TOTAL FRAT... MOVIE 
### â€“ alex BAYER contact alex: abayer@stanford. edu 
Dear Hollywood, make better college
movies. Well, actually, that should
be "Dear Hollywood, make better
movies, period," but we'll settle for baby
steps. Why is it that so many movies about
the fabled "Row" suck? Why does a movie
like "National Lampoon's Dorm Daze 2"
exist? If I ruled the world ...
But that's not to say there aren't some
goodies. Allow me to wade through the
Walmart clearance bins of crappy sorority
horror movies and National Lampoon blah
blah blahs to find you some Greek fare
worth taking a look-see at. For those of you
rushing and those of you pre-assigning to
Synergy alike, here are some films to keep
your spirits high as girls wander the Farm
at odd hours of the night and future frater
nity men do whatever it is they do at 103
oops, I mean Kappa Sig. Without fur
ther ado:
"Animal House": Yeah, you knew this
would be on here. I couldn't help it. Still
considered the gold standard for college
movies, the John Belushi vehicle about a
misfit fiat taking on the administration still
resonates with those crazy college kids ...
go figure.
"Revenge of the Nerds": Like "Animal
House," this one also involves a renegade
fraternity... a more awesomely dorky one.
But don't let the pocket protectors fool you.
This 1980s cult comedy has plenty of R
rated humor and sexual angst. Yeah, you
knew the latter was coming.
"Accepted": I'm told this comedy star
ring the adorkably likable Justin Long and a
more voluptuous Jonah Hill is actually
pretty funny. After getting rejected by every
college he applies to, a high school senior

creates a fake university of (but of course)
likable misfits. Sort of like Stanford, but the
valiant young protagonist didn't have to die
first. (Thanks, Leland Jr.!)
"Old School": If you like Will Ferrell
and/or "Hangover" director Todd Phillips
and their trademark humor, you'll more or
less enjoy this. While not consistently funny,
this comedy about three buddies reliving
their college years has its good moments,
mostly thanks to Ferrell. Still, this is cramp
ing my credibility... must find critically
acclaimed drama...

"Love Story": This classic 1970 film
stars Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw as a
wealthy Harvard student and a working
classic music student, respectively, and fol
lows their troubled romance. In the vein of
"The Graduate," this is by the far the most
thoughtful and intelligent film here. Aw
yeah (hand thrust).
"Legally Blonde": It's not the most
inspired choice, I admit, but good sorority
movies prove hard to come by. This Reese
Witherspoon rom-com is still plenty
charming. Runners-up (if you're really in
