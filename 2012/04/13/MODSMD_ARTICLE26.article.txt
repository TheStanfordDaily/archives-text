The floor is sticky, the line for the bath
room is absurdly long and countless
freshmen are scuffing the bejeezus out
of your new shoes but let's be real. . . did
you actually think it was a good idea to break
out those semi-vintage, limited-edition Air
Force Ones that your main squeeze bought
you at a rush event? Thankfully, Intermission
has compiled this collection of songs that will
undoubtedly receive plays by the D.J., but will
also hopefully get you through any all-cam
pus extravaganza. Intermission Presents: The
Fratastic Playlist.
"Without You" David Guetta ft. Usher
It's gonna burn for me to say this, but
Intermission can get down to D. Guetta. Not
the typical R&B flow of Usher, but neverthe
less, it's still Usher. And we're still dancing.
Looks like the night's started off right on the
Phi Psi light-up dance floor.
"The Motto" Drake ft. Lil Wayne
Uh oh. My jam. It's not a song. It's away
of life. I mean, how else could we justify typi
cal, day-to-day actions? YOLO. Despite being
Canadian (we see you Jimmy Brooks), Drake
"do[es] it for the Bay," which clearly places

him in our favor.

"Sandstorm" — Darude
Ahh, Sandstorm. A seven-and-a-half
minute techno classic. We still wait with anx
ious anticipation for the build up to stop and
the beat to drop. And when it does, it's just as
satisfying than it used to be. You know that
moment when you realize the only dance
move that fits the song is slowly bobbing up
and down with an extended arm? Yeah. That
moment.
"Get Low" — Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz
From the windows? AND to the walls?!
When this Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz clas
sic blasts through the speakers, we commem
orate the simpler days of 2004 by making a
curious attempt at crumping, while chanting
Lil John's favorite one-word, rather sloppy
pastime. Relive those eighth grade days. Or
for the frosh, like, fifth?
"Call Me Maybe" — Carly Rae Jepsen
Well, well, well. The instant classic. With
a simple melody, hook and lilting lyrics, Carly
Rae Jepsen has possessed the minds of people
everywhere. Who knew such a heartfelt and
genuine ballade could capture the hearts of so
many rugged and rough fraternity gentle
men? We surely don't know, but for that, we
commend her. So why not keep the night
going with this 2012 chart-topper adored by
beach-volleying bros and Beiber-lovers every
where.
"We Found Love" — Rihanna
Oh, Rihanna. What would we do with
