## MASS EFFECTS ENDING 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nadams@stanford. edu 
For most of human history, artistic
expression was a one-time action.
Ancient sculptors couldn't take back a
stroke of their chisel, and paint didn't come
off when it hit the canvas. There was a sim
ple but beautiful synergy between the weight
of those brief artistic moments and the
focused, passionate energy that inspired
them.
Humans are still expressive creatures,
but today we're afforded much more time
and space to craft works of art. We can re
take a digital photo or edit it later, film a cer
tain scene until we get it just right or even
re-post a tweet to make sound a little more
snappy. I'm no artist, but from a broad per
spective, I think it's fair to say that this trend
makes art less emotional and more intellec
tual than it used to be. If nothing else, it
makes art more malleable; where paintings
and sculptures were once altered by little
more than the elements and time, films and
music can now last forever on a hard drive,
going under the knife of an editor years later.
(I'm looking at you, George Lucas.)
We've been heading in that direction for
decades, with a different flavor of technology
leading the way at any given time. Recent
events have convinced me, though, that
video games still questioned by some as
an art form at all are spearheading the
trend more than anything else. And while
the effect on art is nothing new, I'm not sure
it's a good thing for video games.

The most
recent, eye
catching
example in
the industry, of

course, involves the ending of Mass Effect 3.
Released barely a month ago to incredible
critical acclaim, the game quickly drew the
ire of many fans for failing to provide a con
clusive ending to a trilogy into which mil
lions of people have each invested well over
100 hours. Developer Bio Ware was criticized
for allegedly exploiting fans' expectations
and caving to pressure from publisher
Electronic Arts to sell downloadable content
in the future. Caught between overwhelming
negative pressure from the public and a
respectable confidence in its original artistic
visions, Bio Ware was in a bad place.
Eventually they capitulated, announcing that
an extended ending would arrive via DLC
this summer.
It's a landmark moment in triple-A
games. As an interactive medium, the artistic
message of games is inherently variable from
player to player. But with only a handful of
other cases the minor surgery on Fallout
3's ending comes to mind we've never
seen developers take such a direct, top-down
approach to altering an artistic product after
it's been released. To go back to my earlier
analogy, that would be like Michelangelo
climbing up the Sistine Chapel a decade after
finishing it because a new pope believed that

some of the fig leaves were a little too reveal
ing.
To be honest, I was happy to see news of
Bio Ware's plans to extend Mass Effect 3's
ending. I care too much about that story to
leave it where it stands. But even so, I think it
sets a dangerous precedent. What if develop
ers start assuming that it's okay to sell
incomplete experiences? If they can get away
with "fixing" them later, what's to stop them
from going so far as to sell us the true ending
of a game? We've already seen visions of that
nightmare in games like Asura's Wrath and
Assassin's Creed 11, which explicitly and
intentionally excluded plot-critical portions

of the game and later sold them to con
sumers who were emotionally invested.
I'll be the first to admit that download
able content and patches give developers
valuable tools that can expand and improve
a product after its release, if used correctly.
But they shouldn't be considered an accept
able fallback for an incomplete or inadequate
single-player experience. I can hardly imag
ine the fallout if something similar happened
in some of gaming's more sacred series, like
Zelda or Halo.
