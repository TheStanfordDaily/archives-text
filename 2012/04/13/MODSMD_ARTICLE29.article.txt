# THEATER
## THE 						ALIENS' VISUAL ARTISTRY 
### â€“ alexandra HEENEY contact alexandra: aheeney@stanford. edu 
The production design at the SF
Playhouse has been consistently
remarkable this year, and "The Aliens"
is no exception. The intimate space, where
every facial expression is visible to the entire
audience, proves the perfect venue for this
slice-of-life play in which nothing really hap
pens and yet every detail gains significance as
the play unfolds.
Bill English's set is beautifully detailed and
creates a backyard hangout, with a picnic
bench center stage, garbage bins on the right
and a building at the back, complete with a
porch, a screen door and even a hot water
heater on the building's side. Since the space is
small, every aspect is up for scrutiny, and the
intimate space puts us right in the backyard
with the characters. Michael Palumbo's light
ing is equally effective, effortlessly alerting us to
the time of day, whether it's the warm July sun
or the cool summer moonlight.
When the play opens, it's a calm, sunny
summer afternoon. Jasper (Peter O'Connor)
and KJ (Haynes Thigpen) are relaxing on the
picnic bench outside. We will eventually learn
that they aren't in their own backyard, but
actually trespassing on a restaurant. They
aren't looking at or talking to one another, but
it's perfectly relaxed and natural. It's also silent
for minutes, allowing us to adapt to the pace
and the rhythm of the play. They eventually
start to speak, though not really about any-

thing, before they are ultimately interrupted by
Evan (Brian Miskell), the sixteen-year-old who
has just started working at the restaurant

where they are.
Evan is anxious when he discovers Jasper
and KJ outdoors because customers aren't tech
nically allowed outside in the backyard, and he's
unsure what to do. Out of boredom or vanity,
Jasper and KJ adopt the self-conscious Evan into
their acquaintance, and it is through their dis
cussions with Evan about each other that we
start to discover their back-stories.
Somewhere in the middle, the focus shifts
onto Evan, and the play becomes a coming-of
age story. Evan is gawky and awkward. He
speaks with trepidation and often stumbles
over his words. He find Jasper and KJ's atten
tions flattering; he's not the sort who is used to

being the center of attention of anything and
mostly tries to fade into the background, both
in high school and at work.
"The Aliens" is all about the acting, and
what a fantastic cast this production has. In his
cut-off sweatpants and faded backpack,
O'Connor as Jasper exudes a calm coolness. As
KJ, Thigpen is goofy yet proud, and when we
see him humming and singing to himself, it
seems natural. These two can sit in extended
silences together and what we feel is that these
are the silences of two people who know each
other well and do not need to be engaged in
constant dialogue to feel comfortable.
The standout performance is by Brian
Miskell as Evan. Through vocal tics, posture

and jerky movements, Miskell cre
ates a neurotic and uncertain
teenager. Miskell is completely pres
ent as an actor, subtly reacting to
everything happening onstage and
modulating his speech so deliber

ately that the stutters really do seem
spontaneous. Everything registers
in his face and his body so that,
even when the action isn't centered
on him, its effects on him are
omnipresent and distinguishable.
Despite the excellent acting,
the play fails to reach much depth
after the first act. Offhand com
ments stop being a huge window
into the characters, and the inter
minable silences, albeit impeccably
played, can feel very slow and test
the audience's patience. We are

invited to scrutinize every detail to
look for meaning, and while things
begin by seeming meaningful in the
first act, the second act fails to keep
up. The play is technically skillful,
and it is a rare treat to see three
actors so intense and in such realis
tic banality. It's just disappointing
that it doesn't offer more.
