# Anonymous emails spark controversy
## Campus-wide email signifies negative turn in ASSU election 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DEPUTY EDITOR 
Campus has erupted over the past 36 hours in a
firestorm of commentary on the actions and subsequent
criticisms-turned-attacks on ASSU Vice President and
Executive candidate Stewart MacGregor-Dennis 'l3.
Following news Wednesday that MacGregor-Dennis
spent over $2,000 on various online services, including
scraping student email addresses from MyGroups and
hiring a social media manager to earn him Facebook
likes and Twitter followers, criticism of MacGregor-
Dennis began to circulate on Facebook and over email.
Students reacted in protest Thursday when the criti
cisms shifted to attacks against MacGregor-Dennis.
The most controversial writing regarding MacGre
gor-Dennis came in the form of an anonymous, widely
circulated email sent late Wednesday night from a per
son identifying as Senator Palpatine, the name of the
"Star Wars" antagonist that has been used in recent
ASSU elections as a non-partisan, write-in candidate for
the Undergraduate Senate.
The long, scathing email began by criticizing Mac-
Gregor-Dennis, quoting articles and opinion pieces
from The Daily and Stanford Review. As the email pro
gressed, it descended into a vitriolic attack on the per
sonal character and mental health of MacGregor-Den
nis, calling him mentally unstable and unfit to run for
ASSU Executive by quoting, without attribution, an
anonymous comment on The Daily website.

Another widely distributed email sent Thursday
morning from an anonymous account (justice@stan
ford.edu) claimed to know Palpatine's identity through
means requiring access to Stanford computing reserved
for student resident computer consultants (RCCs).The
Daily could not confirm this claim.
According to an RCC, an administrator sent an email
to the campus RCC list asking Justice to step forward,
and administrators later reported to RCCs that Justice
has come forward.
Campus administrators expressed disappointment
regarding the email attacks, which likely violate the Fun
damental Standard.
"I'm writing to the student community regarding the
recent distribution of unsolicited bulk emails and cam
pus blogs regarding current ASSU election candidates,"
said Nanci Howe, director of Student Activities and
Leadership, in an email to The Daily. "Hurtful claims
that may not be true diminish all of us and suppress
open, respectful and honest dialogue. As a responsible
and caring community, we embrace vigorous debate
while respecting our individual members. The recent
communications are contrary to these values."
Howe confirmed that the University has opened an
investigation of the anonymous emails.
Criticism of MacGregor-Dennis took several forms
in addition to the campus-wide emails.
