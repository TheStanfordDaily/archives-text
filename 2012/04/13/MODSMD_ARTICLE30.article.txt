## GO FRAT OR GO HOME ROXY SASS 
### 
Fraternity rush is upon us, and
while she would rather be
upon fraternity members,
Roxy has decided to embrace the
spirit of rush and share some of the
insights she's gleaned over the years
about each of the frats.
Kappa Sig
A fraternity known for its debauch
ery, Kappa Sig always goes hard
an adjective Roxy considers the
highest praise. And while homeless
isn't usually Roxy's type, she's found
that on weekend nights, Kappa Sigs
are prepared to go to great lengths
to find places to sleep closer than
Suites. Maybe it's just her philan
thropic streak, but Roxy's always
happy to share her bed.
Sigma Nu
Sigma Nu throws the biggest par
ties, but Roxy's starting to think
they're compensating for ahem
something. And even more
importantly, Roxy likes boys who
are more into her than each other.
Of course, if they open their
kitchen, Roxy's occasionally been
known to open her legs.
Sigma Chi
Roxy thought she was done hook
ing up in bunk beds after freshman
year, but in the frattiest of Stanford
fraternities, virtually everyone lives
in one-room doubles. After enough
watered-down shots in the pent
house, Roxy is sometimes willing to
relive her Wilbur days.
Theta Delt
Maybe it's just secondhand smoke,
but Roxy has a hard time keeping a
clear head around the boys in Theta
Delt. They may be the most "chill,"

but Roxy knows a few ways to get
them excited.
KA
Roxy likes the chase, but usually the
chase doesn't lead her over scary
path [ljand through fields. That
being said, Roxy is willing to go the
distance for a house so full of ath
letes great bods and plenty of
stamina? Sign Roxy up. And when
the athletes are hitting the bed early
for 6 a.m. lift, Roxy will be sure to
be there to tuck them in. Either that
or to down some EANABS
Equally Attractive Non-Athletic
Brothers.

Roxy isn't rushing, but she's always
down for a quickie. Schedule a ren
dezvous at Intermission@stanford
