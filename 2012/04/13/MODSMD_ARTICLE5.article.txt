## PA, EPA show concern for school suspension rates Education experts address data on national student discipline trends 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
Palo Alto High School and East Palo Alto
Academy suspension rates are significantly
lower than the national average, which, ac
cording to recent data from the Department
of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR)
disproportionately affects male students and
disenfranchised minority groups.
Though local rates are low, Stanford edu

cation experts and local public school offi
cials responded with concern for the societal
implications that the nationally high rates
bring and offered alternatives on how to
bring the rates down.
The OCR released a report last month
showing that approximately 1 in 3 young
African American males in the U.S. are likely
to be suspended and/or expelled more than
once in their middle school and high school
careers. African American and Hispanic stu
dents are also more likely to be restrained or
secluded, the report says.
In the Palo Alto Unified School District,
which has an enrollment of 11,570 students

according to the Department of Education,
30 students received in-school suspensions
during last school year, while 210 received
out-of-school suspensions and five were ex
pelled. Of these students, 50 percent of sus
pension cases and 100 percent of expulsion
cases were white students. The remainder of
suspensions were split almost evenly between
African Americans, Hispanics and Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Claude Goldenberg, a professor in the
School of Education, wrote in an email to The
Daily that the concerning rates are indicators
