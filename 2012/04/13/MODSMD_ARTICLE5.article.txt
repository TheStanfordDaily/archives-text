## PA, EPA show concern for school suspension rates Education experts address data on national student discipline trends 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
Palo Alto High School and East Palo Alto
Academy suspension rates are significantly
lower than the national average, which, ac
cording to recent data from the Department
of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR)
disproportionately affects male students and
disenfranchised minority groups.
Though local rates are low, Stanford edu

cation experts and local public school offi
cials responded with concern for the societal
implications that the nationally high rates
bring and offered alternatives on how to
bring the rates down.
The OCR released a report last month
showing that approximately 1 in 3 young
African American males in the U.S. are likely
to be suspended and/or expelled more than
once in their middle school and high school
careers. African American and Hispanic stu
dents are also more likely to be restrained or
secluded, the report says.
In the Palo Alto Unified School District,
which has an enrollment of 11,570 students

according to the Department of Education,
30 students received in-school suspensions
during last school year, while 210 received
out-of-school suspensions and five were ex
pelled. Of these students, 50 percent of sus
pension cases and 100 percent of expulsion
cases were white students. The remainder of
suspensions were split almost evenly between
African Americans, Hispanics and Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Claude Goldenberg, a professor in the
School of Education, wrote in an email to The
Daily that the concerning rates are indicators
that schools fail to foster a feeling
of success for their students.
"We've just not done a good
job creating learning environ
ments where all students feel they
can thrive, be challenged and ben
efit from putting forth good ef
fort," Goldenberg wrote. "There
are many students from other
groups in similar situations, so it's

not just African American stu
dents we are failing to reach."
Bill Koski, Stanford law pro
fessor and director of Stanford's
Youth and Education Law Proj
ect, has worked with youth re
garding school disciplinary prac
tices and has witnessed a common
trajectory for students.
"When you suspend kids,
when you expel kids, it puts them
on track to possibly not graduate
from school and worse scenario
gets them involved in the criminal
justice system," Koski said.
Koski said there is no agree

ment on specific reasons for the
disparity in the punishment rates,
but Palo Alto High School Assis
tant Principal Jerry Berkson, sug
gests that financial resources of
school districts may play a role.
"If you're at a less affluent
place, sometimes you're not get
ting the same quality of educa
tion, you get frustrated, you act
out, then you get suspended,"
Berkson said.
Palo Alto High School, with a
demographic of predominantly
white students, has had no expul
sions this past year and minimal
suspensions, according to Berkson.
"One of the reasons there's
success here in Palo Alto is be
cause you have parents who were
successful in school and that in
turn was given on to their kids
and that's a good cycle, whereas if
you have people who are not fin
ishing school, who are not suc
cessful, the cycle's going to contin
ue on that side as well."
Goldenberg said he agrees
that parents do play a role be
cause they "can establish expecta
tions, encourage, set limits, give
unconditional love, take an active
interest in their welfare and let
their children know the impor
tance of giving your best effort at
school."
However, Goldenberg also
noted the cycle of influence par
ents have on their children that
can negatively affect them.
"But one of the things that
happens is that parents can get
discouraged, too, either due to
their own experiences or if they
see their son or daughter doing

poorly," Goldenberg wrote.
"We've seen cases where par
ents start out with pretty high ex
pectations for their child's school
success, but if a child starts to do
poorly or become disaffected
with school, the parents' expecta
tions start to erode, which then
probably contributes to a down
ward spiral."
Sharon Johnson, principal of
East Palo Alto Charter School,
said that students' cultural back
grounds may also have an effect
on the rates of disciplinary meas
ures.
"There are cultural differences
that may not match the culture of
the classroom and it's the culture
of the classroom that should
change to meet the needs of
where students are coming from,
not the other way around," John
son said.
East Palo Alto Charter School
shares similar suspension and ex
pulsion rates with Palo Alto High,
though Johnson noted that boys
are sent to her office at a much
higher rate than girls.
The study by the CDRC re
vealed that, in fact, males are
overall more likely to be suspend
ed or expelled.
"We think that schools are not
really set up for the energy that
boys bring to the classroom and
that we need to think really hard
about how to make the environ
ment so that there is a time and
space for more movement and
physical learning," Johnson said.
Regardless of the cause for the
rates, methods by which to reduce
them revolve around rethinking
the use of out-of-school suspen
sion practices and strengthening
school community.
"Rather than try to assign

blame to anybody I think the bet
ter route is to try to not exclude
kids from school particularly
from low-level offences," Koski
said.
Johnson said that exclusionary
discipline practices remove a stu
dent's accountability from an of
fense.
"If there is a fight on campus
we would rather have the student
be held accountable to the other
student they were fighting with
they would lose the privilege of
being in the classroom with their
peers until they could show that
they could act responsibly with
their peers and treat everyone
with respect," Johnson said.
Goldenberg wrote that ele
mentary school is where reform
of discipline and a positive aca
demic environment must start.
An example would be of the
"character curriculum" Johnson
uses at her school in which stu
dents partake in daily morning
check-in aimed at fostering a lov
ing, respectful community with
positive peer pressure.
"We're preparing you to own
your own future and we do this in
elementary school by focusing on
why they made the choices they
made and helping them realize
that those were their own choices
and that they have control over
their future," Johnson said.
"From the school's standpoint,
the most important thing is to cre
ate school environments where
all students can feel successful
and where they have a stake in
doing well," Goldenberg wrote.
"Easier said than done! But that
is what we must do."

change to meet the needs of
where students are coming from,
not the other way around," John
son said.
East Palo Alto Charter School
shares similar suspension and ex
pulsion rates with Palo Alto High,
though Johnson noted that boys
are sent to her office at a much
higher rate than girls.
The study by the CDRC re
vealed that, in fact, males are
overall more likely to be suspend
ed or expelled.
"We think that schools are not
really set up for the energy that
boys bring to the classroom and
that we need to think really hard
about how to make the environ
ment so that there is a time and
space for more movement and
physical learning," Johnson said.
Regardless of the cause for the
rates, methods by which to reduce
them revolve around rethinking
the use of out-of-school suspen
sion practices and strengthening
school community.
"Rather than try to assign

blame to anybody I think the bet
ter route is to try to not exclude
kids from school particularly
from low-level offences," Koski
said.
Johnson said that exclusionary
discipline practices remove a stu
dent's accountability from an of
fense.
"If there is a fight on campus
we would rather have the student
be held accountable to the other
student they were fighting with
they would lose the privilege of
being in the classroom with their
peers until they could show that
they could act responsibly with
their peers and treat everyone
with respect," Johnson said.
Goldenberg wrote that ele
mentary school is where reform
of discipline and a positive aca
demic environment must start.
An example would be of the
"character curriculum" Johnson
uses at her school in which stu
dents partake in daily morning
check-in aimed at fostering a lov
ing, respectful community with
positive peer pressure.
"We're preparing you to own
your own future and we do this in
elementary school by focusing on
why they made the choices they
made and helping them realize
that those were their own choices
and that they have control over
their future," Johnson said.
"From the school's standpoint,
the most important thing is to cre
ate school environments where
all students can feel successful
and where they have a stake in
doing well," Goldenberg wrote.
"Easier said than done! But that
is what we must do."

Palo Alto High School and East Palo Alto
Academy suspension rates are significantly
lower than the national average, which, ac
cording to recent data from the Department
of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR)
disproportionately affects male students and
disenfranchised minority groups.
Though local rates are low, Stanford edu

cation experts and local public school offi
cials responded with concern for the societal
implications that the nationally high rates
bring and offered alternatives on how to
bring the rates down.
The OCR released a report last month
showing that approximately 1 in 3 young
African American males in the U.S. are likely
to be suspended and/or expelled more than
once in their middle school and high school
careers. African American and Hispanic stu
dents are also more likely to be restrained or
secluded, the report says.
In the Palo Alto Unified School District,
which has an enrollment of 11,570 students

according to the Department of Education,
30 students received in-school suspensions
during last school year, while 210 received
out-of-school suspensions and five were ex
pelled. Of these students, 50 percent of sus
pension cases and 100 percent of expulsion
cases were white students. The remainder of
suspensions were split almost evenly between
African Americans, Hispanics and Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Claude Goldenberg, a professor in the
School of Education, wrote in an email to The
Daily that the concerning rates are indicators
that schools fail to foster a feeling
of success for their students.
"We've just not done a good
job creating learning environ
ments where all students feel they
can thrive, be challenged and ben
efit from putting forth good ef
fort," Goldenberg wrote. "There
are many students from other
groups in similar situations, so it's

not just African American stu
dents we are failing to reach."
Bill Koski, Stanford law pro
fessor and director of Stanford's
Youth and Education Law Proj
ect, has worked with youth re
garding school disciplinary prac
tices and has witnessed a common
trajectory for students.
"When you suspend kids,
when you expel kids, it puts them
on track to possibly not graduate
from school and worse scenario
gets them involved in the criminal
justice system," Koski said.
Koski said there is no agree

ment on specific reasons for the
disparity in the punishment rates,
but Palo Alto High School Assis
tant Principal Jerry Berkson, sug
gests that financial resources of
school districts may play a role.
"If you're at a less affluent
place, sometimes you're not get
ting the same quality of educa
tion, you get frustrated, you act
out, then you get suspended,"
Berkson said.
Palo Alto High School, with a
demographic of predominantly
white students, has had no expul
sions this past year and minimal
suspensions, according to Berkson.
"One of the reasons there's
success here in Palo Alto is be
cause you have parents who were
successful in school and that in
turn was given on to their kids
and that's a good cycle, whereas if
you have people who are not fin
ishing school, who are not suc
cessful, the cycle's going to contin
ue on that side as well."
Goldenberg said he agrees
that parents do play a role be
cause they "can establish expecta
tions, encourage, set limits, give
unconditional love, take an active
interest in their welfare and let
their children know the impor
tance of giving your best effort at
school."
However, Goldenberg also
noted the cycle of influence par
ents have on their children that
can negatively affect them.
"But one of the things that
happens is that parents can get
discouraged, too, either due to
their own experiences or if they
see their son or daughter doing

poorly," Goldenberg wrote.
"We've seen cases where par
ents start out with pretty high ex
pectations for their child's school
success, but if a child starts to do
poorly or become disaffected
with school, the parents' expecta
tions start to erode, which then
probably contributes to a down
ward spiral."
Sharon Johnson, principal of
East Palo Alto Charter School,
said that students' cultural back
grounds may also have an effect
on the rates of disciplinary meas
ures.
"There are cultural differences
that may not match the culture of
the classroom and it's the culture
of the classroom that should
change to meet the needs of
where students are coming from,
not the other way around," John
son said.
