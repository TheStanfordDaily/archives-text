## SSQL hails successful trans week Transgender Awareness Week sees large turnout 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
Campus participation in Stan
ford's 2012 Transgender Aware
ness Week has far exceeded ex
pectations, according to members
of Stanford Students for Queer
Liberation (SSQL), which was the
primary organizer of the event.
"We were expecting maybe six
or seven people to show up," said
Leanna Keyes 'l4, an SSQL mem
ber who helped plan the week, of
Monday's first event. "But when I
got there, 60 or 70 people were
there at the same time stand
ing room only. We were way over
capacity. It was amazing."
Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3, a mem
ber of the SSQL steering commit
tee for the event, who has now
participated in three Transgender
Awareness Weeks, said that this
year "had bigger turnout than
we've ever seen."
"Every event has been consis
tently attended," he said.
The Feminist Studies and
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity programs were also
heavily involved in planning the
week's events. In total, more than
fifteen University and student or
ganizations sponsored the event,
including the Clayman Institute
for Gender Research and an
ASSU Executive Action Grant.
Contextualizing the week
According to Vaid-Menon, this
year's theme "Beyond Binaries,"
was designed to address topics
that are not usually covered in
mainstream conversations, such
as the binaries between sexuality
and asexuality, as well as
monogamy and polyamory.
"We tend to perceive the world
as 'There's only man and only
woman, there's only gay people,
there's straight people,"' Vaid-
Menon said. "We wanted people
not just to learn about trans issues,
but also to think critically about
their own identities and the way
that our own culture perpetuates
these binaries without allowing
more complex narratives."
Vaid-Menon said that SSQL's
decision to hold the week during
spring quarter, as opposed to win
ter quarter like last year, was lo
gistical.
"We didn't want to jam pack it
into all the other events going
on," Vaid-Menon said. "We want-

Ed to do it at the beginning of the
quarter, so people could learn
from these issues and be inspired,
and actually act on them. So we
hope that people who were affect
ed by the events this week will
feel galvanized."
Sibel Sayiner 'l5 said that in
her first year helping organize the
event, she thought SSQL suc
ceeded in identifying diverse top
ics that were attractive to the stu
dent body.
"Planning went relatively well
and smoothly," Sayiner said. "We
had a few hijinks about exactly
which issues we wanted to ad
dress and how best to present

those issues so that a general pub
lic would engage with them and
find them interesting and there
fore be motivated to attend
events."
"We thought pretty critically
about that," Sayiner added.
Sayiner said that while she ex
pected focus on ASSU elections
to dominate campus attention
this week, attendance also sur
passed her expectations.

Looking forward
SSQL does not have any addi
tional trans issues events coming
up, but Vaid-Menon stressed that
the concerns of the transgender

community are a high priority for
the group.
"It's always important to es
tablish that SSQL takes trans or
ganizing and trans issues as cen
tral to our organization," Vaid-
Menon said. "We define ourselves
against mainstream LGBT or
ganizations that have trans issues
on the side."
Keyes commented that she
doesn't think conversations about
rtrans issues are happening much
on campus.
"I don't think that there is a lot
of campus dialogue at the mo
ment," she said. "But I don't think
that people are necessarily going
to express their full range of opin
ions when a transgender person is
around that doesn't necessari
ly mean that things are bad."
Keyes noted that there has not
been a hot button issue around
trans rights such as last year's
ROTC debates and protests
which may account for the de
creased general attention.
In terms of improving dia
logue, Keyes said that more active
student interest and participation
in panels like Safe and Open
Spaces at Stanford (SOSAS)
could be beneficial.
"SOSAS makes a concerted
effort to make sure that a wide va
riety of voices are represented on
campus particularly trans voic
es," Keyes said. "The dialogue
that comes out of those panels is
incredibly important to making
sure that everyone feels safe and
is informed at Stanford."
Keyes added that peer health
educators (PHEs) providing in
centives for attending SOSAS
panels and students doing person
al outreach to friends would like
ly improve awareness.
SOSAS panel attendance cur
rently "does not always meet ex
pectations," Keyes said.
Vaid-Menon noted that he
hopes students who are interested
will come to SSQL meetings,
adding that there is no require
ment of literacy in queer issues.
He also commented that stu
dents tend to view this week, and
others sponsored by the LGBT
community, as for members of the
queer community only. He said he
wanted to challenge this notion.
"The way this week and others
get constructed are as being just
for the LGBT community, but we
have events to allow people to re
flect on their own identities them
selves," he said. "We want to em
phasize that we all have genders
and we all have sexualities."

and smoothly," Sayiner said. "We
had a few hijinks about exactly
which issues we wanted to ad
dress and how best to present

those issues so that a general pub
lic would engage with them and
find them interesting and there
fore be motivated to attend
events."
"We thought pretty critically
about that," Sayiner added.
Sayiner said that while she ex
pected focus on ASSU elections
to dominate campus attention
this week, attendance also sur
passed her expectations.

Looking forward
SSQL does not have any addi
tional trans issues events coming
up, but Vaid-Menon stressed that
the concerns of the transgender

community are a high priority for
the group.
"It's always important to es
tablish that SSQL takes trans or
ganizing and trans issues as cen
tral to our organization," Vaid-
Menon said. "We define ourselves
against mainstream LGBT or
ganizations that have trans issues
on the side."
Keyes commented that she
doesn't think conversations about
rtrans issues are happening much
on campus.
"I don't think that there is a lot
of campus dialogue at the mo
ment," she said. "But I don't think
that people are necessarily going
to express their full range of opin
ions when a transgender person is
around that doesn't necessari
ly mean that things are bad."
Keyes noted that there has not
been a hot button issue around
trans rights such as last year's
ROTC debates and protests
which may account for the de
creased general attention.
In terms of improving dia
logue, Keyes said that more active
student interest and participation
in panels like Safe and Open
Spaces at Stanford (SOSAS)
could be beneficial.
"SOSAS makes a concerted
effort to make sure that a wide va
riety of voices are represented on
campus particularly trans voic
es," Keyes said. "The dialogue
that comes out of those panels is
incredibly important to making
sure that everyone feels safe and
is informed at Stanford."
Keyes added that peer health
educators (PHEs) providing in
centives for attending SOSAS
panels and students doing person
al outreach to friends would like
ly improve awareness.
SOSAS panel attendance cur
rently "does not always meet ex
pectations," Keyes said.
Vaid-Menon noted that he
hopes students who are interested
will come to SSQL meetings,
adding that there is no require
ment of literacy in queer issues.
He also commented that stu
dents tend to view this week, and
others sponsored by the LGBT
community, as for members of the
queer community only. He said he
wanted to challenge this notion.
"The way this week and others
get constructed are as being just
for the LGBT community, but we
have events to allow people to re
flect on their own identities them
selves," he said. "We want to em
phasize that we all have genders
and we all have sexualities."

Transgender activist scholars Eric Stanley and Dean Spade discussed "Toward a Critical Transgender Movement" Thursday evening as part of Transgender Awareness Week. This year's events had high turnout.
Campus participation in Stan
ford's 2012 Transgender Aware
ness Week has far exceeded ex
pectations, according to members
of Stanford Students for Queer
Liberation (SSQL), which was the
primary organizer of the event.
"We were expecting maybe six
or seven people to show up," said
Leanna Keyes 'l4, an SSQL mem
ber who helped plan the week, of
Monday's first event. "But when I
got there, 60 or 70 people were
there at the same time stand
ing room only. We were way over
capacity. It was amazing."
Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3, a mem
ber of the SSQL steering commit
tee for the event, who has now
participated in three Transgender
Awareness Weeks, said that this
year "had bigger turnout than
we've ever seen."
"Every event has been consis
tently attended," he said.
The Feminist Studies and
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity programs were also
heavily involved in planning the
week's events. In total, more than
fifteen University and student or
ganizations sponsored the event,
including the Clayman Institute
for Gender Research and an
ASSU Executive Action Grant.
Contextualizing the week
According to Vaid-Menon, this
year's theme "Beyond Binaries,"
was designed to address topics
that are not usually covered in
mainstream conversations, such
as the binaries between sexuality
and asexuality, as well as
monogamy and polyamory.
"We tend to perceive the world
as 'There's only man and only
woman, there's only gay people,
there's straight people,"' Vaid-
Menon said. "We wanted people
not just to learn about trans issues,
but also to think critically about
their own identities and the way
that our own culture perpetuates
these binaries without allowing
more complex narratives."
Vaid-Menon said that SSQL's
decision to hold the week during
spring quarter, as opposed to win
ter quarter like last year, was lo
gistical.
"We didn't want to jam pack it
into all the other events going
on," Vaid-Menon said. "We want-

Ed to do it at the beginning of the
quarter, so people could learn
from these issues and be inspired,
and actually act on them. So we
hope that people who were affect
ed by the events this week will
feel galvanized."
Sibel Sayiner 'l5 said that in
her first year helping organize the
event, she thought SSQL suc
ceeded in identifying diverse top
ics that were attractive to the stu
dent body.
"Planning went relatively well
and smoothly," Sayiner said. "We
had a few hijinks about exactly
which issues we wanted to ad
dress and how best to present

those issues so that a general pub
lic would engage with them and
find them interesting and there
