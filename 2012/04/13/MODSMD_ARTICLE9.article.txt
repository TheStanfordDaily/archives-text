## The 						NHL playoffs at their finest 
### Joseph Beyda 
It's April, which means the start
of that magical time of the year
when success is indicated by
growing a long beard, death
knells come in the sound of
airhorns and widespread repetitive
stress injuries are induced by minia
ture towels: It's the NHL playoffs.
And even though hockey may be
less appreciated than football, bas
ketball and baseball by the national
media, the Stanley Cup playoffs are a
spectacle unlike any other in Ameri
can professional sports: so grueling, so
exciting, so stressful that there's really
no good excuse to not tune in.
They call the Stanley Cup the
hardest trophy to win in professional
sports, and not without reason.
You've got to be lucky in a game cen
tered around a tiny, awkwardly
shaped disk sliding across a sheet of
ice, where a fluky bounce or two can
be the difference. You've got to be
healthy in a game that can leave ros
ters with breaks and sprains from top
to bottom by the end of the season.
You've got to be consistent in a game
so low-scoring that a few seconds of
mental error by one player can de
cide 60 minutes of action.
And you've got to do it 16 times.
Two months of near perfection. A
bad week and you're out; a good
week and you're not quite out yet.
History speaks to just how much
parity there is hockey. Since the cur
rent playoff format was instituted in
1994,nineNo.8seeds(outof34) have
upset a No. 1 seed in the first round; by
contrast, only four No. 8 seeds in the
NBA have won a series since the
playoffs expanded to 16 teams in
1984, and two of those upsets were in
more volatile five-game series.
Only four seven-game series in
American sports history have been
won by a team that came back from a
3-0 deficit. Three of them were in
hockey.
Anyone can win any game, any se
ries, any year against anyone else,
which makes for some pretty good sto
rylines. The playoff opener on
Wednesday was between two inter
state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers and
Pittsburgh Penguins, each of which
made it to the Stanley Cup final in re
cent years but came in as just a middle
seed. No matter; the Penguins jumped
out to a 3-0 first period advantage on
their home ice but saw that lead
erased, with the Flyers tying things up
in the final eight minutes of regulation
and winning in overtime, 4-3.
Playoff overtime exemplifies
everything that makes hockey so
unique. Everything is magnified and
nothing is certain. There's no bottom
of the 10th if you give up a run, no
five-minute period to make up for an
early three-pointer, no field-goal-on
first-possession rule to bail you out if
you lose the coin toss. Sudden death
means sudden death, and that's what
it often comes down to.
In a thrilling first-round series be
tween the one-seed San Jose Sharks
and the eight-seed Colorado Ava
lanche two years ago, the Sharks were
30 seconds away from going behind
2-0 in the series, an embarrassment on
home ice for one of the league's top
teams. But a late tally off a rebound
forced overtime, and a power-play
goal by San Jose sent the series to Col
orado knotted up at one game apiece.
Just two days later, the two teams
found themselves in a scoreless game
through 60 minutes and headed to
overtime yet again. Sharks defense
man Dan Boyle proceeded to make
the biggest mistake of his prestigious
career, backhanding the puck into his
own net from a bad angle to give
away the game and the chance at a
series lead.
Two days later, Boyle got some re
demption by scoring San Jose's only
regulation goal just a minute into
Game 4. The score was tied at the end
of regulation for a third straight con
test but this time the Sharks came up
with the sudden-death goal, and a se
ries that could've easily been swept
by the Avalanche was tied at 2-2.
It all changes that quickly, and
we've got two full months of twists
and turns ahead.
Most people seem to be picking the
New York Rangers to win the Stanley
Cup for the first time since 1994, but
there are still 15 other teams that truly
have a chance at winning it all. No other
American sports league lays so much
on the line come playoff time.
So if you're going to give hockey a
try, now's the perfect time. With every
series televised nationally this year,
there's always going to be a game on.
Sit back and relax. You're in for a
wild ride.

Joseph Bey da hopes that his beloved
seventh-seed San Jose Sharks will finally
pull through this year. Send him

Only four seven-game series in
American sports history have been
won by a team that came back from a
3-0 deficit. Three of them were in
hockey.
Anyone can win any game, any se
ries, any year against anyone else,
which makes for some pretty good sto
rylines. The playoff opener on
Wednesday was between two inter
state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers and
Pittsburgh Penguins, each of which
made it to the Stanley Cup final in re
cent years but came in as just a middle
seed. No matter; the Penguins jumped
out to a 3-0 first period advantage on
their home ice but saw that lead
erased, with the Flyers tying things up
in the final eight minutes of regulation
and winning in overtime, 4-3.
Playoff overtime exemplifies
everything that makes hockey so
unique. Everything is magnified and
nothing is certain. There's no bottom
of the 10th if you give up a run, no
five-minute period to make up for an
early three-pointer, no field-goal-on
first-possession rule to bail you out if
you lose the coin toss. Sudden death
means sudden death, and that's what
it often comes down to.
In a thrilling first-round series be
tween the one-seed San Jose Sharks
and the eight-seed Colorado Ava
lanche two years ago, the Sharks were
30 seconds away from going behind
2-0 in the series, an embarrassment on
home ice for one of the league's top
teams. But a late tally off a rebound
forced overtime, and a power-play
goal by San Jose sent the series to Col
orado knotted up at one game apiece.
Just two days later, the two teams
found themselves in a scoreless game
through 60 minutes and headed to
overtime yet again. Sharks defense
man Dan Boyle proceeded to make
the biggest mistake of his prestigious
career, backhanding the puck into his
own net from a bad angle to give
away the game and the chance at a
series lead.
Two days later, Boyle got some re
demption by scoring San Jose's only
regulation goal just a minute into
Game 4. The score was tied at the end
of regulation for a third straight con
test but this time the Sharks came up
with the sudden-death goal, and a se
ries that could've easily been swept
by the Avalanche was tied at 2-2.
It all changes that quickly, and
we've got two full months of twists
and turns ahead.
Most people seem to be picking the
New York Rangers to win the Stanley
Cup for the first time since 1994, but
there are still 15 other teams that truly
have a chance at winning it all. No other
American sports league lays so much
on the line come playoff time.
So if you're going to give hockey a
try, now's the perfect time. With every
series televised nationally this year,
there's always going to be a game on.
Sit back and relax. You're in for a
wild ride.

Joseph Bey da hopes that his beloved
seventh-seed San Jose Sharks will finally
pull through this year. Send him

It's April, which means the start
of that magical time of the year
when success is indicated by
growing a long beard, death
knells come in the sound of
airhorns and widespread repetitive
stress injuries are induced by minia
ture towels: It's the NHL playoffs.
And even though hockey may be
less appreciated than football, bas
ketball and baseball by the national
media, the Stanley Cup playoffs are a
spectacle unlike any other in Ameri
can professional sports: so grueling, so
exciting, so stressful that there's really
no good excuse to not tune in.
They call the Stanley Cup the
hardest trophy to win in professional
sports, and not without reason.
You've got to be lucky in a game cen
tered around a tiny, awkwardly
shaped disk sliding across a sheet of
ice, where a fluky bounce or two can
be the difference. You've got to be
healthy in a game that can leave ros
ters with breaks and sprains from top
to bottom by the end of the season.
You've got to be consistent in a game
so low-scoring that a few seconds of
mental error by one player can de
cide 60 minutes of action.
And you've got to do it 16 times.
Two months of near perfection. A
bad week and you're out; a good
week and you're not quite out yet.
History speaks to just how much
parity there is hockey. Since the cur
rent playoff format was instituted in
1994,nineNo.8seeds(outof34) have
upset a No. 1 seed in the first round; by
contrast, only four No. 8 seeds in the
NBA have won a series since the
playoffs expanded to 16 teams in
1984, and two of those upsets were in
more volatile five-game series.
Only four seven-game series in
American sports history have been
won by a team that came back from a
3-0 deficit. Three of them were in
hockey.
