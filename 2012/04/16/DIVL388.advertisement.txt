Stanford University
Free and open to the public
Today, all of us—whether we know it or not—are in the emotional
transportation business. More and more, success is achieved by
using compelling stories that move audiences—media, donors,
consumers, and employees—to action. In this special event, executive,
entrepreneur, and bestselling author Peter Guber will share what he
has learned over decades in the entertainment and communications
industries about finding and telling authentic stories that make deep
emotional connections with audiences.
Join us for an evening that will demonstrate how to transform information
into compelling narrative and will empower you to employ purposeful
storytelling as your "secret sauce" to propel greater good and social change.
