Metaphysics, Epistemology,
and Normative Truth"
Abstract:
"Contrary to what is often said, the idea that there are irreducibly normative
truths does not have troubling metaphysical implications, nor is it
incompatible with 'a scientific view of the world. 1 Moreover, because facts about
reasons are not entities existing apart from us, there is no epistemological
problem of how we can 'be in touch with' such facts. There are serious
problems about our knowledge of normative truths, but these problems are
internal to the normative domain itself. They arise from the fact that we do not
have, and perhaps cannot hope to attain, a sufficiently complete and
determinate first-order characterization of this domain."
