# Senate
## 
### 
The key to this race was the historically low number
of candidates: only 1 8 for 15 spots. This low number
of candidates, combined with low voter turnout,
made for a very predictable Senate election.
SOCC, the powerful endorsing group, went 12 for
1 2, and endorsing groups were largely successful in
electing the majority of their chosen candidates.

Senator Palpatine, the historic write-in candidate for
the ASSU Senate elections, fared poorly this year
compared to previous ones. This was likely due to an
email sent out under the candidate's name that at
tacked MacGregor-Dennis on both his ASSU record
and personality, an action many students viewed
negatively. Palpatine received over 400 votes as a
write-in in 2011.
