# Voter turnout
## 
### 
Voter turnout was the lowest in at least five years and the percent of students who
voted dropped across all class years.
Elections commissioner Adam Adler 'l3 attributed the low enthusiasm in part to
campaign controversies. Voter turnout was also likely hurt by the lack of a con
tentious ballot initiative (2011 had the highly debated ROTC referendum).
In addition, a small field of senators and only two serious slates running for Exec
utive likely dampened voter interest this year.
