# Special fees
## 
### 
Undergraduate special fees results were simi
lar to previous years, with all groups receiving
funds this year except for The Stanford Chap
arral and The Leland Quarterly. Both publica
tions will likely receive funding from the ASSU
Publications Board next year.
This marks the second consecutive year that
The Chaparral has failed to gain 50 percent of
student support. However, the humor maga
zine has a large alumni base and received
funding from the ASSU Publications Board last
year to continue operating. The magazine also
fields an Executive slate each year.
Listed at right are the groups that received the
lowest and highest percent of voter approval
on the ballot.
* denotes joint special fees. Only undergraduate votes reflected.
