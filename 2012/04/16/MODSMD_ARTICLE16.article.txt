## THE 						IRISH JIG Stanford Ceili brings Irish dancing to social dance community 
### ERIKAALVEROKOSKI DESK EDITOR 
Stepping into the Hacienda
Commons on a Tuesday a lit
tle after 7 p.m., I was greeted
by the sight of two separate
groups of dancers bouncing
gracefully up and down in time to a
drum, as if on springs. Surveying both
groups that made up this Stanford
Ceili practice session, I quickly deter
mined that I should join the group
learning individual steps rather than
the one in the larger set.
Starting with the basics, along with
my fellow beginners, we first learned
the basic "sevens," a step that in
volved rocking back and forth in the
6/8 time of the Irish jig music that
was playing. The glassy, wood floor
was perfect for spins and quick shuf
fles, though my socks seemed too
eager to slide on the surface, and I
nearly fell a few times. Slowly
throughout the evening we partici
pated in dances with more and more
people, progressing from individual
steps to a three-person "Galway
Reel for Three" and all the way to
sets involving up to 16 people. By
the end of the night, my calves were
burning, but the dance continued as
the boundless energy of the group
members carried them through the
9 p.m. ending time.
"The music is so entrancing and
lively," said Anna Polishchuk 'l5, a
fellow beginner. "Who wouldn't
want to dance it?"
Danya Volkov 'll, now a third
year graduate student in mechani
cal engineering, founded Stanford
Ceili in the summer of 2010. As an
undergraduate, Volkov was an ac
tive member of the social dance
community on campus. She first wit
nessed a ceili performance at a Fri
day Night Waltz, a weekly event
taught by Stanford dance professor
Richard Powers '7O.
"There was a group of people
doing Irish dance in the center of the
floor," Volkov said. "Irish dance is
something I had always wanted to
do when I was a child."
This group of dancers had come
from the Berkeley area, where they
met to dance at centers such as the
Starry Plough, a pub in South

Berkeley. While Volkov was inter
ested in joining, she had no means of
traveling as an undergrad without a
car. As a teaching assistant, Volkov
had access to the Hasso Plattner In
stitute of Design at Stanford
(d.school) building, and she decided
to use this access to bring the ceili
group to Stanford. Since the two
main instructors lived closer to
Stanford than to Berkeley, the new
location proved convenient for
them, as well. Soon, the Berkeley
group was migrating to Palo Alto to
satisfy its ceili fix, moving its main
dance site to the Stanford campus.
"It was kind of a new building, so
no one was using it over the sum
mer," Volkov said of the d.school.
"We had this giant atrium. Five to
eight people [would come] every
week, mostly me and [the teachers]
and whoever else we could get to

come, and now it's grown."
Ceili takes typical Irish dance
steps and combines them into an in
teractive form, transforming the
steps into a social dance. My first
three-person "Galway Reel for
Three" involved taking hands with
two others while performing the in
dividual front, back and sideways
"sevens," though the figure-eight
"Hey" pattern presented some diffi
culties. After graduating to a larger
group, we wound our ways around
one another, crisscrossing and
swinging partners along with other
group members. One particularly
dizzying move was called "Around
the-House," in which partners
leaped and spun one another simul
taneously, pivoting around the
group until we arrived back at our
original spot.
"It's a little different than what

I'd done before, with figures and a
more social aspect," said Mairi
Litherland, financial officer of the
group and a third-year graduate stu
dent, who had grown up performing
Irish step dancing.
"But the steps are essentially the
same," Litherland added.
The group teaches new dances
the first three Tuesdays of each
month, while the last Tuesday is an
all-dance session. While the Tuesday
night class is open to any curious
passersby, the core performance
group consists of about 15 regulars.
The group often performs at social
dance events such as Jammix, Fall
Ball, the Bon Bon Ball and the Vien
nese Ball. While several dancers are
members of the social dance com
munity, Stanford Ceili also attracts
Irish step dancers not involved in so
cial dance and individuals who may

not feel comfortable with couples
dancing.
"Ceili is very closely related to
the following forms: contra, square,
English country and Scottish coun
try," wrote Bob Carragher, dance
teacher and group organizer, in an
email to The Daily. "Basically, you
have groups of people dancing to
gether in patterns where the distinc
tion between 'lead' and 'follow' is
not so strong or important."
While beginners like me slid our
way through the steps with socks or
tennis shoes, the more experienced
sported "ghillies," soft black slippers
with a zig-zagging pattern across the
top. Though dancers bounced their
way across the floor with loose and
supple legs, their arms remained
stiffly bound to their sides. Suppos
edly, as legend has it, the origins of
this practice can be traced back to
the days of British occupation of
Ireland, when soldiers would pa
rade the streets of a community and
monitor the inhabitants' activities
through the windows of their hous
es.
"You would only see their upper
body straight," Volkov said. "You
couldn't see feet moving because
there would be tables in the way, so
if they were dancing, they would just
keep their body straight, and then
you wouldn't know there was actu
ally a party going on."
Though the steps may be the
same as the ones used for more for
mal Irish step dancing, ceili is the so
cial "people's dance." Stanford Ceili
tries to keep with this tradition. At
the Tuesday session, it was common
practice during a set for the end
dancers of two lines to high-five
with their spare hands when the
lines met, establishing a spirit of ca
maraderie that increased as more
people joined the fray.
"The more people you have
there, the more energy you have and
the less tired people get," said Kunal
Sahasrabuddhe, a third-year gradu
ate student who joined Stanford
Ceili last June. "For the group, you
always want to have fresh blood
coming in, more people learning."
