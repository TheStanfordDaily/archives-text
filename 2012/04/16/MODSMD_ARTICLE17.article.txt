# NOTES FROM ABROAD
## 
### â€“ Shilpa Sethuraman 
I have been in Cape Town for only a
week, but I have already begun to
fall in love with the city. Even the
"commercialized" beauty of the sce
nic beaches and expansive Table
Mountain is more awe-inspiring than it
looks in the tourist brochures. Yet for me,
the most beautiful part of Cape Town is its
rich culture.
During the apartheid era South
Africans were divided into 18 different
ethnic categories, and each of these ethnic
groups has its own story to tell about the
time period. Our tour guide demonstrat
ed this phenomenon when she passion
ately described how her family was evict
ed from its District 6 home for being "col
ored." Her nostalgia for her home was ap
parent as she recalled the displacement
that many families experienced. The Dis
trict 6 museum itself contains pictures of
her family and friends, a testimony to her
past suffering and a documentation of this
era in history.
Our tour guide also took us to Bo Caap,
a predominantly Muslim community. All
the houses were painted in bright, pastel
colors, apparently imitating the Malaysian
style and perfectly reflecting the vibrancy
of the tight-knit neighborhood. I was
amazed by the cohesiveness of the commu
nity but dismayed to find out that this was
one of the few communities to remain that

way. Our orientation at the University of
Cape Town showed us a completely differ
ent world, one that from the periphery at
least seems comparable to the Stanford
bubble. I was most struck by the diversity
and elegant dress of the students.
I have often been warned not to enter
this country with the expectation of
"changing the world," a mentality that
causes resentment among the locals. Yet,
after seeing people on the streets and
driving by the poorer townships, I cannot
help but be struck by the inequalities here
and hope to have some small impact.
While I have thoroughly enjoyed ex
ploring the city, I am most looking for
ward to working with Clothing Bank, a
service organization that helps teach
women to run small businesses. Our pro
gram coordinator advised us not to eat
lunch in front of people at the service or
ganization because some of them may not
know when their next meal will be.
It was then that the incongruity of the
program struck me we hope to help
the marginalized communities while we
have comfortable accommodations and
complain about limited Internet band
width.
The struggle of identity and our role
here is one we will all have to grapple with
throughout this quarter. Ultimately
though, these questions may become
what drives us to act.
