## EDITORIAL Reflections on the ASSU elections 
### 
After 48 hours of polling, the
ASSU Elections Commis
sion announced the results
of the 2012 ASSU election. Voters
selected an ASSU Executive slate,
15 Undergraduate Senators, Grad
uate Student Council (GSC) rep
resentatives, and a class president
slate for each undergraduate class,
in addition to approving the vast
majority of Special Fees requests.
Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 and William
Wagstaff 'l2 won the ASSU Exec
utive, garnering an impressive 79.7
percent of the vote in the first
round. As this Board endorsed the
Zimbroff-Wagstaff slate last week,
we are excited for their upcoming
tenure and wish them the best of
luck.
However, their victory comes
on the heels of one of the most poi
sonous and vitriolic weeks in re
cent campus history. In the wee
hours of Wednesday morning, a
student posted an image to Face
book purporting to show that cur
rent ASSU Vice President Stewart
MacGregor-Dennis 'l3 run
ning for ASSU President on a slate
with Druthi Ghanta 'l4 used
outsourced labor from
oDesk.com. The image quickly
went viral, and throughout
Wednesday other students pro
duced additional items criticizing
MacGregor-Dennis. These ranged
from relatively harmless if a bit
trite memes on Facebook to a
tasteless Twitter account mocking
MacGregor-Dennis' entrepre
neurial zeal. Many of the anony
mous comments on The Unofficial
Stanford Blog and Stanford Daily
were similarly distasteful. Thurs
day saw two anonymous emails
reach the student body, one sharply
critical of MacGregor-Dennis
from "Senator Palpatine", and an
other, sent from "justice@stan
ford.edu," labelling the Palpatine
email as "libelous [sic]" and pur
porting to unmask Palpatine.
Many students expressed dismay
at the callousness of their class
mates: Deepa Kannappan, a for
mer ASSU senator, wrote "I am in
credibly disappointed in the Stan
ford community right now. This is a
STUDENT GOVERNMENT
election".
Yet despite the drama, student
turnout in the elections was at least
at a five-year low. Among under
graduates, only 63 percent voted,
compared to over 75 percent last
year. Graduate student turnout
was particularly dismal: Participa
tion dropped nearly 30 percent
from last year to just 13 percent,
and more freshmen submitted bal
lots than the entire graduate stu
dent population combined.
The Editorial Board finds this

past week profoundly worrying.
While we heartily encourage open
: discussion and criticism of candi
: dates for elected office such is
necessary for a healthy democratic
system the crassness that has
been on full display on Facebook
; this week is completely inappropri
ate. Normally genial students,
when protected from face-to-face
contact by online media, demon
i strated their capability for cruelty.
The anonymous emails were par
ticularly caustic, with "Palpatine"
suggesting that MacGregor-Den
nis suffered from anxiety disorder
and "Justice" threatening a civil suit
; and abusing resident computer
' consultant network tools to at
tempt to identify Palpatine. In
: deed, six weeks ago, we published
an editorial about the threat of on
line flippancy, and these incidents
: are yet another example of the
L dangers of the depersonalization of
online media. In the future, we urge
particular caution with regards to
anonymous online rhetoric, as any
one can post ad hominem attacks
; and otherwise rude content with
l out fear of reproach,
i Yet we are also concerned by
the declining student interest in
ASSU elections. We worry that the
large drop in turnout indicates the
; presence of a large contingent of
[ the student population that feels
; alienated by the ASSU leadership
i and its initiatives. This is not entire
; ly surprising; this year's ASSU
spent a great deal of time on inter
nal reforms, and earlier in the year
[ the ASSU Executive received
widespread criticism for the incor
poration of the entrepreneurship
: oriented E2.0 within the ASSU.
Whether fair or not, in both cases
: many students felt that the ASSU
was focusing on issues not relevant
to them. Alienated students thus
: found an easy target for their disil
lusionment after the initial
oDesk.com claims surfaced
Wednesday morning.
The Editorial Board urges the
student body to make this upcom
ing week a week of healing after
the divisive and acidic rhetoric of
i the past week. Ultimately, each of
us candidates and voters alike
are also classmates, dormmates,
; and friends. Acrimonious online
rhetoric in search of some vali
dating "likes" from similarly mind
ed friends does not change the
fact that our online speech has the
power to wound our peers and the
Stanford atmosphere at large. And
for those who are disillusioned
with the state of the ASSU: Apa
thetically abstaining from partici
pating in elections as voters and
candidates only ensures that the
; status quo will live on.
