## Chi Theta Chi and the mission of the University 
### LEEALTENBERG Biological Sciences Ph. D. '85 
When the alarm went out
over the Stanford co-op
alumni networks that the
administration had decided to
forcibly take over Chi Theta Chi, I
wondered what in the world was
going on. Had Chi Theta Chi gone
rogue? Had the administration
gone rogue? On the face of it, for
Stanford University to take pos
session of its alumni's $3.5 million
property against their will is an ex
treme act. Chi Theta Chi's free
dom meant a lot to me as a grad
student they were a domestic
haven in the summers thanks to
their independent democratic
governance, while ResEd would
forcibly shut down my main com
munity, Synergy House.
I decided to do an independent
investigation. The administration's
takeover letter claimed that Chi
Theta Chi (XOX) was a health and
safety hazard. The County's in
spection records show, however,

that in 2012 the XOX kitchen was
as safe or safer than 61 percent of
University-owned kitchens. The
Fire Marshal's inspections of XOX
from 2002-2009 were unremark
able. The Nov. 2009 inspection said
only "1. Remove chair blocking
exit door in living room. 2. Review
evacuation signage, does each
sleeping unit have signage posted?
3. Balance of facility in good
order." But five months later, the
County's new inspector reported
18 deficiencies. The June 2010 re
inspection and February 2011 in
spection showed little response
from the house to the deficiencies.
Something was clearly amiss for
this 10-month period. XOX was
not the only one, however, to show
lack of response. During this time,
the Housing Office submitted the
inspection reports to XOX's man
agement without criticism, let
alone any threat regarding the
lease. The administration ex
pressed no special concerns until
the Feb. 8, 2012 takover letter. By
this time, however, XOX had al
ready corrected the problems on
its own. The Feb. 6,2012 Fire Mar
shal's inspection showed XOX
had reduced its deficiency count
by 2/3, and was as safe or safer than
Narnia, Slavianskii Dom, Synergy,
Sigma Chi, Kappa Alpha, and En
chanted Broccoli Forest. The Feb
ruary statement from Vice Provost
Boardman that "recurring health
and fire code violations demanded
university response" also begs the
question why did administra
tors permit students to live in this
allegedly hazardous situation for
two years before taking action?
To summarize, the evidence
shows that Chi Iheta Chi had a lapse
in management for the good part of
a year, from which it self-corrected.
The evidence also shows that the ad
ministration had wild swings in be
havior over this two-year period
from business as usual to hostile
takeover. This has all the hallmarks
of some kind of internal problem
and reaction between parties within
the administration.
The students, management,
and alumni board of ChiTheta Chi
have demonstrated every willing
ness and effort to learn from the
experience to create more even
management going forward. For
the administration to persist in its
takeover plan, against the will of
the residents and alumni, would
imply that it believes democratic
management cannot work, that
only bureaucratic force can work,
and that the students and alumni
of Chi Theta Chi are incapable of
learning, contrary (obviously) to
the opinion of the Admissions Of
fice and contrary to the education

al mission of the University.
If "Residential Education" is
to mean anything, it should see
Chi Theta Chi's cooperative and
independent ownership as an es
sential asset. Just down the block
is one of the great schools of man
agement in the nation. ResEd
should steer the formidable man
agement-education resources of
the Graduate School of Business
(GSB) toward supporting Chi
Theta Chi's independent demo
cratic management experience.
This would be a win-win-win solu
tion: a win for the administration
which wants to reduce any and all
risk, a win for the students and
alumni who would retain their lib
erty and property and would learn
cutting-edge management meth
ods for small nonprofits, and a win
for Residential Education which
would see a new opportunity for
engagement between GSB facul
ty and students. How much better
a lesson this would be than the
one currently being taught: that
the administration can forcibly
take away alumni property and
students and alumni have no re
course. Moreover, GSB expertise
on organizational behavior could
examine the administration/XOX
relationship as a system , shed en
lightenment on how this crisis
emerged in the first place and as
sist in creating a healthy relation
ship going forward.
The Administration should
demonstrate its own capability for
learning and self-correction. It
should announce without delay its
renewal of Chi Theta Chi's lease
based on a plan to ensure consis
tent management from Chi Theta
Chi and from itself in the future
a plan based on education, not
the forcible control of student life.
