## Chi Theta Chi and the mission of the University 
### LEEALTENBERG Biological Sciences Ph. D. '85 
When the alarm went out
over the Stanford co-op
alumni networks that the
administration had decided to
forcibly take over Chi Theta Chi, I
wondered what in the world was
going on. Had Chi Theta Chi gone
rogue? Had the administration
gone rogue? On the face of it, for
Stanford University to take pos
session of its alumni's $3.5 million
property against their will is an ex
treme act. Chi Theta Chi's free
dom meant a lot to me as a grad
student they were a domestic
haven in the summers thanks to
their independent democratic
governance, while ResEd would
forcibly shut down my main com
munity, Synergy House.
I decided to do an independent
investigation. The administration's
takeover letter claimed that Chi
Theta Chi (XOX) was a health and
safety hazard. The County's in
spection records show, however,

that in 2012 the XOX kitchen was
as safe or safer than 61 percent of
University-owned kitchens. The
Fire Marshal's inspections of XOX
from 2002-2009 were unremark
able. The Nov. 2009 inspection said
only "1. Remove chair blocking
exit door in living room. 2. Review
evacuation signage, does each
sleeping unit have signage posted?
3. Balance of facility in good
order." But five months later, the
County's new inspector reported
18 deficiencies. The June 2010 re
inspection and February 2011 in
spection showed little response
from the house to the deficiencies.
Something was clearly amiss for
this 10-month period. XOX was
not the only one, however, to show
lack of response. During this time,
the Housing Office submitted the
inspection reports to XOX's man
agement without criticism, let
alone any threat regarding the
lease. The administration ex
pressed no special concerns until
the Feb. 8, 2012 takover letter. By
