The win for Zimbroff-Wagstaff

Robbie Zimbroff '12 and William Wagstaff '12 celebrated after the results of the ASSU Election were
announced in the CoHo Saturday. The two co-terms were elected to the Executive for 2012-2013.
came just days after a firestorm
of controversy hit the MacGre
gor-Dennis & Druthi campaign.
On Wednesday, a number of
campus publications, including
The Daily, as well as several stu
dents on Facebook broke the
story that MacGregor-Dennis
had been paying, among other
things, for a social media manag
er to improve his Internet pres
ence, leading to fake Twitter and
Facebook followers.
MacGregor-Dennis, Ghanta
and current ASSU Exec Michael
Cruz 'l2 responded to the con
troversy through a variety of
mediums. MacGregor-Dennis
never addressed charges that he
had paid someone to scrape stu
dent email address from My
groups.
"This was one of the most
brutal and painful experiences
of my life and I am hugely grate
ful for everyone who sent me
personal messages of support
and everyone who spoke out
when things crossed the line,"
MacGregor-Dennis said after
the results were announced.
"But mostly what I care about is
Stanford being a better place. I
wish the absolute best of luck to
Robbie and Will and I will be
doing whatever I can to support
them."
MacGregor-Dennis said he
hopes to still make an impact on
Stanford with his remaining year
at the University, citing his pride
in his "ability to bounce back."
"This was an incredibly hard
time for me personally," he
added. "I think I will learn a huge
amount from the experience."
Zimbroff and Wagstaff bene
fitted from numerous, wide

ranging campus endorsements,
including SOCC, FLIP, Queer-
Co, JSA, The Stanford Review
and The Editorial Board of The
Stanford Daily.
The election saw a decrease in
voter turnout, possibly attrib
uted to student apathy regarding
the ASSU, or the lack of a hot
button issue, such as last year's
ROTC referendum. Adler said
this was also due to the MacGre
gor-Dennis controversy and sub
sequent emails.
"We've known we've been up
to that challenge since we got
into this," Zimbroff said in re
sponse to the news that voter
turnout was the lowest in at least
five years. Zimbroff added that
his goal will be to see a signifi
cant increase in voter turnout by
this time next year.
"I think it's sad," Zimbroff
said about the anonymous, cam
pus-wide email attacking Mac-
Gregor-Dennis and the events
leading up to the election. "You
wouldn't want this to happen to
you or any of your friends."
"It got too big for what the
ASSU is," Wagstaff added about
the controversy. Both newly
elected candidates said they per
sonally reached out to MacGre
gor-Dennis before results were
announced.
"All we can do at this point is
serve the student body as faith
fully as we can," Zimbroff said of
the shadow looming over the
election.
As for plans now that they
have been elected, Wagstaff said
the pair will take a quick respite
following the hectic campaign.
"Get some sleep. Do some
homework," he said of his plans
for the coming week.
