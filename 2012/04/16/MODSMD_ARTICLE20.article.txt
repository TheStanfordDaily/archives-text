# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## All-time low

f I llie campus commentariat has
spilled more than enough ink
A on SMD-gate, so I'm not
going to burden you with yet anoth
er column lambasting Mr. MacGre
gor-Dennis' bizarre online antics,
condemning the mysterious "Sena
tor Palpatine" for his ignominious
descent from the Olympian heights
of brilliant nonpartisan humor to
the inglorious muck of conventional
politics or furiously speculating as to
the identity of the ironically named
"Justice."
Instead, I'd like to take a step
back and take a look at the broader
political landscape illuminated by
last week's colorful fireworks show.
With our gaze fixated on the spec
tacular explosions and scintillating
gossip emitted by what somehow
managed to be simultaneously the
least competitive and most bitter
electoral campaign in recent memo
ry, I think we may be overlooking a
more important but less visible
story: the story of the deep malaise
that has gradually infiltrated politics
on this campus.
Let's start by looking at the data.
Voter turnout was abysmal this
year across the board. Among the
electorate as a whole, turnout was
an astonishing 20 percent lower
than in 2011. It would be tempting to
attribute last year's numbers to the
high turnout sparked by the contro
versial ROTC referendum, but that
would be a mistake: voter turnout
was even higher in 2010 and 2009,
and Elections Commissioner Adam
Adler reports that turnout this week
was the lowest it has been in at least
five years.
Only 18 serious candidates ran in
the Senate race this year, down from
38 in 2011,33 in 2010,37 in 2009,39
in 2008 and 50 in 2007. This all-time
low number of candidates had it

good: since not a single current sen
ator chose to seek reelection, they
weren't forced to confront any pow
erful Gao-esque incumbents, and
since the current Senate seems to
want to resign two weeks early,
they'll get to enter the corridors of
power nicely ahead of schedule.
Meanwhile, the only incumbent
in this year's race current ASSU
Vice-President Stewart MacGre
gor-Dennis was buried under a
colossal avalanche of protest votes,
barely garnering more support than
the Chappie joke slate and losing in
a landslide of unprecedented pro
portions to ASSU outsiders Robbie
Zimbroff and William Wagstaff. No
ASSU Executive Race in history
has ever seen a result so lopsided, at
least since the Elections Commis
sion started keeping electronic
records 13 years ago. Even in the fa
mous 1999 Executive race, in which
Mike Levin and John Mills ran en
tirely unopposed, more students (25
percent) voted for "none of the
above" than chose Macgregor-Den
nis last week.
Collectively, the numbers sug
gest a dismal reality. The Stanford
student body is more displeased
than it has ever been with its repre
sentatives in student government.
Even worse, however, it seems we
don't really care enough to do any
thing about it, either by exercising
our prerogative as voters or by run
ning for office ourselves; even the
angry voters are voting less. And
worst of all, a growing number of
Stanford students seem to have lost
faith in the system altogether, pre
ferring to consign our democracy to
the historical dustbin of failed states
and useless experiments in repre
sentative politics.
Given the dysfunctional Weimar
Republic the ASSU occasionally

appears to have become, I can't real
ly blame them. Some voters, as for
mer Executive candidate James
Mwaura pointed out in an eloquent
op-ed, see a student government
hopelessly dominated by the influ
ence of special interest groups like
SOCC. Those who don't interact
with the ASSU on a regular basis
see no reason for its existence, while
those who do bemoan its byzantine
structure and bureaucratic waste.
In short, ASSU politics are
rather like real-world politics. And
that similarity alone should send a
ray of hope bursting through the
clouds of the gathering storm.
Democratic politics is an ugly,
messy, bit ter sort of business, even in
paradise. But the real question we
should be asking is: what's the alter
native?
We could continue the down

The Stanford
student body is more
displeased than it
has ever been with its
representatives
in student
government.
