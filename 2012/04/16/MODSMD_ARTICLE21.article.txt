# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## Real is ethereal 
### Nina Chung 
These days, our gut gets a
pretty bad rap. Our culture
equates personal validity
with good communication, mak
ing anything inexplicable look
highly suspicious. That "vibe" we
get sometimes is born in a moment
that flees before our minds can
capture it, so we employ our best
tools to retrieve it: are you being
too sensitive? Are you being over
emotional? Why? Where does
that come from? And ultimately,
how might you be wrong?
There must be a "legitimate"
source of our split-second sensa
tions, right? And if we can't con
sider all of the options with a
great, intellectual discussion,
clearly it doesn't mean anything.
And so we wave a feeling away, on
to the next topic of the day.
Perhaps I've become overly
deft at this emotional sleight of
hand; a couple of recent, fleeting
experiences in the past month
have shown me how much so. I'll
describe it to you, but it will have
to sound vague: I was standing be
fore someone, outside, on a beau
tifully sunny day ... and felt un
usually trapped. I remember being
reassured there were bystanders
around ... just in case. There was
n't much breeze and some stu
dents were dancing together
around the corner. But during the
encounter, I felt an acutely strong
discomfort. It was pretty unfamil
iar, and I was definitely entertain
ing all of the potential, visible
causes behind it, before deciding I
was imagining everything. And as
soon as I started walking away, I
forgot about it entirely. Problem

solved! Unexplained ambiguity
effectively avoided.
But when I stepped into the sit
uation again a few weeks later, the
threatening feeling I had received
before came back. And there are
other ways that this personal con
nection is growing unexpectedly
intrusive. Finally, in this seemingly
absurd contest between raw in
stinct and rationale, I realized that
my head hadn't been leading me
correctly. Now, I get it: I get that
I'm not going to get it. And now I
can respond appropriately.
Much of the problem is my
habit of clinging to that aforemen
tioned big head that analyzes visi
ble data and makes convenient
conclusions. This is the head that
got me into this school, that forms
the words I speak and write, that
makes me resistant to others' ad
vice and spiteful of others' criti
cism and believes in a religion of
coherency. And for all of that, it's
way more problematic and self
deceptive than I usually admit.
I've noticed that the bad logic I
employ on myself tends to sup
ports wisdom that unravels in ret
rospect. This must be why that re
cent episode hit me so hard: it was
jarring to see my head so obvious
ly opposing something I so palpa
bly felt. It's rare to see that hap
pening in real time.
On a daily basis, we may think
we live in a sensible world of facts
we can figure. But, really, none of
that means anything without the
emotions with which we color it.
Often, these things are inexpress
ible, and we're fooled into think
ing they're less real. But the rea-

son why poetry, music and land
scapes are beautiful to us is be
cause they court the ethereal.
They address the existence of
something bigger that we know,
instinctively, exists. Remember the
sunset, which happens every sin
gle night and constantly debuts in
sappy movies and ballad music.

scribably personal things any of us
might ever experience, making it

We may think we

one of the most universal things in
the world.
These things, like love, joy,
peace, patience, kindness, good
ness, faithfulness are the fuel of
cynics and skeptics exactly be
cause they are most powerful. I've
found that rejecting these in
tensely internal sources of infor
mation can be dangerous, when
our head is perhaps the least
trustworthy source. Truth springs
elsewhere, and we should run
after it.

experiences in the past month
have shown me how much so. I'll
describe it to you, but it will have
to sound vague: I was standing be
fore someone, outside, on a beau
tifully sunny day ... and felt un
usually trapped. I remember being
reassured there were bystanders
around ... just in case. There was
n't much breeze and some stu
dents were dancing together
around the corner. But during the
encounter, I felt an acutely strong
discomfort. It was pretty unfamil
iar, and I was definitely entertain
ing all of the potential, visible
causes behind it, before deciding I
was imagining everything. And as
soon as I started walking away, I
forgot about it entirely. Problem

solved! Unexplained ambiguity
effectively avoided.
But when I stepped into the sit
uation again a few weeks later, the
threatening feeling I had received
before came back. And there are
other ways that this personal con
nection is growing unexpectedly
intrusive. Finally, in this seemingly
absurd contest between raw in
stinct and rationale, I realized that
my head hadn't been leading me
correctly. Now, I get it: I get that
I'm not going to get it. And now I
can respond appropriately.
Much of the problem is my
habit of clinging to that aforemen
tioned big head that analyzes visi
ble data and makes convenient
conclusions. This is the head that
got me into this school, that forms
the words I speak and write, that
makes me resistant to others' ad
vice and spiteful of others' criti
cism and believes in a religion of
coherency. And for all of that, it's
way more problematic and self
deceptive than I usually admit.
I've noticed that the bad logic I
employ on myself tends to sup
ports wisdom that unravels in ret
rospect. This must be why that re
cent episode hit me so hard: it was
jarring to see my head so obvious
ly opposing something I so palpa
bly felt. It's rare to see that hap
pening in real time.
On a daily basis, we may think
we live in a sensible world of facts
we can figure. But, really, none of
that means anything without the
emotions with which we color it.
Often, these things are inexpress
ible, and we're fooled into think
ing they're less real. But the rea-

son why poetry, music and land
scapes are beautiful to us is be
cause they court the ethereal.
They address the existence of
something bigger that we know,
instinctively, exists. Remember the
sunset, which happens every sin
gle night and constantly debuts in
sappy movies and ballad music.
And yet, it's one of the most inde
scribably personal things any of us
might ever experience, making it

one of the most universal things in
the world.
These things, like love, joy,
peace, patience, kindness, good
ness, faithfulness are the fuel of
cynics and skeptics exactly be
cause they are most powerful. I've
found that rejecting these in
tensely internal sources of infor
mation can be dangerous, when
our head is perhaps the least
trustworthy source. Truth springs
elsewhere, and we should run
after it.
