## DUCKS DOMINATE 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Just when it looked like the Stanford
baseball team was rolling again, the squad
hit another rut.
The wheels didn't quite fall off this
weekend against No. 16 Oregon, which
couldn't complete the sweep Sunday after
noon after taking the first two contests of
the three-game set. But after the No. 6 Car
dinal was held to just six runs on the week
end at Sunken Diamond, the squad now
finds itself in a three-way tie for seventh in
the Pac-12 with conference play approach

ing its midway point.
The Cardinal (22-9, 5-7 Pac-12) strug
gled mightily against Duck starters Alex
Keudell and Jake Reed, as Oregon has now
gone nearly a month since it lost with either
righty on the mound. It took another strong
pitching effort from sophomore
righthander A.J. Vanegas on Sunday for the
Cardinal to salvage a game.
With Stanford's bats falling eerily silent
after such a strong start to the season, the
squad was far from satisfied with its per
formance.
"We've just got to start playing a little
more consistent baseball," said junior re

liever Sahil Bloom. "We can't be on a roller
coaster. We can't score 19 against Cal [last
Monday] and then come out and do this."
Luck was clearly not on Stanford's side
in the Friday the 13th opener. After junior
righthander Mark Appel struck out the
first two batters of the game and nearly got
sophomore rightfielder Aaron Jones on a
called strike three an early sign that in
dicated that the strike zone would fluctuate
all night Jones reached second on an
error by junior third baseman Stephen Pis
cotty. Jones came around to score on the
next at-bat, and the Cardinal was down 1-0
early.

In the bottom of the second, junior
catcher Eric Smith launched a shot to right
field, but with the wind blowing in and to
left, it bounced off the wall for a double and
the Cardinal could not bring him home.
Freshman designated hitter Alex Blandino
doubled off the left field fences in the fifth
and was stranded as well, while Piscotty
also flew out to deep right twice in the early
going.
Stanford finally got on the board when
the Ducks made an error of their own.
Sophomore rightfielder Austin Wilson
ended up at second on a fielding error in
center and was knocked in by a Piscotty
double that was just the fourth hit given up
by Keudell.
Neither team was able to do much of
fensively, with both aces going nine innings
and Appel throwing an immense 149 pitch
es and compiling 13 strikeouts.
"Appel's a great pitcher, but he's an
even better guy," Bloom said. "It's fun get
ting to watch him do that week in and week
out."
A strange top of the 10th with Piscotty
on the mound sealed the opener for the
Ducks. First, Wilson dropped a leadoff fly
ball and put sophomore designated hitter
Kyle Garlick at second. After Garlick was
bunted over and another hitter walked, Pis
cotty grabbed a poor Oregon safety
squeeze but overthrew first, making it 2-1
and putting runners on second and third.
Piscotty then threw a wild pitch to the
next batter, scoring a run, but Smith made
matters worse with an overthrow to third
base, letting the Ducks tacked on their third
unearned run of the inning and their fourth
of the evening.
Stanford almost rallied from the 4-1
deficit, loading the bases with one out and
the top of the order at the plate. Wilson
struck out, and Piscotty singled to make it
4-2, but sophomore first baseman Brian
Ragira lined out to end both the opener
and his 13-game hitting streak.
Piscotty fell to 2-1 in his experimental
role as a reliever, while Keudell improved
to 5-3 as the Oregon ace.
Both teams' bats got off to a slow start
on Saturday, with redshirt junior lefthander

gon batters in the first three in
nings alone. But a hit batsman,
two walks one of them with
the bases loaded and a passed
ball fueled a 2-0 charge by the
Ducks in the top of the third.
That lead was extended in the
next frame, when a two-out walk
and a bunt for an infield single
were followed by Ryon Healy's
second home run of the year,
making it 5-0 Oregon. Mooney
ham got out of the fourth but his
mediocre outing ended there, as
his eight punchouts were coupled
with four walks.
Meanwhile, Stanford stayed
stagnant at the plate, as the Cardi
nal had a baserunner in each of
the first six frames but couldn't
manage to get two men on base in
any of those innings, coming up
with only two hits to that point.
"They have a really good mix,"
Bloom said of Oregon's top two
starters, Keudell and Reed (4-2).
"They throw their fastballs for

strikes, but more so than that,
they're really good at just getting
that secondary pitch over."
The Cardinal couldn't get a
run off Reed in the series clinch
er for the Ducks, though Bloom
threw an impressive 4.2 shutout
innings after earning his first win
of the season at Cal last Monday.
"I felt comfortable out there,"
he said. "1 had the defense be
hind me, which is always great.
We have a special defensive
team."
Stanford finally complement
ed its defensive play with some
hitting on Sunday, but that of
fense didn't come in its usual
form. Instead, sophomore Brett
Michael Doran came into the
game after shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila injured himself in the
second, taking over mid-at-bat
and recording his first hit of the
season, a two-run single,
Doran would get on the
basepaths twice more on walks
and came around to score both
times, accounting for all of the
Cardinal's runs in the 4-2 win.
Sophomore righty A.J. Vane
gas made another Sunday start
and got the win, going 5.2 innings

and allowing just five hits. He did
allow two runs one on a
groundout after a wild pitch and
another on an error by Wilson in
right but Stanford's slight lead
would hold, with freshman closer
David Schmidt getting his third
save of the year with 3.1 innings of
scoreless work.
The win was crucial for the
Cardinal, especially with another
top-25 team in Arizona State
coming to town next weekend. As
disappointing as Stanford's early
conference play has been the
squad is hitting just .232 against
Pac-12 opponents Bloom says
there's no room for anxiety going
forward.
"I don't think you can ever re
ally get concerned because all it
takes is just one game to turn it
around," he said. "Once we come
out and get a little more consis
tent, come playoff time, we'll be
just fine,"
Stanford will first host San Jose
State on Tuesday night at 5:30
p.m., hoping to improve its perfect
7-0 record in midweek matchups.

in the Friday the 13th opener. After junior
righthander Mark Appel struck out the
first two batters of the game and nearly got
sophomore rightfielder Aaron Jones on a
called strike three an early sign that in
dicated that the strike zone would fluctuate
all night Jones reached second on an
error by junior third baseman Stephen Pis
cotty. Jones came around to score on the
next at-bat, and the Cardinal was down 1-0
early.

In the bottom of the second, junior
catcher Eric Smith launched a shot to right
field, but with the wind blowing in and to
left, it bounced off the wall for a double and
the Cardinal could not bring him home.
Freshman designated hitter Alex Blandino
doubled off the left field fences in the fifth
and was stranded as well, while Piscotty
also flew out to deep right twice in the early
going.
Stanford finally got on the board when
the Ducks made an error of their own.
Sophomore rightfielder Austin Wilson
ended up at second on a fielding error in
center and was knocked in by a Piscotty
double that was just the fourth hit given up
by Keudell.
Neither team was able to do much of
fensively, with both aces going nine innings
and Appel throwing an immense 149 pitch
es and compiling 13 strikeouts.
"Appel's a great pitcher, but he's an
even better guy," Bloom said. "It's fun get
ting to watch him do that week in and week
out."
A strange top of the 10th with Piscotty
on the mound sealed the opener for the
Ducks. First, Wilson dropped a leadoff fly
ball and put sophomore designated hitter
Kyle Garlick at second. After Garlick was
bunted over and another hitter walked, Pis
cotty grabbed a poor Oregon safety
squeeze but overthrew first, making it 2-1
and putting runners on second and third.
Piscotty then threw a wild pitch to the
next batter, scoring a run, but Smith made
matters worse with an overthrow to third
base, letting the Ducks tacked on their third
unearned run of the inning and their fourth
of the evening.
Stanford almost rallied from the 4-1
deficit, loading the bases with one out and
the top of the order at the plate. Wilson
struck out, and Piscotty singled to make it
4-2, but sophomore first baseman Brian
Ragira lined out to end both the opener
and his 13-game hitting streak.
Piscotty fell to 2-1 in his experimental
role as a reliever, while Keudell improved
to 5-3 as the Oregon ace.

gon batters in the first three in
nings alone. But a hit batsman,
two walks one of them with
the bases loaded and a passed
ball fueled a 2-0 charge by the
Ducks in the top of the third.
That lead was extended in the
next frame, when a two-out walk
and a bunt for an infield single
were followed by Ryon Healy's
second home run of the year,
making it 5-0 Oregon. Mooney
ham got out of the fourth but his
mediocre outing ended there, as
his eight punchouts were coupled
with four walks.
Meanwhile, Stanford stayed
stagnant at the plate, as the Cardi
nal had a baserunner in each of
the first six frames but couldn't
manage to get two men on base in
any of those innings, coming up
with only two hits to that point.
"They have a really good mix,"
Bloom said of Oregon's top two
starters, Keudell and Reed (4-2).
"They throw their fastballs for

strikes, but more so than that,
they're really good at just getting
that secondary pitch over."
The Cardinal couldn't get a
run off Reed in the series clinch
er for the Ducks, though Bloom
threw an impressive 4.2 shutout
innings after earning his first win
of the season at Cal last Monday.
"I felt comfortable out there,"
he said. "1 had the defense be
hind me, which is always great.
We have a special defensive
team."
Stanford finally complement
ed its defensive play with some
hitting on Sunday, but that of
fense didn't come in its usual
form. Instead, sophomore Brett
Michael Doran came into the
game after shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila injured himself in the
second, taking over mid-at-bat
and recording his first hit of the
season, a two-run single,
Doran would get on the
basepaths twice more on walks
and came around to score both
times, accounting for all of the
Cardinal's runs in the 4-2 win.
Sophomore righty A.J. Vane
gas made another Sunday start
and got the win, going 5.2 innings

and allowing just five hits. He did
allow two runs one on a
groundout after a wild pitch and
another on an error by Wilson in
right but Stanford's slight lead
would hold, with freshman closer
David Schmidt getting his third
save of the year with 3.1 innings of
scoreless work.
The win was crucial for the
Cardinal, especially with another
top-25 team in Arizona State
coming to town next weekend. As
disappointing as Stanford's early
conference play has been the
squad is hitting just .232 against
Pac-12 opponents Bloom says
there's no room for anxiety going
forward.
"I don't think you can ever re
ally get concerned because all it
takes is just one game to turn it
around," he said. "Once we come
out and get a little more consis
tent, come playoff time, we'll be
just fine,"

Just when it looked like the Stanford
baseball team was rolling again, the squad
hit another rut.
The wheels didn't quite fall off this
weekend against No. 16 Oregon, which
couldn't complete the sweep Sunday after
noon after taking the first two contests of
the three-game set. But after the No. 6 Car
dinal was held to just six runs on the week
end at Sunken Diamond, the squad now
finds itself in a three-way tie for seventh in
the Pac-12 with conference play approach

ing its midway point.
The Cardinal (22-9, 5-7 Pac-12) strug
gled mightily against Duck starters Alex
Keudell and Jake Reed, as Oregon has now
gone nearly a month since it lost with either
righty on the mound. It took another strong
pitching effort from sophomore
righthander A.J. Vanegas on Sunday for the
Cardinal to salvage a game.
With Stanford's bats falling eerily silent
after such a strong start to the season, the
squad was far from satisfied with its per
formance.
"We've just got to start playing a little
more consistent baseball," said junior re

liever Sahil Bloom. "We can't be on a roller
coaster. We can't score 19 against Cal [last
Monday] and then come out and do this."
