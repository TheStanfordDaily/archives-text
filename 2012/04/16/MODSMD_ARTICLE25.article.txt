## Defense on top at Spring Game QB SITUATION STILL UNCERTAIN 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
On a bright, warm Saturday in
San Francisco, Andrew Luck pa
trolled the Stanford sideline wear
ing a gray hooded sweatshirt, jeans
and dark sunglasses, overlooking
the proceedings that many hoped
would determine who would suc
ceed him as the Cardinal's starting
quarterback.
While Luck wandered back and
forth between the sideline and a
small metal bench, the 2012 ver
sion of the Stanford football team
that had hoped to leave the city
with a clear idea of whom its next
starting quarterback would be in
stead returned to the Farm with
more questions than answers
about the future.
In the annual Cardinal-White
Spring Game at Kezar Stadium, the
race between Josh Nunes and Brett
Nottingham to replace Andrew
Luck was slated to be the main at
traction, but instead the Stanford
defense, dressed in its away whites,
stole the show and pulled off a 37-
29 victory over the offense.
While Nunes spent the day play
ing with the first-team offense and
Nottingham with the second string,
head coach David Shaw said after
the game that the two were still
neck-and-neck at the conclusion of
spring practice.
"That competition's still even,"
Shaw said. "I don't know what the
numbers say, I don't care what the
numbers say from today. That posi
tion was not played well enough for
us today to win a football game."
In the face of strong defensive
pressure that recorded eight sacks
on the day, neither Nunes nor Not
tingham distinguished himself from
the competition, as brief moments
of brilliance from each quarterback
were often offset by long stretches
of inconsistency.
"I thought our two top quarter
backs, at times, played really well,"
Shaw continued, offering some
tempered praise for the redshirt
junior and the sophomore. "Josh
made some nice throws that were

dropped and missed a couple of
checks and reads that we can't miss,
and Brett Nottingham, same thing,
he missed some things as well."
Nunes, who went 11-of-29 pass
ing for 167 yards and two touch
downs, and Nottingham, who went
12-of-19 for 118 yards with a fumble
and an interception, both echoed
their coach's assessment.
"For me, not a whole bunch I did
correct today," Nottingham said. "A
whole lot of stuff to clean up. I felt
like, as an offense, that the wide re
ceivers stepped up today and make
some nice plays, but I still think it
was tough for our offense to get into
a rhythm today."
"I feel like I left a lot of plays out
on the field," Nunes added.
While neither was overjoyed
with his performance, the two quar
terbacks both managed to pepper
their performances with the occa
sional exceptional pass.
Nottingham's best throw came
on his first drive of the game, where
he connected on a 22-yard back
shoulder completion to sophomore
wide receiver Keanu Nelson to
edge the Cardinal offense to the
goal line,
Nunes' masterpiece was a wob
bly 45-yard touchdown pass to
freshman wide receiver Ty Mont
gomery, who made a tremendous
leaping catch between two defend
ers and came down upright in the
end zone. Montgomery finished
the day with six catches for 87 yards
and two touchdowns.
"That was one heck of a catch,"
Nunes said afterward, downplaying
his role in the touchdown connec
tion. "Maybe a questionable deci
sion [to throw the ball],but it's great
that we've got guys who can go up
and make plays like that."
And while the Stanford offense
looked somewhat out of sync for the
entirety of Saturday's game the
Cardinal was playing without its top
three running backs the defense
registered a dominant performance
and took advantage of the game's
bizarre, almost inexplicable scoring
system (the defense was awarded
points for stopping the offense or
forcing turnovers) to give the White
team the victory.
"Our defensive pressure was
