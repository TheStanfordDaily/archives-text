# Offense ails at Spring Game
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
April is the time of the
year when nearly
every sport has some
thing major going on.
College basketball has
its championship, playoffs begin in
the NBA and NHL, the MLB sea
son gets underway and the NFL has
its draft. The Masters brought golf
back to the limelight, and European
soccer is reaching its pinnacle with
leagues and tournaments coming
down to the wire. If there was ever a
time to forget about college foot
ball, it would be now.
Except you can't forget about
college football. Ever. And just to
make extra sure that college foot
ball doesn't leave your mind three
months after the season ends, we
have a divine invention known as
the spring game.
Stanford, realizing that it sud
denly has a good (and more impor
tantly, profitable) football team, has
taken full advantage of its spring
game, making tweaks year after
year to what is and always will be
simply a scrimmage.
The big move, of course, was tak
ing the game off-campus, which
changed the game from "a scrim
mage we have every year that, if
you're really bored and have noth
ing better to do, maybe kinda sorta
drop by if you happen to be in the
neighborhood and see some guys
on the team play" to The Cardinal
and White Spring Game at Historic
Kezar Stadium in San Francisco.
Pretending the game is impor
tant was bold, pretending Stanford
is really connected to San Francisco
is bolder and pretending that it's
worth expansive media coverage
(ESPN covered it last year) is just
downright impressive.
The fact is that it's a scrimmage.
It's a scrimmage where absolutely
nothing is at stake, where the scor
ing system and format are com
pletely arbitrary and ridiculous,
where incoming freshmen don't
play, where outgoing seniors don't
play, where many players with
minor injuries don't play and where
the team is still almost five months
away from participating in a mean
ingful game. Logic states that there
is nothing to possibly read into
about this "game."
But I read into it. I, like so many
fans and media members around
the country, put way too much stock
into this little exercise. Last year, de
spite being in Los Angeles calling
Stanford's baseball game at USC on
the radio, I still found myself glued
to my computer screen, watching
Andrew Luck dissect his own de
fense. I was convinced that he could
beat any defense and that we would
n't miss our graduating receivers. I
was convinced that the holes in our
secondary would be our only issues.
I was convinced that we'd be one of
the best teams in the country. And
all it took was a silly scrimmage in
April that I didn't even go to!
This year, I was actually able to
attend the game, and my convictions
are just as strong, albeit not as posi
tive. I came in expecting to see a
team that missed Luck and was still
searching for its starting quarter
back. I came in expecting to see a
dominant linebacker corps that
would be the best group on the field
by far. I came in expecting to see
some fun plays that would get me
excited for Stanford football.
Well, I was somewhat right. The
linebackers were overpowering,
getting touch-sacks (no one was al
lowed to hit the quarterbacks) so
often that I honestly wondered if
they were ever told to back off just
to give the offense a chance to run
from time to time. The quarterback
competition still looks very much up
in the air, but none of the choices
looked nearly as promising as I'd
hoped.
As for the excitement... well,
that was a little lacking. There were
a couple nice plays (Ty Mont
gomery's first touchdown catch and
Jordan Richards' interception come
to mind), but I found myself em
ploying more facepalms than
rounds of applause.
The offense had more drops
than any roller coaster I've ever
been on, and the rest of the plays
seemed to be either a sack or a bad
pass. It's hard to read too much into
the running backs considering Step
fan Taylor, Anthony Wilkerson and
Tyler Gaffney weren't playing. Jere
my Stewart is gone and Barry J.
Sanders hasn't joined the team yet,
but no one particularly stood out.
The defense certainly deserved
to win, but it's hard to tell if that's
due more to the stingy defense or
the mediocre offense. Has the de
fense really improved from the
squad that struggled against the bet
ter teams Stanford played last year?
It's hard to know, but the biggest dif-

ference between January and April
was clearly the loss of Luck. That
will clearly be the big story of the
offseason, and it's up to Stanford to
make sure that isn't the big story of
the whole season as well.
Even with the lackluster per
formance on Saturday, my expecta
tions for Stanford football haven't
really changed. The Cardinal will
definitely experience a drop-off
from the success of the past couple

seasons. Yes, Luck is gone, but so are
several other cornerstones of the
team. Still, there is a heck of a lot of
talent on this squad, and Stanford
can absolutely be one of the better
teams in the Pac-12 in 2012. Unfor
tunately, we'll have to wait several
more months to see just how good
the Cardinal will be.

enough attention to The Daily's
delegation at the Spring Game,
which looked in tip-top shape for
next year's Ink Bowl. Submit your
