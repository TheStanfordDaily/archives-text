# NO MATCH, AGAIN
## CARD SWEPT BY UCLA, USC FOR SECOND TIME 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford men's tennis team suf
fered two tough losses over the weekend at the
hands of the Pac-12 powerhouses from South
ern California: No. 1 USC and No. 6 UCLA.
The Cardinal (14-7, 4-2 Pac-12) was roundly
defeated in both matches, 7-0 in front of a
packed crowd at USC's Marks Stadium on
Saturday and 6-1 in front of the Bruin faithful
on Sunday.
These losses were the second time in two
months that the L.A. schools have dismantled
the Cardinal, with identical 6-1, 7-0 scores
when the teams played at the beginning of
March at the Farm as well a testament to
the strength of the two Los Angeles teams.
USC has now shut out Stanford twice this sea
son, a very rare event in the storied history of
Stanford tennis.
In recent years, the Trojans have developed
into a member of the collegiate tennis elite.
For four years, the Trojans have dominated
their competition, winning three straight
NCAA team championships. Their top player,
senior Steve Johnson, the reigning NCAA sin
gles champion, took that mantle from Stan
ford senior Bradley Klahn, who won the title
in 2010.
This year has been much of the same for
USC, which is undefeated on the season at 24-
0 after defeating Stanford. Dating back to last
season, the Trojans are riding a 44-match win
ning streak, a particularly impressive feat in
today's collegiate tennis climate of aggressive
international recruiting and overall parity.
Just like in the squads' March 3 meeting at
the Farm, Saturday's match against USC got
off to a bad start and only became progressive
ly worse for the Cardinal. The Trojans swept
the three doubles matches, with their top pair
ing of Johnson and Roberto Quiroz upsetting
Stanford's stalwart tandem of seniors Klahn
and Ryan Thacher. Leading 1-0, USC took
that momentum into the singles play where, at
times, the Cardinal squad simply looked over
matched. Only sophomore Daniel Ho, playing
out of the No. 6 spot, managed to win a set
against a Trojan opponent, but he fell in the
third-set tiebreaker 10-7, long after the out
come of the match had been determined.
"It was definitely tough playing USC," Ho
said. "They are a very good team, and we gave
it our best. We just have to get better before we
play them again."
"It's never a great atmosphere after a loss
like that," he added. "There was definitely

some anger, too, given our history with them."
The match on Sunday against UCLA did
not go much better for head coach John
Whitlinger's squad. The Bruins jumped out of
the gate just like the Trojans and won all three
doubles matches, giving them the first point of
the match and the momentum that goes along
with it.
Singles play was nearly as lopsided on Sun
day as on Saturday, with Klahn the only one
able to muster any sets off of a Bruins oppo

nent; Klahn won out of his No. 1 position while
the rest of his teammates fell in straight sets.
Stanford next plays at home against Pacific
on Wednesday before ending the regular sea
son on Friday at Cal. Next week, the playoffs
begin, starting on April 25 with the opening
round of the Pac-12 Championships in Ojai,
Calif.

Senior Bradley Klahn was the only Stanford player to win a match this weekend, beating Clay
Thompson 6-4, 6-4 at the No. 1 spot on Sunday. By that point, however, the Cardinal had already
dropped each of its five other singles matches, as well as the three doubles sets, to the Bruins.
