## Incoming senators hope to reverse student apathy New ASSU reps face uphill battle due to lack of experience 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The undergraduate student
body elected 13 freshmen and
two sophomores to the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate, election
commissioner Adam Adler 'l3
announced Saturday at a results
party held at the CoHo Saturday.
None of the 15 senators have
previously held ASSU office be
sides serving on Frosh Council,
making it the first year in at least
a decade in which neither the
Senate nor the Executive will
have any members with previous
experience in an elected ASSU
position, according to the Elec
tions Commissions archives.
With only 18 students in the
Senate race, only three candi
dates were not elected, including
one who was not actively cam
paigning.
"I'm really excited to try and
change the image of the ASSU
because I know a lot of people

view it in a negative light," Anna
Brezhneva 'l5 said of her new
position.

Brezhneva could not name
any ASSU initiative that was im
plemented this year, which she
said was evidence of the lack of
communication between the
current Senate and the student
body.

When asked what their first
initiative would be upon taking
office, several senators, including
Brezhneva, Jack Weller 'l5 and
Garima Sharma 'l5, said that
their priority would be lowering
the standard of proof for sexual
assault proceedings as worded in
the ASSU Constitution. As The
Daily previously reported, the
current burden outlined in the
ASSU Constitution requiring
evidence beyond a reasonable
doubt violates the preponder
ance of evidence standard dictat
ed by federal law. Judicial Af
fairs, however, has been using a
lower standard of proof in accor
dance with federal guidelines for
a year. According to current sen
ators, this could result in the ac
cused suing the University for
breach of the student's contract
with the ASSU because the ASSU
Constitution gives the accused
more rights than the process cur
rently used by Judicial Affairs.
Such a change would require a
constitutional amendment ap
proved by a student vote repre
senting at least 15 percent of the
student body. At their meeting last
week, current senators voted
against moving forward with such
a referendum for fear that it would
fail.
Several of the newly elected
senators have identified elevating
ASSU transparency and increas
ing ASSU accessibility as key
points to address for the new Sen
ate.
"I think one thing that I was
slightly disappointed with in this
year's Senate was the issue of
transparency," said Viraj Bindra
'l5. "[This] very clichE issue that
every senator promises and
that every senator does not follow
through on was really preva
lent last year."
All 12 Senate candidates en
dorsed by the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC) were elected
this year, compared to 12 of 15 en
dorsed candidates last year.
SOCC is a coalition of six
groups: the Asian American Stu
dents' Association (A AS A), the
Black Student Union (BSU),
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztl-n (MEChA), the Muslim
Student Awareness Network
(MSAN), the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of Col
ored People (NAACP) and the
Stanford American Indian Organ
ization (SAIO).
"I do think that a SOCC en
dorsement is a major advantage in
this race," Bindra said of the chal
lenges he faced while running for
Senate without a SOCC endorse
ment. "It almost guarantee[s] a
number of votes ... Going into
the campaigning process, I knew
that I needed to work a lot harder."
Bindra said that he adopted a
more personal campaign to con
trast with what he characterized as
the more indirect strategies of
SOCC candidates. While Bindra
said he went to most of the fresh
man dorms and spoke with stu
dents personally, he ranked 14th in
number of votes, barely making
the cutoff.

"SOCC helped me stay on top
of it," said Ismael Menjivar 'l5 of
the umbrella group. "They are re
ally strong at helping with cam
paigning. They got me out there,"

"A lot of people look at the en
dorsement groups when casting
their vote because even if they
haven't met you individually, they
know that you represent those
groups," said Garima Sharma 'l5,
who was endorsed by SOCC, the
Women's Coalition, the Queer
Coalition and four other student
organizations. Sharma received
more votes than any other candi
date and 50 more votes than the
next closest.
"I was surprised at how big of a
role endorsements seems to play,"
said Albert Tomasso 'l4, one of the
three unsuccessful Senate candi
dates, to The Daily directly after
election results were announced at
the CoHo. Tomasso ran on a plat
form of bringing "joy" to the Sen
ate and did not receive endorse
ments.
"Looking at the last year, joy
would have been a useful ingredi
ent in the Senate but it's not the
only thing that could bring good
change to Stanford," Tomasso
said.

of it," said Ismael Menjivar 'l5 of
the umbrella group. "They are re
ally strong at helping with cam
paigning. They got me out there,"

"A lot of people look at the en
dorsement groups when casting
their vote because even if they
haven't met you individually, they
know that you represent those
groups," said Garima Sharma 'l5,
who was endorsed by SOCC, the
Women's Coalition, the Queer
Coalition and four other student
organizations. Sharma received
more votes than any other candi
date and 50 more votes than the
next closest.
"I was surprised at how big of a
role endorsements seems to play,"
said Albert Tomasso 'l4, one of the
three unsuccessful Senate candi
dates, to The Daily directly after
election results were announced at
the CoHo. Tomasso ran on a plat
form of bringing "joy" to the Sen
ate and did not receive endorse
ments.
"Looking at the last year, joy
would have been a useful ingredi
ent in the Senate but it's not the
only thing that could bring good
change to Stanford," Tomasso
said.

I think one thing
that I was
slightly
disappointed
with in this
year's
Senate was the
issue of
transparency.

The undergraduate student
body elected 13 freshmen and
two sophomores to the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate, election
commissioner Adam Adler 'l3
announced Saturday at a results
party held at the CoHo Saturday.
None of the 15 senators have
previously held ASSU office be
sides serving on Frosh Council,
making it the first year in at least
a decade in which neither the
Senate nor the Executive will
have any members with previous
experience in an elected ASSU
position, according to the Elec
tions Commissions archives.
With only 18 students in the
Senate race, only three candi
dates were not elected, including
one who was not actively cam
paigning.
"I'm really excited to try and
change the image of the ASSU
because I know a lot of people

view it in a negative light," Anna
Brezhneva 'l5 said of her new
position.

Brezhneva could not name
any ASSU initiative that was im
plemented this year, which she
said was evidence of the lack of
communication between the
current Senate and the student
body.

When asked what their first
initiative would be upon taking
office, several senators, including
Brezhneva, Jack Weller 'l5 and
Garima Sharma 'l5, said that
their priority would be lowering
the standard of proof for sexual
assault proceedings as worded in
the ASSU Constitution. As The
Daily previously reported, the
current burden outlined in the
ASSU Constitution requiring
evidence beyond a reasonable
doubt violates the preponder
ance of evidence standard dictat
ed by federal law. Judicial Af
fairs, however, has been using a
lower standard of proof in accor
dance with federal guidelines for
a year. According to current sen
ators, this could result in the ac
cused suing the University for
breach of the student's contract
with the ASSU because the ASSU
Constitution gives the accused
more rights than the process cur
rently used by Judicial Affairs.
Such a change would require a
constitutional amendment ap
proved by a student vote repre
senting at least 15 percent of the
student body. At their meeting last
week, current senators voted
against moving forward with such
a referendum for fear that it would
fail.
Several of the newly elected
senators have identified elevating
ASSU transparency and increas
ing ASSU accessibility as key
points to address for the new Sen
ate.
"I think one thing that I was
slightly disappointed with in this
year's Senate was the issue of
transparency," said Viraj Bindra
'l5. "[This] very clichE issue that
every senator promises and
that every senator does not follow
through on was really preva
lent last year."
All 12 Senate candidates en
dorsed by the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC) were elected
this year, compared to 12 of 15 en
dorsed candidates last year.
SOCC is a coalition of six
groups: the Asian American Stu
dents' Association (A AS A), the
Black Student Union (BSU),
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztl-n (MEChA), the Muslim
Student Awareness Network
(MSAN), the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of Col
ored People (NAACP) and the
Stanford American Indian Organ
ization (SAIO).
"I do think that a SOCC en
dorsement is a major advantage in
this race," Bindra said of the chal
lenges he faced while running for
Senate without a SOCC endorse
ment. "It almost guarantee[s] a
number of votes ... Going into
the campaigning process, I knew
that I needed to work a lot harder."
Bindra said that he adopted a
more personal campaign to con
trast with what he characterized as
the more indirect strategies of
SOCC candidates. While Bindra
said he went to most of the fresh
man dorms and spoke with stu
dents personally, he ranked 14th in
number of votes, barely making
the cutoff.

"SOCC helped me stay on top
of it," said Ismael Menjivar 'l5 of
the umbrella group. "They are re
ally strong at helping with cam
paigning. They got me out there,"
