## One third of frosh apply for SoCo SoCo and Ads Intensive results to be posted April 30 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore College re
ceived over 1,000 applications
from over 500 students or
slightly under a third of the
freshman class by the April 9
deadline, according to Lee West,
associate director of Stanford
Introductory Studies.
Sophomore College is a
three-week residential summer
program during which incoming
second-year undergraduates
participate in seminars of 12 to
14 students and "engage in in
tense academic exploration,
forming a community of schol
ars with peers, upperclass assis
tants and professors," according
to the Sophomore College web
site.
This year, eight seminars will
be held partially or fully off
campus.
"All on-campus seminars in
clude field trips as a part of their

curriculum," West added in an
email to The Daily.
"We don't place any pre-de
termined limit on the number of
off-campus seminars," he said.
"What's most important is pro
viding students with a range of
compelling seminars spanning
the disciplines."
While seminars involving
travel especially abroad, but
also to destinations in the Unit
ed States tended to receive a
higher number of applications,
"many on-campus seminars re
ceived the same number of ap
plications as off-campus semi
nars," West said.
He added that the Sopho
more College staff members are
always looking to improve the
program, from developing new
seminars to improving the over
all experience for students.
"This year, we are working

with the two Sophomore Col
lege Assistants selected by facul
ty for each course to create more
opportunities for students to
share with each other what they
are doing in their seminars,
something students have told us
in program evaluations that they
would like to see increased,"
West said.
Stanford Arts Intensive also
takes place during the three
weeks in September before the
start of fall quarter. Data on Arts
Intensive applications, which
were also due April 9, is not yet
available.
"Arts Intensive offers students
the opportunity to study inten
sively with Stanford arts faculty
and small groups of other Stan
ford students passionate about
art," according to the website.
Marie-Louise Catsalis, a con
ductor, vocal coach and keyboard
accompanist at Stanford, will be
leading an Arts Intensive semi
nar, An Operatic Play: 'Mozart's 7
Deadly Sins," along with vocal
coach Nova Jimenez.
"Mozart is one of the most
loved composers of all time," Cat
salis wrote in an email to The
Daily. "There is no better way into
the world of opera than through
his repertoire,"
"We will take that as a starting
point in creating our own musical
play," she added. "Stanford Opera
Workshop created 'Mozart's 7
Deadly Sins' in winter 2011. Fol

lowing that success, we used that
show as a blueprint, but it will
generate a new show: totally dif
ferent cast, musical numbers and
script."
Catsalis added that in choos
ing seminar participants from the
applicants, she and Jimenez are
looking for students who are will
ing to try something new and
jump into creating a theatrical
product.
"We want to find students who
might like to design costumes or
sets from scratch, singers and ac
tors who would like to bring a
character to life, instrumentalists
who would like to get to know the
music of Mozart from the inside
out, by arranging for our ensem

ble," Catsalis said.
"In short," she continued," we
want students who will not be shy
to unleash their creativity: one of
the most interesting applications I
have read so far comes from a stu
dent who plays flute and sings, but
preferably would like to do both
in this production. That is the sort
of enthusiasm we are looking
for."
Decisions about Sophomore
College and Arts Intensive will be
released April 30 after 5 p.m. on
the Stanford September Studies
websites for the respective pro
grams.

Workshop created 'Mozart's 7
Deadly Sins' in winter 2011. Fol

lowing that success, we used that
show as a blueprint, but it will
generate a new show: totally dif
ferent cast, musical numbers and
script."
Catsalis added that in choos
ing seminar participants from the
applicants, she and Jimenez are
looking for students who are will
ing to try something new and
jump into creating a theatrical
product.
"We want to find students who
might like to design costumes or
sets from scratch, singers and ac
tors who would like to bring a
character to life, instrumentalists
who would like to get to know the
music of Mozart from the inside
out, by arranging for our ensem

ble," Catsalis said.
"In short," she continued," we
want students who will not be shy
to unleash their creativity: one of
the most interesting applications I
have read so far comes from a stu
dent who plays flute and sings, but
preferably would like to do both
in this production. That is the sort
of enthusiasm we are looking
for."
Decisions about Sophomore
College and Arts Intensive will be
released April 30 after 5 p.m. on
the Stanford September Studies
websites for the respective pro
grams.
