The four-day AMENDS conference brought together 36 youth activists
from 17 countries. The delegates presented their international work to
their peers and attended talks by speakers on global issues.
Stanford community and a
screening of "A Whisper to a
Roar," a new documentary pro
duced by Larry Diamond and
Ben Moses and presented by the
Moulay Hicham Foundation.
They also gave presentations on
their work to their fellow dele
gates. The presentations will also
be available to the public on the
Stanford University You Tube
channel.
One of the delegates at the
conference was Selma Maarouf,
an Amnesty International mem
ber and Moroccan activist sup
porting the country's pro
democracy February 20 move
ment.
"I wanted [to come to
AMENDS] to share the story of
my movement in Morocco be
cause most people don't know
much about it compared to the
other revolutions in the region,"
she said.
Maarouf described the con
ference as eye-opening.
"The discussions were amaz
ing and very rich," she said. "I
also liked how the talks empha
sized how different countries in
the region should work together
and see the bright side in order
to bring positive change."
Another delegate was Abdul
lah Al-Fakharany from Egypt,
who founded the civilian jour
nalist news network Rassd News
Network (RNN). RNN's Arabic
language Facebook group cur
rently has over 1.5 million sub
scribers.
"I wanted to be with people
who did not think in the same
way, so that I can understand a
different point of view and re
move any stereotypes I had," Al-
Fakharany said.
"I believe in the strength of
youth, so it was inspiring to lis
ten to the delegates and discuss
their initiatives," he added. "It
was the amazing to put my touch
into their ideas and have them
respond to mine."
Stanford alumni and students
were also represented in the del
egate pool.
Fadi Quran 'lO, a Palestinian-
American student and nonvio
lent youth activist for the Pales
tinian territories, recently arrest
ed in the West Bank during a
protest, returned to campus for
the conference.
Quran's work focuses not
only on nonviolent resistance,
but also on alternative energy in
the region.
"I want to emphasize the ne
cessity of alternative energy in
the region and how it needs to be
integrated with the cultures and
how people live," he said.
Quran said he sees the diver
sity of the delegates represented
as one of the key strengths of the
conference.
"I think right now it is very
important for youth from the
Middle East to establish rela
tions with countries in the re
gion," he said. "This is necessary
to prevent going back to the
[dictatorships] that existed."

Elliot Stoller 'l3 and Khaled
Alshawi 'l3 founded AMENDS
last year after a chance meeting.
"We met at Coupa CafE in
February 2011 through a mutual
friend and knew right after that
that we had the same interests
and passions," Alshawi said.
"Our talk went from two min
utes to two hours."
"With everything happening
with the Arab Spring at the time,
[we talked about] the lack of
Middle Eastern resources at
Stanford and were inspired to do
something at Stanford to con
nect and empower leaders,"
Stoller said.
Stoller added that on the
same day, he coincidentally had
a meeting with Larry Diamond
'73 M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO, director
of CDDRL, and decided to men
tion the ideas he had discussed
with Alshawi. Diamond advised
Stoller to write up a proposal.
"It just blew up after that,"
Alshawi said.
A year later, the pair reflect
ed on the process and pressure
of establishing the first
AMENDS conference, describ
ing it as laborious but rewarding.
"We had to make sure we
could deliver on our ideas, and
we are just blown away by the
quality of the delegates and the
passion they have to seek
change and grow their initia
tives," Stoller said.
After recruiting Stanford stu
dents to join the AMENDS
team, the next step was to find
delegates. The team did so by
creating partnerships with non
profits and universities to identi
fy youth leaders. They also post
ed open applications, which
were advertised through social
networks like Facebook.
Overall, the conference re
ceived 300 applications from 20
countries for 40 available dele
gate positions. Eighty potential
delegates were selected for
Skype interviews to determine
the final set.
"We wanted as diverse of a
group as possible," Stoller said.
"But the most important criteri
on was how passionate they
were, and how well they could
articulate their initiatives and
ideas."
"After securing the delegates,
it wasn't too hard to get speakers
who were eager to come speak
to them and meet them," Al
shawi said.
Stoller and Alshawi gave
credit to the AMENDS team
members for their "incredible
hard work and how they all
stepped up to pull the confer
ence together." The pair said
they have made plans to ensure
that the conference continues to
run and develop in the future, in
cluding bringing on Meredith
Wheeler 'l4 as a co-president.
Wheeler is a member of The
Daily Editorial Board.
"We stressed from the very
beginning that we wanted this to
be a thing that would organical
ly develop at Stanford," Stoller
said. "We feel like we have set up
the right institutions for that to
happen."
