## Low turnout results in three pending GSC seats Graduate student voters decrease by 30 percent 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
Results for three seats on the
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
are still pending in an election that
saw a nearly 30 percent decrease in
voter turnout. 1,047 graduate stu
dents voted in this spring's ASSU
election, down from last year's
1,477.
Due to a twelve-way tie in the
medicine district, a seven-way tie in
the education district and a two
way tie in the natural science dis
trict, the names of the students who
will be filling these spots have yet to
be announced. The top vote-getters
in the medicine and education dis
trict each received one vote, while
both of the candidates still in the
running for the natural science seat
received two votes.
ASSU elections commissioner

Adam Adler 'l3 said he plans con
tact each of the two candidates run
ning for the natural science district
to ask which one wants the position.
He added that he will also meet
with the current GSC to decide on a
policy to employ for the remaining
ties.
"There is no fixed policy," said
Nikhil Rajendra, assistant elections
commissioner for graduate stu
dents. "We must meet with the cur
rent GSC to settle on one policy to
use."
Until a policy regarding ties had
been applied, the elections commis
sion will not tell the current GSC
the names of the candidates still in
the running for contested districts.
Despite the overall decrease in
voter turnout, Rajendra pointed
out that the three districts with the
highest votes had a significant im
provement in voter turnout when
compared with last year.
Current GSC member Sjoerd de
Ridder, who was re-elected as a
council member for the earth sci

ence district, won the most at-large
votes overall with 227, followed
closely by fellow incumbent Anne-
Laure Cuvilliez with 219 at-large
votes. Ridder and Cuvilliez were
elected last year with 332 and 410
votes, respectively.
"I'm honored to receive so
much popular support, but I'm dis
appointed that the voter turnout
was lower than last year," Ridder
said.
Ridder added that for GSC elec
tions, campaigning is not as promi
nent as seen at the undergraduate
level because "it's much less poli
tics."
He attributed the low graduate
student turnout to lack of advertis
ing.
"We don't really campaign all
that much," Ridder said. "We most
ly just write a strong statement on
the website, and we try to advertise
the elections among grad students."
"I think maybe we did not ad
