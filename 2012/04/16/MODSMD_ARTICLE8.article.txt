First Round Results
■ Zimbroff-Wagstaff
□ Open Source Candidates
□ MacGregor-Dennis & Druthi

The field for ASSU Executive began
strong but quickly became a two
horse race after several slates
dropped out.
Zimbroff-Wagstaff succesfully
leveraged their endorsements,
and MacGregor-Dennis' cam
paign suffered from a late-break
ing controversy surrounding his
scraping of student email ad
dresses and paying for Facebook
subscribers.
Earning 80 percent of the total
vote in the first round, Zimbroff-
Wagstaff took control in one of the
most one-sided elections in recent
ASSU history.
The Incredibles took sophomore
class president, Foster the Juniors
took the junior race and The Sen
ior Experience will serve as presi
dent for the class of 2013.
