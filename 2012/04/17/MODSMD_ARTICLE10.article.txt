# Researchers identify genes connected to bone weakness
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Matt Bettonville 
Chief of the Stanford Preventa
tive Research Center John loanni
dis and a worldwide research con
sortium have identified 32 genetic
regions associated with osteo
porosis and susceptibility to bone

fracture. The expression of the ge
netic regions was previously un
known.
The study is significant for sev
eral reasons. Directly, the informa
tion could help identify high-risk
individuals. However, the spread
of factors across 32 regions also in
dicates that a variety of factors
combine to contribute to disease,
rather than a single disordered
gene.
"We're learning that the genet
ic architecture of disease is very
complex," loannidis said in an arti
cle published by the Stanford
School of Medicine.
loannidis also noted that even
more contributing genetic regions
may remain unidentified, and it
took a consortium of researchers
to find even 32.
"It's likely that our expecta
tions have been too high in terms
of what single studies can accom
plish," loannidis said. "Each one of
the many teams identified at most
only one or two markers; many
found none."
Because so many factors, both
genetic and environmental, con
tribute to the development of
bone disease, the study is unlikely
to produce any changes in patient
care.
