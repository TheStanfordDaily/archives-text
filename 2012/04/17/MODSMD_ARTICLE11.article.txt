## CROSSING BOUNDARIES Saldívar explores ethnic identity through literature

Hanging in Ramon
Saldfvar's office,
across from his
many shelves of
books, is a framed
poster of "The Last Supper of the
Chicano Heroes." The mural,
painted on the walls of Casa Zap
ata's dining hall, bears the solem
nity of a Da Vinci painting, but
also brings to mind the Beatles'
"Sgt. Pepper" album cover with its
medley of colorfully garbed icons
including Che Guevara, Bobby
Kennedy and Frida Kahlo.
As a winner of the 2011 Na
tional Humanities Medal present
ed by President Obama, Saldfvar
belongs to a distinguished group
that includes writers such as Toni
Morrison. John Updike and Elie
Wiesel.
Last September, Saldfvar be
came director of the Center for
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity (CSRE) at Stanford.
For Saldfvar, engaging in ethnic
studies is away of fostering a
sense of commonality among
America's many different cultural
identities.
Growing up in the border town
of Brownsville, Texas, Saldfvar
was exposed to different cultures
at an early age. He vividly remem
bers seeing the portraits of his un
cles in their U.S. military uniforms
standing in front of the crossed
flags of Mexico and the United
States.
"In a very natural way, these
pictures represented our bina
tional allegiance, the transnation
al identification that my family
was both Mexican and Ameri
can," he said.

When Saldfvar left home to at
tend the University of Texas at
Austin, he entered a world charac
terized by a lack of diversity and a
monolingual environment funda
mentally different from the one in
which he grew up.
However, as a graduate stu
dent at Yale, he found himself in
an experimental atmosphere in
which new ways to think about lit
erature were developing. It was at
Yale that he became well versed
in European modernism and the
Anglo-American tradition, which
would later culminate in the pub
lication of his first book, "Figural
Language in the Novel: The Flow
ers of Speech from Cervantes to
Joyce," in 1984.
Inspired by the momentous
events and movements of the
19705, such as the Vietnam War,
feminism, labor struggles and the
civil rights movement, he chose
areas of study in which the canon
icity of literature was being radi
cally rethought and reformed.
According to Saldfvar, this ex
perience had a profound impact.
When he returned to the Univer
sity of Texas to assume his first
teaching position, he felt it was his
duty "to open up our sense of why
certain kinds of writing are impor
tant" and to explore under-recog
nized works by minorities and
women.
Saldfvar explored minority
centered writings in his second
book published in 1990, "Chicano
Narrative: The Dialectics of Dif
ference," which explored the nar
ratives of Chicano communities.
"The book pioneered the field
of Chicano literary studies and re
ally helped to recognize the im
portance of that literary tradition

from a hemispheric perspective,"
said English Department Chair
Gavin Jones.
Prior to this book, there was no
definitive account of Chicano lit
erature, which Saldivar found as
tonishing, considering the fact
that certain Chicano communities
had already been established for
almost 180 years.
Since childhood, Saldivar had
wanted to help his community in
Brownsville and others like it by
representing their unheard voic
es. He reflected that, in away, writ
ing Chicano Narratives afforded
him that opportunity.
Saldivar said he felt that the
writing process was even more
meaningful because of his incor
poration of the book's material
into his classes.
In addition to his extensive
archival research for his third
book, a biography on Mexican-
American folklorist Americo
Paredes, Saldivar used insights
obtained from his students to help
shape the final product.
"This was a book that sprang
from conversation. I'd put out
ideas to my students, and they'd
respond," Saldivar said. "I
thought it was important to add
this interactive aspect to the
whole process."
Saldivar's target audience in
cluded young readers he hoped
would take ownership of a "grand
tradition of creativity and proud
history" not as discussed but still
belonging to this younger genera
tion as Americans.
For Saldivar, much of the satis
faction he received from his work
inside and outside of the class
room came from opening new av
enues for student exploration of
literature by allowing students to
study writers that they might oth
erwise never encounter.
Saldivar connected this awak
ening of literature-induced
awareness to his description of his
own childhood.
"When you're young the world

you live in is the world," Saldivar
said. "You don't know other ways
of being."
Saldivar said he has found that
when students discover these
other ways of "being" in his class
es, the discovery has a meaningful
impact on them.
"Sometimes two, three or four
years after a student graduates, I'll
get a letter from them saying one
of the books we read changed
their life," he said.
In 1994, Saldivar led a commit
tee at Stanford that recommend
ed bringing together the African
and African American Studies
Program and new programs in
Asian American, Chicano and
Native American studies. This led
to the creation of the Center for
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity (CSRE) a year and a
half later.
The CSRE program has since
grown into a model of ethnic stud
ies for universities across the
country. According to Saldivar, it
is critical that different ethnic
studies be studied in concert with
one another to emphasize not only
the uniqueness of each culture, but
also the overarching commonality
that makes them all American.
"Where ethnic studies pro-

grams are not done as well is
where they break down into iso
lated pockets, where there is no
sense of each group's relationship
to a bigger set of shared issues,
goals and ideals," he said. "Here at
Stanford, the ethnic studies pro
gram pays full attention and re
spect to the independence of indi
vidual communities, but also cre
ates opportunities for them to
work together and communicate
across ethnic lines."
Saldivar's own work does not
sit in isolation in academia. In
stead, his ideas continue to pro
foundly affect those around him.
"As a Chicana who aspires to
become a literary critic one day, I
was quite moved when I watched
the live stream of Professor Saldi
var receiving the National Hu
manities Medal from my laptop,"
said one of his former students,
Guadalupe Carrillo, a sixth-year
English graduate student. "At that
moment, I realized what makes
Professor Saldivar a true intellec
tual leader is that he not only pro
duces good ideas, he produces
ideas that touch the lives of many
people in this country."

mentally different from the one in
which he grew up.
However, as a graduate stu
dent at Yale, he found himself in
an experimental atmosphere in
which new ways to think about lit
erature were developing. It was at
Yale that he became well versed
in European modernism and the
Anglo-American tradition, which
would later culminate in the pub
lication of his first book, "Figural
Language in the Novel: The Flow
ers of Speech from Cervantes to
Joyce," in 1984.
Inspired by the momentous
events and movements of the
19705, such as the Vietnam War,
feminism, labor struggles and the
civil rights movement, he chose
areas of study in which the canon
icity of literature was being radi
cally rethought and reformed.
According to Saldfvar, this ex
perience had a profound impact.
When he returned to the Univer
sity of Texas to assume his first
teaching position, he felt it was his
duty "to open up our sense of why
certain kinds of writing are impor
tant" and to explore under-recog
nized works by minorities and
women.
Saldfvar explored minority
centered writings in his second
book published in 1990, "Chicano
Narrative: The Dialectics of Dif
ference," which explored the nar
ratives of Chicano communities.
"The book pioneered the field
of Chicano literary studies and re
ally helped to recognize the im
portance of that literary tradition

from a hemispheric perspective,"
said English Department Chair
Gavin Jones.
Prior to this book, there was no
definitive account of Chicano lit
erature, which Saldivar found as
tonishing, considering the fact
that certain Chicano communities
had already been established for
almost 180 years.
Since childhood, Saldivar had
wanted to help his community in
Brownsville and others like it by
representing their unheard voic
es. He reflected that, in away, writ
ing Chicano Narratives afforded
him that opportunity.
Saldivar said he felt that the
writing process was even more
meaningful because of his incor
poration of the book's material
into his classes.
In addition to his extensive
archival research for his third
book, a biography on Mexican-
American folklorist Americo
Paredes, Saldivar used insights
obtained from his students to help
shape the final product.
"This was a book that sprang
from conversation. I'd put out
ideas to my students, and they'd
respond," Saldivar said. "I
thought it was important to add
this interactive aspect to the
whole process."
Saldivar's target audience in
cluded young readers he hoped
would take ownership of a "grand
tradition of creativity and proud
history" not as discussed but still
belonging to this younger genera
tion as Americans.
For Saldivar, much of the satis
faction he received from his work
inside and outside of the class
room came from opening new av
enues for student exploration of
literature by allowing students to
study writers that they might oth
erwise never encounter.
Saldivar connected this awak
ening of literature-induced
awareness to his description of his
own childhood.
"When you're young the world

you live in is the world," Saldivar
said. "You don't know other ways
of being."
Saldivar said he has found that
when students discover these
other ways of "being" in his class
es, the discovery has a meaningful
impact on them.
"Sometimes two, three or four
years after a student graduates, I'll
get a letter from them saying one
of the books we read changed
their life," he said.
In 1994, Saldivar led a commit
tee at Stanford that recommend
ed bringing together the African
and African American Studies
Program and new programs in
Asian American, Chicano and
Native American studies. This led
to the creation of the Center for
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity (CSRE) a year and a
half later.
The CSRE program has since
grown into a model of ethnic stud
ies for universities across the
country. According to Saldivar, it
is critical that different ethnic
studies be studied in concert with
one another to emphasize not only
the uniqueness of each culture, but
also the overarching commonality
that makes them all American.
"Where ethnic studies pro-

grams are not done as well is
where they break down into iso
lated pockets, where there is no
sense of each group's relationship
to a bigger set of shared issues,
goals and ideals," he said. "Here at
Stanford, the ethnic studies pro
gram pays full attention and re
spect to the independence of indi
vidual communities, but also cre
ates opportunities for them to
work together and communicate
across ethnic lines."
Saldivar's own work does not
sit in isolation in academia. In
stead, his ideas continue to pro
foundly affect those around him.
"As a Chicana who aspires to
become a literary critic one day, I
was quite moved when I watched
the live stream of Professor Saldi
var receiving the National Hu
manities Medal from my laptop,"
said one of his former students,
Guadalupe Carrillo, a sixth-year
English graduate student. "At that
moment, I realized what makes
Professor Saldivar a true intellec
tual leader is that he not only pro
duces good ideas, he produces
ideas that touch the lives of many
people in this country."

English and Comparative Literature Professor Ramon Saldivar was awarded a National Humanities Medal by
President Obama for his research and teaching on globalization, transnationalism and Chicano studies.
Hanging in Ramon
Saldfvar's office,
across from his
many shelves of
books, is a framed
poster of "The Last Supper of the
Chicano Heroes." The mural,
painted on the walls of Casa Zap

nity of a Da Vinci painting, but
also brings to mind the Beatles'
"Sgt. Pepper" album cover with its
medley of colorfully garbed icons
including Che Guevara, Bobby
Kennedy and Frida Kahlo.
As a winner of the 2011 Na

belongs to a distinguished group
that includes writers such as Toni

Wiesel.
Last September, Saldfvar be
came director of the Center for
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity (CSRE) at Stanford.
For Saldfvar, engaging in ethnic
studies is away of fostering a
sense of commonality among
America's many different cultural
identities.
Growing up in the border town
of Brownsville, Texas, Saldfvar
was exposed to different cultures
at an early age. He vividly remem
bers seeing the portraits of his un
cles in their U.S. military uniforms
standing in front of the crossed
flags of Mexico and the United
States.
"In a very natural way, these
pictures represented our bina
tional allegiance, the transnation
al identification that my family
was both Mexican and Ameri
can," he said.
