## OP-ED Another loss 
### PATRICIA KARL IN-NEUMANN Senior Associate Dean for Religious Life ALEJANDRO MARTINEZ Senior Associate Director, Consultation Liaison, Counseling Psychological Services JIM CADENA Director of the Arts in Residential Education 
Dear Friends,
As we are absorbing the shock
and sadness of Sam Wopat's death,
holding one another close and try
ing to hold conversations about
what it means to be a community,
we learned of another poignant
loss in our Stanford family. With
great sadness, we learned from her
father that on the day she was to re
turn for spring quarter, Cady Hine
died.
Cady entered Stanford in 2005
and having stopped out several
times, she had returned to major
in English. We came to know and
admire her as a brave and forth
right advocate for student well
ness. Cady was frequently in at
tendance at the grief group organ
ized by the Office for Religious
Life, Residential Education and
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), to provide a
time and space for students who
are mourning to be together, to
acknowledge their struggles, to
help one another through the par
allel universes of sunny Stanford
and dark loss. Cady came to the
grief group following the suicide
of her mother. She did not sugar
coat the circumstances of her
death. On the contrary, she was
passionate about reducing the
stigma associated with mental ill
ness. Cady co-founded Stanford
Peace of Mind to expand aware
ness about mental health issues, to
create dialogue about the cost of
high achievement and perfection
ism and to enable those struggling
with mental illness to thrive. She
was forthright about her own
bipolar diagnosis and hospitaliza
tion. Raising awareness and de
creasing the stigma of mental
health distress was one significant
part of her commitment. Literally,
putting her body where her
mouth is, was another. When four
high school students in Palo Alto
took their own lives at the train
tracks a short distance from Stan
ford, Cady became a volunteer
with Track Watch, patrolling the
railroad crossing to be a visible
manifestation of the community's
concern for young people. She un
derstood that restricting the most
available means to die by one's
own hand is a significant way to

reduce tragedy.
Many of us admired how pas
sionate Cady was about making
Stanford and Palo Alto a better,
safer, more humane place. It was
not always easy to listen to her. We
prefer the airbrushed picture to
the untouched close up. Cady
sometimes made people uncom
fortable by her honesty, yet, even
as she named the shortcomings of
our community and our culture,
her generous soul and inspiring
intentions always shone through.
In her honor, as part of the legacy
of her brief but passionate life, let
us become the community she en
visioned one that is unafraid to
acknowledge our imperfections,
one that reaches out to those in
need with generosity, one where
reaching out is welcomed as a sign
of strength and health and not as a
measure of weakness. We will
miss you Cady, but we will try to
become a Stanford where stu
dents, staff and faculty can indeed
feel and foster peace of mind.
