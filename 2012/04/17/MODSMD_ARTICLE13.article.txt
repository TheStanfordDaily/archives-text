# Why are the women better?

### EMMA PIERSON '13 NAT ROTH 'I4 
Take a look at Stanford's
sports performance, and
you'll notice a striking dis
parity: The women outperform
the men. When we tracked per
formance over the past decade in
six sports for which we could easi
ly find reliable data, women won
more than the men in all four
sports measured by W-L record
basketball (87 percent vs. 63
percent), tennis (96 percent vs. 84
percent), baseball/softball (71
percent vs. 65 percent), and soccer
(79 percent vs. 52 percent) and
were ranked higher on average
than the men in the two sports
without W-L records golf (18.3
vs. 28.0) and track and field (12.5
vs 16.3). Ten of Stanford's last
twelve NCAA championships
have come from women's teams.
It isn't that the men are bad
and we're not just saying that to
forestall assaults by the basketball
team, it's just that the women are
better, and by a highly statistically
significant margin.
Why is this? A first hypothesis
involves the football team and
Title IX. To comply with Title IX,
Stanford spends comparable
amounts of scholarship money on
its men's and women's programs.
Because the football team funds
go only to the men, the remaining
women's programs should be bet
ter funded than their men's coun
terparts. More scholarship money
means more competitive success.
But this hypothesis doesn't hold
up under examination. Virtually
every school Stanford competes
with has a football team, and
should experience the same ef
fect; the "women's advantage"
will cancel out. And if this effect
were responsible for Stanford
women's success, you would ex
pect to see the same effect in
other schools with large football
programs, which you don't.
So maybe it's because men's
sports pay better? Stanford's re
cruiting advantage comes in large
part from its academics. But the
salary bonus conferred by a Stan
ford degree isn't that economical
ly valuable to a male basketball
star, who if he goes pro will make
on average $3 million a year; on
the other hand, it's extremely

valuable to a female basketball
star, who will earn $55,000 a year.
This isn't to say, of course, that
Stanford athletes are materialistic
moneygrubbers, but on the mar
gins people do respond to eco
nomic incentives, and Stanford's
are more alluring to female re
cruits. This theory is plausible but
not borne out by the data. If it
were true, you would expect Stan
ford's women's winning advan
tage to be largest in sports with the
largest male/female salary dis
crepancy. In fact, the reverse is
true: Women's teams do best in
sports with less salary discrepancy.

Ultimately, we think the rea
son Stanford does better in fe
male sports is the same reason it
brings home so many champi
onships: The University cares
about all sports, not just the
stereotypical men's powerhouses,
football and basketball. (While
the football team has lately been
excellent, in general it is not: Over
the past decade, it has won 47 per
cent of its games.) So while other
schools focus on their men's
teams, Stanford puts compara
tively more resources into its fe
male teams, and enjoys more suc
cess. It also started building its fe
male programs earlier, during an
era when most schools couldn't
have cared less, creating a founda
tion that built on itself. (Stanford
women's basketball, founded in
1898, actually predates men's bas
ketball, and Stanford women's
tennis has been around since
1903.) Stanford's differential suc
cess is testament to the gender in
equality that still persists in sports
and to how well you can do
when you value both genders
equally.

male sports is the same reason it
brings home so many champi
onships: The University cares
about all sports, not just the
stereotypical men's powerhouses,
football and basketball. (While
the football team has lately been
excellent, in general it is not: Over
the past decade, it has won 47 per
cent of its games.) So while other
schools focus on their men's
teams, Stanford puts compara
tively more resources into its fe
male teams, and enjoys more suc
cess. It also started building its fe
male programs earlier, during an
era when most schools couldn't
have cared less, creating a founda
tion that built on itself. (Stanford
women's basketball, founded in
1898, actually predates men's bas
ketball, and Stanford women's
tennis has been around since
1903.) Stanford's differential suc
cess is testament to the gender in
equality that still persists in sports
and to how well you can do
when you value both genders
equally.
