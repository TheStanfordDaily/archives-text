# HALF-INVENTED

£ £ | take it 'til you make it!"
|H It's a pretty common
-1- phrase, especially in the
business world and entertainment
industry. I've heard many guest
writers and business leaders attrib
ute their success to this mantra. It's
a pretty simple concept : If you pre
tend to be confident and success
ful for long enough, you will even
tually become confident and suc
cessful. Buy expensive clothes even
if you're getting paid minimum
wage; they will think you are rich
and capable. Never let on that you
don't know about whatever is being
discussed. Just say things like,
"You're so right, and that's what the
(insert: Conservatives/Liberals/
French) will never understand" or
"I liked their first album better,"
and then inconspicuously exit the
conversation. It doesn't matter if
you're sad on the inside be
happy on the outside. Basically, just
be yourself, but a better yourself...
so actually, not yourself at all.
But it still works, right? The peo
ple who swear by the "fake it 'til you
make it" mentality all seem so suc
cessful and happy. For example,
take that one guest speaker from a
couple weeks ago. He had a fancy
suit and was super nice to everyone.
He even told me my views on
health care reform were genius, but
they would never get passed in this
country because the conservatives
are too ... oh, wait, now I get it.
There are some major problems
with this mentality. The line of when
a person has "made it" is pretty ar
bitrary because there is always

more to make. Why quit what has
worked in the past?
And then there's the fear of what
kind of effect "faking it" has on oth
ers when it spills into other areas of
your life. Imagine one of your par
ents saying, "We never really cared
for you that much, but we pretended
to, hoping that we might eventually
grow to love you" or your favorite
professor saying, "Yeah, that stuff I
taught the class that nobody under
stood I don't get it either. But I'm
glad you thought my suit looked
good."
But the greatest damage is in
what "faking it" does to the person
constantly playing pretend. I'm not a
huge John Mayer fan, but he has a
song called "Tracing" that describes
the loneliness of faking emotions in
an empty relationship. He describes
the song as saying, "When is this
going to kick in? Cause this feels like
it's never going to kick in. When is
this sex going to turn into love? You
think one runs into the other; it really
doesn't."
There's a bitter hollowness that
comes from lying to yourself and
everyone around you. You get the
feeling that no one really knows
you, or that you don't even know
yourself. Even if you make it on the
outside by lying to yourself, you
never really make it where it counts.
About a year ago, I was talking
with one of my friends about to
graduate. He described his college
experience by saying, "ft was alright.
There were some good moments,
but I was pretty unhappy for the last
three years. College kind of sucked.

But, whatever. It happens. Life
moves on." That answer blew my
mind. College is supposed to be the
best years of your life, and there he
was so honestly and casually dis
missing it. It shook me up.
For my first two years at Stan
ford, I wasn't always completely
happy either. I enjoyed some things
and made friends, but I didn't really
feel like I had a purpose for being
here, and I spent a lot of time look
ing for excuses to take time off and
be in the real world. I felt like I did
n't really fit in, and, to be honest, I
didn't want to fit in with what I un
derstood a typical Stanford kid to
be. I didn't like these feelings of dis
contentment, but they were there
nonetheless.
Rather than addressing them, I
decided to fake it. I put on a smile
and exaggerated how great every
thing was out of some absurd fear of
"failing" the college experience.
But the brutal honesty and self
awareness of my friend encouraged
me to be really honest with myself,
and I started being honest with oth
ers. When asked, I would say that
college was alright, and I describe
both the good and bad. My impossi
ble expectations were lowered, and
I've actually enjoyed myself much
more since then. "Fake it 'til you
make it" may fool others, but I pre
fer to confront, embrace and make
the best of the truth.

You won't have to fake it with Chase.
