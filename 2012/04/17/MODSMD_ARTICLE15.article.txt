# FROM FARM TO FORK
## When pleasure causes pain 
### Jenny Rempel 
There are still a few chocolate
bunnies hanging on in the
kitchen. Ever since an unfor
tunate childhood experience in
volving what appeared to be a
chocolate Easter bunny but was in
fact a bunny-shaped piece of chalk,
I've been a bit wary of the treat.
That doesn't mean I think choco
late is anything less than the "food
of the gods," which is the translation
of its genus name,Theobroma. I've
just always had a bit of a chalky feel
ing in my mouth at the sight of Cad
bury eggs and Lindt bunnies. But
you don't have to bite into a bunny
chock full of chalk to get a bad taste
in your mouth about the chocolate
industry.
In a globalized economy, treats
consumed purely for pleasure can
still bring great suffering in other
parts of the world. Before delving
into chocolate's dark secrets, it's
useful to start with a little history.
Cacao has been an important
food ingredient in Mesoamerica for
several millennia. If you took out
the milk and sugar from Coupa
Cafe's Spicy Maya hot chocolate, it
might not be all that different from
the Aztec drink xocolatl, which is a
spicy concoction of cacao, vanilla,
chile powder and achiote. Milk and
sugar did not become part and par
cel to "chocolate" until Europeans
decided to market this New World
drink in their own realm. But unlike
the Mayan drink, chocolate in West
ern cultures has almost always been
reserved for sweets and desserts. It's
never been a daily staple.
Despite chocolate's dispensabil
ity as a foodstuff, our love of this
product has led to a history of ex
ploitation to increase production.
Once the Spanish conquered the
Aztecs, chocolate exportation to
Europe began in bulk. As demand
grew for the newly sweetened

cacao plant, the Spaniards began
enslaving Mesoamericans to ensure
adequate supply. Sadly, slavery still
exists on cacao plantations.
Currently, two-thirds of the
world's cocoa is produced in West
Africa. In recent years, human
rights activists and journalists from
CNN and the BBC have exposed
cases of child labor, human traffick
ing and slavery on cacao farms. Yet
Nestle, Mars and Hershey's
huge players in the chocolate indus
try continue to source their
cocoa from Ghana and the Ivory
Coast.
More than 10 years ago, Sen.
Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep.
Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) tried to pass a
law mandating the use of a labeling
system for chocolate. Following
heavy lobbying by the billion-dollar
chocolate industry, this law was re
duced to a voluntary protocol
whereby industry leaders would
voluntarily certify that their choco
late was free of child labor. Despite
three deadline extensions for the
establishment of an auditing sys
tem, these provisions have not been
met. A study fromTulane Universi
ty suggests industry leaders have
failed to contact 97 percent of Ivory
Coast farmers to even begin a dia
logue about child labor, much less
end trafficking and establish prom
ised poverty remediation pro
grams.
So, are independent certification
programs an answer to the choco
late industry's failed promises?
Sadly, even Fair Trade Certified
farms in West Africa have been

found using child labor as recently
as 2010. This certification program
and others like it, including Rain
forest Alliance, continue to source
their cocoa from West Africa.
The Food Empowerment Proj
ect, a nonprofit organization based
out of San Jose, urges consumers to
purchase fair-trade chocolate made
from Latin American cocoa. Their
website has a list of suppliers, such
as Equal Exchange, Sunridge
Farms, Theo Chocolate and Vivani,
who source only from Latin Amer
ican countries. Favorites like Trader
Joe's, Lindt and Ritter still source
from West Africa. Clif Bar owners
refused to even offer transparency
about a country of origin. While it is
impossible to guarantee that cocoa
from Latin American farms is free
of child labor, this list is a step in the
right direction. Luckily, many hous
es on the Row source from Sun
ridge Farms, and Stanford Catering
uses TCHO chocolate, which is ac
tively working to improve its sourc
ing chain.
It's time for my inner chocoholic
to realize that, contrary to popular
belief, chocolate is not a category on
the new USDA food pyramid. It is
fundamentally a luxury good. And
if we realized the suffering caused
by our consumption of this luxury,
we would understand that it is
worth spending a few dollars more
for a slave-free product.
Farmworkers are mistreated on
many farms not just cocoa plan
tations â€” but this is one area in
which we can achieve a definite
change through our purchasing de
cisions. We cannot continue to sup
port a corporate system that views
child labor and slavery as the norm.

tious chocoholic? Let Jenny know at
