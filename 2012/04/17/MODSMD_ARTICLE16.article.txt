## The 						greatest team in the world 
### Tom Taylor 
By the time you read this,
it might all be over. At
noon today, my soccer
team kicks off a crucial
match that could all but
secure a return to arguably the
biggest stage in the entire world.
Reading FC has turned a season
that once threatened relegation into
one that looks almost certain to re
turn it to the Premier League for the
second time in its history. As I write
this, the team sits three points clear
of second place in the Champi
onship and six points ahead of third,
with just three games remaining.
To understanding how remark
able this is, consider that at the end of
November, with over a third of the
season already completed, Reading
sat 15 and 13 points adrift of the lead
ing teams Southampton and West
Ham, respectively. Since the turn of
the year, though, it has won 15 of 18
games, and with recent road victo
ries over both aforementioned
teams, Reading leapfrogged them to
the top of the table.
I am a little wary of saying any
thing that could jinx this phenome
nal resurgence, but it is hard to imag
ine that the team in best form in the
Championship, and perhaps even in
all of English soccer, won't finish
among the top two and secure auto
matic promotion.
And with that, everything
changes. People will suddenly have
heard of my hometown (when I
wrote my second-ever column for
The Daily back in 2009, the copy ed
itor cut "Reading FC" down to the
meaningless "FC"), it will be accept
able again to support the Royals and
I might even be able to watch them
play on TV while in the United
States.
If the team does move up, life will
quickly get a lot more difficult. The
Championship is an incredibly
tough place to play soccer, but the
playing field is at least reasonably
level. In the Premier League, you
have to contend with the playthings
of oil sheikhs and bored billionaires,
clubs that can afford to buy the
world's elite players for extortionate
sums and then just sit them on the
bench.
The sports world will be looking
elsewhere this week, with the soccer
giants disputing the UEFA Champi
ons League semifinals today and to
morrow. When ranking the super
powers of world soccer, three of the
four remaining teams would surely
sit near the top. But if anyone can
ever truly claim to be the greatest
team, maybe and I know this is a
huge leap Reading in its current
guise should be able to throw its
name into the hat. Most famous
clubs have illustrious histories and
superstar players Reading really
has none of those but right here
and right now, it is what few organi
zations can call themselves: a team.
Its two remaining opponents for
automatic promotion have two play
ers each among the top-20 goal scor
ers in the division, while the Royals
have none. In fact, Reading only has
a single player who has broken into
double figures this season. It sold
perhaps its best attacking player in
the 2009-2010 season, Gylfi Sig
gurdsson, at the start of the next
year, and 12 months later, at the be
ginning of this season, it again sold
the previous season's star, Shane
Long. The apparent result of both
those sales was a significant dip in
form, but both times the team pulled
together, and both times it turned a
poor start into an impressive finish.
The key to this, something that
has been stated by the club itself) is
that players are not just signed ac
cording to raw talent. Character and
ability to fit in with the rest of the
squad are crucial.There are no divas.
And perhaps the best statistic of how
well a team plays together is not
goals scored, but goals conceded. By
that measure, Reading tops the
league. In 2012, it has even conceded
fewer goals per game than Premier
ship leader Manchester United, 0.68
compared to 0.81.
Fans of more prominent clubs
moan about insignificant little Read
ing potentially getting the chance to
play in the Premier League while
they remain stuck down in the
leagues below, but in their com
plaints I see grudging admiration.
Without the resources, money and
talent of the big guns, the Royals
have squeezed out every ounce of
potential, and for that deserve more
than anyone else to be in the situa
tion in which they currently are.
Fans across the country often
sing one particular song from the
stands, inserting their team's name
where required. If the Royals win
today, it might not be so much of an
exaggeration to hear this ring out

from the Madejski stadium: "And
it's Super Reading, Super Reading
FC. We're by far the greatest team
the world has ever seen."

Although inexperienced soccer
fans, Tom Taylor's editors now think
he's delusional. Give him necessary
