# Fabulous Finale
## CARD CLINCHES NO. 2 SEED IN MPSF TOURNAMENT 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
On a Senior Night that fea
tured the final regular season
match of 50-year UCLA head
coach A1 Scates and major seed
ing implications for the upcoming
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion (MPSF) tournament, drama
was the expectation on Saturday.
Instead, the only thing the season
high 1,730 fans attending the Stan
ford men's volleyball match re
ceived was an emphatic statement
as plain as the online play-by-play

account: the home team came to
play
The No. 5 Stanford men's vol
leyball team (20-6, 17-5 MPSF)
dominated the third-ranked
UCLA Bruins (22-7, 16-6) in
straight sets, 25-18,25-21,25-18, to
lay claim to the No. 2 seed in the
conference tournament and, in
the process, complete the team's
best conference record since the
national championship season of
1997.
"We felt extremely prepared
going into UCLA," said sopho
more middle blocker Eric

Mochalski. "We had a great game
plan and were confident in our
preparation."
Sophomore Brian Cook had
12 kills, eight blocks and five digs,
while senior Brad Lawson and
sophomore Steven Irvin each
added 11 kills for the Cardinal,
which hit .397 as a team and
never trailed later than 9-10 in
any set. Excellent serving and
passing helped Stanford avenge
its worst loss of the season, when
it was swept for the first and only
time this year at the hands of the
Bruins in Westwood back in Jan

uary.
"The difference between this
time and last time was our serving
and passing games," Cook said.
"When we are on, we get into a
rhythm that can be hard to stop.
This time, we got the advantage
early and were able to control
their middles, who are their pri
mary (offensive) weapons."
"All credit is due to the passers,
because they played a great
match," he added.
Senior setter Evan Barry
dished out 40 assists, improving
his national-best 12.02 assists-per
set average, while fellow senior
Erik Shoji added 11 digs. It was
the fourth-consecutive match
with double-digit digs for the
reigning MPSF Player of the
Week.
Stanford seized control of the
match early behind a brilliant of
fensive barrage that saw the Car
dinal hit .591 in the first set, featur
ing six kills by Lawson.
Although UCLA trailed for
most of the second set, Stanford's
lead was only 20-19 until Cook
registered three kills in a span of
four points to give Stanford some
breathing room and set the stage
for Irvin, who tallied consecutive
kills to close out the set at 25-21.
Stanford's magnificent offense
turned into brilliant defense in the
third, when the Cardinal rose up
for eight blocks, four of them by
senior Gus Ellis, en route to hold
ing the UCLA attack to a negative
hitting percentage for the set. Fit
tingly enough, the match would
end on a block as Mochalski and
Cook combined to stop UCLA's
Weston Dunlap to seal the victory.
"We felt like we were a step
ahead of them and knew what
they were going to do," said
Mochalski, who assisted on five of
Stanford's 14 blocks in the match.
As great as the Stanford per
formance was on Saturday, it
wouldn't have come as a surprise
to those who witnessed the team's
match Friday against UC-Santa
Barbara. The Cardinal dominated
the Gauchos (7-19, 5-17) from
start to finish, registering a 25-19,
25-14, 25-20 victory to set up the
clash with UCLA.
Stanford's hitters were again
beneficiaries of great passing, as
Barry tallied 45 assists in the three
sets in guiding the team to a .394
hitting percentage while Shoji
added 14 digs. That made life easy
for Lawson and Irvin, who com
bined for 30 kills on just 46 at
tempts.

The Stanford men's volleyball team put on a show Saturday night, using a perfectly balanced attack to sweep
No. 3 UCLA in front of a packed Maples Pavilion. The Card now prepares for the MPSF tournament.
