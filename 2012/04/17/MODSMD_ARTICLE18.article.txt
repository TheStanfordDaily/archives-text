# Mosbacher Minute
## Time for baseball to start having fun again 
### JACK MOSBACHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of
the Stanford baseball team from
2008-2011. Each week, he'll take a
look at the Cardinal's ups and
downs on its road to the College
World Series.
As I paced around Sunken Di
amond on Sunday, nervously
waiting to see if No. 5 Stanford
could hold on to a 4-2 lead and
avoid a sweep at the hands of the
visiting No. 10 Oregon, I heard a
profound statement uttered by a
nearby fan. Scanning the field,
wearing a Stanford cap and a
concerned expression, the fan

said, "These guys just don't look
like they're having any fun."
The comment reminded me of
a favorite scene from the iconic
sports movie "Remember the Ti
tans," when Coach Herman
Boone asks running back Petey
Jones if he enjoys playing foot
ball.
"Do you still think football is
fun, Petey?"
"Not anymore. Zero fun, sir."
Watching the Cardinal over
the past few weeks, it is blatantly
obvious that no fun of any kind is
being had by anyone. In the midst
of a devastating slump, Stanford
has lost six out of its past nine
games in Pac-12 play and fallen
to seventh place in a league that it

was unanimously picked to win.
This once-spirited team has, quite
literally, fallen flat.
It might sound childish, but I
believe it to be true: this Stanford
baseball team is underperform
ing because it stopped having
fun. Moreover, until this team
can remember that it's playing a
game that was invented for en
joyment, I doubt it will return to
playing at the high level we know
it can.
You don't have to be a bril
liant leader or a psychology
major to know that people inher
ently perform better when they
are having fun. Facebook em
ployees work amid foosball ta
bles and video game consoles;

large televisions broadcast every
March Madness game at Google.
Is Mark Zuckerberg just a fun
loving guy? Do Sergey Brin and
Larry Page just want everybody
to have a good time for good
time's sake?
Maybe so. The more likely
story is that these geniuses of en
trepreneurship and management
have realized and accepted a fun
damental truth: a happy employ
ee is a more productive employ
ee, and a team of happy, inspired
workers has a better chance of
achieving a company's goals.
Right now, the Stanford base
ball team isn't functioning like a
vibrant start-up. Instead, the ros
ter looks more like the disgrun
tled employees of a frustrated,
struggling venture, working away
quietly in their cubicles and slow
ly disconnecting from the group's
original mission and purpose.
There is no fun. There is no inspi
ration. Instead, it feels like these
guys are clocking in and out sim
ply because they refuse to bow out
and let their teammates down.
Like a business, Stanford base
ball has a mission every year: to
win as many games as possible
and compete for a national cham
pionship. In the end, it is the re
sponsibility of the coaching staff
to set the tone for the team they
oversee. Right now, there is just
no way to argue that Stanford
baseball's management is doing a
satisfactory job. Just look at the
faces of the players on the field.
They are not inspired. They are
not enjoying the task at hand.
They are simply not having any
fun. And their recent record
shows it.
This team's underperfor
mance is particularly shameful
because of how undeniably tal
ent-laden and experienced it is.
Five to seven years from now,
there is a legitimate chance that
half a dozen of these guys could
be playing every day in the ma
jors. If this team (and this coach
ing staff) can't turn the sinking
ship around, this could go down
as perhaps the most embarrassing
season in the past 30 years of
Stanford baseball. Simply put,
this team is too good to accept

anything other than success.
There is an easy solution to
this long-term malaise: someone
needs to make playing baseball
for Stanford fun again. If the
coaches won't do it, the players
have to take it upon themselves.
These guys need to remember
how fun it is to play this game
particularly, how fun it is to play
this game well. It is directly in the
interests of the coaches and play
ers to find away to start appreci
ating where they are and what
they are blessed to be doing. As a
team with a common goal, these
guys need to be reminded that
they are among the few adults
who are still playing games every
day and that games were cre
ated, first and foremost, for the
enjoyment of those playing them.
I, for one, know that I'll enjoy
watching these guys rediscover
their passion in time to make a
run to Omaha in July. They may
need to do it all by themselves,
but, somehow, they need to re
member how to have fun.

They are not
inspired. They are
not enjoying the
task at hand. They
are simply not
having any fun.
