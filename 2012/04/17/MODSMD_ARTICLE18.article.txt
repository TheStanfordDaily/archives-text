# Mosbacher Minute
## Time for baseball to start having fun again 
### JACK MOSBACHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of
the Stanford baseball team from
2008-2011. Each week, he'll take a
look at the Cardinal's ups and
downs on its road to the College
World Series.
As I paced around Sunken Di
amond on Sunday, nervously
waiting to see if No. 5 Stanford
could hold on to a 4-2 lead and
avoid a sweep at the hands of the
visiting No. 10 Oregon, I heard a
profound statement uttered by a
nearby fan. Scanning the field,
wearing a Stanford cap and a
concerned expression, the fan

said, "These guys just don't look
like they're having any fun."
The comment reminded me of
a favorite scene from the iconic
sports movie "Remember the Ti
tans," when Coach Herman
Boone asks running back Petey
Jones if he enjoys playing foot
ball.
"Do you still think football is
fun, Petey?"
"Not anymore. Zero fun, sir."
Watching the Cardinal over
the past few weeks, it is blatantly
obvious that no fun of any kind is
being had by anyone. In the midst
of a devastating slump, Stanford
has lost six out of its past nine
games in Pac-12 play and fallen
to seventh place in a league that it

was unanimously picked to win.
This once-spirited team has, quite
literally, fallen flat.
It might sound childish, but I
believe it to be true: this Stanford
baseball team is underperform
ing because it stopped having
fun. Moreover, until this team
can remember that it's playing a
game that was invented for en
joyment, I doubt it will return to
playing at the high level we know
it can.
You don't have to be a bril
liant leader or a psychology
major to know that people inher
ently perform better when they
are having fun. Facebook em
ployees work amid foosball ta
bles and video game consoles;

large televisions broadcast every
March Madness game at Google.
Is Mark Zuckerberg just a fun
loving guy? Do Sergey Brin and
Larry Page just want everybody
to have a good time for good
time's sake?
Maybe so. The more likely
story is that these geniuses of en
trepreneurship and management
have realized and accepted a fun
damental truth: a happy employ
ee is a more productive employ
ee, and a team of happy, inspired
workers has a better chance of
achieving a company's goals.
Right now, the Stanford base
ball team isn't functioning like a
