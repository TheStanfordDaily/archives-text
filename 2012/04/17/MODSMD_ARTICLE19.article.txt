# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Home win streak snapped by No. 1 UCLA 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
UCLA handed the Stanford
women's tennis team its first loss
of the season on Saturday, shat
tering the Cardinal's undefeated
season with a 5-2 victory. More
importantly, the match ended the
Cardinal's regular-season home
winning streak at 157, with the
last defeat on the Farm dating
back to Feb. 27,1999.
It was not all bad news for
Stanford, however, as the loss
came one day after the team
routed No. 4 USC (18-2,7-1 Pac
-12), 4-2. Despite falling to the No.
1 Bruins (21-1, 8-1), No. 6 Stan

ford (16-1,7-1) is viewing the loss
as a positive, something that will
help take the pressure off in its
quest to win a team title in May.
"It was very much needed for
all of us to play an incredible,
high-level team at this point in
the season and see where we
are," senior captain Veronica Li
said. "We did so well against USC
and came up short yesterday, but
I think it's good to point out that
there hasn't been a single season
where we've gone undefeated
and then won the national cham
pionship. This match gives us mo
tivation and shows that everyone
has to work harder."
It was only two years ago that

the Cardinal won the national
championship, and it was in that
same year that Stanford was
beaten 6-1 by the Bruins.
"A lot of us agree that this is
the best thing that could have
happened to us at this point in the
season," Li said.
The day started off on a bad
note for Stanford when it
dropped its first doubles point of
the year. Junior Stacey Tan and
freshman Ellen Tsay flew by
UCLA's Courtney Dolehide and
Pamela Montez in the No. 2 spot,
beating them 8-2. However, the
duo of junior Mallory Burdette
and sophomore Nicole Gibbs lost
to Robin Anderson and Skylar

Morton 8-6 on court one, and jun
ior Natalie Dillon and Li also
were defeated on court three.
Stanford needed to come out
strong in singles after losing the
doubles point, and it did so as
Burdette crushed UCLA's Mc-
Call Jones 6-1,6-1. After this vic
tory, however, the Cardinal lost
four matches, only picking up a
victory on court three. Gibbs,
Tsay, Li and Dillon all lost to
UCLA's four freshmen in the
lineup.
Li, who was swept by Chanelle
Van Nguyen, 6-1,6-3, commented
on the strength of UCLA's re
cruiting class.
"Their freshmen are definitely
playing really well," she said. "At
the same time, we're still only in
the regular season, and there's
less pressure. They don't have a
lot of experience playing college
tennis yet.They might have less of
an advantage going into the post
season and NCAAs."
Tan captured a 7-5,7-5 victory
over Montez, recording Stan
ford's second and final point of
the match.
On Saturday, Tan and Dillon
were the only two players to falter
in the matchup with USC. Dou
bles were not played because of a
threat of rain, but Stanford held
on to clinch four of the six singles
matches and grab the victory. On
court one, Gibbs played a close
first set against USC's Zoe Scan
dalis but ran away with the sec
ond, winning 7-6 (4), 6-2. Bur
dette, Tsay and Li also came out
with victories.
Looking ahead to this week
end, the Cardinal will be facing
Cal in a rematch of a meeting ear
lier this season in which Stanford
won 5-2. However, that match
didn't count for the conference
standings, which reveal no clear
top seed as of now.
"Even though we beat Cal last
time we played, that doesn't guar
antee a win again,"Tsay said. "Cal
beat UCLA, UCLA beat us, we
beat USC and USC beat Cal.That
just goes to show that it really de
pends on each team's perform
ance that day."
In preparation for their last
regular season match before Pac
12s and NCAAs, the Cardinal
looks to be more focused in prac
tice.
"Personally I want my prac
tice to have a more specific
focus," Tsay said. "I need to keep
my feet moving after every shot
and have targets in mind for each
ball that I'm going to hit. If what
I'm working on can come natural
ly then all I have to worry about is
staying mentally tough. As a
team, we're looking to add more
structure to this week's practices,
too."
Stanford takes on the Golden
Bears this Saturday at noon at the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
