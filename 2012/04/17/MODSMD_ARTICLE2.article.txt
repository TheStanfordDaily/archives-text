# OGWUMIKE GOES NO. 1
## STAR FORWARD TAKEN WITH TOP PICK IN WNBA DRAFT 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The LA Sparks selected senior
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike,
the face of Stanford women's bas
ketball, as the No. 1 pick in Mon
day's 2012 WNBA draft.
Ogwumike becomes the first
Cardinal player to be taken first
overall in school history and the
10th to be picked in the first
round. Five of those first round

picks are active WNBA players,
including three of her former
teammates: forward Jayne Appel
'lO (San Antonio Silver Stars),
forward Kayla Pedersen 'll
(Tulsa Shock) and guard Jeanette
Pohlen 'll (Indiana Fever). The
other two are guard Candice Wig
gins 'OB (Minnesota Lynx) and
forward Nicole Powell 'O4 (New
York Liberty).

WNBA President Laurel Richie posed with former Stanford forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike '12, who was drafted No. 1 overall by the Los
Angeles Sparks during the 2012 WNBA draft Monday.
Ogwumike had a stellar career
at Stanford, joining the exclusive
2,000-point and 1,000-rebound
club, but perhaps stands out most
for her senior season. Ogwumike
set the single-season scoring
record with 809 points and placed
second behind Wiggins on the ca
reer-scoring list with 2,491 points.
She also was named the Pac-12
Player of the Year, the second
time she won the conference's top
honor, and was selected to the
All-America teams of the WBCA
Coaches, Associated Press,
USBWA and John R. Wooden
Award. She also took home the
Lowe's Senior CLASS Award.
"I think I realized that, as the
competition and the challenges in
basketball in college got harder, I
needed to do more, and I had a lot
to learn from," Ogwumike said. "I
learned from Kayla, Jayne and
even Candice. I didn't get to play
with her, but every year my

coaches and my teammates have
really helped me make myself a
better player."
Barely a month after the dis
appointment of losing to Baylor
at the NCAA Final Four in Den
ver, Ogwumike may soon be back
in action, as the Sparks are due to
take on the Chinese and Japanese
national teams in preseason
games in early May before
launching the 2012 season on the
road against the Seattle Storm on
May 13.
With star forward Candace
Parker sidelined for much of the
season, the Sparks finished sec
ond to last in the Western Confer
ence last year and did not qualify
for the playoffs. Although head
coach Carol Ross will be starting
her first year at the helm, the
team, with two stars in Parker and
Ogwumike, will be expected to
perform.
"I know for one that coach
Carol Ross is an amazing coach,"
Ogwumike said of her new team.
"I've heard so many good things
about her. Obviously you have
Candace [Parker], Ebony Hoff
man and so many other people on

that team, and I just want to come
in and contribute. I'm not looking
to do too much; I'm just looking
to do me."
Back on the Farm, Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer
must now plan for a future with
out this season's star player. Og
wumike won four straight Pac-12
conference and tournament titles,
went to four straight NCAA Final
Fours, never lost at Maples Pavil
ion and dropped just a single
game to Pac-12 opponents, a con
test against Cal in January of
2009.
With the standard set by recent
Stanford classes, there will be
some big shoes to fill by returning
and incoming players. One of
those players, Nneka's younger
sister Chiney Ogwumike, will be
counted on to handle the scoring
and rebounding load after averag
ing 15.0 points and 11.2 boards in
her sophomore season. Fortu
nately for the Cardinal, Pac-12 op
ponents will still have to contend
with at least half of the sister act.

USBWA and John R. Wooden
Award. She also took home the
Lowe's Senior CLASS Award.
"I think I realized that, as the
competition and the challenges in
basketball in college got harder, I
needed to do more, and I had a lot
to learn from," Ogwumike said. "I
learned from Kayla, Jayne and
even Candice. I didn't get to play
with her, but every year my

coaches and my teammates have
really helped me make myself a
better player."
Barely a month after the dis
appointment of losing to Baylor
at the NCAA Final Four in Den
ver, Ogwumike may soon be back
in action, as the Sparks are due to
take on the Chinese and Japanese
national teams in preseason
games in early May before
launching the 2012 season on the
road against the Seattle Storm on
May 13.
With star forward Candace
Parker sidelined for much of the
season, the Sparks finished sec
ond to last in the Western Confer
ence last year and did not qualify
for the playoffs. Although head
coach Carol Ross will be starting
her first year at the helm, the
team, with two stars in Parker and
Ogwumike, will be expected to
perform.
"I know for one that coach
Carol Ross is an amazing coach,"
Ogwumike said of her new team.
"I've heard so many good things
about her. Obviously you have
Candace [Parker], Ebony Hoff
man and so many other people on

that team, and I just want to come
in and contribute. I'm not looking
to do too much; I'm just looking
to do me."
Back on the Farm, Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer
must now plan for a future with
out this season's star player. Og
wumike won four straight Pac-12
conference and tournament titles,
went to four straight NCAA Final
Fours, never lost at Maples Pavil
ion and dropped just a single
game to Pac-12 opponents, a con
test against Cal in January of
2009.
With the standard set by recent
Stanford classes, there will be
some big shoes to fill by returning
and incoming players. One of
those players, Nneka's younger
sister Chiney Ogwumike, will be
counted on to handle the scoring
and rebounding load after averag
ing 15.0 points and 11.2 boards in
her sophomore season. Fortu
nately for the Cardinal, Pac-12 op
ponents will still have to contend
with at least half of the sister act.
