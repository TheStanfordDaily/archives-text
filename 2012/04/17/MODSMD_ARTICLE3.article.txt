## Junior English major led mental health initiatives on campus 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford community lost
its second undergraduate in re
cent weeks when undergraduate
Cady Hine died April 1 at her
home in Palo Alto.
Hine was born in Whittier,
Calif., and grew up in Seal
Beach, Calif. She later lived in
San Francisco before beginning
her freshman year at Stanford in
the fall of 2005. After taking time
away from the University, Hine
returned to Stanford in winter
2012 as a junior majoring in Eng
lish.
Hine is survived by her fa
ther, Jim; stepmother, Martha;
and brother, Andrew.

Hine co-founded Stanford
Peace of Mind, a group whose
mission is to address mental
health issues on campus, reduce
the stigma surrounding mental ill
ness and connect students to men
tal health resources on campus.
"She was really honest about
the struggles she had been
through in life, both things she
had dealt with personally and
things she responded to," Koren
Bakkegard, associate dean in the
Office of Undergraduate Advis
ing and Research, said to The
Daily.
Hine was a frequent presence
in the grief group organized by
the Office for Religious Life,
Residential Education and
Counseling and Psychological

Services (CAPS) following her
mother's death by suicide in the
summer of 2006. She also volun
teered with Track Watch to pa
trol the Palo Alto railroad cross
ings after four local high school
students committed suicide.
"We came to know and ad
mire her as a brave and forthright
advocate for student wellness, lit
erally putting her body where her
mouth was," said Rabbi Patricia
Karlin-Neumann, senior associ
ate dean for Religious Life, in a
letter to the Stanford community
published in The Daily.
"I think we started a conversa
tion that there's still some rem
nants of with student wellness
work with Be Well at Stanford and
iThrive," Karlin-Neumann said.
Karlin-Neumann added that
she thinks the most significant
thing is to try to instigate another
conversation about student men
tal health on campus in the wake
of Hine's death and that of stu
dent-athlete Sam Wopat. Wopat
died at Stanford Hospital after
attempting suicide during the

last week of winter quarter this
year.

According to University ad
ministrators, Hine's father in
formed the University of his
daughter's death. Administrators
said they are not aware of Hine's
cause of death. According to the
Santa Clara County Medical Ex
aminer-Coroner's office, the pub
lic record of Hine's death, includ

ing cause, may not be released for
up to 10 weeks.
An online guestbook has been
created in Hine's memory at Lega
cy.com. Donations in Hine's name
can be made to Bridge Peer Coun
seling Center, 581 CapistranoWay,
Stanford, CA 94305.
