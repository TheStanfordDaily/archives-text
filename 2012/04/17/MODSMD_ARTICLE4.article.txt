## Required spring RA class begins Two- unit class is part of ResEd RA luring revisions 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
Starting in the 2012-13 aca
demic year, all new resident assis
tants (RAs) will be required to
take a class in order to be quali
fied to work for Residential Edu
cation (ResEd).
This spring, 185 students are
enrolled in an optional, pilot two
unit class, called Interpersonal
Learning and Leadership: An In
troduction to the RA Role.
The class is offered through
the School of Education and is
taught by professional ResEd
staff members, including resi
dence deans, program associates
and the area residential coordi
nator, according to LaCona Wolt
man, a resident fellow (RF) in
Freshman Sophomore College.
ResEd Assistant Director
Cisco Barron told the Stanford
Report that the department de
cided to implement the class to
make RAs feel more comfort

able in their leadership roles in
residences, not as a reflection of
something wrong with the exist
ing RA program.
ResEd has been evaluating
the RA training process for the
past five years, with research
largely led by Barron. Based on
the results of this assessment, the
department decided that RAs
would only benefit from a new
training program that seeks to
improve a functioning system.
In Res Ed's assessment, ac
cording to Barron, it became
clear that although RAs felt that
they were adequately trained to
handle crises, they were less cer
tain of their ability to lead in their
respective houses.
"The course material includes
a variety of articles and video
segments spanning topics such as
emotional intelligence, identity
development. . . conflict man
agement, [and] decision-making
skills," Woltmon wrote in an
email to The Daily.
Under the new program, RA
hiring will happen in winter quar
ter and students selected as RAs
will enroll in the class during

spring quarter.
RAs enrolled in the class will
participate in exercises to discuss
the materials learned in class and
participate in weekly journaling
to reflect on their learning.
Woltmon added that the class
will also give RAs the opportuni
ty to have a discussion with Deb
orah Golder, Dean of Res Ed.
Any aspiring RA who does
not pass the class will be ineligi
ble to work for ResEd during the
following school year.
Woltmon said that she has
even had requests from non-RAs
to enroll in the class, although she
added that this is not currently
possible.
The ASSU Community Ac
tion Board was also heavily in
volved in the revision of RA
training. Community Action
Board Chair Holly Fetter 'l3 de
scribed the group's goal as bridg
ing "the gap between residences
and identity-based communities
on campus."
Fetter said that initially she
was concerned about "how resi
dences can be unsafe spaces for
certain students."
"We were really impressed
with the work that LaCona and
her colleagues had done and are
very excited to see the positive
impact that this new class will
have on Stanford's residential

communities," Fetter wrote in an
email to The Daily.
However, the Community Ac
tion Board still sees room for im
provement.
"The Community Action
Board is currently creating a
guide to Stanford communities to
educate RAs about the richness
of resources for minority stu
dents," Fetter wrote.
