## Study shows HIV prevention drug cost effective for men at high risk 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Matt Bettonville 
Stanford researchers have determined
that a preventative medication for HIV
could be a cost-effective investment for
men at high risk of contracting the virus.
The drug under evaluation was teno
fovir-emtricitabine, which a 2010 study
found could reduce an individual's chances
of contracting the virus by between 44 and
73 percent, according to an article from the
Stanford School of Medicine.
The study, which focused on an econom
ic model for treating men who have sex with
other men, or MSM, found that a technique
called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP),
which entails medicating an entire popula
tion daily, could prove economically effi
cient. According to the U.S. Centers for Dis
ease Control and Prevention, MSM patients
comprise more than half of the new HIV in
fection in the United States each year.
The treatment, however, is still an expen
sive undertaking. Targeting only the high
risk in the MSM population, the treatment
would cost $B5 billion, according to the
study. Previous economic studies have even
returned conflicting results by making
fewer assumptions. The Stanford study, for
example, assumed that patients would stop
the medication after 20 years.
"Even though it provides good value, it is
still very expensive," said Jessie Juusola, pri
mary author of the study and Ph.D. candi
date in management science and engineer-
ing. "In the current health care cli
mate, PrEP's costs may become
prohibitive, especially given the
other competing priorities for
HIV resources, such as providing
treatment for infected individu
als."
Still, the study shows that even
at a 20 percent adoption rate
among high-risk individuals, the
PrEP treatment could prevent
41,000 HIV infections over 20
years.
