## Nanoparticle may advance surgery 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Nanotechnology may soon
help brain surgeons navigate to
the molecular level when treat
ing brain tumors.
Medical researcher and nan
otechnology professor Sam
Gambhir and his research team
have devised away to use gold
based particles to image cancer
cells in the brain. Although
years away from practical use in
humans, the research has the
potential to advance the abili
ties of brain surgeons, who cur
rently remove tumors while ob
serving with the naked eye.
The nanoparticle the team is
studying capitalizes on a
tumor's disruption of natural
blood flow in the brain to collect
around cancerous cells, en
abling imaging of the areas.
The imaging abilities devel
oped by Gambhir are threefold.
First, gold particles create a dis
tinctive magnetic resonance im
aging (MRI) signal that shows
the precise tumor location in the
brain. Second, a method called
photoacoustic imaging exploits
the sounds that gold emits when
exposed to certain frequencies
of light to create an image of the
tumor. Last, a method called
Raman spectroscopy employs a
technique borrowed from coun
terfeit detection that monitors

light emission spectra from the
particle.
"Although their origins are
in entirely different fields in
this case counterfeit detection
what we're doing is taking
these gold-core particles and
making them work in a biologi
cal system," Gambhir said.
These imaging methods
could eventually serve the pur
pose of allowing surgeons to see
tumors up close during surgery.
"Imagine that a surgeon
eventually would have on mo
lecular goggles, and those gog
gles let the surgeon see where
the tumor is at the molecular
level, thereby maximizing re
moval of just the tumor and
sparing most of the healthy tis
sue," Gambhir said.
The imaging could hold ben
efits both before and after sur
gery, as well. According to
Gambhir, molecular-level
awareness of cancer cells could
also streamline treatment
through more precise planning
and more accurate evaluation of
results.
Many obstacles still remain
before these ideas can become a
reality. The imaging has so far
only been tested on human can
cer cells growing in animals.
Gambhir said that before the
studies can move to a human
brain, researchers would have
to evaluate possible effects that

gold particles could have on a
person.
Gambhir noted that he is al
ready working with the Food
and Drug Administration to ap
prove testing in a human bowel.
He estimated that the first
human pilot of a nanoscale-im
aging procedure is around three
years away, and if that pilot is
successful, routine use could be
around five years away.
"Why should surgery be lim
ited to what the human eye

sees?" Gambhir asked. "What
you really should be seeing are
microscopic molecular events."
The study is significant not
only for its potential medical ap
plications, but also as collabora
tion between nanotechnology
engineering and medicine,
which are often disconnected
fields.
"Work like this inevitably in

Researchers have created gold-core particles that gather around
brain tumors (shown in red) and emit three different types of signals,
which may lead to precise, molecular-level imaging in the future.
so Stanford with its strength in
both engineering and medicine ...
allows for technologies like this to
appear and then eventually to be
translated into humans," Gambhir
said.

This engineering precision is
key in dealing with brain tumors
because surgery requires leaving

as many healthy cells behind as
possible.
"In this work, what we showed
was that by properly modifying
these gold-based particles, we're
able to create three kinds of imag
ing signals that home very nicely
and surprisingly to brain tumors
of multiple types in animals,"
Gambhir said. "They're very ef
fective at not getting into the nor
mal brain."
