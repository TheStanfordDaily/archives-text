## Fadi Quran returns to campus 
### AARON SEKHRI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fadi Quran 'lO returned to
campus Monday for the first time
since being arrested during a
protest in Israel. Quran, a rising
leader supporting non-violent
protest in the Israel-Palestine con
flict, spoke to students alongside
U.S. Civil Rights movement lawyer
Clarence Jones and international
conflict expert Allen Weine.
"We wanted to regain our
rights, our ability to move freely,
and to secure justice for ourselves
and for our people. We wanted to
use nonviolence to challenge the
balance of power and bring aware
ness of the injustice of our situa
tion," said Fadi Quran 'lO, noted
activist and self-proclaimed
"Palestinian Freedom Rider"
Monday night.
"So," he continued, "we got on a
bus."
Quran, who Time Magazine
hailed as "the face of the new Mid
dle East," spoke as part of a talk
held by Students for Palestinian
Equal Rights (SPER) titled, "Free
dom Rides in Palestine," which
brought together a diverse group of
individuals to speak about nonvio
lent activism and its role in bringing
a solution to the lingering Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.
Joining Quran were Jones, Mar
tin Luther King Jr.'s lawyer and
close confidant, and Weine, co-di
rector of the Stanford Center on
International Conflict and Negoti
ation.
The event took its name from an
act of nonviolent resistance orches
trated by Quran several weeks ago
that drew inspiration from the ac
tivism of the Freedom Riders of the

early 19605. Quran was arrested for
his resistance, leading to outcry for
his release.
The actions of the 1960s Free
dom Riders, who rode interstate
buses to the segregated South to
further the cause of desegregation,
were the impetus for Quran's own
activism and philosophy, which he
elaborated on during the discus
sion. Referring to "the burgeoning
Palestinian rights movement,"
Quran spoke of his "universal prin
ciples of justice," which he de
scribed as the foundation for his
nonviolent approach to activism.
Citing "large imbalances of
power" in the region, Quran elabo
rated on the various "matrices of
control" legal, infrastructural
and military which he argued
were imposed on the Palestinian
people by the Israeli government.
Recounting the sometimes hu
morous and sometimes tragic nar
rative of his experience illegally
taking a bus to Jerusalem, he
spelled out the aims of his nonvio
lent activism as "demonstrating to
the opposition that you are
human" and as "making the op
pression of the other side more
costly."
Quran promised that "more is
to come" and articulated his goals
as the pursuit of "freedom, justice
and dignity."
"The arc of the moral universe
is tending towards justice for the
Palestinians," Quran said, para
phrasing King.
Jones praised Quran, calling him
a "young hero" fighting for "legiti
mate universal aspirations." Jones
described the challenges to the
Palestinian liberation movement as
being "whether or not they can
awaken the conscience of the

world," showing "that peace is the
mutual interest of both parties."
Jones shared his experiences
from the Civil Rights movement
and said that with "discipline, dura
bility and unwavering morality,
one can challenge the impossible."
He praised Quran's use of tech
nology in broadcasting the events
of his detention to "shock the con
science of those watching" and
stated his confidence in the "su
premacy of nonviolence."
Weine provided a theoretical
underpinning to the talk, dis
cussing his work in the field of in
ternational conflict, and posited an
idea that for the movement to be
successful it must "incorporate and
engage Israeli voices."
Weine praised the activism as
"speaking to the Palestinian com
munity and giving agency and
power to young Palestinians." He
offered advice to Quran, his for
mer student at Stanford, using em
pirical research to assert that any
movement that brands itself as re
quiring "justice, and not engaging
the goodwill of the opponent" has
little chance of success. He con
cluded with the notion that any
peace would have to emerge from
arriving at a "mutually-bearable
future,"
The various perspectives of the
panel members resonated with the
audience.
"The historical allusion was in
credibly pertinent and useful be
cause the reference points of both
activities are the common values of
freedom, justice and dignity, values
that are understood and cherished
dearly by all," said Sahar Kahn 'l3.

Fadi Quran 'lO returned to
campus Monday for the first time
since being arrested during a
protest in Israel. Quran, a rising
leader supporting non-violent
protest in the Israel-Palestine con
flict, spoke to students alongside
U.S. Civil Rights movement lawyer
Clarence Jones and international
conflict expert Allen Weine.
"We wanted to regain our
rights, our ability to move freely,
and to secure justice for ourselves
and for our people. We wanted to
use nonviolence to challenge the
balance of power and bring aware
ness of the injustice of our situa
tion," said Fadi Quran 'lO, noted
activist and self-proclaimed
"Palestinian Freedom Rider"
Monday night.
"So," he continued, "we got on a
bus."
Quran, who Time Magazine
hailed as "the face of the new Mid
dle East," spoke as part of a talk
held by Students for Palestinian
Equal Rights (SPER) titled, "Free
dom Rides in Palestine," which
brought together a diverse group of
individuals to speak about nonvio
lent activism and its role in bringing
a solution to the lingering Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.
Joining Quran were Jones, Mar
tin Luther King Jr.'s lawyer and
close confidant, and Weine, co-di
rector of the Stanford Center on
International Conflict and Negoti
ation.
The event took its name from an
act of nonviolent resistance orches
trated by Quran several weeks ago
that drew inspiration from the ac
tivism of the Freedom Riders of the

early 19605. Quran was arrested for
his resistance, leading to outcry for
his release.
The actions of the 1960s Free
dom Riders, who rode interstate
buses to the segregated South to
further the cause of desegregation,
were the impetus for Quran's own
activism and philosophy, which he
elaborated on during the discus
sion. Referring to "the burgeoning
Palestinian rights movement,"
Quran spoke of his "universal prin
ciples of justice," which he de
scribed as the foundation for his
nonviolent approach to activism.
Citing "large imbalances of
power" in the region, Quran elabo
rated on the various "matrices of
control" legal, infrastructural
and military which he argued
were imposed on the Palestinian
people by the Israeli government.
Recounting the sometimes hu
morous and sometimes tragic nar
rative of his experience illegally
taking a bus to Jerusalem, he
spelled out the aims of his nonvio
lent activism as "demonstrating to
the opposition that you are
human" and as "making the op
pression of the other side more
costly."
Quran promised that "more is
to come" and articulated his goals
as the pursuit of "freedom, justice
and dignity."
"The arc of the moral universe
is tending towards justice for the
Palestinians," Quran said, para
phrasing King.
Jones praised Quran, calling him
a "young hero" fighting for "legiti
mate universal aspirations." Jones
described the challenges to the
Palestinian liberation movement as
being "whether or not they can
awaken the conscience of the

world," showing "that peace is the
mutual interest of both parties."
Jones shared his experiences
from the Civil Rights movement
and said that with "discipline, dura
bility and unwavering morality,
one can challenge the impossible."
He praised Quran's use of tech
nology in broadcasting the events
of his detention to "shock the con
science of those watching" and
stated his confidence in the "su
premacy of nonviolence."
Weine provided a theoretical
underpinning to the talk, dis
cussing his work in the field of in
ternational conflict, and posited an
idea that for the movement to be
successful it must "incorporate and
engage Israeli voices."
Weine praised the activism as
"speaking to the Palestinian com
munity and giving agency and
power to young Palestinians." He
offered advice to Quran, his for
mer student at Stanford, using em
pirical research to assert that any
movement that brands itself as re
quiring "justice, and not engaging
the goodwill of the opponent" has
little chance of success. He con
cluded with the notion that any
peace would have to emerge from
arriving at a "mutually-bearable
future,"
The various perspectives of the
panel members resonated with the
audience.
"The historical allusion was in
credibly pertinent and useful be
cause the reference points of both
activities are the common values of
freedom, justice and dignity, values
that are understood and cherished
dearly by all," said Sahar Kahn 'l3.
