In "The lure of Wall Street"
(April 10), The Daily incorrectly
cited Otis Re id 'l2 as an example
of a student choosing finance as a
career path. In fact, Reid will be
working for consulting firm McK
insey & Company following grad
uation. In addition, the selection
of one quote lacking context in
the article inaccurately portrayed
Reid's tone in his interview with a
Daily reporter. The Daily regrets
the error.
