Stanford Continuing Studies Presents
An Interdisciplinary Tour of the Human Condition
in Three Stages: Time, Life, and Mind
â€¢m
Over the years, artists, scientists, engineers, and humanities
scholars have explored the grand themes that define the human
condition from radically different perspectives. Too infrequently,
they are given the opportunity to listen to each other and engage
in conversations that cross boundaries and mix up categories.
In each of the three quarters of this academic year, we hosted
an evening program featuring some of the most exciting thinkers
in the Bay Area, inviting them to talk together about one or
another modest slice of the human experience. We will conclude
this Spring with "Mind," featuring panel speakers James McClelland,
Deborah Aschheim, Christopher Chafe, Jaron Lanier, and
Piero Scaruffi (moderator).
