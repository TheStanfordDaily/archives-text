# RAVALATIONS
## Things the Draw has taught me 
### Ravali Reddy 
Spring is upon us, and that
means great weather and the
infamous Housing Draw.
Yes, that's right. In the midst of liv
ing it up, we all have to take a few
moments to pause and think
about next year and figure out
where exactly we (literally) see
ourselves in the fall.
As the freshmen around me
start freaking out and trying to
plan out their living situations, I
can't help but be reminded of my
own interesting experience with
the Draw last year. As contrived
as it may sound, the Draw brings
out the best and the worst in peo
ple, and going through it once has
left me much more composed this
time around. So for those of you
who have never gone through the
Draw before, here's what my ex
periences have taught me:

1. Do not be afraid to tell some
one you don't want to draw with
them.

This is a big one. Oftentimes,
the Draw can be difficult because
of a lot of the assumptions made.
Your current roommate might be
under the impression that you two
are going to be living together next
year, while your best friend might
have already started making col
lages to decorate the future room
she thinks you're going to be shar
ing. Don't lead your potential
roommates on. If you don't want to
live with them, then just tell them
that. Sure, the news may sting at
first, particularly if it's a close
friend, but if they truly are your
friends, they'll get over it. Some
times, living with your best friend
isn't the best idea anyway. If you
think sharing close quarters could
end up jeopardizing your friend
ship, then better safe than sorry. A
few weeks of awkwardness now
are a small price to pay once you
realize that the alternative is nine
months of unhappiness next year.

2. Be prepared to not get the hous
ing that you want to get.
When I was a freshman, I want
ed to live in Toyon. If you're cur
rently a freshman, chances are, you
want to live in Toyon. Just about
everyone wants to live in Toyon,
but Toyon can only house 158
sophomores. Considering that the

Class of 2015 has 1,709 students in
it, this means that the majority of
you won't get to live in Toyon.
Guess what? That's okay. There's
really no such thing as bad hous
ing, so when you get your housing
assignment, don't overreact if it
isn't the place you're looking for.
3. Know the person you're draw
ing with.
I know it sounds obvious, but
you'd be surprised by how often
people don't really know their fu
ture roomies. Dorm rooms are
tiny, and sharing that tiny space
with someone else means that bad
habits tend to rear their ugly
heads. So make sure you know
your drawmates. You don't have
to be best friends with them, but
your relationship should probably
be deeper than the ever-popular
"Oh my gosh, I totally love her!"
and "She's great!" statements. For
all you know, that "great" room
mate of yours could have an an
noying partying or snoring habit
that will drive you crazy next year.
4. There's no harm in having a
large draw group.
Your draw group can be as
small as just you, or as large as
eight. I drew with eight people
with last year, even though some
people warned me against it.
What it came down to for me was
that I had a great group of friends,
and I couldn't just pick and
choose whom I wanted to live
with, so I decided to live with all of
them. There's no guarantee that

you'll get into your dorm of choice
whether you're by yourself or
with friends. I didn't end up where
I wanted to this year, but I do
come home to my seven best
friends everyday.
And finally ...

5. Remember that campus isn't as
monstrously large as you think it is.
I can attest to this. I currently
live in Sterling Quad and don't
have a bike. This means I walk
everywhere, to class, to the Row, to
Tresidder and even all the way
over to the stadium. Now, before
you gasp in horror, allow me to let
you in on a little secret: it doesn't
take more than 15 to 20 minutes
to walk just about anywhere on
this campus. My friends tend to
leave for class five minutes before
it starts; I leave 10 minutes before.
So even if you get stuck on the op
posite side of campus from your
friends, calm down, take a deep
breath and remind yourself that
you're still within the boundaries
of the Stanford bubble.
So don't worry; submit your
housing forms, and may the odds
be ever in your favor.

are going to be living together next
year, while your best friend might
have already started making col
lages to decorate the future room
she thinks you're going to be shar
ing. Don't lead your potential
roommates on. If you don't want to
live with them, then just tell them
that. Sure, the news may sting at
first, particularly if it's a close
friend, but if they truly are your
friends, they'll get over it. Some
times, living with your best friend
isn't the best idea anyway. If you
think sharing close quarters could
end up jeopardizing your friend
ship, then better safe than sorry. A
few weeks of awkwardness now
are a small price to pay once you
realize that the alternative is nine
months of unhappiness next year.

2. Be prepared to not get the hous
ing that you want to get.
When I was a freshman, I want
ed to live in Toyon. If you're cur
rently a freshman, chances are, you
want to live in Toyon. Just about
everyone wants to live in Toyon,
but Toyon can only house 158
sophomores. Considering that the

Class of 2015 has 1,709 students in
it, this means that the majority of
you won't get to live in Toyon.
Guess what? That's okay. There's
really no such thing as bad hous
ing, so when you get your housing
assignment, don't overreact if it
isn't the place you're looking for.
3. Know the person you're draw
ing with.
I know it sounds obvious, but
you'd be surprised by how often
people don't really know their fu
ture roomies. Dorm rooms are
tiny, and sharing that tiny space
with someone else means that bad
habits tend to rear their ugly
heads. So make sure you know
your drawmates. You don't have
to be best friends with them, but
your relationship should probably
be deeper than the ever-popular
"Oh my gosh, I totally love her!"
and "She's great!" statements. For
all you know, that "great" room
mate of yours could have an an
noying partying or snoring habit
that will drive you crazy next year.
4. There's no harm in having a
large draw group.
Your draw group can be as
small as just you, or as large as
eight. I drew with eight people
with last year, even though some
people warned me against it.
What it came down to for me was
that I had a great group of friends,
and I couldn't just pick and
choose whom I wanted to live
with, so I decided to live with all of
them. There's no guarantee that

you'll get into your dorm of choice
whether you're by yourself or
with friends. I didn't end up where
I wanted to this year, but I do
come home to my seven best
friends everyday.
And finally ...

5. Remember that campus isn't as
monstrously large as you think it is.
I can attest to this. I currently
live in Sterling Quad and don't
have a bike. This means I walk
everywhere, to class, to the Row, to
Tresidder and even all the way
over to the stadium. Now, before
you gasp in horror, allow me to let
you in on a little secret: it doesn't
take more than 15 to 20 minutes
to walk just about anywhere on
this campus. My friends tend to
leave for class five minutes before
it starts; I leave 10 minutes before.
So even if you get stuck on the op
posite side of campus from your
friends, calm down, take a deep
breath and remind yourself that
you're still within the boundaries
of the Stanford bubble.
So don't worry; submit your
housing forms, and may the odds
be ever in your favor.

Spring is upon us, and that
means great weather and the
infamous Housing Draw.
Yes, that's right. In the midst of liv
ing it up, we all have to take a few
moments to pause and think
about next year and figure out
where exactly we (literally) see
ourselves in the fall.
As the freshmen around me
start freaking out and trying to
plan out their living situations, I
can't help but be reminded of my
own interesting experience with
the Draw last year. As contrived
as it may sound, the Draw brings
out the best and the worst in peo
ple, and going through it once has
left me much more composed this
time around. So for those of you
who have never gone through the
Draw before, here's what my ex
periences have taught me:

1. Do not be afraid to tell some
one you don't want to draw with
them.

This is a big one. Oftentimes,
the Draw can be difficult because
of a lot of the assumptions made.
Your current roommate might be
under the impression that you two
are going to be living together next
year, while your best friend might
have already started making col
lages to decorate the future room
she thinks you're going to be shar
ing. Don't lead your potential
roommates on. If you don't want to
live with them, then just tell them
that. Sure, the news may sting at
first, particularly if it's a close
friend, but if they truly are your
friends, they'll get over it. Some

isn't the best idea anyway. If you
think sharing close quarters could
end up jeopardizing your friend
ship, then better safe than sorry. A

are a small price to pay once you
