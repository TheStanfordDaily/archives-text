# BURSTING THE BUBBLE
## Two things we learned from the ASSU election 
### Edward Ngai 
It is often said that we learn
most about ourselves in times
of difficulty. By all accounts,
last week's raucous ASSU cam
paign was, at least for some, a very
difficult time.
So now that it's all over, what
can we newcomers say we learned
about the school we love?
First, we saw that Stanford stu
dents hold their public discourse
to a far higher standard than that
to which they hold their discourse
in public.
Many have pointed out that
the amount and severity of per
sonal attacks levied over the
course of the campaign has
shocked and dismayed them. And
though I will not hesitate to say
that the harsh (yet almost laugh
able) allegations made through
anonymous emails and comments
were better off locked away, I re
main unsure why we are so sur
prised they were articulated.
The ASSU president and vice
president, for better or for worse,
are the faces of the school. Their

names are probably the most rec
ognizable on campus (thanks,
creepy emails and text mes
sages!), and everything they do
will obviously be scrutinized.
Sure, it's bush league to circulate
an unsigned email calling our
public figures mentally unfit. But
I'm of the camp that believes that
it's how Senator Palpatine said it,
not what he said, that puts him in
the wrong.
Each and every point made by
Senator Palpatine, including the
personal attacks, we have made in
person. In dining halls, we laugh
off "SMD is crazy," but over
email, we trip over ourselves to
suspend people for violating the
Fundamental Standard.
I'm not trying to defend the

cowardly Senator Palpatine, who
should have signed his name at
the bottom of his attack. What he
did was cruel and wrong. I'm sim
ply pointing out the gulf between
what we expect of our public dis
course and our far cruder stan
dard while discoursing in public.
If I wrote, and The Daily pub
lished, Senator Palpatine's exact
words in this column, I doubt I
would be disciplined for a viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard. It's an opinion crude,
rude, uncalled for, yes. But judging
from the gossip strewn through
out dining halls this week, it's
hardly off-limits. So why is the
opinion now an affront to one of
the University's most cherished
values?
Senator Palpatine's email was
n't an opinion page, you may
argue. It was an anonymous at
tack. True, but so are the com
ments on many articles that you
are reading in these pages. Allega
tions of mental instability are
commonplace in the faceless,

nameless cyber-world. I, too, have
been called insane, misguided and
selfish. Why aren't we tracing
those comments and emails, in
vestigating them in their great dis
honor along with the attacks in
SMD-gate?
Of course, it is absolutely right
that we should call for these per
sonal attacks on character to stop.
But if we have laughed along with
or are tacitly complicit in these
Fundamental Standard-violating
critiques, it would certainly be the
height of hypocrisy to be feigning
outrage now that the proverbial
poop has hit the propeller.
Second, what has become
abundantly clear is that we don't
really care anymore.
Yeah, some two-thirds of
freshmen voted this year, but we
did so because we wanted to sup
port our friends and dormmates,
not because we actually thought
we were making a difference. Be
tween having your brunch inter
rupted and having strangers walk
into your room to fill dead space
with long promises and platitude
filled monologues, we tuned you
all out weeks before we cast our
ballots.
"If one more senator asks me
for a minute," I overheard last

week, "I'm jumping out the [ex
pletive] window."
It is a harsh indictment when I
say that most of us are unsatisfied
with our representatives in the
Senate. It is an even harsher in
dictment that not a single sitting
senator was satisfied enough with
the job to commit to returning.
And so with a collection of
fresh faces, the new Executive and
Senate should be out to prove that
the confusion, opacity and utter
irrelevance that have character
ized the only ASSU the freshman
class knows is merely an anomaly.
Indeed, before implementing
your platforms of valuing "com
munities," catalyzing "reform,"
celebrating "diversity," promoting
"the arts" and increasing "well
ness" among other stuff we still
don't understand, you should first
do everything in your power to
win back respect for the organiza
tion you have been granted the
privilege to lead.
That, beyond anything you can
promise us, should be a task tall
enough to last you well into your
term.

dard while discoursing in public.
If I wrote, and The Daily pub
lished, Senator Palpatine's exact
words in this column, I doubt I
would be disciplined for a viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard. It's an opinion crude,
rude, uncalled for, yes. But judging
from the gossip strewn through
out dining halls this week, it's
hardly off-limits. So why is the
opinion now an affront to one of
the University's most cherished
values?
Senator Palpatine's email was
n't an opinion page, you may
argue. It was an anonymous at
tack. True, but so are the com
ments on many articles that you
are reading in these pages. Allega
tions of mental instability are
commonplace in the faceless,

nameless cyber-world. I, too, have
been called insane, misguided and
selfish. Why aren't we tracing
those comments and emails, in
vestigating them in their great dis
honor along with the attacks in
SMD-gate?
Of course, it is absolutely right
that we should call for these per
sonal attacks on character to stop.
But if we have laughed along with
or are tacitly complicit in these
Fundamental Standard-violating
critiques, it would certainly be the
height of hypocrisy to be feigning
outrage now that the proverbial
poop has hit the propeller.
Second, what has become
abundantly clear is that we don't
really care anymore.
Yeah, some two-thirds of
freshmen voted this year, but we
did so because we wanted to sup
port our friends and dormmates,
not because we actually thought
we were making a difference. Be
tween having your brunch inter
rupted and having strangers walk
into your room to fill dead space
with long promises and platitude
filled monologues, we tuned you
all out weeks before we cast our
ballots.
"If one more senator asks me
for a minute," I overheard last

week, "I'm jumping out the [ex
pletive] window."
It is a harsh indictment when I
say that most of us are unsatisfied
with our representatives in the
Senate. It is an even harsher in
dictment that not a single sitting
senator was satisfied enough with
the job to commit to returning.
And so with a collection of
fresh faces, the new Executive and
Senate should be out to prove that
the confusion, opacity and utter
irrelevance that have character
ized the only ASSU the freshman
class knows is merely an anomaly.
Indeed, before implementing
your platforms of valuing "com
munities," catalyzing "reform,"
celebrating "diversity," promoting
"the arts" and increasing "well
ness" among other stuff we still
don't understand, you should first
do everything in your power to
win back respect for the organiza
tion you have been granted the
privilege to lead.
That, beyond anything you can
promise us, should be a task tall
enough to last you well into your
term.

It is often said that we learn
most about ourselves in times
of difficulty. By all accounts,
last week's raucous ASSU cam
paign was, at least for some, a very
difficult time.
So now that it's all over, what
can we newcomers say we learned
about the school we love?
First, we saw that Stanford stu
dents hold their public discourse
to a far higher standard than that
to which they hold their discourse
in public.
Many have pointed out that
the amount and severity of per
sonal attacks levied over the
course of the campaign has
shocked and dismayed them. And
though I will not hesitate to say
that the harsh (yet almost laugh
able) allegations made through
anonymous emails and comments
were better off locked away, I re
main unsure why we are so sur
prised they were articulated.
The ASSU president and vice
president, for better or for worse,
are the faces of the school. Their

names are probably the most rec
ognizable on campus (thanks,
creepy emails and text mes
sages!), and everything they do
will obviously be scrutinized.
Sure, it's bush league to circulate
an unsigned email calling our
public figures mentally unfit. But
I'm of the camp that believes that
it's how Senator Palpatine said it,
not what he said, that puts him in
the wrong.
Each and every point made by
Senator Palpatine, including the
personal attacks, we have made in
person. In dining halls, we laugh
off "SMD is crazy," but over
email, we trip over ourselves to
suspend people for violating the
Fundamental Standard.
I'm not trying to defend the

cowardly Senator Palpatine, who
should have signed his name at
the bottom of his attack. What he
did was cruel and wrong. I'm sim
ply pointing out the gulf between
what we expect of our public dis
course and our far cruder stan
dard while discoursing in public.
