## Tibetan activist's wife visits campus Filmmaker imprisoned for controversial interviews 
### ILEAN A NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
Lhamo Tso, the wife of an im
prisoned Tibetan filmmaker,
stopped by Stanford Tuesday
night as part of a three-week tour
of California, seeking to raise
awareness of her husband,
Dhondup Wangchen, who is cur
rently being held in China.
Stanford Friends for Tibet, in
collaboration with the Bay Area
based Committee of 100 (C 100)
for Tibet, hosted Tso, who spoke
to a small group of students, facul
ty and other guests at El Centra
Chicano. The event including a
screening of her husband's docu
mentary, "Leaving Fear Behind."
"The film is about the plight of
the Tibetan people," Wangchen
said in the documentary.
Wangchen collected over 108
interviews with Tibetans, who
commented on the 2008 Beijing
Olympic Games, the depletion of
grazing land for nomads, the
struggle for preservation of Ti
betan culture and the lack of reli
gious freedom due to the absence
of the Dalai Lama from Tibet.
When Chinese officials received
word of Wangchen's documentary,

he was arrested and sentenced to
prison for six years without a fair
trial, according to Tso. She said his
crime was the filming of interviews
that portrayed negative opinions of
how China treats Tibet.
Wangchen remains imprisoned
today and currently suffers from
liver problems without access to
medical attention, Tso said.
Jigme Yugay, secretary for
ClOO's Board of Directors, said
that he was excited for the oppor
tunity to hearTso spread the word
about Wangchen and Tibet to the
Stanford community.
"I hope the audience will be
able to understand a little bit more
about the situation in Tibet,"
Yugay said. "I think the film will
speak for itself."
Shortly after the screening of
the film, Tso spoke with the help
of a translator about how she has
personally taken on the mission to
speak about the injustice facing
Tibet and the censorship many Ti
betans face.
"On behalf of the people of
Tibet who are in Tibet and cannot
speak of this, I try to say as much
as I can here," Tso said.
Tenzin Tethong, chairman and
executive director of ClOO, said
that while Stanford Friends for
Tibet has hosted multiple other
events this past year, this one stood
out for its unique opportunity to

introduce the Stanford communi
ty to a living representative of the
struggles faced by Tibet today.
"Most of the events at Stanford
are often lectures by scholars, and
it's all quite academic or very gen
eral, but today we have somebody
who represents what is happening
in Tibet today," Tethong said.
"It's about a real person who is
trying to survive without her hus
band, with children in India, and at
the same time trying to find away
to get relief for her husband and
other prisoners," he added.
The event concluded with a
short question-and-answer ses
sion and a call to action for mem
bers of the audience to sign a peti
tion on Amnesty International's
website for the release of
Wangchen.
Former president of Stanford
Friends for Tibet and the first Ti
betan American to win a Rhodes
scholarship, Tenzin Seldon 'l2,
also a member of The Daily's
Board of Directors, said that she
hopes to screen a film she made
with Tso to highlight the issue of
censorship in Tibet.
Seldon said the film is "small in
scale but large in its message" and
hopes it will further promote con
versation of the Tibetan cause.
