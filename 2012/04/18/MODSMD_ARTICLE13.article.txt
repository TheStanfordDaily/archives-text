## NO WAY, JOSE CARD UPSET BY UNDERDOG SPARTANS 
### PALANI ESWARAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After dropping two of three in
last weekend's series against No. 8
Oregon, the No. 14 Stanford base
ball team lost again to San Jose
State (18-14,2-0 WAC) on Tuesday
by a score of 3-2. The Cardinal (22-
10,5-7 Pac-12) has now lost three
of its last four games and is strug
gling to score runs in its last four
contests, the Cardinal has crossed
home plate just eight times.
The game started off well for
the Card. Through the first three
innings, freshman starter John
Hochstatter gave up just one hit
a bloop single that went past the
outstretched arms of junior short
stop Kenny Diekroeger and barely
reached the outfield grass. But im
mediately after that hit, San Jose
State's Tyler Christian hit a
grounder into a 5-4-3 double play.
The bottom of the third contin
ued to go in the Cardinal's favor.
Sophomore second baseman Brett
Michael Doran started the rally
with a double off the left-field wall,
and the next batter, freshman Alex
Blandino, launched a home run
into the trees over the left-field
fence.
"I was just looking to react,"
Blandino said. "I got a fastball up
and in, turned on it and put good
wood on it."
Blandino, who has been playing
extremely well of late, has seen his
playing time increase in recent
matchups.
"It's been a lot of hard work ...
coming out and working every
day," Blandino said. "The goal of
any player is to get in the lineup.
It's really about taking advantage
of every opportunity you get."
After the promising start,
things went south for the Card. In
