## NO WAY, JOSE CARD UPSET BY UNDERDOG SPARTANS 
### PALANI ESWARAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After dropping two of three in
last weekend's series against No. 8
Oregon, the No. 14 Stanford base
ball team lost again to San Jose
State (18-14,2-0 WAC) on Tuesday
by a score of 3-2. The Cardinal (22-
10,5-7 Pac-12) has now lost three
of its last four games and is strug
gling to score runs in its last four
contests, the Cardinal has crossed
home plate just eight times.
The game started off well for
the Card. Through the first three
innings, freshman starter John
Hochstatter gave up just one hit
a bloop single that went past the
outstretched arms of junior short
stop Kenny Diekroeger and barely
reached the outfield grass. But im
mediately after that hit, San Jose
State's Tyler Christian hit a
grounder into a 5-4-3 double play.
The bottom of the third contin
ued to go in the Cardinal's favor.
Sophomore second baseman Brett
Michael Doran started the rally
with a double off the left-field wall,
and the next batter, freshman Alex
Blandino, launched a home run
into the trees over the left-field
fence.
"I was just looking to react,"
Blandino said. "I got a fastball up
and in, turned on it and put good
wood on it."
Blandino, who has been playing
extremely well of late, has seen his
playing time increase in recent
matchups.
"It's been a lot of hard work ...
coming out and working every
day," Blandino said. "The goal of
any player is to get in the lineup.
It's really about taking advantage
of every opportunity you get."
After the promising start,
things went south for the Card. In
the top of the fifth, Hochstatter al

lowed two hard hits that put San
Jose State base runners on second
and third with no outs. Junior
Dean McArdle came in to relieve
Hochstatter, and the first batter he
faced hit a fly ball to deep right
field. Sophomore rightfielder
Austin Wilson recorded the out
and sent a strong throw to home
plate in an attempt to get the dou
ble play. But the runner was called
safe on a questionable call by the
home-plate umpire.
The next batter, Kyle Gallegos,
was attempting to lay down a bunt
but was instead hit by a pitch. With
runners on first and third, the
Spartans' Tyler Christian hit a
grounder through a gap into shal
low left field, tying up the game.
McArdle escaped the inning with
out giving up any more damage.
But in the top of the sixth,
McArdle was hit with a hard line
drive by San Jose State rightfield
er Nick Schulz. McArdle grabbed
his arm and immediately ran to the
dugout. Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess said that he did
not know the severity of the injury

but did state that he did not be
lieve McArdle was hit on the
elbow.
After pitching a spectacular
one-two-three seventh inning, the
Card's redshirt sophomore reliev
er Garrett Hughes looked com
pletely on his game, throwing a
solid fastball and confusing batters
with a nasty changeup. But in the
eighth inning Hughes threw eight
straight balls, putting two men on
base with no outs. Later in the in
ning, Michael Gerlach drove in a
run with an RBI single, putting
San Jose State up 3-2.
In the bottom of the eighth and
ninth innings, San Jose State pitch
er Zack Jones was almost unhit
table. He was throwing heat and
his breaking balls were painting
the corners.
The Cardinal offense managed
just five hits against the Spartans,
whose pitching was excellent Tues
day evening.
"All their guys did a good job
tonight," Marquess said. "They
only gave up a couple of walks.
Their batters came up with a cou
ple of clutch hits."
Stanford's bats have been quiet
for a while, which makes this
weekend's series against Arizona
State that much tougher. If the
Cardinal hopes to break out of its
Pac-12 struggles, it will have to find
away to awaken its bats against
potent pitching.
"Their pitching is really good
one of the best pitching staffs in
the conference," Marquess said.
Stanford will host Arizona
State at Sunken Diamond for a
weekend series. Friday's game will
be at 5:30 p.m., with Saturday's
and Sunday's at 1 p.m.

After dropping two of three in
last weekend's series against No. 8
Oregon, the No. 14 Stanford base
ball team lost again to San Jose
State (18-14,2-0 WAC) on Tuesday
by a score of 3-2. The Cardinal (22-
10,5-7 Pac-12) has now lost three
of its last four games and is strug
gling to score runs in its last four
contests, the Cardinal has crossed
home plate just eight times.
The game started off well for
the Card. Through the first three
innings, freshman starter John
Hochstatter gave up just one hit
a bloop single that went past the
outstretched arms of junior short
stop Kenny Diekroeger and barely
reached the outfield grass. But im
mediately after that hit, San Jose
State's Tyler Christian hit a
grounder into a 5-4-3 double play.
The bottom of the third contin
ued to go in the Cardinal's favor.
Sophomore second baseman Brett
Michael Doran started the rally
with a double off the left-field wall,
and the next batter, freshman Alex
Blandino, launched a home run
into the trees over the left-field
fence.
"I was just looking to react,"
Blandino said. "I got a fastball up
and in, turned on it and put good
wood on it."
Blandino, who has been playing
extremely well of late, has seen his
playing time increase in recent
matchups.
"It's been a lot of hard work ...
coming out and working every
day," Blandino said. "The goal of
any player is to get in the lineup.
It's really about taking advantage
of every opportunity you get."
After the promising start,
things went south for the Card. In
the top of the fifth, Hochstatter al

lowed two hard hits that put San
Jose State base runners on second
and third with no outs. Junior
Dean McArdle came in to relieve
Hochstatter, and the first batter he
faced hit a fly ball to deep right
field. Sophomore rightfielder
Austin Wilson recorded the out
and sent a strong throw to home
plate in an attempt to get the dou
ble play. But the runner was called
safe on a questionable call by the
home-plate umpire.
The next batter, Kyle Gallegos,
was attempting to lay down a bunt
but was instead hit by a pitch. With
runners on first and third, the
Spartans' Tyler Christian hit a
grounder through a gap into shal
low left field, tying up the game.
