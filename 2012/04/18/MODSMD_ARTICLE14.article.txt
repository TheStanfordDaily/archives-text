# Scrambletes deserve some respect
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
I've been playing an egre
gious amount of Scramble
with Friends lately. The Bog
gle-like iPhone app has con
sumed an inordinate
amount of my time, even though,
when compared to my friends, I'm
just really not that good.
Still, nearly every conversation
now directs itself back to our recent
games, times we failed to notice
that sexy "-ing" just waiting to be
prefixed and confusion regarding
the inclusion of some of our fa
vorite derogatory colloquialisms
(as well as the exclusion of others).
In fact, we've all recently discov
ered that when we can't get to
sleep, we figure out all of the possi
ble words that can be formed from
a single stem.
Please save us. This is disturbing.
I'm confident that a few of my
close Scramble buddies could put
up a legitimately good fight against
anyone out there. They have
played enough anagram games
that the reorganization of specific
letter combinations has become
second nature. These same friends
are also masters of Sudoku,
Ken Ken and a slew of other intel
lectually stimulating games.
But are they athletes?
To give you a bit of background,
I have always been reluctant to lib
erally hand out the athlete card.
I'm from the heart of NASCAR
country, an area that draws more
than 200,000 spectators twice a
year to watch cars race around an
oval, and I promised myself I
would never consider it a sport.
The same went for activities like
bowling, fishing and poker. All fun,
sure, but they just didn't fit the bill.
Why? Conventional wisdom
suggests that a sport must be phys
ically demanding and require at
least some athleticism, which is so
cially acknowledged as physical
performance. Bowling a
strike, catching bass and winning
poker tournaments can be mental
ly exhausting, but you could also
have never run a mile in your life
time and excel relative to the gen
eral population.
The problem is, this definition
of sport and athleticism the
only one that I have really ever

known isn't really accurate.
Merriam-Webster defines an ath
lete as "a person who is trained or
skilled in exercises, sports or games
requiring physical strength, agility
or stamina." Play a game of chess
with a skilled opponent or grind
out a 10-hour poker session before
you tell me that those are games
that don't require stamina.
This column is not intended to
take away from the traditional ath
lete. The time spent perfecting
physical ability is impressive in and
of itself, let alone witnessing the
finished product in action. But
after having my friends put the fear
of God in me, a guy who is about to
make a living using his words, I
have a newfound respect for the
undervalued athletes who spend
countless hours crafting and main
taining a specific skill set, be it the
ability to record a nine-dart finish
in a pub or to memorize and em
ploy every two-letter word in the
Scrabble dictionary.
More so, there is a distinct con
nection between mental and phys
ical performance. Regular aero
bic exercise has been shown to im
prove cognitive skills and dramati
cally slow down age-induced dete
rioration. Ask any new exerciser
how his or her mental clarity has
changed, and the answer will be re
markable. Suffice it to say, a
healthy athlete is more well
rounded than you may think.
The common denominator in
competitors ranging from basket
ball players to crossword enthusi
asts is endurance. With the seeming
inability to escape distraction in our
daily lives, people able to withstand
obstacles and persevere through
mental and physical training should
be commended. I, for one, get irri
tated and discouraged when I acci
dentally omit an obvious six-letter
word or blow a fast-break layup in
an intramural game. Sometimes I
take full advantage of these mis
takes and turn them into valuable
lessons for the future. Sometimes I
don't. I'm not an elite athlete.
Those who can find the will to
constantly improve are athletes in
their own right. They'll never earn
the same recognition as their pro
totypical peers, but they deserve
equal respect. Sports mean differ
ent things to different people and
shouldn't be bound by a false and
misleading definition.
Does this mean I'd rather watch
the Monopoly World Champi
onships than the NBA Finals?
Never. But what I will do in the fu
ture is slow my roll when passing
judgment on athletic prowess.
Add me on Scramble with
Friends. Let's be athletes together.
