## Split keeps Card's tourney hopes alive 
### SARAH MAISEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team found itself in a familiar situ
ation against San Diego State on
Sunday afternoon. After blowing
a four-goal lead in the first half, the
Cardinal (4-9, 2-2 MPSF) trailed
the Aztecs 11-8 with 15 minutes
remaining. But unlike many of its
previous come-from-behind at
tempts, the Card successfully
pulled off the rally to handily de
feat San Diego State 17-11. The
win was a welcome jolt of momen
tum after a disappointing 13-7 loss
to Oregon just two days prior.
Senior Catherine Swanson
began the scoring early, finding the
net less than 40 seconds into the
game. Stanford held a comfortable
lead at the game's 10-minute
mark, but San Diego State fought
back to score four unanswered
goals and take a 7-6 lead at the pe
riod's end.
Freshmen Hannah Farr and
Emily Newstrom both scored to
tie the game at 8-8, but the Aztecs
answered again to make it 11-8.
Stanford's offense roared back in
the final 15 minutes, led by sopho
more Anna Kim, Newstrom and
senior Emilie Boeri, ensuring that
the Cardinal would avoid an upset
by a San Diego State program in
its first year of existence.
The Cardinal dominated the
second period and outshot the
Aztecs 18-6. The team also played
a much cleaner game, committing
five fewer fouls and six fewer
turnovers than San Diego State.
Kim, in just her second game back
after being sidelined with an in
jury since Feb. 25, led the offense

with eight goals in the game, in
cluding four in the final 15 min
utes.
On Friday, however, the Cardi
nal could not give Oregon its first
conference loss, and the Ducks re
mained tied with Denver for the
No. 1 seed in the MPSF standings.
Stanford once again outshot its

opponent, but it could not find the
back of the net. Kim scored twice
and provided one assist in her first
game back since the injury, but it
was not enough to overcome the
strength of an Oregon team with
just three losses on the season.
Sunday's win pushed the Car
dinal up to No. 4 in the conference
standings, leaving it little room for
error in the remainder of its
games. Only the top four teams in
the conference qualify for the
MPSF tournament, and Stanford

In this sport
you can't think
too much
about the
future.

has not lost the championship in
seven seasons. If the Card can
maintain the momentum from its
latest win, it is not impossible to
think that it can extend the streak
to eight. The offensive strength of
the freshmen, who combined for
10 of 17 goals on Sunday, as well as

the return of Kim, have greatly
improved the team's chances of
postseason success.
While the season has certainly
been disappointing, it is still not
over. The Cardinal has the chance
to finish the season 7-9 if it wins its
final three conference games.
However, as it heads into its last
regular-season games, the players
are trying not to think too far
ahead.
"I think what the team is most
looking forward to down the line

is just trying to win our next
game," said sophomore goalkeep
er Lyndsey Munoz. "In this sport
you can't think too much about
the future, even though it is an ex
citing one. Obviously the ultimate
goal is the NCAA championship,
but there is a lot of lacrosse to be
played until then."
Next up, the Cardinal travels to
play at UC-Davis tonight at 7 p.m.
