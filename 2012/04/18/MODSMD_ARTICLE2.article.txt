# Coursera launches humanities courses
## Online start-up expands to Princeton, UPenn and University of Michigan 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Coursera, a start-up founded by Stanford
computer science professors Daphne Koller
and Andrew Ng, officially launched today, an
nouncing new partnerships with Princeton
University, the University of Pennsylvania

and the University of Michigan, in addition to
its existing partnership with Stanford.
While online education start-ups like
Coursera have recently been on the rise, most
university-level "Massive Online Open
Courses" have been in the fields of computer
science and engineering. Coursera's new
course offerings, however, include classes in

Greek and Roman mythology, world music,
science fiction and history.
"I was looking at the list of courses and
saying, 'Oh my, I want to take this course and
this course,'" Roller said.
The challenge of offering humanities
classes to hundreds of thousands of students
is that the auto-grading techniques common

ly used for engineering and computer science
do not transfer over easily as methods for as
sessment in the humanities.
"Multiple choice doesn't really work for a
poetry class," Ng noted.
In addition, with so many students, it
would not be feasible for any pro
fessor, even with teaching assis
tants, to grade such a massive vol
ume of homework assignments, Ng
added.
To handle this problem, Cours
era has created a system for peer
grading, in which students will be
trained to evaluate each other's
work based on a grading rubric
provided by the professor. Once
the system verifies that the stu
dents understand the professor's
grading criteria, they will be asked
to grade each other's submissions.
While this may sound dubious
to students who are accustomed to
being graded by their professors, or
at least qualified teaching assis
tants (TAs), Ng said he has pub
lished a paper showing that aver
aging the results of multiple
graders actually provides more ac
curate grading than individual
Ph.D. students.
"We hope that the grading will
be comparable to the average TA,"
Koller said.
Coursera also announced Tues
day that it has raised $l6 million in
venture capital funding from
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers
and New Enterprise Associates. Ng
said that the funding has enabled
them to focus on building the edu
cation platforms, and that for now,
the company is not concerned with

turning a profit.
"For now, we are focusing on
giving the students a great re
source," Ng said.
"Stanford gives an amazing ed
ucation, but I hope Stanford's
reach will become much bigger," he
added. "I see a future where Stan
ford educates millions of students."
Koller also emphasized that the
start-up is committed to keeping its
courses free.
"There is a huge problem in
lack of access," Koller said. "There
are people who cannot access a
Stanford-quality education. Even if
you charge what we called a token
amount, they wouldn't be able to
afford the class. We feel strongly
committed to make the classes ac
cessible to everyone, and we think
it's possible to do it while still mak
ing this a sustainable venture."
Currently, both Koller and Ng
have taken part-time leave from
Stanford to run Coursera. They
said they are unsure about their fu
ture plans and whether they will be
able to return to full-time teaching
soon.
Koller said she is fueled by her
belief that online education will not
be a short-lived trend.
"This is not a fringe phenome
non," she said. "I think the world of
higher education is going to change
in ways that we can't predict. Tech
nology is going to change educa
tion in profound ways, whether or
not we like it."
