## China growth spurred by incentives Researcher presents findings on informal compensation for government employees 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER DESK EDITOR 
"How did China achieve rapid growth under
highly interventionist local states with notoriously
predatory bureaucracies?" asked Yuen Yuen Ang,
an assistant professor of political science from the
University of Michigan, of an audience at Encina
Hall Tuesday afternoon. Ang, who received her
Ph.D. at Stanford, presented her findings at a re
search seminar held as part of The Governance
Project, sponsored by Stanford's Center on Democ
racy, Development, and the Rule of Law
(CDDRL).
Francis Fukuyama, senior fellow at the Freeman
Spogli Institute, launched the new governance se
ries in January 2012 to engage scholars around the
world in evaluating the quality of governance in
state institutions. Fukuyama introduced keynote
speaker Ang and joined her in a discussion about
how local bureaucracies in China and California
have reacted to revenue centralization.
"China created an incentive system for local
governments to make up the shortfall, while Cali
fornia did not," Fukuyama said, presenting a di
chotomy between the two.
Reo Matsuzaki, a postdoctoral fellow at the
CDDRL and project manager of The Governance
Project, stated that "Ang's innovative research on
Chinese bureaucracy challenges Western conven
tions on the foundation of bureaucratic efficiency."
To "dismiss [the Chinese method of incentive
pay] as corruption is to fundamentally misunder
stand their way of governance," Ang said.
China, whose government bureaucracies in
clude approximately 50 million members, faced a
recentralization of tax revenues in 1994, which
caused local governments' share
of tax revenues to plummet dra
matically, according to Ang.
In an attempt to maintain sus
tainable living wages for their em
ployees, as well as to meet high
growth rates demanded by the
central Chinese state, many local
governments implemented a tri
partite wage structure. Ang pre
sented slides showing that local
bureaucrats receive only 24 per
cent of their earnings through
their official wages.
The remaining 76 percent of
their compensation includes
health benefits, bonuses, subsidies,
welfare fees, housing subsidies,
scholarships, transportation, con
ferences, training and vehicles,
among other perquisites.
Ang described some of these
perks as "free vacations."
"This system is distortionary,
but it has its benefits at this stage of
rapid growth," she added.
According to Ang, this infor
mal compensation serves as an in
centive for local bureaucrats to
promote economic growth, as well
as to help improve the self-financ
ing of local government opera
tions. She said in the Jiangsu
Province, this self-financing re
sulted in the county tax authority
being able to own large buildings
and have its "own property
rights."
Ang characterized these incen
tive compensation programs for
bureaucrats in China as essentially
businesslike profit sharing, despite
the fact that central China "is
Leninist and authoritarian."
Ang, whose field research cov
ered the southern, northern and
western provinces of China, ana
lyzed 20 sectors of the Chinese
government and interviewed over
250 local bureaucrats.
She demonstrated how China
is very different from the "Weber

ian" model of bureaucratic effi
ciency, which promotes "a fixed
salary paid in money." Ang found
that the practices and institutions
in China today are "shockingly
similar to those from the Qing Dy
nasty."
When asked by an audience
member whether these Chinese
methods could be "exportable" to
places like India, Ang expressed
doubt, stating that in China the
"party and bureaucracy are
fused."
"[Chinese bureaucrats] don't
report to the public, so you can't
really apply this to India," she said.
"When [Chinese] central govern
ment makes an order, it mush
rooms and sprouts throughout the
whole country."
Ang noted throughout the
presentation that corruption by in
dividuals is not a large problem in
China because government enti
ties keep close track of any monies
collected, "to prevent leakage of
funds." Ang said that as a result,
"individual corruption is risky."
"In China, everyone is involved
in growing the economy, even a
women's group will have an eco
nomic target," Ang said. She re
peatedly likened China to a "firm"
since compensation is often linked
to economic performance.
In China, "tax revenues are
seen as a proxy for growth," Ang
said.
According to Fukuyama, Chi
nese county officials have decided
that the priority is to "first cut
taxes, so there will be growth in the
long term."
The final issue discussed by the
group was how the current Chi
nese model, successful during pe
riods of rapid economic growth
and capital accumulation, might
change to incorporate new socie
tal goals such as protecting the en
vironment, promoting equality
and building more schools. How
ever, Ang said it is too early to
form a hypothesis on this issue.
