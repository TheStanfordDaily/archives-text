## China growth spurred by incentives Researcher presents findings on informal compensation for government employees

"How did China achieve rapid growth under
highly interventionist local states with notoriously
predatory bureaucracies?" asked Yuen Yuen Ang,
an assistant professor of political science from the
University of Michigan, of an audience at Encina

Ph.D. at Stanford, presented her findings at a re
search seminar held as part of The Governance
Project, sponsored by Stanford's Center on Democ
racy, Development, and the Rule of Law
(CDDRL).
Francis Fukuyama, senior fellow at the Freeman
Spogli Institute, launched the new governance se

speaker Ang and joined her in a discussion about
how local bureaucracies in China and California
have reacted to revenue centralization.
"China created an incentive system for local
governments to make up the shortfall, while Cali
fornia did not," Fukuyama said, presenting a di
chotomy between the two.
Reo Matsuzaki, a postdoctoral fellow at the
CDDRL and project manager of The Governance
Project, stated that "Ang's innovative research on
Chinese bureaucracy challenges Western conven
tions on the foundation of bureaucratic efficiency."
To "dismiss [the Chinese method of incentive
pay] as corruption is to fundamentally misunder
stand their way of governance," Ang said.

recentralization of tax revenues in 1994, which
