## Storytelling key to success, film executive says 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
Film executive and bestselling author Peter
Guber called storytelling the "one-size-fits-all" se
cret to success Tuesday night during a talk at
CEMEX Auditorium. According to Guber, "The
ability that you have to tell a purposeful story to
move someone to action" is the shared quality
among "all great leaders."
"Story, narrative, gives meaning to everything," he
added. "It emotionalizes all the facts ... [and] we are
emotional creatures first."
Focusing more on delivery than on content,
Guber described the five key elements of story
telling, what he called "Motivating your Audience to
your Goal with Interactive Content," or M.A.G.I.C.
for short.
Guber, currently CEO of Mandalay Entertain
ment, has produced five films that have been nomi
nated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, in
cluding "The Color Purple," "Midnight Express" and
"The Kids Are All Right." He is also the author of a
New York Times bestselling book entitled "Tell to
Win." In addition, Guber is an
owner of both the Los Angeles
Dodgers and the Golden State
Warriors and taught at UCLA for
over 30 years.
Co-sponsored by The Stanford
Storytelling Project, Stanford Con
tinuing Studies and Stephanie and
Fred Harman 'B2 M.S. 'B3, the
event was part of a speaker series
themed "Telling the Truth."
Guber's message aligned with the
mission of The Stanford Story
telling Project: "giv[ing] students
the opportunity to experience the
transformative nature of great sto
ries and better understand how
they work."

Guber also spoke about story
telling in relation to the ever
changing world of technology. He
emphasized the presence of story
telling throughout history, well be
fore the emergence of the Internet.
"Nobody is moved by o's and
l's," he said, reiterating the impor
tance of interactivity and personal
content over digital data. He added
that while technology aggregates
the audience and makes the distri
bution of knowledge more effi
cient and democratic, it amplifies
rather than eliminates the impact
of storytelling as a tool.
Following his speech, Guber
answered questions from the audi
ence centered more on his person
al journey to success. He spoke
about the Dodgers and Warriors,
about the rapidly shifting cinemat
ic market and about the impor
tance of curiosity as an internal
motivation. Guber encouraged
young people in the audience to
recognize the necessity of continu
ous learning and the inevitability of
failure.
When asked, Guber said that
the scariest moment in his life was
opening an envelope that notified
him that he had been drafted for
the Vietnam War. Although he was
ultimately not required to serve
because his brother was already
serving, he recalled feeling tremen
dously afraid during his military
physical.
"Everything has a piece of luck
in it," he said of his success.
While he told stories of famous
ly resilient and successful figures,
including Nelson Mandela,
Muhammad Ali and Michael Jack
son, Guber stressed that every per
son can tell purposeful stories.
"You were born with it it's in
your DNA," Guber said. "[Hu
mans] developed a technology,
called language, so that we could
work together to outsmart our
predators."
He also emphasized the impor
tance of storytelling as a tool for
philanthropic pursuits and con
structing personal legacy.
"Doing good and making a dif
ference in the world will be the
story you tell others and write oth
ers," he said. "You have to person
alize it."
