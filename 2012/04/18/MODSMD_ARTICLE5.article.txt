## SPEAKERS & EVENTS Profs debate viability of eurozone Economics professor calls for pan-European central tax authoriy 
### AARON SEKHRI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Economics Professor Michael Bordo
argued in support of establishing a pan-
European central tax authority Tuesday
afternoon, stating that "the unique exper
iment" of the eurozone should be paired
with a fiscal union if it wants to survive the
test of time.
At an interdisciplinary panel co-spon
sored by the Europe Center and the
Hoover Institute, Bordo warned that for
many members of the European Union
(EU), especially Greece, "the continued
forces of the backlash against austerity, so
cial unease and negative growth could
mean an exit of those countries from the
eurozone."
The panelists, including experts in eco
nomics, political science and law, shared
their thoughts on the viability of the EU's
Economic and Monetary Union and dis

cussed what should have been done in re
sponse to the European sovereign debt
crisis that has crippled the region.
"Behind all of this is the need for deep,
serious political union where countries
will have to relinquish some sovereignty,"
Bordo said.
Ronald McKinnon, professor of inter
national economics, labeled the early de
bates that surrounded the establishment
of the euro as completely missing the true
threat to its longevity, which he said is
"debt default." McKinnon said that law
makers presented "purely monetary ar
guments, leaving out the key problem."
"There were no central fiscal regimes
set in place to deal with sovereign debt
crises," McKinnon said. He added that
this problem is exacerbated when "a
country does not own its own central
bank."
According to McKinnon, countries
whose debt was not as creditworthy as the
more economically sound members of the
monetary union were able to "dramatical
ly increase spending and grow the size of
the welfare state" because of their mem

bership in the eurozone.
University President Emeritus Ger
hard Casper discussed the problem in
more political terms, critiquing the many
layers of bureaucracy that preclude any
tighter political union between nations. As
away of questioning the lack of central
leadership in Europe, Casper invoked the
words of former secretary of state Henry
Kissinger by asking, "Who do I call when I
want to call Europe?"
Casper presented the "dizzying" num
ber of groups that command political
weight in Europe and discussed the most
recent attempt to solve the euro crisis
the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and
Governance in the Economic and Mone
tary Union a document whose imme
diate effect he argued will be "more meet
ings."
The treaty would require member
countries to secure debt levels at below 60
percent of gross domestic product (GDP)
and include balanced budget provisions in
their constitutions.
Casper outlined the numerous obsta
cles to this plan, which he said mainly
hinges on the differences in economic
conditions in constituent members of the
eurozone and the ability of Brussels, the
EU's de facto capital, "to administer the
rest of continental Europe."
Casper ended on the note that "the so
lutions to this crisis will mainly involve
muddling through."
Christophe Crombez, visiting profes
sor at the Stanford Europe Center, argued
that "whenever it has been faced with a
crisis, Europe has eventually done the
right thing."
Panelists went into greater detail about
the various established and yet-to-be es
tablished mechanisms to keep the euro
crisis from getting worse. The audience,
consisting mostly of faculty, was receptive
to the talk.
"I thought it was fascinating, and it was
great to hear so many points of view," said
John Hochstatter 'l5 of the talk.
