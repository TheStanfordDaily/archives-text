## A 						home away from home 
### STEPHANIEWANG 
In preparation for this past Easter, the
Ronald McDonald House at Stanford
decorated its front office with yellow
ducks and colored eggs. The children's
books and stacks of parenting
brochures in the front office reinforced the
youth-oriented atmosphere, offering a hint at
the house's residents.
Located across the street from the Stan
ford Shopping Center, the Ronald McDon
ald House at Stanford provides food and
housing for young patients at the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital and their fami
lies, most of whom live over fifty miles away.
The Stanford house, the fifth Ronald Mc-
Donald House in the country, opened its
doors in May 1979.
"Local McDonald's owner/operators
found that the children's hospital at Stanford
was one of the growing markets for chil
dren's health and felt that this would be a
good location," said Linda Lyon, the devel
opment director of the Ronald McDonald
House at Stanford. "At the time, the chil
dren's hospital was right next door."
The house is an independent nonprofit
501(c)(3) organization that leases its land
from Stanford for one dollar per year.
"A little less than 10 percent of our profit
comes from the families who stay with us,
some medical insurance companies or Cali
fornia Children's Services," Lyon said. "They
pay our requested amount of $lO per night."
According to Lyon, the remaining 90 per
cent of funding comes from the support of
the community. Of that, about 6 percent
comes from local McDonald's owners and
operators, while 84 percent comes from cor
porations, foundations and donors.
The average length of stay at the house
has grown over the years from a few days to
24. The longest continuous stay was over two
and a half years, according to Lyon. The
house is especially important for families of
patients undergoing lengthy treatments such
as organ transplants.
"The child will need to be here pre-oper
atively when they're on the transplant list,
keeping up their health while they're wait
ing," Lyon said. "Then the child is in the hos
pital for the transplant and immediately
after, and then the child comes back for re
covery and daily check-ups until the doctor
says they can go home. Even though we
might have a five-month visit, the child might
only be in the hospital for a week."
In addition to food and boarding, the

house offers arts and crafts, activities and
other recreational events for the patients and
their siblings. Stanford athletic teams often
come and help organize tournaments with the
children, while other Stanford-affiliated vol
unteers come in four to six nights a week to
cook dinner for the families. The house is
staffed by 150 volunteers, saving the house
$300,000 in labor costs each year.
Xianne Penny 'l2 Ph.D. 'l2 P.D., a post
doctoral fellow of pathology, spearheaded a
crane chandelier project that was completed
in November of 2009. The chandelier con
sists of 6,873 paper cranes and is currently
hung in the Great Hall, the main lounge of
the house.
"We did it because it was inspired by a
Dale Chihuly glass-blown chandelier at the
Mayo Clinic [in Rochester, Minn.]," Penny
said. "His inspiration was for people who en
tered the clinic to look up and, for a moment,
forget their pain and suffering. That's what
we wanted to do with the paper crane chan
delier."
Penny's volunteering experiences at the
house did not start out on such a positive
note. She first volunteered at the house on a
weekly basis, helping with their Make a
Book Day, a program in which children at
the house made a book out of various arts

and crafts supplies.
"The patients themselves find it hard to
put colored cotton balls together on a page
when they are in wheelchairs," she said. "It's
frustrating for them to make something cre
ative and not be able to do it to the best of
their ability because they are sick."
The program did not last long, and atten
dance dwindled. However, Penny soon start
ed participating in activities like the Big Sur
Marathon, which raises money for the house.
The marathon was to be a more successful
foray into volunteerism.
"I did [the Big Sur Marathon] for three
years in a row," she said. "This past year I got
married the same day as the run."
In fact, Penny had become so used to run
ning the marathon that she wanted to run on
the morning of her own wedding and get to
the church on time for the afternoon cere
mony, though she ultimately took the year
off from participating,
Penny emphasized that the house gives
her the opportunity to interact with patients
and their families and witness their hope.
"There was a boy who had been waiting
for a heart transplant for two and a half
years," Penny said. "Every time I saw him his
face was bluer. Sometime while we were
hanging the paper chandelier he got a call

from the hospital saying there's a heart."
The volunteer work that Penny and oth
ers contribute to the organization provide
necessary services for parents like Kim Fur
nish, a former resident of the house, who
stayed there for four months while her 17-
month-old daughter was being treated at the
hospital.
"The doctors wanted us 15 minutes from
the hospital," Furnish said. "We panicked,
not knowing what to do. Some of the hotels
in the area are $3OO a night, and we were
looking for a long-term stay."
The Ronald McDonald House fulfills a
larger purpose than just providing a physical
place for families of patients to stay â€”it
serves as a home away from home, with the
volunteer community, the accommodating
staff and the other parents themselves all act
ing as a support network.
"Our friends at home don't get what
being a parent of a critically ill child is all
about, but the parents staying at the Ronald
McDonald House get it," Furnish said. "The
families that you meet there and the support
from other parents are overwhelming. It's a
real magical place."
