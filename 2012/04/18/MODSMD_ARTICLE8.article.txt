# Q&A
## Gabbing with Grammar Girl 
### â€“ Willa Brock 
Mignon Fogarty, the voice
behind the popular
"Grammar Girl" podcast
and the author of "Gram
mar Girl's Quick and Dirty
Tips for Better Writing," spoke Tuesday at
an event sponsored by the Program in
Writing and Rhetoric. Fogarty received
her master's in biology at Stanford
where she also wrote for The Daily and
had a career as a science writer before
shifting her focus to syntax. Her podcasts
seek to illuminate often-misunderstood
grammar rules in five minutes or less, lay
ing them out simply and clearly. The
Daily's Head Copy Editor Willa Brock 'l4
sat down with Fogarty to chat about pet

peeves, punctuation and proper English.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): I send out
"Copy Tip of the Week" emails to The
Daily editors, and I'm always terrified that
I'll make an embarrassing mistake. You
wrote a book about grammar were you
ever scared that you would have typos or
grammar mistakes and people would be
mean about it?
Mignon Fogarty (MF): Not so much when
I was writing my books, because there are
lots of rounds of editing, although errors
have slipped through. But I do a weekly
email newsletter... and there are typos
that go out probably once every couple
months. We get angry emails: "Shame on

you!" People shaking their metaphorical
fingers at us.
TSD: Do you have a biggest grammar pet
peeve?
MF: I'm not a big peever, but when mar
keting people want to capitalize words
that don't need to be capitalized, that
probably bothers me more than anything.
There's just no reason to capitalize, you
know, "taco" in the middle of a sentence ..
. It's just a taco capitalizing it doesn't
make it better.
TSD: Do you ever correct people in real
life?
MF: No, never. I think it's rude.
TSD: Do you have a favorite punctuation
mark?
MF: I love the interrobang, which is a
heretical punctuation mark created by an
advertising man in the 19705. You're not
supposed to end a sentence with a ques
tion mark and an explanation point.
You're supposed to pick one, but some
times you have a sentence that needs both:
"He went to the store." "Whaaaat?! He
wasn't supposed to!" It needs them both.
And so there is this punctuation mark it
looks like a question mark and an excla
mation point superimposed.
TSD: Do you ever use it?
MF: Sometimes I'll use it when I tweet!
TSD: You were an English major as an un
dergraduate and then received a master's
in biology at Stanford ... You're both a
techie and a fuzzy!
MF: After graduate school, I worked as a
technical writer for a few years. It worked
really well because there aren't a lot of
people who can understand the science
deeply and also write really well, so I had
plenty of work. It was great.
TSD: So how did "Grammar Girl" come
about? What was the inspiration?
MF: It was my hobby, actually. I was doing
the technical writing and technical editing,
and I just saw scientists making the same
mistakes over and over again ... But it
wasn't my job to teach them. They weren't
interested in getting lessons ... I was al
ready podcasting I was doing a science
podcast and I was looking for some
thing else to do, and I thought, "Oh, I'll just
do little, five-minute grammar tips," just as
a hobby, and it took off like crazy.

TSD: And how long have you been doing
it for?
MF: Almost six years.

TSD: How do you keep coming up with
new things to talk about?
MF: Well, my goal now has been to do two
reruns a month, but I've actually only been
getting to about one rerun a month be
cause there are so many interesting things
still to talk about. It surprises me that there
are still topics to cover, but there are ...
We talked this week about what it means
for something to be "proper" English
the better term is really "standard" Eng
lish. So we're getting into a little bit more
philosophical questions, but they're fasci
nating and relevant to everyday writing.
TSD: On the subject of philosophy, do you
have a specific approach to grammar?
Why do you think it's important to write
correctly?
MF: It's important to write correctly be
cause people do judge you based on how
you write, especially now that we aren't
meeting people face to face nearly as much
as we used to. I've hired people without
ever meeting them, based on email ex
changes and their blog and things like that,
so how you present yourself in writing is a
really important part of your professional
persona.
TSD: Is there a story behind your "quick
and dirty" tagline?
MF: Yes, actually there is! Occasionally we
get complaints from schools, saying, "We
can't send our students to something that
has 'dirty' in the title." And early on, people
joked that I was educating one errant porn
seeker at a time, but actually, it's a more
common phrase in Seattle, where I grew up.
My mom used to use it "quick and dirty"
just means sort of fast and easy ... You
know, she'd say, "Let's do a quick and dirty
job on these dishes tonight." When I start
ed, I wanted the podcast to be short, quick
tips. Nobody wants a half an hour grammar
lesson; they want it in five minutes.
TSD: But now college students with dirty
minds get all excited ...
MF: I know, I know! I still get comments
on my Facebook page like, "What's dirty
about this? I don't get it!"
TSD: Are you going to be worried or angry
if there are any mistakes in this article
when we publish it?
MF: No, but you should be! There have
been people who have written about me,
and there have been grammar errors in the
article, and they get lots of angry mail. So
be careful, for your own sake. But I won't
be mad.

Mignon Fogarty, the voice
behind the popular
"Grammar Girl" podcast
and the author of "Gram
mar Girl's Quick and Dirty
Tips for Better Writing," spoke Tuesday at
an event sponsored by the Program in
Writing and Rhetoric. Fogarty received
her master's in biology at Stanford
where she also wrote for The Daily and
had a career as a science writer before
shifting her focus to syntax. Her podcasts
seek to illuminate often-misunderstood
grammar rules in five minutes or less, lay
ing them out simply and clearly. The
Daily's Head Copy Editor Willa Brock 'l4
sat down with Fogarty to chat about pet

peeves, punctuation and proper English.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): I send out
"Copy Tip of the Week" emails to The
Daily editors, and I'm always terrified that
I'll make an embarrassing mistake. You
wrote a book about grammar were you
ever scared that you would have typos or
grammar mistakes and people would be
mean about it?
Mignon Fogarty (MF): Not so much when
I was writing my books, because there are
lots of rounds of editing, although errors
have slipped through. But I do a weekly
email newsletter... and there are typos
that go out probably once every couple
months. We get angry emails: "Shame on

you!" People shaking their metaphorical
fingers at us.
TSD: Do you have a biggest grammar pet
peeve?
MF: I'm not a big peever, but when mar
keting people want to capitalize words
that don't need to be capitalized, that
probably bothers me more than anything.
There's just no reason to capitalize, you
know, "taco" in the middle of a sentence ..
. It's just a taco capitalizing it doesn't
make it better.
TSD: Do you ever correct people in real
life?
MF: No, never. I think it's rude.
TSD: Do you have a favorite punctuation
mark?
MF: I love the interrobang, which is a
heretical punctuation mark created by an
advertising man in the 19705. You're not
supposed to end a sentence with a ques
tion mark and an explanation point.
You're supposed to pick one, but some
times you have a sentence that needs both:
"He went to the store." "Whaaaat?! He
wasn't supposed to!" It needs them both.
And so there is this punctuation mark it
looks like a question mark and an excla
mation point superimposed.
TSD: Do you ever use it?
MF: Sometimes I'll use it when I tweet!
TSD: You were an English major as an un
dergraduate and then received a master's
in biology at Stanford ... You're both a
techie and a fuzzy!
MF: After graduate school, I worked as a
technical writer for a few years. It worked
really well because there aren't a lot of
people who can understand the science
deeply and also write really well, so I had
plenty of work. It was great.
TSD: So how did "Grammar Girl" come
about? What was the inspiration?
MF: It was my hobby, actually. I was doing
the technical writing and technical editing,
and I just saw scientists making the same
mistakes over and over again ... But it
wasn't my job to teach them. They weren't
interested in getting lessons ... I was al
ready podcasting I was doing a science
podcast and I was looking for some
thing else to do, and I thought, "Oh, I'll just
do little, five-minute grammar tips," just as
a hobby, and it took off like crazy.

TSD: And how long have you been doing
it for?
MF: Almost six years.

TSD: How do you keep coming up with
new things to talk about?
MF: Well, my goal now has been to do two
reruns a month, but I've actually only been
getting to about one rerun a month be
cause there are so many interesting things
still to talk about. It surprises me that there
are still topics to cover, but there are ...
We talked this week about what it means
for something to be "proper" English
the better term is really "standard" Eng
lish. So we're getting into a little bit more
philosophical questions, but they're fasci
nating and relevant to everyday writing.
TSD: On the subject of philosophy, do you
have a specific approach to grammar?
Why do you think it's important to write
correctly?
MF: It's important to write correctly be
cause people do judge you based on how
you write, especially now that we aren't
meeting people face to face nearly as much
as we used to. I've hired people without
ever meeting them, based on email ex
changes and their blog and things like that,
so how you present yourself in writing is a
really important part of your professional
persona.
TSD: Is there a story behind your "quick
and dirty" tagline?
MF: Yes, actually there is! Occasionally we
get complaints from schools, saying, "We
can't send our students to something that
has 'dirty' in the title." And early on, people
joked that I was educating one errant porn
seeker at a time, but actually, it's a more
common phrase in Seattle, where I grew up.
My mom used to use it "quick and dirty"
just means sort of fast and easy ... You
know, she'd say, "Let's do a quick and dirty
job on these dishes tonight." When I start
ed, I wanted the podcast to be short, quick
tips. Nobody wants a half an hour grammar
lesson; they want it in five minutes.
TSD: But now college students with dirty
minds get all excited ...
MF: I know, I know! I still get comments
on my Facebook page like, "What's dirty
about this? I don't get it!"
TSD: Are you going to be worried or angry
if there are any mistakes in this article
when we publish it?
MF: No, but you should be! There have
been people who have written about me,
and there have been grammar errors in the
article, and they get lots of angry mail. So
be careful, for your own sake. But I won't
be mad.
