## EDITORIAL The
						problems of publicizing at Stanford 
### 
There is no doubt that one of
the perks of being a Stan
ford student is the access to
world-class speakers and events
right here on campus. Bill Gates
came to campus on April 4 to dis
cuss recent trends in development
in Africa, and the very same day
former Treasury Secretary and
Director of the National Econom
ic Council Larry Summers debat
ed Stanford's John Taylor on gov
ernment response to the financial
crisis and recent recession. On
May 19, Stanford will host its own
version of the renowned TEDx
conference focused on innovation
and information in a variety of
fields. The single biggest com
plaint surrounding these events,
however, is that students don't
hear about them until it is "too
late."That's not to say these events
are not popular the Bill Gates
event and the TEDx conference
sold out within minutes of tickets
being available, and the Summers-
Taylor debate was very well at
tended.
Instead, the problem appears to
be more one of awareness and
publicity. These events were no
doubt publicized extensively via
email and Facebook, but given the
limitations of students' networks,
these would only have reached a
certain subset of students who are
on lists directly related to these is
sues (for example,the Econ majors
list for the Summers-Taylor de
bate). At the same time, because of
the sheer volume of email on lists,
students are disinclined to join lists
outside their immediate interests
because the occasional interesting
event that may come their way is
not worth the hassle of the scores of
irrelevant emails and spam. There
is no easy solution to this. Attempts
to create a central events calendar
have floundered because of a
catch-22 regarding usage. Students
aren't likely to publicize events on
the calendar if no one looks at the
calendar, but no one looks at the
calendar if most events are still
publicized over email.
This phenomenon is not limit
ed to events. Many students are
surprised to find that Stanford of
fers "Angel Grants" of up to
$3,000 to "assist students in pro
ducing a finished public creative
work such as a visual exhibit, film,
stage production, or concert," or
that engineers interested in formal
music study are eligible for an En
gineers in the Arts Award to cover
the cost of private music lessons.
The Haas Center offers not only
its summer or post-graduate pub

lie service fellowships but also a
yearlong Public Service Scholars
Program for students interested in
writing a thesis assisting a specific
community or public interest or
ganization. These resources are
not difficult to find independently
the three examples mentioned
here were well detailed on the re
spective websites of Undergradu
ate Advising and Research, the
Music Department, and the Haas
Center but they are not easy to
find for the student who is not de
liberately looking for them.
The problem again is one of
students either not looking in the
right place or being so over
whelmed by the extraneous infor
mation that arrives in their email
inboxes that they don't bother to
look at all. A searchable, up-to
date directory, with different sec
tions for events (both Stanford
sponsored and those run by stu
dent groups or the ASSU), fund
ing, and other relevant material
such as community service oppor
tunities, newly created classes, and
CDC workshops would be
ideal. Once such a directory is cre
ated, having student groups and
departments make a concerted ef
fort to use it would be in every
one's interest, expanding publicity
and attendance beyond the core
group of supporters.
Until then, students may feel
they have no choice but to rely on
imperfect email lists, but they
should also better use the re
sources that already exist. Aca
demic Directors associated with
each residence are a tremendous
resource for all sorts of academic
opportunities, and department
websites combine information
about resources and events relat
ed to their area of expertise. For
events, the ASSU Student Events
calendar is a worthwhile project
but appears to be limited to events
that are co-sponsored by the
ASSU, while the Stanford Events
website lists many University
sponsored events on a given day
but only a portion of student
group events.
Ultimately, then, it falls on stu
dents to help one another. Hear
about an interesting speaker? Let
your friends know. Have a resume
workshop planned? Pass it on, and
let your Academic Director know
so he or she can pass on the infor
mation. Be on the lookout for
events or resources that you may
not attend yourself and send them
on to someone you know who
will. The entire student body will
be richer for the experience.
