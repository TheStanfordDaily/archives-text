## ACADEMIA MEETS ACTIVISM Ripples to Waves Program on Social Entrepreneurship brings change-makers from around the world to Stanford campus 
### ADRIENNEVON SCHULTHESS 
Zawadi Nyong'o from
Kenya, Taida Horo
zovic from Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Ramzi
Jaber from Palestine
and Steve Williams '92 from San
Francisco may hail from different
corners of the globe, but this
spring they are coming together
as part of the first group of Stan
ford Entrepreneurs in Residence at
Stanford (SEERS).
The entrepreneurs in residence
are a part of the inaugural Ripples
to Waves Program on Social Entre
preneurship, sponsored and initiat
ed by the Center on Democracy,
Development, and the Rule of Law
(CDDRL). SEERS Executive Di
rector Kavita Ramdas got the idea
to develop a program that bridged
the gap between academia and so
cial change activism during her sab
batical year as a CDDRL and Cen
ter for Philanthropy and Civil Soci
ety visiting scholar, eventually
founding the Ripples to Waves Pro
gram on Social Entrepreneurship.
An early iteration of the pro
gram at the Global Fund for

Women, where Ramdas previously
served as CEO, proved difficult to
implement.
"Our assessment of the two year
effort was that it would be better
suited to an academic institution
where visiting practitioners would
have the time and space to reflect
and step back from their daily re
sponsibilities but also share their
wisdom with others," Ramdas
wrote in an email to The Daily.
The program's later iteration at
Stanford aims to bring social en
trepreneurs to campus each quar
ter to attend classes, give talks and
meet with students and professors.
Through these efforts, the pro
gram hopes to create a dialogue to
further the SEERS' understand
ing of how to help their causes and
spark a spirit of giving back at
Stanford.
Two of the entrepreneurs in res
idence, Williams and Horozovic, re
flected on how they left their organ
izations and decided to move to
Stanford to gain new insights in
their fields.
Williams co-founded People
Organized to Win Employment
Rights (POWER), which works in
San Francisco on grassroots issues
pertaining to low-income and/or

minority groups.
"I left [POWER] in January be
cause it felt like there were changes
happening in my work with the eco
nomic and ecological crisis that are
shifting the challenges that we all
face and creating new opportunity,"
Williams said.
Meanwhile, Horozovic left the
organization she co-founded, the
CURE Foundation, which tackles
gender-based violence through ed
ucational and media tools as well as
global campaigns.
"I was recuperating and resting
and recharging my batteries be
cause you don't realize it when
you're there but it can be very diffi
cult to live in a country where for
years your daily newspaper covers
how a new mass grave was found
and dug out and another process of
identification of 100 bodies," Horo
zovic said. "Once I got here 1 real
ized that and 1 could gain a different
perspective on other things I would
like to be doing."
For both Williams and Horo
zovic, the program is an outlet to
learn from innovative ideas on cre
ating change.
"ft is an exciting opportunity for
me to reflect on the work I have
done, to connect with the communi

ty here and to learn about organiza
tions in the area that are doing
specifically funding for women,"
Horozovic said.
Williams reflected on how he
feels coming back to campus has fit
into his life.
"It is an interesting prospect to
come back to campus now 20 years
since I graduated," he said. "The
time I spent at Stanford was really
pivotal in the way I approach the
work now, so in some ways I have
come full circle."
In fact, it was at Stanford that
Williams found his interest in grass
roots organizing.
"When I came to Stanford I
thought I was going to go to law
school," Williams said. "Then after a
summer program in Philadelphia
which was trying to teach grassroots
organizing skills... that's when I
knew what I wanted to do so I spent
the last year on campus writing a
thesis and trying to figure out how
be a organizer."
Williams said he distinctly re
members that the social entrepre
neurship scene has changed dras
tically on campus. According to
him, during his time as a student,
organizers and leaders in the field
would stay for only one night or

give only one talk.
"My hope ... is that we will find
ways for the university to be infused
with the energy of on-the-ground
social change leaders as we begin
from a place that acknowledges
their considerable knowledge and
understanding of how social change
actually happens," Ramdas said.
According to Williams, this new
program is different because it af
fords students the opportunity to
have a sustained dialogue with so
cial entrepreneurs. Furthermore,
students can become involved
through a class called "Challenging
the Status Quo: Social Entrepre
neurs Advancing Democracy, De
velopment and Justice."
The class will engage the four
entrepreneurs in residence and is
led by Ramdas and Kathryn Ston
er-Weiss, CDDRL deputy director
and senior fellow at the Freeman
Spogli Institute (FSI).
"The students in the class have
been asking some very sharp ques
tions that are pushing all the fellows
to think about the work they have
done and hope to be doing in the fu
ture," Williams said.

him, during his time as a student,
organizers and leaders in the field
would stay for only one night or

give only one talk.
"My hope ... is that we will find
ways for the university to be infused
with the energy of on-the-ground
social change leaders as we begin
from a place that acknowledges
their considerable knowledge and
understanding of how social change
actually happens," Ramdas said.
According to Williams, this new
program is different because it af
fords students the opportunity to
have a sustained dialogue with so
cial entrepreneurs. Furthermore,
students can become involved
through a class called "Challenging
the Status Quo: Social Entrepre
neurs Advancing Democracy, De
velopment and Justice."
The class will engage the four
entrepreneurs in residence and is
led by Ramdas and Kathryn Ston
er-Weiss, CDDRL deputy director
and senior fellow at the Freeman
Spogli Institute (FSI).
"The students in the class have
been asking some very sharp ques
tions that are pushing all the fellows
to think about the work they have
done and hope to be doing in the fu
ture," Williams said.

Zawadi Nyong'o from
Kenya, Taida Horo
zovic from Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Ramzi
Jaber from Palestine
and Steve Williams '92 from San
Francisco may hail from different
corners of the globe, but this
spring they are coming together
as part of the first group of Stan
ford Entrepreneurs in Residence at
Stanford (SEERS).
The entrepreneurs in residence
are a part of the inaugural Ripples
to Waves Program on Social Entre
preneurship, sponsored and initiat
ed by the Center on Democracy,
Development, and the Rule of Law
(CDDRL). SEERS Executive Di
rector Kavita Ramdas got the idea
to develop a program that bridged
the gap between academia and so
cial change activism during her sab
batical year as a CDDRL and Cen
ter for Philanthropy and Civil Soci
ety visiting scholar, eventually
founding the Ripples to Waves Pro
gram on Social Entrepreneurship.
An early iteration of the pro
gram at the Global Fund for

Women, where Ramdas previously
served as CEO, proved difficult to
implement.
"Our assessment of the two year
effort was that it would be better
suited to an academic institution
where visiting practitioners would
have the time and space to reflect
and step back from their daily re
sponsibilities but also share their
wisdom with others," Ramdas
wrote in an email to The Daily.
The program's later iteration at
Stanford aims to bring social en
trepreneurs to campus each quar
ter to attend classes, give talks and
meet with students and professors.
Through these efforts, the pro
gram hopes to create a dialogue to
further the SEERS' understand
ing of how to help their causes and
spark a spirit of giving back at
Stanford.
Two of the entrepreneurs in res
idence, Williams and Horozovic, re
flected on how they left their organ
izations and decided to move to
Stanford to gain new insights in
their fields.
Williams co-founded People
Organized to Win Employment
Rights (POWER), which works in
San Francisco on grassroots issues
pertaining to low-income and/or

minority groups.
"I left [POWER] in January be
cause it felt like there were changes
happening in my work with the eco
nomic and ecological crisis that are
shifting the challenges that we all
face and creating new opportunity,"
Williams said.
Meanwhile, Horozovic left the
organization she co-founded, the
CURE Foundation, which tackles
gender-based violence through ed
ucational and media tools as well as
global campaigns.
"I was recuperating and resting
and recharging my batteries be
cause you don't realize it when
you're there but it can be very diffi
cult to live in a country where for
years your daily newspaper covers
how a new mass grave was found
and dug out and another process of
identification of 100 bodies," Horo
zovic said. "Once I got here 1 real
ized that and 1 could gain a different
perspective on other things I would
like to be doing."
For both Williams and Horo
zovic, the program is an outlet to
learn from innovative ideas on cre
ating change.
"ft is an exciting opportunity for
me to reflect on the work I have
done, to connect with the communi

ty here and to learn about organiza
tions in the area that are doing
specifically funding for women,"
Horozovic said.
Williams reflected on how he
feels coming back to campus has fit
into his life.
"It is an interesting prospect to
come back to campus now 20 years
since I graduated," he said. "The
time I spent at Stanford was really
pivotal in the way I approach the
work now, so in some ways I have
come full circle."
In fact, it was at Stanford that
Williams found his interest in grass
roots organizing.
"When I came to Stanford I
thought I was going to go to law
school," Williams said. "Then after a
summer program in Philadelphia
which was trying to teach grassroots
organizing skills... that's when I
knew what I wanted to do so I spent
the last year on campus writing a
thesis and trying to figure out how
be a organizer."
Williams said he distinctly re
members that the social entrepre
neurship scene has changed dras
tically on campus. According to
