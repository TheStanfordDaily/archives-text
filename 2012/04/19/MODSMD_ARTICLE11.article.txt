# A 						LOOK AT A FOOTBALL LEGEND
## JOHN ELWAY HISTORY CORNER 
### â€“ Natasha Weaser 
With Andrew Luck 'l2 as the pro
jected No. 1 pick in the 2012 NFL
draft, The Stanford Daily took a
look back at the last time a Stan
ford player was in a similar posi
tion legendary quarterback John Elway 'B3 in
the 1983 NFL draft.
"One thing is for sure ... Elway will be a mil
lionaire soon. Be it baseball or football, the 22-
year-old economics major will probably sign the
largest professional contact ever offered to a
rookie athlete," reported The Daily on April 25,
f983.
Elway was to be Stanford's first No. f draft pick
since 1972, when the New England Patriots select
ed Heisman Trophy winner Jim Plunkett.
In 1983, Elway, a two-sport star at Stanford,
had hinted that he preferred to play football over
baseball, but would think twice if offered a posi
tion on the Baltimore Colts or another East Coast
NFL team.
Elway was drafted by the Colts and was, pre
dictably, unhappy about the arrangement, The

Daily reported on April 27,1983.
"Mr. Kush, I don't want to be a jerk or any
thing, but we've told you for three months that I
don't want to play for Baltimore," Elway in
formed Colts head coach Frank Kush in a phone
call. "And I know for a fact that you were offered
three one's and a quarterback and you turned it
down. And right now you've got nothing."
Elway threatened to switch sports entirely and
join a professional baseball team instead. His ru
mored choice was the New York Yankees.
Although in baseball he had an impressive .318
batting average in 42 games, his football record
was far more spectacular. He set 17 Pac-10 Con
ference records and passed for a career total of
9,349 yards and 77 touchdowns.
On May 3,1983, The Daily reported that Elway
would be playing football with the Denver Bron
cos instead, after the Colts finally relented and
traded him.
"John Elway ended his Cold War with the Bal
timore Colts last night," read the article. "But he
broke off his yearlong romance with the New
York Yankees."

John Elway, at a press conference in San Jose on April 26, 1983, responded to a question about his
decision to turn down the Baltimore Colts, saying he was "closer to baseball than football." Elway was
ultimately traded to the Denver Broncos, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January 2004.
