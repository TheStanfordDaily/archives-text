## MODERN MANNERS Why I dropped a great class 
### Jeff Mandell 
I have been thinking of writing
about the Stanford Bookstore
for a while. Intellectually, it is a
fascinating place. Its three sprawl
ing floors display an enormous
amount of merchandise, from
clothing to lip balm to computers.
They must be selling quite a lot to
pay the expenses of maintaining
their inventory and their space.
The comfy chairs and the mezza
nine-level cafe suggest that the
bookstore is not just a store but
also a place to be. But as media
consumption becomes increas
ingly electronic, what will the
bookstore do to flourish?
Now to the story that inspired
this column. I went to the book
store last week to return a book
for a biology class. I hadn't
dropped the class, and I hadn't
found a cheaper copy of the book
online. I had simply made a mis
take and bought a recommended
book, thinking that it was re
quired. While I admire those who
diligently study the recommend
ed texts, I decided that I was un
likely to do so in this case. I also
wanted to save 30 bucks.
The employee at the customer
service desk would not take the
return because I had not dropped
the class. At the beginning of each
quarter, there is a certain period
of time when books may be re
turned for any reason, and after
that students must present proof
that they have dropped the rele
vant class. I missed this deadline
by two days.
In away, this policy is very un
derstandable. I assume it exists
because the textbook division of
the bookstore could not be finan
cially solvent if no one bought
books there. If they allowed re
turns too late into the quarter,
they would risk getting too many
returns from people who use
bookstore books for the first cou
ple weeks before receiving cheap
er copies from online. Not only
would the bookstore be losing the
money from the initial sales, it
would essentially be lending out
its books for free. Anecdotally, it

seems like a lot of people are suc
ceeding at doing this even with
the current return policy.
Luckily, the book I wanted to
return was for a large lecture class
with unlimited enrollment. So I
told the bookstore representative
that if I wanted to, I could easily
drop the class, return the book
and then re-enroll right after
ward. How about we skip this
game, I suggested, and you just let
me return the book?
My request was denied. I don't
hold anything against the employ
ee because he made it clear that
the decision to go against compa
ny policy was not his to make. I
walked outside, took out my lap
top and dropped the class. I got
back in line and showed the Axess
schedule on my screen to the
same person. Before he even fin
ished processing the refund, I had
already added the class back to
my schedule.
Since there was a clear route to
getting my money back, the book
store's failure to cooperate with
me was not a big deal. I'm not
angry at the bookstore; I don't
feel that I deserve any sort of
apology, and I will probably con
tinue to buy books there in the fu
ture.
All the same, this episode wast
ed everyone's time and certainly
did nothing to improve my rela
tionship with the bookstore. I un
derstand the need to protect exist
ing revenue streams until new
ones are found, but whatever the
bookstore's path into the future,
unnecessarily inconveniencing
customers is not the way to be suc
cessful in the long term.
