### Sincerely, GREG BOARDMAN Vice Provost for Student Affairs 
Dear students.
The recent ASSU elections
were marred by disrespectful
and hurtful debate and discus
sion. Many students have ex
pressed concerns about the dis
tribution of unsolicited bulk
emails, text messages and cam
pus blogs and we are reviewing
all complaints.

The elections are an opportu
nity to engage students in dia
logue about student governance
and to give voice to their views. It

is also an opportunity for vigorous
debate. The language that we use
in person, in writing and on-line is
a reflection of what we think and
who we are. In all our communica
tions, it is our individual and col
lective responsibility to embrace
and practice civility.
I ask that as a community, we
affirm the values of care, mutual
respect and concern for others.
