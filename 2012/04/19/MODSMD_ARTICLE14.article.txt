# SEEING GREEN
## Hiding in the uncertainty basement 
### Holly Moeller 
LINCOLN, NE. At 11:30
p.m., after 13 hours of math
ecology talks, I was dead to
the world. Almost. I just couldn't
figure out why someone had sud
denly parked all the city's fire en
gines outside our hotel, or why
their sirens sounded so odd.
Despite my best attempts to
burrow under the blankets and
away from the sound, my brain
was slowly returning to life. "Isn't
this tornado country?" I won
dered groggily.
The answer and an adrena
line-fueled acceleration of
thought processes came when
a hotel staffer pounded on the
door, shouted "Tornado coming
get to the basement!" and dis
appeared into the stampede of
hotel guests heading for the stair
well.
I shook my roommate awake,
grabbed a sweater and notes on
my latest mathematical model,
forgot my eyeglasses and my shoes
and pounded down the stairs.
As my fellow conference-goers
and I crowded into the nicely fin
ished hotel basement with the rest
of the hotel's guests, we exchanged
looks of nervous excitement. Most
of us had never experienced a tor
nado warning before: What a great
story we'd have to tell when we re
turned home from Nebraska!
Fortunately for us, it would re
main a great story. No tornadoes
touched down in Lincoln that
night, though other cities in the
plains were not so lucky.
We won't be able to tally this
twister season's damages until
summer's end, but with April's
typical spike in thunderstorms and
tornadoes, speculation is rampant.
And, as an increasingly public de
bate on the significance and
even existence of climate
change rages on, some of the dis
course is getting a little volatile.
Especially when, earlier this
month, a CNN meteorologist

called a Texas twister evidence of
climate change.
Her connection was tenuous,
but not unfounded: As increasing
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels
trap more of the sun's heat, we ex
pect the associated climatic shifts
to produce "more extreme"
weather.
Late last year, the Intergovern
mental Panel on Climate Change
released a report specifically ad
dressing the link between climate
change and extreme weather. The
Panel's scientists carefully sum
marized the predicted changes to
historic weather patterns, and,
perhaps more importantly, includ
ed the relative certainty of their
predictions.
For example, the world's best
climate scientists concur that, on
average, hot days will get hotter,
heat waves will intensify and hur
ricanes will get more frequent.
But unfortunately for the CNN
meteorologist, because the fine
scale, long-term data and models
needed to predict local weather
aren't available, the scientists
can't say anything yet about tor
nadoes.
Why, though, is there so much
uncertainty around how climate
change will alter our daily lives?
Part of the reason stems from
the difference between climate and
weather. The former is a broad pat
tern, described by long-term aver
ages (e.g., seasonal temperature)
and seasonal summations (e.g., an
nual rainfall). Weather, by con
trast, is a transient phenomenon: a
two-day cold snap, or a splash-and
dash shower.
Weather, the daily product of
climate, is inherently more vari
able than its statistically pack
aged, long-lived parent. Just as it's
much easier for you to predict the
average number of runs per Gi
ants game than it is to nail the
score on every game of the sea
son, it's easier for scientists to pre-

diet global or regional climate
trends (averaged across both time
and space) than it is for them to
tell you which weekend to pick for
your next barbeque.
Take, for example, the measly
success rate of your local weather
man (though I think ours predict
rain just to spice things up a bit). If
that's the best that regional ex
perts and day-of radar can do, no
wonder our global climate models
can only give us the big picture.
Of course, it's weather and, in
particular, extreme weather that
makes the biggest impression. It's
the tornado that rousts you from
bed; the windstorm that delays
your flight; the drought that tight
ens your water belt. We'd love to
be able to predict these extremes,
to have plenty of advanced warn
ing for evacuation in advance of a
major hurricane and to know
which crops to plant given the
summer's coming rain pattern.
That's why the prediction we
can make that weather will be
come more variable, making these
extremes more extreme —is so
very troubling. In addition to loss
of life and property damage pro
duced by intensified storm sys
tems, we'll also have to face grow
ing insecurity in our food supply,
as wet places become waterlogged
and dry places grow parched.
However, the more extreme
weather events we have, the more
opportunities I'll get to see my
field's leaders lounging about in
their pajamas. Note to self: Re
member eyeglasses next time.

dered groggily.
The answer and an adrena
line-fueled acceleration of
thought processes came when
a hotel staffer pounded on the
door, shouted "Tornado coming
get to the basement!" and dis
appeared into the stampede of
hotel guests heading for the stair
well.
I shook my roommate awake,
grabbed a sweater and notes on
my latest mathematical model,
forgot my eyeglasses and my shoes
and pounded down the stairs.
As my fellow conference-goers
and I crowded into the nicely fin
ished hotel basement with the rest
of the hotel's guests, we exchanged
looks of nervous excitement. Most
of us had never experienced a tor
nado warning before: What a great
story we'd have to tell when we re
turned home from Nebraska!
Fortunately for us, it would re
main a great story. No tornadoes
touched down in Lincoln that
night, though other cities in the
plains were not so lucky.
We won't be able to tally this
twister season's damages until
summer's end, but with April's
typical spike in thunderstorms and
tornadoes, speculation is rampant.
And, as an increasingly public de
bate on the significance and
even existence of climate
change rages on, some of the dis
course is getting a little volatile.
Especially when, earlier this
month, a CNN meteorologist

called a Texas twister evidence of
climate change.
Her connection was tenuous,
but not unfounded: As increasing
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels
trap more of the sun's heat, we ex
pect the associated climatic shifts
to produce "more extreme"
weather.
Late last year, the Intergovern
mental Panel on Climate Change
released a report specifically ad
dressing the link between climate
change and extreme weather. The
Panel's scientists carefully sum
marized the predicted changes to
historic weather patterns, and,
perhaps more importantly, includ
ed the relative certainty of their
predictions.
For example, the world's best
climate scientists concur that, on
average, hot days will get hotter,
heat waves will intensify and hur
ricanes will get more frequent.
But unfortunately for the CNN
meteorologist, because the fine
scale, long-term data and models
needed to predict local weather
aren't available, the scientists
can't say anything yet about tor
nadoes.
Why, though, is there so much
uncertainty around how climate
change will alter our daily lives?
Part of the reason stems from
the difference between climate and
weather. The former is a broad pat
tern, described by long-term aver
ages (e.g., seasonal temperature)
and seasonal summations (e.g., an
nual rainfall). Weather, by con
trast, is a transient phenomenon: a
two-day cold snap, or a splash-and
dash shower.
Weather, the daily product of
climate, is inherently more vari
able than its statistically pack
aged, long-lived parent. Just as it's
much easier for you to predict the
average number of runs per Gi
ants game than it is to nail the
score on every game of the sea
son, it's easier for scientists to pre-

diet global or regional climate
trends (averaged across both time
and space) than it is for them to
tell you which weekend to pick for
your next barbeque.
Take, for example, the measly
success rate of your local weather
man (though I think ours predict
rain just to spice things up a bit). If
that's the best that regional ex
perts and day-of radar can do, no
wonder our global climate models
can only give us the big picture.
Of course, it's weather and, in
particular, extreme weather that
makes the biggest impression. It's
the tornado that rousts you from
bed; the windstorm that delays
your flight; the drought that tight
ens your water belt. We'd love to
be able to predict these extremes,
to have plenty of advanced warn
ing for evacuation in advance of a
major hurricane and to know
which crops to plant given the
summer's coming rain pattern.
That's why the prediction we
can make that weather will be
come more variable, making these
extremes more extreme —is so
very troubling. In addition to loss
of life and property damage pro
duced by intensified storm sys
tems, we'll also have to face grow
ing insecurity in our food supply,
as wet places become waterlogged
and dry places grow parched.
However, the more extreme
weather events we have, the more
opportunities I'll get to see my
field's leaders lounging about in
their pajamas. Note to self: Re
member eyeglasses next time.

LINCOLN, NE. At 11:30
p.m., after 13 hours of math
ecology talks, I was dead to
the world. Almost. I just couldn't
figure out why someone had sud
denly parked all the city's fire en
gines outside our hotel, or why
their sirens sounded so odd.
Despite my best attempts to
burrow under the blankets and
away from the sound, my brain
was slowly returning to life. "Isn't
this tornado country?" I won
