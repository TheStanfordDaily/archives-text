## When should top coaches hang it up? 
### Jack Blanchat 
When I saw that the 59-year-old
Pat Summitt, the legendary
coach of the Tennessee Volun
teers, had officially retired yes
terday after 38 years of leading
the Vols, I initially was sad that such a legend was
having to leave the game so early. But then I did a
double take, did some mental math and was
blown away: Summitt had been the head coach at
Tennessee since she was 22 years old. She was,
quite literally, leaving the only job she had ever
known.
Consider this: I'm a senior in college and will
turn 23 years old in June, I can't even begin to fath
om doing something for the next 38 years of my
life. Shoot, I can't even fathom being 38 years old.
But Summitt's all-too-early retirement made me
wonder: how do coaching legends know when it's
time to walk away? How does someone who is so
borderline-manically obsessed with a game for so
long decide that it's time to fade into the shadows?
With Summitt, the choice to retire wasn't real
ly hers to make. Her battle with early-onset
Alzheimer's meant that she was only going to be
able to stay on the sideline for so long. But even
before Summitt made her diagnosis public, you
could tell the end of her career was coming soon
er rather than later at least, to me it seemed
that way. I'll never forget watching her storm up
and down the sideline during the 2010 Tennessee-
Stanford basketball game in Knoxville. She was
icy, intelligent and fearsome in away that was pal
pable every time she walked past my seat. But you
could also see the bags under her eyes and the
hints of weariness when she yelled at all-too-terri
fied college kids over on the Volunteers' bench.
My dad, who was at the game with me, said she was
"like a lion in winter" (the winter of her career,
that is). I saw and understood what he meant.
But for other coaching legends, the choice is
theirs. And it's hard to walk away at the right time.
Some people walk away on top, like John Wood
en, Summitt's rival for the title of "Greatest Col
lege Basketball Coach of All Time". Wooden
hung up his whistle in 1975, after his UCLA Bru
ins won the NCAA title for the 10th time in 12
years. Others leave in disgrace, like Joe Paterno,
whose Penn State program is now sadly synony
mous with deceit (and far worse things).
And some coaches just never leave, even when
their effectiveness has clearly waned, like basket-
