# SIMPLE SWEEP

### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
It was a stress-free and pleas
ant final home match for the No.
12 Stanford men's tennis team on
Wednesday afternoon under a
brilliantly blue Palo Alto sky. The
Cardinal took out some of its
built-up frustration following last
weekend's brutal pair of losses
against UCLA and USC by thor
oughly dominating unranked Pa
cific 7-0.
Stanford did not lose a set the
entire match and outscored the
opposing team 96 games to 30.
"It was really nice to come out
here and have a focused match
where everybody did what they
needed to do," said junior Matt
Kandath. "That's something
we've been lacking in our recent
tough matches so it was good to
play a team where everybody
feels good and we can get a solid
win."
The tone was set during the
three doubles matches where,
perhaps to liven up his squad,
head coach John Whitlinger
slightly shuffled his lineup. In
stead of the usual pairings of sen
iors Ryan Thacher and Bradley
Klahn at the No. 1 spot, juniors
Kandath and Denis Lin at the No.
2 and freshmen John Morrissey
and Robert Stineman at the No. 3
position, Whitlinger had Thacher
and Lin play No. 1, Klahn and
Morrissey No. 2 and Kandath and
Stineman No. 3. All three new
pairings played well and each had
easy wins, securing the first point
for the Cardinal.
In singles play, Stanford hasn't
looked better all season, a promis
ing sign with the playoffs looming
on the horizon. Lin led the way
with Stanford's second point, dou
ble-bageling his opponent (6-0,6-
0) out of, for him, the uncharted
No. 6 position for most of the
season Lin has played No. 3 or No.
4 singles. Next were easy wins by
Klahn and Kandath 6-2, 6-1

and 6-0, 6-2, respectively fol
lowed by Morrissey's team-lead
ing 16th dual-match win out of the
No. 4 position. Sophomore Daniel
Ho, playing No. 5, battled his op
ponent to a 6-2,6-4 victory before
Thacher ended the match by clos
ing out his foe 6-4,6-3, giving Stan
ford the shutout.
When asked about the reshuf
fled lineup, Kandath said: "We're
pretty used to all the lineup shift
ing this season what with all
the injuries we've had. It's really
nice that we have the depth where
people can fill in, play where they
need to play and come out and
still win."
Team-wide depth is an advan
tage that Whitlinger will likely
look to exploit when the hectic
collegiate tennis playoffs kick off
next week.
Before the playoffs begin,
however, Stanford has one more
regular season match, fittingly
against rival Cal. The Cardinal has
beaten the Golden Bears the last
four times they have played, a
streak the team will certainly be
looking to build on this Friday in
Berkeley.
"We like where we're at right
now," Kandath said. "The L.A.
matches were real tough last
weekend; they beat us up pretty
good. We felt that and since then
we've made some changes, we had
a long team meeting and figured
out what we need to do. We're
going to keep the same energy
from today against Cal and then
take that with us down to Ojai for
the Pac-12 tournament and try to
finally knock off those L.A.
schools."
This might have been the final
home match of the season for the
Cardinal, but the excitement is
just building as the postseason is
right around the corner.
Stanford and Cal will square
off Friday at 3 p.m. in Berkeley.
