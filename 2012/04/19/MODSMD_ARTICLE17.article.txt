## Rodgers win leads Card in Santa Cruz 
### AUSTIN BLOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its strongest showing in
months, the Stanford men's golf
team finished second to No. 1 Texas
at the Western Intercollegiate, held
at the famous Pasatiempo course in
Santa Cruz. Freshman Patrick
Rodgers, the nation's third-ranked
college golfer, won the individual
tournament by two strokes, shoot
ing 4-under-par through three
rounds to claim his second victory
of the 2011-2012 season.
"We were really happy with the
result," said head coach Conrad
Ray. "Obviously we go to all these
events trying to win, so second is
second, but I think that there's a lot
to be proud of and I think that the
guys were happy with the effort
they put in... We really gave Texas
a run for their money at the end, it
was down to just a couple of shots
with a few holes to play."
Junior Andrew Yun finished
three strokes behind Rodgers to
take fourth and sophomore
Cameron Wilson tied for seventh at
1-over-par. Heading into the final
round, Texas led the Cardinal by
eight shots. Buoyed by Rodgers'
third-round 68 and Yun's 69, the
Cardinal cut into the Longhorns'
lead but was unable to fully close
the gap, finishing four strokes back.
"Texas is such a good team.
They're the No. 1 team for a rea
son," Yun said. "They won seven
times this year, and it is disappoint
ing that we didn't finish first, but we
have so many positive things to take
out of this... it just gives us confi
dence knowing that on any given
day, we can beat anybody ... we're
not that far off from being the No. 1
team in the country."
"I think we've been playing well
all spring, but it just kind of came to
gether and our preparation started
to pay off," said senior team captain
Wilson Bowen. "It was a really de
manding golf course, and I think we
play well on harder, championship
courses just because the best teams
tend to shine in those situations."
The Cardinal, currently ranked
No. 6 in the nation, beat out four
highly ranked Pac-12 rivals at
Pasatiempo: No. 3 UCLA, No. 5
USC, No. 7 Cal and No. 10 Oregon.
Stanford will soon take on these
same teams and the rest of its high
ly competitive conference at the

Pac-12 Championships, which start
next Friday at Oregon State's home
course in Corvallis, Ore. The Cardi
nal has not won the conference
championship since 1994.
No members of the team have
played the Corvallis course, but
players will benefit from the knowl
edge and experience of assistant
coach Philip Rowe, who finished
second in the Pac-10 Champi
onships at the course as a Stanford
senior in 2002. Rowe also won the
U.S. Intercollegiate at Stanford that
year.
On April 11, three days before
the start of the tournament, fresh
man Rodgers was named one of 10
semifinalists for the Ben Hogan
award, given each year to the na
tion's best college golfer.
Rodgers has finished in the top
10 in seven of nine tournaments this
year. On Saturday, he opened with a
67 and then shot 71 to drop into sec
ond place before his Sunday round
of 68 won him the tournament.
Rodgers outplayed both of the na
tion's top two golfers: No. 1 Jordan
Spieth and No. 2 Dylan Fritelli, both
from Texas.
"It's one of the strongest fields,"
Bowen said. "He beat [UCLA
golfer] Patrick Cantlay down the
stretch, and Dylan Fritelli, and a
bunch of other players who are up
for the player of the year nomina
tion," Bowen said. "He made a
bunch of great putts down the
stretch and managed to pull it out,
which was good to see."
Yun said he and Rodgers, who
played together all three rounds,
fed off each other's successes and
supported each other through
tough periods.
"We were giving each other a lot
of positive vibes, encouraging each
other throughout the whole tourna
ment, and I think that helped both
of us play really well," he said.
Following Pac-12s, Stanford
will host the NCAA Regional at
the Stanford Golf Course starting
May 17. A strong finish there
would send the Cardinal to nation
als, held at Riviera Country Club in
Los Angeles. Stanford last won the
NCAA Championships in 2007
and finished one stroke behind
champion UCLA in 2008. Last
year, however, the Cardinal missed
out on nationals entirely after a
poor showing at the regional tour
nament in Indiana.
Yun said the team's recent
strong finishes indicate that the
Cardinal is peaking at the right
time. He added that other teams
have taken notice of Stanford's re
cent success.

"Before, I think they would just
write us off as a very good school
with good players [that] all couldn't
play well at the same time," he said.
"At this time of year we're having
three, four, maybe even five guys
playing well, which is going to be
crucial I think they're definitely
taking notice, and I don't think
we're flying under the radar any
more."

other throughout the whole tourna
ment, and I think that helped both
of us play really well," he said.
Following Pac-12s, Stanford
will host the NCAA Regional at
the Stanford Golf Course starting
May 17. A strong finish there
would send the Cardinal to nation
als, held at Riviera Country Club in
Los Angeles. Stanford last won the
NCAA Championships in 2007
and finished one stroke behind
champion UCLA in 2008. Last
year, however, the Cardinal missed
out on nationals entirely after a
poor showing at the regional tour
nament in Indiana.
Yun said the team's recent
strong finishes indicate that the
Cardinal is peaking at the right
time. He added that other teams
have taken notice of Stanford's re
cent success.

"Before, I think they would just
write us off as a very good school
with good players [that] all couldn't
play well at the same time," he said.
"At this time of year we're having
three, four, maybe even five guys
playing well, which is going to be
crucial I think they're definitely
taking notice, and I don't think
we're flying under the radar any
more."

In its strongest showing in
months, the Stanford men's golf
team finished second to No. 1 Texas
at the Western Intercollegiate, held
at the famous Pasatiempo course in
Santa Cruz. Freshman Patrick
Rodgers, the nation's third-ranked
college golfer, won the individual
tournament by two strokes, shoot
ing 4-under-par through three
rounds to claim his second victory
of the 2011-2012 season.
"We were really happy with the
result," said head coach Conrad
Ray. "Obviously we go to all these
events trying to win, so second is
second, but I think that there's a lot
to be proud of and I think that the
guys were happy with the effort
they put in... We really gave Texas
a run for their money at the end, it
was down to just a couple of shots
with a few holes to play."
Junior Andrew Yun finished
three strokes behind Rodgers to
take fourth and sophomore
Cameron Wilson tied for seventh at
1-over-par. Heading into the final
round, Texas led the Cardinal by
eight shots. Buoyed by Rodgers'
third-round 68 and Yun's 69, the
Cardinal cut into the Longhorns'
lead but was unable to fully close
the gap, finishing four strokes back.
"Texas is such a good team.
They're the No. 1 team for a rea
son," Yun said. "They won seven
times this year, and it is disappoint
ing that we didn't finish first, but we
have so many positive things to take
out of this... it just gives us confi
dence knowing that on any given
day, we can beat anybody ... we're
not that far off from being the No. 1
team in the country."
"I think we've been playing well
all spring, but it just kind of came to
gether and our preparation started
to pay off," said senior team captain
Wilson Bowen. "It was a really de
manding golf course, and I think we
play well on harder, championship
courses just because the best teams
tend to shine in those situations."
The Cardinal, currently ranked
No. 6 in the nation, beat out four
highly ranked Pac-12 rivals at
Pasatiempo: No. 3 UCLA, No. 5
USC, No. 7 Cal and No. 10 Oregon.
Stanford will soon take on these
same teams and the rest of its high
ly competitive conference at the

Pac-12 Championships, which start
next Friday at Oregon State's home
course in Corvallis, Ore. The Cardi
nal has not won the conference
championship since 1994.
No members of the team have
played the Corvallis course, but
players will benefit from the knowl
edge and experience of assistant
coach Philip Rowe, who finished
second in the Pac-10 Champi
onships at the course as a Stanford
senior in 2002. Rowe also won the
U.S. Intercollegiate at Stanford that
year.
On April 11, three days before
the start of the tournament, fresh
man Rodgers was named one of 10
semifinalists for the Ben Hogan
award, given each year to the na
tion's best college golfer.
Rodgers has finished in the top
10 in seven of nine tournaments this
year. On Saturday, he opened with a
67 and then shot 71 to drop into sec
ond place before his Sunday round
of 68 won him the tournament.
Rodgers outplayed both of the na
tion's top two golfers: No. 1 Jordan
Spieth and No. 2 Dylan Fritelli, both
from Texas.
"It's one of the strongest fields,"
Bowen said. "He beat [UCLA
golfer] Patrick Cantlay down the
stretch, and Dylan Fritelli, and a
bunch of other players who are up
for the player of the year nomina
tion," Bowen said. "He made a
bunch of great putts down the
stretch and managed to pull it out,
which was good to see."
Yun said he and Rodgers, who
played together all three rounds,
fed off each other's successes and
supported each other through
tough periods.
"We were giving each other a lot
of positive vibes, encouraging each
other throughout the whole tourna
ment, and I think that helped both
of us play really well," he said.
