## ASSU debates Judicial Affairs changes 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At Wednesday's Graduate Student
Council (GSC) meeting, council mem
bers and Undergraduate Senators de
bated with representatives from the
Board of Judicial Affairs over a bill to
approve the Alternate Review Process
(ARP), currently in its pilot stage. The
ARP reviews cases involving sexual as

sault, sexual violence, relationship vio
lence and stalking in which a Stanford
student is the alleged offender.
The shift to the ARP must be ap
proved by a two-thirds majority of both
the GSC and the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate because it represents a change to
the Judicial Affairs charter.
Fr0m1996 to 2009, there were 104 re
ports of sexual assault, yet only 16 cases
of sexual assault were reported to the

Stanford Judicial Process and only three
went to hearing, according to Judicial
Affairs Office statistics.
After the establishment of the ARP
in April 2010, however, there have been
21 cases reported, 13 transferred to ARP
and 12 tried. Of the 12 hearings in the
past two years, 10 offenders were found
responsible, and only one verdict was re-
versed in appeal.
"We take that as a sign that
people see ARP as a review
process to make themselves feel
more safe on campus," said Jamie
Pontius-Hogan, a student affairs
officer in the Judicial Affairs Of
fice.
Most of the proposed changes
to the process were made in 2011
to align University policy with sug
gestions made in a "Dear Col
league Letter" from the Depart
ment of Education's Office of
Civil Rights. Failure to change
University policy on the subject
would risk a breach of Stanford's
Title IX obligations and thus a loss
of federal funding.
Those changes, which no one at
the meeting disputed, include a
lowered burden of proof from be
yond a reasonable doubt to pre
ponderance of evidence and allow
an appeal from both the impacted
party and the responding party to
any verdict.
The Board of Judicial Affairs
additionally proposed a reduction
in the size of the reviewing panels
from six to four sitting members
on the judicial panel.
"[We chose four] out of con
cern for the comfort of both par
ties, and extreme concern for

[their] privacy and confidentiali
ty," Pontius-Hogan explained in
reviewing the ARP process. "Also,
most people on the Board felt
strongly that it should be student
centered and having four we were
able to have three students and
one faculty or staff member, which
felt like a good balance."
The more controversial change
proposed by the Board of Judicial
Affairs and affirmed by the Office
of the President was the shift from
requiring a unanimous ruling for a
conviction to only requiring a ma
jority. Most cases since 2010 have
been unanimous, according to the
Board.
Student representatives in
favor of the change argued
Wednesday that in bringing a case
to a hearing, an affected student
must convince several campus of
ficials of the validity of their com
plaint, potentially including resi
dential staff, professors, public
health staff and investigators. The
dissenting vote of a single mem
ber, they argued, should not nullify
a process that is often long and
traumatizing for the victim.
"What we're talking about is
where to put the burden of appeal
... [since] most students found re
sponsible will appeal," said
Michele Landis Dauber, professor
of law.
Dauber noted that several stu
dents approached her, feeling in
timidated by the pre-ARP Judicial
Affairs process and worried about

case outcome.
Those advocating the reten
tion of unanimous voting to ob
tain a guilty verdict argued that
such a requirement should be pre
served to protect the rights of the
accused, especially considering
the already lowered standard of
proof.
"I'd like to ask you to think for
a moment about what this process
would be like from the responding
student's perspective," said gradu
ate student Allison Rhines 'lO.
"Think back to the last intimate
act [you] were involved in and
then think of trying to convince
two people that [you] acted in a
way that was respectful to the
other person's consent in that act
... two people who weren't there.
And can you imagine having to do
that on a burden of being suspend
ed from Stanford?"
Although the meeting was offi
cially a Graduate Student Council
event, council members voted to
give all present students a voice in
the speaking order. Most of the
current and several newly-elected
undergraduate senators attended
the meeting.
The Undergraduate Senate
will likely put the subject on previ
ous notice next Tuesday before
voting on the charter the subse
quent week. The GSC will vote on
the charter on a similar time
frame.

conviction to only requiring a ma
jority. Most cases since 2010 have
been unanimous, according to the
Board.
Student representatives in
favor of the change argued
Wednesday that in bringing a case
to a hearing, an affected student
must convince several campus of
ficials of the validity of their com
plaint, potentially including resi
dential staff, professors, public
health staff and investigators. The
dissenting vote of a single mem
ber, they argued, should not nullify
a process that is often long and
traumatizing for the victim.
"What we're talking about is
where to put the burden of appeal
... [since] most students found re
sponsible will appeal," said
Michele Landis Dauber, professor
of law.
Dauber noted that several stu
dents approached her, feeling in
timidated by the pre-ARP Judicial
Affairs process and worried about

case outcome.
Those advocating the reten
tion of unanimous voting to ob
tain a guilty verdict argued that
such a requirement should be pre
served to protect the rights of the
accused, especially considering
the already lowered standard of
proof.
"I'd like to ask you to think for
a moment about what this process
would be like from the responding
student's perspective," said gradu
ate student Allison Rhines 'lO.
"Think back to the last intimate
act [you] were involved in and
then think of trying to convince
two people that [you] acted in a
way that was respectful to the
other person's consent in that act
... two people who weren't there.
And can you imagine having to do
that on a burden of being suspend
ed from Stanford?"
Although the meeting was offi
cially a Graduate Student Council
event, council members voted to
give all present students a voice in
the speaking order. Most of the
current and several newly-elected
undergraduate senators attended
the meeting.
The Undergraduate Senate
will likely put the subject on previ
ous notice next Tuesday before
voting on the charter the subse
quent week. The GSC will vote on
the charter on a similar time
frame.

At Wednesday's Graduate Student
Council (GSC) meeting, council mem
bers and Undergraduate Senators de
bated with representatives from the
Board of Judicial Affairs over a bill to
approve the Alternate Review Process
(ARP), currently in its pilot stage. The
ARP reviews cases involving sexual as

sault, sexual violence, relationship vio
lence and stalking in which a Stanford
student is the alleged offender.
The shift to the ARP must be ap
proved by a two-thirds majority of both
the GSC and the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate because it represents a change to
the Judicial Affairs charter.
Fr0m1996 to 2009, there were 104 re
ports of sexual assault, yet only 16 cases
of sexual assault were reported to the

Stanford Judicial Process and only three
went to hearing, according to Judicial
Affairs Office statistics.
After the establishment of the ARP
in April 2010, however, there have been
21 cases reported, 13 transferred to ARP
and 12 tried. Of the 12 hearings in the
past two years, 10 offenders were found
responsible, and only one verdict was re-
versed in appeal.
"We take that as a sign that
people see ARP as a review
process to make themselves feel
more safe on campus," said Jamie
Pontius-Hogan, a student affairs
officer in the Judicial Affairs Of
fice.
Most of the proposed changes
to the process were made in 2011
to align University policy with sug
gestions made in a "Dear Col
league Letter" from the Depart
ment of Education's Office of
Civil Rights. Failure to change
University policy on the subject
would risk a breach of Stanford's
Title IX obligations and thus a loss
of federal funding.
Those changes, which no one at
the meeting disputed, include a
lowered burden of proof from be
yond a reasonable doubt to pre
ponderance of evidence and allow
an appeal from both the impacted
party and the responding party to
any verdict.
The Board of Judicial Affairs
additionally proposed a reduction
in the size of the reviewing panels
from six to four sitting members
on the judicial panel.
"[We chose four] out of con
cern for the comfort of both par
ties, and extreme concern for

[their] privacy and confidentiali
ty," Pontius-Hogan explained in
reviewing the ARP process. "Also,
most people on the Board felt
strongly that it should be student
centered and having four we were
able to have three students and
one faculty or staff member, which
felt like a good balance."
The more controversial change
proposed by the Board of Judicial
Affairs and affirmed by the Office
of the President was the shift from
requiring a unanimous ruling for a
conviction to only requiring a ma
jority. Most cases since 2010 have
been unanimous, according to the
Board.
