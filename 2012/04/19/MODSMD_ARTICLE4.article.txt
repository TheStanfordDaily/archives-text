## Researchers receive grant for stem cell cardio trials 
### JUDITH PELPOLA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers at the Stanford Cardio
vascular Institute (CVI) have received
a National Heart, Lung & Blood Insti
tute grant of over $5 million, to be dis
persed over seven years, to conduct
clinical trials for stem cell therapy in
cardiovascular diseases.
The trials will be the first to involve
putting embryonic or induced pluripo
tent stem cells into human hearts.
"I think this is really an important
step in forming a properly designed
clinical trial to really find out the effect
of stem cell therapy for patients with
heart disease," said Phillip Yang 'B4,
professor of cardiovascular medicine
and co-principal investigator for the

grant.
Previous studies have shown that
bone marrow stem cells may improve
heart function by helping repair dam
age caused by various diseases. While
heart cells are incapable of independ
ent regeneration, stem cells can func
tion as cardiac cells and thus help treat
damaged heart tissue. The trials will
build on earlier studies by using
pluripotent stem cells, such as embry
onic stem cells, which can replicate vir
tually any kind of cell in the body.
One of the primary goals of the stud
ies is to understand stem cells more
fully and why they may be therapeutic,
according to John Cooke, professor of
cardiovascular medicine and the
grant's principal investigator.
"We want to go beyond looking at

'yes or no, they are therapeutic' to 'what
is the mechanism by which they are
therapeutic,'" Cooke said.
Researchers will be using imaging
technology such as MRIs to track the
stem cells after injection and see if they
differentiate into cardiac cells and inte
grate into the heart.
"We're asking a specific question:

'do they survive?'" Yang said.
If proven effective, such stem
cell therapy could potentially
help patients currently awaiting a
heart transplant.
"There's a big supply and de
mand problem in terms of the
number of organs available to
treat patients with heart trans
plants," said Robert Robbins, di
rector of the CVI and co-princi
pal investigator.
Robbins added that drug com
plications and organ rejection
pose other potential problems
with the heart transplant
method.
The CVI is one of seven car
diovascular centers around the
nation collectively identified
as the Cardiovascular Cell Thera
py Research Network granted
over $6O million by the National
Heart, Lung & Blood Institute
(NHLBI) to perform the clinical

trials. The other six centers are lo
cated at the University of Flori
da, the University of Louisville,
Indiana University, the Universi
ty of Miami, the Minneapolis
Heart Institute and the Texas
Heart Institute.
While similar multi-center
studies have been conducted in
Europe, this particular clinical
trial will be the first of its kind in
the United States and is the first
such trial to be funded by the
NHLBI.
"Many of the stem cell studies
that have been done to date have
not been well controlled; they've
been exploratory," Cooke said.
He estimated that adult stem cell
therapy will be available to car
diovascular patients within the
next five years.
While $3.8 million of the grant
has already been issued to Stan
ford, the remaining funds an
estimated $1.5 million will be
distributed when needed to cover
patient and laboratory costs.
