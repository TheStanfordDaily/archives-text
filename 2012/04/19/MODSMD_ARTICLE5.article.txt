# SLE officials downplay SUES effect
## Chappell Lougee emphasizes SLE's distinct nature, value 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN STAFF WRITER 
Despite concerns about impact from the Faculty
Senate's recent decision to substantially reduce fresh
man requirements, officials expect little immediate
change in Structured Liberal Education (SLE) pro
gramming.
"Very little will change in the content of the pro
gram," emphasized Professor Carolyn Chappell
Lougee, director of SLE.
Starting next year, the program unit count will be
reduced from nine units in the fall and winter quarters
and ten units in the spring quarter to eight units each
quarter. Otherwise, despite faculty concerns that re
duced requirements for non-SLE students would di
minish the appeal of SLE, the program's current
model will be continued.
"We asked ourselves whether we should change
anything in the content of the year, and we just think
that it's running so beautifully," Chappell Lougee said.
"We don't want to change anything preemptively. We
really do have a lot of confidence that this is going to
continue to be attractive to incoming students. We'll
see if our confidence is borne out."
In Faculty Senate discussion and in speaking with
The Daily, Chappell Lougee expressed adamant oppo
sition to the decision to remove a freshman seminar re
quirement, arguing that the further-diminished re
quirements would constitute an inadequate introduc
tion to university-level education.
"One of the things that the yearlong freshman hu
manities requirement has done for more than 30 years
... is focus on skills development for the freshmen and
prepare them to go on to more advanced work," Chap
pell Lougee said. "That simply can't be done at the
same level in one course. I think we're going to see our
students have a more difficult time coming up to uni
versity level."
However, Chappell Lougee argued that the dimin
ished requirements will ultimately increase the impor
tance of SLE within the University's pedagogical
structures.
"SLE is now the structured option in the freshman
year," Chappell Lougee said. "Stanford as an institu
tion is strengthened by offering both kinds of entry
structured and unstructured. I think it would be a real
problem for Stanford if we didn't have a SLE ... if it
were just all 'come and jump in with both feet and find
your own way, see if you can swim.'"
Lanier Anderson, chair of the Study on Undergrad
uate Education at Stanford (SUES) sub-committee on
the Freshman Year, called SLE a "more intense way of
fulfilling" freshman requirements, but expressed con
cern about the future of SLE with the reduced require
ments.
SLE is currently equivalent in units to all three
quarters of the Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) program, both quarters of the Program in
Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) and a humanities distri
bution requirement.
"That will no longer be true under the new Senate
