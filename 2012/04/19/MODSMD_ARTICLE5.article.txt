# SLE officials downplay SUES effect
## Chappell Lougee emphasizes SLE's distinct nature, value 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN STAFF WRITER 
Despite concerns about impact from the Faculty
Senate's recent decision to substantially reduce fresh
man requirements, officials expect little immediate
change in Structured Liberal Education (SLE) pro
gramming.
"Very little will change in the content of the pro
gram," emphasized Professor Carolyn Chappell
Lougee, director of SLE.
Starting next year, the program unit count will be
reduced from nine units in the fall and winter quarters
and ten units in the spring quarter to eight units each
quarter. Otherwise, despite faculty concerns that re
duced requirements for non-SLE students would di
minish the appeal of SLE, the program's current
model will be continued.
"We asked ourselves whether we should change
anything in the content of the year, and we just think
that it's running so beautifully," Chappell Lougee said.
"We don't want to change anything preemptively. We
really do have a lot of confidence that this is going to
continue to be attractive to incoming students. We'll
see if our confidence is borne out."
In Faculty Senate discussion and in speaking with
The Daily, Chappell Lougee expressed adamant oppo
sition to the decision to remove a freshman seminar re
quirement, arguing that the further-diminished re
quirements would constitute an inadequate introduc
tion to university-level education.
"One of the things that the yearlong freshman hu
manities requirement has done for more than 30 years
... is focus on skills development for the freshmen and
prepare them to go on to more advanced work," Chap
pell Lougee said. "That simply can't be done at the
same level in one course. I think we're going to see our
students have a more difficult time coming up to uni
versity level."
However, Chappell Lougee argued that the dimin
ished requirements will ultimately increase the impor
tance of SLE within the University's pedagogical
structures.
"SLE is now the structured option in the freshman
year," Chappell Lougee said. "Stanford as an institu
tion is strengthened by offering both kinds of entry
structured and unstructured. I think it would be a real
problem for Stanford if we didn't have a SLE ... if it
were just all 'come and jump in with both feet and find
your own way, see if you can swim.'"
Lanier Anderson, chair of the Study on Undergrad
uate Education at Stanford (SUES) sub-committee on
the Freshman Year, called SLE a "more intense way of
fulfilling" freshman requirements, but expressed con
cern about the future of SLE with the reduced require
ments.
SLE is currently equivalent in units to all three
quarters of the Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) program, both quarters of the Program in
Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) and a humanities distri
bution requirement.
"That will no longer be true under the new Senate
decision about the requirements," Anderson said. "It
wouldn't have been true even under what we pro
posed with SUES. A lot of the curricular economic
effects of the new system will depend on what
breadth requirements pass the Senate and how those
interact with SLE."
"I think it will inevitably be true [that] in the new
environment, SLE will be more of an extra invest
ment," Anderson added. "It was our bet on the com
mittee that this wouldn't really damage SLE as a pro
gram because we thought that the population going
into SLE was looking to make an extra investment,
and wouldn't be dissuaded by the fact that it was a lit
tle more extra."
Anderson noted that the further reduced require
ments would mean an even wider gap in the invest
ment required by SLE students, something he called
an "unfortunate side effect."
Overall, however, both Anderson and Chappell
Lougee expressed optimism about SLE's future,
with Anderson noting that SLE functioned effective
ly in the past even in the absence of any freshman re
quirement at all.
"The SUES process revealed there are a lot of
faculty members who are committed to the idea of
dedicated freshman education, and I think that those
faculty members will be encouraged to keep con
tributing to programs like SLE by the fact that the
Senate approved a less robust general requirement
than SUES originally proposed," Anderson said.
Anderson added that the institutional support for
the SLE program continues to be strong.
"We were excited about SLE as a model," Ander
son said. "Some members of the committee were
cautious about whether we could preserve what's
great about SLE while scaling it up to the entire
freshman class, although there was temptation to re
place freshman learning with something like SLE.
Because these people were cautious, the recommen
dation was that Stanford could, and we should, ex
pand the residential part of the SLE model in a little
bit of a piece-meal way."
"The SUES committee ... suggested the creation

of additional 'integrated learning environments'
(ILEs) for freshmen on different themes," wrote
Sharon Palmer '9O, associate vice provost for under
graduate education, in an email to The Daily. "These
would not be a universal structure for all freshmen,
but rather additional options for entering students.
Like SLE, such programs would likely fulfill multi
ple general education requirements."
Chappell Lougee noted that before the SUES re
port was released, two new programs were already
being crafted for introduction in fall 2013.
"One of them will be the World on Art, which is
an arts-rich program, located in the dorm.The other
is going to be Cultures of Knowledge, so it's going to
be a kind of history of science, a crossover between
humanities and sciences," Chappell Lougee said.
"Both of those are going to be very exciting."

bit of a piece-meal way."
"The SUES committee ... suggested the creation

of additional 'integrated learning environments'
(ILEs) for freshmen on different themes," wrote
Sharon Palmer '9O, associate vice provost for under
graduate education, in an email to The Daily. "These
would not be a universal structure for all freshmen,
but rather additional options for entering students.
Like SLE, such programs would likely fulfill multi
ple general education requirements."
Chappell Lougee noted that before the SUES re
port was released, two new programs were already
being crafted for introduction in fall 2013.
"One of them will be the World on Art, which is
an arts-rich program, located in the dorm.The other
is going to be Cultures of Knowledge, so it's going to
be a kind of history of science, a crossover between
humanities and sciences," Chappell Lougee said.
"Both of those are going to be very exciting."

Despite concerns about impact from the Faculty
Senate's recent decision to substantially reduce fresh
man requirements, officials expect little immediate
change in Structured Liberal Education (SLE) pro
gramming.
"Very little will change in the content of the pro
gram," emphasized Professor Carolyn Chappell
Lougee, director of SLE.
Starting next year, the program unit count will be
reduced from nine units in the fall and winter quarters
and ten units in the spring quarter to eight units each
quarter. Otherwise, despite faculty concerns that re
duced requirements for non-SLE students would di
minish the appeal of SLE, the program's current
model will be continued.
"We asked ourselves whether we should change
anything in the content of the year, and we just think
that it's running so beautifully," Chappell Lougee said.
"We don't want to change anything preemptively. We
really do have a lot of confidence that this is going to
continue to be attractive to incoming students. We'll
see if our confidence is borne out."
In Faculty Senate discussion and in speaking with
The Daily, Chappell Lougee expressed adamant oppo
sition to the decision to remove a freshman seminar re
quirement, arguing that the further-diminished re
quirements would constitute an inadequate introduc
tion to university-level education.
"One of the things that the yearlong freshman hu
manities requirement has done for more than 30 years
... is focus on skills development for the freshmen and
prepare them to go on to more advanced work," Chap
pell Lougee said. "That simply can't be done at the
same level in one course. I think we're going to see our
students have a more difficult time coming up to uni
versity level."
However, Chappell Lougee argued that the dimin
ished requirements will ultimately increase the impor
tance of SLE within the University's pedagogical
structures.
"SLE is now the structured option in the freshman
year," Chappell Lougee said. "Stanford as an institu
tion is strengthened by offering both kinds of entry
structured and unstructured. I think it would be a real
problem for Stanford if we didn't have a SLE ... if it
were just all 'come and jump in with both feet and find
your own way, see if you can swim.'"
Lanier Anderson, chair of the Study on Undergrad
uate Education at Stanford (SUES) sub-committee on
the Freshman Year, called SLE a "more intense way of
fulfilling" freshman requirements, but expressed con
cern about the future of SLE with the reduced require
ments.
SLE is currently equivalent in units to all three
quarters of the Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) program, both quarters of the Program in
Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) and a humanities distri
bution requirement.
"That will no longer be true under the new Senate
decision about the requirements," Anderson said. "It
wouldn't have been true even under what we pro
posed with SUES. A lot of the curricular economic
effects of the new system will depend on what
breadth requirements pass the Senate and how those
interact with SLE."
"I think it will inevitably be true [that] in the new
environment, SLE will be more of an extra invest
ment," Anderson added. "It was our bet on the com
mittee that this wouldn't really damage SLE as a pro
gram because we thought that the population going
into SLE was looking to make an extra investment,
and wouldn't be dissuaded by the fact that it was a lit
tle more extra."
Anderson noted that the further reduced require
ments would mean an even wider gap in the invest
ment required by SLE students, something he called
an "unfortunate side effect."
Overall, however, both Anderson and Chappell
Lougee expressed optimism about SLE's future,
with Anderson noting that SLE functioned effective
ly in the past even in the absence of any freshman re
quirement at all.
"The SUES process revealed there are a lot of
faculty members who are committed to the idea of
dedicated freshman education, and I think that those
faculty members will be encouraged to keep con
tributing to programs like SLE by the fact that the
Senate approved a less robust general requirement
than SUES originally proposed," Anderson said.
Anderson added that the institutional support for
the SLE program continues to be strong.
"We were excited about SLE as a model," Ander
son said. "Some members of the committee were
cautious about whether we could preserve what's
great about SLE while scaling it up to the entire
freshman class, although there was temptation to re
place freshman learning with something like SLE.
Because these people were cautious, the recommen
dation was that Stanford could, and we should, ex
pand the residential part of the SLE model in a little
bit of a piece-meal way."

of additional 'integrated learning environments'
