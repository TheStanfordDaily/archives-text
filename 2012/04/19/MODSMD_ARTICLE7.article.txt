## Science pre-orientation to prepare frosh 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Building on the successes of other
summer bridge programs, such as the
Stanford Summer Engineering Acade
my and Stanford Pre-Orientation Trips,
starting in fall 2012 Stanford's Leland
Scholars Program (LSP) will offer a
three-week, residential program for in
coming science-oriented freshmen from
under-resourced backgrounds.
Through the initiative, created by the
Office of the Vice Provost of Under
graduate Education (VPUE) as a three
year pilot program, 35 students along
with seven residential staff will spend
three weeks on-campus in August while
enrolled in a two-credit science course.
LSP students will also have access to ad
ditional advising and exclusive seminars
throughout the academic year.
Warren Chiang, director of the Le
land Scholars Program, said that the
program's focus on science-oriented
students reflects the demanding nature
and pace of first-year coursework, which
can make the transition to university
level thinking in those subjects more de
manding and decrease retention rates

among freshmen.
"We hope that by giving students a
'taste' of the academic year experience,
they will be able to take advantage of
some aspect of the program that is most
useful for them," Chiang wrote in an
email to The Daily.
Chiang added that in addition to aca
demic coursework and advising, the LSP
offers assistance for incoming students
through "fostering community among
the Scholars, familiarizing students with
pertinent campus resources and helping
students feel prepared and excited for
their freshman year."
The program, which was developed
in partnership with the University's
chemistry department, will employ Jen
nifer Schwartz, a chemistry professor, as
the faculty instructor and curriculum de
signer.
Peer institutions such as Prince
ton University and the University of
California at Berkeley have been of
fering similar programs to incoming stu
dents for a number of years. Chiang said
extensive collaboration and discussion
with those schools shaped LSP's agenda.
"The critical components of these
programs are similar residential ex

periences, rigorous academic work and
building a community of scholars," Chi
ang wrote. "These are all aspects that
have been shown to produce positive re
sults for students."
The program was first proposed in
2008, but the initiative was delayed until
this upcoming academic year due to un
favorable economic conditions and re
sulting budget cuts. LSP's intro
duction coincides with concerns ex
pressed by faculty over the recent reduc
tion in freshman year academic require
ments, decreased from three quarters to
one. Some faculty have argued that re
ducing first-year requirements will rob
students of an adequate introduction to
university-level education.
Martha Cyert, senior associate vice
provost of undergraduate education,
dismissed the timing as purely coinci
dental, attributing the program's cre
ation instead to the University's im
proved fiscal situation. She added, how
ever, that the VPUE plans to increase
outreach efforts to freshmen in response
to the reduction in requirements.
"The increased choice for students in
