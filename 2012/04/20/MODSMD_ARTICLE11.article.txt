## EDITORIAL Let faculty act freely outside the classroom

This editorial is the first of a two
part series on faculty involvement
in political advocacy.

members to voice controversial
viewpoints, both inside and out
side the classroom. To argue for
the restriction of these viewpoints
to the pages of a journal or con
fines of a lecture hall both under
mines the purpose of tenured ac
ademic positions and forces the
faculty member to undergo an
unfair schism between their pri
vately-held political and social
values and what they are allowed
to publicly express. Though some
faculty members, for personal or
professional reasons, may choose
to undergo such a schism, it is un
fair to expect each and every fac
ulty member to do so.
In addition to being unfair, it is
also undesirable to restrict social
and political activism by faculty
members on campus. In many
cases, Stanford faculty members
add valuable opinions and experi
ence. For example, a professor's
student involvement in Vietnam
War activism, or military experi
ence in the Gulf War, may inform
his or her present position on es
calating tension in Iran or with
drawal from Afghanistan. Al
though some students may be
afraid to engage with a faculty
member who expresses an oppos
ing perspective, others openly
embrace the challenge. If profes
sors who make public their politi
cal views welcome and respect
dissent in the classroom, students
would only hurt themselves by
suppressing their views; intellec
tual challenge, especially with
highly educated faculty, can serve
to strengthen or add necessary
nuance to one's own beliefs.

Whether desirable or
not, politics can play a
large role in the Uni
versity setting. Inside the class
room, professors often make their
ideological leanings quite clear,
whether through political jokes or
relatively one-sided curricula.
And outside the classroom, many
professors write politicized pieces
for media outlets and/or ally
themselves with partisan campus
movements. These two environ
ments for political activism are
distinct, and actions acceptable in
one setting may not be acceptable
in another. In this first editorial,
we will advance our notion of how
professors at Stanford should act
in regards to social and political
activism outside the classroom.

Faculty members, in this ex
ternal setting, are free citizens
and thus granted First Amend
ment protection. But although
they can participate in political
advocacy, should they? On one
side are those who are critical of
any faculty participation in social
or political initiatives. Many view
a faculty member's job as some
thing to be restricted to lecture
halls, journal pages or office
hours. The faculty member's role
is not to add her voice, experi
ence or insight into the incendi
ary pot of campus political bat
tles. Critics of faculty engage
ment also argue that students
may become more apprehensive
about expressing views that go
against the public proclamations
of a respected faculty member.
By this logic, the professor's ac
tions in the public sphere have
consequences on the classroom
environment. These critics argue
that as a result, faculty members
should retreat from the prover
bial public sphere and focus on re
search and teaching rather than
advocacy or engagement with so
cial and political issues.
This Board argues that this
view is unfair to faculty. Stanford
is a self-defined community of
scholars and students who each
possess an equal right to person
ally contribute to political and so
cial debates. In particular, educa
tional policymakers justify the ex
istence of tenure because of the
protection it affords to faculty

To argue that faculty members
should not add their voices to on
campus debates over these issues
risks cutting off a valuable source
of insight and plurality. Of course,
we expect faculty members to re
main respectful to opposing view
points regardless of their own
leanings. This is especially impor
tant for liberal professors, who
may not always be as cognizant of
the ramifications of their actions
due to our left-leaning student
body. We believe that allowing
and even encouraging faculty in
volvement in social and political
campus debates does not lead to
inhospitable classroom environ
ments but instead helps foster
lively, pluralistic dialogues on var
ious issues marked by a wide
array of campus contributors.

By this logic, the professor's ac

consequences on the classroom
environment. These critics argue
that as a result, faculty members
should retreat from the prover

search and teaching rather than
advocacy or engagement with so
cial and political issues.
This Board argues that this
view is unfair to faculty. Stanford
is a self-defined community of
scholars and students who each
possess an equal right to person

protection it affords to faculty

To argue that faculty members
should not add their voices to on
campus debates over these issues
risks cutting off a valuable source
of insight and plurality. Of course,
we expect faculty members to re

points regardless of their own
leanings. This is especially impor
tant for liberal professors, who
may not always be as cognizant of
the ramifications of their actions
due to our left-leaning student
body. We believe that allowing
and even encouraging faculty in

campus debates does not lead to
inhospitable classroom environ
ments but instead helps foster
lively, pluralistic dialogues on var
ious issues marked by a wide
array of campus contributors.

This editorial is the first of a two
part series on faculty involvement
in political advocacy.

members to voice controversial
viewpoints, both inside and out
side the classroom. To argue for
the restriction of these viewpoints
to the pages of a journal or con
fines of a lecture hall both under
mines the purpose of tenured ac
ademic positions and forces the
faculty member to undergo an
unfair schism between their pri
vately-held political and social
values and what they are allowed
to publicly express. Though some
faculty members, for personal or
professional reasons, may choose
to undergo such a schism, it is un
fair to expect each and every fac
ulty member to do so.
In addition to being unfair, it is
also undesirable to restrict social
and political activism by faculty
members on campus. In many
cases, Stanford faculty members
add valuable opinions and experi
ence. For example, a professor's
student involvement in Vietnam
War activism, or military experi
ence in the Gulf War, may inform
his or her present position on es
calating tension in Iran or with
drawal from Afghanistan. Al
though some students may be
afraid to engage with a faculty
member who expresses an oppos
ing perspective, others openly
embrace the challenge. If profes
sors who make public their politi
cal views welcome and respect
dissent in the classroom, students
would only hurt themselves by
suppressing their views; intellec
tual challenge, especially with
highly educated faculty, can serve
to strengthen or add necessary
nuance to one's own beliefs.

Whether desirable or
not, politics can play a
large role in the Uni
versity setting. Inside the class
room, professors often make their
ideological leanings quite clear,
whether through political jokes or
relatively one-sided curricula.
And outside the classroom, many
professors write politicized pieces
for media outlets and/or ally
themselves with partisan campus
movements. These two environ
ments for political activism are
distinct, and actions acceptable in
one setting may not be acceptable
in another. In this first editorial,
we will advance our notion of how
professors at Stanford should act
in regards to social and political
activism outside the classroom.

Faculty members, in this ex
ternal setting, are free citizens
and thus granted First Amend
ment protection. But although
they can participate in political
advocacy, should they? On one
side are those who are critical of
any faculty participation in social
or political initiatives. Many view
a faculty member's job as some
thing to be restricted to lecture
halls, journal pages or office
hours. The faculty member's role
is not to add her voice, experi
ence or insight into the incendi
ary pot of campus political bat
tles. Critics of faculty engage
ment also argue that students
may become more apprehensive
about expressing views that go
against the public proclamations
of a respected faculty member.
