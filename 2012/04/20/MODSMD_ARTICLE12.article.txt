## Right to write? 
### Sebastain Gould 
I have been asked many times
what I will do with a major in
philosophy, often by Human
Biology majors. I tell them sin
cerely, be a philosopher, and they
say no, what will your job be? So
then I tell them I will write. I am
going to write in some way or an
other, and help change the minds
of others for the better. I will bring
knowledge and experiences to
those who could not have them
otherwise.

Well and grand, they reply, but
what if it doesn't work out? I re
flect for a moment and consider.
I'll do something else, I suppose. I
then pose the same question to
them. There are so few med
school spots and so many Human
Biology majors. What will you do
if you don't get in? Invariably they
reply that they will get in, full of
the confidence that one attains
when they are pursuing a "real"
job.

What follows then is a defense
of my intended profession, sup
plemented by a conversational in
terview with Kirstin Quade, a fic
tion writer who lectures here at
Stanford. Writing fiction enables
you to communicate in a variety
of ways that you would find much

harder if attempted through other
means. You can give personality
to place and show the thought
processes of individuals. It is more
than painting a picture that simply
looks good, which is no easy task,
mind you. To do fiction well, the
characters must have reasonable
and rational attitudes and behav
iors, or at least have a reason for
lacking them. It is okay for the
world of fiction to have strange
and bizarre things happen be
cause it gives meaning to that
which it shows. Sometimes the
meaning that it tries to convey is
that the world itself has no mean
ing. Kirstin says that she reads be
cause "there is so much about the
world that she doesn't under
stand."

By giving fiction meaning,
writing gives life meaning. The in
explicable cruelty of circumstance
and unfortunate events can be
given meaning through literature

when the world provides none.
Putting meaning in life events en
courages a positive valuation of
life and an increase in the will to
live. How many among us have
you heard give great praise to a
book either in childhood or late
life, saying that it has brought
them to a greater understanding
of a situation or loved one, or in
ternal peace about an event in
their life? The frequency with
which literature helps those who
take the time to read it is proof
enough of its power and impor
tance in society. Kirstin believes
that "the practice of writing offers
us the possibility of becoming bet
ter people." She also thinks that

through engaging the conscious
nesses of others and their situa
tions, we can learn how we may
change,
I asked Kirstin what a person
should do if they feel they have
something to express about the
world. She told me to simply "find
work that moves you and then
read those books again and
again." Once a person under
stands what does work and what
does not work, they can then pro
duce something that does work.
In life we do the same thing; we
must constantly be aware of what
we are doing and how others
around us are acting. From them
we can learn what behaviors we

think are appropriate and which
ones aren't, and then be armed
with that knowledge in case we
ever find ourselves in a similar sit
uation. Reading and writing pre
pares you to live your own life.
I want to be a philosopher and
study the world and the people
around me. I want to learn what I
can about them so that I can learn
about my own nature and behav
ior. I will then share my love of
knowledge with others through
writing, so that they too may be
come philosophers.

Do you want to be a philosopher,
too? Let Sebastain know at sj
