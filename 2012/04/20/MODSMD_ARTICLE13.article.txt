## To sleep, perchance to leave 
### Miriam Marks 
After a long day of work,
school or vigorous shop
ping, you've reached that
point in the evening when the one
and only thought on your mind is
your bed. Ah, to be in your
smooth and silky sheets! You fan
tasize about your fluffy down
comforter. You find that a smile
springs unbidden to your lips
when your thoughts drift to your
pillow. Outwardly you scoff that
sleep is for the weak, but inwardly
you rejoice at the idea.
Unfortunately, standing in be
tween you and bed is some kind of
engagement: a dinner gathering, a
coffee date, a raging party. And be
cause plans were made weeks ago,
because you probably couldn't go
to bed at 8 p.m. in good conscience
anyway, you try as hard as you can
to psych yourself up for whatever
the occasion is, even as you men
tally pick out your PJs for later.
You put on a good face. But
after an hour, or two, or even
three, when you're yawning just
about every three minutes, you
know you have to call an end to
things.
But how? The thing is, no one
likes to be the tired person, the
"party-pooper," the self-avowed
"old person" who prefers to go
home and sleep instead of party
or otherwise stay awake. As a re
sult, choosing to take your leave
early can make you vulnerable to
questions, accusations and judg
mental looks.

"You're leaving already??"
shouts your friend as you sidle to
ward the door. But luckily, a large
gathering is so full of distractions
that people will forget about you
soon enough. You can leave, and
the party will go on unabated.
Or you'll face a particularly

stubborn friend. "But it's only 2
a.m.! We're getting ready to post
game!" As appealing as the
prospect is, and as much as you
want to gulp down a few more
drinks in preparation for the sun
rise, you really just want to sleep.
You're "lame" and a bunch of
other uncool adjectives, but you
leave anyway.

The one on one is harder be
cause if you leave, well, the other
person has to leave too. At the
same time, your fatigue is also
harder to hide if you're only with
one other person, one witness to
your sagging eyelids. As a result,
an unfortunate cycle ensues: You
struggle as hard as you can to be
awake and attentive, but your
friend is merely subjected to your
fatigue for a longer period of time.
You can only desperately hope
that this friend will take the hint
and exit first, sparing you the need
of having to comment on your de
sire to replace friend with bed.
And yet, sometimes you deal with
people who don't get the hint.
I spent last summer very much
alone in a foreign country, so
when the opportunity to have din
ner with a friend of a friend arose,
I jumped at the chance to explore
a city with human company. The
two of us walked, had dinner and
then walked some more. Four
hours later, I was still excited to be
out of my room; he, on the other
hand, finally had to take a stand.
"Hey, so I woke up at 5 a.m.
today for work, and I have to
wake up at 5 a.m. again tomorrow
... Can I take you back now?"

I felt terrible. He hadn't shown
signs of tremendous interest in
our conversation, but I had ig
nored this to satisfy my own de
sire to talk. Why hadn't I picked

up on his hints? As soon as he
asked the question, I noticed just
how tired he really did look.
Whether he actually was tired or
just supremely bored of my com
pany, I appreciated his bluntness.
And that's why, rather than
leading on your energetic and ex
uberant friends, go ahead and tell
them that you're tired. You're
only human, after all, and subject
ing them to your fatigue might not
be their idea of a great time.
At the same time, it's hard to
feel like you're kicking them out
because of something trivial like
the fact that your body needs to
rest. When I was a kid, my parents
had a ready and easy excuse when
it came time to call a halt to a so
cial gathering. Whether it was
time to kick people out of our
house or to politely extricate our
selves from another home, there
was nothing quite like a five-year
old to provide a host of reasons
for departure.
"Oh, look, it's 9 p.m.! It's past
her bedtime." You can't argue with
that one. Perhaps if we all had our
own five-year-old children in tow,
life would be a bit easier. Putting
your toddler to bed is a guaran
teed exit strategy. But for now
we'll have to go ahead and admit
when we'd rather be sleeping.

Miriam will answer any emails sent

only if she hasn't gone to bed al
ready.
