For the No. 10 Stanford base
ball team, the best pitching squad
in the conference couldn't be
coming to Sunken Diamond at a
worse time.

Hitting just .168 over the past
week, the Cardinal (22-10, 5-7
Pac-12) will need to turn things
around quickly if it wants to stay
competitive against Arizona
State (24-13, 9-6), which did not
receive votes in the coaches poll
due to NCAA sanctions, but was
ranked No. 20 by Baseball Amer
ica this week. The Sun Devils
have allowed five runs just twice
in their ten games in April, mak
ing for a 2.57 ERA on the season
that ranked third in the country
as of Monday.
As a result, Stanford will be
hard-pressed to raise its sinking
batting averages this weekend.

Junior outfielder Tyler Gaffney is
hitless in his past three games in
the leadoff spot, unable to utilize
his prized speed on the basepaths.
Junior shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger is also hitless in his
past three, though his average re
mains at .305 after a strong start.
Diekroeger is one of just four
Cardinal hitters still above .300.
Arizona State, which ranks 71st in
batting average in the country,
has seven batters in that category.
A week after floundering
against Oregon's one-two pitch
ing punch of Alex Keudell and
Jake Reed, Stanford will have to
deal with a pair of stud starters
yet again. Righthander Brady
Rodgers (6-1) has put up an ob
scene 1.12 ERA his junior season,
with sophomore Saturday starter
Trevor Williams (7-2) not far be
hind at 1.41.

The Cardinal will be looking
to jump on Arizona State fresh

man Darin Gillies (1-3, 3.67) on
Sunday if it wants to end the se
ries on a strong note.

"Any time you lose the first
two even if you win the first
two that third game is always a
huge game," said junior reliever
Sahil Bloom before Stanford won
the series finale against Oregon
last weekend, having dropped the
first two contests.

The Cardinal will clearly need
improved play from its best jun
iors, not just against Arizona
State but also for the remainder
of the season. Third baseman
Stephen Piscotty's batting aver
age has fallen to a pedestrian
.301, while his .859 fielding per
centage is clearly a step in the
wrong direction for the preseason
All-American. Diekroeger will
also need a strong second half to
return to the Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year form he brought to the
table in 2010, as he moves back

from second base to shortstop in
the absence of sophomore Lon
nie Kauppila, who is out for the
rest of the season with a knee in
jury.

Junior catcher Eric Smith is
surprisingly still the team-leading
hitter at .345, and was recently
added to the watch list of the
Johnny Bench Award for college
baseball's top catcher.
"I just try and take every pitch
as its own and cherish every mo
ment that I have up there with
these guys," he told The Daily last
week. "I just look for a continual
goal I can [accomplish] at the
plate, whether it's moving a guy
up, getting a sac fly or trying to get
a hit."

Smith is tied for second on the
team with 10 doubles, and don't
be surprised if both squads come
up with some extra-base hits this
