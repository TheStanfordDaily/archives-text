# SETTING THE STAGE
## CARD BEGINS MPSF TOURNEY AS NO. 2 SEED 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Following an impressive three-set
sweep over then-No. 2 UCLA on Senior
Night last weekend, the Stanford men's
volleyball team will look to carry its
surging momentum further into the
postseason.

The victory against UCLA gave
Stanford its best conference record
since 1997, even better than the 2010
team that would eventually be crowned
national champion. But before the Car
dinal can think about the fast-ap
proaching NCAA tournament, it must
try to win the talent-filled MPSF con
ference tourney first.

The No. 3 Cardinal (20-6, 17-5
MPSF) is currently riding a five-match
winning streak, with four of those victo
ries coming against teams ranked in the
national top fifteen. In addition to de
molishing the Bruins, the Stanford
squad routed then-No. 8 Long Beach
State, held off resilient then-No. 12 Cal
State-Northridge and dominated then-
No. 13 Pacific.

Thanks to a solid all-around group
effort that has helped the team win
seven out of its last nine games, Stan
ford is now sitting at the No. 2 seed for
the upcoming MPSF tournament. The
high seed is crucial for the Cardinal as it
will have home-court advantage
throughout the tourney against every
team except for No. 1 seed USC, which
