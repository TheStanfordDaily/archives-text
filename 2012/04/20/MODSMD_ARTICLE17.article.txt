# SETTING THE STAGE
## CARD BEGINS MPSF TOURNEY AS NO. 2 SEED 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Following an impressive three-set
sweep over then-No. 2 UCLA on Senior
Night last weekend, the Stanford men's
volleyball team will look to carry its
surging momentum further into the
postseason.

The victory against UCLA gave
Stanford its best conference record
since 1997, even better than the 2010
team that would eventually be crowned
national champion. But before the Car
dinal can think about the fast-ap
proaching NCAA tournament, it must
try to win the talent-filled MPSF con
ference tourney first.

The No. 3 Cardinal (20-6, 17-5
MPSF) is currently riding a five-match
winning streak, with four of those victo
ries coming against teams ranked in the
national top fifteen. In addition to de
molishing the Bruins, the Stanford
squad routed then-No. 8 Long Beach
State, held off resilient then-No. 12 Cal
State-Northridge and dominated then-
No. 13 Pacific.

Thanks to a solid all-around group
effort that has helped the team win
seven out of its last nine games, Stan
ford is now sitting at the No. 2 seed for
the upcoming MPSF tournament. The
high seed is crucial for the Cardinal as it
will have home-court advantage
throughout the tourney against every
team except for No. 1 seed USC, which

won the MPSF regular season
title with an 18-4 conference
record and is also currently the
No. 1 team in the nation.
The first test for the Stanford
crew will be No. 7 seed Pepper
dine. The Cardinal beat the
Waves in both of the two match
es that the teams played against
each other during the regular
season. The first victory came in
late February, when the Cardinal
handled the Waves 3-1 at home.
The second match was much
closer, with Stanford squeaking

out a 3-2 win in Malibu, Calif.
A huge contributor to both of
Stanford's wins against Pepper
dine was senior outside hitter
Brad Lawson, who tallied a total
of 33 kills in the two games. The
two-time All-American and Na
tional Player of the Year candi
date will most likely have to
come up big once again if Stan
ford wants to keep Pepperdine
out of striking distance through
out the match. Just yesterday,
Lawson was named to the All-
MPSF First Team, along with
senior teammate Erik Shoji, who
is arguably the best libero in col
legiate volleyball history.
Lawson and Shoji aren't the
only players who are playing ex
ceptionally well going into the

postseason. Sophomore Brian
Cook, also an outside hitter, was
instrumental in the Cardinal's suc
cess against UCLA on Senior
Night. In addition to blocking
eight shots, Cook had 12 kills and
five digs that contributed to the
team's 0.397 hitting percentage.
Senior setter Evan Barry will also
be commanding a considerable
amount of attention from the
Waves. The national leader in as
sists dished out an absurd 40 assists
in the team's win over UCLA.
The No. 2 Cardinal will host
the first round of the MPSF tour
nament against No. 7 Pepperdine
at 7 p.m. on Saturday.
