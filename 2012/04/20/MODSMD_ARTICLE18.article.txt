# Violence growing in the NHL
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
With the NFL still
reeling from the
scandal of the
New Orleans
Saints' bounty
program, another sport is con
fronting violence concerns as well:
hockey.
Eleven players were ejected
over the course of first week of the
NHL postseason compared to
six during the entire playoffs a year
ago and several have been sus
pended by league disciplinarian
Brendan Shanahan in an attempt to
keep hockey from fully turning into
"Fight Club on Ice." But the Stanley
Cup Playoffs have resembled just
that in the early going, and a sport
that has been deeply questioning
the role of fighting ever since the
death of former enforcer Derek
Boogaard at the age of 28 last sum
mer now finds itself mired in one of
the roughest postseasons in recent
memory.

Rough stuff has its place in the
NHL, for sure. A good hockey
check is a lot like a tackle in foot
ball; though it doesn't stop the
play (as on the gridiron), it sepa
rates an attacker from the puck
and can effectively stop an offen
sive rush. Laying your jaw on the
line by provoking a fight, more
over, can get your team going if it's
lacking energy.

But there's also a culture of stick
ing up for yourself and your team
mates after a questionable check by
an opponent even in an earlier
game which is where a lot of the
fisticuffs and particularly dirty hits
emerge in an extended series.
With the intensity ramped up
even further for a parity-filled post
season, the casualties have been
racking up quickly. Ottawa veteran
Daniel Alfredsson has now missed
two games with a concussion since a
dirty elbow by the New York
Rangers' Carl Hagelin. Philadel
phia's Brayden Schenn has also
been out after a retaliatory cross
check to the neck by Pittsburgh's
Arron Asham in the first period of a
Flyers blowout. San Jose almost lost
its third-line center in Dominic
Moore on a sucker-punch by
Vladimir Sobotka late in Game 2 in
St. Louis, but Moore returned just
two days later and played through a
broken nose in Game 3.

The most flagrant hit of all was
by a repeat offender, Phoenix's
Raffi Torres, who has been suspend
ed indefinitely after an open-ice
check to the head of Chicago's Mar
ian Hossa. Hossa left the ice on a
stretcher; Torres didn't leave the ice
at all. The play probably deserved a
five-minute major and a game mis
conduct, but no penalty was called.
Twenty thousand fans at the
Wells Fargo Center saw Torres leave
his feet to deliver the blow, as did
most of the players on the ice and
both benches. But none of the four
officials on the ice made the call.

To prevent injuries like Hossa's,
the best thing the NHL can do isn't
to rewrite the rulebook or dole out
longer suspensions. The first priority
should be to promote better officiat
ing.

On a do-or-die stage in the post
season, players are always living in
the heat of the moment.They're not
focused on the next series, next
game, next period or even next shift;
it's all about the here and now. A
two-minute penalty can be just as
much of a deterrent as a two-game
suspension, and when those penal
ties go uncalled players have no in
stant incentive to keep their intensi
ty in check.
The problem isn't that there are
too few officials, but that those offi
cials are being spread too thinly. Be
sides skating at game speed and
keeping out of the way of the puck,
the two referees have a litany of
penalties to watch for, while the two
linesmen who can tell the refs to
call a penalty after the whistle if a
player is injured have to make
split-second calls every time a play
er or the puck crosses one of the
rink's many lines. With seemingly
arbitrary rules and lines, such as the
trapezoid behind the net, being
added every few years, officials only
have more things to watch and their
focus is diverted from the plays that
cause injuries.

If the NHL is really worried
about cleaning up the game it
should cut the fat out of the rule
book, not for the players and fans,
but for the officials. The hit on Hossa
was illegal without question, and if
the refs didn't see it then they
weren't watching the game careful
ly enough.
As a whole, NHL refs do an in
credible j ob of keeping up with such
a fast-paced game, as most of the
players that have been suspended

in the playoffs also received in
game penalties. But when gaping
holes like Torres's uncalled hit
emerge, you've got to plug them.

Joseph Beyda hopes that the more
hockey columns he writes, the more
likely that the San Jose Sharks can
somehow stay alive in the playoffs.

been out after a retaliatory cross
check to the neck by Pittsburgh's
Arron Asham in the first period of a
Flyers blowout. San Jose almost lost
its third-line center in Dominic
Moore on a sucker-punch by
Vladimir Sobotka late in Game 2 in
St. Louis, but Moore returned just
two days later and played through a
broken nose in Game 3.

The most flagrant hit of all was
by a repeat offender, Phoenix's
Raffi Torres, who has been suspend
ed indefinitely after an open-ice
check to the head of Chicago's Mar
ian Hossa. Hossa left the ice on a
stretcher; Torres didn't leave the ice
at all. The play probably deserved a
five-minute major and a game mis
conduct, but no penalty was called.
Twenty thousand fans at the
Wells Fargo Center saw Torres leave
his feet to deliver the blow, as did
most of the players on the ice and
both benches. But none of the four
officials on the ice made the call.

To prevent injuries like Hossa's,
the best thing the NHL can do isn't
to rewrite the rulebook or dole out
longer suspensions. The first priority
should be to promote better officiat
ing.

On a do-or-die stage in the post
season, players are always living in
the heat of the moment.They're not
focused on the next series, next
game, next period or even next shift;
it's all about the here and now. A
two-minute penalty can be just as
much of a deterrent as a two-game
suspension, and when those penal
ties go uncalled players have no in
stant incentive to keep their intensi
ty in check.
The problem isn't that there are
too few officials, but that those offi
cials are being spread too thinly. Be
sides skating at game speed and
keeping out of the way of the puck,
the two referees have a litany of
penalties to watch for, while the two
linesmen who can tell the refs to
call a penalty after the whistle if a
player is injured have to make
split-second calls every time a play
er or the puck crosses one of the
rink's many lines. With seemingly
arbitrary rules and lines, such as the
trapezoid behind the net, being
added every few years, officials only
have more things to watch and their
focus is diverted from the plays that
cause injuries.

If the NHL is really worried
about cleaning up the game it
should cut the fat out of the rule
book, not for the players and fans,
but for the officials. The hit on Hossa
was illegal without question, and if
the refs didn't see it then they
weren't watching the game careful
ly enough.
As a whole, NHL refs do an in
credible j ob of keeping up with such
a fast-paced game, as most of the
players that have been suspended

in the playoffs also received in
game penalties. But when gaping
holes like Torres's uncalled hit
emerge, you've got to plug them.

Joseph Beyda hopes that the more
hockey columns he writes, the more
likely that the San Jose Sharks can
somehow stay alive in the playoffs.

With the NFL still
reeling from the
scandal of the
New Orleans
Saints' bounty
program, another sport is con
fronting violence concerns as well:
hockey.
Eleven players were ejected
over the course of first week of the
NHL postseason compared to
six during the entire playoffs a year
ago and several have been sus
pended by league disciplinarian
Brendan Shanahan in an attempt to
keep hockey from fully turning into
"Fight Club on Ice." But the Stanley
Cup Playoffs have resembled just
that in the early going, and a sport
that has been deeply questioning
the role of fighting ever since the
death of former enforcer Derek
Boogaard at the age of 28 last sum
mer now finds itself mired in one of
the roughest postseasons in recent
memory.

Rough stuff has its place in the
NHL, for sure. A good hockey
check is a lot like a tackle in foot
ball; though it doesn't stop the
play (as on the gridiron), it sepa
rates an attacker from the puck
and can effectively stop an offen
sive rush. Laying your jaw on the
line by provoking a fight, more
over, can get your team going if it's
lacking energy.

But there's also a culture of stick
ing up for yourself and your team
mates after a questionable check by
an opponent even in an earlier
game which is where a lot of the
fisticuffs and particularly dirty hits
emerge in an extended series.
With the intensity ramped up
even further for a parity-filled post
season, the casualties have been
racking up quickly. Ottawa veteran
Daniel Alfredsson has now missed
two games with a concussion since a
dirty elbow by the New York
Rangers' Carl Hagelin. Philadel
phia's Brayden Schenn has also
been out after a retaliatory cross
check to the neck by Pittsburgh's
Arron Asham in the first period of a
Flyers blowout. San Jose almost lost
its third-line center in Dominic
Moore on a sucker-punch by
