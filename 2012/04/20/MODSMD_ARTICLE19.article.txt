# Card faces one last test
## 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis
team will close out its regular sea
son with a hugely important con
ference rematch against cross-bay
rival California this weekend.

The first matchup, which No. 5
Stanford (16-1,7-1 Pac-12) won 5-
2 in early March, did not count to
ward Pac-12 standings. With the
conference title race completely
up in the air after UCLA beat
Stanford last weekend, No. 10 Cal
(17-5, 8-1 Pac-12) will have the
chance to avenge its loss and cap
ture its own piece of the Pac-12
title.

Junior Mallory Burdette, who
has accumulated a 30-4 overall
record at the No. 2 spot and is rid
ing a 16-match singles winning
streak, described the Cardinal's
sentiment entering this week after
its loss to the Bruins last weekend.
"I think the loss helps to reen

ergize everybody," said Burdette.
"We sat down after the match and
talked about what we wanted to
change in order to improve, and I
think it's a good time to refocus
before our last match of the sea
son."

The last time these two top-10
teams played, Stanford captured
the doubles point with wins on all
three courts. Burdette acknowl
edged that No. 6 nationally
ranked Jana Juricova, who cap
tured the NCAA singles title last
May, was absent from the lineup
in March but will be a formidable
force this weekend in both singles
and doubles. She will most likely
appear alongside freshman Zsofi
Susanyi, across the net from Stan
ford's top duo of Burdette and
No. 4 nationally ranked sopho
more Nicole Gibbs. The top dou
bles pairings from both schools
together have a collective record
of 39-4.

" [Juricova] makes things tough

because if you leave the ball sit
ting, she will put it away," Bur
dette explained. "She's tall and
has a big serve. [Juricova and Su
sanyi] are both good at net and
have great volleys, but they're not
unbeatable."

In singles, Burdette and Gibbs
both captured victories in the first
meeting. Junior Stacey Tan lost
her singles match to Cal's Anett
Schutting, while sophomore
Kristie Ahn was defeated by
Annie Goransson. Freshman
Ellen Tsay defeated Cecilia Est
lander and senior captain Veroni
ca Li cleaned up with a win over
Alice Duranteau. However, there
is no guarantee that Stanford's
players will be facing the same Cal
players, as Burdette described the
unpredictability of Cal's lineup.
She does know, however, that
she'll most likely be facing Su
sanyi on Court 2, whom Gibbs de
feated last time.

"I've never played her before
and I'm looking forward to it,"
said Burdette. "She hits a nice ball
that is more in my strike zone.
Last time I played Tayler Davis,
who is much more scrappy and
doesn't hit the balls as cleanly,
which made it more difficult for
me to take advantage of the low
ball."

No matter what will be thrown
at the Cardinal players, they plan
on being ready.
"We created a plan after last
weekend to help us concentrate
this week," Burdette described.
"For example, on Monday we
planned on doing more baseline
drills, working on hitting and
movement. Tuesday was going to
be set day, and Wednesday was all
about doubles.
Burdette mentioned that the
team even brought in her older
sister, Lindsay Burdette, as well as
former player Lilia Osterloh to
help push them, get that extra ball
back and assist with doubles prac
tice.

With the Pac-12 virtually tied,
both Stanford and Cal are look
ing for a victory this weekend to
gain at least a portion of the Pac
-12 title. If Stanford were to win, it
would need to also play Wash
ington State prior to the start of
the Pac-12 tournament as a
makeup for a previously rained
out contest.

"One of our first goals of the
season was to get the Pac-12 title,"
Burdette said. "We are definitely
going out there wanting to win,
but as long as people are moving
in the right direction and working
on the right things the bigger pic
ture will be okay."
The rematch, which will also
mark Senior Day as it is the final
matchup of the regular season,
will take place at the Taube Fami
ly Tennis Center at noon on Satur
day.
