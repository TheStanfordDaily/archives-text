## New campus sexual assault data revealed at symposium 
### SARAH EVANS 
Four percent of Stanford students re
ported having been raped, while seven
percent reported having been sexually
penetrated against their will and 15 per
cent reported engaging in intercourse
under pressure, according to preliminary
data from a survey of roughly 4,000 stu
dents conducted by Health Promotion
Services (HPS). Donnovan Yisrael 'BB,
M.A. 'B9, HPS manager of relationship
and sexual health programs, and Byrd
Bannick 'l3 presented the results of the

data to students at the Women's Commu
nity Center Thursday evening.
HPS introduced the data as part of
Thursday's "Symposium on Sexual As
sault" hosted by Stanford V-Week and the
Stanford Survivor's Group. Students and
administrators discussed University re
sponse to sexual assault and rape and ad
dressed the incidence rate of sexual crimes
on Stanford's campus. They also identified
a student culture that does not consistent
ly recognize penetration against one's will

or penetration under pressure
as rape.
HPS will formally release the
data in the coming weeks.
The symposium consisted of a
dozen students and five panelists
from the Office of Judicial Affairs,
the newly formed Office of Sexual
Assault and Relationship Abuse
(SARA),the Women's Communi
ty Center and the iThrive pro
gram.

Bannick and Yisrael noted that
nine percent of students, 13 per
cent of straight women, 28 percent
of students who identified as bi
sexual, gay or lesbian, 11 percent
of gay men, and 15 percent of peo
ple who refrained from marking
gender reported that they experi
enced attempted unwanted pene
tration.

Over 50 percent of those sur
veyed reported forcible fondling
or unwanted touching or kissing.
The survey also explored to
whom victims turn to for support:
66 percent went first to a female

friend, 29 percent turned to a male
friend, 28 percent talked to no
one, 19 percent called a parent and
12 percent reported the incident
to a resident assistant (RA).
The panel also spoke about the
"alternative review process" in
troduced two years ago. Jamie
Hogan, a student affairs officer in
the Office of Judicial Affairs, dis
cussed the change in policy and
noted a positive effect on the
number of completed cases.
"The number of cases that
have gone through a hearing has
increased dramatically," Hogan
said.
The biggest change from the
previous process, which included
simultaneous cross-examination
of the victim and the perpetrator
before a six-person panel, was a
change to the standard of proof,
Hogan said. Now, the panel is
asked to act on probable proof
rather than proof beyond a rea
sonable doubt.
Under the new process, Hogan
discusses the judicial process with
the victim and hears the victim's
report. She then sends the victim
her notes to fact check and con
firm the victim wants to move for
ward, she said.

Next, a panel of three students
and a faculty member review in
formation collected from other in
volved parties witnesses and
the alleged perpetrator before
optional individual meetings are
held with the victim and the al
leged perpetrator.
Finally, a verdict is made as to
whether or not a University policy
has been violated and the victim is
consulted before any disciplinary
action is taken. According to
Hogan, a standard punishment is
loss of housing and being asked to
leave the University for as long as
the impacted student is enrolled.
"The Sexual Violence Adviso
ry Board advised consideration of
expulsion, but the reviewers have
not done that," Hogan said. "They
have instead moved toward sus
pension while the victim is en
rolled."
Angela Exson, assistant dean of
SARA, noted that "statistics tell us
that [it is] a very small group of
men committing [sexual] crimes
many times."
"The average offender will
commit [sexual] crimes seven
times before any action is taken
against them," she said.

An audience member then

brought up her experience with a
friend who "didn't want the social
repercussions of getting [the ag
gressor] kicked out." The student
asked how best to respond to
friends looking for help.
"The operative word is options,
not advice," responded Exson.
"The most important thing is being
armed with the resources."
Several administrators ac
knowledged that it can be confus
ing for students to navigate all the
resources that are available for
victims of sexual assault and rela
tionship abuse in the immediacy
of responding to abuse or assault.
They cited the SARA office (650-
725-9129), the 24-hour Stanford
dedicated hotline (650-725-
9955), Vaden Health Center and
free and confidential sexual as
sault exams at the Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center in San
Jose.
Victims can choose to pursue
legal processes through Stan
ford's Office of Judicial Affairs,
through University police, or
both. Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services (CAPS), the WCC,
the Bridge and the LGBT-Com
munity Resources Center also
provide services to students

working through psychological
and emotional damage caused by
sexual assault.

Student comments at the sym
posium centered around the no
tion that students control the key
variable of culture in dealing with
sexual assault and relationship
abuse on campus.

"I think there could have been
more discussion about communi
ty-based responses and changing
the culture," said Viviana Arcia
'l3, about the event.
Arcia, vice-president of Stan
ford V-Week and co-founder of
the Stanford Survivor's Group,
elaborated on a culture of victim
blaming.
"Campus culture has a lot of
victim-blaming attitudes," she
said. "For example, I have a lot of
problems with how the Stanford
police portray perpetrators as
strange men of color popping out
of bushes and respond by asking
me not to walk at night. I think
there are ways the police, for ex
ample, could educate themselves
and not always rely on victims to
stay safe,"

percent reported having been sexually
penetrated against their will and 15 per
cent reported engaging in intercourse
under pressure, according to preliminary
data from a survey of roughly 4,000 stu
dents conducted by Health Promotion
Services (HPS). Donnovan Yisrael 'BB,
M.A. 'B9, HPS manager of relationship
and sexual health programs, and Byrd
Bannick 'l3 presented the results of the

data to students at the Women's Commu
nity Center Thursday evening.
HPS introduced the data as part of
Thursday's "Symposium on Sexual As
sault" hosted by Stanford V-Week and the
Stanford Survivor's Group. Students and
administrators discussed University re
sponse to sexual assault and rape and ad
dressed the incidence rate of sexual crimes
on Stanford's campus. They also identified
a student culture that does not consistent
ly recognize penetration against one's will

or penetration under pressure
as rape.
HPS will formally release the
data in the coming weeks.
The symposium consisted of a
dozen students and five panelists
from the Office of Judicial Affairs,
the newly formed Office of Sexual
Assault and Relationship Abuse
(SARA),the Women's Communi
ty Center and the iThrive pro
gram.

Bannick and Yisrael noted that
nine percent of students, 13 per
cent of straight women, 28 percent
of students who identified as bi
sexual, gay or lesbian, 11 percent
of gay men, and 15 percent of peo
ple who refrained from marking
gender reported that they experi
enced attempted unwanted pene
tration.

Over 50 percent of those sur
veyed reported forcible fondling
or unwanted touching or kissing.
The survey also explored to
whom victims turn to for support:
66 percent went first to a female

friend, 29 percent turned to a male
friend, 28 percent talked to no
one, 19 percent called a parent and
12 percent reported the incident
to a resident assistant (RA).
The panel also spoke about the
"alternative review process" in
troduced two years ago. Jamie
Hogan, a student affairs officer in
the Office of Judicial Affairs, dis
cussed the change in policy and
noted a positive effect on the
number of completed cases.
"The number of cases that
have gone through a hearing has
increased dramatically," Hogan
said.
The biggest change from the
previous process, which included
simultaneous cross-examination
of the victim and the perpetrator
before a six-person panel, was a
change to the standard of proof,
Hogan said. Now, the panel is
asked to act on probable proof
rather than proof beyond a rea
sonable doubt.
Under the new process, Hogan
discusses the judicial process with
the victim and hears the victim's
report. She then sends the victim
her notes to fact check and con
firm the victim wants to move for
ward, she said.

Next, a panel of three students
and a faculty member review in
formation collected from other in
volved parties witnesses and
the alleged perpetrator before
optional individual meetings are
held with the victim and the al
leged perpetrator.
Finally, a verdict is made as to
whether or not a University policy
has been violated and the victim is
consulted before any disciplinary
action is taken. According to
Hogan, a standard punishment is
loss of housing and being asked to
leave the University for as long as
the impacted student is enrolled.
"The Sexual Violence Adviso
ry Board advised consideration of
expulsion, but the reviewers have
not done that," Hogan said. "They
have instead moved toward sus
pension while the victim is en
rolled."
Angela Exson, assistant dean of
SARA, noted that "statistics tell us
that [it is] a very small group of
men committing [sexual] crimes
many times."
"The average offender will
commit [sexual] crimes seven
times before any action is taken
against them," she said.

An audience member then

brought up her experience with a
friend who "didn't want the social
repercussions of getting [the ag
gressor] kicked out." The student
asked how best to respond to
friends looking for help.
"The operative word is options,
not advice," responded Exson.
"The most important thing is being
armed with the resources."
Several administrators ac
knowledged that it can be confus
ing for students to navigate all the
resources that are available for
victims of sexual assault and rela
tionship abuse in the immediacy
of responding to abuse or assault.
They cited the SARA office (650-
725-9129), the 24-hour Stanford
dedicated hotline (650-725-
9955), Vaden Health Center and
free and confidential sexual as
sault exams at the Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center in San
Jose.
Victims can choose to pursue
legal processes through Stan
ford's Office of Judicial Affairs,
through University police, or
both. Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services (CAPS), the WCC,
the Bridge and the LGBT-Com
munity Resources Center also
provide services to students

working through psychological
and emotional damage caused by
sexual assault.

Student comments at the sym
posium centered around the no
tion that students control the key
variable of culture in dealing with
sexual assault and relationship
abuse on campus.

"I think there could have been
more discussion about communi
ty-based responses and changing
the culture," said Viviana Arcia
'l3, about the event.
Arcia, vice-president of Stan
ford V-Week and co-founder of
the Stanford Survivor's Group,
elaborated on a culture of victim
blaming.
"Campus culture has a lot of
victim-blaming attitudes," she
said. "For example, I have a lot of
problems with how the Stanford
police portray perpetrators as
strange men of color popping out
of bushes and respond by asking
me not to walk at night. I think
there are ways the police, for ex
ample, could educate themselves
and not always rely on victims to
stay safe,"
