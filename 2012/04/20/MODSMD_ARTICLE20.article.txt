# Card to clash with Cal
## 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Having concluded their home
schedule Wednesday afternoon
with an emphatic 7-0 victory over
unranked Pacific, the No. 12 Stan
ford men's tennis team will look to
further build postseason momen
tum today as they travel to Berke
ley for a rivalry matchup against
No. 14 Cal.
The match is the final test for
the Cardinal (15-7,4-2 Pac-12) be
fore the inaugural Pac-12 Champi
onship which starts on April 25
in Ojai, Calif. and will serve as a
tie-breaker between Stanford and
Cal (11-9,4-2 Pac-12) in determin
ing the tournament's No. 3 seed.
"All matches are important,
[and] this is a Pac-12 opponent on
the road, which can be challeng
ing," said head coach John
Whitlinger. "Cal is a very good
team, and I'm looking forward to a
great match with them."

Stanford has beaten Cal the
last four times that the teams have
faced each other, a streak the team
will doubtless seek to extend. Re
gardless of today's outcome, how
ever, the Cardinal will play either

Oregon or Washington in the tour
nament's first round. The Beavers
and Cougars play in Seattle to
morrow, with the winner clinching
the tournament's No. 5 seed.

The Cardinal soundly defeated
Cal at the Taube Family Tennis
Center in late February, dropping
only one match en route to a 6-1
victory in the annual Big Slam
match. However, the return to the
Cal lineup of two starters absent
from the previous match may ne
cessitate an adjustment in tactics
and diminish the psychological
boost provided by the earlier vic
tory.

"They are an entirely different
team with a full lineup,"
Whitlinger said. "So the match be
fore won't have a lot of bearing on
this match."

The Golden Bears, playing in
front of a home crowd, should
offer the Cardinal a stiff test. Cal is
led by three players ranked in the
top 60 nationally (No. 41 Ben
McLachlan, No. 48 Nick Andrews
and No. 58 Carlos Cueto), who will
face off against a Cardinal squad
led by No. 31 Ryan Thacher and
No. 45 Bradley Klahn.

Both the Cardinal and the

Golden Bears have struggled to
string wins together in recent
weeks, with both schools disman
tled in back-to-back matchups
against No. 1 USC and No. 6
UCLA. Today's match retains ad
ditional significance as a means of
returning to winning ways, setting
the tone for the Cardinal as they
enter the postseason.
"We're going to keep the same
energy from today against Cal and
then take that with us down to
Ojai for the Pac-12 tournament
and try to finally knock off those
L.A. schools," said junior Matt
Kandath after the win over Pacif
ic. The dominant victory against
unranked Pacific offers cause for
optimism looking forward to the
postseason.

"[Stanford and Cal] both had a
tough weekend in L.A. last week
end," Whitlinger conceded. "It's a
big match for both of us, with the
Pac-12 team tournament next
week."

The Cardinal will square off
against the Golden Bears today at
1:30 p.m. in Berkeley.
