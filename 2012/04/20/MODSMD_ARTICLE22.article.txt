## TOP 5 OTHER THINGS WE LOVE 
### 
Clearly, Intermission loves a lot of
stuff (judging by the theme of this
week's issue). In fact, we are obsessed
with so many things that we literally
couldn't fit them all into articles. Here
are the top five time-killers that didn't
make the cut.
Pinterest
Paper due tomorrow? Pinterest can
guarantee that you will, in fact, not
get even close to finishing. The web
site, created by a Yale graduate two
years ago, allows users to pin photos
on virtual "pinboards" according to
their own interests. Anything you like
food, art, fashion, quirky sayings,
wedding dresses (which may or may
not dominate the average 20-year-old
female's Pinterest feed . ..) can be
dropped onto your boards, creating
an eyegasm sure to entice even the
most hardcore studiers. Students,
beware.
The Hunger Games
What makes "The Hunger Games" so
great is that it's a movie that you can
recommend to everyone not just
girls under the age of time-for-reality
to-set-in (cough cough, "Twilight").
There's romance, sure, but it's realisti
cally awkward and not creepy; and of
course, there are teenagers who are
trained to kill from early ages, which
will draw any guy's attention. "The
Hunger Games" is not only a great
movie but also an epic trilogy of
books sure to capture the heart of
anyone old enough to stomach the
gore.

Spotify
Remember the day that singles
jumped to $1.29 on iTunes? That was
tragic. Luckly, Spotify can satisfy our
music cravings without us having to
pay five bucks just to download a
couple songs to work out to. This free
application links to Facebook and
connects you to a world of music just
about as comprehensive as that of
iTunes. The only downside? They still
don't have Adele's "21" or The
Beatles.
The Dish
Working out is not so fun when you
have to wait in line for a treadmill at
the gym and everyone is apparently
training for a marathon. Walking (or
running, if you're feeling ambitious)
the Dish is a more social, relaxed way
of getting a little bit of exercise in, as
well as getting to see an incredible
view of the Stanford area.
Springtime at Stanford
Fact number one: Classes can get
really, really tough. Fact number two:
Despite it being spring quarter, some
of us can't take 12 units, no matter
how much we want to. However, the
Ã¼ber-relaxed atmosphere of Stanford
in spring (as well as the absolutely
perfect weather) makes textbook
reading a little bit more bearable. If
nothing else, when you're biking to
the library at night, your hands won't
lock up from the frigid air.
