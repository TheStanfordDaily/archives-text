# SPRING EATING ON THE FARM
## taking Stanford dining outside

Since spring has sprung here on the
Farm, I've been finding myself com
ing up with more and more excuses
to spend time outside. Given Stanford's
incredible and extensive campus, one can
do virtually anything outside study on
the Oval, go for a run at the Dish or eat al
fresco. While I am a passionate picnicker,
picnicking isn't always feasible in an awk
ward hour between two classes. Instead, I
have found a few favorite on-campus spots
to lunch that offer outdoor seating as well
as the best food on campus.
The Arbuckle Cafe at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business is a phenome
nal option for lunch on campus. The cafe,
run by the Bon Appetite Management
Company, uses local and sustainable ingre
dients and offers various healthy and tasty
options. With the menu rotating daily,
there is always something new to try:
made-to-order sushi, flatbread pizzas,

soups and my personal favorite, the salad
bar. This is no ordinary salad bar it
offers ingredients I actually want to eat as
opposed to the canned veggies and other
food-like substances that typically end up
in salad bars. The offerings include season
al produce; some of my favorites toppings
are the beets, roasted butternut squash,
farro, homemade dressings and croutons.
The only downside to Arbuckle is the back
ground chatter about consulting, references
and job offers, but given the quality of the
food, as well as the extensive outdoor seat
ing, I am willing to get over my qualms
about pretension.
Another prime lunch spot on campus,
the Cool Cafe at the Cantor Arts Center,
is pretty unknown among undergraduates
even though it has been open since 2000.
The Cool Cafe is definitely worth checking
