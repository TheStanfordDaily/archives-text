## JOSS WHEDON 'BUFFY' CREATOR TALKS HIS NEW MARVEL MOVIE

lossI oss Whedon, the mastermind
behind cult hits like "Buffy the
Vampire Slayer" and "Firefly,"
-starts post-Oscar blockbuster
season this weekend with the long
awaited Marvel spectacle "The
Avengers." He recently spoke to
us on the phone about what it was
like to assemble a dream team of
superheroes and movie stars and
why his movie should be your top
summer movie priority.
Although he is best known for
his original works, Whedon was no
stranger to dealing with established
universes thanks to his work as a
script doctor on other franchises,
including the original "X-Men"
adaptation.
"I think Marvel has a great
nose for a director who has a pas
sionate vision," says Whedon,
"who's not famous for churning
out big budget hits but will bring
something a little bit fresh to the
concept of the superhero movie."
Indeed, over the past several
years the studio has attracted such
a broad range of directors for their
individual superhero films that
determining where "The Avengers"
would fit was one of Whedon's
greatest challenges.
"There's no way you could
make a movie that would look like
a Jon Favreau-Kenneth Brannagh-
Joe Johnston movie," admits
Whedon, citing his directorial
predecessors.
"I tend to be a tiny bit florid
with my camera work and my dia
logue, but hopefully, in away, that
feels [realistic]. The way that I can
reconcile the difference in styles is
that my own style is actually kind

of smack-dab in the middle of
what all those guys do."
While the complexity of the
"The Avengers," arguably the first
interlocking-universe picture of its
kind, meant dealing with a slew of
practical and creative challenges,
the pay-off was being able to work
with such star-studded cast.
"I felt very much like Nick
Fury," Whedon jokes. "He is [the]

director of S.H.I.E.L.D. And that
puts him kind of removed from
everybody, even if he likes them."
But at the same time, having so
many characters to work with
required a careful budgeting of
screen time.
"Everybody is so interesting
up against each other," he says. But
if he had to choose, "I would say I
love the Bruce Banner-Tony Stark

relationship."
"Bruce Banner is the first guy
Tony Stark has come across, really,
who operates on his level intellec
tually who isn't a villain. And the
way Tony nudges him is endearing
and cool."
And although he worked with
some of Hollywood's hottest stars,
Whedon insists that none of the
on-screen rivalries carried over

once the cameras stopped rolling.
Instead, with the candid enthusi
asm of a fanboy, the director
gushed about how the experience
was like a dream come true.
"The Avengers" is the kind of
movie that I grew up wanting to
make and thought they had
stopped making," says Whedon,
insisting that despite all the CGI
and special effects, his film is really
just "an old-fashioned movie."
"When I grew up, the summer
movie was literally created as a
concept. And all my life, I wanted
to do something like the first
Indiana lones something that
was steeped in character, in love
with the genre that it was portray
ing, had intelligence, had real act
ing, had a story that unfolded and
wasn't just a big premise that you
already knew going in."
If anyone could pull off a big
budget studio picture while
maintaining creative integrity, it's
Whedon, whose passion and
enthusiasm for the source mate
rial is nothing short of infectious.
But even so, that's not to say that
"The Avengers" was all play and
no work. When asked what his
ideal superhero power would be,
the director didn't bat an eye.
"I would have the power of
invisibility," he says. "And then I
wouldn't have to show up for as
many shooting days."
"The Avengers" hits theatres May 4.

once the cameras stopped rolling.
Instead, with the candid enthusi
asm of a fanboy, the director
gushed about how the experience
was like a dream come true.
"The Avengers" is the kind of
movie that I grew up wanting to
make and thought they had
stopped making," says Whedon,
insisting that despite all the CGI
and special effects, his film is really
just "an old-fashioned movie."
"When I grew up, the summer
movie was literally created as a
concept. And all my life, I wanted
to do something like the first
Indiana lones something that
was steeped in character, in love
with the genre that it was portray
ing, had intelligence, had real act
ing, had a story that unfolded and
wasn't just a big premise that you
already knew going in."
If anyone could pull off a big
budget studio picture while
maintaining creative integrity, it's
Whedon, whose passion and
enthusiasm for the source mate
rial is nothing short of infectious.
But even so, that's not to say that
"The Avengers" was all play and
no work. When asked what his
ideal superhero power would be,
the director didn't bat an eye.
"I would have the power of
invisibility," he says. "And then I
wouldn't have to show up for as
many shooting days."
"The Avengers" hits theatres May 4.
