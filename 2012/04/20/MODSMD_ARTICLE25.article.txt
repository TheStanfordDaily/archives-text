# STUFF WE LOVE
## STANFORD 
### – sara VAN RENSSELAER contact sarah: saravr@stanford. edu 
Last Thursday, the unofficial "Oprah Day"
was the second time in my Stanford
fcareer that I actually made a concerted
effort to get out on campus and explore. Upon
hearing that Oprah was on campus, I dropped
everything and ran out to my bike.
As I headed out on campus, trying to think
like Oprah and figure out where I could spot

this exquisite creature, I ventured all around, hit
ting the big spots where I assumed she would
go: MemChu, White Plaza, the Claw, the Main
Quad, Hoover Tower, one of the many Arrillaga
centers... but to no avail. Fortunately, I met up
with a group of rag-tag adventurers like myself,
and we set off on our quest. I know we looked
ridiculous. I felt ridiculous as I sped around

campus, in the rain, in search of one of the
world's most famous and powerful women.
But in the process, I came across a few
Stanford gems.
The Hugh Hildreth Skilling Building
A quick stop by the Geology Comer gave
me a moment to look around and figure out
where Oprah might have gone. It was here that I
caught sight of the "Killing Building." I had to do
a double take before I realized that the "S" from
Skilling is suspidously absent from the side of
the building.
Cemex Auditorium, Knight Management
Center
Due to being graced with a last name that
always puts me at the end of alphabetical lists, I
ended up taking my Chem 31A exams in this
auditorium. As you can imagine, whenever I
arrived at Cemex to take my midterm, I would
be a ball of nerves. However, as I waited in line
to sign in and get my exam, the wall of flipping
color cards would momentarily entrance me.
When we stopped by the business school in
hopes of seeing Oprah after spotting a few secu
rity guards, we spent a moment or two staring at
the wall. While we may have lost some time try
ing to find Oprah, I don't mind. The wall was
still pretty awesome.
And of course:

The Fleet of Golf Carts
Since we were looking for a very specific
golf cart (we were told that it was a covered,
green golf cart with two stars on the side), we
kept our eyes peeled for golf carts that might fit
the description. Of all the golf carts we spotted
on our jaunt, only one was green, and it wasn't
for Oprah. That itself isn't really the issue; it's the
fact that there really are an inordinate amount of
golf carts on campus. I know there are jokes
about there being so many, but I didn't really
realize how many there are.
I don't know whether it is because I am a
freshman and the novelty of celebrities being on
campus still hasn't worn off or if it is something
more than that, but I hope that I never stop get
ting excited about finding bizarre details about
Stanford or knowing that influential people are
on campus —though I'll probably refrain from
going out and actively looking for them. Even
though I didn't know most of the people I went
around campus with, the fact that we managed
to create our own excited little brigade just reaf
firms my affection toward this school and the
people here.
So, even though I never did find Oprah, I
did find another set of reasons why I absolutely
adore this place.
