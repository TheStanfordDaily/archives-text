It's a Thursday night, and you have three
hours to kill. First, that's a miracle. Really,
you should check that out. Second, you find
yourself on Netflix craving something a little
more substantial than "No Strings Attached."
The "critically-acclaimed foreign drama" box is
staring into your soul, saying, "If you don't
watch one of my subtided guerrilla documen
taries, you're pretty much admitting you don't
have an attention span." One more episode of
"Modern Family" and you definitely don't...
that's it... don't you go to Hulu ... aw, shoot.
See, I have a problem. I love movies, but
my attention span is quite low. I admire those

that can sit through two-hour experimental
films and then debate how it reveals the mean
ing of art. But I can sympathize with the guy in
the audience who sits there slightiy
perplexed/horrified.
I love great stories. "Kill Bill," "American
Beauty," "Slumdog Millionaire" and "Requiem
for a Dream" are some of my favorite examples
of great storytelling, but chances are you've seen
at least a couple of those. So I'm going rogue!
Behold, a list of genuinely entertaining movies
you probably haven't seen, but are worth your
time and money. Did I say money? I meant
time.
