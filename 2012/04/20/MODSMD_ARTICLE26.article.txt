It's a Thursday night, and you have three
hours to kill. First, that's a miracle. Really,
you should check that out. Second, you find
yourself on Netflix craving something a little
more substantial than "No Strings Attached."
The "critically-acclaimed foreign drama" box is
staring into your soul, saying, "If you don't
watch one of my subtided guerrilla documen
taries, you're pretty much admitting you don't
have an attention span." One more episode of
"Modern Family" and you definitely don't...
that's it... don't you go to Hulu ... aw, shoot.
See, I have a problem. I love movies, but
my attention span is quite low. I admire those

that can sit through two-hour experimental
films and then debate how it reveals the mean
ing of art. But I can sympathize with the guy in
the audience who sits there slightiy
perplexed/horrified.
I love great stories. "Kill Bill," "American
Beauty," "Slumdog Millionaire" and "Requiem
for a Dream" are some of my favorite examples
of great storytelling, but chances are you've seen
at least a couple of those. So I'm going rogue!
Behold, a list of genuinely entertaining movies
you probably haven't seen, but are worth your
time and money. Did I say money? I meant
time.

"Aliens": The movie that
made me fall in love with movies. If
you like action, and you haven't
seen this, see it. Sigourney Weaver
(Stanford alum, hey!) stars as
Ripley, pretty much the most

badass heroine ever. Don't let the
crappy remakes/reboots fool you:
This is a classic, directed by James
Cameron, who you might recog
nize as the man behind "Avatar"

and "Terminator." Try not fist
pumping the universe when Ripley
tells the mother alien to "Get away
from her, you bitch!" Just try.
"Boogie Nights": I, too, was
skeptical about a movie about a
male porn star, even if that porn
star is Mark Wahlberg. But this
film about the, ahem (I'm feeling
bashful), adult entertainment
industry, in 1970s LA makes a riv
eting story and complex characters
out of the sex/coke/murder cliches.
Don't worry, though, there is plen
ty of sex/coke/murder.

"Mother": I don't know how
I discovered it, but it's one of the
best random finds in recent mem
ory. This South Korean thriller
(you don't even notice the subti
tles) follows a mother desperately
trying to find the killer who

framed her disabled son for mur
der. No wonder Hollywood keeps
turning to Asia to find thrillers to
remake: The stories are so good.
Andthe originals are almost always
better. Check out "Oldboy" and
"Battle Royale" (what "Hunger
Games" should be) if these strike
your fancy.

"Spring, Summer, Autumn,
Winter... and Spring": I have
quite a soft spot for Asian cinema
and culture, so I love this film,

though it moves at a deliberately
slow pace. It takes place on the

same lake and follows the life of a
monk and his disciple through
changing seasons and passing

years. It's a beautiful film if the
Buddhist philosophy has ever
appealed to you. If it's not your
cup of (green) tea, that's okay too.
"Do the Right Thing": See
it, see it, see it! My Film Studies
101 class would almost surely

agree: This is one of those rare
films that feel like a revelation.

The Spike Lee classic follows a
Brooklyn neighborhood as it
gives rise to the racial and socioe
conomic tensions of the late
1980s and is truly filmmaking at
its best.

Alright, that's all for now,
folks! Happy Netflixing/unofScial
channel surfing.
