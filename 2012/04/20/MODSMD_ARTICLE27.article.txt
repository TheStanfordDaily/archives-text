# STUFF WE LOVE
## LOVE AT FIRST INSTAGRAM 
### â€“ julia PURCELL contact julia: jcp15@stanford. edu 
Instagram is the
best kind of social
networking it
encourages you to
share actual content,
small and large, from
your life. It distills the
question "What are
you doing?" into a pic
ture that you get to edit
instantly. Had a great
meal? Snap a picture.
Beautiful view?
Documented. Found a
funny sign? Got it.
I propose that the

beauty of Instagram might also be
that it makes you think about little
moments you may want to
remember. Using a camera would
be too much of a hassle, but having
Instagram on my phone makes it
easy and convenient enough that I
think to use it (and I get to share
that photo almost instantly).

Taking a picture of
my friend holding
an enormous bowl
of ice cream now
triggers memories
for me of a funny
comment she made.
I might not have
remembered it with

as many specifics if I had
n't thought to take out my
phone at the last second
and snap a picture.
Of course, many naysay
ers will argue that experi
ences are sullied by such
documentation and that
such technology creates
opportunistic phone use
and lack of being present.

To them I say that
at least for me, tak
ing the picture
actually allows me
to be in the
moment more
that is, the dupli
cate actually makes
me appreciate the
real thing at that
very second.
Even the oft
derided filters, I
would argue, add
something yes,
many of them do
make your picture

look "vintage," but
they also give you a bit of leeway
and creativity. One filter allows you
to blur the foreground, while
another lets you sharpen the con
trast. Not only do I get to curate
the image, I get to pick what its
focus is and to control the visual

result without opening Photoshop.
Instagram is easy, effective
and, dare I say it, fun. Go ahead,
succumb to the hype you won't
regret it!
