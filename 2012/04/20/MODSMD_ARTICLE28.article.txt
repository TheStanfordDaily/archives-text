## 'GIRLS' 
### â€“ misa SHIKUMA contact misa: mshikuma@stanford. edu 
The Internet has been abuzz
for weeks now with girl
talk: that is, speculation sur
rounding HBO's new Judd
Apatow-produced comedy "Girls."
Created, written and directed by
wunderkind Lena Dunham, who
made waves with her 2009 debut
feature "Tiny Furniture," the show
has been touted as our generation's
"Sex and the City."
Having seen the highly antici
pated pilot, I can tell you that while
"Girls" centers on the personal lives
of four female friends living in
New York City, the similarities end
there. Dunham's cast is younger,
less fixed into static archetypes and

have interactions and misadven
tures reminiscent of you and your
best friend. Not to mention they
live in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. If
anything, "Girls" is more like a love
letter to all of us who grew up
watching Carrie Bradshaw and
company cavorting around as
over-glamorized manifestations of
female empowerment, only to
enter the messy world of adult
hood and realize that it's not all
shiny Manolos, high-powered
careers and glitzy parties.
Trying to find themselves in
the midst of those terrifying years
of post-college limbo are Hannah
(Dunham), an aspiring writer who

loses both her unpaid internship
and the financial support of her
parents in the pilot; her responsible
and uptight roommate, Marnie
(Allison Williams); their newly
returned bohemian friend, Jessa
(Jemima Kirke); and the latter's
bubbly and naive cousin,
Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet). While at
the outset, these may just seem like
tropes reformulated for the hipster
set, Dunham's writing reveals the
nuances of identities not yet fixed,
since, after all, the girls are only in
their early twenties.
The thirty-minute pilot alone
tackles head-on issues that are all
too familiar for those in my cohort,

like body insecurity, settling for
unpaid internships in the current
economy, guys who start treating
you like crap just as soon as the sex
is over, pregnancy scares and stag
ing friend-interventions. And don't
be fooled by the network's billing
of the show as a comedy; the
humor tends to be subtle and, at
times, "Girls" hits so close to home
that it's almost uncomfortable to
watch.
"I think that I may be the
voice of my generation," says
Hannah to her parents in a tragi
cally comic, opiate-induced
attempt to regain their financial
support.

"Or at least," she qualifies, "A
voice of a generation."
"Girls" definitely won't res
onate with everyone, but it suc
ceeds in capturing something of
what it's like to be newly cast out
into the real world in away that
feels organic rather than reductive
and trivializing (ahem, all those
other shows with "girl" in the title).
But unfortunately for Dunham,
the greater the hype, the harsher
the backlash.
Although the racially homog
enous casting does little to prevent
interpretations of the show as a
study in #whitegirlproblems, as a
non-white viewer I would argue
that the characters' issues have less
to do with race than with being
from a liberal arts-educated,
upper-middle-class background in
the same way that Christian
Lander's "Stuff White People Like"
pokes fun at a particular slice of
the socioeconomic strata rather
than consumers' actual skin color.
So while the lack of onscreen
diversity in a show set in present
day New York City is frustratingly
dissonant, there is no denying that
"Girls" is thematically and narra
tively honest in away that many
shows, especially those targeted at
young women, simply aren't these
days. Baby steps, people, baby
steps.
"Girls" airs Sunday nights at
10:30 p.m. on HBO. Catch the first
few episodes for free on You Tube
via HBO's channel.
