# No clear medical marijuana policy
## University cites differences between federal and state law 
### JOSH HOYT STAFF WRITER 
While some Stanford students use pre
scribed medical marijuana. University poli
cy regarding the drug remains unclear due
to conflicts between state and federal law,
campus officials said.

"This is a complex issue fraught with am
biguity given the state and federal differ
ences," wrote Ralph Castro, director of the
Grifaffice of Alcohol Policy & Education
(OAPE), in an email to The Daily. Castro
was careful to add that he does not speak
for the University, but instead "as an admin
istrator and interpreter and implementer of
University policy."

"It is my understanding that since Stan
ford is an institution of higher education
that receives federal funding ... we must
abide by federal laws," Castro said. "Feder
al laws do not recognize medical marijuana
and as such, we don't have University poli
cies that recognize medical marijuana."

Several administrators in the Office of
Accessible Education, dedicated toward
providing accommodations and support
services for students with disabilities, said
that they are unsure of the University's pol
icy toward medical marijuana and directed
The Daily to the OAPE.

Other California universities have simi
larly nebulous attitudes toward student use
of medical marijuana. Jerlena Griffin-
Desta, director of student services for the

University of California (UC) system, told
SFWeekly in February that while the UC
system does not have policies that endorse
any kind of marijuana use, "if a student has
demonstrated through documentation that
this is something they must have, the uni
versity will work with the student to find
reasonable accommodation."

California legalized marijuana for medical
purposes 16 years ago, and the Bay Area has
become home to a growing marijuana indus
try. Over the past couple years, the Obama
Administration has pressured the marijuana
industry with legal action and raids.
Earlier this month federal agents raided
an Oakland network of dispensaries and a
marijuana trade school known as Oakster
dam University. The raids targeted the busi
nesses of Richard Lee, founder of Oakster
dam University and a leading activist for
marijuana legalization. Lee has since
turned over control of all of his marijuana
businesses, in addition to Oaksterdam.
While the medical marijuana crackdown
has been viewed as a setback for the legal
ization movement, it has not had much of an
impact on the Stanford campus. Some local
dispensaries have closed, and those that
have remained open are more careful to
stay within state law, but several area dis
pensaries still deliver on campus.
