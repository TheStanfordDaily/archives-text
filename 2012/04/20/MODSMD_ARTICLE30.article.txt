# THE
						GUYS of 'NEW GIRL'

When "New Girl" pre
miered last fall, many
saw it as a Zooey
Deschanel vehicle. And while the
show features the indie princess
in her natural state wearing
vintage-inspired outfits and
singing often it's not just about
her. In fact, the three guys starring
with her Max Greenfield,
Lamorne Morris and Jake
Johnson as Schmidt, Winston and
Nick, respectively, have been steal
ing the show. Their deadpan
snark, messy love lives and
increasingly bizarre personalities
have elevated "New Girl" from a
so-so sitcom to arguably the fun
niest show on TV. It has become

the show of choice for everything
from post-midterm stress relief to
impromptu TV-watching gather
ings in crowded one-room dou
bles. What makes these guys so
special? Read on.
Nick
Quote: "It smells like leather and
Teddy Roosevelt and wistfulness!"
Jake Johnson is lovable as
down-on-his-luck Nick, the law
school dropout turned bartender
(basically, what every fuzzy fears
they may one day become). We
first see him pining after his ex,
Caroline, but soon he's back on
the scene, facing insecurities
about his body and his paltry

income (in a recent episode, it's
revealed his credit score is in the
200s, or as Winston points out,
probably less than he weighs). His
mopeyness is endearing, and at
this point, everyone is rooting for
him and Zooey Deschanel's Jess
to hook up. As the show's unlikely
hero, he's getting funnier every
week.
Winston
Quote: "Eye of the Tiger ended
the Cold War."
As a former college basket
ball star who went pro in
Latvia Winston is competitive
but lacks motivation. When he
finds himself back in the States,

he struggles to find a job
and ends up being a nanny.
Often the voice of reason in
the group, he's gotten pro
gressively quirkier through
out the show admitting,
among other things, a secret
love for the "Wicked"
soundtrack and passion for
cereal.
Schmidt
Quote: "Pine has no place
in this loft. It's the wood of
poor people, and outhous
es."
Not to be outdone,
Schmidt is the heart of
"New Girl." With his con
stant use of buzzwords and
not-so-secret love of
Japanese culture, Schmidt is
your typical entrepreneurial,
start-up enthusiast, though
perhaps preppier. While he
started out as the archetypal
douchebag, Schmidt has
evolved into something so

much more. With his love of
chutney, loafers (the slippier, the
better) and cardigans, he's one of
TV's most bizarre and hilarious
characters. Seeing what unlikely
situations he'll find himself in
each week is enough to pull any
Stanford student through prob
lem-set-induced stress. Plus, as he
gets closer to Jess' model friend,
Cece (Hannah Simone), his story
gets better and better. As Winston
said recently, he's peaking as is
"New Girl."
