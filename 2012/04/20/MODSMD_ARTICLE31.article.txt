## ROXY SASS QUIT THE COY TALK 
### 
Note: Roxy would like to
sincerely apologize for
excluding SAE from her
last column. Roxy has always been
a fan of tennis players and Latin
men, and SAE is no exception. And
let's be real Roxy's on her back
before you can even say "Back to
School."

Roxy, as you might imagine,
has been pursued by many a boy
(and the occasional girl). And

though she tries to keep an open
mind (her version of the old adage
"don't knock it till you try it" is more
along the lines of "don't knock it till
you've knocked boots"), she is more
of a quality-over-quantity girl. Or,
more realistically, a quality- and
quantity girl. And size and frequen
cy. And though Roxy is game to play
in the bedroom, one game Roxy
doesn't play is Hard-to-Get (she
plays Get-to-Hardl). So, over the
years, Roxy has learned some of the
most and least effective ways to send
the occasional unwanted suitors
packing.
When Roxy's not willing to
drop her pants, she usually starts
by dropping subtle hints.
References to "friendship" and pro
lific use of the word "buddy" do
the trick with the more astute boys.
And when Roxy, whose spring
quarter schedule is as open as her
legs often are, is suddenly never
available to hang out, it isn't
because she's got one too many
games of sloshball planned.
Unfortunately, while the male
population at Stanford is well
endowed in some ways (mostly
intelligence and ... well, you
know), their strengths don't always
include social awareness. When
Roxy finds herself caught in hard

situations (not the good kind), she
sometimes resorts to talking about
her own exploits (you may have
noticed that Roxy's not afraid to
kiss and tell) or, if that doesn't
work, trying to help the boy in
question get some somewhere else.
For the most unshakable
crushes, Roxy occasionally resorts
to more drastic measures.
Nothing's more of a boner kill than
having to hear about an ex, and
Roxy's acted the part of a crazy ex
girlfriend in dire circumstances. Of
course, this is a high-risk tech
nique: While it might scare off
unwanted boys, if word spreads, it
might scare off future prospects as
well. And nothing is scarier to Roxy
than not being able to get any.
Have you found yourself being
chased by an incredibly cute boy you
just can't get rid of? There's one more
technique that might work send
him Roxy's way with an email to
intermission@stanforddaily.com.
