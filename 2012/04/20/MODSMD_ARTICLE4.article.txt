## Frosh drawn to Arrillaga New dining hall has altered bonding experience, say staff 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Students and residential staff
report that Arrillaga Dining has
changed the dynamic of freshman
community bonding since it
opened fall quarter.
While initially advertised as an
alternative dining destination for
upperclassmen living in Crothers
and Toyon Halls, the Arrillaga
Family Dining Commons has at
tracted freshmen from Wilbur and
Stern dorms, which already have
their own dining halls traditionally
providing space for freshmen to
eat together.
"There's fewer people eating as
a dorm in Wilbur," said Krystal Le
'l4, who resides in Cedro this year
and lived in Okada last year. "Last
year, every dorm would have their
own table or area and everyone
would eat there, but now you only
see half the table or just a couple
students."

Le added, however, that the ef
fect has not been dramatic. She
stated that Arrillaga has simply be
come another option to consider,
similar to the eateries at Tresidder
Memorial Union, when she choos
es to eat elsewhere.
"I feel like there's still a lot of
people who eat in Wilbur overall,"
Le said. "But rather than have
every single meal in Wilbur, people
sometimes go to Arrillaga. At the
beginning [when Arrillaga
opened], most people from Okada
went there, but now it's stabilized."
As a Burbank resident fellow
(RF) for five years, Stephanie
Eberle said she has observed the
effects of the opening of Arrillaga
on Stern freshmen.
"I think students dine in Stern
less often than they did before be
cause there have been a couple of
times when our Burbank dining
area in Stern has been completely
empty," Eberle said in an email to
The Daily. "But I do still see my
students dining together in groups
whether in Stern or Arrillaga."
Eating in communities helps
freshmen build a sense of commu
nity, according to Eberle, whether
it is in their residence complex's
dining hall or elsewhere on cam
pus.

"For a while my students were
going in groups together to ex
plore dining options across cam
pus, so community can be
achieved without a 'home base'
dining area as long as there is a
strong residential community
overall," Eberle said.
Nonetheless, Eberle added that
she feels it is easier to build this
sense of belonging in a freshman
dining community like Stern, es
pecially at the beginning of the ac
ademic year when some students
are nervous or apprehensive
about where they will be wel
comed.

Le said a potential upside to
Arrillaga's opening is that the
quality and variety of the food at
East Campus freshman dining
halls has increased since last year,
perhaps in order to keep students
in their residence communities for
meals.

Wilbur resident Casey Robbins
'l5 of Junipero said she finds it

nice that traffic has decreased in
the Wilbur dining area because
there are shorter lines.

"At the same time, it can be
very depressing if you go in at the
very beginning or the very end of
the meal and no one is there be
cause they're all eating at Arrilla
ga," Robbins said.
Robbins said she only eats at
Arrillaga about every other week
because Wilbur is conveniently lo
cated and she does not notice
enough of a difference in the qual
ity of food to dine farther away.
She added that she thinks that the
effects of Arrillaga were much
greater in Stern because it is more
closely located to the new dining
commons.

The opening of Arrillaga may
have changed the ways freshmen
build communities in their dining
halls, but that does not mean that
they have stopped creating friend
ships over meals completely, ac
cording to Eberle.

"Given the structure of Arrilla
ga, you really have no choice but to
sit with others and it gives a chance
to meet people from the greater
Stanford community as well,"
Eberle said. "My view is that stu
dents need to learn how to take
that frosh community to the Stan
ford community as a whole to
explore the world together.There
fore, 1 like that they have options."

whether in Stern or Arrillaga."
Eating in communities helps
freshmen build a sense of commu
nity, according to Eberle, whether
it is in their residence complex's
dining hall or elsewhere on cam
pus.

"For a while my students were
going in groups together to ex
plore dining options across cam
pus, so community can be
achieved without a 'home base'
dining area as long as there is a
strong residential community
overall," Eberle said.
Nonetheless, Eberle added that
she feels it is easier to build this
sense of belonging in a freshman
dining community like Stern, es
pecially at the beginning of the ac
ademic year when some students
are nervous or apprehensive
about where they will be wel
comed.

Le said a potential upside to
Arrillaga's opening is that the
quality and variety of the food at
East Campus freshman dining
halls has increased since last year,
perhaps in order to keep students
in their residence communities for
meals.

Wilbur resident Casey Robbins
'l5 of Junipero said she finds it

nice that traffic has decreased in
the Wilbur dining area because
there are shorter lines.

"At the same time, it can be
very depressing if you go in at the
very beginning or the very end of
the meal and no one is there be
cause they're all eating at Arrilla
ga," Robbins said.
Robbins said she only eats at
Arrillaga about every other week
because Wilbur is conveniently lo
cated and she does not notice
enough of a difference in the qual
ity of food to dine farther away.
She added that she thinks that the
effects of Arrillaga were much
greater in Stern because it is more
closely located to the new dining
commons.

The opening of Arrillaga may
have changed the ways freshmen
build communities in their dining
halls, but that does not mean that
they have stopped creating friend
ships over meals completely, ac
cording to Eberle.

"Given the structure of Arrilla
ga, you really have no choice but to
sit with others and it gives a chance
to meet people from the greater
Stanford community as well,"
Eberle said. "My view is that stu
dents need to learn how to take
that frosh community to the Stan
ford community as a whole to
explore the world together.There
fore, 1 like that they have options."
