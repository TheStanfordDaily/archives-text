## FacSen places high value on online ed 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate discussed
online education Thursday,
hearing from a five-member
panel about the University's
current and future initiatives.
Eric Roberts, professor of com
puter science, called the issue
"the most controversial that has
come up in my time here," and
critiqued the fact that no oppo
nents of online education had
addressed the Senate.

Provost and Acting Presi
dent John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2 opened the meeting by com
menting on the imminent depar
ture of Stanford Law School
Dean Larry Kramer. Kramer
will leave Stanford in August to
serve as president of the
Hewlett Foundation.

"It's a wonderful thing for
Larry," Etchemendy said. "For
us, it's not so wonderful. Larry
was a practically perfect dean ..
. We will miss Larry a lot."
Etchemendy, currently serv
ing as acting president while
University President John Hen
nessy remains on sabbatical, also
commented on the increased
workload and responsibilities
that he has assumed.
"A lot of you may be ques
tioning whether we need both a
President and [a] Provost,"
Etchemendy quipped. "The an
swer is 'yes.'"

Paul Marca 'BB, executive di
rector of the Stanford Center for
Professional Development
(SCPD), opened the panel's
presentation on online educa
tion by detailing the SCPD's
current offerings for graduate
and professional courses.
Describing Stanford as a pio
neering institution in the field of
distance learning, Marca noted
that upwards of 2,500 students
are currently enrolled in 200 tu
ition-based online graduate
courses, in addition to fee-pay
ing professional and graduate
certificate offerings.
Lisa Lapin, assistant vice
president for University com
munications, then commented
on the increased demand for
Stanford-sourced content
through mediums such as iTunes
U and You Tube, noting, "Stan
ford course material is wildly
popular around the globe."

Stanford offers content from
43 courses on You Tube and 111
courses on iTunes U. According
to Lapin, over the past year, the
University has averaged 1.69
million views per month
through its You Tube channel,
and 1.4 million downloads per
month with iTunes U.

Lapin said Stanford was one
of five universities to launch a
complete iTunes app in January,
which will offer 13 full courses to
interested students. She noted that
the University will look to collabo
rate further with iTunes on provid
ing supplemental materials and in
corporating social interaction for
students.
John Mitchell, a professor of
computer science who has served
as a special assistant to the Presi
dent for educational technology
since January, noted that several
Stanford faculty members have al
ready ventured into online educa
tion with great success. He cited,
among other examples, the work
of computer science professor Se
bastian Thrun, whose "Introduc
tion to Artificial Intelligence"
course attracted more than
160,000 online participants.
Thrun recently launched the
free, web-based university Udacity.
"Evolving technology gives us
an opportunity to expand and
reinvigorate education at all lev
els," Mitchell said.
Mitchell argued that develop
ing Stanford's reputation in online
education would benefit the Uni
versity as a whole.
"It would be beneficial for
Stanford to be a leader in online
education," Mitchell said. "Many
faculty are rethinking their cours
es, how they develop them and
how they teach. That can only be
good for us."
While noting that enrollment
in Stanford-developed online edu
cation and feedback from partici
pants exceeded expectations,
Etchemendy said that it may
prove challenging to disseminate
knowledge on such a large scale
without sacrificing the quality of
faculty instruction.
He added that it remains to be
seen how online education will in
teract with Stanford's existing
course offerings, expressing skep
ticism about the fiscal stability of
purely online universities, stating
that he hopes a sustainable model
will be developed that "doesn't ir
reparably damage higher educa
tion."

"The main value [of a universi
ty] is certification not the certi
fication of our graduates, but the

selection and certification of facul
ty for students," Etchemendy said.
"Online universities hope to ac
cess that same certification for free
... Because they're not paying the
full cost of faculty, and if students
migrate, the financial model may
just not work."
Faculty discussion of the sub
ject focused on Stanford's role in
pioneering online education, and
the impact that advances in the
field may have on on-campus stu
dents.
"It's very exciting and scary,
and it's important for Stanford to
get this right because a lot of
places are looking to us," said
Debra Satz, professor of philoso
phy.
Satz also argued that the cur
rent division of content provision
between University efforts and ex
ternal start-ups such as the
Stanford-developed and recently
launched Coursera would need
future clarification and resolution.
Bruce Clemens, professor of
materials science and engineering,
expressed concerns that the dupli
cation of content offered to on
campus students, as well as to on
line audiences, could potentially
alienate those in physical atten
dance at the University.
Etchemendy, however, main
tained that the two models can
continue to co-exist or even collab
orate to a greater extent, citing the
additional efforts of professors to
interact with on-campus students.
"The value of a Stanford educa
tion comes from much, much more
than what's offered in classes,"
Etchemendy said.
Roberts noted what he viewed
as an excessive focus on promoting
online education.
"As much as I support the ex
periments, if we're to get some
thing out of them we need to be
honest," Roberts said. "Things that
we are [still] doing really well are
not getting the same level of recog
nition, resources and support as
these initiatives."
Returning to the recommenda
tions of the Study of Undergradu
ate Education at Stanford (SUES),
the Faculty Senate will discuss un
dergraduate breadth requirements
at its next meeting on May 3.

The Faculty Senate discussed
online education Thursday,
hearing from a five-member
panel about the University's
current and future initiatives.
Eric Roberts, professor of com
puter science, called the issue
"the most controversial that has
come up in my time here," and
critiqued the fact that no oppo
nents of online education had
addressed the Senate.

Provost and Acting Presi
dent John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2 opened the meeting by com
menting on the imminent depar
ture of Stanford Law School
Dean Larry Kramer. Kramer
will leave Stanford in August to
serve as president of the
Hewlett Foundation.

"It's a wonderful thing for
Larry," Etchemendy said. "For
us, it's not so wonderful. Larry
was a practically perfect dean ..
. We will miss Larry a lot."
Etchemendy, currently serv
ing as acting president while
University President John Hen
nessy remains on sabbatical, also
commented on the increased
workload and responsibilities
that he has assumed.
"A lot of you may be ques
tioning whether we need both a
President and [a] Provost,"
Etchemendy quipped. "The an
swer is 'yes.'"

Paul Marca 'BB, executive di
rector of the Stanford Center for
Professional Development
(SCPD), opened the panel's
presentation on online educa
tion by detailing the SCPD's
current offerings for graduate
and professional courses.
Describing Stanford as a pio
neering institution in the field of
distance learning, Marca noted
that upwards of 2,500 students
are currently enrolled in 200 tu
ition-based online graduate
courses, in addition to fee-pay
ing professional and graduate
certificate offerings.
Lisa Lapin, assistant vice
president for University com
munications, then commented
on the increased demand for
Stanford-sourced content
through mediums such as iTunes
U and You Tube, noting, "Stan
ford course material is wildly
popular around the globe."

Stanford offers content from
43 courses on You Tube and 111
courses on iTunes U. According
to Lapin, over the past year, the
University has averaged 1.69
million views per month
through its You Tube channel,
and 1.4 million downloads per
month with iTunes U.

Lapin said Stanford was one
of five universities to launch a
complete iTunes app in January,
which will offer 13 full courses to
interested students. She noted that
the University will look to collabo
rate further with iTunes on provid
ing supplemental materials and in
corporating social interaction for
students.
John Mitchell, a professor of
computer science who has served
as a special assistant to the Presi
dent for educational technology
since January, noted that several
Stanford faculty members have al
ready ventured into online educa
tion with great success. He cited,
among other examples, the work
of computer science professor Se
bastian Thrun, whose "Introduc
tion to Artificial Intelligence"
course attracted more than
160,000 online participants.
Thrun recently launched the
free, web-based university Udacity.
"Evolving technology gives us
an opportunity to expand and
reinvigorate education at all lev
els," Mitchell said.
Mitchell argued that develop
ing Stanford's reputation in online
education would benefit the Uni
versity as a whole.
"It would be beneficial for
Stanford to be a leader in online
education," Mitchell said. "Many
faculty are rethinking their cours
es, how they develop them and
how they teach. That can only be
good for us."
While noting that enrollment
in Stanford-developed online edu
cation and feedback from partici
pants exceeded expectations,
Etchemendy said that it may
prove challenging to disseminate
knowledge on such a large scale
without sacrificing the quality of
faculty instruction.
He added that it remains to be
seen how online education will in
teract with Stanford's existing
course offerings, expressing skep
ticism about the fiscal stability of
purely online universities, stating
that he hopes a sustainable model
will be developed that "doesn't ir
reparably damage higher educa
tion."

"The main value [of a universi
ty] is certification not the certi
fication of our graduates, but the

selection and certification of facul
ty for students," Etchemendy said.
"Online universities hope to ac
cess that same certification for free
... Because they're not paying the
full cost of faculty, and if students
migrate, the financial model may
just not work."
Faculty discussion of the sub
ject focused on Stanford's role in
pioneering online education, and
the impact that advances in the
field may have on on-campus stu
dents.
"It's very exciting and scary,
and it's important for Stanford to
get this right because a lot of
places are looking to us," said
Debra Satz, professor of philoso
phy.
Satz also argued that the cur
rent division of content provision
between University efforts and ex
ternal start-ups such as the
Stanford-developed and recently
launched Coursera would need
future clarification and resolution.
Bruce Clemens, professor of
materials science and engineering,
expressed concerns that the dupli
cation of content offered to on
campus students, as well as to on
line audiences, could potentially
alienate those in physical atten
dance at the University.
Etchemendy, however, main
tained that the two models can
continue to co-exist or even collab
orate to a greater extent, citing the
additional efforts of professors to
interact with on-campus students.
"The value of a Stanford educa
tion comes from much, much more
than what's offered in classes,"
Etchemendy said.
Roberts noted what he viewed
as an excessive focus on promoting
online education.
"As much as I support the ex
periments, if we're to get some
thing out of them we need to be
honest," Roberts said. "Things that
we are [still] doing really well are
not getting the same level of recog
nition, resources and support as
these initiatives."
Returning to the recommenda
tions of the Study of Undergradu
ate Education at Stanford (SUES),
the Faculty Senate will discuss un
dergraduate breadth requirements
at its next meeting on May 3.
