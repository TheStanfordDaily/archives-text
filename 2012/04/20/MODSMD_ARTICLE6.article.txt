## FacSen places high value on online ed 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate discussed
online education Thursday,
hearing from a five-member
panel about the University's
current and future initiatives.
Eric Roberts, professor of com
puter science, called the issue
"the most controversial that has
come up in my time here," and
critiqued the fact that no oppo
nents of online education had
addressed the Senate.

Provost and Acting Presi
dent John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2 opened the meeting by com
menting on the imminent depar
ture of Stanford Law School
Dean Larry Kramer. Kramer
will leave Stanford in August to
serve as president of the
Hewlett Foundation.

"It's a wonderful thing for
Larry," Etchemendy said. "For
us, it's not so wonderful. Larry
was a practically perfect dean ..
. We will miss Larry a lot."
Etchemendy, currently serv
ing as acting president while
University President John Hen
nessy remains on sabbatical, also
commented on the increased
workload and responsibilities
that he has assumed.
"A lot of you may be ques
tioning whether we need both a
President and [a] Provost,"
Etchemendy quipped. "The an
swer is 'yes.'"

Paul Marca 'BB, executive di
rector of the Stanford Center for
Professional Development
(SCPD), opened the panel's
presentation on online educa
tion by detailing the SCPD's
current offerings for graduate
and professional courses.
Describing Stanford as a pio
neering institution in the field of
distance learning, Marca noted
that upwards of 2,500 students
are currently enrolled in 200 tu
ition-based online graduate
courses, in addition to fee-pay
ing professional and graduate
certificate offerings.
Lisa Lapin, assistant vice
president for University com
munications, then commented
on the increased demand for
Stanford-sourced content
through mediums such as iTunes
U and You Tube, noting, "Stan
ford course material is wildly
popular around the globe."

Stanford offers content from
43 courses on You Tube and 111
courses on iTunes U. According
to Lapin, over the past year, the
University has averaged 1.69
million views per month
through its You Tube channel,
and 1.4 million downloads per
month with iTunes U.

Lapin said Stanford was one
of five universities to launch a
complete iTunes app in January,
which will offer 13 full courses to
