The Bridge Center for Peer
Counseling has experienced a
spike in calls this quarter, possi
bly in relation to two recent stu
dent deaths, according to Bridge

counselor Akshay Gopalan 'l2
who spoke to The Daily before
aThursday night discussion about
dealing with grief and suicide on
campus.

Samantha Wopat 'l4 died on
March 25 after attempting sui
cide the week before. Cady Hine,
a co-founder of Stanford Peace of
Mind, died April 1 at her home in
Palo Alto.

"We are getting a spike of calls

related to mental health and ill
ness and the loss of Cady and
Sam," Gopalan said.
He added that the Bridge does
not document the specific details
of counsel sessions, and the cen
ter did not have data to say
whether the increase in calls is di
rectly related to the deaths of
Wopat and Hine,
According to Gopalan, Bridge
counselors have asked for addi-

tional training to prevent "com
passion fatigue," or burnout from
discussing how to deal with the
loss of loved ones with other stu
dents.
At Thursday's event, Donno
van Yisrael 'BB, M.A. 'B9, manag
er of relationship and sexual
health programs at Vaden's
Health Promotion Services cen
ter, facilitated a discussion
with3students on how to deal
with grieving both personally
and as support resources for
other students.
Yisrael discussed with those in
attendance how to encourage stu
dents to recognize grief as a legit
imate feeling, what to say and
what not to say to anyone who is
grieving and how to support
grieving friends. He emphasized
the student wellness iThrive pro
gram as a resource for increasing
students' resiliency.

Gopalan said he thought the
training would be useful to all mem
bers of the student body, regardless
of whether they were counselors.
"Because the format of peer
counseling is still conducive to
being applied to friendships
what to do personally and how to
tell others what to do I think
both aspects of the talk will be
useful for the population," he
said. "I'm sure there are people
who are dealing with things who
may not want to go to [Counsel
ing and Psychological Services] or
the Bridge, and will tell their
friends first. So it will be useful for
friends to know what to do."
