## HISTORY CORNER Admit Weekend 
### â€“ Natasha Weaser 
As Admit Weekend approaches and
over 1,000 prospective freshmen
(ProFros) are soon to descend on the
Farm, The Daily took a look back at
the history of Admit Weekend.
In 1985, an experimental telephone hotline
for ProFros overwhelmed the administration
with over 30 calls in one night.
"Questions ranged from the obvious class
sizes, overseas opportunities and the quality of
teaching in various departments to the more
esoteric 'ls Palo Alto the suburban, boring
place it is reputed to be?' one prospect asked,"
The Daily reported ("Admittees swamp hotline,"
April 24,1985).
On April 23, 1999, inspired by admit week
ends at schools throughout the United States,
The Daily published a collaborative piece be
tween student journalists at Stanford, Williams
and Harvard in which each writer penned
thoughts on their respective schools.
"The theme of Stanford is 'opportunity'," the
Stanford column read. "The Stanford students
have the opportunities to take large lecture class
es or small seminars, live in dormitories or vege
tarian cooperative houses, conduct undergradu
ate original research, act in a student-written and
produced musical comedy, or anything in be
tween. That, in one paragraph, is the essence of
Stanford."
That same year, The Daily reported that there
had been two alcohol-related incidents during
Admit Weekend.
"On Friday, another prospective freshman be
came sick after drinking too muchrTPeople just
nursed him to a state of semi-health,' resident as
sistant Akhi Sista said," The Daily reported in an
article on one of the incidents ("Weekend role
reversal," April 27,1999).
In 2001, The Daily reported that alcohol inci
dents continued to occur during Admit Weekend
despite a change in administrative policy.
"Beginning last year, the Admissions Office
put the guidelines for Admit Weekend partici
pants in writing, in order to ensure that prospec
tive students and their parents understood Stan
ford's expectations before coming for the week
end,"The Daily reported ("Alcohol policy exam
ined," April 25,2001).
