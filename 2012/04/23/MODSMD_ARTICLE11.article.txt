# A 						COUPLE OF GOOD GENES
## 
### LINDA YU 
James Watson, Francis Crick,
Linus Pauling and Rosalind
Franklin are staple figures of bi
ology textbooks today, but their
names also appear frequently in
the professional repertoires of two
Stanford genetics professors, husband
and wife Leonard "Len" and Leonore
"Lee" Herzenberg.
"There's a saying: 'Standing on the
shoulders of giants,'" said Lawrence
Steinman, professor of neurology and
chair of Stanford's program in im
munology. "[Len and Lee] may not
physically look like giants, but they are
the giants of immunology."
And friendly, warm, welcoming gi
ants they are. As lab members passed
by Lee's office, she called out to each
one, whether passing along a memo,
inviting them to dinner, calling them to
join the ongoing conversation in her
office or simply saying hello. Fler of
fice, too, evoked an amicable atmos
phere with splashes of color, shelves of
family pictures and assorted memora
bilia.
The Herzenbergs' dog, a Bichon
Frise named Gigi, also spends her time
in the lab, obediently lying next to Lee
on an orange cushion on the ground.
Len's office is conveniently located
right next to Lee's, allowing for easy
and convenient communication, a cen
tral element of their work together.
"We are a two-headed horse that
mostly goes in the same direction,"
Lee said. "We nourish the same body,
and the two heads talk a lot."
The pair met at Brooklyn College
in 1952, when Len was a senior and
Lee was a freshman. Lee needed an
analytic geometry tutor, and a mutual
friend introduced her to Len, who tu
tored high school students at the time.
Their friendship blossomed into a re
lationship, and an engagement came
soon thereafter. While their parents
expressed concern about the marriage
because of the pair's youth and many
remaining years of schooling, Len and

Lee fully believed in the connection
they shared and were determined to
maintain it.
"From the time we started to go
out, we knew we were engaged," Lee
said.
Len went on to graduate school at
Caltech, which, at the time, boasted a
biology department that included
seven future Nobel Prize winners.
There, he was exposed to an interdisci
plinary research culture that the
Flerzenbergs maintain in their lab
today.
To be closer to Len, Lee transferred
from Brooklyn College to Pomona
College. Flowever, the science courses
at Pomona paled in comparison to
those at Caltech, and Lee soon began
auditing graduate level classes there
instead. While she could have enrolled
as a student, Caltech did not accept
women into its graduate programs—

an early incidence of the gender dis
crimination Lee would face later in
life. Still, Lee praises Caltech's biology
department for its support of women
in her field and credits her teachers
there with teaching her how to think
about science.
Following his time at Caltech, Len
worked for the Pasteur Institute and
the National Institutes of Health be

fore he was asked to join the biology
department at Stanford. He accepted
the offer, an especially fitting choice
because Stanford was one of only a
few schools that allowed couples to
work together. Lee had already start
ed pursuing her own scientific re
search interests.
It was at Stanford that Len devel
oped the award-winning technique of
fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS), which rapidly sorts cells
based on fluorescence markers on
their surfaces. Invented in the late
19605, there are now over 30,000 FACS
machines worldwide, and the technol
ogy has played a crucial role in the
fields of immunology, cancer biology
and regenerative medicine, among
others. For the FACS technique and
his lifelong contributions to science,
Len received the Kyoto Prize, Japan's
equivalent of the Nobel, in 2006.
The Herzenbergs' successes are
largely a result of their teamwork and
collaboration. There is never competi
tion between them, as the two publish
papers together and maintain jointly
functioning laboratory groups at Stan
ford. With different temperaments
and interests, their relationship is de
fined more by complementary aspects
than similarities.
"Len is more into the science, and
he loves to range freely across all sci
ences," Lee said. "He finds a new area
of science, brings in a fellow or a stu
dent and then he finds another area in
two years. At one point, I told him, 'lf
you bring me home one more baby,

couple for 60 years. Len is pictured
wearing his 2006 Kyoto Prize Medal.
I'm going to go crazy.'"
On the other hand, Lee calls
herself the "data person" and is
more technically oriented. Her
main focus is detailed work in
the lab, such as statistical analy
sis, guidance of programmers
and the development of new
software.
Between them, knowledge is
shared, and respect is mutual.
"Len taught me to be the sci
entist I am," Lee said. "He taught
me all of the science."
For instance, Lee says that it is
Len's ability to make connec
tions between a diverse range of
fields that makes him stand out
as a scientist, and he has inspired
her to do the same.
"He can make connections
that other people can't, and he
taught me how to do this," she
said.
Hearing this, Len smiled and
credited Lee's innate aptitude.
A close working environment
has also had clear benefits for the
couple.
"When two people have sepa
rate careers, they have to man
age their own priorities, but they
don't have intimate knowledge
of the priorities," Lee said. "For
us, that knowledge has always
been common between us."
For instance, if one of their
children felt homesick or needed
to be picked up, their knowledge
of each other's duties at work al
lowed them to determine who
could most conveniently leave to
take care of the issue, they said.
Their lifestyle preferences are
also complementary, as Len is a
"morning person" and Lee tends
to work from midnight until 3 or
4 a.m. In the early 19705, when
their children were young, Len

prepared breakfast for the chil
dren, as Lee was seldom awake
in the morning.
"Len would often [take care
of the children], and he didn't
necessarily like other people to
know this," Lee said. "But when
it became something okay [for
men to do], he made sure to tell
people he had always made his
kids breakfast."

This mutual support for one
another took a more political turn
early in Lee's career as a woman
in a scientific field. Lee, unafraid
to speak her mind, would often
join her male colleagues in discus
sions and seminars, winning the
acceptance of some and the dis
dain of others. Len, however, was
supportive throughout, respect
ing Lee for her ideas and contri
butions.
"He didn't treat a woman like
she had to stay home," Lee said.
"I respected him, and he ... re
spected me."
In addition to Len's support,
Lee has also had a number of fe
male role models who encour
aged her to pursue her career.
One such figure was Linus Paul
ing's wife, Helen Pauling, who
told Lee to be persistent.
"[Helen] was never really al
lowed to develop her career, so
she told me to keep at it," Lee
said. "She told me, 'Don't let
them keep you down.' She made
a very strong impression."
Sixty years after their first
meeting, Lee and Len Herzen
berg continue to share their
work and their lives. Their after
noons are spent in the lab, still
collaborating with their peers
and colleagues and working as a
team to advance the threshold of
scientific knowledge.
"We've never really
changed," Lee said. "We do
everything together."

James Watson, Francis Crick,
Linus Pauling and Rosalind
Franklin are staple figures of bi
ology textbooks today, but their
names also appear frequently in
the professional repertoires of two
Stanford genetics professors, husband
and wife Leonard "Len" and Leonore
"Lee" Herzenberg.
"There's a saying: 'Standing on the
shoulders of giants,'" said Lawrence
Steinman, professor of neurology and
chair of Stanford's program in im
munology. "[Len and Lee] may not
physically look like giants, but they are
the giants of immunology."
And friendly, warm, welcoming gi
ants they are. As lab members passed
by Lee's office, she called out to each
one, whether passing along a memo,
inviting them to dinner, calling them to
join the ongoing conversation in her
office or simply saying hello. Fler of
fice, too, evoked an amicable atmos
phere with splashes of color, shelves of
family pictures and assorted memora
bilia.
The Herzenbergs' dog, a Bichon
Frise named Gigi, also spends her time
in the lab, obediently lying next to Lee
on an orange cushion on the ground.
Len's office is conveniently located
right next to Lee's, allowing for easy
and convenient communication, a cen
tral element of their work together.
"We are a two-headed horse that
mostly goes in the same direction,"
Lee said. "We nourish the same body,
and the two heads talk a lot."
The pair met at Brooklyn College
in 1952, when Len was a senior and
Lee was a freshman. Lee needed an
analytic geometry tutor, and a mutual
friend introduced her to Len, who tu
tored high school students at the time.
Their friendship blossomed into a re
lationship, and an engagement came
soon thereafter. While their parents
expressed concern about the marriage
because of the pair's youth and many
remaining years of schooling, Len and

Lee fully believed in the connection
they shared and were determined to
maintain it.
"From the time we started to go
out, we knew we were engaged," Lee
said.
Len went on to graduate school at
Caltech, which, at the time, boasted a
biology department that included
seven future Nobel Prize winners.
There, he was exposed to an interdisci
plinary research culture that the
Flerzenbergs maintain in their lab
today.
To be closer to Len, Lee transferred
from Brooklyn College to Pomona
College. Flowever, the science courses
at Pomona paled in comparison to
those at Caltech, and Lee soon began
auditing graduate level classes there
instead. While she could have enrolled
as a student, Caltech did not accept
women into its graduate programs—

an early incidence of the gender dis
crimination Lee would face later in
life. Still, Lee praises Caltech's biology
department for its support of women
in her field and credits her teachers
there with teaching her how to think
about science.
Following his time at Caltech, Len
worked for the Pasteur Institute and
the National Institutes of Health be

fore he was asked to join the biology
department at Stanford. He accepted
the offer, an especially fitting choice
because Stanford was one of only a
few schools that allowed couples to
work together. Lee had already start
ed pursuing her own scientific re
search interests.
It was at Stanford that Len devel
oped the award-winning technique of
fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS), which rapidly sorts cells
based on fluorescence markers on
their surfaces. Invented in the late
19605, there are now over 30,000 FACS
machines worldwide, and the technol
ogy has played a crucial role in the
fields of immunology, cancer biology
and regenerative medicine, among
others. For the FACS technique and
his lifelong contributions to science,
Len received the Kyoto Prize, Japan's
equivalent of the Nobel, in 2006.
The Herzenbergs' successes are
largely a result of their teamwork and
collaboration. There is never competi
tion between them, as the two publish
papers together and maintain jointly
functioning laboratory groups at Stan
ford. With different temperaments
and interests, their relationship is de
fined more by complementary aspects
than similarities.
"Len is more into the science, and
he loves to range freely across all sci
ences," Lee said. "He finds a new area
of science, brings in a fellow or a stu
dent and then he finds another area in
two years. At one point, I told him, 'lf
you bring me home one more baby,

I'm going to go crazy.'"
On the other hand, Lee calls
herself the "data person" and is
more technically oriented. Her
main focus is detailed work in
the lab, such as statistical analy
sis, guidance of programmers
and the development of new
software.
Between them, knowledge is
shared, and respect is mutual.
"Len taught me to be the sci
entist I am," Lee said. "He taught
me all of the science."
For instance, Lee says that it is
Len's ability to make connec
tions between a diverse range of
fields that makes him stand out
as a scientist, and he has inspired
her to do the same.
"He can make connections
that other people can't, and he
taught me how to do this," she
said.
Hearing this, Len smiled and
credited Lee's innate aptitude.
A close working environment
has also had clear benefits for the
couple.
"When two people have sepa
rate careers, they have to man
age their own priorities, but they
don't have intimate knowledge
of the priorities," Lee said. "For
us, that knowledge has always
been common between us."
For instance, if one of their
children felt homesick or needed
to be picked up, their knowledge
of each other's duties at work al
lowed them to determine who
could most conveniently leave to
take care of the issue, they said.
Their lifestyle preferences are
also complementary, as Len is a
"morning person" and Lee tends
to work from midnight until 3 or
4 a.m. In the early 19705, when
their children were young, Len

prepared breakfast for the chil
dren, as Lee was seldom awake
in the morning.
"Len would often [take care
of the children], and he didn't
necessarily like other people to
know this," Lee said. "But when
it became something okay [for
men to do], he made sure to tell
people he had always made his
kids breakfast."

This mutual support for one
another took a more political turn
early in Lee's career as a woman
in a scientific field. Lee, unafraid
to speak her mind, would often
join her male colleagues in discus
sions and seminars, winning the
acceptance of some and the dis

"When two people have sepa
rate careers, they have to man
age their own priorities, but they
don't have intimate knowledge
of the priorities," Lee said. "For
us, that knowledge has always
been common between us."
For instance, if one of their
children felt homesick or needed
to be picked up, their knowledge
of each other's duties at work al
lowed them to determine who
could most conveniently leave to
take care of the issue, they said.
Their lifestyle preferences are
also complementary, as Len is a
"morning person" and Lee tends
to work from midnight until 3 or
4 a.m. In the early 19705, when
their children were young, Len

prepared breakfast for the chil
dren, as Lee was seldom awake
in the morning.
"Len would often [take care
of the children], and he didn't
necessarily like other people to
know this," Lee said. "But when
it became something okay [for
men to do], he made sure to tell
people he had always made his
kids breakfast."

This mutual support for one
another took a more political turn
early in Lee's career as a woman
in a scientific field. Lee, unafraid
to speak her mind, would often
join her male colleagues in discus
sions and seminars, winning the
acceptance of some and the dis
dain of others. Len, however, was
supportive throughout, respect
ing Lee for her ideas and contri
butions.
"He didn't treat a woman like
she had to stay home," Lee said.
"I respected him, and he ... re
spected me."
In addition to Len's support,
Lee has also had a number of fe
male role models who encour
aged her to pursue her career.
One such figure was Linus Paul
ing's wife, Helen Pauling, who
told Lee to be persistent.
"[Helen] was never really al
lowed to develop her career, so
she told me to keep at it," Lee
said. "She told me, 'Don't let
them keep you down.' She made
a very strong impression."
Sixty years after their first
meeting, Lee and Len Herzen
berg continue to share their
work and their lives. Their after
noons are spent in the lab, still
collaborating with their peers
and colleagues and working as a
team to advance the threshold of
scientific knowledge.
"We've never really
changed," Lee said. "We do
everything together."
