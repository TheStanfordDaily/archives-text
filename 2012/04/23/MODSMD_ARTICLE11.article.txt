# A
						COUPLE OF GOOD GENES

James Watson, Francis Crick,
Linus Pauling and Rosalind
Franklin are staple figures of bi
ology textbooks today, but their
names also appear frequently in
the professional repertoires of two
Stanford genetics professors, husband
and wife Leonard "Len" and Leonore
"Lee" Herzenberg.
"There's a saying: 'Standing on the
shoulders of giants,'" said Lawrence
Steinman, professor of neurology and
chair of Stanford's program in im
munology. "[Len and Lee] may not
physically look like giants, but they are
the giants of immunology."
And friendly, warm, welcoming gi
ants they are. As lab members passed
by Lee's office, she called out to each
one, whether passing along a memo,
inviting them to dinner, calling them to
join the ongoing conversation in her
office or simply saying hello. Fler of
fice, too, evoked an amicable atmos
phere with splashes of color, shelves of
family pictures and assorted memora
bilia.
The Herzenbergs' dog, a Bichon
Frise named Gigi, also spends her time
in the lab, obediently lying next to Lee
on an orange cushion on the ground.
Len's office is conveniently located
right next to Lee's, allowing for easy
and convenient communication, a cen
tral element of their work together.
"We are a two-headed horse that
mostly goes in the same direction,"
Lee said. "We nourish the same body,
and the two heads talk a lot."
The pair met at Brooklyn College
in 1952, when Len was a senior and
Lee was a freshman. Lee needed an
analytic geometry tutor, and a mutual
friend introduced her to Len, who tu
tored high school students at the time.
Their friendship blossomed into a re
lationship, and an engagement came
soon thereafter. While their parents
expressed concern about the marriage
because of the pair's youth and many
remaining years of schooling, Len and

Lee fully believed in the connection
they shared and were determined to
maintain it.
"From the time we started to go
out, we knew we were engaged," Lee
said.
Len went on to graduate school at
Caltech, which, at the time, boasted a
biology department that included
seven future Nobel Prize winners.
There, he was exposed to an interdisci
plinary research culture that the
Flerzenbergs maintain in their lab
today.
To be closer to Len, Lee transferred
from Brooklyn College to Pomona
College. Flowever, the science courses
at Pomona paled in comparison to
those at Caltech, and Lee soon began
auditing graduate level classes there
instead. While she could have enrolled
as a student, Caltech did not accept
women into its graduate programsâ€”

an early incidence of the gender dis
crimination Lee would face later in
life. Still, Lee praises Caltech's biology
department for its support of women
in her field and credits her teachers
there with teaching her how to think
about science.
Following his time at Caltech, Len
worked for the Pasteur Institute and
the National Institutes of Health be

fore he was asked to join the biology
department at Stanford. He accepted
the offer, an especially fitting choice
because Stanford was one of only a
few schools that allowed couples to
work together. Lee had already start
ed pursuing her own scientific re
search interests.
It was at Stanford that Len devel
oped the award-winning technique of
fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS), which rapidly sorts cells
based on fluorescence markers on
their surfaces. Invented in the late
19605, there are now over 30,000 FACS
machines worldwide, and the technol
ogy has played a crucial role in the
fields of immunology, cancer biology
and regenerative medicine, among
others. For the FACS technique and
his lifelong contributions to science,
Len received the Kyoto Prize, Japan's
equivalent of the Nobel, in 2006.
The Herzenbergs' successes are
largely a result of their teamwork and
collaboration. There is never competi
tion between them, as the two publish
papers together and maintain jointly
functioning laboratory groups at Stan
ford. With different temperaments
and interests, their relationship is de
fined more by complementary aspects
than similarities.
"Len is more into the science, and
he loves to range freely across all sci
ences," Lee said. "He finds a new area
of science, brings in a fellow or a stu
dent and then he finds another area in
two years. At one point, I told him, 'lf
you bring me home one more baby,
