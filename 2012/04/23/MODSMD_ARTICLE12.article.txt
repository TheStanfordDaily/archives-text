## EDITORIAL The 						pitfalls of social engagement inside the classroom 
### 
In Friday's editorial we de
fended faculty political advo
cacy outside the classroom.
Professors, as members of the
University community, should be
allowed to engage freely in social
and political activism in their free
time outside of teaching. In
today's follow-up editorial, we
will look at the other side of the
equation: the impact of faculty
members' social and political in
volvement inside the classroom.
A recent Washington Post op-ed
by Floover fellow Peter
Berkowitz alleges that quality of
education at top universities has
diminished as a result of curricula
that prioritize activism over
learning, citing a research report
on the UC system by the Nation
al Association of Scholars.
Although there are flaws in the
logic of Berkowitz and the NAS
for example, they seemingly ig
nore the fact that today's students
spend far less time studying when
searching for the cause of declin
ing quality of education the re
port and editorial raise important
questions about whether the con
tent of an academic course should
be explicitly infused with the fac
ulty member's, or anyone's, social
and political views. Should college
courses become training grounds
for activism and social engage
ment? Though this Editorial
Board acknowledges the impor
tance of some Stanford courses
directed at this goal, we worry that
an overemphasis on creating
agents of social change will en
danger courses that deal with rel
atively esoteric subjects or focus
on content mastery.
One example of the move to
transform some Stanford courses
into sites of social and political ac
tivism is the letter to the Study of
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES) committee by
the ASSU Community Action
Board (CAB). In addition to ad
vocating increased faculty diver
sity, which the Editorial Board
supports, the CAB hopes that the
curriculum can be more reflec
tive of concerns over power
structures, identity engagement,
and political access. The report
reads, "We believe that it is im
perative that Stanford establish a
curriculum that not only 'engages
difference' and 'appreciates cul

tural difference,' but one that in
ternalizes questions of access,
power, and identity."
What would it mean for the
Stanford curriculum to internal
ize these social questions? Would
Aristotle be excluded because his
view that women are by nature
inferior to men reinforces patri
archal structures of power? Will a
class on Nietzsche be viewed as
suspect because some used his
philosophy in support of
Nazism? These questions are hy
perbolic, but the rhetoric sur
rounding socially engaged educa
tion makes them relevant.
Though the views of CAB are not
necessarily representative of
those of the student body, the let
ter to the SUES committee pres
ents a potentially alarming view
of liberal education in which a
course's ability to engage ques
tions of identity, access, and
power is used to justify its place in
the curriculum. A view of the
value of liberal arts education in
which courses should become
training grounds for social ac
tivism threatens to marginalize
thinkers who fail to engage in so
cially relevant questions or who
present less tolerant views on
women, minorities, and privilege.
This Editorial Board values
courses that may have nothing to
do with social issues, that feature
thinkers who may not offer polit
ically correct views, and that may
be irrelevant to good citizenship.
Although we believe faculty
members should still be allowed
to teach classes that promote so
cial engagement, if approved by
their department, these classes
should occupy a minority rather
than majority of the liberal arts
curriculum. Indeed, there remain
many sites for social activism out
side of the classroom, while there
are fewer opportunities to deeply
engage in more theoretical sub
jects beyond the classroom walls.
Just as we should trust the ability
of Stanford students to formulate
their own political viewpoints
that stand apart from the view
points of their professors, we
should trust their ability to act as
socially engaged citizens without
necessarily taking classes that
promote a social agenda.

A student taking classes in
Greek metaphysics and German
literature is not necessarily less so
cially engaged or a worse citizen
than a student taking courses in ed
ucation equity and food sustain
ability. Although we disagree with
Berkowitz and the NAS conclu

sion that politicized classrooms re
sult from left-leaning political affil
iations, we agree that an over-em
phasis on courses geared toward
social engagement can diminish
the quality of a liberal education.
The closing of the Stanford mind
occurs not when faculty members
engage in social activism outside
the classroom, but when a focus on
courses as training grounds for so
cial activism marginalizes or
crowds out courses that have no
such aim.

sion that politicized classrooms re
sult from left-leaning political affil
iations, we agree that an over-em
phasis on courses geared toward
social engagement can diminish
the quality of a liberal education.
The closing of the Stanford mind
occurs not when faculty members
engage in social activism outside
the classroom, but when a focus on
courses as training grounds for so
cial activism marginalizes or
crowds out courses that have no
such aim.
In Friday's editorial we de
fended faculty political advo
cacy outside the classroom.
Professors, as members of the
University community, should be
allowed to engage freely in social
and political activism in their free
time outside of teaching. In
today's follow-up editorial, we
will look at the other side of the
equation: the impact of faculty
members' social and political in
volvement inside the classroom.
A recent Washington Post op-ed
by Floover fellow Peter
Berkowitz alleges that quality of
education at top universities has
diminished as a result of curricula
that prioritize activism over
learning, citing a research report
on the UC system by the Nation
al Association of Scholars.
Although there are flaws in the
logic of Berkowitz and the NAS
for example, they seemingly ig
nore the fact that today's students
spend far less time studying when
searching for the cause of declin
ing quality of education the re
port and editorial raise important
questions about whether the con
tent of an academic course should
be explicitly infused with the fac
ulty member's, or anyone's, social
and political views. Should college
courses become training grounds
for activism and social engage
ment? Though this Editorial
Board acknowledges the impor
tance of some Stanford courses
directed at this goal, we worry that
an overemphasis on creating
agents of social change will en
danger courses that deal with rel
atively esoteric subjects or focus
on content mastery.
One example of the move to
transform some Stanford courses
into sites of social and political ac
tivism is the letter to the Study of
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES) committee by
the ASSU Community Action
Board (CAB). In addition to ad
vocating increased faculty diver
sity, which the Editorial Board
supports, the CAB hopes that the
curriculum can be more reflec
tive of concerns over power
structures, identity engagement,
and political access. The report
reads, "We believe that it is im
perative that Stanford establish a
curriculum that not only 'engages
difference' and 'appreciates cul

tural difference,' but one that in
ternalizes questions of access,
power, and identity."
What would it mean for the
Stanford curriculum to internal
ize these social questions? Would
Aristotle be excluded because his
view that women are by nature
inferior to men reinforces patri
archal structures of power? Will a
class on Nietzsche be viewed as
suspect because some used his
philosophy in support of
Nazism? These questions are hy
perbolic, but the rhetoric sur
rounding socially engaged educa
tion makes them relevant.
Though the views of CAB are not
necessarily representative of
those of the student body, the let
ter to the SUES committee pres
ents a potentially alarming view
of liberal education in which a
course's ability to engage ques
tions of identity, access, and
power is used to justify its place in
the curriculum. A view of the
value of liberal arts education in
which courses should become
training grounds for social ac
tivism threatens to marginalize
thinkers who fail to engage in so
cially relevant questions or who
present less tolerant views on
women, minorities, and privilege.
This Editorial Board values
courses that may have nothing to
do with social issues, that feature
thinkers who may not offer polit
ically correct views, and that may
be irrelevant to good citizenship.
Although we believe faculty
members should still be allowed
to teach classes that promote so
cial engagement, if approved by
their department, these classes
should occupy a minority rather
than majority of the liberal arts
curriculum. Indeed, there remain
many sites for social activism out
side of the classroom, while there
are fewer opportunities to deeply
engage in more theoretical sub
jects beyond the classroom walls.
Just as we should trust the ability
of Stanford students to formulate
their own political viewpoints
that stand apart from the view
points of their professors, we
should trust their ability to act as
socially engaged citizens without
necessarily taking classes that
promote a social agenda.
