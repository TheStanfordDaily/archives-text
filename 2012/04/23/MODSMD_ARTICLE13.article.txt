# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## Can people change? 
### Nina Chung 
The question arises in every
relationship we have,
though our answer is hardly
ever the same. We aim the word
"change" at the culprits of our
breakups and divorces; it's like ev
idence of unfair play. Other times,
we place inexplicable amounts of
hope in it to justify ties that hurt
us, but simply must have a future,
(That hope, too, can find a very
bitter end.) In some ways, we are
convinced that people do change,
to our dismay or demand. Yet, in
all of these cases, we seem more
ready to relegate that possibility
to the realm of others. So, in this
alleged age of self-discovery, have
we been fooled into thinking that
we are the constants?
High school was about when I
embarked on the epic mission to
"be myself." Much of American
youth culture claims to promote
this mission. I employed all per
sonality (slash perfume-style)
quizzes in women's magazines
and looked up to role models (i.e.,
Natalie Portman) to try and set
something of myself in stone. In
light of how mysteriously de
signed we all are, figuring a thing
or two out often feels like relief:
"Yeah, I definitely [am this or do

that]!"
Statements like these are like
exclusive property titles to our life
and personality. They represent
an ability to look at our past and
find precedents and patterns.
Maybe it's around puberty and
social entrances that this desire
for finalization starts sinking in
a desire to be the master of our
selves. An interviewer reiterated
that to me recently, as he walked
me out the door: "It really seems
like you know yourself," he said.
"Thanks!" I said, without getting
into how "knowing myself" was
becoming a particularly self-cen
tered source of pride I was trying
to tone down. His comment re
minded me that self-awareness, as
articulated in every cover letter
and interview we do, is generally
Step One to getting ahead in life.
But there's a very thin line be
tween self-awareness and self-ful

filling prophecy. Self-awareness is
about knowing our strengths,
temptations and failures, and ac
cepting what we cannot change.
The line is that we don't always
know what cannot change. The
prophecy is when self-awareness
becomes future-oriented, pre
scribing unnecessary guidelines
with which we hem ourselves
later.
I've been considering this thin
line a lot recently, as I'm a senior
graduating in eight weeks. I feel
myself toeing it each time a con
versation with either of my par
ents reaches hostile pitches, most
ly regarding my future. These peo
ple are among those who care for

my well-being as much as I do, and
maybe more. Their intentions are
in the clear, and I know it. So why
such violent opposition to the of
fered advice? Why do I get so sen
sitive? It's because, honestly, their
different ideas make me wonder if
the decisions I've made about my
self are wrong. And it's an uncom
fortable mental place. For how
much I say I'm all for growth and
learning and constructive criti
cism, it's my tight grip on knowing
myself that restricts me from truly
opening my heart to friends and
family. So, when the debates are
over, I realize again that they were
never about bouncing around
ideas; they were usually about im

pressing someone about how I al
ready knew my own idea.
Open-mindedness, a well-re
puted quality, is often tested by
our ability to try a new food, ac
cept that others think differently
or listen to others' opinions in tol
eration. In actuality, I think that
we're all open-minded about any
thing that doesn't matter much to
us. The real test comes when we
face something that shakes
mankind's most prized possession
our knowledge of self. All we
want is to depend on it forever.
We even go so far as to tout our
own "bad" qualities, hurtful or


harsh habits we inflict on others,
as distinctive and inevitable parts
of us. And in doing so, we end up
giving ourselves a free pass to do
them perpetually.
A certain degree of self
awareness is essential every
thing this column is speaks to how
much I think so. Sans a bit of in
trospection, we'd never learn
from mistakes; we'd be constantly
vulnerable to foolish situations
and we'd face an identity crisis
every time we had to pick an ice
cream flavor. But there's a place
where knowledge stops being
knowledge and instead becomes

our main obstacle. Or, perhaps,
the main obstacle is acknowledg
ing that we've reached that point
of self-restriction at all.
People can be changed,
though, in enormous ways. I've
experienced it myself and seen it

in others, and now have faith that
it's possible.
