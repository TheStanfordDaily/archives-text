# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## The 						paradoxes of pre-professionalism 
### Miles Unterreiner 
One of the greatest contra
dictions at the heart of the
modern elite university is
its general refusal to explicitly
prepare its students for eventual
professional careers even as it
almost by definition attracts the
students most qualified for, and
dedicated to pursuing, eventual
professional careers. This contra
diction, while in many senses in
evitable, also has a host of nega
tive consequences that both elite
universities and their students
need to acknowledge and address.
One will search the undergrad
uate catalogues at Harvard,
Princeton, Yale, Columbia and
our very own Stanford in vain for
majors in pre-law, pre-med, pre
dental, pre-veterinary, pre-physi
cal therapy and the like. One in
stead finds anthropology, history,
mathematics, biology, chemistry
the pure subjects, unsullied by
the tainted aura of vocational
training. The closest nascent in
vestment bankers can come to fi
nance is economics, while aspiring
CEOs looking for a business
major will have to be satisfied
with management science and en
gineering.
That is far from the case at
most public universities in Ameri
ca. Nearly all state schools allow
their students to begin prepara
tion for a post-university profes
sional career immediately upon
entrance, with majors in pre-law,
nursing or business open to stu
dents with a well-defined sense of
their own future.
Stanford, like other elite pri
vate universities, eschews that
model, for mostly good reasons.
The purpose of a liberal arts edu
cation, after all, is to cultivate in its
graduates a thorough foundation

in the arts and sciences; to instill
its students with the ability to rea
son and analyze critically; to equip
its inchoate scholars with facilities
of broad learning, rather than nar
row factual knowledge and mem
orized technical skills. Single
mindedly pursuing a career from
the moment one sets foot on cam
pus closes innumerable avenues
of fruitful learning, precluding the
opportunity for sustained, mean
ingful engagement with literature,
philosophy and the lessons of his
tory.
But Stanford's approach to
learning has its drawbacks too.
One of them is the hypocrisy
and doubletalk it engenders
among elite students, most of
whom got here by always thinking
about the step ahead. The implicit
cultural shadow the elite universi
ty model casts upon pre-profes
sionalism discourages an open ac
knowledgment of future career
goals among the students most
likely to be heatedly pursuing
them behind the scenes. The result
is a sort of mutant variant on the
famous Stanford duck syndrome,
in which some students quack
loudly about deep intellectual
thoughts on the surface while
paddling furiously toward career
goals underwater.
You may recognize this syn
drome's symptoms: the pre-med
who feigns scholarly interest in
the material from lecture when
talking to his TA, but really just
wants the problem set answers so
he can scrape an A- on the
midterm; the apparent Econ en
thusiast who'll forget everything
she learned in the 50-series as
soon as she gets the summer in
ternship at Goldman; the PoliSci
major with her eyes on the profes

sor but her mind on law school.
There are more specific, less
nebulous reasons to worry about
this model as well. One of them
stems from elite education's
upper-crust origins in the world of
silver spoons and the Social Regis
ter, Downton Abbey and Skull
and Bones a world in which
universities conferred culture and
class, rather than added economic
or professional value, simply be
cause their students could afford
not to worry about it. For students
whose trust funds will make up
the difference between a degree
in finance and one in eighteenth
century French literature, pre
professionalism might seem un
couth. But for low-income or first
generation students with families
to support after college, a high-

Elite universities
should be more
open about pre
professionalism.

paying job can be a necessity, not
a luxury.
In this unsustainable tension
between elite universities strug
gling to get their students to
think outside the box and elite
students struggling to be the best
at filling boxes in, something has
to give. Both sides have some
work to do.
Students should recognize that

deep engagement with learning
as an end in itself, rather than a
means to future success, is the
best guarantee of future success.
In an era of globalization and
breakneck competition, the intel
lectual leaders of tomorrow will
be thinkers capable of drawing
connections between disciplines,
engaging with several planes of
thought at once, reasoning cre
atively rather than applying old
formulae to ever-shifting prob
lems. As former Harvard presi
dent Larry Summers pointed out
in the New York Times, instant ac
cess to factual knowledge via the

Internet is gradually rendering
fact-based learning less impor
tant; the best doctors and lawyers
of tomorrow will rely less and less
on memorized bits of law or
anatomy.
But elite universities should
also be more open about the pres
ence of rampant pre-profession
alism in the ranks, even if for no
other reason than to combat it
more effectively. Pretending it
doesn't exist does no one any fa
vors.

prepare its students for eventual
professional careers even as it
almost by definition attracts the
students most qualified for, and
dedicated to pursuing, eventual
professional careers. This contra
diction, while in many senses in
evitable, also has a host of nega
tive consequences that both elite
universities and their students
need to acknowledge and address.
One will search the undergrad
uate catalogues at Harvard,
Princeton, Yale, Columbia and
our very own Stanford in vain for
majors in pre-law, pre-med, pre
dental, pre-veterinary, pre-physi
cal therapy and the like. One in
stead finds anthropology, history,
mathematics, biology, chemistry
the pure subjects, unsullied by
the tainted aura of vocational
training. The closest nascent in
vestment bankers can come to fi
nance is economics, while aspiring
CEOs looking for a business
major will have to be satisfied
with management science and en
gineering.
That is far from the case at
most public universities in Ameri
ca. Nearly all state schools allow
their students to begin prepara
tion for a post-university profes
sional career immediately upon
entrance, with majors in pre-law,
nursing or business open to stu
dents with a well-defined sense of
their own future.
Stanford, like other elite pri
vate universities, eschews that
model, for mostly good reasons.
The purpose of a liberal arts edu
cation, after all, is to cultivate in its
graduates a thorough foundation

in the arts and sciences; to instill
its students with the ability to rea
son and analyze critically; to equip
its inchoate scholars with facilities
of broad learning, rather than nar
row factual knowledge and mem
orized technical skills. Single
mindedly pursuing a career from
the moment one sets foot on cam
pus closes innumerable avenues
of fruitful learning, precluding the
opportunity for sustained, mean
ingful engagement with literature,
philosophy and the lessons of his
tory.
But Stanford's approach to
learning has its drawbacks too.
One of them is the hypocrisy
and doubletalk it engenders
among elite students, most of
whom got here by always thinking
about the step ahead. The implicit
cultural shadow the elite universi
ty model casts upon pre-profes
sionalism discourages an open ac
knowledgment of future career
goals among the students most
likely to be heatedly pursuing
them behind the scenes. The result
is a sort of mutant variant on the
famous Stanford duck syndrome,
in which some students quack
loudly about deep intellectual
thoughts on the surface while
paddling furiously toward career
goals underwater.
You may recognize this syn
drome's symptoms: the pre-med
who feigns scholarly interest in
the material from lecture when
talking to his TA, but really just
wants the problem set answers so
he can scrape an A- on the
midterm; the apparent Econ en
thusiast who'll forget everything
she learned in the 50-series as
soon as she gets the summer in
ternship at Goldman; the PoliSci
major with her eyes on the profes

sor but her mind on law school.
There are more specific, less
nebulous reasons to worry about
this model as well. One of them
stems from elite education's
upper-crust origins in the world of
silver spoons and the Social Regis
ter, Downton Abbey and Skull
and Bones a world in which
universities conferred culture and
class, rather than added economic
or professional value, simply be
cause their students could afford
not to worry about it. For students
whose trust funds will make up
the difference between a degree
in finance and one in eighteenth
century French literature, pre

In this unsustainable tension

its general refusal to explicitly
