## SURPRISE SWEEP BLANDINO'S THREE HOMERS PROPEL CARDINAL 
### PALANI ESWARAN STAFF WRITER 
This weekend couldn't have been much
more successful for the No. 10 Stanford base
ball team, which swept the No. 20 Arizona
State Sun Devils thanks to strong hitting from
freshman third baseman Alex Blandino.
Blandino led Stanford (25-10,8-7 Pac-12)
by going 8-for-13 with three home runs and
nine RBI on the weekend. The Palo Alto na

tive is now hitting .350, and for Sunday's game
head coach Mark Marquess had Blandino in
the cleanup spot, showing that he has become
one of the most clutch and capable hitters in
an extremely talented lineup.
"I'm just trying to hit good pitches, react,
not do too much," Blandino said of his recent
approach at the plate. "I've been trying to get
on pitches up in the zone and get the ball up."
The other story for the Cardinal was its re
vived offensive prowess. Prior to this series

Stanford had scored just eight times in its past
four games, but in the three games against the
Sun Devils the team put up a staggering 34
runs.
"It really just came down to our ap
proach," Blandino said. "We weren't chasing
balls early in the count or forcing it. We were
in a lot of hitter's counts."
"This is the first weekend that we hit like

Freshman third baseman Alex Blandino, once a rarely used alternate, solidified his position in the lineup this weekend with three home runs and
nine crucial RBI. Blandino now has a team-leading .350 batting average, though he has only half the at-bats of most of his fellow starters.
that in league play," Marquess
added.

Friday's game seemed like it
would be a low-scoring pitching
duel between aces Brady Rodgers
for Arizona State and Mark Appel
for Stanford. Coming into the
matchup, Rodgers had an impres
sive 1.12 ERA, and each pitcher
had lost just one game all season.
Appel looked solid from the
beginning; his fastball came in at
97 miles per hour and his slider
was working the plate beautifully.
But in the fourth inning the Stan
ford righty hit a rough patch, giv
ing up two hits, two walks and
three runs.

"What really hurt me were the
two walks to lead off the inning,"
Appel said. "After that I just tried
to settle down. They got a few hits,
but I really just have to take it
pitch by pitch."
After the fourth Appel did set
tle down, tossing two more score
less innings.
Stanford's bats really started to
come alive in the fifth. Tyler
Gaffney hit a bloop single to tie up
the game at three apiece, and after
a walk, an error and a sac fly the
Cardinal was up 5-3. In the sixth,
Gaffney walked with bases
loaded, and a passed ball by Sun
Devil catcher Max Rossiter and a
base hit by Brian Ragira extended
Stanford's lead to 9-3.
Stanford scored four runs in
seventh inning with three of
them coming on Blandino's sec
ond home run of the evening
and four more in the eighth, and
the contest ended with the Cardi

nal in front 17-5, its greatest mar
gin of victory since a 19-6 win at
Cal on April 9.
Saturday's game was much
more competitive than Friday's
blowout. Redshirt junior starting
pitcher Brett Mooneyham went
six solid innings, giving up three
runs to the Sun Devils.
In the bottom of the sixth
Blandino hit another three-run
homer and the Cardinal was up 7-
3 going into the seventh. But Ari
zona State knotted things up at
seven with a three-run top of the
seventh and a game-tying double
with two outs in the ninth.
In the bottom of the ninth a
pair of juniors came through for
Stanford, as catcher Eric Smith
and shortstop Kenny Diekroger
hit a pair of one-out singles. A fly
ball by Wilson advanced Smith to
third, and Blandino sent a single
down the third-base line to win
the game for the Cardinal.
Sunday's game did not start off
as well for Stanford. Arizona
State's first two hitters got on base
and leftfielder James McDonald
drove in a run.

Despite the early deficit, Stan
ford bounced back. With the bases
loaded in the bottom of the third,
recently converted leftfielder
Stephen Piscotty singled, sending
home Wilson and sophomore sec
ond baseman Brett Michael
Doran.

In the top of the fifth, the Sun
Devils put together a rally of their
own, scoring three runs. The
Card's defense looked extremely
shaky in that half-inning, as the
newly retooled Stanford infield,
which lost sophomore shortstop
Lonnie Kauppila to a season-end
ing knee injury last weekend,
missed plays that have normally
been very crisp.

But in the bottom half of the in
ning, Stanford answered the Dev
ils' attack. Piscotty and Blandino
got on base with no outs, and a Ra
gira single tied up the game at 4-4.
Later in the inning Wilson sent
Ragira home on a base hit and
Stanford took a one-run lead. A
wild pitch in the sixth increased
the Cardinal's advantage to two.
In the top of the seventh Ari
zona State scored, cutting Stan
ford's lead to 6-5, but sophomore
lefty Garrett Hughes got the Car
dinal out of the inning before any
more damage could be done.
Sweeping the Sun Devils was
huge for Stanford, which prior to
this weekend had been 5-7 in the
Pac-12. Stanford had recently lost
two out of three to Oregon and
had been upset at home by San
Jose State on Tuesday.
"League play is difficult," Mar
quess said. "Everybody is capable
of beating anybody else on a given
weekend. You've just got to get
timely hitting, and you can't make
errors or give them a lot of bases
on balls. If you do that then you
have a chance to win any series."
The one cause for concern for
Stanford going forward may be its
fielding. The Cardinal committed
seven errors over the weekend.
Fortunately, Arizona State com
mitted six errors and also played
poorly in the field, but the team
will have to improve its fielding if
it hopes to have success the rest of
the season because it cannot af
ford to give teams extra baserun
ners and extra outs.
Next up for Stanford is BYU.
The Cardinal will face the
Cougars on Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond.

Lonnie Kauppila to a season-end
ing knee injury last weekend,
missed plays that have normally
been very crisp.

But in the bottom half of the in
ning, Stanford answered the Dev
ils' attack. Piscotty and Blandino
got on base with no outs, and a Ra
gira single tied up the game at 4-4.
Later in the inning Wilson sent
Ragira home on a base hit and
Stanford took a one-run lead. A
wild pitch in the sixth increased
the Cardinal's advantage to two.
In the top of the seventh Ari
zona State scored, cutting Stan
ford's lead to 6-5, but sophomore
lefty Garrett Hughes got the Car
dinal out of the inning before any
more damage could be done.
Sweeping the Sun Devils was
huge for Stanford, which prior to
this weekend had been 5-7 in the
Pac-12. Stanford had recently lost
two out of three to Oregon and
had been upset at home by San
Jose State on Tuesday.
"League play is difficult," Mar
quess said. "Everybody is capable
of beating anybody else on a given
weekend. You've just got to get
timely hitting, and you can't make
errors or give them a lot of bases
on balls. If you do that then you
have a chance to win any series."
The one cause for concern for
Stanford going forward may be its
fielding. The Cardinal committed
seven errors over the weekend.
Fortunately, Arizona State com
mitted six errors and also played
poorly in the field, but the team
will have to improve its fielding if
it hopes to have success the rest of
the season because it cannot af
ford to give teams extra baserun
ners and extra outs.
Next up for Stanford is BYU.
The Cardinal will face the
Cougars on Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond.

This weekend couldn't have been much
more successful for the No. 10 Stanford base
ball team, which swept the No. 20 Arizona
State Sun Devils thanks to strong hitting from
freshman third baseman Alex Blandino.
Blandino led Stanford (25-10,8-7 Pac-12)
by going 8-for-13 with three home runs and
nine RBI on the weekend. The Palo Alto na

tive is now hitting .350, and for Sunday's game
head coach Mark Marquess had Blandino in
the cleanup spot, showing that he has become
one of the most clutch and capable hitters in
an extremely talented lineup.
"I'm just trying to hit good pitches, react,
not do too much," Blandino said of his recent
approach at the plate. "I've been trying to get
on pitches up in the zone and get the ball up."
The other story for the Cardinal was its re
vived offensive prowess. Prior to this series

Stanford had scored just eight times in its past
four games, but in the three games against the
Sun Devils the team put up a staggering 34
runs.
"It really just came down to our ap
proach," Blandino said. "We weren't chasing
balls early in the count or forcing it. We were
in a lot of hitter's counts."
"This is the first weekend that we hit like

Freshman third baseman Alex Blandino, once a rarely used alternate, solidified his position in the lineup this weekend with three home runs and
nine crucial RBI. Blandino now has a team-leading .350 batting average, though he has only half the at-bats of most of his fellow starters.
that in league play," Marquess
added.

Friday's game seemed like it
would be a low-scoring pitching
duel between aces Brady Rodgers
for Arizona State and Mark Appel
for Stanford. Coming into the
matchup, Rodgers had an impres
sive 1.12 ERA, and each pitcher
had lost just one game all season.
Appel looked solid from the
beginning; his fastball came in at
97 miles per hour and his slider
was working the plate beautifully.
But in the fourth inning the Stan
ford righty hit a rough patch, giv
ing up two hits, two walks and
three runs.

"What really hurt me were the
two walks to lead off the inning,"
Appel said. "After that I just tried
to settle down. They got a few hits,
but I really just have to take it
pitch by pitch."
After the fourth Appel did set
tle down, tossing two more score
less innings.
Stanford's bats really started to
come alive in the fifth. Tyler
Gaffney hit a bloop single to tie up
the game at three apiece, and after
a walk, an error and a sac fly the
Cardinal was up 5-3. In the sixth,
Gaffney walked with bases
loaded, and a passed ball by Sun
Devil catcher Max Rossiter and a
base hit by Brian Ragira extended
Stanford's lead to 9-3.
Stanford scored four runs in
seventh inning with three of
them coming on Blandino's sec
ond home run of the evening
and four more in the eighth, and
the contest ended with the Cardi

nal in front 17-5, its greatest mar
gin of victory since a 19-6 win at
Cal on April 9.
Saturday's game was much
more competitive than Friday's
blowout. Redshirt junior starting
pitcher Brett Mooneyham went
six solid innings, giving up three
runs to the Sun Devils.
In the bottom of the sixth
Blandino hit another three-run
homer and the Cardinal was up 7-
3 going into the seventh. But Ari
zona State knotted things up at
seven with a three-run top of the
seventh and a game-tying double
with two outs in the ninth.
In the bottom of the ninth a
pair of juniors came through for
Stanford, as catcher Eric Smith
and shortstop Kenny Diekroger
hit a pair of one-out singles. A fly
ball by Wilson advanced Smith to
third, and Blandino sent a single
down the third-base line to win
the game for the Cardinal.
Sunday's game did not start off
as well for Stanford. Arizona
State's first two hitters got on base
and leftfielder James McDonald
drove in a run.

Despite the early deficit, Stan
ford bounced back. With the bases
loaded in the bottom of the third,
recently converted leftfielder
Stephen Piscotty singled, sending
home Wilson and sophomore sec
ond baseman Brett Michael
Doran.

In the top of the fifth, the Sun
Devils put together a rally of their
own, scoring three runs. The
Card's defense looked extremely
shaky in that half-inning, as the
newly retooled Stanford infield,
which lost sophomore shortstop
Lonnie Kauppila to a season-end
ing knee injury last weekend,
missed plays that have normally
been very crisp.

But in the bottom half of the in
