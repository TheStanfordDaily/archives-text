## Closing out the Bears CARD BEATS CAL TO CAP SEASON 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Despite some struggles early
on, the No. 12 Stanford men's
tennis team finished its regular
season schedule on a high note
Friday with a comfortable 5-2
victory at No. 14 Cal.
The win completed a season
sweep of the rival Golden Bears
by the Cardinal (16-7, 5-2 Pac
-12) following a 6-1 victory in
the annual Big Slam match in
February and extended Stan
ford's overall winning streak
against Cal to five matches.
Following close on the heels
of last Wednesday's dominant 7-
0 victory over Pacific, the road
win also further builds momen
tum for the Cardinal in advance
of the inaugural Pac-12 tourna
ment, which starts this Wednes
day in Ojai, Calif. The victory
over the Golden Bears (11-10,4-
3 Pac-12) secured a third place
finish in the conference for Stan
ford, and thus the tournament's
No. 3 seed.
"This last week of the season
was crucial in generating posi
tive momentum heading into
Pac-12s and the NCAAs, espe
cially after such a tough week in
L.A.," said senior Bradley
Klahn, referring to the Cardi
nal's heavy losses to No. 1 USC
(7-0) and No. 9 UCLA (6-1) on
April 14 and 15. "I think our
team learned a lot from that
weekend, though, and it is our
job now to take that experience
and turn it into something
great."
Having shuffled the Cardi
nal's doubles lineup for the
match against Pacific, head
coach John Whitlinger contin
ued the tactic against Cal. The
Cardinal, however, struggled to
maintain its previous success,
dropping two matches and con
ceding the first point to the
Golden Bears.
"Cal is always a big rivalry
for us, and we knew going in that
we had to be prepared for a bat
tle," Klahn said. "Our team re
sponded exceptionally well to
the challenges presented, espe
cially losing the doubles point."
In singles play, Stanford and
Cal initially swapped points
with Klahn's 6-3,6-4 victory can
celled out by junior Denis Lin's
6-1, 6-2 defeat before the
Cardinal pulled away to claim
the last four singles matches.
Junior Matt Kandath and fresh
man John Morrissey pulled off 6-
2, 6-4 and 6-4, 6-3 wins, respec
tively, before senior Ryan
Thacher battled to a clinching
victory in three sets (3-6, 6-1,6-
4). Sophomore Daniel Ho
rounded out the win with a 7-5,
3-6,7-6 (4) triumph.
"It was great to see Danny
fight back in the third set from
down two breaks [at 4-I], even
after the match had been
clinched," Klahn said. "His ef
fort showed a lot about his abili
ty to gut out a tough match, but
more importantly showed our
resiliency as an entire team to
stay determined and not be sat
isfied with any of our achieve
ments."

For Klahn and Thacher, the
match also marked the final reg
ular-season game of their Stan
ford careers. The seniors have
put together outstanding ca
reers for the Cardinal, collecting
eight doubles titles as a pair
while leading the Cardinal to
three straight NCAA tourna
ment appearances. Klahn also
won the 2010 NCAA singles
championship.
"It's hard to believe that my
last regular season at Stanford
has finished," Klahn said. "I am
excited to begin my last postsea
son, and to see our team lay
everything out there for the five
weeks. There is still much for
this team to accomplish, but I
think we have a great founda

tion with the determination and
work ethic. Now it is simply just
about executing our game plan."
The Cardinal will receive a
first-round bye in this week's Pac
-12 tournament, and will face the

winner of the match between the
No. 6 and 7 seeds (which have yet
to be determined) on Thursday.

put together outstanding ca
reers for the Cardinal, collecting
eight doubles titles as a pair
while leading the Cardinal to
three straight NCAA tourna
ment appearances. Klahn also
won the 2010 NCAA singles
championship.
"It's hard to believe that my
last regular season at Stanford
has finished," Klahn said. "I am
excited to begin my last postsea
son, and to see our team lay
everything out there for the five
weeks. There is still much for
this team to accomplish, but I
think we have a great founda

tion with the determination and
work ethic. Now it is simply just
about executing our game plan."
The Cardinal will receive a
first-round bye in this week's Pac
-12 tournament, and will face the

winner of the match between the
No. 6 and 7 seeds (which have yet
to be determined) on Thursday.

Senior Ryan Thacher closed out his regular-season career for Stanford
on a high note, battling back from a first-set loss to win his singles match
3-6,6-1,6-4 and clinch the Cardinal's win at Cal. Thacher and former
NCAA singles champion Bradley Klahn will be sorely missed next year.
Despite some struggles early
on, the No. 12 Stanford men's
tennis team finished its regular
season schedule on a high note
Friday with a comfortable 5-2
victory at No. 14 Cal.
The win completed a season
sweep of the rival Golden Bears
by the Cardinal (16-7, 5-2 Pac
-12) following a 6-1 victory in
the annual Big Slam match in
February and extended Stan
ford's overall winning streak
against Cal to five matches.
Following close on the heels
of last Wednesday's dominant 7-
0 victory over Pacific, the road
win also further builds momen
tum for the Cardinal in advance
of the inaugural Pac-12 tourna
ment, which starts this Wednes
day in Ojai, Calif. The victory
over the Golden Bears (11-10,4-
3 Pac-12) secured a third place
finish in the conference for Stan
ford, and thus the tournament's
No. 3 seed.
"This last week of the season
was crucial in generating posi
tive momentum heading into
Pac-12s and the NCAAs, espe
cially after such a tough week in
L.A.," said senior Bradley
Klahn, referring to the Cardi
nal's heavy losses to No. 1 USC
(7-0) and No. 9 UCLA (6-1) on
April 14 and 15. "I think our
team learned a lot from that
weekend, though, and it is our
job now to take that experience
and turn it into something
great."
Having shuffled the Cardi
nal's doubles lineup for the
match against Pacific, head
coach John Whitlinger contin
ued the tactic against Cal. The
Cardinal, however, struggled to
maintain its previous success,
dropping two matches and con
ceding the first point to the
Golden Bears.
"Cal is always a big rivalry
for us, and we knew going in that
we had to be prepared for a bat
tle," Klahn said. "Our team re
sponded exceptionally well to
the challenges presented, espe
cially losing the doubles point."
In singles play, Stanford and
Cal initially swapped points
with Klahn's 6-3,6-4 victory can
celled out by junior Denis Lin's
6-1, 6-2 defeat before the
Cardinal pulled away to claim
the last four singles matches.
Junior Matt Kandath and fresh
man John Morrissey pulled off 6-
2, 6-4 and 6-4, 6-3 wins, respec
tively, before senior Ryan
Thacher battled to a clinching
victory in three sets (3-6, 6-1,6-
4). Sophomore Daniel Ho
rounded out the win with a 7-5,
3-6,7-6 (4) triumph.
"It was great to see Danny
fight back in the third set from
down two breaks [at 4-I], even
after the match had been
clinched," Klahn said. "His ef
fort showed a lot about his abili
ty to gut out a tough match, but
more importantly showed our
resiliency as an entire team to
stay determined and not be sat
isfied with any of our achieve
ments."

For Klahn and Thacher, the
match also marked the final reg
ular-season game of their Stan
ford careers. The seniors have
put together outstanding ca
reers for the Cardinal, collecting
eight doubles titles as a pair
while leading the Cardinal to
three straight NCAA tourna
ment appearances. Klahn also
won the 2010 NCAA singles
championship.
"It's hard to believe that my
last regular season at Stanford
has finished," Klahn said. "I am
excited to begin my last postsea
son, and to see our team lay
everything out there for the five
weeks. There is still much for
this team to accomplish, but I
think we have a great founda

tion with the determination and
work ethic. Now it is simply just
