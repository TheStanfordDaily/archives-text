## Closing out the Bears CARD BEATS CAL TO CAP SEASON 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Despite some struggles early
on, the No. 12 Stanford men's
tennis team finished its regular
season schedule on a high note
Friday with a comfortable 5-2
victory at No. 14 Cal.
The win completed a season
sweep of the rival Golden Bears
by the Cardinal (16-7, 5-2 Pac
-12) following a 6-1 victory in
the annual Big Slam match in
February and extended Stan
ford's overall winning streak
against Cal to five matches.
Following close on the heels
of last Wednesday's dominant 7-
0 victory over Pacific, the road
win also further builds momen
tum for the Cardinal in advance
of the inaugural Pac-12 tourna
ment, which starts this Wednes
day in Ojai, Calif. The victory
over the Golden Bears (11-10,4-
3 Pac-12) secured a third place
finish in the conference for Stan
ford, and thus the tournament's
No. 3 seed.
"This last week of the season
was crucial in generating posi
tive momentum heading into
Pac-12s and the NCAAs, espe
cially after such a tough week in
L.A.," said senior Bradley
Klahn, referring to the Cardi
nal's heavy losses to No. 1 USC
(7-0) and No. 9 UCLA (6-1) on
April 14 and 15. "I think our
team learned a lot from that
weekend, though, and it is our
job now to take that experience
