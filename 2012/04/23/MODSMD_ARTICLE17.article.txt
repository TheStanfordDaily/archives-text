# Moving on in MPSFs
## LAWSON KEY TO FIRST-ROUND WIN 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
A year ago, outside hitter
Brad Lawson's 27 kills weren't
enough to prevent Stanford
from being eliminated in five
sets at home in the first round of
the MPSF tournament.
Lawson may have only mus
tered 22 kills in the conference
tourney opener this time
around, but the senior's efforts
were more than enough to get
the No. 3 Cardinal to the semifi
nals in its 25-23,25-17,23-25,25-
17 victory over No. 9 Pepper
dine at Maples Pavilion on Sat
urday. He set the school record
for kills (1,788) in the rally-scor
ing era in the process, propelling
Stanford (21-7,17-5 MPSF) past
the Waves (14-15,9-13) with his
.514 hitting percentage.
Sophomores Brian Cook,
Steven Irvin and Eric Mochalski
were in double-figures in kills as
well and helped the Cardinal
avoid another first-round upset.
In a back-and-forth first set,
neither team had more than a
two-point advantage until Pep
perdine jumped out to a 16-13
lead and forced a Stanford time
out. The Cardinal quickly
bounced back to knot things up
at 18, and grabbed a three-point
lead of its own on a Lawson kill,
an error by senior blocker Matt
Pollock and a Lawson block.
Stanford led the rest of the
way, and a kill from sophomore
hitter Steven Irvin clinched the
opening set.


ROGER CHEN/The Stanford Daily
Senior outside hitter Brad Lawson set the Stanford record for kills in
the rally-scoring era at 1,788, and his .514 hitting percentage was
crucial in the Cardinal's four-set win over Pepperdine on Saturday.
The Cardinal cruised to a 10-3
second-set lead and didn't look
back, going wire-to-wire and
earning its 24th and 25th points
on a pair of service errors. The
Waves slightly out-served Stan
ford with 11 service errors to the
Cardinal's 14, but Pepperdine's
sloppy end to the second set put
Stanford firmly in the driver's
seat.

The Waves responded by
grabbing an 8-5 lead to start the
third set. Stanford had five
straight points to regain control
of the match, but a strong finish
by Pepperdine — which trailed
19-17 at one point kept it alive,
and freshman Matt Tarantino's
block off Irwin ended the set at
25-23 to give the Waves a shot at
the comeback.

Pepperdine hung in the fourth
set until 7-6, when a kill and a
block from Lawson and two er
rors by Tarantino created some
separation for Stanford on the
scoreboard. Senior Evan Barry
also playing in his last game
on the Farm punched the Car
dinal's ticket to the second round
with his block at 24-17.

Things will only get harder for
Stanford, with the top four teams
in the country all still alive in the
MPSF semifinals. Fortunately for
the Cardinal, the squad gets to
play No. 4 BYU first while No. 1
USC and No. 2 UC-Irvine duke it
out in the other semifinal; Stan
ford beat the Cougars twice in as
many days in Utah in early Feb

ruary, while it only has recorded
one win against the other two re
maining squads, a 3-0 victory at
Irvine on Feb. 17.
The Cardinal meets BYU at
USC's Galen Center on Thurs
day at 5 p.m.
