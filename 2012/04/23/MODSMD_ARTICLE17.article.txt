# Moving on in MPSFs
## LAWSON KEY TO FIRST-ROUND WIN 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
A year ago, outside hitter
Brad Lawson's 27 kills weren't
enough to prevent Stanford
from being eliminated in five
sets at home in the first round of
the MPSF tournament.
Lawson may have only mus
tered 22 kills in the conference
tourney opener this time
around, but the senior's efforts
were more than enough to get
the No. 3 Cardinal to the semifi
nals in its 25-23,25-17,23-25,25-
17 victory over No. 9 Pepper
dine at Maples Pavilion on Sat
urday. He set the school record
for kills (1,788) in the rally-scor
ing era in the process, propelling
Stanford (21-7,17-5 MPSF) past
the Waves (14-15,9-13) with his
.514 hitting percentage.
Sophomores Brian Cook,
Steven Irvin and Eric Mochalski
were in double-figures in kills as
well and helped the Cardinal
avoid another first-round upset.
In a back-and-forth first set,
neither team had more than a
two-point advantage until Pep
perdine jumped out to a 16-13
lead and forced a Stanford time
out. The Cardinal quickly
bounced back to knot things up
at 18, and grabbed a three-point
lead of its own on a Lawson kill,
an error by senior blocker Matt
Pollock and a Lawson block.
Stanford led the rest of the
way, and a kill from sophomore
hitter Steven Irvin clinched the
opening set.


ROGER CHEN/The Stanford Daily
Senior outside hitter Brad Lawson set the Stanford record for kills in
the rally-scoring era at 1,788, and his .514 hitting percentage was
crucial in the Cardinal's four-set win over Pepperdine on Saturday.
