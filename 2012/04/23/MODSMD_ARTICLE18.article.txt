# Card back to being dominant
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Slat on the Back 
Well that's more like
it. After a woeful
stretch where
runs seemed to
come with the fre
quency of Halley's comet, the Stan
ford baseball team found its offense
this weekend in a much-needed
sweep of Arizona State.
I'll be the first to admit that I did
not see this coming. I honestly did
not think the Cardinal would be
able to even scratch out one win
against the Sun Devils this week
end. Think about it: Stanford had
gone just 3-7 in its past 10 confer
ence games, and if the Cardinal
couldn't beat San Jose State, how
could it hope to beat perennial Col
lege World Series contender Ari
zona State? And despite the fact
that ASU is banned from postsea
son play this year, the 2012 Sun Dev
ils are still formidable. Arizona State
had won five in a row and eight of
nine coming into the game and sat
just six spots below Stanford in the
national rankings.
Well, the Cardinal proved me
(and a whole lot of people) wrong
by winning all three games. And
these weren't just lucky bounces.
These were we're-every-bit-as
good-as-you-thought-we-were
wins. Which, for the rest of the na
tion and particularly the rest of the
Pac-12, is very unwelcome news.
In Arizona State's first 15 confer
ence games of the year, the Sun
Devils allowed only 38 runs while
going 9-6. In just three games
against Stanford, the Sun Devils al
lowed 34 runs while going 0-3. Ari
zona State came in with a team
ERA of 2.6s,putting ASU in the top
five pitching staffs in the country.
After one series with Stanford, that
ERA is up to 3.53, meaning ASU is
no longer even in the top five pitch
ing staffs in the conference.
It all started on Friday, when the
Cardinal had to match up against
Sun Devil righthander Brady
Rodgers, whose sparkling numbers
gave him a case for being the best
pitcher in the nation. Rodgers had
an incredible 55-to-7 strikeout-to
walk ratio and the sixth-best ERA
in the country, an unbelievable 1.13.
He had allowed nine earned runs in
nine starts and had gone at least
eight innings in each of his past
seven outings.
Stanford smacked Rodgers
around to the tune of eight runs, six
of them earned, in a season-low 5.1
innings. So naturally, Arizona State
head coach Tim Esmay took him
out, allowing the bullpen to give up
another nine runs in the next 2.2 in
nings. Yep, after scoring eight runs
total in its past four games, the Stan
ford offense scored 17 in one game
against one of the best starters in the
nation and some of the top relievers
in the conference.
Any team can have a good game
every so often (although few could
have that good of a game against
those guys), but what is really heart
ening for Stanford fans is how the
Cardinal followed up the big
blowout on Friday with two more
wins.
On Saturday, Stanford was
locked in a close duel with the Sun
Devils. The game was tied 2-2, 3-3
and 7-7, the last of which came in the
ninth inning. But with two outs in
the bottom of the ninth, Alex
Blandino came through with a
clutch RBI single to give Stanford
the walk-off win.
Blandino, a freshman from a
stone's throw away in Palo Alto, has
gone from occasional late-inning
fill-in to occasional starter to major
contributor to big-time star in the
past few weeks. And although this
weekend's sweep was a team effort,
Blandino was undoubtedly the star
of the show.
Thanks to injuries to Lonnie
Kauppila and Jake Stewart, Blandi
no found himself starting the week
at third base. And despite entering
the week with only 44 collegiate at
bats, Blandino made the most of his
playing time. On Tuesday he had a
two-run homer, his third of the sea
son, to account for Stanford's only
two runs in a loss to San Jose State. In
the demolition on Friday, he hit two
monster homers to left, driving in
four runs and scoring four himself.
On Saturday, he hit another home
run to go with his walk-off hit. And
on Sunday, he was the only Cardinal
player with more than one hit as he
