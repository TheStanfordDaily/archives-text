## Splash expands student outreach Over 2,000 students attend classes; admission newly governed by lottery 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
More than 2,000 students, mostly
from local middle and high schools, at
tended the approximately 350 classes
offered by the Stanford Educational
Studies Program's biannual Splash pro
gram, which took place this past week
end.
The classes, taught exclusively by
Stanford faculty, graduate students and
undergraduates, included subjects such
as "The Evolution of Evolution,"

"Speaking of Blueberries: An Improv
Comedy Class," and "Harry Potter Ex
travaganza," in which students were
taught how to play Quidditch.
The Splash administrative team said
they made a large push this time around
to recruit more underserved students to
attend the classes.

"We ramped up our underserved stu
dent recruitment effort this Splash,"
said Spencer Boucher, a research assis
tant at the Stanford Center for Interdis
ciplinary Brain Sciences and a member
of the Splash administrative team. "Ten
busloads of students who otherwise
wouldn't have been able to make it were
provided transportation in addition to
having their fees waived."
According to Boucher, schools

served included Aspire Academy, Light
house Community Academy and Im
pact Academy.
A new implementation for this
spring's Splash program was a lottery
system for class sign-ups, which replaced
the old first-come, first-served sign-up
system.
"While some parents were unhappy
with the new system, it made it fairer to
underserved students who may not have
24-hour access to Internet service," said
Splash co-director Aditya Todi 'l4.
The event was moved from the Main
Quad to Lomita Mall this year, reflect
ing concern for disabled students who
might have a hard time accessing
the Quad directly from the stu
dent registration and lunch sites.
The Splash administrative
team said one of the main chal
lenges this year was directing the
new traffic flow, as well as the
longer distance for set-up of
lunch and student registration.
The Splash team gave out
water bottles and t-shirts for the
volunteers, as well as to the
teachers, who were invited to an
appreciation dinner later in the
weekend.
"ft helped me understand how
difficult but rewarding teaching
is," said Christina Wang 'l5, who
served as one of the Splash teach
ers. "It really teaches how partic
ipation in class is important."
Reflecting on this year's suc
cess, Michael Si, Splash financial
officer, recommended another
change for the future. He said he

hopes the group's web team
might employ an online reim
bursement system for Splash
teachers to replace the current
paper receipt submission system
for the cost of supplies and class
materials.
"This way we can go paperless
and the process can be accelerat
ed, making it easy and fast for
both parties," Si said.
Along with Stanford Splash,
the educational non-profit
Learning Unlimited sponsors 15
other Splash programs around
the country, at sites including the
University of Colorado, Duke
University, the Massachusetts In
stitute for Technology and Yale
University.
"Stanford is on the frontlines
of a national movement," said
Chris Kennedy, coordinator of
new chapter development for
Learning Unlimited. "It's the sec
ond largest Splash in the country
and growing faster in recruitment
of students and teachers."
