# Trustees pass funding for new center
## Board signs off on 4.2 million for 'contemplation center' 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Board of Trustees approved $4.2
million for a new "contemplation center" at its re
cent spring meeting. The annual gathering was held
in Monterey from April 15 to 17 to discuss two main
topics: undergraduate education and the Stanford
Challenge.
The Land and Buildings Committee met before
the retreat, resulting in two action items then raised
at the trustees meeting.
According to Board of Trustees Chair Leslie
Hume '7l Ph.D '79, the first action item was concept
and site approval of the proposed 4,000 square-foot
Windover Contemplation Center at the intersection
of Lomita and Santa Teresa. The center will feature
paintings by the late Nathan Oliveira, former profes
sor of art at Stanford.
"It will be a place where people can sit and con
template and look at these beautiful, enormous
paintings by Oliveira," Hume said. "From the slides
we saw at this presentation of his paintings, and from
reading about the origins of these paintings, it's
going to be a wonderful thing to have."
The board will consider design approval of the
contemplation center in October, and construction
approval is scheduled for June 2013.
The second action item concerned piping and build
ing conversions to accommodate changes from steam
to hot water for Stanford's Central Energy Facility.
The board was prompted to discuss undergradu
ate education after the release of the SUES report
earlier this year. Before this meeting, Vice Provost
Harry Elam had not had the opportunity to speak
about his plans for changes in undergraduate educa
tion in front of the entire board. Elam, along with
Senior Associate Vice Provost Martha Cyert and a
panel of three faculty members, spoke to the board
about the vision of undergraduate education moving
forward, specifically the introduction of Thinking
Matters courses and a potential Introductory Semi
nar requirement.
"Harry walked us through, in some depth, all the
different aspects of the SUES report and the pro-
