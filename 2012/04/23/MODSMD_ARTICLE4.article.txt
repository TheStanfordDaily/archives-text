# Trustees pass funding for new center
## Board signs off on 4.2 million for 'contemplation center' 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Board of Trustees approved $4.2
million for a new "contemplation center" at its re
cent spring meeting. The annual gathering was held
in Monterey from April 15 to 17 to discuss two main
topics: undergraduate education and the Stanford
Challenge.
The Land and Buildings Committee met before
the retreat, resulting in two action items then raised
at the trustees meeting.
According to Board of Trustees Chair Leslie
Hume '7l Ph.D '79, the first action item was concept
and site approval of the proposed 4,000 square-foot
Windover Contemplation Center at the intersection
of Lomita and Santa Teresa. The center will feature
paintings by the late Nathan Oliveira, former profes
sor of art at Stanford.
"It will be a place where people can sit and con
template and look at these beautiful, enormous
paintings by Oliveira," Hume said. "From the slides
we saw at this presentation of his paintings, and from
reading about the origins of these paintings, it's
going to be a wonderful thing to have."
The board will consider design approval of the
contemplation center in October, and construction
approval is scheduled for June 2013.
The second action item concerned piping and build
ing conversions to accommodate changes from steam
to hot water for Stanford's Central Energy Facility.
The board was prompted to discuss undergradu
ate education after the release of the SUES report
earlier this year. Before this meeting, Vice Provost
Harry Elam had not had the opportunity to speak
about his plans for changes in undergraduate educa
tion in front of the entire board. Elam, along with
Senior Associate Vice Provost Martha Cyert and a
panel of three faculty members, spoke to the board
about the vision of undergraduate education moving
forward, specifically the introduction of Thinking
Matters courses and a potential Introductory Semi
nar requirement.
"Harry walked us through, in some depth, all the
different aspects of the SUES report and the pro-
grams and initiatives he has intro
duced," Hume said. "The board
was particularly excited by the ef
fort to integrate all aspects of stu
dents' learning, inside and outside
the classroom the effort to real
ly focus on engaging students ear
lier on in their time at Stanford."
Elam and Cyert discussed the
opportunity to use residences as a
way to broaden students' learning
experiences by having more facul
ty interaction in the residences or
having rooms in dorms specifically
for art projects and music.
"For the next few years, there
are going to be a lot of experi
ments, and one of the key things is
to address early on how you're
going to assess these initiatives
and decide what you really want to
continue," Hume said. "So I think
it's going to be a really interesting
time in undergraduate education."
The board also discussed The
Stanford Challenge, which raised
$6.2 billion for the University and
which Hume called "the most suc
cessful comprehensive campaign
in Stanford's history."

Vice President for Develop
ment Martin Shell led the board in
examining the quantitative and
qualitative outcomes of the
fundraising campaign that con
cluded at the close of 2011. Associ
ate Vice President for Strategic
Planning Roberta Katz and Dean
of the School of Earth Sciences
Pam Matson discussed initiatives
and challenges in moving forward.
The board also toured the
Hopkins Marine Station for the
first time as part of their retreat
and listened to Hopkins Executive
Director Steve Polumbi and three
graduate students, who shared
their research. Hume called the
station "a gem" for both under
graduate and graduate research.
