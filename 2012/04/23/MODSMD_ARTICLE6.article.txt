## She++ conference emboldens women in CS 
### KENJI HATA 
Females make up 57 percent
of the U.S. undergraduate popu
lation, but only 18 percent of
those with degrees in computer
science, according to Ellora Is
rani 'l4 and Ayna Agarwal 'l4
who gave the opening remarks
Saturday at an event called
She++.
The conference, the brainchild
of Israni, a Daily senior staff
writer, and Agarwal, was meant
to probe the barriers that sepa
rate women from the technology
field, in addition to serving as a
call for women to enter fields and
pursue passions outside of their
comfort zones. Speakers at the
event included Jocelyn Goldfein,
director of engineering at Face
book; Irene Au, head of user ex
perience at Google; and Maria
Klawe, president of Harvey
Mudd College,
Both Israni and Agarwal said
they were influenced to found the
event by a small presentation
they attended last fall by Face
book COO Sheryl Sandberg.
"If we were able to be inspired
by something like [Sandberg's
presentation], why not bring a
host of role models to campus to
inspire a larger audience of
women?" Israni said.
Interested high school and
Stanford students were admitted
to the conference for free, and all
available tickets were booked
days after release.
One of the attendees was
Michelle Pan 'l5, who is consid
ering majoring in computer sci
ence.
"I thought [She++] would be

relevant to my life in the next
four years and even beyond
[Stanford]," she said.
Pan described the conference
as insightful in helping her under
stand the role that women can
play in the computer science
world.

"I found it helpful that all the
speakers came from different
backgrounds," she said. "It was
easy to find someone to connect
to and find a new perspective."
The She++ team will post blog
posts by attendees and videos of
the panel speakers online for

those who could not secure tick
ets to the Saturday event.
"The point of this was to bring
the [She++] community onto the
Internet for the rest of the Bay
Area and the nation to
