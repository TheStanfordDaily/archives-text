## She++ conference emboldens women in CS 
### KENJI HATA 
Females make up 57 percent
of the U.S. undergraduate popu
lation, but only 18 percent of
those with degrees in computer
science, according to Ellora Is
rani 'l4 and Ayna Agarwal 'l4
who gave the opening remarks
Saturday at an event called
She++.
The conference, the brainchild
of Israni, a Daily senior staff
writer, and Agarwal, was meant
to probe the barriers that sepa
rate women from the technology
field, in addition to serving as a
call for women to enter fields and
pursue passions outside of their
comfort zones. Speakers at the
event included Jocelyn Goldfein,
director of engineering at Face
book; Irene Au, head of user ex
perience at Google; and Maria
Klawe, president of Harvey
Mudd College,
Both Israni and Agarwal said
they were influenced to found the
event by a small presentation
they attended last fall by Face
book COO Sheryl Sandberg.
"If we were able to be inspired
by something like [Sandberg's
presentation], why not bring a
host of role models to campus to
inspire a larger audience of
women?" Israni said.
Interested high school and
Stanford students were admitted
to the conference for free, and all
available tickets were booked
days after release.
One of the attendees was
Michelle Pan 'l5, who is consid
ering majoring in computer sci
ence.
"I thought [She++] would be

relevant to my life in the next
four years and even beyond
[Stanford]," she said.
Pan described the conference
as insightful in helping her under
stand the role that women can
play in the computer science
world.

"I found it helpful that all the
speakers came from different
backgrounds," she said. "It was
easy to find someone to connect
to and find a new perspective."
The She++ team will post blog
posts by attendees and videos of
the panel speakers online for

those who could not secure tick
ets to the Saturday event.
"The point of this was to bring
the [She++] community onto the
Internet for the rest of the Bay
Area and the nation to

see," Agarwal said.
During the panel, Goldfein ex
plained why there is such enthusi
asm to promote computer science
for women. If the gender balance
among computer scientists could
match the regular college distri
bution, there would be a doubling
of computer scientists in Ameri
ca, she said.
Computer Science professor
Eric Roberts told The Daily in
February that only 20 percent of
CS majors currently at Stanford
are women.
The She++ conference also fo
cused on the reasons behind the
abysmally low numbers of female
computer scientists and engi
neers. Female engineers face the
"Imposter Syndrome," the inse

curity that they do not belong in
an area so heavily occupied by
males.

Keynote speaker Klawe of
fered a solution that she said has
raised Harvey Mudd's percent
age of female computer scientists
to 40 percent.
According to Klawe, using the
K-12 SWIFT Career Interest
Study 1998-1999, Harvey Mudd
found that from an early age,
women have a significantly small
er interest and lower confidence
level in computer science and en
gineering. Additionally, this gen
der gap does not change through
out the years.
"It's a problem based on the
old saying 'Do what you love and
what you are good at,"' Klawe
said in her keynote speech. She
added that if women are not inter
ested and are not confident, they
will not pursue computer science.
In order to fix this gap, Harvey
Mudd reconstructed their intro

ductory computer science course
from the standard Java curricu
lum into a group-focused Python
learning experience. This course
was further divided based on the
experience-level of each student
so new students were not dissuad
ed by their peers who were seem
ingly more experienced. CS
106A, Stanford's introductory CS
class, is taught in Java.
"[lsrani] and I really want to
do something after this," Agarwal
said. "It's just a matter of figuring
out what. But, I feel like I have a
responsibility to continue doing
something with this experience."
"I think we can view this con
ference for a day, but the impact
needs to last longer than that," Is
rani said. "Whether it's pointing
people to other places or organiz
ing them ourselves, we're defi
nitely going to continue."
