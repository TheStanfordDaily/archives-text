## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Alice Phillips 
The Stanford Zero-Wasters
sifted through trash Friday in

White Plaza in an effort to insti
gate further discussion about recy
cling and composting on campus,
according to group member and
lead audit organizer Michael
Sojka 'l5.
The group, one of four subsets of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford
(SSS), tracked and recorded the
amount of waste in the area dump
sters of Green Library, Meyer Li
brary and Coupa Cafe for several
days.The Zero-Wasters then sorted
through the trash in those dump
sters on Friday wearing lab
coats, gloves and goggles to find
out how much of the trash in the
dumpsters could have been either
recycled or composted.
The amount of trash that could
have avoided the trip to the land
fill is quantified by weight.
"I have not received the com
plete set of numbers yet, but from
sorting, it appeared that there was
a lot of compost that was thrown
away," Sojka wrote in an email to
The Daily. "This is another sign
that we need composting in all
buildings."
Approximately 15 members of
the Zero-Wasters participated in
the public audit, and a number of
people passing by approached
them during the event to see what
was going on, according to Sojka.
The waste audit was part of a
larger Earth Day celebration on
Friday in White Plaza.
SSS acquired the garbage
through Peninsula Sanitary Serv
ice, Inc. (PSSI).
