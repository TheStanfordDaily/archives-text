## Cruising around campus 
### SIERRA FREEMAN 
For the most part, Stanford
has everything students
need right on campus,
only a quick bike ride
away from the dorms. But
while biking is the most popular
mode of transportation for stu
dents, there are a wide variety of
transportation options available
for students who opt for something
other than two wheels.
On the Farm
For many, the choice of trans
portation depends on the destina
tion.
"You can take the Marguerite a
decent amount," Keith Wyngarden
'l5 said. "But it'll only get you so far.
The problem with the Marguerite is
that you have to be proactive about
schedule times and where you want
to go has to be on [one of the
routes]."
While the free bus system offers
a total of 144 stops on or around
campus, it is restricted to destina
tions in the Stanford area, as op
posed to locations in nearby Moun
tain View and Redwood City. Even
still, its reliability and price —or
lack thereof makes the Mar
guerite a popular means of trans
portation for Stanford students
without cars or those simply unwill
ing to make the long walk or bike
ride to reach downtown Palo Alto.
Some students choose another
four-wheeled vehicle to get around
skateboards or longboards.
Owen Falk 'l5 said he opts for
boarding simply because it's more
fun than riding a bike.
Despite the board's slower
speed and lack of brakes, Falk said
he finds it more enjoyable than
most other modes of transporta
tion.

Other popular options for stu
dents seeking more flexibility or to
travel greater distances are rental
car or ridesharing services, such as
Zipcar and Wheelz.
Zipcar, a nationwide rental car
company, allows students to sign up
to rent one of 39 cars located in 16
locations on campus. Zipcar
charges a $25 application fee, an an
nual fee of $6O and an hourly rate
(roughly $8 an hour) during the ac
tual period of use.
While Zipcar rents out cars
specifically for student use, Wheelz,
another rental car company, allows
individuals in the Stanford area to
rent out their personal cars to those
in need of a temporary ride. Car
owners are paid an hourly or daily
amount based on how frequently

their car is rented, with rates varying
on the year, make and model of the
car. As previously reported by The
Daily, Wheelz recently received a
$13.7 million investment from Zip
car to expand the reach of its servic
es.
Rental cars and ridesharing pro
grams encourage carpooling in
order to split the costs of driving a
car, helping to reduce gas emis
sions and other harmful envi
ronmental effects.
Yet perhaps the most flexible
mode of transportation for stu
dents despite the associat
ed costs is the use of their
own cars. While freshmen
cannot apply for an on
campus parking permit,
upperclassmen enjoy
the freedom and utility
the combination of bike
and car ownership pro
vides.
According to Shane Hegde
'l3, having access to a car
makes getting around the
area and off campus
much easier.
"I use my car about
five times a week," he said.
"I get to go out with friends, v,
I can go to the grocery store
whenever I want whenever is
convenient."
Rafael Witten 'l2 uses a combi
nation of bike and car transporta
tion to get around and is sure to use
a bike light at night, as he once had
to attend a bicycle diversion class
through the Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safety.
Safe (and smart) travels
With all of the options avail
able — from self-owned cars to
Zipcars to the Marguerite some
students choose to factor in "green
thinking," making the most envi
ronmentally responsible decision.
Kenneth Qin 'l5, green living
coordinator in freshman dorm
Soto in Wilbur Hall, argues it is
necessary for people to consider
environmental factors when evalu
ating their transportation choices,
but he notes that the Stanford cam
pus is already very environmental
ly conscious when it comes to these
decisions.
"Stanford is such a green cam
pus already," he said. "I encourage
people to live more environmen
tally friendly lifestyles, but pretty
much everyone uses bikes or pub
lic transit here."
As Qin points out, biking or
skateboarding are obviously the
top choices for zero-emissions
travel. Stanford boasts 13,000 reg
istered bicycles on campus, accord-

ing to Brodie Hamilton, director of
Parking and Transportation Serv
ices (PTS).
However, with so much bike
traffic, there are risks for bikers
and non-bikers alike.
"Many fail to follow the rules of
the road, like stopping at stop signs
or yielding the right of way when
appropriate, riding on the right
side of the road or path, using a
light when riding at night, riding
too fast or while distracted,"
Hamilton wrote in an email to The
Daily.
He also added that helmet
wearing rates at Stanford are very
low, citing a number of reasons in
cluding students feeling that they
look "geeky," that wearing a hel
met is "uncool or contrary to the
Stanford student culture" or that

bikers do not want
to pay for a helmet. He maintains
that these are not justifying excus
es.
"Students and their families
make a considerable financial in
vestment to attend Stanford," he
said. "Spending $lO to $l5 for a
bike helmet is a cheap investment
to protect the grey matter on which
they are spending so much to edu
cate."
In order to combat this issue,
PTS has founded numerous out
reach programs to educate stu
dents about biking safety, even
handing out free bike lights to a se
lect number of dorms.
Comparisons across campuses
Like Stanford, colleges across
the country boast a variety of
transportation methods to cater to
individual students' needs and the

demands of their specific campus
locations.

UC-Davis, located in what is
known as The Bicycle Capital of
the United States, boasts that the
name "Davis" and the word "bicy
cle" are synonymous, since the ma
jority of all traffic near and on cam
pus consists of bike traffic.
Like Stanford, Harvard Uni
versity and Yale University host
Zipcars on campus and encourage
students to walk, bike or carpool
when possible.
For instance, Yale boasts a car
rental program, Relay Rides,
which is similar to Stanford's
Wheelz. Through Relay Rides, the
cars, typically owned by students,
are rented out and returned at a
time specified by the owner. As ad
vertised on Yale's website for
Relay Rides, the program's allows

From biking to busing, driving to longboarding,
Stanford students and college students
across the country have a variety of options
when it comes to transportation

indivuals to choose a greater vari
ety of cars than offered by Zipcar
and many other rental car com
panies.
And what about Stanford's
rival across the Bay?
UC-Berkeley has a system
much like the Marguerite, which
shuttles travelers around campus
and the nearby vicinity. Unlike the
Marguerite, UC-Berkeley's bus
system, known as Bear Transit, is
not free to the public. Much like at
Stanford, however, a portion of
UC-Berkeley's student body own
cars. According to the Office of
Parking and Transportation, only
53 percent of campus faculty and
92 percent of students commute
by transportation other than solo
driving.
As the various travel options at
Stanford and its peer universities
show, transportation at college de
pends on students' specific com
muting needs, as well as their con
cern for safety and the environ
ment. From biking to longboard
ing, students at Stanford and across
the country have a variety of op
tions to get where they need to go.
