# CATCHING UP ON SLEEP
## 
### â€“ Katie Kramon 
It might seem strange, but just as the
harmful effects of tobacco were not
well known a half-century ago, many
people also did not recognize the dan
gers of too little sleep.
Not until William Dement, professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences and

founder of the Sleep Research Center
(widely regarded as the world's first sleep
laboratory), set up "summer sleep camps"
during the 1970s at what was then the
Lambda Nu fraternity now the self-op
Jerry, named after the late Jerry Garcia of
the Grateful Dead.

"It was the first time anyone had ever
used a large residence to study sleep," De
ment said.
Dement's work in Jerry was commemo
rated earlier this year with a plaque placed
in the entry way of the residence, which once
housed both undergrads living on campus

during the summer and participating in the
research, and the researchers themselves.
"The researchers could actually manipu
late the subjects' sleep," Dement said.
He said the biggest surprise to come out
of the Jerry sleep camps was just how much
sleep can affect an individual's day-to-day
performance. According to Dement, more
sleep can make a person vacillate between
widely different moods turning a person
from "an idiot to a genius," "cranky to
cheerful" or "morose to happy."
Along with colleague Mary Carskadon,
now a professor of psychiatry and human
behavior at Brown University, Dement
paid subjects to live at Jerry for about a
week at a time, comparing their ability to do
tasks after a night in which they received
the proper amount of sleep with their abili
ty to perform the same tasks while suffering
from sleep deprivation.
During Dementis study, a subject might
go to bed at 10 p.m. the first night and be
awakened at 8 a.m. and, the next night, go to
bed at 12 a.m. to be awakened at 6 a.m. Re
searchers would then study how long it
took the person to feel and act "normal"
and fully rested again. Researchers had
studied sleep before, but usually only in
one-night increments.
Asked for his advice to sleep-deprived
Stanford students beyond the obvious
solution of getting more shut-eye De
ment had good news.
"If you stay up all night, [you] can re
store with about seven or eight hours be
cause sleep is deeper," he said.
He also noted that recent research con
ducted by his colleague Cheri Mah 'O6 M.S.
'O7 on the Stanford men's basketball team
has shown that sleep deprivation can affect
athletic performance. When the players got
more sleep, their cognitive reaction times
improved. According to Mah's study, ath
letes who worry primarily about nutrition
and training should also focus on getting
more sleep.
So does Dement himself ever have trou
ble sleeping? Apparently, not much.
"The source of almost all [my] sleeping
issues is nervousness and lecturing," he
said.
But after 40 years of teaching, he sug
gests that academic duties are second na
ture to him, much in the same manner as
catching some Z's.
