UT7 or those of you who are
|H not aware, there was a
A genocide that did take
place against the Armenian peo
ple ... We have seen a constant
denial on the part of the Turkish
government. It has become a sore
spot diplomatically.
"America deserves a leader
who speaks truthfully about the
Armenian genocide and responds
forcefully to all genocides. I in
tend to be that president."
Senator Barack Obama
in his presidential campaign, 2008
On this day, April 24, 2012, 10
million Armenians around the
world commemorate the 97th an
niversary of the Armenian Geno
cide, the premeditated annihila
tion of 1.5 million Armenians liv
ing in Ottoman Turkey in 1915.
This first genocide of the modern
period nearly erased the presence
of the Armenians from Eastern
Anatolia, expunging an ancient
civilization from its ancestral
homeland of more than 3,000
years.
On April 24, 1915, the Young
Turk government began the sys
tematic genocide of its Armenian
citizens, an unarmed Christian mi
nority population. They arrested
and executed the Armenian intel
lectual elite and community heads
in Constantinople (Istanbul),
which successfully deprived the
community of its leadership. Ar
menian men were either forced
into military labor battalions and
then murdered at their worksites
or summarily executed outside of
their towns and villages. Under
orders from Constantinople, the
Ottoman military uprooted the
Armenian women, children, and
elderly from their homes. They
were forced to march and then
were brutally killed on the road
sides or starved to death. Those
few who arrived in the Syrian
desert died of starvation, disease
or in primitive gas chamber caves.
The present Turkish govern
ment continues to officially deny
these facts and promotes a revi
sionist history.
So why is recognition of these
events relevant today?
It is important for societies and
governments to take responsibili
ty for crimes that occurred in their
past in order to be partners in a
civilized world as well as to earn
reconciliation with victims and
their descendants. In a 2005 letter

to Prime Minister Erdogan, the
International Association of
Genocide Scholars wrote: "We
believe that it is clearly in the in
terest of the Turkish people and
their future as proud and equal
participants in international,
democratic discourse to acknowl
edge the responsibility of a previ
ous government for the genocide
of the Armenian people, just as
the German government and peo
ple have done in the case of the
Holocaust."
We, the Stanford Armenian
Students Association, would like
to inform the Stanford communi
ty of this history because we Ar
menians still feel the pain of this
genocide and the associated offi
cial denial. Many Turkish citizens
and scholars recognize the Ar
menian genocide, notably scholar
Taner Akgam. He is among the
larger international contingent of
genocide and Holocaust scholars
who openly discuss the truth of
the Armenian genocide and speak
out against the Turkish govern
ment. The legal scholar Raphael
Lemkin, who coined the word
"genocide" in 1943, did so precise
ly because of the Armenians. As
he told one interviewer: "I be
came interested in genocide be
cause it happened so many times.
First to the Armenians, then after
the Armenians, Hitler took ac
tion."
To date, 21 countries including
Canada, France, and Russia have
officially recognized the events of
1915 as genocide. The U.S. govern
ment, despite its many promises,
has yet to officially use the word
"genocide" to describe the events
of 1915, not because it is not the
truth, but because the use of such
a statement could jeopardize
Turkish-American relations. Un
fortunately, President Obama's
campaign commitments have not
been fulfilled.
Our Stanford community must
bear witness to this injustice. A
civilized society can only be built
on the pillars of truth and not on
denial and revision.
On this day, please take a mo
ment to remember the victims of
the Armenian genocide and all
other victims of crimes against hu
manity.
