# 'Rove v. Gibbs' is not helping
## 
### PETER MCDONALD '11 Occupier of Meyer Library 
As the masses fill up Circus
MemAud this afternoon
to watch Rove vs. Gibbs,
the biggest surprise for me is
that the debate isn't happening
on Sunday SUNDAY SUN
DAY!!! Wasn't it just last week
that we were calling for a more
civil political discourse in the af
termath of ASSU election sea
son?
"Which party is better suited
to lead?" This is a question that
is being asked. I fail to see how

any self-respecting educational
institution can sanction the idea
of essentialism in one's party
alignment, much less apply it to
leadership capabilities. We put
on events like this and then won
der why American politics is so
toxic and partisan. I hope those
attending are at least planning
on pre-gaming, because from the
looks of it, this debate is specta
cle and nothing more.
