# FROM FARM TO FORK
## Food breakthroughs and food breakdowns 
### Jenny Rempel 
The term "food desert" has
gained popularity in recent
years as away of describing
low-income rural or urban neigh
borhoods that lack access to fresh
fruits and vegetables.
However, two recent studies
have attacked the concept of a
food desert. Research by the Pub
lic Policy Institute of California
suggests that poor urban neigh
borhoods have twice as many su
permarkets and large-scale gro
cers per square mile than do their
more affluent counterparts, and a
study by the RAND Corporation
found no relationship between
childhood obesity and the type of
food outlets within a mile and a
half of a child's home. These are
important findings, but both stud
ies missed the point. Food deserts
are explicitly defined as areas
with low access to supermarkets
or grocery stores, not simply low
income urban neighborhoods.

Our focus on debating the exis
tence of inequalities in access has
helped us continue to ignore the
underlying health and hunger
problems. Vast inequalities exist
with regards to food access. As ac
tivist Nikki Henderson suggests,
the widening income-inequality
gap has helped keep some indi
viduals in a state of perpetual
food breakthrough, while others
are locked into perpetual break
down. Without exposure to the
opposite state, it's hard to concep
tualize how deeply rooted these
problems are in society.
Having grown up in Fresno
County, I was given a pretty good
understanding of the break
throughs. My family had local,
fresh, organically grown produce
delivered weekly from a friend's
farm, and bike rides to the neigh
borhood farmers' market were a
Saturday morning routine. (Don't
worry, life wasn't always this idyl
lically romantic. I still had my
chance to try Lunchables, Taco
Bell and canned pineapples when
Dad was in the kitchen.)
With $5.9 billion in total gross
production value from nuts, poul
try, raisin grapes, milk and over
350 other commodities, Fresno is
the most agriculturally valuable
county in the state and one of the
most agriculturally productive re
gions of the world. Sadly, the
county also has one of the highest
food insecurity rates in the state.
Almost 200,000 individuals are
classified as "food insecure" in
Fresno County, which means they
have limited or uncertain access
to adequate food, according to the
USDA. More than half of those
individuals are children, making
the childhood food insecurity rate
a frightening 35.4 percent of the
population under age 18. Many of
the food insecure households are
composed of farmworkers who
grow our food but lack a living
wage to feed their own families.
That Fresno County can simulta
neously produce the largest agri
cultural revenue in the state and
sustain such high levels of food in
security highlights the sharp di
vide between food breakthroughs
and food breakdowns.
But you don't need to venture
into California's interior to find
food injustices. California has six

counties with more than 100,000
food insecure children each, more
than any other state in the union.
There are 100,170 children living in
food insecure households in our
own Santa Clara County, meaning
there is a 23.6 percent childhood
food insecurity rate in the county
once known as the "Valley of
Heart's Delight" for its abundant
fruit orchards. A study by the Food
Empowerment Project found that
low-income neighborhoods in
Santa Clara County had fewer su
permarkets, lower access to pro
duce, almost no access to organic
produce and lower-quality fruits
and vegetables than their high-in
come counterparts.
There are both local and
broader actions individuals can
take to raise awareness about
hunger and reduce these glaring
inequalities. The Stanford Project
on Hunger (SPOON) is always
seeking volunteers to assist with
leftover food deliveries. Recog
nizing the value of leftover food
from campus eateries and dining
halls, SPOON activists collect left
overs and transport this food to
the Palo Alto Opportunity Cen
ter. In recent years, they have redi
rected over 12,000 pounds of food
that would otherwise have been
wasted. Students and campus or
ganizations can also volunteer to
serve breakfast at the Opportuni
ty Center. Though it may seem
like an insignificant gesture, inter
acting with individuals who are in
the midst of a food system break
down can expose student activists
to real food insecurity, reinvigo
rating broader efforts to address
malnutrition in our society.
We produce enough food to
feed Americans, but our system is
stuck in a state of inequality. Ac
cess to affordable, culturally rele
vant, healthy, sustainable food
should not be a pie-in-the-sky
goal. It should be a basic right.

the food insecure households are
composed of farmworkers who
grow our food but lack a living
wage to feed their own families.
That Fresno County can simulta
neously produce the largest agri
cultural revenue in the state and
sustain such high levels of food in
security highlights the sharp di
vide between food breakthroughs
and food breakdowns.
But you don't need to venture
into California's interior to find
food injustices. California has six

counties with more than 100,000
food insecure children each, more
than any other state in the union.
There are 100,170 children living in
food insecure households in our
own Santa Clara County, meaning
there is a 23.6 percent childhood
food insecurity rate in the county
once known as the "Valley of
Heart's Delight" for its abundant
fruit orchards. A study by the Food
Empowerment Project found that
low-income neighborhoods in
Santa Clara County had fewer su
permarkets, lower access to pro
duce, almost no access to organic
produce and lower-quality fruits
and vegetables than their high-in
come counterparts.
There are both local and
broader actions individuals can
take to raise awareness about
hunger and reduce these glaring
inequalities. The Stanford Project
on Hunger (SPOON) is always
seeking volunteers to assist with
leftover food deliveries. Recog
nizing the value of leftover food
from campus eateries and dining
halls, SPOON activists collect left
overs and transport this food to
the Palo Alto Opportunity Cen
ter. In recent years, they have redi
rected over 12,000 pounds of food
that would otherwise have been
wasted. Students and campus or
ganizations can also volunteer to
serve breakfast at the Opportuni
ty Center. Though it may seem
like an insignificant gesture, inter
acting with individuals who are in
the midst of a food system break
down can expose student activists
to real food insecurity, reinvigo
rating broader efforts to address
malnutrition in our society.
We produce enough food to
feed Americans, but our system is
stuck in a state of inequality. Ac
cess to affordable, culturally rele
vant, healthy, sustainable food
should not be a pie-in-the-sky
goal. It should be a basic right.

The term "food desert" has
gained popularity in recent
years as away of describing
low-income rural or urban neigh
borhoods that lack access to fresh
fruits and vegetables.
However, two recent studies
have attacked the concept of a
food desert. Research by the Pub
lic Policy Institute of California
suggests that poor urban neigh
borhoods have twice as many su
permarkets and large-scale gro
cers per square mile than do their
more affluent counterparts, and a
study by the RAND Corporation
found no relationship between
childhood obesity and the type of
food outlets within a mile and a
half of a child's home. These are
important findings, but both stud
ies missed the point. Food deserts
are explicitly defined as areas
with low access to supermarkets
or grocery stores, not simply low
income urban neighborhoods.

Our focus on debating the exis
tence of inequalities in access has
helped us continue to ignore the
underlying health and hunger
problems. Vast inequalities exist
with regards to food access. As ac
tivist Nikki Henderson suggests,
the widening income-inequality
gap has helped keep some indi
viduals in a state of perpetual
food breakthrough, while others
are locked into perpetual break
down. Without exposure to the
opposite state, it's hard to concep
tualize how deeply rooted these
problems are in society.
Having grown up in Fresno
County, I was given a pretty good
understanding of the break
throughs. My family had local,
fresh, organically grown produce
delivered weekly from a friend's
farm, and bike rides to the neigh
borhood farmers' market were a
Saturday morning routine. (Don't
worry, life wasn't always this idyl
lically romantic. I still had my
chance to try Lunchables, Taco
Bell and canned pineapples when
Dad was in the kitchen.)
With $5.9 billion in total gross
production value from nuts, poul
try, raisin grapes, milk and over
350 other commodities, Fresno is
the most agriculturally valuable
county in the state and one of the
most agriculturally productive re
gions of the world. Sadly, the
county also has one of the highest
food insecurity rates in the state.
Almost 200,000 individuals are
classified as "food insecure" in
Fresno County, which means they
have limited or uncertain access
to adequate food, according to the
USDA. More than half of those
individuals are children, making
the childhood food insecurity rate
a frightening 35.4 percent of the
population under age 18. Many of
the food insecure households are
composed of farmworkers who
grow our food but lack a living
wage to feed their own families.
