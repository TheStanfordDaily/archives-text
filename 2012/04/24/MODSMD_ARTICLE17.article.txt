## Enjoy it while it lasts 
### Tom Taylor 
Sometimes I'm not really
sure why I invest so much
of myself in soccer; it's
hard to say I really enjoy
myself much when
watching either my home club or
national team. Yes, my heart races,
but usually with a sense of impend
ing doom rather than joy. Although
the start of each season or major
tournament inevitably seems to
promise hope, the end almost al
ways comes as a relief
This year, though, is different.
Not just because Euro 2012 kicks
off in just over a month's time, or
even that London will get to host
the Olympics and the rarest and
most divisive of things, a united
British soccer team. No, this year is
different because, even before the
current action has finished, the
kickoff to the new season when
my home team, Reading FC, will
begin its glorious return to the Pre
mier League seems such a des
perately long way off.
Right now, life is sweet, and
sports are fun. I feel no sense of rue
ful jealousy watching the Champi
ons League semifinals. Just to see
some English representation in the
final, I might even cheer for Chelsea
when it travels to Spain today, hop
ing to hold onto a narrow 1-0 ad
vantage over fan-favorite
Barcelona. Or maybe I'll put my
support behind Real Madrid to
morrow, somehow suspending the
fact I absolutely despise Cristiano
Ronaldo and pardoning manager
Jose Mourinho for some unjustified
remarks in the aftermath of Petr
Cech's nasty head injury at Reading
back in 2006.
In the same vein, something that
always impressed me about former
Stanford great Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike, who signed with the WNBA's
LA Sparks just a week ago, was how
much fun she always seemed to be
having. On court, in practice and
even in press conferences, she was
consistently cheerful and enthusias
tic. I guess it helps to be always win
ning, and having never personally
seen the Cardinal lose on the Farm
the team currently holds a 79-
game winning streak at Maples
Pavilion I've never had to face
her after a defeat. But there are
many incredibly successful athletes
who don't have such a sunny dispo
sition.
Nneka is, without a doubt, living
the dream. Not only is she going to
earn a healthy sum of money in her
career, but she also gets to be a pro
fessional sports star. I know many
of you reading this would give
everything to be able to say the
same, but your aspirations simply
started too late, you just weren't
good enough or your dreams were
killed by injury. It's natural to be a
bit jealous, but the feelings would
be far worse if she stormed around
in a bad mood, failing to enjoy the
life and talent given to her.
Sport is, at the end of the day, a
form of entertainment. It should be
fun, but all too often we take it too
seriously, and we overcomplicate
things tactically, financially and
emotionally. None of that ever does
us any good. My fellow writer Jack
Mosbacher diagnosed the Cardinal
baseball team's woes last week as a
result of nothing more than the
team not enjoying itself. That is
often a reinforcing cycle: no fun
leads to bad results, which quickly
pile on the pressure and make it
even harder to bring the enjoyment
back.
Losing sight of the fun is not just
a failing of fans and players, either.
Over the weekend, the Federation
Internationale de l'Automobile
(FIA) brought Formula 1 back to
the deeply troubled kingdom of
Bahrain. Instead of simple family
entertainment, the sport allowed it
self to be wielded as a political tool
under the tagline of "UniFled: One
Nation in Celebration!"
This little gulf state is anything
but that. Since the start of the Arab
Spring, it has seen continued unrest
as the majority Shia population
seek greater say in their country's
affairs from the ruling Sunni minor
ity. Last year's race was called off,
but despite protests and the death
of at least one person, this year's
event went ahead as planned. F1 or
ganizers claimed that the decision
was the right one and that it was
only in Bahrain as a sporting entity,
disconnected from any political
machinations. Losing sight of reali
ty and putting the importance of
