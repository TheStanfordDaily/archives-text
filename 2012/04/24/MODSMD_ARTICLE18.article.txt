## DOUBLES POINT CRUCIAL IN 4-3 WIN OVER CAL 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On a sultry Saturday at Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium, the No. 5 Stanford women's ten
nis team defeated Cal 4-3 on Senior Night to
all but lock up a share of the Pac-12 champi
onship.
Veronica Li, the lone senior on the team,
was honored before the match with warm
hearted tributes from her coaches and loud
ovations from the crowd. Li was praised for
the consistency and ability that she demon
strated over her four years as a starter. She
won a total of 78 singles matches and 73 dou
bles matches during her time at Stanford.
"She has meant so much to me on a per
sonal level and also on a tennis level," said
sophomore Nicole Gibbs.
"She will be very important to us going
into NCAAs, especially because she has so
much experience," added junior Mallory Bur
dette.
Although Li faltered in singles, losing 6-0,
6-1, her doubles victory alongside junior Na
talie Dillon proved to be crucial in the team's
victory.The No. 10 Golden Bears are formida
ble in doubles with two duos ranked in the top
15, including the No. 5 duo on court two that
handed junior StaceyTan and freshman Ellen
Tsay an 8-2 loss. Burdette and Gibbs won 8-6
on court one, despite losing four straight
games after being ahead 6-2 early in the
match.
The doubles point proved to be the decid
ing factor in a match with added importance
for the Cardinal. Both teams knew the winner
would have a chance at a share of the Pac-12
title along with USC, the other team in the
conference with only one loss.
The only thing standing between Stanford
and a share of the title is a makeup match with
No. 31 Washington State on Wednesday,
which the teams postponed earlier in the sea
son because of rain. Since 1987, Stanford has
won at least a share of the Pac-12 champi
onship in every year except 2009.
The win was also important because the
Cardinal is coming off its first defeat of the
season, a 5-2 home loss to then-No. 1 UCLA.
"This was really big for our confidence as a
team after coming off of last week's loss," Bur
dette said.
No. 5 Burdette defeated a formidable op
ponent in No. 11 Zsofi Susanyi 6-2, 6-4 on
court two for her 17th victory in a row. She was
the first player to finish her match, a sight that
is becoming increasingly familiar to Stanford
fans.
No. 4 Gibbs, on the other hand, had a lot to
prove in her match against No. 6 Jana Jurico
va. Gibbs lost last weekend against UCLA,
only her second loss of the season and the first
since mid-February. On top of that, Juricova
beat Gibbs in a third-set tiebreak in last year's
NCAA singles semifinal.
Gibbs took Saturday's match 7-6 (2), 6-2,
beating Juricova for the second time this year.
Even with all of the personal implications,
Gibbs stressed what her victory meant for the
team.
"It was that much more important for me
because it helped our team pull out the 4-3
victory," Gibbs said.
Gibbs was not playing her best tennis early,
falling behind 5-3, but she hung in to tie the
match at 6-6 and win the tiebreak 7-2. After
closing out the set, Gibbs gave a big fist pump
to the crowd, which was concentrated in the
shady section of the stands directly above
court one.
"The atmosphere was awesome, just a lot
of support and a lot of noise. [The crowd] ab

solutely helped pull me through the first set,"
Gibbs said.
The sun affected everyone involved on
Saturday and was responsible for uncharac
teristically high temperatures. Water coolers
had to be refilled several times, and a few play
ers even went in for shade between sets.
Stanford seemed to deal with the heat
somewhat better than its opponent. The Car
dinal went 4-2 on second sets, although fresh
man Ellen Tsay did lose a tiebreak that re
placed her third set after Stanford had already
clinched a victory.
"We were fortunate to play a team that was

just as affected as we were, instead of one of
the teams from the South," Gibbs said.
The Cardinal dropped all three points on
the lower courts, as junior Natalie Dillon lost
6-4, 6-2 at court six along side Li at five and
Tsay at four.
The Cardinal has a busy weekend coming
up, as Wednesday's makeup with Washington
State precedes the Pac-12 championships.The
matchup with the Cougars is slated to begin at
11:30 a.m. in Ojai, Calif., which will also serve
as the home of the conference tournament.
