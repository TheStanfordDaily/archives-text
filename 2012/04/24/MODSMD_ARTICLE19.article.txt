# Mosbacher Minute
## There's no place like Sunken Diamond 
### JACK MOSBACHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of the
Stanford baseball team from 2008-2011.
Each week, he'll take a look at the Cardi
nal's ups and downs on its road to the
College World Series.
Suddenly, everything was going right
for No. 10 Stanford again this weekend,
as the Cardinal swept No. 23 Arizona
State and clawed its way back into the
race for the Pac-12 title. Most important
ly, the Cardinal righted its previously
sinking ship, breaking out of an ugly of
fensive slump to score 34 runs in three
wins against the Sun Devils in a must
win series.
The Cardinal is peaking at the right
time. Stanford probably can't lose anoth
er series if they hope to get home-field
advantage for the Regional and Super
Regional tournaments.
Baseball can be a fickle game. Every
season has its mountains and valleys, and

Stanford has struggled mightily at times
in the current campaign. However, this
team has proven itself a fighter. The fire
power displayed in this weekend's re
turn-to-form offensive explosion against
one of the nation's best pitching staffs
showed once again just how potent this
Cardinal offense can be when clicking
on all nine cylinders.
Now that things are back to normal,
it's time for this Stanford team to revisit
its goals and recommit to a plan for
reaching them.
At the outset of every season, Stan
ford's goals are the same: compete for a
Pac-12 Championship and make it to the
College World Series in Omaha. This
past weekend's series marked the
halfway point in Pac-12 play. Though it
feels like the season started only a few
weeks ago, time is flying by. What does
Stanford have to do to make its Omaha
dreams a reality?
When it comes to predicting which
teams will make it through the
playoffs to Omaha in June, one
variable consistently exerts an
overriding influence: hosting a
Regional. Hosting both Regional
and Super Regional contests at
home has far-reaching implica
tions for a team trying to make it
to the World Series. In last year's
tournament, seven of the eight
teams that made it to Omaha
played both their Regional and
Super Regional on their home
turf. Although correlation doesn't
necessarily mean causation,
there's something to be said for
this apparent relationship.
Any team trying to reach the
World Series while playing on the
road is fighting an improbable,
though not impossible, uphill bat
tle. Take last year's Stanford
team, for instance. After finishing
the season on a hot streak, the
Cardinal upset host Cal State-

Fullerton in the Regional and
headed to Chapel Hill to face
North Carolina in the Super Re
gional. This time, Stanford was
playing in heat and humidity the
likes of which most of the players
had never experienced. Suddenly,
the strike zone would grow eight
inches for the Cardinal hitters and
pull a magical shrinking act when
the Tar Heels came to the plate.
Two lightning-quick games later,
Stanford's season was over. Point
being, Stanford needs to set its
sights on becoming one of the
top-eight national seeds in this
year's tournament, thus securing
home field advantage throughout
the playoffs.
By my count, Stanford will
need to win a pair of hard-fought
series against UCLA and Ore
gon State and hope for a sweep
against Washington State, lowly
Utah or Cal to end the year.
Should the season end this way,
I'd be shocked if Stanford didn't
lock up the seventh or eighth
seed in the 64-team playoff and
win the right to host the Region
al and Super Regional at Sunken

Diamond.
Is Stanford talented enough to
pull this off? Without a doubt.
Will they? That's a whole other
question. I guess that's what will
make these last five weeks of reg
ular season baseball worth watch
ing. For now, the Cardinal needs
to come together around the
shared and immediate goal of
performing their best in the final
five series of the season in order
to set up an optimal scenario for
getting to Omaha. After that, all
bets are off.
This Stanford team has proven
conclusively that it can play with
anybody, so having to play a Re
gional or Super Regional on the
road will not necessarily be a
death knell for this gifted team.
However, hosting should become
this team's primary goal as it
heads down the home stretch of
the 2012 season. If the Cardinal
can pull it off, opponents will be
hard-pressed to keep this team
out of Omaha in June.

pull this off? Without a doubt.
Will they? That's a whole other
question. I guess that's what will
make these last five weeks of reg
ular season baseball worth watch
ing. For now, the Cardinal needs
to come together around the
shared and immediate goal of
performing their best in the final
five series of the season in order
to set up an optimal scenario for
getting to Omaha. After that, all
bets are off.
This Stanford team has proven
conclusively that it can play with
anybody, so having to play a Re
gional or Super Regional on the
road will not necessarily be a
death knell for this gifted team.
However, hosting should become
this team's primary goal as it
heads down the home stretch of
the 2012 season. If the Cardinal
can pull it off, opponents will be
hard-pressed to keep this team
out of Omaha in June.

Jack Mosbacher was a member of the
Stanford baseball team from 2008-2011.
Each week, he'll take a look at the Cardi
nal's ups and downs on its road to the
College World Series.
Suddenly, everything was going right
for No. 10 Stanford again this weekend,
as the Cardinal swept No. 23 Arizona
State and clawed its way back into the
race for the Pac-12 title. Most important
ly, the Cardinal righted its previously
sinking ship, breaking out of an ugly of
fensive slump to score 34 runs in three
wins against the Sun Devils in a must
win series.
The Cardinal is peaking at the right
time. Stanford probably can't lose anoth
er series if they hope to get home-field
advantage for the Regional and Super
Regional tournaments.
Baseball can be a fickle game. Every
season has its mountains and valleys, and

Stanford has struggled mightily at times
in the current campaign. However, this
team has proven itself a fighter. The fire
power displayed in this weekend's re
turn-to-form offensive explosion against
one of the nation's best pitching staffs
showed once again just how potent this
Cardinal offense can be when clicking
on all nine cylinders.
Now that things are back to normal,
it's time for this Stanford team to revisit
its goals and recommit to a plan for
reaching them.
At the outset of every season, Stan
ford's goals are the same: compete for a
Pac-12 Championship and make it to the
College World Series in Omaha. This
past weekend's series marked the
halfway point in Pac-12 play. Though it
feels like the season started only a few
weeks ago, time is flying by. What does
Stanford have to do to make its Omaha
dreams a reality?
When it comes to predicting which
teams will make it through the
playoffs to Omaha in June, one
variable consistently exerts an
overriding influence: hosting a
Regional. Hosting both Regional
and Super Regional contests at
home has far-reaching implica
tions for a team trying to make it
to the World Series. In last year's
tournament, seven of the eight
teams that made it to Omaha
played both their Regional and
Super Regional on their home
turf. Although correlation doesn't
necessarily mean causation,
there's something to be said for
this apparent relationship.
Any team trying to reach the
World Series while playing on the
road is fighting an improbable,
though not impossible, uphill bat
tle. Take last year's Stanford
team, for instance. After finishing
the season on a hot streak, the
Cardinal upset host Cal State-

Fullerton in the Regional and
headed to Chapel Hill to face
North Carolina in the Super Re
gional. This time, Stanford was
playing in heat and humidity the
likes of which most of the players
had never experienced. Suddenly,
the strike zone would grow eight
inches for the Cardinal hitters and
pull a magical shrinking act when
the Tar Heels came to the plate.
Two lightning-quick games later,
Stanford's season was over. Point
being, Stanford needs to set its
sights on becoming one of the
top-eight national seeds in this
year's tournament, thus securing
home field advantage throughout
the playoffs.
By my count, Stanford will
need to win a pair of hard-fought
series against UCLA and Ore
gon State and hope for a sweep
against Washington State, lowly
Utah or Cal to end the year.
Should the season end this way,
I'd be shocked if Stanford didn't
lock up the seventh or eighth
seed in the 64-team playoff and
win the right to host the Region
al and Super Regional at Sunken

Diamond.
Is Stanford talented enough to
pull this off? Without a doubt.
Will they? That's a whole other
question. I guess that's what will
