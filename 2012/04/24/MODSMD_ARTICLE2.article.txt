# Alcohol use on par with national average
## 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford undergraduates fall just
below national averages in alcohol
consumption, according to a survey
conducted by the Office of Alcohol
Policy and Education (OAPE). The
survey indicated, however, that
Stanford is above average in having
alcohol as the center of campus so
cial life, in hard liquor use and in pre
gaming before events.
According to OAPE Director
Ralph Castro, the survey was con
ducted as part of a larger Stanford
alcohol initiative including the re

cent development of the OAPE of
fice, The office used a standard, na
tional survey from the Core Insti
tute in order to compare responses
to standard questions with survey
results from other institutions.
This year, 583 students took the
survey. Castro said OAPE will con
duct the same survey every year to
evaluate trends over time.
Compared with the national av
erage of 81.7 percent, 79.7 percent of
Stanford students said they had con
sumed alcohol in the past year. The
average number of drinks con
sumed per week fell well below av
erage, at 3.6 versus the national 4.6.

Despite the near average num
bers for overall alcohol consump
tion, Castro said that some of the
more specific drinking habits at
Stanford still might be cause for con
cern and University action.
"We are above national averages
for students who take shots of alco
hol, who drink hard liquor and who
engage in pre-gaming," Castro said.
"Those situations ... are risk factors
for negative consequences to hap
pen."

uate these high-risk behaviors. Ac
cording to Castro, 53.4 percent of
students reported pre-gaming in
the last 30 days. Many more stu
dents 32.2 percent reported
drinking primarily hard liquor
than students who reported drink
ing primarily beer 24.3 percent.
Castro said that 56.9 percent of
students reported ever having
taken a shot of hard liquor.
"It reaffirms what our thought
was," Castro said of OAPE's reac
tion to the high-risk drinking num
bers. "We know that [pre-gaming
and hard liquor] are our two big
risk factors, and we know we need
to provide some targeted educa
tion in those areas."
Castro also noted that the trend
toward hard liquor, which is typical
ly served in quantities that are diffi
cult to measure, could exacerbate
underestimation by drinkers of
overall alcohol consumption. Cas
tro specifically referred to the aver
age of 3.6 drinks per week, noting
that when drinking hard liquor, stu
dents might not know how much al
cohol they are consuming.
Despite the tendency toward

hard liquor and pre-gaming, Stan
ford still fell below national num
bers in the Core Institute survey for
binge drinking, which is usually
considered a metric of high-risk
drinking behavior. At Stanford,
40.9 percent of students reported
having five or more drinks in a row
in the last two weeks, whereas na
tionally 43.1 percent reported the
same behavior.
Another area of concern for
OAPE is in the alcohol-centered
culture that students reported ex
periencing at Stanford. Notably,
84.5 percent of students said that
people at Stanford drink because
it gives them something to do, al
most 13 percent above the national
average.

"To me that was a big one," Cas
tro said. "When people say the per
ceived effect of alcohol is that it just
gives people something to do, then
it means people are maybe just
bored on given weekends."
One of the largest divergences
from national averages came from
asking if students think the social
atmosphere on campus promotes
alcohol use. At Stanford, 73.6 per
cent of students said yes, whereas
only 47.7 percent nationally said
yes. Fraternities in particular were
believed to promote alcohol use:
94.8 percent of students said they
consider alcohol central to fraterni

ty life, compared to 77.9 percent na
tionally.
"There isn't anything else to
do," said Jacob Cruz 'l4, who said
he does not drink. Cruz said that so
cially, he usually just abstains at
events with alcohol present or does
not go out.
"There's different kinds of
drinking scenes," Cruz said. "You
have the huge, big house parties,
and then you have just the chill
backs. I enjoy those [chill-backs] a
little bit more."
OAPE started a program this
year called Cardinal Nights to offer
alternative, alcohol-free activities
for the weekends, but the program
is still in its infancy.
"For me [the survey] was clarifi
cation that we're on the right
track," Castro said of OAPE's re
sponse to the numbers.
One survey question, address
ing student likelihood to attend al
cohol-free events, divided students
into thirds, according to Castro,
with one third each saying they
were likely to attend, unlikely to at
tend and unsure. Castro said he
wants OAPE to adjust its offerings
to target the unsure group.
"For me, we need to make it OK
for people to want to go [to alcohol
free events]," Castro said.
Some numbers, however, indi
cated that students are already
making healthy alcohol decisions.
Nationally, 20.2 percent of students
reported ever performing poorly in
their schoolwork as a result of
drinking, but only 12.7 percent of
Stanford students reported the
same. Stanford also fell below aver
ages for vomiting or feeling nause
ated because of alcohol and for
other consequences like driving
under the influence (6.9 percent at
Stanford, 24.1 percent nationally).
"Even though only 13 percent
of students say they've performed
poorly on a test because of drink
ing, that's still a significant number
of students given our academic
rigor," Castro said.
