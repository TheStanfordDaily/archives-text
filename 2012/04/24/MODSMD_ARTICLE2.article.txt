# Alcohol use on par with national average
## 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford undergraduates fall just
below national averages in alcohol
consumption, according to a survey
conducted by the Office of Alcohol
Policy and Education (OAPE). The
survey indicated, however, that
Stanford is above average in having
alcohol as the center of campus so
cial life, in hard liquor use and in pre
gaming before events.
According to OAPE Director
Ralph Castro, the survey was con
ducted as part of a larger Stanford
alcohol initiative including the re

cent development of the OAPE of
fice, The office used a standard, na
tional survey from the Core Insti
tute in order to compare responses
to standard questions with survey
results from other institutions.
This year, 583 students took the
survey. Castro said OAPE will con
duct the same survey every year to
evaluate trends over time.
Compared with the national av
erage of 81.7 percent, 79.7 percent of
Stanford students said they had con
sumed alcohol in the past year. The
average number of drinks con
sumed per week fell well below av
erage, at 3.6 versus the national 4.6.

Despite the near average num
bers for overall alcohol consump
tion, Castro said that some of the
more specific drinking habits at
Stanford still might be cause for con
cern and University action.
"We are above national averages
for students who take shots of alco
hol, who drink hard liquor and who
engage in pre-gaming," Castro said.
"Those situations ... are risk factors
for negative consequences to hap
pen."
OAPE added several questions
to the Core Institute survey to eval
