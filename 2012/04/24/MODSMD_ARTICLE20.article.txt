## Men, women finish top-five CARD OVERCOMES TOUGH ODDS AT NATIONAL MEETS 
### CONNOR SCHERER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a thrilling regional competition in which
the Stanford women's gymnastics team barely qual
ified for NCAAs, the Cardinal entered the national
tournament ranked 10th out of 12 teams competing.
Though the team faced an uphill battle, head coach
Kristen Smyth knew that, if her gymnasts could suc
cessfully hit their routines, they could compete with
anyone in the country. She was right,
Stanford was led by freshman Ivana Hong and
sophomore captain Amanda Spinner on the balance
beam and freshman Samantha Shapiro on uneven
bars, all of whom scored 9.900 in their respective
events to help the Cardinal to its first score above
197 in two years and its second-highest score ever at
nationals. By finishing in the top four of their events,
they also earned first-team All-American honors as
well as the chance to compete in the individual com
petitions on Sunday.
