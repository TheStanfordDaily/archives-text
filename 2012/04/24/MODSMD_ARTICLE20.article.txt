## Men, women finish top-five CARD OVERCOMES TOUGH ODDS AT NATIONAL MEETS 
### CONNOR SCHERER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a thrilling regional competition in which
the Stanford women's gymnastics team barely qual
ified for NCAAs, the Cardinal entered the national
tournament ranked 10th out of 12 teams competing.
Though the team faced an uphill battle, head coach
Kristen Smyth knew that, if her gymnasts could suc
cessfully hit their routines, they could compete with
anyone in the country. She was right,
Stanford was led by freshman Ivana Hong and
sophomore captain Amanda Spinner on the balance
beam and freshman Samantha Shapiro on uneven
bars, all of whom scored 9.900 in their respective
events to help the Cardinal to its first score above
197 in two years and its second-highest score ever at
nationals. By finishing in the top four of their events,
they also earned first-team All-American honors as
well as the chance to compete in the individual com
petitions on Sunday.
The national competition is di
vided into two groups of six
teams, with three from each group
moving onto the final Super Six
round. With the lowest score on
the afternoon coming byway of a
196.550, Stanford had to have a
top-notch performance to qualify
for Saturday's Super Six. It did
just that, putting up a season-high
197.125 to advance, barely beat
ing fourth-place Oklahoma, who
was a top-three national finisher
the past two years, by a mere 0.200
points. Finishing ahead of the
Cardinal was UCLA (197.400)
and Utah (197.200), two familiar
Pac-12 opponents.
Stanford also had four com
petitors qualify as second-team
All-Americans by finishing in the
top eight in their events: senior
Alyssa Brown and Hong on vault
(9.900 each), sophomore Shona
Morgan on bars (9.875) and sen
ior Nicole Pechanec on floor
(9.875) and all-around (39.325).
Going into Saturday's Super
Six competition, the Cardinal had
already far surpassed expecta
tions. The team was never ranked
within the top 10 all season long,
and the Super Six broadcast on
ESPN went so far as to call the
Stanford season "a true Cinderel
la story." However, the Cardinal
was not content with settling at
sixth place, as it wanted to make
an even bigger statement.
Though the team was proud of
its 197.125 effort on Friday, it
raised the bar even higher on Sat
urday by posting a score of
197.500, its best championship
score ever. The mark earned the
team a fourth-place finish, its
fourth top-four finish since 2004.
Alabama finished first (197.850),
followed by Florida (197.775),

UCLA (197.750), Stanford, Utah
(197.375) and Arkansas (196.300)
in a competition consisting of
only Pac-12 and SEC teams.
The story of the day was Hong,
who competed in all four events
for the first time all season and
didn't disappoint. Highlighted by
a 9.975 on vault (her best of the
season and tied for second best in
the competition behind a perfect
10 by UCLA's Vanessa Zamarri
pa), Hong scored a 39.475 in the
overall competition, the best all
around score for Stanford this
season. In her first competition on
bars of the year, she scored a
9.875.
Junior Nicole Dayton also had
a career performance on Satur
day, tying her career-best 9.950 on
vault to help lead the team to a
49.550 score in the event, its sec
ond-best vault score in school his
tory. In its final meet, the senior
class elevated its performance.
Brown received a 9.925 on vault
and a 9.900 on bars, while
Pechanec recorded a 9.900 on
both floor and bars.
However, though their team
competition was done, the Stan
ford gymnasts still had more to
settle, as Spinner, Hong and
Shapiro all had work to do in the
individual's competition. Shapiro
led the way, finishing with a 9.900
on the uneven bars to earn herself
second in the entire competition
and becoming only the second
Stanford competitor ever to fin
ish within the top two in the
event. Hong and Spinner tied for
fourth on the balance beam with a
9.875 to cap off a truly incredible
season for women's gymnastics.
The Stanford men had a very
similar weekend, astonishing or a
team so badly marred by injuries
all season long. Fielding just a 10-
person team entering the final
weekend, the Stanford gymnasts
knew they would all have to be on
their game in order to make a
statement in their attempt to de

fend their national title.
First, however, they had to
earn the opportunity to defend
their crown, as they had to get
through the field of six teams on
Thursday in the qualifying meet.
The Cardinal posted a score of
348.500, just good enough to qual
ify for Friday's competition.
Thursday's meet was highlighted
by the work of junior Eddie
Penev, who led the team in typical
fashion. His 15.750 on floor
earned him second in the event,
while his 15.450 on vault gave him
the individual victory. His overall
score of 87.150 was good for sec
ond in the entire competition.
Other notables were redshirt
freshman Sean Senters on vault
(15.250) and redshirt junior
Cameron Foreman (15.100) on
parallel bars.
On Friday, the undermanned
Stanford team had the daunting
task of protecting its national
title, a task that the team was ulti
mately unable to handle. The
team finished with a team score of
352.650, earning Stanford a fifth
place finish behind Illinois
(358.850), Oklahoma (357.450),
Penn State (354.800) and Cal
(353.000). Though this is just the
first time in seven years under
head coach Thorn Glielmi that the
men's gymnastics team has fin
ished worse than third, his entire
team will return next year to try to
reclaim its throne.
Penev, however, dominated
Saturday's individual competi
tion, as he earned the national
championship in both floor and
vault.These two first-place finish
es gave him three total national ti
tles in his career, as he won vault
as a freshman. Foreman, Senters
and redshirt sophomore Paul
Hichwa also earned Ail-Ameri
can honors to wrap up a success
ful season for the Cardinal.

overall competition, the best all
around score for Stanford this
season. In her first competition on
bars of the year, she scored a
9.875.
Junior Nicole Dayton also had
a career performance on Satur
day, tying her career-best 9.950 on
vault to help lead the team to a
49.550 score in the event, its sec
ond-best vault score in school his
tory. In its final meet, the senior
class elevated its performance.
Brown received a 9.925 on vault
and a 9.900 on bars, while
Pechanec recorded a 9.900 on
both floor and bars.
However, though their team
competition was done, the Stan
ford gymnasts still had more to
settle, as Spinner, Hong and
Shapiro all had work to do in the
individual's competition. Shapiro
led the way, finishing with a 9.900
on the uneven bars to earn herself
second in the entire competition
and becoming only the second
Stanford competitor ever to fin
ish within the top two in the
event. Hong and Spinner tied for
fourth on the balance beam with a
9.875 to cap off a truly incredible
season for women's gymnastics.
The Stanford men had a very
similar weekend, astonishing or a
team so badly marred by injuries
all season long. Fielding just a 10-
person team entering the final
weekend, the Stanford gymnasts
knew they would all have to be on
their game in order to make a
statement in their attempt to de

fend their national title.
First, however, they had to
earn the opportunity to defend
their crown, as they had to get
through the field of six teams on
Thursday in the qualifying meet.
The Cardinal posted a score of
348.500, just good enough to qual
ify for Friday's competition.
Thursday's meet was highlighted
by the work of junior Eddie
Penev, who led the team in typical
fashion. His 15.750 on floor
earned him second in the event,
while his 15.450 on vault gave him
the individual victory. His overall
score of 87.150 was good for sec
ond in the entire competition.
Other notables were redshirt
freshman Sean Senters on vault
(15.250) and redshirt junior
Cameron Foreman (15.100) on
parallel bars.
On Friday, the undermanned
Stanford team had the daunting
task of protecting its national
title, a task that the team was ulti
mately unable to handle. The
team finished with a team score of
352.650, earning Stanford a fifth
place finish behind Illinois
(358.850), Oklahoma (357.450),
Penn State (354.800) and Cal
(353.000). Though this is just the
first time in seven years under
head coach Thorn Glielmi that the
men's gymnastics team has fin
ished worse than third, his entire
team will return next year to try to
reclaim its throne.
Penev, however, dominated
Saturday's individual competi
tion, as he earned the national
championship in both floor and
vault.These two first-place finish
es gave him three total national ti
tles in his career, as he won vault
as a freshman. Foreman, Senters
and redshirt sophomore Paul
Hichwa also earned Ail-Ameri
can honors to wrap up a success
ful season for the Cardinal.

After a thrilling regional competition in which
the Stanford women's gymnastics team barely qual
ified for NCAAs, the Cardinal entered the national
tournament ranked 10th out of 12 teams competing.
Though the team faced an uphill battle, head coach
Kristen Smyth knew that, if her gymnasts could suc
cessfully hit their routines, they could compete with
anyone in the country. She was right,
Stanford was led by freshman Ivana Hong and
sophomore captain Amanda Spinner on the balance
beam and freshman Samantha Shapiro on uneven
bars, all of whom scored 9.900 in their respective
events to help the Cardinal to its first score above
197 in two years and its second-highest score ever at
nationals. By finishing in the top four of their events,
they also earned first-team All-American honors as
well as the chance to compete in the individual com
petitions on Sunday.
The national competition is di
vided into two groups of six
teams, with three from each group
moving onto the final Super Six
round. With the lowest score on
the afternoon coming byway of a
196.550, Stanford had to have a
top-notch performance to qualify
for Saturday's Super Six. It did
just that, putting up a season-high
197.125 to advance, barely beat
ing fourth-place Oklahoma, who
was a top-three national finisher
the past two years, by a mere 0.200
points. Finishing ahead of the
Cardinal was UCLA (197.400)
and Utah (197.200), two familiar
Pac-12 opponents.
Stanford also had four com
petitors qualify as second-team
All-Americans by finishing in the
top eight in their events: senior
Alyssa Brown and Hong on vault
(9.900 each), sophomore Shona
Morgan on bars (9.875) and sen
ior Nicole Pechanec on floor
(9.875) and all-around (39.325).
Going into Saturday's Super
Six competition, the Cardinal had
already far surpassed expecta
tions. The team was never ranked
within the top 10 all season long,
and the Super Six broadcast on
ESPN went so far as to call the
Stanford season "a true Cinderel
la story." However, the Cardinal
was not content with settling at
sixth place, as it wanted to make
an even bigger statement.
Though the team was proud of
its 197.125 effort on Friday, it
raised the bar even higher on Sat
urday by posting a score of
197.500, its best championship
score ever. The mark earned the
team a fourth-place finish, its
fourth top-four finish since 2004.
Alabama finished first (197.850),
followed by Florida (197.775),

UCLA (197.750), Stanford, Utah
(197.375) and Arkansas (196.300)
in a competition consisting of
only Pac-12 and SEC teams.
The story of the day was Hong,
who competed in all four events
for the first time all season and
didn't disappoint. Highlighted by
a 9.975 on vault (her best of the
season and tied for second best in
the competition behind a perfect
10 by UCLA's Vanessa Zamarri
pa), Hong scored a 39.475 in the
overall competition, the best all
around score for Stanford this
season. In her first competition on
bars of the year, she scored a
9.875.
