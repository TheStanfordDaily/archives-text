## Human rights groups consider collaboration Focus group explores common goals, potential for human rights minor 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
"You're the engine of improving the world
today," said Helen Stacy, a senior fellow at the
Freeman Spogli Institute (FSI) for Interna
tional Studies, to a student activism focus
group Monday evening. "So we want to give
you more of what you need to be a platform
to help you spread your word."
Stacy, a coordinator of FSl's Program on

Human Rights (PHR); Nadejda Marques,
PHR program manager; and four members of
the student advisory board hosted PHR's first
coalition meeting with students Monday at
Koret Pavillion to discuss how the program
can better support the needs of students inter
ested in human rights academically or ex
tracurricularly.
Student leaders representing Six Degrees,
Stanford Amnesty International, Stanford
Students for Palestinian Equal Rights
(SPER), Stanford Students for Queer Libera
tion (SSQL), Stanford Students Say No to War
(SSNW) and STAND attended the event.
Stacy began by explaining PHR's main ob
jectives.

"We have a goal of being, first of all, a melt
ing pot of human rights research from around
the University," Stacy said. "Our first function
is to be a place where human rights is broadly
defined, and faculty, researchers and students
can find a home."
Stacy added that PHR's second goal is to
raise awareness and attract Stanford research
on a different human rights topic each year.
This year's topic is human trafficking, she said.
Stacy said that PHR needs student input to
determine these topics.
"In years going forward, we want to make
sure our student advisors are responding to

Members of student groups concerned with human rights gathered Monday night in a focus group to determine how their groups might share
resources and work to collaborate on their campus intiatives. The focus group also discussed the possible creation of a minor in human rights.
the human rights issues [students]
think are hot that need atten
tion right now, that need action,
research, activism, focus by the
University and focus by the
world," she said.
Student advisory board and
STAND member Jared Naimark
'l4 said that the best way to
achieve this task is to facilitate
better coordination of informa
tion about student groups, aca
demic programs and research op
portunities.
"We don't necessarily have a
grand vision for what this entity
that we're forming is going to
look like, but I think the idea of
having representatives from all
these different human rights
groups come together every once
in a while and talking about what
they're doing with their group
would make that process of col
laboration a lot smoother,"
Naimark said.
Naimark added that another
goal of the PHR coalition is to ex
plore ways to connect student
groups to academic research from
FSI associates.

Tessa Ormenyi 'l4, another ad
visory board member and a partic
ipant in SSQL, discussed some ini
tiatives the group is considering,
including putting together a ca
reer and internship database in
human rights and having PHR
help facilitate student events.
Stacy and Marques addressed
implementation of such ideas by
calling for a consolidation of re
sources.
"What I think we might be able
to do with some collective action
is to maintain a database of pro
fessors who are working in human
rights, who are teaching human
rights units ... [and] professors
who are willing to supervise
longer-term research projects in
their particular field of expertise,"
Stacy said.
PHR currently hosts lists of af
filiated faculty and courses and
student groups, but neither of
these lists reflects information
from the current academic year.
In terms of institutional sup
port for student groups and
events, Stacy added that PHR
currently offers small grants
from $lOO to $2OO to help
groups purchase refreshments
for events.

Marques said that PHR cur
rently uses its Facebook group to
publicize events that student

groups send to it, but does not post
the events on its official website.
Marques also commented on
the potential for a minor in human
rights.
"Ultimately what we want is to
have the University offer human
rights as a concentration," Mar
ques said.
"The idea is to persuade the
University that there's enough
student interest at Stanford, that
interest has been sustained over
time and that there's student de
mand that the University has to
supply," Stacy said. "We're in a po
sition to make that case, provided
that we've kept track of the steps
leading up to it."
Stacy concluded that an official
academic program in human
rights would improve how Stan
ford contributes to the field in re
lation to its peers.
"We want to make sure Stan
ford has a similar human rights
presence at the undergraduate
and graduate levels as other uni
versities," she said. "Right now
we don't, and we need to fix it."
When addressing challenges
facing student action groups, the
focus group commented that it's
difficult to see which campus
events are taking place and that
co-sponsoring with other groups
or even asking other organi

zations to forward information to
other mailing lists has not been
very successful.
"If we could have someone
from each group who knows
everyone else in the other human
rights groups, it would make it eas
ier [to co-sponsor and publicize],"
Naimark said, speaking from his
involvement with STAND.
Marques clarified that
PHR does not wish to make
student groups dependent on
one another.
"It's not centralizing it's
more coordination," Marques said
at the conclusion of the meeting.
"We want to be able to coordinate
the work of different groups on
campus."
Tenzin Seldon 'l2, a member of
PHR's advisory group, comment
ed on what she hopes will develop
going forward. Seldon serves as
student-at-large on The Daily's
Board of Directors.
"My hope is that this advisory
group can echo the sentiments of
what Stanford students want and
need and should have on campus,"
Seldon said. "I hope that students
with an interest in human rights
can find every channel... every
avenue to get involved."
