"You're the engine of improving the world

Stacy, a coordinator of FSl's Program on

Human Rights (PHR); Nadejda Marques,
PHR program manager; and four members of
the student advisory board hosted PHR's first
coalition meeting with students Monday at
Koret Pavillion to discuss how the program
can better support the needs of students inter

tracurricularly.
Student leaders representing Six Degrees,
Stanford Amnesty International, Stanford
Students for Palestinian Equal Rights
(SPER), Stanford Students for Queer Libera

(SSNW) and STAND attended the event.
Stacy began by explaining PHR's main ob

the University," Stacy said. "Our first function
is to be a place where human rights is broadly
defined, and faculty, researchers and students
can find a home."
Stacy added that PHR's second goal is to
raise awareness and attract Stanford research
on a different human rights topic each year.
This year's topic is human trafficking, she said.
Stacy said that PHR needs student input to
determine these topics.
"In years going forward, we want to make
sure our student advisors are responding to
