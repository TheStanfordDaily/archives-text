## NYC mayor awards NYU public land Stanford admins frustrated by restraints on disclosing University proposed 
### BILLY GALLAGHER MANAGING EDITOR 
New York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg awarded New York
University (NYU) public land in
downtown Brooklyn Monday to
build an applied sciences campus.
NYU is the second winner, fol
lowing Cornell in December, in
the mayor's competition granting
city money to boost the New
York's technology sector.
The announcement comes
months after Stanford abruptly
withdrew its bid three days be
fore Cornell was announced the
winner.
"We are really happy for
NYU," Stanford spokeswoman
Lisa Lapin said. "It's a much
smaller concept than ours. But it's
something that we supported."
According to Bloomberg
News, Carnegie Mellon Universi
ty, the City University of New
York, the University of Toronto,
the University of Warwick, the In
dian Institute of Technology
Bombay, IBM and Cisco Systems
will all be involved in the consor
tium with NYU.
The announcement came just
hours after The New Yorker pub
lished a lengthy piece about Stan
ford, a significant portion of which
covered the University's decision
to withdraw its bid in the New
York competition.
"Publicly, the university was
vague about the decision [to with
draw], and, in a statement, [Presi
dent John Hennessy] praised 'the
mayor's bold vision,"' wrote Ken
Auletta in The New Yorker. "But
he was seething. In January, he
told me that the city had changed
the terms of the proposed deal.
After seven universities had sub
mitted their bids, he said, the city
suddenly wanted Stanford to
agree that the campus would be
operational, with a full comple
ment of faculty, sooner than Stan
ford thought was feasible."
Stanford's general counsel and
lead negotiator Debra Zumwalt
told The New Yorker that the city
added "many millions of dollars
in penalties that were not in the
original proposal, including pe
nalizing Stanford for failure to
obtain approvals on a certain
schedule, even if the delays were
the fault of the city and not Stan
ford."
"I have been a lawyer for over
thirty years, and I have never seen
negotiations that were handled so
poorly by a reputable party,"
Zumwault added.
The New Yorker piece pre
sented some of the first new infor

mation to come out regarding
Stanford's bid since January.
According to Lapin, Stanford
has not been able to release its
$2.5 billion proposal, which cost
the University $3 million, to the
public because the mayor's office
and the New York City Economic
Development Corporation said
the competition was still ongoing.
"In the interest of transparen
cy, we should be allowed to share
our proposal," Lapin said. "It's
not a situation that's competitive
with anything else still being pro
posed or negotiated. Were very
frustrated that the city doesn't
want our proposal to be seen."
In a Monday press release, the
mayor's office wrote, "Collective
ly, these institutions along with
other potential winners will fur
ther strengthen New York City's
global competiveness."
This could potentially mean
that the city will continue the
competition, despite already se
lecting two winners. By continu
ing the competition, New York
may be able to prevent Stanford
from releasing its proposal be
cause of previous non-disclo
sure agreements between the
two parties.
"We remain frustrated at the
delays which are now many
months beyond their original in
tended announcement date,"
Lapin wrote in an email to The
Daily.
