## Research ties death rates, social factors 
### ARIELLA AXLER 
Internal Medicine Professor Mark Cullen and his
interdisciplinary research team published a study last
week that illustrates the relationship between death
rates and socioeconomic and environmental variables.
Cullen and his research team focused the study on 22
socioeconomic and environmental variables that to
gether prove to be better indicators of early death than
race or geography.
A few years ago, Victor Fuchs, professor of econom
ics and health research and policy, contacted Cullen to
become involved in research assessing trends in mor
tality rates. As a result, Cullen launched the study with
Fuchs.
"The study was a self-initiated idea," Cullen said.
"We wanted to make some sense of the enormous
scope of disparity of death in the country and come up
with a unified explanation."
U.S. life expectancy varies widely by geographical
location, race and other contextual factors, and
Cullen's team sought to make some sense of the trends.
One way of assessing death rates is to examine mor
tality statistics. However, Cullen said that these indica
tors often don't illustrate specific details about those
who died. Instead, studying the lifestyles of different
communities and individuals can serve as important
information to understand the determinants of mor-
tality rates.
"Interdependence is always a
question," Cullen said. "Variables
such as income, education and
marital status are huge predictors
for accounting for death rates.
When you assess the latter factors
in correlation to behavior, such as
diet and smoking, they demon
strate a heavy dependence."
Every 10 years, national census
data accounts for population num
bers, geographical distribution and
other statistical factors. About one
in 20 families gets a long form with
detailed questions about lifestyle
factors, such as income, house
ownership, marital status and edu
cation. With this information,
along with statistics about death
rates from various counties, the
study discovered the extent to
which different variables are rele
vant to death rates.
In addition to census data, the
research team looked further into

the multidimensional factors that
impact populations and corre
spond to disparities in health out
comes.
"Equally high-quality data can
be drawn from publicly available
data sets," Cullen said. "For exam
ple, from [the Environmental Pro
tection Agency], you can look at
data about air pollution; from the
Oceanic Institute, you can get in
formation about climate;from var
ious sources, you can look at rat
ings about hospitals; or you can use
surveys from [the Centers for Dis
ease Control] about population
behavior."
The study incorporated wide
spread public data, assessing ap
proximately 570 counties that
have equal racial distributions of
whites and blacks. Despite the di
versity of the locations, transpar
ent trends emerged from the data.
"Many social factors are inter
related; however, what's not inter
related is geography and race,"
Cullen said. "Where black people
enjoy high levels of education,
they do as well as white counter
parts. Flowever, for gender there is
a difference. Women can have the

same education and resources, yet
do much better than men. This is
something we are still trying to ex
plain."
The study returned clear
trends in its results, which may
help to advance public concep
tions of welfare and healthcare
necessities.
"Think about how different
each city is, from the Bronx to Los
Angeles, from San Francisco to
Atlanta; yet every country falls
into same blanket," Cullen said.
"Once you know the major deter
minants, you can almost always
predict the death rates."
Cullen and his research group
plan to expand the study and look
at transnational trends of death
rates. On a domestic level, howev
er, the research points out impor
tant information for national
healthcare priorities.
"In the national debate about

changing the healthcare system, if
you want to level the playing field
for health, you should invest in edu
cation, housing, job quality and so
cial welfare, because those are
where the differences in death rates
are made up," Cullen said.
As these results indicate the in
fluence of social policy on health,
the research findings may have im
plications for the political domain.
"All policy is actually health pol
icy the environment, making
housing better, improving the job
market," Cullen said. "From the
point of view of public health, all in
vestments affect public health. If
you want to help communities
maintain better health, it is impor
tant not just to run and get more
doctors; rather it is critical to im
prove the social fabric."

Internal Medicine Professor Mark Cullen and his
interdisciplinary research team published a study last
week that illustrates the relationship between death
rates and socioeconomic and environmental variables.
Cullen and his research team focused the study on 22
socioeconomic and environmental variables that to
gether prove to be better indicators of early death than
race or geography.
A few years ago, Victor Fuchs, professor of econom
ics and health research and policy, contacted Cullen to
become involved in research assessing trends in mor
tality rates. As a result, Cullen launched the study with
Fuchs.
"The study was a self-initiated idea," Cullen said.
"We wanted to make some sense of the enormous
scope of disparity of death in the country and come up
with a unified explanation."
U.S. life expectancy varies widely by geographical
location, race and other contextual factors, and
Cullen's team sought to make some sense of the trends.
One way of assessing death rates is to examine mor
tality statistics. However, Cullen said that these indica
tors often don't illustrate specific details about those
who died. Instead, studying the lifestyles of different
communities and individuals can serve as important
information to understand the determinants of mor-
tality rates.
"Interdependence is always a
question," Cullen said. "Variables
such as income, education and
marital status are huge predictors
for accounting for death rates.
When you assess the latter factors
in correlation to behavior, such as
diet and smoking, they demon
strate a heavy dependence."
Every 10 years, national census
data accounts for population num
bers, geographical distribution and
other statistical factors. About one
in 20 families gets a long form with
detailed questions about lifestyle
factors, such as income, house
ownership, marital status and edu
cation. With this information,
along with statistics about death
rates from various counties, the
study discovered the extent to
which different variables are rele
vant to death rates.
In addition to census data, the
research team looked further into

the multidimensional factors that
impact populations and corre
spond to disparities in health out
comes.
"Equally high-quality data can
be drawn from publicly available
data sets," Cullen said. "For exam
ple, from [the Environmental Pro
tection Agency], you can look at
data about air pollution; from the
Oceanic Institute, you can get in
formation about climate;from var
ious sources, you can look at rat
ings about hospitals; or you can use
surveys from [the Centers for Dis
ease Control] about population
behavior."
The study incorporated wide
spread public data, assessing ap
proximately 570 counties that
have equal racial distributions of
whites and blacks. Despite the di
versity of the locations, transpar
ent trends emerged from the data.
"Many social factors are inter
related; however, what's not inter
related is geography and race,"
Cullen said. "Where black people
enjoy high levels of education,
they do as well as white counter
parts. Flowever, for gender there is
a difference. Women can have the

same education and resources, yet
do much better than men. This is
something we are still trying to ex
plain."
The study returned clear
trends in its results, which may
help to advance public concep
tions of welfare and healthcare
necessities.
"Think about how different
each city is, from the Bronx to Los
Angeles, from San Francisco to
Atlanta; yet every country falls
into same blanket," Cullen said.
"Once you know the major deter
minants, you can almost always
predict the death rates."
Cullen and his research group
plan to expand the study and look
at transnational trends of death
rates. On a domestic level, howev
er, the research points out impor
tant information for national
healthcare priorities.
"In the national debate about

changing the healthcare system, if
you want to level the playing field
for health, you should invest in edu
cation, housing, job quality and so
cial welfare, because those are
where the differences in death rates
are made up," Cullen said.
As these results indicate the in
fluence of social policy on health,
the research findings may have im
plications for the political domain.
"All policy is actually health pol
icy the environment, making
housing better, improving the job
market," Cullen said. "From the
point of view of public health, all in
vestments affect public health. If
you want to help communities
maintain better health, it is impor
tant not just to run and get more
doctors; rather it is critical to im
prove the social fabric."
