## Research ties death rates, social factors 
### ARIELLA AXLER 
Internal Medicine Professor Mark Cullen and his
interdisciplinary research team published a study last
week that illustrates the relationship between death
rates and socioeconomic and environmental variables.
Cullen and his research team focused the study on 22
socioeconomic and environmental variables that to
gether prove to be better indicators of early death than
race or geography.
A few years ago, Victor Fuchs, professor of econom
ics and health research and policy, contacted Cullen to
become involved in research assessing trends in mor
tality rates. As a result, Cullen launched the study with
Fuchs.
"The study was a self-initiated idea," Cullen said.
"We wanted to make some sense of the enormous
scope of disparity of death in the country and come up
with a unified explanation."
U.S. life expectancy varies widely by geographical
location, race and other contextual factors, and
Cullen's team sought to make some sense of the trends.
One way of assessing death rates is to examine mor
tality statistics. However, Cullen said that these indica
tors often don't illustrate specific details about those
who died. Instead, studying the lifestyles of different
communities and individuals can serve as important
information to understand the determinants of mor-
