## Minerva Project seeks to create a new model of education 
### AARON SEKHRI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As talk about online education ramps up
nationwide, The Minerva Project aims to
present a new model of higher education.
With Stanford professors Andrew Ng and
Daphne Koller launching online education
start-up Coursera while on sabattical and
Stanford artificial intelligence professor Se
bastian Thrun curbing his Stanford involve
ment to start Udacity, an online university,
Stanford constituents are heavily involved in
determining the future of online education.
The Minerva Project presents an alternative
model with a mixed online and physical pres
ence that could challenge these Stanford ini
tiatives down the road.
The project recently received $25 million
in funding from venture capital firm Bench
mark Capital. The company is currently gen
erating its video lecture content and hopes to
accept its first class of students to begin in
struction in fall 2014.
"Our mission, the reason I founded Min
erva, the reason we exist, is to accelerate the
life trajectory of the smartest, hardest work
ing students in the world," said Ben Nelson,
CEO of The Minerva Project. "Because of
the capacity constraints of elite universities,
the world is losing out."
Minerva hopes to leverage new techno

logical capabilities to create a new pedagogi
cal model: a four-year,residentially based uni
versity of elite students where lectures are de
livered by video and subsequently dissected
and discussed by intimate seminar groups, led
by teachers who have completed doctoral de
grees.
"Why should we charge students for
things that are out there for free, at an incred
ibly high quality?" Nelson said. "We want to
teach students only how to think and how to
do deep analysis."
Nelson said his curriculum will be based
on four "pillars": empirical, theoretical and
systems analysis, complemented by commu
nications.
The first year of a Minerva education
would entail a core curriculum with no elec
tives.
"[The classes] would be less about knowl
edge and more about thinking," Nelson said.
Although Minerva would offer degrees in
subjects similar to those available at existing
universities, the implementation of the edu
cational experience would be almost entirely
different than what is currently available.
The next two years would build on this
foundation, and the fourth year would be a
capstone year in which the knowledge and
skills are integrated into a project, depending
on the students' domain of choice,
Minerva's plan includes physical campus-

es in metropolitan areas, but students will be
encouraged to rotate their living environ
ments and engage with their chosen living
place as a campus, according to Nelson.
The lectures will be delivered by video and
will be specifically designed to optimize the
discussion environment Minerva will create.
Groups of 10 to 25 students in the presence of
a teacher will pause videos sporadically to
discuss what the virtual lecturer has just ex
plained.
"We will never make you watch a class
that you can simply consume," Nelson said.
"The recorded lecture is only there to curate
discussion."
Computer Science Professor Yoav
Shoham, who currently co-teaches an online
course on game theory to an audience of
around 60,000 people around the world, said
he "thinkfs] that this is the decade in which
higher education is going to undergo signifi
cant change. How it will happen, or what the
end result will be, is unclear."
Shoham is particularly concerned with
Minerva's proposed timeline of growth.
"To build an excellent institution takes
decades, at least, if not centuries," Shoham
said.
For this reason, Shoham said he does not
believe that elite universities such as Stanford
should feel threatened, especially if they
adapt to the disruption that new models of

education create.
"This model will really affect the future of
the community colleges and other such insti
tutions," Shoham said.
Nelson said that a comparison to Stanford
is irrelevant.
"We don't need to compete with one an
other. Different students thrive in different
environments, and Minerva is serving a par
ticular breed of students," he said. "The talent
pool is enormous, and our target audience is
that global, brilliant middle class."
Critics, including Shoham, have argued
that Minerva's model will lose out on the "in
teractions between student and teacher."
Nelson conceded this point, but challenged its
relevance.
"When I was at Penn,"he said,"l had three
classes over four years which really changed
me and which I would not be able to replicate
at Minerva. But at the same time, I had about
20 or so which I could not only replicate, but
improve."
Shoham said that the potential for disrup
tion in online education leaves any possibility
on the table.
"I do think that there will be new models
of higher education that will rise to comple
ment existing ones," he said.
