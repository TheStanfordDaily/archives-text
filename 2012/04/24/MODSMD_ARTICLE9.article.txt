# NEWS BRIEF
## ASSU proposes 'bro tank' uniform 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Brendan O'Byrne 
"No one ever comes to ASSU
Senate meetings besides the elect
ed Senate ... and sometimes, not
even all the senators are present."
"Most students in the student
body don't know what the ASSU
Senate 'actually does.'"
"The student body doesn't even
know when ASSU Senate public
meetings are."
These criticisms come from
within the ASSU Senate in a bill
drafted by current Senator Brian
na Pang 'l3 and co-sponsored by
three other sitting senators, pro
posing a unique solution to the
Senate 's lack of visibility.
The bill proposes that senators
be required to wear "bro tanks"
with the words "What is an ASSU
Senator?" on the front and "I'm an
ASSU Senator, silly!" on the back
on the day of Senate meetings. The
bill is a throwback to a constitu
tional amendment suggested by
the Senate in 1994 requiring simi
lar attire to be worn by current rep
resentatives. The amendment,
which was endorsed by The Stan
ford Daily editorial board, passed
and was implemented for one year.
Former Elections Commission
er Adam Adler 'l2 added several
suggestions Monday, some of them
mocking the current Senate, in an
email over the Senate's public
email list. One suggestion recom
mended the shirt read, "What's an
ASSU Senator do?" on the front
and "Nothing, silly! We can't even
show up to make quorum!" on the
back, referencing the Senate's lack
of attendance and tangible objec
tives in recent weeks. He also rec
ommended the rule only be re
pealed if unanimously decided
upon by all senators and Graduate
Student Council members.
Additionally, a bill inserting
new language to the non-discrimi
nation clause of the ASSU bylaws
will be introduced at the Senate's
Tuesday meeting. The addition
prohibits discrimination on the
basis of "gender identity," "nation
al origin," "religious beliefs or lack
thereof," socioeconomic status
and/or veteran status. The bylaws
already prohibit discrimination
based on gender, nationality and
religion, among other categories.
