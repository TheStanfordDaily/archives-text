## Keeping the CoHo 
### â€“ Erika Alvero Koski 
Located in the heart of campus,
nestled between The Treehouse
and Union Square cafeteria, the
Coffee House (CoHo) has be
come a popular landmark at
Stanford. Embellished with cartoons of
famous Stanford graduates, the dimly lit
eatery hosts a variety of events, from mu
sical performances to storytelling nights.
Behind the bustle of the CoHo however,
lies a tumultuous past.
In the summer of 1966, the precursor to
the CoHo, the ASSU Coffee House (AS
SUCH) opened in the old International
Center, filling the need for a student social
location.
"The coffee house met the need for a
student gathering place with more privacy
and atmosphere than the Union," a Daily
editorial argued ("The Coffee House,"
Oct. 4,1966).
However, this gathering place faced

opposition from Associate Dean
of Students Joel Smith, who feared
that AS-SUCH could be used as a
place for "heavy drug trafficking."
Smith suggested that coffee hous
es be placed instead in individual
residences across campus.
The Daily editorial, however,
argued, "with most graduate stu
dents and many undergraduates
living off campus, it seems unwise
to tie the concept to a living
group."
After negotiating with the
ASSU to manage potential drug
trafficking, the problem then be
came location. With limited space
on campus for a coffee house, stu
dents protested that the Universi
ty was de-prioritizing student is
sues.
"It is more important that the
various departments have more
space than that the students have
a place where a much-needed
type of learning and development
might go on," wrote Tim Haight
'66 Ph.D. '79 in a Daily editorial
("Coffee house controversy
stalled," Oct. 21,1966).
The controversy ended when
the Coffee House found a home

at Tresidder Union.
In 1980, Coffee House Inc. was
established as a subsidiary organ
ization of the ASSU. Coffee
House Inc. then won the bid for
operation of the Coffee House,
setting up a board of directors to
run the organization.
"The board, which is com
prised of 10 members from the
student body, alumni, staff and
faculty of the University, will be in
charge of establishing short- and
long-term goals for the Coffee
House and will work to make sure
that it fits into the Tresidder
framework," reported The Daily
("Butterfield to head Coffee
House board," April 23,1980).
While the CoHo was destined
for closure in September 2007
due to Old Union renovations,
students demanded its return. It
was re-opened in June 2008 as a
collaborative effort between Ray
Klein, also owner and manager of
The Treehouse, and Stanford Stu
dent Enterprises (SSE). SSE was
in charge of social events, in the
hopes of making the CoHo more
appealing to students.
Throughout multiple closures
and controversy, the CoHo has
managed to keep its place on
campus, aided by a supportive
student body.
