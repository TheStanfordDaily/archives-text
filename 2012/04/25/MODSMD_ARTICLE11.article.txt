## EDITORIAL Google Apps transition flawed, confusing 
### 
On April 17, certain Stan
ford undergraduates were
offered the opportunity to
be among the first to transition
their University IT services
email, calendar, contacts, etc.
to Google Apps. By July 13, the
current Zimbra service will be re
tired, to be wholly replaced by
Google's offering. The history of
this transition is somewhat ironic.
Yahoo's Zimbra itself supplanted
Oracle Webmail in 2008, beating
out bids from Microsoft's Out
look / Exchange and Google's
Gmail for the Stanford contract.
Four years later, Gmail has
emerged victorious.
Like any transition, we do not
expect the change to be seamless.
Any students or staff who access
their Stanford email through an
email client on a smartphone
or desktop application like Thun
derbird or Alpine will need to
manually reconfigure their set
tings. Likewise, any filters or email
signatures set up in Zimbra will
need to be manually reimple
mented in Gmail. These one-time
costs are to be expected with any
IT transition of this magnitude,
and Google Apps will likely deliv
er tangible benefits for the Uni
versity. Google's vast infrastruc
ture will offer better uptime while
reducing costs; Vanderbilt Uni
versity reportedly saved $750,000
in its transition to Google Apps.
However, other aspects of the
transition are troubling. As cur
rently published, after a user en
ables and first logs into her
Google Apps account, she is pre
sented with a Google-branded
page with a large, boldfaced "I ac
cept. Continue to my account"
button next to a diminutive "can
cel" button.This "I accept" button
binds the user to Google's terms
of service and privacy policy for
"Additional Services," such as
Google Search, that fall outside

the scope of Stanford's agree
ment.
If a user finds these terms dis
tasteful, she must know in ad
vance to click "cancel" and file a
HelpSU ticket just to migrate her
account. These directions were
buried in a lengthy email to stu
dents and staff and they appear
nowhere on the page, meaning
most users will just blindly click
through. The specific terms of
service and privacy policy are the
oft-criticized agreements re
leased this March. The new policy
allows Google to share user data
across more than 60 of Google's
services, making it impossible for
users to control how their data is
used amongst unrelated products
in Google's vast universe of on
line services. Stanford's agree
ment with Google only covers
core services like Gmail and Cal
endar; Google's regular con
sumer agreements cover the rest
of the services provided to users,
and the signup page actively en
courages users to sign a momen
tous agreement without under
standing the implications of the
agreement.
Essentially, the design of the
migration process encourages
users to agree to a set of con
tentious terms with Google that
have nothing to do with Universi
ty email or calendar. And if you
don't like Google's controversial
terms, you're punished by being
denied access to your Stanford
email until your HelpSU ticket is
processed. This is deceitful and
wholly unacceptable for a service
as critical as official University
email. The Editorial Board is dis
appointed that Stanford IT Serv
ices is seemingly disinterested in
ensuring respectful business prac
tices by its official partners, and
the Board calls upon Stanford to
clean up this poorly implemented
migration process.
