# BURSTING THE BUBBLE
## To the profros 
### Edward Ngai 
With Admit Weekend be
ginning tomorrow, per
haps it is proper for me
to wax poetic a little about the
school I love.
Stanford University is an
amazing place. We're 8,000-some
acres, embraced by a bubble of
sunshine, camaraderie and talent.
The world is different here, in one
of the most privileged zip codes in
the most privileged country in the
world. We sit in our seminar
rooms, asked by the Nobel Laure
ate standing before us to help her
tackle the problem she wrote
about last week. We live among
Olympians, Mensa members and
number one overall draft picks.
We call Pulitzer Prize winners by
their first names.
When you walk onto campus
this weekend, you will surely feel
the embrace of the famous Stan
ford bubble. Strangers will cheer
for you. People will throw free
stuff your way. The Band will start
playing in front of MemAud, and
you will be escorted away for a
weekend full of programming
that is supposed to show you what
it's like to be a Stanford student.
Life in the bubble will seem
perfect. And for many, it is. But no
matter what your parents and col
lege counselors and all your re
jected peers may think, Stanford
isn't perfect, at least not for every
one.
First, I should start off by say
ing that it does rain at Stanford (as
it should tomorrow, if the meteo
rologists are to be trusted). There
will be a few full weeks of rain per
year and if you're from a rainy
city like me and expected year
round tanning weather, temper
those temperature expectations.
Second, know that the culture
you will experience this weekend

is probably a small part of the
Stanford community. People
being hosted in FloMo will proba
bly have a different experience
from someone living in Burbank
(and its, what,five fuzzies?) for ex
ample. Just because your room
host isn't a part of something
doesn't mean it's not here for you.
In fact, it probably is, and the fact
that some don't know of its exis
tence is a testament to how busy
and how involved students are at
this school.
Third, know that Stanford
might not be for you. I've only

ProFros should
know why our
campus culture
sets us apart from
other comparable
schools.
