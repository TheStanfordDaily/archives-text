# BURSTING THE BUBBLE
## To the profros 
### Edward Ngai 
With Admit Weekend be
ginning tomorrow, per
haps it is proper for me
to wax poetic a little about the
school I love.
Stanford University is an
amazing place. We're 8,000-some
acres, embraced by a bubble of
sunshine, camaraderie and talent.
The world is different here, in one
of the most privileged zip codes in
the most privileged country in the
world. We sit in our seminar
rooms, asked by the Nobel Laure
ate standing before us to help her
tackle the problem she wrote
about last week. We live among
Olympians, Mensa members and
number one overall draft picks.
We call Pulitzer Prize winners by
their first names.
When you walk onto campus
this weekend, you will surely feel
the embrace of the famous Stan
ford bubble. Strangers will cheer
for you. People will throw free
stuff your way. The Band will start
playing in front of MemAud, and
you will be escorted away for a
weekend full of programming
that is supposed to show you what
it's like to be a Stanford student.
Life in the bubble will seem
perfect. And for many, it is. But no
matter what your parents and col
lege counselors and all your re
jected peers may think, Stanford
isn't perfect, at least not for every
one.
First, I should start off by say
ing that it does rain at Stanford (as
it should tomorrow, if the meteo
rologists are to be trusted). There
will be a few full weeks of rain per
year and if you're from a rainy
city like me and expected year
round tanning weather, temper
those temperature expectations.
Second, know that the culture
you will experience this weekend

is probably a small part of the
Stanford community. People
being hosted in FloMo will proba
bly have a different experience
from someone living in Burbank
(and its, what,five fuzzies?) for ex
ample. Just because your room
host isn't a part of something
doesn't mean it's not here for you.
In fact, it probably is, and the fact
that some don't know of its exis
tence is a testament to how busy
and how involved students are at
this school.
Third, know that Stanford
might not be for you. I've only

ProFros should
know why our
campus culture
sets us apart from
other comparable
schools.

been here 25 weeks, so I still
know little about a school that is
far too complex to experience
fully, even in four years. But I can
reflect a little on my experience
here so far and urge you to think
carefully about your decision to
come here.
People are very happy and
busy here. Which is to say, people
seem happy and busy here. Tins
weekend's all-smiles attitude
isn't just a show that's really
the way we are year round. But
with that come challenges that
you will inevitably confront
should you decide to matriculate
here; when you are feeling down,
you will feel low. And you might
feel alone, though you will surely
not be, because everyone's hap
piness is so pervasive and oppres
sive that many feel guilty, or
wrong, for being sad. That's the
foundation of the sociological
condition which bears our name
the Stanford Duck Syndrome
which tells of the average
Stanford student: blithely gliding
on the surface, paddling furiously
for traction underneath.
Finally, know why Stanford
culture sets us apart from other
comparable schools. You'll find
out early in your first year that
Stanford is a lot less rigid, a lot
less institutionalized, than a lot of

other places. It'll seem like we're
all outside-the-box thinkers
looking for the next big thing.
Start-up this. Entrepreneurship
that. Changing the way we inter
act with our world, all while get
ting rich or saving hungry chil
dren. It's a culture that can be
overwhelming, especially if your
idea of college is a broad-based
time of learning for knowledge's
sake.

In truth, as I look back upon
my first year at Stanford I often
wonder what it would be like at
some of the other schools I was
considering. Stanford was an
anomaly in my application; I ap
plied mostly to small, liberal arts
colleges where everyone knew
everyone else's name, where a
rigorous humanities base was not
scapegoated but something to be
advertised, where the community
worried less about advancing the
world and more about cultivating
their own gardens.
Stanford is not a perfect fit for
everyone. It certainly isn't for me.
But that should not take away
from how remarkable this school
is. Know that there are few places
like this in the world. But also
know that it can't possibly be per
fect for everyone, and that you're
not alone if, despite the smiles,
screams and suffocating happi
ness of everyone around, you
don't quite feel at home here yet.

Still, come to Stanford! But if you
