# MODERN MANNERS
## The importance of staying afloat
### Jeff Mandell 
May is National Water
Safety Month. In prepa
ration for this cultural
milestone, I thought I would share
my own story about why it is a
good idea to be careful around
large bodies of water.
Before I moved into my fresh
man dorm, my first association at
Stanford was with the Lavender
Lollipops. We were a group of
eight freshmen-to-be and two
older leaders participating in
SPOT, the program that offers
pre-orientation camping and
service trips. My fellow Lollipops
were a fun group of people, and
our camping trip was a great expe
rience. As an aside, it should be
noted that our group name was
assigned, not chosen.
The Lollipops went backpack
ing in the Desolation Wilderness
near Lake Tahoe. It is a beautiful
area, featuring alpine forests and
meadows, hidden lakes and
streams and mountains that are
sometimes capped with snow. Our
first day on the trail was an easy
one. The hike was uphill but was
less than two miles, and by
lunchtime we had reached our
camping spot on the shore of a
small lake.
After lunch, we explored the
lake. When a lake is within a cer
tain size range and this one was
vigorous young people will al
ways feel challenged to swim
across it. It's very hard to make an
accurate estimate from memory,
but the lake was perhaps 300
yards across.
Sure enough, we Lollipops de
cided to make a crossing, setting

our sights on the sun-drenched
boulders on the far shore. Most of
the group got into the water to
gether, but I lagged behind be
cause I had scraped my leg on a
rock and was putting on a band
age at the campsite. When I went
down to the shore, the rest of the
group was almost at the other side
of the lake.
I decided to swim as fast as I
could to catch up. Seconds after
plunging into the cold water, I was
swimming freestyle with all the
strength I had.
Going full steam was a stupid
idea for a number of reasons.
First, I had just had a big lunch.
Second, I had not done serious ex
ercise in months, except for a
handful of touch football games.
In high school, I played baseball in
the spring, relaxed in the summer
and then whipped myself into
shape for soccer in the fall and
winter. This being the end of sum
mer, my fitness was at my yearly
low. (Confession: worried about
not being assigned to a physically
challenging trip if I told the truth,
I wrote on the SPOT application
form that I was jogging several
times a week and playing tennis.)
Third, the water was extremely
cold, as it had been formed by
snowmelt. If you're not used to it,
cold water can exhaust you in a
hurry as your body struggles to
stay warm.
Obviously, sprinting tires you
out a lot faster than an easy pace.
Sure enough, I ran out of gas
about halfway across the lake. My
crawl collapsed into a dog paddle
as I desperately propelled myself

forward, suddenly realizing the
danger I was in. I tried to stop for
a rest, but I was breathing so hard
and tiring so quickly that I could
barely float. I had never been in a
direct struggle for survival. Part of
me was expecting a surge of
adrenaline, a burst of strength re
served for when it really counts.
None came, so I just had to keep
paddling, trying not to panic as my
body sank lower into the water.
Once I knew I was going to
make it, I grew calmer, and it be
came laughable how weak I was.
Luckily, the place where I crawled
ashore was a good distance away
from where the other Lollipops
were relaxing in the sun. After all,
it's pretty embarrassing to be the
guy who almost drowns when
everyone else crosses the lake
easily.
As crazy as it sounds, my over
confidence nearly killed me. I had
been a great swimmer my whole
life, and I had routinely won races
in P.E. classes. But that didn't mat
ter when I was alone in that alpine
lake. In retrospect, the week be
fore starting college was an excel
lent time to be reminded that it is
ultimately up to me to keep my
self safe, healthy and afloat.
