## No news for Chi Theta Chi NOT okay 
### LAURA MCMARTIN '14 Chi Theta Chi resident 
The decision to bring Chi Theta Chi under Uni
versity jurisdiction matters a lot to us residents
the underpinning of our culture, the elemen
tal independence that obligates true responsibility to
the house and to each other, has been denied. To what
extent and for how long?
No, I'm really asking.
76. The number of days since Stanford University
administrators informed the Alumni Board of Chi
Theta Chi that our lease would not be renewed for the
upcoming year.
72. The number of days since any official contact
has been made between these administrators and the
current residents of the house.
Clearly, the future of our home our ability to op
erate our house as adults versus the degree to which
we will be swaddled in bureaucratic splints is enor

mously important to us. So why haven't we heard any
news?
Chi Theta Chi's Alumni Board has been negotiat
ing with the University since early February. This has
entailed closed-door meetings with lawyers present . A
single resident, one of our two house managers, was
permitted to attend initial meetings (and has taken on
myriad responsibilities besides). She's dog-tired from
dealing with this, and we're all tired of waiting for an
swers.
It's evident that the Board is working tremendous
ly hard to reach a resolution as soon as possible. We
residents have seen projects directed by the Board
and house managers unfold around us. Some of these
developments we're quite happy to carry out. Others
are to comply with the Universi
ty's modus operandi, one that
tends to exceed code stipulations
and extend into purely aesthetic
preference. We also know the
managers had to fight to preserve,
in the upcoming year, the 11 staff
positions that we value and that
have been historically respected.
Furthermore, we've seen
heightened University presence
in our home. Despite official as
surance that the takeover would
not have an impact on our day-to
day "co-op experience," it has
thus far proved taxing and intru
sive. A crowd of University offi
cials conducted a full house walk
through during finals week of
winter quarter. In the first week
back after break, that same crowd
inspected each and every one of
our personal rooms. Don't forget,
Stanford owns the land, but our
rooms are part of the physical
house that is property of the
Alumni Board.
Despite everything we see in
progress, we have yet to hear our
prospects. Time isn't on our side,
and we fear the University knows
this all too well. We were notified
of the University's decision to
cancel our lease during winter
quarter midterms with zero warn
ing. Now they've pushed back an
important meeting, and further
delayed while their lawyer is on
vacation. The entire process has
been postponed by nearly a
month, without explanation. This
leaves our present community
with only weeks to secure the
lease, while its members face the

tumult of exams, theses deadlines,
and graduation.
What will happen if the Uni
versity continues to simultane
ously stall and encroach? The few
sophomores in the house, like my
self, plan on fighting through until
the end. But where will we be
when no one's left who knew Chi
Theta Chi in all its self-governed
glory? The lack of communica
tion with residents about any sort
of timeline or plan is quite simply
unacceptable.
"Life safety" is the only re
maining reported problem the
administration has with our
home. However, this term re
mains to be defined in any goal
oriented way, considering that
we've passed our most recent
county fire and kitchen inspec
tions, and completed other pro
active improvements. If our
health were truly in the interest of
the University, they would not
leave us in such oblivion.
We residents and our Alumni
Board will do whatever we can to
preserve our home. We have our
hearts in this; the administration
should, too. The ultimate decision
makers are the Vice Provosts of
Student Affairs and Residential &
Dining Enterprises. Their titles
demand a level of responsibility to
and respect for students that we
have yet to observe.
This process is financially
wasteful and emotionally damag
ing. Were it more transparent, we
might be less anxious. But while
we linger in the dark, I, along with
my fellow residents, can see no
reason why the University should
continue to drag its heels in com
ing to a resolution.

ing with the University since early February. This has
entailed closed-door meetings with lawyers present . A
single resident, one of our two house managers, was
permitted to attend initial meetings (and has taken on
myriad responsibilities besides). She's dog-tired from
dealing with this, and we're all tired of waiting for an
swers.
It's evident that the Board is working tremendous
ly hard to reach a resolution as soon as possible. We
residents have seen projects directed by the Board
and house managers unfold around us. Some of these
developments we're quite happy to carry out. Others
are to comply with the Universi
ty's modus operandi, one that
tends to exceed code stipulations
and extend into purely aesthetic
preference. We also know the
managers had to fight to preserve,
in the upcoming year, the 11 staff
positions that we value and that
have been historically respected.
Furthermore, we've seen
heightened University presence
in our home. Despite official as
surance that the takeover would
not have an impact on our day-to
day "co-op experience," it has
thus far proved taxing and intru
sive. A crowd of University offi
cials conducted a full house walk
through during finals week of
winter quarter. In the first week
back after break, that same crowd
inspected each and every one of
our personal rooms. Don't forget,
Stanford owns the land, but our
rooms are part of the physical
house that is property of the
Alumni Board.
Despite everything we see in
progress, we have yet to hear our
prospects. Time isn't on our side,
and we fear the University knows
this all too well. We were notified
of the University's decision to
cancel our lease during winter
quarter midterms with zero warn
ing. Now they've pushed back an
important meeting, and further
delayed while their lawyer is on
vacation. The entire process has
been postponed by nearly a
month, without explanation. This
leaves our present community
with only weeks to secure the
lease, while its members face the

tumult of exams, theses deadlines,
and graduation.
What will happen if the Uni
versity continues to simultane
ously stall and encroach? The few
sophomores in the house, like my
self, plan on fighting through until
the end. But where will we be
when no one's left who knew Chi
Theta Chi in all its self-governed
glory? The lack of communica
tion with residents about any sort
of timeline or plan is quite simply
unacceptable.
"Life safety" is the only re
maining reported problem the
administration has with our
home. However, this term re
mains to be defined in any goal
oriented way, considering that
we've passed our most recent
county fire and kitchen inspec
tions, and completed other pro
active improvements. If our
health were truly in the interest of
the University, they would not
leave us in such oblivion.
We residents and our Alumni
Board will do whatever we can to
preserve our home. We have our
hearts in this; the administration
should, too. The ultimate decision
makers are the Vice Provosts of
Student Affairs and Residential &
Dining Enterprises. Their titles
demand a level of responsibility to
and respect for students that we
have yet to observe.
This process is financially
wasteful and emotionally damag
ing. Were it more transparent, we
might be less anxious. But while
we linger in the dark, I, along with
my fellow residents, can see no
reason why the University should
continue to drag its heels in com
ing to a resolution.
