## A 						SIGH OF RELIEF CARD HOLDS OFF BYU'S LATE-GAME RALLY 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
After dropping its first midweek decision
of the year against San Jose State a week ago,
the No. 9 Stanford baseball team bounced
back at Sunken Diamond last night, piling on
10 runs against BYU and surviving a seven
spot from the Cougars in the top of the eighth
to win 10-9.
The Cardinal (26-10, 8-7 Pac-12) got five
RBI from sophomore rightfielder Austin Wil
son and drew six walks four of them on full
counts to score at least eight runs for the
fourth straight game and dominate the
Cougars (17-15,6-3 WCC) for the first seven

innings. But BYU made a game of it late, and
Stanford needed a crucial defensive play by
substitute first baseman Danny Diekroeger in
the top of the ninth to secure the win.
"We've never seen BYU before, we really
had no scouting report, so we kind of had to go
out there, see some pitches and swing the bat,"
Wilson said. "It shows our team adversity, and
how you never stop battling."
Redshirt sophomore lefthander Garrett
Hughes and junior righthander Sahil Bloom
combined for six three-hit innings, allowing
just one run and facing just four batters over
the minimum.
Stanford's strength was in its youth on
Tuesday, with sophomore second baseman

Brett Michael Doran and freshman catcher
Wayne Taylor making their sixth starts of the
season and coming up with clutch at-bats.
Diekroeger also impressed in his fourth
straight game as the Cardinal's designated hit
ter, getting on base often and coming around
to score twice making it six runs for the
sophomore over that stretch.
"1 think that's one of the big things that's
fueled our bats lately, just the guys that are
getting a chance to play who didn't get to play
earlier in the year," Diekroeger said. "That
kind of was our motto at the beginning of the
year, that anyone can be the lead guy."
Cooling down a bit was freshman third
baseman Alex Blandino named National
Collegiate Baseball Writers' Player of the
Week after hitting four homers and tallying 11
RBI over his last four games who stayed
off the basepaths but added what would turn
out to be the winning run in the bottom of the
eighth on a sac fly.
Junior third baseman Stephen Piscotty
went just l-for-4 and gave up two runs as a re
liever, but he had another solid game in left
field nonetheless, making an incredible sliding
catch up against the bullpen in the top of the
seventh.
Stanford jumped on BYU in the second
after sophomore righty Aaron Miller walked
the bases loaded with no outs. A Wilson single
made it 2-0 and Taylor was hit by a pitch, forc
ing Miller from the game, before Doran sin
gled home two more runs. Junior centerfield
er Tyler Gaffney quickly tacked on another
tally with a sac fly.
Meanwhile, Hughes cruised through the
first three innings, allowing just one hit and
striking out three Cougar batters.
A line drive homer by Wilson to lead off
the bottom of the fourth extended the Stan
ford lead to six, as the sophomore tied a career
high with his fifth homer of the season.
"This weekend I was getting beat a lot with
the fastball, so I made an adjustment with my
hands," Wilson said. "As you can see today, I
was driving the ball very well and hit the home
run."
Taylor didn't give Cougar righty Marc
Oslund any time to collect his thoughts,
launching the next pitch off the left-field wall
for his first career triple. Doran brought Tay
lor home on a sac fly, and the Cardinal led 7-0.
Wilson singled home two more runs in the
fifth before BYU could do any damage, how
ever the Cougars quickly got two straight hits
to lead off the top of the sixth and eventually
brought around their first run of the evening.
"Any time you get that kind of lead, you
can get too comfortable," Diekroeger said.
"We could feel them creeping up on us, and
it's just one of those things where you can't let
that happen."
The Cougars made it 9-5 in the eighth off
freshman righty David Schmidt, who yielded
a leadoff double to senior shortstop Austin
Hall before Hall came home on a Jaycob
Brugman single. Schmidt loaded the bases
and allowed a first-pitch RBI single but re
mained in the game, giving up two more runs
on the next at-bat before being yanked in
favor of Piscotty.
The one-out rally did not end, however,
with sophomore second baseman Adam Law
launching Piscotty's second pitch off the glove
of sophomore Brian Ragira, who had moved
to left in Piscotty's absence, to double home
another run. Senior centerfielder Stephen
Wells followed with a two-run single to reduce
Stanford's lead to just one, but Piscotty got out
the next two batters to end the inning with the


LAN GARCIA-DOTY/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore Austin Wilson had five RBI, including one home run, for Stanford on Tuesday evening
in its win over BYU. The Card carries a four-game win streak into this weekend's series at UCLA.
Cardinal still on top.
Stanford responded by getting
its first three batters on base, and
Blandino gave Stanford some
breathing room with a sac fly into
center, making it 10-8. But BYU
threatened, leading off with a sin
gle and a triple to climb to within
a run yet again. With no outs and
a runner still on third, senior des
ignated hitter Alex Wolfe
chopped to Diekroeger a late
inning defensive substitution
who snagged it with a diving play
and nailed what would have been
the tying run on its way to the
plate. It was his first defensive as
sist in two years on the Farm.
"You've just got to be ready for

anything," Diekroeger said. "I was
playing in and the runner made a
break to home, so I wasn't sure if
he was going to go but he ended
up going."
Two straight strikeouts from
Piscotty who earned his first
career save and the Cardinal
had escaped with the 10-9 win,
carrying a four-game win streak
into a crucial Pac-12 series at No.
11 UCLA this weekend.
"We're trying to come out

strong and do as best as we can
against them, because we know
we're still contending in the Pac
-12," Diekroeger said. "This is one
of the teams you've got to beat."
Stanford trails the Bruins by
one and a half games in confer
ence play, and the teams will open
the series in Los Angeles on Fri
day at 6 p.m.

launching Piscotty's second pitch off the glove
of sophomore Brian Ragira, who had moved
to left in Piscotty's absence, to double home
another run. Senior centerfielder Stephen
Wells followed with a two-run single to reduce
Stanford's lead to just one, but Piscotty got out
the next two batters to end the inning with the

Sophomore Austin Wilson had five RBI, including one home run, for Stanford on Tuesday evening
in its win over BYU. The Card carries a four-game win streak into this weekend's series at UCLA.
Cardinal still on top.
Stanford responded by getting
its first three batters on base, and
Blandino gave Stanford some
breathing room with a sac fly into
center, making it 10-8. But BYU
threatened, leading off with a sin
gle and a triple to climb to within
a run yet again. With no outs and
a runner still on third, senior des
ignated hitter Alex Wolfe
chopped to Diekroeger a late
inning defensive substitution
who snagged it with a diving play
and nailed what would have been
the tying run on its way to the
plate. It was his first defensive as
sist in two years on the Farm.
"You've just got to be ready for

anything," Diekroeger said. "I was
playing in and the runner made a
break to home, so I wasn't sure if
he was going to go but he ended
up going."
Two straight strikeouts from
Piscotty who earned his first
career save and the Cardinal
had escaped with the 10-9 win,
carrying a four-game win streak
into a crucial Pac-12 series at No.
11 UCLA this weekend.
"We're trying to come out

strong and do as best as we can
against them, because we know
we're still contending in the Pac
-12," Diekroeger said. "This is one
of the teams you've got to beat."
Stanford trails the Bruins by
one and a half games in confer

the series in Los Angeles on Fri
day at 6 p.m.

After dropping its first midweek decision
of the year against San Jose State a week ago,
the No. 9 Stanford baseball team bounced
back at Sunken Diamond last night, piling on
10 runs against BYU and surviving a seven
spot from the Cougars in the top of the eighth
to win 10-9.
The Cardinal (26-10, 8-7 Pac-12) got five
RBI from sophomore rightfielder Austin Wil
son and drew six walks four of them on full
counts to score at least eight runs for the
fourth straight game and dominate the
Cougars (17-15,6-3 WCC) for the first seven

innings. But BYU made a game of it late, and
Stanford needed a crucial defensive play by
substitute first baseman Danny Diekroeger in
the top of the ninth to secure the win.
"We've never seen BYU before, we really
had no scouting report, so we kind of had to go
out there, see some pitches and swing the bat,"
Wilson said. "It shows our team adversity, and
how you never stop battling."
Redshirt sophomore lefthander Garrett
Hughes and junior righthander Sahil Bloom
combined for six three-hit innings, allowing
just one run and facing just four batters over
the minimum.
Stanford's strength was in its youth on
Tuesday, with sophomore second baseman

Brett Michael Doran and freshman catcher
Wayne Taylor making their sixth starts of the
season and coming up with clutch at-bats.
Diekroeger also impressed in his fourth
straight game as the Cardinal's designated hit
ter, getting on base often and coming around
to score twice making it six runs for the
sophomore over that stretch.
"1 think that's one of the big things that's
fueled our bats lately, just the guys that are
getting a chance to play who didn't get to play
earlier in the year," Diekroeger said. "That
kind of was our motto at the beginning of the
year, that anyone can be the lead guy."
Cooling down a bit was freshman third
baseman Alex Blandino named National
Collegiate Baseball Writers' Player of the
Week after hitting four homers and tallying 11
RBI over his last four games who stayed
off the basepaths but added what would turn
out to be the winning run in the bottom of the
eighth on a sac fly.
Junior third baseman Stephen Piscotty
went just l-for-4 and gave up two runs as a re
liever, but he had another solid game in left
field nonetheless, making an incredible sliding
catch up against the bullpen in the top of the
seventh.
Stanford jumped on BYU in the second
after sophomore righty Aaron Miller walked
the bases loaded with no outs. A Wilson single
made it 2-0 and Taylor was hit by a pitch, forc
ing Miller from the game, before Doran sin
gled home two more runs. Junior centerfield
er Tyler Gaffney quickly tacked on another
tally with a sac fly.
Meanwhile, Hughes cruised through the
first three innings, allowing just one hit and
striking out three Cougar batters.
A line drive homer by Wilson to lead off
the bottom of the fourth extended the Stan
ford lead to six, as the sophomore tied a career
high with his fifth homer of the season.
"This weekend I was getting beat a lot with
the fastball, so I made an adjustment with my
hands," Wilson said. "As you can see today, I
was driving the ball very well and hit the home
run."
Taylor didn't give Cougar righty Marc
Oslund any time to collect his thoughts,
launching the next pitch off the left-field wall
for his first career triple. Doran brought Tay
lor home on a sac fly, and the Cardinal led 7-0.
Wilson singled home two more runs in the
fifth before BYU could do any damage, how
ever the Cougars quickly got two straight hits
to lead off the top of the sixth and eventually
brought around their first run of the evening.
"Any time you get that kind of lead, you
can get too comfortable," Diekroeger said.
"We could feel them creeping up on us, and
it's just one of those things where you can't let
that happen."
The Cougars made it 9-5 in the eighth off
freshman righty David Schmidt, who yielded
a leadoff double to senior shortstop Austin
Hall before Hall came home on a Jaycob
Brugman single. Schmidt loaded the bases
and allowed a first-pitch RBI single but re
mained in the game, giving up two more runs
on the next at-bat before being yanked in
favor of Piscotty.
