# It's all in the details

Yesterday I watched one
of the most intense
games I've ever seen. It
kept me on the edge of
my seat from start to fin
ish and made me nervous innumer
able times throughout. There was as
much drama in this game as any
game I can remember. And yes, it
was a soccer game.
In fact, it was a soccer game that
finished in a tie. And I know most
people, even most sports fans, in
America would simply stop right
there and just complain about how
boring soccer is. I've heard it all: it's
too slow, there aren't enough goals,
the players flop all the time, nothing
happens, it's not American enough.
And there is some truth to that.
Compared to a sport like football,
where people crash into each other
on every play, slight nicks of the
heel in soccer seem less interesting.
Compared to basketball, where
players score every 20 or 30 sec
onds, the hour-long goal droughts in
soccer can appear boring.
If you can get past that, though,
and really watch the intricacies of
the game, you can see why billions
of people are captivated by soccer.
Yesterday's Champions League
semifinal between Barcelona and
Chelsea was a perfect example of
everything soccer can give you.
There were high stakes: the winner
gets to advance to the final of the
most important club tournament in
the world. There were talented
players: Barcelona's Lionel Messi is
the best player in the world and one
of the best to ever play the game,
and his team is basically a world
wide all-star team, while Chelsea is
one of the richest and most talented
clubs in the world as well.
There was an incredible atmos
phere: even soccer haters have to
acknowledge that the passion of fan
bases for top soccer clubs is impres
sive. Heck, even soccer-challenged
America can produce goosebump
inducing moments like the Portland
Timbers fans singing the national
anthem. The Barcelona fans were
so raucous and formidable that
they were seemingly able to get
Turkish referee Ciineyt Cakir to
show a yellow card to Chelsea
whenever they wanted.
Accordingly, there was also con
troversy: Chelsea captain John
Teny was shown a red card when he
kneed Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez
in the back away from the ball.
Cakir did not even see the play and
only gave the red after being alert
ed by his assistant and then seeing a
magnificent flop from Sanchez.This
came when the match was tied 1-1
on aggregate, and, combined with
the Barcelona goal just six minutes
