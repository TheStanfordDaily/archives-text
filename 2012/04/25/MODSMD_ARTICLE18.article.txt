# It's all in the details

### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Yesterday I watched one
of the most intense
games I've ever seen. It
kept me on the edge of
my seat from start to fin
ish and made me nervous innumer
able times throughout. There was as
much drama in this game as any
game I can remember. And yes, it
was a soccer game.
In fact, it was a soccer game that
finished in a tie. And I know most
people, even most sports fans, in
America would simply stop right
there and just complain about how
boring soccer is. I've heard it all: it's
too slow, there aren't enough goals,
the players flop all the time, nothing
happens, it's not American enough.
And there is some truth to that.
Compared to a sport like football,
where people crash into each other
on every play, slight nicks of the
heel in soccer seem less interesting.
Compared to basketball, where
players score every 20 or 30 sec
onds, the hour-long goal droughts in
soccer can appear boring.
If you can get past that, though,
and really watch the intricacies of
the game, you can see why billions
of people are captivated by soccer.
Yesterday's Champions League
semifinal between Barcelona and
Chelsea was a perfect example of
everything soccer can give you.
There were high stakes: the winner
gets to advance to the final of the
most important club tournament in
the world. There were talented
players: Barcelona's Lionel Messi is
the best player in the world and one
of the best to ever play the game,
and his team is basically a world
wide all-star team, while Chelsea is
one of the richest and most talented
clubs in the world as well.
There was an incredible atmos
phere: even soccer haters have to
acknowledge that the passion of fan
bases for top soccer clubs is impres
sive. Heck, even soccer-challenged
America can produce goosebump
inducing moments like the Portland
Timbers fans singing the national
anthem. The Barcelona fans were
so raucous and formidable that
they were seemingly able to get
Turkish referee Ciineyt Cakir to
show a yellow card to Chelsea
whenever they wanted.
Accordingly, there was also con
troversy: Chelsea captain John
Teny was shown a red card when he
kneed Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez
in the back away from the ball.
Cakir did not even see the play and
only gave the red after being alert
ed by his assistant and then seeing a
magnificent flop from Sanchez.This
came when the match was tied 1-1
on aggregate, and, combined with
the Barcelona goal just six minutes

later, appeared to seal the deal in
favor of Barcelona. As the best club
in the world and the reigning cham
pion at home with a man advantage
and the lead, Barcelona had the
game in the bag.
But that's why they play the
game. Chelsea shocked Barcelona
with a quick break right before
halftime, and a perfect through-ball
from Frank Lampard to Ramires
left the latter in open space.
Ramires calmly chipped the ball
over Barcelona keeper Victor
Valdes with incredible skill to give
Chelsea the first away goal of the
semi, which left the visitors clinging
to an aggregate lead at halftime
(the tiebreaker is away goals.)
The second half was one of the
most nerve-racking experiences
I've had in a long time. As a some
what new follower of soccer, I have
been a fan of Chelsea for the past
few years, and my support was even
stronger in this game given
Chelsea's underdog status. I could
hardly breathe for the entire sec
ond half as Barcelona camped
around the 18-yard box, threaten
ing to score virtually every minute.
Hope appeared lost when Messi,
who had never scored against
Chelsea, stepped up for a penalty
kick in the second half The soccer
gods finally gave Chelsea a break,

though, as Messi hit the crossbar,
and later the post, to keep Chelsea
in front.

The capper came in stoppage
time when possibly the most ma
ligned player in the world, Fernan
do Torres, broke past the Barcelona
defense and stepped around Valdes
to score the dagger.
It was truly incredible. Soccer is
not really a game of stats, but being
a stats lover I have to point out the
ridiculous nature of this semifinal.
Over the two legs, Barcelona out
shot Chelsea 46-12 and held pos
session 72 percent of the time.
Chelsea only managed to get four
shots on goal in three hours on the
field, and one of them was a prayer
from Chelsea's own side of the
field. It was enough, though, as the
other three shots on target found
the back of the net, leading the un
derdogs to an improbable 3-2 win
and a trip to the final.
I know soccer isn't for everyone.
Some people cannot get past the dif
ferent pace and the lack of scoring,
and most won't give it a chance. But
if you consider yourself a real sports
fan, give soccer a shot. You might
just find yourself captivated for
good.

Jacob Jaffe knows one thing for
sure: he doesn't want to go back to
that dark, ignorant world where he
was without "the beautiful game."

Yesterday I watched one
of the most intense
games I've ever seen. It
kept me on the edge of
my seat from start to fin
ish and made me nervous innumer
able times throughout. There was as
much drama in this game as any
game I can remember. And yes, it
was a soccer game.
In fact, it was a soccer game that
finished in a tie. And I know most
people, even most sports fans, in
America would simply stop right
there and just complain about how
boring soccer is. I've heard it all: it's
too slow, there aren't enough goals,
the players flop all the time, nothing
happens, it's not American enough.
And there is some truth to that.
Compared to a sport like football,
where people crash into each other
on every play, slight nicks of the
heel in soccer seem less interesting.
Compared to basketball, where
players score every 20 or 30 sec
onds, the hour-long goal droughts in
soccer can appear boring.
If you can get past that, though,
and really watch the intricacies of
the game, you can see why billions
of people are captivated by soccer.
Yesterday's Champions League
semifinal between Barcelona and
Chelsea was a perfect example of
everything soccer can give you.
There were high stakes: the winner
gets to advance to the final of the
most important club tournament in
the world. There were talented
players: Barcelona's Lionel Messi is
the best player in the world and one
of the best to ever play the game,
and his team is basically a world
wide all-star team, while Chelsea is
one of the richest and most talented
clubs in the world as well.
There was an incredible atmos
phere: even soccer haters have to
acknowledge that the passion of fan
bases for top soccer clubs is impres
sive. Heck, even soccer-challenged
America can produce goosebump
inducing moments like the Portland
Timbers fans singing the national
anthem. The Barcelona fans were
so raucous and formidable that
they were seemingly able to get
Turkish referee Ciineyt Cakir to
show a yellow card to Chelsea
whenever they wanted.
Accordingly, there was also con
troversy: Chelsea captain John
Teny was shown a red card when he
kneed Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez
in the back away from the ball.
Cakir did not even see the play and
only gave the red after being alert
ed by his assistant and then seeing a
magnificent flop from Sanchez.This
came when the match was tied 1-1
on aggregate, and, combined with
the Barcelona goal just six minutes

later, appeared to seal the deal in
favor of Barcelona. As the best club
in the world and the reigning cham
pion at home with a man advantage
and the lead, Barcelona had the
game in the bag.
But that's why they play the
game. Chelsea shocked Barcelona
with a quick break right before
halftime, and a perfect through-ball
from Frank Lampard to Ramires
left the latter in open space.
Ramires calmly chipped the ball
over Barcelona keeper Victor
Valdes with incredible skill to give
Chelsea the first away goal of the
semi, which left the visitors clinging
to an aggregate lead at halftime
(the tiebreaker is away goals.)
The second half was one of the
most nerve-racking experiences
I've had in a long time. As a some
what new follower of soccer, I have
been a fan of Chelsea for the past
few years, and my support was even
stronger in this game given
Chelsea's underdog status. I could
hardly breathe for the entire sec
ond half as Barcelona camped
around the 18-yard box, threaten
ing to score virtually every minute.
Hope appeared lost when Messi,
who had never scored against
Chelsea, stepped up for a penalty
kick in the second half The soccer
gods finally gave Chelsea a break,

though, as Messi hit the crossbar,
and later the post, to keep Chelsea
in front.

The capper came in stoppage
time when possibly the most ma
ligned player in the world, Fernan
do Torres, broke past the Barcelona
defense and stepped around Valdes
to score the dagger.
It was truly incredible. Soccer is
not really a game of stats, but being
a stats lover I have to point out the
ridiculous nature of this semifinal.
Over the two legs, Barcelona out
shot Chelsea 46-12 and held pos
session 72 percent of the time.
Chelsea only managed to get four
shots on goal in three hours on the
field, and one of them was a prayer
from Chelsea's own side of the
field. It was enough, though, as the
other three shots on target found
the back of the net, leading the un
derdogs to an improbable 3-2 win
and a trip to the final.
I know soccer isn't for everyone.
Some people cannot get past the dif
ferent pace and the lack of scoring,
and most won't give it a chance. But
if you consider yourself a real sports
fan, give soccer a shot. You might
just find yourself captivated for
good.
