# Win streak extended to four
## 
### SARAH MAISEL STAFF WRITER 
After an up-and-down season
filled with close wins and disap

pointing losses, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team honored
its seniors with a 16-7 rout of
Saint Mary's last Sunday in its
last conference game of the sea

son. The win capped off an excit
ing weekend for the Cardinal,
coming just two days after the
team defeated rival California
when senior Emilie Boeri scored

a game-winning goal in the final
24 seconds of regulation.
The Cardinal (7-9, 5-2 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
clinched the No. 3 seed in the up
coming MPSF Tournament and
will hope to use the momentum
of its four-game winning streak to
secure its eighth straight confer
ence championship. Playing
nothing like the team that was 3-
9 and on the bubble of being shut
out from the tournament just
over a week ago, Stanford seems
to have finally found its rhythm.
The efforts of Boeri, who
earned a hat trick in Friday's win
against Cal (8-7,4-3), and sopho
more goalkeeper Lyndsey
Munoz saved the day for Stan
ford. The Bears rallied to tie the
score four times and outshot the
Cardinal 30-23, but Munoz main
tained her composure, making 11
saves.
Stanford scored early to lead
3-0 within the first five minutes, a
stark contrast to the early deficits
that plagued the team earlier this
season. After senior Catherine
Swanson and Cal sophomore
Amelia Burke scored one apiece,
the Bears fought back with three
unanswered goals to tie the game
4-4. From there, the contest
bounced back and forth, but
Stanford held a one-goal edge at

the break after sophomore Annie
Anton scored.
After the half, sophomore
Anna Kim restarted the scoring
to push the lead to 7-5 within the
first minute, but the advantage
did not last long as Stanford
found itself tied with the Bears
yet again. Flowever, the Cardinal
defense prevented a hungry Cali
fornia team looking to send its
seniors out with a win from taking
over the lead.
With the score held at 8-8 for
over seven minutes after a goal
from Boeri and two from Califor
nia sophomore Paige Gasparino,
it looked as if the match would
head to overtime. Boeri, however,
had other plans. After picking up
a ground ball off a Cal turnover in
the final half minute, she drove

down the field to sink the final
shot and secure the 9-8 win.
After spoiling the Golden
Bears' senior day, Stanford en
sured that there would be no
upset for its own seniors against
Saint Mary's (2-10, 0-5), reward
ing Swanson, Emilie and Anna
Boeri and Maria Fortino with a
game that was clinched well be
fore the final whistle. There was
plenty of scoring to be had, with
Newstrom, freshman Kyle Fraser
and junior Carolyn Bradley each
scoring three goals apiece. Kim
and freshman Flannah Farr
scored twice, and Anna Boeri,
Swanson and freshman Meredith
Kalinowski added one goal
apiece.

In a dominant performance,
Stanford outshot the Gaels 33-17
and scored a whopping 11 goals in
the first half. The team also won
15 of 24 draw controls and com
mitted four fewer turnovers. The
Cardinal is now 25-0 all time
against Saint Mary's.

The fourth consecutive win im
proved the team's conference
record to 5-2 and ensured the
Cardinal a matchup against No. 2
seed Denver. While Stanford fell
in its previous competition
against the Pioneers, the Cardinal
has been playing like a different
team in its recent games. Since its
last loss to Oregon on April 13,
the team has outscored and out
shot opponents 61-44 and 120-96,
respectively. The offense, which
previously struggled to get going
until well into the second half, has
been consistently strong from the
first to the last whistle. As it pre
pares to host the upcoming tour
nament, it seems that the Stan
ford women's lacrosse team is
finding its stride at the right time,
Stanford will host No. 2 seed
Denver in the MPSF Tournament
semifinal at home on Friday, April
27, at 7 p.m.

Kalinowski added one goal

In a dominant performance,
Stanford outshot the Gaels 33-17
and scored a whopping 11 goals in
the first half. The team also won
15 of 24 draw controls and com
mitted four fewer turnovers. The
Cardinal is now 25-0 all time
against Saint Mary's.

The fourth consecutive win im
proved the team's conference
record to 5-2 and ensured the
Cardinal a matchup against No. 2
seed Denver. While Stanford fell
in its previous competition
against the Pioneers, the Cardinal
has been playing like a different
team in its recent games. Since its
last loss to Oregon on April 13,
the team has outscored and out
shot opponents 61-44 and 120-96,
respectively. The offense, which
previously struggled to get going
until well into the second half, has
been consistently strong from the
first to the last whistle. As it pre

ford women's lacrosse team is
finding its stride at the right time,
Stanford will host No. 2 seed
Denver in the MPSF Tournament
semifinal at home on Friday, April

After an up-and-down season
filled with close wins and disap

pointing losses, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team honored
its seniors with a 16-7 rout of
Saint Mary's last Sunday in its
last conference game of the sea

son. The win capped off an excit
ing weekend for the Cardinal,
coming just two days after the
team defeated rival California
when senior Emilie Boeri scored

a game-winning goal in the final
24 seconds of regulation.
The Cardinal (7-9, 5-2 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
clinched the No. 3 seed in the up
coming MPSF Tournament and
will hope to use the momentum
of its four-game winning streak to
secure its eighth straight confer
ence championship. Playing
nothing like the team that was 3-
9 and on the bubble of being shut
out from the tournament just
over a week ago, Stanford seems
to have finally found its rhythm.
The efforts of Boeri, who
earned a hat trick in Friday's win
against Cal (8-7,4-3), and sopho
more goalkeeper Lyndsey
Munoz saved the day for Stan
ford. The Bears rallied to tie the
score four times and outshot the
Cardinal 30-23, but Munoz main
tained her composure, making 11
saves.
Stanford scored early to lead
3-0 within the first five minutes, a
stark contrast to the early deficits
that plagued the team earlier this
season. After senior Catherine
Swanson and Cal sophomore
Amelia Burke scored one apiece,
the Bears fought back with three
unanswered goals to tie the game
4-4. From there, the contest
bounced back and forth, but
Stanford held a one-goal edge at

the break after sophomore Annie
Anton scored.
After the half, sophomore
Anna Kim restarted the scoring
to push the lead to 7-5 within the
first minute, but the advantage
did not last long as Stanford
found itself tied with the Bears
yet again. Flowever, the Cardinal
defense prevented a hungry Cali
fornia team looking to send its
seniors out with a win from taking
over the lead.
With the score held at 8-8 for
over seven minutes after a goal
from Boeri and two from Califor
nia sophomore Paige Gasparino,
it looked as if the match would
head to overtime. Boeri, however,
had other plans. After picking up
a ground ball off a Cal turnover in
the final half minute, she drove

down the field to sink the final
shot and secure the 9-8 win.
After spoiling the Golden
Bears' senior day, Stanford en
sured that there would be no
upset for its own seniors against
Saint Mary's (2-10, 0-5), reward
ing Swanson, Emilie and Anna
Boeri and Maria Fortino with a
game that was clinched well be
fore the final whistle. There was
plenty of scoring to be had, with
Newstrom, freshman Kyle Fraser
and junior Carolyn Bradley each
scoring three goals apiece. Kim
and freshman Flannah Farr
scored twice, and Anna Boeri,

Kalinowski added one goal
apiece.
