After an up-and-down season
filled with close wins and disap

pointing losses, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team honored
its seniors with a 16-7 rout of
Saint Mary's last Sunday in its
last conference game of the sea

son. The win capped off an excit
ing weekend for the Cardinal,
coming just two days after the
team defeated rival California
when senior Emilie Boeri scored

a game-winning goal in the final
24 seconds of regulation.
The Cardinal (7-9, 5-2 Moun

clinched the No. 3 seed in the up
coming MPSF Tournament and
will hope to use the momentum
of its four-game winning streak to
secure its eighth straight confer
ence championship. Playing
nothing like the team that was 3-
9 and on the bubble of being shut
out from the tournament just
over a week ago, Stanford seems
to have finally found its rhythm.
The efforts of Boeri, who
earned a hat trick in Friday's win
against Cal (8-7,4-3), and sopho
more goalkeeper Lyndsey
Munoz saved the day for Stan
ford. The Bears rallied to tie the
score four times and outshot the
Cardinal 30-23, but Munoz main
tained her composure, making 11
saves.
Stanford scored early to lead
3-0 within the first five minutes, a
stark contrast to the early deficits
that plagued the team earlier this
season. After senior Catherine
Swanson and Cal sophomore
Amelia Burke scored one apiece,
the Bears fought back with three
unanswered goals to tie the game
4-4. From there, the contest
bounced back and forth, but
Stanford held a one-goal edge at
