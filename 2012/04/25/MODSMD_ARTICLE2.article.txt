# Rove and Gibbs debate future of politics
## Rob Reich moderates face-off between Republican strategist and former Obama press secretary 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The dueling messages of the
2012 presidential election arrived
in full force Tuesday afternoon in
a packed Memorial Auditorium
as Republican strategist Karl
Rove and Robert Gibbs, former
press secretary for President
Obama, debated which party is
best prepared to lead the United
States through challenges ahead.
"Fundamentally, we have
some huge issues to tackle in this
country," Gibbs said during a mo
ment that broke from the event's
partisan tone. "The only way
we're going to get solutions to re
ally big problems is that we're
going to have to work together,
and we're going to have to com
promise,"
The event, co-hosted by Stan
ford in Government (SIG) and
the ASSU Speaker's Bureau, was
moderated by Political Science
Professor Robert Reich.
In their opening remarks,
Rove and Gibbs largely ad
vanced their party platforms.
Rove focused on the United
States' deteriorating financial sit
uation, arguing that the Obama
administration has been ineffec
tive in confronting issues from
sluggish economic growth to high
unemployment.
"We have an entitlement
problem," Rove said. "We're run
ning out of time, and we've wast
ed the last three years in making
no changes ... that would keep
these great safety nets in place."
By contrast, Gibbs empha
sized issues of economic and so
cial inequality, arguing the elec

tion will hinge upon the "values
this country was founded upon
that hard work and responsi
bility pay off."
When prompted to state the
strongest case that could be made
by the other party's presidential
nominee, both speakers de
murred, stating that the argu

ments being deployed by the
other campaign fail to stand up
against accumulated evidence.
Gibbs cited Republican presi
dential nominee Mitt Romney's
claim to offer superior manage
ment of the economy, and Rove
noted Obama's desire to contin
ue the work of his first term.

"The argument [for Obama]
isn't credible after we've watched
the last three years," Rove said.
"I'm not sure how connected he's
been with that path and how will
ing he is to defend it."
In assessing electoral strate
gies for November, Rove and
Gibbs concurred that the election

will likely be decided by a small
margin, with the race potentially
coming down to a handful of bat
tleground states.
"This election is going to be
even closer [than 2008]," Gibbs
said. "We've been preparing for
this race to be closer than the last
one from the very beginning."
Both speakers emphasized
differences in the electoral map
this election cycle due to demo
graphic shifts and post-census re
distribution of electoral votes.
The pair noted a gain of voters in
strongly conservative states while
others, such as Virginia, have
drifted to the left.
"That doesn't mean that the
past is a guarantee of future per
formance," Rove added, caution
ing against reliance on demo
graphic shifts. "Change is always
there."
The debate became more
heated when Reich asked about
the failure of both parties to
reach out to Hispanic voters, de
spite the growing and increasing
ly critical Latino swing vote.
Rove noted that the failure to
accomplish comprehensive im
migration reform can be assigned
to both parties, but he highlighted
a lack of effort on the subject by
Obama, who promised to under
take serious reform both as a can
didate and as president.
"We're going to need to do
this as a country," Rove said. "The
only way to do it is to get some
one who is in their heart commit
ted to making America a welcom
ing and inclusive country."
"This president had his
