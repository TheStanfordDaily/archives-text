## International admits steady for Class of '16 
### ROSS THORBURN 
Of those admitted to the Stanford Class
of 2016, 8.9 percent are international stu
dents, according to Director of Admissions
Bob Patterson.
While the statistic hovers around the
roughly 9 percent it stood at for last year's
admitted class, the percentage still remains
smaller than that at peer institutions. Inter
national students make up 10 percent of
those accepted to the Class of 2016 at Har
vard University, 9.3 percent at Dartmouth
University and 12.2 percent at Princeton
University.
Stanford defines international appli
cants as those who are neither U.S. citizens
nor U.S. permanent residents. This year,
the largest country of origin for students
outside the U.S. was the United Kingdom,
followed by China, Canada and South
Korea.
Despite the fact that Stanford is cur
rently lagging behind other universities in
the percentage of international students
admitted, Patterson partially attributed
this year's record-breaking number of ap
plications 36,631, a 6.7 percent increase
from the 34,348 students who applied for
the Class of 2015 to a rise in applicants
from other countries.
"We received a record-breaking num
ber of applications this year and are unsure
if the trend will continue or if our numbers
will remain flat," Patterson wrote in an
email to The Daily. "However, given Stan
ford's increased involvement in global out
reach, we may see applicants from parts of
the world that historically have not ap
plied."
At the end of March, the University
opened a research and education center at
China's Peking University. This center,
which will host 10 of Stanford's programs,
is expected to raise the University's public
ity and profile throughout China.
"We do anticipate additional applicants
from China in future years," Patterson
said.
