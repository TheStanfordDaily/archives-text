According to Ferrari Chairman
Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the
Italian car manufacturer has much in
common with Silicon Valley compa
nies, including product exclusivity and
priority of design and details. Still,
Montezemolo told the Stanford com
munity Tuesday that a recent meeting
with Apple CEO Tim Cook had him
thinking about his company in a new
way.
"I learned about two things yes
terday: simplicity and passion for the
work," Montezemolo said of the
meeting.

The Ferrari
chairman made
the comment during
the latest event in the Graduate
School of Business's (GSB) "View
from the Top" speaker series. During
the talk, held in Cemex Auditorium,
Montezemolo gave an overview of his
guiding leadership principles, arguing
that leaders are most successful if they
have passion, vision and demands.
"You must be creative, look ahead,
be the first client of your product,"
Montezemolo said. He added that a
company must be able to integrate a
brand's history with its future trend
setting design.

sponsored by the Graduate School of Business as part of its "View from the
Top" speaker series about the essential role of leadership in business.

tant for the company's founder
Enzo Ferrari in the 19705. Two
decades later, Montezemolo
found himself taking over as Fer
rari's chairman, with the job of re
juvenating the Ferrari corpora
tion's supremacy as both a racing
team and global brand.
According to Montezemolo,
leaders and workers must all be
willing to embrace change and
new opportunities.
"You must give your workers
the best conditions to succeed...
have clear goals, clear priorities
[and] the possibility to grow up,"
Montezemolo said, emphasizing
the need to seek internal growth
within a company.
Montezemolo noted that an in
dustry leader, such as Ferrari in the
automotive world, must both
make confident decisions and take
bold risks in order to stay on top.
Later, he commented that some of
these risks might result in failure,
but even the risk of failure is a risk
worth taking.
Echoing Stanford's enthusiasm
for innovation, he repeatedly em
phasized his belief in "innovation
360 degrees." According to Mon
tezemolo, a company must be will
ing to be innovative with its ap

proach to its every aspect, from its
employees to the international
market. Integrating new technolo
gy is a given, he said, and innova
tion cannot stop with a single inno
vative process or product.
Montezemolo advised the au
dience to be curious, but also wary,
of technology. Technology should
only be granted to those who can
use it, he said.
Regarding the company's past
focus on a male market, Monteze
molo explained that Ferrari has
experienced an increase in female
influence.
Ferrari now offers extensive
personalization for its clients, and
buyers can choose from a selection
of colors and materials. This tailor
ing process, Montezemolo said,
was created primarily for women.
Although women only purchased
approximately 1 percent of all Fer
raris a few years ago, women now
comprise approximately 10 per
cent of Ferrari buyers in the Unit
ed States and 20 percent in Beijing.
Montezemolo also touched on
Ferrari's approach to sustainabili
ty and the environment. He said
Beijing will see Ferrari's first
model with an integrated kinetic
energy recovery system, which will
reduce the vehicle's emissions by
40 percent.
He also spoke about Ferrari's
headquarters in Maranello, which
he said are completely off the grid
and meet all of their energy de

mands through renewable re
sources.
"We have trees inside the facto
ry. Not on the campus inside the
building," Montezemolo said, not
ing several other innovative as
pects of the headquarters, such as
bikes for employees and architec
ture that emphasizes natural light
ing.
Ferrari also plans to develop a
performance hybrid in the next
few years, although it plans to steer
away from the idea of an entirely
electric vehicle, Montezemolo
said. When asked to explain why
he does not see an electric Ferrari
in the cards, Montezemolo
grinned.
"It's a little hard to run 600
horsepower on electricity," he said.
