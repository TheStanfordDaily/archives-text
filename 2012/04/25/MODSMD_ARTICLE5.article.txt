## Privacy concerns for Google eyewear 
### RONEIL RUMBURG 
Professors at Stanford's Human-Computer Inter
action Group said that a recently announced Google
concept, codenamed "Project Glass," could give con
sumers access to a technology previously restricted to
scientists.
Professors Scott Klemmer and Terry Winograd
warned, however, that privacy concerns linger over
the concept, which aims to bring heads-up display
(HUD) technology to the masses via a set of glasses.
These glasses would include a microphone, a small
display over the right eye and a camera that examines
the user's surroundings.
"It's been possible to buy a glasses-mounted
heads-up display for over 20 years, and pioneers at
MlT's Wearable Computing Group ... have worn
heads-up displays every day for a long time," Klem-
mer said.
He added, though, that prior to
Google's concept HUD glasses,
the displays "have been really
clunky" and "needed a computer
and a large battery pack" in order
to function.
For the first time, Google has
created a HUD in a "compelling
and integrated package," Klem
mer said.
The augmented reality eye
wear would give users the ability
to put on a pair of glasses and
have laid out in front of them on a
heads-up display everything from
emails or location-aware maps to
a summary of the tasks they have
scheduled for the day.
Paul Benigeri 'l4 said he is in
terested in using the glasses but

wary of their possible effects on
his ability to synthesize informa
tion. Google pitches the glasses as
giving students the ability to look
up a word they don't understand
when reading in a foreign lan
guage and compose text by talk
ing to the glasses.
"If I have all the information I
could ever want constantly avail
able to me, I would never remem
ber any of it," Benigeri said. "So
although these glasses could give
me any information I need, if I
never learn and internalize any of
it, I may have a hard time thinking
about it or building upon it in the
future."
According to Stanford profes
sors, many privacy implications
go along with widespread use of
Google's glasses, specifically re
lated to the camera and micro
phone built into the glasses.
Winograd wrote in an email to
The Daily of some concerns over
giving people the ability to incon

spicuously record others.
"If it gets used for always-on
video recording, that [could] add
a lot to privacy issues about being
photographed (and even worse,
voice-recorded)," Winograd said.
Winograd also noted that
products such as miniature video
cameras already exist to enable
such activities, and added that the
inclusion of this ability in
Google's product isn't all that
that different from what's already
available.

He added that privacy con
cerns could become "more perva
sive" if standard-used glasses had
recording capabilities.
Google is widely expected to
release the glasses by the end of
the year at a price point between
$250 and $6OO, but the company
has yet to give any official indica
tion.
