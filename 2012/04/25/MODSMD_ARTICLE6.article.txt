## Sophomores benefit from research grants 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Twenty-one students this year received the Chap
pell Lougee Scholarship for summer research, with a
few more awards yet to be finalized, according to
Christina Mesa, an Undergraduate Advising and Re
search (UAR) academic director and the scholar
ship's coordinator. The recipient group currently in
cludes only three male students.
UAR will fund the winners' projects in the human
ities, creative arts and qualitative sciences. The schol
arships are restricted to sophomores and were estab
lished in 1987 to honor History Professor Carolyn
Chappell Lougee's work as dean of undergraduate
studies from 1982 to 1987.
While almost the same number of students applied
for the Chappell Lougee Scholarship this year as last,
there was a record number of students who began and
did not complete the application process this year,
Mesa said in an email to The Daily.
One of the major changes with the application
process was the change of the
deadline from December to Feb
ruary.
"After much discussion, we de
cided to experiment with giving
students more time to prepare the
application, most significantly
over the winter break," Mesa
said. "In addition to the later
deadline, we also gave more stu
dents an opportunity to revise
and resubmit their proposals
some with minimal revisions, and
others with more substantial rec
ommendations for changes."
"We want potential research
projects to get the feedback and
revision they deserve," she added.
Mesa said that these changes
have been an improvement for
the students, who could focus on
fall quarter final exams rather
than worry about completing the
Chappell Lougee application by
December.
"Among the students who
were not awarded scholarships,
many found other opportunities,
did not submit complete applica
tions or decided not to make sub
stantial revisions," Mesa said. She
said that 65 to 70 students that she
met who began applications were
directed to other funding sources
or found internships and other
opportunities.

Mesa noted that Chappell
Lougee applicants, regardless of
their success, are almost twice as
likely to be awarded a student
grant in subsequent years.
"We think this is because the
process of writing a proposal, en
gaging with faculty and reflecting
on the objectives and design of
their project ideas are really valu
able experiences," she said.
Initially, studying the
Olympics in London was a popu
lar subject area among applicants,
but in the end, only one student
will be doing research on the
Olympics. Three student re
searchers will be headed to Paris.
Helen Anderson T4 is one of
them.
"I think it's pretty unbeliev
able that Stanford is funding me
to go to Paris and work on my
novel," Anderson said. "It doesn't
feel like real life. I am incredibly
grateful to have this kind of sup
port for a project that still seems
huge and daunting to me."
"Usually writing is something
I do on the side, something I have
to make time for amid the crazi
ness of everything else," she
added. "Having an entire summer
to devote to my writing is, I think,
going to be invaluable to my de
velopment as a writer."
Katherine Loosley 'l4 is an
other Chappell Lougee recipient
this year. Loosely will be going to
Gansu, China, where she will in
terview elementary school princi
pals who participated in large

scale, randomized controlled tri
als in which they were given mon
etary incentives for successfully
treating anemia at their schools.
"My goal will be to gain an un
derstanding of how the principals
processed and internalized the
monetary incentives that cannot
be captured by quantitative
measures," Loosley said. "By un
derstanding how principals
process, internalize and respond
to incentives, future researchers
will be better equipped to design
cost-effective development pro
grams that potentially achieve
even higher outcomes."
Loosley offered advice to
prospective scholars.
"Start early," she said. "The
best proposals are developed
over time, so give yourself plenty
of time. Also, if you are short for
ideas, talk with professors, and
you are sure to come up with
something."
"This was actually an outcome
we hoped for helping students
develop project ideas and find
ways to realize them often leads
them to other funding sources, if
the projects themselves are not
appropriate for the Chappell
Lougee," Mesa said. "It feels pret
ty great to witness the process of
one of these research or art ideas
as it comes to life, even if it does
not end up being funded by the
Chappell Lougee Scholarship."

"Start early," she said. "The
best proposals are developed
over time, so give yourself plenty
of time. Also, if you are short for
ideas, talk with professors, and
you are sure to come up with
something."
"This was actually an outcome
we hoped for helping students
develop project ideas and find
ways to realize them often leads
them to other funding sources, if
the projects themselves are not
appropriate for the Chappell
Lougee," Mesa said. "It feels pret

one of these research or art ideas
as it comes to life, even if it does
not end up being funded by the
Chappell Lougee Scholarship."

Twenty-one students this year received the Chap
pell Lougee Scholarship for summer research, with a
few more awards yet to be finalized, according to
Christina Mesa, an Undergraduate Advising and Re
search (UAR) academic director and the scholar
ship's coordinator. The recipient group currently in
cludes only three male students.
UAR will fund the winners' projects in the human
ities, creative arts and qualitative sciences. The schol
arships are restricted to sophomores and were estab
lished in 1987 to honor History Professor Carolyn
Chappell Lougee's work as dean of undergraduate
studies from 1982 to 1987.
While almost the same number of students applied
for the Chappell Lougee Scholarship this year as last,
there was a record number of students who began and
did not complete the application process this year,
Mesa said in an email to The Daily.
One of the major changes with the application
process was the change of the
deadline from December to Feb
ruary.
"After much discussion, we de
cided to experiment with giving
students more time to prepare the
application, most significantly
over the winter break," Mesa
said. "In addition to the later
deadline, we also gave more stu
dents an opportunity to revise
and resubmit their proposals
some with minimal revisions, and
others with more substantial rec
ommendations for changes."
"We want potential research
projects to get the feedback and
revision they deserve," she added.
Mesa said that these changes
have been an improvement for
the students, who could focus on
fall quarter final exams rather
than worry about completing the
Chappell Lougee application by
December.
"Among the students who
were not awarded scholarships,
many found other opportunities,
did not submit complete applica
tions or decided not to make sub
stantial revisions," Mesa said. She
said that 65 to 70 students that she
met who began applications were
directed to other funding sources
or found internships and other
opportunities.

Mesa noted that Chappell
Lougee applicants, regardless of
their success, are almost twice as
likely to be awarded a student
grant in subsequent years.
"We think this is because the
process of writing a proposal, en
gaging with faculty and reflecting
on the objectives and design of
their project ideas are really valu
able experiences," she said.
Initially, studying the
Olympics in London was a popu
lar subject area among applicants,
but in the end, only one student
will be doing research on the
Olympics. Three student re
searchers will be headed to Paris.
Helen Anderson T4 is one of
them.
"I think it's pretty unbeliev
able that Stanford is funding me
to go to Paris and work on my
novel," Anderson said. "It doesn't
feel like real life. I am incredibly
grateful to have this kind of sup
port for a project that still seems
huge and daunting to me."
"Usually writing is something
I do on the side, something I have
to make time for amid the crazi
ness of everything else," she
added. "Having an entire summer
to devote to my writing is, I think,
going to be invaluable to my de
velopment as a writer."
Katherine Loosley 'l4 is an
other Chappell Lougee recipient
this year. Loosely will be going to
Gansu, China, where she will in
terview elementary school princi
pals who participated in large

scale, randomized controlled tri
als in which they were given mon
etary incentives for successfully
treating anemia at their schools.
"My goal will be to gain an un
derstanding of how the principals
processed and internalized the
monetary incentives that cannot
be captured by quantitative
measures," Loosley said. "By un
derstanding how principals
process, internalize and respond
to incentives, future researchers
will be better equipped to design
cost-effective development pro
grams that potentially achieve
even higher outcomes."
Loosley offered advice to
