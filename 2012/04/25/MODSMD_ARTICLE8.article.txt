## Senate debates use of leftover funds 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Senators held a marathon, two
and-a-half hour meeting that
largely consisted of debates re
garding the allocation of several
thousand dollars in left-over
funds from various Senate discre
tionary accounts.
With $5,700 remaining in
Flealth and Wellness Committee
Discretionary Funds, $6OO in Tra
ditions Fund, and $ 1130 in Gener
al Discretionary spending, the
senators, who are hoping to have
their last meeting before transi
tion next week, debated how to al
locate the money.

Chair of the Health and Well
ness Committee, Taylor Winfield
'l3 requested $6OOO for three new
initiatives designed to promote
student's happiness and wellbe
ing. Her proposal included the ini

tiation of "undead" or "live" week
preceding quarterly exams, which
may incorporate movie night, star
watching, dance and yoga classes,
massage chairs, and bring-a-pet
to-class day; the development of a
website that merges resources
from all campus institutions ad
dressing different aspects of stu
dent health and wellbeing; and the
establishment of a fall-quarter
course focused on positive wellbe
ing exercises and best practices.
Co-Directors of the Under
graduate Product Design Student
Association also came in request
ing $4500 from the ASSU discre
tionary fund to purchase materi
als for student artists to create
original art for the Frost Revival
Concert on May 19. They argued
that the initiative would not only
promote student art on campus,
but would also establish prece
dent for displaying art at Frost

Amphitheater events.
The senators also considered
the possibility of an ASSU transi
tion retreat, which Rafael Vasquez
guess would cost, at most, $lOOO.
"We don't want to set up the
next Senate for failure," appropri
ations chair Brianna Pang 'l3 said,
warning the senate against spend
ing all of their discretionary ac
counts. The funds are designed to
last through this fiscal year, which
lasts until the end of July.
Laufer also expressed concern
that giving a VSO discretionary
funding might set a dangerous
precendent.
"I'm a little concerned that
we're giving this group prefer
ence," Laufer said, "I do think we
should at least be mindful that
we're allowing a VSO to spend
money out of the discretionary
