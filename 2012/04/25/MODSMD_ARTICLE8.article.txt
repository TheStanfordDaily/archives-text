## Senate debates use of leftover funds 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Senators held a marathon, two
and-a-half hour meeting that
largely consisted of debates re
garding the allocation of several
thousand dollars in left-over
funds from various Senate discre
tionary accounts.
With $5,700 remaining in
Flealth and Wellness Committee
Discretionary Funds, $6OO in Tra
ditions Fund, and $ 1130 in Gener
al Discretionary spending, the
senators, who are hoping to have
their last meeting before transi
tion next week, debated how to al
locate the money.

Chair of the Health and Well
ness Committee, Taylor Winfield
'l3 requested $6OOO for three new
initiatives designed to promote
student's happiness and wellbe
ing. Her proposal included the ini

tiation of "undead" or "live" week
preceding quarterly exams, which
may incorporate movie night, star
watching, dance and yoga classes,
massage chairs, and bring-a-pet
to-class day; the development of a
website that merges resources
from all campus institutions ad
dressing different aspects of stu
dent health and wellbeing; and the
establishment of a fall-quarter
course focused on positive wellbe
ing exercises and best practices.
Co-Directors of the Under
graduate Product Design Student
Association also came in request
ing $4500 from the ASSU discre
tionary fund to purchase materi
als for student artists to create
original art for the Frost Revival
Concert on May 19. They argued
that the initiative would not only
promote student art on campus,
but would also establish prece
dent for displaying art at Frost

Amphitheater events.
The senators also considered
the possibility of an ASSU transi
tion retreat, which Rafael Vasquez
guess would cost, at most, $lOOO.
"We don't want to set up the
next Senate for failure," appropri
ations chair Brianna Pang 'l3 said,
warning the senate against spend
ing all of their discretionary ac
counts. The funds are designed to
last through this fiscal year, which
lasts until the end of July.
Laufer also expressed concern
that giving a VSO discretionary
funding might set a dangerous
precendent.
"I'm a little concerned that
we're giving this group prefer
ence," Laufer said, "I do think we
should at least be mindful that
we're allowing a VSO to spend
money out of the discretionary
when there is a very clear other
system for [receiving funding]."
He argued that the Undergradu
ate Product Design Student Asso
ciation should request all of their
funding from the general fees ac
count, which has about $40,000 in
it for the next six weeks, according
to Pang.
"I understand the principal
thing, but is there really a problem
with just giving them the money?
We have it," Nate Garcia 'l4 said
in response to Laufer's comment,
"This is just a very practical use."
The senate decided to allocate
all of their remaining Health and
Wellness Committee Discre
tionary Funds to Winfield's initia
tives and, on a vote of 11-2, the
$6OO in Traditions Funding to the
Product Design Association.
They also approved the remain
ing $3900 of the VSO's request
from General Fees.
While all of the senators ac
tively participated in discussion
earlier in the night, both Ben
Laufer 'l2 and Chair Rafael

Vasquez 'l2 noted that many of
the senators were absentminded
and disengaged during the discus
sions of the new budget and the
Alternative Review Process revi
sions.
Alon Elhanan 'l4 called the
first action item, a bill proposing
to reestablish "uniforms" for
ASSU senators on the days of
their meetings, "a bad joke." Au
thor Brianna Pang 'l3 withdrew
the bill, which had garnered
ridicule from Elections Commis
sioner Adam Adler 'l2 over email
on Tuesday afternoon.
Co-Director of the Publica
tions Board Kate Abbot 'l2, who
waited for more than an hour be
fore she could give her five
minute report, expressed frustra
tion over the meeting's duration.
"It's already been such a long
meeting that we appreciate effi
ciency in letting you know what
we're doing," Abbot said in re
sponse to a sarcastic comment
from Elhanan, "If you have con
structive and non-sarcastic com
ments on how to improve pub
board and how to work together
in the future, we'd be happy to
hear them."
The senators passed a bill
modifying the non-discrimination

statement in the ASSU Bylaws, an
issue which the senators had de
bated at length in their April 10
meeting. The bill, which Senator
Alon Elhanan 'l4 said "actually
doesn't matter" and Ben Laufer
'l2 called "mainly symbolic,"
added "gender identity, national
origin, religious beliefs (or lack
thereof), socioeconomic status
and/or veteran status" to the non
discrimination clause.
Previous Notice
The senators began discussing
changes made to the budget for
the upcoming Undergraduate
Senate and continued debate
over revisions in the Alternative
Review Process (ARP), which
must be approved after a two
year pilot program aimed at re
ducing barriers to reporting sexu
al assault.
The current budget's proposal
has eliminated the $3OOO pay for
the Senate Chair and the $lOOO
for Deputy Chair (among other
stipends), instead choosing to
grant $4OO stipends for each sen
ator. Vasquez, who authored sev
eral of the changes, had an
nounced earlier in the meeting
that he had decided to allocate
the $5OO remaining in his discre
tionary account as a grant for
Treasurer lan Chan 'l4, whose
work for this year's senate of se
curing reimbursements and sub
sidies, he said, has gone above
and beyond the responsibilities of
a senator.
Although no one from the
Board of Judicial Affairs and only
one representative from the
Graduate Student Council were
present, the debate over the alter
native review process(AÃŸP) for
sexual assault cases continued to
be divisive.
"The law school professor
[Dauber] really misled to the
point where she even actually
might have lied to us about what
she said to us that civil cases do
not need to be determined by
unanimity," Laufer said of the last
week's joint meeting, where
members of the GSC, BJA, and
senate discussed revisions of the
ARP,"l've been at least told...that
civil cases actually do need to be
confirmed by unanimity; sexual
offenses would be considered a
civil offense."
The senate plans to approve
the new budget and conclude the
debate about ARP at their meet
ing next week.

The senators passed a bill
modifying the non-discrimination

statement in the ASSU Bylaws, an
issue which the senators had de
bated at length in their April 10
meeting. The bill, which Senator
Alon Elhanan 'l4 said "actually
doesn't matter" and Ben Laufer
'l2 called "mainly symbolic,"
added "gender identity, national
origin, religious beliefs (or lack
thereof), socioeconomic status
and/or veteran status" to the non
discrimination clause.
Previous Notice
The senators began discussing
changes made to the budget for
the upcoming Undergraduate
Senate and continued debate
over revisions in the Alternative
Review Process (ARP), which
must be approved after a two
year pilot program aimed at re
ducing barriers to reporting sexu
al assault.
The current budget's proposal
has eliminated the $3OOO pay for
the Senate Chair and the $lOOO
for Deputy Chair (among other
stipends), instead choosing to
grant $4OO stipends for each sen
ator. Vasquez, who authored sev
eral of the changes, had an
nounced earlier in the meeting
that he had decided to allocate
the $5OO remaining in his discre
tionary account as a grant for
Treasurer lan Chan 'l4, whose
work for this year's senate of se
curing reimbursements and sub
sidies, he said, has gone above
and beyond the responsibilities of
a senator.
Although no one from the
Board of Judicial Affairs and only
one representative from the
Graduate Student Council were
present, the debate over the alter
native review process(AÃŸP) for
sexual assault cases continued to
be divisive.
"The law school professor
[Dauber] really misled to the
point where she even actually
might have lied to us about what
she said to us that civil cases do
not need to be determined by
unanimity," Laufer said of the last
week's joint meeting, where
members of the GSC, BJA, and
senate discussed revisions of the
ARP,"l've been at least told...that
civil cases actually do need to be
confirmed by unanimity; sexual
offenses would be considered a
civil offense."
The senate plans to approve
the new budget and conclude the
debate about ARP at their meet
ing next week.

Senators held a marathon, two
and-a-half hour meeting that
largely consisted of debates re
garding the allocation of several
thousand dollars in left-over
funds from various Senate discre
tionary accounts.
With $5,700 remaining in
Flealth and Wellness Committee
Discretionary Funds, $6OO in Tra
ditions Fund, and $ 1130 in Gener
al Discretionary spending, the
senators, who are hoping to have
their last meeting before transi
tion next week, debated how to al
locate the money.

Chair of the Health and Well
ness Committee, Taylor Winfield
'l3 requested $6OOO for three new
initiatives designed to promote
student's happiness and wellbe
ing. Her proposal included the ini

tiation of "undead" or "live" week
preceding quarterly exams, which
may incorporate movie night, star
watching, dance and yoga classes,
massage chairs, and bring-a-pet
to-class day; the development of a
website that merges resources
from all campus institutions ad
dressing different aspects of stu
dent health and wellbeing; and the
establishment of a fall-quarter
course focused on positive wellbe
ing exercises and best practices.
Co-Directors of the Under
graduate Product Design Student
Association also came in request
ing $4500 from the ASSU discre
tionary fund to purchase materi
als for student artists to create
original art for the Frost Revival
Concert on May 19. They argued
that the initiative would not only
promote student art on campus,
but would also establish prece
dent for displaying art at Frost

Amphitheater events.
The senators also considered
the possibility of an ASSU transi
tion retreat, which Rafael Vasquez
guess would cost, at most, $lOOO.
"We don't want to set up the
next Senate for failure," appropri
ations chair Brianna Pang 'l3 said,
warning the senate against spend
ing all of their discretionary ac
counts. The funds are designed to
last through this fiscal year, which
lasts until the end of July.
Laufer also expressed concern
that giving a VSO discretionary
funding might set a dangerous
precendent.
"I'm a little concerned that
we're giving this group prefer
ence," Laufer said, "I do think we
should at least be mindful that
we're allowing a VSO to spend
money out of the discretionary
when there is a very clear other
system for [receiving funding]."
He argued that the Undergradu
ate Product Design Student Asso
ciation should request all of their
funding from the general fees ac
count, which has about $40,000 in
it for the next six weeks, according
to Pang.
"I understand the principal
thing, but is there really a problem
with just giving them the money?
We have it," Nate Garcia 'l4 said
in response to Laufer's comment,
"This is just a very practical use."
The senate decided to allocate
all of their remaining Health and
Wellness Committee Discre
tionary Funds to Winfield's initia
tives and, on a vote of 11-2, the
$6OO in Traditions Funding to the
Product Design Association.
They also approved the remain
ing $3900 of the VSO's request
from General Fees.
While all of the senators ac
tively participated in discussion
earlier in the night, both Ben
Laufer 'l2 and Chair Rafael

Vasquez 'l2 noted that many of
the senators were absentminded
and disengaged during the discus
sions of the new budget and the
Alternative Review Process revi
sions.
Alon Elhanan 'l4 called the
first action item, a bill proposing
to reestablish "uniforms" for
ASSU senators on the days of
their meetings, "a bad joke." Au
thor Brianna Pang 'l3 withdrew
the bill, which had garnered
ridicule from Elections Commis
sioner Adam Adler 'l2 over email
on Tuesday afternoon.
Co-Director of the Publica
tions Board Kate Abbot 'l2, who
waited for more than an hour be
fore she could give her five
minute report, expressed frustra
tion over the meeting's duration.
"It's already been such a long
meeting that we appreciate effi
ciency in letting you know what
we're doing," Abbot said in re
sponse to a sarcastic comment
from Elhanan, "If you have con
structive and non-sarcastic com

board and how to work together
in the future, we'd be happy to
