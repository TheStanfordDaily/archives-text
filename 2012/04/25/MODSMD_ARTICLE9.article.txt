From every point in the garden, you
can see it in its entirety. Small
stone steps overlook two quiet
ponds spanned by a little bridge,
framed and sheltered by ever
greens, hedges and tulip trees. It is sparse
and miniature in scope, with enough bench
space for only two people tucked under
neath the greenery. Looking down the
grassy hill from the bench, one can see a
slightly old-fashioned apartment building,
Kingscote Gardens.
Its occupants mostly graduate stu
dents sporadically trickle out of the
building, but for the most part, the whole
area remains hidden from campus life. De
spite its location at the heart of campus, be
tween Tresidder Union and Lomita Drive,
very few people have heard of the place,
and it barely features in literature about
Stanford's history and architecture.
The unassuming building, tall hedges
and concave curve of the garden successful
ly hide Kingscote from the masses of stu
dents pouring out of the nearby campus
hotspots. The dull roar of passing cars is
barely perceptible over the sound of the
fountain.
"Psychologically, people might feel un
comfortable coming here, because it looks
like a very intimate space, something too
private, in which they might feel too vulner
able," said Robert Harrison, professor of
Italian literature.
Harrison himself didn't start paying at
tention to Kingscote until he started writing
his book. "Gardens: An Essay on the
Human Condition." Since then, however,
he has frequented the garden and "adopt
ed," in his own words, this little nook of
Stanford.
"There is a guarded but also inviting ele
ment [to the garden]," Harrison said. Com
menting on a pair of ducks that frequents
the ponds, he noted that the garden "invites
life into it." And despite the garden's sense

of enclosure, in his book Harrison charac
terizes its boundaries as "porous, even
promiscuous."
While no public or University records
are available to identify the garden's de
signer, the origin of the building is clear. In
1915, Sarah Howard, widow of Stanford Po
litical Science Professor Burt Howard, ap
proached University President Ray Lyman
Wilbur with a proposal to develop an apart
ment to house visiting professors. In 1917, a
year after Wilbur approved the proposal,
Kingscote Gardens opened its doors to
guests.
For 80 years, the Howard Holding Com
pany owned and managed the property
until the Howard family lease expired in the
mid-1990s and the property was returned to
the University.
While the gardens have, for the most
part, remained unchanged since their con
struction, their quiet presence served as the
backdrop for significant moments in histo
ry. The students who live at Kingscote today
rent rooms once occupied by visitors from
across the world accomplished profes
sors, high-ranking politicians and famous
novelists.
Charles Beardsley wrote his 1974 novel
"The Apartments" during his stay at
Kingscote Gardens. The novel's fictitious
Kumquat Gardens bear a resemblance to
Kingscote, but Beardsley denied any con
nection.
The once secretive presence of impor
tant figures speaks to the mystique of
Kingscote. Despite its humble appearance,
its list of former guests is surprising and im
pressive.
Romanian diplomat George I. Duca,
who was instrumental in determining Ro
mania's role in World War 11, split his time at
Stanford between the apartments and the
classroom, where he taught history and po
litical science courses. According to a 1987
Daily article ("A place in the sun," April 22,
1987), Duca was the favorite guest of the
manager of Kingscote Gardens at the time.

Bruce Bliven, former editor of The New
Republic, spent his last years living quietly
at Kingscote, after a career that took him on
adventures exposing military prisons and
meeting secretly with underground groups
in Cuba.
"[The garden] seems like a bit of an asy
lum away from politics," Harrison said.
For a figure such as Alexander Keren
sky, the secluded yet inviting nature of the
complex provided a perfect haven from a
tumultuous political career. Kerensky came
to the forefront of the Russian Revolution
when he headed the provisional govern
ment established between the February
and October revolutions of 1917.
"He was a very capable politician and
sensed opportunities better than other
politicians," said Amir Weiner, associate
professor of history.
As a moderate socialist, Kerensky
pushed for many social reforms and made
significant progress in establishing univer
sal suffrage and the abolishment of censor
ship. However, according to Weiner, the
consensus of historians is that from the out
set, the circumstances conflicted with his
centrist and socially progressive views and
set up the failure of his government. This
was why, after leaving Russia, he eventually
found his way to Palo Alto.
"He had to deal with tremendous pres
sure from both left and right," Weiner said.
"The problem was that there was no time or
patience."
After his stance on a number of issues
left him without a power base, Kerensky
fled for his life as the radical Bolsheviks
took power. Kerensky came to Stanford in
1955 to consult the Hoover Archives to
help him write his memoirs. He soon settled
into a room on the upper floor of Kingscote.
While completing his memoirs, he taught
classes based on his political experience.
In many ways, Kerensky's personality
seems incongruous with the unassuming
nature of Kingscote.
"He had a sense of flamboyance which

was good for a time of revolution but also
made him a bit too much of an egomaniac,"
Weiner said.
This personality carried over to his days
at Stanford.
"He was very confident as always, a
'ladies man' who liked good company and
enjoyed a good Russian gathering," Weiner
said.
Nevertheless, the inconspicuous peace
of Kingscote is a fitting conclusion to
Kerensky's volatile life, reflecting his re
treat from the political scene.
"In 1941, Kerensky gave many support
ive speeches for the Russian [war] cause,
but by this time he [was] a nobody," Weiner
said. "His relevance to the political arena
having diminished, he frequented these
quiet gardens in the last years of his life."
Harrison speculated that the gardens
perhaps served a deeper, ideological role
for figures such as Kerensky.
"According to Czech writer Karel
Capek, there is a natural connection be
tween the democratic political form and
gardens," Harrison said.
Gardens, he continued, need to be tend
ed to by people in the same way that citi
zens are caretakers of a democratic state.
Such a garden as Kingscote would have
provided a poetic backdrop to Kerensky's
ideals of achieving social change through
moderate and democratic means. One can
perhaps imagine such a person in this re
cess, contemplating his ideology around the
shaded ponds.
The garden seems to be engineered to
act as a sanctuary for these illustrious fig
ures. The shade and serene environment
serve as perfect contrast to the violent fer
vor of historical change and revolution.
"There is a remoteness created by the
shape of the garden," Harrison said. "It
dampens the excessive presence of what is
beyond its boundaries."
