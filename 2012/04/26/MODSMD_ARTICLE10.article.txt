Erica Castello '12 from the Spoken Word Collective read her poem, "Genius," which describes the experience
of a victim of sexual assault. One line of the poem reads, "Rape is an active word turned passive,"
describing the transition of the mental state of the victim, who initially feels rage against her attacker
and then begins to question the blame of the assault, wondering if she too is culpable.
"That's one of the big steps, is letting a victim define their own experience," said Mona Thompson '13,
publicity coordinator for the Women's Community Center. "Understanding that somebody did something
to you that was wrong."
Castello's performance was part of Take Back the Night, a national and international vigil that takes place
annually in protest of sexual assault and in support of sexual assault victims. Stanford's vigil at the
Women's Community Center on April 25 was organized by the Peer Health Educator (PHE) program.
