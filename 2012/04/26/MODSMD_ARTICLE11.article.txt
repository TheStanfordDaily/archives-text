## SEEING GREEN On shifting sands 
### Molly Moeller 
Every once in a while, I like to
go for a run on the beach.
One of my favorite spots
to hit the sand is San Gregorio
State Beach it lies just across
the Santa Cruz range, is invari
ably quiet early on weekday
mornings and offers a good
stretch of hard-packed sand
along a southern route toward
Pomponio State Beach.
At least, when the tide is out.
When I first started frequent
ing San Gregorio, I never worried
about the position of the moon.
Absent a storm surge, no matter
whether the tide was low or high,
I could comfortably make my way
around all the cliffs and head
lands. But after a few winter
storms, I found this was no longer
true: Fierce waves had reshaped
the coastline, piling up wide
beaches at some points, but leav
ing bare rock in others. Now, if I
don't time my runs right, I'll find
myself knee-deep in ocean back
wash.
Although cross-checking with
tide charts cuts back on my impul
sive beach trips, I've found I really
enjoy the ever-changing coastline.
Unlike every other distance route
I've carved out for myself here in
California, the beach run holds
something new for me every time.
Of course, most of us partic
ularly those who own property
along the coastline prefer a bit
more stability in our lives. After
all, it's one thing to have an extra
sand mound to sprint up, and an
other thing to have your house fall
into the ocean.
That's the worry of thousands
of homeowners along both the
East and West coasts of the Unit
ed States.
California in particular is the
poster child for coastal erosion
drama. The sea cliffs that line the
San Francisco peninsula have
given way before; it's not hard to
find the remnants of foundations
along coastal trails. The bluffs
overlooking the shoreline are
themselves marked by warnings
to stay back from the disintegrat
ing edge.
Elsewhere in the state, home
owners prefer an active response.
One third of Southern Califor
nia's coastline has been backed by
some human barrier, be it a care
fully designed sea wall or a messy
pile of concrete and boulders in
tended to buttress the coastal
landscape.
But planting solid structures in
front of a dynamic sea comes with
consequences. The walls and
boulders may hold their ground,
but deflected water scours away
sand and gravel with an even
fiercer intensity than unobstruct
ed waves. In the end, while the ab
solute line drawn by man may
hold, the sand on the seaward side

will disappear.
Those of us who don't own
clifftop dwellings and occa
sionally enjoy the sandy beaches
below them would probably
prefer to let nature take its
course. Standing back would cer
tainly save us the hundreds of
millions of taxpayer dollars
spent maintaining shorelines.
And in a world arguably over
managed by human desires, it
would be nice to leave something
to Mother Nature,
Unfortunately, it's not just per
sonal property that's on the line.
San Francisco knows this all
too well as it looks west at a
shrinking Ocean Beach. A major
transportation artery and a major
sewage line run a few meters in
shore from the present-day mean
high-tide line. The economic bal
ance sheet gets a lot more compli
cated when you weigh the cost of
relocating infrastructure against
coastal reinforcements.
Add in sea level rise and you
have an urban planner's worst
nightmare.
As humanity adds carbon
dioxide to the atmosphere, we
warm not only the air, but also the
sea. Warmer water expands, and
warmer ice melts. Together, these
effects lead to a rise in sea level.
Conservative models project a
half-meter (roughly twenty inch
es, or the height difference be
tween Shaquille O'Neal and Mug
gsy Bogues) average increase in
sea surface height by the end of
the century. San Francisco is antic
ipating a 14-inch rise by 2050.
A couple of feet may not seem
like much until you consider how
many people are perched along
the world's coastlines. Six hun
dred million people face direct
displacement by flooding; many
more will lose food supplies as
saltwater intrudes into low-lying
soil. Add changing weather pat
terns and amped up storms to the
mix, and whole cities could be in
undated by storm surges.
In San Francisco and
around the country â€”we have
the luxury of combating global
change. Collectively, we can af
ford to build, bulldoze and bludg
eon our shores into a semblance
of stability. But I'm not so sure I'd
like to live in that concrete
fortress. Following the sand inland
is much more my cup of tea.
