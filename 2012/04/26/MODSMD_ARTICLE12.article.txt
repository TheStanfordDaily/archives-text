## Visions of Tomorrow: Academia still a boys' club 
### MIRANDA MAMMEN '14 
Earlier this week, I received a
Facebook invitation to
Stanford 2020: Visions of
Tomorrow. It looked awesome:
"Come see 7 all-star professors
talk about their research, why it
matters, and what the world will
look like in 2020." I scanned the
list of faculty with enthusiasm,
noting how many of the profes
sors I have admired or heard
friends rave about.
But as I reached the end of the
list, my enthusiasm quickly turned
to confusion, then disgust. Of the
seven faculty members who pre
sented at Wednesday night's sym
posium, exactly zero of them were
women.
This level of gender disparity is
unacceptable. And it's particular
ly problematic for an event that
explicitly looks toward the future.
At last year's symposium, there
were two women; this year there
are none. Maybe it's just me, but in
the future I'd like to see more gen
der equality, not less.
The more I thought about it,
the more outrageous the discrep
ancy seemed. On Wednesday, I
posted a sarcastic comment to the
event page: "Visions of Tomor
row: Because in the future, there
will be no female faculty." Adam
Adler 'l2, who is listed as an event
creator on the Facebook page,
commented in response: "Be
cause in the present, female facul
ty do not respond to email re
quests." (He included a winky
smiley face, too.)

It's absurd and shameful that
the nearly twenty groups that co
sponsored the event could not
muster up even a single female
faculty member to speak. I know
from experience that planning ac
ademic events is a tricky business.
The timeline of reaching out to
faculty and hearing back about
their availability can be stressful,
especially if you seek a balanced
diversity of departments, genders,
races and backgrounds.
But that is not an adequate ex
planation for why there are no
women on this panel. When peo
ple agree to organize an event like
this, they are implicitly agreeing to
the difficulties that such a task
necessarily entails. Frankly, it
doesn't matter to me if the event's
organizers had to email fifty fe
male faculty members to secure
three or four for this event. The
planning process is invisible to the
audience. The only thing we see is
the end result, for which the or
ganizers took responsibility. Sim
ply put, I expect more and I'm
not the only one. (It took the staff
of the Women's Community Cen
ter, where I work, just a few hours
to come up with seventeen all-star
female professors who would
have been a great fit for this event.
We can help with brainstorming
next time.)

It's clear that event organizers
gave significant consideration to
securing faculty from diverse dis
ciplines, including political sci
ence, religious studies, mathemat

ics, and medicine. Why isn't gen
der considered an important di
versity concern?
It should be. Our culture's con
sistent failure to position women
as intellectual leaders contributes
to stereotype threat, which im
pedes women's leadership aspira
tions and reinforces stereotypic
beliefs that men are naturally
more fit for the academy than
women.
Women comprise nearly 50
percent of Stanford's undergrad
uate population; nation-wide, that
figure is close to 60 percent. But as
one moves into the upper eche
lons of academia, that parity dis

appears. At Stanford, women are
37 percent of graduate students,
and a truly bleak 26 percent of
faculty members. (So if the event
organizers had passively repre
sented the statistical reality of
gender balance at Stanford not
deliberately provided a more
equal vision, perish the thought
they would have had one or
two women present.)
I would protest the lack of fe
male faculty at an event like this
no matter which university hosted
it, but the absence is even more
appalling because we're not at
just any university. The Stanford
community prides itself on being

a leading institution. We need to
be setting the standard for gender
equity in academia, just as we do
for teaching and research. Our de
partments have their pick of the
top scholars in every field.There's
no excuse for the exclusion of
women from events like this one;
female academics of exceptional
renown are all around us.
My vision of tomorrow in
cludes equal numbers of women
in leadership positions and at de
cision-making tables. There's
nothing forward-thinking about
an old-fashioned boys' club.

Earlier this week, I received a
Facebook invitation to
Stanford 2020: Visions of
Tomorrow. It looked awesome:
"Come see 7 all-star professors
talk about their research, why it
matters, and what the world will
look like in 2020." I scanned the
list of faculty with enthusiasm,
noting how many of the profes
sors I have admired or heard
friends rave about.
But as I reached the end of the
list, my enthusiasm quickly turned
to confusion, then disgust. Of the
seven faculty members who pre
sented at Wednesday night's sym
posium, exactly zero of them were
women.
This level of gender disparity is
unacceptable. And it's particular
ly problematic for an event that
explicitly looks toward the future.
At last year's symposium, there
were two women; this year there
are none. Maybe it's just me, but in
the future I'd like to see more gen
der equality, not less.
The more I thought about it,
the more outrageous the discrep
ancy seemed. On Wednesday, I
posted a sarcastic comment to the
event page: "Visions of Tomor
row: Because in the future, there
will be no female faculty." Adam
Adler 'l2, who is listed as an event
creator on the Facebook page,
commented in response: "Be
cause in the present, female facul
ty do not respond to email re
quests." (He included a winky
smiley face, too.)

It's absurd and shameful that
the nearly twenty groups that co
sponsored the event could not
muster up even a single female
faculty member to speak. I know
from experience that planning ac
ademic events is a tricky business.
The timeline of reaching out to
faculty and hearing back about
their availability can be stressful,
especially if you seek a balanced
diversity of departments, genders,
races and backgrounds.
But that is not an adequate ex
planation for why there are no
women on this panel. When peo
ple agree to organize an event like
this, they are implicitly agreeing to
the difficulties that such a task
necessarily entails. Frankly, it
doesn't matter to me if the event's
organizers had to email fifty fe
male faculty members to secure
three or four for this event. The
planning process is invisible to the
audience. The only thing we see is
the end result, for which the or
ganizers took responsibility. Sim
ply put, I expect more and I'm
not the only one. (It took the staff
of the Women's Community Cen
ter, where I work, just a few hours
to come up with seventeen all-star
female professors who would
have been a great fit for this event.
We can help with brainstorming
next time.)

It's clear that event organizers
gave significant consideration to
securing faculty from diverse dis
ciplines, including political sci
ence, religious studies, mathemat

ics, and medicine. Why isn't gen
der considered an important di
versity concern?
It should be. Our culture's con
sistent failure to position women
as intellectual leaders contributes
to stereotype threat, which im
pedes women's leadership aspira
tions and reinforces stereotypic
beliefs that men are naturally
more fit for the academy than
women.
Women comprise nearly 50
percent of Stanford's undergrad
uate population; nation-wide, that
figure is close to 60 percent. But as
one moves into the upper eche
lons of academia, that parity dis

appears. At Stanford, women are
37 percent of graduate students,
and a truly bleak 26 percent of
faculty members. (So if the event
organizers had passively repre
sented the statistical reality of
gender balance at Stanford not
deliberately provided a more
equal vision, perish the thought
they would have had one or
two women present.)
I would protest the lack of fe
male faculty at an event like this
no matter which university hosted
it, but the absence is even more
appalling because we're not at
just any university. The Stanford
community prides itself on being

a leading institution. We need to
be setting the standard for gender
equity in academia, just as we do
for teaching and research. Our de
partments have their pick of the
top scholars in every field.There's
no excuse for the exclusion of
women from events like this one;
female academics of exceptional
renown are all around us.
My vision of tomorrow in
cludes equal numbers of women
in leadership positions and at de
cision-making tables. There's
nothing forward-thinking about
an old-fashioned boys' club.
