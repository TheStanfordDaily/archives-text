Admit Weekend 2012 starts
today, and that means it's
only a matter of hours be
fore eager ProFros descend upon
campus with their parents in tow.
As much as we current students
like to complain and moan about
Admit Weekend, we all remem
ber how excited we were when it
was our turn to come to campus
for the first time as an admitted
student. We're glad it's your turn,
Class of 2016, so here are a few
tips to make sure you get the most
out of your Admit Weekend expe
rience:
1. Actively seek out the people
and student groups you are inter
ested in.
Chances are you have spent
many years of your life honing
some great skill or talent. Some of
you are fantastic musicians, others
dancers and still others passionate
community service project lead
ers. Others will want to leave their
high school pursuits behind and
pursue new interests in college.
Whatever it is, you're the only one
who knows what you're truly in
terested in, so use Admit Week
end to try to see what your op
tions would be for pursuing your
interests here at Stanford. Hear
ing about the hundreds of clubs
that Stanford has is great, but that
statistic doesn't mean anything if
you don't know which clubs are
relevant to you. Use Friday's ac
tivities fair to actually put yourself
in touch with the people you need
to know. After all, not only are
they the ones that can help get
you involved when you arrive on
the Farm in the fall, but there's
also a good chance that you can

make a friend or two since you're
interested in the same things. And
trust me, speaking as the captain
of a dance team here on campus, I
can tell you that we're as (if not
more) excited as you when you
want to talk to us about joining
our student group, so there's no
need to hesitate before introduc
ing yourself.
2. Befriend your fellow ProFros.
I'm serious do it. That hav
ing been said, be forewarned:
Admit Weekend is awkward.
You're a bunch of high school sen
iors from across the world, stuck
on a college campus together for a
weekend. You all have something
in common after all, you all did
get into Stanford but you don't
have enough time to really get to
know one other. Despite all of the
awkwardness, you would be best
served finding a few ProFros that
you really get along with and ex
changing numbers or adding each
other on Facebook. Here's why:
At some point this summer,
everyone in your life back home
will get really tired of hearing you
talk about Stanford. They don't
know what the difference be
tween Wilbur and Stern is, so
knowing what dorm you got as
signed to doesn't meant much to
them. When this starts to happen
to you, you'll be glad you awk
wardly exchanged numbers with
the girl who sat next to you at the
Dance Expo because you'll have
someone to text who will share
your enthusiasm. And yes, this
does actually happen. I'm still
friends with three of the people I
met at the Dance Expo during
Admit Weekend 2010.

3. Get Stanford swag!
Stanford is not one of those
campuses where people act like
they're too cool to wear anything
that says their school's name on it;
we're the total opposite. I know
people who would plaster them
selves in Stanford bumper stickers
if they could. If you know you're
coming here, then grab some Car
dinal and wear it with pride. We're
excited to have you, so welcome to
the Stanford family!
4. Don't be afraid if Stanford
doesn't seem like the place for you.
Everyone is going to spend all
weekend telling you that Stanford
is paradise, and it's absolutely
okay to disagree with that state
ment. I (obviously) love Stanford,
and coming to Admit Weekend
showed me that it was the place
for me. Still, there's a chance that
you may not feel that way after
heading home on Sunday. Don't
feel pressured to like Stanford just
because it's Stanford. Of course,
we'd be thrilled to have you (that's
why you got in), but if you feel like
you can't see yourself calling this
place home for the next four years,
it's okay. I'm sure you have tons of
other amazing options and oppor
tunities available to you, and I
wish you the best of luck wherever
it is you do end up!
Now excuse me while I go join
in on setting up for this weekend's
festivities. Let Admit Weekend
2012 begin!

Speaking of shameless recruiting,
Ravali would love to meet any

fusion dance! Feel free to email her
