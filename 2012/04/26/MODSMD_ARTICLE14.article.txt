## STANFORD FOOTBALL PRIME PROSPECTS 
### 
The NFL draft begins today at 5 p.m. and will continue through Sunday.
The Daily breaks down the prospects for Stanford's top graduating players hoping to have their names called this weekend.

Andrew Luck
Projected Round - Ist
Scout's take

"Is one of the safest, surefire QB selections in draft history with few discernible
blemishes and has slam-dunk potential in a rhythm offense."
(Pro Football Weekly)

The skinny
The Colts have already announced they'll take Luck with the first overall pick, solidifying
what we've known for over two years now - Luck is the best college quarterback prospect to
enter the draft since Peyton Manning, the man he'll be replacing in Indy.

David DeCastro
Projected Round-Ist
Scout's take
"Big, physical, nasty, strong technician with distinction as the best pulling guard in
this year's draft class. Is a proven, perennial Pro Bowl-caliber plug-and-play starter
with no glaring deficiencies in his game."
(Pro Football Weekly)

The skinny
Just about everybody sees DeCastro as the second-best offensive lineman in this year's draft
class behind USC's Matt Kalil. Won't slip past the 20th pick, and is likely to be taken
by the Chiefs (11 th pick), Cardinals (13th) or Cowboys (14th).

Jonathan Martin
Projected Round-Ist
Scout's take
"He's got the NFL size, length and overall athletic skill set. However, he's not a natural
anchor player and doesn't strike me as a guy who is ever going to be real physical at the
next level. Looks like a finesse tackle who will get over-drafted because of athletic talent."
(National Football Post)

The skinny
Martin didn't play exceptionally well this year and had a miserable pro day a few weeks ago,
so his stock has fallen from the beginning of the year, when he was expected to be a top-10
pick. However, he's still a late-first-round talent, and might end up with the Browns (22nd
pick), Texans (26th) or Giants (32nd).

Coby Fleener
Projected Round-Ist
Scout's take
"An impressive pass catcher who can win both down the field and underneath versus man
coverage. Has the frame and flexibility to develop into a solid blocker as well and looks
like a future starting-caliber NFL tight end."
(National Football Post)

The skinny
Fleener's stock has gone through the roof lately, with a fantastic pro day and the perform
ance of big tight ends like Rob Gronkowski and Vernon Davis boosting his value. Fleener
likely won't slip past the 49ers (30th pick), but start looking for his name to pop up when
the Steelers, Broncos and Texans hit the board.

Delano Howell
Projected Round - 7th or Free agent
Scout's take
"Reads and reacts quickly, gets early jumps on the football and puts himself around the
the receiver, but always has to play man instead of ball because of lacking range. Isn't
afraid to throw his body around. However is too stiff to play in space at the next level
and make plays on the football." (National Football Post)

The skinny
Howell has had a few injury issues and isn't that big, thus hampering his value, but his big
hit ability, secure tackling and decent coverage skills mean he'll be a backup safety and
special teams starter in the NFL.

Michael Thomas
Projected Round - Undrafted free agent
Scout's take
"Thomas has been reliable the past two seasons at Stanford yet lacks the measurables
to be anything other than a backup in the NFL. He offers potential in a zone system at
cornerback or safety ond comes with a special teams mentality."
(Sports Illustrated)

The skinny
Thomas doesn't really have a position at the next level (some have even theorized that
he'll play cornerback, despite his struggles to cover anyone in man-to-man) but he's
still been turning the eyes of people with his consistent play and minimal injury history. Has
worked out for the 49ers, Patriots, Texans and Chiefs.

Matt Masifilo
Projected Round - 6th-7th
Scout's take
"Has a terrific makeup that translates to consistent on-field effort. Low-voltage athletic
ability restricts his ceiiing, however. Size, smarts and toughness might fit best with a
team employing a hybrid scheme in which he could provide depth at multiple spots."
(Pro Football Weekly)

The skinny
Masifilo wasn't much of a factor on many teams' draft boards, but his solid pro day
showing, where he bench-pressed 225 pounds a colossal 38 times, showed he has the
strength to at least compete for a spot along the trenches in the NFL.

Chris Owusu
Projected Round - 6th-7th
Scout's take
"Well-built, athletic, competitive, mentally tough secondary receiver and kickoff returner
who flashes playmaking ability when healthy but has been physically battered. Long
term durability could affect draft standing and potentially cut short pro career."
(Pro Football Weekly)

The skinny
Owusu's troubles with concussions are well-documented, and that unfortunately hampers
his value; some teams have even taken him off their draft boards because of his health
issues. His ability to play special teams will boost his status and ultimately be the differ
ence-maker that induces one team to take him.

Johnson Bademosi
Projected Round - 7th or Free agent
Scout's take
"Perhaps the most intriguing prospect at Stanford's Pro Day, clocked at a startling 4.35
on his first 40 attempt and also demonstrated incredible explosiveness in the vertical and
broad jump. Graded by some clubs as a corner and others as a developmental free safety
prospect, Bademosi may have earned a draft selection at Pro Day." (NFLDraftScout.com)

The skinny
Bademosi, who projects as a safety at the next level, had a startlingly good pro day that put
him on several teams' radars. He worked out for the 49ers recently, and apparently has
received some interest from the Patriots and Chiefs.

Jeremy Stewart
Projected Round - Undrafted free agent
Scout's take
"Slashing runner with one-cut style. Average speed. Above-average power. Effective in
short yardage. Also makes good special teams decisions. Good hands. Long injury
history and not used often due to injuries in 2009 and 2010."
(Dynasty Draftnik)

The skinny
While Stewart is a short-yardage stud, he was so infrequently used at running back over the
last few years that it's hard to see him sticking on an NFL roster as just a running back. That
means his best bet at the next level is to make the practice squad or play special teams.

Griff Whalen
Projected round - Undrafted free agent
Scout's take
"Shows terrific quickness in and out of his breaks. Consistent route-running was mentioned
by more than one scout attending his Pro Day workout as similar to the sharp cutting ability
that helped 2011 undrafted free agent Doug Baldwin emerge as the Seahawks 1 leading
receiver as a rookie." (NFLdraftscout.com)

The skinny
Whalen has put some nice things on film, but his measurables are all going to leave him
lacking when he's in a draft with guys like Justin Blackmon and Michael Floyd. But remember,
the player he compares most favorably to - Wes Welker - was undrafted, too.

(Sports Illustrated)

The skinny
Thomas doesn't really have a position at the next level (some have even theorized that
he'll play cornerback, despite his struggles to cover anyone in man-to-man) but he's
still been turning the eyes of people with his consistent play and minimal injury history. Has
worked out for the 49ers, Patriots, Texans and Chiefs.

Matt Masifilo
Projected Round - 6th-7th
Scout's take
"Has a terrific makeup that translates to consistent on-field effort. Low-voltage athletic
ability restricts his ceiiing, however. Size, smarts and toughness might fit best with a
team employing a hybrid scheme in which he could provide depth at multiple spots."
(Pro Football Weekly)

The skinny
Masifilo wasn't much of a factor on many teams' draft boards, but his solid pro day
showing, where he bench-pressed 225 pounds a colossal 38 times, showed he has the
strength to at least compete for a spot along the trenches in the NFL.

Chris Owusu
Projected Round - 6th-7th
Scout's take
"Well-built, athletic, competitive, mentally tough secondary receiver and kickoff returner
who flashes playmaking ability when healthy but has been physically battered. Long
term durability could affect draft standing and potentially cut short pro career."
(Pro Football Weekly)

The skinny
Owusu's troubles with concussions are well-documented, and that unfortunately hampers
his value; some teams have even taken him off their draft boards because of his health
issues. His ability to play special teams will boost his status and ultimately be the differ
ence-maker that induces one team to take him.

Johnson Bademosi
Projected Round - 7th or Free agent
Scout's take
"Perhaps the most intriguing prospect at Stanford's Pro Day, clocked at a startling 4.35
on his first 40 attempt and also demonstrated incredible explosiveness in the vertical and
broad jump. Graded by some clubs as a corner and others as a developmental free safety
prospect, Bademosi may have earned a draft selection at Pro Day." (NFLDraftScout.com)

The skinny
Bademosi, who projects as a safety at the next level, had a startlingly good pro day that put
him on several teams' radars. He worked out for the 49ers recently, and apparently has
received some interest from the Patriots and Chiefs.

Jeremy Stewart
Projected Round - Undrafted free agent
Scout's take
"Slashing runner with one-cut style. Average speed. Above-average power. Effective in
short yardage. Also makes good special teams decisions. Good hands. Long injury
history and not used often due to injuries in 2009 and 2010."
(Dynasty Draftnik)

The skinny
While Stewart is a short-yardage stud, he was so infrequently used at running back over the
last few years that it's hard to see him sticking on an NFL roster as just a running back. That
means his best bet at the next level is to make the practice squad or play special teams.

Griff Whalen
Projected round - Undrafted free agent
Scout's take
"Shows terrific quickness in and out of his breaks. Consistent route-running was mentioned
by more than one scout attending his Pro Day workout as similar to the sharp cutting ability
that helped 2011 undrafted free agent Doug Baldwin emerge as the Seahawks 1 leading
receiver as a rookie." (NFLdraftscout.com)

The skinny
Whalen has put some nice things on film, but his measurables are all going to leave him
lacking when he's in a draft with guys like Justin Blackmon and Michael Floyd. But remember,
the player he compares most favorably to - Wes Welker - was undrafted, too.

The NFL draft begins today at 5 p.m. and will continue through Sunday.
The Daily breaks down the prospects for Stanford's top graduating players hoping to have their names called this weekend.

Andrew Luck
Projected Round - Ist
Scout's take

"Is one of the safest, surefire QB selections in draft history with few discernible
blemishes and has slam-dunk potential in a rhythm offense."
(Pro Football Weekly)

The skinny
The Colts have already announced they'll take Luck with the first overall pick, solidifying
what we've known for over two years now - Luck is the best college quarterback prospect to
enter the draft since Peyton Manning, the man he'll be replacing in Indy.

David DeCastro
Projected Round-Ist
Scout's take
"Big, physical, nasty, strong technician with distinction as the best pulling guard in
this year's draft class. Is a proven, perennial Pro Bowl-caliber plug-and-play starter
with no glaring deficiencies in his game."
(Pro Football Weekly)

The skinny
Just about everybody sees DeCastro as the second-best offensive lineman in this year's draft
class behind USC's Matt Kalil. Won't slip past the 20th pick, and is likely to be taken
by the Chiefs (11 th pick), Cardinals (13th) or Cowboys (14th).

Jonathan Martin
Projected Round-Ist
Scout's take
"He's got the NFL size, length and overall athletic skill set. However, he's not a natural
anchor player and doesn't strike me as a guy who is ever going to be real physical at the
next level. Looks like a finesse tackle who will get over-drafted because of athletic talent."
(National Football Post)

The skinny
Martin didn't play exceptionally well this year and had a miserable pro day a few weeks ago,
so his stock has fallen from the beginning of the year, when he was expected to be a top-10
pick. However, he's still a late-first-round talent, and might end up with the Browns (22nd
pick), Texans (26th) or Giants (32nd).

Coby Fleener
Projected Round-Ist
Scout's take
"An impressive pass catcher who can win both down the field and underneath versus man
coverage. Has the frame and flexibility to develop into a solid blocker as well and looks
like a future starting-caliber NFL tight end."
(National Football Post)

The skinny
Fleener's stock has gone through the roof lately, with a fantastic pro day and the perform
ance of big tight ends like Rob Gronkowski and Vernon Davis boosting his value. Fleener
likely won't slip past the 49ers (30th pick), but start looking for his name to pop up when
the Steelers, Broncos and Texans hit the board.

Delano Howell
Projected Round - 7th or Free agent
Scout's take
"Reads and reacts quickly, gets early jumps on the football and puts himself around the
the receiver, but always has to play man instead of ball because of lacking range. Isn't
afraid to throw his body around. However is too stiff to play in space at the next level
and make plays on the football." (National Football Post)

The skinny
Howell has had a few injury issues and isn't that big, thus hampering his value, but his big
hit ability, secure tackling and decent coverage skills mean he'll be a backup safety and
special teams starter in the NFL.

Michael Thomas
Projected Round - Undrafted free agent
Scout's take
"Thomas has been reliable the past two seasons at Stanford yet lacks the measurables
to be anything other than a backup in the NFL. He offers potential in a zone system at
cornerback or safety ond comes with a special teams mentality."
(Sports Illustrated)

The skinny
Thomas doesn't really have a position at the next level (some have even theorized that
