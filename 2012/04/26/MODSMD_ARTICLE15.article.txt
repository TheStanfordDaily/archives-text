# I'm sick of RG3 draft talk
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
Tonight, 32 players will
walk across the stage at
Radio City Music Hall,
jam awful-looking hats on
their heads and finally
begin their NFL careers in earnest
after months of waiting and prepar
ing. More importantly, it means that
the preposterous cycle of media
coverage that leads up to the NFL
draft will end, and Mel Kiper, Jr.,
Todd McShay and their cronies can
all retreat to the respective bridges
they live under.
More importantly, the first
round of the draft will finally signal
the end of the months-long "de
bate" of whether the Colts should
pick Andrew Luck or Robert Grif
fin 111 with the first overall pick. I
can't fully express how excited I am
about the end of this debate, be
cause, quite frankly, I am sick of see
ing and hearing about Robert Grif
fin 111. It's not because I'm worried
that the Colts will flip-flop and pick
Griffin first or because I'm jealous
that Griffin ended up with the Heis
man this year, but it's because I
think Griffin's rise to become the
new poster child of the NFL repre
sents everything that's wrong with
the NFL draft.
First of all, let's get this out of the
way: Griffin is nowhere near as good
as Luck, and yet, many draft experts
spin us the story that Griffin would
be a better pick. Why? Because
Griffin is a far more exciting player
to watch play football. Sever
al times a game, he makes one of
those "oh-shit-how-did-he-do-that"
plays that ends up in the Sports Ce
nter Top 10. Meanwhile, Luck's high
light tape is full of short, on-target
passes flecked with the occasional
long run and a single one-handed
catch against UCLA. Luck's bril
liance is understated, and only
comes through after repeated view
ing, while Griffin's video-game
good plays make you jump out of
your seat. You don't need to see a
Powerpoint presentation to see why
Griffin is a great college football
player.
And because Griffin is so excit
ing to watch, draft experts have con
veniently obscured the fact that he
ran a (somewhat gimmicky) spread
offense at Baylor, never had to take
snaps from under center (a neces
sary skill in the NFL) and got all his
plays from the sideline and never
was required to make passes that re
quired complex reads of a defense.
While Griffin was an accurate pass
er, a fast runner and an all-around
delight to watch play football, things
that should be major question
marks (or at least big developmen
tal steps in Griffin's NFL career)
have basically been overlooked.
What's more, Griffin has only re
ally had one outstanding season,
and went from a guy that was above
average, but essentially unheard-of
outside the Big 12 to a "surefire
NFL star" in just one year. For a lot
of prospects, a one-year breakout
makes scouts wonder where all that
performance was beforehand, but
apparently nobody has questioned
that about Griffin's game.
Second, Griffin irks me because
he's inescapable. He's a total media
darling, or as Sports Illustrated
writer Peter King says, he's the ben
eficiary of "the circle-jerking of a jil
