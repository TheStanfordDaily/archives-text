# I'm sick of RG3 draft talk
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
Tonight, 32 players will
walk across the stage at
Radio City Music Hall,
jam awful-looking hats on
their heads and finally
begin their NFL careers in earnest
after months of waiting and prepar
ing. More importantly, it means that
the preposterous cycle of media
coverage that leads up to the NFL
draft will end, and Mel Kiper, Jr.,
Todd McShay and their cronies can
all retreat to the respective bridges
they live under.
More importantly, the first
round of the draft will finally signal
the end of the months-long "de
bate" of whether the Colts should
pick Andrew Luck or Robert Grif
fin 111 with the first overall pick. I
can't fully express how excited I am
about the end of this debate, be
cause, quite frankly, I am sick of see
ing and hearing about Robert Grif
fin 111. It's not because I'm worried
that the Colts will flip-flop and pick
Griffin first or because I'm jealous
that Griffin ended up with the Heis
man this year, but it's because I
think Griffin's rise to become the
new poster child of the NFL repre
sents everything that's wrong with
the NFL draft.
First of all, let's get this out of the
way: Griffin is nowhere near as good
as Luck, and yet, many draft experts
spin us the story that Griffin would
be a better pick. Why? Because
Griffin is a far more exciting player
to watch play football. Sever
al times a game, he makes one of
those "oh-shit-how-did-he-do-that"
plays that ends up in the Sports Ce
nter Top 10. Meanwhile, Luck's high
light tape is full of short, on-target
passes flecked with the occasional
long run and a single one-handed
catch against UCLA. Luck's bril
liance is understated, and only
comes through after repeated view
ing, while Griffin's video-game
good plays make you jump out of
your seat. You don't need to see a
Powerpoint presentation to see why
Griffin is a great college football
player.
And because Griffin is so excit
ing to watch, draft experts have con
veniently obscured the fact that he
ran a (somewhat gimmicky) spread
offense at Baylor, never had to take
snaps from under center (a neces
sary skill in the NFL) and got all his
plays from the sideline and never
was required to make passes that re
quired complex reads of a defense.
While Griffin was an accurate pass
er, a fast runner and an all-around
delight to watch play football, things
that should be major question
marks (or at least big developmen
tal steps in Griffin's NFL career)
have basically been overlooked.
What's more, Griffin has only re
ally had one outstanding season,
and went from a guy that was above
average, but essentially unheard-of
outside the Big 12 to a "surefire
NFL star" in just one year. For a lot
of prospects, a one-year breakout
makes scouts wonder where all that
performance was beforehand, but
apparently nobody has questioned
that about Griffin's game.
Second, Griffin irks me because
he's inescapable. He's a total media
darling, or as Sports Illustrated
writer Peter King says, he's the ben
eficiary of "the circle-jerking of a jil
lion of us covering the draft for far,
far too long." Griffin's catchy nick
name, engaging personality and in
ability to say "no" to a photo shoot
or video interview means he's been
showing up everywhere, all the

time. In contrast to Luck, who es
chews the spotlight at almost every
opportunity, RG3 is on the cover of
every magazine's NFL draft issue
this week, rocking his ridiculous
socks and absurd arm sleeve. And
because he's so beloved by the
media, it means he's the spotlight of
the worst part of NFL draft cover
age: specious criticism. Every year,
the media trumps up insane criti
cisms, like a scout's recent observa
tion that Griffin is "selfish." Why
does this bother me? Because after
I hear Kiper and McShay talk
about Griffin being "selfish" for 10
straight hours on Sports Center, I
feel like drinking a big bottle of
cyanide. Perhaps I just need to stop
watching ESPN's draft coverage,
but unfortunately, their influence in
setting the agenda in sports is so
great that it's unavoidable as well.
But all of that's coming to an
end tonight, when Luck will stride
across the stage first, shake Roger
Goodell's hand, and awkwardly
pose for thousands of pictures.
And, for the first time in months,
Luck can bask in that sublime mo
ment on his own, while Griffin, the
guy on every magazine cover, has to
wait his turn.

cyanide to drinking the RG3 Kool-
Aid. Compare the relative tastes of

can't fully express how excited I am
about the end of this debate, be
cause, quite frankly, I am sick of see
ing and hearing about Robert Grif
fin 111. It's not because I'm worried
that the Colts will flip-flop and pick
Griffin first or because I'm jealous
that Griffin ended up with the Heis
man this year, but it's because I
think Griffin's rise to become the
new poster child of the NFL repre
sents everything that's wrong with
the NFL draft.
First of all, let's get this out of the
way: Griffin is nowhere near as good
as Luck, and yet, many draft experts
spin us the story that Griffin would
be a better pick. Why? Because
Griffin is a far more exciting player
to watch play football. Sever
al times a game, he makes one of
those "oh-shit-how-did-he-do-that"
plays that ends up in the Sports Ce
nter Top 10. Meanwhile, Luck's high
light tape is full of short, on-target
passes flecked with the occasional
long run and a single one-handed
catch against UCLA. Luck's bril
liance is understated, and only
comes through after repeated view
ing, while Griffin's video-game
good plays make you jump out of
your seat. You don't need to see a
Powerpoint presentation to see why
Griffin is a great college football
player.
And because Griffin is so excit
ing to watch, draft experts have con
veniently obscured the fact that he
ran a (somewhat gimmicky) spread
offense at Baylor, never had to take
snaps from under center (a neces
sary skill in the NFL) and got all his
plays from the sideline and never
was required to make passes that re
quired complex reads of a defense.
While Griffin was an accurate pass
er, a fast runner and an all-around
delight to watch play football, things
that should be major question
marks (or at least big developmen
tal steps in Griffin's NFL career)
have basically been overlooked.
What's more, Griffin has only re
ally had one outstanding season,
and went from a guy that was above
average, but essentially unheard-of
outside the Big 12 to a "surefire
NFL star" in just one year. For a lot
of prospects, a one-year breakout
makes scouts wonder where all that
performance was beforehand, but
apparently nobody has questioned
that about Griffin's game.
Second, Griffin irks me because
he's inescapable. He's a total media
darling, or as Sports Illustrated
writer Peter King says, he's the ben
eficiary of "the circle-jerking of a jil
lion of us covering the draft for far,
far too long." Griffin's catchy nick
name, engaging personality and in
ability to say "no" to a photo shoot
or video interview means he's been
showing up everywhere, all the

time. In contrast to Luck, who es
chews the spotlight at almost every
opportunity, RG3 is on the cover of
every magazine's NFL draft issue
this week, rocking his ridiculous
socks and absurd arm sleeve. And
because he's so beloved by the
media, it means he's the spotlight of
the worst part of NFL draft cover
age: specious criticism. Every year,
the media trumps up insane criti
cisms, like a scout's recent observa
tion that Griffin is "selfish." Why
does this bother me? Because after
I hear Kiper and McShay talk
about Griffin being "selfish" for 10
straight hours on Sports Center, I
feel like drinking a big bottle of
cyanide. Perhaps I just need to stop
watching ESPN's draft coverage,
but unfortunately, their influence in
setting the agenda in sports is so
great that it's unavoidable as well.
But all of that's coming to an
end tonight, when Luck will stride
across the stage first, shake Roger
Goodell's hand, and awkwardly
pose for thousands of pictures.
And, for the first time in months,
Luck can bask in that sublime mo
ment on his own, while Griffin, the
guy on every magazine cover, has to
wait his turn.

cyanide to drinking the RG3 Kool-
Aid. Compare the relative tastes of

I am sick
of seeing and
hearing
about Robert
Griffin 111.
Tonight, 32 players will
walk across the stage at
Radio City Music Hall,
jam awful-looking hats on
their heads and finally
begin their NFL careers in earnest
after months of waiting and prepar
ing. More importantly, it means that
the preposterous cycle of media
coverage that leads up to the NFL
draft will end, and Mel Kiper, Jr.,
Todd McShay and their cronies can
all retreat to the respective bridges
they live under.
More importantly, the first
round of the draft will finally signal
the end of the months-long "de
bate" of whether the Colts should
pick Andrew Luck or Robert Grif
fin 111 with the first overall pick. I
can't fully express how excited I am
