# CRUCIAL CLASH
## STANFORD TAKES ON BYU IN MPSF SEMIFINAL 
### DANIEL E.LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
The second-seeded Stanford
men's volleyball team is in Los An
geles tonight for the semifinals of
the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration (MPSF) tournament,
needing two more wins to garner
an automatic bid to the NCAA
tournament. The Cardinal (21-6,
17-5 MPSF) will take on the third
seeded BYU Cougars (24-6,17-5)
for the third time this season for a
chance at the finals in what prom
ises to be one of the more exciting
matches of the season.

The eventual champion of the
MPSF tournament will have
earned it, considering that the re
maining teams in the tournament
comprise the top four teams in the

country USC, UC-Irvine, Stan
ford and BYU are Nos. 1,2,3 and 4,
respectively, in the latest national
rankings. The good news for Cardi
nal fans, and fans of the MPSF in
general, is that the at-large bid to
the four-team NCAA tournament
will almost definitely come from
the MPSF.
The flipside of that, however, is
not so inviting: Stanford will have
to beat two of the four best teams
in the country to assure itself a
place in the NCAA tournament.
The Cardinal sports an overall
record of 3-3 against the rest of the
remaining field, defeating BYU
twice during a season-changing
weekend in Provo earlier this year
along with a split against Irvine and
a 0-2 mark against USC.
That being said, the story of the

match between Stanford and BYU
promises to be much different this
time around. When these two
teams last met on consecutive
nights in early February, BYU was
at a significant disadvantage de
spite playing on its home floor
the Cougars were without first
team All-MPSF outside hitter Tay
lor Sander, who leads the MPSF
and is second in the nation with
4.80 kills per set. Stanford was able
to exploit this weakness in the
Cougars' attack, holding BYU to a
.272 hitting percentage for the
weekend.
Stanford's calling cards all sea
son long have been defense and su
perior passing. The return of
Sander to the lineup significantly
increases the challenge for the
Cardinal, which will be forced to

contend with a BYU team that al
ready features five other All-
MPSF performers middle
blockers Futi Tavana and Russell
Lavaja, opposite Robb Stowell,
setter Joe Kauliakamoa and out
side hitter Josue Rivera. BYU's
hitting percentage as a team for the
season is third-best in the country
at .326. Whether or not Stanford
can consistently stymie the now
healthy BYU attack will be the key
to the match.
"If we can serve tough and limit
our errors, and consistently put up
good balls for Evan Barry to set,
then I think we should have a lot of
success," said sophomore outside
hitter Steven Irvin.
Despite all the matchup prob
lems Stanford will have to contend
with, BYU's task to stop its oppo
nent will be no easier. In fact, Stan
ford is one of just three teams,
along with BYU and USC, that
features six all-conference selec
tions, led as always by first-team
performers and Stanford record
holders Brad Lawson and Erik
Shoji. In addition to Lawson and
Shoji, senior setter Evan Bany and
sophomores Brian Cook, Eric
Mochalski and Irvin were All-
MPSF selections.
"[Today's match] is going to
come down to serving, passing and
smart attacking," Lawson said.
"BYU is a notoriously great block
ing team and they also have some
potent weapons from the service
line. If we can control their serves
and pass well, we'll be able to keep
their big block guessing, which will
make it a lot easier for us to side
out and score points."
From a statistical standpoint,
Stanford's offense has been even
more efficient than BYU's
Stanford sits second in the country
with a team hitting percentage of
.343 for the season, with four of the
Cardinal's top five hitters sporting
hitting percentages above .320. If
the Cougars want to come away
with better results than the last
time they matched up with the
Cardinal, they will have to come
prepared to face an efficient and
diverse offense.
A win for the Cardinal in Thurs
day's semifinal would probably
guarantee the Cardinal a bid to the
NCAA tournament if top-ranked
USC defeats Irvine, because Stan

Seniors Gus Ellis (left) and Evan Barry (right) will look to close out their Stanford men's volleyball careers with
a second trip to te NCAA tournament. To get there, the second-seeded Cardinal will need to beat third-seeded
BYU in tonight's MPSF semifinal in Loa Angles and then possibly knock off either USC or UC-Irvine.
ford would then, at worst, have fin
ished second in the conference and
second in the conference tourna
ment. But to say Saturday's final is
not important would be a complete
misjudgment. Stanford has not had
much success against the Trojans

this season, and an improved result
could do wonders for the team's
confidence heading into a possible
NCAA tournament showdown.
A win by Irvine on Thursday,
however, would turn the landscape
upside down. The winner of the
final would obviously advance to
the tournament, but a loss by Irvine
in the final would complicate things
severely. Winning in the semifinals
would mean that the Anteaters
would hold a 2-1 series advantage

over the Trojans this season, some
thing the NCAA tournament com
mittee would certainly have to take
into account.
In order to be in the mix, though,
the Cardinal must first take care of
business against BYU. Stanford's
road to the tournament resumes
today at 5 p.m. at the Galen Center
in Los Angeles.
