## Senator scrutinizes claims by Judicial Affairs co-chair Statements at meeting were misleading, created confusion among ASSU reps 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DEPUTY EDITOR 
Michele Dauber, Stanford law professor
and co-chair of the Judicial Affairs Committee,
made misleading statements to an assembly of
student representatives last Wednesday re
garding the new Alternative Review Process
(ARP) for sexual assault cases on campus.
ASSU Senator Ben Laufer 'l2 said at the Sen
ate's Tuesday meeting, at which Dauber was
not present, that he felt she "misled to the point
where she even actually might have lied to us."
Laufer later apologized for saying Dauber may
have lied.
The misleading statement came when
Dauber was discussing how sexual assault
cases handled by Judicial Affairs are civil cases,
which she incorrectly said never require unan
imous agreement among jurors.
"There is no such thing as a unanimous re
quirement in any civil case anywhere, ever,"
Dauber told the assembly last week. "We just
don't have unanimous requirements in civil
cases."
According to a Department of Justice Sta
tistics Special Report on civil justice in state
courts from 2004,27 states require unanimous
convictions in civil cases. Only 11 require a
three-fourths majority and all others, except
for Montana, require a higher percentage of
agreement (Montana only requires two-thirds
agreement).
Dauber responded in an email to The Daily
that the 2004 report is accurate, but warned of
intricacies in the legal process, as different
courts have different rules across states. No
such nuance or qualification was included in
her original statement at the meeting.
In addition, Dauber said that by "we," she
was referring to the State of California, which
she felt was clear given Stanford's location.
Laufer, Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4 and Stan
ford Daily Senate reporter Julia Enthoven 'l5
all stated that no such clarification was con
veyed during that part of the meeting. All three
stated that they were under the impression
Dauber was speaking generally
about the United States.
The ARP represents a change
in the Judicial Affairs Commit
tee's procedure regarding trials
of students who are accused of
sexual assault, sexual violence,
relationship violence and stalk
ing.
Under the new ARP, three of
the four "reviewers" would be re
quired to agree in order to decide
a student's case, which is consis
tent with current University poli
cy. The Senate and Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC) are current
ly deliberating whether to ap
prove the pilot program ARP.
Dauber commented on The
Daily website, accusing the publi
cation of publishing false accusa
tions against faculty members
after The Daily included Laufer's
quote in a Wednesday article
("Senate debates use of leftover
funds," April 25). Dauber wrote in
the comments that the informa
tion she gave the Senate and
Graduate Student Council was
"entirely correct."
A 2004 report from the Amer
ican Bar Association states that,

"In civil cases, jury decisions
should be unanimous wherever
feasible. A less-than-unanimous
decision should be accepted only
after jurors have deliberated for a
reasonable period of time and if
concurred in by at least five-sixths
of the jurors."
The report qualifies that a less
er number of jurors is acceptable
if agreed upon by both parties.
Laufer, Elhanan and En
thoven all said that the overall
message of Dauber's comments
was that nowhere in the United
States are civil cases required to
be decided by unanimous vote.
It is unclear whether the ARP
seeks to conform to Federal or
California guidelines or employs
a hybrid of the two. The recom
mendation to lower the standard
of proof to preponderance of evi
dence came from the U.S. Depart
ment of Education Office of Civil
Rights, yet federal guidelines for
civil jury cases require unanimous
agreement.
In California a simple three
fourths majority is required,
though juries on California civil
cases consist of 12 jurors, while Ju
dicial Affairs currently uses four
jurors. No state currently uses
four jurors for civil court cases.

message of Dauber's comments
was that nowhere in the United
States are civil cases required to
be decided by unanimous vote.
It is unclear whether the ARP
seeks to conform to Federal or
California guidelines or employs
a hybrid of the two. The recom
mendation to lower the standard
of proof to preponderance of evi
dence came from the U.S. Depart
ment of Education Office of Civil
Rights, yet federal guidelines for
civil jury cases require unanimous
agreement.
In California a simple three
fourths majority is required,
though juries on California civil
cases consist of 12 jurors, while Ju
dicial Affairs currently uses four
jurors. No state currently uses
four jurors for civil court cases.
