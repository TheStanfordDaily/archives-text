## Senator scrutinizes claims by Judicial Affairs co-chair Statements at meeting were misleading, created confusion among ASSU reps 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DEPUTY EDITOR 
Michele Dauber, Stanford law professor
and co-chair of the Judicial Affairs Committee,
made misleading statements to an assembly of
student representatives last Wednesday re
garding the new Alternative Review Process
(ARP) for sexual assault cases on campus.
ASSU Senator Ben Laufer 'l2 said at the Sen
ate's Tuesday meeting, at which Dauber was
not present, that he felt she "misled to the point
where she even actually might have lied to us."
Laufer later apologized for saying Dauber may
have lied.
The misleading statement came when
Dauber was discussing how sexual assault
cases handled by Judicial Affairs are civil cases,
which she incorrectly said never require unan
imous agreement among jurors.
"There is no such thing as a unanimous re
quirement in any civil case anywhere, ever,"
Dauber told the assembly last week. "We just
don't have unanimous requirements in civil
cases."
According to a Department of Justice Sta
tistics Special Report on civil justice in state
courts from 2004,27 states require unanimous
convictions in civil cases. Only 11 require a
three-fourths majority and all others, except
for Montana, require a higher percentage of
agreement (Montana only requires two-thirds
agreement).
Dauber responded in an email to The Daily
that the 2004 report is accurate, but warned of
intricacies in the legal process, as different
courts have different rules across states. No
such nuance or qualification was included in
her original statement at the meeting.
In addition, Dauber said that by "we," she
was referring to the State of California, which
she felt was clear given Stanford's location.
Laufer, Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4 and Stan
ford Daily Senate reporter Julia Enthoven 'l5
all stated that no such clarification was con
veyed during that part of the meeting. All three
stated that they were under the impression
