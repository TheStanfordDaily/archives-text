# MEN'S TENNIS
## Utes first up in Pac-12 tournament 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Having concluded the regular season with
convincing victories over Pacific and No. 14
California, the No. 10 Stanford men's tennis
team seems to be peaking at just the right time
as it enters postseason play in the form of the
inaugural Pac-12 Championships in Ojai,
Calif.
"The team is excited about the opportuni
ties ahead of us," said senior Ryan Thacher.
"The last week of practice was the best of the
year, illustrating the team's focus heading into
the postseason. I am confident in this team's
ability to make some noise in the Pac-12s and
in the NCAAs following that."
The No. 3-seed Cardinal (16-7,5-2 Pac-12)
will face No. 7-seed Utah today in the quarter

finals. The Utes (12-11,1-6) cruised to a con
vincing 4-0 victory over No. 6-seed Oregon
yesterday to progress to the quarterfinals.
The winner of today's match will face No. 2-
seed (and the No. 1 team in the nation) USC, in
the semifinals on Friday. The victor in the other
quarterfinal, between No. 4-seed Cal and No.
5-seed Washington, will square off with No. 1-
seed (and No. 5 nationally) UCLA earlier on
Friday for a place in the final on Saturday.
While Utah's struggles in conference play
may bode well for Stanford, the competition
between the two teams in early April was
tightly contested. In an indoor match at high
elevation, and in front of a partisan crowd, the
Cardinal jumped out to a 3-0 lead but strug
gled to put the Utes away, eventually clinching
a 4-3 victory in the penultimate match.
For this match, however, both teams will be

much better-known entities. Utah's lineup will
remain unchanged, while Stanford will likely
make only one change starting junior
Denis Lin ahead of freshman Robert Stine
man from the earlier contest. Nevertheless,
Stanford will look to take advantage of mo
mentum garnered through two emphatic vic
tories over Cal and Pacific, as well as greater
stability and depth in the lineup against a Utah
team that had dropped five straight before
winning its last two matches.
The Cardinal should also be able to exer
cise a significant advantage over the Utes in in
dividual matches, with the presence of two top
-50 players No. 27 Thacher and No. 36 senior
Bradley Klahn going unmatched by Utah.
Looking ahead to the prospective semifinal
matchup against the Trojans, how
ever, Stanford will likely face a sig
nificantly stiffer challenge. The
Cardinal has struggled to gain any
traction against USC in two
matchups this year, with Stanford

succumbing to 7-0 sweeps on both
occasions.
However, with the Trojans'
confidence likely dented as they
come off their first loss of the sea
son a narrow 4-3 defeat against
rival UCLA the opportunity
for the Cardinal to get revenge
should provide a tantalizing chal
lenge after overcoming today's
test.
"We are taking it one match at

a time starting with Utah,"
Thacher said. "The conference is
deep and we know that we can't
take any team lightly. That said, I
think that everyone is quietly and
eagerly awaiting the rematch with
USC if we can get there."
The Cardinal and the Utes will
square off today at 2 p.m. in Ojai.
