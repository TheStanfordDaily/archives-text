# Co-champs eye tourney

### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
With a 7-0 sweep over Wash
ington State in Ojai, Calif., yester
day, the Stanford women's tennis
team officially brought its regular
season to a close. The No. 31
Cougars (18-6, 6-4 Pac-12) were
no match for No. 5 Stanford, who
surrendered only one set all day.
The meeting, rescheduled after a
rainout on March 25, cemented
the Cardinal as co-champions of
the Pac-12, alongside No. 4 USC
(20-3,9-1). Apart from 2009, Stan
ford (18-1,9-1) has taken at least a
portion of the conference champi
onship every year since 1987.
Stanford captured the doubles
point first and continued to roll
with six straight singles victories.
Junior Stacey Tan was the first to
finish with a decisive 6-0, 6-0
blow to her opponent, Ksenia
Googe, as junior Mallory Bur
dette followed in suit with a
shutout victory over Washington
State's Elisabeth Fournier. Soph
omore Nicole Gibbs, freshman
Ellen Tsay, senior Veronica Li and
junior Natalie Dillon all con
tributed wins as well.
"Today we had to take care of
business," said head coach Lele
Forood. "And we did. We had a re
ally good performance."
Forood acknowledged that, de
spite finishing the regular season
as Pac-12 co-champions, Stanford
has suffered some uphill battles.
"We are not healthy," Forood
said. "[Sophomore Kristie Ahn] is
still not available, but we're opti
mistic about getting her back for
NCAAs and she's been working
incredibly hard. Even [sophomore
Amelia Herring] has been injured
and had to have a procedure on
her wrist."
That leaves the Cardinal with
six healthy players, the number re
quired for each match.
"Our backs have been against
the wall," Forood said, "but this
group is very resilient and has
done a great job."
Luckily for Stanford, Herring
will return for the Pac-12 invita
tional draw this weekend. All of
her teammates, apart from Ahn,
the defending champion of the
Pac-10 tournament, will partici
pate in singles, doubles or both at
the tournament.
The women's singles draw will
consist of 32 players, and the dou
bles draw will include 16 teams.
Gibbs, who has manned court

one for Stanford all season, will
appear in the main draw, along
with teammates Burdette,Tan and
Tsay. When asked who her tough
est opponents will be, she pointed
to none other than the ones she
practices against every day.
"First and foremost, [Burdette]
and my other teammates," she
said. "It's very uniquely difficult to
play someone on your team.
You're so used to it being a sup
port system, and there are certain
internal pressures associated with
playing the other girls. We have to
do it all the time though, so what
ever happens, it's not the end of
the world to win or lose. I just want
to improve with each match and
put myself in the best situation for
NCAAs."
Forood added to Gibbs' senti
ment.
"It's not like they stop talking
to their teammates," Forood

laughed. "They're kept in separate
quarters, so they wouldn't meet
each other until the semifinals
anyway. It certainly happens,
though, and everyone handles it
very well."
After this weekend, Stanford
will have almost two weeks until
the start of NCAAs. Although not
confirmed, Forood hinted that an
exhibition match against the
USTA's top juniors is in the works
for May 2.
"It gives us our only competi
tion in the period between Pac-12
and NCAAs," Forood said. "And
quite frankly, it gives me the
chance to see the top juniors."
Gibbs, who trained with the
USTA program for many years,
thinks that such a match would be
beneficial in helping the players
remain sharp during the time off.
"These are players that I
trained with, so it's fun to see who

will go pro, and who are viable op
tions to recruit at Stanford," she
said. "I think that it would be a fun
exhibition match to tune us up."
Stanford will also put to good
use its own depth in the time be
tween Pac-12s and NCAAs.
"We made some changes to the
way we practice after playing USC
and UCLA two weekends ago,"
Gibbs said. "We're trying to get
more focus and drive instilled dur
ing practice and everyone's been
doing a good job. Tons of fitness,
too. We need to start getting ready
for that Georgia weather."
In the meantime, the Cardinal
players will take the courts of the
Ojai Valley Athletic Club today.
The singles and doubles finals will
be held on Sunday starting at 10:30
a.m. at Libbey Park.

Junior Stacey Tan (above) double-bageled her opponent in Stanford's makeup match against Washington
State yesterday as the Cardinal swept the Cougars to earn a share of the conference title. Stanford will now
shift its attention to the Pac-12 tournament, where Stanford will compete for the singles and doubles crowns.
With a 7-0 sweep over Wash
ington State in Ojai, Calif., yester
day, the Stanford women's tennis
team officially brought its regular
season to a close. The No. 31
Cougars (18-6, 6-4 Pac-12) were
no match for No. 5 Stanford, who
surrendered only one set all day.
The meeting, rescheduled after a
rainout on March 25, cemented
the Cardinal as co-champions of
the Pac-12, alongside No. 4 USC
(20-3,9-1). Apart from 2009, Stan
ford (18-1,9-1) has taken at least a
portion of the conference champi
onship every year since 1987.
Stanford captured the doubles
point first and continued to roll
with six straight singles victories.
Junior Stacey Tan was the first to
finish with a decisive 6-0, 6-0
blow to her opponent, Ksenia
Googe, as junior Mallory Bur
dette followed in suit with a
shutout victory over Washington
State's Elisabeth Fournier. Soph
omore Nicole Gibbs, freshman
Ellen Tsay, senior Veronica Li and
junior Natalie Dillon all con
tributed wins as well.
"Today we had to take care of
business," said head coach Lele
Forood. "And we did. We had a re
ally good performance."
Forood acknowledged that, de
spite finishing the regular season
as Pac-12 co-champions, Stanford
has suffered some uphill battles.
"We are not healthy," Forood
said. "[Sophomore Kristie Ahn] is
still not available, but we're opti
mistic about getting her back for
NCAAs and she's been working
incredibly hard. Even [sophomore
Amelia Herring] has been injured
and had to have a procedure on
her wrist."
That leaves the Cardinal with
six healthy players, the number re
quired for each match.
"Our backs have been against
the wall," Forood said, "but this
group is very resilient and has
done a great job."
Luckily for Stanford, Herring
will return for the Pac-12 invita
tional draw this weekend. All of
her teammates, apart from Ahn,
the defending champion of the
Pac-10 tournament, will partici
pate in singles, doubles or both at
the tournament.
The women's singles draw will
consist of 32 players, and the dou
bles draw will include 16 teams.
Gibbs, who has manned court

one for Stanford all season, will
appear in the main draw, along
with teammates Burdette,Tan and
Tsay. When asked who her tough
est opponents will be, she pointed
to none other than the ones she
practices against every day.
"First and foremost, [Burdette]
and my other teammates," she
said. "It's very uniquely difficult to
play someone on your team.
You're so used to it being a sup
port system, and there are certain
internal pressures associated with
playing the other girls. We have to
do it all the time though, so what
ever happens, it's not the end of
the world to win or lose. I just want
to improve with each match and
put myself in the best situation for
NCAAs."
Forood added to Gibbs' senti
ment.
"It's not like they stop talking
to their teammates," Forood

laughed. "They're kept in separate
quarters, so they wouldn't meet
each other until the semifinals
anyway. It certainly happens,
though, and everyone handles it
very well."
After this weekend, Stanford
will have almost two weeks until
the start of NCAAs. Although not
confirmed, Forood hinted that an
exhibition match against the
USTA's top juniors is in the works
for May 2.
"It gives us our only competi
tion in the period between Pac-12
and NCAAs," Forood said. "And
quite frankly, it gives me the
chance to see the top juniors."
Gibbs, who trained with the
USTA program for many years,
thinks that such a match would be
beneficial in helping the players
remain sharp during the time off.
"These are players that I
trained with, so it's fun to see who

will go pro, and who are viable op
tions to recruit at Stanford," she
said. "I think that it would be a fun
exhibition match to tune us up."
Stanford will also put to good
use its own depth in the time be
tween Pac-12s and NCAAs.
"We made some changes to the
way we practice after playing USC
and UCLA two weekends ago,"
Gibbs said. "We're trying to get
more focus and drive instilled dur
ing practice and everyone's been
