# GCEP grants $8.4m for green research
## Stanford teams develop efficient energy tech to combat greenhouse gas emissions 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's Global Climate and
Energy Project (GCEP) has award
ed $8.4 million to seven Stanford re
search teams for developing high
efficiency energy technologies de
signed to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.
"These awards support funda
mental research on a broad range of
potentially game-changing energy
technologies," said GCEP director
Sally Benson, according to the Stan
ford News Service.

The GCEP, an industry partner
ship supported by five firms

ExxonMobil, GE, Schlumberger,
Toyota and DuPont and based at
Stanford, has in total supported 93
research programs with $ll3 mil
lion in grants since the project's
2002 launch.
The GCEP portfolio includes re
search grants in fields ranging from
photovoltaic energy to carbon cap
ture.
While GCEP's grants are well
known in the scientific community,
they are only accessible for Stan
ford faculty. GCEP grants are ex
plicitly targeted at funding research
in its earliest stages, to counter the

lack of resources that can often de
feat the jump from theory to large
scale applications.
"GCEP has gained internation
al recognition for supporting re
search in fundamental and applied
research related to energy and the
environment," wrote Jennifer
Dionne, professor of materials sci
ence and engineering and one of
the grants' lead investigators, in an
email to The Daily.
Dionne's team will investigate
methods of making a new kind of
electrode that converts photons
from low-energy to high-energy
states. Such advances would make
photovoltaic cells more efficient
and maximize the potential for har
vesting solar energy.
"Our proposal is fundamental,
in that we are exploring new ways
of utilizing spectral regimes of the
solar spectrum that are wasted with
conventional photovoltaic and
photo catalytic technologies,"
Dionne wrote.
Another team of researchers
will also work to develop new ma
terials for energy conversion appli
cations, in this case by attempting to
identify new thermally and chemi
cally stable nano-materials that ef
ficiently convert heat into electrici
ty. Such materials could be used to
maximize energy efficiency in
power plants.
"By doing that we think we can
double the efficiency of solar ther
mal power plants, and reduce the
cost of the electricity produced, be
cause we believe that the addition
al energy converter we could put
on top of the existing system would

not be very expensive," said Igor
Bargatin, an engineering postdoc
toral scholar.
While these research projects
may be geared toward future in
dustrial application, researchers
emphasized that technologies de
veloped may also find use in a resi
dential context.
"We would like to have the abil
ity to do this in the home at a small
er scale," Bargatin said. "You can
have a system that does not vibrate,
does not produce noise, does not
require maintenance â€”if we can
fabricate it efficiently [for] cheap
then it's a cheap application."
The research team is currently
working on validating its theory,
but plans on then modifying sam
ples in order to begin gathering
data for the project. Bargatin called
three years a "reasonable time
frame" for developing useful appli
cations from the current conceptu
al stage.
While GCEP initially struggled
to get corporate sponsors on board,
Richard Sassoon, GCEP's manag
ing director, emphasized the symbi
otic nature of the current relation
ship.
"It's a big, large corporation
looking in the long-term; it does
need to see what is coming in the
pipeline, and what are the new
trends that could be taking place,"
Sassoon said, referring to Exxon-
Mobil's initial sponsorship and sub
sequent attempts to bring other
firms to GCEP.
"GCEP provides a starting
point for that type of research,"
Sassoon added. "It's an involved
discussion on both sides. In the end,
we're happy that GCEP is around
and doing the work that it's doing."
