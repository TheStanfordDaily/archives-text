Stanford's Global Climate and
Energy Project (GCEP) has award
ed $8.4 million to seven Stanford re
search teams for developing high
efficiency energy technologies de
signed to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.
"These awards support funda
mental research on a broad range of
potentially game-changing energy
technologies," said GCEP director
Sally Benson, according to the Stan
ford News Service.

The GCEP, an industry partner
ship supported by five firms

ExxonMobil, GE, Schlumberger,
Toyota and DuPont and based at
Stanford, has in total supported 93
research programs with $ll3 mil
lion in grants since the project's
2002 launch.
The GCEP portfolio includes re
search grants in fields ranging from
photovoltaic energy to carbon cap
ture.
While GCEP's grants are well
known in the scientific community,
they are only accessible for Stan
ford faculty. GCEP grants are ex
plicitly targeted at funding research
in its earliest stages, to counter the
