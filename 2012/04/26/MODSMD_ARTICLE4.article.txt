"Visions of Tomorrow" was the theme at Wednesday
evening's Stanford 2020 Symposium, which included
seven 15-minute presentations by notable Stanford facul
ty on a host of subjects ranging from global democracy to
a food revolution.
The event, financially supported by the ASSU, the
Speaker's Bureau and the Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education, and co-sponsored by 18 other campus
groups, united seven faculty members of diverse special
ties to discuss fundamental future trends and problems
gleaned from their own research, and the multidiscipli
nary approaches to their solutions.
The event was kicked off by David Kennedy, professor
of history, who spoke about the potential for a water short
age in the American West in the near future, which he at
tributed to climate change, land subsidence and a flawed
plumbing infrastructure.
"The tremendous success story that is the develop
ment of the American West was made possible by massive
irrigation," Kennedy said.
He warned that ongoing trends mean the future supply
of water for humans is far less certain than a generation
ago. Kennedy concluded by discussing the global scope of
the problem and sharing his hope for the audience to work
toward a solution.
Larry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO, director of the
Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of
Law (CDDRL), presented on the topic of a more demo
cratic world, and shared his optimism for this trend to be
come the norm.
This hope was compounded by his observation that
"there exist many now functioning democracies despite
relatively modest economic growth," in contrast with the
prevailing narrative that freedoms are closely connected
to economic performance.
"You don't have to be a part of the middle class," he as
serted, "to believe in dignity, or in human rights."
The "clock is ticking for authoritarian regimes," Dia
mond concluded, asserting that 2020 will be a much freer
and more democratic time than today.
Stan Christensen, a lecturer in civil and environmental
engineering and a partner at Arbor Advisors, proceeded
with the topic of negotiations, their importance, their
under-appreciation and common misconceptions on the
subject.
