## Warsh discusses Dodd-Frank reform 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
"Some will say it's a bad thing and others will say it's a
good thing but too few will say 'Dodd-Frank risks the fol
lowing bad things, but there is an alternative,"' said Kevin
Warsh '92, former member of the Federal Reserve Board
of Governors, Wednesday.
Throughout his talk, Warsh emphasized what he
deemed the "three fundamental pillars" of the economy
regulators, market discipline and capital standards and
how they should be applied to government legislation.
Warsh, currently a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion and a lecturer at the Graduate School of Business
(GSB), spoke to an audience of approximately 70 people at
Paul Brest Hall Wednesday evening, in a talk titled "Real
Regulatory Reform: A Practitioner's Perspective,"
The regulation in question, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, is a federal statute
signed into law by President Obama in July 2010 and in
tended to provide more extensive regulation of financial
institutions following the recession in the late 2000s. The
Dodd-Frank Act has come under extensive criticism for its
complexity and, for some, excessive regulation.

law extends only to a 14-week in
ternship stint at a law firm, he as
serted, "my legal training and my
exposure to law made me a bet
ter regulator."
"I would never claim to be an
expert, but I learned a lot from
observing the system as a regula
tor and policymaker," he added.
Warsh criticized, however, the
bias toward regulation as a reme
dy for the post-recession econo
my, stating that the other two
"pillars" have not received
enough attention and invest
ment. He called the notion "that
with more regulators, with more
funding and more power, bad
things won't happen" an over
simplistic and erroneous one.

"These three pillars need to
be complementary," he said. "I
am worried that market disci
pline and capital standards are
being relegated instead of re
vived.
"The risk of Dodd-Frank is
that we end up with several oli
gopolistic systems on top of the
financial center that will make it
increasingly difficult for smaller
regional banks to function," he
added.
While Warsh expressed gen
eral support for reform in the
banking system, he expressed
concern that "at the core . . .
[the] Dodd-Frank act will be no
equal to the task."
He also emphasized that
looking toward other countries
for examples of successful re
forms of the banking sector isn't
an option, due to sustained and
extensive differences in banking
systems between nations.

Criticizing the concept of "too
big to fail" as static, Warsh advo
cated for a system in which "an
early assessment of financial
firms and vibrant competition
among them is the best way to
avoid another financial crisis."
"The largest firms must tell
regulators [that] their failures
will not endanger the economy,"
he said. "If they can't pass this
simple test then they should be
diminished."
Prior to his 2006 to 2011 term
on the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors, Warsh served from
2002 to 2006 as special assistant
to the president for economic pol
icy and executive secretary of the
White House National Economic
Council. He pre viously worked at
Morgan Stanley as vice president
and executive director.
