## Website inefficiencies cause battery drainage 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marshall Watkins 
Research on the battery-crippling effect of
free apps, watching video or playing games on a
smartphone is well known and highly publicized
but, according to researchers at Stanford and
Deutsche Telekom, even browsing popular web

sites can cause rapid battery drainage.
Researchers suggest that the inefficiency
caused by bloated and redundant code can
be reduced by almost 30 percent without induc
ing a diminished user experience, and noted that
increased website energy efficiency will become
increasingly important as smartphone usage
continues to increase.
Stanford computer scientist Narendran Thi
agarajan and her research team measured the
energy usage of an Android phone when down
loading and rendering 25 popular websites over

a 3G connection.The team discovered that load
ing the mobile version of Wikipedia consumed
over 1 percent of the phone's battery, as did the
Apple homepage, which offers no mobile ver
sion for smartphone users.
The team repeated the measurements with
locally saved versions of tested websites re
moving the energy requirement posed by down
loading the page and rewrote the website
coding to reduce energy usage by nearly a third.
