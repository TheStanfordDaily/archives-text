## Ben-Ami advocates two-state solution Speaker encourages dialogue within Jewish community 
### MARWA FARAG MANAGING EDITOR 
Jeremy Ben-Ami, founder and
president of advocacy group J
Street, advocated for a two-state
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and open discussion on Is
rael within the American Jewish
community in a talk Wednesday at
the Black Community Services
Center.
Ben-Ami discussed three areas
of challenge facing Americans on
subjects related to Israel the fu
ture of the Israeli state, Israel in
U.S. politics and how the Ameri
can Jewish community can hold
conversation on both subjects. He
criticized Israel's current path as
"simply not sustainable."
"I start by acknowledging all
that Israel has accomplished, but
we have to be honest and ac
knowledge all of the challenges
and the threats," Ben-Ami said.
He went on to detail the exter
nal and internal threats facing Is
rael, including "a terrible neigh
borhood" and the "extreme
fringes of Israeli society."
These challenges, Ben-Ami
posited, complicate the question
of supporting Israel today.
"Back when I was growing up
in the '6os and '7os, supporting Is
rael was a really straightforward
proposition: You simply stood
with Israel," he said. "Israel was
David, a small country, facing
down Goliath ... Today the story
is far less simple."
"The question of what it means
to be pro-Israel is far more com
plex and the heart of the challenge
today is the need to find a resolu
tion to the longstanding conflict
with the Palestinian people," he
added.
Being pro-Israel today, as Ben-
Ami argued and J Street advo
cates, means embracing a two
state solution to the Israel-Pales
tinian conflict, whereby a territo
rial compromise is the "only way
that Israel can remain both a true
democracy and retain its Jewish
character."
"For those who care deeply
about the future and security of a
national homeland for the Jewish
people in the land of Israel... the
issue of a Palestinian state and the
establishment of an accepted bor
der between Israel and that state
is an existential necessity," Ben-
Ami said.
While acknowledging that Is
rael's own citizens are ultimately
responsible to make the choice to
change the country's course, he as
signed a role to American Jews, as
well.
"We [friends of Israel] have to
help our cousins in Israel to recog
nize the need to change course be
fore it's too late," Ben-Ami said.
Moving to the subject of Israel
within American politics, Ben-
Ami held that the United States
must act as mediator between Is
rael and the Palestinians, compar
ing the relationship between the
latter two parties to a "bad mar
riage" and arguing against direct
negotiations.
"This conflict is like a bad mar
riage, in which a couple needs a di
vorce and they need to come to
terms on how to separate," he
said. "In my experience, you don't
lock an angry husband and angry
wife into a room by themselves
and ask them to divide up their as
sets ... You need a mediator."
"That's the role that the U.S.
and the international community,
perhaps through the Quartet or
some new entity need to play," he
said, adding that the conflict is an
"American national security in
terest."

Ben-Ami outlined the parame
ters for a solution that will form
"the framework for a deal if there

ever will be a deal."These included
the establishment of two states
based on pre-1967 lines with land
swaps, a capital for both states in
Jerusalem with an international
ized Holy Basin, a demilitarized
Palestinian state with an interna
tional presence on the borders and
compensation rather than right of
return for Palestinian refugees.
"Pro-Israel advocacy in this
country needs to support and pro
mote strong presidential actions
now, to put these ideas forward
and to press both parties to reach
an agreement before it's too late,"
he said.
Ben-Ami then touched on the
"rules that govern the conversa
tion about Israel within the Amer
ican Jewish community," particu
larly in regards to toeing the line
between criticism of Israeli gov
ernment policies and the "de-le
gitimization" of the state of Israel
itself.
"I would argue that it isn't crit
icism of Israeli policy that threat
ens the health of the state of Is
rael," Ben-Ami said. "It is the poli
cies of Israel's present govern
ment that threaten its future."
To this end, he called for open

and respectful discussion within
the American Jewish community.
"To the extent that any of the
doors of the Jewish community
are barred ... to those who ques
tion conventional wisdom on Is
rael, I think that those who are
doing the barring within the
American Jewish establishment
are putting the future of this com
munity at risk," he said.
Audience member Serena
Eisenberg, Hillel executive direc
tor, inquired about the boundaries
of the conversation J Street hopes
to engender.
"I don't like the phrase 'one state
solution'... I refer to it as [a] 'one
state nightmare,"' Ben Ami said.
Other audience members
posed questions on the polariza
tion of the American Jewish com
munity and the right of Americans
to comment on Israeli domestic
politics.
The event kicked off the new
Stanford chapter of J Street U, a
national student-driven network
of activists providing an alterna
tive approach to Israel advocacy.

said. "In my experience, you don't
lock an angry husband and angry
wife into a room by themselves
and ask them to divide up their as
sets ... You need a mediator."
"That's the role that the U.S.
and the international community,
perhaps through the Quartet or
some new entity need to play," he
said, adding that the conflict is an
"American national security in
terest."

Ben-Ami outlined the parame
ters for a solution that will form
"the framework for a deal if there

ever will be a deal."These included
the establishment of two states
based on pre-1967 lines with land
swaps, a capital for both states in
Jerusalem with an international
ized Holy Basin, a demilitarized
Palestinian state with an interna
tional presence on the borders and
compensation rather than right of
return for Palestinian refugees.
"Pro-Israel advocacy in this
country needs to support and pro
mote strong presidential actions
now, to put these ideas forward
and to press both parties to reach
an agreement before it's too late,"
he said.
Ben-Ami then touched on the
"rules that govern the conversa
tion about Israel within the Amer
ican Jewish community," particu
larly in regards to toeing the line
between criticism of Israeli gov
ernment policies and the "de-le
gitimization" of the state of Israel
itself.
"I would argue that it isn't crit
icism of Israeli policy that threat
ens the health of the state of Is
rael," Ben-Ami said. "It is the poli
cies of Israel's present govern
ment that threaten its future."
To this end, he called for open

and respectful discussion within
the American Jewish community.
"To the extent that any of the
doors of the Jewish community
are barred ... to those who ques
tion conventional wisdom on Is
rael, I think that those who are
doing the barring within the
American Jewish establishment
are putting the future of this com
munity at risk," he said.
Audience member Serena
Eisenberg, Hillel executive direc
tor, inquired about the boundaries
of the conversation J Street hopes
to engender.
"I don't like the phrase 'one state
solution'... I refer to it as [a] 'one
state nightmare,"' Ben Ami said.
Other audience members
posed questions on the polariza
tion of the American Jewish com
munity and the right of Americans
to comment on Israeli domestic
politics.
The event kicked off the new
Stanford chapter of J Street U, a
national student-driven network
of activists providing an alterna
tive approach to Israel advocacy.

Jeremy Ben-Ami, founder and president of advocacy group J Street,
spoke Wednesday at the Black Community Services Center on the future
of Israel and United States policy toward the Middle Eastern state.
Jeremy Ben-Ami, founder and
president of advocacy group J
Street, advocated for a two-state
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and open discussion on Is
rael within the American Jewish
community in a talk Wednesday at
the Black Community Services
Center.
Ben-Ami discussed three areas
of challenge facing Americans on
subjects related to Israel the fu
ture of the Israeli state, Israel in
U.S. politics and how the Ameri
can Jewish community can hold
conversation on both subjects. He
criticized Israel's current path as
"simply not sustainable."
"I start by acknowledging all
that Israel has accomplished, but
we have to be honest and ac
knowledge all of the challenges
and the threats," Ben-Ami said.
He went on to detail the exter
nal and internal threats facing Is
rael, including "a terrible neigh
borhood" and the "extreme
fringes of Israeli society."
These challenges, Ben-Ami
posited, complicate the question
of supporting Israel today.
"Back when I was growing up
in the '6os and '7os, supporting Is
rael was a really straightforward
proposition: You simply stood
with Israel," he said. "Israel was
David, a small country, facing
down Goliath ... Today the story
is far less simple."
"The question of what it means
to be pro-Israel is far more com
plex and the heart of the challenge
today is the need to find a resolu
tion to the longstanding conflict
with the Palestinian people," he
added.
Being pro-Israel today, as Ben-
Ami argued and J Street advo
cates, means embracing a two
state solution to the Israel-Pales
tinian conflict, whereby a territo
rial compromise is the "only way
that Israel can remain both a true
democracy and retain its Jewish
character."
"For those who care deeply
about the future and security of a
national homeland for the Jewish
people in the land of Israel... the
issue of a Palestinian state and the
establishment of an accepted bor
der between Israel and that state
is an existential necessity," Ben-
Ami said.
While acknowledging that Is
rael's own citizens are ultimately
responsible to make the choice to
change the country's course, he as
signed a role to American Jews, as
well.
"We [friends of Israel] have to
help our cousins in Israel to recog
nize the need to change course be
fore it's too late," Ben-Ami said.
Moving to the subject of Israel
within American politics, Ben-
Ami held that the United States
must act as mediator between Is
rael and the Palestinians, compar
ing the relationship between the
latter two parties to a "bad mar
riage" and arguing against direct
negotiations.
"This conflict is like a bad mar
riage, in which a couple needs a di
vorce and they need to come to
terms on how to separate," he
said. "In my experience, you don't
lock an angry husband and angry
wife into a room by themselves
and ask them to divide up their as
sets ... You need a mediator."
