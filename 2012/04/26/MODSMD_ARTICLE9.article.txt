## 'WE WILL ACHIEVE PEACE' Palestinian activist Fadi Quran '10 seeks nonviolent path to future in Middle East 
### STEPHEN COBBE 
At its core, quantum
physics is a science of
probabilities. When
dealing with particle un
certainties and ambigu
ous dualities, a calculated likelihood
is the closest thing to certainty. Fadi
Quran 'lO believes there is a lesson
in this concept that can be applied to
his work in social activism.
"The paths that particles take
have multiple histories, each of
which you must add together in
order to predict the probabilities of
where the particles may land,"
Quran said. "In much the same way,
as a social activist, every time I try
and plan a strategy in advance, I take
all the possible scenarios on that
path and add them up to approxi
mate what needs to be done to
achieve the most successful result."
Quran, 24, has bachelor's de
grees in both physics and interna
tional relations from Stanford. He
is a leading figure in the burgeoning
Palestinian youth movement com
mitted to achieving "freedom, jus
tice and dignity" for the Palestinian
people. The movement, according
to Quran, is not associated with any
political factions, and categorically
rejects the use of violence to achieve
its goals.
Growing up in Ramallah in the
West Bank, Quran witnessed first
hand the destructiveness brought on
by violent protest during the Second
Palestinian Intifada, which began in
2000.
"Your whole worldview
changes," Quran said, as he recalled
bullets flying through his sister's
bedroom.
The devastation of the uprising
impressed upon him a feeling of re
sponsibility for changing the status
quo in the Occupied Territories.
In recent months, Quran and his
movement have risen greatly in
prominence, receiving coverage
from news organizations such as The
Washington Post, Time Magazine
and A1 Jazeera. The "Freedom
Rides" the group undertook last No
vember received especially strong
media attention. Inspired by the
freedom riders of the 1960s civil
rights movement who defiantly rode
on segregated buses through the Jim
Crow South, Quran and fellow ac
tivists boarded an Israeli commuter
bus in the West Bank, hoping to end
what they see as a discriminatory
system.
Shortly after the bus departed
for Jerusalem however, it was
stopped and boarded by Israeli po
lice. All six of the activists were ar
rested for trying to enter Jerusalem

without the proper permits.
Last February at a protest in He
bron, Quran was again detained by
Israeli authorities. This time, it was
on charges of obstructing a law en
forcement officer, assault and resist
ing arrest. During the incident,
Quran was pepper-sprayed by po
lice. Though he was released five
days later on bail for lack of defini
tive evidence, Quran remains under
investigation and is due for ques
tioning again on May 3, as The Daily
reported.
Being in prison had a profound
effect on Quran. He spent his first
two days in solitary confinement.
"When they [lsraeli security
forces] brought me in, I couldn't see
anything because of the pepper
spray the only thing open was my
mind's eye," Quran recounted.
The pain and isolation forced
Quran to evaluate his priorities.
"During that time, I thought
about the world I wanted to see, the
legacy I wanted to leave behind," he
said. "I was in pain and I was afraid
for the first hour or two, but it was
one of the most eye-opening experi
ences of my life."
Quran's resilience comes from a
number of sources. As a teenager, he
was moved by books about Nelson
Mandela and Martin Luther King,
Jr., two activists who also spent time

in prison. The Palestinian communi
ty, too, inspired young Quran.
As a 10-year-old boy, he wit
nessed the selflessness of those who
risked their lives to bring food to the
needy and to assist the elderly who
couldn't leave their homes.
"Usually when we think of men
torship, we think of individuals
here in Palestine, the whole commu
nity acts organically to grow and
mentor young men and women," he
said.

But Quran's greatest source of
inspiration continues to be his moth
er and grandmothers.
"One of the things that I've
learned through my life experience
is that powerful women who work
hard, who nurture and care for their
family, friends and community, are
the key to a successful society and to
great individuals," he said. "They are
the greatest individuals."
Quran would also develop a
close connection with the faculty
and students at Stanford after his
arrival in 2006. While he was apply
ing to colleges, Quran hoped to pur
sue his interests in physics while
studying a subject that could help
him change the situation in Pales
tine. After consulting with friends
and teachers, he discovered that
Stanford was a place where he
could do both.
Life in California, however, was
vastly different from the one Quran
had in Palestine.
"I remember days during the
month-long curfews when I had to
help my family and neighbors get
bread," Quran said. The dichotomy
of those experiences and his life at
Stanford, a "land of milk and honey,"
was an important motivational tool.
"Seeing how challenging life ac
tually is for some people gives you
something to prepare for, to work

toward," he said.
Through classes and on-campus
activism, Quran quickly developed
his argumentative skills and ce
mented his place in the Stanford
community.
"One of the great things about
Stanford is that you can debate is
sues without the sense of fear that
might be created at other places,"
Quran said.
As a freshman, Quran became
an active participant in the debate

over whether Stanford should di
vest from companies allegedly as
sociated with the Israeli military
occupation of the West Bank. Tak
ing a strong stance on this contro
versial issue ensured his position at
the center of numerous campus de
bates. According to faculty mem
bers and peers, he always conduct
ed himself with restraint, open
mindedness and tolerance.

"Fadi [Quran] has an incredible
capacity to empathize with the per
spectives of others," said Allen
Weiner, senior lecturer in law, who
taught a conflict resolution semi
nar in which Quran was a student.
Weiner remembers moderating a
debate in one of his classes when
Quran came under substantial
pressure from students on the pro-
Israel side of the argument.
"What was really impressive
about Fadi was how committed he
was to finding areas of common
ground and mutual understanding,
while still being very staunch in his
defense of the interests of his com
munity," Weiner said.
Joe Gettinger 'll, who be
friended Quran at Stanford, ad
mired Quran's insistence on un
derstanding the other perspective
on the divestment issue, but said
he believes the most telling aspect
of Quran's character was his per
sonal efforts to bridge the gap be
tween communities.
"I remember he would come to
Shabbat dinner to get to know peo
ple and to learn about their per
spective," Gettinger said. "That re
ally said a lot because there was
very little to gain politically from
such a move, it was really about get
ting to know the community.That's
what makes Fadi so special."
Being at Stanford also taught
Quran important lessons in inno
vation and entrepreneurship that
he would later apply to his start-up
in alternative energy, Tayara Ener
gy. Running the business, which is
located in the West Bank, requires
Quran to tap into his interdiscipli
nary education, making use of his
skills as both a community organiz
er and a scientist. Quran sees the
start-up as one step toward fulfill
ing the goal of Palestinian self-suf
ficiency.
Currently, Tayara Energy's
major projects include designing a
high altitude wind generator to
provide electricity to rural com
munities, setting up programs to
train young people in proper recy
cling procedures to benefit refugee
camps and integrating affordable
solar panels into more construction
projects in the Middle East.
When Quran is not participating

in protests or running his company,
he studies constitutional law and
revolutions at Birzeit University in
Ramallah, where he is pursuing his
master's degree. Balancing ac
tivism, entrepreneurship and aca
demics can often present a heavy
load.
The way Quran sees it, though,
"it is not so much a question of bal
ancing as it is a question of integra
tion."
"A lot of the time at Stanford
you're taught to make compart
ments ... something I've learned is
that actually in most cases, I can in
tegrate everything together
through an interdisciplinary ap
proach," Quran said.
But that doesn't mean life isn't
full of stress for Quran. The day be
fore his interview with The Daily, a
friend of Quran's was arrested in
Bahrain. Quran spent an anxious
night worrying about the fate of his
friend and writing a paper due the
next day.
His community, he says, has be
come accustomed to arrests.
"There is always a sense of fear
and anxiousness when a family
member or friend is arrested," he
said. "Sometimes there is a fleeting
sense of despair, but it is not as raw
as the first time was."
Regarding the future, Quran is
cautiously optimistic, not only for
the Palestinians, but for the whole
region. All around him, he said, he
sees a new generation of Middle
Eastern youth focused on social
and business entrepreneurship. He
also sees young Arab academics in
unprecedented numbers pursuing
"science and truth."
All this, he believes, points to
ward a tipping point in the near fu
ture in which acts of nonviolence
generate more acts of nonviolence
until the Palestinian youth move
ment and others like it become full
fledged nonviolent uprisings.
"Then, we will achieve peace," he
said.

which you must add together in
order to predict the probabilities of
where the particles may land,"
Quran said. "In much the same way,
as a social activist, every time I try
and plan a strategy in advance, I take
all the possible scenarios on that
path and add them up to approxi
mate what needs to be done to
achieve the most successful result."
Quran, 24, has bachelor's de
grees in both physics and interna
tional relations from Stanford. He
is a leading figure in the burgeoning
Palestinian youth movement com
mitted to achieving "freedom, jus
tice and dignity" for the Palestinian
people. The movement, according
to Quran, is not associated with any
political factions, and categorically
rejects the use of violence to achieve
its goals.
Growing up in Ramallah in the
West Bank, Quran witnessed first
hand the destructiveness brought on
by violent protest during the Second
Palestinian Intifada, which began in
2000.
"Your whole worldview
changes," Quran said, as he recalled
bullets flying through his sister's
bedroom.
The devastation of the uprising
impressed upon him a feeling of re
sponsibility for changing the status
quo in the Occupied Territories.
In recent months, Quran and his
movement have risen greatly in
prominence, receiving coverage
from news organizations such as The
Washington Post, Time Magazine
and A1 Jazeera. The "Freedom
Rides" the group undertook last No
vember received especially strong
media attention. Inspired by the
freedom riders of the 1960s civil
rights movement who defiantly rode
on segregated buses through the Jim
Crow South, Quran and fellow ac
tivists boarded an Israeli commuter
bus in the West Bank, hoping to end
what they see as a discriminatory
system.
Shortly after the bus departed
for Jerusalem however, it was
stopped and boarded by Israeli po
lice. All six of the activists were ar
rested for trying to enter Jerusalem

without the proper permits.
Last February at a protest in He
bron, Quran was again detained by
Israeli authorities. This time, it was
on charges of obstructing a law en
forcement officer, assault and resist
ing arrest. During the incident,
Quran was pepper-sprayed by po
lice. Though he was released five
days later on bail for lack of defini
tive evidence, Quran remains under
investigation and is due for ques
tioning again on May 3, as The Daily
reported.
Being in prison had a profound
effect on Quran. He spent his first
two days in solitary confinement.
"When they [lsraeli security
forces] brought me in, I couldn't see
anything because of the pepper
spray the only thing open was my
mind's eye," Quran recounted.
The pain and isolation forced
Quran to evaluate his priorities.
"During that time, I thought
about the world I wanted to see, the
legacy I wanted to leave behind," he
said. "I was in pain and I was afraid
for the first hour or two, but it was
one of the most eye-opening experi
ences of my life."
Quran's resilience comes from a
number of sources. As a teenager, he
was moved by books about Nelson
Mandela and Martin Luther King,
Jr., two activists who also spent time

in prison. The Palestinian communi
ty, too, inspired young Quran.
As a 10-year-old boy, he wit
nessed the selflessness of those who
risked their lives to bring food to the
needy and to assist the elderly who
couldn't leave their homes.
"Usually when we think of men
torship, we think of individuals
here in Palestine, the whole commu
nity acts organically to grow and
mentor young men and women," he
said.

But Quran's greatest source of
inspiration continues to be his moth
er and grandmothers.
"One of the things that I've
learned through my life experience
is that powerful women who work
hard, who nurture and care for their
family, friends and community, are
the key to a successful society and to
great individuals," he said. "They are
the greatest individuals."
Quran would also develop a
close connection with the faculty
and students at Stanford after his
arrival in 2006. While he was apply
ing to colleges, Quran hoped to pur
sue his interests in physics while
studying a subject that could help
him change the situation in Pales
tine. After consulting with friends
and teachers, he discovered that
Stanford was a place where he
could do both.
Life in California, however, was
vastly different from the one Quran
had in Palestine.
"I remember days during the
month-long curfews when I had to
help my family and neighbors get
bread," Quran said. The dichotomy
of those experiences and his life at
Stanford, a "land of milk and honey,"
was an important motivational tool.
"Seeing how challenging life ac
tually is for some people gives you
something to prepare for, to work

toward," he said.
Through classes and on-campus
activism, Quran quickly developed
his argumentative skills and ce
mented his place in the Stanford
community.
"One of the great things about
Stanford is that you can debate is
sues without the sense of fear that
might be created at other places,"
Quran said.
As a freshman, Quran became
an active participant in the debate

over whether Stanford should di
vest from companies allegedly as
sociated with the Israeli military
occupation of the West Bank. Tak
ing a strong stance on this contro
versial issue ensured his position at
the center of numerous campus de
bates. According to faculty mem
bers and peers, he always conduct
ed himself with restraint, open
mindedness and tolerance.

"Fadi [Quran] has an incredible
capacity to empathize with the per
spectives of others," said Allen
Weiner, senior lecturer in law, who
taught a conflict resolution semi
nar in which Quran was a student.
Weiner remembers moderating a
debate in one of his classes when
Quran came under substantial
pressure from students on the pro-
Israel side of the argument.
"What was really impressive
about Fadi was how committed he
was to finding areas of common
ground and mutual understanding,
while still being very staunch in his
defense of the interests of his com
munity," Weiner said.
Joe Gettinger 'll, who be
friended Quran at Stanford, ad
mired Quran's insistence on un
derstanding the other perspective
on the divestment issue, but said
he believes the most telling aspect
of Quran's character was his per
sonal efforts to bridge the gap be
tween communities.
"I remember he would come to
Shabbat dinner to get to know peo
ple and to learn about their per
spective," Gettinger said. "That re
ally said a lot because there was
very little to gain politically from
such a move, it was really about get
ting to know the community.That's
what makes Fadi so special."
Being at Stanford also taught
Quran important lessons in inno
vation and entrepreneurship that
he would later apply to his start-up
in alternative energy, Tayara Ener
gy. Running the business, which is
located in the West Bank, requires
Quran to tap into his interdiscipli
nary education, making use of his
skills as both a community organiz
er and a scientist. Quran sees the
start-up as one step toward fulfill
ing the goal of Palestinian self-suf
ficiency.
Currently, Tayara Energy's
major projects include designing a
high altitude wind generator to
provide electricity to rural com
munities, setting up programs to
train young people in proper recy
cling procedures to benefit refugee
camps and integrating affordable
solar panels into more construction
projects in the Middle East.
When Quran is not participating

in protests or running his company,
he studies constitutional law and
revolutions at Birzeit University in
Ramallah, where he is pursuing his
master's degree. Balancing ac
tivism, entrepreneurship and aca
demics can often present a heavy
load.
The way Quran sees it, though,
"it is not so much a question of bal
ancing as it is a question of integra
tion."
"A lot of the time at Stanford
you're taught to make compart
ments ... something I've learned is
that actually in most cases, I can in
tegrate everything together
through an interdisciplinary ap
proach," Quran said.
But that doesn't mean life isn't
full of stress for Quran. The day be
fore his interview with The Daily, a
friend of Quran's was arrested in
Bahrain. Quran spent an anxious
night worrying about the fate of his
friend and writing a paper due the
next day.
His community, he says, has be
come accustomed to arrests.
"There is always a sense of fear
and anxiousness when a family
member or friend is arrested," he
said. "Sometimes there is a fleeting
sense of despair, but it is not as raw
as the first time was."
Regarding the future, Quran is
cautiously optimistic, not only for
the Palestinians, but for the whole
region. All around him, he said, he
sees a new generation of Middle
Eastern youth focused on social
and business entrepreneurship. He
also sees young Arab academics in
unprecedented numbers pursuing
"science and truth."
All this, he believes, points to
ward a tipping point in the near fu
ture in which acts of nonviolence
generate more acts of nonviolence
until the Palestinian youth move
ment and others like it become full
fledged nonviolent uprisings.
"Then, we will achieve peace," he
said.

tional relations from Stanford. He
is a leading figure in the burgeoning
Palestinian youth movement com
mitted to achieving "freedom, jus
tice and dignity" for the Palestinian
people. The movement, according
to Quran, is not associated with any
political factions, and categorically
rejects the use of violence to achieve
its goals.
Growing up in Ramallah in the
West Bank, Quran witnessed first
hand the destructiveness brought on
by violent protest during the Second
Palestinian Intifada, which began in
2000.
"Your whole worldview
changes," Quran said, as he recalled
bullets flying through his sister's
bedroom.
The devastation of the uprising
impressed upon him a feeling of re
sponsibility for changing the status
quo in the Occupied Territories.
In recent months, Quran and his
movement have risen greatly in
prominence, receiving coverage
from news organizations such as The
Washington Post, Time Magazine
and A1 Jazeera. The "Freedom
Rides" the group undertook last No
vember received especially strong
media attention. Inspired by the
freedom riders of the 1960s civil
rights movement who defiantly rode
on segregated buses through the Jim
Crow South, Quran and fellow ac
tivists boarded an Israeli commuter
bus in the West Bank, hoping to end
what they see as a discriminatory
system.
Shortly after the bus departed
for Jerusalem however, it was
stopped and boarded by Israeli po
lice. All six of the activists were ar
rested for trying to enter Jerusalem

without the proper permits.
Last February at a protest in He
bron, Quran was again detained by
Israeli authorities. This time, it was
on charges of obstructing a law en
forcement officer, assault and resist
ing arrest. During the incident,
Quran was pepper-sprayed by po
lice. Though he was released five
days later on bail for lack of defini
tive evidence, Quran remains under
investigation and is due for ques
tioning again on May 3, as The Daily
reported.
Being in prison had a profound
effect on Quran. He spent his first
two days in solitary confinement.
"When they [lsraeli security
forces] brought me in, I couldn't see
anything because of the pepper
spray the only thing open was my
mind's eye," Quran recounted.
The pain and isolation forced
Quran to evaluate his priorities.
"During that time, I thought
about the world I wanted to see, the
legacy I wanted to leave behind," he
said. "I was in pain and I was afraid
for the first hour or two, but it was
one of the most eye-opening experi
ences of my life."
Quran's resilience comes from a
number of sources. As a teenager, he
was moved by books about Nelson
Mandela and Martin Luther King,
Jr., two activists who also spent time

in prison. The Palestinian communi
ty, too, inspired young Quran.
As a 10-year-old boy, he wit
nessed the selflessness of those who
risked their lives to bring food to the
needy and to assist the elderly who
couldn't leave their homes.
"Usually when we think of men
torship, we think of individuals
here in Palestine, the whole commu
nity acts organically to grow and
mentor young men and women," he
said.

But Quran's greatest source of
inspiration continues to be his moth
er and grandmothers.
"One of the things that I've
learned through my life experience
is that powerful women who work
hard, who nurture and care for their
family, friends and community, are
the key to a successful society and to
great individuals," he said. "They are
the greatest individuals."
Quran would also develop a
close connection with the faculty
and students at Stanford after his
arrival in 2006. While he was apply
ing to colleges, Quran hoped to pur
sue his interests in physics while
studying a subject that could help
him change the situation in Pales
tine. After consulting with friends
and teachers, he discovered that
Stanford was a place where he
could do both.
Life in California, however, was
vastly different from the one Quran
had in Palestine.
"I remember days during the
month-long curfews when I had to
help my family and neighbors get
bread," Quran said. The dichotomy
of those experiences and his life at
Stanford, a "land of milk and honey,"
was an important motivational tool.
"Seeing how challenging life ac
tually is for some people gives you
something to prepare for, to work

toward," he said.
Through classes and on-campus
activism, Quran quickly developed
his argumentative skills and ce
mented his place in the Stanford
community.
"One of the great things about
Stanford is that you can debate is
sues without the sense of fear that
might be created at other places,"
Quran said.
As a freshman, Quran became
an active participant in the debate

over whether Stanford should di
vest from companies allegedly as
sociated with the Israeli military
occupation of the West Bank. Tak
ing a strong stance on this contro
versial issue ensured his position at
the center of numerous campus de
bates. According to faculty mem
bers and peers, he always conduct
ed himself with restraint, open
mindedness and tolerance.

"Fadi [Quran] has an incredible
capacity to empathize with the per
spectives of others," said Allen
Weiner, senior lecturer in law, who
taught a conflict resolution semi
nar in which Quran was a student.
Weiner remembers moderating a
debate in one of his classes when
Quran came under substantial
pressure from students on the pro-
Israel side of the argument.
"What was really impressive
about Fadi was how committed he
was to finding areas of common
ground and mutual understanding,
while still being very staunch in his
defense of the interests of his com
munity," Weiner said.
Joe Gettinger 'll, who be
friended Quran at Stanford, ad
mired Quran's insistence on un
derstanding the other perspective
on the divestment issue, but said
he believes the most telling aspect
of Quran's character was his per
sonal efforts to bridge the gap be
tween communities.
"I remember he would come to
Shabbat dinner to get to know peo
ple and to learn about their per
spective," Gettinger said. "That re
ally said a lot because there was
very little to gain politically from
such a move, it was really about get
ting to know the community.That's
what makes Fadi so special."
Being at Stanford also taught
Quran important lessons in inno
vation and entrepreneurship that
he would later apply to his start-up
in alternative energy, Tayara Ener
gy. Running the business, which is
located in the West Bank, requires
Quran to tap into his interdiscipli
nary education, making use of his
skills as both a community organiz
er and a scientist. Quran sees the
start-up as one step toward fulfill
ing the goal of Palestinian self-suf
ficiency.
Currently, Tayara Energy's
major projects include designing a
high altitude wind generator to
provide electricity to rural com
munities, setting up programs to
train young people in proper recy
cling procedures to benefit refugee
camps and integrating affordable
solar panels into more construction
projects in the Middle East.
When Quran is not participating

in protests or running his company,
he studies constitutional law and
revolutions at Birzeit University in
Ramallah, where he is pursuing his
master's degree. Balancing ac
tivism, entrepreneurship and aca
demics can often present a heavy
load.
The way Quran sees it, though,
"it is not so much a question of bal
ancing as it is a question of integra
tion."
"A lot of the time at Stanford
you're taught to make compart
ments ... something I've learned is
that actually in most cases, I can in
tegrate everything together
through an interdisciplinary ap
proach," Quran said.
But that doesn't mean life isn't
full of stress for Quran. The day be
fore his interview with The Daily, a
friend of Quran's was arrested in
Bahrain. Quran spent an anxious
night worrying about the fate of his
friend and writing a paper due the
next day.
His community, he says, has be
come accustomed to arrests.
"There is always a sense of fear
and anxiousness when a family
member or friend is arrested," he
said. "Sometimes there is a fleeting
sense of despair, but it is not as raw
as the first time was."
Regarding the future, Quran is
cautiously optimistic, not only for
the Palestinians, but for the whole
region. All around him, he said, he
sees a new generation of Middle
Eastern youth focused on social
and business entrepreneurship. He
also sees young Arab academics in
unprecedented numbers pursuing
"science and truth."
All this, he believes, points to
ward a tipping point in the near fu
ture in which acts of nonviolence
generate more acts of nonviolence
until the Palestinian youth move
ment and others like it become full
fledged nonviolent uprisings.
"Then, we will achieve peace," he
said.

After graduating from Stanford, he
returned home to lead a nonviolent
youth resistance movement.
At its core, quantum
physics is a science of
probabilities. When
dealing with particle un
certainties and ambigu
ous dualities, a calculated likelihood
is the closest thing to certainty. Fadi
Quran 'lO believes there is a lesson
in this concept that can be applied to
his work in social activism.
"The paths that particles take
have multiple histories, each of
which you must add together in
order to predict the probabilities of
where the particles may land,"
Quran said. "In much the same way,
as a social activist, every time I try
and plan a strategy in advance, I take
all the possible scenarios on that
path and add them up to approxi
mate what needs to be done to
achieve the most successful result."
