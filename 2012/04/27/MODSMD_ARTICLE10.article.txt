## Study links anxiety with cancer progression 
### STEVEN SMALLBERG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Anxiety could be linked to the pro
gression of cancer, according to a new
study led by researchers at the Stanford
School of Medicine in which high-anxiety
mice showed accelerated cancer progres
sion compared to their more assured
peers.
"Even though we hypothesized this
before conducting our experiments, it was
still surprising to observe that a psycho
logical trait before any experimental
manipulation was associated with in
creased tumor progression weeks and
months later," said Firdaus Dhabhar, pro
fessor of psychiatry and behavioral sci
ences and the study's first author.
Employing controlled doses of ultravi
olet radiation to replicate the effects of re
peated sun exposure and thus prompt
the onset of skin cancer the study found
that high-anxiety mice developed more
numerous and more invasive tumors after
several months.
"The important advantage [of this re
search design] is that the model shows a
time course and pathology of tumors that
is very similar to that seen in people,"
Dhabhar said.
The mice's tendencies toward high- or
low-anxiety characteristics were meas
ured using ethological tests in which the
mice were presented with simultaneous,
conflicting motivations to explore and to
assure safety.

For example, in one test set, mice were
placed in an arena divided between light

and dark sectors. High-anxiety mice
would more often seek safety and conceal
ment by spending more time in the dark.
Precancerous lesions appeared in all
mice within weeks after the light exposure,
and tumors developed within months.
Only high-anxiety mice developed inva
sive cancer.
"[High-anxiety individuals] are likelier
to mount larger and longer biological
stress responses to a given stressor,"
Dhabhar said, noting that the results were
similar to previous studies in which exter
nal chronic stressors were introduced.
"Moreover, a high-anxiety individual
may mount a response in some situations
where a low-anxiety individual might not
respond at all," Dhabhar added.
The accelerated tumor proliferation
and invasiveness in the high-anxiety mice
can be linked to a variety of biological
markers, such as increased levels of the
stress hormone corticosterone, a lack of
immune cells involved in protecting
against skin cancer and even the produc
tion of cells that suppress protective im
munity.
While the harmful effect of chronic
stress on immune function is well-docu
mented, the study is the first to connect
cancer progression to the psychological
tendency for anxiety. In the future, Dhab
har and the team intend to expand their
research to examine how this relationship
translates to humans.
"I believe that the critical connection
between mind and body needs to be fur
ther investigated using the tools, tech
niques and language of modern science,"

Dhabhar said. "Doing this will make the
mind-body connection better understood
and more widely accepted and, [more] im
portantly, make it possible for doctors and
patients to work with and harness this con
nection in ways that would help people."
With an accurate model in place, Dhab
har said that he anticipates the study's
findings and implications to be utilized in
new medical approaches to cancer thera
py-
"The bottom line is that following up
these studies and their applicability to hu
mans will require a significant amount of
systematic effort," he said. "However, that
is the nature of science, and it is very well
worth doing if there is a reasonable chance
that it will help those who are ill."
Dhabhar cited drugs and cognitive-be
havioral approaches as potentially being
capable of ameliorating the effects of anx
iety on cancer progression, though he
stressed the need for careful research and
pharmaceutical development to safeguard
against counterproductive interactions
between cancer drugs and antidepres
sants.
"It's bad enough that cancer diagnosis
and treatment generate stress and anxiety,
but this study shows that anxiety and stress
can accelerate cancer progression, thus
perpetuating a vicious cycle," Dhabhar
said. "The goal is to try to ameliorate or
eliminate the effects of anxiety and chron
ic stress especially at the time of cancer di
agnosis and during treatment."
