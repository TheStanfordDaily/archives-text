## EDITORIAL Five things that every Pro Fro should know 
### 
Welcome, ProFros! We
hope that Admit Week
end gives you some idea
of the incredible opportunities
available here at Stanford.
Whether you're a budding public
servant, student-athlete, entre
preneur, artist, scientist, a combi
nation of the above, or something
else entirely, you'll find a home
here at the Farm (that especially
includes those of you who are res
olutely undecided). Flowever,
we'd like to share some important
perspective to keep in mind over
the course of this weekend. Below
are five things we wish we knew as
ProFros:

1. The people you meet at Admit
Weekend will most likely not be
your best friends at Stanford
and that's OK. Some Stanford
students remain close with the
people they meet at Admit Week
end, but they're frankly in the mi
nority. So don't fret if you don't
make a lifelong friendship during
the three days you spend here.
That said, there's nothing wrong
with engaging in conversations
that go beyond the typical
"name/hometown/prospective
major/excitement about Stan
ford" cycle.
2. Check out community centers,
regardless of your background.
Events at community centers can
open your eyes to new perspec
tives, critical frameworks and
friendships, and they offer some
of the richest programming that
Stanford has to offer. This week
alone various community centers
hosted a lunch on women in the
2012 elections, a discussion with
Jewish political theorist Michael
Walzer and a lecture by activist
Angela Davis. Moreover, the ex
change of ideas and experiences
that community centers promote
is fundamental to the spirit of ed
ucational inquiry.
3. Despite appearances, Stanford
is a richly intellectual place. Dur
ing Admit Weekend, it's easy to
get caught up in the beautiful

weather, wealth of opportunities
and laid-back culture. Don't get
us wrong Stanford students
know how to have fun, but we also
know that we are here in large
part because we like to learn.
Every Frisbee-throwing, bro
tank-wearing, fountain-hopping
student you see has spent hours
poring over a reading list in Green
Library or struggling with a bug in
a computer program. Academic
learning doesn't solely come from
classes, either. Your future class
mates will forever surprise you
with what they are passionate
about, and speaker events or de
bates are a great way to round out
your learning in a non-classroom
setting.

4. Admit Weekend is an introduc
tion, not a representation. If you
feel overwhelmed by the relent
less energy and packed schedule,
don't worry. To get a more accu
rate picture of campus, skip some
of the programming and walk
around campus. Your life at Stan
ford may be structured around
classes and activities, but what's
infinitely more important are the
chance run-ins, late night discus
sions in dorm hallways and spon
taneous journeys that you will
embark upon as a student here.
Our hope is that you seek out
those experiences during your
short introductory stay this week
end.

5. Finally, the decision on whether
to come to Stanford is yours and
yours alone. No matter the enthu
siasm of your RoHo, HoHos, and
fellow ProFros, you're allowed to
have doubts and questions about
life at Stanford. Your admission is
an enormous accomplishment,
and you have a great deal to be
proud of. We hope you come to
Stanford, but if and when you
make that decision, do so because
it's what you want, not because it's
what you think you should want.
We hope you have had a great ex
perience so far, and we wish you
the best of luck at whatever
school you end up attending.
