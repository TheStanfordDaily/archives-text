## Winning the heart and mind â€“ of your professor 
### Miriam Marks 
If you are reading this on Friday,
the Stanford campus will be
swarming with hundreds of ad
mitted students. For 48 hours,
these bright-eyed, bushy-tailed
seniors in high school will be told
that Stanford professors are one
of the greatest aspects of this Uni
versity, along with the weather and
cool buildings.
And they will be told to forge
connections with these professors.
Befriending a professor is no
easy task, but it does come in
handy. For one thing, a good rela
tionship with your professor
makes it easier to get that prized
recommendation letter. How do
you think those lucky few students
managed to get a Rhodes Scholar
ship? You guessed it: five to eight
letters of recommendation.
After five years of everything
from huge lectures to medium
sized seminars and three-person
classes, I've seen my fair share of
professors and the students who
successfully charm them. There
are several key strategies. Adopt
them, and you can't go wrong.
The first strategy: sit as close to
the professor as possible. Are you
in a 15-person seminar? Sit by the
head of the table. But be warned
that, in a large lecture hall, this act
will make you the "front-row kid,"
and not everyone loves the front
row kid. The front-row kid is often
inquisitive, talkative and too eager
to display his or her accumulated
knowledge.
However, there is a reason for

this front-row kid's confidence.
When you're in the front row, your
entire field of vision consists of the
professor. You know how that spe
cial someone makes you feel like
you're the only person in the
room? That's what it feels like to
sit in the front row. Stare at your
professor and do not look away.
As far as you're concerned, that
professor is lecturing just to you.
The professor will inevitably
notice you. Between staring at
PowerPoint slides and notes, the
professor will inevitably cast his or
her eyes into the audience. The
kids in the front are less likely to
be asleep, talking to a friend or
texting.
Now that you've sat in the front
row, your professor sees you.
Good work. The next step is to be
receptive to whatever your profes
sor says. Nod knowingly if the pro
fessor says something that begs a
sign of agreement. Just be careful
not to nod too much you'll look
like a bobble head.
Most importantly: laugh at any
jokes. Some professors choose
their favorite students with
