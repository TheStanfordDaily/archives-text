# MARKS MY WORDS
## Winning the heart and mind â€“ of your professor 
### Miriam Marks 
If you are reading this on Friday,
the Stanford campus will be
swarming with hundreds of ad
mitted students. For 48 hours,
these bright-eyed, bushy-tailed
seniors in high school will be told
that Stanford professors are one
of the greatest aspects of this Uni
versity, along with the weather and
cool buildings.
And they will be told to forge
connections with these professors.
Befriending a professor is no
easy task, but it does come in
handy. For one thing, a good rela
tionship with your professor
makes it easier to get that prized
recommendation letter. How do
you think those lucky few students
managed to get a Rhodes Scholar
ship? You guessed it: five to eight
letters of recommendation.
After five years of everything
from huge lectures to medium
sized seminars and three-person
classes, I've seen my fair share of
professors and the students who
successfully charm them. There
are several key strategies. Adopt
them, and you can't go wrong.
The first strategy: sit as close to
the professor as possible. Are you
in a 15-person seminar? Sit by the
head of the table. But be warned
that, in a large lecture hall, this act
will make you the "front-row kid,"
and not everyone loves the front
row kid. The front-row kid is often
inquisitive, talkative and too eager
to display his or her accumulated
knowledge.
However, there is a reason for

this front-row kid's confidence.
When you're in the front row, your
entire field of vision consists of the
professor. You know how that spe
cial someone makes you feel like
you're the only person in the
room? That's what it feels like to
sit in the front row. Stare at your
professor and do not look away.
As far as you're concerned, that
professor is lecturing just to you.
The professor will inevitably
notice you. Between staring at
PowerPoint slides and notes, the
professor will inevitably cast his or
her eyes into the audience. The
kids in the front are less likely to
be asleep, talking to a friend or
texting.
Now that you've sat in the front
row, your professor sees you.
Good work. The next step is to be
receptive to whatever your profes
sor says. Nod knowingly if the pro
fessor says something that begs a
sign of agreement. Just be careful
not to nod too much you'll look
like a bobble head.
Most importantly: laugh at any
jokes. Some professors choose
their favorite students with

humor. If your professor cracks a
joke, don't be shy in acknowledg
ing it with a smile or quiet chuckle.
Sometimes, the joke won't be very
obvious. Was that a joke or a sign
of genuine bitterness at not get
ting tenure?

Occasionally you will laugh in
error. Your professor will dismiss
you as a little strange and prompt

ly forget about it. But a shared
laughing moment will live long in
your professor's memory, so it's
worth taking the risk. Laugh
freely.

At this point in time, you and
your professor have shared eye
contact, smiles and hopefully
laughter. And yet, your relation
ship can progress no further under
the watchful eyes of other stu
dents. It's time for some one-on
one time. It's time for office hours.
Don't waltz into office hours
without a plan. Prepare some top
ics of discussion and a few

thoughtful questions. Most impor
tantly, ask your professor about
his or her career first don't for
get that your professor is a lot
more accomplished than you. He
or she doesn't care that you were
in mock trial in high school or that
you've been to China once.
Rather, this is the time for you
to show that you are interested in
your professor. You have to be ag
gressive. This professor is being
courted by several or dozens or
even hundreds of other stu
dents. At the same time, be gen
uine. Some professors can sniff

out the students who are faking it.
Does this sound familiar? The
whole process is a bit like The
Bachelor(ette). You are engaged
in a struggle to woo a central fig
ure. You must differentiate your
self from the pack without com
promising your dignity. You must
also preserve your relationship
with the other students in the
class. The seminar can't deterio
rate into insults and hair-pulling
(okay, maybe that's just in The
Bachelor).

In the end, much like in The
Bachelor, only one person walks

away with the ultimate letter of
recommendation and, obviously,
the lasting emotional connection.
And much like the successful rela
tionships that emerge from The
Bachelor, it helps when you're not
motivated by the material reward.
It helps when you seek a good re
lationship purely for its inherent
value. And your professor will be
able to tell.

especially if you're one of her pro
fessors.

row kid. The front-row kid is often
inquisitive, talkative and too eager
to display his or her accumulated
knowledge.
However, there is a reason for

this front-row kid's confidence.
When you're in the front row, your
entire field of vision consists of the
professor. You know how that spe
cial someone makes you feel like
you're the only person in the
room? That's what it feels like to
sit in the front row. Stare at your
professor and do not look away.
As far as you're concerned, that
professor is lecturing just to you.
The professor will inevitably
notice you. Between staring at
PowerPoint slides and notes, the
professor will inevitably cast his or
her eyes into the audience. The
kids in the front are less likely to
be asleep, talking to a friend or
texting.
Now that you've sat in the front
row, your professor sees you.
Good work. The next step is to be
receptive to whatever your profes
sor says. Nod knowingly if the pro
fessor says something that begs a
sign of agreement. Just be careful
not to nod too much you'll look
like a bobble head.
Most importantly: laugh at any
jokes. Some professors choose
their favorite students with

humor. If your professor cracks a
joke, don't be shy in acknowledg
ing it with a smile or quiet chuckle.
Sometimes, the joke won't be very
obvious. Was that a joke or a sign
of genuine bitterness at not get
ting tenure?

Occasionally you will laugh in
error. Your professor will dismiss
you as a little strange and prompt

ly forget about it. But a shared
laughing moment will live long in
your professor's memory, so it's
worth taking the risk. Laugh
freely.

At this point in time, you and
your professor have shared eye
contact, smiles and hopefully
laughter. And yet, your relation
ship can progress no further under
the watchful eyes of other stu
dents. It's time for some one-on
one time. It's time for office hours.
Don't waltz into office hours
without a plan. Prepare some top
ics of discussion and a few

thoughtful questions. Most impor
tantly, ask your professor about
his or her career first don't for
get that your professor is a lot
more accomplished than you. He
or she doesn't care that you were
in mock trial in high school or that
you've been to China once.
Rather, this is the time for you
to show that you are interested in
your professor. You have to be ag
gressive. This professor is being
courted by several or dozens or
even hundreds of other stu
dents. At the same time, be gen
uine. Some professors can sniff

out the students who are faking it.
Does this sound familiar? The
whole process is a bit like The
Bachelor(ette). You are engaged
in a struggle to woo a central fig
ure. You must differentiate your
self from the pack without com
promising your dignity. You must
also preserve your relationship
with the other students in the
class. The seminar can't deterio
rate into insults and hair-pulling
(okay, maybe that's just in The
Bachelor).

In the end, much like in The
Bachelor, only one person walks

away with the ultimate letter of
recommendation and, obviously,
the lasting emotional connection.
And much like the successful rela
tionships that emerge from The
Bachelor, it helps when you're not
motivated by the material reward.
It helps when you seek a good re
lationship purely for its inherent
value. And your professor will be
able to tell.

If you are reading this on Friday,
the Stanford campus will be
swarming with hundreds of ad
mitted students. For 48 hours,
these bright-eyed, bushy-tailed
seniors in high school will be told
that Stanford professors are one
of the greatest aspects of this Uni
versity, along with the weather and
cool buildings.
And they will be told to forge
connections with these professors.
Befriending a professor is no
easy task, but it does come in
handy. For one thing, a good rela
tionship with your professor
makes it easier to get that prized
recommendation letter. How do
you think those lucky few students
managed to get a Rhodes Scholar
ship? You guessed it: five to eight
letters of recommendation.
After five years of everything
from huge lectures to medium
sized seminars and three-person
classes, I've seen my fair share of
professors and the students who
successfully charm them. There
are several key strategies. Adopt
them, and you can't go wrong.
The first strategy: sit as close to
the professor as possible. Are you
in a 15-person seminar? Sit by the
head of the table. But be warned
that, in a large lecture hall, this act
will make you the "front-row kid,"
and not everyone loves the front
row kid. The front-row kid is often
inquisitive, talkative and too eager
to display his or her accumulated
knowledge.
