## Stanford's silence on suicide is wrong 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE' 14 Deputy Editor, The Stanford Daily 
Last week, a Yale freshman
named Zach Brunt killed
himself in a physics lab on
campus. The next day, a candlelight
vigil was held in front of his resi
dence. Yale's Dean of Students
sent a campus-wide email address
ing the death within 24 hours, and
alerted students to available men
tal health resources.
Last Saturday, a Harvard senior
named Wendy Chang hanged her
self in her room. That same day, a
vigil was held inside her residence.
That same day, the Dean of Har
vard College sent a campus-wide
email alerting students to the
tragedy.
A month ago, Stanford sopho
more Samantha Wopat killed her
self in her campus residence. The
silence from University officials
was deafening.
I recognize that suicide is a dif
ficult thing to discuss, especially on
a college campus. It affects us all in
different ways, and privacy restric
tions at times restrain University
action.
However, nothing can excuse a
weeklong silence about a student's
death, broken only by a short op-

Ed in our pages. Additionally, no
administrator has addressed cam
pus about suicide. The University's
failure to foster a campus dialogue
about mental health or mental ill
ness is appalling.
Should we not speak openly
about suicide and mental illness?
Is acknowledging your students
aren't always healthy a bad thing?
Does Stanford truly believe that
an event like this, which impacts so
many students on so many levels,
shouldn't be addressed directly
and honestly?
What Harvard and Yale appear
to recognize - and what for some
reason Stanford seems incapable
of realizing - is that students will
talk about suicide. Stanford's job is
to make that conversation safe,
open and informed by campus re
sources and mental health profes
sionals. Their job is to make sure
we know that they are there for us
if we need them. Following a sui
cide of a fellow student, we needed
them. They weren't there.
At Yale 's campus vigil, the head
of Zach's residence hall told stu
dents that Zach's death should re
mind them, "We don't live in a per

feet world." That's an important
message. Those are the words of a
leader who wants his students to
know it is normal to struggle and
feel overwhelmed in the face of
immeasurable tragedy, even if they
happen to also attend a "dream
school."
I fear Stanford's unwillingness
or inability to convey a similar
message will only contribute to the
silence that too often surrounds
mental health problems and men
tal illness on this campus. Why did
it take them a week to reach out to
us? Why was there no meaningful,
campus-wide response? Why did
our peer institutions handle this in
such a drastically different way?
Tragedies such as these often
raise hard, unanswerable ques
tions. The lack of university re
sponse shouldn't raise more. I
know Stanford works hard to
make this an exceptional universi
ty to attend. But sometimes, ac
knowledging this is not a perfect
world can be an important step to
ward improving it.
