# EXISTENTIAL FORTUNE COOKIES
## Finding happiness 
### Sebastain Gould 
The question most pressing
for prospective Stanford stu
dents is whether or not they
should attend Stanford University.
After they have made the decision,
with an appropriate amount of
misgivings, they will no longer be
bothered by that decision. I whole
heartedly endorse Stanford Uni
versity and encourage everyone
who has been accepted to come
here; at the same time, I can under
stand those who may think that
they would be happier elsewhere.
I am here to tell you that finding
happiness isn't easy. It is not a sim
ple matter of making a checklist of
to-dos and then completing them
as your happiness grows. Finding
happiness requires an unspecified
mixture of friends, family and ac
tivities. All of us have personal
preferences; we enjoy some things
more than others. One of the great
things about Stanford is that there
is such variety in the number of
group activities available. While
your interests may not be immedi
ately obvious or analogous to any
of the groups that already exist on
campus, you will probably find
some that are similar enough that
you can take an interest in them; of
course, if you do not find any that
are suitable, you can always create
your own voluntary student organ
ization. I personally enjoy reading,
writing, and playing video games,
all of which are solitary activities. I

also am a member of FLIP, the
First-Generation Low Income
Partnership, which exists to help
undergraduates who identify as
FLIP, and am involved in the Mili
tary Service as Public Service proj
ect at the Flaas Center for Public
Service, which supports veterans
of war and their friends and family
on campus. I found these initiatives
fairly late in my career at Stanford
simply because I was not looking
for them.
I hope this column can serve as
a warning to all of my readers, not
just the prospective freshmen.
Keep looking for things that make
you happy. Keep seeking out new
friends that will add to your
knowledge about the world. Seek
out people who will challenge
your assumptions about others,
and engage them in conversation
about what makes them unique.
Build an environment in which
you test who you are as a person.
The journey itself will be difficult
and fraught with moments where
you doubt whether or not there is
value in going beyond your com
fort zone, but in the end it will be
worth it. Only when you truly
know who you are can you be real
ly happy. After all, how will you
know what makes you happy un
less you know who you are? And
how can you know who you are
unless you constantly test yourself
to understand what you believe

and think? Finding happiness can
be elusive at times, but not impos
sible.

Stanford has a huge body of
students and staff and faculty who
care a great deal about each other.
Finding those individuals is as sim
ple as looking for them; and once
you do, you will be in a supportive
and enriching environment where
you can flourish. One such fresh
man experience is SLE, Struc
tured Liberal Education. I chose
to do SLE my freshman year be
cause I always wished that I could
read the Classics with engaging
peers. At Stanford I found that,
and now Mark Mancall, the cre
ator of the program, is my person
al mentor. When you come to
Stanford, find things that you
think you will enjoy and try them.
It's okay to make mistakes in
fact, I encourage it.
The engaging faculty, sunny
weather and amazing opportuni
ties to explore and succeed in the
world all await you and I say
this to both the prospective fresh
man and the students already here.
Go out and find greater happiness.
