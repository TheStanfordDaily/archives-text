## Chi Theta Chi: Father to daughter 
### NATHALIE TREPAGNIER' 11 Former Chi Theta Chi resident 
Growing up, I'd listen to my
father's stories about
Stanford while we worked
in the yard together, the tape
deck playing blues music. My
dad, Hardoncourt "Trip" Trepag
nier (Statistics '77), followed his
older brother to Stanford, leaving
Delaware for palm trees and sun
shine. When he changed majors,
he took advantage of Stanford's
generous leave of absence policy.
He stopped out to work as a me

chanic and ski bum for a year.
When my dad returned in
1975, Chi Theta Chi was one of
the few dorms open during sum
mer quarter. He completed a few
essential course credits, and
graduated without taking addi
tional quarters. My dad would
often remind me about his intro
duction to blues music by
playing pool with his friends at
Chi Theta Chi, in a room over
looking Campus Drive and

Hoover Tower.
I drew into Chi Theta Chi my
sophomore year and lucked into
the best double on campus the
Pool Room. When I called my
dad up to tell him, we realized
that this was the same room
where he discovered his love for
blues. The view of Hoover Tower
is now blocked by Munger Resi
dences, and the pool table is
downstairs, but in that room I
could feel the presence of Chi
Theta Chi past.
After my sophomore and jun
ior years I worked for Stanford's
Conference Services. More than
200 camps and conferences are
held at Stanford, with over
18,000 youths visiting through
academic and athletic camps. It's
easy for students to feel like
strangers on campus, lost in a
crowd of middle and high school
age campers.

I recognize the importance of
these conferences the camps
create jobs and help offset stu
dent room and board fees. How
ever, there are few housing op
tions for students staying the
summer at Stanford. Students are
either locked into an expensive
dining plan at a residence hall, or
they live in Mirrielees apart
ments. I spent my junior year at
Mirrielees after returning from
Oxford, and while it offers inde
pendence, there is no community.
I never met my neighbors, or even
my Residential Assistant.
Chi Theta Chi is the only co-op
open during the summer. As a
Conference Services employee I
earned a free room, and I could
access a kitchenette near my
dorm. But I didn't want to buy a
full set of kitchen equipment, and
I didn't have a car to drive to the
grocery store.

Some of my coworkers ate out
for most meals, and others spent
more than $1,500 on a dining
plan. Instead, I paid Chi Theta Chi
$7OO to be an Eating Associate,
joining one cooking or cleaning
crew each week. I attended every
dinner, and accessed the open
kitchen for other meals. But more

importantly it gave me a commu
nity of fellow students: I biked to
Chi Theta Chi before my shift, en
joying a bagel, coffee and great
conversation in the dining room.
In the evening I would watch
movies in the courtyard, and I
spent my days off with residents
on hiking trips. Were it not for Chi
Theta Chi, I would have spent two
summers lonely and broke. In
stead, I was rich with friends.
My senior year I returned as a
manager the Alumni Liaison. I
organized an Alumni Barbecue
that was attended by more than
50 alumni. A dozen men came
from the Class of 1960, who lived
in Theta Chi when it was fraterni
ty. Listening to their stories
how they packed twice as many
students into the house, in bunk
beds on a screened-in porch
was the highlight of that week
end. One frat brother wrote to me
afterward, "I think it's wonderful
to see how you are all managing
the house! And I'd like to move
in and stay there forever!"
If Chi Theta Chi's lease is ter
minated, it won't be open year
round to students instead, it
will house conferees over the
summer. The alumni board will
no longer lend its wisdom, histo
ry, and support. Manager posi
tions unique to Chi Theta Chi
including the Fix-It Manager,
Capital Improvements Manager
and Alumni Liaison will be
terminated.
Should the University revoke
Chi Theta Chi's lease, my opinion
of Stanford will change forever. I
would not feel right supporting
an institution that puts revenue
before the needs of students. To
ignore the outcry from alumni,
friends and faculty would be a
betrayal to Stanford students
of the past, present, and future.
