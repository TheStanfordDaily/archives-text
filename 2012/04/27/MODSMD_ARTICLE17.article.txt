## Editorial Board demonstrates fear 
### HOLLY FETTER'13 ASSU Chair of Communities 
As the director of the Com
munity Action Board's re
sponse to the Study of Un
dergraduate Education at Stan
ford (SUES) report, I appreciate
that The Daily Editorial Board in
vested time and energy into en
gaging with our letter. However, I
was disappointed by their conclu
sions.

I take issue with several points
raised by the five members of the
Editorial Board. Infusing the
Stanford curriculum with discus
sions of identity and privilege is
NOT akin to promoting an
"overemphasis on creating agents
of social change." Rather, it is
about acknowledging and under
standing the complicated histories
and identities of underrepresent
ed students at Stanford. Nor is this
issue about "transforming some
Stanford courses into sites of so
cial and political activism." In
stead, it's about recognizing that
the history, stories, and struggles of
minority-identified students are
part of the dominant bodies of
knowledge that we perceive as
normative in this institution. All
that we the 21 student groups,
the ASSU Executive and the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
that signed the letter are asking
is that minority students see them
selves reflected in the academy
without being called "activists.
I imagine that many critics of
our response to the SUES report
do not understand the feeling of
being excluded from the syllabus
in every course they take. Some
times, it's not about rational ex
pressions of racism, sexism, etc.
it's about the subtle, emotional ex
periences of being the victim of

these destructive "-isms" without
having a rational, articulate
method of describing what one
feels. Imagine taking a literature
course where you can't relate to
any of the texts, because the au
thors are all of a different race and
gender. Or a course about U.S. his
tory where the history of your gen
der or ethnic identity is limited to
one lecture. In the words of Dr.
Angela Davis, "The history of peo
ple of African descent is the histo
ry of the United States." Histories
of minority peoples in the U.S. are
central, not peripheral to, what
most students think of as "nor
mal" American history. Not to
mention that major programs that
do engage issues of identity and
power (like Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity) are often
derided and seen as "easy" majors.
The histories, identities, and inter
ests of minority students are de
valued by the current academic
structure.

Furthermore, the Editorial
Board writes that it, "values cours
es that may have nothing to do
with social issues." The truth is,
every course has something to do
with social issues. Income inequal
ity in the U.S. is clearly connected
to race. So why shouldn't there be
more economics classes about it?
When engineers study Hurricane
Katrina, they should look beyond
the levees, and toward the history
of failed engineering projects and
urban planning policies that pri
marily affect low-income resi
dents of New Orleans. Identity is
not something to be relegated to
one major or course. These ques
tions of identity, privilege, and in
equality are integral to scholar

ship in a variety of fields.
Finally, I want to address what I
believe is the crux of the Editorial
Board's piece: fear. The fear of
being ignorant, overwhelmed and
outnumbered. The authors write
that, "A view of liberal arts educa
tion in which courses should be
come training grounds for social
activism threatens to marginalize
thinkers who fail to engage in so
cially relevant questions or who
present less tolerant views on
women, minorities and privilege."
The Community Action Board
and its supporters are not asking
for courses that make some stu
dents feel attacked and marginal
ized. We are asking those students
to appreciate the historical experi
ence of feeling attacked and mar
ginalized through exposing them
selves to courses that deal with is
sues of identity and privilege. As a
White student who knows the
total awkwardness of taking a
class on African American history
for the first time, I ask you to em
brace the feeling of ignorance and
discomfort. Yes, others in the class
might know more than you about
the topic. Yes, you might feel terri
fied of "saying the wrong thing."
But you will find that these classes
increase your own comfort with
your privileged identity, and make
you a more empathetic and edu
cated friend, scholar and leader.
Increasing the courses that in
corporate identity and privilege
into their syllabi is not a radical act
it is one that allows all Stanford
students truly equal access to this
university.

increase your own comfort with
your privileged identity, and make
you a more empathetic and edu

Increasing the courses that in

into their syllabi is not a radical act
it is one that allows all Stanford
students truly equal access to this
university.
As the director of the Com
munity Action Board's re
sponse to the Study of Un
dergraduate Education at Stan
ford (SUES) report, I appreciate
that The Daily Editorial Board in
vested time and energy into en
gaging with our letter. However, I
was disappointed by their conclu
sions.

I take issue with several points
raised by the five members of the
Editorial Board. Infusing the
Stanford curriculum with discus
sions of identity and privilege is
NOT akin to promoting an
"overemphasis on creating agents
of social change." Rather, it is
about acknowledging and under
standing the complicated histories
and identities of underrepresent
ed students at Stanford. Nor is this
issue about "transforming some
Stanford courses into sites of so
cial and political activism." In
stead, it's about recognizing that
the history, stories, and struggles of
minority-identified students are
part of the dominant bodies of
knowledge that we perceive as
normative in this institution. All
that we the 21 student groups,
the ASSU Executive and the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
that signed the letter are asking
is that minority students see them
selves reflected in the academy
without being called "activists.
I imagine that many critics of
our response to the SUES report
do not understand the feeling of
being excluded from the syllabus
in every course they take. Some
times, it's not about rational ex
pressions of racism, sexism, etc.
it's about the subtle, emotional ex
periences of being the victim of

these destructive "-isms" without
having a rational, articulate
method of describing what one
feels. Imagine taking a literature
course where you can't relate to
any of the texts, because the au
thors are all of a different race and
gender. Or a course about U.S. his
tory where the history of your gen
der or ethnic identity is limited to
one lecture. In the words of Dr.
Angela Davis, "The history of peo
ple of African descent is the histo
ry of the United States." Histories
of minority peoples in the U.S. are
central, not peripheral to, what
most students think of as "nor
mal" American history. Not to
mention that major programs that
do engage issues of identity and
power (like Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity) are often
derided and seen as "easy" majors.
The histories, identities, and inter
ests of minority students are de
valued by the current academic
structure.

Furthermore, the Editorial
Board writes that it, "values cours
es that may have nothing to do
with social issues." The truth is,
every course has something to do
with social issues. Income inequal
ity in the U.S. is clearly connected
to race. So why shouldn't there be
more economics classes about it?
When engineers study Hurricane
Katrina, they should look beyond
the levees, and toward the history
of failed engineering projects and
urban planning policies that pri
marily affect low-income resi
dents of New Orleans. Identity is
not something to be relegated to
one major or course. These ques
tions of identity, privilege, and in
equality are integral to scholar

ship in a variety of fields.
Finally, I want to address what I
believe is the crux of the Editorial
Board's piece: fear. The fear of
being ignorant, overwhelmed and
outnumbered. The authors write
that, "A view of liberal arts educa
tion in which courses should be
come training grounds for social
activism threatens to marginalize
thinkers who fail to engage in so
cially relevant questions or who
present less tolerant views on
women, minorities and privilege."
The Community Action Board
and its supporters are not asking
for courses that make some stu
dents feel attacked and marginal
ized. We are asking those students
to appreciate the historical experi
ence of feeling attacked and mar
ginalized through exposing them
selves to courses that deal with is
sues of identity and privilege. As a
White student who knows the
total awkwardness of taking a
class on African American history
for the first time, I ask you to em
brace the feeling of ignorance and
discomfort. Yes, others in the class
might know more than you about
the topic. Yes, you might feel terri
fied of "saying the wrong thing."
But you will find that these classes
increase your own comfort with
your privileged identity, and make
you a more empathetic and edu
cated friend, scholar and leader.
Increasing the courses that in
corporate identity and privilege
into their syllabi is not a radical act
it is one that allows all Stanford
students truly equal access to this
university.
