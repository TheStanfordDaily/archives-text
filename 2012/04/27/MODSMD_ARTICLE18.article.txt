# OP-ED
## Regarding gender equality in 'Stanford 2020: Visions of Tomorrow' 
### ADAM ADLER' 12 Stanford 2020 co-chair 
This year, I organized the
Stanford 2020: Visions of
Tomorrow Symposium. The
event, which I first organized and
co-founded last year, gives seven
of Stanford's top faculty the op
portunity to make informative
presentations about their re
search, why it matters, and where
it is going. Like last year, this
year's symposium was an unqual
ified success. The event venue was
filled to maximum capacity (with
over 200 attendees), our speakers
were nothing short of awe-inspir
ing, and the attendees left happy
and intellectually satisfied.
In the days leading up to the
event, I received numerous con
cerns about our speakers. They
were all male. These concerns
reached their high point a few
days ago, when I was accused in
an op-ed in The Daily of not valu
ing gender diversity ("Visions of
Tomorrow: Academia still a boys'
club," April 26).
Nothing could be further from
the truth. In planning Stanford
2020, I, along with my co-chair.

Philip Bui 'll, reached out to six
female faculty members (this rep
resents over 1/5 of the professors
we contacted, a number on par
with the female-male faculty
ratio at Stanford). Of the six,
three replied. Two of the three
were previously engaged, and
one agreed to participate. But,
like the best laid plans of mice
and men (and women, where ap
plicable), event planning does not
always go as expected. Roughly
one week before the event, we re
ceived an e-mail from the female
faculty member who, because of a
conflicting event, had to step
down. With less than one week to
go, what were we to do? Cancel
the event? The venue had already
been booked and professors had
planned other engagements
around us. Contact a female pro
fessor and tell her that we needed
a token woman on the panel and
that, with less than one week of
notice, she should prepare a pres
entation? That is certainly not
considerate.

Event planning is and should

be organic and flexible. When
planning the event, Philip and I
reached out to professors, both
men and women, who we knew,
through personal experience,
would engage our audience. It so
happened that the ratio of fe
male-male faculty members we
reached out to was pretty close to
the ratio present among Univer
sity faculty. It also so happened
that this year seven men and one
woman agreed to participate in
our event, while last year, two
women agreed to speak, one of
which was a professor of gender
studies. There was no discrimina
tion, nor was there a lack of con
sideration towards women facul
ty members. Instead, there was
thoughtful planning that, when
executed, led to a fantastic event.

The goal of Stanford 2020 was
not to illuminate gender dispari
ty. But it so happens that we now
have the opportunity to discuss

this important issue. While
women outperform men at most
undergraduate institutions, there
is still a sizable gender gap when
it comes to professorships. Per
haps more problematic is that be
cause there are fewer women in
academia, and because universi
ties have an interest in promoting
the visibility of their women fac
ulty, women professors receive
more service and outreach re
quests (like Stanford 2020) than
their male counterparts. Ironical
ly, these service activities leads to
a substantial decrease in the
amount of time women have to
spend on research, which hinders,
rather than helps, their prospects
of advancement. This does not
mean women faculty members
should not be invited to events
like Stanford 2020. Instead, it
means we should recognize that
the solution to gender disparity at
the university level is not as sim

pie as we would like it to be in
stead, the solution requires deep
thought, careful consideration,
and a true understanding of the
problem.
I am a member of the Class of
2012, and my Stanford career is
approaching its end. While I am
about to move on, it is my hope
that the Stanford community will
continue to work towards a solu
tion to the gender gap here and at
other universities. Philip and I
saw an opportunity to make a dif
ference with our symposium, and
we did. But we aren't unique
any Stanford student can make a
difference. It is easy to get fund
ing for a summit, or a symposium,
or a VSO, or a whatever. Stanford
is an amazing place, but with ef
fort, initiative, and energy, we can
make it even better.
