## KEEPING PACE CARD SET TO SQUARE OFF AGAINST UCLA 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Things seem to be clicking for the No. 9
Stanford baseball team at just the right time,
with a key Pac-12 series against No. 11
UCLA (27-10, 11-7) in Westwood, Calif,
kicking off tonight.
Going a perfect 4-0 and scoring at least
eight runs in all four of its games this week,

Stanford's bats finally seem to be coming to
gether again with five weekends of confer
ence play remaining. But it hasn't been pre
season Ail-American juniors Kenny
Diekroeger and Stephen Piscotty leading
the charge; instead, the Cardinal (26-10,8-7
Pac-12) has been getting much of its produc
tion from players who have been making
some of their first starts of the season due to
injuries to centerfielder Jake Stewart and

shortstop Lonnie Kauppila.
"Those younger players have really
worked hard and weren't starting to begin
with, but they've gotten the opportunity,"
said head coach Mark Marquess. "We've
needed them, and they've come up big for
us, so that's huge."
Though neither Danny Diekroeger nor
Brett Michael Doran has more than 30 at
bats on the season, the two sophomores cur
rently lead the team with their respective
.429 and .375 batting averages, with fresh
man Alex Blandino not far behind at .328.
Nine of the Cardinal's 10 runs in the squad's
nailbiter of a win over BYU on Friday were
driven in by underclassmen.
Sophomore rightfielder Austin Wilson
led the charge with five RBI, including a
line-drive solo homer, and says that the
team's discipline at the plate has been a
major contributor to its recent success.
"We've been seeing the ball very well, I'd
have to say, cutting our strikeouts down,"
Wilson said. "[lf we] just keep on doing that,
don't go out of the zone, don't chase pitches,
and just be able to get our pitch and don't
miss it, I think we'll be fine."
On the other hand, the Bruins' strength
is in their upperclassmen, with catcher
Tyler Heineman hitting an impressive .405
and four other juniors batting .346 or better.
That's a far cry from last season's UCLA
squad, which had just two starters hitting
above .300 and relied on the likes of righties
Gerrit Cole and Trevor Bauer chosen
first and third in last year's MLB draft, re
spectively to bring in wins.
Stanford topped that Bruin team in a
whirlwind series at Sunken Diamond a year
ago, taking the rubber game with a four-run,
two-out rally in the bottom of the ninth.
And UCLA's pitching staff isn't quite the
imposing force it was in 2010, with its 2.44
ERA from last season up almost a full point.
The Bruins' all-sophomore rotation of
righties Adam Plutko, Nick Vander Tuig and
Zach Weiss is untested and could be exploit
ed by Stanford's top-tier hitters.
Tliat bodes well for the Cardinal, espe
cially given the Bruins' struggles in a series
loss at No. 21 Oregon State last weekend.
But UCLA is in second place in the confer
ence for a good reason, and Marquess
knows that his team doesn't have much
margin for error.
"If you don't play well on a given week
end, Oregon beats us two out of three and
beats UCLA two out of three, and then they
go home and play Washington State, who's
not that highly ranked, and they lose two
out of three," he said. "If you don't play well
on a weekend, no matter who you're playing
in our conference, you're going to get beat.
We just have to worry about playing well.
"UCLA is very good, is playing very well
offense, defense, and their pitching so
it'll be tough for us," he added. "But they're
all tough."
The Cardinal will be looking to junior

Things seem to be clicking for the No. 9
Stanford baseball team at just the right time,
with a key Pac-12 series against No. 11
UCLA (27-10, 11-7) in Westwood, Calif,
kicking off tonight.
Going a perfect 4-0 and scoring at least
eight runs in all four of its games this week,

Stanford's bats finally seem to be coming to
gether again with five weekends of confer
ence play remaining. But it hasn't been pre
season Ail-American juniors Kenny
Diekroeger and Stephen Piscotty leading
the charge; instead, the Cardinal (26-10,8-7
Pac-12) has been getting much of its produc
tion from players who have been making
some of their first starts of the season due to
injuries to centerfielder Jake Stewart and

shortstop Lonnie Kauppila.
"Those younger players have really
worked hard and weren't starting to begin
with, but they've gotten the opportunity,"
said head coach Mark Marquess. "We've
needed them, and they've come up big for
us, so that's huge."
Though neither Danny Diekroeger nor
Brett Michael Doran has more than 30 at
bats on the season, the two sophomores cur
rently lead the team with their respective
.429 and .375 batting averages, with fresh
man Alex Blandino not far behind at .328.
Nine of the Cardinal's 10 runs in the squad's
nailbiter of a win over BYU on Friday were
driven in by underclassmen.
Sophomore rightfielder Austin Wilson
led the charge with five RBI, including a
line-drive solo homer, and says that the
team's discipline at the plate has been a
major contributor to its recent success.
"We've been seeing the ball very well, I'd
have to say, cutting our strikeouts down,"
Wilson said. "[lf we] just keep on doing that,
don't go out of the zone, don't chase pitches,
and just be able to get our pitch and don't
miss it, I think we'll be fine."
On the other hand, the Bruins' strength
is in their upperclassmen, with catcher
Tyler Heineman hitting an impressive .405
and four other juniors batting .346 or better.
That's a far cry from last season's UCLA
squad, which had just two starters hitting
above .300 and relied on the likes of righties
Gerrit Cole and Trevor Bauer chosen
first and third in last year's MLB draft, re
spectively to bring in wins.
Stanford topped that Bruin team in a
whirlwind series at Sunken Diamond a year
ago, taking the rubber game with a four-run,
two-out rally in the bottom of the ninth.
And UCLA's pitching staff isn't quite the
imposing force it was in 2010, with its 2.44
ERA from last season up almost a full point.
The Bruins' all-sophomore rotation of
righties Adam Plutko, Nick Vander Tuig and
Zach Weiss is untested and could be exploit
ed by Stanford's top-tier hitters.
Tliat bodes well for the Cardinal, espe
cially given the Bruins' struggles in a series
loss at No. 21 Oregon State last weekend.
But UCLA is in second place in the confer
ence for a good reason, and Marquess
knows that his team doesn't have much
margin for error.
"If you don't play well on a given week
end, Oregon beats us two out of three and
beats UCLA two out of three, and then they
go home and play Washington State, who's
not that highly ranked, and they lose two
out of three," he said. "If you don't play well
on a weekend, no matter who you're playing
in our conference, you're going to get beat.
We just have to worry about playing well.
"UCLA is very good, is playing very well
offense, defense, and their pitching so
it'll be tough for us," he added. "But they're
all tough."
The Cardinal will be looking to junior

Oregon the squad could con

be huge after the Wildcats and

their respective series with the
Cardinal. But even if Stanford
can make up just a little ground
