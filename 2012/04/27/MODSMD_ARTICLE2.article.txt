# COLTS PICK LUCK
## INDY SELECTS STAR QUARTERBACK FIRST OVERALL 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
Luck and a horseshoe. Some things
just go together perfectly.
After months of waiting, the Indi
anapolis Colts finally made Andrew
Luck's NFL dream official on Thurs
day night, selecting Luck with the first
overall pick in the NFL draft.
While Indianapolis general manag
er Ryan Grigson had already an
nounced that the Colts would select
Luck earlier in the week, the Stanford
star said the moment he'd been antici
pating for over two years was still an
exciting one.

"It was great. It was everything I
ever though it would be," Luck told
ESPN. "I can't wait to start with the
Colts."
Proudly displaying a blue Colts' hat
and horseshoe lapel pin, Luck's mes
sage to Indianapolis fans was to "hope
for the best" and promised that he
would "come in and work hard" for his
new team.
"I feel so honored, so grateful to
represent this city now and be a part of
the team," he said.
Luck is the fourth No. 1 overall draft
pick to come out of Stanford, following
Bobby Garrett, the first pick of the
Cleveland Browns in 1954, Jim Plun

kett, the Oakland Raiders' choice in
1971, and John Elway, who garnered a
trade to the Denver Broncos after
being picked first by the Baltimore
Colts in 1983.
For now. Luck will be tasked with
taking over a team that went 2-14 last
year, as well as replace future Hall of
Fame quarterback Peyton Manning,
who was released by the team after
missing the entirety of the 2011-2012
season with a neck injury.
""I realize you could go crazy trying
to just measure yourself to Peyton
Manning every day," Luck told the

Colts' official website. "I don't
think that would be a sane way to
live ... I'll just try and put my best
foot forward and work hard every
day. One day, if I can be men
tioned alongside Peyton Manning
as one of the quarterback greats,
that would be a football dream
come true."
The redshirt junior quarter
back was the 19th Stanford player
to ever be picked in the first
round, and the first Cardinal play
er to be picked in the first round
since the 49ers selected offensive
tackle Kwame Harris with the
26th pick in 2003.
Luck is expected to sign a four

year, $22 million deal with the
Colts later this week, a contract
comparable to that of last year's
number one pick, the Carolina
Panthers' Cam Newton.
After Luck finally put on the
Colts' blue and white, he didn't
have to wait long to see one of his
Cardinal teammates join him in
the NFL, as the Pittsburgh Steel
ers selected guard David DeCas
tro with the 24th pick.
Pittsburgh general manager
Kevin Colbert said it was a "no
brainer" pick that late in the draft,
as the tough, physical guard was
expected to be picked in the mid
dle of the first round.

"Really, we didn't think David
would be there at [the 24th pick].
We valued him very high," Col
bert told the Steelers' official
website. "As we said the other day,
there were a few special players in
this group that we thought would
be easy to evaluate and he was
one of them."
"I went into the thing with no
expectations," DeCastro said of
his unexpected slide. "The draft
has so many variables. You don't
know what's going to happen. I
am just thankful that I am on a
great team and a great franchise. I
am just excited."
Luck and DeCastro both going

in the first round marks the first
time since 1982 that two Stanford
players were selected in the first
round since 1982, when the At
lanta Falcons picked tackle Bob
Whitfield with the eighth pick,
and the Browns took fullback
Tommy Vardell with the ninth
pick.
But while Luck and DeCastro
now know where they'll be play
ing for the next few seasons, fel
low Cardinal teammates Coby
Fleener and Jonathan Martin
must wait until this evening to
have their names called, as the
two highly rated prospects both
slipped out of the trade-filled first

While both Fleener and Mar
tin should go in the first 10 or 15
picks of the second round, a first
round that could have been filled
with four Stanford players was in
stead left curiously devoid of Car
dinal, as several teams reached for
prospects that were far less highly
regarded than either Fleener or
Martin.
The NFL draft resumes Friday,
April 27 at 4 p.m. PST, at New
York City's Radio City Music
Hall.

New Colts quarterback Andrew Luck was not the only Cardinal player chosen in the first round of the NFL draft, as the Pittsburgh Steelers selected guard David DeCastro 24th overall.
Luck and a horseshoe. Some things
just go together perfectly.
After months of waiting, the Indi
anapolis Colts finally made Andrew
Luck's NFL dream official on Thurs
day night, selecting Luck with the first
overall pick in the NFL draft.
While Indianapolis general manag
er Ryan Grigson had already an
nounced that the Colts would select
Luck earlier in the week, the Stanford
star said the moment he'd been antici
pating for over two years was still an
exciting one.

"It was great. It was everything I
ever though it would be," Luck told
ESPN. "I can't wait to start with the
Colts."
Proudly displaying a blue Colts' hat
and horseshoe lapel pin, Luck's mes
sage to Indianapolis fans was to "hope
for the best" and promised that he
would "come in and work hard" for his
new team.
"I feel so honored, so grateful to
represent this city now and be a part of
the team," he said.
Luck is the fourth No. 1 overall draft
pick to come out of Stanford, following
Bobby Garrett, the first pick of the
Cleveland Browns in 1954, Jim Plun

kett, the Oakland Raiders' choice in
1971, and John Elway, who garnered a
trade to the Denver Broncos after
being picked first by the Baltimore
Colts in 1983.
For now. Luck will be tasked with
taking over a team that went 2-14 last
year, as well as replace future Hall of
Fame quarterback Peyton Manning,
who was released by the team after
missing the entirety of the 2011-2012
season with a neck injury.
""I realize you could go crazy trying
to just measure yourself to Peyton
Manning every day," Luck told the

Colts' official website. "I don't
think that would be a sane way to
live ... I'll just try and put my best
foot forward and work hard every
day. One day, if I can be men
tioned alongside Peyton Manning
as one of the quarterback greats,
that would be a football dream
come true."
The redshirt junior quarter
back was the 19th Stanford player
to ever be picked in the first
round, and the first Cardinal play
er to be picked in the first round
since the 49ers selected offensive
tackle Kwame Harris with the
26th pick in 2003.
Luck is expected to sign a four

year, $22 million deal with the
Colts later this week, a contract
comparable to that of last year's
number one pick, the Carolina
Panthers' Cam Newton.
After Luck finally put on the
Colts' blue and white, he didn't
have to wait long to see one of his
Cardinal teammates join him in
the NFL, as the Pittsburgh Steel
ers selected guard David DeCas
tro with the 24th pick.
Pittsburgh general manager
Kevin Colbert said it was a "no
brainer" pick that late in the draft,
as the tough, physical guard was
expected to be picked in the mid
dle of the first round.

"Really, we didn't think David
would be there at [the 24th pick].
We valued him very high," Col
bert told the Steelers' official
website. "As we said the other day,
there were a few special players in
this group that we thought would
be easy to evaluate and he was
one of them."
"I went into the thing with no
expectations," DeCastro said of
his unexpected slide. "The draft
has so many variables. You don't
know what's going to happen. I
am just thankful that I am on a
great team and a great franchise. I
am just excited."
Luck and DeCastro both going

in the first round marks the first
time since 1982 that two Stanford
players were selected in the first
round since 1982, when the At
lanta Falcons picked tackle Bob
Whitfield with the eighth pick,
and the Browns took fullback
Tommy Vardell with the ninth
pick.
But while Luck and DeCastro
now know where they'll be play
ing for the next few seasons, fel
low Cardinal teammates Coby
Fleener and Jonathan Martin
must wait until this evening to
have their names called, as the
two highly rated prospects both
slipped out of the trade-filled first

While both Fleener and Mar
tin should go in the first 10 or 15
picks of the second round, a first
round that could have been filled
with four Stanford players was in
stead left curiously devoid of Car
dinal, as several teams reached for
prospects that were far less highly
regarded than either Fleener or
Martin.
The NFL draft resumes Friday,
April 27 at 4 p.m. PST, at New
York City's Radio City Music
Hall.
