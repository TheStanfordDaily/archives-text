Luck and a horseshoe. Some things
just go together perfectly.
After months of waiting, the Indi
anapolis Colts finally made Andrew
Luck's NFL dream official on Thurs
day night, selecting Luck with the first
overall pick in the NFL draft.
While Indianapolis general manag
er Ryan Grigson had already an
nounced that the Colts would select
Luck earlier in the week, the Stanford
star said the moment he'd been antici
pating for over two years was still an
exciting one.

"It was great. It was everything I
ever though it would be," Luck told
ESPN. "I can't wait to start with the
Colts."
Proudly displaying a blue Colts' hat
and horseshoe lapel pin, Luck's mes
sage to Indianapolis fans was to "hope
for the best" and promised that he
would "come in and work hard" for his
new team.
"I feel so honored, so grateful to
represent this city now and be a part of
the team," he said.
Luck is the fourth No. 1 overall draft
pick to come out of Stanford, following
Bobby Garrett, the first pick of the
Cleveland Browns in 1954, Jim Plun

kett, the Oakland Raiders' choice in
1971, and John Elway, who garnered a
trade to the Denver Broncos after
being picked first by the Baltimore
Colts in 1983.
For now. Luck will be tasked with
taking over a team that went 2-14 last
year, as well as replace future Hall of
Fame quarterback Peyton Manning,
who was released by the team after
missing the entirety of the 2011-2012
season with a neck injury.
""I realize you could go crazy trying
to just measure yourself to Peyton
Manning every day," Luck told the
