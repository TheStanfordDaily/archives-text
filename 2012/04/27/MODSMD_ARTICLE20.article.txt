# Cougars no match for Card
## 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Nearly three months ago, the Stanford men's
volleyball team knocked off then-No. 1 BYU
twice in back-to-back matches. The Cardinal
used the pivotal sweep as a launching point for
its eight-match winning streak during the mid
season stretch, creating momentum that the
team has carried into the postseason.
Even with the stakes raised in the semifinal
round of the MPSF Tournament, last night
proved to be no different for the No. 3 Cardinal
(22-6,18-5 MPSF) as it once again defeated No.
4 BYU (24-7,17-6 MPSF) by the score of 3-1, in
cluding a 35-33 marathon fourth set to close out
the victory.
Stanford has lived up to its status as the tour
nament's second seed, blowing past two top-10
teams in one week to earn a spot in the finals
against No. 2 UC-Irvine, the fourth seed in the
tournament. The team's latest dominant per
formance against a tough Cougars team sug
gests that the Cardinal is playing its best volley
ball at the right time.
Playing in front of a crowd of 1,000 people at
USC's Galen Center, senior outside hitter Brad
Lawson was outstanding as usual, finishing with
17 kills and five assists. Sophomores Brian
Cook and Steve Irvin joined Lawson in double
digit kills, notching 16 and 12 kills, respectively.
"I think the biggest factor in our win was
how we handled each point tonight," said Law
son. "We were in the moment and were able to
move on after bad plays, close calls and big
points from BYU."
The Cardinal edged out the Cougars 25-21 in
the first set, amassing an exceptional 0.400 hit
ting percentage and 18 kills as a team. After
BYU answered with a victory in the second set,


ROGER CHEN/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore outside hitter Brian Cook (above) had 16 kills in the No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball
team's victory over No. 4 BYU in the semifinal of the MPSF Conference Tournament.
The Cardinal will take on a tough No. 2 UC Irvine in the finals on Saturday.
Stanford regained the upper
hand with a 25-18 win in the third
set.
But it was the fourth and final
set that proved to be the most ex
citing, with the Cardinal trying to
clinch the match and the Cougars
hoping to stay alive. In the set
alone, there were 28 tie scores
and 16 lead changes. BYU was on
the brink of extending the match
to a fifth set, but the resilient
Stanford players foiled the
Cougars' four set points. Follow
ing a critical point coming from
Irvin's block, sophomore middle
blocker Mochalski ended the
marathon set and the match with
an ace to secure the 35-33 win.
"That was such a fun match to
be part of, and I am tremendous
ly proud of our team. It wasn't a

clutch performance by any one
person," Mochalski said. "As a
team, we fought off game point
after game point and stuck to
gether until that last serve. Every
one on our team made a clutch
contribution at some point. We
were confident in each other the
entire time down the stretch and
knew we could pull it out."
The Cougars certainly put up
a fight. BYU sophomore outside
hitter Taylor Sander led the
Cougars with 27 kills while sen
ior setter Joe Kauliakamoa
dished out an impressive 56 as
sists. But it wasn't nearly enough
to throw the Cardinal players off
sync or intimidate them down
the stretch.

"I'm so proud of how we
grinded out each point, especial
ly late in the fourth set," Lawson
said about the team's clutch per
formance late in the game. "We
relied on each other and just
trusted that we'd be there for
each other at crucial moments. I

have to give a lot of credit to our
defense and middle blockers as
well. They put up great numbers
and Mochalski's serve to close
out the match was huge."
The fluid, solid play that has
characterized the team's recent
matches should certainly give
the Cardinal confidence as it
prepares to face UC-Irvine for
the MPSF Tournament title on
Saturday. But beating the
Anteaters will be no easy task.
Shortly after Stanford defeated
BYU last night, UC-Irvine fol
lowed suit by defeating No. 1
USC in five sets. The fact that the
Anteaters were down two sets
before storming back to win the
last three makes their win all the
more impressive.
Stanford will square off
against UC-Irvine for the MPSF
Tournament title at 7 p.m. on Sat
urday at USC's Galen Center.

alone, there were 28 tie scores
and 16 lead changes. BYU was on
the brink of extending the match
to a fifth set, but the resilient
Stanford players foiled the
Cougars' four set points. Follow
ing a critical point coming from
Irvin's block, sophomore middle
blocker Mochalski ended the
marathon set and the match with
an ace to secure the 35-33 win.
"That was such a fun match to
be part of, and I am tremendous
ly proud of our team. It wasn't a

clutch performance by any one
person," Mochalski said. "As a
team, we fought off game point
after game point and stuck to
gether until that last serve. Every
one on our team made a clutch
contribution at some point. We
were confident in each other the
entire time down the stretch and
knew we could pull it out."
The Cougars certainly put up
a fight. BYU sophomore outside
hitter Taylor Sander led the
Cougars with 27 kills while sen
ior setter Joe Kauliakamoa
dished out an impressive 56 as
sists. But it wasn't nearly enough
to throw the Cardinal players off
sync or intimidate them down
the stretch.

"I'm so proud of how we
grinded out each point, especial
ly late in the fourth set," Lawson
said about the team's clutch per
formance late in the game. "We
relied on each other and just
trusted that we'd be there for
each other at crucial moments. I

have to give a lot of credit to our
defense and middle blockers as
well. They put up great numbers
and Mochalski's serve to close
out the match was huge."
The fluid, solid play that has
characterized the team's recent
matches should certainly give
the Cardinal confidence as it
prepares to face UC-Irvine for
the MPSF Tournament title on
Saturday. But beating the
Anteaters will be no easy task.
Shortly after Stanford defeated
BYU last night, UC-Irvine fol
lowed suit by defeating No. 1
USC in five sets. The fact that the
Anteaters were down two sets
before storming back to win the
last three makes their win all the
more impressive.
Stanford will square off
against UC-Irvine for the MPSF
Tournament title at 7 p.m. on Sat
urday at USC's Galen Center.

Nearly three months ago, the Stanford men's
volleyball team knocked off then-No. 1 BYU
twice in back-to-back matches. The Cardinal
used the pivotal sweep as a launching point for
its eight-match winning streak during the mid
season stretch, creating momentum that the
team has carried into the postseason.
Even with the stakes raised in the semifinal
round of the MPSF Tournament, last night
proved to be no different for the No. 3 Cardinal
(22-6,18-5 MPSF) as it once again defeated No.
4 BYU (24-7,17-6 MPSF) by the score of 3-1, in
cluding a 35-33 marathon fourth set to close out
the victory.
Stanford has lived up to its status as the tour
nament's second seed, blowing past two top-10
teams in one week to earn a spot in the finals
against No. 2 UC-Irvine, the fourth seed in the
tournament. The team's latest dominant per
formance against a tough Cougars team sug
gests that the Cardinal is playing its best volley
ball at the right time.
Playing in front of a crowd of 1,000 people at
USC's Galen Center, senior outside hitter Brad
Lawson was outstanding as usual, finishing with
17 kills and five assists. Sophomores Brian
Cook and Steve Irvin joined Lawson in double
digit kills, notching 16 and 12 kills, respectively.
"I think the biggest factor in our win was
how we handled each point tonight," said Law
son. "We were in the moment and were able to
move on after bad plays, close calls and big
points from BYU."
The Cardinal edged out the Cougars 25-21 in
the first set, amassing an exceptional 0.400 hit
ting percentage and 18 kills as a team. After
BYU answered with a victory in the second set,

Sophomore outside hitter Brian Cook (above) had 16 kills in the No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball
team's victory over No. 4 BYU in the semifinal of the MPSF Conference Tournament.
The Cardinal will take on a tough No. 2 UC Irvine in the finals on Saturday.
Stanford regained the upper
hand with a 25-18 win in the third
set.
But it was the fourth and final
set that proved to be the most ex
citing, with the Cardinal trying to
clinch the match and the Cougars
hoping to stay alive. In the set
alone, there were 28 tie scores
and 16 lead changes. BYU was on
the brink of extending the match
