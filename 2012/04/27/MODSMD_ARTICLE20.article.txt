# Cougars no match for Card
## 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Nearly three months ago, the Stanford men's
volleyball team knocked off then-No. 1 BYU
twice in back-to-back matches. The Cardinal
used the pivotal sweep as a launching point for
its eight-match winning streak during the mid
season stretch, creating momentum that the
team has carried into the postseason.
Even with the stakes raised in the semifinal
round of the MPSF Tournament, last night
proved to be no different for the No. 3 Cardinal
(22-6,18-5 MPSF) as it once again defeated No.
4 BYU (24-7,17-6 MPSF) by the score of 3-1, in
cluding a 35-33 marathon fourth set to close out
the victory.
Stanford has lived up to its status as the tour
nament's second seed, blowing past two top-10
teams in one week to earn a spot in the finals
against No. 2 UC-Irvine, the fourth seed in the
tournament. The team's latest dominant per
formance against a tough Cougars team sug
gests that the Cardinal is playing its best volley
ball at the right time.
Playing in front of a crowd of 1,000 people at
USC's Galen Center, senior outside hitter Brad
Lawson was outstanding as usual, finishing with
17 kills and five assists. Sophomores Brian
Cook and Steve Irvin joined Lawson in double
digit kills, notching 16 and 12 kills, respectively.
"I think the biggest factor in our win was
how we handled each point tonight," said Law
son. "We were in the moment and were able to
move on after bad plays, close calls and big
points from BYU."
The Cardinal edged out the Cougars 25-21 in
the first set, amassing an exceptional 0.400 hit
ting percentage and 18 kills as a team. After
BYU answered with a victory in the second set,
