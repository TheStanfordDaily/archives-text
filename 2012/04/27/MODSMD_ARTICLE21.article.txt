# Looking back in time

Suffering through the sec
ond half of Cal's 37-16 Big
Game win in 2008, with 5-
6 Stanford's bowl hopes
slipping away in the
eleventh hour, I remember the mur
murs going through the crowd:
"When are they going to burn this
Luck guy's redstart, already?"
We had heard that quarterback
Andrew Luck was special. But back
then we really had no idea just how
special he was, and we also didn't re
alize what an incredible supporting
cast he had alongside him.
Four of the members of Cardinal
football's Class of 2012 have walked
or will walk across the stage at Radio
City Music Hall this week in the
early rounds of the NFL Draft. As
we watch them go Luck at No. 1,
David DeCastro at No. 24, and Coby
Fleener in the early second round,
with Jonathan Martin closely after
something will really begin to
sink in: We're going to miss these
guys.
A 31-8 record as starters since
2009. A 17-game win streak span
ning two seasons. Three straight
bowl berths, two of the BCS variety.
Even with the Cardinal's remain
ing talent, that's going to be a tough
act to follow. So, as Stanford fans are
so fond of doing, let's look back on
better times and relive the top five
moments for Luck, Fleener, DeCas
tro and Martin over the last three
seasons.
5. Nov. 20,2010: Cal crushed 48-14 at
Memorial Stadium
After throwing a late intercep
tion to cost Stanford a shot at the
2009 Big Game, Luck responded
dominantly in Berkeley a year later.
The No. 7 Cardinal jumped out to a
45-0 lead through three quarters,
with Luck going 16-for-20 with two
touchdowns and famously barreling
over Cal's Sean Cattouse on a 58-
yard run in the first quarter. Stanford
added 232 yards on the ground and
the Axe was returned to its proper
home on the Farm.

4. Oct. 29,2011: Stanford beats USC
in triple-overtime slugfest
Looking to get its third straight
win on the Trojans' home turf the
No. 6 Cardinal needed a victory to
extend its school-record 15-game
win streak. Luck and Matt Barkley
each fired three touchdowns,but No.
20 USC erased Stanford's four-point
halftime lead to grab a 10-point lead
of its own early in the third quarter.
Luck engineered two scoring drives
in a row, including a 62-yard throw to
Ty Montgomery on a gadget play
from deep inside Cardinal territory.
The Trojans came back yet again,
and Luck had a chance to engineer
the game-winning drive in the final
minutes. But the golden opportunity
turned into disaster in a heartbeat, as
the star quarterback misread a route
and threw a pick-six, seemingly
handing the game to USC on a silver
platter on national TV, no less.
Not so fast. Luck drove 76 yards
for the tying score, and Stanford was
perfect in the overtime session. Just
after Luck converted the two-point
try in the third overtime, AJ.Tarpley
recovered a USC fumble in the end
zone to secure the 56-48 win and
keep the Cardinal's perfect season
going.
3. Oct. 9,2010: Last-second field goal
downs the Trojans
It might not have gone three
overtimes, but this one was played at
Stanford, which definitely counts for
something. The No. 16 Cardinal
couldn't pull away from the Trojans
in the first half and nearly fell behind
on a fumble in the final minute of the
second quarter. Luck saved the day,
delivering a monster blow to Sha
reece Wright to save a touchdown.
Those points would come in
handy later on, with Barkley throw
ing for 390 yards and putting his
team on top 35-34 with just 1:08 left.
But Luck wasn't done, completing
three straight passes on Stanford's
62-yard drive and centering the ball
for a last-second field-goal try. Nate
Whitaker's field-goal try was perfect
as time expired, and Cardinal fans
flooded onto the field to celebrate
their quarterback's heroics.
2. Jan. 2, 2012: Cardinal comes up
just short in the Fiesta Bowl
It's the only loss on here, but a
BCS Bowl is a BCS Bowl, and the de
facto third-place game between No.
3 Oklahoma State and N0.4 Stan
ford was a dandy. Luck's last college
game was arguably his best, as he
completed 27 of 31 passes for 347
yards. Martin and DeCastro were
huge factors on the offensive line
and fueled the Cardinal's 272-to
-26 yard rushing advantage. The ef
fort wasn't enough, however, and
after Stanford missed two crucial
field goals, the Cardinal would
have to leave Glendale empty
handed in the 41-38 OT loss.
1. Jan. 3, 2011: Orange you glad
You can make the argument
that the Cardinal's defense won it
the 2011 Orange Bowl, sacking dy
namic Virginia Tech quarterback
Tyrod Taylor eight times and shut
ting out the No. 12 Hokies in the
second half. But the lasting image
of Stanford's first bowl win in the
BCS era will forever be Andrew
Luck to Coby Fleener.
The pair combined for three

touchdown passes, all in a 14:44
span in the second half, all for over
35 yards. It was Fleener's breakout
game on the national scene and
also one of Luck's finest, as the
junior threw for 287 yards and four
touchdowns.
Just like that, the Cardinal was
bringing home a bowl full of or
anges.
But the thing that Stanford stu
dents will always be most grateful
for happened years earlier, when
the group went out on a limb and
committed to a struggling pro
gram not far ahead of a 1-11 sea
son. They transformed Stanford
into a world-class football pro
gram, and for that they will be
sorely missed.

Joseph Bey da can't believe that
Coby Fleener wasn't picked in the
first round, but hopes that somehow
the Luck-Fleener duo will be re
united in Indianapolis. Let him
