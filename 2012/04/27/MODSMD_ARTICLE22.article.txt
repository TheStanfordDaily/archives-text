# On to the next big round
## FOUR CARDINAL PLAYERS MOVE ON IN PAC-12 CHAMPIONSHIP 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
Six players from the Stanford women's tennis
team were in action yesterday for the first day of the
Pac-12 Championships in Ojai, Calif. Each of the six
was competing individually, as the women's confer
ence tournament does not have a team component,
unlike the Pac-12's men's tournament.
Stanford's players, just one day after their 7-0 Pac
-12 title clinching victory over Washington State, are
looking to build on last year's success in this tourna
ment. Three out of the four 2011 semifinalists came
from Stanford, although sophomore Kristie Ahn, last
year's eventual winner, is injured and will not have a
chance to defend her crown. Junior Mallory
Burdette, the No. 5 ranked player in the country, won
her opening match 6-3, 6-1 over Washington's And
jela Nemcevic in one of the day's earlier matchups.
No. 57 Stacey Tan also won Thursday morning, de
feating Arizona's Kim Stubbe 7-6 (1), 6-4. Tan was
one of the Stanford players to lose in last year's semi
finals, along with sophomore Nicole Gibbs.
Gibbs, who is the No. 1 seed of the tournament
and the No. 3 player in the country, lost the first set to
UCLA senior McCall Jones, but came back on the
last two sets with winning scores of 6-3 and 6-2.
In the Invitational section of the tournament,
which is a different bracket from the Champi
onships, junior Natalie Dillon and sophomore
Amelia Herring both lost.
The big challenge still lies ahead for the Cardinal
players as this year's tournament field is especially
talented.
"It will be good experience because a lot of the
top ranked players are in the Pac-12," said Burdette,
who is the No. 3 seed in the tournament. In fact, four
of the top 10 players in the nation are from the Pac
-12, as well as nine of the top 25.
The four Stanford players are split up in the draw
so that none of them can meet until the semifinals.
The draw is also set up so that a finals rematch be
tween Gibbs and Burdette is possible. The two met at
the USTAITA Northwest Regional Championships
final earlier this year, where Gibbs narrowly won 6-
4,6-3,7-6(3).
The two of them will be sharing the court with
certainty as the top seed in the doubles draw, which
starts Friday. Last year, Burdette won the NCAA
doubles championship alongside now-graduated Hi
lary Barte, which means she and Gibbs have been
playing doubles together for less than a full season.
"In the past, the Pac-12 tournament has been re
ally big for me in doubles, and this year I can get pre
pared with [Gibbs] against great competition," Bur
dette said.
Play will continue all weekend, barring interfer
ence from rain. The final for the 32-team singles
draw is scheduled for Sunday morning. The champi
onship of the 16-team doubles draw is set for later
the same day.

Sophomore Kristie Ahn (above) won the Pac-10 Singles Championship last year, but will be unable to play in the inaugural Pac-12 Championship for the No. 5 Cardinal due to an injury. However, she will cheer on four of her teammates who won their
opening-round matches of the Pac-12 Championship and will move on to the next round of tournament play starting today.
