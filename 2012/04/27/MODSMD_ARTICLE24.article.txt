## THE 						TOP 5 FICTIONAL STANFORD MOVIES 
### 
We live in a time when people casually throw around say
ings like "the soundtrack to my life" and "my life is a
movie, and you just Tivo."This week Intermission's wonder
ing: If our Stanford lives are really reel-worthy, what would
the movie be like? Here are our top five picks for Stanford
movies that haven't been made (yet).

"Full Moon On the
Quad"
Part "American Werewolf in
London" and part
"National Lampoon's Dorm
Daze," this romantic thriller
documents a young fresh
man girl in her experiment
with debauchery and
moonlight. Meanwhile, a
lurking senior boy is not as
he appears. Hits theatres at
midnight by the second
moon of the school year.

"PWR2"
In this sequel to "PWRI,"
former freshman flings
rekindle an old flame while
pondering the rhetoric of
politics of business on the
Internet. After parting ways
during a frenzied spring
quarter and summer vaca
tion, these two sopho
mores realize their maturity
in a familiar, sophomore
only environment. In the
atres autumn, winter and
spring quarters of the sec
ond year.

"Benj and Tim Go
to Chipotle"
In this buddy adventure, a
philosophically inclined
Benj and his techie-friend
Tim crave some late-night,
semi-ethnic food, but when
they run into mischief and
campus security between

Serra dorm and Serra
Street, hilarity ensues.
"Benj and Tim" promises
to be the brogrammer
comedy of the year. Some
knowledge of C++ helpful;
no children under freshman
year allowed.

"Hot Prowl"
This Hitchcockian, cerebral
drama follows our junior
heroine, Angelica, as she
fends off a creeper in the
night. Missing window
screens, wandering video
phones and the scent of
apples lead to paranoia
and suspicion in the mys
tery to discover just who
stalks the streets from the
Faculty Club to the Rains
houses. Campus security
advises you keep your win
dows shut and doors
locked and to stay tuned
for a screening near you!

"Elections"
With all the power plays of
a courtroom drama and the
intensity of a countdown
mystery, "Elections" tells
the tale of a Daily journalist
in his investigation to
unwrap scandal and decep
tion in the heat of spring
elections. MemeChu-wor
thy actors run the gamut of
political brawls, but only
the truth will make it to
print. For limited release
this spring.
