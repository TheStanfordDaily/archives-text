Ralph Nguyen's celebrity is spreading. He's been
approached at Mardi Gras and Coachella, and
the barista at Pete's Coffee in Town and Country
gave him a free drink when he recognized him. Some
people even ask to take pictures with the Stanford senior,
creator and star of popular You Tube videos like "Shit
Stanford Students Say" and "Shit College Freshman Say."
He's been making money on the Internet since the
sixth grade, but began his You Tube career making
videoblogs with, in his words, "really inane commentary
on the 2008 election status" which earned him a couple
thousand dollars in ad money. Currently, Nguyen has
ten You Tube accounts that he regularly uploads with
content.
"Some of them are funnier than others; some of
them are informational," he said. Others are "so bad"
that he does not want his name associated with them,
hiding them under about five different pseudonyms.
For inspiration for new content, Nguyen looks to
the news and to Internet trends.
"I've always been a part of Internet culture, but I
think that now Internet culture is becoming more main
stream," Nguyen says of his penchant for adapting
Internet trends to Stanford-specific phenomena.
Nguyen is the creator of the popular MemeChu
Facebook page of Stanford-themed memes, now run by
him and six other students. His Stanford videos and the
MemeChu page have involved a lot of collaboration to
refine his ideas and create the content. Apparently, there
is a lot of shit Stanford students say that hit the cutting
room floor, as his initial script was eight minutes long,
and his actors helped him choose the best two-and-a
half minutes of content. As far as other campus celebri
ties go, Nguyen turns to a co-collaborator on "Shit
Stanford Students Say," declaring: "[Senior] Mary Glen
Fredrick is the funniest girl on campus."
Nguyen believes his Internet fame has been a posi
tive experience. He encourages people who recognize his
meme-star face to approach him, especially if they can
offer him a job. One of the most surprising things to

Nguyen about this whole experience is that other people
will ask for advice on their You Tube careers or for feed
back on their comedy scripts.
"Like I have some sort of authority over them," he
laughs.
Nguyen might do one last video aimed at the
Stanford community, but otherwise is trying to adapt his
online career to target different audiences, especially
women and "tweenies," which he thinks are untapped,
but viable, "money making hotspots."
In less than two months, Nguyen will graduate with
a co-term in sociology, a major in computer science and
a minor in psychology. After graduation, he is headed to
Los Angeles to pursue a career as a comedy writer and
performer, with a long-term plan that includes becom
ing rich and famous, getting married and divorced, hav
ing three children and losing his house. But in the mean
time, he'll continue making videos, writing scripts and
performing stand-up all the while trying not starving
or become homeless.
