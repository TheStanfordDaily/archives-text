## THE 						CHAPPIE THE 						OLD BOYS TALK PRANKS, TRADITION AND ABSURDITY 
### â€“ alex BAYER contact alex: abayer@stanford. edu 
Stepping into the Chappie offices isn't
unlike setting foot into your older
brother's room. A really weird, cool
older brother. In the small, square room
where the Chappie regulars and their guests
congregate once a week (that's 8:30 p.m.,
Wednesdays, Nitery 2nd floor), a pair of bat
tered sofa chairs face a ring of mismatched
sectionals. Candy-colored vintage Chappie
issues line the wall; they could easily pass for
your brother's retro comic collection. In the
corner, next to a bird cage (no explanation
available), is a bookcase of Chappie-themed
memorabilia: a few cans that once held
"Chappi" brand dog food, a framed photo
graph of Die Antwoord's badass emcee
Yolandi Visser showing off a "Chappie" tat
too on her forearm, another framed photo
graph of the crew crashing Kirsten Dunst's
birthday. Yes, they did that.
For those on the outside, the Chappie is
impenetrable. Weird, absurdist, not funny
the Chappie has weathered such labels its
entire 106-year existence. What the people
on the inside will tell you is that the Chappie
doesn't seek to be embraced by the main
stream; its lifeblood is in opposition. The
group has had historic friction with the

University administration, such as in 1961,
when editor in chief Brad Efron ran a risque
parody of Playboy, causing the magazine to
undergo suspension. Legend also has it that
in 1975 editor in chief Mike Dornheim '75
hooked up a speaker to a vending machine
after the heiress Patty Hearst was famously
kidnapped in Palo Alto and cried out from
behind the glass, "Help, I'm trapped! I'm
Patty Hearst!" (A frightened girl called the
police, twenty squadron cars showed up and
entered into a standoff with the vending
machine.)
The Chappie continues its history of
pranking today with its annual publication
of an imitation Daily. In fact, many pranks

between The Chappie and The Daily have
played out in past decades. In 1980, a group
of Chappie pranksters managed to sneak a
photograph and false report into the paper
that members of the University's bowling
team died in a plane crash. The paper print
ed an apology and explanation of the hoax.
Today, sitting in those two especially
worn-out chairs are the current Old Boys (as
the editors in chief are called), Sam
Coggeshall 'l2 and Alex Hertz 'l3. As resi
dent Old Boys, the pair presides over the
publication of this year's issues and front the
Wednesday meetings (in case you're wonder
ing whether there have been female Old
Boys, the answer is yes).
Coggeshall, a spiffy-dressing senior with
a brown, curly fro and a goofy smile, and
Hertz, a clean-cut junior with a penchant for
chambray button-downs and a laid-back
grin (I don't know why I'm fixating on

smiles), are roommates, best friends "4 lyfe"
(Hertz tells me) and a bit of a balancing act.
Hertz describes himself as the creative force,
channeling into the Chappie his absurdist and
silly brand of humor. He describes Coggeshall
as approaching humor from an intellectual
stance; Hertz tempers his fellow Old Boy's
trademark energy, while Coggeshall keeps in
check Hertz's absurdist humor. What results is
a lovely family portrait and the makings of a
hit CBS sitcom. As described by Hertz:
Coggeshall is the boring father figure, Hertz is
the crazy uncle and they're raising a son
together, which would be the Chappie.
So how about that damn humor? The
question on everyone's lips is: Do people get
the Chappie, and does it matter if they do?
For the denizens of this office, the majority
would say no. Hertz describes his mission as
producing the funniest magazine possible;
sure, he'd like to see it be accessible, but pre-

serving that signature Chappie voice is more
important to him. Perhaps Old Boy Emeritus
Joshua Meisel 'l2 puts it best, when he relates
to me some wise words from the comedian
Dan Minsk, a successful stand-up comedian
despite his high-brow, obscure humor. Stand
up comedians, he explained, have control over
the timing of their jokes; that's how they make
their material funny. Therein lies the challenge
of publishing humor in a magazine; It's up to
the reader to find for him or herself the
rhythm of the jokes. It would be like scatter
ing music sheets on the sidewalk and expect
ing passerby to appreciate a symphony's aural
beauty.
This presents somewhat of a catch-22
when it comes to ASSU special fees. As many
know, the Chappie recently failed to gain stu
dent-voted special fees for the second year in a
row, a blow to its ego if nothing else. How
does a publication that prides itself on its con
tradiction of the mainstream reconcile with
its needs for, well, money? In cases like this,
the popular vote is important. And unfortu
nately, that's something the Chappie simply
isn't engineered to attract. Time will tell which
direction the Chappie will choose to take
when, next year, two new Old Boys, Kian
Ameli 'l3 and Daniel Koning 'l4, will take
over the beat-up sofa chair thrones. For now,
Hertz invites us to look forward to the
upcoming "Funk" issue, of which he is partic
ularly proud.
The Chappie is weird, proudly so. And
at the steering wheel of this weird, weird ship
are two quirky guys sitting in a pair of beat
up La-Z-Boys, fighting the "man" (that
would be the Stanford status quo) one "Face
Cat" at a time. That is to say, one absurdist
joke at a time. Amen.

a brown, curly fro and a goofy smile, and
Hertz, a clean-cut junior with a penchant for
chambray button-downs and a laid-back
grin (I don't know why I'm fixating on

smiles), are roommates, best friends "4 lyfe"
(Hertz tells me) and a bit of a balancing act.
Hertz describes himself as the creative force,
channeling into the Chappie his absurdist and
silly brand of humor. He describes Coggeshall
as approaching humor from an intellectual
stance; Hertz tempers his fellow Old Boy's
trademark energy, while Coggeshall keeps in
check Hertz's absurdist humor. What results is
a lovely family portrait and the makings of a
hit CBS sitcom. As described by Hertz:
Coggeshall is the boring father figure, Hertz is
the crazy uncle and they're raising a son
together, which would be the Chappie.
So how about that damn humor? The
question on everyone's lips is: Do people get
the Chappie, and does it matter if they do?
For the denizens of this office, the majority
would say no. Hertz describes his mission as
producing the funniest magazine possible;
sure, he'd like to see it be accessible, but pre-

serving that signature Chappie voice is more
important to him. Perhaps Old Boy Emeritus
Joshua Meisel 'l2 puts it best, when he relates
to me some wise words from the comedian
Dan Minsk, a successful stand-up comedian
despite his high-brow, obscure humor. Stand
up comedians, he explained, have control over
the timing of their jokes; that's how they make
their material funny. Therein lies the challenge
of publishing humor in a magazine; It's up to
the reader to find for him or herself the
rhythm of the jokes. It would be like scatter
ing music sheets on the sidewalk and expect
ing passerby to appreciate a symphony's aural
beauty.
This presents somewhat of a catch-22
when it comes to ASSU special fees. As many
know, the Chappie recently failed to gain stu
dent-voted special fees for the second year in a
row, a blow to its ego if nothing else. How
does a publication that prides itself on its con
tradiction of the mainstream reconcile with
its needs for, well, money? In cases like this,
the popular vote is important. And unfortu
nately, that's something the Chappie simply
isn't engineered to attract. Time will tell which
direction the Chappie will choose to take
when, next year, two new Old Boys, Kian
Ameli 'l3 and Daniel Koning 'l4, will take
over the beat-up sofa chair thrones. For now,
Hertz invites us to look forward to the
upcoming "Funk" issue, of which he is partic
ularly proud.
The Chappie is weird, proudly so. And
at the steering wheel of this weird, weird ship
are two quirky guys sitting in a pair of beat
up La-Z-Boys, fighting the "man" (that
would be the Stanford status quo) one "Face
Cat" at a time. That is to say, one absurdist
joke at a time. Amen.

Stepping into the Chappie offices isn't
unlike setting foot into your older
brother's room. A really weird, cool
older brother. In the small, square room
where the Chappie regulars and their guests
congregate once a week (that's 8:30 p.m.,
Wednesdays, Nitery 2nd floor), a pair of bat
tered sofa chairs face a ring of mismatched
sectionals. Candy-colored vintage Chappie
issues line the wall; they could easily pass for
your brother's retro comic collection. In the
corner, next to a bird cage (no explanation
available), is a bookcase of Chappie-themed
memorabilia: a few cans that once held
"Chappi" brand dog food, a framed photo
graph of Die Antwoord's badass emcee
Yolandi Visser showing off a "Chappie" tat
too on her forearm, another framed photo
graph of the crew crashing Kirsten Dunst's
birthday. Yes, they did that.
For those on the outside, the Chappie is
impenetrable. Weird, absurdist, not funny
the Chappie has weathered such labels its
entire 106-year existence. What the people
on the inside will tell you is that the Chappie
doesn't seek to be embraced by the main
stream; its lifeblood is in opposition. The
group has had historic friction with the

University administration, such as in 1961,
when editor in chief Brad Efron ran a risque
parody of Playboy, causing the magazine to
undergo suspension. Legend also has it that
in 1975 editor in chief Mike Dornheim '75
hooked up a speaker to a vending machine
after the heiress Patty Hearst was famously
kidnapped in Palo Alto and cried out from
behind the glass, "Help, I'm trapped! I'm
Patty Hearst!" (A frightened girl called the
police, twenty squadron cars showed up and
entered into a standoff with the vending
machine.)
The Chappie continues its history of
pranking today with its annual publication
of an imitation Daily. In fact, many pranks

between The Chappie and The Daily have
played out in past decades. In 1980, a group
of Chappie pranksters managed to sneak a
photograph and false report into the paper
that members of the University's bowling
team died in a plane crash. The paper print
ed an apology and explanation of the hoax.
Today, sitting in those two especially
worn-out chairs are the current Old Boys (as
the editors in chief are called), Sam
Coggeshall 'l2 and Alex Hertz 'l3. As resi
dent Old Boys, the pair presides over the
publication of this year's issues and front the
Wednesday meetings (in case you're wonder
ing whether there have been female Old
Boys, the answer is yes).
Coggeshall, a spiffy-dressing senior with
a brown, curly fro and a goofy smile, and
Hertz, a clean-cut junior with a penchant for
chambray button-downs and a laid-back
grin (I don't know why I'm fixating on
