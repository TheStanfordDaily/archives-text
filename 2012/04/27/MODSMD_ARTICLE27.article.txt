# FESTIVALS
## CINEPHILE'S DELIGHT 
### â€“ alexandra HEENEY contact alexandra: aheeney@stanford. edu 
The San Francisco
International Film Festival
kicked off last Thursday, and
the crowds haven't waned since. The
main festival headquarters in
Japantown at the Sundance Kabuki
Cinemas and the San Francisco
Film Society Cinema are full of
excited cinephiles young and old,
there to take in films from all
around the world the way they were
meant to be seen: on the big screen,
with beautiful, crisp, clean, digital
projection.

Among the weekend's most
popular films were Norway's "Oslo,
August 31st" (reviewed in a previ
ous Intermission) and Italy's

"Terraforma," which had a series of
sold-out screenings and eager, last
minute planners in the rush lines.
Don't despair if you missed them,
though, as they are both scheduled
for theatrical releases this year.
If you haven't had a chance to
catch a film at the fest yet, there is
still plenty of time, as the festival
runs until May 3. Between now and
then, you can see Kenneth Branagh

up close at the Castro tonight,
where he will receive a directing
award and screen his early film
"Dead Again," or catch Yo La Tengo
doing a live score at the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art
for the documentary "The Love
Song for R. Buckminster Fuller" on
Tuesday (come early to make the
Rush line). In the meantime, here is
a taste of films that have already
screened and will be screening at the
festival in the coming week.

"Back to Stay"
This first feature by
Argentinean filmmaker Milagros
Mumenthaler is an astute and
observant film set in Buenos Aires,
following three college-age sisters
coming to terms with their grand
mother's recent death. The film
takes place almost entirely in the
house where they live, which they
inherited. It's a film about the
secrets the sisters keep, the alliances
that form within a family, the com
fort of sisters and the effect of the
space in which they live. We discov
er that many parts of the

house were oft limits when their
grandmother was alive, and we
watch as the girls explore these for
eign spaces in a home with which
they feel less and less connected.
Mumenthaler lingers on each
of the girls for takes that span min
utes, letting the wonderfully
nuanced performances really shine
as we see the signs of insecurities,
love and grief; these are especially
pronounced in the few scenes when
all three sisters are on camera in a
single shot, allowing us to see both
the private and communal
moments they share together and
how they trespass on each other's
privacy. At the center of the film is
the eldest sister, Marina, the most
down-to-earth one: shy, intelligent,
compassionate and insecure about
many things, including her body.
We watch as she copes with her sis
ter Sofia's secrecy and betrayals, and
as she looks on both disapprovingly
and enviously as Sofia uses sex to
earn attention; there is so much that
is unsaid between these two. "Back
