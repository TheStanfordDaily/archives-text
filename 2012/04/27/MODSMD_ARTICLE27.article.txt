# FESTIVALS
## CINEPHILE'S DELIGHT 
### â€“ alexandra HEENEY contact alexandra: aheeney@stanford. edu 
The San Francisco
International Film Festival
kicked off last Thursday, and
the crowds haven't waned since. The
main festival headquarters in
Japantown at the Sundance Kabuki
Cinemas and the San Francisco
Film Society Cinema are full of
excited cinephiles young and old,
there to take in films from all
around the world the way they were
meant to be seen: on the big screen,
with beautiful, crisp, clean, digital
projection.

Among the weekend's most
popular films were Norway's "Oslo,
August 31st" (reviewed in a previ
ous Intermission) and Italy's

"Terraforma," which had a series of
sold-out screenings and eager, last
minute planners in the rush lines.
Don't despair if you missed them,
though, as they are both scheduled
for theatrical releases this year.
If you haven't had a chance to
catch a film at the fest yet, there is
still plenty of time, as the festival
runs until May 3. Between now and
then, you can see Kenneth Branagh

up close at the Castro tonight,
where he will receive a directing
award and screen his early film
"Dead Again," or catch Yo La Tengo
doing a live score at the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art
for the documentary "The Love
Song for R. Buckminster Fuller" on
Tuesday (come early to make the
Rush line). In the meantime, here is
a taste of films that have already
screened and will be screening at the
festival in the coming week.

"Back to Stay"
This first feature by
Argentinean filmmaker Milagros
Mumenthaler is an astute and
observant film set in Buenos Aires,
following three college-age sisters
coming to terms with their grand
mother's recent death. The film
takes place almost entirely in the
house where they live, which they
inherited. It's a film about the
secrets the sisters keep, the alliances
that form within a family, the com
fort of sisters and the effect of the
space in which they live. We discov
er that many parts of the

house were oft limits when their
grandmother was alive, and we
watch as the girls explore these for
eign spaces in a home with which
they feel less and less connected.
Mumenthaler lingers on each
of the girls for takes that span min
utes, letting the wonderfully
nuanced performances really shine
as we see the signs of insecurities,
love and grief; these are especially
pronounced in the few scenes when
all three sisters are on camera in a
single shot, allowing us to see both
the private and communal
moments they share together and
how they trespass on each other's
privacy. At the center of the film is
the eldest sister, Marina, the most
down-to-earth one: shy, intelligent,
compassionate and insecure about
many things, including her body.
We watch as she copes with her sis
ter Sofia's secrecy and betrayals, and
as she looks on both disapprovingly
and enviously as Sofia uses sex to
earn attention; there is so much that
is unsaid between these two. "Back


Courtesy San Francisco Film Society
to Stay" is, in a sense, a coming-of-age story
as Marina gains confidence and deals with
her grief, and we learn that her sisters aren't
as put-together as she may have originally
believed. There isn't much plot so much as a
series of uneventful scenes in which
immense amounts of information about the
complexities of the characters are beautifully
revealed. It's best seen on a big screen where
you can get immersed in the rhythm of the
film and the spaces the characters inhabit,
and it's one of the best films at SFIFF.
"Bernie"
Richard Linklater's latest film, "Bernie,"
which will hit theatres in mid-May, may be a
disappointment to fans of his heady, dia
logue-driven films like "Waking Life" and
"Before Sunrise," but it is an improvement
from his recent string of mediocre, main-

stream films like "School of Rock" and "Bad
News Bears." "Bernie" is a mockumentary
based on the true story of Bernie Tiede (lack
Black), a mortician in Carthage, Texas, who
after befriending and then killing the univer
sally hated widow Marjorie (Shirley
MacLaine), seemed like he would actually be
acquitted because he was so well-liked in
town. Bernie is a perplexing character who
seems just as kind-hearted as he is a schem
ing opportunist, and it's left to the audience
to decide whether he befriended Marjorie in
pursuit of her fortune or as just a good
Samaritan. Linklater finds a good deal of
humor, if not laughs, in his myriad of inter
views with local characters full of local color
and by cleverly juxtaposing the serious and
ridiculous: a song-and-dance of "Seventy-Six
Trombones" abruptly follows Marjories

murder. But the film remains little more
than a moderately pleasant and fleeting dis
traction.
"Bonsai"
"Bonsai" centers on a painfully pathetic
aspiring writer, Julio, as he recounts his failed
college romance with a large dose of nostal
gia while encountering romantic strife in the
present. Julio claims to be working as the
amanuensis for a famous writer, but we real
ize that his supposed employment is a fic
tion. Since he has told his current romantic
interest about the job, he decides to fill note
books with his own prose instead. There are
a few perceptive moments about youthful
romance, like the pretensions of college stu
dents who decide they need to read Proust to
one another in bed, one page a day, expect
ing to be together long enough to finish their

optimistic journey through the novel. Yet the
film lacks narrative structure, and the multi
ple time periods make the film feel desultory
rather than working to unite themes and
show growth. Julio is also such a loser that
it's hard to care about his goings-on and feel
anything but sorry for the women he
encounters. There is some beautiful photog
raphy with rich colors and the omnipresent
image of the perfectly kept Bonsai tree
perhaps a metaphor for Julio's own sense of
the need to control his life but, on the
whole, the film falls flat.
