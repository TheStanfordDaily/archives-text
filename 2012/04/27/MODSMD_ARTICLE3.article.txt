# Queer series launches
## One-unit spring quarter class 'first of its kind at Stanford' 
### LINDSEY TXAKEEYANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As part of an ongoing effort to expand campus dia
logue of queer-related issues, the Stanford Program in
Feminist Studies and the Queer Studies Coalition have
collaborated on the University's first queer studies lec
ture series, which is offered this spring as a 1-unit class.
Queer studies postdoctoral fellow Shana Goldin-
Perschbacher called the series "the first of its kind at
Stanford." She teamed up with Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3,
undergraduate chair of the Queer Studies Coalition, to
coordinate the weekly event.
The class covers a range of topics, such as "By the
Numbers: Gays, Lesbians and Their Families in the US"
and "Queer History of Late Imperial China." Lecturers
come from various fields, with representatives from the
Department of Iberian and Latin American Cultures,
the Department of History and the Department of
Drama all participating in talks.
"We wanted it to be a space where people could
come and hear about queer studies and think about
how they could apply these methods and theories to
their own work, regardless of their field of study," Vaid-
Menon said. "I truly believe that queer critique and
analysis is interdisciplinary and crucial for people from
all academic backgrounds."
Both Vaid-Menon and Goldin-Perschbacher said
the series keeps up with the growing support of queer
studies on campus.
In September 2010, the ASSU passed a bill encour
aging the creation of a minor in queer studies.
According to Goldin-Perschbacher, a "queer studies
sub-plan" within the Feminist Studies major has been
approved by the Registrar's office since last summer,
and the Department of Feminist Studies is also working
to develop a Ph.D. minor in feminist and queer studies
in response to interest from graduate students.
"Stanford has been offering courses on queer stud
ies for many years, but thanks to the energy and enthu
siasm of student-led initiatives over many years, we're
adding more classes, a lecture series, a Book Salon [and]
a postdoctoral fellow," Goldin-Perschbacher said.
"The issue with queer studies is that because it's such
a foreign field to most of us, most people don't think it
has anything to do with them," Vaid-Menon said.
The definition on the Department of Feminist Stud
ies website describes queer studies as a "multi-discipli-
