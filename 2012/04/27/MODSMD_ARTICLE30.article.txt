Sometime near the end of
yesterday, Nintendo
released its annual summa
ry of the last fiscal year. Video
game financials? Boring, I know.
But the day's most interesting
event lies beyond the numbers.
With the industry's biggest
tradeshow barely five weeks
away, it's the last chance for
Nintendo to make a PR splash
before the lights come on at the
company's E3 conference in Los
Angeles. In this case, it's their
last chance to correct a mistake
before it blows up in their faces.
At last year's E3, Nintendo
took the veil off the first new
console the industry had seen
since 2006. With the original
Wii struggling to captivate the
fickle mainstream base that put
Nintendo on easy street for sev
eral years, this new set of hard
ware represented the company's
effort to not only reinvigorate
the average non-gamer, but to
bring its core fans back home by
stepping into the HD era
finally. As Nintendo of America
President Reggie Fils-Aime put
it, the Wii U was meant for
"you" and "me." But Nintendo's
showy confidence of June 2011
was undermined by a simple,
fatal misjudgment in marketing.
The new name, punchy as it
was, confused some, alienated
others and embarrassed the rest.
The stakes were higher than
ever, and Nintendo was going all
in with a hand that looked bad
to everyone at the table but
themselves.
