# DEAR NINTENDO,
## Take a mulligan on Wii U's name 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
Out of necessity, I'm writ
ing this just before the event I'm
referencing which, as I said,
already occurred. That might
sound like a backwards way to
write a column, but its relevance
isn't diminished even under the
admittedly curious circum
stances. This moment, though
quiet, is a pivotal one for
Nintendo. To properly capture
its uneasy tension, I need to com-

mit my thoughts without the
benefit of hindsight. If Nintendo
makes what I'd call the right
move, consider this an impas
sioned defense of that decision. If
not, the clock is ticking so
consider this the boldest warning
that an unpaid student-journalist
can possibly muster.
While the name "Wii" was
so boldly different that it turned
heads everywhere, adding a
pathetic relic of '9os online cha
trooms the "U", of course
is such a subtle change as to be
imperceptible. For the casual
gamers that Nintendo success

fully wooed with the "It's differ
ent!" approach of the Wii, the
intuitive conclusion is that a Wii
U is simply an add-on to the
one console they already have
sitting under their TVs. They
aren't familiar with typical hard
ware cycles or alternative gam
ing platforms, and they certainly
don't keep up with enthusiast
gaming news. The Wii U is just
another controller to them, like

the Wii Balance Board or Classic
Controller Pro, only this time
it's a tablet.
And who could blame
them? After all, Nintendo never
actually showed off the console
itself in any of its marketing
materials last year, but just trot
ted out a tablet with the Wii U
name slapped on it.
As a member of the old
Nintendo guard, meanwhile,
I'm not alone in saying that the
"Wii U" moniker is disappoint
ing. We accept the Wii for what
it is, but only under the once
safe assumption that Nintendo

would eventually come out of
the powder room and get down
to business, flexing its technical
muscles once again by making a
system that pushes boundaries
but still allows for the types of
games we grew up loving.
The continuation of the
Wii brand opens some old
wounds for us, and frankly, it
makes me a little sad to think
that Nintendo's most loyal sup
porters aren't at the top of their
priority list.
You might be wondering:
what would I name the new
console? It's not easy to say. I
understand why Nintendo
wants to keep its most success
ful brand name alive, especially
when continued failure means
reaching even deeper into the
war chest. That tactic was suc
cessful, after all, with the Game
Boy brand and a host of other
consoles. But subtitles like
"Color," "Advance" or "Pocket"
members of Game Boy line,
in this case carry self-evident
hints of real, qualitative differ
ences. The same can be said,
quite obviously, of numeric
titles like the Atari 7800, Xbox
360 and Play Station 2. So, my
suggestion? Keep it simple, stu
pid: Wii 2.
That's what my brain says,
anyway. My heart might prefer
something more ... original.
