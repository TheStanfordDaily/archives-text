## 'FIVE YEAR ENGAGEMENT' WORTH THE WAIT 
### â€“ misa SHIKUMA contact misa: mshikuma@stanford. edu 
Feeling more grown-up than
their first collaboration,
Jason Segel and Nicholas
Stoller's newest film "The Five-
Year Engagement," about a near
perfect couple that can't quite
seem to tie the knot, still main
tains that delicious mix of awk
ward realism, raunchy jokes and
sentimentality sans cheesiness that
made 2008's "Forgetting Sarah

Marshall" such a hit.
Unlike most romantic come
dies that culminate in happily
ever-after marriages, "The Five-
Year Engagement" begins with
sous-chef Tom's (Segel) proposal
to girlfriend Violet (Emily Blunt)
and charts the ups and downs that
follow. The couple's first hurdle
comes in the form of Violet's
acceptance to a post-doc psychol
ogy program at the University of
Michigan, which forces them to

uproot from their comfy Bay Area
for what initially promises to be
only two years. But, as the title
suggests, it isn't quite that simple.
While Violet flourishes in her
new academic environment, Tom
struggles to find his niche in the
gastronomically under-developed
college town. The more he feels as
though his career has stalled, hav
ing settled for making sandwiches
at a local delicatessen, the more
dissonant their lives seem to
become. Faced with constant pres
sure to wed from friends and fam
ily alike, Violet and Tom can't help
but wonder themselves if their
special day will ever come.
As much as the movie focuses
on Tom and Violet, the all-star
supporting cast should be reason
enough to see it. Alison Brie
("Community") steals scenes as
Violet's unintentionally upstaging

younger sister, while Mindy Kaling
("The Office"), as a snarky post
doc, never fails to deliver on laughs
every time her character tells it like
it is. Tom's newfound Midwest
friends, including a pickle enthusi
ast played by Brian Posehn ("Just
Shoot Me") and an emasculated
stay-at-home dad played by Chris
Parnell ("Saturday Night Live"),

are equally memorable.
Although the third act is
somewhat overextended, it's still
enjoyable because, having seen the
relationships flourish early on,
you care about the characters and
want to see them through
whether it means marital bliss or
going their separate ways and
being content in the knowledge

that they gave it a go. And to their
great credit, Blunt and Segel carry
the film with aplomb, managing
to be charismatic leads who still
feel relatable.
As the screenwriters, Segel
and Stoller go to town on gender
roles, poking fun at who wears the
pants in the relationship and why.
More generally, though, they
explore how one finds that bal
ance of maintaining self-fulfill
ment while keeping the other per
son happy. Life is messy, as is
demonstrated again and again,
with a tendency to get in the way
of what often seem like the best
laid plans. But, borrowing from
Violet's psychological experiments
(which, meta alert, figure promi
nently in the story), in the end,
even the worst of situations is
what you choose to make of it.
