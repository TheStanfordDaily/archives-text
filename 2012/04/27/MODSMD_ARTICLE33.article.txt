## GOING GREEN IN THE SHEETS ROXY SASS 
### 
Roxy's favorite color is usual
ly nude, but after three-plus
years at Stanford, she's
found herself partial to going
green. In the spirit of sustainability
(and because Roxy's hooked up
with her fair share of earth systems
majors), she's decided to offer
some tips on environmentally
friendly hookups.

Reduce, reuse, recycle
Roxy has tried to internalize the
principles of sustainability into all
aspects of her life. And while Roxy
isn't one to reduce her excesses, she
doesn't say no to occasionally recy
cling a boy from her past. Just, you
know, so he doesn't go to waste.
And for the reusing? Roxy's never
been known for her restraint; she
makes sure to reuse as many times
per night/day/between classes as
possible.

Save Water
Water is a precious resource, par
ticularly in California. Roxy
believes that it's possible to mini
mize your footprint while maxi
mizing ... other body parts. Try
cutting your water use in half by
showering with someone else. And
wearing less clothing is always a
good way to cut down on laundry.
Or, for the truly committed, hook
up outdoors so there are no sheets
to clean. When you're doing it for
the environment, no one can resist.

Save Energy
Turn each other on, not the lights:
"I'm sorry, would you mind if I
turned off the lights? I'm trying to
conserve energy." Alternatively,
Roxy's found that the best way to

save energy is switching off who's
on top. If you're lucky, Roxy might
even give you... LEED certifica
tion.
Some other tips
Roxy recently learned that having
babies is just about the worst thing
that you can do for the environ
ment. So if you feel like you're on
the verge of some major ahem
emissions, you'd better capture and
sequester them. Eating meat is also
pretty bad for the environment, so
Roxy suggests you cut down on
your meat consumption... out
side the bedroom, of course.

Know any climate change skeptics?
They may not believe in global
warming just yet, but Roxy can heat
things up beyond the point of denial.
