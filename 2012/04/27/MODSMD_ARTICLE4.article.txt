## Walzer probes morality in war 
### AARON SEKHRI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Arguing that "the good guys can win," Michael
Walzer, professor emeritus at the Institute for Ad
vanced Study, called for fixed and unambiguous
rules in war during a presentation at Annenberg
Auditorium Thursday night.
Walzer addressed a host of issues pertaining to
the morality of war and drew examples from many
conflicts past and present from all around the
world.
Debra Satz, the Marta Sutton Weeks Professor
of Ethics in Society, introduced Walzer as "the in
dividual who, more than any other, has established
political theories that have set the bar for thinking
and writing about war." Satz also praised his
"novel and formidable approach to political phi
losophy."
Walzer began by describing "moral dilemmas
in asymmetric wars as the most important current
challenge to the current principles of just war the
ory." This challenge pits armed forces' desire for
victory against their desire to act justly, he said.
According to Walzer, this dilemma is the prod
uct of "increasingly significant, small-scale non
state actors, insurgents and terrorist organiza
tions" that resort to unconventional warfare to
further their interests.
"The problem is that one side says that the rules
put in place penalize them for their weakness,"
Walzer said. "And the other says that the enemy's
violation of those rules leaves them with no other
options."
Putting forward his central premise, Walzer
said that "the argument that to win wars you must
stray from the rules of war will be shown as
wrong."
Fie also stressed using public opinion as an ar
bitrator for the standards of war and called for a
need to assess what victory truly means. Walzer ar-
gued against using proportional
ity as an argument for civilian
losses and using one side's bel
ligerence against civilians to jus
tify retaliatory actions.
"It is not enough to not intend
to kill civilians," Walzer said, "but
to intend not to kill civilians."
Walzer did, however, concede
that in the most extreme of situa
tions some conventional rules of
war can perhaps be subverted.
"The controversial doctrine of
supreme urgency is important to
consider," Walzer said. "Self-de
fense, in the context of an enor
mous looming danger, may allow
an entity to violate the rules of just
war."
He qualified this statement by
reiterating that this sort of bel
ligerence would absolutely re
quire that the war be a just reac
tion to a large impending threat.
Walzer argued against attempt
ing to justify violations of the rules
of war, asserting that "claims of le
gitimacy, conviction and justifica
tion cannot be the arbitrators of
justice." He furthermore ex
pressed the need to inculcate

armed forces with understanding.
"Incompetence breeds brutali
ty," Walzer said. "I acknowledge
that in the heat of battle some may
lose their bearings, but well
trained and well-disciplined
armies are less brutal."
He praised the work of retired
U.S. General Stanley McChrystal
as stressing this belief and ap
plauded his value system that
"morality and strategy can unite,
and that it is important to some
times take on more risk to prevent
civilian harm."
The presentation was well-re
ceived, with one spectator publicly
thanking Walzer for "the opportu
nity to simply hear you think," a
statement that met great applause.
However, there were some
who had mixed feelings about
Walzer's thesis.
"There's a fine line between
'rules' and 'laws' that Walzer ac
knowledges," said Paul Bator, a
lecturer in the Program in Writ
ing and Rhetoric, "Whether the
'rules' have become more strin
gent or whether the enforcement
of such rules by international
courts of war has become more
stringently applied is worth con
sidering."
