## Profs weigh in on Republican VP prospects Hoover senior fellow Condoleezza Rice tops list, expresses no interest 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
With his sweep of five primaries Tues
day, former Massachusetts governor
Mitt Romney continues to consolidate
his grip on the Republican presidential
nomination, causing media attention to
shift to his selection of a running mate.
Stanford professors disagreed about just
how important Romney's choice may be
come November.
Speculation has recently revolved
around Romney picking Condoleezza
Rice, a senior fellow at the Hoover Insti
tution and former University provost, as
his running mate. Rice, who served as
Secretary of State during the George W.
Bush administration, received the most
support among likely Republican voters
in a CNN/ORC International survey re
leased last week.
The survey asked registered Republi
cans and right-leaning independent vot
ers to choose eight names they would
like to see as Romney's vice president.
Rice was the frontrunner with 26 percent
of the vote. Pennsylvania Senator Rick
Santorum, who recently bowed out of
the presidential race, came in second
with 21 percent. New Jersey Governor
Chris Christie and Senator Marco Rubio
(R-Fla.) tied for third at 14 percent.
According to Bill Whalen, a Hoover
research fellow, the number one pick in
the polls "doesn't always pan out."
