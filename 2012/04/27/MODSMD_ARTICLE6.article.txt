## Profs weigh in on Republican VP prospects Hoover senior fellow Condoleezza Rice tops list, expresses no interest 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
With his sweep of five primaries Tues
day, former Massachusetts governor
Mitt Romney continues to consolidate
his grip on the Republican presidential
nomination, causing media attention to
shift to his selection of a running mate.
Stanford professors disagreed about just
how important Romney's choice may be
come November.
Speculation has recently revolved
around Romney picking Condoleezza
Rice, a senior fellow at the Hoover Insti
tution and former University provost, as
his running mate. Rice, who served as
Secretary of State during the George W.
Bush administration, received the most
support among likely Republican voters
in a CNN/ORC International survey re
leased last week.
The survey asked registered Republi
cans and right-leaning independent vot
ers to choose eight names they would
like to see as Romney's vice president.
Rice was the frontrunner with 26 percent
of the vote. Pennsylvania Senator Rick
Santorum, who recently bowed out of
the presidential race, came in second
with 21 percent. New Jersey Governor
Chris Christie and Senator Marco Rubio
(R-Fla.) tied for third at 14 percent.
According to Bill Whalen, a Hoover
research fellow, the number one pick in
the polls "doesn't always pan out."
Rice has repeatedly denied in
terest in running as vice president.
In a March segment of Fox News'
"Fox and Friends," Rice responded
to questions about whether she
would serve as Romney's running
mate by saying, "How many ways
can I say it? Not me."
A poll released by the Quinnip
iac University Polling Institute last
Thursday put Christie, Rubio and
Representative Paul Ryan (R-
Wisc.) as the leads for possible
Romney running mates.
Whalen agreed that it would be
a departure for Rice to seek the
vice presidency.
"She leads the good life at
Stanford," Whalen said.
While Whalen said that history
indicates running mates "[don't]
mean much in the course of the
election," Jon Krosnick, professor
of communication and political
science, had a different view
about the potential influence of a
vice presidential pick.
"It can be terrifically impor
tant," Krosnick said. "Research
has shown that the more voters
who like the vice president pick,
the more likely people are to vote
for that candidate."
According to Krosnick, all
other factors being equal, the vice
president pick can be the one fac

tor that can push a candidate for
ward.
"It won't make a big differ
ence, but it's very likely to make a
difference," he added.
Whalen and Krosnick agreed
that the vice president candidate
is frequently chosen to compen
sate for any weak points in the
presidential candidate.
"Romney's vulnerability lies
with women and Hispanics,"
Whalen said. "Rice covers those
two categories and she also ap
peals to African American vot
ers."
According to Krosnick, one
factor that was on the minds of
voters in the 2008 presidential
election was Republican nominee
John McCain's age. As a result,
Krosnick said McCain chose

Sarah Palin someone who was
young enough to compensate for
his weak point.
"The second problem McCain
had was that he was a Washington
insider," Krosnick added. "Obama
was young and an outsider and
could claim that he knew how the
government worked from the in
side, but had not been in too long.
McCain needed to get someone
who'd been in Washington even
less."
However, Krosnick said the

same isn't true this time around.
"In this case,it's no problem for
Romney to make the claim that
he's a Washington outsider and
youthful enough [as compared to
Obama]," Krosnick said.
He added that in 2008 the ener
gy was around the historic nature
of the election because an
African-American was running.
"Now, it's an interesting ques
tion for Republicans to see the
value in trying to make history as
well," he said, adding that it might
create positive attention if Rom
ney chose a female to be his run
ning mate.
According to Whalen, there
are a handful of states that can
change the election.
"Romney cannot win without
Ohio and Florida, so he might
look for a politician who could be
a difference between those
states," Whalen said.
Media have pointed to Senator
Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and
Rubio as two candidates who may
help Romney carry those states.
When asked about other possi
bilities, Whalen said there is a
process to predicting.
"Keep an eye out for who he
campaigns with," he said. "Paul

Ryan, Chris Christie. See who
shows up with him the next few
month, whose finances they look at
and who all is asked to hand in pa
pers."
"If Rice and others make state
ments about not wanting it, see
who keeps the door open," Whalen
added. "You never say you want it
but you can say you don't want it.
Everyone's been a little coy so see
who keeps the door open."
Whalen said that what the pub
lic sees and what the campaign sees
are two very different things.
"In 1992, Bill Clinton surprised
everyone with A1 Gore, which rein
forced their message," Whalen
said. "In 2000, Bush picked Ch
eney, which made foreign policy
sense for them and played out pret
ty well."
According to Krosnick, some
thing that may help Romney make
a statement would be to select a
running mate who would become a
signal for voters to pay attention,
similar to McCain's choice of Palin.
But "at the end of the day, it's
between Romney and Obama,"
Whalen said.

tant," Krosnick said. "Research
has shown that the more voters
who like the vice president pick,
the more likely people are to vote
for that candidate."
According to Krosnick, all
other factors being equal, the vice
president pick can be the one fac

tor that can push a candidate for
ward.
"It won't make a big differ
ence, but it's very likely to make a
difference," he added.
Whalen and Krosnick agreed
that the vice president candidate
is frequently chosen to compen
sate for any weak points in the
presidential candidate.
"Romney's vulnerability lies
with women and Hispanics,"
Whalen said. "Rice covers those
two categories and she also ap
peals to African American vot
ers."
According to Krosnick, one
factor that was on the minds of
voters in the 2008 presidential
election was Republican nominee
John McCain's age. As a result,
Krosnick said McCain chose

Sarah Palin someone who was
young enough to compensate for
his weak point.
"The second problem McCain
had was that he was a Washington
insider," Krosnick added. "Obama
was young and an outsider and
could claim that he knew how the
government worked from the in
side, but had not been in too long.
McCain needed to get someone
who'd been in Washington even
less."
However, Krosnick said the

same isn't true this time around.
"In this case,it's no problem for
Romney to make the claim that
he's a Washington outsider and
youthful enough [as compared to
Obama]," Krosnick said.
He added that in 2008 the ener
gy was around the historic nature
of the election because an
African-American was running.
"Now, it's an interesting ques
tion for Republicans to see the
value in trying to make history as
well," he said, adding that it might
create positive attention if Rom
ney chose a female to be his run
ning mate.
According to Whalen, there
are a handful of states that can
change the election.
"Romney cannot win without
Ohio and Florida, so he might
look for a politician who could be
a difference between those
states," Whalen said.
Media have pointed to Senator
Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and
Rubio as two candidates who may
help Romney carry those states.
When asked about other possi
bilities, Whalen said there is a
process to predicting.
"Keep an eye out for who he
campaigns with," he said. "Paul

Ryan, Chris Christie. See who
shows up with him the next few
month, whose finances they look at
and who all is asked to hand in pa
pers."
"If Rice and others make state
ments about not wanting it, see
who keeps the door open," Whalen
added. "You never say you want it
but you can say you don't want it.
Everyone's been a little coy so see
who keeps the door open."
Whalen said that what the pub
lic sees and what the campaign sees
are two very different things.
"In 1992, Bill Clinton surprised
everyone with A1 Gore, which rein
forced their message," Whalen
said. "In 2000, Bush picked Ch
eney, which made foreign policy
sense for them and played out pret
ty well."
According to Krosnick, some
thing that may help Romney make
a statement would be to select a
running mate who would become a
signal for voters to pay attention,
similar to McCain's choice of Palin.
But "at the end of the day, it's
between Romney and Obama,"
Whalen said.

With his sweep of five primaries Tues
day, former Massachusetts governor
Mitt Romney continues to consolidate
his grip on the Republican presidential
nomination, causing media attention to
shift to his selection of a running mate.
Stanford professors disagreed about just
how important Romney's choice may be
come November.
Speculation has recently revolved
around Romney picking Condoleezza
Rice, a senior fellow at the Hoover Insti
tution and former University provost, as
his running mate. Rice, who served as
Secretary of State during the George W.
Bush administration, received the most
support among likely Republican voters
in a CNN/ORC International survey re
leased last week.
The survey asked registered Republi
cans and right-leaning independent vot
ers to choose eight names they would
like to see as Romney's vice president.
Rice was the frontrunner with 26 percent
of the vote. Pennsylvania Senator Rick
Santorum, who recently bowed out of
the presidential race, came in second
with 21 percent. New Jersey Governor
Chris Christie and Senator Marco Rubio
(R-Fla.) tied for third at 14 percent.
According to Bill Whalen, a Hoover
research fellow, the number one pick in
the polls "doesn't always pan out."
Rice has repeatedly denied in
terest in running as vice president.
In a March segment of Fox News'
"Fox and Friends," Rice responded
to questions about whether she
would serve as Romney's running
mate by saying, "How many ways
can I say it? Not me."
A poll released by the Quinnip
iac University Polling Institute last
Thursday put Christie, Rubio and
Representative Paul Ryan (R-
Wisc.) as the leads for possible
Romney running mates.
Whalen agreed that it would be
a departure for Rice to seek the
vice presidency.
"She leads the good life at
Stanford," Whalen said.
While Whalen said that history
indicates running mates "[don't]
mean much in the course of the
election," Jon Krosnick, professor
of communication and political
science, had a different view
about the potential influence of a
vice presidential pick.
