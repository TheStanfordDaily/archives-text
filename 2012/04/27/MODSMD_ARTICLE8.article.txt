## Sahami stresses tech education Lack of technological knowledge rooted in K-12 schooling, CS professor says 
### FELIX BOYEAUX 
"Everyone here is going to be a leader in their
field," said Mehran Sahami, an associate profes
sor in computer science, Thursday during a
lunchtime talk at Old Union. "If you understand
that technology will have a huge impact in the fu
ture and educate yourself accordingly, you will
be able to make decisions that impact other peo
ple's lives."
During the event, organized by Stanford in
Government (SIG) as part of the Policy Lunch
program, Sahami spoke about the importance of
technical education in today's globally connect
ed world.
"Technology plays a huge role in everyone's
life," he said. "The biggest problem with our
country is that our public policies have not been
able to follow this development."
According to Sahami, the issues are concen
trated within three major areas: cybersecurity, in
tellectual property and education. Bringing up
issues such as the Stuxnet virus and stock market
flash crashes, Sahami emphasized the major se
curity breaches that our increasingly virtual soci
ety faces.
"Think about what would happen if the credit
card system were to go down," Sahami told the 30
students who were present in the conference
room.
"You might just be worried that you will not be
able to buy your pizza, but the dangers are much
bigger than that," he added, referring to the immi
nent collapse of our country's economy if such a
breakdown were to occur.
Similarly, Sahami denounced the patent frenzy
that is currently sweeping over the United States.
"Intellectual property is one of those things
that for a while did not get the play that it is get
ting now," he said. According to Sahami, compa
nies now have to give in to enormous cross-licens
ing deals in order to benefit from the patent port
folios of other companies.
"There is serious money that is being put into
this game," he added. "When patents are award
ed for things that your high school friends could
have done, it is clear that we are stifling technical
innovation. When there is a need for such cross
licensing deals, it probably means that we are
awarding patents for things that are not so novel
after all."
Sahami argued that the people who push for
intellectual property policies would benefit from
having a stronger technical background.
"Patent lawyers who have no technical back
ground .. .are clearly under-qualified to deal
which such applications," he said. "There is no
doubt about that."
According to Sahami, the problem begins
with the K-12 system.
"Computer science is neither considered as
math or as a science, but rather as vocational
training," Sahami said. He added that "students
come to Stanford with an excellent training in
math and English, but almost no computer liter
acy."
He argued that this is due to a fundamental
problem in policy-making, saying that it is not be
cause of a lack of student interest, but schools
have not properly advocated the importance of
technological education.
"How come Palo Alto High School, across the
street from arguably the best computer science
institution in the world does not even offer AP
Computer Science?" Sahami asked.
He concluded his talk by challenging every
one present to take action.
"I would encourage you to get the technical
background to address the problems that you
see. Try to inform yourself from the technological
perspective," Sahami said.
Student attendees were enthusiastic about the
talk.
"Technology has always been what humanity
has been pushing to make better use of re
sources," said Zhe Zhang, a second year coterm
student in environmental engineering who at
tended the lunch. "Professor Sahami brought up
very interesting points and left me interested in
such issues for the future."
