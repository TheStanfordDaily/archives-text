## EDITORIAL 'Work hard, play hard' not healthy 
### 
£ £ "1 >f" or k hard, play hard" is
l\/l somewhat of a norma
1V Alive ideal at Stanford.
When asked to characterize Stan
ford students, many of us are proud
to proclaim it; it's even part of the
official motto of Stanford's chapter
of Alpha Kappa Psi, the business
fraternity. Under this mentality, all
nighters are viewed with awe and re
spect, as is winning a game of beer
pong after pounding down ten shots.
One potential reason why the
"work hard,play hard" mindset is so
popular is because it connotes no
tions of a balanced life. But is it real
ly a balance to have two long nights
of partying after averaging five
hours of sleep per night in the week
beforehand? Simply put, the "work
hard, play hard" mentality leaves lit
tle room for personal wellness. If
anything, it suggests that the stresses
induced by intense academic and
extracurricular schedules can be
overcome by partying, drinking
and/or doing drugs. Instead, these
behaviors only serve to mask the re
ality of the situation.
In 2001, David Brooks labeled
Princeton students as "Future
Workaholics of America." Across
the country and eleven years later,
this label still seems appropriate. At
Stanford, merely taking classes at
one of the most rigorous universi
ties is not enough; we pile on vari
ous other commitments: athletics,
part-time jobs, public service, per
forming arts, research, start-ups,
you name it. Most of the time, we
decide to pursue these activities of
our own accord, out of genuine in
terest. As Brooks wrote, "promises
of enjoyable work abound." And
yet, our myriad commitments in
variably add stress to our lives and,
quite often, a feeling of being over
whelmed.
But whereas it is relatively
straightforward to identify the ex
cesses of playing hard, such as alco
hol-induced vomiting and hang
overs, it is not always as easy to recog
nize the dangers of being overcom
mitted. For instance, studies show
that sleep deprivation and excessive
stress are linked to increased rates of
heart disease, obesity and other ef
fects that are only apparent in the
long run. And while the workaholic
lifestyle can be emotionally damag
ing in the short-term, these effects are
subtle and hard to attribute to any
one cause. Even when a student is

able to recognize that excessive work
is having immediate effects on his
well-being, there is not always a sim
ple solution to the problem beyond
riding out tough times. Many com
mon commitments on campus are
difficult to drop mid-year.
For its part, the administration
has worked hard to address the ex
cesses of the play hard mentality, at
least with regard to alcohol con
sumption. Alcohol Edu, the "open
door practice," publicizing the "so
cial zone," and other endeavors such
as the OAPE's Cardinal Nights pro
gram all aim toward this end. But
while the administration has been
very active in promoting responsible
drinking, we feel it has spent relative
ly less time on the other side of the
equation: teaching students how
working hard, if done excessively,
can be hazardous to one's health.
Certainly, there are services on
campus, like The Bridge and CAPS,
designed to help students deal with
the effects of excess stress. But little is
done to address the root of the prob
lem. During New Student Orienta
tion (NSO), for instance, we learn
about many of the opportunities
available on campus, but not how to
prioritize or say no to any of them. In
fact, some common orientation tra
ditions only encourage us to feel as
though we should do more. Take, for
instance, the first welcome at Admit
Weekend when we learn about the
amazing accomplishments of a select
number of our peers. This is in
evitably followed by some affirma
tion of how "we all belong at Stan
ford."The overall message, however,
is concerning: You belong here, but
work extremely hard because these
are the kinds of people with which
you'll be taking classes.
We are not advocating for stu
dents to shirk all their commitments,
or for administrators to encourage
such behavior. Working hard, from
our perspective, is better than hardly
working, and it is only natural for stu
dents to want to take advantage of
the many opportunities Stanford of
fers. What we view as problematic is
taking on too much, sleeping too lit
tle, being too stressed and not dialing
back because "everyone else does it
too." In short, we hope that students
can start to better understand the
physical and mental consequences of
their lifestyles, and we ask that the ad
ministration play a more active role
in this regard.
