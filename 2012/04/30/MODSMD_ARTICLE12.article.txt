## California Avenue: A street to call our own 
### MATT WALTER '14 
Just a few blocks south on El
Camino from Stanford campus
lies a shopping and dining oasis
that most students have never even
heard of, let alone visited. On paper,
California Avenue appears to be a
perfect college student destination.
The oddball cousin of University
Ave, it is full of mom and pop stores
and hole-in-the-wall eateries and
features a yoga studio, nightclub and
even a weekly farmers market.
So why don't students ever go
there?

Because Cal Ave is dated and in
dire need of a makeover. Quirky, in
dependent shops suffer from a gray
streetscape, unbearable traffic and
poor pedestrian environment, with
benches far and few between. De
spite the great food and shopping,
the street lacks the color and com
fort to keep bringing people back.
At one time University Avenue
faced similar woes, but a massive
renovation injected new life into the
street. While it can still be difficult to
find parking, aesthetic improve
ments have made the street much
more attractive than California Ave.
But University is different in
stead of mom and pop stores, trendy
restaurants and luxury outlet stores
pepper the swanky commercial cen
ter of Palo Alto. Not exactly a college
student haven. California Ave has
the potential to become the street
we call our own and it could hap
pen sooner rather than later.
A restructuring plan for the Cal
Ave streetscape has been in the
works for a number of years, but has
faced fierce opposition from local
merchants, even before the City
Council voted unanimously to ap
prove the project in February 2011.

The plan, which calls for widened
sidewalks, raised crosswalks, ex
panded seating and planting areas,
and most notably a reduction from
four lanes of traffic to two, would un
doubtedly improve the street's
pedestrian access. This would be a
boon for Cal Ave businesses, but
merchants are concerned that the
lane reduction would disrupt traffic
and dissuade drivers from shopping
on the street.
The city has faced multiple law
suits from business owners arguing
that the plan's Environmental Im
pact Report — required by state law
for virtually any major construction
project — failed to recognize the po
tential business closures that would
result. The charges are bogus, but
they have still managed to hurt the
project by delaying construction for
as long as a year.
This stand taken by Cal Ave's
merchants is unfortunate for the city,
which is losing grant money as the
project is delayed longer and longer.
It is unfortunate for the business
owners of the street, some of whom
exhibit a surprising short-sighted
ness about the construction impacts
and potential long-term benefits of
construction on California Avenue.
And it is unfortunate for the resi
dents of Palo Alto, including Stan
ford students, who are missing out
on a beautified commercial and en
tertainment center.
It is in everyone's best interests
for these lawsuits to be dropped and
the project to advance as quickly as
possible. The street will be safer,
cleaner and better looking as a re
sult. There is demand in the Palo
Alto community for an alternative
to University Avenue, and progress
shouldn't be slowed by the short
sighted fears of a handful of mer-
