## A
						Stanford education and 'social engagement' 
### Miles Unterreiner 
The purpose of a university ed
ucation can sometimes seem a
self-evident truth, on par with
life, liberty and the fact that Cal
sucks. The modern university, after
all, obviously exists to promote
learning and instill knowledge; to
equip its students with a set of tech
nical skills; and to provide a safe,
open space in which the intellect
may thrive and develop.
But might intellectual goals
alone constitute too narrow a vision,
too humble an ambition, too timid
an aspiration for a university that has
always dreamed for better?
In a landmark 1837 speech to
Harvard's Phi Beta Kappa Society,
Ralph Waldo Emerson famously
defined the "American Scholar" as a
man of energetic action as well as
nuanced and advanced intellect.
Emerson urged each student to be
come more than what he called a
"mere thinker" to become
something larger than the accumu
lated library of his inner knowledge,
to mold each man's being into
something greater than the sum of
his intellectual parts. The great
American thinker and poet con
cluded with his now-famous asser
tion that "character is higher than
intellect" that the scholar's mind
is not his only implement, not even
his defining one.
Emerson understood the dis
tinction between mind and soul, and
knew that a finely honed intellect
could flourish in men and women of
empty spirit. But he had higher aspi
rations for the American university;
Emerson had the audacity to dream
of a curriculum that shaped its stu
dents into complete moral beings,
rather than mere soulless vehicles
for the transmission and acquisition

of knowledge.
In his wonderful essay "The Dis
parity between Intellect and Char
acter," Harvard professor Robert
Coles tells the story of a brilliant
moral philosophy student who
treated his housekeeper, a fellow
undergraduate at Harvard forced to
clean rooms to pay her way through
school, with the same respect he
might give the trash she picked up.
One day this young woman entered
Coles' office in tears. "I've been tak
ing all these philosophy courses, and
we talk about what's true, what's im
portant, what's good," she cried.
"Well, how do you teach people to
begood?"
Coles knew, as did Emerson,
that the disparity between intellect
and character can be mapped onto
the distinction between thought
and action that what one has in
side his head matters much less
than what he does with it.This is not
a new or original idea indeed, it
amounts to scarcely more than the
old adage that actions speak louder
than words.
But ought a university, in fact,
teach people to "be good"? How
can we teach each student to pursue
what John Rawls termed her "con
ception of the good" without impos
ing a standardized, cookie-cutter
picture of what that good looks like?
As we argue about the perils and
benefits of social engagement in
side the classroom, I have to admit
that I don't know the answer. But I
do know that there is a role for the
modern university in wedding the
power of the rigorous mind to the
wisdom that comes with moral
character.
In his 1957 classic "Flowers for
Algernon," Daniel Keyes tells the

heartbreaking story of Charlie Gor
don, a mentally disabled man who
undergoes an experimental proce
dure to increase his IQ. We are intro
duced to a Charlie whose problem
solving skills are inferior to those of
Algernon, a mouse in the lab. Soon,
Charlie's mind outstrips that of the
doctors who engineered his trans
formation.
But he is no happier, no more se
cure, no friendlier. Charlie's being is
no more morally valuable than it
was before the surgery; his newly
powerful intellect serves only to
give him a clearer appreciation of
the faults and foibles of humankind.
As he stands before the group of in
tellectually brilliant but morally
empty scientists who made him who
he is, Charlie finally shouts that
"there's one thing you've all over
looked: intelligence and education
that hasn't been tempered by
human affection isn't worth a
damn."
Stanford has always been a
school of doers, of men and women
of action and energy employed in
the service of visible achievement.
The "College of the West," David
Starr Jordan wrote in 1904, is home
to no "dewy-eyed monk," no
"stoop-shouldered grammarian."
The true Stanford scholar is the
"leader of enterprise, the builder of
states."
As we pursue Jordan's vision,
let's not forget the words of Emer
son, Coles, and Keyes. We have
work to do.

fection to temper all that knowledge
he's accumulated here at Stanford?
