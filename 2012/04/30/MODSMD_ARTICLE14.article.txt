# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## Reasons we relate 
### Nina Chung 
My interest in relationships
colors everything I do. I
majored in IR because I
love the idea of countries in contact:
the EU as a fractious clique or
North Korea trying to prove
stronger than the South. I chose to
study languages that would help me
communicate with distant relatives
(and a long-lost babysitter). My dad
once dubbed me "Little Ms. Chat
terbox" and still all I want to do is
have conversations with people
about what they care about. In fact,
over years of talking with close
friends who think similarly to me, I
almost got to thinking that this was
everyone's way of navigating social
waters here at Stanford.
But that's a hefty assumption.
Despite our common age range, the
motivations behind our relationship
choices are radically diverse. The
differences are audible in the con
tent of our chatter, visible in our so
cial choices and embedded in our
daily schedules. Ultimately, many of
us are looking for very different
things in the people around us, and
these are just three I've noticed.
Casual company: Because in a sea
of strangers and unknowns, even
small talk is a lifeboat. I remember
freshman year, when many of us
were roaming around campus in
constant mobs, or swarming campus
parties in well-dressed gangs. Within
10 weeks, BFF statuses were fixed,
sexiling was in full swing and long
term plans with recent acquaintanc
es were ambitiously scheduled.
For me, most of these rapidly
settled associations unraveled by
the next year. The initial ease had a
lot of spirit, but little depth to show
for itself. In retrospect, "No one ac

tually knew me "is a common agree
ment. That sense of anonymity isn't
exclusive to freshman year, but it's
certainly a time we see how much
we value simple sociability as quick
fix relief from a deeper displace
ment.

Physical intimacy: Because we
know that personal intimacy can
manifest itself physically, and it's
easier to attempt the physical part
first. This modern perception is well
exemplified in the fact that "Sex &
Love" or "Sex & Relationships" is
the name of that section in the most
popular women's magazines. I'm
not sure if the overall assumption is
that physicality leads to ideal rela
tionships or vice versa, but I'm pret
ty sure it's one of them.
Otherwise, hooking up is a pre
ferred way to "scratch that itch," as a
friend recently described it. Inter
estingly, this kind of connection has
everything to do with an internal
need, and nothing to do with the
other person. Then again, repeated
hooking up can actually slip into
something committed, if "boyfriend
and girlfriend" titling seems like the
logical next step. It's a trendy view
that physical and emotional interac
tions are mostly equivalent, so this
process probably seems pretty natu
ral. In general, college is a common
place where many of us decide how
successful or realistic these ap
proaches are for us. It's not political
and it's not economic, but the defini
tion of an ideal romantic relation
ship is probably one of the starkest
and most rarely debated cultural di
vides on campus.

A place to give: Because some
Stanford students concern them-

selves primarily with their time and
energy and giving it away as much
as they can. This, for me, has been
the most unique perspective on
friendship and love I've ever en
countered. It has also redefined
loaded phrases like "public serv
ice" and "social justice," which I
once assumed were meant for ex
pensive organizations or students'
future careers. I judged too soon.
Some students now have been su
pervising overnight shifts at Night
Outreach's homeless shelter
(which closed Sunday) despite bad
sleep and class the next morning.
There have been past Operation
Hot Cocoas, where students served
warm things to late-night studiers
during finals weeknights. There are
students in the houses and dorms
who just seem eternally ready to
help you, not to be something
themselves, but to think first of you.
The motivations here are actual
ly really odd, as they ignore the ideal
of perfect equality. Yet some stu
dents are seeking it, convinced that
giving what they've got is the best
"good" they'll ever find.
At Admit Weekend four years
ago, a Stanford authority said that
this University's greatest resource
was its people. Four years later, I'm
still convinced that this is true. For
zero credits, it's here I've learned
that relationships can be driven by
extremely different objectives. We
have choices. And if relationships
are as powerful as we say they are,
recognizing which choice we're
making could be crucial.

and most rarely debated cultural di
vides on campus.

A place to give: Because some
Stanford students concern them-

selves primarily with their time and
energy and giving it away as much
as they can. This, for me, has been
the most unique perspective on
friendship and love I've ever en
countered. It has also redefined
loaded phrases like "public serv
ice" and "social justice," which I
once assumed were meant for ex
pensive organizations or students'
future careers. I judged too soon.
Some students now have been su
pervising overnight shifts at Night
Outreach's homeless shelter
(which closed Sunday) despite bad
sleep and class the next morning.
There have been past Operation
Hot Cocoas, where students served
warm things to late-night studiers
during finals weeknights. There are
students in the houses and dorms
who just seem eternally ready to
help you, not to be something
themselves, but to think first of you.
The motivations here are actual
ly really odd, as they ignore the ideal
of perfect equality. Yet some stu
dents are seeking it, convinced that
giving what they've got is the best
"good" they'll ever find.
At Admit Weekend four years
ago, a Stanford authority said that
this University's greatest resource
was its people. Four years later, I'm
still convinced that this is true. For
zero credits, it's here I've learned
that relationships can be driven by
extremely different objectives. We
have choices. And if relationships
are as powerful as we say they are,
recognizing which choice we're
making could be crucial.

My interest in relationships
colors everything I do. I
majored in IR because I
love the idea of countries in contact:
the EU as a fractious clique or
North Korea trying to prove
stronger than the South. I chose to
study languages that would help me
communicate with distant relatives
(and a long-lost babysitter). My dad
once dubbed me "Little Ms. Chat
terbox" and still all I want to do is
have conversations with people
about what they care about. In fact,
over years of talking with close
friends who think similarly to me, I
almost got to thinking that this was
everyone's way of navigating social
waters here at Stanford.
But that's a hefty assumption.
Despite our common age range, the
motivations behind our relationship
choices are radically diverse. The
differences are audible in the con
tent of our chatter, visible in our so
cial choices and embedded in our
daily schedules. Ultimately, many of
us are looking for very different
things in the people around us, and
these are just three I've noticed.
Casual company: Because in a sea
of strangers and unknowns, even
small talk is a lifeboat. I remember
freshman year, when many of us
were roaming around campus in
constant mobs, or swarming campus
parties in well-dressed gangs. Within
10 weeks, BFF statuses were fixed,
sexiling was in full swing and long
term plans with recent acquaintanc
es were ambitiously scheduled.
For me, most of these rapidly
settled associations unraveled by
the next year. The initial ease had a
lot of spirit, but little depth to show
for itself. In retrospect, "No one ac

tually knew me "is a common agree
ment. That sense of anonymity isn't
exclusive to freshman year, but it's
certainly a time we see how much
we value simple sociability as quick
fix relief from a deeper displace
ment.

Physical intimacy: Because we
know that personal intimacy can
manifest itself physically, and it's
easier to attempt the physical part
first. This modern perception is well
exemplified in the fact that "Sex &
Love" or "Sex & Relationships" is
the name of that section in the most
popular women's magazines. I'm
not sure if the overall assumption is
that physicality leads to ideal rela
tionships or vice versa, but I'm pret
ty sure it's one of them.
Otherwise, hooking up is a pre
ferred way to "scratch that itch," as a
friend recently described it. Inter
estingly, this kind of connection has
everything to do with an internal
need, and nothing to do with the
other person. Then again, repeated
hooking up can actually slip into
something committed, if "boyfriend
and girlfriend" titling seems like the
logical next step. It's a trendy view
that physical and emotional interac
tions are mostly equivalent, so this
process probably seems pretty natu
ral. In general, college is a common
place where many of us decide how
successful or realistic these ap
proaches are for us. It's not political
and it's not economic, but the defini
tion of an ideal romantic relation
ship is probably one of the starkest
and most rarely debated cultural di
vides on campus.
