## Men's volley robbed by the NCAA 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Every March, dozens of col
lege basketball teams
wait anxiously for a selec
tion committee to decide
their postseason fate.
Coaches go on television making
their team's case, resumes are com
pared in hundreds of different ways
and the word "bubble" gets thrown
around approximately 12,000 times
per second. Months and months of
hard work get boiled down to a few
numbers and the opinions of a group
of old men in a room on one Sunday
afternoon, leaving several good
teams left outside the Big Dance.
And there's nothing the players can
do about it.
Compared to men's volleyball,
though, basketball players have a
Cakewalk.
Imagine being a team that domi
nates throughout the season, ranking
as high as No. 1 while finishing in a
close second in by far the best confer
ence in the nation. In your confer
ence tournament, you come inches
away from winning, eventually blow
ing a lead to the No. 2 team in the
country in the tournament final. Still,
as the No. 3 team in the nation, what's
to worry about?
In basketball or nearly any other
collegiate sport, there wouldn't be a
worry, as your only question would
be about seeding in the NCAA tour
nament. Unfortunately for the play
ers on the Stanford men's volleyball
team, their sport doesn't work like
that.
Nope. In the mind-boggling
world of NCAA men's volleyball, a
No. 3 national ranking, a 22-7 record
and second-place finishes in both the
regular season and tournament in
the crazy-good Mountain Pacific
