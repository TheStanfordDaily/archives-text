## Men's volley robbed by the NCAA 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Every March, dozens of col
lege basketball teams
wait anxiously for a selec
tion committee to decide
their postseason fate.
Coaches go on television making
their team's case, resumes are com
pared in hundreds of different ways
and the word "bubble" gets thrown
around approximately 12,000 times
per second. Months and months of
hard work get boiled down to a few
numbers and the opinions of a group
of old men in a room on one Sunday
afternoon, leaving several good
teams left outside the Big Dance.
And there's nothing the players can
do about it.
Compared to men's volleyball,
though, basketball players have a
Cakewalk.
Imagine being a team that domi
nates throughout the season, ranking
as high as No. 1 while finishing in a
close second in by far the best confer
ence in the nation. In your confer
ence tournament, you come inches
away from winning, eventually blow
ing a lead to the No. 2 team in the
country in the tournament final. Still,
as the No. 3 team in the nation, what's
to worry about?
In basketball or nearly any other
collegiate sport, there wouldn't be a
worry, as your only question would
be about seeding in the NCAA tour
nament. Unfortunately for the play
ers on the Stanford men's volleyball
team, their sport doesn't work like
that.
Nope. In the mind-boggling
world of NCAA men's volleyball, a
No. 3 national ranking, a 22-7 record
and second-place finishes in both the
regular season and tournament in
the crazy-good Mountain Pacific

Sports Federation (MPSF) gets you
nothing more than a seat on the
couch for the rest of the postseason.
That's because the NCAA tour
nament is nothing more than the
Final Four, which includes automat
ic qualifiers from the three big con
ferences in the country: the MPSF,
the Eastern Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association (EIVA) and the
Midwestern Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association (MIVA). This
leaves room for exactly one at-large
team. No, not the 37 at-large teams
of men's basketball. One.
It makes some sense... in theo
ry. The sport of men's volleyball is on
a much smaller scale than men's
basketball. Instead of the 340 teams
in Division I men's basketball, Divi
sion I men's volleyball has just 30, so
its tournament must obviously be
smaller. But trying to scale it all the
way down to four is just ludicrous.
More than that, it's unfair.
Volleyball is one of the few
sports where the men's game has
yet to catch up to the women's
game. There are over 10 times as
many women's teams as men's
teams in Division I, and only re
cently has men's volleyball begun
to pick up steam as a big-time col
lege sport. This has caused many of
the tall, athletic kids in middle and
high school to start choosing volley
ball, even though the sport is still
underrepresented at the college
level.
This inequity between the num
ber of great players and the number
of available teams means that sever
al volleyball teams are unbelievably
stacked. The top six or seven teams

have so much talent that they beat
up on each other constantly.The win
ner of one match or even one set
seems to have virtually no advan
tage when the next meeting rolls
around, which is why so many teams
come back from 2-0 deficits to win in
five. Using one or two head-to-head
matchups to distinguish between so
many qualified teams is extremely
difficult, and it's flat-out ludicrous
when the committee can only
choose one at-large team.
I know that the idea in men's vol
leyball is to have conference tourna
ments act as play-ins for the Final
Four, but that just cannot work when
one conference is so much better
than the others. When 10 of the top
12 teams in the country come from
the MPSF, which they do seemingly
every year (including 2012), then
you can't tell me everyone has an
equal chance to make the Final Four.
Stanford has many of the best
players in the country, including the
best libero ever (Erik Shoji) and
many of the school's all-time greats,
such as Brad Lawson, Evan Barry
and Gus Ellis. Few teams, if any, can
match the athleticism and entertain
ment value of the Cardinal. Robbing
the nation of seeing this team com
pete against the best opponents in
the nation for all the marbles is un
fair and unfortunate. Robbing this
team of the chance to accomplish its
goals and win the national title is just
flat-out wrong.
Get it together, NCAA. Make a
men's volleyball tournament where
all the best teams can compete for a
title.

All Jacob Jaffe wants for Christmas
is an at-large bid to the NCAA
men's volleyball tournament. Help

away from winning, eventually blow
ing a lead to the No. 2 team in the
country in the tournament final. Still,
as the No. 3 team in the nation, what's
to worry about?
In basketball or nearly any other
collegiate sport, there wouldn't be a
worry, as your only question would
be about seeding in the NCAA tour
nament. Unfortunately for the play
ers on the Stanford men's volleyball
team, their sport doesn't work like
that.
Nope. In the mind-boggling
world of NCAA men's volleyball, a
No. 3 national ranking, a 22-7 record
and second-place finishes in both the
regular season and tournament in
the crazy-good Mountain Pacific

Sports Federation (MPSF) gets you
nothing more than a seat on the
couch for the rest of the postseason.
That's because the NCAA tour
nament is nothing more than the
Final Four, which includes automat
ic qualifiers from the three big con
ferences in the country: the MPSF,
the Eastern Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association (EIVA) and the
Midwestern Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association (MIVA). This
leaves room for exactly one at-large
team. No, not the 37 at-large teams
of men's basketball. One.
It makes some sense... in theo
ry. The sport of men's volleyball is on
a much smaller scale than men's
basketball. Instead of the 340 teams
in Division I men's basketball, Divi
sion I men's volleyball has just 30, so
its tournament must obviously be
smaller. But trying to scale it all the
way down to four is just ludicrous.
More than that, it's unfair.
Volleyball is one of the few
sports where the men's game has
yet to catch up to the women's
game. There are over 10 times as
many women's teams as men's
teams in Division I, and only re
cently has men's volleyball begun
to pick up steam as a big-time col
lege sport. This has caused many of
the tall, athletic kids in middle and
high school to start choosing volley
ball, even though the sport is still
underrepresented at the college
level.
This inequity between the num
ber of great players and the number
of available teams means that sever
al volleyball teams are unbelievably
stacked. The top six or seven teams

have so much talent that they beat
up on each other constantly.The win
ner of one match or even one set
seems to have virtually no advan
tage when the next meeting rolls
around, which is why so many teams
come back from 2-0 deficits to win in
five. Using one or two head-to-head
matchups to distinguish between so
many qualified teams is extremely
difficult, and it's flat-out ludicrous
when the committee can only
choose one at-large team.
I know that the idea in men's vol
leyball is to have conference tourna
ments act as play-ins for the Final
Four, but that just cannot work when
one conference is so much better
than the others. When 10 of the top
12 teams in the country come from
the MPSF, which they do seemingly
every year (including 2012), then
you can't tell me everyone has an
equal chance to make the Final Four.
Stanford has many of the best
players in the country, including the
best libero ever (Erik Shoji) and
many of the school's all-time greats,
such as Brad Lawson, Evan Barry
and Gus Ellis. Few teams, if any, can
match the athleticism and entertain
ment value of the Cardinal. Robbing
the nation of seeing this team com
pete against the best opponents in
the nation for all the marbles is un
fair and unfortunate. Robbing this
team of the chance to accomplish its
goals and win the national title is just
flat-out wrong.
Get it together, NCAA. Make a
men's volleyball tournament where
all the best teams can compete for a
title.

Every March, dozens of col
lege basketball teams
wait anxiously for a selec
tion committee to decide
their postseason fate.
Coaches go on television making
their team's case, resumes are com
pared in hundreds of different ways
and the word "bubble" gets thrown
around approximately 12,000 times
per second. Months and months of
hard work get boiled down to a few
numbers and the opinions of a group
of old men in a room on one Sunday
afternoon, leaving several good
teams left outside the Big Dance.
And there's nothing the players can
do about it.
Compared to men's volleyball,
though, basketball players have a
Cakewalk.
Imagine being a team that domi
nates throughout the season, ranking
as high as No. 1 while finishing in a
close second in by far the best confer
ence in the nation. In your confer
ence tournament, you come inches
away from winning, eventually blow
ing a lead to the No. 2 team in the
country in the tournament final. Still,
as the No. 3 team in the nation, what's
