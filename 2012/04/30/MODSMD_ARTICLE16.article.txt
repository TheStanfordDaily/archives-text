# BRUINS BUMPED

### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 9 Stanford baseball team made up
some crucial ground on Pac-12 foe UCLA this
weekend, besting the No. 11 Bruins twice with
dominant pitching and getting help from some
of its veteran bats as well.
Junior righthander Mark Appel had double
digit strikeouts against a highly ranked oppo
nent for the fourth time this season on Friday,
while junior righty Sahil Bloom pitched five
near-perfect innings in relief on Sunday to se
cure the series win in Westwood. Meanwhile,
junior outfielders Stephen Piscotty and Tyler
Gaffney combined for nine hits and six RBIs on
the tail end of a stretch that has seen Stanford's
youth take a leading role at the plate, with both
homering in the series opener.
The Cardinal (28-11,10-8 Pac-12) is now only
a half game behind UCLA (28-12,12-9) for third
place in the conference, with No. 14 Oregon on
top and just two and a half games in front of
Stanford after moving into the top spot this
weekend.
With six wins in its last seven games, the Car
dinal is carrying much-needed momentum into
the home stretch of the Pac-12 season, which in
cludes a showdown with No. 21 Oregon State
the Beavers sit just a game behind Stanford

in Corvallis next weekend.
The Cardinal jumped out to a big lead in the
pivotal series opener and didn't look back, grab
bing a 7-0 advantage with runs in the fourth, fifth
and sixth innings. Sophomore righthander
Adam Plutko took a no-hitter into the top of the
fourth, but Gaffney broke it up with his first
home run of the year, an opposite-field solo shot.
Sophomore first baseman Brian Ragira tacked
on a second run with a two-out, full-count dou
ble to bring home freshman third baseman Alex
Blandino.
Stanford led off the fifth with six productive
at-bats a hit batsman, a sacrifice bunt, a single,
a sacrifice fly, another single and a three-run
home run from Piscotty before a sixth-inning
triple from junior catcher Eric Smith set up the
Cardinal's seventh run.
Appel (6-1) did give up eight hits in his seven
innings, but stranded seven UCLA baserunners
and struck out 10 more. Bloom gave up a ninth
inning homer to sophomore Pat Valaika to nar
row Stanford's lead to 7-2, but the Bruins didn't
have it in them for a comeback and the Cardinal
took the opener.
On Saturday, UCLA took advantage of an
off day from redshirt junior Brett Mooneyham,
whose recent struggles have seen his ERA jump
to 3.98, the highest for a Cardinal pitcher with at
least 10 appearances. The lefty gave up seven

free baserunners walking four and hitting
three in just a four-inning start.
Stanford grabbed the early lead on a two-run
double by Ragira in the top of the first, but the
advantage was gone as quickly as it was
achieved, as Mooneyham gave up four runs in
the bottom of the same frame.
The game stayed at 4-2 until the fifth, when
Mooneyham allowed another run to score and
loaded the bases before departing. Fellow left
hander Garrett Hughes came in and struck out
his first batter, then proceeded to walk in a run
before getting out of the inning.
Back-to-back homers from rightfielder
Austin Wilson and designated hitter Danny
Diekroeger in the sixth cut the four-run Bruin
lead in half, but the sophomores' effort would
cap the Cardinal's scoring on Saturday after
noon. Junior rightfielder Jeff Gelalich added a
bit of unneeded insurance for UCLA with his
RBI single in the seventh, as the Bruins evened
the series with a 7-4 win and set up an intriguing
rubber game for Sunday.
Stanford took the decisive third game be
tween these teams a year ago, coming up with a
four-run comeback that lasted down to the last
out in the bottom of the ninth. This time, the two
out rally would come much earlier.
Down 2-0 after UCLA tallied in the first and
second, the Cardinal had two outs in the top of
the fifth when junior shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger was hit by a pitch. Sophomore sec
ond baseman Brett Michael Doran followed
with a double and Gaffney who reached base
five times on Sunday drew a walk to load the
bases.
With the count full, Piscotty got an uncon
ventional RBI by taking one off his back, and
Ragira grabbed a 3-2 lead with a two-run single.
After Wilson walked to load the bases yet again,
Smith brought home two more runs with a sin
gle of his own, and Blandino tacked on a sixth
run with another base hit, giving the Cardinal its
biggest lead since Friday night.
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess turned
the game over to Bloom for the final five innings,
and the junior only needed to face one over the
minimum number of batters to secure his sec
ond relief win of the season. A five-pitch bottom
of the ninth finished off the weekend for the Car
dinal, which gained a game on UCLA in the
standings with the series win.
Stanford now turns its sights to San Jose
State, the only team to beat the Cardinal in a
midweek game this season. The squad will look
to avenge that 3-2 loss from two weeks ago at
Blethen Field on Tuesday afternoon in a 2:30
p.m. matchup.

noon. Junior rightfielder Jeff Gelalich added a
bit of unneeded insurance for UCLA with his
RBI single in the seventh, as the Bruins evened
the series with a 7-4 win and set up an intriguing
rubber game for Sunday.
Stanford took the decisive third game be
tween these teams a year ago, coming up with a
four-run comeback that lasted down to the last
out in the bottom of the ninth. This time, the two
out rally would come much earlier.
Down 2-0 after UCLA tallied in the first and
second, the Cardinal had two outs in the top of
the fifth when junior shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger was hit by a pitch. Sophomore sec
ond baseman Brett Michael Doran followed
with a double and Gaffney who reached base
five times on Sunday drew a walk to load the
bases.
With the count full, Piscotty got an uncon
ventional RBI by taking one off his back, and
Ragira grabbed a 3-2 lead with a two-run single.
After Wilson walked to load the bases yet again,
Smith brought home two more runs with a sin
gle of his own, and Blandino tacked on a sixth
run with another base hit, giving the Cardinal its
biggest lead since Friday night.
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess turned
the game over to Bloom for the final five innings,
and the junior only needed to face one over the
minimum number of batters to secure his sec
ond relief win of the season. A five-pitch bottom
of the ninth finished off the weekend for the Car
dinal, which gained a game on UCLA in the
standings with the series win.
Stanford now turns its sights to San Jose
State, the only team to beat the Cardinal in a
midweek game this season. The squad will look
to avenge that 3-2 loss from two weeks ago at
Blethen Field on Tuesday afternoon in a 2:30
p.m. matchup.

Junior leftfielder Stephen Piscotty had five hits and six RBI this weekend, including a three-run
home run in the opener. His transition to the outfield from third base has been smooth so far.
The No. 9 Stanford baseball team made up
some crucial ground on Pac-12 foe UCLA this
weekend, besting the No. 11 Bruins twice with
dominant pitching and getting help from some
of its veteran bats as well.
Junior righthander Mark Appel had double
digit strikeouts against a highly ranked oppo
nent for the fourth time this season on Friday,
while junior righty Sahil Bloom pitched five
near-perfect innings in relief on Sunday to se
cure the series win in Westwood. Meanwhile,
junior outfielders Stephen Piscotty and Tyler
Gaffney combined for nine hits and six RBIs on
the tail end of a stretch that has seen Stanford's
youth take a leading role at the plate, with both
homering in the series opener.
The Cardinal (28-11,10-8 Pac-12) is now only
a half game behind UCLA (28-12,12-9) for third
place in the conference, with No. 14 Oregon on
top and just two and a half games in front of
Stanford after moving into the top spot this
weekend.
With six wins in its last seven games, the Car
dinal is carrying much-needed momentum into
the home stretch of the Pac-12 season, which in
cludes a showdown with No. 21 Oregon State
the Beavers sit just a game behind Stanford

in Corvallis next weekend.
The Cardinal jumped out to a big lead in the
pivotal series opener and didn't look back, grab
bing a 7-0 advantage with runs in the fourth, fifth
and sixth innings. Sophomore righthander
Adam Plutko took a no-hitter into the top of the
fourth, but Gaffney broke it up with his first
home run of the year, an opposite-field solo shot.
Sophomore first baseman Brian Ragira tacked
on a second run with a two-out, full-count dou
ble to bring home freshman third baseman Alex
Blandino.
Stanford led off the fifth with six productive
at-bats a hit batsman, a sacrifice bunt, a single,
a sacrifice fly, another single and a three-run
home run from Piscotty before a sixth-inning
triple from junior catcher Eric Smith set up the
Cardinal's seventh run.
Appel (6-1) did give up eight hits in his seven
innings, but stranded seven UCLA baserunners
and struck out 10 more. Bloom gave up a ninth
inning homer to sophomore Pat Valaika to nar
row Stanford's lead to 7-2, but the Bruins didn't
have it in them for a comeback and the Cardinal
took the opener.
On Saturday, UCLA took advantage of an
off day from redshirt junior Brett Mooneyham,
whose recent struggles have seen his ERA jump
to 3.98, the highest for a Cardinal pitcher with at
least 10 appearances. The lefty gave up seven

free baserunners walking four and hitting
three in just a four-inning start.
Stanford grabbed the early lead on a two-run
double by Ragira in the top of the first, but the
advantage was gone as quickly as it was
achieved, as Mooneyham gave up four runs in
the bottom of the same frame.
The game stayed at 4-2 until the fifth, when
Mooneyham allowed another run to score and
loaded the bases before departing. Fellow left
hander Garrett Hughes came in and struck out
his first batter, then proceeded to walk in a run
before getting out of the inning.
Back-to-back homers from rightfielder
Austin Wilson and designated hitter Danny
Diekroeger in the sixth cut the four-run Bruin
lead in half, but the sophomores' effort would
cap the Cardinal's scoring on Saturday after
noon. Junior rightfielder Jeff Gelalich added a
bit of unneeded insurance for UCLA with his
RBI single in the seventh, as the Bruins evened
the series with a 7-4 win and set up an intriguing
rubber game for Sunday.
