# OP-ED
## In response to criticisms received 
### ADAM JOHNSON '13 Chair of The Stanford Daily Editorial Board 
On behalf of The Daily Edito
rial Board, I would like to
respond to some of the crit
icism we received over last Mon
day's editorial ("The pitfalls of so
cial engagement inside the class
room," April 23). While we appreci
ate the passion with which some
readers have responded, we feel
much of the criticism is off-base. I
will primarily refer to the argu
ments put forth by Holly Fetter 'l3
in her response op-ed, which we as
a Board view as largely representa
tive of the substantive criticism re
ceived thus far.
First, the response letter implies
that we do not value courses and
major programs that engage issues
of identity and power. In our edito
rial, we explicitly stated that we
"[acknowledge] the importance of
some Stanford courses directed at
this goal." Our primary claim,
rather, was that these courses
should not comprise a majority of
the University curriculum, just as
courses in technical learning should
not represent a majority of the Uni
versity's offerings. With this stance.

we hoped to actively engage the
Community Action Board's (CAB)
letter to the Faculty Senate, which
we felt was vague in addressing the
level with which to engage curricu
lum with issues of identity and
power. For instance, although we
think engineering curricula benefit
from courses in ethics or identity, we
do not think a class on thermody
namics should engage with these so
cial issues.
Second, and most concerning to
us, is that there has been a profound
misreading of a sentence in the orig
inal editorial. The sentence reads:
"A view of liberal arts education in
which courses should become train
ing grounds for social activism
threatens to marginalize thinkers
who fail to engage in socially rele
vant questions or who present less
tolerant views on women, minori
ties and privilege." As this was the
concluding sentence in a para
graph that opened with mentions
of Aristotle and Nietzsche, we
were surprised to learn that some,
Ms. Fetter included, have inter
preted the word "thinkers" to
mean "Stanford students." This
was not our intent, as we were re
ferring to prominent philosophers
and scholars whose views may not
accord with present-day sensibili
ties; we stand by the original word
ing as appropriate to convey our

message.
Finally, we never labeled the
CAB members as "activists" for the
views expressed in their letter. It is
only natural to want to be properly
represented in the University and
its curriculum, and we value how
the letter serves to add much-need
ed nuance to the SUES report. In
short, we are not afraid of "being ig
norant, overwhelmed and outnum
bered." Furthermore, we are disap
pointed that a significant portion of
the online response consisted of idle
speculation and ad hominem at
tacks, rather than thoughtful discus
sion on the points our editorial ad
dressed.
Our primary aim of the editorial,
rather, was to open a dialogue on
the subject of the role of social ac
tivism inside the classroom. We
opened the door for a debate with
our view of liberal education that
strikes a balance between the opin
ions of Hoover fellow Peter
Berkowitz and other conservative
voices in higher education with the
opinions of those who have been
critical of his primary arguments.
We feel this is a debate worth hav
ing, and we encourage the discus
sion surrounding our editorial to
focus on that normative question.
