### DANIEL E. LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team's bid for the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation (MPSF) tour
nament championship came up
just short on Saturday night, as the
Cardinal fell to fourth-seeded UC-
Irvine in five tight sets, 20-25,25-27,
25-21, 25-21,15-12 in the champi
onship match.
Despite winning the first two
sets, Stanford (22-7, 17-5 MPSF)
was not able to put away U C-lrvine
(24-5,17-5) and instead finds itself
on the outside looking in at the
four-team NCAA tournament.
USC was chosen as the sole at
large selection by the NCAA tour
nament committee, thanks to its
regular-season MPSF champi
onship and its season sweep of the
Cardinal. With the loss, the careers
of the members of Stanford's all
time winningest senior class
Evan Barry, Gus Ellis, Charley

Henrikson, Dylan Kordic, Brad
Lawson, Erik Shoji and Jake Van
dermeer came to a close. The
group finished with an overall
record ofB6-33,g00d for a .723 win
ning percentage.
The seniors certainly didn't go
out without a fight. Lawson and
Shoji, who have combined for
seven All-America honors, were
again terrific for the Cardinal in the
final match of their respective ca
reers. Lawson registered 23 kills
and 11 digs for the Cardinal while
Shoji had 12 digs in the losing ef
fort. Stanford also received strong
performances from sophomores
Steven Irvin and Brian Cook, who
combined for 31 kills and 21 digs. It
just wasn't enough for Stanford
however, which was out-hit .405 to
.314 for the match.
Uncharacteristically for the
Cardinal,it was the defense that be
trayed the squad this time around,
