## Five set MPSF final ends season 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team's bid for the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation (MPSF) tour
nament championship came up
just short on Saturday night, as the
Cardinal fell to fourth-seeded UC-
Irvine in five tight sets, 20-25,25-27,
25-21, 25-21,15-12 in the champi
onship match.
Despite winning the first two
sets, Stanford (22-7, 17-5 MPSF)
was not able to put away U C-lrvine
(24-5,17-5) and instead finds itself
on the outside looking in at the
four-team NCAA tournament.
USC was chosen as the sole at
large selection by the NCAA tour
nament committee, thanks to its
regular-season MPSF champi
onship and its season sweep of the
Cardinal. With the loss, the careers
of the members of Stanford's all
time winningest senior class
Evan Barry, Gus Ellis, Charley

Henrikson, Dylan Kordic, Brad
Lawson, Erik Shoji and Jake Van
dermeer came to a close. The
group finished with an overall
record ofB6-33,g00d for a .723 win
ning percentage.
The seniors certainly didn't go
out without a fight. Lawson and
Shoji, who have combined for
seven All-America honors, were
again terrific for the Cardinal in the
final match of their respective ca
reers. Lawson registered 23 kills
and 11 digs for the Cardinal while
Shoji had 12 digs in the losing ef
fort. Stanford also received strong
performances from sophomores
Steven Irvin and Brian Cook, who
combined for 31 kills and 21 digs. It
just wasn't enough for Stanford
however, which was out-hit .405 to
.314 for the match.
Uncharacteristically for the
Cardinal,it was the defense that be
trayed the squad this time around,
similar to what happened the last
time these two teams met. UC-
Irvine's hitting percentage was the
highest by any Stanford opponent
since the two teams met on March
3 in an Anteaters victory, when
Irvine hit .411.
"I think our defense struggled
during the majority of the match
both from a blocking and digging
standpoint, but credit goes to their
attackers for making it difficult on
us," Lawson said. "They are a very
balanced offensive team when
they pass well, and it didn't help
that they were consistently in sys
tem during the later part of the
match."
As good as UC-Irvine's attack
was for the latter half of this match,
the Cardinal had control for much
of the match. The Cardinal actually
outhit the Anteaters for the first
two sets of this match, and unsur
prisingly, this was when the men of
Maples had their greatest success.
With the first set even at nine,
the Cardinal embarked on a 7-2
run and never looked back, high
lighted by two kills by sophomore
Eric Mochalski and an ace and a
kill by Lawson. Irvin led the Cardi
nal with five kills in the set.
The second set proved to be the
most competitive between the two
squads, a back and forth affair in
which neither team ever led by
more than four points. Despite an
early barrage led by Mochalski
that put the Cardinal up 10-7, the
Anteaters continuously battled
back, eventually evening the set at
18 on a combined block by junior
Chris Austin and sophomore
Scott Kevorken. Despite having
the momentum in its favor,
though, UC-Irvine was never able
to gain the lead in the set, despite
fighting off two set points. The
Cardinal went up two sets to none
on a kill by Ellis.
UC-Irvine was able to turn the
tide of the match behind some
strong defense in the third set. The
Anteaters registered as many
blocks, five, in the set, as Stanford
did for the entire match. A block by
senior Austin D'Amore on
Mochalski gave UC-Irvine a 9-6
lead, which it clung onto until a
rare block by Stanford tied the set
at 18 and gave the Cardinal the de
finitive momentum. It was not to
be for Stanford on this night, how
ever, as a kill by senior Dan Mc-

Connell and a block by junior
Kevin Tillie quickly gave the
Anteaters a two-point cushion that
they would not relinquish.
The final two sets would be a
hitting clinic by UC-Irvine, which
registered 36 kills against just one
error in the final two sets. Stanford
had no answer for Irvine's quartet
of attackers, orchestrated master
fully by setter Chris Austin.
It was the second-consecutive
comeback for UC-Irvine down
two sets to none, as they had rallied
to defeat top-seed USC on their

home floor the night prior.
"For our players to have the
emotional energy to do it again for
the second straight match is amaz
ing to me," said UC-Irvine head
coach John Speraw.
The heartbreaking loss marked
the end of another stellar cam
paign for Stanford, which ad
vanced past the first round of the
conference tournament for just the
third time since 1997.

back, eventually evening the set at
18 on a combined block by junior
Chris Austin and sophomore
Scott Kevorken. Despite having
the momentum in its favor,
though, UC-Irvine was never able
to gain the lead in the set, despite
fighting off two set points. The
Cardinal went up two sets to none
on a kill by Ellis.
UC-Irvine was able to turn the
tide of the match behind some
strong defense in the third set. The
Anteaters registered as many
blocks, five, in the set, as Stanford
did for the entire match. A block by
senior Austin D'Amore on
Mochalski gave UC-Irvine a 9-6
lead, which it clung onto until a
rare block by Stanford tied the set
at 18 and gave the Cardinal the de
finitive momentum. It was not to
be for Stanford on this night, how
ever, as a kill by senior Dan Mc-

Connell and a block by junior
Kevin Tillie quickly gave the
Anteaters a two-point cushion that
they would not relinquish.
The final two sets would be a
hitting clinic by UC-Irvine, which
registered 36 kills against just one
error in the final two sets. Stanford
had no answer for Irvine's quartet
of attackers, orchestrated master
fully by setter Chris Austin.
It was the second-consecutive
comeback for UC-Irvine down
two sets to none, as they had rallied
to defeat top-seed USC on their

home floor the night prior.
"For our players to have the
emotional energy to do it again for
the second straight match is amaz
ing to me," said UC-Irvine head
coach John Speraw.
The heartbreaking loss marked
the end of another stellar cam
paign for Stanford, which ad
vanced past the first round of the
conference tournament for just the
third time since 1997.

Senior outside hitter Brad Lawson's storied career may have ended in disapppointment in an MPSF finals loss to UC-lrvine, but he wouldn't go
down without a fight, putting up 23 kills and 11 digs in his last game.
The Stanford men's volleyball
team's bid for the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation (MPSF) tour
nament championship came up
just short on Saturday night, as the
Cardinal fell to fourth-seeded UC-
Irvine in five tight sets, 20-25,25-27,
25-21, 25-21,15-12 in the champi
onship match.
Despite winning the first two
sets, Stanford (22-7, 17-5 MPSF)
was not able to put away U C-lrvine
(24-5,17-5) and instead finds itself
on the outside looking in at the
four-team NCAA tournament.
USC was chosen as the sole at
large selection by the NCAA tour
nament committee, thanks to its
regular-season MPSF champi
onship and its season sweep of the
Cardinal. With the loss, the careers
of the members of Stanford's all
time winningest senior class
Evan Barry, Gus Ellis, Charley

Henrikson, Dylan Kordic, Brad
Lawson, Erik Shoji and Jake Van
dermeer came to a close. The
group finished with an overall
record ofB6-33,g00d for a .723 win
ning percentage.
The seniors certainly didn't go
out without a fight. Lawson and
Shoji, who have combined for
seven All-America honors, were
again terrific for the Cardinal in the
final match of their respective ca
reers. Lawson registered 23 kills
and 11 digs for the Cardinal while
Shoji had 12 digs in the losing ef
fort. Stanford also received strong
performances from sophomores
Steven Irvin and Brian Cook, who
combined for 31 kills and 21 digs. It
just wasn't enough for Stanford
however, which was out-hit .405 to
.314 for the match.
Uncharacteristically for the
Cardinal,it was the defense that be
trayed the squad this time around,
similar to what happened the last
time these two teams met. UC-
Irvine's hitting percentage was the
highest by any Stanford opponent
since the two teams met on March
3 in an Anteaters victory, when
Irvine hit .411.
"I think our defense struggled
during the majority of the match
both from a blocking and digging
standpoint, but credit goes to their
attackers for making it difficult on
us," Lawson said. "They are a very
balanced offensive team when
they pass well, and it didn't help
that they were consistently in sys
tem during the later part of the
match."
As good as UC-Irvine's attack
was for the latter half of this match,
the Cardinal had control for much
of the match. The Cardinal actually
outhit the Anteaters for the first
two sets of this match, and unsur
prisingly, this was when the men of
Maples had their greatest success.
With the first set even at nine,
the Cardinal embarked on a 7-2
run and never looked back, high
lighted by two kills by sophomore
Eric Mochalski and an ace and a
kill by Lawson. Irvin led the Cardi
nal with five kills in the set.
The second set proved to be the
most competitive between the two
squads, a back and forth affair in
which neither team ever led by
more than four points. Despite an
early barrage led by Mochalski
that put the Cardinal up 10-7, the
Anteaters continuously battled
back, eventually evening the set at
18 on a combined block by junior
Chris Austin and sophomore
Scott Kevorken. Despite having
the momentum in its favor,
though, UC-Irvine was never able
to gain the lead in the set, despite
