## Derrick sets American collegiate record, gets Olympic "A" standard 
### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
Senior Chris Derrick set per
sonal, school and national records
in the 10,000 meters at the Payton
Jordan Invitational on Sunday
night.
Derrick's time of 27:31.38, near
ly a full minute better than his pre
vious best, easily broke the Stan
ford record of 27:59.72 set by lan
Dobson in 2005. A few minutes
after the race finished, it was con
firmed that Derrick's time also set
the American collegiate record and
is the fastest time by any American
this year.
Perhaps even more importantly
for Derrick, his time easily sur
passed the Olympic "A" standard,
which is the mark required for par
ticipants in the Olympics. With this
time, Derrick can compete at the
U.S. Olympic Trials in Eugene, Ore.
on June 22 for the chance to make
the Olympic team in the 10,000 me
ters. Derrick had previously quali

fied with the "A" standard in the
5,000 meters as well.
The Payton Jordan Invitational
is seen as the best meet in which to
break records, causing many of the
top track and field stars from
around the world to attend the
event. Derrick had previously set
an American junior record in the
5,000 meters at the same event in
2009.
In this year's race, Derrick fin
ished third behind Southern
Utah's Cameron Levins and for
mer Liberty standout Sam
Chelanga. The Canadian-born
Levins kicked away from his com
petition to finish with the best time
in the world this year. In total, six
runners beat the previous fastest
time of 2012, and eight met the "A"
standard.
Derrick, a 13-time All-Ameri
can from Naperville, 111., now holds
Stanford records for the 3,000 me
ters, 5,000 meters indoors and the
10,000 meters outdoors.
