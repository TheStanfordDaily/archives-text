## ProFros react to new class Incoming frosh to be first Thinking Matters students 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
Prospective Freshman (ProFros)
got a close-up view of the next four
years of their education includ
ing the recently revamped fresh
man year curriculum during
this year's Admit Weekend, which
ran from Thursday, April 26 to Sat
urday, April 28.
Next year, the Introduction to
the Humanities (IHUM) program
will be eliminated in favor of a new
one-quarter interdisciplinary pro
gram called Thinking Matters.
Freshmen will only take Thinking
Matters for one quarter rather
than the current three-quarter
IHUM sequence.The Faculty Sen
ate officially adopted the program
in March.
ProFros mostly commented
positively on the change.
"Everyone I know who has
talked to me about IHUM has said
they hated it so I guess I'm glad it's
gone," said Peter Dolan, a Pro Fro
from Kirkland, Wash.
Other ProFros shared similar
sentiments.
"I haven't heard great things
about IHUM from current stu
dents," said Sarah Rosston, a
Pro Fro from Menlo Park, Calif.
All ProFros interviewed by The
Daily said that they had heard
negative things about the course
from their Room Hosts (RoHos).
"It seems like a positive change
from what I've heard," said lan Gon
zalez, a Pro Fro from Miami, Fla.
Still other ProFros expressed
excitement over the fact that the
Thinking Matters program will in
volve more choice and fewer re
quired units.
"It seems like it would give you
a chance to explore more options
freshman year," said Laura Zalles,
a Pro Fro from Palo Alto.
"Obviously I haven't taken
IHUM, but it seems like you can
tailor [Thinking Matters] more to
your interests rather than take a
class that you may or may not be
interested in," said Hadley Reid, a
Pro Fro from Chapel Hill, N.C.

Admit Weekend coordinators
gave House Hosts (HoHos) in
formation about the new fresh
man curriculum changes during a
briefing to help them answer
questions from ProFros.
"Thinking Matters is not just a
humanities-based program," said
Will Setrakian 'l5, a Larkin
HoHo, when describing the new
freshman curriculum. "It will ex
pose students to a wide variety of
subjects such as communications,
law and science."
Setrakian added that students
will be able to enroll in Thinking
Matters classes that interest them
in addition to the one they choose
to fulfill their one-quarter re
quirement.

Gonzalez added that he had
heard about some interesting
Thinking Matters courses, such as
one based on the popular Discov
ery Channel show Mythbusters.
"They sound so interesting
that I might actually sign up for
more than just the one required
course," Gonzalez said.
