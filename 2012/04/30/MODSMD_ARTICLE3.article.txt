# CARD SENDS 12 TO PLAY IN NFL
## FLEENER JOINS LUCK WITH COLTS 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
While Andrew Luck and David De-
Castro might have stolen the headlines as
the first two Stanford players selected in
the NFL draft, ten other Cardinal players
officially made the leap from the Farm to
the NFL over the weekend as well.
In second round of the draft on Friday
afternoon, the Indianapolis Colts selected
tight end Coby Fleener with the 34th pick,
reuniting Andrew Luck with his most pro
lific target from 2011. Eight picks later, the
Miami Dolphins chose offensive tackle
Jonathan Martin with the 42nd selection
in the draft.
Fleener, who had 34 catches for 667

yards and 10 touchdowns in his final cam
paign as a Cardinal, said he knew he had a
chance to join Luck in blue and white
when the first round ended with his name
on the board and the Colts just two picks
away.
"I knew it was a possibility [to come to
Indianapolis], but you never really know,"
Fleener told the Colts' official website, "I
sat there yesterday thinking there were
some teams that could have picked me
and I wasn't sure. Today when the Colts
came up, I still wasn't sure until I got the
call on my phone that had an Indiana area
code. I had a big smile on my face at that
point."

Tight end Coby Fleener may be transitioning to the NFL next season, but he'll have
his fair share of familiar faces around the Colts' compound in first-overall pick quarterback Andrew Luck and wide receiver Griff Whalen, picked up as a free agent.
Fleener, like Luck, will be ex
pected to replace a former All-Pro
at his position, as the Colts released
tight end Dallas Clark in Indy fol
lowing an injury-riddled 2011 sea
son where Clark only played in 11
games and scored just two touch
downs during the Colts' miserable
2-14 campaign.
Martin, who will be returning to
the site of the Cardinal's 2011 Or
ange Bowl victory for the next few
years, also expressed his excitement
at joining a franchise that has long
been associated with excellence.
"It's amazing. I'm just so excited
to be a member of the Miami Dol
phins. It's a dream come true," Mar
tin told the Dolphins' official web
site. "It's an amazing city, an amaz
ing fan base and there's an amazing
history behind the team and I just
can't wait to get down there and
work."
Martin, like Luck and Fleener
with the Colts, will join a major re
building effort in Miami. Coming
off a 6-10 season where head coach
Tony Sparano was fired after an 0-7
start, the Dolphins spent their first
pick on Texas A&M quarterback
RyanTannehill and their second on
Martin, who will be tasked with pro
tecting the Dolphins' new signal
caller.
And while Luck and Fleener will
be playing the positions they're so
familiar with in tandem with one
another for a few more years, that
likely won't be the case for Martin.
Instead, Martin will likely be
forced to switch to the right tackle
after playing left tackle in college, as
the Dolphins already have four
time Pro Bowler (and former No. 1
overall pick) Jake Long holding
down the left side of the line,
"I'm so excited to play behind a
player like [Long], He's going to be
a Hall of Fame left tackle," Martin
said. "He's a guy I've modeled my
game after for years and I've been a
fan. I'm excited to play and I'll play
left, I'll play right, wherever the
team needs me."
After Fleener and Martin went
off the board in the second round,
giving the Cardinal four players se
lected in the top 42, no other Stan
ford players were selected in the
next five rounds of the draft. How
ever, eight Stanford players signed
contracts with NFL teams over the
weekend as undrafted free agents.

Wide receiver Griff Whalen
made it a party for three in Indy,
joining the Colts and giving Luck

more continuity from his career on
the Farm. Whalen led the Cardinal
with 56 receptions last season, tally
ing 749 yards and four touchdowns,
giving Luck the opportunity to
throw to his two favorite targets for
a few more years.
Several other players tried to
make it a Cardinal family affair by
electing to sign with the San Fran
cisco 49ers, including defensive end
Matt Masifilo, wide receiver Chris
Owusu and safety Michael Thomas.
All three will now rejoin former
coach Jim Harbaugh, the man who
recruited Thomas and Owusu to
the Farm.
Cornerback Corey Gatewood
also elected to stay in the Bay Area,
signing with the Oakland Raiders.
Gatewood, who switched to corner
back from wide receiver midway
through last season, will reunite
with former Cardinal co-defensive
coordinator Jason Tarver, who took
over as the Raiders' defensive coor
dinator in February.
Gatewood's fellow compatriots
in the secondary elected to take
their skills away from California,
though, as cornerback Johnson
Bademosi signed with the Cleve
land Browns, joining former Stan
ford teammate Owen Marecic, who
was the Browns' fourth round pick
last season. Safety Delano Flowell
signed with the Buffalo Bills, where
he'll join a talented group of defen
sive backs and play twice a year
against Martin and the Dolphins.
On the other side of the ball, run
ning back Jeremy Stewart elected
to sign with the Philadelphia Eagles,
where he'll likely compete for a spot
at fullback with former USC run
ning back Stanley Havili.
Altogether, the Cardinal has
one of its largest groups of NFL
bound players in years, as 12 players
from the 2011 team now take the
leap to the next level. These players
will report to their respective teams
after graduation. While Luck,
Fleener, DeCastro and Martin are
expected to step in and start for
then respective teams right away,
the road is not as clear for those un
drafted players, who will be fighting
for roster spots on the NFL's 53-
man teams as soon as the academic
season ends, with mini-camps con
tinuing throughout the summer be
fore teams open preseason training
camps in mid-August.
But for now, the former Stanford
players can bask in the fact that
they've finally realized their NFL
dreams and that the NFL has
gotten several shades more Cardi
nal in just one weekend.

Bademosi signed with the Cleve
land Browns, joining former Stan
ford teammate Owen Marecic, who
was the Browns' fourth round pick
last season. Safety Delano Flowell
signed with the Buffalo Bills, where
he'll join a talented group of defen
sive backs and play twice a year
against Martin and the Dolphins.
On the other side of the ball, run
ning back Jeremy Stewart elected
to sign with the Philadelphia Eagles,
where he'll likely compete for a spot
at fullback with former USC run
ning back Stanley Havili.
Altogether, the Cardinal has
one of its largest groups of NFL
bound players in years, as 12 players
from the 2011 team now take the
leap to the next level. These players
will report to their respective teams
after graduation. While Luck,
Fleener, DeCastro and Martin are
expected to step in and start for
then respective teams right away,
the road is not as clear for those un
drafted players, who will be fighting
for roster spots on the NFL's 53-
man teams as soon as the academic
season ends, with mini-camps con
tinuing throughout the summer be
fore teams open preseason training
camps in mid-August.
But for now, the former Stanford
players can bask in the fact that
they've finally realized their NFL
dreams and that the NFL has
gotten several shades more Cardi
nal in just one weekend.

While Andrew Luck and David De-
Castro might have stolen the headlines as
the first two Stanford players selected in
the NFL draft, ten other Cardinal players
officially made the leap from the Farm to
the NFL over the weekend as well.
In second round of the draft on Friday
afternoon, the Indianapolis Colts selected
tight end Coby Fleener with the 34th pick,
reuniting Andrew Luck with his most pro
lific target from 2011. Eight picks later, the
Miami Dolphins chose offensive tackle
Jonathan Martin with the 42nd selection
in the draft.
Fleener, who had 34 catches for 667

yards and 10 touchdowns in his final cam
paign as a Cardinal, said he knew he had a
chance to join Luck in blue and white
when the first round ended with his name
on the board and the Colts just two picks
away.
"I knew it was a possibility [to come to
Indianapolis], but you never really know,"
Fleener told the Colts' official website, "I
sat there yesterday thinking there were
some teams that could have picked me
and I wasn't sure. Today when the Colts
came up, I still wasn't sure until I got the
call on my phone that had an Indiana area
code. I had a big smile on my face at that
point."

Tight end Coby Fleener may be transitioning to the NFL next season, but he'll have
his fair share of familiar faces around the Colts' compound in first-overall pick quarterback Andrew Luck and wide receiver Griff Whalen, picked up as a free agent.
Fleener, like Luck, will be ex
pected to replace a former All-Pro
at his position, as the Colts released
tight end Dallas Clark in Indy fol
lowing an injury-riddled 2011 sea
son where Clark only played in 11
games and scored just two touch
downs during the Colts' miserable
2-14 campaign.
Martin, who will be returning to
the site of the Cardinal's 2011 Or
ange Bowl victory for the next few
years, also expressed his excitement
at joining a franchise that has long
been associated with excellence.
"It's amazing. I'm just so excited
to be a member of the Miami Dol
phins. It's a dream come true," Mar
tin told the Dolphins' official web
site. "It's an amazing city, an amaz
ing fan base and there's an amazing
history behind the team and I just
can't wait to get down there and
work."
Martin, like Luck and Fleener
with the Colts, will join a major re
building effort in Miami. Coming
off a 6-10 season where head coach
Tony Sparano was fired after an 0-7
start, the Dolphins spent their first
pick on Texas A&M quarterback
RyanTannehill and their second on
Martin, who will be tasked with pro
tecting the Dolphins' new signal
caller.
And while Luck and Fleener will
be playing the positions they're so
familiar with in tandem with one
another for a few more years, that
likely won't be the case for Martin.
Instead, Martin will likely be
forced to switch to the right tackle
after playing left tackle in college, as
the Dolphins already have four
time Pro Bowler (and former No. 1
overall pick) Jake Long holding
down the left side of the line,
"I'm so excited to play behind a
player like [Long], He's going to be
a Hall of Fame left tackle," Martin
said. "He's a guy I've modeled my
game after for years and I've been a
fan. I'm excited to play and I'll play
left, I'll play right, wherever the
team needs me."
After Fleener and Martin went
off the board in the second round,
giving the Cardinal four players se
lected in the top 42, no other Stan
ford players were selected in the
next five rounds of the draft. How
ever, eight Stanford players signed
contracts with NFL teams over the
weekend as undrafted free agents.

Wide receiver Griff Whalen
made it a party for three in Indy,
joining the Colts and giving Luck

more continuity from his career on
the Farm. Whalen led the Cardinal
with 56 receptions last season, tally
ing 749 yards and four touchdowns,
giving Luck the opportunity to
throw to his two favorite targets for
a few more years.
Several other players tried to
make it a Cardinal family affair by
electing to sign with the San Fran
cisco 49ers, including defensive end
Matt Masifilo, wide receiver Chris
Owusu and safety Michael Thomas.
All three will now rejoin former
coach Jim Harbaugh, the man who
recruited Thomas and Owusu to
the Farm.
Cornerback Corey Gatewood
also elected to stay in the Bay Area,
signing with the Oakland Raiders.
Gatewood, who switched to corner
back from wide receiver midway
through last season, will reunite
with former Cardinal co-defensive
coordinator Jason Tarver, who took
over as the Raiders' defensive coor
dinator in February.
Gatewood's fellow compatriots
in the secondary elected to take
their skills away from California,
though, as cornerback Johnson
Bademosi signed with the Cleve
land Browns, joining former Stan
ford teammate Owen Marecic, who
was the Browns' fourth round pick
last season. Safety Delano Flowell
