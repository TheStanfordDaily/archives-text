### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
While Andrew Luck and David De-
Castro might have stolen the headlines as
the first two Stanford players selected in
the NFL draft, ten other Cardinal players
officially made the leap from the Farm to
the NFL over the weekend as well.
In second round of the draft on Friday
afternoon, the Indianapolis Colts selected
tight end Coby Fleener with the 34th pick,
reuniting Andrew Luck with his most pro
lific target from 2011. Eight picks later, the
Miami Dolphins chose offensive tackle
Jonathan Martin with the 42nd selection
in the draft.
Fleener, who had 34 catches for 667

yards and 10 touchdowns in his final cam
paign as a Cardinal, said he knew he had a
chance to join Luck in blue and white
when the first round ended with his name
on the board and the Colts just two picks
away.
"I knew it was a possibility [to come to
Indianapolis], but you never really know,"
Fleener told the Colts' official website, "I
sat there yesterday thinking there were
some teams that could have picked me
and I wasn't sure. Today when the Colts
came up, I still wasn't sure until I got the
call on my phone that had an Indiana area
code. I had a big smile on my face at that
point."

Tight end Coby Fleener may be transitioning to the NFL next season, but he'll have
his fair share of familiar faces around the Colts' compound in first-overall pick quarterback Andrew Luck and wide receiver Griff Whalen, picked up as a free agent.
