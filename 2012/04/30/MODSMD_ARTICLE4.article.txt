# Responding to campus crisis
## Suites Residential staff members, students disagree on University response to student death 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
This is the first in a four-part series on crisis response
and mental health resources on campus.
Following the death of sophomore student-athlete
Sam Wopat on March 25 and reports of several at
tempted suicides on campus this year, The Daily has
undertaken a survey of existing campus resources and
culture surrounding mental health.
Today, we take a look at University reaction in the
days and weeks directly following Sam Wopat's suicide
attempt and her death, exploring questions about how
the University responds to student death, especially in
cases of suicide. Next, The Daily will examine preven
tion, examining University systems in place to identify
and help students in crisis and addressing reports of ad
ditional suicide attempts in campus residences. The
Daily will then take a broader look at widespread stu
dent experience with mental health resources on cam
pus and will highlight efforts to adapt campus culture
for the future.
Questions about University policy on communicat
ing the death of a student were doubly present as Cady
Hine, a junior English major who worked to establish
Stanford Peace of Mind (SPOM) to destigmatize men
tal health and illness on campus, died on April 1 in her
Palo Alto residence, within a week of Wopat's death.
The cause of Fline's death has not yet been reported.
After a month of interviews, The Daily has com
piled details of the night of Wopat's suicide attempt in
her Suites residence and how resident assistants (RAs)
and University officials responded that night and in the
following days. Some RAs in Suites felt the University
response following Wopat's death was inadequate,
while another expressed gratitude for the University's
guidance. In addition, the response or lack thereof
from the University to the larger student body re
garding student death has been a source of tension be
tween students who want information and University
officials who seek to respect the privacy of victims and
their families.
University administrators cited federal privacy
laws, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
(FERPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) when explaining why
they are unable to discuss specific cases with The Daily
and the general campus.
Crisis in Suites
Resident assistants in Suites
were split over the effectiveness
of the University's reaction on
the night of Wopat's attempt and
during her weeklong hospitaliza
tion prior to her death. Two RAs
expressed frustration with a lack
of explicit directives on how to
address resident questions and
emotional responses to Wopat's
hospitalization, though the other
Suites RAs said University offi
cials were very helpful through
out the process.
"I don't feel like the Universi
ty was there to help us as RAs,"
said Kiera O'Rourke 'l3.
O'Rourke and Jen Wylie 'l3,
also a Suites RA, commented
that it was difficult not to relay in
formation since many residents
were present as ambulances ar
rived on campus.
"When I came in, I saw all
three floors of Jenkins [the house
adjacent to Wopat's residence]
all the windows lighted and peo
ple were standing in the window
looking," O'Rourke said.
"You could see the ambulance
the sirens were going on out
side," Wylie said. "People were
going to be like 'What's going
on?"'
Suites RA Elijah Frazier 'l2,
who said that many students wit
nessed the presence of EMTs,
also said that very little informa
tion could be released because
very little information was avail
able at the time.
O'Rourke, who acknowl
edged that Valentina del Olmo,
the Residence Dean responsible
for Suites, needed to be at the
hospital with Wopat, said that
having an adult present on cam
pus that night would have been
helpful. All four Suites RAs
agreed that having an adult pres
ence in the dorm following
Wopat's hospitalization would
have been helpful.
O'Rourke said alerting near
by resident fellows (RF) in the
Sterling Quad or EAST, Murray
or Yost houses could have solved
the lack of adult presence, since
Suites does not have an RF. She
added she did not feel supported
by the University in the days fol
lowing Wopat's suicide attempt,
and that she did not know how to
respond to students as an RA
and as a fellow student follow
ing Wopat's hospitalization. In
her opinion, the University failed
to give adequate directives to the
Suites RAs.
"We really didn't know what
to do," she said. "It felt very fu
tile."
O'Rourke said she was told a
few days after Wopat's hospital
ization not to convey further in
formation to students who did
not know what had happened,
but to ensure general resident
well-being.
"As an RA you feel hesitant to
do the personal thing because
you're part of the voice of the
University almost," O'Rourke
added. "You don't want to act as
an RA without the University
backing you up. You feel very lost
when you don't have an explicit
direction [about what informa
tion to reveal]."
Wylie and fellow RA Juan-
Carlos Foust 'l3 agreed they
would have appreciated having
more information about what
they could and could not say to
students.
"I didn't know what face I was
supposed to be wearing," Foust
said.
The Suites RAs announced a
vigil held for Wopat two days
after her hospitalization, men
tioning neither her name or what
had occurred.
"Saturday was a hard night for
many members of our communi
ty," the RAs wrote to the Suites
mailing list. "If you would like to

send love/support for those in
volved, take a trip to Maples
Pavilion. At the entrance is a tree
from which we are hanging mes
sages, notes, drawings, etc. Mate
rials should be in a brown bag
near the tree."
Some Suites residents attend
ed the vigil and left, without ever
knowing Wopat's name.
"They should have been going
around that night"
O'Rourke was uncomfortable
with an apparent hands-off ap
proach following Wopat's death,
especially when she was asked by
the Suites ResEd supervisor to
check up on the residents of Grif
fin, Wopat's house within Suites.
"We got an email one or two
days later saying, 'You have to go
around Griffin again and talk to
each room,'" O'Rourke said.
"And I was like 'Why am I going
around Griffin? I think a [Coun
seling and Pschological Services]
counselor should go around Grif
fin they should have been
going around that night.'"
"I think CAPS counselors
should have been here the day
after [Wopat attempted suicide]
going around Griffin," O'Rourke
said. Wylie agreed.
Communication between
RAs and the University also ap
peared to be a problem. Both
RAs expressed frustration with
limited prior announcement of
an academic advising event held
for Suites residents to assess their
options for finishing winter quar
ter coursework while dealing
with Wopat's hospitalization.
"We weren't even notified
about that," O'Rourke said.
All four Suites RAs said they
received emails from administra
tors commending them for their
work during such a difficult time.
Foust said the messages felt more
reactive than prescriptive.
Frazier said he felt the Univer
sity response to the RAs was both
supportive and appropriate.
"Because ResEd stepped in to
support [us] and the University
[did] overall 1 think there was
a lot of support," Frazier said.
"It seemed that they were very
busy but also highly supportive,"
Foust said.
"The University said it wasn't
a measure of keeping the situa
tion quiet as much as it was up to
the family on what they chose to
disclose or not," Frazier said.
O'Rourke said she under
stood privacy concerns but got a
different sense from the Univer
sity.
"It seemed to me like they did
n't want us to tell people," she
said.
Dean of Residential Educa
tion Deborah Golder said she re
ceived feedback from Suites resi
dents about a lack of University
presence in the dorm, but
stressed that action by RAs is
more meaningful than adminis
trator presence and that ResEd
coordinated with the Suites RAs.
"We got some feedback from
folks who live in Suites, saying
'the University's not doing any
thing for us,'" Golder said. "All of
the things that RAs were doing,
etc. were our involvement. It feels
like 'the University is not in
volved,' but of course we are.
What's more helpful to a stu
dent? Me? I think a student who
you know is more accessible to
you than I am. Maybe those don't
look public enough. That's not
the intention."
University communication
With the exception of an email
ResEd sent to the Suites residen
tial community following
Wopat's death, the University
has not sent any direct messages
to the student body announcing
the deaths of Wopat or Hine,
memorial services for the de
ceased students or existing re
sources for grieving or stressed
students.
On April 2, Vice Provost of
Student Affairs Greg Boardman
published an op-ed in The Daily

announcing Wopat's death to
those who may not have known,
stating that the University
would likely not offer additional
information in deference to
family privacy and communicat
ing the availability of campus
mental health resources.
On April 17, The Daily ran an
op-ed by Rabbi Patricia Karlin-
Neumann, senior associate dean
of the Office for Religious Life;
Alejandro Martinez, senior asso
ciate director of CAPS; and Jim
Cadena, director of the Arts in
Residential Education program,
about their work with Hine.
Still, several students have
expressed frustration with a lack
of communication about the stu
dent deaths, while the University
continues to stress the impor
tance of maintaining the privacy
of families during times of loss.
Stanford was not the only top
university to experience student
death in recent weeks. In compar
ison, the Dean of Harvard Col
lege and the Dean of Yale Col
lege each sent messages to their
entire student populations an
nouncing student deaths that that
occurred on their respective cam
puses in the past two weeks. Each
University relayed information

about the deaths, the availability
of mental health resources on
campus and details for vigils via
campus-wide emails on the same
day the students had died, though
neither included suicide as the
cause of death in communication
to students.
"Harvard never acknowl
edged any cause of death," Har
vard sophomore Nicholas Rine
hart wrote in a Facebook mes
sage to The Daily.
"People here are actually
pretty upset that Harvard is not
taking this opportunity to talk
about suicide and mental health
in any real way, instead pretend
ing like [suicide] doesn't hap
pen," Rinehart wrote.
Stanford Dean of Student Af
fairs Chris Griffith responded to
The Daily about how the Univer
sity communicates news of stu
dent deaths, saying that Stanford
defers to the privacy concerns of
family members and does not
have a specific policy on broader
disemmination of the news.
"Our immediate response
when one of our students dies is
to support the student's family,
friends, and others who are im
pacted and to ensure that they
have access to University re
sources that provide help and
comfort," Griffith wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Our re
sponse does not require a specific
notification to the community;
but rather we evaluate the cir
cumstances and consider the
need for privacy of family mem
bers and of students and others
who are impacted at Stanford as
well as regulations that may pre
vent us from releasing informa
tion."
Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman wrote to
The Daily that he thinks the Uni
versity can balance the privacy
needs of families while having an
open dialogue about suicide.
"We always work hard to re
spect the privacy of individuals,"
Boardman said. "Each situation
poses its unique circumstances,
and, often there is much that the
University is unable to disclose.
Yet, we always engage with open
dialogue on the associated topics
on mental health and suicide,
broadly."

This policy has upset some stu
dents, and Ron Albucher, direc
tor of CAPS, said he understands
where that frustration originates.
"I totally get why students feel
frustrated about this because

there seems to be a lack of com
munication from the University
to the student body about it," Al
bucher said. "The University
struggles with balancing the
needs of the students with the pri
vacy issues of the families in
volved. And that's where the Uni
versity has sided more."
Silence on Cady Hine
The silence surrounding
Wopat's death wasn't the only
cause of frustration for some stu
dents. Stanford lost another stu
dent on April 1, when Cady Hine,
a junior with a history of bipolar
disorder who worked to address
the stigma surrounding mental
health and mental illness on cam
pus, died while on spring break at
the age of 24. No additional news
of the circumstances of Hine's
death has been reported.
The Stanford Report an
nounced Cady Hine's death on
April 6, and The Daily printed an
obituary on April 17, along with
the previously mentioned op-ed.
No official University communi
cation was sent.
Helena Bonde, a fifth year
senior who befriended Hine
when they met in 2008, expressed
frustration with how long and
through what channels news
about Hine's death and memorial
services traveled, especially at the
late response of both the Univer
sity and The Daily.
"I was pissed that there wasn't
more news about [Cady's]
death," Bonde said. " I mean,
Cady was a really wonderful
member of our community and
there wasn't even a Daily article
until after her memorial service
which was two weeks after her
death."
Bonde said she did not find
out about Hine's death through
either the Report or The Daily.
"I found out about it from a
friend emailing me because she'd
seen someone link to the Stan
ford News update website-thing
that I'd never even looked at
before in my life," she said. "There
are probably quite a few people
who didn't even know about
Cady's death until after the me
morial."

Part two of this four-part series will
run Wednesday.The piece will ex
amine crisis prevention on campus,
including training of Residential
Education staff, and University re
sponse to student mental health
crises.
