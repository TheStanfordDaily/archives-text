# Responding to campus crisis
## Suites Residential staff members, students disagree on University response to student death 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
This is the first in a four-part series on crisis response
and mental health resources on campus.
Following the death of sophomore student-athlete
Sam Wopat on March 25 and reports of several at
tempted suicides on campus this year, The Daily has
undertaken a survey of existing campus resources and
culture surrounding mental health.
Today, we take a look at University reaction in the
days and weeks directly following Sam Wopat's suicide
attempt and her death, exploring questions about how
the University responds to student death, especially in
cases of suicide. Next, The Daily will examine preven
tion, examining University systems in place to identify
and help students in crisis and addressing reports of ad
ditional suicide attempts in campus residences. The
Daily will then take a broader look at widespread stu
dent experience with mental health resources on cam
pus and will highlight efforts to adapt campus culture
for the future.
Questions about University policy on communicat
ing the death of a student were doubly present as Cady
Hine, a junior English major who worked to establish
Stanford Peace of Mind (SPOM) to destigmatize men
tal health and illness on campus, died on April 1 in her
Palo Alto residence, within a week of Wopat's death.
The cause of Fline's death has not yet been reported.
After a month of interviews, The Daily has com
piled details of the night of Wopat's suicide attempt in
her Suites residence and how resident assistants (RAs)
and University officials responded that night and in the
following days. Some RAs in Suites felt the University
response following Wopat's death was inadequate,
while another expressed gratitude for the University's
guidance. In addition, the response or lack thereof
from the University to the larger student body re
garding student death has been a source of tension be
tween students who want information and University
officials who seek to respect the privacy of victims and
their families.
University administrators cited federal privacy
laws, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
(FERPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) when explaining why
they are unable to discuss specific cases with The Daily
and the general campus.
