## University gifts football tickets to Redwood City council members 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Alice Phillips 
Three members of the Redwood
City council accepted free football
game tickets from Stanford, which
may have created a conflict of inter
est as the University is currently ne
gotiating with Redwood City on the
development of a satellite campus
on 35 acres adjacent to Highway
101.
The council members involved
Jeff Ira, Barbara Pierce and John
Seybert listed the football tick
ets with other gifts on their 2011 eco
nomic disclosure forms. State law
requires city council members to
disclose all gifts received over the
course of the year.
Ira and Seybert attended the
Card's November matchup against
the University of Oregon with tick
ets gifted from the University. Ac
cording to Ira's disclosure form, the
value of the tickets he accepted was
$270.
"People always ask me [if I saw a
conflict of interest in accepting the
tickets]," Ira told the Palo Alto
Daily News. "If you have any confu
sion, I would call [Stanford] up and
see how [ticked] off they are at me
for all of the things I'm not giving
into."

"It does not impact my decision
making at all," he said.
Pierce accepted one ticket to an
October football game against the
University of Colorado.
Lisa Lapin, Stanford spokesper
son, told the Palo Alto Daily News
that tickets to many university
events such as football games are
regularly offered to local officials.
"We don't single out any partic
ular entity," Lapin said. "Stanford is
in six different jurisdictions, from
Santa Clara County to San Mateo
County, so everyone is given the
same opportunities."
The Stanford in Redwood City
project was prompted by Stan
ford's General Use Permit with
Santa Clara County. The permit
limits how much Stanford can ex
pand on the main campus, so the
University is aiming to relocate ad
ministrative buildings to a satellite
campus in Redwood City to pre
serve main campus space for aca
demic uses.
There are presently no plans for
the University to locate offices on
the site. After construction is com
plete, Stanford plans to continue
leasing office space to third parties.
