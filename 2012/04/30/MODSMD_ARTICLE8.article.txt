# Information theorist Thomas Cover dies at 73
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Alice Phillips 
Stanford electrical engineering
and statistics professor Thomas
Cover M.S. '6l Ph.D. '64 died
March 26 at Stanford Hospital. He
was 73.
Cover made major contributions
to various fields, including informa
tion theory, mathematical statistics,
data compressions, pattern recogni
tion and stock market investment
strategies. His co-written book "Ele
ments of Information Theory" is con
sidered a keystone text for modern
information theory.
Cover was born in San Bernardi
no, Calif., and graduated with a B.S.
in physics from MIT in 1960. He be
came a Stanford School of Engi
neering professor at in 1972, direct
ed the Information Systems Labo
ratory from 1988 to 1994 and was
named the Kwoh-Tmg Li Professor
of Electrical Engineering and Sta
tistics in 1994.
Cover was elected to the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences
in 2003. He was also president of the
Information Theory Society of the
Institute of Electrical and Electron
ics Engineers (lEEE), elected to the
National Academy of Engineering
and named as a fellow by the Amer
ican Association for the Advance
ment of Science, the Institute of
Mathematical Statistics and the
lEEE.
Some of Cover's most important
work concerned broadcast data
transmission. In 1973, his work on
the superposition of signals in
broadcast channels made it possible

to transmit information from one
transmitter to several receivers si
multaneously.
From 1986 to 1994, Cover served
as a statistician for the California
State Lottery while on the faculty at
Stanford, devising ways to beat the
lottery to prevent fraud and design
ing tests for lottery balls and wheels.
Cover is survived by his wife,
Karen, three brothers, two children,
a stepson and four grandchildren. A
memorial service is scheduled for
Oct. 12, 2012, at the University
Alumni Center. More details will be
posted on the Thomas Cover me
