# Three Strikes initiative garners enough signatures
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
More than 830,000 supporters
signed an initiative drafted by mem
bers of Stanford Law School's
Three Strikes Project that, if passed
by voters, would modify California's
Three Strikes Law. State election
officials received the signatures last
Thursday.
The initiative received 504,760
more signatures than needed,
meaning it will appear on the No
vember 2012 ballot pending ap
proval by the secretary of state and
county official boards.
Voters passed California's Three
Strikes Law in 1994. Under the law,
state courts are required to sentence
third-time offenders to 25 years to
life in prison regardless of whether
the third offense is defined as violent
or serious.
Stanford Law School's Three
Strikes Project, established in 2006,
represents individuals serving life
sentences under the law. Michael
Romano, the project's director, told
The Daily in November that the law
has resulted in life imprisonment for
relatively small crimes.
"That is not away to run a state
or a criminal justice policy," Ro
mano said. "A lie sentence for petty
theft or drug possession is exces
sive."
The initiative, which the Three
Strikes Project started crafting
more than a year ago after being ap
proached by the NAACP Legal De
fense Fund, would reduce the sen
tence for third offenses to double
the normal penalty.
Mike Reynolds, who helped
draft the original law after his
daughter Kimber was murdered in
1992, argued against any revisions.
In an interview with The Daily in
November, he said that California
saw a 37 percent drop in crime the
first four years the law was imple
mented.
Reynolds maintained this posi
tion in a recent interview with the
San Jose Mercury News.
"It's easy if you live in Palo Alto,
where Stanford is and where it's
safe, to be for this," Reynolds said.
"The only question voters need to
answer is which of these offenders
with at least two serious or violent

convictions on their record would
you like to have living next door to
you? And if you wouldn't want
them next door to you, why would
you put them next to any California
family?"

Proposition 66, a previous at
tempt to revise the Third Strikes
Law, failed by 3 percent in 2004. This
proposition would have changed
the definition of some felonies and
required that the third offense be a
special violent or serious crime to
mandate the 25 years to life sen

tence. Governor Jerry Brown, then
mayor of Oakland, opposed Propo
sition 66.
Brown has not commented on
the new initiative.
Los Angeles County District At
torney Steve Cooley, a Republican,
and San Francisco District Attorney
George Gascon, a Democrat, how
ever, have both recently thrown
their support behind the latest ini
tiative.
