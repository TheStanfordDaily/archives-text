On April 10,2012, the FDA "concluded that drospirenone-containing birth control pills may be
associated with a higher risk for blood clots than other progestin-containing pills" and revised
the warning label to "report that some epidemiologic studies reported as high as a three-fold
increase in the risk of blood clots" as compared to other pills. More information about the label
change can be found at www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafetv/ucm2993os.htm.
