# Preliminary decision made to build world's largest digital camera

SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory's project to build the
world's largest digital camera ad
vanced last week as it gained Criti
cal Decision 1 approval by the De
partment of Energy. The project,
called the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope (LSST) camera, would
create a 3.2-billion-pixel digital
camera to take data on the visible
sky.
"With 189 sensors and over
three tons of components that

have to be packed into an extreme
ly tight space, you can imagine this
is a very complex instrument," Na
dine Kurita, project manager for
the LSST camera, said to the
SLAC News Center. "But given
the enormous challenges required
to provide such a comprehensive
view of the universe, it's been an in
credible opportunity to design
something so unique."
The camera will take data on
the entire sky in weekly cycles, gen
erating 6 petabytes, or 6 million gi
gabytes, of data every year. This
data could be critical for future re
search on both objects near Earth,
such as asteroids, and larger ques
tions, like the nature of dark mat
ter.
Having passed the Critical De
cision 1 stage, the project will move
on to detailed designs, budgeting
and timelines. However, some
work has already begun on the
camera's main mirror, which will
measure 8.4 meters across. Prepa
rations are also underway at the
final site for the camera, on top of
Cerro Pachon, a mountain near the
Chilean city of Vicuna.
If further approvals are met,
full-scale construction on the cam
era will begin in 2014.
