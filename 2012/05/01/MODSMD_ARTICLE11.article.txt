## MANSION OF MUSIC 
### RAYMOND LUONG 
It has been described by
Stanford students as every
thing from a Spanish man
sion to a Gothic fortress
and even a haunted castle,
but these misconceptions strike
far from the truth.
Perched on top of a hill be
hind Florence Moore Hall, this
mysterious Stanford landmark is
none other than the Knoll, cur
rently home to Stanford's Center
for Computer Research in Music
and Acoustics (CCRMA, pro
nounced "karma").
Designed by architect Louis
Christian Mullgardt in the 1910s,
the Knoll was originally intended
to be the residence of Stanford
President Ray Lyman Wilbur. In
1946, the Knoll became home to
the Stanford Department of
Music and in 1986, CCRMA
moved to the location.
CCRMA was founded in 1975
by John Chowning, a Stanford
professor, researcher, musician
and inventor. Originally located
at the Stanford Artificial Intelli
gence Laboratory on East Cam
pus, CCRMA was founded as a
research center for digital audio
and computer-based technology.
In 1989, the Knoll was dam
aged in the Loma Prieta earth
quake, rendering the third floor
unsafe. As a result, the Knoll un
derwent a major renovation be
tween 2004 and 2005.
Following the renovation, the
Knoll now contains modern
sound studios and open-plan
work spaces. Among the updated
rooms are a 100-seat perform

ance hall for contemporary
music performances and a listen
ing room that allows for individu
als to conduct research in syn
thetic acoustical space,
CCRMA is composed of aca
demic directors, professors and
engineers, but the majority of
CCRMA affiliates are students,
both graduate and undergradu
ate.
"CCRMA is strongly interdis
ciplinary, where physicists, elec
trical engineers, musicians and
artists can come together in one
spot to cross boundaries," said
Chris Carlson M.A. 'l2. "For ex
ample, musicians are learning to
code and engineers are learning
composition."
"There is usually some
strange sound coming from part
of the [building] and students
hacking away at code, but there is
a happy exhaustion," Carlson
said, describing the Knoll envi
ronment on most evenings.
Although the Knoll's atmos
phere is very much research-ori
ented, there is a strong sense of
community that allows for collab
oration on a variety of projects.
"Everyone takes amultidisci
plinary approach to their work
and projects so everyone knows
everything about everything,"
said Jennifer Hsu M.A. 'l3. "This
multidisciplinary approach also
forces you to talk to other people
to learn, so there's this great,
warm community here."
The wide range of ongoing re
search at CCRMA centers on the
idea of approaching the intersec
tion of music, technology and art
from various angles. Researchers
conduct work in sound synthesis,
human computer interaction, en
vironmental sounds, music cogni
tion and sonification, just to
name a few topics.
One current project seeks to
recreate the audio experience of
the Hagia Sophia, a mosque and
museum in Istanbul with very
distinctive acoustics due to its
unique domed ceiling. Another
project focuses on using audio il

lusions and computerized music
to learn more about the human
sense of hearing. Other re
searchers are working with dual
electroencephalograms (EEGs)
and monitoring the brain activity
of two musicians as they perform,
or two people as one performs
and the other listens.
"CCRMA always attracts a
phenomenal mix of people with
diverse interest in arts and engi
neering," said Chris Chafe
D.M.A. 'B3, CCRMA director.
"It's a playground with opportu
nity and new faces."
Chafe extends an open invita
tion to all interested in any of
CCRMA's courses, research
groups or interdisciplinary proj
ects, as students have historically
always been highly involved and
engaged with the organization's
research.
Over the past few years, there
have been significant research
trends at CCRMA.
"In the past, people came
specifically to study something
specific like audio signal process
ing," said Luke Dahl M.A. 'O7
Ph.D. 'l3. "There has been a shift
to more creative and interdisci
plinary projects."
In addition to the increased
interest in interdisciplinary re
search, CCRMA has also in
creased in popularity.
"People have been asking
more and more about music and
CCRMA in the past three to four
years, especially in the under
graduate community," said Steve
Henderson 'OB M.A. 'l2, who has
been working at CCRMA since
his time as an undergraduate.
"I'm frequently asked,' What do I
have to do to get in there?'"
Aside from academic contri
butions, the center holds fre
quent events and activities, on
subjects from neurocognition
and perceptual audio to the
physics of music, digital signal
processing, audio engineering,
music production and computer
science.
The Knoll's auditorium, with

equipment such as a state-of-the
art surround sound system, a
grand piano and a multi-screen
video projection system, is also
home to many concerts, often
featuring computer music com
posed by students and faculty.
The outdoor space behind the
building also hosts musical
events.
In addition, the center holds
its annual concert, Modulations,
each April in San Francisco,
showcasing leading electronic

musicians, dancers and sound in
stallations from both guest and
CCRMA artists.
However, the core focus of the
center remains its research proj
ects. In ten years, Chafe predicts a
greater emphasis on mobile and
biological computing with an
even greater focus on interdisci
plinary projects.
"It's going to be fun," he said.

rooms are a 100-seat perform

ance hall for contemporary
music performances and a listen
ing room that allows for individu
als to conduct research in syn
thetic acoustical space,
CCRMA is composed of aca
demic directors, professors and
engineers, but the majority of
CCRMA affiliates are students,
both graduate and undergradu
ate.
"CCRMA is strongly interdis
ciplinary, where physicists, elec
trical engineers, musicians and
artists can come together in one
spot to cross boundaries," said
Chris Carlson M.A. 'l2. "For ex
ample, musicians are learning to
code and engineers are learning
composition."
"There is usually some
strange sound coming from part
of the [building] and students
hacking away at code, but there is
a happy exhaustion," Carlson
said, describing the Knoll envi
ronment on most evenings.
Although the Knoll's atmos
phere is very much research-ori
ented, there is a strong sense of
community that allows for collab
oration on a variety of projects.
"Everyone takes amultidisci
plinary approach to their work
and projects so everyone knows
everything about everything,"
said Jennifer Hsu M.A. 'l3. "This
multidisciplinary approach also
forces you to talk to other people
to learn, so there's this great,
warm community here."
The wide range of ongoing re
search at CCRMA centers on the
idea of approaching the intersec
tion of music, technology and art
from various angles. Researchers
conduct work in sound synthesis,
human computer interaction, en
vironmental sounds, music cogni
tion and sonification, just to
name a few topics.
One current project seeks to
recreate the audio experience of
the Hagia Sophia, a mosque and
museum in Istanbul with very
distinctive acoustics due to its
unique domed ceiling. Another
project focuses on using audio il

lusions and computerized music
to learn more about the human
sense of hearing. Other re
searchers are working with dual
electroencephalograms (EEGs)
and monitoring the brain activity
of two musicians as they perform,
or two people as one performs
and the other listens.
"CCRMA always attracts a
phenomenal mix of people with
diverse interest in arts and engi
neering," said Chris Chafe
D.M.A. 'B3, CCRMA director.
"It's a playground with opportu
nity and new faces."
Chafe extends an open invita
tion to all interested in any of
CCRMA's courses, research
groups or interdisciplinary proj
ects, as students have historically
always been highly involved and
engaged with the organization's
research.
Over the past few years, there
have been significant research
trends at CCRMA.
"In the past, people came
specifically to study something
specific like audio signal process
ing," said Luke Dahl M.A. 'O7
Ph.D. 'l3. "There has been a shift
to more creative and interdisci
plinary projects."
In addition to the increased
interest in interdisciplinary re
search, CCRMA has also in
creased in popularity.
"People have been asking
more and more about music and
CCRMA in the past three to four
years, especially in the under
graduate community," said Steve
Henderson 'OB M.A. 'l2, who has
been working at CCRMA since
his time as an undergraduate.
"I'm frequently asked,' What do I
have to do to get in there?'"
Aside from academic contri
butions, the center holds fre
quent events and activities, on
subjects from neurocognition
and perceptual audio to the
physics of music, digital signal
processing, audio engineering,
music production and computer
science.
The Knoll's auditorium, with

equipment such as a state-of-the
art surround sound system, a
grand piano and a multi-screen
video projection system, is also
home to many concerts, often
featuring computer music com
posed by students and faculty.
The outdoor space behind the
building also hosts musical
events.
In addition, the center holds
its annual concert, Modulations,
each April in San Francisco,
showcasing leading electronic

musicians, dancers and sound in
stallations from both guest and
CCRMA artists.
However, the core focus of the
center remains its research proj
ects. In ten years, Chafe predicts a
greater emphasis on mobile and
biological computing with an
even greater focus on interdisci
plinary projects.
"It's going to be fun," he said.

It has been described by
Stanford students as every
thing from a Spanish man
sion to a Gothic fortress
and even a haunted castle,
but these misconceptions strike
far from the truth.
Perched on top of a hill be
hind Florence Moore Hall, this
mysterious Stanford landmark is
none other than the Knoll, cur
rently home to Stanford's Center
for Computer Research in Music
and Acoustics (CCRMA, pro
nounced "karma").
Designed by architect Louis
Christian Mullgardt in the 1910s,
the Knoll was originally intended
to be the residence of Stanford
President Ray Lyman Wilbur. In
1946, the Knoll became home to
the Stanford Department of
Music and in 1986, CCRMA
moved to the location.
CCRMA was founded in 1975
by John Chowning, a Stanford
professor, researcher, musician
and inventor. Originally located
at the Stanford Artificial Intelli
gence Laboratory on East Cam
pus, CCRMA was founded as a
research center for digital audio
and computer-based technology.
In 1989, the Knoll was dam
aged in the Loma Prieta earth
quake, rendering the third floor
unsafe. As a result, the Knoll un
derwent a major renovation be
tween 2004 and 2005.
Following the renovation, the
Knoll now contains modern
sound studios and open-plan
