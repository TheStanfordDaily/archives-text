# A 						FRIEND IN 5-SURE
## 
### KADEN FREEMAN 
The drivers at 5-
SURE don't mind if
you're a regular. In
fact, they are more
than happy to pick
you up, whether it's your first
time calling or a thrice-weekly
habit.
Students United for Risk
Elimination (5-SURE) is an or
ganization that dispatches driv
ers to students in need of a ride
on campus. The program
emerged in the 1970s as Stu
dents United for Rape Elimina
tion (SURE). In its early days,
SURE had no cars and func
tioned more as a buddy-system
service, sending male volunteers
on bikes to walk with students
on their way home.
This system ran into some
controversy, with many critics
arguing that the service was
chauvinistic and an improper
way to address the problem of
female rape, so teams of female
volunteers were added to the
group to begin escorting stu
dents home.
Demand for SURE's escorts
dwindled in the 1980s, and the
organization eventually
stopped running. However, in
creased interest in the group's
services in the 1990s brought the
organization back from the
dead this time with golf carts.
The carts helped ridership surge
and rooted 5-SURE into cam
pus culture.
Today, 5-SURE is Universi
ty-funded and operates seven
days a week except during fi
nals and dead week from 9:00
p.m. to 1:45 a.m. Along with a
golf cart, the organization now
has a car and an enthusiastic
team of student drivers.
On one Saturday night,
Amelia Herrera 'l2, Jodie Ha
'l4 and Laura Potter 'l4 manned
the front desk, with one of the
three occasionally stepping out
to pick someone up, while fre
quent bouts of laughter carried
through the lobby of Old Union.
"I work for 5-SURE because
it's a good program," Herrera
said. "In the light of several re
cent incidents on campus, it's im
portant for students to have a
means of getting home safe, and
I'm more than happy to do my
part to make that a reality."
"Being a driver is a really en
tertaining job, you get to hear
lots of stories about where peo
ple are coming from and where
they're going," Ha added.
When asked if she could re
count a specific memorable ex
perience she had while driving,
Ha whispered to Herrera and
the two burst out laughing.
In the name of driver confi
dentiality, the two decided to
paraphrase.
"You meet some interesting
people," Ha said with a chuckle.
"Sometimes you get people
who can be a little rowdy, but
I've never had an experience

where someone has been out of
control or where I have felt un
safe as a driver," Herrera said.
According to Potter, "There
are definitely regulars, people
who we see almost every night,
but for some people who live in
Oak Creek [Apartments] or EV
[Escondido Village], they need
us to be able to get home safely
each night."
"It's actually kind of funny,
I'll sometimes see them in the
daytime and say hello, but they
don't always recognize me," she
continued.
Another round of laughter at
the table hinted that this phe
nomenon is familiar to all 5-
SURE drivers.
With services running every
day until 1:45 a.m., 5-SURE
drivers are in for some late
nights. However, this didn't ap
pear to faze any of the three
drivers.
"5-SURE is a very student
friendly organization, even for
us as employees," Herrera said.
"If you have a midterm or a
paper due, it's not difficult to
find someone to cover your
shit."
"We're not open during fi
nals because we're students,
too," Ha said. "But if you're at
work and it's a slow night with
no calls coming in, it's no prob
lem to do some of your work
while you're at the desk."
The fact that 5-SURE drivers
are fellow students with "limited
resources" is something all three
women agreed they would like
students to keep in mind.
"We're not a limo service,
and we don't have a huge fleet of
cars," Herrera said. "We're a
group of one dispatcher and two
drivers each night, and one of
our vehicles is a golf cart that
can't go over twenty miles per
hour."
"Sometimes, we get callers
who react impolitely when we
tell them there will be a 15 or 20
minute wait for a ride or who
treat us rudely as we're driving
them," Ha interjected.
Despite the occasional ill
mannered passenger, Herrera,
Ha and Potter all agreed that
they love their job.
"I've picked up people from
situations in which they really
did feel unsafe," Potter said.
"Even if they're drunk ... as a
driver you get to experience a lot
of really heartwarming occa
sions that remind you that
you're helping people."
"At the end of the day, there
are plenty of other jobs on cam
pus that are a lot more conven
ient without the late hours, but
anyone who is here at 5-SURE
is here to help others," Herrera
said.
With that, Herrera answered
the phone and dispatched Potter
to pick up someone from EV.
All in a night's work.

tertaining job, you get to hear
lots of stories about where peo
ple are coming from and where
they're going," Ha added.
When asked if she could re
count a specific memorable ex
perience she had while driving,
Ha whispered to Herrera and
the two burst out laughing.
In the name of driver confi
dentiality, the two decided to
paraphrase.
"You meet some interesting
people," Ha said with a chuckle.
"Sometimes you get people
who can be a little rowdy, but
I've never had an experience

where someone has been out of
control or where I have felt un
safe as a driver," Herrera said.
According to Potter, "There
are definitely regulars, people
who we see almost every night,
but for some people who live in
Oak Creek [Apartments] or EV
[Escondido Village], they need
us to be able to get home safely
each night."
"It's actually kind of funny,
I'll sometimes see them in the
daytime and say hello, but they
don't always recognize me," she
continued.
Another round of laughter at
the table hinted that this phe
nomenon is familiar to all 5-
SURE drivers.
With services running every
day until 1:45 a.m., 5-SURE
drivers are in for some late
nights. However, this didn't ap
pear to faze any of the three
drivers.
"5-SURE is a very student
friendly organization, even for
us as employees," Herrera said.
"If you have a midterm or a
paper due, it's not difficult to
find someone to cover your
shit."
"We're not open during fi
nals because we're students,
too," Ha said. "But if you're at
work and it's a slow night with
no calls coming in, it's no prob
lem to do some of your work
while you're at the desk."
The fact that 5-SURE drivers
are fellow students with "limited
resources" is something all three
women agreed they would like
students to keep in mind.
"We're not a limo service,
and we don't have a huge fleet of
cars," Herrera said. "We're a
group of one dispatcher and two
drivers each night, and one of
our vehicles is a golf cart that
can't go over twenty miles per
hour."
"Sometimes, we get callers
who react impolitely when we
tell them there will be a 15 or 20
minute wait for a ride or who
treat us rudely as we're driving
them," Ha interjected.
Despite the occasional ill
mannered passenger, Herrera,
Ha and Potter all agreed that
they love their job.
"I've picked up people from
situations in which they really
did feel unsafe," Potter said.
"Even if they're drunk ... as a
driver you get to experience a lot
of really heartwarming occa
sions that remind you that
you're helping people."
"At the end of the day, there
are plenty of other jobs on cam
pus that are a lot more conven
ient without the late hours, but
anyone who is here at 5-SURE
is here to help others," Herrera
said.
With that, Herrera answered
the phone and dispatched Potter
to pick up someone from EV.
All in a night's work.

Stanford's Students United for Risk Elimination (5-SURE) provides
free rides for students across campus.
The drivers at 5-
SURE don't mind if
you're a regular. In
fact, they are more
than happy to pick
you up, whether it's your first
time calling or a thrice-weekly
habit.
Students United for Risk
Elimination (5-SURE) is an or
ganization that dispatches driv
ers to students in need of a ride
on campus. The program
emerged in the 1970s as Stu
dents United for Rape Elimina
tion (SURE). In its early days,
SURE had no cars and func
tioned more as a buddy-system
service, sending male volunteers
on bikes to walk with students
on their way home.
This system ran into some
controversy, with many critics
arguing that the service was
chauvinistic and an improper
way to address the problem of
female rape, so teams of female
volunteers were added to the
group to begin escorting stu
dents home.
Demand for SURE's escorts
dwindled in the 1980s, and the
organization eventually
stopped running. However, in
creased interest in the group's
services in the 1990s brought the
organization back from the
dead this time with golf carts.
The carts helped ridership surge
and rooted 5-SURE into cam
pus culture.
Today, 5-SURE is Universi
ty-funded and operates seven
days a week except during fi
nals and dead week from 9:00
p.m. to 1:45 a.m. Along with a
golf cart, the organization now
has a car and an enthusiastic
team of student drivers.
On one Saturday night,
Amelia Herrera 'l2, Jodie Ha
'l4 and Laura Potter 'l4 manned
the front desk, with one of the
three occasionally stepping out
to pick someone up, while fre
quent bouts of laughter carried
through the lobby of Old Union.
"I work for 5-SURE because
it's a good program," Herrera
said. "In the light of several re
cent incidents on campus, it's im
portant for students to have a
means of getting home safe, and
I'm more than happy to do my
part to make that a reality."
"Being a driver is a really en
