## OP-ED On the Alternative Review Process and role modeling 
### MONA THOMPSON'13 Publicity Coordinator, Women's Community Center 
The ASSU Senate will vote
today on whether or not to
formally approve the Judi
cial Affairs Alternative Review
Process (ARP) for sexual assault
and relationship abuse, a pro
gram that has been piloted for
two years and has seen a dramat
ic increase in the number of re
ported assaults on campus. Most
people have attributed this in
crease in reports to the fact that
the ARP is seen as a safer, more
personal and more welcoming
system in which victims feel
more comfortable coming for
ward. I am concerned that the
Senate discussion of the ARP
process and articles covering the
approval seem to be getting
caught up in a few small details
and are losing sight of the larger
picture.

There seems to be a miscon
ception that the Alternative Re
view Process is this big bad scary
process created with the intent
of wrongfully expelling all the
men on campus. In fact, the ARP
is in place to create an equal sys
tem of justice and support both
parties in a case of alleged sexu
al assault or relationship abuse.
The language of the ARP in
cludes extensive lists of the
rights of the responding student
(the alleged perpetrator) and of
the impacted party (the alleged
victim). In fact, most of these
rights are identical and include
services such as a personal advi
sor to see each party through the
process and the right of both par
ties to have their confidentiality
upheld to the extent permitted
by law and University policy.
Both parties also have the right
to appeal the verdict (and this
right is not going anywhere be
cause, along with the burden of
proof, it was one of the Title IX
recommendations from the fed
eral government last year). Also,
if expulsion is recommended for
the responding student by the re
viewers, the Provost will have the
ultimate say in the matter. And
even if the student is expelled,
the specific charges will not ap
pear on their transcript; it will

just read "discontinued."
The other question that critics
seem to be getting hung up on is
the validity of the ARP versus a
"real" legal procedure outside of
Stanford. Any arguments made
by comparing the ARP to other
legal procedures are essentially
irrelevant: In a "real" legal pro
cedure there might be more than
four jurors deciding a case, but
also in a "real" legal procedure a
guilty verdict would mean about
five years in jail and permanent
ly having one's name on the Sex
Offender Registry, not just leav
ing Stanford with no record of
sexual assault on one's tran
script.
So, if we can agree that Stan
ford is not identical to a com
plex, real-world legal system
whose ultimate goal is to put
rapists in jail and make sure
they never live within a certain
distance from a school or other
setting with small children, then
what is Stanford's ultimate goal
as an educational institution?
Our Fundamental Standard
states, "Students at Stanford are
expected to show both within
and without the University such
respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens." Just as allowing a stu
dent to continue to cheat on
exams compromises our aca
demic integrity as an institution,
allowing students to assault or
abuse other students compro
mises both our moral integrity
as well as the sense of safety and
comfort that we work so hard to
maintain on this campus. (And
just as one might imagine how
someone who gets away with
cheating on a test might feel
comfortable cheating again, re
search shows that the average
perpetrator commits six sexual
assaults.) Angela Exson, the As
sistant Dean of Sexual Assault
and Relationship Abuse at
Stanford, has spent over 12
years working with various is
sues of sexual assault and rela-
tionship abuse and describes the
ARP as one of the best existing
models of an equitable system
around these issues. The ARP al
lows us to in addition to the
federal Title IX regulations

create a system that is specific to
Stanford and to the individual
needs and circumstances of all
parties involved in each case.
And, if we have the opportunity
to become a role model of an eq
uitable student judicial process,
why wouldn't we?
