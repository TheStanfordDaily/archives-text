# Do we want to educate students to assume guilt?
## 
### ILAN WURMAN, J.D. '13 
Tonight's discussion of, and
possible vote on, the Alter
native Review Process for
sexual assault cases may be a
defining moment for our campus.
In deciding to keep our current
standards of due process in such
cases the presumption of inno
cence, a reasonable doubt stan
dard, a jury of six, the right of con
frontation, and a prohibition on
double jeopardy, among other
protections or to abandon
them in favor of a system where
an accused student is not pre
sumed innocent, may be convict
ed on a bare preponderance stan
dard, and has no right to an open
hearing, to call or cross examine
witnesses (including the accuser),
or to be represented, we decide
what kind of citizens we want the
university to educate.
Do we want to educate stu
dents to assume guilt? Or do we
want to eucate them to take seri
ously the notions of due process
central to the protection of our
rights outside the university set
ting? Many have argued that a
university's judicial board is not a
criminal trial, and is more akin to
civil proceedings in which a pre
ponderance standard prevails.
That is not the case. In the adjudi
catory context, universities are
more like societies than private
entities. In a civil proceeding, pri
vate citizens sue other private cit
izens, and the remedy requires the
wrongdoer to pay the plaintiff for
the wrong he has suffered. No
other penalty attaches. Here,
however, the accused stands as a
member of the university's socie
ty, and it is the society that is pros
ecuting him; and societal punish
ments attach to a conviction. One
need not elaborate on the conse
quences of long-term suspensions
or expulsions the student is de
prived of an education, has a per
manent record, will find it much
more difficult to secure employ
ment, and the like. These kinds of
consequences do not follow from
any civil proceeding of which I am
aware. Even so, civil proceedings
in the United States also have sev

eral of the protections the ARP
would deny our students, from the
right to call and cross examine
witnesses in an open hearing, to
representation, and to a unani
mous jury verdict of between six
and twelve peers.
It is true, as a legal matter, that
the university can adopt whichev
er policy it wants. It can adopt the
protections afforded defendants
in criminal trials, civil trials, or no
protections at all. The question is
which process it ought to adopt. It
is important to point out, more
over, that it is not true as a legal
matter that Stanford University
must comply with the "Dear Col
league" letter from the federal
Department of Education, which
urged universities receiving fed
eral funding to adopt a prepon
derance of the evidence standard.
I raise this point because it seems
to have been of particular concern
to some students on the Graduate
Student Council.
As the letter itself states, all
the law actually requires is that
"all recipients ... adopt and pub
lish grievance procedures provid
ing for the prompt and equitable
resolution of sex discrimination
complaints." The key is what con
stitutes a "prompt and equitable"
resolution. The author of the
Dear Colleague letter stated that
a "school must use a preponder
ance of the evidence standard" if
it is to be consistent with Title IX.
This is simply not the case.
Schools must use this standard if
they are to be consistent with the
Education Department's guid
ance, but guidance documents are
not enforceable as law. Their
rules must go through the notice
and-comment process spelled out
in the Administrative Procedures
Act. Guidance documents have
come to dominate the regulatory
scene, but as the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Cir
cuit has written, "It is well-estab
lished that an agency may not es
cape the notice and comment re
quirements ... by labeling a
major substantive legal addition
to a rule a mere interpretation."
If a guidance document purports
to make law that is not estab
lished in a congressionally enact
ed statute,"[tjhis it cannot legally
do without complying with the

rulemaking procedures." 1 The
Department of Education has
not complied with the rulemak
ing processes here, and Stanford
University need not follow its
lead â€” and perhaps we ought
not to.
