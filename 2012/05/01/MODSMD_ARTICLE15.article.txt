# HALF-INVENTED
## Liar! (It takes one to know one) 
### Chase Ishii 
There's a concept in every
form of storytelling known
as the unreliable narrator. It
basically means the person telling
the story has been compromised
and can't fully be trusted. Oh, ex
amples you say? (Spoiler Alert:
I'm about to reveal some big
twists. So if you haven't seen
"Fight Club" or read "The Catch
er in the Rye" yet, then, "spoiler
alert," you've been living under a
rock for the last 13 years. C'mon!)
In "Fight Club," you get about
three quarters of the way through
the movie before you realize Brad
Pitt is actually Edward Norton,
just with a cooler jacket and bet
ter abs. Or think back to when you
read "The Catcher in the Rye" in
high school and only in the last
chapter did you find out Holden
Caulfield was crazy the whole
time. Or when this girl tells you
"The Notebook" is really sad and
you're going to cry and then you
watch the whole thing and it turns
out nothing is sad because they
end up together ... or something
like that. It shakes you up a bit.
You have to go back and decipher
what was really true in it all. So
Edward Norton blew his own
apartment up? And is that why
people think I'm cool if I name
drop "The Catcher in the Rye"?
And are all girls unreliable narra
tors, or just that girl?
Another Spoiler Alert: We're
all unreliable narrators in our own
lives. That's just the way life is. It
doesn't mean we're liars necessar
ily; it just means we can't be objec
tive and distanced from our own
emotions and desires. The way we
perceive, understand and react to
the world around us is completely

dependent upon our emotions,
our experiences (or lack thereof)
and the fact that we can only get
inside our own heads and not any
one else's. We're all unreliable,
and some are more unreliable
than others.
For example, if you ask a friend
why they broke up with their sig
nificant other and their answer is,
"Well, he/she is just a [insert en
thusiastic curse word]," then
they're probably a little unreliable
on the subject. Or if you ask a
friend in a fraternity or sorority
how they did in rush this year and
they answer, "We totally de
stroyed everyone else. Best pledge
class ever!" they're probably a bit
unreliable too. Or if a friend uses
the phrase "YOLO" for whatever
reason, even sarcastically, they are
100 percent unreliable and you
should probably re-evaluate how
you choose your friends.
So if we're all unreliable narra
tors, why does it even matter?
That is a fantastic and convenient
ly timed question that I just in
cepted into your brain. There are
some major benefits when we re
member our viewpoint isn't the
only viewpoint, and probably isn't
even the most accurate viewpoint.
The only thing we can ever be sure
of about our unreliability is that it
will always be unreliable to an ex
tent. So the best we can do to min
imize our own bias is to under
stand it as fully as possible.
When we acknowledge we are
unreliable and our objectivity has
been compromised, we stop sup
posing the intentions of others
and start focusing on our own. If I
get one of those lovely passive-ag
gressive Stanford emails that I

feel is attacking me, it's really
easy, and even fair according to
my unreliability, to shoot a less
passive, more-aggressive email
back at the person who is trying to
hurt me. But, if I acknowledge
that I am emotionally biased be
cause I feel threatened, then I can
entertain the possibility that my
emotions are reading negativity
into the email and it may not be
there at all. Knowing my gut reac
tion may be wrong, I can respond
more patiently and constructively.
This allows for more grace
when dealing with others because
our conception of "fairness" be
comes closer to the truth. Because
I can only know my side of the
story and my intentions, I'm really
only working with half a deck. I
can do my best to imagine or as
sume what the other person in
tended or experienced, but I'll
probably end up selling them
short. Either way, even if I can fab
ricate a complete understanding
of the situation, it'll always be
half-invented, and fairness based
on only half-truths isn't fair at all.
This forces us to have real authen
tic conversations, discussions and
even confrontations with each
other. It allows us to focus on our
own shortcomings rather than
that of others, and to treat each
other with humility and grace.
And that is the truth.

reliable Chase is, or you are still
angry he spoiled Fight Club (or The
Notebook) for you, email him at
