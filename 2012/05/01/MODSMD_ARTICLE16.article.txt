# FROM FARM TO FORK
## Contemplating students' needs 
### Jenny Rempel 
In less than three hours last Fri
day, two friends and I harvested
snap peas, red leaf lettuce,
cilantro, kale, chives and dozens of
dwarfish carrots whose size belied
their sugar content. We pulled up all
the old plants and a few weeds, dou
ble dug the beds to aerate the soil
and planted a smattering of new
seeds. The garden beds were
prepped and ready for new growth.
Harvesting, weeding, digging
and sowing offered me a chance to
reflect. Gardening provides a
space to consider what I am actual
ly learning while at Stanford, what
I value and where I seek to create
value in the world. Working the
land even a small patch of it
offers a time for inward contem
plation.
But growing food does not need
to be a solitary, meditative activity.
Weekly pizza parties on the Stan
ford Community Farm are joyous,
noisy, laughter-filled, lip-smacking
affairs. It's hard to shovel a truck
load of compost next to someone
without sharing stories and form
ing a casual friendship. These work
parties feature undergraduates
majoring in everything from earth
systems to religious studies, gradu
ate students in business as well as
sociology, staff members, faculty
members, families with children
and, of course, pizza. (Chickens
usually make an appearance, too.)
More than learning about soil
structure or the proper technique
for turning a compost pile, these
work parties are a chance to build
community.
Sadly, only a tiny fraction of the
Stanford population has had the
opportunity to reflect, grow and
build community in this cherished
space. Plans are underway to ex
pand the campus education farm,

which is currently less than an
eighth of an acre, but the develop
ment of a larger space for food sys
tems education has been stalled for
several years.
Breaking ground on a new farm
will be a meaningful step forward
for the growing community of indi
viduals interested in food. Current
farming classes are routinely over
subscribed, and Farm Educator
Patrick Archie is in high demand.
Undergraduate and graduate stu
dents interested in food would like
a larger space for hands-on, experi
ential learning, and students and
faculty alike would love receiving
resources enabling them to pursue
projects in the food sphere, from
nutrition to social justice to obesity
to business ventures. When com
pared to Berkeley, UC-Davis and
even Yale, Stanford pales in its food
education.
I am beyond grateful that Stan
ford has even a small plot of land
where I get to dirty my hands and
marvel at the wonders of plant
growth and food production. But I
am routinely confronted by oppor
tunities for improvement.
Food unites communities and
provides a meaningful context for
examining and applying topics as
wide-ranging as physics (crucial to
soil structure), economics (central
to for-profit and non-profit foodie
ventures) and ethics (important for
everything from farmworkers'
rights to meat consumption). The
acts of farming and cooking each
provide a beautiful space for con
templation. Yet when $4.2 million
flows into the University for the es
tablishment of a "contemplative
center," the trustees have agreed to
build a second art museum.
I am deeply grateful for the
alumni donations that have made

my Stanford experience possible. In
light of ongoing mental health and
wellness struggles on campus, I am
also grateful that University offi
cials recognize the need for spaces
that encourage reflection and bal
ance. And I am thrilled to see
greater support of the arts on an en
gineering campus known for its
"Get Rich U" entrepreneurial
mindset. But I can think of many
more strategic uses of $4.2 million
than a new art museum.
Through classes on philanthro
py and my own activism I have
learned an important message:
New initiatives will not be truly suc
cessful unless the recipients are
partners in the planning process.
Lest this be too difficult, it is impor
tant to at least listen to grant recipi
ents' needs and wants. Without lis
tening, it is impossible to be a strate
gic philanthropist, because you can
not simply intuit the needs of a
community that is not your own.
Because I know my foodie
dreams of a production farm in the
Santa Cruz mountains are shared
by only a handful of my peers, I
asked around about how students
might spend $4.2 million. In speak
ing with my peers, I've heard recur
ring themes. Stanford students want
the University to focus more on
wellness, with an emphasis on men
tal health. They want to build com
munity. That $4.2 million could
have funded expanded mental
health services on campus, or en

dowed more diverse faculty posi
tions, or improved and expanded
upon existing community centers.
Obviously my subset of friends is
biased toward the progressive ac
tivist community, and I'm sure
there are individuals who would be
equally happy if more funding was
spent on new athletic facilities or a
series of concerts like the upcoming

Frost Revival. But I highly doubt a
second art museum is at the top of
many students' lists of needs and
wants particularly given the ex
isting under-appreciation of our
current art museum.
For a fraction of that $4.2 million,
we could easily provide a space for
contemplation on a new campus
farm. And donors would have the
pleasure of knowing this is some
thing students really want and need.

What would you do with $4.2 mil
lion? Let Jenny know at jrempel

might spend $4.2 million. In speak
ing with my peers, I've heard recur
ring themes. Stanford students want
the University to focus more on
wellness, with an emphasis on men
tal health. They want to build com
munity. That $4.2 million could
have funded expanded mental
health services on campus, or en

dowed more diverse faculty posi
tions, or improved and expanded
upon existing community centers.
Obviously my subset of friends is
biased toward the progressive ac
tivist community, and I'm sure
there are individuals who would be
equally happy if more funding was
spent on new athletic facilities or a
series of concerts like the upcoming

Frost Revival. But I highly doubt a
second art museum is at the top of
many students' lists of needs and
wants particularly given the ex
isting under-appreciation of our
current art museum.
For a fraction of that $4.2 million,
we could easily provide a space for
contemplation on a new campus
farm. And donors would have the
pleasure of knowing this is some
thing students really want and need.

What would you do with $4.2 mil

In less than three hours last Fri
day, two friends and I harvested
snap peas, red leaf lettuce,
cilantro, kale, chives and dozens of
dwarfish carrots whose size belied
their sugar content. We pulled up all
the old plants and a few weeds, dou
ble dug the beds to aerate the soil
and planted a smattering of new
seeds. The garden beds were
prepped and ready for new growth.
Harvesting, weeding, digging
and sowing offered me a chance to
reflect. Gardening provides a
space to consider what I am actual
ly learning while at Stanford, what
I value and where I seek to create
value in the world. Working the
land even a small patch of it
offers a time for inward contem
plation.
But growing food does not need
to be a solitary, meditative activity.
Weekly pizza parties on the Stan
ford Community Farm are joyous,
noisy, laughter-filled, lip-smacking
affairs. It's hard to shovel a truck
load of compost next to someone
without sharing stories and form
ing a casual friendship. These work
parties feature undergraduates
majoring in everything from earth
systems to religious studies, gradu
ate students in business as well as
sociology, staff members, faculty
members, families with children
and, of course, pizza. (Chickens
usually make an appearance, too.)
More than learning about soil
structure or the proper technique
for turning a compost pile, these
work parties are a chance to build
community.
Sadly, only a tiny fraction of the
Stanford population has had the
opportunity to reflect, grow and
build community in this cherished
space. Plans are underway to ex
pand the campus education farm,

which is currently less than an
eighth of an acre, but the develop
ment of a larger space for food sys
tems education has been stalled for
several years.
Breaking ground on a new farm
will be a meaningful step forward
for the growing community of indi
viduals interested in food. Current
farming classes are routinely over
subscribed, and Farm Educator
Patrick Archie is in high demand.
Undergraduate and graduate stu
dents interested in food would like
a larger space for hands-on, experi
ential learning, and students and
faculty alike would love receiving
resources enabling them to pursue
projects in the food sphere, from
nutrition to social justice to obesity
to business ventures. When com
pared to Berkeley, UC-Davis and
even Yale, Stanford pales in its food
education.
I am beyond grateful that Stan
ford has even a small plot of land
where I get to dirty my hands and
marvel at the wonders of plant
growth and food production. But I
am routinely confronted by oppor
tunities for improvement.
Food unites communities and
provides a meaningful context for
examining and applying topics as
wide-ranging as physics (crucial to
soil structure), economics (central
to for-profit and non-profit foodie
ventures) and ethics (important for
everything from farmworkers'
rights to meat consumption). The
acts of farming and cooking each
provide a beautiful space for con
templation. Yet when $4.2 million
flows into the University for the es
tablishment of a "contemplative
center," the trustees have agreed to
build a second art museum.
I am deeply grateful for the
alumni donations that have made

my Stanford experience possible. In
light of ongoing mental health and
wellness struggles on campus, I am
also grateful that University offi
cials recognize the need for spaces
that encourage reflection and bal
ance. And I am thrilled to see
greater support of the arts on an en
gineering campus known for its
"Get Rich U" entrepreneurial
mindset. But I can think of many
more strategic uses of $4.2 million
than a new art museum.
Through classes on philanthro
py and my own activism I have
learned an important message:
New initiatives will not be truly suc
cessful unless the recipients are
partners in the planning process.
Lest this be too difficult, it is impor
tant to at least listen to grant recipi
ents' needs and wants. Without lis
tening, it is impossible to be a strate
gic philanthropist, because you can
not simply intuit the needs of a
community that is not your own.
Because I know my foodie
dreams of a production farm in the
Santa Cruz mountains are shared
by only a handful of my peers, I
asked around about how students
might spend $4.2 million. In speak
