## Baseball's critical error 
### Tom Taylor 
I discovered a very late piece of
mail waiting for me at the Daily
offices last week. Opening it in
trepidation, fearing a torrent of
abuse from some disgruntled
sports enthusiast enraged by some
thing I'd scribbled down in one of my
columns, I was pleasantly surprised to
get a fan letter.
Though followers of my work will
probably agree that I'm no expert
when it comes to American sports,
maybe this means I've actually
learned something in my four years at
Stanford and I'm not quite the novice
I once was. Two weeks ago, I even
helped reassure an American friend
who seemed a little distraught over
the fact that months after the college
season finished, quarterback Andrew
Luck still hadn't found a place on an
NFL team. Now that the draft has fi
nally taken place, I'm sure she is re
lieved to know he's managed to se
cure a job after graduation.
On second thought, maybe I have
a ways to go.
As a couple of friends from back
home across the pond were visiting
me last week, I felt I needed to give
them the full American college expe
rience and drag them along to a varsi
ty game. With football and basketball
both on hiatus, the natural choice
seemed to be baseball (Stanford ver
sus BYU on Tuesday, April 24 to be
exact).
It didn't start well. Failing to ac
count for San Francisco traffic, my
friends showed up an hour late. We
missed both the playing of the nation
al anthem, the most iconic image of an
all American pastime, and a five-run
second inning by the Card that threat
ened to be the most exciting period of
the whole game. Once inside, settling
into our seats, I realized my most seri
ous mistake. My knowledgeable
sports journalist facade melted away
as the horrible truth dawned on me: I
know nothing about baseball.
Yes, of course I know what a run
is and can string together some of the
basic rules, but the tactics, strategy
and crucial nuances upon which a
game may hinge are alien to me.
Hoping to impart a little bit of what
makes college sports so fascinating
to my friends, I was left instead
grasping at straws. The blind leading
the blind, we managed to extract
some of the details, but I can't help
but feel that baseball could have
tried a little harder, too.
On one particular play, a BYU
outfielder made a clear mistake,
throwing the ball to no one in partic
ular. That much I got, until unhelpful
ly the scoreboard informed me that
this error had the code E-7. Surpris
ingly I wasn't carrying a baseball
rulebook on me to translate this and,
as far as I was aware, E-7 could equal
ly as well have been some kind of
technical malfunction. Perhaps I
needed to be carrying the score
board user's manual.
I guess this number may have
been useful to the handful of folks
who seemed to be filling out their own
scorecards during the game, which, on
its own, is an equally confusing tradi
tion. I don't usually go to sporting
events to play bingo I generally
hope that the action will be exciting
enough on its own. Does someone
collect these sheets at the end of the
game and grade them?
Perhaps some of you may feel that
I should have done some homework
before just showing up at a baseball
game, but this wasn't the classroom. I
want to have fun as a fan, not feel the
need to study and take notes.
Cold, frustrated and a little bit
bored, we eventually crumbled and
committed the cardinal sin of leaving
early ironically, as I discovered
later, just before BYU's exciting
seven-run eighth inning that almost
squared the contest.
Now I hope my slightly tongue
in-cheek attack at baseball hasn't of
fended you because I'd much rather
receive more fan mail (however late
it may reach me) than hate mail, and
because I do have a serious point,
too. I'm not that stupid. If millions
and millions of people follow the
sport, there must be a good reason,
even though this has so far eluded
me. My message to baseball is that
there must be more like me, frustrat
ed and put off by your crypticness.
In spite of everything, including
my devotion to soccer in particular, I
promise I'll give you another chance.
But please, just tell me what E-7
means.

The Stanford Daily had to put Tom
Taylor in a straight jacket to prevent
another soccer column. Let him out
