# GOLDEN GIBBS

### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
It was a story of singles success for the Stan
ford women's tennis team, as sophomore
Nicole Gibbs won the Pac-12 singles champi
onship in Ojai, Calif., this weekend, losing a
total of four games in her final four matches.
Two other Stanford players, juniors Mallo
ry Burdette and Stacey Tan, made it to the
semifinals of the singles draw, making this the
second year in a row that Stanford accounted
for three out of the four semifinalists at the
Pac-12 championship. The team of Gibbs and
Burdette also made it to the finals of the dou
bles draw, where they fell 6-4, 6-4 to Kaitlyn
Christian and Sabrina Santamaria of USC.
"It was awesome," Gibbs said. "It was a

great opportunity for me and I took advan
tage." Gibbs, who was the top overall seed and
is currently ranked third in the nation, lost in
the semifinals of this tournament last year. This
is the first singles title of her collegiate career.
She had a rocky start, losing the first set of
her tournament 5-7 to UCLA's McCall Jones
after two rain delays.
"I didn't come into my first round with con
fidence, and I was not striking the ball the way
I wanted," Gibbs said. She certainly found that
confidence though, as she went on to beat
Jones 5-7, 6-3, 6-2 before stringing off four
straight victories in the next two days at 6-0,6-
0 in the round of 16,6-2, 6-0 in the quarterfi
nals, 6-0,6-0 in the semifinals and 6-0,6-2 in the
finals.
"Needless to say, I was pretty much feeling

it after the first round," she said.
Three out of Gibbs' five victories came
against Cal players. The only match against a
non-Golden Bear came in the semifinal
against her teammate Stacey Tan. Tan also
made a very nice run in the tournament, which
included an upset of California's number one
player, No. 7 Jana Juricova.
The other side of the bracket saw Califor
nia's Anett Shutting, ranked No. 96 nationally,
come up with two major upsets. Shutting de
feated Stanford's Mallory Burdette, who is
ranked fifth and was the tournament's third
seed, 1-6, 6-3, 6-2 in the semifinals. Shutting
also got past the second seed Robin Anderson,
the only Pac-12 player to defeat Gibbs this sea-

Sophomore Nicole Gibbs (above) dominated the competition in the Pac-12 singles championship, losing just four games in her final four
matches en route to her first career conference title. The second-year player cruised in the championship match, winning 6-0, 6-2.
son, in the quarterfinals. Anderson
was forced to retire after the first
set because of a hamstring injury.
Although Burdette lost in the
semifinals, she remained optimistic
about her play, especially in the
postseason.

"Obviously I would have liked
to have won that semifinal match,
but I feel like overall I'm moving in
the right direction with my game,"
said Burdette. She had been on a
21 -match winning streak, which in
cluded dominant performances in
the teams' recent Pac-12 matches.
Burdette and Gibbs also
played very well in doubles, but fa
tigue may have been a factor in
their finals loss. The two had
played a combined 21 matches in
the past week between Pac-12 reg
ular season and tournament play.
"At least on my side of the
court, I did not feel as mentally
sharp, if not physically, as I normal
ly do playing doubles," Gibbs said.

The two look to make a run in
the NCAA tournament, where
Burdette took home last year's

doubles trophy alongside Hilary
Barte, Stanford's former No. 1
player.
"Honestly, I think we're in an
even better place than Hilary and
I were at this time last year," said
Burdette, who noted that Barte
did not even participate in last
year's Pac-12 tournament.
Four other Stanford players
participated this weekend as well.
The doubles team of Stacey Tan
and Ellen Tsay lost in their first
round match. Tsay also lost in the
second round of the singles draw,
although she had a tough matchup
with Anderson. In the invitational
bracket, Natalie Dillon and
Amelia Herring both dropped
their first-round matches.
The Cardinal feels good about
its chances in the NCAA tourna
ment, especially because of where
the tournament will be played.
Opening rounds will be held at
Stanford in two weeks, while the fi
nals will be played in Athens, Ga.
the week after.
"Athens is like a second home to
us," Burdette said. "I don't even
know how many times we have won
down there in Athens, but it's a lot."
