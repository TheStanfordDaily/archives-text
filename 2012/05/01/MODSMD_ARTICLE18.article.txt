# GOLDEN GIBBS

### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
It was a story of singles success for the Stan
ford women's tennis team, as sophomore
Nicole Gibbs won the Pac-12 singles champi
onship in Ojai, Calif., this weekend, losing a
total of four games in her final four matches.
Two other Stanford players, juniors Mallo
ry Burdette and Stacey Tan, made it to the
semifinals of the singles draw, making this the
second year in a row that Stanford accounted
for three out of the four semifinalists at the
Pac-12 championship. The team of Gibbs and
Burdette also made it to the finals of the dou
bles draw, where they fell 6-4, 6-4 to Kaitlyn
Christian and Sabrina Santamaria of USC.
"It was awesome," Gibbs said. "It was a

great opportunity for me and I took advan
tage." Gibbs, who was the top overall seed and
is currently ranked third in the nation, lost in
the semifinals of this tournament last year. This
is the first singles title of her collegiate career.
She had a rocky start, losing the first set of
her tournament 5-7 to UCLA's McCall Jones
after two rain delays.
"I didn't come into my first round with con
fidence, and I was not striking the ball the way
I wanted," Gibbs said. She certainly found that
confidence though, as she went on to beat
Jones 5-7, 6-3, 6-2 before stringing off four
straight victories in the next two days at 6-0,6-
0 in the round of 16,6-2, 6-0 in the quarterfi
nals, 6-0,6-0 in the semifinals and 6-0,6-2 in the
finals.
"Needless to say, I was pretty much feeling

it after the first round," she said.
Three out of Gibbs' five victories came
against Cal players. The only match against a
non-Golden Bear came in the semifinal
against her teammate Stacey Tan. Tan also
made a very nice run in the tournament, which
included an upset of California's number one
player, No. 7 Jana Juricova.
The other side of the bracket saw Califor
nia's Anett Shutting, ranked No. 96 nationally,
come up with two major upsets. Shutting de
feated Stanford's Mallory Burdette, who is
ranked fifth and was the tournament's third
seed, 1-6, 6-3, 6-2 in the semifinals. Shutting
also got past the second seed Robin Anderson,
the only Pac-12 player to defeat Gibbs this sea-
