# Mosbacher Minute
## Repping the 'Steal Squad' 
### JACK MOSBACHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of
the Stanford baseball team from
2008-2011. Each week, he 'll take a
look at the Cardinal's ups and
downs on its road to the College
World Series.
We cannot fully appreciate
the importance of last weekend's
series victory for No. 9 Stanford
over No. 10 UCLA without first
taking a moment to consider the
depths from which this team has
returned. After a brutal stretch in
which Stanford dropped to sev
enth place in the Pac-12 a
league it was unanimously
picked to win in preseason polls
the Cardinal has crawled its
way back into contention with its
second-straight series victory
over a difficult opponent.
The most surprising aspect of
this well-timed turnaround,
however, has been the cast of
characters most responsible for
it.
Coming into the year, the en
tire college baseball world knew
that Stanford's starting lineup
would be as talented and experi
enced as any in the country. What
no one outside of the program
could have guessed was just how
deep its bench would prove to be
and, if given the chance, just how
well its less known players could
perform.
With recent injuries to several
regular starters, a trio of new
faces has led the offensive resur
gence that has propelled Stan
ford back into contention: sopho
mores Danny Diekroeger and
Brett Michael Doran and fresh
man Alex Blandino, proud mem
bers of a brotherhood known as
the "Steal Squad."
The self-proclaimed Steal
Squad derives its name from the
group's most common game
time activity: watching from the
bench while the Cardinal is playing
defense and waiting to alert Stan
ford's catcher of an attempted steal
by an opposing base runner. For the
better part of this season,
Diekroeger, Doran and Blandino
were buried so deep on Stanford's
bench that a periodic scream was
often the only way for the trio to
make a tangible impact on the
game.
When the Cardinal was on of
fense, Diekroeger and Doran had
the responsibility of keeping writ
ten charts of the game's events for
the coaching staff. Diekroeger's
chart would record every pitch se
quence thrown by the opposing
pitcher, while Doran's chart would
keep a detailed record of Stanford's
offensive performance. Meanwhile,
Blandino was so buried that he did
n't even get a chart; instead, he kept
a watch to time how long it took the
opposing pitcher to throw to home
plate. Blandino wasn't just on the
bench; he was on the bench's bench.
While they attempt to make light of
their predicament, these players
were quite literally in baseball pur
gatory.
I can speak so openly about the
agony of being stuck in a similar po
sition because I know the experi
ence so personally you're read
ing the words of a three-year starter
on the Steal Squad. What has been
so amazing about these three play
ers is how ready they were to seize
an opportunity that, under most cir
cumstances, never comes.
Since the trio entered the lineup
over the past two weeks, this Stan
ford team is simply better. After an
other team-wide slump in which the
offense mustered just eight runs in a
four-game stretch, the Cardinal has
averaged almost nine runs a game
in a dominant sequence of seven
games since these three took over.
In limited playing time, Blandino
has been simply electric at the plate

and is currently tied for the team
lead in home runs, with six. Mean
while, Diekroeger leads the team in
hitting with a .368 clip and Doran
who has filled in brilliantly as the
team's leadoff hitter paces the
team with a .451 on-base percent
age.

Pretty soon, we might need to
start calling the Steal Squad the
"Stud Squad."
Stanford's depth has also been
displayed on the mound by the per
formance of junior Sahil Bloom. In
limited action over three seasons.
Bloom has compiled season ERAs
of 2.72, 0.90 and 0.00, yet he has
struggled to earn more than the oc
casional appearance out of the
bullpen during his time on the
Farm. One of the team's hardest
workers, Bloom has simply bullied
his way into more playing time and
has thrown seven brilliant innings,
giving up only three hits and one
earned run.
Unfortunately, for every Brett
Doran and Danny Diekroeger
there is a Justin Ringo or a Christian
Griffiths: libertalented players
whom the coaching staff simply
cannot trust. For every Sahil Bloom
there is an AJ Talt, a senior who has
had nothing but success in his few
chances on the mound but who
can't seem to buy another opportu
nity to get out there and pitch.
This team's depth is a positive at
tribute for every party involved ex
cept one: the players who actually
make the team so deep. But it is
through the struggle and frustration
experienced by these players that
the true character of the young men
on this team is on full display. Don't
believe me? Just watch the next
time a member of the Steal Squad
succeeds on the field. I guarantee it:
No one will be cheering louder than
his proud Steal Squad brothers.
Deep down, these players also
know that if they're the last team
standing in Omaha at the end of the
season, everyone including the
guys buried deep on the bench
earns a national championship ring.

team's leadoff hitter paces the
team with a .451 on-base percent
age.

Pretty soon, we might need to
start calling the Steal Squad the
"Stud Squad."
Stanford's depth has also been
displayed on the mound by the per
formance of junior Sahil Bloom. In
limited action over three seasons.
Bloom has compiled season ERAs
of 2.72, 0.90 and 0.00, yet he has
struggled to earn more than the oc
casional appearance out of the
bullpen during his time on the
Farm. One of the team's hardest
workers, Bloom has simply bullied
his way into more playing time and
has thrown seven brilliant innings,
giving up only three hits and one
earned run.
Unfortunately, for every Brett
Doran and Danny Diekroeger
there is a Justin Ringo or a Christian
Griffiths: libertalented players
whom the coaching staff simply
cannot trust. For every Sahil Bloom
there is an AJ Talt, a senior who has
had nothing but success in his few
chances on the mound but who
can't seem to buy another opportu
nity to get out there and pitch.
This team's depth is a positive at
tribute for every party involved ex
cept one: the players who actually
make the team so deep. But it is
through the struggle and frustration
experienced by these players that
the true character of the young men
on this team is on full display. Don't
believe me? Just watch the next
time a member of the Steal Squad
succeeds on the field. I guarantee it:
No one will be cheering louder than
his proud Steal Squad brothers.
Deep down, these players also
know that if they're the last team
standing in Omaha at the end of the
season, everyone including the
guys buried deep on the bench
earns a national championship ring.

Jack Mosbacher was a member of
the Stanford baseball team from
2008-2011. Each week, he 'll take a
look at the Cardinal's ups and
downs on its road to the College
World Series.
We cannot fully appreciate
the importance of last weekend's
series victory for No. 9 Stanford
over No. 10 UCLA without first
taking a moment to consider the
depths from which this team has
returned. After a brutal stretch in
which Stanford dropped to sev
enth place in the Pac-12 a
league it was unanimously
picked to win in preseason polls
the Cardinal has crawled its
way back into contention with its
second-straight series victory
over a difficult opponent.
The most surprising aspect of
this well-timed turnaround,
however, has been the cast of
characters most responsible for
it.
Coming into the year, the en
tire college baseball world knew
that Stanford's starting lineup
would be as talented and experi
enced as any in the country. What
no one outside of the program
could have guessed was just how
deep its bench would prove to be
and, if given the chance, just how
well its less known players could
perform.
With recent injuries to several
regular starters, a trio of new
faces has led the offensive resur
gence that has propelled Stan
ford back into contention: sopho
mores Danny Diekroeger and
Brett Michael Doran and fresh
man Alex Blandino, proud mem
bers of a brotherhood known as
the "Steal Squad."
The self-proclaimed Steal
Squad derives its name from the
group's most common game
time activity: watching from the
bench while the Cardinal is playing
defense and waiting to alert Stan
ford's catcher of an attempted steal
by an opposing base runner. For the
better part of this season,
Diekroeger, Doran and Blandino
were buried so deep on Stanford's
bench that a periodic scream was
often the only way for the trio to
make a tangible impact on the
game.
When the Cardinal was on of
fense, Diekroeger and Doran had
the responsibility of keeping writ
ten charts of the game's events for
the coaching staff. Diekroeger's
chart would record every pitch se
quence thrown by the opposing
pitcher, while Doran's chart would
keep a detailed record of Stanford's
offensive performance. Meanwhile,
Blandino was so buried that he did
n't even get a chart; instead, he kept
a watch to time how long it took the
opposing pitcher to throw to home
plate. Blandino wasn't just on the
bench; he was on the bench's bench.
While they attempt to make light of
their predicament, these players
were quite literally in baseball pur
gatory.
I can speak so openly about the
agony of being stuck in a similar po
sition because I know the experi
ence so personally you're read
ing the words of a three-year starter
on the Steal Squad. What has been
so amazing about these three play
ers is how ready they were to seize
an opportunity that, under most cir
cumstances, never comes.
Since the trio entered the lineup
over the past two weeks, this Stan
ford team is simply better. After an
other team-wide slump in which the
offense mustered just eight runs in a
four-game stretch, the Cardinal has
averaged almost nine runs a game
in a dominant sequence of seven
games since these three took over.
In limited playing time, Blandino
has been simply electric at the plate

and is currently tied for the team
lead in home runs, with six. Mean
while, Diekroeger leads the team in
hitting with a .368 clip and Doran
who has filled in brilliantly as the
team's leadoff hitter paces the
team with a .451 on-base percent
age.
