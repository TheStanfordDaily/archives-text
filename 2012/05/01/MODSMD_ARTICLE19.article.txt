# Mosbacher Minute
## Repping the 'Steal Squad' 
### JACK MOSBACHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of
the Stanford baseball team from
2008-2011. Each week, he 'll take a
look at the Cardinal's ups and
downs on its road to the College
World Series.
We cannot fully appreciate
the importance of last weekend's
series victory for No. 9 Stanford
over No. 10 UCLA without first
taking a moment to consider the
depths from which this team has
returned. After a brutal stretch in
which Stanford dropped to sev
enth place in the Pac-12 a
league it was unanimously
picked to win in preseason polls
the Cardinal has crawled its
way back into contention with its
second-straight series victory
over a difficult opponent.
The most surprising aspect of
this well-timed turnaround,
however, has been the cast of
characters most responsible for
it.
Coming into the year, the en
tire college baseball world knew
that Stanford's starting lineup
would be as talented and experi
enced as any in the country. What
no one outside of the program
could have guessed was just how
deep its bench would prove to be
and, if given the chance, just how
well its less known players could
perform.
With recent injuries to several
regular starters, a trio of new
faces has led the offensive resur
gence that has propelled Stan
ford back into contention: sopho
mores Danny Diekroeger and
Brett Michael Doran and fresh
man Alex Blandino, proud mem
bers of a brotherhood known as
the "Steal Squad."
The self-proclaimed Steal
Squad derives its name from the
group's most common game
