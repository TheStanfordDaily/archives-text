## Card falters in semis NO. 1 USC TOO MUCH TO HANDLE 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis
team fell in the semifinals of the
inaugural Pac-12 Champi
onships, defeating Utah in the
quarterfinals before falling to
No. 1 USC in the semis.
No. 10 Stanford went into the
weekend seeded third in the
tournament behind UCLA,
which upset USC in the final
match of the regular season last
week, and the Trojans. Stanford's
defeated the Utes 4-2, before
being shut out by USC 4-0.
Against Utah, the Cardinal
started off strong, riding the mo
mentum accrued in last week's
dismantling of Pacific. In doubles
play, the reshuffled lineup again
proved effective as Stanford
swept all three matches and
claimed the doubles point. The
new tandems of senior Bradley
Klahn with freshman John Mor
rissey and senior Ryan Thacher
with junior Dennis Lin were in
strumental in securing the piv
otal first point.
In singles play, Klahn again set
the tone with a decisive 6-2, 6-2
victory at the No. 1 position and
gave Stanford an intimidating 2-0
lead. After a rare loss by Thacher
on the No. 2 court, freshman
Robert Stineman and sopho
more Daniel Ho clinched the
match on courts five and six, re
spectively, propelling the Cardi
nal into yet another semifinals re
match with their nemesis, USC.
The USC men's tennis team is
a perennial powerhouse, but this
year's squad has been particular
ly difficult for Stanford to han
dle. The Trojans are the three
time defending national champi
ons and were undefeated on the
season before losing to UCLA
last week. Coming into the Pac
12s, the Trojans' record was 25-1.
Stanford and USC had played
twice before this season, and the
Trojans had yet to surrender a
point. The same was true on Fri
day, as the Trojans shut out the
Cardinal in a match that was

closer than the final lopsided
score indicated.
All three doubles matches
and the three completed singles
matches came down to the wire,
with the Trojans managing to win
the key points at the most impor
tant times to secure the victory.
Perhaps the most intriguing
showdown was at No. 1 singles,
where old foes Klahn and USC's
Steve Johnson were doing battle,
Klahn and Johnson are the
two most recent NCAA singles
champions and Klahn was the
last one to defeat No. 2 Johnson,
doing so at the beginning of last
season. In a closely contested,
two-set match, Johnson edged

Klahn 6-4,6-3.
Stanford will now return
home and rest up for the season
ending NCAA tournament,
which begins on May 11. The
draw is yet to be released and the
venues for the first and second
round remain unknown. Stan
ford's own Taube Family Tennis
Center is in the running to host
first and second round matches,
and the Cardinal is likely to start
out the NCAA tournament at
home. The final rounds of the
tournament will be played at the
University of Georgia.
