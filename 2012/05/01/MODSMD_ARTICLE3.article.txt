# Vote on Alternative Review Process nears
## Undergrad Senate votes today on process for sexual assault cases 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate will debate whether to ap
prove the Office of Judicial Affairs
Alternative Review Process
(ARP) for cases of sexual assault,
relationship violence and stalking
at tonight's meeting. The ARP, in
stituted in 2010, is facing its two
year review and requires approval
from the Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) to continue.
The ARP includes two signifi
cant changes: shifting the standard
of proof from "beyond a reason
able doubt" to "preponderance of
evidence," meaning jury members
must be 51 percent certain of guilt
to convict, and shrinking review
panel juries from six members to
four. These changes have raised
concerns that the current system of
convicting based on a majority is
not sufficient, and both student
representatives and alumni have
recommended moving to requir
ing unanimous agreement on re
view panels.
The Office of Judicial Affairs
(OJA) initiated the ARP as a pilot
program in 2010 with the objective
of making the judicial process
more accessible and less intimidat
ing for victims of sexual assault. Its
development was partially in re
sponse to OJA data indicating that
in the 13 years preceding 2010,
there were 104 reports of sexual
assault at Stanford, yet only 16 of
those cases were reported to the
Judicial Office and only three went
to hearing. In comparison, statis

tics from a two-year study from the
National Institute of Justice, cited
in the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter
from the Office for Civil Rights,
predicted that over 650 female and
200 male students at Stanford have
been sexually assaulted, a number
far higher than report and trial
rates.
"There was concern that the Ju
dicial Process was a deterrent to
victims of sexual assault, sexual ha
rassment, dating violence and
stalking," Jamie Pontius-Hogan,
assistant dean of the Office of Judi
cial Affairs, said in an email to The
Daily.
"It surprises me that Stanford
students would want to consent to
a change in the rules that gives
them less rights in a University dis
ciplinary hearing," said David Bar
ton, who has been a criminal law
attorney for 23 years and has de
fended Stanford students in judi
cial proceedings. "People ... have
confidence that the University will
use that power wisely and that
they'll never be on the wrong side
of it. And that's a delusion."
Since the establishment of the
ARP, there have been 21 cases of
sexual assault reported on campus,
13 transferred to ARP and 12
tried. Of the 12 hearings in the past
two years, 10 plaintiffs were found
responsible, though one verdict
was reversed in appeal. Pontius-
Hogan said that the OJA has not
found a higher proportion of stu
dents responsible since the burden
of proof was lowered to a prepon
derance of evidence standard; she
attributed the increase to the suc
cess of the ARP. The burden of

proof was lowered midway
through the ARP trial period.
"Of course they are going to get
more cases if they don't have to
have the same level of certainty,"
Barton said, "but people do get
falsely accused. If there is a pre
ponderance of evidence test, peo
ple will be falsely convicted, falsely
suspended, falsely expelled. That's
the cost of a system that appears
more efficient."
The Dear Colleague Letter
OnApril 12,2011, six days after
he received a letter from the Office
of Civil Rights, President Hen
nessy employed his authority to
override the existing Judicial Af
fairs charter and ASSU Constitu
tion both of which protect the
rights of the accused to face their
accusers, be free from double jeop
ardy and remain innocent until
proven guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt to revise the ARP and
accord it with the federal guide
lines.
According to the Office of Judi
cial Affairs, Stanford was one of
only two or three universities to
still use a burden of "beyond a rea
sonable doubt" in cases involving
sexual assault. Even so, concerns
remain over the ARP guidelines.
"Many of the Stanford sexual
assault cases are cases that are very
ambiguous and involve confusion
and alcohol, and are cases that are
very hard to prove beyond a rea
sonable doubt standard," Barton
said. "Most of the cases that are
charged with sexual assault on
campus end up being rejected by
the police and the district attorney,
but they are properly rejected ...
because you shouldn't be imposing
either a criminal sanction or an ex
clusion from the University unless
there is a reliable way of determin
ing what occurred."
ASSU Senator Dan Ashton 'l4
also voiced opposition at the Sen
ate's April 24 meeting to the ARP's
protections for the accused. He
noted that only six of the twelve
rights of the accused currently
guaranteed in the ASSU Constitu
tion are protected by the ARP.
"I feel that you have a right to
call witnesses and have your wit
nesses heard," Ashton said. "I don't
understand why they would say
you are not obligated to meet with
witnesses they want to call. That
doesn't make sense for our legal
system."

Proposed changes to the ARP
Recent Senate meetings have
been dominated by extensive de
bate about the Alternative Review
Process (ARP) and its approval.
Since the ARP has only been oper
ating as a pilot program, it must be
approved by both the Senate and
GSC in order to continue.
The first proposed change
voiced by undergraduate senators
concerns increasing the number of
reviewers on a panel from four
back to six. While all other OJA
proceedings have six sitting review
ers, the ARP has only four.
"If you're going to decrease the
panelist number from six to four, I
think... because of that reduction,
there should be an increased level
of requirements," Senator Ben
Laufer 'l2 said in support of a larg
er panel. "I don't know if having
two more people would really dis
suade people from taking action. I
think there is, at least in my mind, a
big difference between having 3-1
and 4-0."
" [We chose four] out of concern
for the comfort of both parties, and
extreme concern for [their] privacy
and confidentiality," Pontius-
Hogan said. "Also, most people on
the board felt strongly that it should
be student centered and having
four we were able to have three stu
dents and one faculty or staff mem
ber, which felt like a good balance."
Disagreement exists within the
Board on Judicial Affairs as to the

proper size of the review panels.
"Because we're all presumed to
be innocent, I don't think you
should force any responding stu
dent to have to overcome that bur
den on a 3-1 vote, to force him on
the first round to convince two out
of four people, I don't think that's
fair," said Timothy Lau J.D. 'l2,
member of the Board on Judicial
Affairs.
The second proposed change,
which the OJA decided not to en
dorse after extensive discussion, is
requiring a unanimous rather than
majority vote to find a student re
sponsible. According to the OJA,
no other disciplinary process at
Stanford requires a more-than-ma
jority vote, but, as The Daily previ
ously reported, more than twice as
many states require unanimous
agreement for civil cases than re
quire three-quarters agreement.
Law Professor Michele Dauber
said that she thought the language
of those supporting unanimity
seemed to run contrary to the in
tent of the Office of Civil Rights.
"It's been said with a high de
gree of explicitness ... that it looks
like Stanford is trying ... to evade
what the Department of Justice is
trying to accomplish," she said at an
April 18 gathering of student legis
lators.
Dauber and members of the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs, who said that
the ARP is "data driven," also op
pose the change because they be
lieve that, coupled with the recent
changes to accord with the Dear

Colleague Letter, the effects of pol
icy change cannot be distinguished
if the variables are not changed in
crementally.
"It's not like a typical civil suit
where you are just paying damages,
or just like refrained from seeing
someone," Lau said. "When you get
suspended for two/three years
from Stanford... and you are la
beled ... a perpetrator of sexual as
sault by Stanford, it is something
that goes with you for life. The pun
ishment itself, while not entirely
civil, has a criminal dimension to it.
I think Stanford ought to be very
careful before putting something
like this on someone, that we do this
process fairly."
GSC representative Sjoerd de
Ridder emailed the GSC list early
Tuesday morning urging UGS and
GSC members to take more time to
weigh the ARP before approving it.
"Agreeing with the ARP as is
basically states it is perfect," de Rid
der wrote.
"Amending it, on the fly, when
approving it, is nonconstructive, be
cause many bodies need to agree
on the ARP. Providing a set of opin
ions is the responsible thing to do,
as it would give the BJA resources
and incentives to carefully review
the document... There is time to
raise issues, because the Faculty
Senate will not take this up till fall,
and the pilot study has been ex
tended till then."

those cases were reported to the
Judicial Office and only three went

National Institute of Justice, cited
in the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter
from the Office for Civil Rights,
predicted that over 650 female and

two years, 10 plaintiffs were found
responsible, though one verdict
was reversed in appeal. Pontius-
Hogan said that the OJA has not
found a higher proportion of stu
dents responsible since the burden
of proof was lowered to a prepon
derance of evidence standard; she
attributed the increase to the suc
cess of the ARP. The burden of

proof was lowered midway
through the ARP trial period.
"Of course they are going to get
more cases if they don't have to
have the same level of certainty,"
Barton said, "but people do get
falsely accused. If there is a pre
ponderance of evidence test, peo
ple will be falsely convicted, falsely
suspended, falsely expelled. That's
the cost of a system that appears
more efficient."
The Dear Colleague Letter
OnApril 12,2011, six days after
he received a letter from the Office
of Civil Rights, President Hen
nessy employed his authority to
override the existing Judicial Af
fairs charter and ASSU Constitu
tion both of which protect the
rights of the accused to face their
accusers, be free from double jeop
ardy and remain innocent until
proven guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt to revise the ARP and
accord it with the federal guide
lines.
According to the Office of Judi
cial Affairs, Stanford was one of
only two or three universities to
still use a burden of "beyond a rea
sonable doubt" in cases involving
sexual assault. Even so, concerns
remain over the ARP guidelines.
"Many of the Stanford sexual
assault cases are cases that are very
ambiguous and involve confusion
and alcohol, and are cases that are
very hard to prove beyond a rea
sonable doubt standard," Barton
said. "Most of the cases that are
charged with sexual assault on
campus end up being rejected by
the police and the district attorney,
but they are properly rejected ...
because you shouldn't be imposing
either a criminal sanction or an ex
clusion from the University unless
there is a reliable way of determin
ing what occurred."
ASSU Senator Dan Ashton 'l4
also voiced opposition at the Sen
ate's April 24 meeting to the ARP's
protections for the accused. He
noted that only six of the twelve
rights of the accused currently
guaranteed in the ASSU Constitu
tion are protected by the ARP.
"I feel that you have a right to
call witnesses and have your wit
nesses heard," Ashton said. "I don't
understand why they would say
you are not obligated to meet with
witnesses they want to call. That
doesn't make sense for our legal
system."

Proposed changes to the ARP
Recent Senate meetings have
been dominated by extensive de
bate about the Alternative Review
Process (ARP) and its approval.
Since the ARP has only been oper
ating as a pilot program, it must be
approved by both the Senate and
GSC in order to continue.
The first proposed change
voiced by undergraduate senators
concerns increasing the number of
reviewers on a panel from four
back to six. While all other OJA
proceedings have six sitting review
ers, the ARP has only four.
"If you're going to decrease the
panelist number from six to four, I
think... because of that reduction,
there should be an increased level
of requirements," Senator Ben
Laufer 'l2 said in support of a larg
er panel. "I don't know if having
two more people would really dis
suade people from taking action. I
think there is, at least in my mind, a
big difference between having 3-1
and 4-0."
" [We chose four] out of concern
for the comfort of both parties, and
extreme concern for [their] privacy
and confidentiality," Pontius-
Hogan said. "Also, most people on
the board felt strongly that it should
be student centered and having
four we were able to have three stu
dents and one faculty or staff mem
ber, which felt like a good balance."
Disagreement exists within the
Board on Judicial Affairs as to the

proper size of the review panels.
"Because we're all presumed to
be innocent, I don't think you
should force any responding stu
dent to have to overcome that bur
den on a 3-1 vote, to force him on
the first round to convince two out
of four people, I don't think that's
fair," said Timothy Lau J.D. 'l2,
member of the Board on Judicial
Affairs.
The second proposed change,
which the OJA decided not to en
dorse after extensive discussion, is
requiring a unanimous rather than
majority vote to find a student re
sponsible. According to the OJA,
no other disciplinary process at
Stanford requires a more-than-ma
jority vote, but, as The Daily previ
ously reported, more than twice as
many states require unanimous
agreement for civil cases than re
quire three-quarters agreement.
Law Professor Michele Dauber
said that she thought the language
of those supporting unanimity
seemed to run contrary to the in
tent of the Office of Civil Rights.
"It's been said with a high de
gree of explicitness ... that it looks
like Stanford is trying ... to evade
what the Department of Justice is
trying to accomplish," she said at an
April 18 gathering of student legis
lators.
Dauber and members of the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs, who said that
the ARP is "data driven," also op
pose the change because they be
lieve that, coupled with the recent
changes to accord with the Dear

Colleague Letter, the effects of pol
icy change cannot be distinguished
if the variables are not changed in
crementally.
"It's not like a typical civil suit
where you are just paying damages,
or just like refrained from seeing
someone," Lau said. "When you get
suspended for two/three years
from Stanford... and you are la
beled ... a perpetrator of sexual as
sault by Stanford, it is something
that goes with you for life. The pun
ishment itself, while not entirely
civil, has a criminal dimension to it.
I think Stanford ought to be very
careful before putting something
like this on someone, that we do this
process fairly."
GSC representative Sjoerd de
Ridder emailed the GSC list early
Tuesday morning urging UGS and
GSC members to take more time to
weigh the ARP before approving it.
"Agreeing with the ARP as is
basically states it is perfect," de Rid
der wrote.
"Amending it, on the fly, when
approving it, is nonconstructive, be
cause many bodies need to agree
on the ARP. Providing a set of opin
ions is the responsible thing to do,
as it would give the BJA resources
and incentives to carefully review
the document... There is time to
raise issues, because the Faculty
Senate will not take this up till fall,
and the pilot study has been ex
tended till then."

The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate will debate whether to ap
prove the Office of Judicial Affairs
Alternative Review Process
(ARP) for cases of sexual assault,
relationship violence and stalking
at tonight's meeting. The ARP, in
stituted in 2010, is facing its two
year review and requires approval
from the Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) to continue.
The ARP includes two signifi
cant changes: shifting the standard
of proof from "beyond a reason
able doubt" to "preponderance of
evidence," meaning jury members
must be 51 percent certain of guilt
to convict, and shrinking review
panel juries from six members to
four. These changes have raised
concerns that the current system of
convicting based on a majority is
not sufficient, and both student
representatives and alumni have
recommended moving to requir
ing unanimous agreement on re
view panels.
The Office of Judicial Affairs
(OJA) initiated the ARP as a pilot
program in 2010 with the objective
of making the judicial process
more accessible and less intimidat
ing for victims of sexual assault. Its
development was partially in re
sponse to OJA data indicating that
in the 13 years preceding 2010,
there were 104 reports of sexual
assault at Stanford, yet only 16 of
those cases were reported to the
Judicial Office and only three went
to hearing. In comparison, statis

tics from a two-year study from the
National Institute of Justice, cited
in the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter
from the Office for Civil Rights,
predicted that over 650 female and
200 male students at Stanford have
been sexually assaulted, a number
far higher than report and trial
rates.
"There was concern that the Ju
dicial Process was a deterrent to
victims of sexual assault, sexual ha
rassment, dating violence and
stalking," Jamie Pontius-Hogan,
assistant dean of the Office of Judi
cial Affairs, said in an email to The
Daily.
"It surprises me that Stanford
students would want to consent to
a change in the rules that gives
them less rights in a University dis
ciplinary hearing," said David Bar
ton, who has been a criminal law
attorney for 23 years and has de
fended Stanford students in judi
cial proceedings. "People ... have
confidence that the University will
use that power wisely and that
they'll never be on the wrong side
of it. And that's a delusion."
Since the establishment of the
ARP, there have been 21 cases of
sexual assault reported on campus,
13 transferred to ARP and 12
tried. Of the 12 hearings in the past
two years, 10 plaintiffs were found
responsible, though one verdict
was reversed in appeal. Pontius-
Hogan said that the OJA has not
found a higher proportion of stu
dents responsible since the burden
of proof was lowered to a prepon
derance of evidence standard; she
attributed the increase to the suc

ers, the ARP has only four.
"If you're going to decrease the
panelist number from six to four, I
think... because of that reduction,
there should be an increased level
of requirements," Senator Ben
Laufer 'l2 said in support of a larg
er panel. "I don't know if having
two more people would really dis
suade people from taking action. I
think there is, at least in my mind, a
big difference between having 3-1
and 4-0."
" [We chose four] out of concern
for the comfort of both parties, and
extreme concern for [their] privacy
and confidentiality," Pontius-
Hogan said. "Also, most people on
the board felt strongly that it should
be student centered and having
four we were able to have three stu
dents and one faculty or staff mem
ber, which felt like a good balance."
Disagreement exists within the
Board on Judicial Affairs as to the

proper size of the review panels.
"Because we're all presumed to
be innocent, I don't think you
should force any responding stu
dent to have to overcome that bur
den on a 3-1 vote, to force him on
the first round to convince two out
of four people, I don't think that's
fair," said Timothy Lau J.D. 'l2,
member of the Board on Judicial
Affairs.
The second proposed change,
which the OJA decided not to en
dorse after extensive discussion, is
requiring a unanimous rather than
majority vote to find a student re
sponsible. According to the OJA,
no other disciplinary process at
Stanford requires a more-than-ma
jority vote, but, as The Daily previ
ously reported, more than twice as
many states require unanimous
agreement for civil cases than re
quire three-quarters agreement.
Law Professor Michele Dauber
said that she thought the language
of those supporting unanimity
seemed to run contrary to the in
tent of the Office of Civil Rights.
"It's been said with a high de
gree of explicitness ... that it looks
like Stanford is trying ... to evade
what the Department of Justice is
trying to accomplish," she said at an
April 18 gathering of student legis
lators.
Dauber and members of the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs, who said that
the ARP is "data driven," also op
pose the change because they be
lieve that, coupled with the recent
changes to accord with the Dear

Colleague Letter, the effects of pol
icy change cannot be distinguished
if the variables are not changed in
crementally.
"It's not like a typical civil suit
where you are just paying damages,
or just like refrained from seeing
someone," Lau said. "When you get
suspended for two/three years
from Stanford... and you are la
beled ... a perpetrator of sexual as
sault by Stanford, it is something
that goes with you for life. The pun
ishment itself, while not entirely
civil, has a criminal dimension to it.
I think Stanford ought to be very
careful before putting something
like this on someone, that we do this
process fairly."
GSC representative Sjoerd de
Ridder emailed the GSC list early
Tuesday morning urging UGS and
GSC members to take more time to
weigh the ARP before approving it.
"Agreeing with the ARP as is
basically states it is perfect," de Rid
der wrote.
"Amending it, on the fly, when
approving it, is nonconstructive, be
cause many bodies need to agree
on the ARP. Providing a set of opin
ions is the responsible thing to do,
as it would give the BJA resources
and incentives to carefully review
the document... There is time to
raise issues, because the Faculty
Senate will not take this up till fall,
and the pilot study has been ex
tended till then."

The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate will debate whether to ap
prove the Office of Judicial Affairs
Alternative Review Process
(ARP) for cases of sexual assault,
relationship violence and stalking
at tonight's meeting. The ARP, in
stituted in 2010, is facing its two
year review and requires approval
from the Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) to continue.
The ARP includes two signifi
cant changes: shifting the standard
of proof from "beyond a reason
able doubt" to "preponderance of
evidence," meaning jury members
must be 51 percent certain of guilt
to convict, and shrinking review
panel juries from six members to
four. These changes have raised
concerns that the current system of
convicting based on a majority is
not sufficient, and both student
representatives and alumni have
recommended moving to requir
ing unanimous agreement on re
view panels.
The Office of Judicial Affairs
(OJA) initiated the ARP as a pilot
program in 2010 with the objective
of making the judicial process
more accessible and less intimidat
ing for victims of sexual assault. Its
development was partially in re
sponse to OJA data indicating that
in the 13 years preceding 2010,
there were 104 reports of sexual
assault at Stanford, yet only 16 of
those cases were reported to the
Judicial Office and only three went
to hearing. In comparison, statis

tics from a two-year study from the
National Institute of Justice, cited
in the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter
from the Office for Civil Rights,
predicted that over 650 female and
200 male students at Stanford have
been sexually assaulted, a number
far higher than report and trial
rates.
"There was concern that the Ju
dicial Process was a deterrent to
victims of sexual assault, sexual ha
rassment, dating violence and
stalking," Jamie Pontius-Hogan,
assistant dean of the Office of Judi
cial Affairs, said in an email to The
Daily.
"It surprises me that Stanford
students would want to consent to
a change in the rules that gives
them less rights in a University dis
ciplinary hearing," said David Bar
ton, who has been a criminal law
attorney for 23 years and has de
fended Stanford students in judi
cial proceedings. "People ... have
confidence that the University will
use that power wisely and that
they'll never be on the wrong side
of it. And that's a delusion."
Since the establishment of the
ARP, there have been 21 cases of
sexual assault reported on campus,
13 transferred to ARP and 12
tried. Of the 12 hearings in the past
two years, 10 plaintiffs were found
responsible, though one verdict
was reversed in appeal. Pontius-
Hogan said that the OJA has not
found a higher proportion of stu
dents responsible since the burden
of proof was lowered to a prepon
derance of evidence standard; she
attributed the increase to the suc
cess of the ARP. The burden of

proof was lowered midway
through the ARP trial period.
"Of course they are going to get
more cases if they don't have to
have the same level of certainty,"
Barton said, "but people do get
falsely accused. If there is a pre
ponderance of evidence test, peo
ple will be falsely convicted, falsely
suspended, falsely expelled. That's
the cost of a system that appears
more efficient."
The Dear Colleague Letter
OnApril 12,2011, six days after
he received a letter from the Office
of Civil Rights, President Hen
nessy employed his authority to
override the existing Judicial Af
fairs charter and ASSU Constitu
tion both of which protect the
rights of the accused to face their
accusers, be free from double jeop
ardy and remain innocent until
proven guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt to revise the ARP and
accord it with the federal guide
lines.
According to the Office of Judi
cial Affairs, Stanford was one of
only two or three universities to
still use a burden of "beyond a rea
sonable doubt" in cases involving
sexual assault. Even so, concerns
remain over the ARP guidelines.
"Many of the Stanford sexual
assault cases are cases that are very
ambiguous and involve confusion
and alcohol, and are cases that are
very hard to prove beyond a rea
sonable doubt standard," Barton
said. "Most of the cases that are
charged with sexual assault on
campus end up being rejected by
the police and the district attorney,
but they are properly rejected ...
because you shouldn't be imposing
either a criminal sanction or an ex
clusion from the University unless
there is a reliable way of determin
ing what occurred."
ASSU Senator Dan Ashton 'l4
also voiced opposition at the Sen
ate's April 24 meeting to the ARP's
protections for the accused. He
noted that only six of the twelve
rights of the accused currently
guaranteed in the ASSU Constitu
tion are protected by the ARP.
"I feel that you have a right to
call witnesses and have your wit
nesses heard," Ashton said. "I don't
understand why they would say
you are not obligated to meet with
witnesses they want to call. That
doesn't make sense for our legal
system."

Proposed changes to the ARP
Recent Senate meetings have
been dominated by extensive de
bate about the Alternative Review
Process (ARP) and its approval.
Since the ARP has only been oper
ating as a pilot program, it must be
approved by both the Senate and
GSC in order to continue.
The first proposed change
voiced by undergraduate senators
concerns increasing the number of
reviewers on a panel from four
back to six. While all other OJA
proceedings have six sitting review
ers, the ARP has only four.
"If you're going to decrease the
panelist number from six to four, I
think... because of that reduction,
there should be an increased level
of requirements," Senator Ben
Laufer 'l2 said in support of a larg
er panel. "I don't know if having
two more people would really dis
suade people from taking action. I
think there is, at least in my mind, a
big difference between having 3-1
and 4-0."
" [We chose four] out of concern
for the comfort of both parties, and
extreme concern for [their] privacy
and confidentiality," Pontius-
Hogan said. "Also, most people on
the board felt strongly that it should

dents and one faculty or staff mem
ber, which felt like a good balance."

proper size of the review panels.
