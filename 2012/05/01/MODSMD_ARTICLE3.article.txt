# Vote on Alternative Review Process nears
## Undergrad Senate votes today on process for sexual assault cases 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate will debate whether to ap
prove the Office of Judicial Affairs
Alternative Review Process
(ARP) for cases of sexual assault,
relationship violence and stalking
at tonight's meeting. The ARP, in
stituted in 2010, is facing its two
year review and requires approval
from the Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) to continue.
The ARP includes two signifi
cant changes: shifting the standard
of proof from "beyond a reason
able doubt" to "preponderance of
evidence," meaning jury members
must be 51 percent certain of guilt
to convict, and shrinking review
panel juries from six members to
four. These changes have raised
concerns that the current system of
convicting based on a majority is
not sufficient, and both student
representatives and alumni have
recommended moving to requir
ing unanimous agreement on re
view panels.
The Office of Judicial Affairs
(OJA) initiated the ARP as a pilot
program in 2010 with the objective
of making the judicial process
more accessible and less intimidat
ing for victims of sexual assault. Its
development was partially in re
sponse to OJA data indicating that
in the 13 years preceding 2010,
there were 104 reports of sexual
assault at Stanford, yet only 16 of
those cases were reported to the
Judicial Office and only three went
to hearing. In comparison, statis

tics from a two-year study from the
National Institute of Justice, cited
in the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter
from the Office for Civil Rights,
predicted that over 650 female and
200 male students at Stanford have
been sexually assaulted, a number
far higher than report and trial
rates.
"There was concern that the Ju
dicial Process was a deterrent to
victims of sexual assault, sexual ha
rassment, dating violence and
stalking," Jamie Pontius-Hogan,
assistant dean of the Office of Judi
cial Affairs, said in an email to The
Daily.
"It surprises me that Stanford
students would want to consent to
a change in the rules that gives
them less rights in a University dis
ciplinary hearing," said David Bar
ton, who has been a criminal law
attorney for 23 years and has de
fended Stanford students in judi
cial proceedings. "People ... have
confidence that the University will
use that power wisely and that
they'll never be on the wrong side
of it. And that's a delusion."
Since the establishment of the
ARP, there have been 21 cases of
sexual assault reported on campus,
13 transferred to ARP and 12
tried. Of the 12 hearings in the past
two years, 10 plaintiffs were found
responsible, though one verdict
was reversed in appeal. Pontius-
Hogan said that the OJA has not
found a higher proportion of stu
dents responsible since the burden
of proof was lowered to a prepon
derance of evidence standard; she
attributed the increase to the suc
cess of the ARP. The burden of

proof was lowered midway
through the ARP trial period.
"Of course they are going to get
more cases if they don't have to
have the same level of certainty,"
Barton said, "but people do get
falsely accused. If there is a pre
ponderance of evidence test, peo
ple will be falsely convicted, falsely
suspended, falsely expelled. That's
the cost of a system that appears
more efficient."
The Dear Colleague Letter
OnApril 12,2011, six days after
he received a letter from the Office
of Civil Rights, President Hen
nessy employed his authority to
override the existing Judicial Af
fairs charter and ASSU Constitu
tion both of which protect the
rights of the accused to face their
accusers, be free from double jeop
ardy and remain innocent until
proven guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt to revise the ARP and
accord it with the federal guide
lines.
According to the Office of Judi
cial Affairs, Stanford was one of
only two or three universities to
still use a burden of "beyond a rea
sonable doubt" in cases involving
sexual assault. Even so, concerns
remain over the ARP guidelines.
"Many of the Stanford sexual
assault cases are cases that are very
ambiguous and involve confusion
and alcohol, and are cases that are
very hard to prove beyond a rea
sonable doubt standard," Barton
said. "Most of the cases that are
charged with sexual assault on
