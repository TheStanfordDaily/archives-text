### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Matt Bettonville 
Blue Shield of California final
ized a three-year contract with
Stanford Hospital and Clinics this
past week for health maintenance
organization (HMO) and pre
ferred provider organization
(PPO) rates. Negotiations conclud
ed Thursday to meet a deadline just
after midnight on Friday morning,
according to the San Jose Mercury
News.
Had the two sides not reached a
deal in time, Blue Shield members
would have seen their insurance
coverage affected at Stanford Hos
pital and Clinics (SHC).
In a statement, Randy Liv
ingston, Stanford vice president for
business affairs and chief financial
officer, said, "We're very pleased
that [Stanford] and Blue Shield
were able to complete a new agree
ment in the nick of time, averting
potential confusion and disruption
for Stanford employees and post
docs with Blue Shield coverage
who receive services from Stanford
Hospitals and Clinics."
Terms of the deal were not re
leased. Patients from other insur
ance providers are unaffected by
the negotiations.
