## Terman park opening approaches 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
After six months of demolition, the site of the
Frederick Emmons Terman Engineering Center
is starting to look like the park it is set to become.
According to University officials, the park will
open later this month.
The new open space will preserve the large
fountain that previously faced the center of the
Terman building. The fountain sits in a bowl
shaped recession that is almost fully landscaped

with sod and new trees for its opening.
The University has not announced any specif
ic plans, but the park area is considered only tem
porary. According to the Stanford Report, one
reason for leaving the recessed fountain was to
stop the need for future excavation for the foun
dation of a building.
Almost none of the demolished Terman build
ing is headed to the landfill. According to project
manager Matthew Griffis, 99.6 percent of the ma-

terial is headed for recycling and
reuse.
"Conscientious building dem
olition underscores Stanford's
commitment to sustainability and
demonstrates responsible man
agement through the end of a
building's life," reads Sustainable
Stanford's website for the project.
Some pieces of the former
building are being repurposed
around campus. According to a
report published by Sustainable
Stanford, roof tiles from Terman
are being re-installed in the rising
West Campus Recreation Center.
Additionally, seats fromTerman's
auditorium will be re-installed in
an auditorium in the final build
ing of the new engineering quad,
and pavement tiles will be used to
renovate the nearby Petersen-
Mitchell courtyard. Other items,
such as exterior light fixtures and
bike racks, will be returned to the
site and redistributed around
campus.

One piece of the Terman park,
the small lot across Lomita Mall
from the pond area, is temporari

ly being left unlandscaped. The
lot, which formerly housed stu
dent publications including The
Daily, will eventually be made
into a turf recreation area, but for
now is being reserved for the
Solar Decathlon project, a sus
tainable housing competition
among 20 universities.
"Since new turf and trees
could potentially be damaged if
installed prior to this use, we are
in the process of determining
final needs of the Solar De
cathlon and will be phasing the
completion of the ... site land
scaping accordingly," Griffis said
in an email to The Daily.
Mulch from the Stanford Hos
pital renovation project will be
brought to the site so that the
Solar Decathlon team can con
struct their project for the 2013
competition. Landscaping might
resume on the area when the
team moves its project to Irvine,
Calif, in October 2013.
The exact date of the opening
of the park has not been an
nounced, but despite signs at the
site indicating "Summer 2012,"
Griffis said it is on track to open
later this month.
