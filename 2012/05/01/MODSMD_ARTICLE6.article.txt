"Even if the direction is right
you cannot reach the destination
overnight," said Fu Jun, professor
of political economy and execu
tive dean of the school of govern
ment at Beijing University, in a
talk Monday on economic growth
in China.

universality of this formula, Fu
pointed out that China has a

citing examples including special

the countryside that might not
necessarily be successful if insti

Drawing from economic his
