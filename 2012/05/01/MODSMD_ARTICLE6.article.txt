## Beijing prof, addresses China's global economy 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
"Even if the direction is right
you cannot reach the destination
overnight," said Fu Jun, professor
of political economy and execu
tive dean of the school of govern
ment at Beijing University, in a
talk Monday on economic growth
in China.
Fu is currently president of the
Harvard Alumni Association in
Beijing, as well as a frequent com
mentator on CCTV News and
speaker at the World Economic
Forum.
Fu presented his talk, titled

"China in the World Economy:
Past, Present and Future," at the
He wlett Teaching Center to an au
dience of approximately 100 peo
ple.
The talk was sponsored by the
Center for Sustainable Develop
ment and Global Competitive
ness (CSDGC).
Underlying the hour and a half
talk was a strong emphasis on
what Fu called "institutional tech
nology." He stressed that this term
focuses on human capital, in par
ticular the power of corporations
and educational institutions.
On the topic of education, Fu
said he is optimistic about the in

crease in Chinese students study
ing abroad. He cautioned, howev
er, that the country needs "to fig
ure out and have confidence in
more investment in institutional
technology."
"China's growth has been a
phenomenon, but I would pro
pose that the past three decades
we have learned about what I call
hardware technology, and the
next stage for us is to learn about
institutional technologies," Fu
said.
"Growth is a function of popu
lation and technology. This is a
simple formula applicable global
ly," Fu added.

Despite his comments on the
universality of this formula, Fu
pointed out that China has a
"unique Chinese way" of growing,
citing examples including special
economic zones and reforms in
the countryside that might not
necessarily be successful if insti
tuted elsewhere in the world.
Drawing from economic his
tory and theory throughout his
talk, Fu said, "If you look at
China 200 years ago, it had one
third of the total world popula
tion and was producing one-third
of the total world GDP. We were
normalizing."
Although the Chinese econo
my has grown at a rapid pace in the
last 30 years since former premier
Deng Xiaoping introduced mar
ket reforms in 1979, Fu said, "We
have one-fifth of the world popu
lation but we are producing rough
ly 10 percent of world GDP."
"We are looking for another 10
percent to normalize," he added.
Fu said that in the future,
China needs to undertake
changes including more anti
trust laws and the production of
better quality products.
Nonetheless, he remained posi
tive about China's economic fu
ture.
"We have to give credit to the
[Chinese] government and the
Chinese people for what they have
accomplished," Fu said. "But hav
ing said that, we should not get self
conceited."
After the talk, Fu fielded more
than a dozen questions on subjects
ranging from China's GDP per
capita to the balance between hi

erarchy and the market within the
country.
"For the economy to move for
ward, you need to have a balance
on the supply side and demand
side," Fu said in reply to a question
on domestic consumption. "And
right now I am concerned about

the growth potential on the de
mand side. With the slowdown of
the world economy, international
markets are not demanding as
much."
