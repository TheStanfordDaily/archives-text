## Students raise hep B awareness Disease affects one in 10 Asians and Pacific Islanders 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Jade balloons tied to bikes all
over campus Monday morning
were the first of many indicators of
Hepatitis B Awareness Week. Fea
turing speakers and events all over
campus, the awareness week was or
ganized by Team HB V, an outreach
arm of the Jade Ribbon Campaign
led by the Asian Liver Center at the
Stanford School of Medicine.
Hepatitis B affects one in 10
Asians and Pacific Islanders, and
one in four of those affected eventu
ally die of liver cancer, according to
Team HBV.The virus is also respon
sible for 80 percent of all liver cancer
cases. Team HBV is the primary stu
dent outreach group for hepatitis B
and spans numerous colleges and
high schools throughout the nation.
Currently all Team HBV colle
giate chapters are gathering support
for an online petition urging Presi
dent Obama to sustain the Center
for Disease Control and Preven
tion's funding for viral hepatitis
treatment and to include viral hepa
titis in the Global Health Initiative.
Since 2010, Team HBV has de
voted a week each year in May to in
crease campus awareness of hepati
tis B and liver cancer. Hepatitis B
Awareness Week is a collection of
educational outreach events that
feature distinguished speakers, free
food and jade-colored memorabil
ia.
"On Monday, our kickoff event
involved placing jade balloons and
important hep B facts on bikes
throughout campus," said Christo
pher Paiji 'l3, president of Team
HBV. The next event, which will
take place Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the
Asian American Activities Center
(A3C) ballroom, will be "The Jade
Perspective on Health Advocacy,"
featuring Arcadi Kolchak, policy
aide to Santa Clara County supervi
sor Liz Kniss.
"Overall it was a great way to let
Team HBV's mission be heard,"
said Christina Wang 'l5, director of
campus relations for Team HBV. "I
hope everyone on campus at least
saw one jade balloon today, a sym
bol of Team HBV's cause to let
more people know about the silent
killer that is hepatitis B.
"The worst thing about the
virus is that its asymptomatic, so
there is very little economic or po
litical attention spent on this
virus," Wang said. "It's our hope to
change that, and a lot of that starts
with being aware that the virus is
pretty deadly."
Vaden Health Center offers free

hepatitis B screenings to all stu
dents with a standard appointment.
Stanford Team HBV has several
methods to direct students to this
free screening.
"When I attended a dinner in
March that celebrated the kickoff
of the Santa Clara Hep B Free
campaign, I learned that an esti
mated 50,000 people in the county
have hep B, with two-thirds un
aware of their infected status," Paiji
said. "Imagine the number of jeop
ardized that would have easily
been pre vented if these individuals
had known to screen for Hep B
earlier. Stanford Team HBV hopes
to turn this trend around by edu
cating the surrounding at-risk
communities."
Later in the week, Team HBV
plans to host health education
events in White Plaza and in the
major dining halls, along with hand
ing out jade cookies and sunglasses.
