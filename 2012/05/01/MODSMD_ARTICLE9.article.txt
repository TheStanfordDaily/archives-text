## Parkinson, GPS pioneer, shares journey of tech 
### ARIELLA AXLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 1973 creation of Global Positioning System
(GPS) technology, which uses satellites to determine
precise locations on Earth, changed industries ranging
from aviation to robotics. Professor emeritus Bradford
Parkinson, the engineer and inventor known as the ar
chitect of GPS, delivered a "Stanford Engineering
Hero" lecture Monday about his work.
"GPS has many applications for worldwide bene
fit," Parkinson said. "Some we anticipated, some are
surprising."
As a colonel in the U.S. Air Force, Parkinson made
strides in his aeronautics and astronautics engineering
studies as a doctoral student at Stanford. In 1973, he
became manager of the NAVSTAR GPS develop
ment program, where he remained until 1978, when he
retired from the Air Force, He then served as a profes
sor at Stanford until 1999.
Parkinson described the origins and applications of
GPS Monday and explored the trajectory of its future.
He dedicated his lecture to the aerospace engineers
who work to advance technology in the field today.
The origins of GPS date back to 1964, when Ivan
Getting, who later worked with Parkinson, envisioned
a worldwide navigation system and sponsored a study.
The first GPS systems study was from 1964 to 1966.
Throughout Parkinson's involvement in GPS engi
neering, the technology has undergone several phases
of development and advanced to incorporate new gen
erations of technology.
"Back in '74, we knew we could do aircraft GPS,"
Parkinson said. "The surprise was in 1992, when we dis
covered that the implication of what we are doing is far
better than a meter it is on the level of a few inches
in three dimensions."
Parkinson identified two defining events in the his
tory of GPS.
"The first was in 1983, when the Soviets shot down
an airliner on September 1. Within two weeks Reagan
declared to the world that GPS would be available
within two weeks," Parkinson said. "The second was in
2001, when Clinton ordered deliberate errors in the
system turned off."
After recounting the history of GPS, Parkinson
identified 10 major fields that have advanced because
of the technology. He described the GPS applications
involved in aviation, emergency services, timing, agri
culture, rescue, recreation, automotive tracking, sci
ence, military, robotics and machine control.
Everyday automobile drivers experience the use
fulness of GPS in locating their destinations. The appli
cations of GPS in navigation are manifold, and contin
ually expanding.
"In 1974 we could do land navigation. In 1976, au
tomatic steering to an inch," Parkinson said.
In addition, the origin of coordinated international

time can be attributed to GPS.
"A man with one watch knows what time it is, a man
with two watches is not sure," Parkinson said. Coun
tries throughout the globe now operate on synchro
nized time.
"The idea is that users on either side of the Atlantic
look at the same satellite to identify the time," Parkin
son continued.
GPS technology is also widely applied in communi
cation.
"Almost all cell phone towers trace their origin
back to GPS," Parkinson said.
Parkinson also touched on the effects of the power
of GPS for humanity. Narrating an example of a mili
tary rescue from 1995, he outlined the role of GPS in
changing the face of rescue capability. The incident in
volved a soldier who was shot down and found six days
later by military rescue teams.
"[The soldier] attributed his success to faith in God,
courage of the rescuers, and GPS, which he referred to
as his guiding light," Parkinson said.
Despite the widespread applications of GPS, there
exist some tangible challenges in the technology's fu
ture.
"The number one foreseeable problem 1 believe is
spectrum interference," Parkinson said. He explained
how devices may interfere with a satellite or other sig
nal.
Despite where GPS technology might go in the fu
ture, Parkinson expressed amazement at the applica
tions that have already been found.
"Though we usually think of space in three dimen
sions, GPS is really four dimensional," Parkinson said.
"GPS is more than simply a satellite system, it's the
services it renders."

covered that the implication of what we are doing is far
better than a meter it is on the level of a few inches
in three dimensions."
Parkinson identified two defining events in the his
tory of GPS.
"The first was in 1983, when the Soviets shot down
an airliner on September 1. Within two weeks Reagan
declared to the world that GPS would be available
within two weeks," Parkinson said. "The second was in
2001, when Clinton ordered deliberate errors in the
system turned off."
After recounting the history of GPS, Parkinson
identified 10 major fields that have advanced because
of the technology. He described the GPS applications
involved in aviation, emergency services, timing, agri
culture, rescue, recreation, automotive tracking, sci
ence, military, robotics and machine control.
Everyday automobile drivers experience the use
fulness of GPS in locating their destinations. The appli
cations of GPS in navigation are manifold, and contin
ually expanding.
"In 1974 we could do land navigation. In 1976, au
tomatic steering to an inch," Parkinson said.
In addition, the origin of coordinated international

time can be attributed to GPS.
"A man with one watch knows what time it is, a man
with two watches is not sure," Parkinson said. Coun
tries throughout the globe now operate on synchro
nized time.
"The idea is that users on either side of the Atlantic
look at the same satellite to identify the time," Parkin
son continued.
GPS technology is also widely applied in communi
cation.
"Almost all cell phone towers trace their origin
back to GPS," Parkinson said.
Parkinson also touched on the effects of the power
of GPS for humanity. Narrating an example of a mili
tary rescue from 1995, he outlined the role of GPS in
changing the face of rescue capability. The incident in
volved a soldier who was shot down and found six days
later by military rescue teams.
"[The soldier] attributed his success to faith in God,
courage of the rescuers, and GPS, which he referred to
as his guiding light," Parkinson said.
Despite the widespread applications of GPS, there
exist some tangible challenges in the technology's fu
ture.
"The number one foreseeable problem 1 believe is
spectrum interference," Parkinson said. He explained
how devices may interfere with a satellite or other sig
nal.
Despite where GPS technology might go in the fu
ture, Parkinson expressed amazement at the applica
tions that have already been found.
"Though we usually think of space in three dimen
sions, GPS is really four dimensional," Parkinson said.
"GPS is more than simply a satellite system, it's the
services it renders."

Professor emeritus Bradford Parkinson gave a "Stanford Engineering Hero" lecture Monday evening.
Parkinson, known as the architect of the GPS, discussed GPS technology and future applications.
