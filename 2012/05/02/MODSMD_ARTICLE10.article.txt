## MURALS MIRROR MOVEMENTS 
### ERIKA ALVERO KOSKI DESK EDITOR 
Winding up the stairwells,
plastering the textured
walls outside the dorm
and surrounding the din
ers who choose to sit on
the Casa Zapata side of Stern dining hall
are a myriad of colorful murals that por
tray various political movements and is
sues pertaining to Chicano or Latino iden
tity. From a reinterpretation of Leonardo
da Vinci's "The Last Supper," in which the
title characters are all famous Chicano he
roes or social activists, to an image of the im
migrant's journey across the sea and then to
a new life, each mural holds a political or so
cial message.
"It's a generational story," said Casa Zapa
ta ethnic theme associate Gustavo Gonzalez
'l3, of the latter mural. "The grandparents
cross the water with their young daughter;
they're looking for a better life. It weaves
across generations, and eventually they come
to Stanford... It's the American dream. I
think a lot of Latinos can relate to that mural."
Jose Antonio Burciaga, an artist who was
the Casa Zapata resident fellow (RF) from
1985 to 1994, first conceived of the murals.
Those in Stern are only a few of many that
sprung up in the 1960s in various regions of
California.
"As part of the movement that came out
of the civil rights movement, there was this
whole artistic component that was all about
forging a Mexican-American identity," said
Chris Clarke 'B5, current Casa Zapata RF.
Casa Zapata was founded in 1972, during
a time when the number of Latino students
on campus was growing due to affirmative ac
tion. Several of the depictions that embellish

the stairwells up to the third floor portray
Chicano personalities students may have rec
ognized from their lives prior to Stanford,
perhaps allowing students to reconcile their
backgrounds with their new lives at an elite
university.
"You have the caricatures of the guys who
literally are the street 'vatos' ['dudes'],"
Clarke said. "The guys who hang out on the
corner... these are their friends who they
left behind in some ways, right? And they put
them on the walls to represent that they have
a place here, too."
The murals have met with some contro
versy and resistance, however. In particular,
the late Ronald Hilton, professor emeritus of
Romance languages and founder of Bolivar
House and the Institute of Hispanic Ameri
can and Luso-Brazilian Studies, was especial
ly vocal in his opposition to the politicization
of Casa Zapata through the murals. He also
disagreed with naming the theme house after
Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, ar
guing that students were not examining the
implications and actions of revolutionaries
such as Zapata.
In the mural "The Last Supper of Chicano
Heroes," Ernesto "Che" Guevara is seated in
the center, taking the place da Vinci allotted
for Jesus Christ in the original painting. An
Argentine-born Cuban revolutionary, Gue
vara is perceived as a hero by some for his role
in overthrowing Cuban dictator Fulgencio
Batista, and as a murderer by others for nu
merous executions of Batista supporters. His
presence on the mural has led to objections
by some community members.
The mural itself, painted by Burciaga,
came as a result of a survey of 100 Chicano
students at Stanford and 100 Chicano ac
tivists. Burciaga asked the participants whom
they considered to be the 13 most prominent

Chicano heroes.
"I had intended to depict the Last Supper;
Christ and his 12 apostles were to be por
trayed dining on tortillas, tamales and tequila
instead of bread and wine," Burciaga said in a
1988 Los Angeles Times article. "I dropped
that idea when some students expressed dis
may at my mixing humor with religion.That's
when I decided to replace the religious fig
ures with 13 Chicano heroes."
The results ranged from prominent Mexi
can-American painter Frida Kahlo and co
median Cantfnflas to others of non-Mexican
descent such as Martin Luther King Jr. and
Guevara.
"Latinos are a group-oriented society,"
Burciaga continued in his 1988 interview.
"Most of Mexico's national heroes were mar

tyrs, having died in service to the people
from Miguel Hidalgo, father of Mexican inde
pendence, who was executed, to revolution
ary heroes Francisco Villa and Zapata, who
were ambushed and assassinated."
While pinpointing the "top 13 Chicano he
roes" is a contested and highly subjective
task, the choices nevertheless reflected the
opinions of students at the time.
"Murals are a sort of a reimagining of a
community's values," said Jeff Chang, associ
ate director of Health & Safety Programs
and executive director of the Institute for
Diversity in the Arts. "Images become these
spaces where people then have big fights
over what these values are around the com
munity ... But the best thing is that they're
open to multiple interpretations and that en
courages the dialogue and the discourse
within the community."
The Casa Zapata murals continue to grow.
The lounge mural depicting the immigrant's
journey to the United States is unfinished.
Sarita Ocon 'O4 returns to campus from time
to time to fill in the blank spaces.
Gonzalez reflected on the popular nature
of the murals.
"The common people, the poor people,
they would see art, and they wanted to see
art that would represent everyone," he said.
"And I think these types of murals do that."

Batista, and as a murderer by others for nu
merous executions of Batista supporters. His
presence on the mural has led to objections
by some community members.
The mural itself, painted by Burciaga,
came as a result of a survey of 100 Chicano
students at Stanford and 100 Chicano ac
tivists. Burciaga asked the participants whom
they considered to be the 13 most prominent

Chicano heroes.
"I had intended to depict the Last Supper;
Christ and his 12 apostles were to be por
trayed dining on tortillas, tamales and tequila
instead of bread and wine," Burciaga said in a
1988 Los Angeles Times article. "I dropped
that idea when some students expressed dis
may at my mixing humor with religion.That's
when I decided to replace the religious fig
ures with 13 Chicano heroes."
The results ranged from prominent Mexi
can-American painter Frida Kahlo and co
median Cantfnflas to others of non-Mexican
descent such as Martin Luther King Jr. and
Guevara.
"Latinos are a group-oriented society,"
Burciaga continued in his 1988 interview.
"Most of Mexico's national heroes were mar

tyrs, having died in service to the people
from Miguel Hidalgo, father of Mexican inde
pendence, who was executed, to revolution
ary heroes Francisco Villa and Zapata, who
were ambushed and assassinated."
While pinpointing the "top 13 Chicano he
roes" is a contested and highly subjective
task, the choices nevertheless reflected the
opinions of students at the time.
"Murals are a sort of a reimagining of a
community's values," said Jeff Chang, associ
ate director of Health & Safety Programs
and executive director of the Institute for
Diversity in the Arts. "Images become these
spaces where people then have big fights
over what these values are around the com
munity ... But the best thing is that they're
open to multiple interpretations and that en
courages the dialogue and the discourse
within the community."
The Casa Zapata murals continue to grow.
The lounge mural depicting the immigrant's
journey to the United States is unfinished.
Sarita Ocon 'O4 returns to campus from time
to time to fill in the blank spaces.
Gonzalez reflected on the popular nature
of the murals.
"The common people, the poor people,
they would see art, and they wanted to see
art that would represent everyone," he said.
"And I think these types of murals do that."

The Stern dining hall mural "The Last Supper of Chicano Heroes," inspired by the da Vinci
masterpiece "The Last Supper," features Chicano activists and other leaders. Artist Jose An-tonio Burciaga polled Chicano students and activists to determine who would be depicted.

Winding up the stairwells,
plastering the textured
walls outside the dorm
and surrounding the din
ers who choose to sit on
the Casa Zapata side of Stern dining hall
are a myriad of colorful murals that por
tray various political movements and is
sues pertaining to Chicano or Latino iden
tity. From a reinterpretation of Leonardo
da Vinci's "The Last Supper," in which the
title characters are all famous Chicano he
roes or social activists, to an image of the im
migrant's journey across the sea and then to
a new life, each mural holds a political or so
cial message.
"It's a generational story," said Casa Zapa
ta ethnic theme associate Gustavo Gonzalez
'l3, of the latter mural. "The grandparents
cross the water with their young daughter;
they're looking for a better life. It weaves
across generations, and eventually they come
to Stanford... It's the American dream. I
think a lot of Latinos can relate to that mural."
Jose Antonio Burciaga, an artist who was
the Casa Zapata resident fellow (RF) from
1985 to 1994, first conceived of the murals.
Those in Stern are only a few of many that
sprung up in the 1960s in various regions of
California.
"As part of the movement that came out
of the civil rights movement, there was this
whole artistic component that was all about
forging a Mexican-American identity," said
Chris Clarke 'B5, current Casa Zapata RF.
Casa Zapata was founded in 1972, during
a time when the number of Latino students
on campus was growing due to affirmative ac
tion. Several of the depictions that embellish

the stairwells up to the third floor portray
Chicano personalities students may have rec
ognized from their lives prior to Stanford,
perhaps allowing students to reconcile their
backgrounds with their new lives at an elite
university.
"You have the caricatures of the guys who
literally are the street 'vatos' ['dudes'],"
Clarke said. "The guys who hang out on the
corner... these are their friends who they
left behind in some ways, right? And they put
them on the walls to represent that they have
a place here, too."
The murals have met with some contro
versy and resistance, however. In particular,
the late Ronald Hilton, professor emeritus of
Romance languages and founder of Bolivar
House and the Institute of Hispanic Ameri
can and Luso-Brazilian Studies, was especial
ly vocal in his opposition to the politicization
of Casa Zapata through the murals. He also
disagreed with naming the theme house after
Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, ar
guing that students were not examining the
implications and actions of revolutionaries
such as Zapata.
In the mural "The Last Supper of Chicano
Heroes," Ernesto "Che" Guevara is seated in
the center, taking the place da Vinci allotted
for Jesus Christ in the original painting. An
Argentine-born Cuban revolutionary, Gue
vara is perceived as a hero by some for his role
in overthrowing Cuban dictator Fulgencio
Batista, and as a murderer by others for nu
merous executions of Batista supporters. His
presence on the mural has led to objections
