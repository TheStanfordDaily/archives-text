## Greek alcohol violations 
### â€“ Natasha Weaser 
With fraternity Kappa
Sigma set to regain its
housing for the 2012-13
academic year after losing
it for one year due to con
cerns of excessive alcohol consumption
and policy violations, The Daily took a look
back at alcohol-related infringements com
mitted by Greek groups in the past.
Alcohol policy infringements have not
been limited to fraternities alone. In 1983,
The Daily reported that sorority Pi Beta
Phi was on probation for hazing with alco
hol during the pledging process ("ResEd
puts Pi Phis on probation," April 25,1985).

'"At Wednesday's party, pledges were
taken to an off-campus bar, to the Mau
soleum and finally to the Boathouse,' [Row
Director] Diana Conklin said."
"'Apparently several people were quite
seriously drunk, to the point where they
could barely stand,' Conklin said."
In 1993, The Daily reported on alleged
rush infractions at fraternities Kappa
Sigma and Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE).
Both fraternities were accused of serving
alcohol to minors during the rush process
("Two frats under fire for Rush infrac
tions," April 20,1993).
"The alleged transgressions violate two
different sets of rules," the article read.
"One is the rush code agreed upon by fra
ternities that stated Rush is to be dry this
year that no alcohol is to be served at
Rush events. The other is a University poli
cy that bans serving alcohol to minors."
'"We did nothing,' [SAE co-president

Aaron Hendelman] said. 'There was never
any alcohol served to any minors or
rushees at an SAE Rush event."'
"'We haven't quite made the paradigm
shift realizing that you can't buy rushees
with alcohol,' [Fraternal Affairs Adviser]
Heather Dunn said. Dunn added, however,
that 'there are groups playing by the rules .
.. and those men are to be commended.'"
During the ensuing five-week investiga
tion, The Daily reported on May 11 that
two SAE pledges were arrested for stealing
42 dollars worth of sheets from the Palo
Alto Hyatt for a toga party that was to be
held at the fraternity later that evening
("Two SAE pledges arrested for theft,"
May 11,1993).
"Director of Student Affairs Nanci
Howe called the incident 'really stupid.'
She said the SAE's could face 'fines, com
munity service or special training,"' the ar
ticle read.

The Daily later reported that Kappa
Sigma admitted to serving alcohol during
rush and would face a confidential penalty
("Kappa Sig admits serving alcohol during
dry rush," May 25,1993).
More recently in 2004, sorority Delta
Delta Delta was placed on a one-year sus
pension for hazing and underage alcohol
consumption during the pledging process.
"At the event, four freshman football
players hosted a 'power hour', during
which four sorority pledges drank a shot
of beer every minute for an hour, accord
ing to the police report regarding the inci
dent. Five sorority members purchased
the alcohol," The Daily reported ("Tri
Delt placed on suspension until June
2005," Feb. 27,2004).
No major alcohol related incidents have
been reported this academic year.
