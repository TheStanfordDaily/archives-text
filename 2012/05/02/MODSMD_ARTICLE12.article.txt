## EDITORIAL Cognitive stimulants, health education and organization kids 
### 
In June 2010, The Daily suc
cinctly summarized the de
bate over the use of Adderall
and other cognitive stimulants
by students without a prescrip
tion: "Some consider it the aca
demic equivalent of perform
ance-enhancing steroids; to oth
ers, it's just a mental booster on
par with a large jolt of caffeine"
("All about Adderall," June 3,
2010). How should we reconcile
the gap between these two
streams of thought? The ques
tion is more than theoretical, for
although Adderall is classified
as a Schedule II controlled sub
stance a category that in
cludes cocaine and metham
phetamine it is probably safe
to assume that more students at
Stanford are using Adderall
than these other drugs. Though
there are no public figures for
off-label ADHD-medication
usage rates at Stanford, studies
at other colleges report student
usage as high as 34 percent of
the general student population
to 48 percent of students within
the Greek system.
How should an institution
like Stanford respond to the use
of cognitive stimulants, especial
ly in its substance use education?
Should these stimulants be treat
ed like alcohol, with efforts fo
cused on safe and responsible
consumption rather than a dra
conian crackdown, or does the il
legality of off-label stimulant
consumption merit a harsher
stance? The primary concerns
over Adderall consumption fall
into two clusters: moral consider
ations like equality of access and
academic integrity, contrasted
with more practical concerns
over safety and campus culture.
Some view illegal cognitive
enhancer consumption as aca
demically dishonorable. We, how
ever, believe the off-label use of
cognitive enhancers should not
be considered cheating on par
with plagiarizing an essay or
copying answers during a test;
with cognitive enhancers, the
work is still done by the student
himself, and there is evidence that
cognitive enhancers limit creativ
ity. Additionally, there are moral

concerns over equality of access.
vWhereas caffeine is available
for free in the dining hall, stu
dents often charge each other for
stronger cognitive stimulants.
Avre wealthier students more
likely to purchase off-label stimu
lants, and if so, is this advantage
fundamentally unfair? If it is un
fair, is it distinct morally from the
fact that wealthier students are
also better able to afford private
tutors and other study aides
above the level provided for free
by the University?
Regardless of one's stance on
these ethical questions, we be
lieve that practical concerns offer
stronger reasons for being op
posed to off-label consumption
of cognitive enhancers. Adderall,
for example, can have dangerous
interactions with other medica
tions or health conditions. Taking
Adderall alongside antidepres
sants such as MAO inhibitors can
be fatal, and preexisting condi
tions like high blood pressure can
also result in harmful effects. In
addition, Adderall and similar
drugs can be habit-forming. In
general, students are unlikely to
read the fine print when getting a
pill from a friend or classmate as
opposed to a doctor, and may not
realize that they're at particularly
high risk for a bad reaction to a
cognitive stimulant. Further
more, a drug's approval is contin
gent upon the estimated benefits
and risks for the clinical popula
tion at which the drug is aimed,
and using cognitive stimulants
electively may tilt the balance of
benefits and risks.
In addition, several issues of
social norms and campus culture
arise. As discussed in our Monday
editorial, Stanford students can
get caught in an unhealthy, "work
hard, play hard" spiral. Amidst
this overburdening, taking cogni
tive stimulants becomes another
status symbol that you're work
ing hard and taking advantage of
the opportunities Stanford offers.
As political philosopher Michael
Sandel observes in "The Case
Against Perfection," "Unlike the
drugs of the sixties and seventies,

Ritalin and Adderall are not for
checking out but for buckling
down... away of answering a
competitive society's demand to
improve our performance." Cog
nitive stimulants can thus be a
reflection of a work-obsessed
college culture, and the danger
may lie less in their medical ram
ifications than in the productivi
ty-at-all-costs ethos they pro
mote.

In short, the potentially
widespread off-label consump
tion by students who may not be
aware of dangerous interactions
with other medications merits
an active though not neces
sarily extensive endeavor to
include discussion of safe usage
in health education efforts. We
should also be aware of the cam
pus culture that widespread
usage of cognitive stimulants
may promote. Cognitive en
hancers, and perhaps all stimu
lants, should receive some stig
ma for promoting this worka
holic ethos, and the added safe

ty concerns they entail when
used off-label point to a need for
more discussion of the risks of
their usage.
