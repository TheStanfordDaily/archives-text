# BURSTING THE BUBBLE

gets better," coo the
I grainy You Tube videos
X backed by soft music
videos that have starred everyone
from President Obama to Vinnie
Guadagnino. "Your life may be
tough right now, but out of high
school. . . [insert sensitive at
tempt to relate here] ... blah blah
blah ... it gets better."
And yet hundreds of teens
take their lives every year. One of
those kids was Jack Reese, a Utah
teen who took his own life last
week. Add that to the list of
names: Clementi, Rodemeyer,
Hubley, Walsh the list goes on.
All of them have one thing in
common: they were bullied, de
pressed and yeah, okay, they were
gay-
I certainly remember that time
in late 2010 when the gay suicides,
as they were called, were in the

news. People started paying more
attention. We had pink shirts, pur
ple shirts, "It Gets Better" videos,
guest speakers, the works.
Unsurprisingly, a year and a
half later, people have tuned out.
Many may have heard of Tyler
Clementi, who remains in the
news, or Jamey Rodemeyer,
whose memory was honored by
Glee heartthrob Grant Gustin
two weeks ago, or Jamey Hubley,
whose "It Gets Better" video and
Tumblr blog went viral after news
of his death.
But what of Ken Weishuhn Jr.,
the lowa 14-year-old who com
mitted suicide last month? Or
Eric James Borges, who killed
himself in January? Or Jeffrey
Fehr, who hanged himself on New
Year's Day in Granite Bay?
And in our age, these names
aren't just small print in the paper.

They're Facebook pages,
You Tube videos, Tumblr blogs.
They're animate human beings,
and you can see them, hear them,
dance with them and vicariously
feel their pain.
"I'm tired of life, really. It's so
hard. I'm sorry, I can't take it any
more," Hubley's blog wrote in its
last post. I remember flipping
through those pages, horrified
and yet unable to look away.
"It gets better," we hear, and
yet teenage suicide because of
bullying remains in the news. For
not as long, with fewer paying at
tention it seems we're all a lit
tle tired of those blathering,
grainy You Tube videos. But it's

obvious that there is so much
more to do. Two Colorado State
University freshmen were beaten
to a pulp last week by their foot
ball team after responding to ho
mophobic slurs. It might be get
ting better, but it's not nearly
good enough.
This week people are grieving
for the loss of Reese, whose sui
cide at 17 is cruel, unfair and un
fathomable. Those still paying at
tention are shocked, mourn and
write cute comments expressing
regret on online message boards.
There will undoubtedly be a plug
for counseling services and a
place for you to donate to Reese's
memory.
But that doesn't make it get
better. And, let's be honest, nei
ther do those You Tube videos.
We're past the awareness stage; if
we're serious about making it bet
ter for these kids, we've got to re
ally make it happen, and that
means all of us doing more than
hitting record on our Macßooks.
We're going to need to be the
role models that those kids didn't

have and I don't mean role
models that you never actually
get to meet, like Gaga and
Obama and Madonna.
We're going to need to be
there and stand up and be living,
breathing evidence that it really
does get better: gay cops, soldiers,
politicians, celebrities, business
men and professional athletes.
Bullied teens don't need to hear
Kim Kardashian trying to relate
to their struggles. They need
someone real to show them that it
really is worth sticking it out.
That means, for gay people
who are privileged enough to be
happy and in public life, there's
really no excuse for silence any
more.
Eric James Borges cut a
You Tube video in December
2011. "You have an entire life that
bursts with opportunities ahead
of you," he said into the camera.
"Don't ever give up." He killed
himself a month later.
How much longer must we
wait before the successful, proud,
famous and, above all, happy
among us stand up and prove that
it really does get better?

We're past the awareness stage; if
we're serious about making it bet
ter for these kids, we've got to re
ally make it happen, and that
means all of us doing more than
hitting record on our Macßooks.
We're going to need to be the
role models that those kids didn't

have and I don't mean role
models that you never actually
get to meet, like Gaga and
Obama and Madonna.
We're going to need to be
there and stand up and be living,
breathing evidence that it really
does get better: gay cops, soldiers,
politicians, celebrities, business
men and professional athletes.
Bullied teens don't need to hear
Kim Kardashian trying to relate
to their struggles. They need
someone real to show them that it
really is worth sticking it out.
That means, for gay people
who are privileged enough to be
happy and in public life, there's
really no excuse for silence any
more.
Eric James Borges cut a
You Tube video in December
2011. "You have an entire life that
bursts with opportunities ahead
of you," he said into the camera.
"Don't ever give up." He killed
himself a month later.
How much longer must we
wait before the successful, proud,
famous and, above all, happy
among us stand up and prove that
it really does get better?

gets better," coo the
I grainy You Tube videos
X backed by soft music
videos that have starred everyone
from President Obama to Vinnie
Guadagnino. "Your life may be
tough right now, but out of high
school. . . [insert sensitive at
tempt to relate here] ... blah blah
blah ... it gets better."
And yet hundreds of teens
take their lives every year. One of
those kids was Jack Reese, a Utah
teen who took his own life last
week. Add that to the list of
names: Clementi, Rodemeyer,
Hubley, Walsh the list goes on.
All of them have one thing in
common: they were bullied, de
pressed and yeah, okay, they were
gay-
I certainly remember that time
in late 2010 when the gay suicides,
as they were called, were in the

news. People started paying more
attention. We had pink shirts, pur
ple shirts, "It Gets Better" videos,
guest speakers, the works.
Unsurprisingly, a year and a
half later, people have tuned out.
Many may have heard of Tyler
Clementi, who remains in the
news, or Jamey Rodemeyer,
whose memory was honored by
Glee heartthrob Grant Gustin
two weeks ago, or Jamey Hubley,
whose "It Gets Better" video and
Tumblr blog went viral after news
of his death.
But what of Ken Weishuhn Jr.,
the lowa 14-year-old who com
mitted suicide last month? Or
Eric James Borges, who killed
himself in January? Or Jeffrey
Fehr, who hanged himself on New
Year's Day in Granite Bay?
And in our age, these names
aren't just small print in the paper.

They're Facebook pages,
You Tube videos, Tumblr blogs.
They're animate human beings,
and you can see them, hear them,
dance with them and vicariously
feel their pain.
"I'm tired of life, really. It's so
hard. I'm sorry, I can't take it any
more," Hubley's blog wrote in its
last post. I remember flipping
through those pages, horrified
and yet unable to look away.
"It gets better," we hear, and
yet teenage suicide because of
bullying remains in the news. For
not as long, with fewer paying at
tention it seems we're all a lit
tle tired of those blathering,
grainy You Tube videos. But it's

obvious that there is so much
more to do. Two Colorado State
University freshmen were beaten
to a pulp last week by their foot
ball team after responding to ho
mophobic slurs. It might be get
ting better, but it's not nearly
good enough.
This week people are grieving
for the loss of Reese, whose sui
cide at 17 is cruel, unfair and un
fathomable. Those still paying at
tention are shocked, mourn and
write cute comments expressing
regret on online message boards.
There will undoubtedly be a plug
for counseling services and a
place for you to donate to Reese's
memory.
But that doesn't make it get
better. And, let's be honest, nei
ther do those You Tube videos.
