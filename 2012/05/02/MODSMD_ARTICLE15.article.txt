# RAVALATIONS
## Shit sororities say (that they really shouldn't) 
### Ravali Reddy 
I am very removed from Greek
life here at Stanford. I have
quite a few friends who are an
active part of the Greek commu
nity, but apart from the occasion
al dinner or study session at one
of the housed sororities or a
weekend night spent at a party
thrown by one of the fraternities,
it's a scene that I, having never
rushed, am not a part of. Despite
the numerous barriers that sepa
rate me from the sororities, I still
know who got a bid to what soror
ity this year. Everyone does, and
it's all because of the infamous
Facebook posts.
You all know what I'm talking
about that flood of Facebook
activity where all the Stanford
sorority girls you know add 30+
new friends and spend all day dis
tributing wall posts welcoming
their new additions and telling
them how excited they are that
they chose to be a Pi Phi/Alpha
Phi/Chi O/Theta/Kappa/Tridelt.
Thanks to Facebook's strange
and creepy decision to inform me
when one of my friends writes on
the wall or comments on the
photo of someone I don't know,

these posts flood my newsfeed,
along with the newsfeeds of just
about every other Stanford stu
dent (as evidenced by the recent
MemeChu post that read, "Brace
yourselves. The sorority FB posts
are coming").
Now, there are some things in
life that I will just never under
stand. I will never understand
why some people still use My-
Space. I will never understand
why some clothes that look so
great on the rack look so terrible
on me. And I will never under
stand why the sororities choose to
inundate Facebook with these
gushy declarations of love and
sisterhood.
See, here's the thing: I under
stand that the older members are
extremely excited to see fresh

faces and get to know the new
girls that they forever more will
have something in common with,
but you would think that the
sororities would realize that
Facebook just isn't the best plat
form for their excitement. Be
yond just being slightly annoying
these posts combined with the
constant spring quarter rollouts
leave a significant portion of
campus with clenched jaws
these posts don't exactly display
the tact and class that the sorori
ties are always claiming to exude.
Every year, many girls won't
get into the sorority of their
choosing. As one of the only girls
among my group of friends who
chose not to rush last year, I re
member receiving phone calls
from various upset friends who
were rushing when they realized
they had been cut from the soror
ity they wanted to be in. An upset
friend would describe all the rea
sons why they would have been a
perfect [insert sorority here] and
overanalyze all of the things that
may have implied they weren't
[insert sorority here] material.
Given the harsh sting of rejec
tion so many girls feel, I don't un

derstand why the sororities insist
on using a public forum like Face
book when they know that girls
that they turned down will see
those posts.
For most of us, the sorority
Facebook posts are nothing more
than a part of spring quarter that
we have come to expect. Last
year, my friends were on the re
ceiving end and this year, as soph
omores, they're among those who
have indulged in the excited
friending and posting that ac
companies Bid Day. But every
year, there are quite a few girls
for whom the posts are a re
minder of the fact that they didn't
quite get what they wanted, and
since most of them will never
speak up, I'm doing it on their be
half.
In the future, sororities should
really try to be more tactful and
tone down the PDA. Doing so
will not only force them to come
up with more meaningful, private
ways of expressing their excite
ment, but it'll also help promote a
sense of sisterhood among a
greater proportion of the female
population at Stanford one
that transcends just the girls in
your sorority.

great on the rack look so terrible
on me. And I will never under
stand why the sororities choose to
inundate Facebook with these
gushy declarations of love and
sisterhood.
See, here's the thing: I under
stand that the older members are
extremely excited to see fresh

faces and get to know the new
girls that they forever more will
have something in common with,
but you would think that the
sororities would realize that
Facebook just isn't the best plat
form for their excitement. Be
yond just being slightly annoying
these posts combined with the
constant spring quarter rollouts
leave a significant portion of
campus with clenched jaws
these posts don't exactly display
the tact and class that the sorori
ties are always claiming to exude.
Every year, many girls won't
get into the sorority of their
choosing. As one of the only girls
among my group of friends who
chose not to rush last year, I re
member receiving phone calls
from various upset friends who
were rushing when they realized
they had been cut from the soror
ity they wanted to be in. An upset
friend would describe all the rea
sons why they would have been a
perfect [insert sorority here] and
overanalyze all of the things that
may have implied they weren't
[insert sorority here] material.
Given the harsh sting of rejec
tion so many girls feel, I don't un

derstand why the sororities insist
on using a public forum like Face
book when they know that girls
that they turned down will see
those posts.
For most of us, the sorority
Facebook posts are nothing more
than a part of spring quarter that
we have come to expect. Last
year, my friends were on the re
ceiving end and this year, as soph
omores, they're among those who
have indulged in the excited
friending and posting that ac
companies Bid Day. But every
year, there are quite a few girls
for whom the posts are a re
minder of the fact that they didn't
quite get what they wanted, and
since most of them will never
speak up, I'm doing it on their be
half.
In the future, sororities should
really try to be more tactful and
tone down the PDA. Doing so
will not only force them to come
up with more meaningful, private
ways of expressing their excite
ment, but it'll also help promote a
sense of sisterhood among a
greater proportion of the female
population at Stanford one
that transcends just the girls in
your sorority.

No need to tone down the PDA

yet, friend her on Facebook!
