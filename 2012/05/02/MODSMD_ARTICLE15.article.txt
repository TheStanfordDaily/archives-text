## Shit sororities say (that they really shouldn't) 
### Ravali Reddy 
I am very removed from Greek
life here at Stanford. I have
quite a few friends who are an
active part of the Greek commu
nity, but apart from the occasion
al dinner or study session at one
of the housed sororities or a
weekend night spent at a party
thrown by one of the fraternities,
it's a scene that I, having never
rushed, am not a part of. Despite
the numerous barriers that sepa
rate me from the sororities, I still
know who got a bid to what soror
ity this year. Everyone does, and
it's all because of the infamous
Facebook posts.
You all know what I'm talking
about that flood of Facebook
activity where all the Stanford
sorority girls you know add 30+
new friends and spend all day dis
tributing wall posts welcoming
their new additions and telling
them how excited they are that
they chose to be a Pi Phi/Alpha
Phi/Chi O/Theta/Kappa/Tridelt.
Thanks to Facebook's strange
and creepy decision to inform me
when one of my friends writes on
the wall or comments on the
photo of someone I don't know,

these posts flood my newsfeed,
along with the newsfeeds of just
about every other Stanford stu
dent (as evidenced by the recent
MemeChu post that read, "Brace
yourselves. The sorority FB posts
are coming").
Now, there are some things in
life that I will just never under
stand. I will never understand
why some people still use My-
Space. I will never understand
why some clothes that look so
great on the rack look so terrible
on me. And I will never under
stand why the sororities choose to
inundate Facebook with these
gushy declarations of love and
sisterhood.
See, here's the thing: I under
stand that the older members are
extremely excited to see fresh
