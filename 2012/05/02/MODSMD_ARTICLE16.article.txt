# OP-ED
## Remember Sam and Cady by letting go of mental health stigma 
### EMILY COHODES '13 
As I approached the en
trance to Memorial
Church, where Samantha
Wopat's memorial was being held,
I couldn't help but notice the two
thick lines of people at each door.
Athletes dressed in uniform, stu
dents from every corner of cam
pus, best friends of Sam, room
mates, family members, professors,
and community members lined up
to honor the life of the beautiful
spirit whose passing had undoubt
edly left them wanting answers
and a form of closure for this sud
den tragedy. In that moment, I was
overwhelmed by the juxtaposition
of the extreme loneliness that I
witness in the suicidal callers that
have called me during my weekly
shifts at the Bridge Peer Counsel
ing Center, and the crowd of peo
ple coming in to celebrate Sam's
life. I have worked as a peer coun
selor for the past three years and
have dealt with two suicide calls in
this time. Each time I have been si
multaneously shocked at the in
credible loneliness that students
can feel at Stanford amidst a mas
sive, often nameless student body

and grateful that I have the train
ing to recognize signs of suicide
and the ability to get these callers
the help that they need.
As I watched the crowd of
mourners file into the church, I
desperately wished Sam could
have been standing next to me,
could have watched these hun
dreds of community members pa
rade in to honor her life. I only
wish that Sam could have felt the
support that I and all other mem
bers of the audience felt for her in
the final hours of her life when
there seemed to be no other op
tions but to leave us.
I myself did not have the honor
of meeting Sam or Cady Hine, the
two students who recently passed
away, and although Sam and I
lived in the same dorm and Cady
and I worked in some of the same
mental health groups on campus, I
was not lucky enough to cross
paths with the beautiful, fun-lov
ing, and caring souls whom I have
heard speakers at Sam's memori
al and friends of Cady attest to in
the weeks following their deaths.
At Sam's memorial, we heard

from representatives of different
realms of Sam's life and I, like
many others in the audience,
found myself asking why. As Rev
erend Joanne Sanders said in her
opening words at Sam's memori
al, it is natural for our grief to form
the question of why. Why would
someone with such a bright fu
ture, academic talent, athletic
ability, innate poet's voice, ador
ing friends and family, have found
herself in a situation where she
felt she had no other option but to
take her own life? In a grief group
led by Donnovan Yisrael, I heard
Cady's mentors and friends de
scribe her commitment to helping
students with the types of mental
health issues that had troubled
her, often serving on panels with
Stanford Peace of Mind to bring
awareness to other students
about the prevalence of mental
health issues on campus. While
the cause of Cady's death has not
been officially reported, I find
myself wondering why someone
who was so aware of the resources
