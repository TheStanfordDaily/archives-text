## V-Day and militarism 
### REV. GEOFF BROWNING United Campus Christian Ministry (UCCM) Campus Minister Writer's note: This is a personal opinion not necessarily the opinion of UCCM students 
We all know what V-Day is,
the day that victory was
declared in the wars
against Japan and Germany in
WWII. Eve Ensler, in her book
and play, "The Vagina Mono
logues" has reclaimed the mean
ing of "V" to mean "Victory,
Valentine, and Vagina" and to
build V-Day into a global activist
movement to end violence against
women and girls. Stanford V-
Week just presented an extraordi
nary production of "The Vagina
Monologues" that was profound,
hilarious and heart-rending all at
the same time. But I would like to
call attention to a seldom-ac
knowledged connection between
militarism and sexual violence.
As Stanford V-Week has been
working to communicate, vio
lence against women is epidemic.
Among the grim statistics, one in
three women globally will be the
victims of battery and/or sexual
abuse sometime in their lives.
Somewhere in America, a woman
is battered every 15 seconds.
Globally, four million women and
girls are trafficked into sexual
slavery every year.
According to a recent Defense
Department report, there were
over 3,100 sexual assaults in our
professionally trained military in
2011. But these are only the re
ported assaults; the Pentagon be
lieves the actual number is much
higher. Non-Pentagon sources say
it may be as much as 10 times this
number. Think about that: more
than 30,000 sexual assaults. This
means that every woman who
serves in the military is at greater
risk of being assaulted by her fel

low soldiers than being killed or
wounded by the enemy!
Rape has long been a weapon
of and considered one of the
spoils of war from the time of
Cicero to current conflicts around
the globe, from El Salvador to the
Congo to Sarajevo to the "com
fort" women of the Japanese occu
pation. It is no accident that we
refer to rape not just as a sexually
violent act, but also as a frequent
military action, such as the rape of
Nanking where 250,000 people
were raped and slaughtered. Such
military actions are illustrative be
cause they reveal the total and ex
cessive dominance of victor over
victim. This dominance is painful
ly clear in Iraq; Die prestigious
journal of medicine, "The
Lancet," conducted a study of
civilian deaths in the Iraq war,
concluding that more than
600,000 civilians have died.
Military generals talk about
"full-spectrum dominance" by
which they mean domination of
land, sea, air, space and informa
tion. War is about dominating the
enemy, and sexual violence is also
about domination. You can't have
war without a corresponding in
crease in sexual violence. There
are clear correlations. Hence it is
little wonder that our professional
military has had such difficulty
eradicating chronic sexual assault.
The United States spends more
on our military than the rest of the
world combined. Freudian sym
bology would suggest that
weapons are phallic symbols and
an overabundance of these
weapons is an attempt to compen
sate for our fear of impotence in

the world. But of course, as Freud
said, sometimes a cigar is just a
cigar. Nevertheless, when the
world is awash in weapons and the
United States is the biggest suppli
er of those weapons, when armies
in Africa and Europe have estab
lished rape camps, and when
women soldiers have a greater
risk of becoming casualties of sex
ual assault by their own country
men than of being killed or
wounded by the enemy, then the
link between militarism and sexu
al violence begins to come into
focus.
Militarism and the "feminine"
values of relationship and nurture
are inversely proportional; men in
the military are taught to fear the
feminine and emasculation
throughout their training. As our
militarism increases, feminine val
ues are suppressed and denied
their rightful place in society. And
as we reject this necessary part of
our psyche, we will become sick in
body and soul.
If we truly want to eliminate
sexual violence, we must work for
the demilitarization of our society,
our culture, and the world. We can
begin reducing sexual violence by
decreasing our profligate military
spending and misogynistic train
ing. We must dismantle the "mili
tary industrial complex" about
which Eisenhower warned us, or I
fear that our work to end sexual
violence will be in vain.

build V-Day into a global activist
movement to end violence against
women and girls. Stanford V-
Week just presented an extraordi
nary production of "The Vagina
Monologues" that was profound,
hilarious and heart-rending all at
the same time. But I would like to
call attention to a seldom-ac
knowledged connection between
militarism and sexual violence.
As Stanford V-Week has been
working to communicate, vio
lence against women is epidemic.
Among the grim statistics, one in
three women globally will be the
victims of battery and/or sexual
abuse sometime in their lives.
Somewhere in America, a woman
is battered every 15 seconds.
Globally, four million women and
girls are trafficked into sexual
slavery every year.
According to a recent Defense
Department report, there were
over 3,100 sexual assaults in our
professionally trained military in
2011. But these are only the re
ported assaults; the Pentagon be
lieves the actual number is much
higher. Non-Pentagon sources say
it may be as much as 10 times this
number. Think about that: more
than 30,000 sexual assaults. This
means that every woman who
serves in the military is at greater
risk of being assaulted by her fel

low soldiers than being killed or
wounded by the enemy!
Rape has long been a weapon
of and considered one of the
spoils of war from the time of
Cicero to current conflicts around
the globe, from El Salvador to the
Congo to Sarajevo to the "com
fort" women of the Japanese occu
pation. It is no accident that we
refer to rape not just as a sexually
violent act, but also as a frequent
military action, such as the rape of
Nanking where 250,000 people
were raped and slaughtered. Such
military actions are illustrative be
cause they reveal the total and ex
cessive dominance of victor over
victim. This dominance is painful
ly clear in Iraq; Die prestigious
journal of medicine, "The
Lancet," conducted a study of
civilian deaths in the Iraq war,
concluding that more than
600,000 civilians have died.
Military generals talk about
"full-spectrum dominance" by
which they mean domination of
land, sea, air, space and informa
tion. War is about dominating the
enemy, and sexual violence is also
about domination. You can't have
war without a corresponding in
crease in sexual violence. There
are clear correlations. Hence it is
little wonder that our professional
military has had such difficulty
eradicating chronic sexual assault.
The United States spends more
on our military than the rest of the
world combined. Freudian sym
bology would suggest that
weapons are phallic symbols and
an overabundance of these
weapons is an attempt to compen
sate for our fear of impotence in

the world. But of course, as Freud
said, sometimes a cigar is just a
cigar. Nevertheless, when the
world is awash in weapons and the
United States is the biggest suppli
er of those weapons, when armies
in Africa and Europe have estab
lished rape camps, and when
women soldiers have a greater
risk of becoming casualties of sex
ual assault by their own country
men than of being killed or
wounded by the enemy, then the
link between militarism and sexu
al violence begins to come into
focus.
Militarism and the "feminine"
values of relationship and nurture
are inversely proportional; men in
the military are taught to fear the
feminine and emasculation
throughout their training. As our
militarism increases, feminine val
ues are suppressed and denied
their rightful place in society. And
as we reject this necessary part of
our psyche, we will become sick in
body and soul.
If we truly want to eliminate
sexual violence, we must work for
the demilitarization of our society,
our culture, and the world. We can
begin reducing sexual violence by
decreasing our profligate military
spending and misogynistic train
ing. We must dismantle the "mili
tary industrial complex" about
which Eisenhower warned us, or I
fear that our work to end sexual
violence will be in vain.
