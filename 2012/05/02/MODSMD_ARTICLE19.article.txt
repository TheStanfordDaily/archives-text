## SPARTAN STUNNER 
### PALANI ESWARAN STAFF WRITER 
On Tuesday afternoon, the
No. 12 Stanford baseball team
traveled south to face San Jose
State, looking to avenge an un
expected loss to the Spartans on
April 17. However, take two was
no kinder to the Card, which
suffered a second defeat in as
many weeks against San Jose,
losing 8-5.
Unlike its previous matchup,
Stanford's (28-12, 8-5 Pac-12)
bats were impressive against the
Spartans (21-20,5-4 WAC). How
ever, the usually impressive Car

dinal pitchers struggled to find a
rhythm in the loss.
In the first inning. Spartan
starter David Wayne Russo set
down the first three batters, while
Stanford starter John Hochstat
ter didn't fare so well. The fresh
man gave up a leadoff single to
centerfielder Andrew Rodriguez
and walked second baseman
Jacob Valdez, then allowed the
first run of the game when right
fielder Nick Schulz doubled
down the left field line.
But the bleeding didn't stop
there, as first baseman Matt
Lopez singled to center to bring
in another run for San Jose State,

Hochstatter was then pulled
from the game without recording
a single out. Junior reliever Dean
McArdle managed to give up just
one more run, a sacrifice fly by
leftfielder Michael Gerlach, be
fore managing his way out of the
inning.
Despite the early deficit, the
Card got back into the game in
the second. Sophomore first
baseman Brian Ragira led off the
inning with a double, and fellow
sophomore Austin Wilson hit a
home run to left field that
brought the Cardinal within one.
In the third inning, the Spar
tans tacked on another run when

Valdez scored on a throwing
error by Stanford redshirt junior
catcher Christian Griffiths. In the
top half of the inning, the Cardi
nal loaded the bases, but fresh
man third baseman Alex Blandi
no hit a grounder to short that
ended the inning.
Stanford finally evened the
score with San Jose State in the
fourth after Griffiths walked and
centerfielder Jake Stewart home
red to left field. But the success
was short-lived, and the wheels
came off for the Cardinal in the
bottom half of the inning.
The first batter of the inning,
catcher Kyle Gallegos, reached
first on an infield single. Two bat
ters later, Rodriguez hit a home
run off McArdle, and the Spar
tans took a 6-4 lead. Redshirt
sophomore Garrett Hughes
came in to relieve McArdle and
struck out the first batter he
faced, but after a single, a walk
and a wild pitch, runners were on
second and third. Gerlach then
singled to drive in a run, and
Lopez scored on an error. Hugh
es struck out Caleb Natov to end
the inning, but the Spartans had
piled up four runs to lead 8-4.
In the fifth inning, Wilson hit
another home run this time a
solo shot to center field and
the Cardinal pulled within three
runs of San Jose State. In the bot
tom half, Hughes continued in re
lief. Despite having a runner on
third with just one out, he es
caped the inning unscathed.
The Cardinal did nothing of
fensively in the sixth, and fresh
man David Schmidt relieved
Hughes on the mound. Schmidt
pitched well, giving up no hits and
just one walk, and recording two
strikeouts in two innings.
In the bottom of the eighth
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess decided to send junior des
ignated hitter Stephen Piscotty to
the mound, where Piscotty

Jose State. Sophomore Austin Wilson added two more home runs, but pitching woes doomed the Card.
