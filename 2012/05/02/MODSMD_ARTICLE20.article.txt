# Sometimes, you just have to be there

### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
June 14,2009, was not a fun
day for this guy. Fresh off
the completion of my
freshman year and with a
full summer of earning
potential around the corner, I
made the instantly regrettable de
cision to drop far too much money
on nosebleed seats for Game 5 of
the NBA Finals. In the grand
scheme of things, the price wasn't
going to impact my life. But for an
18-year-old whose gigs had in
cluded a stint at Quiznos and an
unpaid internship at a local radio
station, the ticket represented at
least 40 percent of my net worth.
In my defense, I justified the
purchase with the thought that
this may be the last time I'd get the
opportunity to see my Orlando
Magic legitimately contend for a
title. What if I missed the game of
a lifetime? What if Game 5 was
the turning point in the series, the
dominant victory that sparked a
comeback from the 3-1 deficit I
had convinced myself was man
ageable.
It wasn't.The Magic lost, 99-86.
Since that day, I've been hesi
tant to pull the trigger to watch
any live sports event. Seeing a
game in person just hasn't had the
same value, and with the rapid
evolution of televised events, I
just can't seem to find the will to
pony up my hard-earned cash for
a subpar view with limited replays
and obnoxious fans.
But recently I decided to ease
my way back into the fold as a
spectator, and I was able to spend

$5 for the Payton Jordan Invita
tional on Sunday at Stanford. The
annual outdoor track meet has
been and will forever be one of the
most underappreciated and excit
ing events this campus has to offer.
The competition draws many of
the best runners in the world, and
athletes vying for global recogni
tion routinely shatter records.
This meet had special signifi
cance, however, as my freshman
roommate and good friend Chris
Derrick was attempting to meet
the Olympic "A" standard in the
10K with a time of 27:45. He ran it
in 27:31, setting the school and
American collegiate record along
the way. If you do the math, that is
... absurdly fast.
I've been hyped since and
have re-evaluated my conserva
tive stance on live sports. If Chris
manages to qualify for a certain
competition in London this sum
mer (jinx-proof), then I'll be faced
with the predicament of buying
last-minute tickets to Europe

and, more importantly, actual
passes to the event.
I'm no longer 18. This is a big
deal.
But what else will I spend my
money on? I live nothing close to
a lavish lifestyle, and the liberal
college kid in me figures I might
as well do what makes me happy
while I'm young and my schedule
is relatively flexible. I don't re
member sports ever leaving me as
genuinely excited as I was on Sun
day, except maybe for the 2009
Payton Jordan Invitational.
There was something about
being in that particular moment,
witnessing someone I know do
something that very few people
have ever been able to do, that res
onated with me. If I could buy a
(legal) pill that could duplicate
that feeling, I probably would.
Maybe it was because that event
brought me out of my jaded sports
funk that had plagued my level of
fandom. Whatever the case, I left
the track feeling damn proud of
Chris and damn proud of myself
for shelling out five bucks to wit
ness a small piece of history.
On a depressing note, it's going
to be extremely tough for profes
sional sports to sustain any sort of

economic success with their cur
rent models. Ticket sales will un
doubtedly plateau or decrease as
technology in the home improves,
and owners will be pushed to find
alternative ways to fill seats. I'm
not the only passionate fan who
has found less of a need, be it for
financial reasons or others, to be
physically present at games.
Yet there's a reason people
have attended athletic competi
tions for millennia. Free or not,
spectators are able to derive that
unique rush from live action that
just isn't available through a mon
itor. Sure, I've been inappropri
ately pumped after a last-second
shot on TV, but that feeling comes
and goes as the network switches
programs.There's just no sense of
camaraderie, no pure bond be
tween fans and players. It's not for
everyone, but for me, there's real
ly nothing better.
With that, hit me up if you have
connections in London. I'm okay
with sleeping on the couch.

Zach Zimmerman's 10K time
would be blistering... if only he
could make it through a 1 OK. Chal
lenge him to a race at zachz@stan
