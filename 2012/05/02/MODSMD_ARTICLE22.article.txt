## Card drops title game SEVEN-YEAR STREAK COMES TO AN END 
### SARAH MAISEL STAFF WRITER 
After seven straight seasons of
winning the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation conference
championship, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team found it
self in an unfamiliar position on
Sunday as Oregon claimed this
year's title. The Cardinal entered
the game riding a five-game win
streak, including Friday's 14-9
upset of second-seeded Denver to
open tournament play, but the
Card could not get past the
mighty Ducks offense, and it will
watch from home as Oregon ad
vances to the NCAA play-in
game against Navy.
Although Sunday's loss cer
tainly disappointed a team hoping
to make its third straight appear

ance in the NCAA tournament,
Friday's rout showed glimpses of
a team that has a strong founda
tion to build on for next season.
The Cardinal (8-10, 6-3 MPSF)
team that lost to Denver (12-3,6-
1) just a few weeks earlier looked
wildly different this team, and
Stanford showed why it is one of
the conference's top programs
year in and year out.
The first period against Den
ver started with the teams trading
goals, showing hints of a potential
slugfest to be determined in the
final minutes. But Stanford would
need no last-second goal to send
the Pioneers packing. After
watching its early three-goal lead
shrink to one, the Cardinal of
fense caught fire in the final four
minutes to score six times and
enter the break with a 10-3 lead.
The team easily outmaneuvered
any Denver defensive attempts
and capitalized on the Pioneers'
mistakes two Stanford goals
came from free position shots off

of Pioneer fouls.
Denver tried to change the
game's tempo following the break
and scored twice in the period's
first 10 minutes. But the offensive
efforts of seniors Emilie Boeri
and Catherine Swanson and
freshman Meredith Kalinowski
ensured there would be no Pio
neer rally, as the three combined
for Stanford's final four goals of
the game. Denver netted three
more scores, but it was not enough
to overcome the overall Cardinal
dominance.
Against Oregon (14-5, 9-0),
however, the Stanford offense
could not get going until the sec
ond period, and the team fell 13-
10. The Ducks led 8-3 at the break,
but a goal from freshman Emily
Newstrom and two from Emilie
Boeri cut the lead to two. This was
as close as the Cardinal would get,
as Oregon had answers for every
Stanford run. Sophomore Anna
Kim finished with a hat trick,
while Newstrom and Boeri had
two goals each in the loss.
Sunday was the final contest
for the team's four seniors: Maria
Fortino, Swanson, Boeri and her
sister, Anna Boeri. Emilie Boeri
finished the season with a team
high 40 goals, 23 assists and 83
shots. Swanson led the team in
ground balls and draw controls
and will leave a large hole in the
midfield. Both Emilie Boeri and
Swanson were named to the All-
MPSF First Team last week.
Anna Boeri, who also consistent
ly produced on offense, finished
second in assists (18) and fifth in
goals (21).
Despite a missed champi
onship, the weekend also showed
that the young team has much to
look forward to in the upcoming
season. Newstrom, Kalinowski
and fellow freshmen Hannah
Farr and Kyle Fraser combined
for a total of 11 goals in the two
games. Newstrom was second in
goals and shots this season, and
Farr joined Boeri and Swanson
on the All-MPSF First Team. Ad
ditionally, all three of the team's
All-MPSF Second Team hon
orees were sophomores: Anna
Kim, Lyndsey Munoz and Nina
Swanson.
