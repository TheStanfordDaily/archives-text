### â€” Jack Blanchat 
In the Pac-12 Women's Golf
Championships this past week
end, the Stanford women's golf
team struggled in the cold and
windy conditions in Washington
but rallied from a poor first round
to finish in seventh place and earn

an invite to the NCAA West Re
gional.
The Cardinal finished with a
team total of 900 (+36) for the
three-round tournament, 19
strokes behind conference cham
pion Cal, which secured a one
shot victory over USC at the
Palouse Ridge Golf Club in Pull
man, Wash.
On a day when only one play
er in the entire field broke par, a
poor first round left the Cardinal
in eleventh place after shooting a
team total of 320 (+32), but the
team rallied with an even-par 288
in the second round and a final
round total of 292 (+4) to end up
in seventh place.
Freshman Mariko Tumangan
and junior Sally Watson paced the
Cardinal, as both finished the
tournament tied for 12th place

with a score of 222 (+6). After a
first-round 83, Watson torched
the course over the next two
rounds, playing the final 36 holes
in 5-under-par. Tumangan and
Watson's finishes were strong
enough to earn each player hon
orable mention All-Pac-12 hon
ors.
Following the conclusion of the
Pac-12 season, the Cardinal
earned a berth in the NCAA West
Regional, which will be held at
Colorado National Golf Club in
Erie, Colo., from May 10-12. Stan
ford will be one of 22 teams in the
