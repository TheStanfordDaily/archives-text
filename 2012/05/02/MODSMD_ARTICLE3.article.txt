## Obama pivots policy toward Asia 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
China switched to a more aggressive "frown diplo
macy" with its South Asian neighbors in 2010 after
previously following a "smile diplomacy," according
to Donald K. Emmerson, director of the Southeast
Asia Forum at Stanford, who spoke Tuesday in Enci
na Hall.
Emmerson's talk focused particularly on the
South China Sea dispute between Asian nations and
commented on U.S. involvement in the conflict.
The presentation's title, "Obama's Pivot Toward
Asia: Implications, Repercussions, Complications,"
was inspired by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clin
ton's article in Foreign Affairs in 2009, in which she
urged the United States to invest diplomatically and

economically in Asia, declaring that the future of
world politics lies in the region.
"As the war in Iraq winds down and America be
gins to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan, the
United States stands at a pivot point," Clinton wrote.
Emmerson centered his talk on the idea of a
"pivot" toward Asia, a new approach he said has been
adopted by the Obama administration.
He cited several examples of this shift in focus, in
cluding Clinton's choice to make Asia the destination
for her first official trip abroad as secretary of state.
Quoting Clinton, who said "showing up is 50 per
cent," Emmerson said that he was "struck that when
Air Force One landed in Bali [for a 2010 summit], the
Indonesian journalists applauded. Obama won
tremendous kudos just for showing
up."
He also argued that even with a
greater emphasis on multilateral re
lations, the current administration
has intensified bilateral ties with
countries that are a part of the Asso
ciation of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN).
Emmerson warned, however,
that with a "dramatic crisis in the
Middle East" and a potential
change in administration next year,
there is a possibility that this "pivot"
might not be a permanent part of
U.S. policy.
"Part of the pivot idea I want to
emphasize is that it is unclear if fu
ture administrations will have the
same willingness to commit Ameri
ca to the same framework," he said.
Highlighting a key turning point,
Emmerson noted that "there was a
pivot within the pivot in the Hanoi
2010 meeting."
According to Emmerson, China
contacted each ASEAN country in
dividually prior to the meeting to
ask them to leave the string of is
lands in the South China Sea, in
volved in territorial disputes be
tween regional countries, off the
agenda. This decision enraged
ASEAN members.
At the meeting, however, Clin
ton called the South China Sea a
matter of "national interest" for the
United States, wanting to maintain
free shipping in the area. The move
deeply angered China, which retali
ated by explicitly claiming sover
eignty over the South China Sea.
This "display of muscular re
alpolitik-ism" on the part of the
Chinese was not well received by
ASEAN countries, Emmerson
said, and therefore gave the "pivot"
a tremendous boost.
"This pivot has provided
ASEAN with greater perceived
leverage towards China," he said.
According to Emmerson, one of
the least noticed outcomes of this

incident is that China has softened
its initial position that it would only
negotiate South China Sea disputes
bilaterally with ASEAN countries.
Emmerson stressed caution on
treating ASEAN as a bloc, stating
that each country has its own poli
cies and interests, although he did
say all are wary of China.
"Vietnam has a history of resist
ing China, and that history isn't
about to disappear," he said. "His
torically, Indonesia, too, has shown
suspicions or even downright ani
mosity towards China."
In addition to maritime issues,
Emmerson discussed security in the
region.
"One key question is to what ex
tent China can translate economic
might into a security presence," he
said. "Their ability to make this shift
has been limited and slow."
According to Emmerson, most
Southeast Asian countries are re
luctant to share intelligence or co
operate on security with China.
Another aspect of the dynamics
of the U.S.-China-Southeast Asia
triangle is economic diplomacy, ac
cording to Emmerson. He said a
free trade agreement between
China and ASEAN introduced in
the beginning of 2010 caused trade
to leap by 50 percent that year.
"Many in Southeast Asia go to
China for sales and go to Washing
ton for ships," he said, referring to
the presence of the U.S. Seventh
Fleet in the region.
He added that the United States
should be aware that domestic de
velopments in ASEAN countries
could affect political relations.
Emmerson ended his talk on a
diplomatic note, saying, "On bal
ance I would say that this pivot is
positive for the U.S. and for Asia."
Questions that followed the talk
covered a range of topics, from the
impact that succession in China next
year could have on diplomatic rela
tions to the legitimacy of China's
maritime claims in the region.
