# Preventing mental health crises
## RAs reflect on suicide response training; CAPS admins comment on protocol 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
This is the second in a four-part
series on crisis response and mental
health resources on campus.
Following the death of sopho
more student-athlete Sam Wopat
on March 25 and reports of several
attempted suicides on campus this
year. The Daily has undertaken a
survey of existing campus resources
and culture surrounding mental
health.
On Monday, The Daily took a
look at how the University responds
to mental health crises. Today's
piece examines Stanford's safety
net to prevent mental health crises.
Residential Education (ResEd)
plays a large role in this net from
resident assistants (RAs), to resi
dent fellows (RFs) and residence
deans (RDs).The University has an
RD on call to manage crises 24
hours a day, 365 days a year. Nearly
every RA interviewed expressed
satisfaction with the RA training
process and said that while one can
train for suicide risk reduction, it is
nearly impossible for students to
know what to expect and how to re
spond until they deal with a real at
tempt.
After exploring suicide risk re
duction training for RAs, The Daily
looked at Counseling and Psycho
logical Services (CAPS) and The
Bridge Peer Counseling Center
protocol for addressing students
who might be at risk of harming
themselves. CAPS and The Bridge
are each accessible to students via
phone 24 hours a day.
Finally, this piece ends with some
of the less obvious parts of the safe
ty net focusing on Undergradu

ate Advising and Research (UAR).

'Significant increase'
At least four Stanford students
have attempted suicide on campus
this school year, with at least one
case that of sophomore student
athlete Samantha 'Sam' Wopat
resulting in a student's death.
The Daily confirmed three in
stances of freshmen attempting sui
cide or making serious plans in
three separate Wilbur Hall resi
dences during this academic year.
The incidence of serious mental
health issues in Wilbur Hall has in
creased significantly this year, said
one Wilbur RA, who wished not to
specify her dorm within Wilbur to
protect the privacy of her residents.
The RA cited numerous conversa
tions with current student staffers,
former student staffers and admin
istrators in ResEd and UAR.
Wilbur RD John Giammalva de
clined to comment on whether
Wilbur has experienced an increase
in serious mental health issues this
year.
"I value my relationships with
students greatly, and it is important
to me that they know when we talk
about and are working through per
sonal issues, I will not make those
things public (even without using
names)," Giammalva wrote to The
Daily.

RA training
This year's group of RAs had
just over three hours of training on
issues related to mental health is
sues and suicide. According to
CAPS director Ron Albucher,
CAPS counselors led students in a
two hour Question, Persuade, Refer
(QPR) training session. The ses
sion included a presentation on
how to identify a student who
may have suicidal ideations and
instructed RAs on how to address
a student in crisis and refer them
to the appropriate authorities and
resources. The training session
also featured a video from a sui
cide survivor and a role-playing
segment at the end that allowed
RAs to practice asking someone
if they are entertaining thoughts
of suicide.
In addition, representatives
from CAPS and ResEd gave an
hour and fifteen minute presenta
tion on psychological distress. An
other presentation focused more
broadly on happiness, wellness
and mental health.
CAPS began offering Ques
tion, Persuade, Refer (QPR) sui
cide risk reduction training to
RAs and other ResEd staff, facul
ty, University staff and communi
ty members two years ago. Over
2,000 students, faculty and staff
have participated in QPR train
ing, according to CAPS.
According to the QPR Insti
tute website, trained 'gatekeep
ers' will learn to "recognize the
warning signs of suicide, know
how to offer hope, [and] know
how to get help and save a life."
Albucher said that RA feed
back about the program has been
"pretty positive."
"It's been really well received
people think it was valuable,
people felt like they were in a bet
ter position to know what ques
tions to ask, and to have some
practice," Albucher said, citing
feedback data.
Opinions on the quality of
training differ among RAs who
have dealt with suicide preven
tion or attempted suicide.
"I remember QPR being quite
helpful," wrote Suites RA Kiera
O'Rourke 'l3 to The Daily.
"I think that RA training for
suicide prevention is terrible,"
said RA Akshay Gopalan 'l2,
who is also a counselor at the
Bridge Peer Counselor Center.
"The way that the course is taught
during RA training leaves a lot to
be desired."
While Gopalan said learning
how to ask the questions is useful,
he also said that other RAs who
have had to deal with attempted
suicides in their dorms have had a
harder time than they expected.
Gopalan said he does not

blame RAs for having difficulty.
"RAs are capable, but I don't
think they're being trained well
enough to handle stuff like [at
tempted suicide]," Gopalan said.
O'Rourke said practicing skills
in class is different than putting
them to use in person.
"It's one thing practicing role
play and another having to deal
with the issue, especially once it
has already happened," she said.
"Maybe some attention can be
given to that as well."
Gopalan said that RAs were
given 10 to 15 minutes to practice
the skills they learn from the
video, which he said is not enough
time to determine if someone is
suicidal. He reported spending six
hours in a Bridge practice call
while training to be a counselor
there, and it took three hours for
any signs of suicidal behavior to
develop from his practice counse
lee.
According to Albucher, the
University tries to strike a bal
ance in preparing students for
various situations without over
whelming them with information.
Dean of ResEd Deborah
Golder described a culminating
: segment of RA training called
"Oh, The Places You'll Go," in
which students are given the
chance to practice responding to
various crisis situations.
RAs in Suites and Wilbur said
they found the simulations deal
ing with issues like schizophrenia,
homophobia and sexual assault
useful, but commented that none
of the simulations in their training
focused on suicide.
"Because the simulations were
so realistic, I feel like if we had
one about attempted suicide, it
would have been helpful,"
O'Rourke said.
; Alej andro Martinez, senior as
sociate director of CAPS, who
manages the QPR training feed
i back, also said that student recep
tion was mostly positive, but said
he has also heard that students
think more practice time would
i be valuable.
"It is valued, it is helpful, it is
useful," Martinez said partici
pants reported, saying trainees
most appreciated the opportunity
: to practice the skills they learn.
Martinez, who is also an in
structor for the peer counseling
i courses that prepare students to
work at The Bridge, said he
; agreed with Gopalan's feedback
that practice is key to training,
i "You can't just talk about it,
I you have to have the opportunity
i to actually practice," Martinez
said.
; "We want to do more," he

added. Martinez said that the
Bridge class offers "much more
intensive training" than RAs re
ceive.
"We provide the didactic ma
terial and we have sections where
students have a much more in
tense opportunity to talk," Mar
tinez said.
The Bridge and crises
Gopalan said that while
Bridge counseling sessions are
usually driven by the counselee,
The Bridge takes a more directive
approach in a suicide-type coun
sel, in which they list instructions
for the counselor to follow.
"We assess level of risk on a
qualitative scale. [Our] response
to that varies from 'Let's call the
24 hour CAPS number right now'
that's on the lower end [of the]
scale," Gopalan said. "On the
higher risk scale, [we say] 'Where
are you? Tell me where you are,'
as far as 'I will come over to take
you to the hospital,' or 'Will you
let me call the ambulance for
you?"'
Gopalan said that Bridge
counselors have gone directly to
residences and waited until am
bulances have arrived.
Before this step, Gopalan said,
counselors get as much informa
tion as they can if not a name,
then whether the caller is an un
dergraduate or graduate, what de
partment the caller works in
any identifying information to
give to authorities.
The Bridge, which has four
live-in counselors, works in two
person teams to respond to stu
dents at risk, Gopalan said.
"The minute we get a crisis call,
we call down someone from up
stairs," he said, adding that the sec
ond counselor contacts CAPS im
mediately and 911, if necessary.
"It's pretty comprehensive,
and it works," Gopalan said.
"We've had very good success
multiple times."
Gopalan said this year has seen
a relatively low number of suicide
related calls. He added that it is
difficult to quantify the number of
these calls. Overall, calls to the
Bridge have increased in recent
months.
CAPS and potential crises
CAPS also uses a team-based
approach for phone calls to assess
whether a student is at immediate
risk and to simultaneously contact
authorities like RDs or the police.
RDs are particularly useful be
cause they have exclusive access
to information on past incidents,
as well as master keys to resi
dences.

Albucher described CAPS
protocol for assessing whether a
student that is called in or calls the
24 hour CAPS hotline himself is
at-risk of suicide. Albucher said
this response is tailored to the in
dividual situation.
"The scenario could play out in
many different ways," Albucher
said. "It's hard to give a set re
sponse."
Albucher said that if CAPS can
speak to the student directly, on
call counselors will get informa
tion about what kinds of thoughts,
plans and steps the student has
taken to harm himself. On-call
counselors will also look into prior
history of attempts and mental
health concerns, learn about sub
stance use and medical problems,
and ask how the student is going
to keep himself safe.
If the counselor determines
that the student requires hospital
ization, Albucher said, he or she
will discuss with the student why
such a move makes sense and will
get the on-call RD involved, con
tact the Stanford Police to provide
the escort into the hospital, and
call ahead to the hospital to alert
the psychiatry resident on call
who will evaluate the student.
During the clinical evaluation,
Albucher said, counselors pose a
series of questions to determine
whether a student has thought his
or her actions through, whether
the student intended to take his
own life or whether he meant to
distract himself from other forms
of pain or suffering.
Once the crisis is over, the hos
pital may discharge the student to
an outpatient center or to CAPS.
Golder said that for ResEd, de
ciding whether a student's actions
constituted a suicide attempt is
dangerous, citing the need to help
students regardless of cause or in
tention.
"If anything is showing up
where someone could be harm
ing themselves we're going to try
to get them the appropriate help
they need," Golder said.
Dean of Student Affairs Chris
Griffith remarked that when at
tempted suicides do occur, the
University crafts long term re
sponses individually, saying that
some options include voluntary
and involuntary leaves of ab
sence.
"Decisions about leave for a
student who attempts suicide are
complicated and require us to re
view the student's circumstances
from a broader perspective in
cluding the continued safety of the
student and the impact on others
in the community," Griffith wrote
in an email to The Daily. "It is im

portant to remember that every
student's circumstances are differ
ent that is why the individual
ized assessment is so critical."

The wider net
For depressed or struggling
students who have not reached
the point of attempting suicide,
several administrators described a
safety net in which departments
across the University from res
ident assistants and resident deans
to Undergraduate Advising and
Research (UAR) and CAPS. Stu
dent residential staff members
who spoke with The Daily said
that the safety net works.
"Students may not be aware of
how many people are looking out
for them and caring for them,"
said Koren Bakkegard, associate
director of UAR.
Bakkegard and Golder said
that faculty and staff frequently
report potentially troubled stu
dents.
"It's really common for us to
get a call from an IHUM fellow,
saying, 'Someone doesn't quite
seem themselves in section late
ly,"' Bakkegard said.
"It might be a custodian in a
residence hall, it might be some
one who's at the dining hall, notic
ing someone's eating pattern
changing," Golder said.
Bakkegard said that UAR asks
residence deans and resident fel
lows to check on students through
RAs.
"We follow up on every lead
that we get that there might be
something that is not quite right
with a student," she said.
A former freshman RA cur
rently staffing in an upperclass
house confirmed this system, say
ing she had once been asked by an
IHUM teaching assistant to check
up on a student who had not been
to section regularly.
The RA added that in addition
to University faculty and staff
"flagging" students, RAs in differ
ent dorms and houses communi
cate with one another.
"Both as a freshman RA and
an upperclass RA, it is not uncom
mon for me to get calls from other
RAs with concerns about one of
my residents," she said. "Often a
student will go to their RA with a
concern about their friend in an
other dorm and that RA will con
tact the RA of the friend."

This was the second in a four-part
series on crisis response and men
tal health resources on campus.
Part three will explore broader
mental health issues on campus
and highlight student experiences
with campus services.
