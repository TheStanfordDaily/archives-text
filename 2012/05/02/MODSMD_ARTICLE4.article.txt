# Preventing mental health crises
## RAs reflect on suicide response training; CAPS admins comment on protocol 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
This is the second in a four-part
series on crisis response and mental
health resources on campus.
Following the death of sopho
more student-athlete Sam Wopat
on March 25 and reports of several
attempted suicides on campus this
year. The Daily has undertaken a
survey of existing campus resources
and culture surrounding mental
health.
On Monday, The Daily took a
look at how the University responds
to mental health crises. Today's
piece examines Stanford's safety
net to prevent mental health crises.
Residential Education (ResEd)
plays a large role in this net from
resident assistants (RAs), to resi
dent fellows (RFs) and residence
deans (RDs).The University has an
RD on call to manage crises 24
hours a day, 365 days a year. Nearly
every RA interviewed expressed
satisfaction with the RA training
process and said that while one can
train for suicide risk reduction, it is
nearly impossible for students to
know what to expect and how to re
spond until they deal with a real at
tempt.
After exploring suicide risk re
duction training for RAs, The Daily
looked at Counseling and Psycho
logical Services (CAPS) and The
Bridge Peer Counseling Center
protocol for addressing students
who might be at risk of harming
themselves. CAPS and The Bridge
are each accessible to students via
phone 24 hours a day.
Finally, this piece ends with some
of the less obvious parts of the safe
ty net focusing on Undergradu

ate Advising and Research (UAR).

'Significant increase'
At least four Stanford students
have attempted suicide on campus
this school year, with at least one
case that of sophomore student
athlete Samantha 'Sam' Wopat
resulting in a student's death.
The Daily confirmed three in
stances of freshmen attempting sui
cide or making serious plans in
three separate Wilbur Hall resi
dences during this academic year.
The incidence of serious mental
health issues in Wilbur Hall has in
creased significantly this year, said
one Wilbur RA, who wished not to
specify her dorm within Wilbur to
protect the privacy of her residents.
The RA cited numerous conversa
tions with current student staffers,
former student staffers and admin
istrators in ResEd and UAR.
Wilbur RD John Giammalva de
clined to comment on whether
Wilbur has experienced an increase
in serious mental health issues this
year.
"I value my relationships with
students greatly, and it is important
to me that they know when we talk
about and are working through per
sonal issues, I will not make those
things public (even without using
names)," Giammalva wrote to The
Daily.

RA training
This year's group of RAs had
just over three hours of training on
issues related to mental health is
sues and suicide. According to
CAPS director Ron Albucher,
CAPS counselors led students in a
two hour Question, Persuade, Refer
