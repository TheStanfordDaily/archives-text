## Panelists discuss egg donor risks Documentary attempts to dissuade potential donors 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER DESK EDITOR 
No financial compensation is
enough to make up for the poten
tial long-term health consequences
of egg donation, argued Judy Nor
sigian, executive director of Our
Bodies Ourselves, a nonprofit or
ganization dedicated to women's
health education, at a Tuesday
event exploring the controversial
topic.
Norsigian said that if a woman
ever asked her whether or not she
should go through with donating
her eggs, she would say, "Don't do
it."
This was a message repeated
multiple times Tuesday night at the
Bechtel International Center dur
ing a panel discussion following a
screening of the film "Eggsploita
tion." The film, which won Best
Documentary at the 13th Annual
California Independent Film Festi
val in 2011, aims to show the risks of
commercial human egg harvesting
for young women in the United
States.
Fellow panelist and associate
professor in anthropology
Lochlann Jain emphasized the
"medical and legal issues and the
social dimension" of egg donating,
arguing that the risks still need to
be clarified for potential donors.
Given the hormone treatments
required for egg harvesting and
possible links with cancer, Jain said
it is surprising that there "is no pro
tocol of how to deal with subse
quent injuries or problems." She
added that there is a lack of data
collection regarding this issue, and
discussion of the topic has a high
"political valence."
Norsigian agreed that the long
term effects of egg harvesting are
"uncertain, with better tracking
needed." She said she finds it trou
bling that the Food and Drug Ad
ministration does not have person
nel examining the problems re
ported by women after drug usage
for egg stimulation.
The film was written and pro
duced by Jennifer Lahl, president
of the Center for Bioethics and
Culture Network (CBC). Lahl was
previously a nurse. The CBC Net
work is a Northern California non
profit that explores bioethics.
According to the CBC Net
work's website, California, Massa
chusetts, Connecticut, Maryland
and Arizona prohibit compensa
tion for egg harvesting for re
search. These states, however, are
silent on payments for in vitro fer

tilization (IVF) egg harvesting.
Arizona was the first state to enact
a law requiring certain require
ments, such as informed consent
health warnings, for IVF harvest
ing.
Egg harvesting, Norsigian said,
"shouldn't be done multiple times
in a year," and there should cer
tainly be at least a six-month gap.
The film showed pictures of a
former Stanford student, Jessica
Wing, a repeated egg donor, who
died at age 32. Wing's mother, Dr.
Jennifer Schneider, said in the doc
umentary that a follow-up on egg
donors should be implemented for
health reasons, as well as for estab
lishing a genetic registry for donor
offspring.
The film showed testimonials of
young women, including another
from Stanford, who experienced
health complications after under
going egg harvesting.
Norsigian noted that if you visit
"any campus in the U.S. you'll see
ads suggesting that you'd bring
happiness" to others by offering
eggs. Many women receive adver
tisements via Facebook, she added.
Audience members suggested
adding warnings to egg donation
advertisements, in a method simi
lar to that used in cigarette ads, ar
guing that at the very least adver
tisements should note that the pro
cedure is not without risks.
Panelists highlighted shortcom
ings of California legislation on the

topic. Former Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger signed AB 1317
into law in 2009, requiring egg
donor ads to reference the exis
tence of medical risks. However,
panelists said the legislation is not
easily enforceable and has exemp
tions.
Presenters said they were con
cerned that the mainstream media
does not accurately portray the
health consequences of egg extrac
tion. All the speakers were
alarmed by the lack of peer-re
viewed analyses regarding health
risks of the commercial activity.
Norsigian pointed out that
"lack of evidence of harm is not
proof of safety."
Audience member Maijorie
Murphy Campbell, a blogger who
frequently attends Stanford events
at the Clayman Institute and the
Hoover Institution, asked, "Are we
making guinea pigs out of young
women?"
Norsigian agreed with the sug
gestion.
Stanford students formed
about a quarter of the audience,
with women from San Francisco
and the surrounding areas packing
the rest of the conference room.
Sponsors of the event included
Stanford's Office of Diversity and
Leadership and the Women's
Community Center.

guing that at the very least adver
tisements should note that the pro
cedure is not without risks.
Panelists highlighted shortcom
ings of California legislation on the

topic. Former Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger signed AB 1317
into law in 2009, requiring egg
donor ads to reference the exis
tence of medical risks. However,
panelists said the legislation is not
easily enforceable and has exemp
tions.
Presenters said they were con
cerned that the mainstream media
does not accurately portray the
health consequences of egg extrac
tion. All the speakers were
alarmed by the lack of peer-re
viewed analyses regarding health
risks of the commercial activity.
Norsigian pointed out that
"lack of evidence of harm is not
proof of safety."
Audience member Maijorie
Murphy Campbell, a blogger who
frequently attends Stanford events
at the Clayman Institute and the
Hoover Institution, asked, "Are we
making guinea pigs out of young
women?"
Norsigian agreed with the sug
gestion.
Stanford students formed
about a quarter of the audience,
with women from San Francisco
and the surrounding areas packing
the rest of the conference room.
Sponsors of the event included
Stanford's Office of Diversity and
Leadership and the Women's
Community Center.

No financial compensation is
enough to make up for the poten
tial long-term health consequences
of egg donation, argued Judy Nor
sigian, executive director of Our
Bodies Ourselves, a nonprofit or
ganization dedicated to women's
health education, at a Tuesday
event exploring the controversial
topic.
Norsigian said that if a woman
ever asked her whether or not she
should go through with donating
her eggs, she would say, "Don't do
it."
This was a message repeated
multiple times Tuesday night at the
Bechtel International Center dur
ing a panel discussion following a
screening of the film "Eggsploita
tion." The film, which won Best
Documentary at the 13th Annual
California Independent Film Festi
val in 2011, aims to show the risks of
commercial human egg harvesting
for young women in the United
States.
Fellow panelist and associate
professor in anthropology
Lochlann Jain emphasized the
"medical and legal issues and the
social dimension" of egg donating,
arguing that the risks still need to
be clarified for potential donors.
Given the hormone treatments
required for egg harvesting and
possible links with cancer, Jain said
it is surprising that there "is no pro
tocol of how to deal with subse
quent injuries or problems." She
added that there is a lack of data
collection regarding this issue, and
discussion of the topic has a high
"political valence."
Norsigian agreed that the long
term effects of egg harvesting are
"uncertain, with better tracking
needed." She said she finds it trou
bling that the Food and Drug Ad
ministration does not have person
nel examining the problems re
ported by women after drug usage
for egg stimulation.
The film was written and pro
duced by Jennifer Lahl, president
of the Center for Bioethics and
Culture Network (CBC). Lahl was
previously a nurse. The CBC Net
work is a Northern California non
profit that explores bioethics.
According to the CBC Net
work's website, California, Massa
chusetts, Connecticut, Maryland
and Arizona prohibit compensa
tion for egg harvesting for re
search. These states, however, are
silent on payments for in vitro fer

tilization (IVF) egg harvesting.
Arizona was the first state to enact
a law requiring certain require
ments, such as informed consent
health warnings, for IVF harvest
ing.
Egg harvesting, Norsigian said,
"shouldn't be done multiple times
in a year," and there should cer
tainly be at least a six-month gap.
The film showed pictures of a
former Stanford student, Jessica
Wing, a repeated egg donor, who
died at age 32. Wing's mother, Dr.
Jennifer Schneider, said in the doc
umentary that a follow-up on egg
donors should be implemented for
health reasons, as well as for estab
lishing a genetic registry for donor
offspring.
The film showed testimonials of
young women, including another
from Stanford, who experienced
health complications after under
going egg harvesting.
Norsigian noted that if you visit
"any campus in the U.S. you'll see
ads suggesting that you'd bring
happiness" to others by offering
eggs. Many women receive adver
tisements via Facebook, she added.
Audience members suggested
adding warnings to egg donation
advertisements, in a method simi
lar to that used in cigarette ads, ar
guing that at the very least adver
tisements should note that the pro
cedure is not without risks.
