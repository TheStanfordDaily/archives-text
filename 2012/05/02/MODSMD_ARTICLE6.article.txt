## New Senate takes office, elects chair 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The 13th Undergraduate Senate held
its last meeting Tuesday night, followed im
mediately by a meeting of the newly con
firmed 14th Undergraduate Senate, After
electing a new chair and deputy chair, the
newly elected Senate's first order of busi
ness was to unanimously approve $l,OOO in
discretionary spending for the legislative
body's retreat.
Before ceding their seats, the members
of the 13th Undergraduate Senate revised
and approved next year's ASSU budget.
Senators eliminated stipends for the Sen
ate chair, deputy chair and appropriations
chair $3,000, $l,OOO and $2,000, respec
tively and instead opted to allot each
senator a $4OO stipend for their service to
the student body.
The senators also rejected a 33 percent
pay increase for the webmaster of the
Graduate Student Council (GSC), a
change that the only present GSC repre
sentative, Sjoerd de Ridder, said he could
not defend.

The senators debated the section of the

budget reserved for Executive stipends.
Several senators expressed concern that
cabinet members are overpaid, especially
considering their compensation relative to
that of senators, which was nothing this
year.
"Thirty thousand dollars are being
spent on Executive discretionary; $34,000
are being spent on stipends. When people
outside of the ASSU hear these numbers,
they are shocked and ... [think we are]
using all of the money for stipends," said
Senator Janani Ramachandran 'l4.
"They're not elected positions like we are
[as] senators . . . When we're spending
$34,000 which is more than the amount
of discretionary we're giving toward the
Executive I think that's a problem."
Incoming ASSU Vice President
William Wagstaff 'l2 announced that next
year's Executive is aiming to have five to
10 cabinet members.
"Something that me and Robbie have
been talking about is general downsizing,"
Wagstaff said. As a result of those plans,
Wagstaff motioned to cut Executive cabi-

outgoing Senate approved the ASSU fiscal budget for the upcoming academic year.
net stipends from $14,000 to
$7,000 and moved $3,500 apiece
to the Executive discretionary
and to the Executive traditions
fund, with the hopes of potential
ly financing buses to Big Game
next year.
Dan DeLong 'l3 expressed
disappointment that the Senate
had not discussed the issue of Ex
ecutive stipends prior to its final
meeting, saying that the issues of
incentive to serve on the ASSU,
reward for doing the job diligent
ly and accountability toward the
Association deserve more scruti
ny and discussion. Both DeLong
and Ramachandran encouraged
next year's Senate to look into the
question more thoroughly.
After being sworn in, the 14th
Undergraduate Senate nominat
ed and approved Branden
Crouch 'l4 as the Senate chair
and Garima Sharma 'l5 as deputy
chair. The new Senate also unani
mously approved a motion to
move the $l,OOO remaining from
the previous Senate's discre
tionary funds to finance its up
coming retreat. In comparison,
volunteer student organizations
(VSOs) are allowed to allot up to
$l5O to retreats, according to cur
rent joint special fees funding
policies.
Alternative Review Process
The 13th Undergraduate Sen
ate deferred judgment on the Al
ternative Review Process (ARP),
a judicial procedure developed
for cases involving sexual assault,
relationship violence, sexual ha
rassment and stalking. The 14th
Undergraduate Senate will thus
consider approval of the ARP
and potential revision next week
in its first full-length meeting.
Several students not affiliated
with the Senate attended the
meeting to discuss central points
of conflict in the ARP's provi
sions.
Mona Thompson 'l3, who
wrote an op-ed for The Daily on
the ARP, strongly encouraged the
incoming senators to speak with
the figures on campus, such as
Jamie Pontius-Hogan, assistant
dean of the Office of Judicial Af
fairs, who are most knowledge
able about the procedure and its
advantages and disadvantages.
Thompson expressed support for
several of the existing ARP provi
sions, citing statistics on the num
ber of cases heard since the
ARP's inception as evidence of

its success in making the proce
dure less intimidating for victims.
"Everything in judicial affairs
is not unanimous," Thompson re
sponded to a question about the
possibility of unanimity. "I think
that by making sexual assault [re
quire] unanimity], we would be
giving it this really weird special
treatment... an extra obstacle to
overcome for probably what I
would argue is one of the most
delicate and sensitive processes."
The senators also heard from
Law School student Elliott Wolf,
who served as student body pres
ident at Duke University in the
2006-2007 academic year, in the
immediate aftermath of the 2006
Duke lacrosse scandal.
"Whittling away procedural
protections will have unforesee
able, unintended consequences,"
Wolf warned senators. He spoke
of widespread abuse of power by
police, University officials and ju
dicial staff because of a lack of
protection by Duke University's
judicial code, which resulted in
faculty refusing to report student
misconduct, disregard and mis
treatment of student rights, all-en
compassing mistrust and six years
and counting of ongoing lit
igation against the university.
In addition to discussing
whether to require unanimity, the
senators also discussed the size of
review panels, the lack of an obli
gation for a panel to hear the wit
nesses called by a responding stu
dent, the unitary appellate juris
diction of the Vice Provost, the
admission of past sexual history
as evidence in hearing, the discre
tion of an investigator in deter
mining relevancy and the legal
obligation to abide by the Dear
Colleague Letter of the Office for
Civil Rights in relation to the ex
isting ARP.
The 13th Undergraduate Sen
ate concluded with a series of
straw poll votes on several of the
potential revisions or concerns
with the ARP. Each straw poll
heavily favored the ARP as it
stands, with four-person panels, a
preponderance of evidence bur
den of proof and a majority re
quirement for a responsible find
ing. The only revisions that re
ceived more than two votes in op
position were a unanimous re
quirement (three votes in favor of
unanimous, nine in favor of ma
jority and three abstentions) and
the statute of limitations (four
votes in favor of a one-year
statute, nine for the status quo
two-year statute and two absten
tions).
