## Stanford experts wary of rail project 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
Stanford experts remain wary of the latest re
vision of the California High-Speed Rail pro
ject's business plan and disagree over California
State Legislative Analyst (LAO) Mac Taylor's
recommendations to withhold state funding to
the project.
According to a press release on the high
speed rail project website, the new business plan,
released last month, calls for a reduced budget
cost of $68.4 billion from voter-approved state
bonds, federal funding grants, local funding and
public-private partnership. Taylor suggests with
holding state funding of construction while al
lowing for minimal funding for more planning
Gregory Rosston, senior research scholar at
the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Re
search (SIEPR), said that even with the latest re
vision to the business plan, the state budget is still
not in the right shape to undertake such an ex
pensive project.
"We've had serious issues with the state budg
et for a long time, and we have a big state debt, so
my concern is how this will impact the long-term
health of the state," Rosston said.
According to Rosston, there are other major
concerns within the state budget that are not
being addressed in any business plans and re
quire more immediate attention. He cited liabil
ities for retired state employees, pensions and
healthcare benefits.
Alain Enthoven, professor emeritus of public
and private management, who has closely fol
lowed the project since its inception, suggested
ending the project altogether and focusing atten
tion on education reform.
"We are drastically, dangerously cutting back
on education, which is so important for our fu
ture and for the future of our children and our
young people," Enthoven said.
Rosston, unlike Enthoven, agrees with a re
cent recommendation by California State Leg
islative Analyst (LAO) Mac Taylor, which would
not fund construction, but a minimal amount for
planning efforts.
"I think planning is really im
portant to try to understand what
is the magnitude of the issue be
cause it's quite possible that you
could have projects that are very
worthwhile in the long term,"
Rosston said.
He added that if the train
could be built at a low cost to the
state, then it could relieve the
problem of traffic congestion and
potentially provide the increase
in jobs and businesses that the
project now promises.
"The nirvana scenario would
be you could invest in this and not
only not cost very much money,
but it would increase the attrac
tiveness of the state of California
because there's less congestion
and because people like living
there more, and it becomes more
attractive for businesses," he said.
Rosston, however, questioned
the main argument of the pro
ject's advocates, which he said is
to "have faith" that the promised
benefits will come. He said that
supporters have yet to provide an
accurate estimate of the total cost
and projected revenue, which is
why the project has not received
full approval.
"Any construction project, if
you even ask anyone who has
ever tried to construct a single
family home, the estimates are
not very good and those are
things that get done every day,"
Rosston said. "Whereas building
a high-speed rail system, those
don't get done very often."
"You might be able to look at
Spain, France or China and see
what did it cost them," he added.
"Those cost estimates are going
to be somewhat applicable to
California, but they're going to
be very different."
For Enthoven, the lack of
grounded estimates causes him
to be dubious of the project as a

whole.
"There's a lot in their so-called
plans that I think are dishonest
misrepresentations of likely facts,
so all together I think the best
thing would be to kill it," En
thoven said.
According to Enthoven, the
projected 100,000 construction
jobs and long-term employment
opportunities are not convincing
arguments. He said to provide
such an effect, there would need
to be too great of an increase in
taxes.
"I don't know when the break
ing point will come, but already
taxes in California are discourag
ing a lot of business from coming
here," Enthoven said. "There are
plenty of worthy good things we
could spend money on now that
would put those people back to
work."
Both Enthoven and Rosston
agreed that the greatest risk be

hind the project is that the in
crease in taxes proposed by Gov.
Jerry Brown, a vocal advocate of
the project, will discourage busi
nesses from coming to California,
which in turn will further hurt the
state budget.
Both experts also said that
that the project is currently being
led more by political concerns
than by economic strategies. They
added that the project is diverting
attention from more pressing
concerns, including education.
"I think Jerry Brown seems to
be kind of a visionary who wants
to leave a great legacy as his fa
ther did," Enthoven said. "Well,
his father left a great legacy with
the University of California, and
Brown ought to know that the
thing to do is to beef up the Uni
versity of California."
