## Universities need affirmative action, study says 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
Universities need affirmative ac
tion in order to make meritocratic
decisions, according to a new study
by Stanford Psychology Professor
Gregory Walton.
The study, which is currently
scheduled for publication in the jour
nal Social Issues and Policy Review,
argues that affirmative action not only
creates a diverse student body, but also
ensures the selection of the most qual
ified candidates during the college ad
mission process.
Walton along with his co-au
thors Steven Spencer, a professor at
the University of Waterloo, and Sam
Erman, a professor at Harvard Uni
versity will provide expert testi
mony at the upcoming Supreme
Court case Fisher v. University of
Texas, which is slated to be heard at
the earliest this fall.

The case is being brought by Abi
gail Fisher, a white student who
claims she was denied acceptance to
the University of Texas because of
her race.
This will be the first time that the
Supreme Court has taken up the
issue of affirmative action since al
most a decade ago. In 2003, the
Court ruled 5-4 to uphold the prac
tice at the University of Michigan
Law School in the case Grutter v.
Bollinger.
Writing the majority opinion in
2003, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
'5O J.D. '52 said the Court endorsed
the view that "student body diversi
ty is a compelling state interest that
can justify using race in university
admissions."
The new study, however, at
tempts to put forth a separate argu
ment in support of affirmative ac
tion, in addition to the value of di
versity.
According to the study, while
people tend to view grades and stan
dardized test scores as "meritocratic
and thus as fair and just," they are ac
tually "systematically biased along
important social dimensions such as

by race and gender."
"These circumstances arise be
cause common measures of aca
demic performance systematically
underestimate the intellectual abili
ty and potential of members of neg
atively stereotyped groups," the
study reads. "This bias results not
from the content of performance
measures, but from common con
texts in which performance meas
ures are assessed from psycho
logical threats like stereotype threat
that are pervasive in academic set
tings."
Walton discussed the study in a
recent interview with the Stanford
Report.
"When people perform in stan
dard school settings, they are often
aware of negative stereotypes about
their group," Walton said. "Those
stereotypes act like a psychological
headwind they cause people to
perform worse."
"If you base your evaluation of
candidates just on performance in
settings that are biased," he added,
"you end up discriminating."
