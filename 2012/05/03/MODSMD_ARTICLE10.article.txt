## SEEING GREEN Business clusters and the transportation squeeze 
### Holly Moeller 
ST. HELENA, CA. It's a fine
Saturday, and the traffic lines
up on Highway 29 as the day's
crop of tourists meander from vine
yard to vineyard along the road that
bisects Napa Valley.
By year's end, 4.5 million people
will have passed through, sampling
vintages from the state that grows 92
percent of the nation's grapes and
supplies 60 percent of its wine. More
than 200 million cases of California
wine are sold within the United
States each year; a further 250 mil
lion find their homes abroad. Cali
fornia is the world's fourth largest
wine exporter after Italy, France,
and Spain.
And Napa Valley is at the heart
of it all.
The 30-mile-long valley holds
what economists term a "business
cluster" a local clump of buyers,
suppliers and complementary busi
nesses that share a common indus
try (in this case, winemaking).
Napa's soils and climate (the so
called "terroir" which defines a re
gion's vineyard potential) first es
tablished its winemaking creden
tials, but as its reputation grew, vint
ners and retailers alike flocked to
the region.
By concentrating their financial
capital and expertise within the re
gion, wine industry members drove
innovation, stimulated competition
and opened the doors for new busi
nesses. Their collective efforts at
tracted international attention,
more visitors and more investment:
They put Napa Valley on an interna
tional map.
Napa is just one of dozens of
business clusters around the world
Silicon Valley is another example
even closer to home.
Grounded in a special environ
ment, a local knowledge base or in
expensive labor, business clusters
thrive in a globalized economy.
Goods and services produced with
the cluster's particular efficiency or
panache can be relayed anywhere
on the planet within the span of min
utes, hours or days.
Because the global economy
connects multiple supply-and-de
mand points, it winnows the market
down to the most cost-effective pro
ducers, often with marked gains in
efficiency. For example, by growing
crops on farmland matched to their
needs and then shipping those crops
abroad to meet market demand
(rather than forcibly growing them
on dry, but local, sites), we save 100
trillion gallons of water globally.
When economic efficiency pro
duces environmental opportunity,
it's tempting to think only of global
ization's win-win aspects. In reality,
however, by focusing on the out-

comes at the endpoints mon
soon-watered jasmine rice paddies
in Thailand; the canvas bag of pearly
grains at my parents' home in New
Jersey —we often forget about
what "happens in between.
Unfortunately, that in-between
part is going to demand our atten
tion.
Globally, a quarter of our carbon
dioxide emissions (and a third of the
United States' emissions) come
from the transportation sector.
Some of that comes from cars, buses
and commercial airliners. But the
rest comes from shipping wine,
pineapples, computer parts and all
sorts of things from business center
to strip mall.
Climate change aside, the re
liance of shipping on fossil fuels is in
herently unsustainable. Regardless
of which supply estimates you be
lieve, fossil fuel resources are finite.
If we don't notice shortages in our
lifetimes and we probably will
then our children certainly will.
Rising fuel prices are the first
signs of dwindling supplies. When
energy costs go up, so too will the
costs of producing, packaging and,
especially, shipping that Napa
grown bottle of wine. Already, wine
makers are shipping wine in "flexi
tanks" —shipping container-sized
"bag in a box" setups —to save
transport costs of weighty glass bot
tles. Should oil prices skyrocket,
we'll quickly learn exactly how far
every item in the supermarket trav
els.
Most frightening to me is the
knowledge that transportation will
be one of the hardest things to fuel
with renewable energy sources.
High energy-density hydrocarbons
like gas and jet fuel are perfect for
cars and airplanes: They carry a
long-distance punch without pack
ing on the weight. We'll need some
big advances in battery technology
to recapitulate those efficiencies in

trans-oceanic flights.
As energy supplies shrink, so
will our economic horizons. We'll
look to homegrown suppliers of
food, wine and commodities, simul
taneously making both more eco
nomical and more sustainable
choices.
I can think of a few vintages
and flavors that I'll be missing.
But I can also think of one friend, in
particular, who might even be a lit
tle grateful. During our travels in
New Zealand, I relied on Kathrin
to know the best local ice creamery,
find the freshest pastries and pull
over at the en route salmon farm.
Citizen of the world though she is,
she's also a very local connoisseur.
"It's almost a shame," she would
say, of finding a favorite Argentin
ian wine or real German chocolate
in the supermarket. "There should
always be something that makes
actually going to a place special."
