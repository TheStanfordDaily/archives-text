## University statement on Chi Theta Chi lease discussions 
### GREG BOARDMAN Vice Provost for Student Affairs SHIRLEY EVERETT Senior Associate Vice Provost for Residential Dining Enterprises 
Stanford University and the
Chi Theta Chi Alumni Board
have been actively engaged in
a dialogue regarding the status of
the Chi Theta Chi house at 576 Al
varado Row. The University has
listened to the concerns of students
and alumni and has decided to
enter into a re-structured agree
ment with Chi Theta Chi alumni
organization that will govern the
house for a minimum of two years.
The University has exercised
its option not to renew the current
lease for the house, effective Sep
tember 1,2012, at which time the
University will have legal owner
ship of the house, collect student
funds for housing, and pay for re
pairs; however, the alumni organ
ization will continue to be respon
sible for the ongoing management
and oversight of the residential
program, food/board provision,
and student staffing. This arrange
ment allows the Chi Theta Chi
alumni organization to demon
strate that it is qualified to take
over and sustain management of
the house once the University has
confidence that the alumni organ
ization will maintain a reliably
safe, healthy and productive edu
cational experience and living en
vironment for Stanford under
graduates.
Stanford University has a long
standing commitment to inde
pendent houses and sees them as
a vital and important piece of the
rich cultural fabric of the under
graduate experience. This does
not preclude the University from
having expectations for these

communities. Chi Theta Chi is in
deed a special place, as is evi
denced by the passionate commit
ment of its residents and alumni.
Our ideal is for Chi Theta Chi to
regain its independence while
also meeting or exceeding our
shared expectations. Specific ex
pectations and details of this
arrangement are still being
worked out.
Our expectation is that the
alumni organization of Chi Theta
Chi will take the next two to three
years to demonstrate the sus
tained ability to manage house
staffing, establish corporate self
governance, and create an effec
tive partnership with the Univer
sity that will ensure the house is
operated with a commitment to
life safety and University commu
nity values.
