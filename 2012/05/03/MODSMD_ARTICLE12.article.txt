# Why it matters that 70 state parks are closing
## 
### JUDEE BURR'12 Vice President of Outreach, Students for a Sustainable Stanford SHARON TAN'14 Outreach Coordinator, Students for a Sustainable Stanford 
As you've strolled in and out
of the CoHo for the past
few weeks, have you no
ticed the colorful array of nature
themed photos on the walls? As
part of our campaign to raise
awareness of the imminent clo
sure of state parks in California,
Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford organized a State Parks
Photo Contest. We've printed and
displayed the stunning images
and equally moving personal sto
ries submitted by the Stanford
community, each of which draws

us willingly into the majestic
mountains, forests and ocean of
California. It is such a pity that the
possibility of creating new memo
ries like these is now at risk.
Seventy parks are due to be
closed this summer. California
State Parks, the government
agency in charge under the Cali
fornia Department of Parks and
Recreation, explains that the clo
sures are due to a $22 million
budget shortfall. Exactly what
does this mean? The simple an
swer is that nobody really knows.
Administratively, services like
public bathrooms, parking lots
and park ranger patrols will be
pulled. Museums and interpretive
hikes will no longer take place.
But, if you care to duck under the
'CLOSED' signs, maneuver
around the 'CLOSED' banners or
hop nimbly over the locked gates,

you can still explore and access
these areas of beauty.
Is it really so bad that we're
closing our state parks then? We
of Students for a Sustainable
Stanford are afraid that the an
swer is yes. There's a lot of uncer
tainty about what will happen
when these parks are no longer
protected or managed. Never be
fore have parks been closed in
times of recession, and park man
agement boards will lose a source
of revenue in visitor spending. Ac
cording to the Save Our State
Parks campaign, every $1 invest
ed in the state park system returns
$2.35 to the state's General Fund
by boosting local business income
and customer streams. More im
portantly, the closure of the state
parks is a clear statement of the
priorities of our government lead
ers. It sets a precedent that may

i threaten the continued existence
of these precious natural re
sources in California.
California's budget crisis is oc
curring in a larger, complex con
text, and difficult decisions are
being made in various other sec
tors and social services in our
state. But it is clear that the clo
sure of state parks does more
long-term, indirect harm than it
does short-term good in terms of
cost savings, and so we of Students
for a Sustainable Stanford oppose
and caution against the impend
ing closures,
i In addition to planning the dis
play in the CoHo (that you should
check out pronto), we organized a
field trip last quarter to Castle
Rock State Park, one of the parks
slated for closure. We're ramping
our campaign up in the next few
weeks. Noon to 1 p.m. on Friday,
May 4, we'll be tabling in White
Plaza; come hang out with us and
let's have a discussion! Next
week, we'll be showing a short
documentary, "The First 70,"
about state park closure in Cali
fornia. We'll also be organizing a
talk by Reed Flolderman, execu
tive director of The Sempevirens
Fund that has decided to adopt
Castle Rock and keep it open.
Sometime Memorial Day week
end, we'll visit Castle Rock to see
it for ourselves, and we want you
to come with us. More informa
tion and updates will be posted on
our website at http://sustainabili
ty.stanford.edu.
Help us save our state parks,
please.
