# MODERN MANNERS

PowerPoint presentations
have become the teaching
tool of choice in many Stan
ford classes. After all, how else
would it be possible for a professor
running short on time to finish the
material other than by flashing
dozens of testable facts on a screen
in a matter of seconds? And how
could students answer emails and
shop online during lecture if the
bulk of the material weren't avail
able on Coursework later?
More importantly, PowerPoint
presentations are fairly easy to
prepare and extremely easy to
reuse, which reduces the amount
of time that busy lecturers have to
spend preparing for each class.
From IHUM to computer science
to human biology, many of the lec
ture classes I have taken have con
sisted of continuous slideshows di
vided into 50 or 75 minute seg
ments.
There is no denying that Power-
Point presentations can be effec
tive in conveying information. Be
yond slideshows, the use of a com
puter interface allows a lecturer to
share diagrams, photos and educa
tional videos, which facilitates in
class learning that may not be
achievable any other way. For ex
ample, it would be hard for a lec
turer to adequately explain Frida
Kahlo's contributions to art with
out showing some of her paintings
to the class. Likewise, at the end of
a complex discussion, whether the
topic is cell biology or moral phi
losophy, many students are glad to
be presented with a slide summa
rizing the lecture's main points in
layman's terms. Clearly, technolo
gy does have some role in the Stan-

ford lecture hall.
My concern is when Power-
Point threatens to switch roles with
the professor; that is, when instead
of the slides being a supplement to
the professor's teaching, the pro
fessor's teaching becomes a sup
plement to the words on the slides.
There is always a risk of this hap
pening because bright screens
draw in eyes. This leads to the clas
sic situation where everyone has
read the static lines of text three
times before the professor gets
around to reading them, while in
the interim no one heard what he
or she was saying. Professor James
Gross, who taught my Psychology
1 class last year, has solved this
problem. Whenever the slide ma
terial was not directly relevant to
what he was saying, he would click
a button to make the screen go
black. Not only did he receive
more attention this way, it was sur
prisingly refreshing to the eyes to
have that electronic glow go away
occasionally.
Speakers become more engag
ing when they do not have to com
pete with a bright screen behind
them. When all eyes are focused on
them, professors sense the atten
tion of the audience and perform
at a higher level. Stanford lecturers
are passionate, often quirky peo
ple, and they are most interesting
when they share their knowledge
in their own voices, not the bullet
speak of PowerPoint.
Worse, poorly designed slides
can contain way too many facts
and figures for anyone to digest at
once, creating confusion about
how much students are expected
to know. Good teachers should be

able to explain all of the course
concepts in their own words during
the lecture periods. If they can't,
then the course has too much ma
terial.
As wonderful as visual learning
is, let's not forget the value of the
oral tradition, and the excitement
that comes with hearing the secrets
of the universe passed down by
wise elders. The Greeks had
Homer to recite "The Iliad," and
we have access to 21st century
knowledge from some of the fore
most contributors to it. I would
rather learn from these people's
own words than from projections
of textbook images.
When I look back on high
school where slideshow lec
tures existed, but were less com
mon part of me wonders how I
learned so much in classes that
lacked a succession of bullet points
to guide me through the material.
In particular, I remember my soph
omore year history class, where my
teacher seemingly narrated the en
tire history of Europe from the
1200s, barely looking at her notes
as the class scribbled down her
words at a furious pace. We should
strive for a similarly engaged
learning experience that demands
the same level of concentration,
rather than relying too heavily on
Microsoft Office.
