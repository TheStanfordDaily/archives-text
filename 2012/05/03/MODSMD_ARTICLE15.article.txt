## Guilty tendencies produce better business leaders 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marshall Watkins 
According to Stanford researchers, people
inclined to feel guilt make better business lead
ers, as they retain a stronger sense of responsi
bility to colleagues and subordinates that in
turn elicits trust in their leadership.
In the researchers' study, groups of up to five
strangers underwent personality tests assessing
traits such as guilt proneness, shame proneness

and extraversion. Without any designated
leader, the groups were then assigned two col
lective tasks, such as devising a marketing cam
paign.
A strong correlation between guilt prone
ness and the individuals most likely to be
judged by others as the group's leaders was con
sistent throughout all groups tested. The corre
lation between guilt proneness and leadership
was also stronger than extraversion, a previous
ly well-established indicator of leadership.
Similar results were obtained in a study of
incoming MBA students, in which surveys of
former colleagues and clients established fur
ther connections between guilt proneness and

others' perception of their leadership.
Researchers supported the correlation by
arguing that greater guilt proneness led to in
creased willingness to accommodate outside
viewpoints and a greater accountability to the
group's interests as a whole. In practical terms,
that may translate into behavior such as sup
porting layoffs to keep a firm profitable.
"If people feel guilty towards their organiza
tions, they'll behave in ways that make sure they
live up to the organization's expectations," said
Becky Schaumberg Ph.D. 'l4, the study's lead
researcher, according to the Huffington Post.
