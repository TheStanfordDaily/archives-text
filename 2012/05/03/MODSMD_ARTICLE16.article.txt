## YUN SHINING MOMENT 
### AUSTIN BLOCK STAFF WRITER 
Andrew Yun shot a 4-under-par 68 on the
final day of play over the weekend to secure a
two-shot victory at the Pac-12 Championships,
held at Oregon State's TrystingTree Golf Club.
However, Yun was one of the only Stanford
golfers to play well, and the No. 8 Cardinal
struggled to a sixth-place finish at 8-over-par,
20 strokes behind tournament winner Cal.
"It was a disappointing event for the team,"
said sophomore Cameron Wilson. "We felt
that everyone was playing well coming off [the
Cardinal's mid-April second-place finish at]
Pasatiempo, and Stanford teams have been

successful atTrystingTree in the past."
Yun, who shot rounds of 68-70-69-68 to fin
ish at -13, is Stanford's first conference cham
pion since 2002, when Jim Seki won the Pac-10
Championship at the same course. This was
Yun's second collegiate tournament win: he
won his first last year as a sophomore at The
Prestige at PGA West in La Quinta, Calif.
Behind Yun, freshman Patrick Rodgers, the
nation's third-ranked college golfer, vaulted
up the leaderboard with a tournament-low
round of 65, but a final round 70 left him in
eighth place.
From there, the drop-off was severe. Stan
ford's next-lowest scoring golfer was senior
David Chung, who finished 19 shots behind

Rodgers at +l3.
"Unfortunately we had the same problem
we have been struggling with all year. We have
a couple guys play really well but can't get a
good fourth or fifth score in there to capital
ize," said junior Steven Kearney. "In a game of
addition, you are only as strong as your weak
est link."
However, Kearney refused to consider the
Cardinal's sixth-place finish a huge setback.
"Every tournament is simply just prepara
tion for NCAAs," he said. "We are in the posi
tion now where we may not be a favorite, but I
think we will play better if we are considered
underdogs. All of our focus is being put in re
gionals now."
"I definitely don't think [the sixth-place fin
ish] shows how much talent we have, because I
feel like we have the most talent out of any
team in the Pac-12 and maybe even in the
country," Yun said. "We just have to have some
confidence and I think we're maybe lacking
that a little bit."
Perhaps the most disappointing moment of
the weekend came from a pencil, not from a
golf club, when Wilson, whose second-round
66 put him in a tie for seventh halfway through
the tournament, was disqualified after he acci
dentally signed an incorrect scorecard for his
third round of play.
"[His disqualification] was a little disap
pointing but it's just a good thing it didn't hap
pen at NCAAs, and I think he learned from it
and we all learned from it," Rodgers said.
In addition to the reminder to be circum
spect when signing a scorecard, the Cardinal
now has a golden opportunity ahead of it, as
Stanford hosts one of the six NCAA regionals
at the Stanford Golf Course starting May 17.
"We couldn't be more thrilled to play re
gionals at home," Wilson said. "Often, players
struggle to play in familiar settings as they place
too much internal pressure on themselves ...
It will be important to focus on the inherent ad
vantages that we have playing at our home
course, as well as the great support we'll enjoy
all weekend from our fans and supporters."
"It's going to play a lot different from our
home tournament," Rodgers said. "Our home
tournament was wet, it was playing long, now
it's going to be firm, it's going to be playing re
ally fast, the greens are going to be fast, the pins
are going to be really difficult, the rough is
going to be up, so Stanford will be all we can
ask for ... I think we're all excited."
A fifth-place finish or better will send the
Cardinal to the NCAA Championships, held
at Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles, start
ing May 29. Riviera is the annual site of the
PGA Tour's Northern Trust Open and has
hosted three PGA major championships, most
recently the 1995 PGA Championship.
After three rounds of stroke play, the 30-
team field at the NCAA Championships will
be whittled to eight, and the remaining eight
teams will then square off in a match-play
bracket to determine the NCAA champion.
