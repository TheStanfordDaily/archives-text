# HISTORY ON LUCK'S SIDE

### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
When the Indianapolis Colts
picked Cardinal quarterback An
drew Luck first overall in the NFL
draft on Thursday night, it marked
the fourth time a Stanford signal
caller has been taken first overall.
Luck joined the illustrious club of
Bobby Garrett, Jim Plunkett and
John Elway as the four Cardinal
first picks, and Stanford is now
one of just five schools to have
four or more players taken first
overall.
And while Luck's selection
was a huge media event, watched
by millions of football fans all
over the globe, a dig through The
Stanford Daily's archives reveals
that the distinction of being
picked first overall in the NFL
draft has changed quite a bit over
the years. A look back at the days
that Garrett, Plunkett and Elway
were drafted first overall reveals
an incredible amount about how
Stanford, the NFL and the United
States have changed over the last
60 years.
Bobby Garrett, Cleveland
Browns, 1954 Draft
Garrett, a Los Angeles native,
was an All-American quarter
back and an outstanding defen

sive back for the Stanford Indians
in the early 19505. Garrett's ex
ploits earned him both the MVP
of the 1954 Hula Bowl and the
W.J. Voit Memorial Trophy as the
most outstanding football player
on the West Coast.
Back then, the NFL was still a
fledgling league with just 12teams
(only two on the West Coast) and
the draft was far different than it is
today. Instead of seven rounds, the
1954 draft had 30 rounds, and a
peculiar quirk called the "bonus
pick." Today, the team with the
worst record in the NFL is guar
anteed to pick first overall, but the
drafts of the 1940s and 50s tossed
every team's name into a random
lottery, and the winner of the lot
tery got to pick first overall.
Under the tutelage of future
Hall of Fame coach Paul Brown,
the 1953 Cleveland Browns went
11-1 in the regular season, then
lost the NFL Championship
Game to the Detroit Lions, 17-16,
in a rematch of the 1952 NFL title
game. The Browns were the dom
inant force of the early 'sos, going
to six consecutive championship
games after joining the league in
1950, but they had the good for
tune of winning the "bonus pick"
lottery, allowing them the oppor
tunity to add to their already

stacked team.
The Browns were hoping to
find a successor to aging quarter
back Otto Graham (another fu
ture Hall of Famer) and thus
picked Garrett first overall.
"I am perfectly delighted to
have been chosen by the Browns,"
Garrett said in the Jan. 29, 1954
edition of The Daily. "I consider
Paul Brown one of the great
coaches in the game."

However, Garrett was unsure
whether or not he would take his
talents to the NFL, as the United
States was still in the final stages
of the Korean War.
"I'm in the Air ROTC, but it is
still not sure whether or not I will
be called," Garrett said.
Eventually, Garrett did make
it to the NFL, where his career
