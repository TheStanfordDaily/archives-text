# HISTORY ON LUCK'S SIDE
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
When the Indianapolis Colts
picked Cardinal quarterback An
drew Luck first overall in the NFL
draft on Thursday night, it marked
the fourth time a Stanford signal
caller has been taken first overall.
Luck joined the illustrious club of
Bobby Garrett, Jim Plunkett and
John Elway as the four Cardinal
first picks, and Stanford is now
one of just five schools to have
four or more players taken first
overall.
And while Luck's selection
was a huge media event, watched
by millions of football fans all
over the globe, a dig through The
Stanford Daily's archives reveals
that the distinction of being
picked first overall in the NFL
draft has changed quite a bit over
the years. A look back at the days
that Garrett, Plunkett and Elway
were drafted first overall reveals
an incredible amount about how
Stanford, the NFL and the United
States have changed over the last
60 years.
Bobby Garrett, Cleveland
Browns, 1954 Draft
Garrett, a Los Angeles native,
was an All-American quarter
back and an outstanding defen

sive back for the Stanford Indians
in the early 19505. Garrett's ex
ploits earned him both the MVP
of the 1954 Hula Bowl and the
W.J. Voit Memorial Trophy as the
most outstanding football player
on the West Coast.
Back then, the NFL was still a
fledgling league with just 12teams
(only two on the West Coast) and
the draft was far different than it is
today. Instead of seven rounds, the
1954 draft had 30 rounds, and a
peculiar quirk called the "bonus
pick." Today, the team with the
worst record in the NFL is guar
anteed to pick first overall, but the
drafts of the 1940s and 50s tossed
every team's name into a random
lottery, and the winner of the lot
tery got to pick first overall.
Under the tutelage of future
Hall of Fame coach Paul Brown,
the 1953 Cleveland Browns went
11-1 in the regular season, then
lost the NFL Championship
Game to the Detroit Lions, 17-16,
in a rematch of the 1952 NFL title
game. The Browns were the dom
inant force of the early 'sos, going
to six consecutive championship
games after joining the league in
1950, but they had the good for
tune of winning the "bonus pick"
lottery, allowing them the oppor
tunity to add to their already

stacked team.
The Browns were hoping to
find a successor to aging quarter
back Otto Graham (another fu
ture Hall of Famer) and thus
picked Garrett first overall.
"I am perfectly delighted to
have been chosen by the Browns,"
Garrett said in the Jan. 29, 1954
edition of The Daily. "I consider
Paul Brown one of the great
coaches in the game."

However, Garrett was unsure
whether or not he would take his
talents to the NFL, as the United
States was still in the final stages
of the Korean War.
"I'm in the Air ROTC, but it is
still not sure whether or not I will
be called," Garrett said.
Eventually, Garrett did make
it to the NFL, where his career

former Stanford players Bobby Garrett, Jim Plunkett and John Elway.
flamed out faster than perhaps any
first pick in NFL history. First, Gar
rett was traded to the Green Bay
Packers before training camp even
started. Next, he had to serve two
years in the Air Force, forcing him
away from the game of football.
After his two years of military
service, the Browns reacquired
Garrett from the Packers in anoth
er trade.
Finally, when he got to Cleve
land, the Browns discovered that
Garrett couldn't possibly play
quarterback in the NFL he stut
tered so badly that it was impossi
ble for him to even call plays in the
huddle.
In the end, Bobby Garrett, the
No. 1 pick in the 1954 draft, only
played nine games in the NFL.
Jim Plunkett, New England Pa
triots, 1971
By 1971, the NFL was a much
larger enterprise, as the league had
merged with the popular Ameri
can Football League in 1970, and

the first-ever Super Bowl had been
played just four year beforehand.
Plunkett, who had captured the
1970 Heisman Trophy, was select
ed first by the Boston Patriots, who
were coming off a dreadful 2-12
season.
While the Patriots entertained
trade offers from 17 of the 25 other
teams in the league, they eventually
picked Plunkett, calling him at 7:04
a.m. to tell him he was a Patriot.
"I feel honored to be picked
first, I just feel great about it,"
Plunkett told The Daily on Jan. 29,
1971. "It will be great to play with
Boston. I feel I can play right now
as a pro, but I don't expect to play
right away."
"He's the Joe Namath of the fu
ture," Indians head coach John
Mazur told The Daily.
Ole Miss quarterback Archie
Manning, the second-runner up
for the Heisman trophy and the fa
ther-to-be of Peyton and Eli Man
ning, was selected second overall
by the New Orleans Saints, and the
Houston Oilers picked Santa
Clara quarterback Dan Pastorini
with the third overall choice.
Plunkett wasn't quite the smash
hit that Mazur expected him to be,

as he struggled mightily after his
rookie season. After five years
with the Patriots, he was traded to
the San Francisco 49ers and then
released after a 5-9 season in 1977.
Plunkett then finally regained
that magic touch that made him
the first overall pick when he
joined the Oakland Raiders in
1978. Fie eventually stepped into
the starting role in 1980 after Pas
torini, the Raiders' starter, went
down with a broken leg, and Plun
kett went on to lead the silver and
black to Super Bowl victories in
1981 and 1984.
John Elway, Baltimore Colts,
1983
Elway, the runner-up to Geor
gia running back Herschel Walker
for the 1982 Heisman, was sure to
be a superstar professional athlete
but he wasn't sure whether that
would be in professional baseball
or football.
The Baltimore Colts, picking
first overall after a 0-8-1 campaign
in the strike-shortened 1982 sea
son, clearly wished to pick the
strong-armed Californian, but
Elway wasn't having it. After the
Colts picked him first overall
(Walker was picked first by the

United States Football League's
New Jersey Generals), Elway in
sisted he would join the New York
Yankees organization if the Colts
did not trade him to a "West Coast
team or a (NFL) contender," the
April 27, 1983 issue of The Daily
reported.
Elway made his ire toward the
Colts clear, especially during a bit
ter phone call with Colts head
coach Frank Kush.
"I said, 'Mr. Kush, I don't want
to be a jerk or anything, but we've
told you for the past three months
that I don't want to play for Balti
more. And I know for a fact you've
been offered three (first-round
picks) and a quarterback and you
turned that down. And right now
you've got nothing.' And then I
hung up the phone," Elway said.
Eventually, Elway's fit gar
nered him the trade he so desired,
as he joined the other equine NFL
team when the Colts traded him to
the Denver Broncos, who had
gone 2-7 in 1982, on May 2.
This time, Elway's response
was much different.
"I'm definitely thrilled to be
here," Elway told The Daily on
May 3. "It's something I didn't ex

pect to happen. I'm glad to be play
ing in the NFL and I'm glad to be
playing for the Denver Broncos."
El way would play for the Bron
cos for the next 15 years, taking
them to five Super Bowls and win
ning two in the final two years of
his career.
Clearly, the NFL draft has
changed immensely over the past
60 years, and it's interesting to con
sider how some of the players in
the careers of Plunkett and Elway
have already affected Luck's
week-old NFL career. After all,
Archie Manning, who was drafted
right after Plunkett, is the father of
Peyton Manning, the man Luck
will be replacing with the Colts,
who was signed this offseason by
the John Elway, the Executive Vice
President of Football Operations
for the Denver Broncos. Today, it's
impossible to know what the tra
jectory of Luck's career will look
like, but perhaps only one thing is
for sure Luck probably wants
his career to look more like that of
Plunkett or Elway than that of
Bobby Garrett.

flamed out faster than perhaps any
first pick in NFL history. First, Gar
rett was traded to the Green Bay
Packers before training camp even
started. Next, he had to serve two
years in the Air Force, forcing him
away from the game of football.
After his two years of military
service, the Browns reacquired
Garrett from the Packers in anoth
er trade.
Finally, when he got to Cleve
land, the Browns discovered that
Garrett couldn't possibly play
quarterback in the NFL he stut
tered so badly that it was impossi
ble for him to even call plays in the
huddle.
In the end, Bobby Garrett, the
No. 1 pick in the 1954 draft, only
played nine games in the NFL.
Jim Plunkett, New England Pa
triots, 1971
By 1971, the NFL was a much
larger enterprise, as the league had
merged with the popular Ameri
can Football League in 1970, and

the first-ever Super Bowl had been
played just four year beforehand.
Plunkett, who had captured the
1970 Heisman Trophy, was select
ed first by the Boston Patriots, who
were coming off a dreadful 2-12
season.
While the Patriots entertained
trade offers from 17 of the 25 other
teams in the league, they eventually
picked Plunkett, calling him at 7:04
a.m. to tell him he was a Patriot.
"I feel honored to be picked
first, I just feel great about it,"
Plunkett told The Daily on Jan. 29,
1971. "It will be great to play with
Boston. I feel I can play right now
as a pro, but I don't expect to play
right away."
"He's the Joe Namath of the fu
ture," Indians head coach John
Mazur told The Daily.
Ole Miss quarterback Archie
Manning, the second-runner up
for the Heisman trophy and the fa
ther-to-be of Peyton and Eli Man
ning, was selected second overall
by the New Orleans Saints, and the
Houston Oilers picked Santa
Clara quarterback Dan Pastorini
with the third overall choice.
Plunkett wasn't quite the smash
hit that Mazur expected him to be,

as he struggled mightily after his
rookie season. After five years
with the Patriots, he was traded to
the San Francisco 49ers and then
released after a 5-9 season in 1977.
Plunkett then finally regained
that magic touch that made him
the first overall pick when he
joined the Oakland Raiders in
1978. Fie eventually stepped into
the starting role in 1980 after Pas
torini, the Raiders' starter, went
down with a broken leg, and Plun
kett went on to lead the silver and
black to Super Bowl victories in
1981 and 1984.
John Elway, Baltimore Colts,
1983
Elway, the runner-up to Geor
gia running back Herschel Walker
for the 1982 Heisman, was sure to
be a superstar professional athlete
but he wasn't sure whether that
would be in professional baseball
or football.
The Baltimore Colts, picking
first overall after a 0-8-1 campaign
in the strike-shortened 1982 sea
son, clearly wished to pick the
strong-armed Californian, but
Elway wasn't having it. After the
Colts picked him first overall
(Walker was picked first by the

United States Football League's
New Jersey Generals), Elway in
sisted he would join the New York
Yankees organization if the Colts
did not trade him to a "West Coast
team or a (NFL) contender," the
April 27, 1983 issue of The Daily
reported.
Elway made his ire toward the
Colts clear, especially during a bit
ter phone call with Colts head
coach Frank Kush.
"I said, 'Mr. Kush, I don't want
to be a jerk or anything, but we've
told you for the past three months
that I don't want to play for Balti
more. And I know for a fact you've
been offered three (first-round
picks) and a quarterback and you
turned that down. And right now
you've got nothing.' And then I
hung up the phone," Elway said.
Eventually, Elway's fit gar
nered him the trade he so desired,
as he joined the other equine NFL
team when the Colts traded him to
the Denver Broncos, who had
gone 2-7 in 1982, on May 2.
This time, Elway's response
was much different.
"I'm definitely thrilled to be
here," Elway told The Daily on
May 3. "It's something I didn't ex

pect to happen. I'm glad to be play
ing in the NFL and I'm glad to be
playing for the Denver Broncos."
El way would play for the Bron
cos for the next 15 years, taking
them to five Super Bowls and win
ning two in the final two years of
his career.
Clearly, the NFL draft has
changed immensely over the past
60 years, and it's interesting to con
sider how some of the players in
the careers of Plunkett and Elway
have already affected Luck's
week-old NFL career. After all,
Archie Manning, who was drafted
right after Plunkett, is the father of
Peyton Manning, the man Luck
will be replacing with the Colts,
who was signed this offseason by
the John Elway, the Executive Vice
President of Football Operations
for the Denver Broncos. Today, it's
impossible to know what the tra
jectory of Luck's career will look
like, but perhaps only one thing is
for sure Luck probably wants
his career to look more like that of
Plunkett or Elway than that of
Bobby Garrett.

When the Indianapolis Colts
picked Cardinal quarterback An
drew Luck first overall in the NFL
draft on Thursday night, it marked
the fourth time a Stanford signal
caller has been taken first overall.
Luck joined the illustrious club of
Bobby Garrett, Jim Plunkett and
John Elway as the four Cardinal
first picks, and Stanford is now
one of just five schools to have
four or more players taken first
overall.
And while Luck's selection
was a huge media event, watched
by millions of football fans all
over the globe, a dig through The
Stanford Daily's archives reveals
that the distinction of being
picked first overall in the NFL
draft has changed quite a bit over
the years. A look back at the days
that Garrett, Plunkett and Elway
were drafted first overall reveals
an incredible amount about how
Stanford, the NFL and the United
States have changed over the last
60 years.
Bobby Garrett, Cleveland
Browns, 1954 Draft
Garrett, a Los Angeles native,
was an All-American quarter
back and an outstanding defen

sive back for the Stanford Indians
in the early 19505. Garrett's ex
ploits earned him both the MVP
of the 1954 Hula Bowl and the
W.J. Voit Memorial Trophy as the
most outstanding football player
on the West Coast.
Back then, the NFL was still a
fledgling league with just 12teams
(only two on the West Coast) and
the draft was far different than it is
today. Instead of seven rounds, the
1954 draft had 30 rounds, and a
peculiar quirk called the "bonus
pick." Today, the team with the
worst record in the NFL is guar
anteed to pick first overall, but the
drafts of the 1940s and 50s tossed
every team's name into a random
lottery, and the winner of the lot
tery got to pick first overall.
Under the tutelage of future
Hall of Fame coach Paul Brown,
the 1953 Cleveland Browns went
11-1 in the regular season, then
lost the NFL Championship
Game to the Detroit Lions, 17-16,
in a rematch of the 1952 NFL title
game. The Browns were the dom
inant force of the early 'sos, going
to six consecutive championship
games after joining the league in
1950, but they had the good for
tune of winning the "bonus pick"
lottery, allowing them the oppor
tunity to add to their already

stacked team.
The Browns were hoping to
find a successor to aging quarter
back Otto Graham (another fu
ture Hall of Famer) and thus
picked Garrett first overall.
"I am perfectly delighted to
have been chosen by the Browns,"
Garrett said in the Jan. 29, 1954
edition of The Daily. "I consider
Paul Brown one of the great
coaches in the game."

However, Garrett was unsure
whether or not he would take his
talents to the NFL, as the United
States was still in the final stages
of the Korean War.
"I'm in the Air ROTC, but it is
still not sure whether or not I will
be called," Garrett said.
Eventually, Garrett did make
it to the NFL, where his career

black to Super Bowl victories in
1981 and 1984.
John Elway, Baltimore Colts,
1983
Elway, the runner-up to Geor
gia running back Herschel Walker
for the 1982 Heisman, was sure to
be a superstar professional athlete
but he wasn't sure whether that
would be in professional baseball
or football.
The Baltimore Colts, picking
first overall after a 0-8-1 campaign
in the strike-shortened 1982 sea
son, clearly wished to pick the
strong-armed Californian, but
Elway wasn't having it. After the
Colts picked him first overall
(Walker was picked first by the

United States Football League's
New Jersey Generals), Elway in
sisted he would join the New York
Yankees organization if the Colts
did not trade him to a "West Coast
team or a (NFL) contender," the
April 27, 1983 issue of The Daily
reported.
Elway made his ire toward the
Colts clear, especially during a bit
ter phone call with Colts head
coach Frank Kush.
"I said, 'Mr. Kush, I don't want
to be a jerk or anything, but we've
told you for the past three months
that I don't want to play for Balti
more. And I know for a fact you've
been offered three (first-round
picks) and a quarterback and you
turned that down. And right now
you've got nothing.' And then I
hung up the phone," Elway said.
Eventually, Elway's fit gar
nered him the trade he so desired,
as he joined the other equine NFL
team when the Colts traded him to
the Denver Broncos, who had
gone 2-7 in 1982, on May 2.
This time, Elway's response
was much different.
"I'm definitely thrilled to be
here," Elway told The Daily on
May 3. "It's something I didn't ex

pect to happen. I'm glad to be play
ing in the NFL and I'm glad to be
playing for the Denver Broncos."
El way would play for the Bron
cos for the next 15 years, taking
them to five Super Bowls and win
ning two in the final two years of
his career.
Clearly, the NFL draft has
changed immensely over the past
60 years, and it's interesting to con
sider how some of the players in
the careers of Plunkett and Elway
have already affected Luck's
week-old NFL career. After all,
Archie Manning, who was drafted
right after Plunkett, is the father of
Peyton Manning, the man Luck
will be replacing with the Colts,
who was signed this offseason by
the John Elway, the Executive Vice
President of Football Operations
for the Denver Broncos. Today, it's
impossible to know what the tra
jectory of Luck's career will look
like, but perhaps only one thing is
for sure Luck probably wants
his career to look more like that of
Plunkett or Elway than that of
Bobby Garrett.

When the Indianapolis Colts
picked Cardinal quarterback An
drew Luck first overall in the NFL
draft on Thursday night, it marked
the fourth time a Stanford signal
caller has been taken first overall.
Luck joined the illustrious club of
Bobby Garrett, Jim Plunkett and
John Elway as the four Cardinal
first picks, and Stanford is now
one of just five schools to have
four or more players taken first
overall.
And while Luck's selection
was a huge media event, watched
by millions of football fans all
over the globe, a dig through The
Stanford Daily's archives reveals
that the distinction of being
picked first overall in the NFL
draft has changed quite a bit over
the years. A look back at the days
that Garrett, Plunkett and Elway
were drafted first overall reveals
an incredible amount about how
Stanford, the NFL and the United
States have changed over the last
60 years.
Bobby Garrett, Cleveland
Browns, 1954 Draft
Garrett, a Los Angeles native,
was an All-American quarter
back and an outstanding defen

sive back for the Stanford Indians
in the early 19505. Garrett's ex
ploits earned him both the MVP
of the 1954 Hula Bowl and the
W.J. Voit Memorial Trophy as the
most outstanding football player
on the West Coast.
Back then, the NFL was still a
fledgling league with just 12teams
(only two on the West Coast) and
the draft was far different than it is
today. Instead of seven rounds, the
1954 draft had 30 rounds, and a
peculiar quirk called the "bonus
pick." Today, the team with the
worst record in the NFL is guar
anteed to pick first overall, but the
drafts of the 1940s and 50s tossed
every team's name into a random
lottery, and the winner of the lot
tery got to pick first overall.
Under the tutelage of future
Hall of Fame coach Paul Brown,
the 1953 Cleveland Browns went
11-1 in the regular season, then
lost the NFL Championship
Game to the Detroit Lions, 17-16,
in a rematch of the 1952 NFL title
game. The Browns were the dom
inant force of the early 'sos, going
to six consecutive championship
games after joining the league in
1950, but they had the good for
tune of winning the "bonus pick"
lottery, allowing them the oppor
tunity to add to their already

stacked team.
The Browns were hoping to
find a successor to aging quarter
back Otto Graham (another fu
ture Hall of Famer) and thus
picked Garrett first overall.
"I am perfectly delighted to
have been chosen by the Browns,"
Garrett said in the Jan. 29, 1954
edition of The Daily. "I consider
Paul Brown one of the great
coaches in the game."

However, Garrett was unsure
whether or not he would take his
talents to the NFL, as the United
States was still in the final stages
of the Korean War.
"I'm in the Air ROTC, but it is
still not sure whether or not I will
be called," Garrett said.
Eventually, Garrett did make
it to the NFL, where his career

flamed out faster than perhaps any
first pick in NFL history. First, Gar
rett was traded to the Green Bay
Packers before training camp even
started. Next, he had to serve two
years in the Air Force, forcing him
away from the game of football.
After his two years of military
service, the Browns reacquired
Garrett from the Packers in anoth
er trade.
Finally, when he got to Cleve
land, the Browns discovered that
Garrett couldn't possibly play
quarterback in the NFL he stut
tered so badly that it was impossi
ble for him to even call plays in the
huddle.
In the end, Bobby Garrett, the
No. 1 pick in the 1954 draft, only
played nine games in the NFL.
Jim Plunkett, New England Pa
triots, 1971
By 1971, the NFL was a much
larger enterprise, as the league had
merged with the popular Ameri
can Football League in 1970, and

the first-ever Super Bowl had been
played just four year beforehand.
Plunkett, who had captured the
1970 Heisman Trophy, was select
ed first by the Boston Patriots, who
were coming off a dreadful 2-12
season.
While the Patriots entertained
trade offers from 17 of the 25 other
teams in the league, they eventually
picked Plunkett, calling him at 7:04
a.m. to tell him he was a Patriot.
"I feel honored to be picked
first, I just feel great about it,"
Plunkett told The Daily on Jan. 29,
1971. "It will be great to play with
Boston. I feel I can play right now
as a pro, but I don't expect to play
right away."
"He's the Joe Namath of the fu
ture," Indians head coach John
Mazur told The Daily.
Ole Miss quarterback Archie
Manning, the second-runner up
for the Heisman trophy and the fa
ther-to-be of Peyton and Eli Man
ning, was selected second overall
by the New Orleans Saints, and the
Houston Oilers picked Santa
Clara quarterback Dan Pastorini
with the third overall choice.
Plunkett wasn't quite the smash
hit that Mazur expected him to be,

as he struggled mightily after his
rookie season. After five years
with the Patriots, he was traded to
the San Francisco 49ers and then
released after a 5-9 season in 1977.
Plunkett then finally regained
that magic touch that made him
the first overall pick when he
joined the Oakland Raiders in
1978. Fie eventually stepped into
the starting role in 1980 after Pas
torini, the Raiders' starter, went
down with a broken leg, and Plun
kett went on to lead the silver and
black to Super Bowl victories in
1981 and 1984.
John Elway, Baltimore Colts,
1983
Elway, the runner-up to Geor
gia running back Herschel Walker
for the 1982 Heisman, was sure to
be a superstar professional athlete
but he wasn't sure whether that
