# Grading the NFL matches
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
Now that the 2012
NFL draft is en
shrined in history
and every team has
had its pick of the un
drafted free agents, we in the sports
media get to do our favorite thing:
make predictions for the future
based on the limited knowledge we
have in the present.
While a lot of people like to give
grades to NFL teams about their
draft, I'm going to switch the script a
little bit. Instead, I'm going to give
some grades to the matches be
tween the (former) Cardinal play
ers and their new NFL teams, taking
into account just how well the dozen
guys who are joining the league fit
with their newfound employers.
Indianapolis Colts: Andrew
Luck, Coby Fleener and Griff
Whalen A
All three of these players are in a
great situation in Indianapolis.
While the team is in need of a lot of
help, Luck and Fleener will start
every game right away, and I have to
believe that Whalen also has an ex
cellent chance to make the team,
which is really the ultimate goal for
any undrafted free agent. The Colts
went out of their way to draft and
sign Luck's two favorite targets
from last season, so they're definite
ly going to do everything they can to
accommodate their new franchise
quarterback, and that means that
Whalen will likely end up with a
horseshoe on his helmet come fall.
Pittsburgh Steelers: David De-
Castro A+
If I could, I would put about a mil
lion plusses on this pick for the Steel
era Just imagine the scene from "A
Christmas Story" where Ralphie
gets an A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus
ad infinitum for his essay on the Red
Rider BB Gun. While it always
make me throw up in my mouth a lit
tle bit when I hear the cliche that
Pittsburgh is a tough, blue-collar,
hard-working town, something
about the brutish personality of the
Steelers and DeCastro seems to fit
perfectly. I can say from firsthand ex
perience that talking to DeCastro is
about as intimidating as trying to
talk to a displeased rhinoceros. Alto
gether, I can't wait to see him in
black and gold, and I think he and
center Maurkice Pouncey could im
mediately give the Steelers the best
interior offensive line in the NFL
an absolute necessity when you play
against teams like the Ravens twice
a year.
Miami Dolphins: Jonathan Mar
tin — B+
While I like this pick for the Dol
phins, I do think there will be some
growing pains for Martin, as he's
likely going to have to switch to the
other side of the line if he wants to
play right away. Asking a player to
switch positions, in addition to play
ing against the freakish defensive
ends that populate the NFL nowa
days, is a tall task to ask, especially
when that player is a rookie. Martin
is in a great situation to learn how to
play in the NFL from Pro Bowl left
tackle Jake Long, but don't be sur
prised to see Martin struggle from
time to time in his first season, espe
cially with a rookie quarterback
(Dolphins first-round pick Ryan
Tannehill) taking the snaps.
San Francisco 49ers: Chris
Owusu, Matt Masifilo and Michael
Thomas C
I do like the fact that the 49ers
picked up all three of these guys, as
Owusu, Masifilo and Thomas are
all excellent players but I don't
necessarily like these players elect
ing to sign with the 49ers. Let me
explain: the Niners are a talented,
veteran team, as evidenced by the
fact that they made it all the way to
the NFC Championship Game last
year. Therefore, it's going to be dif
ficult for all three guys to make the
team, much less contribute in their
rookie years. The Niners have an
excellent defense and a surprising
ly deep receiving corps due to the
additions of Randy Moss, Mario
Manningham and first-round pick
A.J. Jenkins this winter, so it's pos
sible that none of these three play
ers could make the team come this
fall unless former coach Jim Har
baugh goes out of his way to pro
tect his guys.
Buffalo Bills: Delano Howell
C
Howell's choice of Buffalo was a
bit curious to me because the Bills
actually have a pretty talented
group of cornerbacks and safeties
already, as they signed four other
undrafted cornerbacks and took
South Carolina corner Stephon
Gilmore with the 10th overall pick.
Howell is certainly talented enough
to beat out the other undrafted
guys, but the numbers don't really
appear to be in his favor.
Cleveland Browns: Johnson
Bademosi A
I think Cleveland is an excellent
spot for Bademosi, because he'll
have a great shot to make the team
right away. The Browns defensive
backfield was (surprisingly) the sec
ond-best in the league last season,
but they were 30th in the league in
run defense, so if Bademosi shows
in training camp that he make a few
sure tackles against running backs
on the second level and play some
special teams, he'll probably see a
fair amount of playing time. That
said, Bademosi will be switching
from cornerback to safety, so that
might hamper his chances a bit.
Philadelphia Eagles: Jeremy
Stewart A
Word on the street is that Stew
art will switch to fullback to try and
make the Eagles, and I think that
he's got a good chance to do it be
cause he's a strong blocker and
short-yardage guy. He's also been a

reliable special teamer in his time at
Stanford, and that is always a huge
boost to any player trying to make a
team.
Oakland Raiders: Corey Gate
wood B+
I rate Gatewood so highly be
cause he's switched back and forth
between offense and defense three
times in his Stanford career, so it's
nice to see him get an opportunity
at the next level. While he doesn't
necessarily have a natural position,
he did play well at cornerback near
the end of last season. That said, I'd
be surprised to see him make the
Raiders' roster, even with former
Stanford defensive coordinator
Jason Tarver now running the
Raider defense.
Altogether, the NFL now has a
massive influx of talented Cardinal
players that, one way or another, will
be making their mark on the league
for years to come. Someday, when
these guys are starters for playoff
teams, it'll be fun to watch them clash
against their former teammates
and remember just how much fun
they were to watch on the Farm.
