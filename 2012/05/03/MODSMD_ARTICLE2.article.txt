# BIG 12 CALLS BOWLSBY
## A.D. TO BE CONFERENCE COMMISSIONER 
### JACOB JAFFE JACK BLANCHAT 
According to multiple sources, Stanford ath
letic director Bob Bowlsby has been offered the
job of Big 12 commissioner and will accept the
job. Bowlsby will replace interim commissioner
Chuck Neinas, who stepped in as interim com
missioner when Dan Beebe, who had been the
commissioner since 2007, was fired in September
2011.
The 60-year-old Bowlsby, a native of Water
loo, lowa, was the athletic director at Northern
lowa from 1984-1991 and the athletic director at

the University of lowa from 1991-2006. Bowlsby
replaced Ted Leland as Stanford's sixth athletic
director in April 2006.
In addition to his experience in lowa and on
the Farm, Bowlsby is also on the United States
Olympic Committee Board of Directors, and was
the head of the NCAA Basketball Selection
Committee in 2006.
Under his leadership, Stanford has continued
its tradition of athletic success, extending its un
precedented streak of consecutive seasons with

an NCAA title to 35 years. The
Cardinal also became the second
athletics program ever with 100
NCAA team titles. Stanford
added the inaugural women's
Capital One Cup to its trophy
case to go along with its 17 con
secutive Directors' Cups. In 2011,
Bowlsby signed a contract exten

sion with Stanford that ran
through 2017.
Bowlsby was highly influential
in the resurgence of Stanford
football during his time on the
Farm, as he hired Jim Harbaugh
as the head football coach in 2006.
Bowlsby was also instrumental in
the hiring process for Pac-12 com
missioner Larry Scott and in the
negotiations for the Pac-12's $3
billion dollar television deal in
2011.

The Big 12 Conference is in
the midst of change, starting with

the departures of Colorado and
Nebraska to the Pac-12 and Big
Ten, respectively, last year. After a
year with 10 schools, the Big 12
lost two more when Missouri and
Texas A&M decided to leave for
the SEC. Faced with the possibili
ty of collapse, the Big 12 has
agreed to add West Virginia and
TCU to get back to 10 schools for
next season.
