# University confirms end of XOX lease
## Interim period will see joint management of house 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Chi Theta Chi (XOX) representa
tives and University administrators
are close to a structured agreement
that would see the house's lease lapse
for "a minimum of two years," during
which the two groups will jointly man
age and operate the residence.
The deal, which has yet to be final
ized, will see the University assume
legal ownership of the house, collect
student funds for housing and pay for
repairs. The Alumni Board will be re
sponsible for managing and oversee
ing the residential program, the provi
sion of food and board and house
staffing.
"This arrangement allows the Chi
Theta Chi alumni organization to
demonstrate that it is qualified to take
over and sustain management of the
house once the University has confi
dence that the alumni organization
will maintain a reliable, healthy and
productive educational experience
and living environment," wrote Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman and Senior Associate Vice
Provost of Residential and Dining
Enterprises Shirley Everett in a joint
statement.
Administrators first moved to ter
minate Chi Theta Chi's lease on Feb.
8, citing "pressing life safety issues" as
well as structural shortcomings in the
house's operation and finances, with

the stated intent of assuming control
of the house on April 2. The Universi
ty, which owns the land on which
XOX stands, later postponed its
takeover until Aug. 31, when the an
nually renewed lease of the house will
expire.
While earlier indications suggest
ing the University may have adopted
a softer approach to the lease issue ul
timately failed to match the hopes of
XOX representatives, Abel Allison
'OB, president of the XOX alumni
board, emphasized that an agreement
that would protect critical aspects of
the house's culture would offer some
consolation.
"Ultimately, what I care about is
preserving the aspects of the house
that define it," Allison said. "If we
have a defined and measurable way to
regain that lease and protect the
things we care about... it's not ideal,
but it's acceptable."
Boardman and Everett acknowl
edged the extensive efforts of XOX
community members in advocating
the house's continued independence.
In late February, the ASSU Under
graduate Senate unanimously passed
a resolution in support of an inde
pendent Chi Theta Chi, citing support
from, among others, Boardman.
"Chi Theta Chi is indeed a special
place, as is evidenced by the passion
ate commitment of its residents and
alumni," Boardman and Everett
wrote in their statement. "Our
ideal is for Chi Theta Chi to re
gain its independence while also
meeting or exceeding our shared
expectations."
House residents and staff ex
pressed concern, however, at the
lease's lapse, arguing against an
entrenched University role in the
historically independent house.
"Joint oversight denies us
what we're already clearly capa
ble of doing running the house
on our own," said Laura Mc-
Martin 'l4. "I don't know how
joint oversight would allow us to
demonstrate that we can [do so]."
Gerad Hanono 'l2, XOX
house manager, expressed con
cern and disappointment that
residents had been largely ex
cluded from the negotiations
with the University, at the admin
istration's request, and deprived
of any indication of progress, a
sentiment echoed by McMartin
in an op-ed in The Daily ("No
news for Chi Theta Chi NOT
okay," April 25).
"It's unfortunate that we've
been left out of the process, since
we're the main stakeholders,"
Hanono said.
"The amount of work the stu
dents have put in and are willing
to put in is astounding," Allison
noted. "It makes us really sad that
we couldn't have everyone in this
conversation throughout."
McMartin and Hanono also
criticized the degree to which the
University's presence has already
become apparent to house resi
dents. Administrators have con
ducted walk-throughs of the
house including one during fi
nals week of winter quarter as

well as inspections of personal
spaces. Staff selection for next
year, however, was conducted
under the assumption that the
house will operate largely under
the status quo.
"We have to be very aware,"
McMartin said. "It adds up, all
these things that we're quite com
fortable living with but that the
University sees as a significant
problem. The standards are a lit
tle ridiculous."
McMartin argued that the
University's silence on the matter
of Chi Theta Chi's lease and
the lack of direct contact between
residents and the administrators
adjudicating the house's future
demonstrated "an inherent
disconnect between students and
administrators," drawing paral

lels to a lack of communication
between the University and stu
dents on the topic of mental
health.
"We residents are seriously
confused about how the Univer
sity is holding our lease over our
heads, claiming to have our
health in mind, while making
zero effort to reach out and see
how we're actually doing," Mc-
Martin wrote in an email to The
Daily. "I can't accept that the
University has students' interests
in mind at all since they've thor
oughly disrupted our community
that has been functioning happily
and healthily on its own."
Boardman and Everett de
clined to comment on the alleged
lack of communication between
the University and Chi Theta Chi

residents.
While Boardman and Everett
expressed support for Chi Theta
Chi as a "vital and important piece
of the rich cultural fabric of the
undergraduate experience," Alli
son voiced concern that any loss of
autonomy and self-management
however temporary might
irreparably damage the house's
unique character and tradition.
"The [potential] loss of institu
tional memory is very concern
ing," Allison said. "It's something
I'm very worried about, and we'll
be doing a lot of soul searching ..
. It's going to take some work and
conversation to figure out how
we're going to [preserve that]."

legal ownership of the house, collect
student funds for housing and pay for
repairs. The Alumni Board will be re
sponsible for managing and oversee
ing the residential program, the provi
sion of food and board and house
staffing.
"This arrangement allows the Chi
Theta Chi alumni organization to
demonstrate that it is qualified to take
over and sustain management of the
house once the University has confi
dence that the alumni organization
will maintain a reliable, healthy and
productive educational experience
and living environment," wrote Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman and Senior Associate Vice
Provost of Residential and Dining
Enterprises Shirley Everett in a joint
statement.
Administrators first moved to ter
minate Chi Theta Chi's lease on Feb.
8, citing "pressing life safety issues" as
well as structural shortcomings in the
house's operation and finances, with

the stated intent of assuming control
of the house on April 2. The Universi
ty, which owns the land on which
XOX stands, later postponed its
takeover until Aug. 31, when the an
nually renewed lease of the house will
expire.
While earlier indications suggest
ing the University may have adopted
a softer approach to the lease issue ul
timately failed to match the hopes of
XOX representatives, Abel Allison
'OB, president of the XOX alumni
board, emphasized that an agreement
that would protect critical aspects of
the house's culture would offer some
consolation.
"Ultimately, what I care about is
preserving the aspects of the house
that define it," Allison said. "If we
have a defined and measurable way to
regain that lease and protect the
things we care about... it's not ideal,
but it's acceptable."
Boardman and Everett acknowl
edged the extensive efforts of XOX
community members in advocating
the house's continued independence.
In late February, the ASSU Under
graduate Senate unanimously passed
a resolution in support of an inde
pendent Chi Theta Chi, citing support
from, among others, Boardman.
"Chi Theta Chi is indeed a special
place, as is evidenced by the passion
ate commitment of its residents and
alumni," Boardman and Everett
wrote in their statement. "Our
ideal is for Chi Theta Chi to re
gain its independence while also
meeting or exceeding our shared
expectations."
House residents and staff ex
pressed concern, however, at the
lease's lapse, arguing against an
entrenched University role in the
historically independent house.
"Joint oversight denies us
what we're already clearly capa
ble of doing running the house
on our own," said Laura Mc-
Martin 'l4. "I don't know how
joint oversight would allow us to
demonstrate that we can [do so]."
Gerad Hanono 'l2, XOX
house manager, expressed con
cern and disappointment that
residents had been largely ex
cluded from the negotiations
with the University, at the admin
istration's request, and deprived
of any indication of progress, a
sentiment echoed by McMartin
in an op-ed in The Daily ("No
news for Chi Theta Chi NOT
okay," April 25).
"It's unfortunate that we've
been left out of the process, since
we're the main stakeholders,"
Hanono said.
"The amount of work the stu
dents have put in and are willing
to put in is astounding," Allison
noted. "It makes us really sad that
we couldn't have everyone in this
conversation throughout."
McMartin and Hanono also
criticized the degree to which the
University's presence has already
become apparent to house resi
dents. Administrators have con
ducted walk-throughs of the
house including one during fi
nals week of winter quarter as

well as inspections of personal
spaces. Staff selection for next
year, however, was conducted
under the assumption that the
house will operate largely under
the status quo.
"We have to be very aware,"
McMartin said. "It adds up, all
these things that we're quite com
fortable living with but that the
University sees as a significant
problem. The standards are a lit
tle ridiculous."
McMartin argued that the
University's silence on the matter
of Chi Theta Chi's lease and
the lack of direct contact between
residents and the administrators
adjudicating the house's future
demonstrated "an inherent
disconnect between students and
administrators," drawing paral

lels to a lack of communication
between the University and stu
dents on the topic of mental
health.
"We residents are seriously
confused about how the Univer
sity is holding our lease over our
heads, claiming to have our
health in mind, while making
zero effort to reach out and see
how we're actually doing," Mc-
Martin wrote in an email to The
Daily. "I can't accept that the
University has students' interests
in mind at all since they've thor
oughly disrupted our community
that has been functioning happily
and healthily on its own."
Boardman and Everett de
clined to comment on the alleged
lack of communication between
the University and Chi Theta Chi

residents.
While Boardman and Everett
expressed support for Chi Theta
Chi as a "vital and important piece
of the rich cultural fabric of the
undergraduate experience," Alli
son voiced concern that any loss of
autonomy and self-management
however temporary might
irreparably damage the house's
unique character and tradition.
"The [potential] loss of institu
tional memory is very concern
ing," Allison said. "It's something
I'm very worried about, and we'll
be doing a lot of soul searching ..
. It's going to take some work and
conversation to figure out how
we're going to [preserve that]."
