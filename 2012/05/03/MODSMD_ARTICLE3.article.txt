# University confirms end of XOX lease
## Interim period will see joint management of house 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Chi Theta Chi (XOX) representa
tives and University administrators
are close to a structured agreement
that would see the house's lease lapse
for "a minimum of two years," during
which the two groups will jointly man
age and operate the residence.
The deal, which has yet to be final
ized, will see the University assume
legal ownership of the house, collect
student funds for housing and pay for
repairs. The Alumni Board will be re
sponsible for managing and oversee
ing the residential program, the provi
sion of food and board and house
staffing.
"This arrangement allows the Chi
Theta Chi alumni organization to
demonstrate that it is qualified to take
over and sustain management of the
house once the University has confi
dence that the alumni organization
will maintain a reliable, healthy and
productive educational experience
and living environment," wrote Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman and Senior Associate Vice
Provost of Residential and Dining
Enterprises Shirley Everett in a joint
statement.
Administrators first moved to ter

8, citing "pressing life safety issues" as
well as structural shortcomings in the
house's operation and finances, with

the stated intent of assuming control
of the house on April 2. The Universi
ty, which owns the land on which
XOX stands, later postponed its
takeover until Aug. 31, when the an
nually renewed lease of the house will
expire.
While earlier indications suggest
ing the University may have adopted
a softer approach to the lease issue ul
timately failed to match the hopes of
XOX representatives, Abel Allison
'OB, president of the XOX alumni
board, emphasized that an agreement
that would protect critical aspects of
the house's culture would offer some
consolation.
"Ultimately, what I care about is
preserving the aspects of the house
that define it," Allison said. "If we
have a defined and measurable way to
regain that lease and protect the
things we care about... it's not ideal,
but it's acceptable."
Boardman and Everett acknowl
edged the extensive efforts of XOX
community members in advocating
the house's continued independence.
In late February, the ASSU Under
graduate Senate unanimously passed
a resolution in support of an inde
pendent Chi Theta Chi, citing support
from, among others, Boardman.
"Chi Theta Chi is indeed a special
place, as is evidenced by the passion
