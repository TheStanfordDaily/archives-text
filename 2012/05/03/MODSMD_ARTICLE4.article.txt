### AARON SEKHRI STAFF WRITER 
Simplicity, communication and elegance
were the principal themes articulated by
Jack Dorsey CEO of Square, a mobile
payments company, and one of the original
founders of Twitter in a presentation to
an overflowing audience in the Packard
Electrical Engineering Building Wednesday
evening.
The presentation featured Dorsey,
Square Chief Operating Officer Keith
Rabois '9l and Square Vice President of
Hardware Jesse Dorogusker '93 M.S. '97 en
gaging in an open discussion of the nature of
the mobile payment business, the develop
ment of Square and their future plans.
Dorsey began the event with a brief dis
cussion of the payments not as transactions,
but "as communication, a simple interaction
that is an expression of value from party to
party."
He described the company's origin as an
attempt to address a simple problem

Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and CEO of Square, spoke Wednesday evening about the
future of mobile payments, presenting Square as an alternative to traditional transactions.
that he was selling.
"He very simply wanted to
make a payment but didn't have
access to those payment rails,
which meant that he lost out on
important revenue," Dorsey ex
plained.
Discussing the current state of
electronic payment processing,
Dorsey emphasized, "those sys
tems are not beautiful, not easy,
not mobile. The user experience
is designed to maximize utility
and nothing else."
Honing the process over the
last three years, the Square team
found its main audience in "sole
proprietors and brick-and-mor
tar small businesses".
"There are 26 million busi
nesses in America today that do

not accept credit cards," Dorsey
said, describing those firms as
prime consumers of Square's
services.
Critiquing large credit card
companies "for the hidden costs
of payments that no one is telling
businesses about," Dorsey pre
sented Square's flat rate of 2.75
percent as an alternative to the
"mess that is credit payments".
Furthermore, relating the tech
nological capabilities currently
available to Square's payments
model, he discussed the poten
tial use of Square products.
Dorsey explained that Square
can create tabs to develop rela
tionships between producer and
consumer, use geolocation tech
nologies to alert consumers of
businesses near them, make the
payments process less laborious
and allow small businesses ac
cess to analytic tools.
"It's 97 degrees out, and there
are a bunch of people down the

street who want lemonade, and
you, as a business, don't sell
that," Dorsey hypothesized.
"Square will help you say, why
don't you change that?"
"The big retailers, like Star
bucks and Walmart, already
have these tools at their dispos
al," Dorsey added. "Why can't
smaller businesses utilize them
as well?"
Dorsey ultimately expressed
his ambition for the company to
serve as one that "can make
every transaction meaningful to
both the consumer and the ven
dor." He then opened his presen
tation to his two colleagues for a
question-and-answer round, in
which audience questions
ranged from security and user
interaction to possible competi
tors for Square's products.
On the issue of security,
Rabois discussed using the trove
of information available to
Square, such as the time and

place of transactions, to raise
certain internal flags and prompt
investigations of suspicious be
havior.
In response to concerns ex
pressed by an audience member
about the viability of a payment
method vastly different from
conventional point-of-sales
transaction, Dorsey emphasized
the incremental nature of
Square's evolution and applica
tion.
"We are not trying to create
new behavior, but borrow from
what people have already learnt
and make it simpler and more ef
ficient," Dorsey clarified.
The talk was well received by
those who attended and partici
pated in an informal discussion
session with the three speakers
after the event.
Ike Shehadeh, proprietor of
the popular campus eatery Ike's
Place, told The Daily, "I thought
the event was very informative to

hear about the company. I use
them in some of my stores, and to
know what's happening behind
the scenes makes me want to do
business with them more."
"As far as it goes right now, at
the business at the volume that
mine is, it might not be feasible
given what I need, and where
they are," Shehadeh added. "I
know they can get there, and
hopefully they can get to that
stage where we can start working
with them."
