## Students reflect on Admit Weekend alcohol policy Castro defends decade-old policy and its application to Row residences 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
As over 1,000 prospective freshmen
(ProFros) converged on campus last week
end for Admit Weekend 2012, Stanford's
normal, unofficially liberal alcohol rules
were replaced by a zero-tolerance policy on
the consumption of alcohol. The more strin
gent regime is implemented across campus
for the annual event, even in residences not
hosting ProFros.
The policy is in place because of legal lia
bilities since many ProFros are under 18

but also to ensure that ProFros take ad
vantage of Stanford's diverse array of social
opportunities without their judgment im
paired by alcohol.
Stanford's Official Student Alcohol Poli
cy states that "Stanford students are prohib
ited from providing, serving or in any way
making alcohol available to any prospective
frosh" and that "no alcohol is to be present,
served or consumed at any .. . function dur
ing Admit Weekend."
This part of the Official Student Alcohol
Policy was enacted in 2001 in response to al
cohol-related incidents in previous years,
and is enforced largely by residential staff as
well as Admit Weekend student staff.
"The University looks at certain week
end periods as ... high-risk periods, but also

periods for which alcohol shouldn't be the
centerpiece to the social milieu," said Ralph
Castro, director of the Office of Alcohol
Policy and Education (OAPE), in reference
to Admit Weekend and New Student Orien
tation (NSO).
If a student were to violate the Admit
Weekend alcohol policy, it would be consid
ered a violation of the Fundamental Stan
dard and that student would be referred to
Judicial Affairs.
Similarly, if a student organization or
house were to host an event that served al
cohol, that entity would be referred to the
Organization Conduct Board. Potential
penalties include social suspension, alcohol
suspension or probation.
While the Row the focal
point of many on-campus social
activities did not host ProFros
or Admit Weekend events, the
zero-tolerance policy still ex
tended to Row house residents.
Several Row houses can
celled special dinners quar
terly celebrations for most
house communities, at which al
cohol is normally served and
residents were prohibited from
drinking in common spaces.
"I, personally, do not like the
strictness of the alcohol policy
over Admit Weekend," wrote
Libby Cummings 'l2, financial
manager at Slavianskii Dom, in
an email to The Daily. "[lt]
makes upperclassmen resent
the admitted students for caus
ing an alteration in the social
environment on campus."
"[ProFros] signed a con
tract, too," Castro said. "They
agreed to abide by all of our
policies and procedures. Failure
to uphold our policies and pro
cedures could constitute a disci
plinary action on their end
which could include the revoca
tion of an offer to come to Stan
ford."
Castro argued for the policy
on several grounds, noting that
any incident involving ProFros
many of whom are minors
and alcohol could result in legal
ramifications for the University
as well as the concerned stu
dents and ProFros.
"Since everyone was honest
and open about alcohol on cam
pus, I didn't feel like it was a
cover-up," said Laura Zalles, a
Pro Fro from Palo Alto, on the
rule. "I felt like it was a responsi
ble policy since there are parents
and high schoolers here."
"It [the alcohol policy] feels
like a bit of a cover-up," dissent
ed Jeremy Bernstein, a Pro Fro
from the United Kingdom. "I
feel like they're pretending alco
hol doesn't exist on campus."
None of the ProFros inter
viewed by The Daily had seen
any alcohol on campus, nor had
they seen any University stu
dents visibly intoxicated.
Castro also noted that the
policy affords freshmen an unim
paired opportunity to fully expe
rience Stanford and make appro
priate value judgments.

"We have a very vibrant social
scene at Stanford, but there are
many other aspects other than
[alcohol]," Castro said. "If stu
dents are making the decision to
come here based on that, that's
not what we want."
"If we're asking people to re
ally evaluate the next four or five
years of their life and a major life
decision, why would we provide
an opportunity for them to drink
and impair that decision?" Cas
tro added.
Elodie Nierenberg 'l5, a head
house host (HoHo) in Larkin,
expressed support for the policy,
noting that "a lot of [ProFros]
haven't been exposed to college
drinking culture and it is impor
tant for them not to feel pressure
or be intimidated by college life."
Asked whether the dorm staff
had had to deal with any alcohol
related incidents in the dorm this
weekend, Nierenberg said, "Al
cohol within the dorm wasn't a
problem, but I know there were
parties on campus this week
end."
"I think that there generally is
not enough inclusion of Row
houses in Admit Weekend . . .
largely because of the fear that
there would be alcohol," wrote
Jacob Boehm 'l2, community
manager at Columbae.
Boehm added that Columbae
had altered regular house pro
gramming in order to conform to
Admit Weekend's dry alcohol
policy, saying that the policy
"keeps the students focused,
healthy, and out of potentially
harmful situations."
Brittni Dixon-Smith 'll M.S.
'l2, a resident assistant (RA) in
Storey, downplayed the policy's
impact on house life.
"It happens every year you
come to expect it, and you plan
for it," Dixon-Smith said. "The
issue is having ProFros involved
in these environments, where
they could be at risk and not be
able to handle themselves."
Dixon-Smith also noted in
creased supervision and guid
ance given to house staff from
University administrators, with
the intent of preventing any po
tential issue from emerging.
Castro said his office has
never had to deal with any major
violations of the Admit Weekend
alcohol policy.
"For the most part, students .
.. understand our expectations
about [the policy]," Castro said.
