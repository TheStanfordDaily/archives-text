## Students reflect on Admit Weekend alcohol policy Castro defends decade-old policy and its application to Row residences 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
As over 1,000 prospective freshmen
(ProFros) converged on campus last week
end for Admit Weekend 2012, Stanford's
normal, unofficially liberal alcohol rules
were replaced by a zero-tolerance policy on
the consumption of alcohol. The more strin
gent regime is implemented across campus
for the annual event, even in residences not
hosting ProFros.
The policy is in place because of legal lia
bilities since many ProFros are under 18

but also to ensure that ProFros take ad
vantage of Stanford's diverse array of social
opportunities without their judgment im
paired by alcohol.
Stanford's Official Student Alcohol Poli
cy states that "Stanford students are prohib
ited from providing, serving or in any way
making alcohol available to any prospective
frosh" and that "no alcohol is to be present,
served or consumed at any .. . function dur
ing Admit Weekend."
This part of the Official Student Alcohol
Policy was enacted in 2001 in response to al
cohol-related incidents in previous years,
and is enforced largely by residential staff as
well as Admit Weekend student staff.
"The University looks at certain week
end periods as ... high-risk periods, but also

periods for which alcohol shouldn't be the
centerpiece to the social milieu," said Ralph
Castro, director of the Office of Alcohol
Policy and Education (OAPE), in reference
to Admit Weekend and New Student Orien
tation (NSO).
If a student were to violate the Admit
Weekend alcohol policy, it would be consid
ered a violation of the Fundamental Stan
dard and that student would be referred to
Judicial Affairs.
Similarly, if a student organization or
house were to host an event that served al
cohol, that entity would be referred to the
Organization Conduct Board. Potential
penalties include social suspension, alcohol
