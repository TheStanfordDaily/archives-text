## Students prepare for Olympics Student-athletes discuss hopes, training arid life balance 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN STAFF WRITER 
Had Stanford competed as its own
country in the Beijing Olympics, it
would have placed 11th — tied with
Japan — in total Olympics medals. This
summer is shaping up to be no differ
ent, as track and field athletes, synchro
nized swimmers, divers and water polo
players, among others, prepare for the
impending games in London.
"When you think of the Stanford
athletics brand, the Olympics play a big
part in shaping that brand," said Jim
Young, senior assistant athletic director
of communications and media rela
tions. "Over the years, Stanford Univer
sity has been able to attract world class
athletes in a wide variety of sports, and
a large part of their Olympic path went
right through Stanford. We're very
proud of our Olympic heritage and tra
dition."
Freshmen and seniors alike are en
tering their final few months of training
before heading to London. Amaechi
Morton '12, one Olympic hopeful, has
been training as a 400-meter hurdler
for the U.S. trials at the end of June.
"I've just been doing the same
thing," Morton said, when asked about
his training this year. "I'm trying to get
mentally ready — that's an important
part, too. If you're not ready mentally,
no matter how physically ready you
are, it doesn't matter... I keep telling
myself constantly that I can do this, that
I belong there."
While the Olympics had always
been in the back of Morton's mind, they
didn't become a tangible goal until his
sophomore year of college. For Kateri
na Stefanidi '12, a pole-vaulter from
Greece, the Olympics were also initial
ly a distant aspiration, leading her to ini
tially choose Stanford for its academic
excellence.
"The Olympics didn't really come
into my mind until last year when I
got the Olympic B standard," Ste
fanidi said. "Every athlete has the
dream to go to the Olympics. I can't
say that I never thought about
going, but there are always short
term goals that overwhelm you."
Stefanidi now is only a few inch
es away from securing the Olympic
A standard of 14' 9", which will se
cure her a spot on the Greek nation
al team this summer.
Kristian Ipsen 'l5, a diver and a
member of the U.S. National Diving
Team since 2009, also chose Stan
ford in part for the variety of oppor
tunities offered outside of the pool.
"I've always been really into
school," Ipsen said. "A lot of my fel
low competitors have taken this
year off just to train for the
Olympics, but I really wanted to go
to school and experience every
thing about college."
Unlike Morton and Stefanidi,
the London Olympics have been on
Ipsen's radar for quite a while, at
least since the diver was an alter
nate for the 2008 U.S. team. Al
though he is enthused about being a
student at Stanford, Ipsen has taken
spring quarter off in order to devote
himself more fully to his training
schedule.
Other athletes have also found it
difficult to balance the rigors of top
tier athletics with the challenges of
being a Stanford student, eventual
ly opting to take a leave of absence.
Maria Koroleva 'l2, a synchronized
swimmer, decided to postpone her
senior year at Stanford in order to
train with the U.S. National Team.
"When you are pursuing the
Olympic dream, you aren't just a
regular athlete," Koroleva said.
"You have to go above and be
yond."
The team component of syn
chronized swimming made this
commitment especially intense for
Koroleva. She recently qualified for
the Olympics in the duet the
zenith of synchronized swimming
events but described her qualifi
cation as "bittersweet" after the U.S.
Team failed to make it to the
Olympics.
When she returns to campus this
fall, Koroleva said she'll be happy to
focus on school. She described life
in Indianapolis, where she has been
with the National Team since last
June, as "all training, and not really
much of anything else,"
"I'm excited to come back. You
never really know how much you
appreciate your school until you

leave," Koroleva said.
Back in the pool, women's water
polo players Annika Dries 'l4 and
Melissa Seidemann 'l3 have also
taken this year off to train with the
U.S. National Team in preparation
for London, as did incoming fresh
man Maggie Steffens 'l6.
While some athletes have been
forced to choose between attending
Stanford and training for London,
Morton asserted that Stanford's
"stress on the excellence of aca
demics and athletics goes one and
one" together and has pushed him
to achieve distinction on all fronts.
"Coming from the institution,
you want to excel," Morton said.
"Because it's Stanford, you want to
hold the name up high. You want to
look to the expectations and the
standards."
"Success is contagious," said
Arantxa King 'll MA'l2, a redshirt
senior on the track team.
King is an Olympic veteran, hav
ing competed as a long jumper in
Beijing in 2008 for her native
Bermuda. She hopes to repeat the
feat this year in London.
"I can imagine that, from my ex
perience, being an athlete is being a
student just in a different dimen
sion," King said. "So,people who as
pire to do really well in their sport,
from my perspective, can also be
very alert and smart in the class
room as we 11... If you're dedicated
to your sport, you are dedicated to
excel in other areas."
Chris Derrick 'l2, a distance
runner on the track team who
hopes to qualify for the 5,000 and
10,000 meter events, noted that
Stanford opens a lot of opportuni
ties for the world beyond sports.
"A lot of the sports that we're re
ally good at are not necessarily the
most mainstream," Derrick said.
"For people who are doing track
and field or water polo, they know
there's going to have to be a life
after sports and given the facili
ties and the tradition of Stanford
it gives them a great chance to de
velop those athletic components,
but the academic prowess also gives
them a chance to develop for life
after sports."
Despite their remarkable ac
complishments as student-athletes,
prospective Olympians down
played their accomplishments in
the context of the greater Stanford
community.
"When I came here, my friends
from home were like 'Oh, are you
treated like a superstar at Stan
ford?"' King recalled. "And I said,
'No, no one is, because everyone
here is a superstar.'"
