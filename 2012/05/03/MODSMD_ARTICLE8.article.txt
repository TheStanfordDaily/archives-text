## Hoover fellow speaks on diplomacy 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
"Diplomacy is difficult because
you do not always achieve what
you want and there is constant ten
sion on how to protect your own in
terests while working with the in
terests of the other country," said
Mark Cassayre, a career U.S. diplo
mat and a current national security
affairs fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, speaking at the Haas Center
on Wednesday afternoon.
Cassayre's talk was titled, "Na
tional Security: Cooperation be
tween Diplomats and the Military."
In addition to addressing the rela
tionship between the U.S. Depart
ment of State and the military, he
branched out to discuss general
policy issues and practical aspects
of a foreign service career.
Prior to arriving at Stanford,
Cassayre worked for the State De
partment in Kenya, Ukraine,
Namibia, and Switzerland. Most re
cently, he served as the political
counselor to the U.S. Mission to the
United Nations in Geneva, which
required working with agencies
such as the U.N. Human Rights
Council, the World Health Organi
zation and the International Labor
Organization.
Cassayre began his talk by giv
ing a background of the State De
partment, including its history and
organizational structure, before
delving into how and why he be
came involved.
"I grew up in Napa, California
and did not have a lot of exposure
to diplomats and international af
fairs," he said. "But I always had an
interest in languages and studying
abroad."
Cassayre then listed and ex
plained the responsibilities of a
state official, which he said include
protecting U.S citizens abroad and
promoting U.S interests in areas
such as trade and democracy.
Shifting the focus of the talk to
the relationship between the State
Department and the military, he
pointed out that there are 100 de
fense personnel for every State De
partment employee,
"People talk about diplomacy
being our first line of defense," he
joked. "Well, it is obviously not a
very thick or deep line,"
Even though Cassayre stated
"we [the State Department and the

military] coordinate closely on a
day to day basis," he highlighted the
key challenge of the different ways
in which both institutions divide
world regions for operations.
Additionally, he noted that both
groups "do have very different cul
tures, backgrounds and training
methods."
Despite these obstacles, Cas
sayre said, "The overarching theme
of my experience is that there is a
need for military and State to work
together." He cited Afghanistan
and Pakistan as examples of places
where "it is essential we work hand
in glove for programs to be effec
tive on the ground."
"Some projects cannot achieve
their objectives without coordina
tion with the military," he said, cit
ing his work in the Ukraine de
stroying old armaments as an ex
ample of essential collaboration.
"We try our best to make this an
inter-agency process to make sure
all entities are represented and at
the table in order to organize a
good policy approach," he added.
Cassayre spent the second half
of the event in an open discussion
with participants. One audience
member posed a question on the
balance between private beliefs
and diplomatic instruction.
"Frankly I have not had an issue
of defending a policy that I disagree
with," Cassayre said. "Until you are

very senior, you don't have to de
fend a wide range of issues but
rather focus on a set of issues that
you are an expert in. They usually
aren't very controversial."
"Within the organization, you
have a voice and ways to share your
opinions," he added.
Cassayre also discussed the role
of human rights in diplomacy, and
the corresponding ability of diplo
macy to raise awareness of human
rights violations.
"Human rights being on the
agenda has never been a question
and will not go away," he said. "But
sometimes it is challenging because
we have to do what is most effective
for our overall range of interests."
Audience questions also cov
ered more practical aspects of
working for the State Department,
including learning new languages
and specializing in geographic re
gions.
"New policies encourage offi
cers to have experience in two re
gions so they are not diffused too
much and have a better under
standing of those regions," Cas
sayre said. "But signing up for
worldwide availability is part of the
adventure of the job."
The event was sponsored by the
Stanford Military Service Network.

and diplomatic instruction.
"Frankly I have not had an issue
of defending a policy that I disagree
with," Cassayre said. "Until you are

very senior, you don't have to de
fend a wide range of issues but
rather focus on a set of issues that
you are an expert in. They usually
aren't very controversial."
"Within the organization, you
have a voice and ways to share your
opinions," he added.
Cassayre also discussed the role
of human rights in diplomacy, and
the corresponding ability of diplo
macy to raise awareness of human
rights violations.
"Human rights being on the
agenda has never been a question
and will not go away," he said. "But
sometimes it is challenging because
we have to do what is most effective
for our overall range of interests."
Audience questions also cov
ered more practical aspects of
working for the State Department,
including learning new languages
and specializing in geographic re
gions.
"New policies encourage offi
cers to have experience in two re
gions so they are not diffused too
much and have a better under
standing of those regions," Cas
sayre said. "But signing up for
worldwide availability is part of the
adventure of the job."
The event was sponsored by the
Stanford Military Service Network.

Mark Cassayre, a career State Department diplomat and a current
national security affairs fellow at the Hoover Institution, discussed cooperation
between the military and civilian diplomats Wednesday afternoon.
"Diplomacy is difficult because
you do not always achieve what
you want and there is constant ten
sion on how to protect your own in
terests while working with the in
terests of the other country," said
Mark Cassayre, a career U.S. diplo
mat and a current national security
affairs fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, speaking at the Haas Center
on Wednesday afternoon.
Cassayre's talk was titled, "Na
tional Security: Cooperation be
tween Diplomats and the Military."
In addition to addressing the rela
tionship between the U.S. Depart
ment of State and the military, he
branched out to discuss general
policy issues and practical aspects
of a foreign service career.
Prior to arriving at Stanford,
Cassayre worked for the State De
partment in Kenya, Ukraine,
Namibia, and Switzerland. Most re
cently, he served as the political
counselor to the U.S. Mission to the
United Nations in Geneva, which
required working with agencies
such as the U.N. Human Rights
Council, the World Health Organi
zation and the International Labor
Organization.
Cassayre began his talk by giv
ing a background of the State De
partment, including its history and
organizational structure, before
delving into how and why he be
came involved.
"I grew up in Napa, California
and did not have a lot of exposure
to diplomats and international af
fairs," he said. "But I always had an
interest in languages and studying
abroad."
Cassayre then listed and ex
plained the responsibilities of a
state official, which he said include
protecting U.S citizens abroad and
promoting U.S interests in areas
such as trade and democracy.
Shifting the focus of the talk to
the relationship between the State
Department and the military, he
pointed out that there are 100 de
fense personnel for every State De
partment employee,
"People talk about diplomacy
being our first line of defense," he
joked. "Well, it is obviously not a
very thick or deep line,"
Even though Cassayre stated
"we [the State Department and the

military] coordinate closely on a
day to day basis," he highlighted the
key challenge of the different ways
in which both institutions divide
world regions for operations.
Additionally, he noted that both
groups "do have very different cul
tures, backgrounds and training
methods."
Despite these obstacles, Cas
sayre said, "The overarching theme
of my experience is that there is a
need for military and State to work
together." He cited Afghanistan
and Pakistan as examples of places
where "it is essential we work hand
in glove for programs to be effec
tive on the ground."
"Some projects cannot achieve
their objectives without coordina
tion with the military," he said, cit
ing his work in the Ukraine de
stroying old armaments as an ex
ample of essential collaboration.
"We try our best to make this an
inter-agency process to make sure
all entities are represented and at
the table in order to organize a
good policy approach," he added.
Cassayre spent the second half
of the event in an open discussion
with participants. One audience
member posed a question on the
balance between private beliefs
and diplomatic instruction.
"Frankly I have not had an issue
of defending a policy that I disagree

very senior, you don't have to de
fend a wide range of issues but

macy to raise awareness of human
