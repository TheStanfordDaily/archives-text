## WEAVING FICTION INTO FACT Adam Johnson untangles his life's narrative 
### JENNY THAI DESK EDITOR 
Unlike most offices in the Eng
lish Department, the furni
ture's centerpiece is not a
heavy desk. Rather, Adam
Johnson's office is spacious,
with ceiling-high bookshelves crammed
with an eclectic assortment of books. Big
Godzilla and dinosaur action figures
toys to amuse Johnson's children line
the tops of the bookshelves. With the two
enormous armchairs, a coffee table topped
with more books and a desktop computer
tucked away in a corner, Johnson's office
reflects his dedication to his two life call
ings: creative writing and family.
Named "one of the nation's most influ
ential and imaginative college professors"
by Playboy, Johnson is an associate profes
sor of English with an emphasis in creative
writing. He is also a Whiting Writers' Award
recipient. His fiction has appeared in publi
cations including Harper's, The Paris Re
view and "Best American Short Stories"
and Random House published his most re
cent novel, "The Orphan Master's Son," in
January of this year.
Johnson was born in South Dakota and
raised in Arizona. From an early age, he cul
tivated a probing sensibility to understand
ing the world around him. In his early child
hood, Johnson's favorite place was the
Phoenix Zoo. His father, a zoo night watch
man, would take his son out on evening ex
cursions to see the animals. It was from
these excursions that Johnson developed a
growing awareness of the depth and multi
layered nature of stories.
"I developed a sense really early on that
there was a behind-the-scenes to every
thing, that people who came to the zoo saw
one zoo but my father had the keys to the
backrooms where ... you could see the an
imals in different behaviors," Johnson said.
"That had a very big influence on me as a
writer, that just behind the veil of anything
was a richer, truer, more human story."
In addition to the animals he interacted
with at the zoo, desert tortoises, a Cayman
alligator and a seven-foot-long boa were
just a few creatures that lived at home with
Johnson. His memories of his early child
hood days are filled with these animals.
"We had every animal you could imag
ine," Johnson said. "People would leave
them, intending them to go to the zoo but
when someone left an African gray parrot.
.. my dad would bring that thing home."
Johnson's animal adventure days were
brought to a close when his parents di
vorced and Johnson moved to live with his
mother. His mother, a psychologist strug
gling to establish her practice, worked long
hours, leaving Johnson to roam independ
ently. An only child and a latchkey kid,
Johnson spent most of his free time wan
dering the alleys of the neighborhood. One
of his favorite pastimes was investigating
the contents of people's dumpsters, an ac
tivity driven by his early interest in stories
behind "the veil" of the everyday.
"I would look at all of the trash that was
in there and I would try to figure out who
lived in that house by what they threw
away," Johnson said. "Like what kind of
family they were" ... everything seemed
like a treasure to me."
After finishing high school at age seven
teen, Johnson made his foray into commer
cial industrial construction for several
years, working on projects including an air
separation plant, the 1-10 freeway and a
parking garage at a mall.
"I still love concrete ... that you can
form and shore up this liquid and turn it
into something of such permanence," John
son said. "I still like going by buildings in
Arizona and saying, 'Hey ... it's still there,
it didn't fall down yet.'"
Construction work also opened Johnson
up to a world of new stories.
"Those jobs in the late 'Bos were just
filled with characters, you know, guys who
were just out of jail,people on leave,people
who traveled the world," Johnson said.
"[Hie Vietnam vets] had hair-raising and
hilarious stories about their military service
and stories of great compassion. These

were guys that lived outside normal society,
on the margins, by their own codes."
Part Sioux, Johnson reflected on story
telling as a valued skill in his family and
local community. For Johnson's family, the
truthfulness of a story was less important
than conveying a certain value or essence
of humanity.
"I remember that no one ever asked
whether a story was true or not," Johnson
said. "They would tell tall tales and legends
right up beside personal stories. One would
be clearly mythical and impossible and the
other very personal, but they coexisted."
The murky boundary in Johnson's work
reflects his rejection of nonfiction and fic
tion as mutually exclusive.
"I think my fiction is really infused with
true life and my nonfiction is infused with
myth, too," he said. "It's hard for me to sep
arate the two."
In fact, Johnson's penchant for blending
fiction and fact in his writing became an ob
stacle during his undergraduate years at
Arizona State University, where he studied
journalism. Much to the exasperation of his
journalism professors, Johnson had the no
torious habit of creatively producing his
own quotes.
"They could always tell when I lied,"
Johnson said. "I always felt that there was
some truth that I perceived that I could not
get a quote for or verify with some facts,
and so I'd make something up. I'd make up
a quote that captured the experience that I
felt I had."
Johnson's tendency to invent or exag
gerate was also spurred on by his desire to
augment the positive aspects of life,
"If I found a 10 dollar bill on the ground,
I could go to my friends and tell them that I
found twelve dollars," he said. "It was some
urge to make the good rare things in life
even better somehow."
Finding the truth-driven world of jour
nalism too limiting a field for his wild imag
ination, Johnson found his life's calling jun
ior year when he took his first creative writ
ing class.
"It was one of my few epiphanies in life

Telling a story is such a noble endeavor that nothing, I believe,
could ever be a failure.

... I just loved it," he said. "I knew this was
the missing thing."
Writing seeped in and consumed John
son's day-to-day life, often overtaking his
social time with friends. For Johnson
though, this was not at all a high price to pay
creative writing gave him the freedom
and exploration of the stories he had been
fascinated with his entire life.
"Fiction, or probably just writing, allows
you to be better than you are," he said. "You
spend weeks crafting this story, on your
own, orchestrating it, composing it, making
everything perfect."
Although many of Johnson's stories are
infused with a bizarre blend of the super
natural and fantastical, writing fiction re
mains a deeply personal process for him.
His first novel, "Parasites Like Us," a story
involving a dog and bird apocalypse, was in
fluenced by Johnson's family story in South
Dakota.
Johnson's latest novel, "The Orphan
Master's Son," tells the journey of a North
Korean professional kidnapper. The novel
was the product of Johnson's six years of re
search and drafting, which included a six
day visit to Pyongyang.
Despite the several years of research he
had completed, Johnson was taken aback
by the rigidity and strangeness of a country
that is completely censored.
"I knew exactly what to expect there
physically ... but nothing can prepare you
psychologically for a world without spon
taneity, a world of complete order and con
formity," Johnson said.
With his linebacker build and impres
sive stature, Johnson stuck out in the North
Korean crowd. However, he found the psy
chological lash of being ignored out of fear
unsettling.
"I stand out visually," he said. "One of
the more unusual things they see that day, or
that week ... [but] they wouldn't even look
at me. The safe bet for them was to pretend
that I didn't exist. I felt transparent."
"You really feel people weigh every
thing they say ahead of time for all possible
consequences," Johnson added. "You got

the sense of the way the people you've in
teracted [with] have digested censorship to
the degree that they are their own censors."
The oppressive atmosphere in North
Korea fueled Johnson's desire to individu
alize the people, to write a tale that not only
spoke of cruelty but also of compassion and
love,
Johnson said that warmth and strong
love from his wife and family have helped
him write tales of enduring hope more eas
ily. Speaking fondly of his wife, Johnson re
called their romantic plans to testify their
absolute faith and trust in each other, in
volving a "secret" wedding.
"We decided to get bulletproof vests ...
we got a pair of Olympic Match-22 pistols,
and we were going to Death Valley in the
desert and my wife and I were going to
shoot each other in the heart," Johnson
said.
The couple never managed to carry out
their secret wedding plans as right around
the planned date the infamous North Hol
lywood shootout an armed confronta
tion between two heavily armed bank rob
bers and officers of the Los Angeles Police
Department (LAPD) occurred. Years
later, with three children in tow, the couple
decided to abandon their secret wedding
plans.
For Johnson, his love for writing and
raising a family are linked together.
"Writing wasn't fun, but it was fulfilling,
which is what parenting turned out to be
like," Johnson said.
Despite his accomplishments, what ex
cites Johnson more than anything is to see
students craft new stories, regardless of tal
ent or skill.
"Telling a story is such a noble endeavor
that nothing, I believe, could ever be a fail
ure," Johnson said. "I love all stories and a
story that a student is writing, drafting in
manuscript form, is more rewarding than a
published story. The struggle is still there;
it's still in play. They're still discovering it.
The story is still becoming itself."
