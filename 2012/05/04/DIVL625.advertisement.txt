rate we may, at our option, change the rate charged on all loans pursuant to the loan agreement to the greater of the non-reduced rate in effect
when the loan was made or the non-reduced rate in effect on the date the qualifier service for each loan was terminated. When the rate increases
in this fashion, it has the effect of increasing the number of payments required to pay the balance in full. Applicants must have proof of income.
