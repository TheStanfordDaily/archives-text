The Reykjavik Forum:
Vision for Our World's Future
In October 1986, Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev met in Reykjavik,
Iceland to negotiate a limited nuclear arms reduction, Dramatically, they
abandoned the proposed agenda and opened an unprecedented discussion
exploring the elimination of all nuclear weapons.
What were Reagan and Gorbachev thinking for those brief hours
at Reykjavik?
What was in their hearts and what were their dreams for a new
world, a world without nuclear weapons?
Please join us for a performance of Reykjavik, a one-act play written by
Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Richard Rhodes, based on actual transcripts
of the dialogue between the two presidents. The play will be followed on
May 8 by a question-and-answer session with Richard Rhodes and Philip

be led by Charles Ferguson, President of the Federation of American Scientists.
Presented by the Federation of American Scientists, the Fund for Peace Initiatives, the Center tor
International Security and Cooperation, the Bowen H. McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society, and
