Stanford's Information Security Office Memo #l7
Use care when processing financial or
personal information on a laptop or any
other wireless device!
Wifi is easy to intercept and is easier than it
should be to decrypt.
□ If you're entering financial or personal
information on a website, make sure it is
encrypted (its name starts with 'https')
□ If you're accessing remote files, encrypt them or
ensure they have no private or financial
information
