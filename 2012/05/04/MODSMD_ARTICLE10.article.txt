## EDITORIAL Attacks on administration regarding suicide response unfair 
### 
In an op-ed last week, Stan
ford Daily deputy editor
Brendan O'Byrne 'l4 criti
cized Stanford's response to stu
dent suicide, writing, "The Uni
versity's failure to foster a cam
pus dialogue about mental
health or illness is appalling." In
addition, an ongoing series in
The Daily explores the Universi
ty's response in more detail,
identifying places for improve
ment. While the Editorial Board
agrees that more campus conver
sation about mental health is
needed, we question whether it is
appropriate to center the dia
logue around a tragic event.
It is certainly true that Stan
ford's campus culture is resistant
to discussion of mental health is
sues. Part of this, we believe, is due
to the way Stanford students like
to think of themselves laid
back, happy and in control. We
often joke about how superior
our culture is in comparison to
those unnamed "East Coast
schools," which some students see
as bastions of unhappiness. Yet in
defining ourselves according to
this binary, we also preclude a
meaningful conversation about
what it means to feel unhappy and
alone on a campus where every
one else seems to thrive.

Furthermore, O'Byrne's edi
torial ignores the fact that sui
cides occur in unique contexts,
and that the responses of admin
istrators at Harvard and Yale
were dictated by different cir
cumstances than those at Stan
ford. He neglects to mention the
fact that Sam Wopat's death oc
curred over spring break, a
rather difficult time to foster a
campus dialogue given that most
students are not on campus. In
addition, he makes the implicit
claim that sending out a campus
wide email is a necessary re
sponse, but the Editorial Board
questions whether or not this is

true. On a campus as large as
Stanford's, campus-wide emails
tend to foster more speculation
and gossip than they do mean
ingful dialogue (witness, for ex
ample, students' immature re
sponses to virtually every email
about a residential break-in).
Publicizing a tragic event is not
the same as creating meaningful
conversation. By framing the ad
ministration's response in such
an antagonistic way ("nothing
can excuse a weeklong silence"),
O'Byrne also fails to take into ac
count the formidable constraints
that administrators faced, includ
ing confidentiality, family wishes,
and a desire to allow Wopat's
friends a space to grieve free
from scrutiny.
Suicide is undoubtedly one of
the most difficult issues to discuss
on this campus, and there are
very real cultural and structural
barriers in place that prevent di
alogue from taking place. The
Editorial Board encourages
those who are frustrated by the
University's response to take
into consideration the limita
tions administrators face, rather
than portray them as insensitive,
callous or indifferent. By begin
ning a conversation on mental
health with the administration
instead of in opposition to them,
we as a Stanford community can
create the kind of change that
will help prevent future tragedies
and reduce the stigma of mental
health on campus.

It is imperative that Stanford
foster more discussion on mental
health defined broadly, yet many
of the op-eds that have emerged
in the wake of recent student
deaths have made that claim
without detailing how the Uni
versity should go about doing so.
Is better resident assistant train
ing the appropriate response?
Should more workshops take
place at New Student Orienta
tion (NSO) that direct students
toward mental health resources
on campus? Should all freshmen
have one required meeting with
a CAPS counselor in addition to
their academic advisor? Focus
ing on tangible improvements,
rather than levying broad claims
against the administration, is a
more feasible route toward
changing something as immense
as campus culture.
