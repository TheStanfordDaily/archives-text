# EXISTENTIAL FORTUNE COOKIES
## Tipsy Tuesdays 
### Sebastain Gould 
One of the great things
about observing other
people is that you can
learn a lot about yourself. This
week, I spent a sliver of Tuesday
night sitting in my car talking with
my fiancee while people-watch
ing. The car was parked in the
dark, and none of the passers-by
had any idea that we were there.
Apparently there had been some
sort of off-campus party. Mar
guerite shuttle after Marguerite
shuttle dropped off tipsy students,
and they stumbled past our car.
Some were wearing costumes,
others were dressed for the cold
weather. Most just seemed lost.
There were two pairs though, that
stuck out, and I'd like to focus on
them to show you how I have
changed over my time here at
Stanford.

The first person to really set
herself apart from the crowd was
a drunk girl who vomited repeat
edly while walking with her
friend. She slowed very little when
she started heaving, and the two
joked about it. When we saw this
transpire, we of course wondered
if she would be all right and, at the
same time, were surprised that she
could continue to walk while
vomiting; we surmised that she
had practice at it. As the girls
walked off, I couldn't help but
wonder why she hadn't put her
hair up or in a pony tail. After all, if

you are going to puke, you don't
want to get it in your hair.
The second incident happened
as we got out of the car to walk
back to my dorm. There was a girl
sitting on the ground and another
male student near her. As we ap
proached, he got ready to urinate
on a BMW parked in the lot near
the street, but before he did, he
asked me if it was mine. At first, I
was startled that he was so polite.
I replied, "No, I drive a Ford." He
laughed at that and said, "A man's
car." At this I discontinued the
conversation because I didn't feel

If you're going
to puke, you don't
want to get it
in your hair.

that I could claim anything about
the heteronormativity of driving
a 37-year-old American-made
pickup truck. Something about the
situation made me wonder about
myself and the way I reacted,
though. It was more than his po
liteness and the fact that I was tired
and the fact that it really wasn't my
car that made me not care at all. I
am a different person now than I
was when I came here; I'm more
used to absurd things like that.
My freshman year, a group of
upperclassmen were walking past
my dorm on their way to a frat
party as I was returning from Late
Nite. One of the men asked the
others to hold up as he relieved
himself, and, as they stopped, an
other joined him in urinating on
the wall of my dorm. I took imme

diate offense and called the police
to report the indecency. They
asked if anyone was hurt or in
jured, and I told them no. At that
point, the operator sounded less
interested and replied that some
one would be sent out to investi
gate, and of course, no one came.
Presumably, they had better
things to do than go looking for
people who urinate on residences.
At the time, I felt that nothing
in the world could be more im
portant than stopping them from
urinating on my building, but
after several years of elevators
and dorms and stairwells at Stan
ford that smell of urine, I have be
come numb to it. It still offends
me when someone urinates on an
inanimate object in front of me,
but I no longer think about doing
anything about it. In many ways, I
felt the same way when my locked
bike was stolen last week in front
of my dorm. It was just one more
instance of inappropriate behav
ior that I can do nothing to stop.

What we can do though, if we
still find some things inappropri
ate despite seeing them repeated
so many times, is to not repeat
those behaviors ourselves. When
you go out, set the example for
your friends. Don't drink so much
that you vomit or, if you must, at
least put your hair up so it won't
get dirty. Don't steal bikes. Don't
steal phones. Don't take anything
that doesn't belong to you; in fact,
go so far as to return things that
you find. I cannot even remember
the number of lost phones that
I've returned to owners. Each and
every one of us can help make
campus better, but don't get too
discouraged if you witness some
thing objectionable or if you lose
something. As my good friend
Cameron Smith always says:
"Don't take life too seriously!"

Have you ever returned a lost
phone to its rightful owner? Tell Se
bastain about it at sjgould@stan

I replied, "No, I drive a Ford." He
laughed at that and said, "A man's
car." At this I discontinued the
conversation because I didn't feel

that I could claim anything about
the heteronormativity of driving
a 37-year-old American-made
pickup truck. Something about the
situation made me wonder about
myself and the way I reacted,
though. It was more than his po
liteness and the fact that I was tired
and the fact that it really wasn't my
car that made me not care at all. I
am a different person now than I
was when I came here; I'm more
used to absurd things like that.
My freshman year, a group of
upperclassmen were walking past
my dorm on their way to a frat
party as I was returning from Late
Nite. One of the men asked the
others to hold up as he relieved
himself, and, as they stopped, an
other joined him in urinating on
the wall of my dorm. I took imme

diate offense and called the police
to report the indecency. They
asked if anyone was hurt or in
jured, and I told them no. At that
point, the operator sounded less
interested and replied that some
one would be sent out to investi
gate, and of course, no one came.
Presumably, they had better
things to do than go looking for
people who urinate on residences.
At the time, I felt that nothing
in the world could be more im
portant than stopping them from
urinating on my building, but
after several years of elevators
and dorms and stairwells at Stan
ford that smell of urine, I have be
come numb to it. It still offends
me when someone urinates on an
inanimate object in front of me,
but I no longer think about doing
anything about it. In many ways, I
felt the same way when my locked
bike was stolen last week in front
of my dorm. It was just one more
instance of inappropriate behav
ior that I can do nothing to stop.

What we can do though, if we
still find some things inappropri
ate despite seeing them repeated
so many times, is to not repeat
those behaviors ourselves. When
you go out, set the example for
your friends. Don't drink so much
that you vomit or, if you must, at
least put your hair up so it won't
get dirty. Don't steal bikes. Don't
steal phones. Don't take anything
that doesn't belong to you; in fact,
go so far as to return things that
you find. I cannot even remember
the number of lost phones that
I've returned to owners. Each and
every one of us can help make
campus better, but don't get too
discouraged if you witness some
thing objectionable or if you lose
something. As my good friend
Cameron Smith always says:
"Don't take life too seriously!"

One of the great things
about observing other
people is that you can
learn a lot about yourself. This
week, I spent a sliver of Tuesday
night sitting in my car talking with
my fiancee while people-watch
ing. The car was parked in the
dark, and none of the passers-by
had any idea that we were there.
Apparently there had been some
sort of off-campus party. Mar
guerite shuttle after Marguerite
shuttle dropped off tipsy students,
and they stumbled past our car.
Some were wearing costumes,
others were dressed for the cold
weather. Most just seemed lost.
There were two pairs though, that
stuck out, and I'd like to focus on
them to show you how I have
changed over my time here at
Stanford.

The first person to really set
herself apart from the crowd was
a drunk girl who vomited repeat
edly while walking with her
friend. She slowed very little when
she started heaving, and the two
joked about it. When we saw this
transpire, we of course wondered
if she would be all right and, at the
same time, were surprised that she
could continue to walk while
vomiting; we surmised that she
had practice at it. As the girls
walked off, I couldn't help but
wonder why she hadn't put her
hair up or in a pony tail. After all, if

you are going to puke, you don't
want to get it in your hair.
The second incident happened
as we got out of the car to walk
back to my dorm. There was a girl
sitting on the ground and another
male student near her. As we ap
proached, he got ready to urinate
on a BMW parked in the lot near
the street, but before he did, he
asked me if it was mine. At first, I
was startled that he was so polite.
I replied, "No, I drive a Ford." He
laughed at that and said, "A man's
car." At this I discontinued the
conversation because I didn't feel
