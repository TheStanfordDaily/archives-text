# EXISTENTIAL FORTUNE COOKIES
## Tipsy Tuesdays 
### Sebastain Gould 
One of the great things
about observing other
people is that you can
learn a lot about yourself. This
week, I spent a sliver of Tuesday
night sitting in my car talking with
my fiancee while people-watch
ing. The car was parked in the
dark, and none of the passers-by
had any idea that we were there.
Apparently there had been some
sort of off-campus party. Mar
guerite shuttle after Marguerite
shuttle dropped off tipsy students,
and they stumbled past our car.
Some were wearing costumes,
others were dressed for the cold
weather. Most just seemed lost.
There were two pairs though, that
stuck out, and I'd like to focus on
them to show you how I have
changed over my time here at
Stanford.

The first person to really set
herself apart from the crowd was
a drunk girl who vomited repeat
edly while walking with her
friend. She slowed very little when
she started heaving, and the two
joked about it. When we saw this
transpire, we of course wondered
if she would be all right and, at the
same time, were surprised that she
could continue to walk while
vomiting; we surmised that she
had practice at it. As the girls
walked off, I couldn't help but
wonder why she hadn't put her
hair up or in a pony tail. After all, if

you are going to puke, you don't
want to get it in your hair.
The second incident happened
as we got out of the car to walk
back to my dorm. There was a girl
sitting on the ground and another
male student near her. As we ap
proached, he got ready to urinate
on a BMW parked in the lot near
the street, but before he did, he
asked me if it was mine. At first, I
was startled that he was so polite.
I replied, "No, I drive a Ford." He
laughed at that and said, "A man's
car." At this I discontinued the
conversation because I didn't feel

If you're going
to puke, you don't
want to get it
in your hair.
