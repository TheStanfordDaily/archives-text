## Save the last chance 
### Miriam Marks 
It's Week 5 of spring quarter. As
members of the senior and co
term class of 2012 continue to
go about our daily routines, a
strange realization is sinking in:
We're graduating. And we're
graduating pretty soon. We'll
never be Stanford undergrads
again. And although some of us
may return to campus as Univer
sity employees, graduate students
or Panda Express customers, it
just won't be the same.

Because our time as under
graduates is ending, everything
we do has acquired the new char
acteristic of being the "last" thing.
This spring becomes the last
spring, that midterm is now the
last midterm and Exotic Patriotic
is (probably) your last Exotic
Erotic. The knowledge that every
thing will soon end creates a sort
of frenzy: the Last Chance Syn
drome.

This obsession with the "last
ness" of everything is not neces
sarily a bad thing. It can be kind of
good when it motivates you, serv
ing as a friendly reminder: "Atten
tion: this is your last chance to try
[insert name of thing you haven't
done yet]!" For four years, every
one told you about everything
you should do at Stanford. And
for four years, you told yourself, "I
can do that some other time."

But the clock ticks particularly
fast by May of your senior year,
and suddenly the Last Chance
Syndrome catches hold. And
that's why, in the final days of
spring, you can see the masses of
seniors flock to the top of Hoover
Tower. After years of comment
ing on its phallic shape, they sud
denly realized that it was their last
chance to climb it, and off they
went. Other seniors made their

first-ever visits to The Dish, the
cactus garden and the elusive Thai
Cafe.

It's not only your last chance to
do things, but it's also your last
chance to see a lot of people. After
Stanford, your friends will scatter
across the world or, if you're co
terming, across Escondido Village
(pretty much the same thing). You
will lose them to high-paying jobs
and grueling graduate school pro
grams.

The pressure to meet up with
all those old friends is a common
aspect of Last Chance Syndrome,
Have you seen your freshman
year roommate in the past two
years? No? Better get lunch! Is it
time to tie up some loose ends
with your ex-girlfriend? With all
of your ex-girlfriends? Bring on
the coffee dates! After all, now's
your last chance.
This brings us to the bad out
comes of the Last Chance Syn
drome, because sometimes it
makes you do things you didn't
actually want to do again. Even
though you only fountain-hopped
once before, and even though you
didn't love the experience, you
suddenly realize that this is your
last chance to do it... a second
time.

Or maybe you find yourself
eating lunch with someone you
haven't seen in two years just be
cause you know you won't be able
to do it again. Is that a good
enough reason to do it? Ask your
self why you didn't see this person
during the past two years and
whether you genuinely enjoy
spending time with him/her.
Hopefully your answer to the sec
ond part is "yes."
It's annoying to constantly
question what you're doing, but

I've found that the worst symp
tom of the Last Chance Syndrome
is the constant pressure to have
the time of your life. Whether it's
the last supper or the last dance, it
has to be meaningful. And as time
grows ever more precious, each
activity is held to a higher and
higher standard. None of your
last-chance activities can possibly
afford to be anything less than ab
solutely awesome.
So as you walk the Dish for the
last time, as you stand in line for
an omelet at Wilbur, the nagging
thought remains, "Is this worthy
of being the last time? Am I hav
ing an awesome time right now?
What other awesome last things
should I be doing?!" The pressure
to cram a ton of meaningful last
things into a few short weeks
grows by the day.
The problem is that you may
not be having an awesome time
after all.

So seniors: if you didn't partic
ularly like that one student group
co-president of yours, don't feel
obligated to grab dinner. If you
hated the feeling of rubbing up
against 100 scantily clad, sweaty
bodies, then don't go to Exotic
Erotic. If you didn't love it the last
couple times, don't do it just be
cause it's the last one. Spend your
final undergrad moments doing
what you have loved at Stanford
and spend those moments with
the people you love as well.

Don't overt/link it, but this could be
the last time you send a message to
Miriam at melloram@stanford.

chance to climb it, and off they
went. Other seniors made their

first-ever visits to The Dish, the
cactus garden and the elusive Thai
Cafe.

It's not only your last chance to
do things, but it's also your last
chance to see a lot of people. After
Stanford, your friends will scatter
across the world or, if you're co
terming, across Escondido Village
(pretty much the same thing). You
will lose them to high-paying jobs
and grueling graduate school pro
grams.

The pressure to meet up with
all those old friends is a common
aspect of Last Chance Syndrome,
Have you seen your freshman
year roommate in the past two
years? No? Better get lunch! Is it
time to tie up some loose ends
with your ex-girlfriend? With all
of your ex-girlfriends? Bring on
the coffee dates! After all, now's
your last chance.
This brings us to the bad out
comes of the Last Chance Syn
drome, because sometimes it
makes you do things you didn't
actually want to do again. Even
though you only fountain-hopped
once before, and even though you
didn't love the experience, you
suddenly realize that this is your
last chance to do it... a second
time.

Or maybe you find yourself
eating lunch with someone you
haven't seen in two years just be
cause you know you won't be able
to do it again. Is that a good
enough reason to do it? Ask your
self why you didn't see this person
during the past two years and
whether you genuinely enjoy
spending time with him/her.
Hopefully your answer to the sec
ond part is "yes."
It's annoying to constantly
question what you're doing, but

I've found that the worst symp
tom of the Last Chance Syndrome
is the constant pressure to have
the time of your life. Whether it's
the last supper or the last dance, it
has to be meaningful. And as time
grows ever more precious, each
activity is held to a higher and
higher standard. None of your
last-chance activities can possibly
afford to be anything less than ab
solutely awesome.
So as you walk the Dish for the
last time, as you stand in line for
an omelet at Wilbur, the nagging
thought remains, "Is this worthy
of being the last time? Am I hav
ing an awesome time right now?
What other awesome last things
should I be doing?!" The pressure
to cram a ton of meaningful last
things into a few short weeks
grows by the day.
The problem is that you may
not be having an awesome time
after all.

So seniors: if you didn't partic
ularly like that one student group
co-president of yours, don't feel
obligated to grab dinner. If you
hated the feeling of rubbing up
against 100 scantily clad, sweaty
bodies, then don't go to Exotic
Erotic. If you didn't love it the last
couple times, don't do it just be
cause it's the last one. Spend your
final undergrad moments doing
what you have loved at Stanford
and spend those moments with
the people you love as well.

Don't overt/link it, but this could be
the last time you send a message to

It's Week 5 of spring quarter. As
members of the senior and co
term class of 2012 continue to
go about our daily routines, a
strange realization is sinking in:
We're graduating. And we're
graduating pretty soon. We'll
never be Stanford undergrads
again. And although some of us
may return to campus as Univer
sity employees, graduate students
or Panda Express customers, it
just won't be the same.

Because our time as under
graduates is ending, everything
we do has acquired the new char
acteristic of being the "last" thing.
This spring becomes the last
spring, that midterm is now the
last midterm and Exotic Patriotic
is (probably) your last Exotic
Erotic. The knowledge that every
thing will soon end creates a sort
of frenzy: the Last Chance Syn
drome.

This obsession with the "last
ness" of everything is not neces
sarily a bad thing. It can be kind of
good when it motivates you, serv
ing as a friendly reminder: "Atten
tion: this is your last chance to try
[insert name of thing you haven't
done yet]!" For four years, every
one told you about everything
you should do at Stanford. And
for four years, you told yourself, "I
can do that some other time."

But the clock ticks particularly
fast by May of your senior year,
and suddenly the Last Chance
Syndrome catches hold. And
that's why, in the final days of
spring, you can see the masses of
seniors flock to the top of Hoover
Tower. After years of comment
ing on its phallic shape, they sud
denly realized that it was their last
chance to climb it, and off they
went. Other seniors made their

first-ever visits to The Dish, the
cactus garden and the elusive Thai
Cafe.
