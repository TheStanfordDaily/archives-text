# OP-ED
## Why I support Israel, Palestine, and Divestment 
### MICHAEL CRUZ'12 ASSU President 
"When you have two alternatives,
the first thing you have to do is to
look for the third that you didn't
think about, that doesn't exist."

Shimon Peres,
President of Israel

In fall 2011, Students for Pales
tinian Equal Rights (SPER)
renewed its call to action with
a petition entitled, "Divestment
from Companies whose Direct

Violations of International Law
have an Injurious Impact on
Palestinians: Petition to the
Trustees of Stanford University."
As with each major issue that has
affected the Stanford community

from the Vietnam War, to
South African apartheid, to
ROTC this issue invariably
reached the office of the ASSU
Executive. Individuals and groups
from both sides of this debate
have approached me.
In order to best represent all
Stanford students, I felt that it was
my duty to read and educate my

self about this debate, in addition
to experiencing it myself, so that I
could form a detailed and well-re
searched opinion. In that spirit, I
agreed to be part of a student del
egation to Israel this past summer
(sponsored by the Israeli govern
ment), attended the 2012 Ameri
can Israel Public Affairs Commit
tee (AIPAC) Policy Conference
last quarter, and visited the op
posing OccupyAlPAC encamp
ment. Throughout these visits, I
continued to read various Middle
Eastern news sources (including
A1 Jazeera, Haaretz and the
Jerusalem Post) to stay abreast of
current events in the region.
Over the past six months, I have
read and re-read the petition,
met with many members of the
Stanford community, and done
my own independent research.
Of course, one can never stop
learning about a topic as deep as
Israel-Palestine, but I do believe
that I have now formed a de
tailed and well-researched opin
ion.

Stanford is not removed from
this debate; rather, our invest
ments are actively serving to per
petuate this conflict, which
harms all parties in the region.
Stanford and its investments
have a real impact in Israel-
Palestine politically, socially,
and economically. For example,
Stanford's investments in Cater
pillar Inc. mean that we are di
rectly complicit in the unlawful
destruction and demolition of
Palestinian property to allow the
construction of Israeli settle
ments and Israeli-only roads.

These activities are considered
illegal by the Fourth Geneva
Convention, as affirmed by the
U.N. Security Council. In short,
our investments are not serving
the interests of the Israeli or
Palestinian people; rather, we are
merely helping to intensify this
conflict, and result in greater
profit to these firms. The contin
uation of the conflict in Israel-
Palestine does not serve the in
terests of Jews or Muslims; in
stead, the continuing debate has
merely served to oppress many,
worsen Israel's image, and divide
the international community. As
a community, we must seek and
demand a long-lasting peace.
Ultimately, this petition is not
radical, extreme, or anti-Semitic;
this petition is pro-justice, pro
peace, and based on the ap
proved Stanford model of invest
ment responsibility. The petition
calls for a specific action for a
specific purpose to divest
from companies engaged in un
ethical actions, ensuring that we
fulfill our legal and ethical obliga
tions to persons outside Stanford.
While there may be other
modes of engaging in dialogue
many of which I greatly admire,
such as the Seeds of Change proj
ect and the Peres Center for
Peace I believe that this peti

tion acts as an additional push to
wards true peace and justice for
all peoples. All peoples regard
less of race, ethnicity, or creed
have a right to self-determina
tion. No single initiative will cre
ate a lasting peace; it is only if we
stand together, to promote all
human rights, that true peace
might come to the Middle East.
Citing University policy, care
fully tailoring the issue to the
Stanford case, and levying charges
against those most responsible,
this petition is deeply pro-peace,
pro-dialogue and pro-Stanford.
Having seen the power imbalance
in Israel, I believe that this peti
tion strictly seeks to force those at
fault which includes leaders
across the international political
spectrum to engage in real and
lasting dialogue, designed to cre
ate a long-term solution in the
Middle East that respects the
equally legitimate narratives of
Palestinians and Israelis.

As President Peres stated, we
must find a third solution to this
crisis. I believe that this petition
can help start that search. For
these reasons, I sign this petition
and urge my fellow Stanford com
munity members to do the same.
