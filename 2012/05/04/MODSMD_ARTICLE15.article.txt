# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## Finding Flora 
### 
To the Editor:
For several years our Stanford
neighborhood had a faithful com
panion Flora, the Roman goddess
of spring. She guided visitors to
our campus home at 511 Gerona
Rd. Flora was a solid member of
our community greeting people
who met her on their walks or

while jogging.
Alas, at the beginning of the
winter break (2011-2012), Flora
wandered off. We are hoping that
someone might have spotted her
at some nearby location. Perhaps
she went off in search of a livelier
venue, and we fear that her wan
derings might have brought her to
a place where she experiences
some of the less admirable or
at least less serene aspects of
campus life.

If you happen to know her
whereabouts, we would be very
grateful if you help her make a
safe return to her perch. The
members of our neighborhood
and our family will be very grate
ful to have her back. We are sure
she benefitted from some new ex
periences, but in the end there is
no place like home.
Sincerely,
BRIAN A. WANDELL
Stein Family Professor
