## ON THE MOVE NO. 7 CARD SQUARES OFF AGAINST BEAVERS 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
At this point of the season, the mission is
simple for the No. 7 Stanford baseball team:
three games to gain, four weeks to go.
And though the Cardinal (28-12,10-8 Pac
-12) will play the last month of its conference
season against the bottom half of the Pac-12,
a major slip-up this weekend at No. 20 Ore
gon State (28-14,9-9) would all but end Stan
ford's chance of winning the best conference
in college baseball, which it was a near-unan
imous favorite to capture in the preseason.
With No. 12 Oregon and No. 16 Arizona
going head-to-head in Tucson this weekend,
the Cardinal will be the beneficiary of some
top-tier infighting that could draw it closer to
the respective first and second-place teams in
the Pac-12. But the Beavers lurk just one
game behind Stanford and three-and-a-half
out of first place, so there's going to be a lot at
stake for everyone involved in the three
game set starting tonight in Corvallis.
Having won its last two Pac-12 series
against squads that have better conference
records than Oregon State, the Cardinal has
the momentum it needs for a big weekend to
make up for a frustrating start to conference
play. The Beavers had a much streakier
month of April than Stanford, being swept at
Arizona State a team that lost all three
games to the Cardinal at Sunken Diamond
before winning four straight against the likes
of No. 14 UCLA, Oregon and USC. Losses to
the unranked Trojans last Saturday and Sun
day, however, have left the Beavers plenty to
think about before the Cardinal comes to
town, with no midweek game on their sched
ule last week.
Stanford players must be shaking their
own heads after Tuesday's perplexing 8-5 loss
at San Jose State. The only team to top the
Cardinal in a midweek contest this year, the
Spartans went a perfect 2-0 on Tuesdays
against Stanford last month, most recently
roughing up freshman righty John Hochstat
ter for three first-inning runs before Cardinal
pitching could even record an out.
Hochstatter's fall from early-season grace
has paved the way for sophomore
righthander A.J. Vanegas to claim the Sunday
starter spot, and he has given up just under
one hit per inning in his last two weekend
starts. Vanegas (3-0, 2.77 ERA) will be the
likely choice to go up against fellow sopho
more righty Dan Child (4-3,2.65) this Sunday
as well.
As always, Stanford will have stalwart jun
ior righty Mark Appel on the hill for the Fri
day opener. Appel is averaging nearly eight
innings and as many strikeouts per start, with
opponents hitting just .218 against the future
first-round draft pick. On the other hand, the

Cardinal will be looking for redshirt junior
lefthander Brett Mooneyham to break out of
a midseason slump, as he has now allowed 14
runs in as many frames over the last three
weekends, going 0-2 over that stretch.
Statistically, Oregon State's Friday-Satur
day rotation of lefties Ben Wetzler and Jace
Fry doesn't stand out against some of its elite
Pac-12 counterparts. The Beavers' 3.48 team
ERA puts them squarely in the middle of the
11-team league, and the squad ranked sev
enth in the Pac-12 in both hits (8.82) and
walks (3.44) allowed per nine innings as of
last Sunday.
But the Beavers do boast one of the best
hitters in the conference in freshman phenom
Michael Comforto. The leftfielder is hitting
.356 and has driven in 54 runs this season, tied
for fourth best in the country and the highest
total for a freshman, though he went just 1-
for-6 at the plate in Oregon State's two losses
last weekend.
Stanford has gotten its own fair share of
underclassman production in recent weeks,

though freshman third baseman Alex Blandi
no has gone a bit cold after a .563 week in late
April that earned him National Player of the
Week honors from National Collegiate
Baseball. Sophomore Austin Wilson, on the
other hand, has been on a tear, and two home
runs against the Spartans made it four long
balls in the last five games for the rightfield
er.
The one area in which the Cardinal will
have trouble matching up is defense, with the
Beavers recording three double plays for
every two by Stanford and ranking 44th in the
country in fielding percentage. The Cardinal
is over 100 spots lower in that category,
though many of those errors came during that
troubling stretch at the start of Pac-12 play.
In the weeks since the squad lost sopho
more shortstop Lonnie Kauppila for the sea
son to injury and head coach Mark Marquess
had to shift his infield around, there haven't
been many of the fielding problems you

Sophomore Brett Michael Doran (above) and the No. 7 Stanford baseball squad prepares to
face No. 20 Oregon State in Corvallis this weekend. The Cardinal is currently sitting at fourth
in the Pac-12 standings, but has four weeks left to gain ground in the close conference race.
might expect from the relatively
inexperienced lineup. But Stan
ford committed three errors
all in the infield in that Tues
day loss at San Jose State, so de
fense will continue to be of partic
ular emphasis for this team going
forward.

When all is said and done, the

Cardinal likely won't be in first
place in the Pac-12 come Monday
but Stanford has a good chance to
leapfrog No. 14 UCLA, which is
just a half-game ahead in third
place and traveling to Seattle this
weekend to face Washington.
Tonight's opener at Goss Sta
dium in Corvallis is set for 5:35
p.m., and the Saturday and Sun
day games will both start at 1:05
p.m.
