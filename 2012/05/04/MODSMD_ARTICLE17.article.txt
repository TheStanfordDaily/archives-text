# A
						DAY IN THE LIFE OF BRADLEY KLAHN
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
It's 9:30 a.m. on a cool
Thursday morning, and
Bradley Klahn is setting
out traffic cones on a ten
nis court.
"My serve's been such a
rollercoaster lately," he says,
placing 10 cones from left to
right across the service line, five
in each box.
Klahn, the 2010 NCAA men's
singles tennis champion and the
number one player on the Stan
ford men's tennis team, is prepar
ing for the upcoming NCAA
championship next week.
His third serve smacks the red
cone in the left service box,
knocking it off the court.
"The problem with the big
cones is, if I hit the top of them,
the serve's going out," he says.
The senior from Poway, Calif.,
is used to balancing his prodi
gious tennis career and school,
but now, it's all tennis, all the
time. Six feet tall, dressed from
head to toe in red and black dri
fit, the economics major graduat
ed from school in the winter and
now spends his days preparing
for the final hurrah of his college
career and the beginning of
his budding professional career.
The lefty pulls a serve and
smacks a cone in the wrong serv
ice box.
"Aw, that doesn't count."
Now, the only thing on
Klahn's schedule is to play ten
nis, practice tennis, work out and
rehab sometimes for 12 hours
a day. Most days, he rises at 6:30
and goes to bed before 11.
"Without any schoolwork, I

go to bed a lot earlier. Trying to
get on a more professional rou
tine, I guess."
He finds his rhythm when he
switches to the other side of the
baseline, hitting three cones in
rapid succession.
"Target practice," he says.
This year's NCAA title is in
Athens, Ga., the site of Klahn's
2010 singles win, where he
crushed Louisville's Austin
Childs, 6-1, 6-2, in the final to
capture a championship ring.
Those memories and his
memories after from the 2011
NCAA tournament in front of a
rowdy home crowd at Stanford
drive him to wake up and hit
ball after ball every morning.
"The [2Oll quarterfinal]
match against Texas A&M was a
wild one ... that was fun. [The
semifinal match against] Virginia
was fun too. Virginia was the
most absurd thing I've ever seen,
let alone been a part of."
"And I can't say I've got bad
memories [about Athens] after
winning there," he adds.
However, if Klahn hopes to
add a championship coda to his
days at Stanford, he'll have to
overcome his two nemeses this
season: USC and a balky back.
The Trojans have won three
consecutive team titles behind
the powerful play of senior Steve
Johnson, last year's NCAA sin
gles champion, who is riding a
60-match winning streak coming
into the tournament.
"He's been a lock. They're al
ways starting 2-0 in every match,
or at least 1-0," Klahn says. The
No. 1 Trojans also captured the

time to preparing for the upcoming NCAA
championship, after having graduated in the

hopes to end his illustrious career on a strong note.
