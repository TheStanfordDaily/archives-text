# Playoff still not perfect
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
The college sports powers
that-be have spoken, and
they have decided that a sin
gle Final Four in late March
and early April just isn't
enough.
That's why they're adding another
one in the first week of January.
After the commissioners of the 11
Football Bowl Subdivision confer
ences (and separatist Notre Dame's
athletics director) met last week to de
cide what will become of the BCS, they
finally determined to install a four
team playoff in college football. It's un
clear if the current BCS ranking system
will be used to select the top four teams,
but by 2014, we're going to have a play
off, whether you like it or not.
As a good Pac-12 football fan, the
first words out of your mouth should
be: What about the Rose Bowl?
How existing bowls BCS and
otherwise will be integrated into
the new system still remains to be seen.
One popular model is that the semifi
nal bowls will be determined by the
conference of the No. 1 and No. 2
teams; that is, if Stanford finished first
in the country (Barry J. Sanders for
Heisman in 2014, anyone?), it would
play in the Rose Bowl against the four
seed, and if LSU finished second, it
would play in the Sugar Bowl against
the three-seed.
So the Pac-12's chance of being
represented in the Rose Bowl isn't
seismically better or worse, it's just...
different. As of now, pretty much the
only way a Pac-12 team isn't included
in the Rose Bowl is if the conference
champion plays in the national title
game and there isn't a BCS-eligible
squad from the conference to fill the
void. The one exception was in 2005,
when No. IUSC went to the champi
onship game and No. 5 Texas got the
Rose-Bowl nod over No. 4 Cal (not
that I have any sympathy).
Under the proposed system, a Pac
-12 team would get to play in the Rose
Bowl if it was ranked No. 1, and the
same would be true for No. 2 as long as
a Big Ten team hadn't already claimed
the bid with the top ranking. But a Pac
-12 team won't be playing in Pasadena
if it finishes out of the top-two and the
Big Ten does, except for the off chance
that the 1 -4/2-3 seedings match up per
fectly to put a Big Ten and Pac-12
squad in the same game. There is, how
ever, some talk of giving slightly lower
ranked conference champions a
chance to play in the Final Four to help
maintain tradition.
So, at first glance, there doesn't
seem to be anything particularly offen
sive about the four-team playoff plan.
Then again, the BCS didn't seem all
that bad before it was marred by years
of controversial bowl selections.
Fairness will always take center
stage, but my main concern has always
gotten way less air-time than it de
serves. By adding an extra game, we're
continuing down the slippery slope of
extending the season further and fur
ther. What was at most a 12-game
schedule 20 years ago —ll regular
season contests and a bowl will now
be a 15-game monstrosity for two
teams, who have to go through hard
fought conference title games, the
semifinal bowls and the national
championship.
Since the SEC became the first
conference that crowned its winner
with a championship game in 1992,
players have consistently been asked
to put their bodies on the line more fre
quently. The proliferation of the con
ference postseason, the addition of a
12th regular-season game in 2006 and
the increase in the number of bowl
games all contribute to wear and tear
on the athletes, especially those in
high-pressure situations.
Injuries add up over a career
just ask Chris Owusu, whose three
concussions over 13 months nearly
ended his playing time on the Farm
and could sideline him permanently.
And when the two teams in the nation
al title game are asked to play nearly a
full NFL schedule, the clock starts tick
ing much faster for a bunch of players'
careers.
At the end of the day, a four-team
playoff seems like a decent compro
mise between the current system and
larger, eight- or sixteen-team propos
als. But ensuring that we crown the
"rightful" national champion comes at
a price, and when critics of the new sys
tem inevitably start advocating for
larger playoff fields in a few years'
time, we need to keep in mind that by
playing more games, we may be asking
just too much of college athletes

team playoff system just yet. Give him

if it finishes out of the top-two and the
Big Ten does, except for the off chance
that the 1 -4/2-3 seedings match up per
fectly to put a Big Ten and Pac-12
squad in the same game. There is, how
ever, some talk of giving slightly lower
ranked conference champions a
chance to play in the Final Four to help
maintain tradition.
So, at first glance, there doesn't
seem to be anything particularly offen
sive about the four-team playoff plan.
Then again, the BCS didn't seem all
that bad before it was marred by years
of controversial bowl selections.
Fairness will always take center
stage, but my main concern has always
gotten way less air-time than it de
serves. By adding an extra game, we're
continuing down the slippery slope of
extending the season further and fur
ther. What was at most a 12-game
schedule 20 years ago —ll regular
season contests and a bowl will now
be a 15-game monstrosity for two
teams, who have to go through hard
fought conference title games, the
semifinal bowls and the national
championship.
Since the SEC became the first
conference that crowned its winner
with a championship game in 1992,
players have consistently been asked
to put their bodies on the line more fre
quently. The proliferation of the con
ference postseason, the addition of a
12th regular-season game in 2006 and
the increase in the number of bowl
games all contribute to wear and tear
on the athletes, especially those in
high-pressure situations.
Injuries add up over a career
just ask Chris Owusu, whose three
concussions over 13 months nearly
ended his playing time on the Farm
and could sideline him permanently.
And when the two teams in the nation
al title game are asked to play nearly a
full NFL schedule, the clock starts tick
ing much faster for a bunch of players'
careers.
At the end of the day, a four-team
playoff seems like a decent compro
mise between the current system and
larger, eight- or sixteen-team propos
als. But ensuring that we crown the
"rightful" national champion comes at
a price, and when critics of the new sys
tem inevitably start advocating for
larger playoff fields in a few years'
time, we need to keep in mind that by
playing more games, we may be asking
just too much of college athletes

The college sports powers
that-be have spoken, and
they have decided that a sin
gle Final Four in late March
and early April just isn't
enough.
That's why they're adding another
one in the first week of January.
After the commissioners of the 11
Football Bowl Subdivision confer
ences (and separatist Notre Dame's
athletics director) met last week to de
cide what will become of the BCS, they
finally determined to install a four
team playoff in college football. It's un
clear if the current BCS ranking system
will be used to select the top four teams,
but by 2014, we're going to have a play
off, whether you like it or not.
As a good Pac-12 football fan, the
first words out of your mouth should
be: What about the Rose Bowl?
How existing bowls BCS and
otherwise will be integrated into
the new system still remains to be seen.
One popular model is that the semifi
nal bowls will be determined by the
conference of the No. 1 and No. 2
teams; that is, if Stanford finished first
in the country (Barry J. Sanders for
Heisman in 2014, anyone?), it would
play in the Rose Bowl against the four
seed, and if LSU finished second, it
would play in the Sugar Bowl against
the three-seed.
So the Pac-12's chance of being
represented in the Rose Bowl isn't
seismically better or worse, it's just...
different. As of now, pretty much the
only way a Pac-12 team isn't included
in the Rose Bowl is if the conference
champion plays in the national title
game and there isn't a BCS-eligible
squad from the conference to fill the
void. The one exception was in 2005,
when No. IUSC went to the champi
onship game and No. 5 Texas got the
Rose-Bowl nod over No. 4 Cal (not
that I have any sympathy).
Under the proposed system, a Pac
-12 team would get to play in the Rose
Bowl if it was ranked No. 1, and the
same would be true for No. 2 as long as
a Big Ten team hadn't already claimed
the bid with the top ranking. But a Pac
-12 team won't be playing in Pasadena
if it finishes out of the top-two and the
Big Ten does, except for the off chance
that the 1 -4/2-3 seedings match up per
fectly to put a Big Ten and Pac-12
squad in the same game. There is, how
ever, some talk of giving slightly lower
ranked conference champions a
chance to play in the Final Four to help
maintain tradition.
