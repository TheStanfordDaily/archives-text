## FacSen talks breadth requirements 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate discussed revisions to un
dergraduate breath requirements at its Thursday
meeting, with professors disagreeing over the
number of courses a student should be required
to take under the proposed new system.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2, currently
acting president due to University President John
Hennessy's ongoing sabbatical, opened the meet
ing by emphasizing the success of Admit Week
end 2012.

Based on preliminary results from the Office
of Undergraduate Admission, this year's yield
the percentage of admitted students committed
to Stanford will be around 73.4 percent, an in
crease of approximately 3.4 percent from last
year, Etchemendy said.

Etchemendy subsequently addressed the de
parture of Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby, who
will leave Stanford at the end of the academic
year to become commissioner of the Big 12 ath
letics conference. Etchemendy said that Bowls-

by's post will likely be filled on an
interim basis while the University
conducts a search for a permanent
replacement.
"Bob has done a fantastic job
here and we're very sorry to
see him go but this is an excit
ing opportunity for him,"
Etchemendy said.
The Senate then heard a report
by the Committee on Undergrad
uate Standards and Policy (C
-USP) on proposed revisions to ac
ademic breadth requirements. C
USP chair Judith Goldstein deliv
ered the report.
Goldstein critiqued the exist
ing breadth requirements, which
total 12 courses, including the In
troduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) program and the Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR). In particular, she high
lighted students' current ability to
double count courses between the
"Disciplinary Breadth" and the
"Education for Citizenship" Gen
eral Education Requirements
(GERs).

"This has created an odd and,
at times, insidious incentive for
students to get around our
breadth requirements," Goldstein
said.

The original Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford
(SUES) report, which was first de
livered to the Faculty Senate at
the end of January, recommended
the implementation of seven new
interdisciplinary breadth require
ments based on skills that were
deemed essential to students: aes
thetic and interpretive inquiry, so
cial inquiry, scientific analysis, for
mal and quantitative reasoning,
engaging difference, moral and
ethical reasoning and creative ex
pression.

Under this proposal, students
would be obligated to take two
courses in four of the breadth
areas and one course in each of
the remaining three.
The C-USP report, however,
chose to abandon the double re
quirements in all but one breadth
requirement.

Goldstein expressed a desire to
emphasize student choice within
the new system and said she is
concerned that weighting some
requirements more heavily might
distort the undergraduate aca
demic experience.
"We don't have to worry that
our students aren't being broadly
educated," Goldstein said, citing

statistics demonstrating the
breadth of study pursued by non
humanities majors even as upper
classmen.

Mechanical Engineering Pro
fessor Chris Edwards and Eco
nomics Professor Caroline Hoxby
proposed an amendment to the C
USP proposal to return to the
SUES report's recommendations
for differently weighted require
ments.

"There is a reason for having
more than one [course per re
quirement], and it has to do with
the choice we can offer students,"
Edwards said.
"We want students to be
thoughtful about the choices
they're making and for them to be
able to choose two courses that
work together to satisfy the learn
ing goals in this area," Hoxby
added.

Edwards, who served as the
chair of the SUES subcommittee
on breadth, argued that the SUES
report aimed to spread require
ments across the undergraduate
experience and engage students
to a greater extent, rather than re
duce overall requirements.
"We want breadth to comple
ment the major," Edwards said.
"It's about being smart, and it's
about being intentional."
Edwards emphasized the rela
tively light nature of current un
dergraduate academic require
ments at Stanford by comparing
overall course load to peer institu
tions such as Yale, Harvard and
Princeton. After adjusting other
universities' requirements to ac
commodate the quarter system,
Stanford's requirements remain
significantly less onerous, he said.
"We're allowing more freedom
than any of our other peer institu
tions," Hoxby said. "Because our
system isn't departmentally
based, it also allows more flexibil
ity."

Faculty discussion of the C
USP proposal, and of the amend
ment, revolved around the impact
of revised requirements on the
University's reputation, as well as
on undergraduate students.
"Outside perceptions of Stan
ford are important," said Richard
Sailer, dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences. "I worry
that the C-USP amendment will
only contribute to the reputation
that Stanford has [of being mostly
science-oriented]."
Joseph Lipsick, professor of
pathology, expressed concern that
the amendment's restoration of
more extensive requirements may
prompt resentment among under
graduates.
"There are certain things we

need for a liberal education and
certain things we want for our stu
dents as they exit Stanford," coun
tered Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Harry Elam.
"If we limit [the requirements],
are we fulfilling all the things we
want them to be as they enter the
world?"

"The notion that we've dra
matically extended the footprint
[of requirements] is not correct,"
said James Campbell, co-chair of
the SUES committee. "I'd be re
luctant to see it shrunk further."

Dan DeLong 'l3, ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate representa
tive, expressed the importance of
soliciting student feedback on the
various proposals.
"The success of either proposal
largely hinges on how Vice
Provost Elam and his office are
able to create a program that al
lows students to easily identify
courses they want to engage in,"
DeLong said.
The Senate will return to the
subject at its next meeting on May
17.

The Faculty Senate discussed revisions to un
dergraduate breath requirements at its Thursday
meeting, with professors disagreeing over the
number of courses a student should be required
to take under the proposed new system.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2, currently
acting president due to University President John
Hennessy's ongoing sabbatical, opened the meet
ing by emphasizing the success of Admit Week
end 2012.

Based on preliminary results from the Office
of Undergraduate Admission, this year's yield
the percentage of admitted students committed
to Stanford will be around 73.4 percent, an in
crease of approximately 3.4 percent from last
year, Etchemendy said.

Etchemendy subsequently addressed the de
parture of Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby, who
will leave Stanford at the end of the academic
year to become commissioner of the Big 12 ath
letics conference. Etchemendy said that Bowls-

by's post will likely be filled on an
interim basis while the University
conducts a search for a permanent
replacement.
"Bob has done a fantastic job
here and we're very sorry to
see him go but this is an excit
ing opportunity for him,"
Etchemendy said.
The Senate then heard a report
by the Committee on Undergrad
uate Standards and Policy (C
-USP) on proposed revisions to ac
ademic breadth requirements. C
USP chair Judith Goldstein deliv
ered the report.
Goldstein critiqued the exist
ing breadth requirements, which
total 12 courses, including the In
troduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) program and the Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR). In particular, she high
lighted students' current ability to
double count courses between the
"Disciplinary Breadth" and the
"Education for Citizenship" Gen
eral Education Requirements
(GERs).

"This has created an odd and,
at times, insidious incentive for
students to get around our
breadth requirements," Goldstein
said.

The original Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford
(SUES) report, which was first de
livered to the Faculty Senate at
the end of January, recommended
the implementation of seven new
interdisciplinary breadth require
ments based on skills that were
deemed essential to students: aes
thetic and interpretive inquiry, so
cial inquiry, scientific analysis, for
mal and quantitative reasoning,
engaging difference, moral and
ethical reasoning and creative ex
pression.

Under this proposal, students
would be obligated to take two
courses in four of the breadth
areas and one course in each of
the remaining three.
The C-USP report, however,
chose to abandon the double re
quirements in all but one breadth
requirement.

Goldstein expressed a desire to
emphasize student choice within
the new system and said she is
concerned that weighting some
requirements more heavily might
distort the undergraduate aca
demic experience.
"We don't have to worry that
our students aren't being broadly
educated," Goldstein said, citing

statistics demonstrating the
breadth of study pursued by non
humanities majors even as upper
classmen.

Mechanical Engineering Pro
fessor Chris Edwards and Eco
nomics Professor Caroline Hoxby
proposed an amendment to the C
USP proposal to return to the
SUES report's recommendations
for differently weighted require
ments.

"There is a reason for having
more than one [course per re
quirement], and it has to do with
the choice we can offer students,"
Edwards said.
"We want students to be
thoughtful about the choices
they're making and for them to be
able to choose two courses that
work together to satisfy the learn
ing goals in this area," Hoxby
added.

Edwards, who served as the
chair of the SUES subcommittee
on breadth, argued that the SUES
report aimed to spread require
ments across the undergraduate
experience and engage students
to a greater extent, rather than re
duce overall requirements.
"We want breadth to comple
ment the major," Edwards said.
"It's about being smart, and it's
about being intentional."
Edwards emphasized the rela
tively light nature of current un
dergraduate academic require
ments at Stanford by comparing
overall course load to peer institu
tions such as Yale, Harvard and
Princeton. After adjusting other
universities' requirements to ac
commodate the quarter system,
Stanford's requirements remain
significantly less onerous, he said.
"We're allowing more freedom
than any of our other peer institu
tions," Hoxby said. "Because our
system isn't departmentally
based, it also allows more flexibil
ity."

Faculty discussion of the C
USP proposal, and of the amend
ment, revolved around the impact
of revised requirements on the
University's reputation, as well as
on undergraduate students.
"Outside perceptions of Stan
ford are important," said Richard
Sailer, dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences. "I worry
that the C-USP amendment will
only contribute to the reputation
that Stanford has [of being mostly
science-oriented]."
Joseph Lipsick, professor of
pathology, expressed concern that
the amendment's restoration of
more extensive requirements may
prompt resentment among under
graduates.
"There are certain things we

need for a liberal education and
certain things we want for our stu
dents as they exit Stanford," coun
tered Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Harry Elam.
"If we limit [the requirements],
are we fulfilling all the things we
want them to be as they enter the
world?"

"The notion that we've dra
matically extended the footprint
[of requirements] is not correct,"
said James Campbell, co-chair of
the SUES committee. "I'd be re
luctant to see it shrunk further."

Dan DeLong 'l3, ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate representa
tive, expressed the importance of
soliciting student feedback on the
various proposals.
