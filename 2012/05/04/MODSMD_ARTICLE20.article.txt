## TOP 5: THINGS NOT TO TELL PEOPLE You JUST MET 
### 
College is one of the few times in
your life when work and social envi
ronments completely overlap and
you're expected to automatically
bond with everyone you come into
contact with. With the friendliest sea
son upon us, coinciding with final
round interviews, it can be difficult to
navigate the decorum appropriate
for Exotic Erotic versus Wilbur Field
tanning versus that first Google pod
nap. Read on for the cardinal rules
on which subjects shouldn't be dis
cussed up front.
"I don't like animals."
In a city where it's not uncommon to
spot poodles in Neiman's and
Savannah cats in Bloomies, you can
bet most people will suspect foul
play if you suggest you're not actual
ly obsessed with their furry friend.
They will hold it against you. If it
comes up, just say you're scared of
animals. It's easier to stomach. And
the vegans may even forgive your
misguided or PTSD-induced phobia.
Either that or point you toward the
Comm department for some virtual
reality therapy.
"I haven't showered in
[X number] of days ..."
This probably goes without saying,
but if you're that dirty, chances are
they can already smell you. Don't
draw attention to it. Plus, with a little
dry shampoo and spray-on deodor
ant, you might be able to fool some
people. Heck, with a "sun's out, guns
out" philosophy, you may just be
able to blame your stale appearance
and au naturale odor on all the "out
doorsy" activity you've been wran
gling.

"I broke so many laws
last weekend ..."
Don't let the tutu or the leather
pants fool you. Are you familiar with
"21 Jump Street"? The strangers you
just met could very well be under
cover police officers. And even
though some Daily writers may even
be so badass as to have warrants out
for their arrests (albeit for unpaid bik
ing tickets), some weekend memo
ries are best left to the imagination
and legal record.
"Let me share my reli
gious beliefs with you."
We have "God" on our money, so
we will not be claiming a separation
of church and state. But, in general,
if you bring it up, people will think
you're trying to convert them. Which
is actually pretty offensive, because
you don't know anything about the
state of their soul. They could be
Gandhi.
"I don't like Beyonce."
See number one. Everyone loves
Beyonce. What's not to love about
this singing, dancing, acting, rags-to
riches golden girl? And she's a moth
er. Blue Ivy Carter can't even walk
yet, and she already has a strain of
marijuana named after her. There's a
good chance if you say this to some
one, they aren't going to let you fin
ish.
