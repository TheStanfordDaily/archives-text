In case you hadn't heard, Newsweek came
out with their College Rankings, and
Stanford's ranked fifth. For horniest, that is.
With Exotic Erotic on the horizon of today's
setting sun to be exact —we think this is the
most relevant of our rankings. Now, we made
the cut many times over in those silly areas like
Most Return on Your Investment or whatever,
but let's face it: You can get a good education
anywhere. That's why God (and Horace Mann)
invented public school. When you choose a col
lege, it's like picking out a car. It has to go from
point A to point B; that's the given. What you're
really looking for is something fun and sporty,
something that will take you there fast and
preferably comes in Cardinal red.
And any rep/tour guide/student/
alum/Dean Julie will always give you the same
used-car-salesman spiel: Yeah ,we have the
best teachers, and campus, and whatever, but
it's really{and they draw it out here, so you
KNOW they tellin' the truth) the students that
make it the best. I know how it works; I wrote
those "Why Whatever College" essays, too.
But when you're making your list, will
YOU want your roommate to be the future
co-founder of a giant company, which you
may try to swindle 40 percent of later? No, no,

you're not going to Harvard. You'd rather they
be the wingman to your Friday nights and
Sunday Fundays.
And really, what does "Horniest" mean
anyway? Like horniest students, or professors,
or curriculum? I mean, I did hear about some
wild IHUM they offered for a year, but that
got axed (insert Cal joke here), and everyone
is always chatting up that French Cinema
(porn) class, but is this mark cause for con
cern? Or celebration?
As far as I can tell, I guess it's pretty true.
Any visiting student could tell from Exotic
Erotic or the sheer number of hardly-clothed
people on Wilbur Field just how excited this
campus is. Or the fact that Full Moon on the
Quad is, like, a normal and school-sponsored
event? Not to mention the Chappie Queens of
bygone years (Here's hoping for a revival!).
And living down the hall from he-who-shall
be-known-as-RushCrush during freshman
year certainly opened my eyes to the world of
walks of shame (and no names), empty bottle
evenings and un-returned phone calls (of
both the literal and figurative variety). But the
real reason why this list has got me thinking is,


LUIS AGUILAR/The Stanford Daily
what does this mean for the rest of
em? I know people who go to the
colleges that placed one through
four on the list do they just
blow off class for orgies and cock
tails all the time? How can I look at
Bo Levine (names changed, for
confidentiality... and as a precau
tion against cyber bullying) with
out wondering what goes on in all
those colleges of Yale? Or is it more
of a gradient? Yalies (#1) are just
like, Manwhores and Lady Pimps;
Stanfordians are ladies on the
street, but freaks in the sheets; and
then my friends at Brown (#25),
you know, they get some action,

but they aren't bragging in the
boys' room? I just don't know what
to think of them, or even my
other classmates.
Does this Cardinal H imply a
certain amount of reciprocity? Is
prudence more Princeton (not
listed) style? And how exactly did
the admissions officers screen for
this? Are they calling me a ho? Are
they calling all you other Stanford
kids hos? Or congratulating us for
being smarties with needs?
I think, in reality, somewhere
between Full Moon on the Quad
and Mausoleum Party, every
freshman class loses all sense of

propriety and restraint and real
izes that the last four years of
over-achieving have brought
about a pressing need for rebirth,
in the form of over-crowded,
under-dressed, perspiration-laden
frat house floors rife with ques
tionable make-out sessions and
copious amounts of rally.
I mean, if that sounds horny
to you, I guess we earned our rank
ing. Congrats Stanford - now lets
go party.

be the wingman to your Friday nights and
Sunday Fundays.
And really, what does "Horniest" mean
anyway? Like horniest students, or professors,
or curriculum? I mean, I did hear about some
wild IHUM they offered for a year, but that
got axed (insert Cal joke here), and everyone
is always chatting up that French Cinema
(porn) class, but is this mark cause for con
cern? Or celebration?
As far as I can tell, I guess it's pretty true.
Any visiting student could tell from Exotic
Erotic or the sheer number of hardly-clothed
people on Wilbur Field just how excited this
campus is. Or the fact that Full Moon on the
Quad is, like, a normal and school-sponsored
event? Not to mention the Chappie Queens of
bygone years (Here's hoping for a revival!).
And living down the hall from he-who-shall
be-known-as-RushCrush during freshman
year certainly opened my eyes to the world of
walks of shame (and no names), empty bottle
evenings and un-returned phone calls (of
both the literal and figurative variety). But the
real reason why this list has got me thinking is,


LUIS AGUILAR/The Stanford Daily
what does this mean for the rest of
em? I know people who go to the
colleges that placed one through
four on the list do they just
blow off class for orgies and cock
tails all the time? How can I look at
Bo Levine (names changed, for
confidentiality... and as a precau
tion against cyber bullying) with
out wondering what goes on in all
those colleges of Yale? Or is it more
of a gradient? Yalies (#1) are just
like, Manwhores and Lady Pimps;
Stanfordians are ladies on the
street, but freaks in the sheets; and
then my friends at Brown (#25),
you know, they get some action,

but they aren't bragging in the
boys' room? I just don't know what
to think of them, or even my
other classmates.
Does this Cardinal H imply a
certain amount of reciprocity? Is
prudence more Princeton (not
listed) style? And how exactly did
the admissions officers screen for
this? Are they calling me a ho? Are
they calling all you other Stanford
kids hos? Or congratulating us for
being smarties with needs?
I think, in reality, somewhere
between Full Moon on the Quad
and Mausoleum Party, every
freshman class loses all sense of

propriety and restraint and real
izes that the last four years of
over-achieving have brought
about a pressing need for rebirth,
in the form of over-crowded,
under-dressed, perspiration-laden
frat house floors rife with ques
tionable make-out sessions and
copious amounts of rally.
I mean, if that sounds horny
to you, I guess we earned our rank
ing. Congrats Stanford - now lets
go party.
