Each year, the San Francisco
International Film Festival chooses a
director to honor with the Founder's
Directing Award, and this year's was
bestowed upon the great actor-director
Kenneth Branagh. With past winners like
Clint Eastwood, Akira Kurosawa, Werner
Herzog and Mike Leigh, Branagh finds him
self in good company. He came to San
Francisco this week to accept the award and
to participate in a special on-stage event at
the Castro Theatre on Friday with a screen
ing of his second film, "Dead Again."
Kenneth Branagh has often been called
the next Laurence Olivier, in praise of his
fantastic film adaptations of Shakespeare's
plays, both as a director and an actor. At 28,
he made his directorial debut with "Henry
V," in which he also played the title role,
earning Academy Award nominations for
both Best Actor and Best Director. In his
interview on Friday, he revealed that he was
actually in San Francisco when "Henry V"
was beginning to get significant critical
acclaim, and he cited reading a glowing New
York Times review of it while in San
Francisco as a life-changing moment. His
later film, "Much Ado About Nothing," is a
masterpiece and the definitive version of the
play; Branagh plays Benedick to Emma
Thompson's Beatrice, alongside an impres
sive supporting cast including Denzel
Washington and Kate Beckinsale.
In 1996, Branagh, not Sir Branagh he
declined the offer of knighthood filmed a
full-length rendition of "Hamlet," in which
he also played the title role, alongside Kate
Winslet's Ophelia. When he found out that
he had been nominated for the Best Adapted
Screenplay Oscar for "Hamlet," he thought it
was some kind of cruel joke. Yes, he had rad
ically interpreted the play as a director, but he
had kept the entire script intact. Eventually,
he and a writer friend concluded that this
was really a nomination for Mr. William
Shakespeare, 400 years late, and a nod of

approval from other writers for leaving
Shakespeare's play alone.
Although his adaptations of the Bard's
"Love's Labour Lost" as a Hollywood musical
and "As You Like It" were both flops, as
Branagh puts it, only the great can fail spec
tacularly.
His oeuvre, however, is not limited to
Shakespeare. He successfully dabbled in noir
with "Dead Again," made a film of
"Frankenstein," remade "Sleuth" with a script
by Harold Pinter and most recendy tanked
with "Thor." It's also a littie-known fact that
his film "Peter's Friends," which starred his
real-life friends Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry,
Imelda Staunton and then-wife Emma
Thompson, was the first time Hugh Laurie's
singing and piano playing were captured on
film for the big screen.
The evening opened with an interview
with Branagh by CalShakes Artistic Director
lonathan Moscone. Branagh was, of course,
charming, witty and incredibly articulate and
humble. When the floor opened up for audi
ence questions, there was a general, well
deserved outpouring of gratitude for
Branagtis work in making Shakespeare acces
sible to the masses, and yet he still remained
sincerely humble. We were reminded of his
beginnings as a boy from a working-class
family in Northern Ireland, who moved to
England at age nine and adopted an English
accent as a means to ensure he was under
stood and fend off bullies.
As a young actor and director, he was
known to mouth off a fair bit about
"wankers" who claimed to know what
Shakespeare was or how Shakespeare should
be performed. He has had the misfortune of
having some of these youthful phrases, now
circulating on the Internet, quoted back to
him, like "I'm just a foul-mouthed Brit."
Branagh and Moscone got into some
very exciting, in-depth discussion about his
directorial choices in his Shakespearean
films. He chose to set "Hamlet" in bright,

expansive spaces because, after performing
the play multiple times, he felt that these sets
were just as arguably appropriate as the
gloomy environs "Hamlet" is so often con
fined to. It was also done to help draw atten
tion to the fact that there were many joyous
happenings in Elsinore, from his mother's
happy new marriage to Claudius' competent
ruling of the country, and that Hamlet's
gloominess was very much a character trait.
And although Branagh humorously summa
rizes the play as basically being about how
the map of Europe could change just
because a man couldn't have a proper con
versation alone with his mother after his
father's death, he does, of course, acknowl
edge that it's also brilliant in many ways.
The pair discussed the iconic opening
scene of "Henry V," when Derek Jacobi
speaks his soliloquy while walking through

the backstage of a film studio, and upon fin
ishing, opens a door, revealing a small sliver
of light, and the play begins. While earlier
adaptations of "Henry V," like Olivier's,
favored a romantic interpretation, Branagh
aimed to look at the play as being about
what happens in hushed conversations
behind closed doors. The frequent use of
close-ups in the film, he said, was part of set
ting up this idea.
After the interview and a brief intermis
sion, the audience was treated to a screening
of "Dead Again," in which Branagh also stars
alongside Emma Thompson. "Dead Again"
is an impressively crafted film, which
embraces, acknowledges and mocks all the
conventions of film noir and puts them in a
modern setting. When Mike Church

(Branagh) is called into the orphanage
where he grew up to help Grace, a woman
who has lost her memory (Thompson),
everything starts to get screwy for him.
Through a series of hilarious events, they
wind up visiting a quirky hypnotist who
helps Grace regain some memories. Her
memories are not from the recent past, but
rather involve a married couple from the
1940s that look exactly like our heroes but
are, in fact, Margaret and Roman Strauss,
famous for the fact that Roman was sen
tenced to death for Margaret's murder.
Of course, it's absurd, and we have to
suspend our disbelief just as much as our
heroes do. Here the film gets very, very

clever. Branagh thickly applies the noir from
the suspicious camera angles to the genre
like dialogue, and Mike's own disbelief
about his peculiar circumstances grows. But
in this suspension, Branagh also manages to
capture resounding comedy, both from
one-liners and the intended irony of the sit
uations. Branagh succeeds in building up so
much suspense, so much dramatic tension
and so much enthralling action, with
earned plot twist after plot twist, that by the
end, you actually have to catch your breath.
Here Branagh proves that he's not just a
master at putting theatre on film but at
filmmaking itself, mastering film noir just as
deftly as he did Shakespeare.
It has now been a few years since

Branagh last brought a Shakespeare play
to the big screen. When asked if he will be
returning to Shakespeare again anytime
soon, Branagh said he has plans to make a
film of a play whose name cannot be
uttered in the current venue: "The
Scottish Play," that is. And after a few
more comments about superstition, he
asked us if he had made himself absolute
ly clear yet. The unnamed play is, of
course, "Macbeth." He also stated that he
would like to make another noir film set
in San Francisco, a city so rich with film
noir history.

Shakespeare, 400 years late, and a nod of

approval from other writers for leaving
Shakespeare's play alone.
Although his adaptations of the Bard's
"Love's Labour Lost" as a Hollywood musical
and "As You Like It" were both flops, as
Branagh puts it, only the great can fail spec
tacularly.
His oeuvre, however, is not limited to
Shakespeare. He successfully dabbled in noir
with "Dead Again," made a film of
"Frankenstein," remade "Sleuth" with a script
by Harold Pinter and most recendy tanked
with "Thor." It's also a littie-known fact that
his film "Peter's Friends," which starred his
real-life friends Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry,
Imelda Staunton and then-wife Emma
Thompson, was the first time Hugh Laurie's
singing and piano playing were captured on
film for the big screen.
The evening opened with an interview
with Branagh by CalShakes Artistic Director
lonathan Moscone. Branagh was, of course,
charming, witty and incredibly articulate and
humble. When the floor opened up for audi
ence questions, there was a general, well
deserved outpouring of gratitude for
Branagtis work in making Shakespeare acces
sible to the masses, and yet he still remained
sincerely humble. We were reminded of his
beginnings as a boy from a working-class
family in Northern Ireland, who moved to
England at age nine and adopted an English
accent as a means to ensure he was under
stood and fend off bullies.
As a young actor and director, he was
known to mouth off a fair bit about
"wankers" who claimed to know what
Shakespeare was or how Shakespeare should
be performed. He has had the misfortune of
having some of these youthful phrases, now
circulating on the Internet, quoted back to
him, like "I'm just a foul-mouthed Brit."
Branagh and Moscone got into some
very exciting, in-depth discussion about his
directorial choices in his Shakespearean
films. He chose to set "Hamlet" in bright,

expansive spaces because, after performing
the play multiple times, he felt that these sets
were just as arguably appropriate as the
gloomy environs "Hamlet" is so often con
fined to. It was also done to help draw atten
tion to the fact that there were many joyous
happenings in Elsinore, from his mother's
happy new marriage to Claudius' competent
ruling of the country, and that Hamlet's
gloominess was very much a character trait.
And although Branagh humorously summa
rizes the play as basically being about how
the map of Europe could change just
because a man couldn't have a proper con
versation alone with his mother after his
father's death, he does, of course, acknowl
edge that it's also brilliant in many ways.
The pair discussed the iconic opening
scene of "Henry V," when Derek Jacobi
speaks his soliloquy while walking through

the backstage of a film studio, and upon fin
ishing, opens a door, revealing a small sliver
of light, and the play begins. While earlier
adaptations of "Henry V," like Olivier's,
favored a romantic interpretation, Branagh
aimed to look at the play as being about
what happens in hushed conversations
behind closed doors. The frequent use of
close-ups in the film, he said, was part of set
ting up this idea.
After the interview and a brief intermis
sion, the audience was treated to a screening
of "Dead Again," in which Branagh also stars
alongside Emma Thompson. "Dead Again"
is an impressively crafted film, which
embraces, acknowledges and mocks all the
conventions of film noir and puts them in a
modern setting. When Mike Church

(Branagh) is called into the orphanage
where he grew up to help Grace, a woman
who has lost her memory (Thompson),
everything starts to get screwy for him.
Through a series of hilarious events, they
wind up visiting a quirky hypnotist who
helps Grace regain some memories. Her
memories are not from the recent past, but
rather involve a married couple from the
1940s that look exactly like our heroes but
are, in fact, Margaret and Roman Strauss,
famous for the fact that Roman was sen
tenced to death for Margaret's murder.
Of course, it's absurd, and we have to
suspend our disbelief just as much as our
heroes do. Here the film gets very, very

clever. Branagh thickly applies the noir from
the suspicious camera angles to the genre
like dialogue, and Mike's own disbelief
about his peculiar circumstances grows. But
in this suspension, Branagh also manages to
capture resounding comedy, both from
one-liners and the intended irony of the sit
uations. Branagh succeeds in building up so
much suspense, so much dramatic tension
and so much enthralling action, with
earned plot twist after plot twist, that by the
end, you actually have to catch your breath.
Here Branagh proves that he's not just a
master at putting theatre on film but at
filmmaking itself, mastering film noir just as
deftly as he did Shakespeare.
It has now been a few years since

Branagh last brought a Shakespeare play
to the big screen. When asked if he will be
returning to Shakespeare again anytime
soon, Branagh said he has plans to make a
film of a play whose name cannot be
uttered in the current venue: "The
Scottish Play," that is. And after a few
more comments about superstition, he
asked us if he had made himself absolute
ly clear yet. The unnamed play is, of
course, "Macbeth." He also stated that he
would like to make another noir film set
in San Francisco, a city so rich with film
noir history.

Each year, the San Francisco
International Film Festival chooses a
director to honor with the Founder's
Directing Award, and this year's was
bestowed upon the great actor-director
Kenneth Branagh. With past winners like
Clint Eastwood, Akira Kurosawa, Werner
Herzog and Mike Leigh, Branagh finds him
self in good company. He came to San
Francisco this week to accept the award and
to participate in a special on-stage event at
the Castro Theatre on Friday with a screen
ing of his second film, "Dead Again."
Kenneth Branagh has often been called
the next Laurence Olivier, in praise of his
fantastic film adaptations of Shakespeare's
plays, both as a director and an actor. At 28,
he made his directorial debut with "Henry
V," in which he also played the title role,
earning Academy Award nominations for
both Best Actor and Best Director. In his
interview on Friday, he revealed that he was
actually in San Francisco when "Henry V"
was beginning to get significant critical
acclaim, and he cited reading a glowing New
York Times review of it while in San
Francisco as a life-changing moment. His
later film, "Much Ado About Nothing," is a
masterpiece and the definitive version of the
play; Branagh plays Benedick to Emma
Thompson's Beatrice, alongside an impres
sive supporting cast including Denzel
Washington and Kate Beckinsale.
In 1996, Branagh, not Sir Branagh he
declined the offer of knighthood filmed a
full-length rendition of "Hamlet," in which
he also played the title role, alongside Kate
Winslet's Ophelia. When he found out that
he had been nominated for the Best Adapted
Screenplay Oscar for "Hamlet," he thought it
was some kind of cruel joke. Yes, he had rad
ically interpreted the play as a director, but he
had kept the entire script intact. Eventually,
he and a writer friend concluded that this
was really a nomination for Mr. William
Shakespeare, 400 years late, and a nod of

approval from other writers for leaving
