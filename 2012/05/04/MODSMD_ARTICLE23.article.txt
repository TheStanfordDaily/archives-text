## CULT FILM 'SOUND OF MY VOICE' 
### â€“ misa SHIKUMA contact misa: mshikuma@stanford. edu 
Zal Batmanglij's provocative debut fea
ture and Sundance hit "Sound of My
Voice" follows a young pair of docu
mentarians seeking to infiltrate an under
ground cult. Starring indie "it-girl" Brit
Marling as the cult's enigmatic leader, the

film's exploration of the boundaries between
knowledge, faith and trust prove that it does
n't take a big budget to drive a high-concept
story.
By day, twenty-somethings Peter
(Christopher Denham) and Lorna (Nicole

Vicius) are a substitute teacher and a writer,
respectively, but by night, after weeks of
preparation, they are finally close to realizing
their goal of exposing a local cult. Following
explicit instructions, the couple scrubs down
and changes clothes before being blindfolded
and taken to the basement of a safe house,
where they meet their fellow members and
leader Maggie (Marling).
Shrouded in white and hooked up to an
oxygen tank, Maggie is like a modern-day
Madonna whose mesmerizing aura res
onates with even the staunchest disbelievers
like Peter. Claiming to be from the distant
future, she promises to protect her disciples
from imminent catastrophe in exchange for
their faith and trust. As Maggie's demands
escalate, pressuring the converts to prove
their worthiness, Peter and Lorna begin to
question just how far they are willing to go
in pursuit of the truth; that is, if they even
know what truth means anymore.
Marling anchors the film as the manip
ulative Maggie, who constantly fluctuates
between wise sage and petulant superior,
relying on others to bring her items from the
outside world that her condition prevents
her from setting foot in. The performance is
a study in calculated charisma, such that, by
the end, it matters less whether Maggie's
story is true but rather that her power to
elicit such blind faith is a force to be reck-

oned with.
While this may all sound quite heavy,
co-writers Marling and Batmanglij infuse the
story with moments of levity that prevent
the film from taking itself too seriously. The
elaborate handshake that designates mem
bership seems silly at first, but, by the end,
becomes emblematic. In another memorable
scene, Maggie performs "Dreams" by The
Cranberries in a botched attempt to impress
her followers with a song from the future.
"Sound of My Voice" leaves plenty of
loose ends and unanswered questions that
suggest it would have perhaps functioned
better as a television pilot (and indeed, the
writers originally conceived of the story as a
web series), but nonetheless manages to
please and intrigue as a film. Viewers who
prefer their movies neatly wrapped up with a
bow should take note and proceed with cau
tion).
An engrossing and haunting examina
tion of the lengths to which individuals will
go to in order to hold fast to something they
believe in no matter how rational or irra
tional this is a film that doesn't shy away
from testing conventions and suspending
disbelief.
