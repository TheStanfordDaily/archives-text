## EMOTIONALITY IN MOTION JOURNEY 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
Playing Journey is a bit like sliding
through an exotic dream. It's exhila
rating one moment, sad the next, and,
inherently, the experience is solely yours, the
dreamer's. The intensity of such things, for
better or worse, will always fade when you
leave the bed or put down the controller. The
sights and sounds evaporate in daylight, and
the experience boils away to lingering, naked
emotion. When someone asks if you had any
dreams last night, you're at a loss for words.
But you have no lack of feelings, difficult

though they are to convey.
I played through Journey on a cold
night in March, but the memory went dor
mant until a few days ago. It was one of

those nervous, gleeful moments that come
up every so often for any hobbyist or closet
ed geek: A friend of mine, with whom I quite
happily spend time never mentioning games,
was asking about them. My mind raced I
don't make a habit of talking about this kind
of thing, but I jump like a hungry dog when
I get a good chance. With effort, I held

myself back from clicking open my
metaphorical briefcase and unleashing an
off-putting presentation of why games will
save the world, or some other overwrought
bullshit. Luckily, I managed to keep my head
on straight and give a sensible, not-too
enthusiastic account of what makes games
worth playing or at least, I hope I did. I
was mostly satisfied when the conversation
moved on, if only because I didn't embarrass
myself, and she didn't think any worse of
games. Mostly satisfied, but not entirely.
In the rapid scanning of my mental
archives, Journey was the first hit in response
to the query, "Which games are interesting to
non-gamers?" Even so, the Journey page in
my mind was gibberish. The problem, I've
realized, is that Journey escapes conventional
description. It's not a platformer, it's not a
puzzler and it's certainly not an action game.
Its title reveals nothing about the game.
There's no dialogue, no clear story, no

names, no specific setting, no bosses, no
checkpoints, no life bars, no skill trees and
no death. It's deeply subjective, mingling in
the curious spaces where joy, sorrow, loss
and anger meet. At times it flies; at others it
falls. It's dynamism; it's despair.
It's emotion, in motion.
Ah, yes that sense of movement. I
could never properly capture it without put
ting a controller in your hands. Likewise, I've
never seen a game accomplish so much with
the plain action of pushing a joystick for
ward. You feel exhausted trudging through
the sand, then elated as you ski down the
opposite slope, riding the winds as they twirl
your scarf and tug at your robes. Your
strength later fades as the elements claim
you; a blizzard closes in, your legs grow
heavy. With an earnest, caring focus, you
push a bit harder on the joystick but to
no avail. One knee falls, then you collapse.
After that comes the game's best use of
motion, which I won't spoil. It's eye-opening,
really, for a single gameplay mechanic to
move you through all the emotional peaks

and valleys of a stirring concerto.
I wondered for some time how such a
simple game could pull so fiercely at my
heartstrings. It's precisely that austerity,
though, that makes Journey so provocative.
It reduces the explicit experience to basic,
sub-cortical reactions, stripping us bare and
letting us bring our own emotionality to the
table. For that reason I came to think of
Journey as really knowing me as a person
a ridiculous notion, of course, but one that's
grounded in the game's design.
Journey never holds your hand. It does
n't put a marker on a map or tell you to go
anywhere, and it forgoes most games' abra
sive reminders to "press square to attack!"
Such interruption, after all, would wake the
placid dreamer. It merely lets you wander as
you will, sweeping you oh-so-gently onto the
proper path with a cool breeze here or a
sharp ledge there. A mountain beckons in
the distance, across the sands. You'll feel so
much more purpose, more weight, from
deciding to travel there instead of having the
game slap a nav-point on it. In that way,

Journey seems to anticipate precisely what
you will do without ever making you do it. It
never tries to force a reaction out of you, but
rather feels like an extension of feelings you
already have. It's a bit like a dream, you

might agree.
Journey's most surreal experience, no
doubt, comes from encountering another

wanderer. Considering the racist 12-year-olds
who plague an average match of Halo, I'd
assume that any hint of genuine emotion

would be dashed away with the inclusion of
multiplayer. But fourney, in its own elegant
way, deftly avoids this problem. Players
remain nameless and mute, lingering in your
game only as long as they desire. You might
travel together for a time or move past each
other like strangers in a train station. If you
cooperate, you'll build a silent bond. A simple
language emerges as you look at one another,
walk off a bit and chirp to your companion
with the game's one-button singing mechan
ic. "Follow me," you both understand.
Inevitably, then, you'll be stung when they
leave your side. There are no rules, no tech
nobabble and certainly no screaming adoles
cents. It's just two strangers in a strange land,
like innocent children on the same play
ground. Somehow, Journey solved the prob
lem of fostering real, in-game intimacy by
stripping out all the traditional ways that
games let us communicate. And it's beautiful.
Simple as it seems, Journey is a cryptic
experience. I doubt if I could ever throw
enough words onto the Internet to capture
all its subtle nuances. But that mystery belies
a compelling, unadorned elegance that any
one with a heart would find moving. In so
doing, Journey is a powerful case for games
being a unique and engaging medium. Even
if I can't win you over with words on a page,
I suggest you pick up a controller and give it
a try yourself.

up every so often for any hobbyist or closet
ed geek: A friend of mine, with whom I quite
happily spend time never mentioning games,
was asking about them. My mind raced I
don't make a habit of talking about this kind
of thing, but I jump like a hungry dog when
I get a good chance. With effort, I held

myself back from clicking open my
metaphorical briefcase and unleashing an
off-putting presentation of why games will
save the world, or some other overwrought
bullshit. Luckily, I managed to keep my head
on straight and give a sensible, not-too
enthusiastic account of what makes games
worth playing or at least, I hope I did. I
was mostly satisfied when the conversation
moved on, if only because I didn't embarrass
myself, and she didn't think any worse of
games. Mostly satisfied, but not entirely.
In the rapid scanning of my mental
archives, Journey was the first hit in response
to the query, "Which games are interesting to
non-gamers?" Even so, the Journey page in
my mind was gibberish. The problem, I've
realized, is that Journey escapes conventional
description. It's not a platformer, it's not a
puzzler and it's certainly not an action game.
Its title reveals nothing about the game.
There's no dialogue, no clear story, no

names, no specific setting, no bosses, no
checkpoints, no life bars, no skill trees and
no death. It's deeply subjective, mingling in
the curious spaces where joy, sorrow, loss
and anger meet. At times it flies; at others it
falls. It's dynamism; it's despair.
It's emotion, in motion.
Ah, yes that sense of movement. I
could never properly capture it without put
ting a controller in your hands. Likewise, I've
never seen a game accomplish so much with
the plain action of pushing a joystick for
ward. You feel exhausted trudging through
the sand, then elated as you ski down the
opposite slope, riding the winds as they twirl
your scarf and tug at your robes. Your
strength later fades as the elements claim
you; a blizzard closes in, your legs grow
heavy. With an earnest, caring focus, you
push a bit harder on the joystick but to
no avail. One knee falls, then you collapse.
After that comes the game's best use of
motion, which I won't spoil. It's eye-opening,
really, for a single gameplay mechanic to
move you through all the emotional peaks

and valleys of a stirring concerto.
I wondered for some time how such a
simple game could pull so fiercely at my
heartstrings. It's precisely that austerity,
though, that makes Journey so provocative.
It reduces the explicit experience to basic,
sub-cortical reactions, stripping us bare and
letting us bring our own emotionality to the
table. For that reason I came to think of
Journey as really knowing me as a person
a ridiculous notion, of course, but one that's
grounded in the game's design.
Journey never holds your hand. It does
n't put a marker on a map or tell you to go
anywhere, and it forgoes most games' abra
sive reminders to "press square to attack!"
Such interruption, after all, would wake the
placid dreamer. It merely lets you wander as
you will, sweeping you oh-so-gently onto the
proper path with a cool breeze here or a
sharp ledge there. A mountain beckons in
the distance, across the sands. You'll feel so
much more purpose, more weight, from
deciding to travel there instead of having the
game slap a nav-point on it. In that way,

Journey seems to anticipate precisely what
you will do without ever making you do it. It
never tries to force a reaction out of you, but
rather feels like an extension of feelings you
already have. It's a bit like a dream, you

might agree.
Journey's most surreal experience, no
doubt, comes from encountering another

wanderer. Considering the racist 12-year-olds
who plague an average match of Halo, I'd
assume that any hint of genuine emotion

would be dashed away with the inclusion of
multiplayer. But fourney, in its own elegant
way, deftly avoids this problem. Players
remain nameless and mute, lingering in your
game only as long as they desire. You might
travel together for a time or move past each
other like strangers in a train station. If you
cooperate, you'll build a silent bond. A simple
language emerges as you look at one another,
walk off a bit and chirp to your companion
with the game's one-button singing mechan
ic. "Follow me," you both understand.
Inevitably, then, you'll be stung when they
leave your side. There are no rules, no tech
nobabble and certainly no screaming adoles
cents. It's just two strangers in a strange land,
like innocent children on the same play
ground. Somehow, Journey solved the prob
lem of fostering real, in-game intimacy by
stripping out all the traditional ways that
games let us communicate. And it's beautiful.
Simple as it seems, Journey is a cryptic
experience. I doubt if I could ever throw
enough words onto the Internet to capture
all its subtle nuances. But that mystery belies
a compelling, unadorned elegance that any
one with a heart would find moving. In so
doing, Journey is a powerful case for games
being a unique and engaging medium. Even
if I can't win you over with words on a page,
I suggest you pick up a controller and give it
a try yourself.


Playing Journey is a bit like sliding
through an exotic dream. It's exhila
rating one moment, sad the next, and,
inherently, the experience is solely yours, the
dreamer's. The intensity of such things, for
better or worse, will always fade when you
leave the bed or put down the controller. The
sights and sounds evaporate in daylight, and
the experience boils away to lingering, naked
emotion. When someone asks if you had any
dreams last night, you're at a loss for words.
But you have no lack of feelings, difficult

though they are to convey.
