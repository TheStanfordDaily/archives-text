# LISTS
## FIVE RESTAURANTS as told by their (fictional) patrons 
### â€“ alex BAYER contact ALEX: abayer@stanford. edu 
The first part because I like food and
getting off campus. The second
because a list of restaurants seemed
quite drab, and I happen to be in the mood
for role-play.
Lavanda, Palo Alto (upscale
Mediterranean, read: PARENTS WEEK
END): I am a classy businessman in my
early 60s on a double date with my wife,
who I met in college, and Nancy and Steve,
who we also know from college. We enjoy
wine and live jazz trios. At dinner, we remi
nisce about our days at said college in exag
gerated tones and talk about cultured things,
like the independent movie (I mean, film)

we just saw at the Aquarius. Or the Guild.
Or Cine Arts Palo Alto.
Reposado, Palo Alto (upscale Mexican,
read: PARENTS WEEKEND): I am a 20-
something member of a hip, promising start
up, and a 50-year-old investor is taking us
broke 20-somethings out for a good dinner at a
buzzy place that still makes him look young
and exotic. Ele entertains us with stories of
when he was a 20-something, continuing his
ploy to relate to us. He is most likely a VC with
a scratched up motorcycle and a lonely condo.
Oreris Hummus Shop, Palo Alto (mid
priced Israeli/Mediterranean; good for a
night out every couple weeks): I am a carefree

girl in my late 20s, out to dinner with my for
mer sorority sistaaas for a little reunion. We all
work in the Bay for different consulting firms,
but like, we're all so busy with advancing our
careers and being modern women and finding
the cute leader of a promising start-up 1
mean, Mr. Right that we hardly have time
to loosen up like this. You girls want pita?
Waiter, could we get more PITAAAH for the
table and another bottle of that wine? I'm real
ly "tryna" get my rip, dip, eat on here.
Thaiphoon, Palo Alto (mid-to-high
priced Thai, as far as Thai goes; good for a
quality meal every now and then): I am a sin
gle man in my late 40s who is eating alone
because, while I appreciate culinary finesse, I
am a hopeless romantic who will someday
resort to marrying a very loud-mouthed
woman I like only mildly. I offer extra soup to
the table with two girls next to me as a kind
gesture, but they stare at me like I'm a creep
or something. I do not like chain restaurants.
(Based on true events.)
Shiva's Indian Restaurant and Bar,
Mountain View (reasonably-priced Indian;
go for the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet for
$12): I am a middle-aged woman with purple
hair and purple glasses out for the first time
with my newly minted husband, a fellow
divorcee. We are with his adopted, grown
stepchild, Young-fun, who sits at the table in
silence, and Young-Jun's newly discovered
birth mother, who also stares at me in silence.
(Based on true events.)

The first part because I like food and
getting off campus. The second
because a list of restaurants seemed
