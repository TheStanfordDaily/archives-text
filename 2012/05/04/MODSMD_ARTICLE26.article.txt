# STANFORD WISH LIST

Listen, I just spent an entire
weekend with a fake smile
plastered on my face for

the ProFros, pretending that
everything here is perfect when I
was actually trying to start and
finish a p-set in two hours. I
know I wasn't the only one con
ning the Class of 'l6; I saw a
group of girls tanning in the
Oval, casually laying on a Stanford
flag instead of an actual towel (?!)
with Cardinal-colored bikinis on
(?!?!), as if this is something that
happens in real life. So my reality
check on Sunday when I stood in

the line at Coupa to spend my
21st dollar on coffee in three days
was not the happiest. Stanford is
incredible, don't get me wrong,
but there are a couple things that
some of us might like to see to
make campus life a little easier.
Coffee with meal plan dollars
Let's return to the scene of
the crime the Coupa Cafe line.
The problem is not that there
isn't good coffee on campus a

Tiger Spice chai with a shot of
espresso may or may not be one
of the best drinks of all time
but that there are very few
options for which one can simply
swipe his or her SUID and actu
ally use those $5,279 we pay every
year for meals. Combine this with
the fact that all the coffee houses
that take real money are strategi
cally located next to prime
study/class areas, and many
Stanford students find themselves
dishing out hundreds a quarter
trying to keep themselves awake.
And Peet's we love you but what
is with your hours?
Golf carts for all
Here's a common scenario:
"Want to go out tonight? I

hear KA is having something!"
"But KA's so far..."
"Ugh, I know. There's no way
I'm walking all the way over there
in this skirt; it's way too cold.
Maybe we should just call 5-
SURE?"
Ten minutes later...
"The wait is an hour.

Awesome."
Or maybe this scene
describes you more accurately:
You stayed up until 3 a.m. work
ing and thus hit snooze as many
times as possible on your alarm
the next morning, only to realize
you have five minutes to get to a
class that's an eight-minute bike
ride away.
Techies living on East cam
pus or athletes traveling to the
fields all the way from the lower
Row understand the pain of
having to bike a couple miles
(which may or may not obnox
iously be on a slight incline) to
get to almost all your daily
activities. And while the brief
bursts of exercise are great,
Stanford is way too large when
you're in a hurry. Carting gets
you there in half the time, and
you don't have to battle the ele
ments on the way (which are
admittedly few and far between,
but still). Obviously, it's not fea
sible for everyone to have a cart,
but a girl can dream, right?
