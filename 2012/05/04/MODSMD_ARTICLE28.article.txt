## MORE THAN A HIT AND RUN TREASURE TRUCKS

Being trendy can come at a high price.
In the world of fashion, many people
wear uncomfortable footwear to
appear chic. In the tech realm, it's common
to purchase the newest smartphone —
despite its terrible battery life just to keep
up with the changing times. And in the food
world, trendiness often includes going to
sketchy dives or holes-in-the-wall, many of
which are of questionable cleanliness. A
recent example of this phenomenon is the
food truck movement.
Food trucks are a good idea... in theo
ry. In reality, however, many rely solely on
fast methods of cooking such as deep-frying
and use less-than-fresh ingredients. The
Oaxacan Kitchen Mobile, however, defies all
of my preconceptions about food trucks.
What started as a series of cooking classes
and then became a restaurant in Palo Alto
has now become a food truck that travels
around the Palo Alto area.
The Oaxacan Kitchen has been a long
standing vendor at the various farmers' mar
kets in the Bay Area. On many a Sunday
morning, flocks of Palo Alto families and
Stanford students alike can be found waiting
in the massive line at the California Avenue

farmers' market to get a delicious Mexican
brunch. The Oaxacan Kitchen offers a vari
ety of options for breakfast, including chi
laquiles, (tortilla chips drenched in salsa with
many toppings), various tortilla dishes with

poached eggs, breakfast burritos and huevos
rancheros. When I get breakfast, I normally
order a memela a thick corn tortilla
topped with black bean puree and then
add the seasonal veggies and a poached egg.

It is topped with crumbly Mexican cheese,
guacamole and green salsa. Every bite of this
magical (and massive) memela offers a dif
ferent texture, temperature and flavor, from
the warm, runny egg to the cool, salty
cheese to the tangy guacamole and tomatil
lo salsa.
But to complicate the eternal brunch
paradox, they also offer excellent lunch
choices, from tacos to quesadillas to
empanadas. Their empanadas are not what
come to mind when one thinks of an
empanada they are much more like que
sadillas on steroids. They are homemade tor
tillas stuffed with cheese and vegetables or
chicken. What might be rather plain on its
own is enhanced by the salsas my favorite
is the spicy, red one.
And, for Stanford students who really
don't want to leave the bubble to go across
the street to the farmers' market, the
Oaxacan Kitchen Mobile can be found (usu
ally once or twice a week) on campus for
lunch or dinner. For a schedule of its where
abouts, check http://www.oaxacankitchen
mobile.com.
While there is about a five- to 10-minute
wait time for the food, it is worth every sec
ond because it guarantees that the food is
made on the spot, as opposed to sitting
around for hours. This delicious Oaxacan
fare tastes unlike anything I've ever had: it's
one trend that is all it's hyped up to be.
