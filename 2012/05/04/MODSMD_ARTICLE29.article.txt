W hen I shirk away from a problem
set to sit in mindless bliss on my
computer, Reddit and Imgur
(Reddit minus words) are my go-to sites.
(Not to mention Facebook, which is, regret
tably, a given.) Few other things can capture
my attention so addictively. As of late, how
ever, some Tumblr accounts have been
catching my eye. Texts From Bennett was, of

course, a work of art, but the relatively recent
#whatshouldwecallme page proves to be a
sinkhole for productivity.
Little did I know my problem set would
have to wait even longer, as Stanford spin
offs started popping up, most notably
#whatshouldwecallstanford and #what
shouldstanfordcallme. These Tumblr pages
have quickly developed a following within
the Stanford community for their witty,
Stanford-related humor.

Just like the original #whatshouldwe
callme page, the spin-offs take GIFs (very
short, looping, video-ish clips) from popular

media and give them funny, clever captions
that Stanford students can relate to. They
emphasize the idea of what students are real
ly thinking in the context of day-to-day cam
pus life. For instance, they provide a realistic
depiction of students' reactions to certain
events, whether going to Late Nite, attempt
ing to study or coping with the long walk to
KA down Scary Path. A textual description
does little justice to the full package of cap
tion and GIF, so I highly recommend check
ing the pages out.
The real question, however, is: Who's
behind it all? Rumors are circulating that

someone in the Greek community is regulat
ing the #whatshouldstanfordcallme page,
given its sorority references. But who's to say?
There are a number of brilliantly funny
Stanford students capable of such a feat.
Perhaps a merry band of pranksters is up to
the task. We can only hope the ingenuity and
simplistic style are left intact, because really,
why ruin a good thing?
