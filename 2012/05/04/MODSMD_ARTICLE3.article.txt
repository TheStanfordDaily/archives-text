# Examining mental health resources
## Admins, students speak about CAPS, Bridge Peer Counseling Center 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
This is the third in a four-part series
exploring crisis response and mental
health resources on campus.

Roughly 3,000 undergraduate
and graduate students utilize Coun
seling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) or receive off-campus treat
ment each year, according to CAPS
director Ron Albucher. CAPS has
experienced growth in student use
consistently over the last five years.
Student experiences both
positive and negative shed light
on the organization. Satisfaction
with CAPS services differs widely
among students.

The Daily examined the re
sources offered by CAPS and The
Bridge Peer Counseling Center and
undertook an informal survey of stu
dent experience.

Increased usage
Both CAPS and The Bridge Peer
Counseling Center have experi
enced increases in student usage in
recent years. Both organizations cite
relationship issues, depression and
stress as the primary factors that
bring students in.

Albucher, who said CAPS sees

about 2,200 unique students per
year, or 14 percent of the campus
population, said that an additional
six to seven percent of campus seeks
treatment outside of CAPS, accord
ing to self-reported data.

CAPS has seen an influx of fund
ing and personnel since Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Greg Boardman
initiated a Mental Health and Well
Being task force in 2008, following a
string of student suicides. Since 2008,
CAPS has hired the equivalent of
nine full time employees who are
psychotherapists, psychologists and
case managers rounding out a
workforce of roughly 40 people.
In that time, Albucher said, the
University has gone from having less
than the recommended ratio of one
counselor per 1,500 students to hav
ing about twice the recommended
number of specialists.

As CAPS reports a steady in
crease in the number of students uti
lizing its services, The Bridge Peer
Counseling Center says it has also
experienced an increase in traffic.
The Bridge which offers 24/7
counseling by phone has roughly
30 staff counselors and four live-in
counselors at Rogers House, which is
open for drop-in counsels from 9
a.m. to midnight. Between 30 and
40 students take The Bridge's two
required training classes each
quarter.
A student Bridge counselor
said this size is feasible given
space and personnel constraints,
but added, "it would be nice to
scale that up a little bit."
Albucher said the same about
CAPS resources, commenting
that "we could always use more."
"Each year has always been
busier than the last, going back
the last five years," Albucher said,
commenting that this year's data
will not be analyzed until the end
of spring quarter. "I would expect
overall that this academic year,
we'll still see this kind of an in
crease."
This quarter. The Bridge has
experienced a spike in calls, possi
bly caused by two recent student
deaths.
"We are getting a spike of calls
related to mental health and ill
ness and the loss of Cady and
Sam," said Bridge counselor Ak
shay Gopalan 'l2 to The Daily in
April.
CAPS has seen a similar trend,
Albucher said.
But Gopalan, who currently
teaches the Bridge training class
es and has served as a financial co
ordinator for the group, said that
the majority of calls are related to
relationships issues romantic,
social and familial followed by
academic issues general stress
and anxiety about pending proba
tions or suspensions.
Depression-related counsels
ranked third in 2011 data on the
Center's work.
CAPS reported more counsels
related to mental health than The
Bridge, and Albucher said that
the factors that cause students to
utilize CAPS have remained con
stant over the years.
"The number one issue that
brings people in are relationship
issues," Albucher said. "Two and
three are depression and anxiety
symptoms."
Albucher said that generally,
students are reporting less stigma
about mental health care.
Short and mid-term solutions
The Bridge and CAPS each
offer, respectively, short- and
mid-term counseling to students,
with each serving as a transition
to care for students who need
psychiatric treatment in longer in
crements.
The Bridge is meant to serve as
a one-time, short-term resource
for student counseling. The
Bridge's general counseling style,
Gopalan said, is driven by the
counselee and not the counselor.
"We [have] students talk
through everything they're going
through and systematically break
down complex thoughts and emo
tions into manageable steps, [and]
create an action plan that is feasi

ble and short-term," Gopalan
said, saying that many students
like talking to peers to resolve is
sues.
Bridge calls tend to last one to
two hours, Gopalan said.
Alejandro Martinez, a senior
associate director at CAPS, a pri
mary advisor to The Bridge and
an instructor of its training cours
es, said The Bridge is a great first
resource for mental health.
"If a person has a place to call,
that is the most critical step in get
ting help," Martinez said. "And
that is something The Bridge does
exceedingly well."
Kai-Yuan Neo 'l4 said he went
to The Bridge and CAPS each for
the first time last month and de
scribed positive experiences.
"I highly recommend both,"
Neo said, commenting that access
to The Bridge was convenient be
cause it was open late and didn't
feel as serious as talking to a pro
fessional counselor.
While The Bridge is meant for
one-time counseling, CAPS
which has both psychologists and
psychiatrists, who can prescribe
medication offers more regu
lar meetings.
CAPS used to offer students
10 free counseling sessions per
year, but shifted to a less rigid
model four years ago, Albucher
said. There is no longer a fixed
number of available sessions, but
CAPS prefers to perform short
term counseling in the interest of
seeing more students.
There is no fixed number for
the amount of sessions available
to students, and counselors make
a determination based on the stu
dent's progress and counselor
caseloads.
"For some [students] it might
be 5 to 6 [sessions] for others it
may be 12," Albucher said.
Neo, who said he had been ex
periencing feelings of loneliness
and a lack of excitement since
winter quarter, said he had not
considered either resource before
last month because he perceived
he did not need psychological
help.
Now, he said, he recognizes
something does not need to be
"wrong with him" to utilize CAPS
and has schedule a follow-up
meeting.
"Everybody has small prob
lems it's nice to talk about
them, to make sure everything is
on the right track," Neo said.
Scheduling an appointment
"One of our key priorities is
talking to students the same day
they contact us," Albucher said,
referring to the triage system, in
which students schedule a 5 to 10
minute call with a clinician to as
sess his or her counseling needs.
At the end of this triage call, stu
dents schedule initial sessions
with counselors.
The average wait time be
tween triage and initial meeting is
five days, Albucher said.
Most students who spoke to
The Daily said they have had to
wait a week before seeing CAPS.
Multiple students said they have

experienced waits of longer than
a week, commenting that even a
week can be too long for a student
with a non-crisis health concern.
Jen Wylie 'l3, a resident assis
tant (RA) in Suites, where sopho
more Sam Wopat lived and at
tempted suicide in March, said
that even though she wishes to see
a counselor, the CAPS schedule
does not work with hers. Wylie is a
member of the diving team.
"After Sam's funeral I was re
ally sad," Wylie said. "I tried to
make an appointment with a
CAPS counselor, but my schedule
was so busy. Anytime they can
meet, I can't meet. Anytime I can
meet, they can't meet. It hasn't
happened yet. I feel like it's a lot
of emails back and forth."
Albucher said CAPS some
times receives complaints about
wait time and that he would per
sonally follow up with students
who report grievances.
"We've had complaints about
people not being able to get in a
timely way," Albucher said. "I
take those seriously and want to
hear about those from students."
Switching counselors
A student may not find a good
match with his or her initial coun
selor. While some might stick with
a partnership and others might
decide to stop going to CAPS al
together, one RA spoke of a time
when his own RA helped him
switch counselors.
"When I felt that my CAPS
counselor was a little too stoic
and didn't seem to understand
me, my RA checked in," Charl
ton Soesanto 'll, a co-term stu
dent, wrote in an email to other
RAs as part of a thread on "what
to do about suicide/death" after
The Daily began this series.
"When he found out CAPS was
n't going too well, he sat next to
me, called the director of CAPS
for me, and told him that I need
ed someone new. Now. The next
day I got an appointment with a
new counselor."
Soesanto emphasized that his
new counselor was 'fantastic' in a
follow-up email to The Daily.
Another RA, who identified as
a varsity athlete who dealt with
major depression, said she was
dissatisfied with the services of
both CAPS and The Bridge.
"My experience with CAPs
has not been the best," she wrote.
"Both in times of crisis and in
times of simple distress, it has
taken up to a month for me to
have a session where I get to seri
ously address issues with a trained
counselor. At the Bridge I do not
feel that students who wish to talk
to a trained counselor can really
get what they need."
Addressing sexual assault
A female sophomore reported
waiting two weeks to be seen after
a sexual assault on campus in
2011.
"I called triage on February 8
and the first available appoint
ment they had was February 21,"
she said, adding that she had de
scribed symptoms of depression,

said she had been assaulted, and
reported not being at risk to harm
herself. "They said that I could
come in for an on-call clinician."
The student said she canceled
her relationship with CAPS after
two counseling sessions because
of the tone she perceived when
discussing strategies for avoiding
a future attack.
"Within two appointments, it
was recommended that I take
Prozac and that —in order to
avoid being assaulted in the fu
ture I reevaluate my clothing
choices," she said.
The student said she could not
sleep for four days after being
blamed for her attack and spent
the following month ridden to her
bed.
"It confirmed my fears that
what I was experiencing was my
own fault," she said.
"The whole goal of sexual as
sault counseling would be to not
make the student feel like they
are to blame for any of it," Al
bucher said, commenting that he
could only speak generally and
not to any specific case.
Albucher expressed that such
an incident was concerning.
"I would hope that the student
can come and set up a time to
meet with me and I'd be happy to
figure out what went wrong, what
was said, and take steps to if
there was a problem on our end
to fix that," he said.
"I certainly don't want anyone
in any way, shape or form
getting that message."
Despite her experience, the
sophomore said she would still
recommend CAPS to people
dealing with most mental health
issues.
"I would recommend CAPS to
friends, because I'm sure my ex
perience isn't a universal one,"
she said, though she added that
given her experience she would
not recommend CAPS to a stu
dent who is a victim of sexual as
sault.
"I wouldn't feel comfortable
recommending CAPS if that ex
perience had even been a possi
bility."
The University opened the Of
fice for Sexual Assault and Rela
tionship Abuse (SARA) Educa
tion and Response last June to
serve as an additional resource
for students.
Addressing serious depression
Two students with serious
mental health issues reached out to
The Daily following the first article
in this series. Both students, who
said they had not discussed their
experiences with many others on
campus, agreed to speak with The
Daily under the condition of com
plete anonymity.
Student X is an undergraduate
who has an anxiety disorder and
major depression. Student X has
taken multiple leaves of absence
and is currently home seeking
long-term treatment.
Student Y is a junior with a fam
ily history of depression and has
battled the illness since early child
hood.

Student X said she appreciated
resources from The Bridge, but
that it could not meet her needs.
"I used The Bridge a few times,
but 1 feel like the severity of my de
pression was a little bit too much
for a peer counselor to handle,"
student X said. "I thought it was
nice that that resource was there."
She expressed similar senti
ments about CAPS.
"I really appreciated the fact
that there were 10 free sessions per
quarter," student X said. "My
qualm was that I didn't really feel
connected with my personal coun
selor."
"My counselor gave me general
tips — deep breathing, writing
down worries," she said. "I wish
he'd listened more and taken me a
little more seriously in terms of my
concerns, worries, fears."
Student X said she didn't know
that it was an option to switch
counselors.
While neither resource worked
for her, she said she was "very
grateful" to Stanford for connect
ing her to treatment at home.
Student Y said no one at CAPS
communicated that seeing a regu
lar psychiatrist at Stanford Hospi
tal was a viable option, even
though she began seeing a special
ist there following a suicide at
tempt.
"I brought it up earlier with
someone at CAPS," she said. "They
said there was no insurance — it
would be so much more expensive.
It really discouraged me."
Student Y said "it was not the
case" that going to Stanford Hospi
tal was not expensive.
Off campus referrals
If a therapist, when coming up
with an assessment for students,
thinks the student's difficulty can
not be handled short term, CAPS
will recommend students to seek
longer-term treatment in an outpa
tient center, Albucher said.
Albucher said that Stanford will
partner with a new mental health
insurance benefits company in the
2012-13 academic year that will
help students in Cardinal Care find
good providers in the local com
munity.
"If they don't want to come to
CAPS that's fine, we'll help them
get healthcare elsewhere," Albuch
er said.
Sarah Quartey '14 said she also
left CAPS after a few sessions, but
because she thought long-term
care would be more beneficial.
"I came to campus with a lot of
mental health issues — definitely
depressed, showing signs of OCD,
anxiety disorder and other things,"
Quartey said.
Quartey said that she went to
CAPS for a while, but now sees an
off-campus counselor every week.
She said that Stanford's Office of
Financial Aid was able to cover
her co-pay for the off-site services
and that CAPS led her to that re
source.
"CAPS was a really user-friend
ly way to start," she said.

This is the third in a four-part series
exploring crisis response and mental
health resources on campus.

Roughly 3,000 undergraduate
and graduate students utilize Coun
seling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) or receive off-campus treat
ment each year, according to CAPS
director Ron Albucher. CAPS has
experienced growth in student use
consistently over the last five years.
Student experiences both
positive and negative shed light
on the organization. Satisfaction
with CAPS services differs widely
among students.

The Daily examined the re
sources offered by CAPS and The
Bridge Peer Counseling Center and
undertook an informal survey of stu
dent experience.

Increased usage
Both CAPS and The Bridge Peer
Counseling Center have experi
enced increases in student usage in
recent years. Both organizations cite
relationship issues, depression and
stress as the primary factors that
bring students in.

Albucher, who said CAPS sees

about 2,200 unique students per
year, or 14 percent of the campus
population, said that an additional
six to seven percent of campus seeks
treatment outside of CAPS, accord
ing to self-reported data.

CAPS has seen an influx of fund
ing and personnel since Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Greg Boardman
initiated a Mental Health and Well
Being task force in 2008, following a
string of student suicides. Since 2008,
CAPS has hired the equivalent of
nine full time employees who are
psychotherapists, psychologists and
case managers rounding out a
workforce of roughly 40 people.
In that time, Albucher said, the
University has gone from having less
than the recommended ratio of one
counselor per 1,500 students to hav
ing about twice the recommended
number of specialists.

As CAPS reports a steady in
crease in the number of students uti
lizing its services, The Bridge Peer
Counseling Center says it has also
experienced an increase in traffic.
The Bridge which offers 24/7
counseling by phone has roughly
30 staff counselors and four live-in
counselors at Rogers House, which is
open for drop-in counsels from 9
a.m. to midnight. Between 30 and
40 students take The Bridge's two
required training classes each
quarter.
A student Bridge counselor
said this size is feasible given
space and personnel constraints,
but added, "it would be nice to
scale that up a little bit."
Albucher said the same about
CAPS resources, commenting
that "we could always use more."
"Each year has always been
busier than the last, going back
the last five years," Albucher said,
commenting that this year's data
will not be analyzed until the end
of spring quarter. "I would expect
overall that this academic year,
we'll still see this kind of an in
crease."
This quarter. The Bridge has
experienced a spike in calls, possi
bly caused by two recent student
deaths.
"We are getting a spike of calls
related to mental health and ill
ness and the loss of Cady and
Sam," said Bridge counselor Ak
shay Gopalan 'l2 to The Daily in
April.
CAPS has seen a similar trend,
Albucher said.
But Gopalan, who currently
teaches the Bridge training class
es and has served as a financial co
ordinator for the group, said that
the majority of calls are related to
relationships issues romantic,
social and familial followed by
academic issues general stress
and anxiety about pending proba
tions or suspensions.
Depression-related counsels
ranked third in 2011 data on the
Center's work.
CAPS reported more counsels
related to mental health than The
Bridge, and Albucher said that
the factors that cause students to
utilize CAPS have remained con
stant over the years.
"The number one issue that
brings people in are relationship
issues," Albucher said. "Two and
three are depression and anxiety
symptoms."
Albucher said that generally,
students are reporting less stigma
about mental health care.
Short and mid-term solutions
The Bridge and CAPS each
offer, respectively, short- and
mid-term counseling to students,
with each serving as a transition
to care for students who need
psychiatric treatment in longer in
crements.
The Bridge is meant to serve as
a one-time, short-term resource
for student counseling. The
Bridge's general counseling style,
Gopalan said, is driven by the
counselee and not the counselor.
"We [have] students talk
through everything they're going
through and systematically break
down complex thoughts and emo
tions into manageable steps, [and]
create an action plan that is feasi

ble and short-term," Gopalan
said, saying that many students
like talking to peers to resolve is
sues.
Bridge calls tend to last one to
two hours, Gopalan said.
Alejandro Martinez, a senior
associate director at CAPS, a pri
mary advisor to The Bridge and
an instructor of its training cours
es, said The Bridge is a great first
resource for mental health.
"If a person has a place to call,
that is the most critical step in get
ting help," Martinez said. "And
that is something The Bridge does
exceedingly well."
Kai-Yuan Neo 'l4 said he went
to The Bridge and CAPS each for
the first time last month and de
scribed positive experiences.
"I highly recommend both,"
Neo said, commenting that access
to The Bridge was convenient be
cause it was open late and didn't
feel as serious as talking to a pro
fessional counselor.
While The Bridge is meant for
one-time counseling, CAPS
which has both psychologists and
psychiatrists, who can prescribe
medication offers more regu
lar meetings.
CAPS used to offer students
10 free counseling sessions per
year, but shifted to a less rigid
model four years ago, Albucher
said. There is no longer a fixed
number of available sessions, but
CAPS prefers to perform short
term counseling in the interest of
seeing more students.
There is no fixed number for
the amount of sessions available
to students, and counselors make
a determination based on the stu
dent's progress and counselor
caseloads.
"For some [students] it might
be 5 to 6 [sessions] for others it
may be 12," Albucher said.
Neo, who said he had been ex
periencing feelings of loneliness
and a lack of excitement since
winter quarter, said he had not
considered either resource before
last month because he perceived
he did not need psychological
help.
Now, he said, he recognizes
something does not need to be
"wrong with him" to utilize CAPS
and has schedule a follow-up
meeting.
"Everybody has small prob
lems it's nice to talk about
them, to make sure everything is
on the right track," Neo said.
Scheduling an appointment
"One of our key priorities is
talking to students the same day
they contact us," Albucher said,
referring to the triage system, in
which students schedule a 5 to 10
minute call with a clinician to as
sess his or her counseling needs.
At the end of this triage call, stu
dents schedule initial sessions
with counselors.
The average wait time be
tween triage and initial meeting is
five days, Albucher said.
Most students who spoke to
The Daily said they have had to
wait a week before seeing CAPS.
Multiple students said they have

experienced waits of longer than
a week, commenting that even a
week can be too long for a student
with a non-crisis health concern.
Jen Wylie 'l3, a resident assis
tant (RA) in Suites, where sopho
more Sam Wopat lived and at
tempted suicide in March, said
that even though she wishes to see
a counselor, the CAPS schedule
does not work with hers. Wylie is a
member of the diving team.
"After Sam's funeral I was re
ally sad," Wylie said. "I tried to
make an appointment with a
CAPS counselor, but my schedule
was so busy. Anytime they can
meet, I can't meet. Anytime I can
meet, they can't meet. It hasn't
happened yet. I feel like it's a lot
of emails back and forth."
Albucher said CAPS some
times receives complaints about
wait time and that he would per
sonally follow up with students
who report grievances.
"We've had complaints about
people not being able to get in a
timely way," Albucher said. "I
take those seriously and want to
hear about those from students."
Switching counselors
A student may not find a good
match with his or her initial coun
selor. While some might stick with
a partnership and others might
decide to stop going to CAPS al
together, one RA spoke of a time
when his own RA helped him
switch counselors.
"When I felt that my CAPS
counselor was a little too stoic
and didn't seem to understand
me, my RA checked in," Charl
ton Soesanto 'll, a co-term stu
dent, wrote in an email to other
RAs as part of a thread on "what
to do about suicide/death" after
The Daily began this series.
"When he found out CAPS was
n't going too well, he sat next to
me, called the director of CAPS
for me, and told him that I need
ed someone new. Now. The next
day I got an appointment with a
new counselor."
Soesanto emphasized that his
new counselor was 'fantastic' in a
follow-up email to The Daily.
Another RA, who identified as
a varsity athlete who dealt with
major depression, said she was
dissatisfied with the services of
both CAPS and The Bridge.
"My experience with CAPs
has not been the best," she wrote.
"Both in times of crisis and in
times of simple distress, it has
taken up to a month for me to
have a session where I get to seri
ously address issues with a trained
counselor. At the Bridge I do not
feel that students who wish to talk
to a trained counselor can really
get what they need."
Addressing sexual assault
A female sophomore reported
waiting two weeks to be seen after
a sexual assault on campus in
2011.
"I called triage on February 8
and the first available appoint
ment they had was February 21,"
she said, adding that she had de
scribed symptoms of depression,

said she had been assaulted, and
reported not being at risk to harm
herself. "They said that I could
come in for an on-call clinician."
The student said she canceled
her relationship with CAPS after
two counseling sessions because
of the tone she perceived when
discussing strategies for avoiding
a future attack.
"Within two appointments, it
was recommended that I take
Prozac and that —in order to
avoid being assaulted in the fu
ture I reevaluate my clothing
choices," she said.
The student said she could not
sleep for four days after being
blamed for her attack and spent
the following month ridden to her
bed.
"It confirmed my fears that
what I was experiencing was my
own fault," she said.
"The whole goal of sexual as
sault counseling would be to not
make the student feel like they
are to blame for any of it," Al
bucher said, commenting that he
could only speak generally and
not to any specific case.
Albucher expressed that such
an incident was concerning.
"I would hope that the student
can come and set up a time to
meet with me and I'd be happy to
figure out what went wrong, what
was said, and take steps to if
there was a problem on our end
to fix that," he said.
"I certainly don't want anyone
in any way, shape or form
getting that message."
Despite her experience, the
sophomore said she would still
recommend CAPS to people
dealing with most mental health
issues.
"I would recommend CAPS to
friends, because I'm sure my ex
perience isn't a universal one,"
she said, though she added that
given her experience she would
not recommend CAPS to a stu
dent who is a victim of sexual as
sault.
"I wouldn't feel comfortable
recommending CAPS if that ex
perience had even been a possi
bility."
The University opened the Of
fice for Sexual Assault and Rela
tionship Abuse (SARA) Educa
tion and Response last June to
serve as an additional resource
for students.
Addressing serious depression
Two students with serious
mental health issues reached out to
The Daily following the first article
in this series. Both students, who
said they had not discussed their
experiences with many others on
campus, agreed to speak with The
Daily under the condition of com
plete anonymity.
Student X is an undergraduate
who has an anxiety disorder and
major depression. Student X has
taken multiple leaves of absence
and is currently home seeking
long-term treatment.
Student Y is a junior with a fam
ily history of depression and has
battled the illness since early child
hood.

Student X said she appreciated
resources from The Bridge, but
that it could not meet her needs.
"I used The Bridge a few times,
but 1 feel like the severity of my de
pression was a little bit too much
for a peer counselor to handle,"
student X said. "I thought it was
nice that that resource was there."
She expressed similar senti
ments about CAPS.
"I really appreciated the fact
that there were 10 free sessions per
quarter," student X said. "My
qualm was that I didn't really feel
connected with my personal coun
selor."
"My counselor gave me general
tips — deep breathing, writing
down worries," she said. "I wish
he'd listened more and taken me a
little more seriously in terms of my
concerns, worries, fears."
Student X said she didn't know
that it was an option to switch
counselors.
While neither resource worked
for her, she said she was "very
grateful" to Stanford for connect
ing her to treatment at home.
Student Y said no one at CAPS
communicated that seeing a regu
lar psychiatrist at Stanford Hospi
tal was a viable option, even
though she began seeing a special
ist there following a suicide at
tempt.
"I brought it up earlier with
someone at CAPS," she said. "They
said there was no insurance — it
would be so much more expensive.
It really discouraged me."
Student Y said "it was not the
case" that going to Stanford Hospi
tal was not expensive.
Off campus referrals
If a therapist, when coming up
with an assessment for students,
thinks the student's difficulty can
not be handled short term, CAPS
will recommend students to seek
longer-term treatment in an outpa
tient center, Albucher said.
Albucher said that Stanford will
partner with a new mental health
insurance benefits company in the
2012-13 academic year that will
help students in Cardinal Care find
good providers in the local com
munity.
"If they don't want to come to
CAPS that's fine, we'll help them
get healthcare elsewhere," Albuch
er said.
Sarah Quartey '14 said she also
left CAPS after a few sessions, but
because she thought long-term
care would be more beneficial.
"I came to campus with a lot of
mental health issues — definitely
depressed, showing signs of OCD,
anxiety disorder and other things,"
Quartey said.
Quartey said that she went to
CAPS for a while, but now sees an
off-campus counselor every week.
She said that Stanford's Office of
Financial Aid was able to cover
her co-pay for the off-site services
and that CAPS led her to that re
source.
"CAPS was a really user-friend
ly way to start," she said.

This is the third in a four-part series
exploring crisis response and mental
health resources on campus.

Roughly 3,000 undergraduate
and graduate students utilize Coun
seling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) or receive off-campus treat
ment each year, according to CAPS
director Ron Albucher. CAPS has
experienced growth in student use
consistently over the last five years.
Student experiences both
positive and negative shed light
on the organization. Satisfaction
with CAPS services differs widely
among students.

The Daily examined the re
sources offered by CAPS and The
Bridge Peer Counseling Center and
undertook an informal survey of stu
dent experience.

Increased usage
Both CAPS and The Bridge Peer
Counseling Center have experi
enced increases in student usage in
recent years. Both organizations cite
relationship issues, depression and
stress as the primary factors that
bring students in.

Albucher, who said CAPS sees

about 2,200 unique students per
year, or 14 percent of the campus
population, said that an additional
six to seven percent of campus seeks
treatment outside of CAPS, accord
ing to self-reported data.

CAPS has seen an influx of fund
ing and personnel since Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Greg Boardman
initiated a Mental Health and Well
Being task force in 2008, following a
string of student suicides. Since 2008,
CAPS has hired the equivalent of
nine full time employees who are
psychotherapists, psychologists and
case managers rounding out a
workforce of roughly 40 people.
In that time, Albucher said, the
University has gone from having less
than the recommended ratio of one
counselor per 1,500 students to hav
ing about twice the recommended
number of specialists.

As CAPS reports a steady in
crease in the number of students uti
lizing its services, The Bridge Peer
Counseling Center says it has also
experienced an increase in traffic.
The Bridge which offers 24/7
counseling by phone has roughly
30 staff counselors and four live-in
counselors at Rogers House, which is
open for drop-in counsels from 9
a.m. to midnight. Between 30 and
40 students take The Bridge's two
required training classes each
quarter.
A student Bridge counselor
said this size is feasible given
space and personnel constraints,
but added, "it would be nice to
scale that up a little bit."
Albucher said the same about
CAPS resources, commenting
that "we could always use more."
"Each year has always been
busier than the last, going back
the last five years," Albucher said,
commenting that this year's data
will not be analyzed until the end
of spring quarter. "I would expect
overall that this academic year,
we'll still see this kind of an in
crease."
This quarter. The Bridge has
experienced a spike in calls, possi
bly caused by two recent student
deaths.
"We are getting a spike of calls
related to mental health and ill
ness and the loss of Cady and
Sam," said Bridge counselor Ak
shay Gopalan 'l2 to The Daily in
April.
CAPS has seen a similar trend,
Albucher said.
But Gopalan, who currently
teaches the Bridge training class
es and has served as a financial co
ordinator for the group, said that
the majority of calls are related to
relationships issues romantic,
social and familial followed by
academic issues general stress
and anxiety about pending proba
tions or suspensions.
Depression-related counsels
ranked third in 2011 data on the
Center's work.
CAPS reported more counsels
related to mental health than The
Bridge, and Albucher said that
the factors that cause students to
utilize CAPS have remained con
stant over the years.
"The number one issue that
brings people in are relationship
issues," Albucher said. "Two and
three are depression and anxiety
symptoms."
Albucher said that generally,
students are reporting less stigma
about mental health care.
Short and mid-term solutions
The Bridge and CAPS each
offer, respectively, short- and
mid-term counseling to students,
with each serving as a transition
to care for students who need
psychiatric treatment in longer in
crements.
The Bridge is meant to serve as
a one-time, short-term resource
for student counseling. The
Bridge's general counseling style,
Gopalan said, is driven by the
counselee and not the counselor.
"We [have] students talk
through everything they're going
through and systematically break
down complex thoughts and emo
tions into manageable steps, [and]
create an action plan that is feasi

ble and short-term," Gopalan
said, saying that many students
like talking to peers to resolve is
sues.
Bridge calls tend to last one to
two hours, Gopalan said.
Alejandro Martinez, a senior
associate director at CAPS, a pri
mary advisor to The Bridge and
an instructor of its training cours
es, said The Bridge is a great first
resource for mental health.
"If a person has a place to call,
that is the most critical step in get
ting help," Martinez said. "And
that is something The Bridge does
exceedingly well."
Kai-Yuan Neo 'l4 said he went
to The Bridge and CAPS each for
the first time last month and de
scribed positive experiences.
"I highly recommend both,"
Neo said, commenting that access
to The Bridge was convenient be
cause it was open late and didn't
feel as serious as talking to a pro
fessional counselor.
While The Bridge is meant for
one-time counseling, CAPS
which has both psychologists and
psychiatrists, who can prescribe
medication offers more regu
lar meetings.
CAPS used to offer students
10 free counseling sessions per
year, but shifted to a less rigid
model four years ago, Albucher
said. There is no longer a fixed
number of available sessions, but
CAPS prefers to perform short
term counseling in the interest of
seeing more students.
There is no fixed number for
the amount of sessions available
to students, and counselors make
a determination based on the stu
dent's progress and counselor
caseloads.
"For some [students] it might
be 5 to 6 [sessions] for others it
may be 12," Albucher said.
Neo, who said he had been ex
periencing feelings of loneliness
and a lack of excitement since
winter quarter, said he had not
considered either resource before
last month because he perceived
he did not need psychological
help.
Now, he said, he recognizes
something does not need to be
"wrong with him" to utilize CAPS
and has schedule a follow-up
meeting.
"Everybody has small prob
lems it's nice to talk about
them, to make sure everything is
on the right track," Neo said.
Scheduling an appointment
"One of our key priorities is
talking to students the same day
they contact us," Albucher said,
referring to the triage system, in
which students schedule a 5 to 10
minute call with a clinician to as
sess his or her counseling needs.
At the end of this triage call, stu
dents schedule initial sessions
with counselors.
The average wait time be
tween triage and initial meeting is
five days, Albucher said.
Most students who spoke to
The Daily said they have had to
wait a week before seeing CAPS.
Multiple students said they have

experienced waits of longer than
a week, commenting that even a
week can be too long for a student
with a non-crisis health concern.
Jen Wylie 'l3, a resident assis
tant (RA) in Suites, where sopho
more Sam Wopat lived and at
tempted suicide in March, said
that even though she wishes to see
a counselor, the CAPS schedule
does not work with hers. Wylie is a
member of the diving team.
"After Sam's funeral I was re
ally sad," Wylie said. "I tried to
make an appointment with a
CAPS counselor, but my schedule
was so busy. Anytime they can
meet, I can't meet. Anytime I can
meet, they can't meet. It hasn't
happened yet. I feel like it's a lot
of emails back and forth."
Albucher said CAPS some
times receives complaints about
wait time and that he would per
sonally follow up with students
who report grievances.
"We've had complaints about
people not being able to get in a
timely way," Albucher said. "I
take those seriously and want to
hear about those from students."
Switching counselors
A student may not find a good
match with his or her initial coun
selor. While some might stick with
a partnership and others might
decide to stop going to CAPS al
together, one RA spoke of a time
when his own RA helped him
switch counselors.
"When I felt that my CAPS
counselor was a little too stoic
and didn't seem to understand
me, my RA checked in," Charl
ton Soesanto 'll, a co-term stu
dent, wrote in an email to other
RAs as part of a thread on "what
to do about suicide/death" after
The Daily began this series.
"When he found out CAPS was
n't going too well, he sat next to
me, called the director of CAPS
for me, and told him that I need
ed someone new. Now. The next
day I got an appointment with a
new counselor."
Soesanto emphasized that his
new counselor was 'fantastic' in a
follow-up email to The Daily.
Another RA, who identified as
a varsity athlete who dealt with
major depression, said she was
dissatisfied with the services of
both CAPS and The Bridge.
"My experience with CAPs
has not been the best," she wrote.
"Both in times of crisis and in
times of simple distress, it has
taken up to a month for me to
have a session where I get to seri
ously address issues with a trained
counselor. At the Bridge I do not
feel that students who wish to talk
to a trained counselor can really
get what they need."
Addressing sexual assault
A female sophomore reported
waiting two weeks to be seen after
a sexual assault on campus in
2011.
"I called triage on February 8
and the first available appoint
ment they had was February 21,"
she said, adding that she had de
scribed symptoms of depression,

said she had been assaulted, and
reported not being at risk to harm
herself. "They said that I could
come in for an on-call clinician."
The student said she canceled
her relationship with CAPS after
two counseling sessions because
of the tone she perceived when
discussing strategies for avoiding
a future attack.
"Within two appointments, it
was recommended that I take
Prozac and that —in order to
avoid being assaulted in the fu
ture I reevaluate my clothing
choices," she said.
The student said she could not
sleep for four days after being
blamed for her attack and spent
the following month ridden to her
bed.
"It confirmed my fears that
what I was experiencing was my
own fault," she said.
"The whole goal of sexual as
sault counseling would be to not
make the student feel like they
are to blame for any of it," Al
bucher said, commenting that he
could only speak generally and
not to any specific case.
Albucher expressed that such
an incident was concerning.
"I would hope that the student
can come and set up a time to
meet with me and I'd be happy to
figure out what went wrong, what
was said, and take steps to if
there was a problem on our end
to fix that," he said.
"I certainly don't want anyone
in any way, shape or form
getting that message."
Despite her experience, the
sophomore said she would still
recommend CAPS to people
dealing with most mental health
issues.
"I would recommend CAPS to
friends, because I'm sure my ex
perience isn't a universal one,"
she said, though she added that
given her experience she would
not recommend CAPS to a stu
dent who is a victim of sexual as
sault.
"I wouldn't feel comfortable
recommending CAPS if that ex
perience had even been a possi
bility."
The University opened the Of
fice for Sexual Assault and Rela
tionship Abuse (SARA) Educa
tion and Response last June to
serve as an additional resource
for students.
Addressing serious depression
Two students with serious
mental health issues reached out to
The Daily following the first article
in this series. Both students, who
said they had not discussed their
experiences with many others on
campus, agreed to speak with The
Daily under the condition of com
plete anonymity.
Student X is an undergraduate
who has an anxiety disorder and
major depression. Student X has
taken multiple leaves of absence
and is currently home seeking
long-term treatment.
Student Y is a junior with a fam
ily history of depression and has
battled the illness since early child
hood.

Student X said she appreciated
resources from The Bridge, but
that it could not meet her needs.
"I used The Bridge a few times,
but 1 feel like the severity of my de
pression was a little bit too much
for a peer counselor to handle,"
student X said. "I thought it was
nice that that resource was there."
She expressed similar senti
ments about CAPS.
"I really appreciated the fact
that there were 10 free sessions per
quarter," student X said. "My
qualm was that I didn't really feel
connected with my personal coun
selor."
"My counselor gave me general
tips — deep breathing, writing
down worries," she said. "I wish
he'd listened more and taken me a
little more seriously in terms of my
concerns, worries, fears."
Student X said she didn't know
that it was an option to switch
counselors.
While neither resource worked
for her, she said she was "very
grateful" to Stanford for connect
ing her to treatment at home.
Student Y said no one at CAPS
communicated that seeing a regu
lar psychiatrist at Stanford Hospi
tal was a viable option, even
though she began seeing a special
ist there following a suicide at
tempt.
"I brought it up earlier with
someone at CAPS," she said. "They
said there was no insurance — it
would be so much more expensive.
It really discouraged me."
Student Y said "it was not the
case" that going to Stanford Hospi
tal was not expensive.
Off campus referrals
If a therapist, when coming up
with an assessment for students,
thinks the student's difficulty can
not be handled short term, CAPS
will recommend students to seek
longer-term treatment in an outpa
tient center, Albucher said.
Albucher said that Stanford will
partner with a new mental health
insurance benefits company in the
2012-13 academic year that will
help students in Cardinal Care find
good providers in the local com
munity.
"If they don't want to come to
CAPS that's fine, we'll help them
get healthcare elsewhere," Albuch
er said.
Sarah Quartey '14 said she also
left CAPS after a few sessions, but
because she thought long-term
care would be more beneficial.
"I came to campus with a lot of
mental health issues — definitely
depressed, showing signs of OCD,
anxiety disorder and other things,"
Quartey said.
Quartey said that she went to
CAPS for a while, but now sees an
off-campus counselor every week.
She said that Stanford's Office of
Financial Aid was able to cover
her co-pay for the off-site services
and that CAPS led her to that re
source.
"CAPS was a really user-friend
ly way to start," she said.

This is the third in a four-part series
exploring crisis response and mental
health resources on campus.

Roughly 3,000 undergraduate
and graduate students utilize Coun
seling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) or receive off-campus treat
ment each year, according to CAPS
director Ron Albucher. CAPS has
experienced growth in student use
consistently over the last five years.
Student experiences both
positive and negative shed light
on the organization. Satisfaction
with CAPS services differs widely
among students.

The Daily examined the re
sources offered by CAPS and The
Bridge Peer Counseling Center and
undertook an informal survey of stu
dent experience.

Increased usage
Both CAPS and The Bridge Peer
Counseling Center have experi
enced increases in student usage in
recent years. Both organizations cite
relationship issues, depression and
stress as the primary factors that
bring students in.

Albucher, who said CAPS sees

about 2,200 unique students per
year, or 14 percent of the campus
population, said that an additional
six to seven percent of campus seeks
treatment outside of CAPS, accord
ing to self-reported data.

CAPS has seen an influx of fund
ing and personnel since Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Greg Boardman
initiated a Mental Health and Well
Being task force in 2008, following a
string of student suicides. Since 2008,
CAPS has hired the equivalent of
nine full time employees who are
psychotherapists, psychologists and
case managers rounding out a
workforce of roughly 40 people.
In that time, Albucher said, the
University has gone from having less
than the recommended ratio of one
counselor per 1,500 students to hav
ing about twice the recommended
number of specialists.

As CAPS reports a steady in
crease in the number of students uti
lizing its services, The Bridge Peer
Counseling Center says it has also
experienced an increase in traffic.
The Bridge which offers 24/7
counseling by phone has roughly
30 staff counselors and four live-in
counselors at Rogers House, which is
open for drop-in counsels from 9
a.m. to midnight. Between 30 and
40 students take The Bridge's two
required training classes each
quarter.
A student Bridge counselor
said this size is feasible given
space and personnel constraints,
but added, "it would be nice to
scale that up a little bit."
Albucher said the same about
CAPS resources, commenting
that "we could always use more."
"Each year has always been
busier than the last, going back
the last five years," Albucher said,
commenting that this year's data
will not be analyzed until the end
of spring quarter. "I would expect
overall that this academic year,
we'll still see this kind of an in
crease."
This quarter. The Bridge has
experienced a spike in calls, possi
bly caused by two recent student
deaths.
"We are getting a spike of calls
related to mental health and ill
ness and the loss of Cady and
Sam," said Bridge counselor Ak
shay Gopalan 'l2 to The Daily in
April.
CAPS has seen a similar trend,
Albucher said.
But Gopalan, who currently
teaches the Bridge training class
es and has served as a financial co
ordinator for the group, said that
the majority of calls are related to
relationships issues romantic,
social and familial followed by
academic issues general stress
and anxiety about pending proba
tions or suspensions.
Depression-related counsels
ranked third in 2011 data on the
Center's work.
CAPS reported more counsels
related to mental health than The
Bridge, and Albucher said that
the factors that cause students to
utilize CAPS have remained con
stant over the years.
"The number one issue that
brings people in are relationship
issues," Albucher said. "Two and
three are depression and anxiety
symptoms."
Albucher said that generally,
students are reporting less stigma
about mental health care.
Short and mid-term solutions
The Bridge and CAPS each
offer, respectively, short- and
mid-term counseling to students,
with each serving as a transition
to care for students who need
psychiatric treatment in longer in
crements.
The Bridge is meant to serve as
a one-time, short-term resource
for student counseling. The
Bridge's general counseling style,
Gopalan said, is driven by the
counselee and not the counselor.
"We [have] students talk
through everything they're going
through and systematically break
down complex thoughts and emo
tions into manageable steps, [and]
create an action plan that is feasi

ble and short-term," Gopalan
said, saying that many students
like talking to peers to resolve is
sues.
Bridge calls tend to last one to
two hours, Gopalan said.
Alejandro Martinez, a senior
associate director at CAPS, a pri
mary advisor to The Bridge and
an instructor of its training cours
es, said The Bridge is a great first
resource for mental health.
"If a person has a place to call,
that is the most critical step in get
ting help," Martinez said. "And
that is something The Bridge does
exceedingly well."
Kai-Yuan Neo 'l4 said he went
to The Bridge and CAPS each for
the first time last month and de
scribed positive experiences.
"I highly recommend both,"
Neo said, commenting that access
to The Bridge was convenient be
cause it was open late and didn't
feel as serious as talking to a pro
fessional counselor.
While The Bridge is meant for
one-time counseling, CAPS
which has both psychologists and
psychiatrists, who can prescribe
medication offers more regu
lar meetings.
CAPS used to offer students
10 free counseling sessions per
year, but shifted to a less rigid
model four years ago, Albucher
said. There is no longer a fixed
number of available sessions, but
CAPS prefers to perform short
term counseling in the interest of
seeing more students.
There is no fixed number for
the amount of sessions available
to students, and counselors make
a determination based on the stu
dent's progress and counselor
caseloads.
"For some [students] it might
be 5 to 6 [sessions] for others it
may be 12," Albucher said.
Neo, who said he had been ex
periencing feelings of loneliness
and a lack of excitement since
winter quarter, said he had not
considered either resource before
last month because he perceived
he did not need psychological
help.
Now, he said, he recognizes
something does not need to be
"wrong with him" to utilize CAPS
and has schedule a follow-up
meeting.
"Everybody has small prob
lems it's nice to talk about
them, to make sure everything is
on the right track," Neo said.
Scheduling an appointment
"One of our key priorities is
talking to students the same day
they contact us," Albucher said,
referring to the triage system, in
which students schedule a 5 to 10
minute call with a clinician to as
sess his or her counseling needs.
At the end of this triage call, stu
dents schedule initial sessions
with counselors.
The average wait time be
tween triage and initial meeting is
five days, Albucher said.
Most students who spoke to
The Daily said they have had to
wait a week before seeing CAPS.
Multiple students said they have

experienced waits of longer than
a week, commenting that even a
week can be too long for a student
with a non-crisis health concern.
Jen Wylie 'l3, a resident assis
tant (RA) in Suites, where sopho
more Sam Wopat lived and at
tempted suicide in March, said
that even though she wishes to see
a counselor, the CAPS schedule
does not work with hers. Wylie is a
member of the diving team.
"After Sam's funeral I was re
ally sad," Wylie said. "I tried to
make an appointment with a
CAPS counselor, but my schedule
was so busy. Anytime they can
meet, I can't meet. Anytime I can
meet, they can't meet. It hasn't
happened yet. I feel like it's a lot
of emails back and forth."
Albucher said CAPS some
times receives complaints about
wait time and that he would per
sonally follow up with students
who report grievances.
"We've had complaints about
people not being able to get in a
timely way," Albucher said. "I
take those seriously and want to
hear about those from students."
Switching counselors
A student may not find a good
match with his or her initial coun
selor. While some might stick with
a partnership and others might
decide to stop going to CAPS al
together, one RA spoke of a time
when his own RA helped him
switch counselors.
"When I felt that my CAPS
counselor was a little too stoic
and didn't seem to understand
me, my RA checked in," Charl
ton Soesanto 'll, a co-term stu
dent, wrote in an email to other
RAs as part of a thread on "what
to do about suicide/death" after
The Daily began this series.
"When he found out CAPS was
n't going too well, he sat next to
me, called the director of CAPS
for me, and told him that I need
ed someone new. Now. The next
day I got an appointment with a
new counselor."
Soesanto emphasized that his
new counselor was 'fantastic' in a
follow-up email to The Daily.
Another RA, who identified as
a varsity athlete who dealt with
major depression, said she was
dissatisfied with the services of
both CAPS and The Bridge.
"My experience with CAPs
has not been the best," she wrote.
"Both in times of crisis and in
times of simple distress, it has
taken up to a month for me to
have a session where I get to seri
ously address issues with a trained
counselor. At the Bridge I do not
feel that students who wish to talk
to a trained counselor can really
get what they need."
Addressing sexual assault
A female sophomore reported
waiting two weeks to be seen after
a sexual assault on campus in
2011.
"I called triage on February 8
and the first available appoint
ment they had was February 21,"
she said, adding that she had de
scribed symptoms of depression,

said she had been assaulted, and
reported not being at risk to harm
herself. "They said that I could
come in for an on-call clinician."
The student said she canceled
her relationship with CAPS after
two counseling sessions because
of the tone she perceived when
discussing strategies for avoiding
a future attack.
"Within two appointments, it
was recommended that I take
Prozac and that —in order to
avoid being assaulted in the fu
ture I reevaluate my clothing
choices," she said.
The student said she could not
sleep for four days after being
blamed for her attack and spent
the following month ridden to her
bed.
"It confirmed my fears that
what I was experiencing was my
own fault," she said.
"The whole goal of sexual as
sault counseling would be to not
make the student feel like they
are to blame for any of it," Al
bucher said, commenting that he
could only speak generally and
not to any specific case.
Albucher expressed that such
an incident was concerning.
"I would hope that the student
can come and set up a time to
meet with me and I'd be happy to
figure out what went wrong, what
was said, and take steps to if
there was a problem on our end
to fix that," he said.
"I certainly don't want anyone
in any way, shape or form
getting that message."
Despite her experience, the
sophomore said she would still
recommend CAPS to people
dealing with most mental health
issues.
"I would recommend CAPS to
friends, because I'm sure my ex
perience isn't a universal one,"
she said, though she added that
given her experience she would
not recommend CAPS to a stu
dent who is a victim of sexual as
sault.
"I wouldn't feel comfortable
recommending CAPS if that ex
perience had even been a possi
bility."
The University opened the Of
fice for Sexual Assault and Rela
tionship Abuse (SARA) Educa
tion and Response last June to
serve as an additional resource
for students.
Addressing serious depression
Two students with serious
mental health issues reached out to
The Daily following the first article
in this series. Both students, who
said they had not discussed their
experiences with many others on
campus, agreed to speak with The
Daily under the condition of com
plete anonymity.
Student X is an undergraduate
who has an anxiety disorder and
major depression. Student X has
taken multiple leaves of absence
and is currently home seeking
long-term treatment.
Student Y is a junior with a fam
ily history of depression and has
battled the illness since early child
hood.

Student X said she appreciated
resources from The Bridge, but
that it could not meet her needs.
"I used The Bridge a few times,
but 1 feel like the severity of my de
pression was a little bit too much
for a peer counselor to handle,"
student X said. "I thought it was
nice that that resource was there."
She expressed similar senti
ments about CAPS.
"I really appreciated the fact
that there were 10 free sessions per
quarter," student X said. "My
qualm was that I didn't really feel
connected with my personal coun
selor."
"My counselor gave me general
tips — deep breathing, writing
down worries," she said. "I wish
he'd listened more and taken me a
little more seriously in terms of my
concerns, worries, fears."
Student X said she didn't know
that it was an option to switch
counselors.
While neither resource worked
for her, she said she was "very
grateful" to Stanford for connect
ing her to treatment at home.
Student Y said no one at CAPS
communicated that seeing a regu
lar psychiatrist at Stanford Hospi
tal was a viable option, even
though she began seeing a special
ist there following a suicide at
tempt.
"I brought it up earlier with
someone at CAPS," she said. "They
said there was no insurance — it
would be so much more expensive.
It really discouraged me."
Student Y said "it was not the
case" that going to Stanford Hospi
tal was not expensive.
Off campus referrals
If a therapist, when coming up
with an assessment for students,
thinks the student's difficulty can
not be handled short term, CAPS
will recommend students to seek
longer-term treatment in an outpa
tient center, Albucher said.
Albucher said that Stanford will
partner with a new mental health
insurance benefits company in the
2012-13 academic year that will
help students in Cardinal Care find
good providers in the local com
munity.
"If they don't want to come to
CAPS that's fine, we'll help them
get healthcare elsewhere," Albuch
er said.
Sarah Quartey '14 said she also
left CAPS after a few sessions, but
because she thought long-term
care would be more beneficial.
"I came to campus with a lot of
mental health issues — definitely
depressed, showing signs of OCD,
anxiety disorder and other things,"
Quartey said.
Quartey said that she went to
CAPS for a while, but now sees an
off-campus counselor every week.
She said that Stanford's Office of
Financial Aid was able to cover
her co-pay for the off-site services
and that CAPS led her to that re
source.
"CAPS was a really user-friend
ly way to start," she said.
