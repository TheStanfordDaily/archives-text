## Admins, students speak about CAPS, Bridge Peer Counseling Center 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
This is the third in a four-part series
exploring crisis response and mental
health resources on campus.

Roughly 3,000 undergraduate
and graduate students utilize Coun
seling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) or receive off-campus treat
ment each year, according to CAPS
director Ron Albucher. CAPS has
experienced growth in student use
consistently over the last five years.
Student experiences both
positive and negative shed light
on the organization. Satisfaction
with CAPS services differs widely

The Daily examined the re

Bridge Peer Counseling Center and

year, or 14 percent of the campus
population, said that an additional
six to seven percent of campus seeks
treatment outside of CAPS, accord

CAPS has seen an influx of fund

for Student Affairs Greg Boardman

string of student suicides. Since 2008,
CAPS has hired the equivalent of
nine full time employees who are
psychotherapists, psychologists and
case managers rounding out a
workforce of roughly 40 people.
In that time, Albucher said, the
University has gone from having less
than the recommended ratio of one
counselor per 1,500 students to hav
ing about twice the recommended
number of specialists.

As CAPS reports a steady in
crease in the number of students uti
lizing its services, The Bridge Peer
Counseling Center says it has also
experienced an increase in traffic.
The Bridge which offers 24/7
counseling by phone has roughly
30 staff counselors and four live-in
counselors at Rogers House, which is
open for drop-in counsels from 9
