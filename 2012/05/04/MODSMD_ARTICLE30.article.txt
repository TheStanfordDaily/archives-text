## ROXY SASS EXOTIC EROTIC: ROXY ON RAISING THE FLAG (POLE) 
### 
Although Roxy is hardly a
traditional girl, there's
one Stanford tradition
with a special place in her heart
or, more accurately, her
libido.
Exotic Erotic, the legendary
event hosted by 680 Lomita,
encourages girls to wear two
articles of clothing and guys to
wear just one. Featuring a patri
otic theme this year, Exotic's got
Roxy excited to raise some flag
poles. And in the spirit of pursu
ing happiness, Roxy's got some
tips to keep your night erotic
without the "ick."
Flashy but not trashy
Like the star spangled ban
ner, certain sights are best saved
for "dawn's early light," rather
than the 680 dance floor. While
Roxy fully supports freedom of
expression, especially when that
expression involves partial nudity,
sometimes it's better to leave
something to the imagination.
And remember, clothing is like
alcohol know your limits.
Find away to enjoy the long
... lines
While extra length is rarely a
bad thing, the wait to get into the
party can reach extremes that
even Roxy can't handle. Roxy
suggests putting that time to
good use scope out prospects
or hit on the security guards
(nothing like a man or
woman in uniform). And if
the night gets too cold, find a
cutie and get real close (with per
mission) ... for body heat, of
course.

Don't do it on the dance
floor
With so much half-naked
grinding in a crowded, sweaty
space, some (westward) expan
sion is bound to happen. But if
you feel the urge to plant your
flag in somebody's Plymouth
rock, Roxy encourages you to
migrate into new territory...
outdoors. Though there's nothing
wrong with the occasional public
make-out in the 680 lounge,
hooking up in said lounge in the
midst of sweaty, scantily clad
freshmen verges on orgy status.
For those of you who'd rather
channel your Roman inclinations
into great costumes for SAE's
toga party, moving outside pro
vides marginally more sanitary
conditions and the chance to
check interesting hookup locales
off your bucket list (hello, Scary
Path).
Embrace the heckling
At its core, Exotic is about
exhibitionism. And what's the
point of putting on a show with
out an audience? The fact that the
audience consists mostly of frat
boys on couches just means that
this weekend is no different than
any other. For those unwilling to
shed their clothes (or their digni
ty), participating in the pre-Exotic
heckling, or at least taking in the
sights, can be a fun alternative.
Also looking to check Scary
Path off your bucket list? Roxy is
frighteningly good. Arrange a ren
