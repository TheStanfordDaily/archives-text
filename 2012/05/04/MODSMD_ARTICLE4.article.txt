## Compound aids stroke recovery School of Medicine researchers say treatment could be first of its kind 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers at the Stanford School
of Medicine have identified a new mo
lecular compound that could revolu
tionize the treatment of strokes in hu
mans, for the first time offering the abil
ity to enhance recovery after a stroke
has taken place.

Stroke-afflicted mice treated with a
molecule called LM22A-4, which helps
to stimulate the growth of new neurons,
exhibited accelerated and more exten
sive recovery.

Current stroke-treatment practices
focus on limiting initial damage to the
brain by breaking up the clots that
caused the stroke.

"Since there are about 800,000
strokes each year in the United States
and stroke is a leading cause of serious
long-term disability, any treatment that
improves recovery from stroke would
significantly help a large number of
people," wrote Marion Buckwalter,
professor of neurology and the paper's
senior author, in an email to The Daily.

Buckwalter and her team tested the
compound's effects by first training a
group of mice to perform basic physical
tasks, such as walking across a horizon
tal ladder. After surgically inducing
strokes and testing the mice's speed
and agility, researchers treated the
equally impaired groups with a placebo
or the drug starting three days after the
stroke.

"We followed their recovery using
tests of gait and speed and found that
the drug improved both limb-swing
speed (the speed at which they moved
the limb weakened by the stroke) and
gait accuracy," Buckwalter wrote,
Buckwalter emphasized the break
through's significance, noting that the
compound could have an equivalent ef
fect on human subjects.
