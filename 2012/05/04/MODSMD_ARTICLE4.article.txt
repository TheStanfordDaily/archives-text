## Compound aids stroke recovery School of Medicine researchers say treatment could be first of its kind 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers at the Stanford School
of Medicine have identified a new mo
lecular compound that could revolu
tionize the treatment of strokes in hu
mans, for the first time offering the abil
ity to enhance recovery after a stroke
has taken place.

Stroke-afflicted mice treated with a
molecule called LM22A-4, which helps
to stimulate the growth of new neurons,
exhibited accelerated and more exten
sive recovery.

Current stroke-treatment practices
focus on limiting initial damage to the
brain by breaking up the clots that
caused the stroke.

"Since there are about 800,000
strokes each year in the United States
and stroke is a leading cause of serious
long-term disability, any treatment that
improves recovery from stroke would
significantly help a large number of
people," wrote Marion Buckwalter,
professor of neurology and the paper's
senior author, in an email to The Daily.

Buckwalter and her team tested the
compound's effects by first training a
group of mice to perform basic physical
tasks, such as walking across a horizon
tal ladder. After surgically inducing
strokes and testing the mice's speed
and agility, researchers treated the
equally impaired groups with a placebo
or the drug starting three days after the
stroke.

"We followed their recovery using
tests of gait and speed and found that
the drug improved both limb-swing
speed (the speed at which they moved
the limb weakened by the stroke) and
gait accuracy," Buckwalter wrote,
Buckwalter emphasized the break
through's significance, noting that the
compound could have an equivalent ef
fect on human subjects.

LM22A-4 mimics a protein called
brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BNDF), which binds with a neural
receptor called Trkß to stimulate
neuron growth in both humans and
mice. Mice treated with LM22A-4
produced twice the number of new
nerve cells in stroke-affected areas
of the brain compared to mice
given the placebo and were able to
regain pre-stroke limb-swing
speed.
"It was the hoped-for discovery

since the drug binds a receptor that
is very important for plasticity
[adaptability] in neural pathways
and very significant because there
is currently no drug that we can
give to people that works by pro
moting recovery," Buckwalter
wrote.

In addition to accelerating and
enhancing recovery, the treatment
also had no detrimental effects on
the subject mice, such as inflamma
tion or scar tissue.
Buckwalter noted that the com
pound's benefits may be applicable
to human stroke victims in the fu
ture, offering a substantial leap for
ward in stroke treatment. She pre

dicted, however, that a time frame
of "many years" would be needed
before any such drug is approved
and available to the general public.

Buckwalter described the cur
rent study as "just the first step."
"The next steps are to find the
optimal dosing and time window in
which to treat mice and to test for
drug toxicity in mice," Buckwalter
wrote, adding that due to the
disparity in size between a human
and a mouse brain further fine
tuning of the molecule itself may
be required.
