## Love key to change, says Williamson Bestselling author says spirituality and empathy at the heart of social movements 
### FEDERICO BECKER 
Speaking to a predominantly female audi
ence Thursday night at Cemex Auditorium,
best-selling author Marianne Williamson pro
posed that the only way society can change its
course from inevitable doom is to employ love
as an agent of social transformation.

Williamson, a founder of The Peace Al
liance, a grass-roots organization that led a
campaign for the U.S. Congress to establish a
Department of Peace, directly addressed the
common rejection of spiritual values in modern
society by offering a historically grounded ar
gument revolving around figures such as Mar
tin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi.
"Many may say that this love stuff is naive,"
Williamson said. "What I'm here to propose to
you tonight is that anybody who thinks that any
kind of traditional political and social activism
at this point in our history, devoid of a spiritual
love component, is enough to turn this titanic
around they're naive."

Williamson urged humanity to follow the
examples of spiritual figures such as Buddha,
Moses and Jesus. She said that all people must
perceive the ongoing human suffering in our
world today and use love to act upon it.

"We talk about success all the time how
to have success and how to make money, how to
address all the economic issues of our planet

meanwhile we have one billion people who live
on a quarter or less a day," she said. "We have
17,000 children who die of hunger everyday in
this planet. Take a moment and let that pene
trate your heart. The obscenity of it, the im
morality of it, the absurdity."
Addressing the primary demographic of the
audience, Williamson asked women of America
to "eradicate unnecessary suffering from the
planet by acting as mothers to their children."
"We must empower the women and educate
the children," she said.

Williamson added that modern-day politics
is missing the point, arguing that to change the
world, we must instead realize that "in each of
our lives we go through an Armageddon the
sadness, the divorce, the loss of someone
