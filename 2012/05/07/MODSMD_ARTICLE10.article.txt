## PROFILE DAVID STRAUB DIPLOMACY AND DISSIDENTS Korea expert shares experience, views on U.S.-Korea relations 
### STEPHEN COBBE 
For a farm boy from southeast Ken
tucky, the odds of dining with Bill
Clinton are about as good as the
chances of feasting with Kim Jong
11. But in the summer 0f2009, David
Straub, director of the Korean Studies Pro
gram at the Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pa
cific Research Center (APARC), did both as
part of a small delegation sent to secure the
release of two American journalists, Laura
Ling and Euna Lee, who were held in North
Korea for allegedly entering the country ille
gally.
"I wish I could say that I played a major
role in the incident, but the very capable peo
ple in the U.S. government worked it out in
an astute way and we were on the ground for
less than 24 hours," Straub said.
Straub, who had previously visited North
Korea four times, was chosen for the mission
because of his extensive knowledge of Kore
an culture and politics.
"Basically, I was there as a resource per
son. I could understand the Korean that the
North Koreans were speaking so I could cor
rect the interpretations," Straub said. "I was
able to reassure our people that what the
North Koreans were proposing was not a
problem."
Straub also recalled giving the two jour
nalists some gastronomical advice following
their release no doubt feeling like an ex
pert on the subject following his fine dining
with high dignitaries.
"On the way back to the United States ..
. I advised the two women not to eat much of
the greasy American food we had out on the
table," he said with a laugh. "They had been
eating Korean food for many months, and if
you suddenly change your diet like that, you
can easily get sick."
Straub brings both gastronomical and pro
fessional experience to his current position at
Stanford's Korean studies program, where he
has worked since 2008. Thirty years of experi
ence in the U.S. Foreign Service provide him
with a unique perspective on academia.
"One thing that is special about APARC is
that you have people like David [Straub]
who come not from a purely academic back
ground, but who are comfortable in an aca
demic setting and who can bring the knowl
edge that they have gained in other places in
their lives to the University," said Daniel
Sneider, associate director for research at
APARC.

Growing up in southeastern Kentucky,
Straub had few opportunities to travel but al
ways longed to visit other countries. After
graduating from the University of Louisville
and attending graduate school at Harvard for
a year, Straub left to join the Foreign Service
and was assigned to work in Germany for two
years. Building on his years of classroom Ger
man, Straub became fluent in the language by
the end of his stay in the country.
"At that point, I was feeling pretty cocky
and I thought that now that I'd learned a Eu
ropean language, I ought to tackle a really
hard language," he said.
In 1979, Straub was assigned a position in
South Korea. Because speaking Korean was
essential for his new role in the U.S. embassy,
Straub attended a language school in Wash
ington and later a top university in Seoul to
master the difficult language.
Straub's work in South Korea involved
maintaining lines of communication with dis
sidents, student movements and Christian
organizations involved in human rights and
democratization efforts after the 1979 mili
tary coup. He regularly met with top opposi
tion members and leaders during this "inter
esting and difficult time for South Korea."
These everyday interactions with broad
segments of Korean society would later serve
Straub well in the classroom.
"Because of his almost perfect command
of the Korean language, his extensive knowl
edge of Korean culture and especially his lin
guistic abilities, I felt a familiarity and a sense
of intimacy with him," said Youna Oh, a for
mer student of Straub's who is studying at
Stanford as part of her overseas training for
diplomacy in South Korea.
Straub recalled that following the 1979
military takeover many Koreans blamed the
United States for not doing enough to pre
vent the coup and supporting dictator Gen
eral Chun Doo-hwan.
He remembered that as a 28-year-old, it
was frustrating to be one of the only people
in contact with the opposition leaders. Ac
cording to Straub, the U.S. ambassador rarely
met with leaders of dissident groups, some of
whom went on to lead the country following
its return to democracy in 1987. This was in
line with President Reagan's policy, which
emphasized communism and not totalitari
anism as the real threat to peace,
"Traditionally, it has been a tenet of
American foreign policy that people of our
embassies should stay in contact with all le
gitimate members of society," Straub said,

expressing his disapproval of the strategy.
Straub would again experience the frus
tration of diplomatic intransigence during
the Six-Party Talks on North Korean's nu
clear program from 2002 to 2004. Responsi
ble for assembling the diplomatic briefing
books for the negotiators, Straub remem
bered that the event was large and quasi
public, so carrying out successful negotia
tions was difficult. The first Bush administra
tion was also determined not to have side ne
gotiations with the North Koreans, which
minimized the space for compromise.
"The world is a complex place. You can't
just take these rigid positions and be black
and white all of the time," Straub said, adding
that the Bush administration would engage
in more bilateral talks during its second term.
Now, as a teacher, Straub is able to foster
dialogue and understanding among his stu
dents.
"We have students in our classes from
China, Japan and South Korea among other
places," Straub said. "I think it's great that fu
ture leaders like these can study this early in
their career with people who have worked in
the U.S. government and who are speaking to
them frankly. I think it will make them more
capable officials and on the whole will help
improve U.S. relations abroad."
Gea Kang 'll said she believes many of
the discussion and communication skills she
gained from Straub's tutelage help with the
work she does in governance through a fel
lowship from the Haas Center for Public
Service.
"I think it is difficult for any instructor to
strike a balance between remaining substan
tive and fostering discussion, but Straub did a
very good job navigating that effectively and
patiently," Kang said.
After his time in South Korea, Straub was
stationed with the Foreign Service in various
locations around the world. In Washington,
he spent time writing guidance packets for
press officers who often faced difficult ques
tions about the Korean dictatorship's alleged
atrocities and use of torture.
When he assumed a position at the U.S.
embassy in Japan, Straub found himself in a
culturally fascinating environment, yet
missed working in South Korea's less mature
political scene. After several years, Straub re
turned to Korea, where he worked on and
off, accumulating almost 12 years of experi
ence in the nation by the end of his diplomat
ic career.
By the time he shifted to academia in

2006, teaching initially at Johns Hopkins
University before coming to Stanford,
Straub was ready for a change.
"When you're in government, you spend
all day long going from meeting to meeting,
dealing with the crisis du jour, and you spend
a tremendous amount of time coordinating,"
Straub said. "While it's very interesting, it's
exhausting after a while and doesn't allow
you to focus deeply on one thing."
At Stanford, Straub has been focused on
researching topics related to North Korea. In
April, he moderated an event at Stanford
featuring two North Korean defectors who
recounted harrowing stories of hardship in
their country.
Straub found the event moving.
"In substance, I had heard similar stories,
but when you hear it directly especially
from two young people that's very power
ful," he said.
Straub sees an important message in such
events. He believes that Americans do not
focus enough attention on the humanitarian
issues in North Korea, although he acknowl
edges that this is in part due to the lack of free
press. However, he also believes that Ameri
can society as a whole is not well versed
enough in international affairs.
It is unlikely that Straub's students will be
caught unprepared by an international inci
dent. In a class he co-teaches with his col
leagues on U.S. policy in Northeast Asia, stu
dents are asked to produce memorandums
that detail an appropriate response to a hypo
thetical crisis. The idea is for students to pre
tend they are National Security Council per
sonnel and draft the paper accordingly.
"Even after working 30 years in govern
ment, that's not an easy thing to do," Straub
said.
