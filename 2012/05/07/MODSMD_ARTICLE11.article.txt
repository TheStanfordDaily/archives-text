## EDITORIAL Housing Draw needs improvement 
### 
A few hours before this
paper goes to press, the ap
plication period for Stan
ford's arcane housing selection
process the "Draw" came to
a close. Compared to peer institu
tions, Stanford is in the relatively
unique position of guaranteeing
on-campus housing for a full four
years and still offers a remarkably
heterogeneous portfolio of resi
dential options: Stanford Student
Housing comprises 78 residences,
including traditional co-ed dorms,
independent houses, suites, and
apartments. Of these 78 resi
dences, there are four academic
theme houses, four focus houses,
four ethnic theme houses, four lan
guage and culture houses, 10
Greek houses, and seven co-ops.
For comparison, upperclassmen at
schools like Harvard or Yale are
essentially assigned to one of
twelve houses, with little opportu
nity to explore housing options.
Stanford's Residential and Din
ing Enterprises deserves praise for
recent work on improving the un
dergraduate housing experience.
As enrollment increased during
the 19905, Student Housing was un
able to keep up with the demand
for beds, and many residences were
"stuffed": triples were converted to
quads, doubles to triples, and sin
gles to doubles there are likely
some on campus who remember
the infamous "mini-doubles" in the
Lagunita complex. The last three or
four years has seen a welcome re
versal of this trend. The completion
of the Munger complex allowed
Crothers to become an undergrad
uate residence, which then allowed
Housing to un-stuff residences,
most notably in Toyon and Bran
ner. With a rough back-of-the-en
velope calculation using data from
the Housing website, the Editorial
Board estimates that a rather large
60 percent of upperclassmen now
live in either a single, a two-room
double, or another similarly private
space, which is a commendable ac
complishment. Calculated sepa
rately, a third of Stanford upper
classmen live on the Row or other
independent houses. Clearly we
have a plethora of attractive hous
ing options.
As 98 percent of students opt to
live in Stanford housing for four
years, a system as complex as the
Draw is perhaps necessary to sup
port Stanford's housing system.
However, we believe that the sys
tem is still lacking in transparency

and that small but meaningful re
forms could improve the experience
for students. For instance, releasing
more details on how the auxiliary
factors that impact the outcome of
the Draw like gender, ethnicity,
priority status, and the proportion of
pre-assigning students in the house
function would be a welcome
move for many.
But most importantly, we find
problematic Student Housing's
policy of publishing detailed Draw
cutoff numbers after the Draw re
sults are announced yet deliber
ately taking this information off of
its website during the summer.
Housing rightfully argues that stu
dents fare better in the Draw if
they create a robust list of every
residence of interest and that
Draw cutoffs can vary tremen
dously between years. Yet Housing
then wrongfully concludes that
providing cutoff numbers befud
dles our judgment and causes us to
produce poor options lists. We be
lieve that this is an inappropriate
stance to take, particularly because
withholding basic information in
hibits students from making in
formed decisions about topics like
Draw group size or the choice to
live off-campus. Withholding cut
off data also encourages students
to seek out information from up
perclassmen; often, this informa
tion is misleading if not downright
incorrect, thereby further confus
ing students.
In an email sent to all students
this past Friday, Housing accused
The Stanford Daily's "A Guide to
the Housing Draw," published Fri
day, as propagating incomplete
and thus misleading information.
The administrators then affirmed
their stance of taking down cutoff
data over the summer. Yet the eas
iest solution to ensure that stu
dents receive the complete infor
mation is to simply maintain the
cutoff data on the Housing web
site. In short, Housing's insistence
on taking down the data not only
leads to students making less in
formed decisions with rankings
lists, but is demeaning to the intel
ligence of Stanford students.
Overall, the Editorial board is
pleased with the campus housing
situation at Stanford, though we
believe that increased transparen
cy could improve the system even
more for future years. We hope
Housing takes these points into
consideration when crafting poli
cies for coming years.

nity to explore housing options.
Stanford's Residential and Din
ing Enterprises deserves praise for
recent work on improving the un
dergraduate housing experience.
As enrollment increased during
the 19905, Student Housing was un
able to keep up with the demand
for beds, and many residences were
"stuffed": triples were converted to
quads, doubles to triples, and sin
gles to doubles there are likely
some on campus who remember
the infamous "mini-doubles" in the
Lagunita complex. The last three or
four years has seen a welcome re
versal of this trend. The completion
of the Munger complex allowed
Crothers to become an undergrad
uate residence, which then allowed
Housing to un-stuff residences,
most notably in Toyon and Bran
ner. With a rough back-of-the-en
velope calculation using data from
the Housing website, the Editorial
Board estimates that a rather large
60 percent of upperclassmen now
live in either a single, a two-room
double, or another similarly private
space, which is a commendable ac
complishment. Calculated sepa
rately, a third of Stanford upper
classmen live on the Row or other
independent houses. Clearly we
have a plethora of attractive hous
ing options.
As 98 percent of students opt to
live in Stanford housing for four
years, a system as complex as the
Draw is perhaps necessary to sup
port Stanford's housing system.
However, we believe that the sys
tem is still lacking in transparency

and that small but meaningful re
forms could improve the experience
for students. For instance, releasing
more details on how the auxiliary
factors that impact the outcome of
the Draw like gender, ethnicity,
priority status, and the proportion of
pre-assigning students in the house
function would be a welcome
move for many.
But most importantly, we find
problematic Student Housing's
policy of publishing detailed Draw
cutoff numbers after the Draw re
sults are announced yet deliber
ately taking this information off of
its website during the summer.
Housing rightfully argues that stu
dents fare better in the Draw if
they create a robust list of every
residence of interest and that
Draw cutoffs can vary tremen
dously between years. Yet Housing
then wrongfully concludes that
providing cutoff numbers befud
dles our judgment and causes us to
produce poor options lists. We be
lieve that this is an inappropriate
stance to take, particularly because
withholding basic information in
hibits students from making in
formed decisions about topics like
Draw group size or the choice to
live off-campus. Withholding cut
off data also encourages students
to seek out information from up
perclassmen; often, this informa
tion is misleading if not downright
incorrect, thereby further confus
ing students.
In an email sent to all students
this past Friday, Housing accused
The Stanford Daily's "A Guide to
the Housing Draw," published Fri
day, as propagating incomplete
and thus misleading information.
The administrators then affirmed
their stance of taking down cutoff
data over the summer. Yet the eas
iest solution to ensure that stu
dents receive the complete infor
mation is to simply maintain the
cutoff data on the Housing web
site. In short, Housing's insistence
on taking down the data not only
leads to students making less in
formed decisions with rankings
lists, but is demeaning to the intel
ligence of Stanford students.
Overall, the Editorial board is
pleased with the campus housing
situation at Stanford, though we
believe that increased transparen
cy could improve the system even
more for future years. We hope
Housing takes these points into
consideration when crafting poli
cies for coming years.

A few hours before this
paper goes to press, the ap
plication period for Stan
ford's arcane housing selection
process the "Draw" came to
a close. Compared to peer institu
tions, Stanford is in the relatively
unique position of guaranteeing
on-campus housing for a full four
years and still offers a remarkably
heterogeneous portfolio of resi
dential options: Stanford Student
Housing comprises 78 residences,
including traditional co-ed dorms,
independent houses, suites, and
apartments. Of these 78 resi
dences, there are four academic
theme houses, four focus houses,
four ethnic theme houses, four lan
guage and culture houses, 10
Greek houses, and seven co-ops.
For comparison, upperclassmen at
schools like Harvard or Yale are
essentially assigned to one of
twelve houses, with little opportu
nity to explore housing options.
