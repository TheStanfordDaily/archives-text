# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## What conservatives get right about the family 
### Miles Unterreiner 
First of all, don't freak out. It's a
short article. My freshman
year, at our dorm Crossing the
Line event, there was one question
whose answer I still remember. Our
moderator asked us to cross the line
if our biological parents were di
vorced or separated. Fewer than a
quarter of students walked across
the room.
That response gave me pause
then and still does today. Divorce
rates in the United States for the
first marriage are generally estimat
ed to hover around 50 percent. Add
in the children born out of wedlock
to parents who never many in the
first place four out of 10 babies in
2007 and the statistics for Amer
ica as a whole become staggering.
So what does it say about mar
riage that, at least according to my
completely unscientific survey, the
world's most successful, driven,
bright kids measured by their ad
mittance to Stanford tend to
come from families where both par
ents are still married? Might stable
marriages lead to more successful
children? And if so, might the Right
be right about the importance of the
nuclear family and community in
fostering responsible, virtuous
young people?
My opinion is: sort of
There's no doubt that two-par
ent families confer a series of advan
tages on children. Most obvious
among them is time: time parents
spend reading with kids, time invest
ed taking them to and from produc
tive after-school sports and ex
tracurriculars, time enjoyed having
meaningful conversations over real,
healthy, home-made meals, time
spent obsessing over test scores and
grades in short, time not spent
leaving children in front of the tele
vision or video games munching on
a Big Mac while working an ex
hausting second job to pay the bills a
wife or husband might otherwise be
able to help pay. Raising a child suc
cessfully takes enormous amounts
of work, and two-parent families

have an advantage in splitting what
can be a formidable workload for
single moms and dads.
In his influential new book
"Coming Apart," libertarian
thinker Charles Murray argues con
vincingly that American social life is
increasingly becoming polarized
between two diametric demograph
ic opposites: an elite upper class that
tends to marry and stay married,
connects with the surrounding com
munity and has at least one college
degree, and a lower class that does
n't marry, never forms meaningful
social connections and rarely gradu
ates from high school, let alone col
lege.
These data mesh discouragingly
with the message of Robert D. Put
nam's thought-provoking "Bowling
Alone: The Collapse and Revival of
American Community," which ex
amines declining levels of participa
tion in civic networks among Amer
ican families since 1960. Putnam ar
gues powerfully that the average
American is less connected to her
fellow citizens, possesses shallower
social networks and is less involved
in her local community than ever
before.
In these respects, I think there's
actually something valuable to be
taken away from the generally ab
surd conservative outrage over
"Julia," Team Obama's recent digi
tal poster-child. As Ross Douthat
points out in the New York Times,
Julia "seems to have no meaningful
relationships apart from her bond
with the Obama White House: no
friends or siblings or extended fam
ily, no husband ('Julia decides to
have a child,' is all the slide show
says), a son who disappears once
school starts and parents who only
matter because Obamacare grants
her the privilege of staying on their
health care plan until she's 26."That
is a dark vision of the good life, in
deed.
So far, so good. Family and com
munity can have noticeable positive
effects. But here's where the Right

goes wrong.
By adopting cutthroat fiscal poli
cies that make it harder and harder
for working-class moms and dads to
find the time and money to spend
meaningful time with growing kids,
conservatives are themselves un
dermining the family values they
profess to promote.
By making it impossible for gays
and lesbians to marry, conservatives
are preventing the formation of sta
ble nuclear families that they (quite
rightly) aim to support.
By refusing to acknowledge the
lingering influence of racial discrim
ination in this country, conservatives
are missing the opportunity to tar
get family-friendly social and eco
nomic policies toward especially
high-risk minority communities,
where the two-parent families are
particularly rare.
By supporting wars overseas
and in this criticism I include Presi
dent Obama conservatives are
removing tens of thousands of fa
thers and mothers from the lives of
their children at some of the most
vital moments in their emotional
development moments stolen
from them by a helicopter flight in
Kabul or a firefight in Helmand.
Even worse, sometimes those ab
sences are permanent, tearing a
family apart forever.
So sure, let's encourage stable
marriages, happy families and com
munity morality. But let's do it hon
estly, and without the disingenuous
hypocrisy that mars too many con
versations about the family today.

If you have better data than a Cross
ing the Line event from three years
ago, Miles would love to see it. Email
