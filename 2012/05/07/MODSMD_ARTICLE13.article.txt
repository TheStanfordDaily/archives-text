# OP-ED
## Strengthening Palestine means supporting Israel 
### MARTY ZACK'14 Co-President, Stanford Israel Alliance 
In Friday's Daily, outgoing
ASSU President Michael Cruz
'l2 published an op-ed in sup
port of a petition advanced by a
group previously named "Stu
dents Confronting Apartheid by
Israel" (SCAI), now called "Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal
Rights" (SPER). SPER's â€”for
merly SCAI's petition advo
cates for "selective divestment"
from companies variously in
volved in Israeli activity east of Is
rael's pre-1967 border. Cruz's
title, "Why I support Israel, Pales
tine, and divestment," positions
him as supportive of all parties,
and in no way do I doubt
Michael's good intentions to aid
both peoples. However, Cruz has
fundamentally misunderstood
what "pro-Palestinian" and "pro-
Israeli" mean, which has been evi
denced in the days since his op-ed
was published by the elated disbe
lief of the SPER community on
the one hand "best ASSU pres
ident ever?" asked one vice presi
dent of SPER and the incredu
lous frustration of our community
on the other.
First and foremost, selective di
vestment is not pro-Israel because
if it succeeds, media reports will
never represent SPER's petition
as the carefully fine-tuned policy
position that it professes to be;
rather, the headlines will declare

that "STANFORD DIVESTS
FROM ISRAEL." Moreover, di
vestment is not pro-Israel because
it seeks to point the finger at and
punish only Israel for its per
ceived misdeeds, without examin
ing the record of the Palestinians
and their governing body, the
Palestinian Authority (PA). While
I can list many Israeli policies I
would like to see changed, Cruz in
his op-ed belies his avowal to
"promote all human rights" by
failing to consider what we might
demand of the Palestinians.
Should the PA recognize Israel's
right to exist as a Jewish state, as
they have failed to do? Should the
PA implement the institutions of a
real democracy, and the rights one
entails that are now regularly con
travened by the PA the free
doms of the press, of expression,
of religion? Most ironically, SPER
in its previous incarnation as
SCAI wrongly accused Israel of
somehow perpetrating apartheid,
but what of the clearer case of
Palestinian apartheid the offi
cial, abhorrent PA positions that a
future state in the West Bank must
be free of Jews, and its law that
selling property to Jews in the
West Bank is a capital offense?
In March, Cruz told me that he
believes "firmly" in "a strong state
