# OP-ED
## Strengthening Palestine means supporting Israel 
### MARTY ZACK'14 Co-President, Stanford Israel Alliance 
In Friday's Daily, outgoing
ASSU President Michael Cruz
'l2 published an op-ed in sup
port of a petition advanced by a
group previously named "Stu
dents Confronting Apartheid by
Israel" (SCAI), now called "Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal
Rights" (SPER). SPER's —for
merly SCAI's petition advo
cates for "selective divestment"
from companies variously in
volved in Israeli activity east of Is
rael's pre-1967 border. Cruz's
title, "Why I support Israel, Pales
tine, and divestment," positions
him as supportive of all parties,
and in no way do I doubt
Michael's good intentions to aid
both peoples. However, Cruz has
fundamentally misunderstood
what "pro-Palestinian" and "pro-
Israeli" mean, which has been evi
denced in the days since his op-ed
was published by the elated disbe
lief of the SPER community on
the one hand "best ASSU pres
ident ever?" asked one vice presi
dent of SPER and the incredu
lous frustration of our community
on the other.
First and foremost, selective di
vestment is not pro-Israel because
if it succeeds, media reports will
never represent SPER's petition
as the carefully fine-tuned policy
position that it professes to be;
rather, the headlines will declare

that "STANFORD DIVESTS
FROM ISRAEL." Moreover, di
vestment is not pro-Israel because
it seeks to point the finger at and
punish only Israel for its per
ceived misdeeds, without examin
ing the record of the Palestinians
and their governing body, the
Palestinian Authority (PA). While
I can list many Israeli policies I
would like to see changed, Cruz in
his op-ed belies his avowal to
"promote all human rights" by
failing to consider what we might
demand of the Palestinians.
Should the PA recognize Israel's
right to exist as a Jewish state, as
they have failed to do? Should the
PA implement the institutions of a
real democracy, and the rights one
entails that are now regularly con
travened by the PA the free
doms of the press, of expression,
of religion? Most ironically, SPER
in its previous incarnation as
SCAI wrongly accused Israel of
somehow perpetrating apartheid,
but what of the clearer case of
Palestinian apartheid the offi
cial, abhorrent PA positions that a
future state in the West Bank must
be free of Jews, and its law that
selling property to Jews in the
West Bank is a capital offense?
In March, Cruz told me that he
believes "firmly" in "a strong state
of Israel," but his proposal Friday
only weakens Israel while failing
to strengthen the PA. In fact, the
West Bank's greatest hope today
is not divestment but the drive to
build up its civil society, led by PA
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad,
and most strongly supported by
the United States, who con
tributed $6OO million to the PA in
2010, and Israel. Both countries
work daily with the PA to train its
security forces, and the PA has
begun to successfully assume re
sponsibility for arresting and dis
arming terrorist factions within
its own midst. As security cooper
ation has dramatically improved,
Israel has been able to work with
Fayyad to bolster the economic,
health, and educational situations
significantly in the West Bank.
With a safer, stronger, and more
prosperous PA, Israel is safer;
with peoples that work more
closely hand-in-hand, the greater
trust that results enables brighter
prospects for peace.
In striving towards peace, I be

lieve that we must not seek to cas
tigate, to demonize, to weaken the
other those we deem "at
fault," in Michael's words
while simultaneously shielding
ourselves from all criticism and
harm. Rather, we must look in
ward, identifying our own flaws
so that we can act more humane
ly and productively, while also
moving forward however we can
with our adversary who must
eventually be our partner —to
find opportunities for their ac
tions too to be more tolerant,
more constructive, and to create
room for hope. Today in White
Plaza, the Stanford Israel Al
liance celebrates the founding of
the Jewish state of Israel, 64 years
ago. We will not be celebrating Is
rael's policies or borders, but
rather its existence the visceral
manifestation of the Jewish right
to a national homeland. May we
one day soon be able to celebrate
too a Palestinian Day of Inde
pendence, one which from that
point forward will mark a peace
ful future of self-determination
and coexistence for all the peo
ples of the Holy Land.

With a safer, stronger, and more
prosperous PA, Israel is safer;
with peoples that work more
closely hand-in-hand, the greater
trust that results enables brighter
prospects for peace.
In striving towards peace, I be

lieve that we must not seek to cas
tigate, to demonize, to weaken the
other those we deem "at
fault," in Michael's words
while simultaneously shielding
ourselves from all criticism and
harm. Rather, we must look in
ward, identifying our own flaws
so that we can act more humane
ly and productively, while also
moving forward however we can
with our adversary who must
eventually be our partner —to
find opportunities for their ac
tions too to be more tolerant,
more constructive, and to create
room for hope. Today in White
Plaza, the Stanford Israel Al
liance celebrates the founding of
the Jewish state of Israel, 64 years
ago. We will not be celebrating Is
rael's policies or borders, but
rather its existence the visceral
manifestation of the Jewish right
to a national homeland. May we
one day soon be able to celebrate
too a Palestinian Day of Inde
pendence, one which from that
point forward will mark a peace
ful future of self-determination
and coexistence for all the peo
ples of the Holy Land.
In Friday's Daily, outgoing
ASSU President Michael Cruz
'l2 published an op-ed in sup
port of a petition advanced by a
group previously named "Stu
dents Confronting Apartheid by
Israel" (SCAI), now called "Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal
Rights" (SPER). SPER's —for
merly SCAI's petition advo
cates for "selective divestment"
from companies variously in
volved in Israeli activity east of Is
rael's pre-1967 border. Cruz's
title, "Why I support Israel, Pales
tine, and divestment," positions
him as supportive of all parties,
and in no way do I doubt
Michael's good intentions to aid
both peoples. However, Cruz has
fundamentally misunderstood
what "pro-Palestinian" and "pro-
Israeli" mean, which has been evi
denced in the days since his op-ed
was published by the elated disbe
lief of the SPER community on
the one hand "best ASSU pres
ident ever?" asked one vice presi
dent of SPER and the incredu
lous frustration of our community
on the other.
First and foremost, selective di
vestment is not pro-Israel because
if it succeeds, media reports will
never represent SPER's petition
as the carefully fine-tuned policy
position that it professes to be;
rather, the headlines will declare

that "STANFORD DIVESTS
FROM ISRAEL." Moreover, di
vestment is not pro-Israel because
it seeks to point the finger at and
punish only Israel for its per
ceived misdeeds, without examin
ing the record of the Palestinians
and their governing body, the
Palestinian Authority (PA). While
I can list many Israeli policies I
would like to see changed, Cruz in
his op-ed belies his avowal to
"promote all human rights" by
failing to consider what we might
demand of the Palestinians.
Should the PA recognize Israel's
right to exist as a Jewish state, as
they have failed to do? Should the
PA implement the institutions of a
real democracy, and the rights one
entails that are now regularly con
travened by the PA the free
doms of the press, of expression,
of religion? Most ironically, SPER
in its previous incarnation as
SCAI wrongly accused Israel of
somehow perpetrating apartheid,
but what of the clearer case of
Palestinian apartheid the offi
cial, abhorrent PA positions that a
future state in the West Bank must
be free of Jews, and its law that
selling property to Jews in the
West Bank is a capital offense?
In March, Cruz told me that he
believes "firmly" in "a strong state
of Israel," but his proposal Friday
only weakens Israel while failing
to strengthen the PA. In fact, the
West Bank's greatest hope today
is not divestment but the drive to
build up its civil society, led by PA
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad,
and most strongly supported by
the United States, who con
tributed $6OO million to the PA in
2010, and Israel. Both countries
work daily with the PA to train its
security forces, and the PA has
begun to successfully assume re
sponsibility for arresting and dis
arming terrorist factions within
its own midst. As security cooper
ation has dramatically improved,
Israel has been able to work with
Fayyad to bolster the economic,
health, and educational situations
significantly in the West Bank.
With a safer, stronger, and more
prosperous PA, Israel is safer;
with peoples that work more
closely hand-in-hand, the greater
trust that results enables brighter
prospects for peace.
