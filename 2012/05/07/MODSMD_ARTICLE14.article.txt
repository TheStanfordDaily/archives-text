## Eating disorders at Stanford 
### Nina Chung 
Two months ago, I wrote a
column about my eating dis
order. I had hoped to ex
plain why eating disorders them
selves were less a root problem
and more a symptom of a univer
sal issue: the desire for control.
Over the past couple years,
though, I've also begun noticing
the particularity of eating disor
ders at Stanford. The disorder per
sists because it's an internal psy
chology, which is an invisible topic,
"It happens, but no one talks
about it" because it is so well-cam
ouflaged. It weaves itself into
Stanford lives in so many ways.
Even if we on the outside see
the most blatant behavioral
changes in someone, our fear of
sounding judgmental prevents us
from saying anything. It's an unex
pected side effect of our emphasis
on total toleration. I always won
dered why not one person legiti
mately commented on my new,
committed habits that entire year.
Yet just a bit later, even I felt that
hesitancy when I recognized my
former seemingly innocuous
habits replayed by a dormmate. I
was passive and never addressed it
even after learning personally
the damage of the disorder. Later,
I discovered that she had indeed
been suffering and was in recov
ery. I'm now quite afraid of my
own ability to ignore.
The irony proceeds. Our cam
paigns for fitness, athleticism, eat
ing healthily and avoiding sugar

set a high standard for the country.
They react and respond to a
broader epidemic of obesity, low
food quality and sustainability is
sues. Equally destructive, though,
is the volatile swing to the other
extreme, where a one-size-fits-all
"health" formula becomes a life
purpose, which doesn't make
sense either. Health does not
equate to two people sitting at a
table, eating identical proportions
of vegetables and non-vegetables.
Yet still I hear "Oh, you eat so
healthily!" as a well-intended
compliment that once gave me a
burst of psychological energy to
continue depriving myself of calo
ries.
Stanford recognizes this, for
which I'm exceedingly apprecia
tive. I don't think there are many
other schools that so loudly and
creatively proclaim the holistic na
ture of wellness. It gets complicat
ed, though: in the process of pro
moting its importance, we too eas
ily short-circuit ourselves to focus
simply on its external face. It's an
extremely difficult line to gauge.
In any art or film class I've ever
taken, a major discussion has al
ways been about authenticity ver
sus image, for as something au
thentic grows in value, so does the
value of the image. The mechanics
of an eating disorder exemplify
this: relative to pursuing true spir
itual peace, the visible interpreta
tion is much more convenient.
And we fall for that, over and over

again, trusting our ability to follow
good strategy.
Which leads me also to a third
observation: certain personality
traits are both stellar for academ
ics and useful for eating disorders.
Think of how much strength and
destruction is contained in "per
fectionism," "high need for struc
ture," and thoughts like "I will only
eat 'good' things" (disorder symp
toms listed by Vaden). Several of
my friends confirm that their am
bitious work ethic and goal-ori
ented nature even a penchant
for numbers (counting calories)
were essential to sustaining an
eating disorder.
The difficulty in calling out an
eating disorder is that it is defined
by away of thinking, and the ac
tions that follow are only potential
indicators. Everyone eats differ
ently, grows up with different cul
tural standards and needs com
pletely variable things. But eating
disorders boil down to a question
of motives, which include but are
not limited to: an ever-decreasing
scale number, an appearance that
will never come and a distraction
from more emotional issues.
We are, however, at a place
where being unbelievably busy is
100 percent socially acceptable.
