# Seau and football violence

### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
I hate the news. I've never liked
watching the news, reading
the news or even knowing the
news. I know this is weird
because I work for a newspa
per. I know it's important to stay up
to-date on what's going on in the
world, but every time I see the news,
it depresses me. "News" seems to be
equivalent to "who was just killed"
and "what normal everyday objects
are slowly killing you" and "how the
government is screwing things up so
more people will die."
Sports, on the other hand, are
fun. Sports allow you to experience
every possible emotion without
ever getting in any danger. You can
yell and scream and cry, and all that
has changed is that some million
aires have run around a field. The
next day, you can go right back to it
while feeling good about life.
There are so many great things
about sports, and one of the best
parts is the distraction they can offer
from the world. No matter what is
happening in your life, sports can
give you that small amount of joy to
get you through the day.
Except sometimes even sports
can't escape the tragedies of the real
world.
On Wednesday, Jered Weaver
pitched a no-hitter for my favorite
team in the world, the Los Angeles
Angels of Anaheim. Yet his bril
liance on the mound was regret
tably pushed way down on every
sports news show in the world, and
for a good reason. On a day that
should have been about a baseball
no-hitter and playoffs in basketball
and hockey, football stole the show
for all the wrong reasons.
The story of the day was Junior
Seau, a former NFL linebacker who
was found dead at 43 with a gunshot
wound in his chest. Seau was one of
the best linebackers in history, and
his passion for the game was infec
tious. Growing up in Southern Cali
fornia, I couldn't help but root for
Seau on the San Diego Chargers
even though he went to USC. Be
fore I knew anything about football
defense (every new fan just watches
the ball), I watched Seau roam
around because he seemed to be in
volved in every single tackle.
The 12-time Pro Bowler ranks
10th all-time with 243 NFL starts,
and every anecdote from fellow
players says that he loved playing
the game every bit as much as fans
enjoyed watching him. But less than
a week ago, Seau shot himself in the
chest.
Seau's suicide is incredibly trag
ic, but it also brings up several ques
tions: Was playing football involved
in his death? Did it stem from con
cussions and lasting brain damage?
Was it because he didn't know what
to do with his life after his football
career ended?
Studies of Seau's brain could pro
vide some insight, but we will never
know the true answers to all these
questions. However, these questions
will undoubtedly lead to many more

doubts about the most popular sport
in America. Head injuries and brain
damage in football were already of
particular interest, and a suicide by a
future Hall of Famer will only acceler
ate the debate.
I love watching football and find
many of the recent personal foul
penalties excessive and annoying.
But clearly, both the safety of play
ers and their future well-being are
more important than a penalty flag
every so often. At some point,
though, this might not be enough.
Is football just inherently too vi
olent to survive? That question,
which would seem ridiculous a cou
ple years ago, has become much
more complicated. Wednesday's
other top story, the suspensions
given to Saints players for their
roles in the bounty scandal, does
nothing to minimize the issue. Play

ers slamming into each other on
every play is one thing, but players
doing their best to injure an oppo
nent is even more troubling. Com
bine this with stories of former play
ers like Seau who, for whatever rea
son, cannot live normal lives after
playing football, and the long-term
viability of football really becomes
questionable. Because let's be hon
est: non-contact football is not a rea
sonable option.
There's no easy answer to solve
the issues with football and player
safety, but acknowledging that
there is a real problem is the first
step toward saving and improving
the game. And when days like
Wednesday come around, it's im
possible to ignore that there is a real
problem with football.

Jacob Jaffe is still upset about the
career-ending concussion he sus
tained at last year's Ink Bowl. Help
