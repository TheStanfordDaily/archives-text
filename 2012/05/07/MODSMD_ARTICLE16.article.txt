## BEAT BY BEAVERS 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
A back-and-forth weekend in
Corvallis didn't exactly end the
way the No. 7 Stanford baseball
team had envisioned.
When junior shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger, down to his last strike,
tied Sunday's contest against No.
20 Oregon State at 4-4 in the top of
the ninth,it seemed that the Cardi
nal would have enough momen
tum to capture the rubber game
and return home with a series win.
But instead, Beaver third base
man Ryan Dunn singled off the
glove of junior Jake Stewart in left
center field in the bottom of the
tenth to clinch another close win
for Oregon State.
Instead of keeping pace with
conference leader No. 12 Oregon,
which beat No. 16 Arizona in two
of three in Tucson this weekend,
the Cardinal (29-14,11-10 Pac-12)
falls into a three-way tie for fifth in
the conference with Washington
and the very same Beavers that
halted Stanford's recent Pac-12
charge yesterday. All three teams
trail the Ducks by three and a half
games with only three weeks to
Play-
Though the Cardinal can lay
blame to some pitching anomalies
the flu-induced scratch of red
shirt junior lefthander Brett
Mooneyham on Saturday or the
unexpected (and unsuccessful)
start by junior righthander Sahil
Bloom on Sunday it was Stan
ford's hitting that fell short in both
losses. The Cardinal only got 13
combined hits over the three
games in the first eight innings, ral
lying to an impressive win 8-2 on
Friday night before mounting two
more late comebacks that just
weren't enough to secure a second
victory.
Junior leftfielder Stephen Pis
co tty paced the squad with his 7-
for-12 hitting clip on the road trip,
but was eventually credited with
yesterday's loss despite 4.2 innings
of solid work.
Junior righty Mark Appel gave
up six hits in as many innings to
start the series on Friday, but he
kept the Beavers off the board

into the seventh, when three base
knocks in a row spelled a late 2-0
lead for Oregon State.
"Mark looked great," sopho
more rightfielder Austin Wilson
told GoStanford.com. "It kind of
stunk because the first couple of
innings we couldn't support him."
But that support showed up in
full force in the final two frames.
Pisco tty and sophomore first base
man Brian Ragira each singled to
lead off the eighth against sopho
more starter Ben Wetzler. After
Wetzler was yanked, Wilson fol
lowed with a triple to tie the game

at two and freshman third base
man Alex Blandino tacked on a
double to give the Cardinal its first
lead.
A failed bunt and two straight
strikeouts ended the push, yet
Stanford wouldn't be stuck at
three runs for very long. With two
on and one out, Ragira made it 4-2
with his third hit of the afternoon
and a Wilson fielder's choice
pushed a fifth run across. Back-to
back doubles from Blandino and
fellow freshman Dominic Jose ex
tended the lead to five runs and a
single by junior catcher Eric Smith

capped the scoring at 8-2.
"It shows how we never, ever
stop battling," Wilson said. "Down
2-0 ... we put some more runs on
and didn't let them come back."
Stanford would be looking for
a miracle again on Saturday, with a
platoon of six pitchers throwing in
Mooneyham's absence and letting
Oregon State build a 4-0 lead
through seven innings. Freshman
lefty Jace Fry walked Jose to lead
off the eighth and gave him second
base on a wild pitch, but Jose
would advance no further with the
Cardinal flying out three straight
times to end the inning.
Piscotty drew another leadoff
walk in the ninth, helping set up
another key RBI double from
Blandino to make it 2-0 with one
out. It was Stanford's only extra
base hit of the afternoon and just
the fifth hit of any kind given up by
Fry, who quickly got out of the j am
to improve to 5-3 on his impres
sive rookie season.
Bloom was the surprise starter
on Sunday, replacing struggling
freshman John Hochstatter and
sophomore A.J. Vanegas, who had
pitched in relief of Appel on Fri
day night. But the junior's first
start of the season didn't last very
long, as he gave up three runs
all of them coming with two outs
â€”in the first two innings and
quickly gave way to Vanegas.
Stanford nearly drew even in
the sixth, with Piscotty and Ragira
singling with two outs to make it 3-
2. But Beaver righty Dan Child
limited the damage and got his
team out of the inning, allowing
Oregon State to tack on an insur
ance run in the bottom of the
eighth and seemingly put the
game in the books.
The Cardinal had some more
drama in store for its hosts, howev
er, as Wilson was hit by a pitch and
Blandino singled to also get on
with no outs. Down 4-2, Smith
then belted a fly ball to deep right
field that was not quite hard
enough to get to the fences but still
moved Wilson to third. Jose fol
lowed with RBI groundout to cut
the margin in half.
