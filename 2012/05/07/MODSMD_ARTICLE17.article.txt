# BOWLSBY ACCEPTS BIG 12 JOB
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
On Friday, Stanford athletic director Bob
Bowlsby was introduced as the new commis
sioner of the Big 12 Conference, officially
making his move away from the Farm after six
years at Stanford.
Bowlsby's successful tenure at Stanford
was marked by 10 national titles as well as the
hiring of coaches Jim Harbaugh, David Shaw
and Johnny Dawkins, but now the lowa native
takes over a conference that has been in tur
moil for the past three years.
The Big 12 has lost four of its members in
the last two years Nebraska to the Big Ten,
Colorado to the Pac-12 and Texas A&M and
Missouri to the SEC all of which led to the
firing of former commissioner Dan Beebe in
2011. But the man hired to replace Beebe told
reporters at his introductory press conference
that the Big 12 is in a good place for the future,
as it added TCU and West Virginia to the con
ference this year to replace recent departures
A&M and Missouri.
"I, like many people, had a vision of this
conference as unstable," Bowlsby said Friday

in Irving, Tex. "What I found instead was a
group of chief executive officers that were very
committed to one another and very commit
ted to the best principles of intercollegiate ath
letics. I was very quickly put at ease relative to
the stability of the group and the ongoing com
mitment to one another."
Bowlsby, who will take over as commission
er on June 15, was seen as the ideal candidate
for the Big 12 job because of his exceptionally
successful tenures at Stanford and at the Uni
versity of lowa, where he worked from 1991-
2005. He also contributed significantly to the
lucrative media deals of both of those schools'
conferences, particularly the Pac-12's current
$3 billion, 12-year television contract with
ESPN and Fox. Additionally, Bowlsby was
present for the birth of both of those confer
ences' television networks the Big Ten Net
work, which launched in 2007, and the Pac-12
Network, which will launch in August 2012.
Bowlsby's role in the media network ex
pansion of the Big Ten and Pac-12 was critical
to his hiring as Big 12 commissioner because
the turbulent conference is currently working
on a new television deal of its own.
"He's been very involved in the television

aspects of conferences he has served, from the
formation of the Big Ten network to the Pac
-12 network and, of course, the related televi
sion agreements," Burns Hargis, the president
of Oklahoma State, told ESPN. "Obviously
that's a very valuable talent that we intend to
take full advantage of."
Bowlsby's other challenge will be deter
mining if the conference needs to expand, as
the Big 12's major quirk is that it currently only
has ten member schools, which prevents it
from staging a conference championship
game. Conference championship games gen
erally require 12 teams, and they serve as
major boons to any conference's pocketbooks;
the SEC, ACC, Big Ten, and Pac-12 all have
title games. However, Bowlsby said he current
ly didn't know where exactly the conference
would go with its membership.
"I'm not going to presume a direction that
we would go," he said. "There's nothing magic
about 11 or 12.1 come in with no preconceived
notions of what the right number is ... I'm
pretty excited about the 10 institutions that we
have."
