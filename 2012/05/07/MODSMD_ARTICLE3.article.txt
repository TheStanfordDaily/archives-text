## Exec order targets recruiting efforts at for-profit universities 
### ERIN INMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A recent executive order aimed at preventing insti
tutions of higher learning from aggressively recruiting
veterans will have minimal effect at Stanford because
the University does not profit from veterans' benefits,
according to campus administrators.
President Barack Obama signed the executive
order last week, which primarily targets for-profit insti
tutions. Veterans may receive financial benefits from
the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) through
programs such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill or Yellow Rib
bon Program.
Stanford strives for a "transparent" process regard
ing veterans' financial aid, according to Ron Diaz, a
student services manager in the Financial Aid Office.
At Stanford, financial aid for veterans follows the
same process as the general population of students.
The Financial Aid Office reviews all the financial re
sources of a student to calculate their need. After this
review, Stanford sends the student an award letter,
which details the cost of their education, the resources
they think the student has and the amount of aid Stan
ford is able to offer.

"What differs is that veterans who will bring VA
money in will just have that resource," Diaz said.
Because receiving aid from the VA can be a com
plex process of paperwork, Stanford is "very sensitive
to the vets," Diaz said. He added that the University
tries to demystify the process of receiving veteran aid
as much as possible.
"Stanford makes the greatest attempts to be as
transparent as possible," he said.
The University, however, has no formal recruiting
process for veterans, a departure from other institu
tions that actively recruit students at military installa
tions, according to The New York Times.
Instead, Stanford has only a separate website for
veteran applicants. According to Joseph Kralick, the
veterans' liaison in the admissions office, the purpose
of this website is "to recognize the unique questions
and concerns of our veteran applicants."
Because many veteran students have taken non
traditional educational routes, most apply as transfer
students, according to Kralick. In fall 2011, nine veter
ans were admitted as part of Stanford's transfer class.
The non-traditional route of veterans contributes
to the diversity of Stanford under
graduates. In particular, according
to the website intended for helping
veterans navigate the application
process, "veteran applicants add a
highly valued voice to the under
graduate community."
"The particular voice not
probably what they have in mind,
but how I view it is the voice
coming from the enlisted levels,"
said Sergeant Chris Clark 'l2, who
served two tours in Iraq in the Ma
rine Corps Reconnaissance Unit
and is now the Stanford Veterans
Group representative on the veter

ans' admission website. "Given the
recent conflicts, many of these stu
dents have had multiple tours."
The website continued to say
"the life experience that students
bring from previous career paths or
military service provides a unique
perspective in discussion seminars,
student groups and campus activi
ties."

"At Stanford, we're used to hear
ing the top-down view of the mili
tary or organizations as a whole,"
Clark said, citing events featuring
CEOs of corporations and military
colonels. "When you get veterans
from enlisted ranks, you get a very
bottom-up level of military perspec
tive."
