## French vote a rejection of Sarkozy, panelists say 
### FELIX BOYEAUX 
Frangois Flollande defeated in
cumbent Nicolas Sarkozy to be
elected as president of France on
Sunday, an outcome predicted by
panelists at a round table discussion
about the French presidential elec
tion Friday in Encina Hall.
"No matter who wins the elec
tion, we're heading towards very dif
ficult times in France," said Laurent
Cohen-Tanugi, a visiting lecturer at
Stanford Law School and an inter
national lawyer.
The panel's speakers pointed out
a trend of French voters rallying be
hind extreme left- or right-wing par
ties, who represent anti-establish
ment, anti-globalization and a gen
eral distrust in the European Union
(EU). They agreed that this trend
was true for the election in general.
"This is clearly an election
against Sarkozy rather than a vote
for Hollande," Cohen-Tanugi said.
He added that Hollande, who
will be the first member of France's
Socialist Party to become president
since Francois Mitterrand left office
in 1995, "has been very successful at
playing this game, positioning him
self as pro-growth and pro-spending
while making Sarkozy appear as an
advocate of austerity and welfare
cuts."
Jimia Boutouba, assistant profes
sor in modern languages and litera
tures at Santa Clara University,
agreed that the French almost seem
unworried about the future, but fo
cused instead on getting Sarkozy out
of office.
"The nation is more and more
defined by what it opposes," she said.
The panelists discussed what
Hollande's election would mean for
the future of France.

"If Hollande is elected, he will
have to face the test of the financial
markets, in view of his electoral
promises and his position on the Eu
ropean fiscal compact," Cohen-
Tanugi said.
Arthur Goldhammer, senior af
filiate at the Center for European
Studies at Harvard and renowned
blogger about French political cul
ture, said it would be difficult to act
on the current opposition to transna
tional unions such as the EU in
France.
"It is unrealistic and misleading
to believe that France could leave
the Union," Goldhammer said.
When asked about the how Fran
co-Germanic relations would sur
vive the break-up of the "Merkozy"
couple referring to the close re
lationship between German Chan
cellor Angela Merkel and Sarkozy
Cohen-Tanugi said he is opti
mistic.
"The Merkel-Hollande couple
would probably fall into place," he
said. "It will work out like these
things always do."
Goldhammer's view of the fu
ture, however, was less bright.
"Hollande is looking for no more
than symbolic concessions from
Merkel," Goldhammer said. "But
Europe needs more than that to
fight the Euro-crisis."
Goldhammer said another prob
lem that France is currently facing is
the integration of its immigrant pop
ulation.
"The presidential debate has all
been about immigration figures and
not enough about the integration of
these very immigrants," he said.
"Second and third generation
immigrants usually abstain [from
elections] since they are alienated by
the political discussion," Boutouba

added to Goldhammer's comment.
"This silence is one of the main rea
sons [behind] Marine Le Pen's 18
percent of votes, almost 6.4 million
people."
Le Pen, a far-right leader of
France's National Front party,
placed third in the first round of the
French presidential election.
Cohen-Tanugi, however, said
that "if the polls turn out to be true,
Hollande's victory may well lead to
the implosion of the right."
FSI Europe Center Associate
Director Roland Hsu said he was
pleased with the turnout to the
round table discussion.
"At the Europe Center, we al
ways try to make as comprehensive
an event as possible, interesting both
for faculty and staff) but also mainly
for undergraduates," Hsu said. "We
are really happy that so many stu
dents actually showed up."
