# Menlo Park Fire Protection District to service SLAC
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Alice Phillips 
The Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment (PAFD) will no longer serve
the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory as the Menlo Park
Fire Protection District (MPFPD)
took over the responsibilities for
providing fire and emergency as
sistance to SLAC last Tuesday.
MPFPD located under two
miles from the lab has a three
year contract to provide fire serv
ices to the lab. PAFD previously
operated Station 7 on site at SLAC
near Building 44.
The new agreement also in
volves the Woodside Fire Protec
tion District, which will provide
supplemental emergency services

to the lab when necessary.
Medical-aid response time
from MPFPD is four minutes,
which SLAC estimates to be two
minutes longer than the current
response from the on-site station.
MPFPD is within the required six
minute fire call response time re
quired by the National Fire Pro
tection Association and the De
partment of Energy.
The change comes following a
decrease in emergency calls at
SLAC and an enhancement of the
lab's emergency detection and re
sponse system. SLAC currently
places fewer than 100 calls per
year, a sharp decrease from the
more than 400 per year that was
normal in the 19905, according to a
SLAC press release.
