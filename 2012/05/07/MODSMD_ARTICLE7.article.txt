# STUDENT LIFE
## Admins, students talk mental health stigma 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
This is the last in a four-part series on
crisis response and mental health re
sources on campus.

Over the past week, The Daily
has examined how the University re
sponds to and works to prevent men
tal health crises, the campus re
sources that exist to help students
who are struggling and how students
themselves experience those servic
es.
Today's piece examines how stu
dents and administrators think the
University and student body can
work together in the wake of tragedy
to destigmatize the discussion of
mental health and illness. Many ad
ministrators said they believe more
focus must be put on giving students
the tools to deal with everyday stress.
The Office of Student Affairs, Resi
dential Educational and Counseling
and Psychological Services (CAPS)
are all either finishing reports and
initiatives related to student life and
mental health or about to undertake
new task forces on the topic.

Wellness and education
According to Carole Pertofsky,
director of Wellness and Health Pro
motion Services (HPS) at Vaden
Health Center, the University needs
to devote more resources to the
mental health and well-being needs
of students who are not clinically di
agnosed with a disorder.
"I think we are so amiss in focus
ing all of our attention on students
when they are already downstream
and not looking at what we can be
doing upstream," Pertofsky said.
"I'm about the 80 percent of stu
dents who struggle and find them
selves sometimes thriving and some

times barely coping, sometimes
thriving and flourishing, sometimes
hanging on, sometimes falling off, re
silient enough to brush yourself off
and get back on eventually."
Pertofsky said HPS reaches thou
sands of students a year through
classes, programming and the Hap
piness Conference with a staff of
only five people, but the department
needs more resources. The Happi
ness Conference has sold out its 400-
person capacity within 24 hours in
recent years, and Pertofsky said that
feedback after the event always en
courages HPS to host the event
more frequently during the year.
The allocation of University re
sources changed following a 2008 re
port on Mental Health and Well
Being, but Pertofsky said the
changes did not aid the prevention of
students becoming depressed or sui
cidal.

"I was very disappointed because
although there was a lot of lip service
given to quote 'prevention,' in actu
ality, every penny went to hire more
mental health clinicians," Pertofsky
said. "That is not prevention."
Greg Boardman, Vice Provost of
Student Affairs, and Dean of Stu
dent Life Chris Griffith said they
have not seen any formal HPS re
quests for additional resources.

Resilience from Grief
"The recent student deaths
[have] a large impact on students,
even those who may not have direct
ly known the students who have
died," said CAPS director Ron Al
bucher. "It gives people pause, it
makes people reflect not only on
their own mortality, but maybe
thoughts that they've had on their
own about suicide or about family or
friends who have dealt with it."
"I'm hoping that a sense of com
passion for the whole student body
is kept in mind," Albucher added.
Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9, dean
of freshmen and undergraduate ad
vising and associate vice provost for
undergraduate education, shared
some lessons she learned from her
own grieving 20 years ago, after the
loss of her brother and father in her
late 20s.
"I didn't grieve the death of my
brother in a healthy way I put
blinders on, so I could finish law
school," Lythcott-Haims said.
"It was three months after my
father died that I realized I couldn't
think very clearly couldn't or
ganize my thoughts, couldn't organ
ize my day, "Lythcott-Haims said.
"A friend pulled me aside and said,
'I think you're grieving.' I didn't
know what that meant."
Helena Bonde 'l2, a friend of
Cady Hine, the junior who died at
her home in Palo Alto on April 1,
said that she feels there is no prop
er way to grieve.
"I was angry at myself for not
getting over [Hine's death] faster,
for not productively grieving all of
the time," Bonde said. "For not
somehow getting through it 'right',
doing everything 'right.' Being able
to compartmentalize it enough to
do work, and then go back and do it
properly, like I was some kind of
perfect grief-handling product that
could just do it all."
Lythcott-Haims suggested that
the Student Grief and Loss Work
shop, sponsored by CAPS, ResEd
and the Office for Religious Life, be
held more frequently than twice a
quarter. Making this resource more
permanent, she said, would in
crease visibility to students and re
duce stigma around looking for
support while grieving.

Decreasing stigma, deflating the
'Duck'

In addition to citing stigma sur
rounding student grief, every stu
dent and administrator interviewed
for this series identified a stigma
around discussing mental health
and seeking treatment. While this
stigma exists elsewhere, many
agreed that there are challenges
unique to Stanford most no
tably, the "Stanford Duck Syn
drome."
Students and administrators

both commented on the pressures
and conditions of Stanford —to
find a group of friends, to do well in
classes, to be successful and to
'change the world.' This pressure,
they said, creates an environment
where struggling or even show
ing signs of struggle —is futile
against the backdrop of blue, sunny
skies, palm-lined roads and smiling
students.
"I think the greatest threat to
Stanford students is recovering
from failure," said Juan-Carlos
Foust 'l3.
"I think that mental health and
struggling with feelings of unwor
thiness are a lot more common than
we might think," said another stu
dent, who is currently on a leave of
absence due to anxiety and depres
sion issues. "Once we scratch a little
bit below the surface, I feel like
everyone I've talked to at that level
has told me 'I feel like I'm not doing
enough. I feel like I'm inferior.'"
Albucher commented that, with
all of Stanford's resources, one-fifth
of the campus is still likely to experi
ence some form of depression or
mental illness.
"If you look at typical ages of
presentation, most mental health
problems show up in the late teens
and early 205," Albucher said. "And
so, while we'll continue to make ef
forts at prevention, some people will
still nonetheless have depression,
anxiety and other problems."
Deborah Golder, dean of
ResEd, said that one step toward
solving this problem is to recognize
that Stanford is not immune from is
sues present in 'the real world.'
"Stanford is not free of society.
We are a microcosm," Golder said.
Students said the most important
step is creating a safe space for con
versations about these topics in resi
dences, student organizations and
especially within groups of friends.
Bonde described feeling like she
came to Stanford unable to express
her emotions without 'raining on the
parade' of freshman year, but said
her experience was different when
she actually spoke out.
"I found people one by one,"
Bonde said. "I found individual peo
ple who somehow, I or they let slip
that actually they were from a really
poor family, or their parents were al
coholics, or they just felt so alienated
by the culture here. And I'd be like,
'me too.'"
"The greatest force of healing is
community based," said Sam Press
man 'l2. "We need to have a real un
derstanding of the way community
works and what makes community
be trusting and loving —of what

will allow us to not feel the shame of
our struggles and, rather, the com
monality of them."
Lythcott-Haims said she wants
conversations sparked by FACES, a
panel for freshmen during New Stu
dent Orientation (NSO) that seeks
to expose the diversity of back
grounds and experiences represent
ed at Stanford, and The Resilience
Project, which shares faculty and ad
ministrator stories of distress, failure
and resilience, to continue past
freshman year.

Moving toward
Across the University, depart
ments are working on a number of
initiatives related to mental health
and well-being. Students expressed
commitment to fostering dialogue
and remained optimistic about what
change the collective campus can
achieve.
CAPS is making an effort to be
more present in the community,
both directly through office
hours in community centers like the
LGBT-CRC, among others and
indirectly, through attending student
events, according to Albucher.
Students still suggest that CAPS
might be even more present
through sitting in dining halls, visit
ing dorms once a month or offering
residential programming about de
pression and mental illness on cam
pus and resources for addressing

them.
UAR is revisiting the structure of
freshman year through a program
called 'Stanford 101,' according to
Associate Dean Koren Bakkegard.
Stanford 101 seeks to improve
how freshmen navigate resources
and how they reflect on their per
sonal growth.
The University has completed
nearly all of the 18 recommenda
tions made by the 2008 Mental
Health and Well Being Task Force,
Boardman said, and is now creating
an advisory board, chaired by Al
bucher and Associate Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Sally Dickson, to
monitor what the University is and
could be doing with mental health
services and resources.
Students themselves are organiz
ing. One pilot program called 'Share
Your Secrets' exposes students in
Arrillaga Dining Commons to con
cerns faced by anonymous peers.
Nicoletta von Heidegger 'l3,
who works at The Bridge Peer
Counseling Center and the Stanford
Sexual Health Peer Resource Cen
ter, sent an email to students and ad
ministrators involved with mental
health on campus last week, seeking
to "create a campus where mental
health is something that is worked
into everyday at Stanford."
"My dream would be to have a
required series either during NSO
or a required class/workshop that

students take their freshman year, a
Stanford emotional health class, if
you will," Heidegger wrote students.
"Or, better yet a 'help your friend
workshop' where people learn the
skills they need to help themselves
or a friend who is struggling emo
tionally."
Heiddeger is organizing a meet
ing of students, faculty and adminis
trators — including Human Biolo
gy Professor Lisa Medoff, who offers
a course on adolescent mental
health, and HPS student affairs offi
cer Donnovan Yisrael 'BB, M.A. 'B9
to discuss these goals. The group
will meet this Tuesday at 9 p.m. in
Old Union.
Many resident assistants (RAs)
are promoting open conversation
within dorms. Daniel Scott Smith
'I3,RA of EAST.sent an email to his
residence last week charging stu
dents to speak with one another.
"As those affected by suicide,
let us not be passive bystanders,"
Smith wrote. "Let us talk openly
and deliberately about suicide,
specifically, but also about mental
illness and health more generally.
Moreover, we should all know that
we have a right to talk about our
feelings, and that, at Stanford,
there is always someone to listen
and to help."
