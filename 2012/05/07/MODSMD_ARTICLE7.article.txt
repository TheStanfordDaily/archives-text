# STUDENT LIFE
## Admins, students talk mental health stigma 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY DESK EDITOR 
This is the last in a four-part series on
crisis response and mental health re
sources on campus.

Over the past week, The Daily
has examined how the University re
sponds to and works to prevent men
tal health crises, the campus re
sources that exist to help students
who are struggling and how students
themselves experience those servic
es.
Today's piece examines how stu
dents and administrators think the
University and student body can
work together in the wake of tragedy
to destigmatize the discussion of
mental health and illness. Many ad
ministrators said they believe more
focus must be put on giving students
the tools to deal with everyday stress.
The Office of Student Affairs, Resi
dential Educational and Counseling
and Psychological Services (CAPS)
are all either finishing reports and
initiatives related to student life and
mental health or about to undertake
new task forces on the topic.

Wellness and education
According to Carole Pertofsky,
director of Wellness and Health Pro
motion Services (HPS) at Vaden
Health Center, the University needs
to devote more resources to the
mental health and well-being needs
of students who are not clinically di
agnosed with a disorder.
"I think we are so amiss in focus
ing all of our attention on students
when they are already downstream
and not looking at what we can be
doing upstream," Pertofsky said.
"I'm about the 80 percent of stu
dents who struggle and find them
selves sometimes thriving and some

times barely coping, sometimes
thriving and flourishing, sometimes
hanging on, sometimes falling off, re
silient enough to brush yourself off
and get back on eventually."
Pertofsky said HPS reaches thou
sands of students a year through
classes, programming and the Hap
piness Conference with a staff of
only five people, but the department
needs more resources. The Happi
ness Conference has sold out its 400-
person capacity within 24 hours in
recent years, and Pertofsky said that
feedback after the event always en
courages HPS to host the event
more frequently during the year.
The allocation of University re
sources changed following a 2008 re
port on Mental Health and Well
Being, but Pertofsky said the
changes did not aid the prevention of
students becoming depressed or sui
cidal.

"I was very disappointed because
although there was a lot of lip service
given to quote 'prevention,' in actu
ality, every penny went to hire more
mental health clinicians," Pertofsky
said. "That is not prevention."
Greg Boardman, Vice Provost of
Student Affairs, and Dean of Stu
dent Life Chris Griffith said they
have not seen any formal HPS re
quests for additional resources.

Resilience from Grief
"The recent student deaths
[have] a large impact on students,
even those who may not have direct
ly known the students who have
died," said CAPS director Ron Al
bucher. "It gives people pause, it
makes people reflect not only on
their own mortality, but maybe
thoughts that they've had on their
own about suicide or about family or
