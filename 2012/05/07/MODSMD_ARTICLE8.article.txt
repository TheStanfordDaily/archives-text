## Engagement Summit promotes public service 
### AARON SEKHRI STAFF WRITER 
Matt Flannery 'OO, M.A. 'Ol,
founder of Kiva, a non-profit or
ganization that allows individuals
to make microfinance loans to
people in developing countries,
admitted to an audience of stu
dents Sunday that his last year at
Stanford was "discombobulating
and fragmenting."
"There was so much at stake,
graduating felt like walking off a
plank," Flannery said.
After graduation, Flannery
worked at TiVo, but said he found

himself questioning how to inte
grate service into his life. Accord
ing to Flannery, service helped
him overcome his fears.
"Fear comes from threats
against yourself, or your person, or
your livelihood," Flannery said.
"But really, when you serve others
or some cause, there is no reason
to fear anymore, because it's not
about you anymore, but it's about
the issue or some person."
Flannery was one of four pan
elists who spoke at "The Engage
ment Summit," an event held in
Old Union, which was organized
by the ASSU and aimed at dis
cussing issues of service and char
ity. Other speakers included for
mer Senator Mike Gravel (D-
Alaska), Change.org's Sam
McAfee and Blissmo founder
Sundeep Ahuja 'OO.
"We live in a really troublingly
unequal world," Flannery said
about the need for service.
McAfee said it was his up
bringing in an activist household
coupled with his passion for com
puter science that led him to
search for a career that would syn
thesize the two interests. He first
founded Radical Fusion, an Inter
net consulting company that
served non-profits, before shut
ting it down and moving to
Change.org.
"The main theme of my work
has been to not fear failure, to
learn from it and to constantly it
erate over good and bad ideas,"
McAfee said.
Ahuja emphasized the impor
tance of introspection and having
a specific idea of the personal in
vestment of service.
"Service was always about fun
and just doing what I love in away
that I feel happy about what I'm
doing," Ahuja said. "Service is
most powerful when it is done in a
way that aligns your interests with
what is beneficial."
Ahuja asked audience mem
bers to question what service
means for them.
"While it may lead to embar

rassing answers, at least you'll
know why you're doing some
thing, which means you're being
authentic with yourself," he said.
Gravel discussed the merits of
direct democracy as a solution to
the current governance problem.
Gravel said that his organization,
the National Citizens' Initiative for
Democracy, aims to raise aware
ness about direct democracy and
call for a shift in governance.
"The people will originate, set
and vote on policy," Gravel said of
his ideal governing system.
Audience questions ranged
from the issue of ASSU represen
tation of the student body to how
to effectively measure the impact
of service in the social sector.
"I have always been interested
in public service, but this event
gave me many perspectives of
what service means in the real
world, and I think that this event
actually made me value my Stan
ford education a bit more highly,
for everything that I can go on and
do with it," Yongjian Si 'l4 said.
