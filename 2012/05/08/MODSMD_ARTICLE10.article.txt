# HALF-INVENTED
## Don't let me cave in 
### Chase Ishii 
Prior to the 2012 baseball sea
son, Albert Pujols, commonly
referred to as the best hitter of
our generation and a future Hall of
Famer, signed with the Los Angeles
Angels of Anaheim for a 10-year,
$254 million monster of a contract.
Along with the obvious excitement
and expectations, questions and
speculations dominated the head
lines. At 32 years, is he on the de
cline? Will he be worth the money?
Fast-forward to the present, 30
games into the worst season of Pu
jols' career. Pujols failed to hit a
home run until his 111 th at bat on
Sunday, the longest drought in his
career. Every couple days, there
was a new video or article on ESPN
about why Pujols was hitting so
poorly, and they all agreed he was
pressing; he was trying too hard.
Despite everything he said in inter
views, his swing showed he was try
ing to break the pressure of the
media and prove he was worth the
$254 million contract. He was
swinging at bad pitches and pulling
long shots foul by getting ahead of
the pitch. Rather than just playing
the game he'd always played so
well, he was trying too hard to prove
himself to others. And ironically, his
first home run came after taking a
game off.
I would be audacious enough to
assume that no one reading this arti
cle is getting paid $254 million dol
lars to do their job or having every
grade and every comment scruti
nized in the national media, but that
doesn't mean we don't feel the pres
sure to perform or prove ourselves
to others, or maybe even ourselves. I
feel a lot of college students feel the
weight of unbearable pressures and
expectations, and the harder we try

to uphold them, the longer we stand
directly beneath their weight until
we eventually cave in.
I recently talked with a sopho
more who is finishing the Hum√üio
core this quarter. She's struggled
and despised every minute of it
since fall quarter, but continues tak
ing classes because she feels she has
to prove something to her parents.
Since starting high school, her par
ents had always pushed her to be a
doctor not in a threatening way,
but because they truly believed
that's what she wanted. She is no
longer studying for herself or those
she may be able to help as a doctor,
but to not disappoint her parents.
Every test has become about how
many points she's missed the curve
by, and every day is pervaded by her
fear of not getting into a medical
school.
I have another friend who is the
first of his family togotocollege.He
has two younger sisters and a
younger brother that look to him as
an example. He feels that, given his
opportunity, he has a responsibility
to his family to make tons and tons
of money in order to improve their
life. And when he didn't get the in
ternship he wanted this summer, he
broke down. He felt guilty that he
had let his family down.
As a college student, I often get
caught up in the day-to-day rou
tines and tasks and don't stop to ask
why I am doing what I'm doing. Is it
because I truly enjoy it and made a
commitment, or is it because I feel I
have to prove myself to someone?
The latter may not always seem like
a bad thing. Sometimes it leads to
better grades or a better job, but it
also robs us of our worth and places
it in the hands of another person

just as broken and insecure. Rather
than acting out of a pervading sense
of freedom in the options and op
portunities in front of us, we be
come enslaved to what we believe
others expect from us.
When will you have accom
plished enough that you no longer
feel the need to prove yourself?
Once you've won a World Series?
Once you've signed the second
largest contract in baseball history?
Maybe that point never comes, and
maybe it is better to identify the
source of pressure so you can step
out from underneath it. Take some
time for yourself to figure out what
you really love doing. Create space
to develop your individuality. Have
those difficult confrontations with
the people you feel pressured by.
Odds are they don't realize how
negatively their words and actions
affect you. Surround yourself with
encouraging people who don't
make you feel like you have to earn
or deserve their approval. Don't
cave in.

We become
enslaved to what we
believe others expect
from us.
