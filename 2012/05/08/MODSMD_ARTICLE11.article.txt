# FROM FARM TO FORK
## Cooking something up 
### Jenny Rempel 
On the gas stove whose pilot
lights never work, oversize
pots bubble furiously
under mismatched lids. There is a
deep rumble as the overhead fan
emerges from its stupor and be
gins literally sucking air out of the
room, frantically trying to fore
stall another run-in with the fire
men. It's 15 minutes until dinner
time, and things are as they should
be in Synergy.
Several friends spent the after
noon preparing pesto, whole
wheat pasta, goat cheese salad,
roasted asparagus and blackberry
pies for dinner in this house of 50
students. Although things have
become a little hectic in the final
minutes before serving, all seven
girls now helping in the kitchen
have had a wonderful time cook
ing.
This is a rare scene on campus,
though. While cooking is a daily
part of life in cooperative houses
like mine, the majority of campus
residences don't offer students
meaningful opportunities to learn
in the kitchen.
This is a missed opportunity
for Stanford to teach students an
essential life skill. Cooking can
build community, empower stu
dents as actors in their food sys
tems and demonstrate the envi
ronmental, social and health im
plications of food.
But the blame does not lie en
tirely with campus administrators.
Even in the heart of the foodie
Bay Area, Stanford lacks a cook
ing culture. Students are often
more fond of going out to eat on
weekends than staying in to cook
their own meals. With thesis dead
vlines, midterms and job inter

views, preparing food with others
just isn't always a priority.
Stanford students can choose
to live in one of 10 residence halls,
20 self-ops, nine Greek houses,
seven co-ops or several apart
ments. That's a great diversity of
choices, many of which even offer
students open kitchens to explore.
Dorm kitchenettes, however, can
be dirty, undersupplied and
cramped spaces that don't foster
much enthusiasm toward cook
ing. So while part of Stanford's
lacking cooking culture comes
from the students, part of the
problem lies with the University's
undervaluation of cooking as a
worthwhile pursuit.
Parts of the Stanford popula
tion crave more opportunities to
get into the kitchen. Farm-to-Fork
cooking workshops hosted by the
Stanford Farm Project are rou
tinely oversubscribed, and the up
coming Cardinal Cook-Off host
ed by Stanford Dining attracts a
group of avid student chefs each
year.
Perhaps these students recog
nize the values inherent to
preparing food. Cooking for our
selves gives us more control over
our diet and health. In a study of
one public health intervention
program, researchers at UC-
Berkeley found that students who
cook more end up eating an addi
tional serving of fruits and vegeta

bles per day when compared to
their peers. These findings have
been corroborated by additional
studies from the Harvard Medical
School and the University of Min
nesota, and at a time when dia
betes figures prominently in
America, cooking may be a good
personal and public health inter
vention for individuals of all ages.
Although it is a less tangible
benefit, cooking also builds com
munity. At Synergy, it's hard not to
form a bond with your neighbor
when you've been assigned to
dice an entire 25-pound bag of
carrots. Along with questions
about how many carrots it would
take to turn a person orange, de
tails about house residents' life
histories and struggles simply
emerge when cooking together.
Cooking can also serve to fos
ter an environmental ethic, build
confidence and provide a produc
tive, restorative outlet from any

residual paper-writing stress. I've
seen this happen during several
cooking classes in the Stanford
Dining Demonstration Kitchen as
part of a student initiated course
that emphasizes experiential
learning as a core part of its cur
riculum. Students are thrilled to
understand the processes behind
preparing meals, from shopping
and budgeting to planning, cook
ing and eating. The process and
experience of cooking creates a
deeper understanding and basis
for understanding the many pub
lic health, economic, nutritional,
social and political topics that in
tersect in our food systems.
However, at an academic insti
tution like Stanford, there is often
pushback against subjects that
seem to fall outside the tradition
al intellectual scope. When I pro
posed teaching a student-initiated
class on personal empowerment
in interdisciplinary food systems.

the first piece of advice I received
from administrators and advisors
was to cut back on the cooking
classes. Cooking may not immedi
ately appear to be an academic
pursuit, but many other practical
crafts are taught at Stanford
(think of sculpting, storytelling,
painting and farming). What's
more, if included as part of a
broader academic learning
process with consideration of the
environmental, social, economic
and political implications of our
food systems, cooking becomes a
deeply academic pursuit.
So here's a call for more cook
ing on campus. Students, faculty
and staff alike might benefit
greatly from a little more chop
ping, simmering, sauteing and stir
frying.

students. Although things have
become a little hectic in the final
minutes before serving, all seven
girls now helping in the kitchen
have had a wonderful time cook
ing.
This is a rare scene on campus,
though. While cooking is a daily
part of life in cooperative houses
like mine, the majority of campus
residences don't offer students
meaningful opportunities to learn
in the kitchen.
This is a missed opportunity
for Stanford to teach students an
essential life skill. Cooking can
build community, empower stu
dents as actors in their food sys
tems and demonstrate the envi
ronmental, social and health im
plications of food.
But the blame does not lie en
tirely with campus administrators.
Even in the heart of the foodie
Bay Area, Stanford lacks a cook
ing culture. Students are often
more fond of going out to eat on
weekends than staying in to cook
their own meals. With thesis dead
vlines, midterms and job inter

views, preparing food with others
just isn't always a priority.
Stanford students can choose
to live in one of 10 residence halls,
20 self-ops, nine Greek houses,
seven co-ops or several apart
ments. That's a great diversity of
choices, many of which even offer
students open kitchens to explore.
Dorm kitchenettes, however, can
be dirty, undersupplied and
cramped spaces that don't foster
much enthusiasm toward cook
ing. So while part of Stanford's
lacking cooking culture comes
from the students, part of the
problem lies with the University's
undervaluation of cooking as a
worthwhile pursuit.
Parts of the Stanford popula
tion crave more opportunities to
get into the kitchen. Farm-to-Fork
cooking workshops hosted by the
Stanford Farm Project are rou
tinely oversubscribed, and the up
coming Cardinal Cook-Off host
ed by Stanford Dining attracts a
group of avid student chefs each
year.
Perhaps these students recog
nize the values inherent to
preparing food. Cooking for our
selves gives us more control over
our diet and health. In a study of
one public health intervention
program, researchers at UC-
Berkeley found that students who
cook more end up eating an addi
tional serving of fruits and vegeta

bles per day when compared to
their peers. These findings have
been corroborated by additional
studies from the Harvard Medical
School and the University of Min
nesota, and at a time when dia
betes figures prominently in
America, cooking may be a good
personal and public health inter
vention for individuals of all ages.
Although it is a less tangible
benefit, cooking also builds com
munity. At Synergy, it's hard not to
form a bond with your neighbor
when you've been assigned to
dice an entire 25-pound bag of
carrots. Along with questions
about how many carrots it would
take to turn a person orange, de
tails about house residents' life
histories and struggles simply
emerge when cooking together.
Cooking can also serve to fos
ter an environmental ethic, build
confidence and provide a produc
tive, restorative outlet from any

residual paper-writing stress. I've
seen this happen during several
cooking classes in the Stanford
Dining Demonstration Kitchen as
part of a student initiated course
that emphasizes experiential
learning as a core part of its cur
riculum. Students are thrilled to
understand the processes behind
preparing meals, from shopping
and budgeting to planning, cook
ing and eating. The process and
experience of cooking creates a
deeper understanding and basis
for understanding the many pub
lic health, economic, nutritional,
social and political topics that in
tersect in our food systems.
However, at an academic insti
tution like Stanford, there is often
pushback against subjects that
seem to fall outside the tradition
al intellectual scope. When I pro
posed teaching a student-initiated
class on personal empowerment
in interdisciplinary food systems.

the first piece of advice I received
from administrators and advisors
was to cut back on the cooking
classes. Cooking may not immedi
ately appear to be an academic
pursuit, but many other practical
crafts are taught at Stanford
(think of sculpting, storytelling,
painting and farming). What's
more, if included as part of a
broader academic learning
process with consideration of the
environmental, social, economic
and political implications of our
food systems, cooking becomes a
deeply academic pursuit.
So here's a call for more cook
ing on campus. Students, faculty
and staff alike might benefit
greatly from a little more chop
ping, simmering, sauteing and stir
frying.

On the gas stove whose pilot
lights never work, oversize
pots bubble furiously
under mismatched lids. There is a
deep rumble as the overhead fan
emerges from its stupor and be
gins literally sucking air out of the
room, frantically trying to fore
stall another run-in with the fire
men. It's 15 minutes until dinner
time, and things are as they should
be in Synergy.
