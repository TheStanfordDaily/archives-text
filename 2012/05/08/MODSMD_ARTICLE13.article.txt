## Innovation in the world of sports 
### Tom Taylor 
Living in the Bay Area, it
seems that everyone has a
great idea. Everyone
dreams of leaving college
to found their own start
up and either become the next
Mark Zuckerberg or the entrepre
neur who he buys out for a billion
dollars. Most of these ambitions will
likely fail, some might succeed in
turning a healthy profit but only
a precious few will change the
world.
Even sports are not immune to
this fever, from wacky new games to
social media start-ups. It seems as if
we're introduced to a new aspect of
the game on a daily basis. So, in an
ever-changing field, which sports in
vention rises above the rest?
Maybe we should turn to the
ball, the most vital of all objects. Es
sential in the vast majority of sports,
if no one had invented the ball, the
world would be a much more boring
place. All four of America's biggest
sports wouldn't exist before
hockey fans get too excited at the
demise of baseball, basketball and
football, they should note that the
precursor to the puck was a ball
so we'd be doomed to watch
NASCAR and horse racing. How
ever important the ball is, though,
I'm going to disqualify it because I
don't quite believe that anyone can
claim intellectual property over it.
That would be like someone claim
ing they invented turning left.
So perhaps a modern item of
equipment would be a more appro
priate choice: the running shoe. Be
sides swimming, pretty much every
athletic pursuit features some type
of high-tech footwear. Just walk into
any sports shop, and you'll en
counter a wall of shoes of every
color and variety imaginable. There
are even shoes that aren't shoes but
instead gloves for your feet. They
don't just protect us from cuts and
other injuries; they also boost our
grip and acceleration.
Speaking of those injuries, we
can't ignore modem medicine and
physical therapy. It is pretty phe
nomenal how far we have come in
just the past hundred years or so. In
juries that were once debilitating
are now routinely treated. Just think
of how many professionals have
torn their ACLs and come back fit
ter and stronger. Or think of the
miraculous story of Bolton soccer
player Fabrice Muamba, who just a
few weeks ago technically died of a
heart attack, yet is still with us and
may even be able to make a come
back one day.
However, it is hard to find a sin
gle specific medical invention that
has been truly revolutionary. It is re
ally the sum of hundreds and thou
sands of steps, some big, others
small, that makes up modern medi
cine. However, forced to choose
one, the science of hydration stands
out. Until the late '6os, we complete
ly misunderstood this. It was
thought disadvantageous to drink
fluids during athletic activity and
thus was discouraged, a philosophy
that seems ridiculous in today's
sports world.
One of the most recent, key

sports technologies, evident both
because of its use in some sports
and its distinct rejection by others,
has been Hawk-Eye, This system of
cameras and computers tracks the
movement of the ball in games like
tennis and cricket, providing a high
tech check on controversial deci
sions. More over, players, referees
and fans have generally welcomed
its use. Except in soccer, where, de
spite a growing number of cases of
crucial mistakes made by officials,
FIFA has so far resisted implement
ing such a system.
My choice, though, is none of the
above. Easy to miss because it's tech
nically designed not to be seen but to
alter the way that other things are, I
pick the humble contact lens. Levels
of shortsightedness in the United
States could be as much as 40 per
cent, making it perhaps the most
widespread disability. Whereas the
other suggestions above benefit all
budding athletes, eyesight correction
takes a significant portion of the
population who would otherwise
not be able to live up to their full po
tential and removes this obstacle.
Most of the time you would
never know this, but occasionally
it's made clear when a contact lens
falling out exposes the human
frailty of a seemingly invincible pro
fessional athlete. Suddenly you re
alize that they're not that different
from you after all; until they pop the
lens back in and dash back into the
action, superpowers restored.

dollars. Most of these ambitions will
likely fail, some might succeed in
turning a healthy profit but only
a precious few will change the
world.
Even sports are not immune to
this fever, from wacky new games to
social media start-ups. It seems as if
we're introduced to a new aspect of
the game on a daily basis. So, in an
ever-changing field, which sports in
vention rises above the rest?
Maybe we should turn to the
ball, the most vital of all objects. Es
sential in the vast majority of sports,
if no one had invented the ball, the
world would be a much more boring
place. All four of America's biggest
sports wouldn't exist before
hockey fans get too excited at the
demise of baseball, basketball and
football, they should note that the
precursor to the puck was a ball
so we'd be doomed to watch
NASCAR and horse racing. How
ever important the ball is, though,
I'm going to disqualify it because I
don't quite believe that anyone can
claim intellectual property over it.
That would be like someone claim
ing they invented turning left.
So perhaps a modern item of
equipment would be a more appro
priate choice: the running shoe. Be
sides swimming, pretty much every
athletic pursuit features some type
of high-tech footwear. Just walk into
any sports shop, and you'll en
counter a wall of shoes of every
color and variety imaginable. There
are even shoes that aren't shoes but
instead gloves for your feet. They
don't just protect us from cuts and
other injuries; they also boost our
grip and acceleration.
Speaking of those injuries, we
can't ignore modem medicine and
physical therapy. It is pretty phe
nomenal how far we have come in
just the past hundred years or so. In
juries that were once debilitating
are now routinely treated. Just think
of how many professionals have
torn their ACLs and come back fit
ter and stronger. Or think of the
miraculous story of Bolton soccer
player Fabrice Muamba, who just a
few weeks ago technically died of a
heart attack, yet is still with us and
may even be able to make a come
back one day.
However, it is hard to find a sin
gle specific medical invention that
has been truly revolutionary. It is re
ally the sum of hundreds and thou
sands of steps, some big, others
small, that makes up modern medi
cine. However, forced to choose
one, the science of hydration stands
out. Until the late '6os, we complete
ly misunderstood this. It was
thought disadvantageous to drink
fluids during athletic activity and
thus was discouraged, a philosophy
that seems ridiculous in today's
sports world.
One of the most recent, key

sports technologies, evident both
because of its use in some sports
and its distinct rejection by others,
has been Hawk-Eye, This system of
cameras and computers tracks the
movement of the ball in games like
tennis and cricket, providing a high
tech check on controversial deci
sions. More over, players, referees
and fans have generally welcomed
its use. Except in soccer, where, de
spite a growing number of cases of
crucial mistakes made by officials,
FIFA has so far resisted implement
ing such a system.
My choice, though, is none of the
above. Easy to miss because it's tech
nically designed not to be seen but to
alter the way that other things are, I
pick the humble contact lens. Levels
of shortsightedness in the United
States could be as much as 40 per
cent, making it perhaps the most
widespread disability. Whereas the
other suggestions above benefit all
budding athletes, eyesight correction
takes a significant portion of the
population who would otherwise
not be able to live up to their full po
tential and removes this obstacle.
Most of the time you would
never know this, but occasionally
it's made clear when a contact lens
falling out exposes the human
frailty of a seemingly invincible pro
fessional athlete. Suddenly you re
alize that they're not that different
from you after all; until they pop the
lens back in and dash back into the
action, superpowers restored.
