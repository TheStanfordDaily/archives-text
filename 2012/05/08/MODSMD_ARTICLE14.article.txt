# SERIES SHUTOUT
## 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Heading into a three-game
home series against Washington
this past weekend, the Stanford
Softball team had lost four out of
its past five games. With the regu
lar season winding down, the
Cardinal needed to quickly find
an answer to its recent string of
losses.
And answer quickly it did.
The No. 9 Cardinal (36-16, 9-
12 Pac-12) swept the No. 14
Huskies (36-17, 7-16) in three
consecutive shutouts with scores
of 4-0, 1-0 and 10-0. The stellar
performance marks the second
time this season that Stanford
has managed to sweep a Pac-12
opponent.
Junior pitcher Teagan Gerhart

was the star player of the series,
making an appearance in all
three games. In the opener, Ger
hart's relentless effort on the
mound rewarded her with her
seventh shutout of the season.
Although she gave up six walks,
she also gave up just six hits over
seven innings. On the next day,
Gerhart came into a tight 1-0
game in the top of the seventh to
close out the Cardinal's victory. It
gave Gerhart her first save of the
season and also ensured a win for
freshman pitcher Nyree White,
whose admirable outing included
three strikeouts, one walk and no
runs allowed in six innings.
It was only fitting that Ger
hart saved her most dominant
pitching for the series finale. As
the last home game of the regular
season, the Sunday game was the

all-important Senior Day for the
Cardinal. Gerhart certainly did
n't let her senior teammates
down, pitching lights out in all
five innings at the Smith Family
Stadium. She gave up just four
hits and two walks in a win that
improved her regular season
record to 30-10.
But quality pitching wasn't
the only factor in Stanford's
dominance over Washington.
The Cardinal bats came alive in
the series, especially in game
three.
In the first game, freshman
centerfielder Cassandra
Roulund came up big for the
team, going 2-for-3 at the plate,
driving in a run and scoring an
other. Senior shortstop Ashley
Hansen also hit well, going 2-for
-4 and scoring a run.

After a quiet performance in
game two's pitching duel, the
Cardinal offense erupted in
game three. The team collective
ly hit 8-for-21, outperforming
Washington's 4-for-19 showing.
Roulund was clutch once again,
contributing to the offensive at
tack with two RBI along with two
runs scored. It seemed as if all the
players in the Stanford lineup got
a piece of the action on Senior
Day. Roulund, Hansen and jun
ior second baseman Jenna Rich
each scored two runs. In fact, all
but two players scored at least
one run in the 10-0 victory.
Roulund's outstanding offen
sive display at the plate and Ger
hart's dominant pitching on the
mound earned each player well
deserved Pac-12 accolades. Just
yesterday, Roulund was named
the Pac-12 Player of the Week,
while Gerhart was given the Pac
-12 Pitcher of the Week honors.
Counting last Tuesday's game
against Santa Clara along with
the Washington series, Roulund
has put up some gaudy statistics
in the past week. The freshman
went 6-for-10, drove in eight runs,
crossed the plate six times and
tallied an outstanding 1.100 slug
ging percentage. Meanwhile,
Gerhart added to her already im
pressive junior campaign. She al
lowed just one run over the span
of 18 innings, giving her a 0.39
ERA for last week.
A sweep over Washington was
exactly what Stanford needed
after being swept by a tough No.
4 Arizona State team just two
weekends ago. The players hope
to maintain this late season mo
mentum and carry it into the
postseason.
The Cardinal will conclude its
regular season with a three-game
series at Utah beginning this
Thursday.

Huskies (36-17, 7-16) in three
consecutive shutouts with scores
of 4-0, 1-0 and 10-0. The stellar
performance marks the second
time this season that Stanford
has managed to sweep a Pac-12
opponent.
Junior pitcher Teagan Gerhart

was the star player of the series,
making an appearance in all
three games. In the opener, Ger
hart's relentless effort on the
mound rewarded her with her
seventh shutout of the season.
Although she gave up six walks,
she also gave up just six hits over
seven innings. On the next day,
Gerhart came into a tight 1-0
game in the top of the seventh to
close out the Cardinal's victory. It
gave Gerhart her first save of the
season and also ensured a win for
freshman pitcher Nyree White,
whose admirable outing included
three strikeouts, one walk and no
runs allowed in six innings.
It was only fitting that Ger
hart saved her most dominant
pitching for the series finale. As
the last home game of the regular
season, the Sunday game was the

all-important Senior Day for the
Cardinal. Gerhart certainly did
n't let her senior teammates
down, pitching lights out in all
five innings at the Smith Family
Stadium. She gave up just four
hits and two walks in a win that
improved her regular season
record to 30-10.
But quality pitching wasn't
the only factor in Stanford's
dominance over Washington.
The Cardinal bats came alive in
the series, especially in game
three.
In the first game, freshman
centerfielder Cassandra
Roulund came up big for the
team, going 2-for-3 at the plate,
driving in a run and scoring an
other. Senior shortstop Ashley
Hansen also hit well, going 2-for
-4 and scoring a run.

After a quiet performance in
game two's pitching duel, the
Cardinal offense erupted in
game three. The team collective
ly hit 8-for-21, outperforming
Washington's 4-for-19 showing.
Roulund was clutch once again,
contributing to the offensive at
tack with two RBI along with two
runs scored. It seemed as if all the
players in the Stanford lineup got
a piece of the action on Senior
Day. Roulund, Hansen and jun
ior second baseman Jenna Rich
each scored two runs. In fact, all
but two players scored at least
one run in the 10-0 victory.
Roulund's outstanding offen
sive display at the plate and Ger
hart's dominant pitching on the
mound earned each player well
deserved Pac-12 accolades. Just
yesterday, Roulund was named
the Pac-12 Player of the Week,
while Gerhart was given the Pac
-12 Pitcher of the Week honors.
Counting last Tuesday's game
against Santa Clara along with
the Washington series, Roulund
has put up some gaudy statistics
in the past week. The freshman
went 6-for-10, drove in eight runs,
crossed the plate six times and
tallied an outstanding 1.100 slug
ging percentage. Meanwhile,
Gerhart added to her already im
pressive junior campaign. She al
lowed just one run over the span
of 18 innings, giving her a 0.39
ERA for last week.
A sweep over Washington was
exactly what Stanford needed
after being swept by a tough No.
4 Arizona State team just two
weekends ago. The players hope
to maintain this late season mo
mentum and carry it into the
postseason.
The Cardinal will conclude its
regular season with a three-game
series at Utah beginning this
Thursday.
