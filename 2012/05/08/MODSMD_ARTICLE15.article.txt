## Golfer Rodgers named Pac-12 Freshman of the Year 
### â€“ Zach Zimmerman Jack Blanchat 
Stanford men's golfer Patrick Rodgers was named
Pac-12 Freshman of the Year on Monday, marking the
third time a member of the Cardinal has won the award
and the first time since 2005. The honor tops off an out
standing campaign that included eight top-10 finishes
and two individual victories.
Rodgers, listed No. 3 in Golfweek's latest rankings,
was a highly touted recruit after a stellar high school ca
reer in Avon, Ind. Fie got off to a quick start for the Card,
finishing as the team's low scorer in all four of the fall
tournaments and posting a top-seven finish in each.
Rodgers was also named to the All-Pac-12 First Team,
joining an impressive list that includes Stanford junior
Andrew Yun and UCLA sophomore Patrick Cantlay,
who posted the best amateur score at this year's Masters.
At the Pac-12 Championships in Corvallis, Ore.,
Rodgers placed eighth with a score of 8-under, includ
ing a tournament-best mark of 65 in the third round. He
was the top finisher among conference freshmen and
second-best for Stanford, which finished sixth overall in
a disappointing showing.
Rodgers captured his first career victory back in his
first collegiate tournament in September at the
Olympia Fields/Fighting Illini Invitational, where he
shot a 4-under 206 to pace the Cardinal to a 16-shot
team victory. Rodgers was the first Cardinal golfer to
win his first college tournament since Tiger Woods ac
complished the same feat 17 years ago.
Rodgers' second career win came in April at the
Western Intercollegiate at Pasatiempo Golf Club in
Santa Cruz, Calif., where he beat Cantlay and New
Mexico State's Justin Shin by two shots.
As a result of his solid play all year long, Rodgers
was named as one of 10 semifinalists for the 2012 Ben
Hogan Award, presented annually to the nation's top
collegiate golfer. Additionally, Rodgers, along with
Yun, was named to the 2012 Palmer Cup team, a Ryder
Cup-style competition in June that matches the United
States' best college golfers against the best college
golfers from Europe.
Rodgers will be back in action from May 17 to 19
when Stanford hosts the NCAA West Regional. The
Cardinal will be the second seed in the regional, and the
field includes Pac-12 champion Cal, the top seed, and
conference foe Oregon State.
