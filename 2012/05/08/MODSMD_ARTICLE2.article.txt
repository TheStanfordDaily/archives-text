## Officials announce plan for sustainable future 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford administrators an
nounced a new sustainability plan at
Monday evening event focused most
ly on the University's past successes
in sustainability.Titled "Sustainability
3.0," the plan will guide Stanford's
sustainability efforts over the next
five to 10 years.
The full "Sustainability 3.0" plan
has not yet been released, but Pamela
Matson, dean of the School of Earth
Sciences, outlined some of the princi
ples behind the plan.

"Stanford should be the leader in
sustainability in everything we do,
and we need to lead by example,"
Matson said, outlining the first goal of
the plan.
Other goals included establishing
clear sustainability policies, bringing
together the entire Stanford commu
nity, reaching beyond Stanford for aid
and outreach and focusing on action
rather than just research.
"We need to make sure that what
we learn here through our amazing
research efforts is actually being used

here," Matson said.
The plan was introduced at the
conclusion of an event titled "Cele
brating Sustainability at Stanford,"
which brought together the leaders
of various sustainability efforts on
campus to speak about their initia
tives.
"The number one global chal
lenge that we are going to be meas
ured by over the next century or two
is going to be sustainability," said Tom
Steyer, a Stanford trustee and the
keynote speaker at the celebration.
Steyer emphasized that Stanford
needs to lead in this area, especially
with recent attention drawn to the
University.
Referring to a recent article by
Ken Auletta in The New Yorker,
Steyer said, "It's impossible to read
the recent New Yorker article and
not think that people around the
country are going to pay attention
not just to our research, but to how
we actually address the problem."
Two panels convened to share
their sustainability work. The first
presented sustainability research ini
tiatives, and the second presented
sustainability action initiatives.
Buzz Thompson, director of the
Woods Institute for the Environ
ment and a research panelist, noted
the success of the Environmental
Venture Projects program, which
awards seed grants to aid faculty re
search projects on sustainability.
Thompson said that over 350 faculty
members have submitted proposals
for the grants.
Lynn Orr, director of the Precourt
Institute for Energy, also sat on the
research panel. Orr discussed solar
cell research currently in process to
combine photovoltaic and solar ther
mal panels into double-efficiency
solar cells.
The panel also noted increasing
student interest in sustainability.
Heather Bischel M.S. 'O7 Ph.D. 'll, a
panelist representing students, said
that over the last five years, the number
of courses at Stanford that mention
sustainability in their course descrip
tion has increased from 27 to 71.
One challenge addressed in the
"Sustainability 3.0" plan was to com
pile these courses and make them
more apparent and accessible to in
terested students.
On the sustainability action
panel, speakers presented projects
currently underway to address sus
tainability problems and apply re
search findings.
Alex Luisi 'l2, president of Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford
(SSS), spoke about several of the
group's recent projects, including
creating a smartphone application to

report water leaks around campus.
Luisi also discussed how rewarding
students had found their sustainabil
ity efforts with SSS.
"If we gave them a chance to do it
again, they'd only do more," he said.
Luisi also introduced a short film
called Sustainable Trees made by
SSS members Garrett Gunther 'll
M.S. 'l2, Dominique Yahyavi 'll
M.S. 'l2, Kris Cheng 'll and Adam
Selzer M.A.'l2.The film depicts stu
dent sustainability efforts all over
campus.
Brodie Hamilton, director of
Parking and Transportation Servic
es, then showed how initiatives like
the Commute Club have helped re
duce both traffic on campus and
emissions. Hamilton said the rate of
Stanford employees driving alone to
work dropped to 46 percent in 2011
from 72 percent in 2002.
Carbon dioxide emissions on
campus have dropped below 1990
levels, according to Hamilton. Addi
tionally, the reduced traffic has
helped Stanford avoid construction
of 3,000 parking spaces.
Jack Cleary, associate vice presi
dent of Land, Buildings and Real Es
tate, discussed the methods used by
his department to plan buildings. Ac
cording to Cleary, Land, Buildings
and Real Estate aims to make build
ings that exceed green building code
performance by at least 30 percent.
The final presenter on the re
search panel was Joe Stagner, exec
utive director of Sustainability and
Energy Management. Stagner dis
cussed the upcoming Stanford En
ergy System Innovations (SESI)
project, which has the potential to
reduce emissions from water man
agement by up to 50 percent and
water use by 18 percent.
The idea behind the SESI project
is that Stanford currently has sepa
rate systems to heat and cool water.
Once contracts expire over the next
three years, the University will begin
replacing most of the water pipes
and systems across campus to com
bine the heating and cooling
processes.
The sustainability celebration
ended with Provost and Acting Pres
ident John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
summarizing Stanford sustainability
initiatives.
"In our own operations, we've
distinguished ourselves as one of the
greenest universities in the United
States," Etchemendy said. He again
emphasized action in addition to just
research, saying that other universi
ties use Stanford as a model "not be
cause we've set a goal, but because
we've taken action" to achieve the
goal.
Etchemendy also announced the
creation of a Provost's Committee
for Sustainability.

"The number one global chal
lenge that we are going to be meas
ured by over the next century or two
is going to be sustainability," said Tom
Steyer, a Stanford trustee and the
keynote speaker at the celebration.
Steyer emphasized that Stanford
needs to lead in this area, especially
with recent attention drawn to the
University.
Referring to a recent article by
Ken Auletta in The New Yorker,
Steyer said, "It's impossible to read
the recent New Yorker article and
not think that people around the
country are going to pay attention
not just to our research, but to how
we actually address the problem."
Two panels convened to share
their sustainability work. The first
presented sustainability research ini
tiatives, and the second presented
sustainability action initiatives.
Buzz Thompson, director of the
Woods Institute for the Environ
ment and a research panelist, noted
the success of the Environmental
Venture Projects program, which
awards seed grants to aid faculty re
search projects on sustainability.
Thompson said that over 350 faculty
members have submitted proposals
for the grants.
Lynn Orr, director of the Precourt
Institute for Energy, also sat on the
research panel. Orr discussed solar
cell research currently in process to
combine photovoltaic and solar ther
mal panels into double-efficiency
solar cells.
The panel also noted increasing
student interest in sustainability.
Heather Bischel M.S. 'O7 Ph.D. 'll, a
panelist representing students, said
that over the last five years, the number
of courses at Stanford that mention
sustainability in their course descrip
tion has increased from 27 to 71.
One challenge addressed in the
"Sustainability 3.0" plan was to com
pile these courses and make them
more apparent and accessible to in
terested students.
On the sustainability action
panel, speakers presented projects
currently underway to address sus
tainability problems and apply re
search findings.
Alex Luisi 'l2, president of Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford
(SSS), spoke about several of the
group's recent projects, including
creating a smartphone application to

report water leaks around campus.
Luisi also discussed how rewarding
students had found their sustainabil
ity efforts with SSS.
"If we gave them a chance to do it
again, they'd only do more," he said.
Luisi also introduced a short film
called Sustainable Trees made by
SSS members Garrett Gunther 'll
M.S. 'l2, Dominique Yahyavi 'll
M.S. 'l2, Kris Cheng 'll and Adam
Selzer M.A.'l2.The film depicts stu
dent sustainability efforts all over
campus.
Brodie Hamilton, director of
Parking and Transportation Servic
es, then showed how initiatives like
the Commute Club have helped re
duce both traffic on campus and
emissions. Hamilton said the rate of
Stanford employees driving alone to
work dropped to 46 percent in 2011
from 72 percent in 2002.
Carbon dioxide emissions on
campus have dropped below 1990
levels, according to Hamilton. Addi
tionally, the reduced traffic has
helped Stanford avoid construction
of 3,000 parking spaces.
Jack Cleary, associate vice presi
dent of Land, Buildings and Real Es
tate, discussed the methods used by
his department to plan buildings. Ac
cording to Cleary, Land, Buildings
and Real Estate aims to make build
ings that exceed green building code
performance by at least 30 percent.
The final presenter on the re
search panel was Joe Stagner, exec
utive director of Sustainability and
Energy Management. Stagner dis
cussed the upcoming Stanford En
ergy System Innovations (SESI)
project, which has the potential to
reduce emissions from water man
agement by up to 50 percent and
water use by 18 percent.
The idea behind the SESI project
is that Stanford currently has sepa
rate systems to heat and cool water.
Once contracts expire over the next
three years, the University will begin
replacing most of the water pipes
and systems across campus to com
bine the heating and cooling
processes.
The sustainability celebration
ended with Provost and Acting Pres
ident John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
summarizing Stanford sustainability
initiatives.
"In our own operations, we've
distinguished ourselves as one of the
greenest universities in the United
States," Etchemendy said. He again
emphasized action in addition to just
research, saying that other universi
ties use Stanford as a model "not be
cause we've set a goal, but because
we've taken action" to achieve the
goal.
Etchemendy also announced the
creation of a Provost's Committee
for Sustainability.

in sustainability.Titled "Sustainability
3.0," the plan will guide Stanford's
sustainability efforts over the next
five to 10 years.
The full "Sustainability 3.0" plan
has not yet been released, but Pamela
Matson, dean of the School of Earth

ples behind the plan.

"Stanford should be the leader in
sustainability in everything we do,
and we need to lead by example,"
Matson said, outlining the first goal of
the plan.
Other goals included establishing
clear sustainability policies, bringing
together the entire Stanford commu

and outreach and focusing on action
rather than just research.
