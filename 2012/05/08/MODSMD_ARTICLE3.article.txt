# New Senate to continue ARP debate tonight
## Decision on Judicial Affairs changes passed down to new Senate and Graduate Student Council 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The 14th ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate will discuss the Alter
native Review Process (ARP)
tonight at the senators' first full
length meeting in office. The pro
gram, which piloted in 2010 and
was set for review and re-ap
proval this year, provides an al
ternative judicial procedure for
cases of sexual harassment, sexu
al assault and relationship abuse.
The ARP was developed and
initiated partially in response to
Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA)
statistics that showed a dispro
portionately high rate of stu
dents who reported they had
been sexually assaulted at Stan
ford but did not have a hearing.
From 1996 to 2009, there were
104 reports of sexual assault, yet
only 3 of those cases went to
hearing, according to OJA statis
tics. After the establishment of
the ARP in April 2010, however,
there have been 21 cases report
ed, 13 transferred to ARP and 12
tried.
With the debate over ARP
reaching a critical juncture for

student legislators, The Daily has
broken down each component
that has changed since 2010 or is
currently being discussed for pro
posed changes.
Standard of proof
Before the ARP was estab
lished, all campus judicial panels,
including those reviewing cases
involving sexual assault, issued
verdicts by a standard of beyond
a reasonable doubt, the same
standard used in criminal trials.
The original charter of the ARP,
piloted in 2010, also operated
with the beyond a reasonable
doubt burden.
In April 2011, however, Presi
dent John Hennessy employed
his executive power to lower the
standard of proof to preponder
ance of evidence, which requires
that reviewers find a student re
sponsible if they believe a stu
dent to be more likely to have
committed the act than not. Pre
ponderance of evidence is the
lowest existing burden in any
type of civil, judicial or criminal
proceeding.
Hennessy's order responded
to the April 2011 Dear Colleague

Letter, issued by the Office for
Civil Rights (OCR), which ar
gued that the Supreme Court
and the OCR use a preponder
ance of evidence standard when
evaluating cases of discrimina
tion and required Universities to
do the same in cases involving
sexual assault.
Although several parties have
challenged the claims of the
Dear Colleague Letter, Stanford
would be in danger of being de
nied its Title IX funding had it
not adjusted the standard of
proof.
Currently, nearly every uni
versity, including Harvard,
Princeton, Yale and Caltech, uses
a preponderance of evidence
standard in cases involving sexu
al assault. However, the Founda
tion for Individual Rights in Ed
ucation (FIRE), a nonprofit or
ganization that opposes both the
logic and authority of the Dear
Colleague Letter and directly
recommended that the Stanford
Graduate Student Council reject
the lower standard of proof, re
ported that nine of the top 10 col
