# New Senate to continue ARP debate tonight
## Decision on Judicial Affairs changes passed down to new Senate and Graduate Student Council 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN STAFF WRITER 
The 14th ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate will discuss the Alter
native Review Process (ARP)
tonight at the senators' first full
length meeting in office. The pro
gram, which piloted in 2010 and
was set for review and re-ap
proval this year, provides an al
ternative judicial procedure for
cases of sexual harassment, sexu
al assault and relationship abuse.
The ARP was developed and
initiated partially in response to
Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA)
statistics that showed a dispro
portionately high rate of stu
dents who reported they had
been sexually assaulted at Stan
ford but did not have a hearing.
From 1996 to 2009, there were
104 reports of sexual assault, yet
only 3 of those cases went to
hearing, according to OJA statis
tics. After the establishment of
the ARP in April 2010, however,
there have been 21 cases report
ed, 13 transferred to ARP and 12
tried.
With the debate over ARP
reaching a critical juncture for

student legislators, The Daily has
broken down each component
that has changed since 2010 or is
currently being discussed for pro
posed changes.
Standard of proof
Before the ARP was estab
lished, all campus judicial panels,
including those reviewing cases
involving sexual assault, issued
verdicts by a standard of beyond
a reasonable doubt, the same
standard used in criminal trials.
The original charter of the ARP,
piloted in 2010, also operated
with the beyond a reasonable
doubt burden.
In April 2011, however, Presi
dent John Hennessy employed
his executive power to lower the
standard of proof to preponder
ance of evidence, which requires
that reviewers find a student re
sponsible if they believe a stu
dent to be more likely to have
committed the act than not. Pre
ponderance of evidence is the
lowest existing burden in any
type of civil, judicial or criminal
proceeding.
Hennessy's order responded
to the April 2011 Dear Colleague

Letter, issued by the Office for
Civil Rights (OCR), which ar
gued that the Supreme Court
and the OCR use a preponder
ance of evidence standard when
evaluating cases of discrimina
tion and required Universities to
do the same in cases involving
sexual assault.
Although several parties have
challenged the claims of the
Dear Colleague Letter, Stanford
would be in danger of being de
nied its Title IX funding had it
not adjusted the standard of
proof.
Currently, nearly every uni
versity, including Harvard,
Princeton, Yale and Caltech, uses
a preponderance of evidence
standard in cases involving sexu
al assault. However, the Founda
tion for Individual Rights in Ed
ucation (FIRE), a nonprofit or
ganization that opposes both the
logic and authority of the Dear
Colleague Letter and directly
recommended that the Stanford
Graduate Student Council reject
the lower standard of proof, re
ported that nine of the top 10 col
leges, according to U.S. World and
News Report, did not use the
OCR-mandated standard prior to
the OCR letter.
All other judicial proceedings at
Stanford are still tried by a beyond
a reasonable doubt standard.

Assumed innocence
When the ARP was altered in
2011 to lower the standard of
proof, the authors also removed
the right "to be considered inno
cent until found guilty." The corre
sponding clause in the existing
ARP says that a responding stu
dent has a right "to have the Re
viewers determine responsibility
by a preponderance of the evi
dence standard of proof."
Dan Ashton 'l4, a member of
the 13th Undergraduate Senate,
pointed out this absence and en
couraged his peers to amend the
ARP to include a presumed inno
cence protection similar to that in
the ASSU Constitution and Judi
cial Charter.

Size of review panels
Since its inception, the ARP
has decided its verdicts with four
members of the Stanford commu
nity three students and one
faulty member, distinguishing it
from all other judicial proceed
ings, which have panels of six. The
Office of Judicial Affairs said that

it altered the procedure in 2010 to
best protect the confidentiality
and comfort of both parties, to
align with student feedback con
cerning the optimal student-to
faculty reviewer ratio and to meet
more practical concerns of ensur
ing that the appropriate number
of qualified students is available at
the time of a hearing.

Voting requirement
The existing ARP requires, and
has always required, a finding of
responsibility from a simple ma
jority of reviewers to hold a stu
dent responsible, as does every
other type of judicial proceeding.
Several opponents of the loos
er procedural protections afford
ed by the Dear Colleague Letter,
including a few outgoing ASSU
Senators and students in the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs, have advo
cated for increasing the voting re
quirement to unanimity so as to
better guard against false verdicts.

Right to confront and cross-exam
ine witnesses

In all other types of judicial
hearings, and in cases involving
sexual assault before the estab
lishment of the ARP, responding
students have and had the right
"to cross-examine witnesses
against them." Within the ARP,
however, responding students do
not have the right to question im
pacted students, who often give
the most influential, if not only,
witness testimony.
Instead, responding students
can make statements to both the

investigator, who is responsible
for compiling information about
the case, and the review panel,
which makes the final decision.
These statements may refute the
allegations against the responding
student but cannot engage in the
adversarial court process.
According to the OJA, impact
ed students are not expected to
speak with the responding student
at any time during the trial process
because of the intimate and trau
matizing nature of the alleged act.

Right to have witnesses heard
The pre-ARP process, and the
judicial proceedings of all other
types of cases at Stanford, guaran
teed students the right to "call wit
nesses on their behalf at Judicial
Panel hearings." Responding stu
dents within ARP are only given
the right "to request that the In
vestigator contact individuals who
are witnesses to an event." The
new process gives the investigator
discretion to not speak with indi
viduals proffered by the respond
ing student if they so choose.
Tessa Ormenyi 'l4, a student
reviewer for ARP and coordina
tor at the Women's Community
Center, explained at the May 1
Senate meeting that the OJA has,
in the past, had responding stu
dents call numerous irrelevant
witnesses just to delay the trial.

Right to appeal & double jeop
ardy
Before the ARP was intro
duced, cases involving sexual as
sault had an appellate process

similar to other judicial hearings:
Students who felt they had been
wrongfully found responsible
could bring their case to a Final
Appeals Panel for review.
In its pilot form, the ARP
changed the process by allowing a
student found responsible to ap
peal the decision to the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs, whose
verdict was final, instead of a
panel of several members of the
OJA.

After operating this way for a
year, the ARP appellate process
changed again with the publica
tion of the Dear Colleague Letter,
which requires that Universities
shift their procedures to allow ap
peal from both sides when an un
favorable verdict is issued. This
eliminates students' right against
being tried twice for the same of
fense, known as double jeopardy.
Shortly following the publica
tion of the Dear Colleague Letter
in April 2011, President Hen
nessey amended the ARP charter
to grant equal appeal power to
both the responding and impacted
student.
Of the 12 hearings in the past
two years, 10 responding students
were found responsible, but only
one verdict was reversed in ap
peal.
A few former ASSU Senators,
notably Alon Elhanan 'l4, have
voiced opposition to the unilateral
discretion of the Vice Provost in
affirming or overruling verdicts.

Statute of limitations
Until 2008, all impacted stu

dents, including complainants of
sexual assault, were required to
have a charge filed no more than
six months after the alleged mis
conduct occurred. Any complaint
filed after the six-month statue of
limitations could not be tried
through the University judicial
process without an extraordinary
circumstance.
In January 2008, however, the
Office of Judicial Affairs extended
the statute of limitations to two
years for cases involving alleged
sexual assault, dating/domestic vi
olence, sexual harassment, stalk
ing, hate crimes or physical as
sault. This statute applies to all
cases that are heard under the
ARP.

After a series of straw poll
votes, the 13th Undergraduate
Senate declined to vote on the
ARP, leaving it to the 14th Senate
to give approval or advocate for
revisions. Since the ARP repre
sents a change to the Office of Ju
dicial Affairs charter, which oper
ates under the ASSU Constitu
tion, it must receive approval from
both the ASSU Senate and Grad
uate Student Council (GSC) be
fore it can be officially appended
to the charter. The Senate may
vote on the ARP tonight, or may
postpone the vote further.
lire pilot program of the ARP
was extended to the fall of next ac
ademic year, so it will continue to
operate pending an ASSU vote.

Graduate Student Council reject
the lower standard of proof, re
ported that nine of the top 10 col
leges, according to U.S. World and
News Report, did not use the
OCR-mandated standard prior to
the OCR letter.
All other judicial proceedings at
Stanford are still tried by a beyond
a reasonable doubt standard.

Assumed innocence
When the ARP was altered in
2011 to lower the standard of
proof, the authors also removed
the right "to be considered inno
cent until found guilty." The corre
sponding clause in the existing
ARP says that a responding stu
dent has a right "to have the Re
viewers determine responsibility
by a preponderance of the evi
dence standard of proof."
Dan Ashton 'l4, a member of
the 13th Undergraduate Senate,
pointed out this absence and en
couraged his peers to amend the
ARP to include a presumed inno
cence protection similar to that in
the ASSU Constitution and Judi
cial Charter.

Size of review panels
Since its inception, the ARP
has decided its verdicts with four
members of the Stanford commu
nity three students and one
faulty member, distinguishing it
from all other judicial proceed
ings, which have panels of six. The
Office of Judicial Affairs said that

it altered the procedure in 2010 to
best protect the confidentiality
and comfort of both parties, to
align with student feedback con
cerning the optimal student-to
faculty reviewer ratio and to meet
more practical concerns of ensur
ing that the appropriate number
of qualified students is available at
the time of a hearing.

Voting requirement
The existing ARP requires, and
has always required, a finding of
responsibility from a simple ma
jority of reviewers to hold a stu
dent responsible, as does every
other type of judicial proceeding.
Several opponents of the loos
er procedural protections afford
ed by the Dear Colleague Letter,
including a few outgoing ASSU
Senators and students in the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs, have advo
cated for increasing the voting re
quirement to unanimity so as to
better guard against false verdicts.

Right to confront and cross-exam
ine witnesses

In all other types of judicial
hearings, and in cases involving
sexual assault before the estab
lishment of the ARP, responding
students have and had the right
"to cross-examine witnesses
against them." Within the ARP,
however, responding students do
not have the right to question im
pacted students, who often give
the most influential, if not only,
witness testimony.
Instead, responding students
can make statements to both the

investigator, who is responsible
for compiling information about
the case, and the review panel,
which makes the final decision.
These statements may refute the
allegations against the responding
student but cannot engage in the
adversarial court process.
According to the OJA, impact
ed students are not expected to
speak with the responding student
at any time during the trial process
because of the intimate and trau
matizing nature of the alleged act.

Right to have witnesses heard
The pre-ARP process, and the
judicial proceedings of all other
types of cases at Stanford, guaran
teed students the right to "call wit
nesses on their behalf at Judicial
Panel hearings." Responding stu
dents within ARP are only given
the right "to request that the In
vestigator contact individuals who
are witnesses to an event." The
new process gives the investigator
discretion to not speak with indi
viduals proffered by the respond
ing student if they so choose.
Tessa Ormenyi 'l4, a student
reviewer for ARP and coordina
tor at the Women's Community
Center, explained at the May 1
Senate meeting that the OJA has,
in the past, had responding stu
dents call numerous irrelevant
witnesses just to delay the trial.

Right to appeal & double jeop
ardy
Before the ARP was intro
duced, cases involving sexual as
sault had an appellate process

similar to other judicial hearings:
Students who felt they had been
wrongfully found responsible
could bring their case to a Final
Appeals Panel for review.
In its pilot form, the ARP
changed the process by allowing a
student found responsible to ap
peal the decision to the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs, whose
verdict was final, instead of a
panel of several members of the
OJA.

After operating this way for a
year, the ARP appellate process
changed again with the publica
tion of the Dear Colleague Letter,
which requires that Universities
shift their procedures to allow ap
peal from both sides when an un
favorable verdict is issued. This
eliminates students' right against
being tried twice for the same of
fense, known as double jeopardy.
Shortly following the publica
tion of the Dear Colleague Letter
in April 2011, President Hen
nessey amended the ARP charter
to grant equal appeal power to
both the responding and impacted
student.
Of the 12 hearings in the past
two years, 10 responding students
were found responsible, but only
one verdict was reversed in ap
peal.
A few former ASSU Senators,
notably Alon Elhanan 'l4, have
voiced opposition to the unilateral
discretion of the Vice Provost in
affirming or overruling verdicts.

Statute of limitations
Until 2008, all impacted stu

dents, including complainants of
sexual assault, were required to
have a charge filed no more than
six months after the alleged mis
conduct occurred. Any complaint
filed after the six-month statue of
limitations could not be tried
through the University judicial
process without an extraordinary
circumstance.
In January 2008, however, the
Office of Judicial Affairs extended
the statute of limitations to two
years for cases involving alleged
sexual assault, dating/domestic vi
olence, sexual harassment, stalk
ing, hate crimes or physical as
sault. This statute applies to all
cases that are heard under the
ARP.

After a series of straw poll
votes, the 13th Undergraduate
Senate declined to vote on the
ARP, leaving it to the 14th Senate
to give approval or advocate for
revisions. Since the ARP repre
sents a change to the Office of Ju
dicial Affairs charter, which oper
ates under the ASSU Constitu
tion, it must receive approval from
both the ASSU Senate and Grad
uate Student Council (GSC) be
fore it can be officially appended
to the charter. The Senate may
vote on the ARP tonight, or may
postpone the vote further.
lire pilot program of the ARP
was extended to the fall of next ac
ademic year, so it will continue to
operate pending an ASSU vote.

The 14th ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate will discuss the Alter
native Review Process (ARP)
tonight at the senators' first full
length meeting in office. The pro
gram, which piloted in 2010 and
was set for review and re-ap
proval this year, provides an al
ternative judicial procedure for
cases of sexual harassment, sexu
al assault and relationship abuse.
The ARP was developed and
initiated partially in response to
Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA)
statistics that showed a dispro
portionately high rate of stu
dents who reported they had
been sexually assaulted at Stan
ford but did not have a hearing.
From 1996 to 2009, there were
104 reports of sexual assault, yet
only 3 of those cases went to
hearing, according to OJA statis
tics. After the establishment of
the ARP in April 2010, however,
there have been 21 cases report
ed, 13 transferred to ARP and 12
tried.
With the debate over ARP
reaching a critical juncture for

student legislators, The Daily has
broken down each component
that has changed since 2010 or is
currently being discussed for pro
posed changes.
Standard of proof
Before the ARP was estab
lished, all campus judicial panels,
including those reviewing cases
involving sexual assault, issued
verdicts by a standard of beyond
a reasonable doubt, the same
standard used in criminal trials.
The original charter of the ARP,
piloted in 2010, also operated
with the beyond a reasonable
doubt burden.
In April 2011, however, Presi
dent John Hennessy employed
his executive power to lower the
standard of proof to preponder
ance of evidence, which requires
that reviewers find a student re
sponsible if they believe a stu
dent to be more likely to have
committed the act than not. Pre
ponderance of evidence is the
lowest existing burden in any
type of civil, judicial or criminal
proceeding.
Hennessy's order responded
to the April 2011 Dear Colleague

Letter, issued by the Office for
Civil Rights (OCR), which ar
gued that the Supreme Court
and the OCR use a preponder
ance of evidence standard when
evaluating cases of discrimina
tion and required Universities to
do the same in cases involving
sexual assault.
Although several parties have
challenged the claims of the
Dear Colleague Letter, Stanford
would be in danger of being de
nied its Title IX funding had it
not adjusted the standard of
proof.
Currently, nearly every uni
versity, including Harvard,
Princeton, Yale and Caltech, uses
a preponderance of evidence
standard in cases involving sexu
al assault. However, the Founda
tion for Individual Rights in Ed
ucation (FIRE), a nonprofit or
ganization that opposes both the
logic and authority of the Dear
Colleague Letter and directly
recommended that the Stanford
Graduate Student Council reject
the lower standard of proof, re

Right to have witnesses heard
The pre-ARP process, and the
judicial proceedings of all other
types of cases at Stanford, guaran
teed students the right to "call wit
nesses on their behalf at Judicial
Panel hearings." Responding stu
dents within ARP are only given
the right "to request that the In
vestigator contact individuals who
are witnesses to an event." The
new process gives the investigator
discretion to not speak with indi
viduals proffered by the respond
ing student if they so choose.
Tessa Ormenyi 'l4, a student
reviewer for ARP and coordina
tor at the Women's Community
Center, explained at the May 1
Senate meeting that the OJA has,
in the past, had responding stu
dents call numerous irrelevant
witnesses just to delay the trial.

Right to appeal & double jeop
ardy
Before the ARP was intro
duced, cases involving sexual as
sault had an appellate process

similar to other judicial hearings:
Students who felt they had been
wrongfully found responsible
could bring their case to a Final
Appeals Panel for review.
In its pilot form, the ARP
changed the process by allowing a
student found responsible to ap
peal the decision to the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs, whose
verdict was final, instead of a
panel of several members of the
OJA.

After operating this way for a
year, the ARP appellate process
changed again with the publica
tion of the Dear Colleague Letter,
which requires that Universities
shift their procedures to allow ap
peal from both sides when an un
favorable verdict is issued. This
eliminates students' right against
being tried twice for the same of
fense, known as double jeopardy.
Shortly following the publica
tion of the Dear Colleague Letter
in April 2011, President Hen
nessey amended the ARP charter
to grant equal appeal power to
both the responding and impacted
student.
Of the 12 hearings in the past
two years, 10 responding students
were found responsible, but only
one verdict was reversed in ap
peal.
A few former ASSU Senators,
notably Alon Elhanan 'l4, have
voiced opposition to the unilateral
discretion of the Vice Provost in
affirming or overruling verdicts.

Statute of limitations
Until 2008, all impacted stu

dents, including complainants of
sexual assault, were required to
have a charge filed no more than
six months after the alleged mis
conduct occurred. Any complaint
filed after the six-month statue of
limitations could not be tried
through the University judicial
process without an extraordinary
circumstance.
In January 2008, however, the
Office of Judicial Affairs extended
the statute of limitations to two
years for cases involving alleged
sexual assault, dating/domestic vi
olence, sexual harassment, stalk
ing, hate crimes or physical as
sault. This statute applies to all
cases that are heard under the
ARP.

After a series of straw poll
votes, the 13th Undergraduate
Senate declined to vote on the
ARP, leaving it to the 14th Senate
to give approval or advocate for
revisions. Since the ARP repre
sents a change to the Office of Ju
dicial Affairs charter, which oper
ates under the ASSU Constitu
tion, it must receive approval from
both the ASSU Senate and Grad
uate Student Council (GSC) be
fore it can be officially appended
to the charter. The Senate may
vote on the ARP tonight, or may
postpone the vote further.
lire pilot program of the ARP
was extended to the fall of next ac
ademic year, so it will continue to
operate pending an ASSU vote.

The 14th ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate will discuss the Alter
native Review Process (ARP)
tonight at the senators' first full
length meeting in office. The pro
gram, which piloted in 2010 and
was set for review and re-ap
proval this year, provides an al
ternative judicial procedure for
cases of sexual harassment, sexu
al assault and relationship abuse.
The ARP was developed and
initiated partially in response to
Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA)
statistics that showed a dispro
portionately high rate of stu
dents who reported they had
been sexually assaulted at Stan
ford but did not have a hearing.
From 1996 to 2009, there were
104 reports of sexual assault, yet
only 3 of those cases went to
hearing, according to OJA statis
tics. After the establishment of
the ARP in April 2010, however,
there have been 21 cases report
ed, 13 transferred to ARP and 12
tried.
With the debate over ARP
reaching a critical juncture for

student legislators, The Daily has
broken down each component
that has changed since 2010 or is
currently being discussed for pro
posed changes.
Standard of proof
Before the ARP was estab
lished, all campus judicial panels,
including those reviewing cases
involving sexual assault, issued
verdicts by a standard of beyond
a reasonable doubt, the same
standard used in criminal trials.
The original charter of the ARP,
piloted in 2010, also operated
with the beyond a reasonable
doubt burden.
In April 2011, however, Presi
dent John Hennessy employed
his executive power to lower the
standard of proof to preponder
ance of evidence, which requires
that reviewers find a student re
sponsible if they believe a stu
dent to be more likely to have
committed the act than not. Pre
ponderance of evidence is the
lowest existing burden in any
type of civil, judicial or criminal
proceeding.
Hennessy's order responded
to the April 2011 Dear Colleague

Letter, issued by the Office for
Civil Rights (OCR), which ar
gued that the Supreme Court
and the OCR use a preponder
ance of evidence standard when
evaluating cases of discrimina
tion and required Universities to
do the same in cases involving
sexual assault.
Although several parties have
challenged the claims of the
Dear Colleague Letter, Stanford
would be in danger of being de
nied its Title IX funding had it
not adjusted the standard of
proof.
Currently, nearly every uni
versity, including Harvard,
Princeton, Yale and Caltech, uses
a preponderance of evidence
standard in cases involving sexu
al assault. However, the Founda
tion for Individual Rights in Ed
ucation (FIRE), a nonprofit or
ganization that opposes both the
logic and authority of the Dear
Colleague Letter and directly
recommended that the Stanford
Graduate Student Council reject
the lower standard of proof, re
ported that nine of the top 10 col
leges, according to U.S. World and
News Report, did not use the
OCR-mandated standard prior to
the OCR letter.
All other judicial proceedings at
Stanford are still tried by a beyond
a reasonable doubt standard.

Assumed innocence
When the ARP was altered in
2011 to lower the standard of
proof, the authors also removed
the right "to be considered inno
cent until found guilty." The corre
sponding clause in the existing
ARP says that a responding stu
dent has a right "to have the Re
viewers determine responsibility
by a preponderance of the evi
dence standard of proof."
Dan Ashton 'l4, a member of
the 13th Undergraduate Senate,
pointed out this absence and en
couraged his peers to amend the
ARP to include a presumed inno
cence protection similar to that in
the ASSU Constitution and Judi
cial Charter.

Size of review panels
Since its inception, the ARP
has decided its verdicts with four
members of the Stanford commu
nity three students and one
faulty member, distinguishing it
from all other judicial proceed
ings, which have panels of six. The
Office of Judicial Affairs said that

it altered the procedure in 2010 to
best protect the confidentiality
and comfort of both parties, to
align with student feedback con
cerning the optimal student-to
faculty reviewer ratio and to meet
more practical concerns of ensur
ing that the appropriate number
of qualified students is available at
the time of a hearing.

Voting requirement
The existing ARP requires, and
has always required, a finding of
responsibility from a simple ma
jority of reviewers to hold a stu
dent responsible, as does every
other type of judicial proceeding.
Several opponents of the loos
er procedural protections afford
ed by the Dear Colleague Letter,
including a few outgoing ASSU
Senators and students in the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs, have advo
cated for increasing the voting re
quirement to unanimity so as to
better guard against false verdicts.

Right to confront and cross-exam
ine witnesses

In all other types of judicial
hearings, and in cases involving
sexual assault before the estab
lishment of the ARP, responding
students have and had the right
"to cross-examine witnesses
against them." Within the ARP,
however, responding students do
not have the right to question im
pacted students, who often give
the most influential, if not only,
witness testimony.
Instead, responding students
can make statements to both the

investigator, who is responsible
for compiling information about
the case, and the review panel,
which makes the final decision.
These statements may refute the
allegations against the responding
student but cannot engage in the
adversarial court process.
According to the OJA, impact
ed students are not expected to
speak with the responding student
at any time during the trial process
because of the intimate and trau
matizing nature of the alleged act.
