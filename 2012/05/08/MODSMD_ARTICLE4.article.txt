## Frost Revival could show venue's viability 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
The May 19 Frost Revival show may
demonstrate that events at Frost Amphithe
ater are more financially and logistically vi
able, The amphitheater, which used to host
such acts as the Grateful Dead, has seen less
frequent use over the last decade, largely be
cause of the high cost to operate the venue.

Stanford Concert Network (SCN) leaders,
however, hope that the revival show can make
this year a kickstarter for future events, ac
cording to Alberto Aroeste 'l3, co-director of
SCN.
The concert will feature Modest Mouse,
with opening acts Eyes Lips Eyes and Ben
jamin Francis Leftwich. SCN Co-director
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 said the Frost Revival
broke even in under 24 hours.

"We fundraised diligently and have been
coordinating the revival for months now be
cause our vision is to bring Frost Amphithe
ater to the forefront of people's minds when
they think of our school, both at Stanford and
beyond," Aroeste wrote in an email to The
Daily.
He added that the vision of the SCN is to

expand its presence increasingly
each year so that it can create a
sustainable model of using Frost
from year to year.
Elaine Enos, executive direc
tor of the Office of Special Events
and Protocol, which works with
Frost, said that breaking even can
be complicated for the venue.
"With Frost at its current 'pic
nic' capacity for this event (a mix
of standing and sitting on blan
kets) of 5,400, it helps to have up
wards of one-third to one-half or
more in attendance with tickets
reflecting general public pricing,"
Enos wrote in an email to The
Daily.
She added that it is not a one
size-fits-all process to hit a break
even point at Frost. "The idea is to
get a band that people will pay to
see, especially at general public
prices, to help offset these expens
es as much as possible," she wrote.
Enos said that the process
often becomes complicated be
cause drawing artists of interest to
students often costs more. Organ
izers have to weigh increased cost
against increased student interest
when determining ticket prices
and projected sales.
"It deals sometimes with hav
ing to 'predict the future' in some
cases," Enos wrote.
Operating costs for Frost are
not inexpensive, according to
Enos. The cost of a high-profile

concert with a very basic design
that includes no video or lights,
and the most minimal structural
and staffing levels, runs from
about $95,000 to $150,000, not in
cluding any artist fees.
"Headliner bands of interest
and high popularity run into the
six figures pretty easily now, plus
travel expenses in many cases [can
add to the cost]," Enos wrote.
Trusheim said that a headlining
artist like Modest Mouse can cost
between $BO,OOO and $120,000 de
pending on how much they ask for
travel, food and other expenses.
She added that these bands
tend to need or want more struc
tural surroundings like lights or
stage structures, which can poten
tially raise expenses.
According to Enos, many stu
dents have expressed interested in
seeing more events in Frost. Such
interest has been expressed on
many levels throughout the un
dergraduate and graduate student
population.
"The members of the Stanford
Concert Network and other inter
ested students have spent a lot of
their personal time contributing
and developing the look and feel
that you'll see at this year's Frost
Revival," she wrote.
"We have not seen a concert of
this size in nearly 10 years," she
added. "The last time there was a
concert of any size in Frost during
the academic year with students as
the main audience was in 2006,
and the attendance was extremely
low."
Mos Def was the headliner for
the 2006 show.

Enos added that she expects to
see well over 4,000 in total atten
dance for this year's show, with the
majority being students.
Enos wrote that Frost is not just
used during Admit Weekend and
New Student Orientation. The
venue is also used for the Annual
University Diversity Spring Faire,
the GSB Students Annual C4C
event and several other dinners
and reception-style gatherings for
very large e vents that departments
or schools may sponsor.
"This year, Blackfest will be
held for the first time in the am
phitheater," Enos wrote. "The
event has been growing every
year and is expecting even more
students and general public this
year, which creates a great oppor
tunity to utilize space."
She added that future events
and other potential concerts are
being reviewed and researched,
but that it is important to be prag
matic about budgets.
"It's about making sure that a
proposed event is right for Frost as
well," she wrote, adding that some
events are better served within
smaller venues.
SCN is hopeful that it will be
able to manage these costs to
greatly expand Frost's use in the
future.
"Frost Revival will be the one
event that started it all, the one
festival that made it possible and
paved the way for future large
scale concerts at Stanford Univer
sity," Aroeste wrote.

seeing more events in Frost. Such
interest has been expressed on
many levels throughout the un
dergraduate and graduate student
population.
"The members of the Stanford
Concert Network and other inter
ested students have spent a lot of
their personal time contributing
and developing the look and feel
that you'll see at this year's Frost
Revival," she wrote.
"We have not seen a concert of
this size in nearly 10 years," she
added. "The last time there was a
concert of any size in Frost during
the academic year with students as
the main audience was in 2006,
and the attendance was extremely
low."
Mos Def was the headliner for
the 2006 show.

Enos added that she expects to
see well over 4,000 in total atten
dance for this year's show, with the
majority being students.
Enos wrote that Frost is not just
used during Admit Weekend and
New Student Orientation. The
venue is also used for the Annual
University Diversity Spring Faire,
the GSB Students Annual C4C
event and several other dinners
and reception-style gatherings for
very large e vents that departments
or schools may sponsor.
"This year, Blackfest will be
held for the first time in the am
phitheater," Enos wrote. "The
event has been growing every
year and is expecting even more
students and general public this
year, which creates a great oppor
tunity to utilize space."
She added that future events
and other potential concerts are
being reviewed and researched,
but that it is important to be prag
matic about budgets.
"It's about making sure that a
proposed event is right for Frost as
well," she wrote, adding that some
events are better served within
smaller venues.
SCN is hopeful that it will be
able to manage these costs to
greatly expand Frost's use in the
future.
"Frost Revival will be the one
event that started it all, the one
festival that made it possible and
paved the way for future large
scale concerts at Stanford Univer
sity," Aroeste wrote.

The May 19 Frost Revival show may
demonstrate that events at Frost Amphithe
ater are more financially and logistically vi
able, The amphitheater, which used to host
such acts as the Grateful Dead, has seen less
frequent use over the last decade, largely be
cause of the high cost to operate the venue.

Stanford Concert Network (SCN) leaders,
however, hope that the revival show can make
this year a kickstarter for future events, ac

expand its presence increasingly
each year so that it can create a
sustainable model of using Frost
from year to year.
Elaine Enos, executive direc
tor of the Office of Special Events
and Protocol, which works with
Frost, said that breaking even can
be complicated for the venue.
"With Frost at its current 'pic
nic' capacity for this event (a mix
of standing and sitting on blan
kets) of 5,400, it helps to have up
wards of one-third to one-half or
more in attendance with tickets
reflecting general public pricing,"
Enos wrote in an email to The
Daily.
She added that it is not a one
size-fits-all process to hit a break
even point at Frost. "The idea is to
get a band that people will pay to
see, especially at general public
prices, to help offset these expens
es as much as possible," she wrote.
Enos said that the process
often becomes complicated be
cause drawing artists of interest to
students often costs more. Organ
izers have to weigh increased cost
against increased student interest
when determining ticket prices
and projected sales.
"It deals sometimes with hav
ing to 'predict the future' in some
cases," Enos wrote.
Operating costs for Frost are
not inexpensive, according to
Enos. The cost of a high-profile

concert with a very basic design
that includes no video or lights,
and the most minimal structural
and staffing levels, runs from
about $95,000 to $150,000, not in
cluding any artist fees.
"Headliner bands of interest
and high popularity run into the
six figures pretty easily now, plus
travel expenses in many cases [can
add to the cost]," Enos wrote.
Trusheim said that a headlining
artist like Modest Mouse can cost
between $BO,OOO and $120,000 de
pending on how much they ask for
travel, food and other expenses.
She added that these bands
tend to need or want more struc
tural surroundings like lights or
stage structures, which can poten
tially raise expenses.
