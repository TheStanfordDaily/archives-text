### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Matt Bettonville

paign for Stanford Medicine on
Monday. The campaign, which
is already halfway to its goal
with pledges and expectancies,
will raise funds for a new hospi

changing health care on a na

technologies into health care to
guide medicine into the future.

"Providing the most ad
vanced health care possible to
people locally, nationally
and globally will be one of
the great challenges of this cen

Stanford Medicine draws upon
our particular strengths the
proximity of the university to its
hospitals and clinics to focus
on this issue and better serve
the public. It will allow us to
seek solutions to some of medi
cine's most daunting problems,
and it will begin in our own
community with the new Stan
ford Hospital."
