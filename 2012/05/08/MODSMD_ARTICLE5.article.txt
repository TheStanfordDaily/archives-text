## Stanford launches $1 billion medical campaign 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Matt Bettonville 
President John Hennessey
announced a $1 billion Cam
paign for Stanford Medicine on
Monday. The campaign, which
is already halfway to its goal
with pledges and expectancies,
will raise funds for a new hospi
tal and new programs aimed at
changing health care on a na
tional and global level.
The new facility will sit on
the current hospital's site in
Palo Alto, but will be update d to
meet California seismic stan
dards. Programs in the new fa
cility will try to incorporate new
technologies into health care to
guide medicine into the future.
Construction will begin on the

site in 2013.
"Providing the most ad
vanced health care possible to
people locally, nationally
and globally will be one of
the great challenges of this cen
tury," Hennessy said in a press
release. "The Campaign for
Stanford Medicine draws upon
our particular strengths the
proximity of the university to its
hospitals and clinics to focus
on this issue and better serve
the public. It will allow us to
seek solutions to some of medi
cine's most daunting problems,
and it will begin in our own
community with the new Stan
ford Hospital."
Stanford announced in Feb
ruary 2011 that companies from
Silicon Valley, including
Hewlett-Packard, Apple, eßay,
Intel, Intuit and Oracle, would
