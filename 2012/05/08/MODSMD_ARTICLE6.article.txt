## Zimbardo: Boys are struggling Professor emeritus to release e-book "The Demise of Guys" 
### AARON SEKHRI STAFF WRITER 
Philip Zimbardo, professor
emeritus of psychology and the
leader of the famous 1971 Stanford
Prison Experiment, will release a
new e-book this summer with his
personal assistant and co-author
Nikita Duncan. The book, "The
Demise of Guys: Why Boys Are
Struggling and What We Can Do
About It," argues that young men
are experiencing a decline in aca
demics, social interactions and con
centration because of changes in
the modern world.
Zimbardo said the book specifi
cally cites "the time they invest in
playing video games and watching
freely accessible Internet porn, in
the context of changing family dy
namics where there are too few
male figures to nurture them" as
distractions.
Zimbardo and Duncan's eßook
is a precursor to a print book, tenta
tively titled "Men 2.0: Rebooting
Masculinity After the Demise of
Guys," to be released next year.
In an interview with The Daily,
Zimbardo explained his thesis, the
origins of his theories and the
remedies he perceives as necessary
to solve this "systemic problem."
"I became interested in the
issue 25 years ago because of this
phenomenon I was observing on
campus where young men were
playing video games to the extent
that they were giving up the real,
face-to-face world for the virtual
world," Zimbardo said.
He cited his own son's "video
game addiction" during his time at
Stanford, which led him to delve
into the matter more deeply.
"The Demise of Guys" tackles
the problem Zimbardo explains as
"boys, worldwide, who are failing in
large numbers." Zimbardo shows
this failure in statistics: Males are 30 percent more like
ly to drop out or flunk out of school, girls outperform
boys at all levels starting in elementary school and boys
are much more likely to be taking a prescription drug
for concentration issues.
The causes for such dramatic trends are threefold,
Zimbardo argues. The first is increasing video game
playing by young men.
"The illusion of connectedness when a person is
playing a video game is no substitute for real interac
tion," he said. "Those boys that invest hours upon
hours in these pursuits are less able to socialize them
selves when it comes to real life."
The second, he said, is the accessibility of pornogra
phy.
"The incredible array of pornography that is available
to young men... [is] creating an addiction to arousal and
habituating young men to similarity," Zimbardo said.
"They are thus unable to perceive reality as it is and are
much less prepared for significant and meaningful sexual
relationships."
Zimbardo believes these two factors in combina
tion lead to the problem many young men face in de
teriorating abilities to engage in social relationships.
The third factor, he argued, is "changing family dynam
ics, where half of all young men now are growing up
without a father."
"Guys are failing, the data shows this, and because
of these factors they are unfit to learn, misfit for sexual
relationships, and they are left feeling awkward and
stupid socially, which leads to a big negative feedback
loop, where these matters simply become worse," Zim
bardo said.
He warned that the problem is only going to get
worse, and that it is not restricted to young American
men. The solutions to the issue are difficult but involve
both attacking those root causes and accommodating
for the change in behavior. Zimbardo proposed that
families monitor "time online and time with other in
dividuals, which will at least allow you to acknowledge
the problem."
Zimbardo considered suggesting mentors for
young men to "set boundaries and give motivation"
and argued for shifting away from a passive lecture
model in schools, which he sees as detrimental for
young men given their relative lack of concentration
abilities.
He paired this with an acknowledgement that "girls
are on the rise."

"Last year, women got more of every single ad
vanced degree than men around the world, which is
unheard of," Zimbardo said. Duncan chimed in, saying
women are not facing similar issues because of their
traditional social functions and the fact that they so
cialize in starkly different ways.
Zimbardo concluded with the claim that "boys'
brains are being digitally rewired for change, novelty,
excitement and constant arousal leaving them out
of sync in romantic relationships and traditional class
es."
"I'm sounding the alarm, and it's only going to get
worse," he said. "But if we start talking about it, we ac
knowledge the problem, and that we have to do some
thing about it."

loop, where these matters simply become worse," Zim
bardo said.
He warned that the problem is only going to get
worse, and that it is not restricted to young American
men. The solutions to the issue are difficult but involve
both attacking those root causes and accommodating
for the change in behavior. Zimbardo proposed that
families monitor "time online and time with other in
dividuals, which will at least allow you to acknowledge
the problem."
Zimbardo considered suggesting mentors for
young men to "set boundaries and give motivation"
and argued for shifting away from a passive lecture
model in schools, which he sees as detrimental for
young men given their relative lack of concentration
abilities.
He paired this with an acknowledgement that "girls
are on the rise."

"Last year, women got more of every single ad
vanced degree than men around the world, which is
unheard of," Zimbardo said. Duncan chimed in, saying
women are not facing similar issues because of their
traditional social functions and the fact that they so
cialize in starkly different ways.
Zimbardo concluded with the claim that "boys'
brains are being digitally rewired for change, novelty,
excitement and constant arousal leaving them out
of sync in romantic relationships and traditional class
es."
"I'm sounding the alarm, and it's only going to get
worse," he said. "But if we start talking about it, we ac
knowledge the problem, and that we have to do some
thing about it."

Professor Emeritus of Psychology Philip Zimbardo,
known for his role in the Stanford Prison Experiment,
is releasing a new book on why young men are struggling
socially and academically.
Philip Zimbardo, professor
emeritus of psychology and the
leader of the famous 1971 Stanford
Prison Experiment, will release a
new e-book this summer with his
personal assistant and co-author
Nikita Duncan. The book, "The
Demise of Guys: Why Boys Are
Struggling and What We Can Do
About It," argues that young men
are experiencing a decline in aca
demics, social interactions and con
centration because of changes in
the modern world.
Zimbardo said the book specifi
cally cites "the time they invest in
playing video games and watching
freely accessible Internet porn, in
the context of changing family dy
namics where there are too few
male figures to nurture them" as
distractions.
Zimbardo and Duncan's eßook
is a precursor to a print book, tenta
tively titled "Men 2.0: Rebooting
Masculinity After the Demise of
Guys," to be released next year.
In an interview with The Daily,
Zimbardo explained his thesis, the
origins of his theories and the
remedies he perceives as necessary
to solve this "systemic problem."
"I became interested in the
issue 25 years ago because of this
phenomenon I was observing on
campus where young men were
playing video games to the extent
that they were giving up the real,
face-to-face world for the virtual
world," Zimbardo said.
He cited his own son's "video
game addiction" during his time at
Stanford, which led him to delve
into the matter more deeply.
"The Demise of Guys" tackles
the problem Zimbardo explains as
"boys, worldwide, who are failing in
large numbers." Zimbardo shows
this failure in statistics: Males are 30 percent more like
ly to drop out or flunk out of school, girls outperform
boys at all levels starting in elementary school and boys
are much more likely to be taking a prescription drug
for concentration issues.
The causes for such dramatic trends are threefold,
Zimbardo argues. The first is increasing video game
playing by young men.
"The illusion of connectedness when a person is
playing a video game is no substitute for real interac
tion," he said. "Those boys that invest hours upon
hours in these pursuits are less able to socialize them
selves when it comes to real life."
The second, he said, is the accessibility of pornogra
phy.
"The incredible array of pornography that is available
to young men... [is] creating an addiction to arousal and
habituating young men to similarity," Zimbardo said.
"They are thus unable to perceive reality as it is and are
much less prepared for significant and meaningful sexual
relationships."
Zimbardo believes these two factors in combina
tion lead to the problem many young men face in de
teriorating abilities to engage in social relationships.
The third factor, he argued, is "changing family dynam
ics, where half of all young men now are growing up
without a father."
"Guys are failing, the data shows this, and because
of these factors they are unfit to learn, misfit for sexual
relationships, and they are left feeling awkward and
stupid socially, which leads to a big negative feedback
loop, where these matters simply become worse," Zim
bardo said.
He warned that the problem is only going to get
worse, and that it is not restricted to young American
men. The solutions to the issue are difficult but involve
both attacking those root causes and accommodating
for the change in behavior. Zimbardo proposed that
families monitor "time online and time with other in
dividuals, which will at least allow you to acknowledge
