## PROFILE NATHAN WOLFE EXTERMINATING EPIDEMICS 
### STEPHEN COBBE 
High above Sutter
Street in downtown
San Francisco, a
team of Global Viral
Forecasting Initia
tive (GVFI) scientists is hard at
work studying how the next viral
epidemic might be contained or
prevented.
From its sixth-floor office, the
group has a clear view of the
bustling city around them, a fitting
reminder of the enormous scale of
the work. Tribal artwork hangs
from the walls in the office, direct
ly across from a world map dotted
with the organization's different
field sites around the globe.
It is here that GVFI founder
and CEO, Nathan Wolfe '92, coor
dinates the organization's multi
pronged approach to combatting
epidemics. Wolfe, the Lorry I.
Lokey visiting professor in human
biology at Stanford, has received a
great deal of coverage in the media
for his work in recent years. In
2011, he was named one of Time
Magazine's 100 most influential
people in an article that called
GVFI "the CIA of infectious dis
ease." Wolfe published a book that
same year, "The Viral Storm," de
tailing his work in the context of
the historical interaction between
humans and viruses.
Wolfe left his tenured profes
sorship at UCLA in 2008 to found
GVFI and change the way scien
tists fight epidemics. In an increas
ingly globalized and interconnect
ed world, the possibilities for an
epidemic to take hold are greater
than ever before, but so are the re
sources available to stop one. The
problem Wolfe and others witness,
however, is that the current strate
gies are often more focused on re
sponding to pandemics than work
ing to avoid them in the first place.
"Not too long ago, people said
that the best way to stop a heart at
tack was to actually wait for the

heart attack to occur, then do by
pass surgery," Wolfe said. "About 10
years ago, it became clear to a small
number of us [scientists] that what
had happened in individual medi
cine, where it had become very ob
vious that an ounce of prevention
was worth a pound of cure, also
made sense on a population level."
As a boy, Wolfe was drawn into
the world of science by a particular
fascination with some of humani
ty's close relatives, the chimpanzees
and the gorillas. He remembers
watching a National Geographic
documentary that detailed the
close genetic connection between
humans and apes. This portrayal
clashed with his memories of going
to the zoo, where a clearly defined
hierarchy separated humans and
animals, often by iron bars.
"I remember the idea that by
interrogating nature and studying
it, you could fundamentally
change the way we saw the world,"
Wolfe said, reflecting on the mem
ory. Wolfe's fascination with
apes continued into his adult life,
leading him to conduct field re
search in Africa as a graduate stu
dent at Harvard. The experience
paved the way for many years of
work in the field and his future
path in virology.
During his time in the field,
Wolfe would contract malaria
three different times, the last of
which nearly killed him. It is not
hard to see why he is sometimes
known as "the Indiana Jones of
virus hunters" among profession
als in his discipline.
Through sometimes perilous
field research, Wolfe gleaned valu
able insights into some of the av
enues of transmission that viruses
can take. In particular, Wolfe recog
nized the tremendous danger of
viruses jumping from animals to
humans when local hunters pre
pared meat. Many of the viruses
that affect humans originate in ani
mals, and the interspecies leap is
rarely easier than during the close
and intimate contact of butchering.

Though monitoring such activi
ty in rural parts of Africa is often
difficult and costly, technological
innovations are allowing scientists
like Wolfe to track viruses in away
they simply could not before.
"Fifteen or 20 years ago, the best
we could do was to be able to look
at viruses that were cultured in the
laboratory," Wolfe said. "Now new
sequencing technologies allow us to
look at the sum total of genetic di
versity in a particular specimen, so
we're finding viruses that we other
wise would not [have]."
Members of Wolfe's team at
GVFI put these technologies to
use when investigating a recent
virus outbreak. They discovered a
previously unrecorded virus using
deep sequencing techniques.
Methods available even a year or
two ago would have completely
missed the virus, due to its low con
centration in the samples studied.
The group plans to publish these
findings in the coming months.
A critical part of fighting epi
demics is simply identifying a given
virus, which can offer insights into
how quickly the virus will spread,
how deadly it might be and what
response is appropriate in order to
contain it. For example, the human
immunodeficiency virus (F1IV),
the virus responsible for acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS), went unidentified and un
treated for decades in human pop
ulations. Wolfe called this "a stun
ning failure in human health serv
ices." In order to prevent this from
happening again, GVFI has innov
atively used local hunters in Africa
to collect dried blood samples of
their kills, which are later sent to
labs for analysis.
In the years since Wolfe began
working on preventing epidemics,
a growing recognition has
emerged in governments and or
ganizations around the world
about the need to adopt a more
proactive approach to combatting
viruses, especially in places where
viruses are easily transmitted from

animals to humans.
"It's exciting for me because
now there are a number of young
organizations that are starting to
do this work, and it's becoming
more of an ecosystem where folks
are approaching different angles
about how to address these prob
lems," Wolfe said.
Wolfe also noted the impor
tance of more traditional struc
tures like the World Health Organ
ization (WHO) and the Center for
Disease Control (CDC), both of
which GVFI regularly coordinates
with as part of the WHO Global
Outbreak Alert and Response
Network. But Wolfe believes the
old model is rapidly disappearing.
"Scientists in those [traditional]
institutions recognize that they
have a lot of limitations in terms of
their mission, in terms of their
funding and in terms of their abili
ty to move quickly," Wolfe said. "I
think it's clear to all of us now that
the world in five or 10 years is
going to look a lot different than it
does now in terms of the kinds of
structures out there,"
Though GVFI now has staff
working in six different African
and Asian countries, Wolfe plays
more than just the role of adminis
trator as CEO. He still regularly
goes out into the field to conduct
research and is closely involved in
the collaborative analysis of the
viruses. Wolfe also brainstorms di
rectly with many of GVFI's local
scientists in Africa, Asia and else
where around the world about the
best approaches to engaging with
the local populations.
Under Wolfe's guidance, GVFI
has expanded into a number of di
verse areas for tracking viruses.
Wolfe's background makes him
well suited for this kind of innova
tion, as he sees a parallel between
his undergraduate education in
human biology (Humßio) at Stan
ford and the company's interdisci
plinary and collaborative ap
proach to problem solving.
"We work with computer scien
tists, a lot of virologists, a number of
epidemiologists, and one of my
team members is a medical anthro
pologist," Wolfe said. "The way my
career has worked out is fundamen
tally 'Humßio' in a sense. It's just,
pick a problem and pick whatever
sorts of disciplines are necessary to
effectively address the problem."
Over the past couple of years,
GVFI has also pursued the bur
geoning field of digital epidemiol
ogy. Tapping into the massive

amounts of data available through
the Internet, digital epidemiology
allows scientists to forecast trends
in illness without ever leaving the
laboratory. For example, epidemi
ologists are exploiting the online
availability of over-the-counter
drug sales records to make short
term predictions about sickness,
according to The Atlantic.
On Wolfe's team, Stephanie
Nevins 'll, a GVFI intern and
Wolfe's former student, is current
ly exploring data mining tech
niques for extracting information
from social networks to plot trends
in epidemics.
During her senior spring at
Stanford, Nevins took Wolfe's
Viral Lifestyles seminar. For the
class, she worked on a project that
eventually turned into a formal
business plan to overhaul the way
patients interface with their med
ical provider, which attracted
Wolfe's attention.
"In his class, we really asked big
questions about how we can
change the way we think about
public health," Nevins recalled. "It
was so interesting to realize that
you could study disease in popula
tions in high-risk places and actual
ly have the ability to stop them be
fore they spread."
Wolfe is also able to balance
this broader view with a sense of
pragmatism in his teaching.
"He is one of the most ap
proachable, thought-provoking
professors I have interacted with at
Stanford," said Kasey Kissick 'l2,
who also took the seminar. "He
teaches in a very practical manner,
leaving students with a sense of
guidance and direction, rather
than just a collection of abstract
concepts and facts."
Toward the end of "The Viral
Storm," Wolfe writes about the ne
cessity of establishing a 24-hour
"situation room" as a command
and control center for preventing
epidemics.The organization would
employ the innovative manage
ment of a Silicon Valley start-up to
do a variety of tasks, such as sorting
massive amounts of data, main
taining regular contact with global
health leaders and using a series of
field sites to monitor the situation
on the ground.
While Wolfe writes that no such
situation room exists today, the of
fice above Sutter Street doesn't ap
pear far from his vision.
