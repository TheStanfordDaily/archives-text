## OP-ED Perspective on"Responding to Campus Crisis" 
### JULIE KENNEDY Professor (Teaching), Environmental Earth System Science Faculty Co-Director, Haas Center for Public Service 
I read last Monday's article
about a recent campus suicide
and another student's death
with a heavy heart. When death or
severe illness comes to those who
are young it feels especially tragic.
Every life is precious, but the
weight of the news is heavier
when a young life is involved. Al
though I did not know either stu
dent, I felt that added weight
while reading "Responding to
Campus Crisis" (April 30) about
the deaths of Sam Wopat and
Cady Hine, Admittedly I am par
ticularly vulnerable right now. A
young woman who has been dear
to me since her birth has been in
an intensive care unit for the past
three weeks after contracting bac
terial meningitis in her freshman
year at another university. It
breaks my heart that she is criti
cally sick and that there is nothing
I can do; it pains me to not know
the details of her status. But it has
been her parents' choice to share
information sparingly. They are
dealing with more than any par
ent should have to deal with right
now. They can't give more than
they are giving, including the
retelling of emotionally painful
medical updates. And so I don't
ask. What they want friends to
know, they will eventually share.
For now, we send them uncondi
tional love rather than looking for
what they could be providing to
us. It's not about us.
I found parallels between my
current emotional roller coaster
and the comments recapped in
last Monday's Daily article. In
conveying information about a
student death or illness, the Uni
versity has a clear position: We
defer to the right to privacy of
those most affected, namely the
student or the student's family. As
community members, under
standably, we want to know when
something has happened to one of
our own. Knowing the details
helps us to feel as though we have
some control over a crisis, even
when logic tells us that events are
outside of our control. For stu
dents, the Deans of Red Ed and
Student Life, leaders at CAPS,
Resident Fellows, the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs and
Resident Assistants (RAs) can
offer support, but they cannot al
ways provide the information stu
dents seek. Sometimes we have to
accept that detailed information
won't be forthcoming. First and
foremost it is about the family. It's
not about us.
I do not mean to suggest that
students have no agency in the

discussion of tragic campus
events. We are a community
clearly you do. Rather, I am stat
ing that you don't always have pri
macy. At Stanford we try to create
living and learning environments
that are about you. We condition
you to expect primacy and try to
live up to that expectation. But in
responding to life's challenges we
must remind ourselves of the dif
ference between these two â€”in
one situation we may have a right
to full information, but under dif
ferent circumstances others may
have an overriding right or re
sponsibility to withhold it from us.
During this past crisis, others
weighed the balance between
softening student concern by pro
viding information and protecting
the privacy of those closest to the
tragedy. They correctly chose the
latter.
Monday's article poignantly
conveyed the frustration that
some students, particularly RAs,
felt with the University's crisis re
sponse. In building support sys
tems for our dorm communities,
the University trains RAs in the
methods of QPR or Question,
Persuade, Refer, which addresses
the difficult topic of suicide. Per
haps in this case the QPR training
was not sufficient, as the RAs
close to the tragedy expressed
concern with their ability to confi
dently respond in a time of crisis.
The community, including the
Student Mental Health and Well
Being Oversight Committee of
which I am a member, is already
learning from their frustration.
What we learn may not signifi
cantly alter what the University
can communicate in a crisis, but
hopefully through this discussion
we will find ways to increase stu
dent agency and deepen RA
training.
My heart goes out to those who
have lost a friend. It also goes out
to those who wanted to offer com
fort and guidance to others, but
felt constrained or otherwise un
able to do so. What we can give to
the memory of the women we
have lost in recent weeks is a will
ingness to talk openly about de
pression, suicide and sudden
death. We can learn how to sup
port each other more effectively,
while never losing sight of our re
sponsibility to protect the privacy
of those most affected.
