Life at the Frontier:
Human Identity and the Conversational Nature of Reality
Thursday, May 10

CEMEX Auditorium,
Knight Management Center
Stanford University
Free and open to the public
The truth is not the truth until it can be heard and recognized,
no matter how well it is said, and one of the difficult truths is
that human beings arrive at newness, revelation, and understanding
through recognition of something already established within
them. To tell the truth, therefore, is not to fire off the right
ammunition at an established target, but rather to create a live
frontier, a field of communion, between a deep internal core
and something that, to begin with, looks like the otherness of the
world. Living and breathing at this frontier is what most of our
religious and contemplative traditions have called enlightenment
Join poet and philosopher David Whyte for what is sure to be
an enlightening experience of this frontier through poetry, the
imagination at play, and storytelling. His most recent books
include: The Three Marriages, River Flow, and Crossing the
Unknown Sea.
