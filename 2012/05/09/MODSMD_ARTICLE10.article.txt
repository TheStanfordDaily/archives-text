## EDITORIAL More art in our homes 
### 
There is no doubt that Stan
ford students are talented.
We excel in a variety of
fields, from academics to athletics
to public service. One area where
students display their ability is in
the arts. Stanford has its share of
students who major in the arts,
whether it is Music or Drama or
Studio Art, and these students
produce tremendous work. In ad
dition to those formally studying
art, however, there are countless
Stanford students who produce
art as a passion on the side. Anoth
er unique aspect of this university
that the Editorial Board has
touched upon before is the guar
anteed availability of on-campus
housing for all four years. Never
theless, there is very little student
artwork presented in common
areas in dorms or houses across
campus. Given this combination,
the Editorial Board wonders why
we do not see more student art
work in Stanford's housing.
Artwork goes a long way to
ward transforming a residence into
a home: Witness dorm theme deco
rations, particularly for freshmen
who are making the transition to
their new living environments, or
even students' choices of which
posters or photos to put up in their
rooms. More artwork in common
living spaces would give students
more ownership over the space
that they call home and showcase
the plentiful talent that we have on
campus. In fact, knowing that they
could contribute to their living
space might even encourage more
students to pick up the paintbrush
or camera that they have not
touched since high school.
This is not to say that Stanford
does nothing in this arena. Dorms
are often well decorated by com
mitted student staff members, and
pianos and open mic nights in
dorms across campus bring art in
the form of music to the communi
ty. The Student Art Spots in many
dorms and public spaces are a good
first step toward better showcasing

students' efforts in other types of
art. But these spaces are underuti
lized, and it would seem that many
students don't realize they can dis
play their art or don't know how to
go about doing so. Furthermore,
the way that these spaces are set up
tends to limit displays to smaller
pieces of sculpture, ceramics, paint
ing, or photography.
Stanford could do more.
Events similar to Art After Dark,
which is Stanford's largest student
arts festival, could be held in
dorms or houses across campus to
showcase more types of art in
teractive or performance art, de
sign work, larger sculptures in ad
dition to the smaller pieces al
ready present in residential
spaces. Murals are another way to
showcase student talent and build
community. The murals in Casa
Zapata are more than just art
work; they remind diners every
day of that community's pride and
its struggles. Currently, permission
is only sparingly granted for mu
rals, limiting students' ability to ex
press themselves and make the
space their own. Coordinating
with the Stanford Institute for
Creativity and the Arts (SiCa),
which does a lot of work in pro
moting art of all types on campus,
would be a good place to start.
There is no doubt that Stanford
is committed to the arts, what with
the world-class Cantor Center
and new Bing Concert Hall.There
is also no doubt that students
themselves are committed to the
arts. What is needed is for Stanford
to show its students that it values
their contributions in this arena by
committing to more student art
and more varied student art show
cased in living spaces across cam
pus. Administrators like Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Edu
cation Harry Elam have spoken of
making the arts "inescapable" on
campus. What better way to make
them inescapable than to have
student art throughout the resi
dences?

even students' choices of which
posters or photos to put up in their
rooms. More artwork in common
living spaces would give students
more ownership over the space
that they call home and showcase
the plentiful talent that we have on
campus. In fact, knowing that they
could contribute to their living
space might even encourage more
students to pick up the paintbrush
or camera that they have not
touched since high school.
This is not to say that Stanford
does nothing in this arena. Dorms
are often well decorated by com
mitted student staff members, and
pianos and open mic nights in
dorms across campus bring art in
the form of music to the communi
ty. The Student Art Spots in many
dorms and public spaces are a good
first step toward better showcasing

students' efforts in other types of
art. But these spaces are underuti
lized, and it would seem that many
students don't realize they can dis
play their art or don't know how to
go about doing so. Furthermore,
the way that these spaces are set up
tends to limit displays to smaller
pieces of sculpture, ceramics, paint
ing, or photography.
Stanford could do more.
Events similar to Art After Dark,
which is Stanford's largest student
arts festival, could be held in
dorms or houses across campus to
showcase more types of art in
teractive or performance art, de
sign work, larger sculptures in ad
dition to the smaller pieces al
ready present in residential
spaces. Murals are another way to
showcase student talent and build
community. The murals in Casa
Zapata are more than just art
work; they remind diners every
day of that community's pride and
its struggles. Currently, permission
is only sparingly granted for mu
rals, limiting students' ability to ex
press themselves and make the
space their own. Coordinating
with the Stanford Institute for
Creativity and the Arts (SiCa),
which does a lot of work in pro
moting art of all types on campus,
would be a good place to start.
There is no doubt that Stanford
is committed to the arts, what with
the world-class Cantor Center
and new Bing Concert Hall.There
is also no doubt that students
themselves are committed to the
arts. What is needed is for Stanford
to show its students that it values
their contributions in this arena by
committing to more student art
and more varied student art show
cased in living spaces across cam
pus. Administrators like Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Edu
cation Harry Elam have spoken of
making the arts "inescapable" on
campus. What better way to make
them inescapable than to have
student art throughout the resi
dences?
