# RAVALATIONS
## It's the simple things in life 
### Ravali Reddy 
r I ill is Monday, sometime in the
late afternoon, something
A. happened that sent shock
waves throughout the entire cam
pus: The Stanford Wi-Fi went down.
I was on the phone when it hap
pened, talking to a friend about a class
when I attempted to go on Course
work and pull up some notes. My Web
browser wouldn't load and I had to ask
my friend to pause for a second. At
first, I thought it was just my computer
acting up again, but a few moments
later, my roommate chimed in and
said her Internet was down, and on the
line, my friend mentioned that hers
was too. We decided to come back to
our conversation later and after hang
ing up, I found myself staring at my
computer, unsure of what to do.
Without the Wi-Fi, I couldn't
check my email; I couldn't continue
watching the videotaped lectures I
had been reviewing to study for my
midterm, and I couldn't even pro
crastinate properly since there was
no way for me to access Netflix. So, I
did something I haven't really had
the chance to do in a long time: I
picked up a book one that wasn't
a textbook, one that wasn't as
signed, and one that I had wanted to
get around to for a while.
Now, I've spent my whole life
loving books. My parents have
countless photos and videos of me
combing through books (and play
ing with them when I was too young
to know what words were), and my
tattered copy of the first book I have
ever owned (Dr. Seuss's The Foot
Book) is still sitting in my house.
Reading is how I spent countless
hours in elementary, middle and
high school, but as I sat there thumb
ing through the book that I picked
up on Monday afternoon, I realized
how few books I had read since I en
rolled at Stanford.
Sure, I have read plenty of books
for class (and skimmed through
even more thanks to IFIUM), and
my affinity for newspapers has gone
way up since I started college, since

as a communication major I am ex
pected to keep up to date with
things. But picking up books for fun
had become a thing of the past for
me. I found myself constantly saying
that I would get around to reading
eventually. I told myself I would
read over breaks, that I'd catch up
on every book I had been meaning
to read over the summer, that I just
didn't have the time to read for fun
and that the time I do have to read
should all be spent reading things
for class.
But on Monday, I realized that it
took the Wi-Fi being down to make
me see that I had been making ex
cuses when it came to my reading. I
could have easily been using all the
study breaks that I spent watching
television shows to read a chapter
from my book instead. For some
reason, it was just something that I
had never thought about before,
and after talking to some of my
friends, I realized that pleasure
reading was something that a lot of
people have given up since coming
to Stanford.
It's crazy that the little things that
used to make us so happy are the
first things to go once we get too
busy. It's easy to make excuses, but
it's important to realize that it's just
as easy to fit the simple things back
into your life. So whether it's read
ing, tossing a Frisbee or taking a nap
out in the great spring quarter
weather, it's time to make time for
the little things. After all, with only a
month left in the school year, there's
no time better than the present.
