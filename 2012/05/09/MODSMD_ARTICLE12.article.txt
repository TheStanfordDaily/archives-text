# BURSTING THE BUBBLE
## Where's our sand? 
### Edward Ngai 
Sometime between Thanksgiv
ing break and the Christmas
holidays, the jackhammering
began on what was the parking lot
between Wilbur and Stern.
Work began each weekday
morning at 7:30, much to the cha
grin of east-facing Stern residents
(myself included). Trucks rolled in,
beeped in reverse, then rolled out.
Yeah, we complained about it,
but isn't it all worth it now? Every
Friday, rubber pellets may just as
well be grains of sand, as (mostly)
underclassmen lay about in their
swimsuits to welcome the weekend.
It was a long process, but every
one seems happy now. Don't like
turf? Wilbur Field is three steps
away. New basketball courts are
popular, judging from the sounds
of the balls bouncing into the wee
hours of the morning. It seems
everyone's happy these days.
Except my baseball-cap bear
ing, bro-tank clad, longboard
("shortboard!" he insists) riding,
guitar-playing, Facebook-reject
ing, California hipster of a room
mate. The most laid-back guy in

Burbank. Whatever could draw his
ire?
That circular asphalt pit on Es
condido that was surely intended,
months ago, to be two beach vol
leyball courts.
"They were rushing to get it
done before Parents' Weekend,"
he conjectures. "And the day be
fore Parents' Weekend they pulled
all their resources, drove all the
trucks away, and haven't done any
thing since."
I asked him how he was sure.
"It's a safe assumption, dude."
He's an expert, you see.
This from a Santa Barbara kid
who grew up on the beaches. At
the beginning of construction in
December, he was stoked. More
stoked than usual, which is kind of
difficult cause he's always stoked
on something. "It'll be done before
spring quarter," he assured me.
And as suddenly and frenetical
ly as everything else was built, con
struction on the courts was aban
doned.
Everything's done. There's an
elevated storm drain that needs

some work, but all the courts need
is a dump truck filled with sand
and some nets. Instead, for two
months it's been a big pit sur
rounded by litter Gatorade
bottles on weekdays, Coronas on
weekends.
It's unseemly, especially in con
trast to the beautifully manicured
Wilbur Field, or the beautifully
low-maintenance turf field. And
considering the entire project
the field, the picnic tables, the bas
ketball courts, the paving is
complete except for the sand in the
volleyball courts, it's about time a
dump truck came and completed
the job. Let's add the unmistakable
barking of volleyball players to the
summertime sounds of bouncing
basketballs and baseballs hitting
leather.
Just a little sand, please, and let
the kids play.
