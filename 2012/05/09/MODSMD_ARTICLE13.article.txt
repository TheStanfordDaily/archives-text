## Making a case for Oliver Luck 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Breaking up is
never easy. As
former athletic
director Bob
Bowlsby moves on to
(arguably) greener pas-

tures by becoming com
missioner of the Big 12, Stanford is now tasked with filling the
hole in its heart left by one of the most successful people to ever
hold the position.
It's going to be nearly impossible to duplicate his impact in
the short term â€”lO national titles in six years is about as un
matchable as it gets and although things could surely be
worse, he's not necessarily leaving the throne at the best time.
Bowlsby's successor will inherit several big-money teams in
states of serious transition. The departure of Andrew Luck, un
certainty at the quarterback position and questionable calls
made by new head coach David Shaw in Glendale this past Jan
uary loom over a program fresh off of two consecutive trips to
BCS bowls. The Stanford women's basketball team, which has
battled its way to five straight Final Fours, will have to find away
to deal with the loss of all-time great Nnemkadi Ogwumike, who
was taken with the No. 1 pick in this year's WNBA draft. And al
though momentum from an NTT championship is a positive
sign, men's hoops still hasn't made an NCAA tournament in
Johnny Dawkins' four-year tenure.
Other sports have also trended downward since the turn of
the decade, and their struggles may need to be reevaluated soon
er than expected. Suffice it to say that the Department of Ath
letics could face some adversity in the coming year. One hun
dred and two national championships and 17 straight Directors'
Cups are powerful indicators of prominence that could be lost
without proper leadership.
Additionally, Bowlsby was instrumental in keeping the Ath
letics Department (which lacks in SEC-type boosterism) well
funded through the robust Pac-12 television deal. That sort of
business savvy is rare in today's NCAA, especially when main
taining a program as clean and uncontroversial as Stanford's.
This by no means is a decision that the administration can af
ford to rush to choose his successor. There have been rumors
swirling over which direction University officials will choose to
go, with certain names, including Condoleezza Rice, appearing
on more than one occasion. Although Rice's affiliation with the
school and her undying passion for the athletics program are
well documented, her lack of experience on the business side of
college sports leaves me worried.
Enter Oliver Luck, Andrew Luck's father and the current
West Virginia athletic director. His connections to Stanford are
purely through his children, with women's volleyball player
Mary Ellen joining her brother on the Farm in the fall of 2010,
but his credentials match perfectly with the most successful pro
gram in the nation. Having served as president of NFL Europe
and president and general manager of Major League Soccer's
Houston Dynamo, in addition to his current role with the Moun
taineers, Oliver Luck is undoubtedly well versed in the job's re
sponsibilities. He helped to quickly rescue a West Virginia foot
ball program that was desperate to move past the fiasco of for
mer head coach Rich Rodriguez leaving for Michigan and is
widely respected as one of the country's premier athletic heads.
There is no question that Stanford hasn't at least tested the
waters with Luck in the few days since Bowlsby's appointment.
Oliver Luck knows he's on the short list of candidates.The prob
lem is drawing the former Republican Congressional nominee
away from his home state of West Virginia and away from the
high status of his current position. The present state of West Vir
ginia athletics is one that he should be proud of (the Moun
taineers romped Clemson,7o-33, in the Orange Bowl this year),
and a quick glance at the West Virginia message boards suggests
that supporters are well aware of his aptitude.
However, West Virginia is embroiled in the dramatic confer
ence realignment and just settled a nasty divorce with the Big
East in favor of the Big 12. That switch will be financially bene
ficial and bring the Mountaineers stiffer competition and better
ratings, but rarely does a school hop into a new league without
initial growing pains.
If there's any indication that Luck will at least think about the
job, it's that he declined to comment on the Stanford opening
but flat out rejected consideration for Big 12 commissioner last
week, the spot now filled by Bowlsby. At Stanford, Luck would
find an athletics department that boasts success in many differ
ent sports and is situated in a wealthy and stable conference.
It's obvious what Stanford has to offer: a private university
setting, less media pressure, annual team championships, nation
al respect and the like. The question is whether that is enough to
bring a third Luck to Stanford and continue the family's
charmed run in Palo Alto.
Although it's a long shot, the Athletics Department would be
amiss to not make a strong play for the most beloved football
dad in the school's history.

Zach Zimmerman just wants another decade to make "Luck"
puns. Shoot him your favorites at zachz@stanford.edu or fol
