### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Junior Stephen Piscotty was named a preseason Ail-
American for his hitting talents, but even though he leads
the No. 17 Stanford baseball team with 50 RBI good for
No. 24 in the nation some of his biggest contributions re
cently have been on the mound. A third baseman and left
fielder by trade, Piscotty pitched two innings as a freshman
and has become one of the Cardinal's most reliable reliev
ers over the last month. He recently spoke with The Daily
about his additional pitching responsibilities and how Stan
ford (29-14,11-10 Pac-12) hopes to secure its postseason po
sitioning with just three weeks left in the season.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You just threw 83 pitches over a
career-high 4.2 innings at Oregon State [on Sunday], How's
your arm feeling?
Stephen Piscotty (SP): A little sore. My whole body's a little
sore, but it's good soreness. It's not pain or anything, it's just
what is expected, but I'm definitely a little tired.
TSD: Did you expect to be pitching this much coming into
this season, and what conversations did you have with the
coaching staff that led to you becoming one of this team's
go-to relievers?
SP: I mean, I pitched a couple of innings my freshman year
so they knew I could do it. I just wanted to help the team any
way I could. I threw in fall practice and did okay, and told
them that if they needed me during the season, I had no
problem throwing.
They started with me in there playing a position, but I
took the opportunities when they came. They said they
wanted to [put me on the mound], so I said, "Okay, let's do
it." And that's kind of been the story of the year so far.
TSD: With the designated hitter, not many college pitchers
are responsible for contributing at the plate. When you have
to deal with a high-pressure situation on the mound and
then have to come back out and get on base yourself in the
next half of the inning, how do you stay focused?
SP: It's interesting. When you finish one role you really have
to kind of slow yourself down, stop and think, "Okay, I've got
to go hit." You definitely have to put your mind in check to
remember that you need to do both, and you need to do
both successfully. Hopefully I'm learning to do that. I don't
want to say I've mastered that because I haven't been doing
it that long.
It's more of a mentality thing rather than a physical one.
I know the pitching mechanics from throwing before, and I

know the hitting mechanics. I know how to throw, it's just a
matter of mentally being able to execute flipping back from
one to the other.
TSD: Besides just your time on the mound, you also made
the recent transition from third base to left field, where you
played about half of your freshman season. How do you
think that's been working out, given some of your fielding
struggles early in the year?
SP: The transition has helped get a good bat in the lineup, in
[freshman third baseman] Alex Blandino. Situations oc
curred that landed me in left field, and that's what coach
needed from me. I'm a guy to respect whatever decision the
coach makes. I'm happy in left field, I enjoy running around
in the outfield and getting to show off my arm a little bit. To
me, hitting is the most important thing and anything I can
contribute on defense I'm happy to do, whatever position
I'm at.
TSD: After Lonnie Kauppila went down with his injury, the
infield was retooled a bit with some younger players, guys
like Blandino and [sophomore second baseman] Brett
Michael Doran, getting in regularly. What have you thought
of their efforts?
SP: I think they've done a phenomenal job. They've been re
ally consistent on defense, and both have had really good at
bats. Obviously, Blandino, with the six home runs to start his
season, did really well, and Doran is a tough out. They've re
ally stepped up, and that's all you can ask for from guys like
that who weren't in the lineup every day: just to jump right
in and start producing. It's a very good thing for our team
and they've been the reason for a lot of our success.
TSD: In conference play, this team is pretty much in the
same position it was last year, with about a .500 record
through 20 games and sitting in fifth in the Pac-12. How do
you duplicate your strong finish a year ago, when you won
four of your last five conference games?
SP: This is crunch time, and our whole team knows that. I
think the mentality is that we need to win every game down
the stretch here in order to put ourselves in a good position.
We went on the road last year to North Carolina [for the
Super Regional], and we know how tough it is to win on the
road. These games are kind of in preparation, to make that a
little easier on us. It's important in getting us to Omaha, so
we know that every game from now on is an absolute must
win.
TSD: You now have only three weeks to make up 3.5 games
on conference leader Oregon. Is winning the conference still
seen as a viable goal, and what are you going to have to do
to avoid another series loss like the one you sustained this
weekend?
SP: I think it's taking each game one at a time, just knowing
that the Pac-12 title is important but it's not as important as
getting to Omaha. That's the goal: winning a national cham
pionship. It's always been the goal to get there. We're not so
much concerned with catching Oregon and Arizona as we
are with getting ourselves in good position for the postsea
son to make a run at it, have some fun and hopefully get to
Omaha.

this season, and what conversations did you have with the
coaching staff that led to you becoming one of this team's
go-to relievers?
SP: I mean, I pitched a couple of innings my freshman year
so they knew I could do it. I just wanted to help the team any
way I could. I threw in fall practice and did okay, and told
them that if they needed me during the season, I had no
problem throwing.
They started with me in there playing a position, but I
took the opportunities when they came. They said they
wanted to [put me on the mound], so I said, "Okay, let's do
it." And that's kind of been the story of the year so far.
TSD: With the designated hitter, not many college pitchers
are responsible for contributing at the plate. When you have
to deal with a high-pressure situation on the mound and
then have to come back out and get on base yourself in the
next half of the inning, how do you stay focused?
SP: It's interesting. When you finish one role you really have
to kind of slow yourself down, stop and think, "Okay, I've got
to go hit." You definitely have to put your mind in check to
remember that you need to do both, and you need to do
both successfully. Hopefully I'm learning to do that. I don't
want to say I've mastered that because I haven't been doing
it that long.
It's more of a mentality thing rather than a physical one.
I know the pitching mechanics from throwing before, and I

know the hitting mechanics. I know how to throw, it's just a
matter of mentally being able to execute flipping back from
one to the other.
TSD: Besides just your time on the mound, you also made
the recent transition from third base to left field, where you
played about half of your freshman season. How do you
think that's been working out, given some of your fielding
struggles early in the year?
SP: The transition has helped get a good bat in the lineup, in
[freshman third baseman] Alex Blandino. Situations oc
curred that landed me in left field, and that's what coach
needed from me. I'm a guy to respect whatever decision the
coach makes. I'm happy in left field, I enjoy running around
in the outfield and getting to show off my arm a little bit. To
me, hitting is the most important thing and anything I can
contribute on defense I'm happy to do, whatever position
I'm at.
TSD: After Lonnie Kauppila went down with his injury, the
infield was retooled a bit with some younger players, guys
like Blandino and [sophomore second baseman] Brett
Michael Doran, getting in regularly. What have you thought
of their efforts?
SP: I think they've done a phenomenal job. They've been re
ally consistent on defense, and both have had really good at
bats. Obviously, Blandino, with the six home runs to start his
season, did really well, and Doran is a tough out. They've re
ally stepped up, and that's all you can ask for from guys like
that who weren't in the lineup every day: just to jump right
in and start producing. It's a very good thing for our team
and they've been the reason for a lot of our success.
TSD: In conference play, this team is pretty much in the
same position it was last year, with about a .500 record
through 20 games and sitting in fifth in the Pac-12. How do
you duplicate your strong finish a year ago, when you won
four of your last five conference games?
SP: This is crunch time, and our whole team knows that. I
think the mentality is that we need to win every game down
the stretch here in order to put ourselves in a good position.
We went on the road last year to North Carolina [for the
Super Regional], and we know how tough it is to win on the
road. These games are kind of in preparation, to make that a
little easier on us. It's important in getting us to Omaha, so
we know that every game from now on is an absolute must
win.
TSD: You now have only three weeks to make up 3.5 games
on conference leader Oregon. Is winning the conference still
seen as a viable goal, and what are you going to have to do
to avoid another series loss like the one you sustained this
weekend?
SP: I think it's taking each game one at a time, just knowing
that the Pac-12 title is important but it's not as important as
getting to Omaha. That's the goal: winning a national cham
pionship. It's always been the goal to get there. We're not so
much concerned with catching Oregon and Arizona as we
are with getting ourselves in good position for the postsea
son to make a run at it, have some fun and hopefully get to
Omaha.

Junior Stephen Piscotty currently leads the No. 17 baseball
team with 50 RBI and has taken on greater pitching responsibilities,
throwing 4.2 innings at Oregon State last Sunday.
Junior Stephen Piscotty was named a preseason Ail-
American for his hitting talents, but even though he leads
the No. 17 Stanford baseball team with 50 RBI good for
No. 24 in the nation some of his biggest contributions re
cently have been on the mound. A third baseman and left
fielder by trade, Piscotty pitched two innings as a freshman
and has become one of the Cardinal's most reliable reliev
ers over the last month. He recently spoke with The Daily
about his additional pitching responsibilities and how Stan
ford (29-14,11-10 Pac-12) hopes to secure its postseason po
sitioning with just three weeks left in the season.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You just threw 83 pitches over a
career-high 4.2 innings at Oregon State [on Sunday], How's
your arm feeling?
Stephen Piscotty (SP): A little sore. My whole body's a little
sore, but it's good soreness. It's not pain or anything, it's just
what is expected, but I'm definitely a little tired.
