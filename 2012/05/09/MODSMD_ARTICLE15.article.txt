# Winning out to stay at home
## 
### JACK MOSBACHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER MOSBACHER MINUTE 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of the
Stanford baseball team from 2008-
2011. Each week, he'll take a look at the
Cardinal's ups and downs on its road to
the College World Series.
There are few positives to be drawn
from No. 17 Stanford baseball's un
timely series loss to No. 23 Oregon
State this past weekend in Corvallis.
However, what the weekend did high
light is just how important it is that the
Cardinal closes its season with a re
sounding bang in the remaining three
weeks, in hopes of ensuring as many
games at Sunken Diamond as possible.
It is impossible to overstate the im
portance of last weekend's series
against the Beavers. In the previous
two weeks, Stanford had bullied its way
back into the Pac-12 chase, taking a

pair of crucial series from fellow con
tenders No. 19 Arizona State and No.
11 UCLA. But after this weekend, that
momentum is gone. With the series
loss, Stanford has dropped into a three
way tie for fifth place in a league that it
was unanimously picked to win before
the season started.
Perhaps the worst part about this
weekend's loss is that Stanford did not
play particularly badly. After taking the
opener from the Beavers, the Cardinal
dropped Saturday's game after pitcher
Brett Mooneyham was scratched from
his start with the flu. Then, the Cardinal
fell in an extra-inning affair on Sunday
to lose the series. Given the circum
stances, it's hard to be too harsh on our
guys or pinpoint one specific area of
weakness. This weekend, they just got
beat.
If the team can take away one les
son from the weekend, it should be that
it's incredibly hard to walk into Corval
lis and take a series against Oregon
State. The environment is foreign and
hostile, the weather is normally terrible
and head coach Pat Casey's teams play
a tough, gritty brand of baseball. By my
estimate, Stanford would win a neutral
site series with Oregon State eight out
of ten times. But playing on the road
distorts the odds in a big and noticeable
way.
Of course, the "on the road" phe
nomenon is not limited to playing in
Corvallis. Winning baseball games is a
hard-enough task on its own, but as
anyone who has played sports at any
level knows, playing in enemy territory
makes the task even harder.
In previous articles, I have stressed
the importance of being one of the top
eight "national seeds" in the college
baseball playoffs, with those teams
winning the right to host the Regional
and Super-Regional contests on their
home turfs. This weekend again indi
cated just how crucial it is that Stanford
claws its way into one of those seeds.
Even if Stanford makes it through its
Regional but doesn't get to host the
Super, it can expect that its road to
Omaha will run through somewhere
tougher than Corvallis.
Luckily for the Cardinal and its fans,
the dream of hosting isn't dead yet.
Although this weekend's losses
were huge setbacks, Stanford's easy
schedule in the last three weeks of the
season and the sheer talent on its team

make them impossible to write off. If
Stanford can make a strong run and
collect at least two series sweeps in its
remaining three series, a coveted top
eight national seeding might be in
reach.
Currently, Stanford is ranked No. 13
in the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI),
the equation that most accurately pre
dicts the relative strength of perform
ance and the college baseball playoff
picture. If Stanford can get two sweeps
against three conference bottom feed
ers eighth-place Washington State,
last-place Utah or ninth-place Cal it
could very well climb back to the top of
the Pac-12.
Of course, Stanford does not con
trol its own destiny, and many of the
Cardinal's hopes rely on the perform
ances of the teams that it is chasing, but
there is an urgent need for Stanford to
come together and focus in these last
three weeks.
I still stand by what I said before the
season began: Stanford is the most tal
ented team in the country. Now that I
watch these games from the stands, I
get to talk with professional scouts, all
of whom marvel at the power and
speed of the players who trot out in car
dinal and white uniforms every game.
With that in mind, it's important to
note that this team doesn't necessarily
need to host in order to make it to the
College World Series come June, and
I'm not suggesting that there is only
one palm-tree lined path to Omaha for
the Cardinal. Speaking from experi
ence, however, I know that Stanford's
chances of making it to the National
Championship series are greatly in
creased by winning the right to host the
playoffs at Sunken Diamond.
As the Cardinal prepares for the
final stretch of this up-and-down sea
son, I hope that the right leaders step
up and remind the whole team par
ticularly the younger guys, who have
been relied on more heavily as the sea
son progresses that playing in
Omaha would be the thrill of a lifetime.
Furthermore, I hope that Stanford re
members that its days on the field are
numbered, and that the most likely av
enue to extending its run will be win
ning the chance to play a few more
games in Palo Alto.

final stretch of this up-and-down sea
son, I hope that the right leaders step
up and remind the whole team par
ticularly the younger guys, who have
been relied on more heavily as the sea
son progresses that playing in
Omaha would be the thrill of a lifetime.
Furthermore, I hope that Stanford re
members that its days on the field are
numbered, and that the most likely av
enue to extending its run will be win
ning the chance to play a few more
games in Palo Alto.

Jack Mosbacher was a member of the
Stanford baseball team from 2008-
2011. Each week, he'll take a look at the
Cardinal's ups and downs on its road to
the College World Series.
There are few positives to be drawn
from No. 17 Stanford baseball's un
timely series loss to No. 23 Oregon
State this past weekend in Corvallis.
However, what the weekend did high
light is just how important it is that the
Cardinal closes its season with a re
sounding bang in the remaining three
weeks, in hopes of ensuring as many
games at Sunken Diamond as possible.
It is impossible to overstate the im
portance of last weekend's series
against the Beavers. In the previous
two weeks, Stanford had bullied its way
back into the Pac-12 chase, taking a

pair of crucial series from fellow con
tenders No. 19 Arizona State and No.
11 UCLA. But after this weekend, that
momentum is gone. With the series
loss, Stanford has dropped into a three
way tie for fifth place in a league that it
was unanimously picked to win before
the season started.
Perhaps the worst part about this
weekend's loss is that Stanford did not
play particularly badly. After taking the
opener from the Beavers, the Cardinal
dropped Saturday's game after pitcher
Brett Mooneyham was scratched from
his start with the flu. Then, the Cardinal
fell in an extra-inning affair on Sunday
to lose the series. Given the circum
stances, it's hard to be too harsh on our
guys or pinpoint one specific area of
weakness. This weekend, they just got
beat.
If the team can take away one les
son from the weekend, it should be that
it's incredibly hard to walk into Corval
lis and take a series against Oregon
State. The environment is foreign and
hostile, the weather is normally terrible
and head coach Pat Casey's teams play
a tough, gritty brand of baseball. By my
estimate, Stanford would win a neutral
site series with Oregon State eight out
of ten times. But playing on the road
distorts the odds in a big and noticeable
way.
Of course, the "on the road" phe
nomenon is not limited to playing in
Corvallis. Winning baseball games is a
hard-enough task on its own, but as
anyone who has played sports at any
level knows, playing in enemy territory
makes the task even harder.
In previous articles, I have stressed
the importance of being one of the top
eight "national seeds" in the college
baseball playoffs, with those teams
winning the right to host the Regional
and Super-Regional contests on their
home turfs. This weekend again indi
cated just how crucial it is that Stanford
claws its way into one of those seeds.
Even if Stanford makes it through its
Regional but doesn't get to host the
Super, it can expect that its road to
Omaha will run through somewhere
tougher than Corvallis.
Luckily for the Cardinal and its fans,
the dream of hosting isn't dead yet.
Although this weekend's losses
were huge setbacks, Stanford's easy
schedule in the last three weeks of the
season and the sheer talent on its team

make them impossible to write off. If
Stanford can make a strong run and
collect at least two series sweeps in its
remaining three series, a coveted top
eight national seeding might be in
reach.
Currently, Stanford is ranked No. 13
in the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI),
the equation that most accurately pre
dicts the relative strength of perform
ance and the college baseball playoff
picture. If Stanford can get two sweeps
against three conference bottom feed
ers eighth-place Washington State,
last-place Utah or ninth-place Cal it
could very well climb back to the top of
the Pac-12.
Of course, Stanford does not con
trol its own destiny, and many of the
Cardinal's hopes rely on the perform
ances of the teams that it is chasing, but
there is an urgent need for Stanford to
come together and focus in these last
three weeks.
I still stand by what I said before the
season began: Stanford is the most tal
ented team in the country. Now that I
watch these games from the stands, I
get to talk with professional scouts, all
of whom marvel at the power and
speed of the players who trot out in car
dinal and white uniforms every game.
With that in mind, it's important to
note that this team doesn't necessarily
need to host in order to make it to the
College World Series come June, and
I'm not suggesting that there is only
one palm-tree lined path to Omaha for
the Cardinal. Speaking from experi
ence, however, I know that Stanford's
chances of making it to the National
Championship series are greatly in
creased by winning the right to host the
playoffs at Sunken Diamond.

final stretch of this up-and-down sea
son, I hope that the right leaders step
