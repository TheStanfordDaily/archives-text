## Play delves into nuclear negotiations Pulitzer Prize-winner Rhodes explores Reykjavik Summit 
### NEEL THAKKAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There is a moment in Pulitzer
Prize-winner Richard Rhodes's new
play, "Reykjavik," when, after days of
negotiations over nuclear weapons
between then-U.S. President Ronald
Reagan and Soviet Union President
Mikhail Gorbachev, Reagan sudden
ly drops a bomb of his own.
"Why don't we get rid of them
all?" Reagan asks. "Can we agree, at
the end of ten years, to nuclear aboli
tion?"
For a moment, the two men come
together, shoulder to shoulder, at the
front of the stage. They look up and
out into the audience, as Reagan envi
sions the two of them meeting again
as old men, drinking champagne as
they watch the world's last two nu
clear missiles being ground into scrap.
But in the play, as in 1986, when the
Reykjavik Summit actually occurred
in the capital city of Ireland, talks be
tween Reagan and Gorbachev ulti
mately collapse.
Those few minutes, however, rep
resent the feelings of both hope and
regret that characterize "Reykjavik,"
which was presented Tuesday night at
Cemex Auditorium.
The hour-long production fea
turing just Reagan, played by Drama
and Classics Professor Rush Rehm,
and Gorbachev is notable for stay
ing close to the transcripts of the fa

mous event. Rhodes, who is affiliated
with Stanford's Center for Interna
tional Security and Cooperation
(CISAC), previously won a Pulitzer
Prize for his 1987 book, "The Making
of the Atomic Bomb."
"I was going through the tran
scripts of the Reykjavik summit in
2006, and it was intriguing to see [the
Soviet and American transcripts] side
by side and see what the American
side left out," Rhodes said after the
performance. "Particularly, Reagan's
move to eliminate everything [all nu
clear weapons] was excised."
The play seeks to show a fuller pic
ture of both leaders. Reagan is shown
to be charismatic and good-hearted,

but forgetful. For much of the sum
mit, he reads his arguments off note
cards and repeatedly mentions how,
in the aftermath of World War I, Eu
rope's great powers agreed to ban
chemical weapons, but "held onto
their gas masks."
Gorbachev is depicted as the more
intelligent and focused of the two, but
also spends time talking about his
youth, which was spent working on a
collective farm.
Both he and Reagan find common
ground in having "come from noth
ing." Such conversations take place
when the negotiations have grown

Richard Rhodes debuted his new play "Reykjavik" Tuesday night in Cemex Auditorium.
Set in 1986 during the Reykjavik Summit, his play portrays a pivotal
attempt at negotiation between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev.
too tense. Reagan describes his
years as a lifeguard or taking care
of his alcoholic father as a child.
"Something that gets lost in
reading history texts is the feel
ing and emotion of the event,"
said Ravi Patel 'l3, an interna
tional relations minor who at
tended after learning about the
summit in some of his classes.
"All I really knew was what was
accomplished during the meet
ing. I didn't know the tensions in
volved in the negotiating
process," Patel added.
The play demonstrates some
of those tensions. For all the
friendly feeling generated by
swapping childhood stories, the
two leaders cannot bring them
selves to trust one another.
In the performance, the heart
of the disagreement between the
two men is Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI), dubbed
"Star Wars" by the media.The ini
tiative would have established an
American space-based missile
shield to prevent against nuclear
attack.
"Damn it, Mikhail, SDI is for
defense," Reagan says. "Why do I

have to keep saying that? And
we'll share it. You have my word."
"You don't even share your
milk machines with us!" Gor
bachev retorts.
The play suggests Reagan's fa
mous stubbornness, something
which Tom Woosnam, a high
school physics teacher and mem
ber of the audience, said he both
admired and disliked.
"I was not convinced that Rea
gan's stubbornness was based in
rationality," Woosnam said. "[But
his] motivation was to protect his
country."
Everything in Rhodes's play
moments of levity included
points to this fundamental mis
trust in both leaders. When nego
tiations have failed at the end of
the play, each character blames
the other.
"You just don't get it," Reagan
says. "How am I supposed to trust
you?"
"I don't know what else I
could have done!" Gorbachev
replies.
"Well, I do" Reagan says. "You
should have said 'yes.'"

"Reykjavik" will be performed
again tonight at 7 p.m. in Cemex
Auditorium.
