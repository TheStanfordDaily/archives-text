# Admits weigh aid offers
## Ten percent of admit class asks for financial aid package to be reassessed 
### ETHAN KESSINGER 
Around 10 percent of admitted students petition the Fi
nancial Aid Office each year in hopes of increasing the
amount of aid that would be awarded to them if they came
to Stanford, according to Karen Cooper, director of finan
cial aid.
Members of the incoming fall class reported that addi
tional funds received through the petition process made it
financially possible for them to enroll at Stanford. Biola
Maccaulay 'l6 said that while her mother had to go in to talk
to the Financial Aid Office in person, the process was rela
tively painless.
"They increased my aid a lot," Maccaulay said. "It made
it a lot easier to come to Stanford."
Other students, however, questioned the fact that the
award process takes place behind closed doors, which can
lead to confusion and anger when awards are less than stu
dents expect. The Financial Aid Office said that the process
seeks to be as equal to all families as possible whether or
not they submit a petition.
"We are always trying to be equitable to all of our fami
lies," Cooper said. "Our goal is to treat the families who did
petition and did not petition the same so that families who
petition do not get special treatment."
According to Cooper, petitions are evaluated in a man
ner similar to how the University initially determines aid.
For a student who does not receive any aid, the cost of at
tendance for the 2012-13 academic year will be $58,436.This
may be partially or fully offset for students with financial
need by the $125 million that will be spent on institutional
scholarships next year.
Cooper reported that around $75 million of the money
for financial aid comes from the Stanford endowment, while
The Stanford Fund provides $l5 million and unrestricted
sources, such as the President's Funds, support the rest.
While the Financial Aid Office uses a statistic called Ex-
pected Family Contribution
(EFC), which is supplied by the
Free Application for Federal Stu
dent Aid (FAFSA), to determine
student eligibility for federal
funds, the University uses its own
algorithm to determine expected
family contribution when award
ing Stanford scholarship funds.
The Financial Aid Office tries
to send all award notifications
with students' admissions offers.
Cooper said that this allows time
for students to petition for an in
crease in their award before the
May 1 deadline to accept a Stan
ford offer of admission.
Stanford grants aid through a
process similar to that of many
top tier universities including
Harvard and Yale, according to
Cooper. She said unlike with fed
eral funds, the University takes
home equity into account, and

looks more comprehensively at
state taxes, which can make the
EFC that Stanford calculates
higher than the federal EFC.
Some students expressed satis
faction with the original amount
granted for financial aid.
"I received more from Stanford
than any other school," said Jeremy
Moffett 'l6. "I did not petition be
cause I was very happy with it."
The University has a Financial

Aid calculator on its website in
order to give students a rough es
timate of their award. Cooper said
the calculator uses the same for
mula that the Office uses, but that
actual awards are reviewed and
edited by the staff.
Cooper stressed that the peti
tion process is very similar to the
original award process. Financial
Aid Counselors (FACs) are not
assigned a specific caseload, but
instead work on petitions as they
are submitted to expedite the re
view process and notify students

as quickly as possible.
If the Financial Aid Office re
quires more information on indi
vidual students, they talk to terri
tory officers from the admissions
office, according to Cooper. As a
final review, she said that the
FACs meet as a group to discuss
special circumstances that com
plicate certain students' packages.
Financial aid petitions are not
strictly for incoming freshmen.
Students reapply for financial aid
every year and always have the
opportunity to petition their

awards. Cooper said. She also
added that the Financial Aid Of
fice would reevaluate awards in
the middle of the academic year if
requested.
"We encourage families, that if
something does change during
the academic year, to let us
know," Cooper said. "We can
work with them to see if that war
rants a change to their financial
aid eligibility."

tendance for the 2012-13 academic year will be $58,436.This
may be partially or fully offset for students with financial
need by the $125 million that will be spent on institutional
scholarships next year.
Cooper reported that around $75 million of the money
for financial aid comes from the Stanford endowment, while
The Stanford Fund provides $l5 million and unrestricted
sources, such as the President's Funds, support the rest.
While the Financial Aid Office uses a statistic called Ex-
pected Family Contribution
(EFC), which is supplied by the
Free Application for Federal Stu
dent Aid (FAFSA), to determine
student eligibility for federal
funds, the University uses its own
algorithm to determine expected
family contribution when award
ing Stanford scholarship funds.
The Financial Aid Office tries
to send all award notifications
with students' admissions offers.
Cooper said that this allows time
for students to petition for an in
crease in their award before the
May 1 deadline to accept a Stan
ford offer of admission.
Stanford grants aid through a
process similar to that of many
top tier universities including
Harvard and Yale, according to
Cooper. She said unlike with fed
eral funds, the University takes
home equity into account, and

looks more comprehensively at
state taxes, which can make the
EFC that Stanford calculates
higher than the federal EFC.
Some students expressed satis
faction with the original amount
granted for financial aid.
"I received more from Stanford
than any other school," said Jeremy
Moffett 'l6. "I did not petition be
cause I was very happy with it."
The University has a Financial

Aid calculator on its website in
order to give students a rough es
timate of their award. Cooper said
the calculator uses the same for
mula that the Office uses, but that
actual awards are reviewed and
edited by the staff.
Cooper stressed that the peti
tion process is very similar to the
original award process. Financial
Aid Counselors (FACs) are not
assigned a specific caseload, but
instead work on petitions as they
are submitted to expedite the re
view process and notify students

as quickly as possible.
If the Financial Aid Office re
quires more information on indi
vidual students, they talk to terri
tory officers from the admissions
office, according to Cooper. As a
final review, she said that the
FACs meet as a group to discuss
special circumstances that com
plicate certain students' packages.
Financial aid petitions are not
strictly for incoming freshmen.
Students reapply for financial aid
every year and always have the
opportunity to petition their

awards. Cooper said. She also
added that the Financial Aid Of
fice would reevaluate awards in
the middle of the academic year if
requested.
"We encourage families, that if
something does change during
the academic year, to let us
know," Cooper said. "We can
work with them to see if that war
rants a change to their financial
aid eligibility."
