petition and did not petition the same so that families who
petition do not get special treatment."
According to Cooper, petitions are evaluated in a man

scholarships next year.
Cooper reported that around $75 million of the money
for financial aid comes from the Stanford endowment, while
The Stanford Fund provides $l5 million and unrestricted
sources, such as the President's Funds, support the rest.
