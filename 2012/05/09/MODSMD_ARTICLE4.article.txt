## Climate change initiatives losing support in US 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ileana Najarro 
A recent survey conducted by Stanford
and Ipsos Public Affairs revealed a decline in
U.S. support for government-endorsed cli
mate change initiatives over the past two
years.
Seventy-two percent of participants advo
cated for government action on climate
change concerns in a 2010 survey conducted
by Stanford. This year's survey, however,
showed a decrease in support to 62 percent.
According to the survey results, major fac
tors that have swayed individuals away from
supporting government climate change initia
tive include Republican political leanings,
skepticism directed toward climate scientists
and recent shifts to a cooling of weather world
wide.
Jon Krosnik, senior fellow at the Stanford
Woods Institute for the Environment, men
tioned in an article in the Stanford Report
the lack of Republican support for govern
ment initiatives in climate matters during the
current presidential campaigns. Those who
identified as Republican expressed the
sharpest drop in support for these initiatives.
The report indicated that the American
public's main concern with government in
volvement in climate change is consumer
taxes that are meant to dissuade greater pub
lic use of electricity and gasoline. The report,
however, did not find evidence to suggest
that economic struggles play a considerable
factor
Regardless of the drop in full supporters,
the study did reveal that many specific gov
ernment actions addressing climate change
continue to receive support.
