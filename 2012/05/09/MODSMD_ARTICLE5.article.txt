### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Mary Ann Toman-Miller 
Michel Boudart, professor emeritus of
chemical engineering at Stanford, died last
Wednesday at the age of 87. Boudart taught
at Princeton University and UC-Berkeley
before spending 50 years in Stanford's
Chemical Engineering Department.
Boudart's work influenced the
energy, defense and space indus
tries. A holder of four patents, he is
best known for his work in cataly
sis, which involves studying sub
stances that cause a change in the
rate of a chemical reaction without
reacting.
According to the Journal of
Physical Chemistry, Boudart's
principal achievement was the
"quantification of catalysis as
rigorous sequences" of basic
steps, which helped enable exact
chemical reaction readings. Such
advances made it possible for
laboratories to compare data
globally, affording opportunities

for collaboration.

Born in Belgium, Boudart
earned a B.S. and M.S. at the Uni
versity of Louvain, and then ob
tained his Ph.D. in chemistry at
Princeton University in 1950.
Boudart became Stanford's first
William M. Keck, Sr. professor of
chemical engineering and helped
build the reputation of the Chem
ical Engineering Department.
He was knighted in Belgium,
and was elected to both the Na
tional Academy of Science and
the National Academy of Engi
neering. Along with two associ
ates, Boudart founded Catalytica,
a company that works on prob
lems involving catalysis for petro
chemical, chemical and pharma
ceutical firms, in Santa Clara,
Calif.
