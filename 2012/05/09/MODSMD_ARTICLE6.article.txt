## Former Peruvian President links ethnicity to poverty 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
"There is a high correlation between
poverty and ethnicity," said Alejandro Tole
do, former president of Peru, at an all-day
conference Tuesday in Encina Hall. "It's not
a coincidence that the poorest people in
Latin America are indigenous or Afro de
scendants. That is why I think the initiative of
this conference has an enormous applica
tion. It is not just an academic exercise it's
very concrete."
Toledo, who served as Peru's president
from 2001 to 2006, gave the opening address
at a conference titled "Human Rights of In
digenous Peoples in Latin America," which
sought to explore how the conditions of in
digenous people in the region can be im
proved.
Toledo began by examining the econom
ic situation of Latin America and discussing
how despite overall economic growth, the
poverty gap between the indigenous and the
wealthy continues to swell.
"One of the greatest advantages that I
think Latin America has is our cultural di
versity," he said. "That cultural diversity is

not our weakness. It's our strength.
"If we are able to build on that, then we
can create a cohesive society, reduce social
conflict and provide sustainability for eco
nomic growth," Toledo continued. "And the
income we derive from that growth, we can
invest it in the minds of our people."
His wife, Elaine Karp-Toledo, an anthro
pologist and economist, expanded on the in
digenous culture and way of life in an after
noon presentation. She discussed why and
how indigenous people should be involved
with their local and national governments.
"We propose that social inclusion and
equal citizenship are key factors for good gov
ernance," Karp-Toledo said. "The indigenous
worldview has to be respected and integrated
in public policies."
According to Karp-Toledo, the modern
press and media unfortunately continue to
produce negative images of the indigenous,
portraying them as less-civilized people who
cannot recognize improvements or what is
best for them. She said this makes it more
difficult for them to be taken seriously by
their governments.
