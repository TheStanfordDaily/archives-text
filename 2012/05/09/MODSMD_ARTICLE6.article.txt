## Former Peruvian President links ethnicity to poverty 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
"There is a high correlation between
poverty and ethnicity," said Alejandro Tole
do, former president of Peru, at an all-day
conference Tuesday in Encina Hall. "It's not
a coincidence that the poorest people in
Latin America are indigenous or Afro de
scendants. That is why I think the initiative of
this conference has an enormous applica
tion. It is not just an academic exercise it's
very concrete."
Toledo, who served as Peru's president
from 2001 to 2006, gave the opening address
at a conference titled "Human Rights of In
digenous Peoples in Latin America," which
sought to explore how the conditions of in
digenous people in the region can be im
proved.
Toledo began by examining the econom
ic situation of Latin America and discussing
how despite overall economic growth, the
poverty gap between the indigenous and the
wealthy continues to swell.
"One of the greatest advantages that I
think Latin America has is our cultural di
versity," he said. "That cultural diversity is

not our weakness. It's our strength.
"If we are able to build on that, then we
can create a cohesive society, reduce social
conflict and provide sustainability for eco
nomic growth," Toledo continued. "And the
income we derive from that growth, we can
invest it in the minds of our people."
His wife, Elaine Karp-Toledo, an anthro
pologist and economist, expanded on the in
digenous culture and way of life in an after
noon presentation. She discussed why and
how indigenous people should be involved
with their local and national governments.
"We propose that social inclusion and
equal citizenship are key factors for good gov
ernance," Karp-Toledo said. "The indigenous
worldview has to be respected and integrated
in public policies."
According to Karp-Toledo, the modern
press and media unfortunately continue to
produce negative images of the indigenous,
portraying them as less-civilized people who
cannot recognize improvements or what is
best for them. She said this makes it more
difficult for them to be taken seriously by
their governments.

Former Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo and economist Eliane Karp-Toledo addressed the
audience at an all-day conference on Latin American indigenous population integration and
human rights on Tuesday. They emphasized the link between poverty and human rights.
Audience member Diana
Martin, a Palo Alto resident, said
she was intrigued by the concept
of involving the indigenous in
modern education and markets.
"There's a feeling of bringing
the indigenous into the corporate
culture if you educate them,"
Martin said. "But if you're teach
ing them to use computers and
cell phones, it's a dilemma be
cause you could destroy their tra
ditional culture,"
Nadejda Marques, manager of
the Program on Human Rights,
initially proposed the idea of the
conference. Marques said she
feels that the issues surrounding
the indigenous population in
Latin America are applicable
around the world, including in the
United States, where Native
Americans have to fight for sov
ereignty.
"Providing information and

creating awareness is definitely
one of the conference's goals, but
we also wanted to create mo
mentum for researchers on in
digenous rights and that's not
necessarily specific to Latin
America" Marques said. "It's
both multi-disciplinary and
transnational."
Throughout the day, there
were five panel sessions of two to
four speakers who each pub
lished papers on the conference
theme. The panels presented var
ious aspects of the issue such as
indigenous child health, property
rights and the indigenous rela
tionship with climate change.
The Center on Democracy,
Development, and the Rule of
Law partnered with the Program
on Human Rights and the Center
for Latin American Studies and
Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford to organize the event. The
Program on Human Rights plans
to post the academic papers of the
event speakers on its website.
