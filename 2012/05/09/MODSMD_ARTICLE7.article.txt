## ASSU Senate debates ARP modifications 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In its second meeting, the 14th Under
graduate Senate began discussion Tuesday
on the Alternative Review Process
(ARP), a judicial procedure for cases in
volving sexual assault, sexual harassment
or relationship violence at Stanford.
Although the Senate did not revise or
vote on any of the ARP provisions, Sena
tor Ashley Harris 'l5 announced that the
Board of Judicial Affairs voted Tuesday to
add an "innocent until found responsible"
clause back into the ARP charter, rectify
ing a controversial absence that Harris
said was merely an oversight . The senators
also presented their opinions on the dis
cretion of the investigator in admitting ev
idence, the unitary appellate jurisdiction
of the vice provost, the unanimous-versus
majority voting requirement, the size of
review panels and the right to confront
witnesses.
Garima Sharma 'l5, Senate deputy
chair, expressed an opinion on almost
every issue and supported the existing
provisions of the ARP. She endorsed the
preponderance of evidence burden of
proof by likening the ARP to a civil trial, in
which preponderance of evidence is some
times used, and reminded her peers of the
promising effect that the lowered standard
of proof has had on encouraging victims to
report cases. She also echoed the logic of
the Dear Colleague Letter, which says that
Title IX suits and Office for Civil Rights
discrimination suits are tried under pre
ponderance of evidence and, therefore,
campus hearings involving sexual assault
should similarly adopt this standard.
"In terms of the standard of proof,
[Jamie Pontius-Hogan] said there is basi
cally no wiggle room," Harris reported
from her conversation with the assistant
dean of the Office of Judicial Affairs earli
er that day. "It's going to be preponder
ance of evidence ... because without it,
federal funding could be lost."
While no senators strongly dis
puted the preponderance of evi
dence standard, several argued
that due to the lowered standard of
proof, the responding student
ought to have strong procedural
protections.
"I think with the lowering of the
standard of proof, we would need
six panel members," said Senator
Shahab Fadavi 'l5, who has served
as a reviewer in campus judicial
proceedings involving honor code
violations. "I would think that you
would need to ... increase the
number of faculty members on
that panel who are involved and
more knowledgeable on sexual ha
rassment cases in particular."
In response to the argument
that a smaller panel leads to in
creased privacy for both parties to
a case, Fadavi said that all panels
are required to keep cases confi
dential, and that adding a faculty
member might insulate the infor
mation from the student body.
"Ultimately our goal is to make
sure that... people who are...
actually sexually assaulted . . .

come forward, and, hopefully, the
lower standard will do that," he
said. "But, at the same time, we
would want to make sure that we
don't wrongly find anyone respon
sible, because that is also super im
portant, if you consider the impact
that this does have on a person's fu
ture."
"You need to be somewhat pre
pared for the slippery slope, for the
worst case scenario," Viraj Bindra
'l5 said, echoing the sentiments of
Law School student Elliott Wolf,
who spoke to the senators at their
May 1 meeting about his experi
ence serving as student body presi
dent at Duke University in the im
mediate aftermath of the 2006
Duke lacrosse scandal. Bindra said
that he was concerned with the uni
tary discretion of the investigator
to reject evidence.
Sharma responded by repeat
ing the caveat of Tessa Ormenyi
'l4, an ARP reviewer, that re
sponding students have, in the
past, brought in irrelevant charac
ter witnesses just to delay a verdict
or sanction. Sharma also argued
that there would be logistical
problems in allowing reviewers to
determine relevancy because of
their tendency to evaluate evi
dence they have heard, even if it
has been ruled irrelevant.

When discussing a unanimous
versus-simple majority voting re
quirement, a gender divide of the
Senate emerged, with Sharma,
Harris, Kimberly Bacon 'l5, Jan
havi Vartak 'l5 and Lauren Miller
'l5 supporting the existing majori
ty requirement, and Jack Weller
'l5, Brandon Hightower 'l5 and
Ismael "Ish" Menjivar 'l5 favoring
a unanimous requirement. Fadavi
'l5 was the only male senator to
express support for maintaining
the majority requirement.
The senators, several of whom
said they felt that they did not
know enough about the process or
had not heard from enough ex
perts to have a thorough and in
formed opinion, decided to invite
several experts with varied stances
to attend next week's Senate
meeting. In hopes of better repre
senting their constituents, the sen
ators also discussed methods of
inviting and collecting student
opinion about the ARP, including
an open town hall debate, in
creased personal communication
and the extension of anonymous
forums for students intimidated by
the idea of speaking at Senate
meetings.
