## ASSU Senate debates ARP modifications 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In its second meeting, the 14th Under
graduate Senate began discussion Tuesday
on the Alternative Review Process
(ARP), a judicial procedure for cases in
volving sexual assault, sexual harassment
or relationship violence at Stanford.
Although the Senate did not revise or
vote on any of the ARP provisions, Sena
tor Ashley Harris 'l5 announced that the
Board of Judicial Affairs voted Tuesday to
add an "innocent until found responsible"
clause back into the ARP charter, rectify
ing a controversial absence that Harris
said was merely an oversight . The senators
also presented their opinions on the dis
cretion of the investigator in admitting ev
idence, the unitary appellate jurisdiction
of the vice provost, the unanimous-versus
majority voting requirement, the size of
review panels and the right to confront
witnesses.
Garima Sharma 'l5, Senate deputy
chair, expressed an opinion on almost
every issue and supported the existing
provisions of the ARP. She endorsed the
preponderance of evidence burden of
proof by likening the ARP to a civil trial, in
which preponderance of evidence is some
times used, and reminded her peers of the
promising effect that the lowered standard
of proof has had on encouraging victims to
report cases. She also echoed the logic of
the Dear Colleague Letter, which says that
Title IX suits and Office for Civil Rights
discrimination suits are tried under pre
ponderance of evidence and, therefore,
campus hearings involving sexual assault
should similarly adopt this standard.
"In terms of the standard of proof,
[Jamie Pontius-Hogan] said there is basi
cally no wiggle room," Harris reported
from her conversation with the assistant
dean of the Office of Judicial Affairs earli
er that day. "It's going to be preponder
ance of evidence ... because without it,
federal funding could be lost."
