Invisible to the casual on
looker and shrouded by the
overhanging branches of a
coast live oak or a bay tree,
15 cat feeding stations are
sprinkled throughout the Stanford
campus, unbeknownst to most of
its inhabitants. Ranging from the
Plant Growth Facility on Stock
farm Road to the bushes outside
Lagunita residences and all the
way to East Campus, each station
consists of an unobtrusive black
plastic bin to protect the food and
feeding cats from the sun and rain
storms. This station system is an in
tegral component of the Stanford
Cat Network.
"One thing people comment
on when they look at the Stanford
Cat Network webpage is that all
the cats look really healthy," said
Kirk Gilmore, an engineering
physicist at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) who
volunteers as a "feeder" for the
Stanford Cat Network. "People
expect feral cats to be all skinny,
scrawny and unhealthy-looking
but that's exactly what we try to
avoid."
The Stanford Cat Network was
founded in 1989, when mainte
nance employees on campus
began finding litters of sick kittens
around Stanford. The news trav
eled to administrative officials and
someone decided that the issue
needed to be addressed.
"There was a decision that
came down that the humane thing
to do was to go trap all these ani
mals and take them to the local
shelter where they would all be
killed because they weren't adopt
able [and] there were too many of
them," said Carole Miller, co
founder of the Stanford Cat Net
work.
Community members who had
already been feeding the animals
independently banded together in
support of the cats. The Stanford
Cat Network, as they called them
selves, negotiated an agreement
with the administrators, who al
lowed them to provide "popula
tion management" of the home
less cats on campus. Population
management entails spaying, neu
tering and caring for the creatures,
in a process often called "Trap,
Neuter, Return." This program
had a dramatic effect on the cam
pus feline population.
"We had at least 500 cats on
campus in '89," Miller said. "We
have two dozen known cats
today."
Many "newcomer" cats appear
each year, left by students who sud
denly find they cannot care for
their pets over a school holiday or
find the responsibility of owning an
animal tiresome. When found, do
mesticated or "tameable" cats will
be placed in foster homes and later
be put up for adoption. Miller takes
in any cats that are not adopted to
live at her sanctuary as the network
is strictly no-kill.
The remaining two dozen cats
are feral, or un-socialized. They
cannot be adopted or live as pets,
but still cannot completely fend
for themselves. Thus, they rely on
the Stanford Cat Network feeders
for sustenance.
"The most feral cat is still a do
mestic animal," Miller said.
Feeders on campus include
staff, faculty members and stu
dents.
"I do basically what needs to be
done," Gilmore said. "I feed and I
trap. We put a lot of energy into
making the traps comfortable for
the feral cats so we can trap them.
We usually monitor them for a
while to make sure they haven't
been trapped before."
After trapping the cats, volun
teers like Gilmore bring them to a
veterinarian for a check-up and
spaying or neutering.

Driving around in a white mini
van with a license plate that reads
"CATNET" and a trunk filled
with cat food and water jugs,
Miller will often take on feeding
responsibilities in addition to her
position as co-founder of the or
ganization.
Approaching a station, she fills
a food bowl with both dry pellets
and wet paste so that cats with
dental problems do not go hungry.
Two options ensure that every cat
will at least be able to eat some
portion of the food provided.
After washing and replacing the
used bowl. Miller hops back into
her vehicle and headed to the next
location.

"Once I get going, it's rather
therapeutic," Miller said.
At the Plant Growth Facility on
West Campus, the Stanford Cat
Network has built a much larger
enclosure, complete with cat
climbing equipment. Curled up in
side the enclosure is a glossy black
and brown cat suffering from fe
line leukemia. Because Milton is
feral, he cannot be adopted. He
also cannot return into the compa
ny of the other feral or homeless
cats roaming the Stanford campus
for fear of passing on the conta
gious disease. The Stanford Cat
Network has been able to provide
Milton with a haven he would not
otherwise have.
Although not affiliated with
the Stanford Cat Network, East
Florence Moore Resident Fellow
(RF) Susan Watkins is also an on
campus cat caretaker. Working
through an organization called
Humanimal, Watkins and her fam
ily have fostered five or six litters
over the course of the nine years
they have served as RFs, each lit
ter containing between four to six
feral kittens. Their position as RFs
has been ideal for socializing these
kittens.
"It's a great way to get resi
dents down here; they're kittens,
they're adorable!" Watkins said.
"People will just come and sit in
here and there will be a kitten
asleep on their lap."
Once the kittens weigh two
pounds, they can be returned to
Humanimal to be spayed or
neutered and later adopted out.
Not everyone on campus how
ever is enamored with cats, or with
the Stanford Cat Network. At one
of the stations, a 70-pound feeding
structure disappeared and Miller
suspected sabotage.
"There are those of us who love
these animals, but there are an
awful lot of people out there who
hate cats, to the point of being will
ing to go too far and do some
thing," Miller said.
Despite these incidents, the
roaming cats on campus return to
the feeding stations year after
year. Some of the cats present in
1989 when the Network was
founded just recently died. The or
ganization's success in decreasing
the number of cats on campus is
apparent, and perhaps disappoint
ing to some.
"We used to get a lot of student
feeders [who came] because they
saw cats," Miller said. "And now
they just go on faith."
