Stereotype threat is the experience of anxiety in a situation where a person
has the potential to confirm a negative stereotype about his or her social
group. In school, stereotype threat can cause underrepresented students to
perform below their potential. It can cause them to focus less on learning and more
on the worrisome prospect of performing poorly. The sting of stereotype threat can
be felt by anyone - male or female, black or white, Asian or Latino, young or old.
But when the threat is chronic, it can contribute to enduring patterns of inequality in
school and beyond. What can be done to reverse the effects of stereotype threat?
Through a multimedia presentation, social psychologists, Steele,
Cohen, and Walton will illuminate the experience of stereotype
threat and highlight the powerful ways we can diminish it and close
the achievement gap between groups.
