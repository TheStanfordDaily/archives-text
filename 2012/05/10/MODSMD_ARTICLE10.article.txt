# POST-IT SECRETS
## 
### â€“ Jenny Thai 
On the first floor of Ar
rillaga Dining Com
mons is a large TV
monitor mounted on
the wall adjacent to a
large window overlooking the
kitchen. The monitor displays an
image of a large corkboard with
colorful post-it notes. Each note
contains a short message, reveal
ing a secret sent anonymously by
text message. The messages vary
wildly in tone from "I'm over
worked" to "I wish I had used a
condom" to "I'm so happy for my
beautiful friends!!!!!!" to "Some
times it's hard to pretend that I'm
happy all the time."
The live post-it board screen in
Arrillaga is the site of Post Sta
nford, a project launched last
Thursday by the ASSU Health
and Wellness Executive Team
with the aim of improving com
munication between students on
campus. Spearheaded by former
ASSU Chair of Health and Well
ness Stephanie Liou 'l3, Post-
Stanford was inspired by Post S
ecret, a website to which users can
anonymously mail in their secrets
on homemade postcards. Post-
Stanford operates on a similar
principle by creating an open but
safe space where students can free
themselves from the emotional
burden of their secrets.
"It's really mentally healthy
for people to express a secret,"
said ASSU Chair of Health and
Wellness Taylor Winfield 'l3.
"Carrying baggage inside really
just weighs you down and a lot of
times, people have something that
they're afraid of what people will
think if they find out they're
afraid of being embarrassed."
ASSU Chief Technology Offi
cer Michael Fischer, a doctoral
student in computer science, set
up a program through which stu
dents can interact with the live

screen by texting messages to 414-
11. Once the messages pass
through a spam filter, they appear
as a note on the screen for all to
see. The secrets displayed are di
verse both in topic and degree of
positivity. Secrets have been post
ed on relationships, stress, classes
and sexuality. While the degree of
pessimism that colors some of the
notes may startle some students,
the creators said they believe stu
dent mental health is a conversa
tion that must be brought to the
forefront.
"People are always talking
about Stanford Duck Syndrome,"
Winfield said. "We've been talking
about it for so long ... humans
have a negativity bias where they
always notice what's bad."
Winfield emphasized that Post-
Stanford promotes open sharing
of emotions.
"If something great happens to
you, share it," Winfield said. "If
you're having a rough day, share it.
If something funny happens, share
it. Share your feelings, whether
[they're] good or bad."
"We don't want this to be a pity
board," she added. "We hope that
this program will help people who
have secrets realize that they can
share them in a safe environment,
and then if they do need it, they
can get more help."
According to Winfield, the ini
tial response has been overwhelm
ingly positive. On the day of its
launch, the board received around
50 text messages. Talks of expand
ing the board to other dining halls,
however, will be dependent on
continuing level of student inter
est.
"Post a secret post some
thing, say something," Winfield
said. "Someone else can read it
and know that they're not alone in
the struggle."
