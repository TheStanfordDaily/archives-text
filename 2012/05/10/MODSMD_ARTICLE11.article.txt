## SEEING GREEN Blowing hot air 
### Holly Moeller 
Last week, word came from
Prudhoe Bay that sent chills
through me as surely as if I'd
been standing in the Alaskan
North Slope drilling outpost my
self. The United States Department
of Energy in collaboration with
energy giant ConocoPhillips and
the Japanese nationalized minerals
corporation reported success
from a month-long test extraction
of methane gas tucked into an icy
lattice below the permafrost.
These methane hydrates are
found in cold regions (like the Arc
tic, where low temperatures keep
the permafrost soil layer frozen
year-round) and off continental
shelves (where pressure from a
thick blanket of water stabilizes the
compressed gas).
Though testing to reveal the full
extent and nature of these gas de
posits has only just begun,
methane hydrates are already
making headlines as the next big
energy source.
The US Geological Survey esti
mates that there's twice as much
burnable carbon hiding in hy
drates as in all other known fossil
fuel deposits worldwide. And since
methane gas burns hot and clean
giving off 33 percent more ener
gy per carbon dioxide molecule
emitted as petroleum, without the
nasty nitrogen and sulfur oxides
that come from coal ears
around the world have perked up.
In 2006, China pledged $lOO
million to hydrate exploration. In
2008, Japan and Canada complet
ed a six-day test drill in the
Mackenzie Basin. And now that
this year's test results are looking
good, Secretary of Energy Steven
Chu says that domestic gas prices
could drop 30 percent by 2025.
As an added bonus, methane
extraction traps carbon dioxide.
The latest technology pumps the
most notorious greenhouse gas
into the ground, where it replaces
methane in the ice matrix. The dis
placed methane is then pumped to
the surface and in the DOE's
(and, undoubtedly, Cono
coPhillips') vision down
pipelines to heat homes in the
Lower 48.
Plus, argue supporters, climate
change projections indicate that
rising temperatures may release
much of that methane anyway. If
the permafrost thaws or the ocean
warms, vast tracts of icy clathrates
could melt, outgassing methane
which has 20 times the warming
potential of carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere, further accelerat
ing climate change. This is one of
the most feared positive feedback
loops known to climate scientists.
So wouldn't it be nice if we
could turn some of that methane
into carbon dioxide ahead of time?
I don't think so.
Burning fossil fuels oil, coal
and natural gas put us into our
tenuous climatic position in the
first place. Any carbon dioxide we

sequester during methane hydrate
extraction will quickly be replaced
through burning of the extracted
methane. And the carbon dioxide
trap is only temporary: warmer
polar temperatures will free it as
surely as the presently trapped
methane scientists are so con
cerned about.
Add to this the issue of scale.
Given that commercialization of
methane hydrate extraction is still
a political pipe dream, we're un
likely to process any significant
portion of the 320 quadrillion
cubic feet of methane scattered in
hydrates around the country.
Now to don our economic hats.
Increased supply and decreased
costs only drive up demand. Say we
can, as the DOE promises, double
our natural gas supply and effect
dramatic price cuts by using only 1
percent of domestically available
methane hydrates. This quick fix of
another carbon-based fuel will
only delay our ultimate sustainabil
ity reckoning.
Methane hydrates, no matter
how vast their supply seems, are
just another nonrenewable re
source. A boom in gas production
will add years maybe decades
—to the difficult but necessary
transition to renewable energy
sources. And in the meantime, we'll
be doing plenty of damage to our
environment both globally
through additional greenhouse gas
emissions and locally, by drilling
in sensitive ecosystems.
In the last decade, we've fought
plenty of environmental battles
over how and where to drill for oil.
We've seen the consequences
Deepwater Horizon and the Gulf
of Mexico 2010 spill, for example
of pushing our technological
limits towards harder and harder to
reach deposits.
And now we want to grasp at
something even more risky, at min
eral formations that, when destabi
lized, cause explosions and land
slides.
I'm afraid that the laws of eco
nomics— especially in a country
that will invest $6.5 million this
year alone (plus an additional $5
million, pending congressional ap
proval) on methane hydrate recov
er research will once again favor
Sarah Palin's mantra, "Drill, baby,
drill." As surely as methane is
trapped within its lattice of ice, we
are trapped in a spider's web of fos
sil fuel dependency. Unlike
methane, however, it seems even
climate change can't force us out.

methane in the ice matrix. The dis
placed methane is then pumped to
the surface and in the DOE's
(and, undoubtedly, Cono
coPhillips') vision down
pipelines to heat homes in the
Lower 48.
Plus, argue supporters, climate
change projections indicate that
rising temperatures may release
much of that methane anyway. If
the permafrost thaws or the ocean
warms, vast tracts of icy clathrates
could melt, outgassing methane
which has 20 times the warming
potential of carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere, further accelerat
ing climate change. This is one of
the most feared positive feedback
loops known to climate scientists.
So wouldn't it be nice if we
could turn some of that methane
into carbon dioxide ahead of time?
I don't think so.
Burning fossil fuels oil, coal
and natural gas put us into our
tenuous climatic position in the
first place. Any carbon dioxide we

sequester during methane hydrate
extraction will quickly be replaced
through burning of the extracted
methane. And the carbon dioxide
trap is only temporary: warmer
polar temperatures will free it as
surely as the presently trapped
methane scientists are so con
cerned about.
Add to this the issue of scale.
Given that commercialization of
methane hydrate extraction is still
a political pipe dream, we're un
likely to process any significant
portion of the 320 quadrillion
cubic feet of methane scattered in
hydrates around the country.
Now to don our economic hats.
Increased supply and decreased
costs only drive up demand. Say we
can, as the DOE promises, double
our natural gas supply and effect
dramatic price cuts by using only 1
percent of domestically available
methane hydrates. This quick fix of
another carbon-based fuel will
only delay our ultimate sustainabil
ity reckoning.
Methane hydrates, no matter
how vast their supply seems, are
just another nonrenewable re
source. A boom in gas production
will add years maybe decades
—to the difficult but necessary
transition to renewable energy
sources. And in the meantime, we'll
be doing plenty of damage to our
environment both globally
through additional greenhouse gas
emissions and locally, by drilling
in sensitive ecosystems.
In the last decade, we've fought
plenty of environmental battles
over how and where to drill for oil.
We've seen the consequences
Deepwater Horizon and the Gulf
of Mexico 2010 spill, for example
of pushing our technological
limits towards harder and harder to
reach deposits.
And now we want to grasp at
something even more risky, at min
eral formations that, when destabi
lized, cause explosions and land
slides.
I'm afraid that the laws of eco
nomics— especially in a country
that will invest $6.5 million this
year alone (plus an additional $5
million, pending congressional ap
proval) on methane hydrate recov
er research will once again favor
Sarah Palin's mantra, "Drill, baby,
drill." As surely as methane is
trapped within its lattice of ice, we
are trapped in a spider's web of fos
sil fuel dependency. Unlike
methane, however, it seems even
climate change can't force us out.

Last week, word came from
Prudhoe Bay that sent chills
through me as surely as if I'd
been standing in the Alaskan
North Slope drilling outpost my
self. The United States Department
of Energy in collaboration with
energy giant ConocoPhillips and
the Japanese nationalized minerals
corporation reported success
from a month-long test extraction
of methane gas tucked into an icy
lattice below the permafrost.
These methane hydrates are
found in cold regions (like the Arc
tic, where low temperatures keep
the permafrost soil layer frozen
year-round) and off continental
shelves (where pressure from a
thick blanket of water stabilizes the
compressed gas).
Though testing to reveal the full
extent and nature of these gas de
posits has only just begun,
methane hydrates are already
making headlines as the next big
energy source.
The US Geological Survey esti
mates that there's twice as much
burnable carbon hiding in hy
drates as in all other known fossil
fuel deposits worldwide. And since
methane gas burns hot and clean
giving off 33 percent more ener
gy per carbon dioxide molecule
emitted as petroleum, without the
nasty nitrogen and sulfur oxides
that come from coal ears
around the world have perked up.
In 2006, China pledged $lOO
million to hydrate exploration. In
2008, Japan and Canada complet
ed a six-day test drill in the
Mackenzie Basin. And now that
this year's test results are looking
good, Secretary of Energy Steven
Chu says that domestic gas prices
could drop 30 percent by 2025.
As an added bonus, methane
extraction traps carbon dioxide.
The latest technology pumps the
most notorious greenhouse gas
into the ground, where it replaces
methane in the ice matrix. The dis
placed methane is then pumped to
the surface and in the DOE's
(and, undoubtedly, Cono
coPhillips') vision down
pipelines to heat homes in the
Lower 48.
