# MODERN MANNERS
## The 						perils of answering multiple choice questions 
### Jeff Mandell 
If you're a Stanford student,
you've taken an awful lot of
tests in your life, which means
there have probably been times
when you couldn't help wondering
if you were smarter than the test
or at least, more intellectually vig
orous than the TAs were feeling
when they wrote the multiple
choice section at 2 a.m.
Maybe you are steadily filling in
the bubbles until you come to
number 14, where you suddenly
realize that there are two right an
swers. One of them is obvious, and
one of them is subtle, arguable
even, but you remember coming
across a technicality while study
ing that lends it some potential va
lidity. You pick the obvious choice,
of course.
But what if it's one of those
devilish check-all-that-apply situ
ations? You have a problem on
your hands because now the test
isn't just on what you know, but on
what you think the answer key
knows. Do you fill in the extra an
swer, prepared to go in and defend
yourself if you get dinged, or do
you play conservatively, risking
the loss of a point if the test writers
are thinking a little deeper than
you think they are?
If you think on a deep enough
level, there are a lot of multiple
choice questions out there that
have more than one answer.
There might be an obvious way to
read a question, and an obvious
answer that goes with it, and there
might be a less conventional way
to read a question, with another
answer choice that fits with it. One
of the keys of test-taking is to
know how you're supposed to read
the question.

This issue came up in a recent
New York Times article on stan
dardized testing in middle school,
which described how a reading
comprehension passage sparked
controversy among students and
parents for being too far-out. The
passage in question involved a
race between a pineapple and
hare. Some of the other animals
picked the pineapple to win,
thinking that it must have a trick
up its sleeve if it was daring to
challenge the hare. But the
pineapple lost because, "pineap
ples don't have sleeves." The sur
real passage was accompanied by
questions that were impossible to
answer definitively, one of them
being, roughly, if the animals ate
the pineapple at the end because
they were hungry or because
they were angry with it for losing.
My first thought was "Who
knows? The whole story is ridicu
lous." But the "smart kids" inter
viewed in the article were able to
correctly agree on the answers the
test writers were looking for.
In test-taking, there is a differ
ence between an answer being
right and an answer being true,
and I think this idea is important
for the real-world analogues to
multiple-choice tests: the dozens
of surveys Stanford inundates us
with. The groups that send out
these surveys are trying to im
prove Stanford life with the data
that they collect, but what if the
survey takers do not interpret the
questions the way the survey writ
ers intend them to? Unlike our
teachers, survey writers do not
have the luxury of dictating which
interpretations are correct they
must simply take the data as it

comes, and try to draw the best
conclusions they can.
A survey taken by the Office of
Alcohol Policy and Education, re
cently published in the Daily,
comes to mind. At Stanford, 73.6
percent of respondents said that
our social atmosphere promotes
alcohol use, while only 47.7 per
cent of respondents to a national
survey made that claim. Does this
mean Stanford has more of a
drinking culture than other
schools?
Just like for the pineapple
questions, I think the answer is,
"Who knows?" Stanford students
might simply be more perceptive
than average college students,
which would make them better
able to see the role of the social
scene in promoting alcohol. The
percentage difference in respons
es could be due to any combina
tion of differences in perceptivity,
real differences in alcohol use,
and still other factors. The same
problem applies to another ques
tion on how central students think
drinking is to Greek life.
This is not to say the survey
wasn't useful; indeed, it revealed
troubling trends about binge
drinking and the number of stu
dents who may be drinking to ex
cess simply because they can't
think of anything else to do with
their weekends.
Survey writers get a lot of re
spect from me for the uphill battles
they're fighting. But as readers, its
our job to be smart test takers and
thoroughly examine the answers.

A survey taken by the Office of
Alcohol Policy and Education, re

If you're a Stanford student,
you've taken an awful lot of
tests in your life, which means
there have probably been times
when you couldn't help wondering
if you were smarter than the test
or at least, more intellectually vig
orous than the TAs were feeling
when they wrote the multiple
choice section at 2 a.m.
Maybe you are steadily filling in
the bubbles until you come to
number 14, where you suddenly
realize that there are two right an
swers. One of them is obvious, and
one of them is subtle, arguable
even, but you remember coming
across a technicality while study
ing that lends it some potential va
lidity. You pick the obvious choice,
of course.
But what if it's one of those
devilish check-all-that-apply situ
ations? You have a problem on
your hands because now the test
isn't just on what you know, but on
what you think the answer key
knows. Do you fill in the extra an
swer, prepared to go in and defend
yourself if you get dinged, or do
you play conservatively, risking
the loss of a point if the test writers
are thinking a little deeper than
you think they are?
If you think on a deep enough
level, there are a lot of multiple
choice questions out there that
have more than one answer.
There might be an obvious way to
read a question, and an obvious
answer that goes with it, and there
might be a less conventional way
to read a question, with another
answer choice that fits with it. One
of the keys of test-taking is to
know how you're supposed to read
the question.

This issue came up in a recent
New York Times article on stan
dardized testing in middle school,
which described how a reading
comprehension passage sparked
controversy among students and
parents for being too far-out. The
passage in question involved a
race between a pineapple and
hare. Some of the other animals
picked the pineapple to win,
thinking that it must have a trick
up its sleeve if it was daring to
challenge the hare. But the
pineapple lost because, "pineap
ples don't have sleeves." The sur
real passage was accompanied by
questions that were impossible to
answer definitively, one of them
being, roughly, if the animals ate
the pineapple at the end because
they were hungry or because
they were angry with it for losing.
My first thought was "Who
knows? The whole story is ridicu
lous." But the "smart kids" inter
viewed in the article were able to
correctly agree on the answers the
test writers were looking for.
In test-taking, there is a differ
ence between an answer being
right and an answer being true,
and I think this idea is important
for the real-world analogues to
multiple-choice tests: the dozens
of surveys Stanford inundates us
with. The groups that send out
these surveys are trying to im
prove Stanford life with the data
that they collect, but what if the
survey takers do not interpret the
questions the way the survey writ
ers intend them to? Unlike our
teachers, survey writers do not
have the luxury of dictating which
interpretations are correct they
must simply take the data as it

comes, and try to draw the best
conclusions they can.
