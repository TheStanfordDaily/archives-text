## AD job too vital to rush 
### Jack Blanchat 
Nobody ever says, "Go
east, young man."
Everybody knows
that you have to go
west to make a name
for yourself But (now former) Stan
ford athletic director Bob Bowlsby,
didn't get the message when he was
offered the opportunity of a lifetime
last weekend, and will leave the Farm
to take over the Big 12 in June.
Now that the dust has settled over
Bowlsby's departure, everybody has
started to throw out their ideas of
who should succeed the man I like to
call the Bowldozer. But when you
think about those names out there,
it's important for the Stanford fans
and administration to ask them
selves: Just how important is it to hire
a good athletic director?
The athletic director position is
not one to be taken lightly. After the
President of the University, I think it's
pretty safe to say that the second
most important person on campus is
the athletic director. Whether or not
that's the "right thing" is another
issue, but the fact remains that a good
athletic department can benefit a
school in innumerable ways.
First of all, the athletic director is
someone who is responsible for the
success or failure of every single
sports team to some degree. The AD
directly hires new coaches and is crit
ically important in fundraising for
new facilities, mostly by courting big
boosters to give their hard-earned
money to the school. If an AD does
these things well, it benefits the stu
dent population and the reputation
of the school by bringing more atten
tion and money to the campus. For
example, how many of the school
record 36,744 high school seniors that
applied to Stanford this year were at
tracted by the successful football
team? (Another great example is
how applications to Butler Universi
ty went up by 41 percent after the bas
ketball Bulldogs nearly knocked off
Duke to win an NCAA title two
years ago.)
That butterfly effect of one good
hire shows just how important it is to
pick a person who knows what he or
she is doing and has a clear vision for
the future that will keep an athletic
department's teams from stagnating
or getting worse.
On a tangential, yet related note,
that's why it worries me when people
bandy about the idea of having Con
doleezza Rice as the next athletic di
rector here at Stanford. While she
might be one of the world's most
knowledgeable people about Ameri
can foreign policy, she's wholly un
qualified to lead an athletic depart
ment. Getting your face on TV at
every women's basketball game
doesn't mean you are the right person
to control one of the most successful
athletic departments in the country.
Returning to the point at hand,
though, the responsibilities of an ath
letic director don't just end with hir
ing coaches and raising funds. There
are times when an athletic director
sometimes may also have to exercise
their power and make ugly or unpop
ular decisions in order to best benefit
the school.
In 2009, Florida State athletic di
rector Randy Spetman had to force
out legendary Seminoles coach
Bobby Bowden, who had been with
the school for 33 years and collected
two national titles and 12 ACC titles
on his way to totaling the second
most wins in college football history.
Bowden's tenure had turned south
in the late 2000s, with the program
going from a perennial national title
contender to a rather mediocre
squad, and Spetman eventually had
to find away to jumpstart the pro
gram. That meant he and university
president T.K. Wetherell had to do
the most unpopular thing possible
and fire Bobby Bowden a com
plicated and controversial move
that left Spetman and Wetherell
under fire from all sides. Now, the

Seminoles are on the right track
once again, bringing in good recruit
ing classes and preseason rankings
(yes, I know that they did collapse to
No. 23 after this year's preseason
No. 5 ranking), and a lot of that is
due to Spetman's unpopular deci
sion.
Whomever Stanford decides to
hire, it's also essential to remember
that an athletic director's impact isn't
often felt until a few years down the
road in their tenure. For example, in
Bowlsby's first year on the Farm, he
hired Jim Harbaugh from Division l-
AA San Diego to lead the Cardinal
football program. While Flarbaugh
had led the Toreros to back-to-back
I-AA National Championships be
fore coming to Stanford, nobody
could have guessed at the time that
Bowlsby's hire would turn the foot
ball team into a national champi
onship contender.
Altogether, it's important to scru
tinize the candidates in line to take
over on the Farm because one of
these people could be making a dif
ference for the Cardinal for decades
to come. And that's not something to
take lightly.

Jack Blanchat isn't going to throw
his name into the mix for AD, buthe
wouldn't really mind if you did. Give
him interview tips at blanchat@stan
