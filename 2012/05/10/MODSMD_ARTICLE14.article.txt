## AD job too vital to rush 
### Jack Blanchat 
Nobody ever says, "Go
east, young man."
Everybody knows
that you have to go
west to make a name
for yourself But (now former) Stan
ford athletic director Bob Bowlsby,
didn't get the message when he was
offered the opportunity of a lifetime
last weekend, and will leave the Farm
to take over the Big 12 in June.
Now that the dust has settled over
Bowlsby's departure, everybody has
started to throw out their ideas of
who should succeed the man I like to
call the Bowldozer. But when you
think about those names out there,
it's important for the Stanford fans
and administration to ask them
selves: Just how important is it to hire
a good athletic director?
The athletic director position is
not one to be taken lightly. After the
President of the University, I think it's
pretty safe to say that the second
most important person on campus is
the athletic director. Whether or not
that's the "right thing" is another
issue, but the fact remains that a good
athletic department can benefit a
school in innumerable ways.
First of all, the athletic director is
someone who is responsible for the
success or failure of every single
sports team to some degree. The AD
directly hires new coaches and is crit
ically important in fundraising for
new facilities, mostly by courting big
boosters to give their hard-earned
money to the school. If an AD does
these things well, it benefits the stu
dent population and the reputation
of the school by bringing more atten
tion and money to the campus. For
example, how many of the school
record 36,744 high school seniors that
applied to Stanford this year were at
tracted by the successful football
team? (Another great example is
how applications to Butler Universi
ty went up by 41 percent after the bas
ketball Bulldogs nearly knocked off
Duke to win an NCAA title two
years ago.)
That butterfly effect of one good
hire shows just how important it is to
pick a person who knows what he or
she is doing and has a clear vision for
the future that will keep an athletic
department's teams from stagnating
or getting worse.
On a tangential, yet related note,
that's why it worries me when people
bandy about the idea of having Con
doleezza Rice as the next athletic di
rector here at Stanford. While she
might be one of the world's most
knowledgeable people about Ameri
can foreign policy, she's wholly un
qualified to lead an athletic depart
ment. Getting your face on TV at
every women's basketball game
doesn't mean you are the right person
