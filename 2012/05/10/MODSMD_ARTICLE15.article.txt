## WOMEN'S TENNIS KICKS OFF NCAAs 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
It's finally May Madness in the world of
college tennis, and the Stanford women's
team is looking to avenge its heartbreaking
loss in last year's NCAA championship
match with a victory this year. The players
have asserted time and time again that hoist
ing the trophy is their main goal, and this
weekend they begin their quest for the title.
"The ultimate goal is definitely to win
NCAAs," said junior Mallory Burdette. "Our
first stepping stone this year was the rematch
against Florida in February, and once we
overcame that hurdle, we focused on winning
the Pac-12 title. Now that we are Pac-12 co
champions, all of our focus has shifted to the

NCAA tournament."
It's been a successful year for No. 5 Stan
ford (18-1,9-1 Pac-12), which is seeded No. 4
in the 64-team tournament. The first and sec
ond rounds are held this weekend at 16 differ
ent campus sites, one of those being the Farm.
The last four rounds, including the champi
onship, will be played May 17-28 at the Dan
Magill Tennis Center in Athens, Ga.
Stanford has had a short break since its ap
pearance in Ojai,in which the Cardinal swept
Washington State 7-0 in the final regular sea
son match and followed that with strong indi
vidual showings at the Pac-12 tournament.
Stanford sophomore Nicole Gibbs, who has
manned court one for the Cardinal all season,
took the Pac-12 singles championship, and
Gibbs, along with Burdette, made it all the

way to the doubles final before falling to
USC's pairing of Kaitlyn Christian and Sabri
na Santamaria 6-4,6-4.
"[Nicole] and I had several confidence
building matches throughout the tourna
ment," Burdette said. "Even though we didn't
pull through in the finals, we learned a lot
about USC's No. 1 team, and I think we will
know exactly what to expect from them next
time. The Pac-12 tournament is also really
tough in that we play up to three matches in
one day, but it's great preparation for
NCAAs where we will also be playing a lot of
tennis over a two-week period."
Although the anticipation is intensifying,
the time off between Pac-12s and NCAAs has
actually benefitted Stanford's small, eight
person squad.
"We knew that we were going to have a
smaller team this year," Burdette said. "And it
definitely has put more pressure on each of us
to remain healthy and to stay on top of our
game. It's that time of the season where parts
of my body are breaking down, and it was re
ally important that I took a few days off after
playing so many matches in a short period of
time."
The few days allowed the Cardinal to
renew and refocus before the "Big Dance," as
Burdette put it.
"I personally needed to recharge, fine
tune my game and mentally prepare for the
NCAAs," said freshman Ellen Tsay. "And, of
course, to build up for the excitement and sus
pense of the biggest event of the year."
"We have been pushing really hard for
shorter periods of time," Burdette added. "I
think we've had our best practices of the year
in the past week or so. The bottom line is that
we really need contributions from every per
son in order to reach our goal of bringing
home another title."
The Cardinal faces Stony Brook (14-7) on
Friday in the first round. Led by junior Nini
Lagvilava and freshman Polina Movchan,
Stony Brook won its first American East
tournament title over Maryland-Baltimore
County 4-2, ensuring its bid to NCAAs. This
Friday will be the first time the two teams
meet.
If Stanford were to defeat Stony Brook, it
would face the winner of No. 41 St. Mary's
and No. 28 Yale in the second round on Satur
day. If Stanford can get past these two match
es, it will travel to Athens, where it could face
its first seeded opponent of the tournament,
No. 13 Northwestern, in the third round. If
seeds hold, Stanford would square off with its
Pac-12 co-champion, fifth-seeded USC.
Both Friday and Saturday are expected to
be extremely warm days, but the Stanford
players said the weather should help them
prepare for the next few rounds.
"I am actually really happy that it is going
to be really hot this weekend because it will
be great preparation for the Southern heat
that we will surely deal with in Athens if we
make it," Burdette said. "I have done a few
sessions of Bikram yoga in order to prepare
for the heat."

The action begins when Yale and Saint
Mary's face off at 11 a.m. at Taube Family
Tennis Center on Friday, followed by the
Stanford-Stony Brook match at 2 p.m. The
winners of these two matches will face off at 3
p.m on Saturday.
