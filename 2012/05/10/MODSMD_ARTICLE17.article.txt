## Women's water polo begins National Collegiate Championship 
### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
The No. 2 Stanford women's water polo team will
look to repeat as national champions when it travels
to San Diego this weekend for the National Colle
giate Championship.
The Cardinal (23-2) is the top seed in the eight
team field despite losing in the title game of the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) tour
nament, 8-7 to UCLA. The Bruins (21-3) are the No.
2 seed this weekend, meaning the top two teams in
the country could meet in Sunday's championship

game. Stanford and UCLA have split their four
meetings this year, while the pair has gone a com
bined 40-1 against everyone else.
First up for Stanford in the quarterfinals is No. 8-
seed Pomona-Pitzer. The Sagehens qualified for the
National Collegiate Championship by winning the
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Con
ference (SCIAC) tournament with a triple-overtime
win in the championship game over Redlands.
Pomona-Pitzer has gone 21-16, but that includes a
15-0 record against Division-11l teams. The defend

The No. 2 Stanford women's water polo team will try to bounce back from only its second loss of the year when
it begins the National Collegiate Championship on Friday. The Cardinal will face eighth-seeded Pomona-Pitzer.
national quarterfinal, Stanford
pounded the Sagehens 23-3.
If the Cardinal can repeat that
feat in Friday's quarterfinal, it
will take on the winner of Loyola
Marymount and UC-Irvine.
Stanford has faced each team
once in 2012, winning 17-2 and
17-5, respectively. On the other
half of the bracket, UCLA could
meet No. 3-seed USC in a rivalry
semifinal. The Bruins have beat
en their cross-town foes in all
three meetings this year, but each
game has been decided by only
one goal.
Stanford won the national
title last year, its second in 10
years, by knocking off archrival
Cal in the final. The Golden
Bears did not qualify for the tour

nament this year after falling to
USC in the third-place game at
the MPSF tournament.
Despite being the top seed
once again, this year's Cardinal
team is significantly different
from last year's squad. The 2011
team had four players named to
the All-Tournament Team, and
none of the four is playing on this
year's team. Instead, Stanford
has relied on MPSF newcomer of
the year Kiley Neushul, who
leads the team with 55 goals,
freshman Ashley Grossman and
returners Kaley Dodson and
Alyssa Lo. Overall, Stanford
leads the MPSF in both goals per
game and goals allowed per
game.
The Cardinal's title defense
starts Friday night at 6:30 p.m. on
the campus of San Diego State.
The championship match will be
Sunday night at 8:15 p.m.
