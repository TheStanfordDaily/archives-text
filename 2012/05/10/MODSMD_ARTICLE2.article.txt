# SUES proposes 'helix' courses
## Faculty College works to develop new interdisciplinary course groupings 
### AARON SEKHRI STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's traditional sys
tem of self-contained courses
could soon be upended by rec
ommendations by the Study of
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES), which advo
cates the introduction of "helix
courses" to address "curricular
incoherence" in undergraduate
coursework.
The SUES report describes
the proposed helix system as
"conceptually intertwined"
groupings of three or more
courses, with a common focus
on "questions and concerns
that influence and are influ
enced by multiple disciplines."
Students would take as many of
the courses as they desire, and
would be able to do so in no
predetermined order.
"One of the things that
struck us in the course of our in
vestigation was how segmented
[and] how silo-ized students'
lives were," said James Camp
bell, history professor and co

chair of the SUES committee.
"They had majors, General Ed
ucation Requirements [and]
they were doing some service
work perhaps, but rarely were
those experiences coming to
gether in some creative or syn
thetic way."
According to Campbell, the
report emphasizes "adaptive
learning" and "fostering con
nections" because rapid global
changes mean students will
likely confront challenges that
cannot currently be foreseen.
"Those students who will
flourish will be those who are
not simply guarded from pro
fessional obsolescence by their
study, but those who have the
capacity to continue to learn
and connect the things they
know," Campbell said.
The SUES report noted a
positive response to the helix
concept from faculty members,
adding that the program should
pose fewer problems in imple
mentation than other recom
mendations advanced by the
SUES committee.

Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Harry
Elam, however, wrote in an
email to The Daily that there
currently exist "a few guiding
principles, but not a lot of de
tail."
According to Elam, Faculty
College a program started
this year to establish cross-dis
ciplinary teaching endeavors

will play a role in developing
these helix courses. He also
highlighted the efforts of his of
fice to help coordinate the pro
gram's agenda.
"We expect to have a sec
tion of Explore Courses as well
as space on our new and im
proved Undergraduate Aca-


M.J MA/The Stanford Daily
demic Life website devoted to
helix offerings," Elam said.
Christopher Gardner, a pro
fessor at the Stanford School of
Medicine, will join the Faculty
College for the 2012-13 academic
year. He described the project as
establishing a "deliverable design
that creates a class or set of class
es."
Repeating Campbell's senti
ment that solving challenges in
the future will involve rigorous
and multidisciplinary thinking
skills, Gardner said, "Stanford in
particular is best placed to ap
proach this kind of learning be
cause it has seven incredible
schools in such close proximity."
Based on his specialty of nutri
tion science, Gardner expressed
support for a food-oriented helix,
or potentially a food systems
minor. He argued that a uniting
theme such as food security
would make for "more com
pelling and better helix courses."
Other faculty expressed more
cautious sentiments.
Computer science professor
Terry Winograd stressed his sup
port for multidisciplinary pro
grams, but questioned the viabili
ty of the helix program, asking
"whether or not faculty would
shift their courses to make them
accessible to non-majors, which is
a big thing to ask of faculty."

Gardner, however, remained
optimistic about the future of the
helix proposal, highlighting the
benefits of exposing individuals
to new material and indeed new
ways of thinking. Discussing a
food summit at which speakers
were asked to give a hypothesis
on an issue, Gardner said he
noted different procedural meth
ods across departments.
"I remember Debra Dunn,
who's at the d.school, coming to
me and saying, 'Look, we don't
have hypotheses in the d.school.
We run an iterative design
process and look into peoples'
motivations,"' Gardner said.
"And it was stunning to me to
think, 'Ah, there's a totally differ
ent way of thinking no wonder
I may be stunted in my own pro
ductivity because I don't expose
myself to these cultures.'"
