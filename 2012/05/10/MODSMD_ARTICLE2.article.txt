# SUES proposes 'helix' courses
## Faculty College works to develop new interdisciplinary course groupings 
### AARON SEKHRI STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's traditional sys
tem of self-contained courses
could soon be upended by rec
ommendations by the Study of
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES), which advo
cates the introduction of "helix
courses" to address "curricular
incoherence" in undergraduate
coursework.
The SUES report describes
the proposed helix system as
"conceptually intertwined"
groupings of three or more
courses, with a common focus
on "questions and concerns
that influence and are influ
enced by multiple disciplines."
Students would take as many of
the courses as they desire, and
would be able to do so in no
predetermined order.
"One of the things that
struck us in the course of our in
vestigation was how segmented
[and] how silo-ized students'
lives were," said James Camp
bell, history professor and co

chair of the SUES committee.
"They had majors, General Ed
ucation Requirements [and]
they were doing some service
work perhaps, but rarely were
those experiences coming to
gether in some creative or syn
thetic way."
According to Campbell, the
report emphasizes "adaptive
learning" and "fostering con
nections" because rapid global
changes mean students will
likely confront challenges that
cannot currently be foreseen.
"Those students who will
flourish will be those who are
not simply guarded from pro
fessional obsolescence by their
study, but those who have the
capacity to continue to learn
and connect the things they
know," Campbell said.
The SUES report noted a
positive response to the helix
concept from faculty members,
adding that the program should
pose fewer problems in imple
mentation than other recom
mendations advanced by the
SUES committee.

Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Harry
Elam, however, wrote in an
email to The Daily that there
currently exist "a few guiding
principles, but not a lot of de
tail."
According to Elam, Faculty
College a program started
this year to establish cross-dis
ciplinary teaching endeavors

will play a role in developing
these helix courses. He also
highlighted the efforts of his of
fice to help coordinate the pro
gram's agenda.
