## GSC defers ARP vote, discussion Reps cite lack of awareness among grad community as cause for delay 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC)
returned to the subject of the Alternative
Review Process (ARP) in its final meeting
Wednesday evening, ultimately echoing the
13th Undergraduate Senate's decision to
defer further discussion and voting on the
issue until new representatives take office
next week.
"We don't think that we should be voting
on how the ARP should be written [yet],"
said Justin Brown, current GSC secretary
and last year's GSC co-chair. "We should be
voting on how we need to talk about this
more."
The ARP is a new judicial procedure for
cases involving sexual assault, sexual harass
ment or relationship violence. Certain pro
visions of the procedure such as a lower
standard of proof, a simple majority require
ment for convictions and a diminished abili
ty to cross-examine witnesses have come
under criticism during recent GSC and Sen
ate meetings.
