## GSC defers ARP vote, discussion Reps cite lack of awareness among grad community as cause for delay 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC)
returned to the subject of the Alternative
Review Process (ARP) in its final meeting
Wednesday evening, ultimately echoing the
13th Undergraduate Senate's decision to
defer further discussion and voting on the
issue until new representatives take office
next week.
"We don't think that we should be voting
on how the ARP should be written [yet],"
said Justin Brown, current GSC secretary
and last year's GSC co-chair. "We should be
voting on how we need to talk about this
more."
The ARP is a new judicial procedure for
cases involving sexual assault, sexual harass
ment or relationship violence. Certain pro
visions of the procedure such as a lower
standard of proof, a simple majority require
ment for convictions and a diminished abili
ty to cross-examine witnesses have come
under criticism during recent GSC and Sen
ate meetings.
One area of concern, the re
moval of a clause assuming a de
fendant's innocence, has since
been restored to its original word
ing.
The GSC approved by a roll
call vote a motion by Sjoerd de
Ridder, a GSC at-large represen
tative, to table the ARP bill and
call for additional review by the
Board of Judicial Affairs (BJA) of
the issues within the debate. Six
GSC representatives voted in
favor of the motion, while one
voted against and one abstained.
While the ARP has been under
discussion in the GSC since an
April 18 meeting, Brown and de
Ridder denied any substantive in
ternal disagreement on the ARP's
provisions within the GSC, and at
tributed the prolonged delibera
tion instead to the importance of
the subject under discussion.
"Tonight wasn't really a discus

sion of what ARP should be,"
Brown said.
He added that GSC represen
tatives remain concerned that the
BJA, along with the GSC and the
Undergraduate Senate, has yet to
fully address all potential cases in
which the ARP might be applied.
"Agreeing with the ARP as is
basically states it is perfect," de
Ridder wrote in an email to the
GSC list in late April. "Amending
it, on the fly, when approving it, is
non-constructive, because many
bodies need to agree on the ARP.
Providing a set of opinions is the
responsible thing to do, as it would
give the BJA resources and incen
tives to carefully review the docu
ment."
In discussing the GSC's ap
proach to the issue, de Ridder ex
pressed concern over a lack of
awareness of the ARP's provi
sions, a sentiment shared for the
most part by Brown.
"Getting graduate students'
feedback on this is like pulling
teeth," Brown said. "The vast ma
jority of graduate students don't
even know that this is up for de

bate. This is not something that is
on their radar ... [and] it really
should be."
Brown argued that a lack of
communication between graduate
students and University adminis
trators along with a perception
among graduate students that it is
unlikely they will be exposed to
University disciplinary proceed
ings has led to an alarming gap
in awareness.
"That's really on the adminis
tration to make sure that they can
in an effective way get that
information out to the students,"
Brown said. "There appears to be a
disconnect between students and
the administration about what the
ARP means, and what the conse
quences are."
De Ridder also expressed con
cern over a lack of awareness of
the issue's nuances even among
GSC representatives, a notion that
Brown disputed. De Ridder said
this would make a vote on the
ARP in the upcoming weeks pre
mature.
"I have my own opinions, and
I'm happy to share them, but I'm

concerned that trying to convince
them [other GSC members] of my
standpoint may not be appropri
ate," de Ridder said.
As new GSC representatives
assume office next week, both de
Ridder and Brown said they do
not think there should be any kind
of approaching deadline for ap
proving the ARP, arguing that new
representatives should have the
opportunity to educate them
selves on the issues before voting.
De Ridder asserted that it
would not be excessive to delay
voting on the ARP until next fall,
given the subsequent need for
University ratification.
"I will encourage the Board of
Judicial Affairs and the ASSU Ex
ecutive to come up with a new time
frame [for the discussion of the
ARP]," de Ridder said. "I hope
that they take their time to addi
tionally review the document to
ensure that there is no delay when
the Faculty Senate takes this up in
the fall."

Brown said. "There appears to be a
disconnect between students and
the administration about what the
ARP means, and what the conse
quences are."
De Ridder also expressed con
cern over a lack of awareness of
the issue's nuances even among
GSC representatives, a notion that
Brown disputed. De Ridder said
this would make a vote on the
ARP in the upcoming weeks pre
mature.
"I have my own opinions, and
I'm happy to share them, but I'm

concerned that trying to convince
them [other GSC members] of my
standpoint may not be appropri
ate," de Ridder said.
As new GSC representatives
assume office next week, both de
Ridder and Brown said they do
not think there should be any kind
of approaching deadline for ap
proving the ARP, arguing that new
representatives should have the
opportunity to educate them
selves on the issues before voting.
De Ridder asserted that it
would not be excessive to delay
voting on the ARP until next fall,
given the subsequent need for
University ratification.
"I will encourage the Board of
Judicial Affairs and the ASSU Ex
ecutive to come up with a new time
frame [for the discussion of the
ARP]," de Ridder said. "I hope
that they take their time to addi
tionally review the document to
ensure that there is no delay when
the Faculty Senate takes this up in
the fall."

The Graduate Student Council (GSC)
returned to the subject of the Alternative
Review Process (ARP) in its final meeting
Wednesday evening, ultimately echoing the
13th Undergraduate Senate's decision to
defer further discussion and voting on the
issue until new representatives take office
next week.
"We don't think that we should be voting
on how the ARP should be written [yet],"
said Justin Brown, current GSC secretary
and last year's GSC co-chair. "We should be
voting on how we need to talk about this
more."
The ARP is a new judicial procedure for
cases involving sexual assault, sexual harass
ment or relationship violence. Certain pro
visions of the procedure such as a lower
standard of proof, a simple majority require
ment for convictions and a diminished abili
ty to cross-examine witnesses have come
under criticism during recent GSC and Sen
ate meetings.
One area of concern, the re
moval of a clause assuming a de
fendant's innocence, has since
been restored to its original word
ing.
The GSC approved by a roll
call vote a motion by Sjoerd de
Ridder, a GSC at-large represen
tative, to table the ARP bill and
call for additional review by the
Board of Judicial Affairs (BJA) of
the issues within the debate. Six
GSC representatives voted in
favor of the motion, while one
voted against and one abstained.
While the ARP has been under
discussion in the GSC since an
April 18 meeting, Brown and de
Ridder denied any substantive in
ternal disagreement on the ARP's
provisions within the GSC, and at
tributed the prolonged delibera
tion instead to the importance of
the subject under discussion.
"Tonight wasn't really a discus

sion of what ARP should be,"
Brown said.
He added that GSC represen
tatives remain concerned that the
BJA, along with the GSC and the
Undergraduate Senate, has yet to
fully address all potential cases in
which the ARP might be applied.
"Agreeing with the ARP as is
basically states it is perfect," de
Ridder wrote in an email to the
GSC list in late April. "Amending
it, on the fly, when approving it, is
non-constructive, because many
bodies need to agree on the ARP.
Providing a set of opinions is the
responsible thing to do, as it would
give the BJA resources and incen
tives to carefully review the docu
ment."
In discussing the GSC's ap
proach to the issue, de Ridder ex
pressed concern over a lack of
awareness of the ARP's provi
sions, a sentiment shared for the
most part by Brown.
"Getting graduate students'
feedback on this is like pulling
teeth," Brown said. "The vast ma
jority of graduate students don't
even know that this is up for de

bate. This is not something that is
on their radar ... [and] it really
should be."
Brown argued that a lack of
communication between graduate
students and University adminis
trators along with a perception
among graduate students that it is
unlikely they will be exposed to
University disciplinary proceed
ings has led to an alarming gap
in awareness.
"That's really on the adminis
tration to make sure that they can
in an effective way get that
information out to the students,"
Brown said. "There appears to be a
disconnect between students and
the administration about what the
ARP means, and what the conse
quences are."
De Ridder also expressed con
cern over a lack of awareness of
the issue's nuances even among
