## International health aid not misused, study says 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
A recent study by Stanford re
searchers could reopen the debate
on whether or not international as
sistance for health programs
should be given to government
agencies.
In a report published Tuesday in
Public Library of Science (PLoS)
Medicine, affiliates at Stanford's
Freeman Spogli Institute (FSI) for
International Studies Rajaie
Batniji and Eran Bendavid at
tempt to refute an earlier study
which concluded that funds given
to national governments for the
purpose of health programs are
often wasted or misused.
Researchers at the University
of Washington conducted the first
study in 2010, which was then pub
lished in the medical journal Lancet.
Batniji, a resident physician at the
Stanford Medical Center, told the
Stanford Report that the Lancet ar
ticle is cited to this day as a reason
against giving international health
aid to foreign governments.
Data for the 2010 study came
from the World Health Organiza
tion (WHO) and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
The new study, however, found
that when outlying data such as
discrepancies between the WHO
and IMF estimates were exclud
ed from the analysis, there was not
significant support that govern
ments misdirect foreign aid.
The United States is currently
scheduled to reduce its budget for
international health aid next year
by $lO billion, or 4 percent.
FSl's Global Underdevelop
ment Action Fund provided finan
cial support for the study.
