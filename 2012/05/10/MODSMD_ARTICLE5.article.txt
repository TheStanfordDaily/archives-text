# PAUSD Board supports revised grad requirements
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Kurt Chirbas 
Palo Alto Unified School Dis
trict (PAUSD) board members
discussed a proposal to align dis
trict graduation requirement with
state college entry requirements
at its Tuesday night meeting. The
Board expressed universal sup
port for the plan, on which it will
vote in two weeks.
Under the current proposal,
which was first brought before the
Board nearly a year ago in May
2011, members of the high school
class of 2016 will have to meet re
vised graduation requirements,
such as taking 20 units of a world
language, an additional 10 units of
math and 20 units of lab science
instead of general science.
According to Board minutes,
the original goals of this plan
were to have at least 85 percent of
PAUSD high school graduates
complete an A-G curriculum
the entry requirements for the
University of California (UC)
and California State University
(CSU) systems and to in
crease the number of underrep
resented minority students who
meet these requirements by 50
percent or more.
In January 2012, PAUSD Su
perintendent Kevin Skelly sug
gested a change to the proposal,
which would give students the
choice to create "alternative
graduation requirements" with
the help of parents and school of
ficials. This option, intended for
students who cannot or prefer
not to meet the A-G require
ments, is included in the current
plan.
At Tuesday's meeting, Skelly
read a letter of support for the
proposal from a former student,
according to a Palo Alto Online
article.
"I did not choose wisely as my
parents were not involved back
then," the letter read. "If I had
been forced to fulfill the language
requirements back then it would
have helped me in college and in
life."
In an interview with The Daily
in January, Skelly argued that
many students in high school do
not realize this and often "take
the path of least resistance" if not
pushed by the District.
All five board members pub
licly supported the proposal at
the meeting. The final vote will
take place on May 22.
