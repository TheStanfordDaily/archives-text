## Experts address Cold War, modern nuclear policy 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
"Politics is much harder than
physics we cannot force or co
erce the laws of nature to
change," said Sidney Drell, co
founder of the Center for Inter
national Security and Coopera
tion (CISAC), Wednesday
evening during a discussion
about the politics of nuclear
weapons.
Drell was one of three pan
elists at the event, titled "The
Reykjavik Forum: History and a
New Vision for Our World's Fu
ture."The event was part of a two
day series, which featured short
videos on the history and chal
lenges surrounding nuclear
weapons, a performance of the
play "Reykjavik" by Pulitzer
Prize-winning author Richard
Rhodes and a concluding panel
discussion.
Rhodes and Charles Fergu
son, president of the Federation
of American Scientists, joined

Drell on the panel. Ferguson also
moderated the discussion.
Rhodes' play "Reykjavik" re
counts using actual transcripts
the historic 1986 summit meet
ing between Ronald Reagan and
Mikhail Gorbachev. While the
summit, which sought to address
issues around nuclear weapons
and human rights, attained no
lasting resolution, both sides
hailed it as inducing a break
through in relations.
After the 45-minute play, Fer
guson began the discussion by
highlighting the larger purpose of
the event.
"We want to create some
videos that go viral like the Kony
one," Ferguson said. "[ln this
way] we can try to put pressure on
political leaders so they feel a
greater urgency to act to prevent
nuclear terrorism and to take fur
ther steps to reduce arms in a re
sponsible way."
Ferguson offered an opti
mistic outlook, adding, "Hopeful
ly one day we can reach a nuclear

free world."
Drell expanded on Ferguson's
points by providing the perspec
tive of a scientist, with extensive
involvement in advising and poli
cymaking. Drell previously
served as deputy director of the
SLAC National Accelerator Lab
oratory.
"The obligation of the scientif
ic community is to see that the
role of technology is used for the
benefit of mankind," Drell said.
"We work to guide government
leaders. Everything has got to be
based upon scientific facts."
Rhodes provided a more his
torical view of nuclear politics,
tracing the history of nuclear de
velopments and relations. Fie ar
gued that the idea of "common
security" that nations should
strive for the safety of all other
countries is key.
According to Rhodes, Reagan
had told his advisers prior to the
Republican National Convention
in 1980 that one of the main rea
sons he wanted to be elected

president was to abolish nuclear
weapons.
"But that was where the miss
ing piece of the puzzle came in,"
Rhodes said in explaining Rea
gan's eventual advocacy of the
Strategic Defense Initiative,
which would have established an
American space-based missile
shield to prevent against nuclear
attack. "How do you prevent the
other side from cheating?"
Drell drew on the play's at
mosphere of mutual suspicion in
advocating the idea of "trust, but
verify."
"Reagan was very right in in
sisting about 'trust but verify,"'
Drell said. "The Russians were
cheating during this period [of ne
gotiations] and that's a fact."
Drell continued by emphasiz
ing that today's nuclear threats are
different than those faced by su
perpowers during the Cold War.
"Twenty years later, the ques
tion of how do you get rid of nu

clear weapons is now focused on
how some evil and rogue people
can get their hands on weapons to
go on a suicide mission," he said.
With regards to Obama's cur
rent policy on nuclear weapons,
Drell described it as a "frustrat
ingly slow march" toward a less
nuclear world.
A lively question and answer
session followed the discussion,
with audience questioning initial
ly focusing on contemporary
geopolitics.

"One of the most fundamental
changes we have been moving to
wards is to think of [the issue of]
nuclear weapons not as good guys
versus bad guys, but that the
weapons themselves are ultimate
ly the danger," Rhodes said in
reply to a question on Iran's nu
clear weapons policy. "The last
thing anyone wants is a war with
Iran, or a war between Israel and
Iran, and I don't think Iran wants
that either."
Other questions concerned is
sues from the disposal of nuclear
waste to the handling of nuclear
weapons in states that broke away
from the USSR in 1991.
"It is fantastic living so close to
Stanford where there are so many

people contributing to advances
in peace and technology," said au
dience member Mark Weiss, a
community member. "People like
Dr. Drell are legends in their fields
and are such a great resource."
The Federation of American
Scientists, the National Center for
New Plays, the Fund for Peace Ini
tiatives, CISAC, the Center for
Ethics in Society and Stanford
Continuing Studies co-sponsored
the event.
The Ethics and War series will
conclude next Wednesday with a
discussion of ethical challenges
yet to come.
