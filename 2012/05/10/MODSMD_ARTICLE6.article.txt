## Experts address Cold War, modern nuclear policy 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
"Politics is much harder than
physics we cannot force or co
erce the laws of nature to
change," said Sidney Drell, co
founder of the Center for Inter
national Security and Coopera
tion (CISAC), Wednesday
evening during a discussion
about the politics of nuclear
weapons.
Drell was one of three pan
elists at the event, titled "The
Reykjavik Forum: History and a
New Vision for Our World's Fu
ture."The event was part of a two
day series, which featured short
videos on the history and chal
lenges surrounding nuclear
weapons, a performance of the
play "Reykjavik" by Pulitzer
Prize-winning author Richard
Rhodes and a concluding panel
discussion.
Rhodes and Charles Fergu
son, president of the Federation
of American Scientists, joined

Drell on the panel. Ferguson also
moderated the discussion.
Rhodes' play "Reykjavik" re
counts using actual transcripts
the historic 1986 summit meet
ing between Ronald Reagan and
Mikhail Gorbachev. While the
summit, which sought to address
issues around nuclear weapons
and human rights, attained no
lasting resolution, both sides
hailed it as inducing a break
through in relations.
After the 45-minute play, Fer
guson began the discussion by
highlighting the larger purpose of
the event.
"We want to create some
videos that go viral like the Kony
one," Ferguson said. "[ln this
way] we can try to put pressure on
political leaders so they feel a
greater urgency to act to prevent
nuclear terrorism and to take fur
ther steps to reduce arms in a re
sponsible way."
Ferguson offered an opti
mistic outlook, adding, "Hopeful
ly one day we can reach a nuclear

free world."
Drell expanded on Ferguson's
points by providing the perspec
tive of a scientist, with extensive
involvement in advising and poli
cymaking. Drell previously
served as deputy director of the
SLAC National Accelerator Lab
oratory.
"The obligation of the scientif
ic community is to see that the
role of technology is used for the
benefit of mankind," Drell said.
"We work to guide government
leaders. Everything has got to be
based upon scientific facts."
Rhodes provided a more his
torical view of nuclear politics,
tracing the history of nuclear de
velopments and relations. Fie ar
gued that the idea of "common
security" that nations should
strive for the safety of all other
countries is key.
According to Rhodes, Reagan
had told his advisers prior to the
Republican National Convention
in 1980 that one of the main rea
sons he wanted to be elected

president was to abolish nuclear
weapons.
"But that was where the miss
ing piece of the puzzle came in,"
Rhodes said in explaining Rea
gan's eventual advocacy of the
Strategic Defense Initiative,
which would have established an
American space-based missile
shield to prevent against nuclear
attack. "How do you prevent the
other side from cheating?"
Drell drew on the play's at
mosphere of mutual suspicion in
advocating the idea of "trust, but
verify."
"Reagan was very right in in
sisting about 'trust but verify,"'
Drell said. "The Russians were
cheating during this period [of ne
gotiations] and that's a fact."
Drell continued by emphasiz
ing that today's nuclear threats are
different than those faced by su
perpowers during the Cold War.
"Twenty years later, the ques
tion of how do you get rid of nu
