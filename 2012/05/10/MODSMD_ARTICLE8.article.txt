## Report on state education shows little progress 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Five years after a study by Stan
ford researchers called for reform
and increased investment in Cali
fornia's public education system,
progress has been at best under
whelming and inconsistent, accord
ing to a new report from the inde
pendent Policy Analysis for Cali
fornia Education (PACE) research
center.
"Our initial optimism was clear
ly unwarranted," wrote Susanna
Loeb, professor of education and
director of PACE, in the new re
port's introduction. Loeb added
that the "past five years have seen
only small improvements on the
problems identified" in the original
report.
The initial study, titled "Getting
Down to Facts," sought to promote
policies encouraging better gover
nance and administration within
the educational sector, as well as
the simplification of education fi
nance and development of a com
prehensive state data system. The
study was met with approval by
state legislative leaders and then

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who
proclaimed 2008 to be the "Year of
Education" in California.
"In 2007, it appeared the time
frame for comprehensive and
structural reform was relatively
short," said David Plank, professor
of education and PACE executive
director. "The idea was that this was
something that could be done on a
relatively short timeline."
According to Plank, the onset of
economic recession and
Schwarzenegger's subsequent
pivot to address California's deteri
orating finances contributed to
the failure of state legislators to fol
low through on the study's recom
mendations. The PACE report
noted that state general funding
was 15 percent lower by the end of
2009 than at its peak in 2007-2008.
"A lot of needed policy reforms
were put on hold because of the
budget crisis," Plank said. "Once
the governor backed away from his
own committee [on education re
form], the timeline was extended
quite a long way."
This lack of funding could be
further exacerbated this Novem
ber, as Californians vote on a budg-

et proposal by Gov. Jerry Brown
that would either raise income and
sales taxes or cut a further $5.3 bil
lion from state welfare and public
school spending. Plank commented
in a Jan. 18 Daily article that the
prospect of such cuts would only
contribute to an already "awful" sit
uation in state public schools.
The PACE report identified
areas in which the "Getting Down
to Facts" recommendations have
either been implemented or are
currently under discussion, such as
data-driven analyses of student
performance and greater devolu
tion of resources and accountabili
ty to local levels.
Plank singled out the develop
ment of a comprehensive student
data system as an area of consider
able progress. He added, though,
that this may be compromised by a
veto from Brown on funding for a
similar effort to collate teacher in
formation.
"California has very high expec
tations for what we expect schools,
students [and] teachers to do, and
we hold them accountable for that
performance," Plank said. "The
only way that we can do that fairly

and accurately is if we have com
prehensive data."
While acknowledging that the
political and economic atmosphere
has changed significantly since
2007, Plank argued that the majori
ty of PACE'S recommendations are
still relevant and necessary.
"The general argument of "Get
ting Down to Facts" that Cali
fornia needs to spend more money
to ensure that all children can reach
the standards the state has set, but
that spending money in the way we
spend it now will not be sufficient
is still exactly true," Plank assert
ed.
PACE researchers expressed
cautious optimism, however, that
the economic recovery and recent
efforts by Brown to address educa
tion finance may signal a belated
return to the "Getting Down to
Facts" proposals.
"There has been progress,"
Plank said. "There are many rea
sons in 2012 to be optimistic that
the moment for significant reform
may be coming back."

prehensive data."
While acknowledging that the
political and economic atmosphere
has changed significantly since
2007, Plank argued that the majori
ty of PACE'S recommendations are
still relevant and necessary.
"The general argument of "Get
ting Down to Facts" that Cali
fornia needs to spend more money
to ensure that all children can reach
the standards the state has set, but
that spending money in the way we
spend it now will not be sufficient
is still exactly true," Plank assert
ed.
PACE researchers expressed
cautious optimism, however, that
the economic recovery and recent
efforts by Brown to address educa
tion finance may signal a belated
return to the "Getting Down to
Facts" proposals.
"There has been progress,"
Plank said. "There are many rea
sons in 2012 to be optimistic that
the moment for significant reform
may be coming back."
