a-w-n America, I won't
I be doing this in my
I head, I'll be doing it
I on a calculator.
-A-Since you are not
providing me with a calculator, I
will skip this question."
This tongue-in-cheek remark
was Nayoung Woo's recollection
of her response to a question on
polynomial calculus during an in
terview. The interview was for a
scholarship from her government
in South Korea to study science at
Stanford, which fewer than 10 stu
dents that year including Woo
received. The competition was
made more difficult by the fact
that Woo was on a literature, not
science, track in high school.
Although Nayoung Woo 'l2
will be graduating this spring with
a bachelor's degree in chemistry,
her involvement in many activi
ties at Stanford reflects the diver
sity of her academic interests. She
was a student representative on
the Study of Undergraduate Edu
cation at Stanford (SUES) com
mittee, which included two stu
dent representatives and a dozen
professors. The SUES committee
released a report in January that
examined and gave recommenda
tions about many aspects of un
dergraduate life, from general ed
ucation requirements (GERs) to
overseas studies.This report led to
several changes, including the re
placement of the Introduction to
the Humanities (IHUM) pro
gram. Woo, who served as a stu
dent ambassador during the re
view process, helped the commit
tee ensure the recommendations
would not negatively impact stu
dents and hold meetings to report
directly to students.

"Once we got our gears rolling
[we] met with students every
week," Woo said. "We mostly
stormed dining halls but also met
with point groups to talk to every
one."
While Woo values academics,
her strongest passions lie in her
work with the Asian LGBTQ
community. This passion started
before she came to Stanford,
when she did research on
HIV/AIDS in South Korea, fo
cusing on two of the most at-risk
communities sex workers and
homosexuals.
Woo wanted to continue her
work when she came to Stanford
and became actively involved in
the Asian LGBTQ community,
eventually identifying problems
in the community she believed
many were ignoring. Woo strug
gled to decide how to start the
conversations.
"I didn't want to just write
about it," Woo said. "I didn't think
that any demographic study or
any fictional writing that I could
have done would have given jus
tice to that community, so I
learned filmmaking."
Armed with the medium of
film, Woo made "Should Be,
Could Be, But Is," a documentary
following a gay Korean student
and his experiences upon his ar
rival at Stanford.
According to Woo, her doc
umentary evokes a strong reac
tion in the audience due the
raw footage and emotional tes
timonials.
"For an average straight per
son I think that they will feel
shock," Woo said. "They think
that there is only one queer com
munity, one way to be gay."
This message that being
gay does not mean one thing

has resonated with the broader
LGBTQ community at Stanford.
Since Woo made the documen
tary, Intersections a weeklong
event focused on the intersec
tions of race and sexuality has
taken place annually on campus.
Woo agreed with her documen
tary subjects to restrict the film's
availability because of the sensi
tivity of LGTBQ issues in their
communities and in South Korea.
Despite strict privacy agreements
that only allow the documentary
to be shown when Woo is present,
"Should Be, Could Be, But Is" has
already been screened for many
campus groups. This summer,
Woo will present her documen
tary at the National Queer Asian
Pacific Islander Association con
ference in Washington, D.C.
Woo fulfilled the class re
quirements for the Ethics in Soci
ety honors program, but decided
to spend her last few months at
Stanford working on another
documentary on the Asian
Queer community instead of
completing a thesis. When she
graduates this spring, she will be a
Fellow of the Coro Program in
Public Affairs a full-time,
nine-month, graduate-level
training program in New York
City which prepares fellows as
piring to work in public affairs.
The road to Woo's accom
plishments was opened with that
fateful scholarship interview.
While Woo's spunky response
must have resonated well with
the interviewers after all, she
did receive the scholarship
Woo was not so sure at the time.
"It is probably the worst inter
view that I've ever had," she said.
