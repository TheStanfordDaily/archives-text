How I Write: A Conversation with Thomas Hare
Monday, May 14
7:30 pm
Stanford Humanities Center
(424 Santa Teresa Street)
Free, open to the public
Thomas Hare is Professor of Comparative Literature at Princeton. His
interests range from the interaction of Buddhism with the arts in traditional
Japan to the representational systems of ancient Egypt. His books include
Zeami: Performance Notes and Zeamis Style: The Nob Plays of Zeami,
offering translations and critical analysis of works by the important Noh
dramatist. His current project, Performance and Practice in Sucfcffi/st
Japan, looks closely at the interaction between Buddhist practice and the
performance of four Japanese arts during the medieval
and early modern period in order to better understand how "practice" is
conceived outside a monastic context.
Join Hilton Obenzinger, a fiction and nonaction writer, and lecturer in the
Stanford Department of English, American Studies and Continuing Studies,
as he engages Thomas Hare in conversation, focusing on the techniques,
quirks, and joys of writing.
