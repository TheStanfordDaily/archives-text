## First names first 
### Miriam Marks 
How often do you use your
friends' first names? Now
that you think about it, is it
really that often? You only have to
use their name if you want get their
attention from across the dining
hall, right? You could probably go
for days, weeks or even months just
by using "dude" instead.
There's probably nothing
wrong with this at all. But some
times, rather than not use a name
for someone you know, you have
to choose whether to use a name
for someone you don't know. Was
that too confusing? Here's the
story.

A few weeks ago I had a phone
interview. It was conveniently
arranged for me via email a few
days in advance, and the mysteri
ous woman at the other computer
informed me that I'd be speaking
with "George." And so, when I
lugged myself out of bed at 8:45
a.m., I was prepared to pick up the
phone for a nice, early 9 a.m. chat
with George himself.
At 9:01 a.m., the phone rang.
"Hello?" I knew exactly who it
would be, but obviously I couldn't
open with, "Hey you must be the
guy from , right?" So I
left it at hello.

"Hello, is this Miriam?"
"Hi George! Yes, this is Miri
am." Yes, I had jumped the gun a
little bit. I used his name before he
introduced himself. But come on, I
was pretty excited to know that it
was George on the line, and not
some random wrong number.
There was a pause.
"Wow, you just called me
'George,'" the voice said. Oh no, I
had blown it. He probably went by
"Jorge" or "Georgey" or "G
-money," and I had already brought

back some terrifying childhood
memory when the kids made fun
of his name. I didn't know what to
say.

"Um ... yes? Is that okay?" It
was the worst response I could've
come up with. I wanted to crawl
under my desk (not that it mat
tered because I was alone in my
room). I wanted to hang up the
phone.
"I'm just surprised ..." What
was he surprised about? Maybe
my voice didn't sound like what he
expected, maybe I butchered the
pronunciation of his name, maybe
maybe maybe ...
"... No one has ever called me
by my name in an interview!"
I should've been able to tell by
his tone that he was happy about
this strange turn of events, but I
stupidly kept it going.
"Oh! Well is it okay that I did?
Did you like it?" If I hadn't semi
blown it before, I certainly had
now.

Thankfully, he chuckled. "Yes,
that's not a bad thing."
The rest of my interview with
George went pretty well. And
since our chat, I can't help but
think about his pleasant surprise at
my use of his name.
We hadn't physically met, and
yet the mutual use of first names
was unexpectedly significant. It
makes sense. Thinking about peo
ple in terms of their names tends to
remind us that they're individuals
too they're not just the cashier,
the waitress or the nameless phone
interviewer.

Obviously it might be imprac
tical to go around pointedly using
all of your friends' first names.
But maybe it won't hurt to slip
them into conversation a little bit

more, to add the ever-so-slight in
timacy that comes with first name
usage.

If this sounds crazy, think about
how you feel when someone for
gets your first name. It's kind of an
noying, right? You feel that nag
ging insecurity that you must not
be special enough for them to re
member you. Maybe your outfit
was too plain or your personality
was too boring. Or maybe you
need a more interesting name,
something short and catchy like
"Miriam."

If you're one of those people
who's bad with names, don't be
afraid to let it be known with an
advance warning. Because other
wise, you might get yourself in a
bad situation.
A friend of mine was once at a
party, obtaining one of the infa
mous mixed drinks readily avail
able at the Phi Psi bar. Turning
around, she found that a guy had
smoothly sidled up to her and
opened with a relatively lackluster
pick-up line. But it got worse: then
he asked her name.

The problem? She had met him
before ... five times before. And
yet somehow she had never been
as interesting to him as she was on
that particular Friday night.
And so, never forget the value
of using a first name. It can help
you get a job, help you make a
friend, and it can probably save
you some embarrassment.

If you remember her first name, go
