# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## Celebrating Stanford Cats 
### 
Dear Editor,
The pioneering TNR (Trap-
Neuter-Return) program of the
Stanford Cat Network featured in
The Daily ("Cat tales," May 9) has
succeeded in humanely reducing
the campus homeless cat popula
tion from 500 in 'B9 to a few dozen
healthy, feral (unsocialized) cats
through spay/neuter, adoption and
natural attrition. It also has been a
personally-fulfilling and mutually
enriching journey, as it has evolved
and adapted to assure continued
care of the cats. The seemingly end
less supply will continue, until we
spay/neuter our pets, reducing the
population of unwanted animals to
match the demand of loving homes
for them.

Despite being tired or busy or
the weather being dismal, the cats
must be fed. I welcome the peace
ful, restorative routine of my daily
feeding rounds for my feline
friends. I feel personally violated
and concerned for the cats' safety
when feeding stations are dis
turbed by intruders. Ours is a mis
sion of compassion for these cats
who are victims of our human
shortcomings.

Rescued tame newcomers need
a comforting, secure holding place
until foster homes are found. Recu
perating feral cats need a quiet, safe
place to recover. We are committed
to no kill, and we find adoptive
homes for healthy, tame cats who
are positive for infectious feline
leukemia. Our new enclosure was
finished just in time to also provide
a home for Milton, feral so un
adoptable. He could not roam

freely on campus; he had nowhere
else to go. Now, he still enjoys a
sheltered life outdoors, where vol
unteers visit and care for him using
isolation techniques to protect him
from disease as well as other cats,
whose health is not compromised.
The FeLv virus is fragile, but it com
promises the immune system of its
host. Know that the homeless cat
population from which most of us
adopt our pets and into which oth
ers lose or abandon them a re
volving door is a generally
healthy population.
Cats lost or abandoned by stu
dents do account for some of the
several newcomers, a fact on resi
dential campuses nationwide. You
seek companionship but may as
sume a responsibility that is too
much for your busy lives in transi
tion. That is why we urge you,
"Don't Adopt" in the fall, then
"Don't Abandon" in the spring, in
emails forwarded by Housing.
There always will be needy pets to
adopt when you are ready for that
commitment.

The SCN always needs volun
teers, and we have urged you to
help us. More students volunteered
to feed, when there were many cats
to see. We see fewer volunteers
now that there are fewer cats. Vol
unteers must feed on faith that
watchful cats are there depending
on them. Our intervention makes
the difference for the cats' survival.

SCN volunteers can't be every
where. We need the Stanford com
munity to be alert for cats that need
help and to know to contact us to
intervene and rescue them.

We invite you to visit our web
site catnet.stanford.edu.
