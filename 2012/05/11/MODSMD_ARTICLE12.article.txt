## Getting around 
### Sebastain Gould 
The Stanford campus is made
for pedestrians, first and
foremost. Many streets that
were passable when I was a fresh
man no longer are, and the campus
is becoming more restricted to
traffic. Parking lots are being
pushed farther and farther from
the academic buildings, and as a re
sult, more people choose to bike
and walk.

This is great for those of us who
don't want to worry about having
to dodge cars in the Quad (al
though occasionally you will have
to jump out of the way of a careless
service vehicle or haphazard golf
cart driver). The bad part about the
campus being so pedestrian-driven
is that students, staff and faculty
with disabilities find it much hard
er to get around.

The number of students at
Stanford who are registered with
the Office of Accessible Education
for disability-related issues was
less than 200 a couple years ago,
but the difficulty in mobility for
those who are registered can be in
surmountable at times. There are
several things that make it difficult
for students in wheelchairs. If you
are temporarily injured and in a
wheelchair, you are presented with
an immediate problem if you live
in one of the many residences on
campus that have multiple stories
and no elevators. The good thing
about Stanford, though, is that it
quickly accommodates such situa
tions and provides the necessary
transfer housing needed. The only
downside is that you have to move
your belongings while injured and
in pain.
Besides housing, simply going
to class can be difficult. Much of
the campus is situated on a giant

hill that slopes down from the Dish
to the Bay, but some parts of cam
pus are much steeper than others.
Going to Florence Moore Hall
and the residences behind it is es
pecially difficult. Another prob
lem is the unevenness of sidewalks
and bike paths. All roads and side
walks have to have a slight grad
ing, or slant, to them, so that the
water will run off. The problem for
individuals in wheelchairs is that
they are constantly rolling in the
direction of the slant, thereby put
ting a great deal of pressure on one
side of their bodies. Of course, this
is something that cannot be
helped, but it is simply another
facet of what it means to be in a
wheelchair.

A good friend of mine has per
manently lost the use of his legs
and has a wheelchair. He lives off
campus with his wife and child and
commutes to campus via his
wheelchair-accessible van. It has a
side lift to help him enter and exit
the van, and without it he would
not be able to go to class. The
handicap spots, then, are of utmost
importance for students with dis
abilities. If he gets to the Oval and
all of the spots are taken, he must
then look for parking elsewhere,
sometimes up to half a mile away.
All of this, plus the time to drive
there and get out of his van, makes
him severely late to class, some
times to the point that he might as
well not go at all.

That brings me to the point of
this week's column: a few weeks
ago I saw a car pull into a parking
space marked for handicapped
people, and a bunch of people
piled out jumping and laughing
and generally carousing. I stared
in disbelief as the group of friends
proceeded to walk away from the
now-parked car, with none of
them showing signs of being in
jured. I assumed that they were
parking there temporarily, until I
saw the red temporary disability
placard in the car. Now, it is possi
ble that the individual driving the
car was injured in some way that
didn't preclude jumping and that
there were no obvious signs of in
jury, but it seemed as though
something wasn't right. I wouldn't
otherwise mind these individuals
taking advantage of the law and
getting a permit that they do not
seem to need, but it does bother
me that my friend often finds cars
with red disability placards in the
parking spaces near his classes. It is
of course completely possible that
the people using them fully need
them, but based on the duration of
time that the cars park in those
spots, day after day, it seems much
more likely that those people are
using them as long as they can, and
not as long as they are injured.

Stanford could create more
parking spaces on campus for indi
viduals with handicapped parking
placards, but that would do noth
ing to stop those who use placards
even when they don't need them.
Instead of accommodating stu
dents who abuse the system, call
your friends out when they do.
