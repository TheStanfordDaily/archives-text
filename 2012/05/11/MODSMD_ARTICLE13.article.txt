## Toilolo: the next star player 
### Joseph Beyda 
As the spring sport sea
son winds down, it's
time for the sports sides
of our brains to start
drifting back to their
cherished equilibrium: college foot
ball.

So with midterms and no Sharks
hockey to distract me (five more
months and counting...), I found
myself sifting through You Tube for
the last few years of Cardinal football
highlights.
Let me rephrase that I found
myself sifting through You Tube for
the last few years of Toby Gerhart
and Andrew Luck highlights.

Ask me about Stanford football
and I'll tell you as quickly as anyone
that the Cardinal wasn't just a one
man team over the last few years.
Without a solid offensive line and
dominant fullbacks, Stanford would
n't have made it to two straight BCS
bowls and probably would have been
left out of the2ooB postseason as well.
Without consistent play from one of
the nation's best front sevens, the Or
ange Bowl would have been much
more competitive, and USC would
have clobbered the Cardinal each of
the last two years.
But still, highlights are highlights,
and we all like to gravitate towards
the big-play guy who is going to in
spire rampant jersey sales, catchy slo
gans, widespread punning, inadver
tent Twitter campaigns, etc. And folks,
it just isn't Toby lime anymore. We're
out of Luck. "Heisman" is officially
Old English.
It's highly doubtful that anyone
on the Cardinal roster will fully fill
that void in 2012. But who is going to
be the breakout player that captures
our hearts for the time being?
The easy choice is senior-to-be
Stepfan Taylor, who has somewhat
quietly rushed for 2,770 yards over
the past three seasons, spending one
year behind Gerhart and the other
two as a member of a running-back
by-committee. Despite the early
round departures of stud O-linemen
David DeCastro and Jonathan Mar
tin, the combination of Taylor and
junior fullback Ryan Hewitt will be
fun to watch now that the latter has a
year of starting experience under his
belt.

Another guy that people will be
very interested in is receiver Ty Mont
gomery, who quickly made himself
useful during his freshman season
when Stanford was ailing out wide.
His speed just might bring us back to
the days when Chris Owusu was re
turning kicks like nobody's business,
and for a team that will be short on ex
perience at receiver again he should
see a lot of playing time this season.
Some folks might go all SEC on
you (defensive players are people,
too) and call on senior linebackers
Shayne Skov and Chase Thomas as
players to watch. It's pretty safe to say
that those guys will be the first two
Cardinal players off the board in next
year's draft (no, the draft talk didn't
leave with Luck). But this is Quarter
back U, and even though we might
not have a quarterback as our star, we
should probably stick to the offensive
side of the ball.

The guy I'm looking at as next
year's breakout player is none of the
above, though. Instead, I'm picking
tight end Levine Toilolo. He'll be a
senior next year but has just one year
of playing experience, having red
shirted in 2009 and then missed prac
tically all of the 2010 season after in
juring his knee on the Cardinal's sec
ond play from scrimmage.
How did that one year go? As the
second tight end on the depth chart
he only caught six touchdowns, the
second-best total on the team.

The only player who did better
was fellow tight end Coby Fleener,
who has now set sail for bluer, horse
shoe-filled pastures with Luck and the
Indianapolis Colts. Remember all
those three-tight-end sets the Cardi
nal ran last year? It will be up to either
Toilolo or senior Zach Ertz to run the
deep routes that Fleener so excelled
at. Last year, Fleener averaged a
team-best 19.6 yards per catch, com
pared with Toilolo's 13.7 and Ertz's
12.8.

I'm not sure whether Toilolo
would beat Ertz in a footrace, but one
play from last season stands out. On
the first play of the fourth quarter
against Arizona, Stanford lined up
with no men wide, but the call was a
hard-sell play action, not the expect
ed power run. On the right side of the
line, Toilolo blew right past one line
backer; on the left side, Ertz threw his
linebacker aside and raced past him.
Both were wide open,but Toilolo was
three yards ahead and caught the
easy touchdown pass.
I don't have nearly enough in
sight into the Stanford playbook to
tell you whether Ertz was supposed
to delay ever-so-slightly on that call,
but the result was telling.

If you ask me,Toilolo is going to
be just a few strides ahead of Ertz
this season, just as he was on that
play. Ertz has had a lot of success on
slant routes, though, and with He
witt doing his fullback-tight-end
hybrid-Spider-2-Y-Banana thing as
the likely third tight end, Toilolo
seems like the favorite to step into
Fleener's shoes.

And at 6-foot-B,Toilolo is going
to be the biggest target on the team
for a journeyman quarterback that
can't possibly live up to Luck's accu
racy. He has also shown the ability
to make some great, corner-end
zone grabs a la Evan Moore, and
you never know when those acro
batics will come in handy.

As a tight end.Toilolo isn't going
to get nearly as many targets as
Montgomery or account for as
many yards as Taylor. But if he stays
healthy he could going to be a huge
and I mean huge —part of a
Stanford offense that will be in dire
need of a catalyst.

Joseph Bey da might be in Toilolove.

dominant fullbacks, Stanford would
n't have made it to two straight BCS
bowls and probably would have been
left out of the2ooB postseason as well.
Without consistent play from one of
the nation's best front sevens, the Or
ange Bowl would have been much
more competitive, and USC would
have clobbered the Cardinal each of
the last two years.
But still, highlights are highlights,
and we all like to gravitate towards
the big-play guy who is going to in
spire rampant jersey sales, catchy slo
gans, widespread punning, inadver
tent Twitter campaigns, etc. And folks,
it just isn't Toby lime anymore. We're
out of Luck. "Heisman" is officially
Old English.
It's highly doubtful that anyone
on the Cardinal roster will fully fill
that void in 2012. But who is going to
be the breakout player that captures
our hearts for the time being?
The easy choice is senior-to-be
Stepfan Taylor, who has somewhat
quietly rushed for 2,770 yards over
the past three seasons, spending one
year behind Gerhart and the other
two as a member of a running-back
by-committee. Despite the early
round departures of stud O-linemen
David DeCastro and Jonathan Mar
tin, the combination of Taylor and
junior fullback Ryan Hewitt will be
fun to watch now that the latter has a
year of starting experience under his
belt.

Another guy that people will be
very interested in is receiver Ty Mont
gomery, who quickly made himself
useful during his freshman season
when Stanford was ailing out wide.
His speed just might bring us back to
the days when Chris Owusu was re
turning kicks like nobody's business,
and for a team that will be short on ex
perience at receiver again he should
see a lot of playing time this season.
Some folks might go all SEC on
you (defensive players are people,
too) and call on senior linebackers
Shayne Skov and Chase Thomas as
players to watch. It's pretty safe to say
that those guys will be the first two
Cardinal players off the board in next
year's draft (no, the draft talk didn't
leave with Luck). But this is Quarter
back U, and even though we might
not have a quarterback as our star, we
should probably stick to the offensive
side of the ball.

The guy I'm looking at as next
year's breakout player is none of the
above, though. Instead, I'm picking
tight end Levine Toilolo. He'll be a
senior next year but has just one year
of playing experience, having red
shirted in 2009 and then missed prac
tically all of the 2010 season after in
juring his knee on the Cardinal's sec
ond play from scrimmage.
How did that one year go? As the
second tight end on the depth chart
he only caught six touchdowns, the
second-best total on the team.

The only player who did better
was fellow tight end Coby Fleener,
who has now set sail for bluer, horse
shoe-filled pastures with Luck and the
Indianapolis Colts. Remember all
those three-tight-end sets the Cardi
nal ran last year? It will be up to either
Toilolo or senior Zach Ertz to run the
deep routes that Fleener so excelled
at. Last year, Fleener averaged a
team-best 19.6 yards per catch, com
pared with Toilolo's 13.7 and Ertz's
12.8.

I'm not sure whether Toilolo
would beat Ertz in a footrace, but one
play from last season stands out. On
the first play of the fourth quarter
against Arizona, Stanford lined up
with no men wide, but the call was a
hard-sell play action, not the expect
ed power run. On the right side of the
line, Toilolo blew right past one line
backer; on the left side, Ertz threw his
linebacker aside and raced past him.
Both were wide open,but Toilolo was
three yards ahead and caught the
easy touchdown pass.
I don't have nearly enough in
sight into the Stanford playbook to
tell you whether Ertz was supposed
to delay ever-so-slightly on that call,
but the result was telling.

If you ask me,Toilolo is going to
be just a few strides ahead of Ertz
this season, just as he was on that
play. Ertz has had a lot of success on
slant routes, though, and with He
witt doing his fullback-tight-end
hybrid-Spider-2-Y-Banana thing as
the likely third tight end, Toilolo
seems like the favorite to step into
Fleener's shoes.

And at 6-foot-B,Toilolo is going
to be the biggest target on the team
for a journeyman quarterback that
can't possibly live up to Luck's accu
racy. He has also shown the ability
to make some great, corner-end
zone grabs a la Evan Moore, and
you never know when those acro
batics will come in handy.

As a tight end.Toilolo isn't going
to get nearly as many targets as
Montgomery or account for as
many yards as Taylor. But if he stays
healthy he could going to be a huge
and I mean huge —part of a
Stanford offense that will be in dire
need of a catalyst.

Joseph Bey da might be in Toilolove.
