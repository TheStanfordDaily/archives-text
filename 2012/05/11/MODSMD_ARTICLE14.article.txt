# STILL NOT OUT NO.12 CARD HOSTS WASHINGTON STATE
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
There are no easy weekends in Pac-12 base
ball, but you would be hard-pressed to sched
ule a home stretch with more chances to make
up ground than No. 12 Stanford's final three
weeks.

With Stanford (29-14,11-10 Pac-12) staring
up at conference leader No. 10 Oregon (34-14,
16-8), the Cardinal's upcoming series against
the eighth-, 11th- and ninth-place teams in the
Pac-12 are an opportunity that the squad can't
afford to let slip away. Stanford's quest to im
prove its playoff positioning begins tonight at
Sunken Diamond against a Washington State
(23-20,9-11) team that has lost its last two Pac
-12 series.

To catch the Ducks who finish their sea
son by hosting lOth-place USC and travelling

to No. 19 Oregon State the Cardinal will
probably need to win at least eight of its last
nine conference games, barring an Oregon col
lapse. However, the Cardinal isn't spending
much time pondering the seemingly endless
scenarios surrounding its Pac-12 finish.
"It's our goal to go and win every game, and
it's kind of out of our control whether Oregon
wins or loses," said freshman third baseman
Alex Blandino. "I just know that we need to go
out and win as many games as possible. I think
if we go out and take care of business the next
couple of weeks, everything will work itself
out."

Blandino did take care of business at Ore
gon State last weekend, going 5-for-12 and hit
ting three RBI doubles, but his team fell be
hind against the Beavers in all three games.
Despite furious late-inning comebacks the
Cardinal could only claim a victory in the se

ries opener, with its hopes for winning the se
ries coming to an end in 10 innings on Sunday
after a game-tying hit by junior shortstop
Kenny Diekroeger.
Even though the Cougars have fared worse
than the Beavers this season, Stanford can't af
ford to overlook Washington State, which beat
Oregon in two of three games in Eugene just a
week after the Ducks knocked off the Cardi
nal at home.

Offense will likely be Stanford's main con
cern after the disappointing trip to Corvallis.
Thirteen of the Cardinal's 14 defeats have
come when it failed to score five runs, and the
squad has yet to lose when leading after the
first or second inning.

we were coming from behind and it was

Sophomore shorstop Lonnie Kauppila (above) and the No.12 Stanford baseball squad will host conference opponent Washington State for a
pivotal three-game series starting tonight. The Cardinal is currently sitting in fifth place in the Pac-12 standings and will need a strong
late-season run in the next three weeks if it wants to catch first-place Oregon, which remains three and a half games ahead of the Cardinal.
tough," Blandino said. "It's good
to see that the team has that fight
and that capability, but... it's def
initely more beneficial for our
team and our pitching staff to get
those runs early. It's something
we're going to need to improve on
looking forward."
Drawing first blood was not an
issue for the Cardinal when these
two teams met last year, as Stan
ford opened the scoring in all
three games and returned from
Pullman with a series win. But an
eight-run rally from the Cougars
in the eighth inning of the series
opener dealt the Cardinal a 10-8
loss the type of loss it just can't
afford this time around.

Stanford's effort the following
afternoon is much more akin to
what the squad will be looking for
this weekend. Paced by then
freshman Brian Ragira's grand
slam and seven RBI, the Cardinal
jumped out to a 9-0 lead through
two innings and didn't look back,
capturing a dominant 22-3 win.
Stanford's high-powered of
fense is still around for this year's
showdown with the Cougar pitch
ing staff, but the same can't be said
for the Washington State hurlers.
None of the Cougars who started
five or more games on the mound
are still around this season, and the
squad's four-man rotation consists
of two freshmen, a sophomore and
a junior college transfer. That
group has produced predictably
poor results for Washington State,
which as of Monday ranked 10th
in the Pac-12 in hits allowed per
nine innings (10.58) and last in
strikeouts (5.3).
The Cougars might only be a
middle-of-the-pack squad offen
sively in such a loaded conference,
but they will be facing a Stanford
rotation that in its own right has
been struggling to find an identity
as of late.
Little has been certain over the
last few weeks besides star righty
Mark Appel, who went seven in
nings for the win last Friday in
Corvallis. Junior lefthander Brett
Mooneyham was a late scratch
with the flu against Oregon State
and is still coming off a three-week
slump that saw him post a 9.00
ERA.

And if the series comes down
to a Sunday rubber game, there's
not going to be a clear answer on

the mound for head coach Mark
Marquess. Freshman John
Hochstatter, sophomore A.J.
Vanegas and junior Sahil Bloom
have all gotten looks in the Sunday
spot, but none of the righties have
distinguished themselves in that
role recently.

Vanegas' 2.44 ERA is the best
among Cardinal pitchers with at
least five appearances, and he
threw 5.1 combined innings of
one-hit baseball in two relief stints
last weekend. But he allowed 10
baserunners in his last start, a four
inning affair at UCLA on April 29
that Stanford eventually won be
hind strong pitching from Bloom.
Tonight's opener is scheduled
for 6 p.m., with the Saturday game
set for 2 p.m. and the finale on Sun
day to be played at 1 p.m.

afford to let slip away. Stanford's quest to im
prove its playoff positioning begins tonight at
Sunken Diamond against a Washington State
(23-20,9-11) team that has lost its last two Pac
-12 series.

To catch the Ducks who finish their sea
son by hosting lOth-place USC and travelling

to No. 19 Oregon State the Cardinal will
probably need to win at least eight of its last
nine conference games, barring an Oregon col
lapse. However, the Cardinal isn't spending
much time pondering the seemingly endless
scenarios surrounding its Pac-12 finish.
"It's our goal to go and win every game, and
it's kind of out of our control whether Oregon
wins or loses," said freshman third baseman
Alex Blandino. "I just know that we need to go
out and win as many games as possible. I think
if we go out and take care of business the next
couple of weeks, everything will work itself
out."

Blandino did take care of business at Ore
gon State last weekend, going 5-for-12 and hit
ting three RBI doubles, but his team fell be
hind against the Beavers in all three games.
Despite furious late-inning comebacks the
Cardinal could only claim a victory in the se

ries opener, with its hopes for winning the se
ries coming to an end in 10 innings on Sunday
after a game-tying hit by junior shortstop
Kenny Diekroeger.
Even though the Cougars have fared worse
than the Beavers this season, Stanford can't af
ford to overlook Washington State, which beat
Oregon in two of three games in Eugene just a
week after the Ducks knocked off the Cardi
nal at home.

Offense will likely be Stanford's main con
cern after the disappointing trip to Corvallis.
Thirteen of the Cardinal's 14 defeats have
come when it failed to score five runs, and the
squad has yet to lose when leading after the
first or second inning.

we were coming from behind and it was

Sophomore shorstop Lonnie Kauppila (above) and the No.12 Stanford baseball squad will host conference opponent Washington State for a
pivotal three-game series starting tonight. The Cardinal is currently sitting in fifth place in the Pac-12 standings and will need a strong
late-season run in the next three weeks if it wants to catch first-place Oregon, which remains three and a half games ahead of the Cardinal.
tough," Blandino said. "It's good
to see that the team has that fight
and that capability, but... it's def
initely more beneficial for our
team and our pitching staff to get
those runs early. It's something
we're going to need to improve on
looking forward."
Drawing first blood was not an
issue for the Cardinal when these
two teams met last year, as Stan
ford opened the scoring in all
three games and returned from
Pullman with a series win. But an
eight-run rally from the Cougars
in the eighth inning of the series
opener dealt the Cardinal a 10-8
loss the type of loss it just can't
afford this time around.

Stanford's effort the following
afternoon is much more akin to
what the squad will be looking for
this weekend. Paced by then
freshman Brian Ragira's grand
slam and seven RBI, the Cardinal
jumped out to a 9-0 lead through
two innings and didn't look back,
capturing a dominant 22-3 win.
Stanford's high-powered of
fense is still around for this year's
showdown with the Cougar pitch
ing staff, but the same can't be said
for the Washington State hurlers.
None of the Cougars who started
five or more games on the mound
are still around this season, and the
squad's four-man rotation consists
of two freshmen, a sophomore and
a junior college transfer. That
group has produced predictably
poor results for Washington State,
which as of Monday ranked 10th
in the Pac-12 in hits allowed per
nine innings (10.58) and last in
strikeouts (5.3).
The Cougars might only be a
middle-of-the-pack squad offen
sively in such a loaded conference,
but they will be facing a Stanford
rotation that in its own right has
been struggling to find an identity
as of late.
Little has been certain over the
last few weeks besides star righty
Mark Appel, who went seven in
nings for the win last Friday in
Corvallis. Junior lefthander Brett
Mooneyham was a late scratch
with the flu against Oregon State
and is still coming off a three-week
slump that saw him post a 9.00
ERA.

And if the series comes down
to a Sunday rubber game, there's
not going to be a clear answer on

the mound for head coach Mark
Marquess. Freshman John
Hochstatter, sophomore A.J.
Vanegas and junior Sahil Bloom
have all gotten looks in the Sunday
spot, but none of the righties have
distinguished themselves in that
role recently.

Vanegas' 2.44 ERA is the best
among Cardinal pitchers with at
least five appearances, and he
threw 5.1 combined innings of
one-hit baseball in two relief stints
last weekend. But he allowed 10
baserunners in his last start, a four
inning affair at UCLA on April 29
that Stanford eventually won be
hind strong pitching from Bloom.
Tonight's opener is scheduled
for 6 p.m., with the Saturday game
set for 2 p.m. and the finale on Sun
day to be played at 1 p.m.
