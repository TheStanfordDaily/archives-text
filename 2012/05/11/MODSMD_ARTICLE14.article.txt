# STILL NOT OUT NO.12 CARD HOSTS WASHINGTON STATE
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
There are no easy weekends in Pac-12 base
ball, but you would be hard-pressed to sched
ule a home stretch with more chances to make
up ground than No. 12 Stanford's final three
weeks.

With Stanford (29-14,11-10 Pac-12) staring
up at conference leader No. 10 Oregon (34-14,
16-8), the Cardinal's upcoming series against
the eighth-, 11th- and ninth-place teams in the
Pac-12 are an opportunity that the squad can't
afford to let slip away. Stanford's quest to im
prove its playoff positioning begins tonight at
Sunken Diamond against a Washington State
(23-20,9-11) team that has lost its last two Pac
-12 series.

To catch the Ducks who finish their sea
son by hosting lOth-place USC and travelling

to No. 19 Oregon State the Cardinal will
probably need to win at least eight of its last
nine conference games, barring an Oregon col
lapse. However, the Cardinal isn't spending
much time pondering the seemingly endless
scenarios surrounding its Pac-12 finish.
"It's our goal to go and win every game, and
it's kind of out of our control whether Oregon
wins or loses," said freshman third baseman
Alex Blandino. "I just know that we need to go
out and win as many games as possible. I think
if we go out and take care of business the next
couple of weeks, everything will work itself
out."

Blandino did take care of business at Ore
gon State last weekend, going 5-for-12 and hit
ting three RBI doubles, but his team fell be
hind against the Beavers in all three games.
Despite furious late-inning comebacks the
Cardinal could only claim a victory in the se

ries opener, with its hopes for winning the se
ries coming to an end in 10 innings on Sunday
after a game-tying hit by junior shortstop
Kenny Diekroeger.
Even though the Cougars have fared worse
than the Beavers this season, Stanford can't af
ford to overlook Washington State, which beat
Oregon in two of three games in Eugene just a
week after the Ducks knocked off the Cardi
nal at home.

Offense will likely be Stanford's main con
cern after the disappointing trip to Corvallis.
Thirteen of the Cardinal's 14 defeats have
come when it failed to score five runs, and the
squad has yet to lose when leading after the
first or second inning.

Sophomore shorstop Lonnie Kauppila (above) and the No.12 Stanford baseball squad will host conference opponent Washington State for a
pivotal three-game series starting tonight. The Cardinal is currently sitting in fifth place in the Pac-12 standings and will need a strong
late-season run in the next three weeks if it wants to catch first-place Oregon, which remains three and a half games ahead of the Cardinal.
