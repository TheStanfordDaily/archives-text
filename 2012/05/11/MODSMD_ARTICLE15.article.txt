# One last chance

### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The No. 11 seed Stanford men's tennis team will hope to
capitalize on its home-court advantage and two weeks of
focused preparation this weekend as the squad enters the
opening stages of the season-ending NCAA tournament.
The Cardinal hosts Sacramento State on Saturday and, if
victorious, will square off against either Texas or Santa
Clara on Sunday.

"The NCAAs are an exciting time for our team and we
have had a good two weeks of practice to fully prepare our
selves for the tournament," said senior Bradley Klahn.
"The break in the schedule has allowed us to fully recover
from injuries and make strides in our fitness and games to
be at our peak form."

The Cardinal (17-8,5-2 Pac-12) will be heavily favored
in its opening matchup against Sacramento State (11-12),
which advanced to the NCAAs for the ninth time in its his
tory as the winner of the Big Sky Conference. When the
two teams last met in January 2011, the Cardinal swept the
Hornets; however, lineup changes in the Hornets' squad
and the heightened tensions of postseason tennis means
nothing is guaranteed.

"Every match from here on out is difficult and will chal
lenge us to be at our best," Klahn said. "There's no over
looking any opponent, especially ones we are not familiar
with. Every team is deserving of its tournament bid and will
be fighting just as hard as we are to keep the season alive."
As a top-16 seed, the Cardinal's first two matches will be
held at the Taube Family Tennis Center before the tourna
ment moves to Athens, Ga., for later rounds. Playing at
home in the NCAA tournament last year, the Cardinal
marched to the quarterfinals before falling in a 4-3 defeat
to eventual finalist Virginia.

"Home court advantage is huge in these first two
rounds," Klahn said. "Last year, the home crowd was in
credible and really provided an electric atmosphere for our
team to thrive in. Being comfortable on our own courts and
in our natural surroundings will help us perform our best."
Facing the Hornets will also give the Cardinal the op
portunity to return to its winning ways, after its run in the
inaugural Pac-12 tournament was abruptly terminated in a

Seniors Bradley Klahn (back) and Ryan Thacher (front) will lead the No. 11
Stanford men's tennis team into the first round of the NCAA tournament against
Sacramento State at home. The duo's doubles team has a career record of 111-22.
4-0 defeat at the hands of No. 1 seed
use.
Looking beyond the Sacramen
to State matchup, Santa Clara is fa
miliar for Stanford, as the Cardinal
triumphed over the Broncos 6-1 in
late January. Texas, however, would
provide more uncertainty and
perhaps a stiffer test for the Car
dinal, as the two teams have not
met since early 2009.
In either case, the Cardinal
led by Klahn and fellow senior
Ryan Thacher will hope to use
the two seniors' accumulated post
season experience to peak under
the pressure of postseason play.
"At this point in the season, the
most important match is our next
match," Klahn noted. "There is no
opportunity to look past the next

opponent because it is win or go
home. That scenario certainly adds
an extra spark as we are fighting to
keep our season going. The intensi
ty and focus is higher, but it is still
another match and we won't adjust
the way we approach it or play."
For Klahn and Thacher, the
NCAAs also offer the chance to
finish their already-sterling Stan
ford careers on a high note. The sen
iors have excelled on the individual
and team fronts, collecting eight
doubles titles together while lead
ing the Cardinal to three straight
postseason appearances. Klahn
also collected the highest individual
honor in college tennis in 2010
when he won the NCAA singles
championship.
"This is a special time of year,
and the excitement around the
tournament is unrivaled," Klahn
said. "That said, I'm anxious for the
tournament to begin ... I want to
finish my final postseason, win or
lose, with no regrets and be able to

look back five to 10 years from now
knowing I left everything out on
the court for my team and have
great memories about the tourna
ment."

Given the Cardinal's strong
record, postseason experience and
senior leadership, Klahn also ex
pressed confidence in the team's
ability to go deep into the postsea
son.

"Our team has a great opportu
nity this May to put all the hard
work we have done over the last
nine months into action," Klahn
said. "The only thing we can do is
spill our guts out onto the court for
one another and battle, and if we do
that, I think this team is capable of
anything."

The Cardinal will square off
against Sacramento State at noon
on Saturday at the Taube Family
Tennis Center.
