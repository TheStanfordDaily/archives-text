# One last chance

### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The No. 11 seed Stanford men's tennis team will hope to
capitalize on its home-court advantage and two weeks of
focused preparation this weekend as the squad enters the
opening stages of the season-ending NCAA tournament.
The Cardinal hosts Sacramento State on Saturday and, if
victorious, will square off against either Texas or Santa
Clara on Sunday.

"The NCAAs are an exciting time for our team and we
have had a good two weeks of practice to fully prepare our
selves for the tournament," said senior Bradley Klahn.
"The break in the schedule has allowed us to fully recover
from injuries and make strides in our fitness and games to
be at our peak form."

The Cardinal (17-8,5-2 Pac-12) will be heavily favored
in its opening matchup against Sacramento State (11-12),
which advanced to the NCAAs for the ninth time in its his
tory as the winner of the Big Sky Conference. When the
two teams last met in January 2011, the Cardinal swept the
Hornets; however, lineup changes in the Hornets' squad
and the heightened tensions of postseason tennis means
nothing is guaranteed.

"Every match from here on out is difficult and will chal
lenge us to be at our best," Klahn said. "There's no over
looking any opponent, especially ones we are not familiar
with. Every team is deserving of its tournament bid and will
be fighting just as hard as we are to keep the season alive."
As a top-16 seed, the Cardinal's first two matches will be
held at the Taube Family Tennis Center before the tourna
ment moves to Athens, Ga., for later rounds. Playing at
home in the NCAA tournament last year, the Cardinal
marched to the quarterfinals before falling in a 4-3 defeat
to eventual finalist Virginia.

"Home court advantage is huge in these first two
rounds," Klahn said. "Last year, the home crowd was in
credible and really provided an electric atmosphere for our
team to thrive in. Being comfortable on our own courts and
in our natural surroundings will help us perform our best."
Facing the Hornets will also give the Cardinal the op
portunity to return to its winning ways, after its run in the
inaugural Pac-12 tournament was abruptly terminated in a
