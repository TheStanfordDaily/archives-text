## TOP 5: WAYS TO BEAT THE HEAT 
### 
JFK talked about it in a letter. We
came to Stanford for it. We backdoor
brag about it to our East Coast
friends all the time. And now it's
oppressive. Yeah we're talking
about the heat. And now that it feels
like full-fledged summer in this so
called spring quarter and the admin
istration seems to be installing new
pools we mean fountains left
and right, it's time we decide just
where to dip our toes. Here are
Intermission's Top 5 ways to beat the
heat.

It's 85 degrees. Do you
know where your
sleeves are?
One may think, at first, that bro
tanks are simply a fashion statement,
letting people know you're hip yet
laid back, with it yet not too uptight.
Indeed, the bro-tanker lives by the
motto, "Sun's out, guns out." But
these days, bro tanks aren't just a
sign of the chic or solstice, but a
necessity for all those fated to brave
the heat-soaked California air. Clever
saying optional.
Fountain Shopping
Similar to but not the same as foun
tain hopping, fountain shopping
allows you to dip into the cool waters
of the many Stanford oases without
the nausea induced from soggy jog
ging from fountain to fountain.
Fountain hopping, designed to invig
orate more than to alleviate the heat,
is better suited for fall quarter when
you are wont to explore new things,
especially with your freshman dorm.
Instead, to beat the heat, park your
bathing-suited self in just one foun
tain and enjoy the disc tossing and
tightrope walking of this jubilant cam
pus. Perhaps the new college cam-

pusy-looking one that replaced that
eyesore behind Terman Engineering
will cool your jets.

Computer Cluster
Camping
Somehow Stanford manages to con
tinuously build and rebuild huge din
ing halls and gyms and centers for
contemplation, but can't spare a bit
for some air conditioning. If the
open window, portable fan and
squirt gun just aren't doin' it for ya,
camping out in the one air-condi
tioned room in the house will just
have to do. And even if it's just one
step away from becoming a total
study shut-in, at least there's
Internet, right?

Coupa Cafe's New
Gelato Bars
If you, like some of us Intermission
writers, are not actually obsessed
with hot beverages, then putrid
weather is your treat a chance to
finally escape all the requests to get
Peet's or Philz or Coupa. Unless, of
course, you're stopping by Coups
an affectionate nickname for the
abbreviation-inclined to get one
of their new, hip gelato bars, aka
swanky popsicles. The Bar Gelato by
Naia, as it calls itself, comes in really
cool flavors like burnt caramel, St.
George spirits single malt and
pomegranate sorbetto. Try every fla
vor, and turn down the temp from
inside out.
Carmelo Anthony
There it is, there it is. With a "Beat
the Heat" article, how could we not
make a pun about the Miami Heat?
We don't know much about sports,
but we know that last week Carmelo
Anthony of the New York Knicks
(that's the one with Jeremy Lin) put
up a 3-pointer with less than a
minute left, and neither D-Wade nor
Leßron James could salvage the
game. Bummer.
