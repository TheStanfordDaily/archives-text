## Education critical, Friedman says Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author discusses the future of America 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
"America its fate, future and vitality is
the most important foreign policy issue in the
world [today]," said Thomas Friedman, Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist and author, to a packed
Cemex Auditorium Thursday afternoon. "If
America becomes weak, your children will grow
up in a fundamentally different world."
Friedman's talk was part of the Graduate
School of Business's (GSB) "View from the Top"
lecture series, a student-run program that brings

prominent figures to campus to share their in
sights on effective leadership.
Introducing Friedman as "one the most influ
ential journalists of the last few decades," Garth
Saloner, dean of the GSB, emphasized Fried
man's reporting experience on the front line of
issues ranging from the Arab Spring to the ongo
ing legislative gridlock in Washington, D.C.
"The themes that he addresses in his report
ing are those that any global citizen should be in
terested in," Saloner said.

Friedman opened the talk with a review of his
recently published book, "That Used To Be Us,"
which seeks to explore the reasons for America's
relative decline in the 21st century and offer so-

lutions to a situation Friedman
argues still hangs in the balance.
"We just don't know whether
[a happy ending] is fiction or
nonfiction," Friedman said.
Citing his experiences travel
ling to China and witnessing the
investment in infrastructure and
growth undertaken there, he ar
gued that Americans cannot af
ford to be complacent or acqui
esce to any sense of inevitability
of a deceptively gradual shift in
power.

"That sense of resignation,
that America's best days are be
hind it and that China's are
ahead, is the topic of conversation
across the country," Friedman
said. "No American should resign
themselves to that. We are opti
mists, but we are frustrated opti
mists."

Friedman argued that the
United States' tendency toward
complacency and an inability to
build for the long run has led to
missed opportunities

whether addressing globaliza
tion emerging from the end of
the Cold War or the post-9/11
decade lost in Iraq and
Afghanistan rather than to
rejuvenation.

Noting ongoing technological
advances such as video-confer
encing and increased automa
tion, Friedman argued that the
dominance of the relatively self
contained American economy
has ended.

"In terms of impact, it is as big
as Gutenberg's invention of the
printing press," Friedman ar
gued. "When the world gets this
hyper-connected, it's like the
whole global curve rose. Every

employer suddenly has more ac
cess to cheap automation, cheap
labor ... cheap genius. Average
is over."
Friedman asserted that the
technological revolution will re
quire people to market their in
dividual differences to employ
ers even more than in the past.
"Everyone is going to have to
develop their 'extra,' that unique
value that defines why they
should be employed or promot
ed," Friedman said. "We all
[now] want to do work that can't
be described by an algorithm
and so can't be outsourced or au
tomated."

Citing interviews with corpo
rate leaders in the course of writ
ing "That Used To Be Us," Fried
man described a common empha
sis among employers on hiring
and promoting creative and inno
vative employees better equipped
to respond to a rapidly changing
market. Fie argued, however, that
the development of such individu
als should be linked to greater
government spending.
"For us as a country, we have
two education challenges,"
Friedman said. "We need to
bring our bottom to our average,
and we need to bring our aver
age to a global high . .. We need
more and better education."

Succeeding in such a compet
itive global economy, according
to Friedman, requires the devel
opment of individual skills, an
emphasis on self-improvement
and a relentless work ethic.

"The minute you think you're
finished, that's when you are,"
Friedman asserted. "Stay hun
gry, take pride, be innovative and
think entrepreneurially."
Audience questioning fo
cused in part on the reasons for
the United States' recent decline
so soon after the end of the
"American Century."

"I grew up in a place and time
where politics worked," Fried
man said. "We had a formula for
success in this country, and we've
gotten away from it."
Fie argued that renewed in
vestment in education, more gov
ernment-funded research, a bal
anced budget and increased ex
penditure on infrastructure
would collectively offer the abili
ty to re-energize the United
States.

"Tell me we're going to pre
serve the American Dream for
another generation," Friedman
said. "We want America to be to
the world what Cape Canaveral
was to America. We want Amer
ica to be the place where every
one in the world comes to launch
their moonshot."

Responding to another ques
tion on parallels between the
Arab Spring and recent social
unrest emanating from simi
lar issues, such as socioeconomic
inequality and lack of economic
opportunity in the West,
Friedman, who covered the
Arab Spring extensively, was
quick to differentiate between
the two.

"The Arab Spring is the
greatest story I've covered,"
Friedman said. "It was about the
deepest human things digni
ty, justice and the quest to get the
tools and opportunities to real
ize one's full potential. We aren't
stifled in that way."

Friedman concluded the talk
by returning to the theme of a
globalized economy and how the
United States can excel within
the new reality.
"In a flat world, there's no
'here' and no 'there,'" Friedman
said. "There's just good, better
and best."
