Have you ever wondered what would
happen if Thor fought Iron Man?
How Joss Whedon would do direct
ing a superhero movie? Whether a superhero
crossover could work as a blockbuster? Well,
you get to discover the answers for yourself in
"The Avengers." The mega superhero movie
kicks off the summer season with lots of
action, lots of superheroes and some sem
blance of plot.
"The Avengers" is a massive crossover
between several Marvel superheroes. Most of
them have also starred or appeared in other
recent Marvel movies, including "Iron Man,"
"Thor" and "Captain America." As much as it
seems like a massive marketing ploy, I do
appreciate the sense of continuity across the
movies, and the film is at its best when it lets
the characters banter and fight. Characters

who have met in past movies remember each
other, and there is little shuffling in terms of
the casting. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans,
Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Samuel
L. Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Clark Gregg
are all back as Tony Stark (Iron Man), Captain
America (Steve Rogers), Black Widow
(Natasha Romanoff), Thor, Nick Fury, Pepper
Potts and Phil Coulson, respectively. New

additions to the group include troubled doc
tor Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), archer Clint
Barton (Jeremy Renner) and agent Maria Hill
(Cobie Smulders).
In "The Avengers," Loki (Tom
Hiddleston), Thor's banished and disgraced
brother, gets his hands on the Tesseract (last
seen in "Captain America"), a blue, glowing
cube of power that Loki uses to wreak havoc
on earth. Nick Fury recruits the Avengers to
stop him, and action ensues.
I enjoyed how the movie capitalized on
the ensemble cast, not falling victim to the
one-hero ploy to carry the movie, nor turn
ing to a boy-buddy dynamic to sustain the
tension. Everyone had something to do,
some role to play, and there really wasn't a
main character who dominated as the main
"hero" the whole time. Even characters I

thought would be slid aside, like the Hulk
and Black Widow, all had their own story
lines and pivotal plot moments. Downey Jr.
as Tony Stark was fantastic as usual, tossing
out some of the best lines in the movie.

Hiddleston also captured Loki and is a step
up above the typical comic book movie vil
lain. He's the perpetual underdog and you
want to sympathize with him, but just can't

quite bring yourself to his level.
But even with all the witty
quips and balanced characters,
the first half of the movie fails to
establish a consistent tone. It
seems to fluctuate between
extremely serious and slightly
humorous. It also feels convolut
ed, with an excessive amount of
comic-book science that would
have been more entertaining had
it taken itself less seriously. The
movie got on a much better
footing when the Avengers
banded together and started
fighting the common enemy.

Overall, it's a fun summer
movie. "The Avengers" isn't
going to be remembered as one
of the great superhero movies
of the decade, but it's a decent
action film. Don't forget to stay
for the credits. There's a mid
credit scene that you don't want
to miss and another post credit
scene that's more of an Easter
egg-
