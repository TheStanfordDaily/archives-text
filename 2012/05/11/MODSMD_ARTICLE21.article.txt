## period piece gets sexual in 'HYSTERIA' 
### â€“ misa SHIKUMA contact misa: mshikuma@stanford. edu 
You've probably heard this
story before: An uptight but
well-meaning professional
slowly but surely falls in love with
his boss' sharp-tongued, fiercely
independent daughter. Such is the
premise of Tanya Wexler's newest
film, "Hysteria," starring Hugh
Dancy and Maggie Gyllenhaal as
the reluctant lovers. The catch? Set
in Victorian England, Wexler's
uproarious film boasts an unlikely
historical backbone that most
romantic comedies lack: the inven
tion of the vibrator by Dancy's
character, Dr. Mortimer Granville.
"It was a movie I wanted to
see, and it didn't exist," said Wexler
of why this particular project drew
her out of the 10-year filmmaking
hiatus she took to start a family. "It
made me laugh instantly, [but] it's
also an empowerment narrative."
For those who aren't quite up
to speed on their, ah, history of sex
accessories, the vibrator was
invented in late eighteenth-century
England and adopted as a treat
ment for "hysteria," a catch-all
diagnosis for women of the era.
Doctors like Granville associated
their symptoms (including weep
ing, nymphomania, frigidity and
anxiety) with problems with their
uteruses and, in a completely non
sexual way, treated them with
"massages."
"Neither men nor women
really had a concept of women
having orgasms," explained Wexler.
"There was no guys-taking-advan
tage-of-ignorant-women. Everyone
was kind of equally naive in think
ing, 'Something's wrong with
women apparently most of
them and it's because their
uterus is wandering around in
their body and, if we just give them
a massage, they will feel better.'"
"It's a pretty good massage, I
would guess," she continued. "And
if you don't think there's anything

naughty, and that's what you're
supposed to do to function, then
it's much better than getting
leeched or whatever else."
So, yes, Victorian doctors
doled out "manual massages" as
legitimate medical treatments,
which is why the vibrator gained
popularity as a time- and energy
saving device.
"The vibrator was invented
for a man," Wexler said. "And in
that, I mean it was a labor-saving
device for a guy because his hand
got tired.
"If you read Rachel Maines'
book 'Technology of Orgasm,' she
says that these treatments often
went on for an hour or sometimes
more," she added.
Now that is one hell of a mas
sage. But I digress. As much as
"Hysteria" might appear to be

about sex from my enlightening
discussion with the film's director,
it also has a lot to offer in the form

of social and political commentary.
Gyllenhaal's character, for example,
denounces her upper-class privi-

lege in favor of charity work and
supporting women's rights.
"People want things that are
new and fresh, but at the same
time they're scared because they
don't know how to put it out there
in the world," Wexler said of her
seven-year struggle to get the film
into production.
"I think the reason 'Hysteria' is

tricky is that it's set in Victorian
England but it's not a period
piece," she said. "It's a pretty con
temporarily paced and thought
through romantic comedy that,
because of the facts of history, hap
pens to be set in [the past]."
Having viewed the film at its
premiere last year at the Toronto
International Film Festival, where

it was one of my personal
favorites, I can attest that it feels
refreshingly relatable.
"I don't think Victorian peo
ple sat around thinking, 'Aren't
we quaint in our cute little dress
es and our silly ways?' Wexler
said. "They thought, 'Electricity is
coming! We're on the cutting
edge of medicine and women's

rights and science! This is the most exciting
time to be alive!'

"Well that sounds very familiar to me,"
she added. "It sounds like now."

Indeed, many of the attitudes expressed
in the film toward changing technologies
and social mores are sure to hit pretty close
to home in away that manages to feel simul
taneously humorous and poignant. Who
knows, maybe in another century, some new
generation of bright young filmmakers will
be satirizing us in 2012.
"My friend calls this film the 'thinking
woman's romantic comedy,'" said Wexler,

who studied psychology at Yale University
before receiving her M.F.A. in film at
Columbia.
" [l'm] not trying to solve all the prob
lems of gender inequality and whatever; I'm
just trying to have a laugh and have some
thing that includes me."
"Hysteria"hits theaters on May2s.

which is why the vibrator gained
popularity as a time- and energy
saving device.
"The vibrator was invented
for a man," Wexler said. "And in
that, I mean it was a labor-saving
device for a guy because his hand
got tired.
"If you read Rachel Maines'
book 'Technology of Orgasm,' she
says that these treatments often
went on for an hour or sometimes
more," she added.
Now that is one hell of a mas
sage. But I digress. As much as
"Hysteria" might appear to be

about sex from my enlightening
discussion with the film's director,
it also has a lot to offer in the form

of social and political commentary.
Gyllenhaal's character, for example,
denounces her upper-class privi-

lege in favor of charity work and
supporting women's rights.
"People want things that are
new and fresh, but at the same
time they're scared because they
don't know how to put it out there
in the world," Wexler said of her
seven-year struggle to get the film
into production.
"I think the reason 'Hysteria' is

tricky is that it's set in Victorian
England but it's not a period
piece," she said. "It's a pretty con
temporarily paced and thought
through romantic comedy that,
because of the facts of history, hap
pens to be set in [the past]."
Having viewed the film at its
premiere last year at the Toronto
International Film Festival, where

it was one of my personal
favorites, I can attest that it feels
refreshingly relatable.
"I don't think Victorian peo
ple sat around thinking, 'Aren't
we quaint in our cute little dress
es and our silly ways?' Wexler
said. "They thought, 'Electricity is
coming! We're on the cutting
edge of medicine and women's

rights and science! This is the most exciting
time to be alive!'

"Well that sounds very familiar to me,"
she added. "It sounds like now."

Indeed, many of the attitudes expressed
in the film toward changing technologies
and social mores are sure to hit pretty close
to home in away that manages to feel simul
taneously humorous and poignant. Who
knows, maybe in another century, some new
generation of bright young filmmakers will
be satirizing us in 2012.
"My friend calls this film the 'thinking
woman's romantic comedy,'" said Wexler,

who studied psychology at Yale University
before receiving her M.F.A. in film at
Columbia.
" [l'm] not trying to solve all the prob
lems of gender inequality and whatever; I'm
just trying to have a laugh and have some
thing that includes me."
"Hysteria"hits theaters on May2s.

You've probably heard this
story before: An uptight but
well-meaning professional
slowly but surely falls in love with
his boss' sharp-tongued, fiercely
independent daughter. Such is the
premise of Tanya Wexler's newest
film, "Hysteria," starring Hugh
Dancy and Maggie Gyllenhaal as
the reluctant lovers. The catch? Set
in Victorian England, Wexler's
uproarious film boasts an unlikely
historical backbone that most
romantic comedies lack: the inven
tion of the vibrator by Dancy's
character, Dr. Mortimer Granville.
"It was a movie I wanted to
see, and it didn't exist," said Wexler
of why this particular project drew
her out of the 10-year filmmaking
hiatus she took to start a family. "It
made me laugh instantly, [but] it's
also an empowerment narrative."
For those who aren't quite up
to speed on their, ah, history of sex
accessories, the vibrator was
invented in late eighteenth-century
England and adopted as a treat
ment for "hysteria," a catch-all
diagnosis for women of the era.
Doctors like Granville associated
their symptoms (including weep
ing, nymphomania, frigidity and
anxiety) with problems with their
uteruses and, in a completely non
sexual way, treated them with
"massages."
"Neither men nor women
really had a concept of women
having orgasms," explained Wexler.
"There was no guys-taking-advan
tage-of-ignorant-women. Everyone
was kind of equally naive in think
ing, 'Something's wrong with
women apparently most of
them and it's because their
uterus is wandering around in
their body and, if we just give them
a massage, they will feel better.'"
"It's a pretty good massage, I
would guess," she continued. "And
if you don't think there's anything

naughty, and that's what you're
supposed to do to function, then
it's much better than getting
leeched or whatever else."
So, yes, Victorian doctors
doled out "manual massages" as
legitimate medical treatments,
which is why the vibrator gained
popularity as a time- and energy
saving device.
"The vibrator was invented
for a man," Wexler said. "And in
that, I mean it was a labor-saving

got tired.
