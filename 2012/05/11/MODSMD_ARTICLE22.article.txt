## STANFORD SAMPLER TAKES THE CAKE

Last Sunday marked the third annual "A Taste of Palo
Alto" event. Hosted at Stanford by the brothers of Phi
Kappa Psi and the sisters of Alpha Epsilon Phi, the
charity event featured many local restaurants that donated
servings of their specialties to benefit the Ecumenical Hunger
Program in East Palo Alto.

While Stanford students devoured almost all of the offer
ings in sight, student organizers from AEPhi and Phi Psi favored

the Caribbean food the jerk chicken
from Coconuts was especially popular.
Although I was at first over
whelmed by the selection, I finally
decided to start my gastronomic adven
ture at 1 Oz. Coffee, a mobile coffee

vendor that prepares fresh espresso drinks for special events.
I had a perfectly crafted macchiato, delivering just the right
amount of caffeine to rev my appetite for what was to follow.
Next, I decided to try food from Left Bank, a French bistro
located in Menlo Park. For four tickets (equivalent to $4), I
received the vegetarian quiche printaniere and a side salad.
The quiche was more vegetable and cheese than egg, allow
ing the flavors and textures of the fresh vegetables to come
through instead of being lost in a yolky abyss. The side salad
was a beautifully composed mix of spicy arugula, flavorful
olives and a zesty dressy.
While I would like to say that I was able to try more of
the offerings, I cannot lie. It might be larger than average, but
my appetite is in fact finite. But there is always room for
dessert, especially when it is a sure winner. The Prolific Oven
offered two different cakes, and I could not leave White Plaza
without having consumed a piece of the chocolate mocha
cake, a cake that I have loved since coming to Stanford three
years ago.

After sampling the goods, I was able sit beside the Claw
and enjoy live musical performances by various Stanford
groups and enjoy the sunny day on campus. "A Taste of Palo

Alto" definitely created a carnival-like atmosphere, reinforc
ing the image that comes to mind when one thinks of
springtime at "Camp Stanford."
The vendors this year were Siam Orchid, Garden Fresh,
Coconuts, Left Bank, Kikka Sushi, Martinelli's, Buca di
Beppo, 1 Oz. Coffee and the Prolific Oven. I tasted Palo Alto
and I liked it.
