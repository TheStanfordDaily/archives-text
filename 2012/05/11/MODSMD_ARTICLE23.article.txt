Why choose just one thing to love
when there are so many options?
(Sidenote: that could be the
motto of college kids everywhere). We decid
ed not to choose and in the spirit of all things
lists, here's a medley of things we're loving
this week. Other than college kids, of course.
Purity Ring: This boy/girl duo doesn't
even have a record out, but you can down
load the awesomely trippy track "Odebear"
on their website for free. It's ambient and

groovy, and sounds a bit like Beach House.
Like I said, awesomely trippy. A great sound
track for certain things like doing home
work. Why, what were you thinking?
Jason Segel: Although his new flick "The
Five-Year Engagement" is sometimes too cute
and not quite as charming as "Forgetting

Sarah Marshall," Jason Segel is just as lovable
as the vulnerable loser. If Intermission could
find a boyfriend as kind, funny, and totally in
tune with our chick problems, well, we
wouldn't be writing this article right now,
would we? Plus pirated re-runs of "Freaks
and Geeks" still get us as tingly as they did
when we were too young for TV-14.
Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets: I know it
looks like I'm trying to discreetly convince
you to buy drugs, but fear not, I'm a kindly
law-abiding citizen. Thanks to some protein
found in the "Miracle Fruit," bitter and sour

foods suddenly taste mind-blowingly sweet.
Apparently an orange will taste like heavenly
nectar and a lemon will taste like a piece of
candy. Winston, bring me the vegetables!
Longform.org: If you love good meaty
journalism about the downfall of Sears, Joe
Francis, the Google-sponsored race to the

moon, the sinking of the Concordia cruise
ships, murder cases, scandals and any other
obscure topic that strikes your interest, you'll
find it here. The free site gathers and gra
ciously distributes the best articles from The
New Yorker, Esquire, Rolling Stone,and a host

of other publications. Some are recent and
some oldies, you know, like if you feel like
going on the road with Axl Rose in 1991...
Japantown: If you find the time to go to
San Francisco, God bless you, tell me your
secrets! Secondly, check out Japantown if you
haven't already. It's less touristy and cleaner
than Chinatown, plus it has an arcade of
Japanese photobooths, mochi stands, killer
sushi, and Sanrio galore, so you can indulge
those fantasies of being a Harajuki doll.
Maybe that's just us. In any case, you can have
a good chuckle at the girls dressed up as their
favorite anime characters and the geisha and
samurai holding hands on the escalator.
