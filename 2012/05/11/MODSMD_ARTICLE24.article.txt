dreds of thousands of mobile

pose, how is a busy consumer to know
what's worth downloading and what's not?
We've broken down, by category, some of the
best apps you've probably never heard of.
Social Sharing: Mumbo. Think

Instagram, but with more per
sonality and fewer gratuitous
self-portraits.

edit your photos with filters
and stamps, generate memes,
share your location and start

interactive polls on multiple social net
works or customizable friend groups.

Restaurant & Food
Guides: Foodspotting. Find and recommend
dishes, not just restaurants.

all know how difficult it is to navigate an

Bay Area. Another perk to the app is that you
can read reviews of local restaurants from
food critics like Anthony Bourdain, culinary

more than just squirrel and bison hunting;
