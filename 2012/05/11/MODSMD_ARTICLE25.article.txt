## 'MONSIEUR LAZHAR' 
### â€“ alexandra HEENEY contact alexandra: aheeney@stanford. edu 
If you've seen the trailers for the new
Canadian film "Monsieur Lazhar," you
might be tempted to characterize it as just
another "Dead Poets Society" or "To Sir With
Love" that is to say, a film about some per
fect teacher who changes the lives of troubled
children. Though "Monsieur Lazhar" is about
a teacher and his middle school students, it's
a film that involves complicated characters in
difficult situations and is neither as dire nor
as simple as it may seem. It's a film about the
things we can't (but desperately need to) talk
about. There are no overwhelmingly signifi
cant moments, just a series of small ones that

eventually build to help the characters grow,
grieve and start anew. And it's absolutely
moving and affecting: tears were shed, but
they were every bit earned.
The film opens with recess in a Montreal
middle school at the height of winter, and the
kids are outside bundled up in toques and ski
jackets. School friends Alice (Sophie Nelisse)
and Simon (Emilien Neron) are talking out
doors when Simon remembers it is his day to
fetch the milk for the class, so he goes inside
to get it. The camera gets down low, at level
with Alice and Simon, so we see them fill the
screen and at eye level, not as people we can

physically look down on. While fetching the
milk, Simon walks by their classroom, where
he sees his teacher hanging from the ceiling,
dead. Alice is the only other student who sees
her like that; the rest of the students are

quickly ushered away.
The school deals with this in the way the
21st century dictates: by making discussion
about the event taboo in general discourse,
but forcing all the students to see the school
psychiatrist to deal with their grief. They
need a new teacher, too, and we meet

Monsieur Lazhar (Mohamed Fellag) when he
shows up shortly thereafter. He isn't respond
ing to a job posting, but he did read about
the teacher's suicide in the newspaper and
assumed that the post must be open. He is
polite, well-spoken, kind and charismatic in

an Old World kind of way; his good manners
seem like a relic from another time.
We soon learn that Monsieur Lazhar is
an Algerian political refugee in the middle of
court proceedings to immigrate to Montreal
where he now resides. Montreal feels foreign
in many ways, from the winter to the climate
to the Quebecois-isms, which are foreign to
French speakers from the rest of the world.
The teachers and students want to hear his
backstory because they romanticize him as
exotic and his immigration experience as an
exciting adventure as opposed to what it is
for him: a hard, foreign journey taken

because he had no other choice. He only
answers in broad strokes: it's too painful to

talk about.

There certainly are romantic
aspects to Lazhar. He starts his class
with a dictation from Balzac and is
surprised when his students find
this French ancient. He muses
about how he worries that the chil
dren will grow up to be adults but
still speak like children, and he has
a knack for metaphors. But it takes
him some time to understand the
culture in the classroom and the
effect that the teacher's death had
on his students. He mistakenly
assumes a boy with his head on his
desk is sleeping, when in fact the
boy suffers from severe migraines,
which the rest of the class knows.
The film focuses on Lazhar,
Alice and Simon, and how Lazhar
unobtrusively helps them cope and
grow while he comes to terms with
his own past. Alice quickly emerges

as a precocious student: smart, fiery
and mature beyond her years.
Simon carries around a deep sense
of guilt for the events because of
how they transpired his teacher
knew that it was his day to fetch the
milk and that he would see her, he
thinks and he was responsible
for slander against the teacher.
Sophie Nelisse, who plays
Alice, is a very pretty, very cute girl,
but the movie doesn't play this up.
Instead, she looks the way a middle
schooler looks: with imperfect hair
sometimes, unglamorous in the
school uniform or in real winter
gear, but still beautiful. This is a
microcosm of the film as a whole,
which wonderfully treats children
as complex human beings and not
just cute objects or convenient plot
devices. It's not just their hair that's
messy; their lives are messy, too.

"Monsieur Lazhar" is a film
about language: its limitations and
its possibilities. Lazhar can't or
won't talk openly about his past;
the children are forced to talk about
their grief but only at designated
times. Lazhar teaches language and
personal expression, and he values
it when students speak their mind,
but he also knows and has learned
the hard way that unwelcome
words can be dangerous. So much
of what happens in the movie relies
on what is and isn't said, and the
tacit deals that we make, for better
or worse. "Monsieur Lazhar" is qui
etly observed, withholds judgment,
asks many questions and offers no
easy answers.
