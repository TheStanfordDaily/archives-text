## 'BEST EXOTIC' GERIATRIC AVENGERS

-*■ A -r-hile I hate to paraphrase Dame
\/\ / Judi Denchatthe end of "The Best
T V Exotic Marigold Hotel," her char
acter notes in her "e-lec-tronic" blog that
sometimes success is measured by how you
cope with failure. Following her mantra, the
audience will surely have to test themselves
and succeed admirably.

As "The Avengers" swept through box
offices, "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" was
served up as the perfect counterprogramming,
Instead of a wide, sprawling team of brawny
men in shiny spandex suits exploding space
monsters, the AARP card-carrying crowd
could turn out to see a wide, sprawling team
of British acting royalty in dowdy clothes
flounce around India. As any new convert to
the BBC's incomparable "Downton Abbey"
will tell you, a little Maggie Smith goes a long
way, and excitement for this independent
British travelogue was at a fever pitch.
The trailers delineated the flimsy concept
pretty well. Seven geriatric Brits, for their own
personal and tragic reasons, decide to retire at
a hotel in exotic India for "the elderly and
beautiful," run by an over-eager Indian native
(Dev Patel of "Slumdog Millionaire"). Dame
Judi Dench ("Casino Royale") plays Evelyn, a
widow looking for a change; Tom Wilkinson's
("Michael Clayton") character Graham is

returning to India to look for a long lost
friend; Bill Nighy ("Love Actually") and
Penelope Wilton ("Downton Abbey") portray

the Ainslie couple, constantly dealing with
their relationship problems; and the exquisite
Maggie Smith ("Harry Potter") is Muriel, a
single woman who is forced to go to India for
urgent surgery. With another pair of sexually
charged geriatrics who provide for comic
relief, they all bravely leave for India.
Before they depart, the band of Brits
make several comments about how worried
they are about interacting with the Indians,
eating curry and living in a third world coun
try. These come off as insensitive at times, but
as these stories tend to go, surely they will all
learn a lot about the culture while learning
something about themselves. This seems to be
reinforced when they get to the titular Best
Exotic Marigold Hotel and it is not as adver
tised. They are the only guests, but their

overeager host certainly comforts them.
Unfortunately, what ensues is not the
delightful clash of cultures that one expects.
Instead, the elderly Brits stick mostly to them
selves, have relationship issues and struggle
with their issues amongst themselves. They do
interact with the locals to some extent, and the
hotel owner has some issues with an arranged
marriage, but the script seems like it would
have been groundbreaking in 1982. For
instance, Muriel shows momentary kindness
to her maid. We then learn that the maid is an
untouchable in the Indian caste system, and
this brief acknowledgment is the most mean
ingful moment of her life. This inaccurate and
pedantic showing of the treatment of cultures
just feels perfunctory at best and exploitative


at worst throughout the entire
film.
This inconsiderate treatment
of cultures doesn't really affect the
movie though, as director John
Madden ("Shakespeare in Love")
mostly chooses to ignore India and
the culture around them. It never
creates a new vision, resting com
fortably with its dry British wit and
the subtleties of any repressed
drama. For a decent British inde
pendent comedy, it is definitely
possible to find worse, though. The
film wildly succeeds as an antidote
to "The Avengers," and this is all it
needs to do.
