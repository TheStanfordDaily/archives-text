Applications for Arts Intensive,
one of four September Studies sem
inar-based programs offered in the
weeks leading into autumn quarter,
have risen for the coming academic
year, according to Stanford Intro
ductory Studies (SIS) administra
tors. The number of students who
applied for Sophomore College, an
other September Studies program,
has remained stable.

More than 500 of the 1,709
freshmen in the Class of 2015 ap
plied to at least one Sophomore
College seminar for the coming ac
ademic year, resulting in 1,100 sub
mitted applications by the April 9
deadline, according to Lee West, as
sociate director of SIS. With 240 in
terested students, next year's Arts
Intensive program received 371 ap
plications, 64 more than last year.
"Slightly more than a third of all
freshmen applied to at least one
Sophomore College or Arts Inten
sive seminar (with some students
applying to both programs)," wrote
West in an email to The Daily.
"While only freshmen can apply to
Sophomore College, freshmen,
sophomores and juniors can apply
to the Arts Intensive program."
Of the Sophomore College ap
plicants, 212 were accepted into

their first choice seminars, and 266
were rejected from all of their
choices as of May 8, according to
West.

For admitted students, this Sep
tember may provide the chance to
conduct evolutionary biology re
search in the Galapagos, explore a
character in musical theater or ex
perience an intensive Spanish im
mersion course.

Arts Intensive received a range
of applications this year, with near
ly 50 percent coming from fresh
men and the other 50 percent dis
tributed equally among the other
classes, according to Gina Flernan
dez, director of arts in undergradu
