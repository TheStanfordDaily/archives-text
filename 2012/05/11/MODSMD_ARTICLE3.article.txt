# Arts Intensive apps increase
## Number of applicants for Sophomore College remains steady, Arts Intensive sees more interest 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
Applications for Arts Intensive,
one of four September Studies sem
inar-based programs offered in the
weeks leading into autumn quarter,
have risen for the coming academic
year, according to Stanford Intro
ductory Studies (SIS) administra
tors. The number of students who
applied for Sophomore College, an
other September Studies program,
has remained stable.

More than 500 of the 1,709
freshmen in the Class of 2015 ap
plied to at least one Sophomore
College seminar for the coming ac
ademic year, resulting in 1,100 sub
mitted applications by the April 9
deadline, according to Lee West, as
sociate director of SIS. With 240 in
terested students, next year's Arts
Intensive program received 371 ap
plications, 64 more than last year.
"Slightly more than a third of all
freshmen applied to at least one
Sophomore College or Arts Inten
sive seminar (with some students
applying to both programs)," wrote
West in an email to The Daily.
"While only freshmen can apply to
Sophomore College, freshmen,
sophomores and juniors can apply
to the Arts Intensive program."
Of the Sophomore College ap
plicants, 212 were accepted into

their first choice seminars, and 266
were rejected from all of their
choices as of May 8, according to
West.

For admitted students, this Sep
tember may provide the chance to
conduct evolutionary biology re
search in the Galapagos, explore a
character in musical theater or ex
perience an intensive Spanish im
mersion course.

Arts Intensive received a range
of applications this year, with near
ly 50 percent coming from fresh
men and the other 50 percent dis
tributed equally among the other
classes, according to Gina Flernan
dez, director of arts in undergradu

ate education.
"Most courses have two or
three times the number of appli
cations in comparison to the num
ber of spots available," West
wrote, noting that the reason for
such an influx of applications may
be that students apply to multiple
seminars.

Some seminars, however, re
ceive more than the usual average
of around 40 applications, accord
ing to West. Particularly, "Darwin,
Evolution, and Galapagos" re
ceived the most interest this year,
garnering 153 applications, ac
cording to West. In comparison,
one Sophomore College seminar
received 14 applications this year.

"We enrolled 121 students in
[Arts Intensive] 2011 and expect
that this will remain roughly the
same this year," Hernandez wrote
in an email to The Daily.
"Occasionally a course is not
filled through the initial applica
tion period," West wrote, adding
that at least one course has not
been filled this year. "In those
cases we invite any student who
applied to Sophomore College or
Arts Intensive (freshmen only)
and was either waitlisted or not
chosen for a seminar to apply for
the open course. We fill spaces on
a rolling basis; we are committed
to filling every space in the pro
grams."

According to West, the num
ber of Sophomore College cours
es offered will not change in the
foreseeable future, but students
can expect an increase in Arts In
tensive options next year

Over the next few months, 212
students will remain on waitlists.
Those already enrolled, however,
can look forward to preliminary
class meetings over the last few
weeks of spring quarter.
"We're going to about 10 dif
ferent shows at the Oregon
Shakespeare Festival," said Jessia
Hoffman 'l5, who was accepted
into the "Learning Theater"
Sophomore College seminar
after applying to two Arts Inten
sive seminars as well. "We're
going to get to talk to actors and
go backstage."
"I'm going to be doing the
'Face of Battle' sophomore col
lege with Scott Sagan," said Ariel
la Axler 'l5, a staff writer for The
Daily who was admitted to her
first choice seminar. "We get to go
to Washington, D.C., Gettysburg
and Montana and learn about
Civil War battles by going to the

sites, and at the same time we're
also going to undertake our own
research topics ... I'm excited to
meet a lot of students that are also
interested in the topic, because I
think those will be people that I'll
be studying with in the future."
