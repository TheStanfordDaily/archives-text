## Steele talks 'stereotype threat' effect 79th annual Cubberley Lecture addresses social psychology 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
Claude Steele, dean of the School
of Education, spoke about the con
cept of "stereotype threat," which he
developed largely through his own
research, at the 79th annual Cubber
ley Lecture Thursday evening.
"You can find [stereotype threat]
virtually anywhere you look," Steele
said. "There is no group for which
there is not a negative stereotype."
Stereotype threat is defined as a
feeling of anxiety in a situation where
a person has the potential to conform
to a negative stereotype about his or
her social group, whether that is race,
gender, socioeconomic class or any
other aspect of identity.
Almost 400 audience members
crowded into Cubberley Auditorium
to listen to Steele present with two
other researchers, Geoffrey Cohen
Ph.D. '9B, a professor in the School of
Education and the psychology de
partment, and Greg Walton 'OO, an
assistant professor of psychology,
who shared more current research
on stereotype threat.
To illustrate the idea of stereotype
threat to the audience, Steele showed
a clip from Eminem's biographical
movie "8 Mile." In the scene, Em
inem freezes up before the crowd be
cause he feels threatened at a rap
battle where he is the only white per
son in the club.
"That was a rough day for Em
inem," Steele said.
Walton presented another fa
mous example of stereotype threat.
He read a senior thesis written by
Michelle Obama, who was a Prince
ton student in 1985.
"'lt often seems as if, to them
[white students and professors], I will
always be black first and a student
second,'" Walton said, quoting
Obama.

Steele said that understanding
stereotype threat could help to di
minish the achievement gap be
tween different races in the class
room.

"It isn't the entire bulk of the
achievement gap," he said, "but
it's a big part."

Steele cited one of his famous
experiments done on stereotype
threat, which found that, on aver
age, African American students
scored one standard deviation
lower than white students on an
IQ test. However, when African
American students were told that
the test was a puzzle, rather than a
test of intellectual ability, the gap
disappeared.
"Your intelligence is not on
the line in a puzzle ... it's your re
sponse to that stereotype that gets
you distracted and prevents you
from doing well on that test,"

Steele said.
If there is no perceived stereo
type or if the person does not care
about performance in the given
area, they will not be affected by
stereotype threat, according to
Steele.

"What is interesting about
stereotype threat is that what
makes you vulnerable is being in
vested in the domain where your
group has a negative stereotype,"
Steele said.

After describing the phenom
enon of stereotype threat and giv
ing examples of how it can be
detrimental in the classroom,
Steele, Cohen and Walton de
scribed various possible solutions
to the phenomenon.
The first and most important
way to reduce the effects of
stereotype threat, Steele said, is to
reduce legal and societal barriers
to certain identity groups. Steele
gave several examples of these
barriers, including Jim Crow-era
segregation and bans on same-sex
marriage.

He also said that an important
way to combat stereotype threat
is to develop a "critical mass" of

people who share an identity, be
cause it is easier for people to
combat prejudice in groups.
Affirmative action, Steele
said, is an important step in devel
oping critical masses for minori
ties on college campuses.

Walton said that another im
portant way to combat stereotype
threat is to make minority stu
dents feel like they belong at
school. In an experiment that
Walton and Cohen performed
with a group of college freshmen,
they found that freshmen per
formed better if they knew how
much their peers had struggled to
find a place at college.

Cohen said that while the tech
niques implemented by the ex
perimenters did have a significant
impact on the performance of the
students in question, they did not
have to be implemented by scien
tists.

"These interventions sent the
exact same message as valuable
teachers send to their students
every day," said Cohen.

"You can find [stereotype threat]
virtually anywhere you look," Steele
said. "There is no group for which
there is not a negative stereotype."
Stereotype threat is defined as a
feeling of anxiety in a situation where
a person has the potential to conform
to a negative stereotype about his or
her social group, whether that is race,
gender, socioeconomic class or any
other aspect of identity.
Almost 400 audience members
crowded into Cubberley Auditorium
to listen to Steele present with two
other researchers, Geoffrey Cohen
Ph.D. '9B, a professor in the School of
Education and the psychology de
partment, and Greg Walton 'OO, an
assistant professor of psychology,
who shared more current research
on stereotype threat.
To illustrate the idea of stereotype
threat to the audience, Steele showed
a clip from Eminem's biographical
movie "8 Mile." In the scene, Em
inem freezes up before the crowd be
cause he feels threatened at a rap
battle where he is the only white per
son in the club.
"That was a rough day for Em
inem," Steele said.
Walton presented another fa
mous example of stereotype threat.
He read a senior thesis written by
Michelle Obama, who was a Prince
ton student in 1985.
"'lt often seems as if, to them
[white students and professors], I will
always be black first and a student
second,'" Walton said, quoting
Obama.

Steele said that understanding
stereotype threat could help to di
minish the achievement gap be
tween different races in the class
room.

"It isn't the entire bulk of the
achievement gap," he said, "but
it's a big part."

Steele cited one of his famous
experiments done on stereotype
threat, which found that, on aver
age, African American students
scored one standard deviation
lower than white students on an
IQ test. However, when African
American students were told that
the test was a puzzle, rather than a
test of intellectual ability, the gap
disappeared.
"Your intelligence is not on
the line in a puzzle ... it's your re
sponse to that stereotype that gets
you distracted and prevents you
from doing well on that test,"

Steele said.
If there is no perceived stereo
type or if the person does not care
about performance in the given
area, they will not be affected by
stereotype threat, according to
Steele.

"What is interesting about
stereotype threat is that what
makes you vulnerable is being in
vested in the domain where your
group has a negative stereotype,"
Steele said.

After describing the phenom
enon of stereotype threat and giv
ing examples of how it can be
detrimental in the classroom,
Steele, Cohen and Walton de
scribed various possible solutions
to the phenomenon.
The first and most important
way to reduce the effects of
stereotype threat, Steele said, is to
reduce legal and societal barriers
to certain identity groups. Steele
gave several examples of these
barriers, including Jim Crow-era
segregation and bans on same-sex
marriage.

He also said that an important
way to combat stereotype threat
is to develop a "critical mass" of

people who share an identity, be
cause it is easier for people to
combat prejudice in groups.
Affirmative action, Steele
said, is an important step in devel
oping critical masses for minori
ties on college campuses.

Walton said that another im
portant way to combat stereotype
threat is to make minority stu
dents feel like they belong at
school. In an experiment that
Walton and Cohen performed
with a group of college freshmen,
they found that freshmen per
formed better if they knew how
much their peers had struggled to
find a place at college.

Cohen said that while the tech
niques implemented by the ex
perimenters did have a significant
impact on the performance of the
students in question, they did not
have to be implemented by scien
tists.

"These interventions sent the
exact same message as valuable
teachers send to their students
every day," said Cohen.
