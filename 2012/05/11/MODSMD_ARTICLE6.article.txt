The Class of 2016 admission cycle, the
first after the Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission announced the permanent installa
tion of alumni interviews, saw similar suc
cess for the program. A three-year interview
pilot program proved popular among both
applicants and interviewers, and the Univer
sity endorsed its full implementation in the
next "five years or so," according to the Ad
mission Office.

When the current program reaches its
full capacity, the Office of Undergraduate
Admission expects to work with around
10,000 to 12,000 alumni to interview around
30,000 to 40,000 applicants. During the most
recent application cycle, about 10 percent of
applicants were granted the interview op
tion. According to Assistant Dean of Admis
sion Debra von Bargen, the vast majority
took advantage of the opportunity.
These students had high school zip codes
in the Atlanta, Denver, New York City,
Philadelphia, Raleigh-Durham and Wash
ington, D.C., areas; attended school in the
states of Maryland, Massachusetts, Min
nesota, Oregon and Virginia; or studied in
ternationally in Ireland and the United
Kingdom. As the program expands to more
areas, the Office of Undergraduate Admis
sion is also seeking to develop options for
students in areas such as China and India
that have growing applicant pools.
To determine the value of the program,
the Office of Undergraduate Admission
evaluated alumni response and the overall
impact of interviews on decisions made by
the admission committee.

According to von Bargen, benefits in
cluded allowing the applicant to expand on
his or her ideas and interests, gain a person
al connection to Stanford and present him
or herself to the admission office in a more
informal light.
