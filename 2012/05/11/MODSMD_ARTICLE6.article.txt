## Interviews offer perspective to applicants Alumni interviews permanent part of application process with 2016 cycle 
### SARAH MORE STAFF WRITER 
The Class of 2016 admission cycle, the
first after the Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission announced the permanent installa
tion of alumni interviews, saw similar suc
cess for the program. A three-year interview
pilot program proved popular among both
applicants and interviewers, and the Univer
sity endorsed its full implementation in the
next "five years or so," according to the Ad
mission Office.

When the current program reaches its
full capacity, the Office of Undergraduate
Admission expects to work with around
10,000 to 12,000 alumni to interview around
30,000 to 40,000 applicants. During the most
recent application cycle, about 10 percent of
applicants were granted the interview op
tion. According to Assistant Dean of Admis
sion Debra von Bargen, the vast majority
took advantage of the opportunity.
These students had high school zip codes
in the Atlanta, Denver, New York City,
Philadelphia, Raleigh-Durham and Wash
ington, D.C., areas; attended school in the
states of Maryland, Massachusetts, Min
nesota, Oregon and Virginia; or studied in
ternationally in Ireland and the United
Kingdom. As the program expands to more
areas, the Office of Undergraduate Admis
sion is also seeking to develop options for
students in areas such as China and India
that have growing applicant pools.
To determine the value of the program,
the Office of Undergraduate Admission
evaluated alumni response and the overall
impact of interviews on decisions made by
the admission committee.

According to von Bargen, benefits in
cluded allowing the applicant to expand on
his or her ideas and interests, gain a person
al connection to Stanford and present him
or herself to the admission office in a more
informal light.

"We hope to get a sense from the conver
sation between the interviewer and the ap-
plicant what it might be like to
have this particular individual join
the Stanford community," von
Bargen said in an email to The
Daily. "Our interviewer training
stresses this last point, that the in
terview is designed as a conversa
tion, not a quiz, and sets the Stan
ford program apart from many
others."

The training that alumni un
dergo includes a series of sessions
with admissions officers and
alumni chairs and a new online
presentation, in order to expose
interviewers to sample questions
and conversations.

"I prefer the word conversa
tion because I believe that's how
interviews should be conducted
and not a Q&A session," said
alumni interviewer Taara Hassan
'O3 in an email to The Daily. "For
tunately, all of the applicants I in
terviewed were so 'rich' in their
lives and at such a young age that
it was very easy to be naturally in
terested in what they had to say
and share without forcing any
thing."

Alumni interviewer Steven
Jewell '74 expanded on the insight
gained by these conversations.
"It helps flesh out a person be
yond what can be seen in the writ
ten word and on a computer
screen," Jewell said. "It provides
additional insight into the per
son's motivation and what excites
them intellectually. In worst cases,
it corroborates the written record,
but on occasion it actually pro
vides something quite unexpected
and very helpful for assessing the
candidate."

Nicole Himmel 'l5 participated
in an alumni interview as part of
her application and described the
experience as casual and helpful.
"We met up at a little cafe, and
he asked me about myself, what
characteristics I thought I was the
best at, what my friends thought
about me, fun questions," Himmel
said.

In addition to providing
prospective students a forum to
elaborate on information already
presented in their applications.

the interviews are also away for
applicants to talk about other cir
cumstances that affected their ac
ademic or extracurricular life in
high school.

The interviews are not re
quired, even when available to
students, but are merely an option
for applicants who wish to partici
pate, in areas where an alumni in
terviewer is available.

"I would definitely recom
mend it [doing an interview] to
anyone who's applying to Stan
ford," Himmel said, "ft can only
help you. I asked him about a lot
of the interdisciplinary stuff and
he had majored in his own inter
disciplinary major, so that was
cool getting that information from
him."

The interview process also pro
vides alumni the opportunity to
re-engage with their alma mater
and gain insight into Stanford's
future.

"The optional interview
process . . . exposes prospective
students to Stanford's 'living his
tory' by interacting with [alumni]
and allows for asking questions
from those who had the amazing
opportunity to experience the
Farm," Hassan wrote. "But it also
allows [alumni] to remain con
nected and see firsthand the
amazing individuals that may be
come part of and contribute to
Stanford's unparalleled learning
environment."

Moving forward, the Office of
Undergraduate Admission has
not set a specific timeline on the
complete integration of the alum
ni interview option for all candi
dates but is planning gradual ex
pansion of the program in the
coming years.

"Our big challenge at the mo
ment is creating a robust, user
friendly technology system to
help us manage the expansion,"
von Bargen said. "We are moving
ahead, but with great care that we
do it right from the outset. Be
cause ours is a young program,
relative to our peer institutions,
we know we have many opportu
nities to improve and refine the
program as we grow, and our
alumni seldom hesitate to offer
suggestions."

he asked me about myself, what
characteristics I thought I was the
best at, what my friends thought
about me, fun questions," Himmel
said.

In addition to providing
prospective students a forum to
elaborate on information already
presented in their applications.

the interviews are also away for
applicants to talk about other cir
cumstances that affected their ac
ademic or extracurricular life in
high school.

The interviews are not re
quired, even when available to
students, but are merely an option
for applicants who wish to partici
pate, in areas where an alumni in
terviewer is available.

"I would definitely recom
mend it [doing an interview] to
anyone who's applying to Stan
ford," Himmel said, "ft can only
help you. I asked him about a lot
of the interdisciplinary stuff and
he had majored in his own inter
disciplinary major, so that was
cool getting that information from
him."

The interview process also pro
vides alumni the opportunity to
re-engage with their alma mater
and gain insight into Stanford's
future.

"The optional interview
process . . . exposes prospective
students to Stanford's 'living his
tory' by interacting with [alumni]
and allows for asking questions
from those who had the amazing
opportunity to experience the
Farm," Hassan wrote. "But it also
allows [alumni] to remain con
nected and see firsthand the
amazing individuals that may be
come part of and contribute to
Stanford's unparalleled learning
environment."

Moving forward, the Office of
Undergraduate Admission has
not set a specific timeline on the
complete integration of the alum
ni interview option for all candi
dates but is planning gradual ex
pansion of the program in the
coming years.

"Our big challenge at the mo
ment is creating a robust, user
friendly technology system to
help us manage the expansion,"
von Bargen said. "We are moving
ahead, but with great care that we
do it right from the outset. Be
cause ours is a young program,
relative to our peer institutions,
we know we have many opportu
nities to improve and refine the
program as we grow, and our
alumni seldom hesitate to offer
suggestions."

The Class of 2016 admission cycle, the
first after the Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission announced the permanent installa
tion of alumni interviews, saw similar suc
cess for the program. A three-year interview
pilot program proved popular among both
applicants and interviewers, and the Univer
sity endorsed its full implementation in the
next "five years or so," according to the Ad
mission Office.

When the current program reaches its
full capacity, the Office of Undergraduate
Admission expects to work with around
10,000 to 12,000 alumni to interview around
30,000 to 40,000 applicants. During the most
recent application cycle, about 10 percent of
applicants were granted the interview op
tion. According to Assistant Dean of Admis
sion Debra von Bargen, the vast majority
took advantage of the opportunity.
These students had high school zip codes
in the Atlanta, Denver, New York City,
Philadelphia, Raleigh-Durham and Wash
ington, D.C., areas; attended school in the
states of Maryland, Massachusetts, Min
nesota, Oregon and Virginia; or studied in
ternationally in Ireland and the United
Kingdom. As the program expands to more
areas, the Office of Undergraduate Admis
sion is also seeking to develop options for
students in areas such as China and India
that have growing applicant pools.
To determine the value of the program,
the Office of Undergraduate Admission
evaluated alumni response and the overall
impact of interviews on decisions made by
the admission committee.

According to von Bargen, benefits in
cluded allowing the applicant to expand on
his or her ideas and interests, gain a person
al connection to Stanford and present him
or herself to the admission office in a more
informal light.

"We hope to get a sense from the conver
sation between the interviewer and the ap-
plicant what it might be like to
have this particular individual join
the Stanford community," von
Bargen said in an email to The
Daily. "Our interviewer training
stresses this last point, that the in
terview is designed as a conversa
tion, not a quiz, and sets the Stan
ford program apart from many
others."

The training that alumni un
dergo includes a series of sessions
with admissions officers and
alumni chairs and a new online
presentation, in order to expose
interviewers to sample questions
and conversations.

"I prefer the word conversa
tion because I believe that's how
interviews should be conducted
and not a Q&A session," said
alumni interviewer Taara Hassan
'O3 in an email to The Daily. "For
tunately, all of the applicants I in
terviewed were so 'rich' in their
lives and at such a young age that
it was very easy to be naturally in
terested in what they had to say
and share without forcing any
thing."

Alumni interviewer Steven
Jewell '74 expanded on the insight
gained by these conversations.
"It helps flesh out a person be
yond what can be seen in the writ
ten word and on a computer
screen," Jewell said. "It provides
additional insight into the per
son's motivation and what excites
them intellectually. In worst cases,
it corroborates the written record,
but on occasion it actually pro
vides something quite unexpected
and very helpful for assessing the
candidate."

Nicole Himmel 'l5 participated
in an alumni interview as part of
her application and described the
experience as casual and helpful.
