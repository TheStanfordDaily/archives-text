## EDITORIAL Organ donation: Legal fictions and Facebook timelines 
### 
On May 1, Mark Zuckerburg,
in an interview with "Good
Morning America," encour
aged Facebook users to announce
their intention to be an organ donor
on their Facebook timelines. An
nouncing that you're an organ donor
on your Facebook timeline is not
legally binding, but if you indicate an
intention to donate, a link takes you
to your state's donor registry website
where you can legally commit to
being an organ donor. The an
nouncement, according to some re
ports, has had a large and tangible im
pact: More than 100,000 people up
dated their statuses to indicate that
they are donors, and 22,000 of them
followed the link to their state reg
istries. Though it is difficult to deter
mine how many people actually reg
istered, California has a telling statis
tic: An average of 70 people register
as organ donors online each day, but
in the day following Facebook's an
nouncement, 3,900 people signed up.
Facebook's dual aims sparking a
conversation around organ donation
and enabling people to register to do
nate are admirable for many rea
sons. But although we on the Editori
al Board applaud Facebook's deci
sion, we contend that it is important
to have a transparent conversation
about the actual process of procuring
organs now that organ donation has
become a public part of one's Face
book identity.
The benefits of organ donation
are clear. Over 114,000 Americans
are currently on waiting lists for
transplants and a person dies waiting
for a transplant every four hours.
Furthermore, 90 percent of Ameri
cans support organ donation, but
only a third of licensed drivers regis
ter to donate. Viewed through this
lens, organ donation is a simple deci
sion to save a life when yours is taken,
and adding organ donation to the
Facebook timeline is laudable at best
and innocuous at worst.

lustrated that people can still per

such as digesting food, healing
wounds, growing and even success
fully bringing a child to term dur
ing "whole brain death" with the aid
of mechanical ventilation. As a re
sult, the authors argue that defining
death in terms of "whole brain
death" is a legal fiction: "Whole brain
death" is a legal requirement con
structed because many of us feel that
people with brain death have "lost"
the capacities that make them
human. "Whole brain death," how
ever, is not really death, since the pa
tient can still perform core physio
logical functions.
"Whole brain death" is relatively
rare in organ donations; more dona
tions come from people with ad
vanced directives that tell doctors to
withdraw life support, thereby dis
continuing circulation. Surgeons
then wait before procuring the or
gans: usually two to five minutes after
the cessation of cardiac activity, but
sometimes as early as 75 seconds. The
authors argue that determining
death by this criterion is an "anticipa
tory fiction": It allows us to treat
something that is aboutto occur as if
it has already happened. When a doc
tor withdraws life support, there is no
certainty that circulation has irre
versibly stopped in that short time
period, but waiting too long damages
the viability of the organs. As a result,
defining death based on the cessa
tion of circulation is another legal re
quirement that does not correspond
to our intuitive notions of death.

The authors ultimately conclude
that these two determinations of
death are ethical the organ donor
who consented to donation was at
least theoretically aware that this is
how death is determined. Further
more, failing to determine death by
these criteria would deny the donor
their wish of organ donation. Yet the
authors also argue that in practice,
the donor is rarely aware of how
death is determined; there is an
alarming lack of transparency
around the issue. One of Facebook's
aims in adding organ donation to the
timeline feature is to start a robust
conversation about the importance
of registering to be a donor. We
wholeheartedly agree, but we need
to make sure that the facts regarding
organ donation and "death" are as
transparent as possible to ensure that
people make informed decisions.

Yet as bioethicists have pointed
out, the process for determining
death in order to procure a person's
organs is very rarely discussed in
transparent terms. "Death and Legal
Fictions," a 2011 article in the Journal
of Medical Ethics, describes the
evolving definitions of death over the
past 40 years. Traditionally, "whole
brain death" is a prerequisite for
organ procurement from a donor
whose heart is still beating. However,
recent neurological evidence has il-
