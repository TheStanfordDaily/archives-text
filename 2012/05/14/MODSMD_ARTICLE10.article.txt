I ■ Cu vi parolas Es
peranton?" is
Esperanto for
* "Excuse me, do
you speak Esperanto?" While
most people will not understand
this phrase, the language was cre
ated to be a universal tongue.
In 1887, L. L. Zamenhof de
signed Esperanto as the "univer
sal language" in an attempt to
break down the linguistic and cul
tural barriers that prevent cross
national conversations. In Za
menhof's ideal world, everyone
would continue speaking his or
her native tongue, but speak Es
peranto as a second "planned"
language as away to communi
cate with all people.
Stanford offers a free drop-in
class called "Conversational Es
peranto, the International Lan
guage" on Tuesdays from 6:30
p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at the Bechtel In
ternational Center. Students can
take the class for two credits a
quarter through the Linguistics
Department. The class website
guarantees that, following course
work requirements, students and
community members will learn the
language within a year.
"Even four lessons are enough
to get more than just the basics,"
the Esperanto at Stanford website
reads.
The teacher of the class goes by
the name Trio, explaining that Ed
Williger, his given name, just does
n't work in some languages.
"Trio is short and is pronounce
able, and as of right now, I haven't
had any sort of problem with it," he
said.
He is reluctant to call himself a
teacher, but since he has been
teaching the class for 21 years, he
"guesses that he is a teacher just
because he's been doing it for so
long." Trio teaches voluntarily and
has been on the Stanford campus
teaching Esperanto at the same lo
cation and time for the last 21
years.
Five students, ranging from
young undergraduates to older
alumni fill the small back room at
the Bechtel International Center
for his class, which begins with a
cultural discussion as well as Es
peranto music of all genres

from rap to rock.
One of the students in the class
is Julie Spickler '62, who started to
learn Esperanto in the summer of
1994 in a 10 lesson course. By fall,
Spickler had finished the class and
her teacher urged her to come to
monthly meetings of the local Es
peranto community in San Fran
cisco to converse with other Esper
antists.
"I didn't want to go at first be
cause I thought it would be too dif
ficult," Spickler said. "But my
teacher said to try it ... you'll find
it is easier than you think ... and
sure enough I could understand
half to three quarters of what the
others were saying after just study
ing four or five months on my own
without hearing anyone speak it."
She brought a book to class,
"Konciza Etimologia Vortaro," a
concise etymological Esperanto
dictionary, explaining that Es
peranto is rooted in multiple lan
guages. Mostly, Esperanto borrows
from Romance languages because
of Zamenhof's own background.
"He was very idealistic and
lived in a town in Poland under
Russian rule where there were
four or five language groups which
were not always friendly to each
other," Spickler said. "He decided

that to help decrease misunder
standings, they needed a common
language. Though it's true a com
mon language doesn't prevent
conflict, it definitely helps."
Spickler has been attending the
Stanford Esperanto class for the
past 10 years and says that the
number of students in the class
fluctuates widely. According to
her, some students come in for
only a few classes and then leave,
thanking everyone for helping
them learn Esperanto so quickly.
What she finds curious is that new
students come in periodically, but
the new male students never seem
to meet the new female students
because they come in at different
times, a trend that Trio also noted.
"We tell the guys,'Oh yeah, girls
take this class. There are girls that
speak Esperanto. You just never
see them,"' Trio said. "This hap
pens all the time it's a running
joke among us old farts."
Trio is a computer consultant
who uses Esperanto almost every
day. He said that he sometimes
plays online Go, a board game that
originated in ancient China, with
other Esperantists around the
world.

"Esperanto is my political
work," Trio said. "I believe in the

ideals of it, and I believe that
everyone can work together if
everyone decides to keep Es
peranto as a common language."
"Esperanto really levels every
one out, since we all come in on the
same ground, having it as our sec
ond language," he said. "There are
only a few native speakers of Es
peranto, but they don't dominate."
Native Esperanto speakers are
those born into families that speak
Esperanto and acquire the lan
guage from childhood.
Trio became interested in Es
peranto when he was studying eco
nomics in the 19705. He had want
ed to live in China, Sweden and
Yugoslavia but realized that he
would have to learn quite a few dif
ferent and difficult languages.
While reading the book "One Lan
guage for the World" by Mario Pei,
Trio first encountered Esperanto
and thought that it might solve the
obstacle he was facing.
According to Trio, the Esperan
to community around the world
forms a unique and global bond.
"When the war in Yugoslavia
broke out, I had stayed with Esper
antists, who also took in other Es
perantists who needed shelter,"
Trio said. "You wouldn't just do
that with someone else if you both

spoke English. Samideano —
that's what we call each other. It
translates to 'same idea person,'
but what it means is that we're on
the same planet on the same level."
One of his other memorable ex
periences with the language was
when he applied for citizenship in
Hungary, and Esperantists trans
lated the application for him.
Esperanto is the most widely
spoken invented language in the
world. While no definitive number
of Esperanto speakers exists, the
BBC reports between 500,000 and
two million speakers worldwide. It
has a national organization that sets
linguistic standards and is the only
invented language for which speak
ers can be certified. Many musical
lyrics and works of literature from
different languages have been
translated into Esperanto for the
Esperanto-speaking international
community to enjoy. For example,
Trio finds the Winnie the Pooh Es
peranto translation "fantastic."
At Stanford, Scott Parks 'l3 co
founded the Esperanto Club.
Parks became interested in learn
ing Esperanto during the summer
between his high school senior
year and his freshman year, finding
it "really, really easy."
"We decided we wanted to
make a student group with the
local Esperanto community and
we have been meeting since then,"
Parks said.
Although many of the club
members were interested in Es
peranto, many were also interested
in what Parks called "conlinging,"
or constructive languages.
"So we changed our focus to
conlinging and linguistics in gener
al and are working on learning
Mandarin specifically this quar
ter," he said.
Parks noted that the local Es
peranto community is strong but
aging. According to him, not
enough members in the student
community or the younger genera
tion are engaged in the effort to
learn and spread the language.
"Esperanto isn't doing as well
as it was 20 years ago," he said.
"But it isn't going to die out any
time soon either it still has an
international standing. Esperanto
gatherings . . . are still going
strong."

I ■ Cu vi parolas Es
peranton?" is
Esperanto for
* "Excuse me, do
you speak Esperanto?" While
most people will not understand
this phrase, the language was cre
ated to be a universal tongue.
In 1887, L. L. Zamenhof de
signed Esperanto as the "univer
sal language" in an attempt to
break down the linguistic and cul
tural barriers that prevent cross
national conversations. In Za
menhof's ideal world, everyone
would continue speaking his or
her native tongue, but speak Es
peranto as a second "planned"
language as away to communi
cate with all people.
Stanford offers a free drop-in
class called "Conversational Es
peranto, the International Lan
guage" on Tuesdays from 6:30
p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at the Bechtel In
ternational Center. Students can
take the class for two credits a
quarter through the Linguistics
Department. The class website
guarantees that, following course
work requirements, students and
community members will learn the
language within a year.
"Even four lessons are enough
to get more than just the basics,"
the Esperanto at Stanford website
reads.
The teacher of the class goes by
the name Trio, explaining that Ed
Williger, his given name, just does
n't work in some languages.
"Trio is short and is pronounce
able, and as of right now, I haven't
had any sort of problem with it," he
said.
He is reluctant to call himself a
teacher, but since he has been
teaching the class for 21 years, he
"guesses that he is a teacher just
because he's been doing it for so
long." Trio teaches voluntarily and
has been on the Stanford campus
teaching Esperanto at the same lo
cation and time for the last 21
years.
Five students, ranging from
young undergraduates to older
alumni fill the small back room at
the Bechtel International Center
for his class, which begins with a
cultural discussion as well as Es
peranto music of all genres

from rap to rock.
One of the students in the class
is Julie Spickler '62, who started to
learn Esperanto in the summer of
1994 in a 10 lesson course. By fall,
Spickler had finished the class and
her teacher urged her to come to
monthly meetings of the local Es
peranto community in San Fran
cisco to converse with other Esper
antists.
"I didn't want to go at first be
cause I thought it would be too dif
ficult," Spickler said. "But my
teacher said to try it ... you'll find
it is easier than you think ... and
sure enough I could understand
half to three quarters of what the
others were saying after just study
ing four or five months on my own
without hearing anyone speak it."
She brought a book to class,
"Konciza Etimologia Vortaro," a
concise etymological Esperanto
dictionary, explaining that Es
peranto is rooted in multiple lan
guages. Mostly, Esperanto borrows
from Romance languages because
of Zamenhof's own background.
"He was very idealistic and
lived in a town in Poland under
Russian rule where there were
four or five language groups which
were not always friendly to each
other," Spickler said. "He decided

that to help decrease misunder
standings, they needed a common
language. Though it's true a com
mon language doesn't prevent
conflict, it definitely helps."
Spickler has been attending the
Stanford Esperanto class for the
past 10 years and says that the
number of students in the class
fluctuates widely. According to
her, some students come in for
only a few classes and then leave,
thanking everyone for helping
them learn Esperanto so quickly.
What she finds curious is that new
students come in periodically, but
the new male students never seem
to meet the new female students
because they come in at different
times, a trend that Trio also noted.
"We tell the guys,'Oh yeah, girls
take this class. There are girls that
speak Esperanto. You just never
see them,"' Trio said. "This hap
pens all the time it's a running
joke among us old farts."
Trio is a computer consultant
who uses Esperanto almost every
day. He said that he sometimes
plays online Go, a board game that
originated in ancient China, with
other Esperantists around the
world.

"Esperanto is my political
work," Trio said. "I believe in the

ideals of it, and I believe that
everyone can work together if
everyone decides to keep Es
peranto as a common language."
"Esperanto really levels every
one out, since we all come in on the
same ground, having it as our sec
ond language," he said. "There are
only a few native speakers of Es
peranto, but they don't dominate."
Native Esperanto speakers are
those born into families that speak
Esperanto and acquire the lan
guage from childhood.
Trio became interested in Es
peranto when he was studying eco
nomics in the 19705. He had want
ed to live in China, Sweden and
Yugoslavia but realized that he
would have to learn quite a few dif
ferent and difficult languages.
While reading the book "One Lan
guage for the World" by Mario Pei,
Trio first encountered Esperanto
and thought that it might solve the
obstacle he was facing.
According to Trio, the Esperan
to community around the world
forms a unique and global bond.
"When the war in Yugoslavia
broke out, I had stayed with Esper
antists, who also took in other Es
perantists who needed shelter,"
Trio said. "You wouldn't just do
that with someone else if you both

spoke English. Samideano —
that's what we call each other. It
translates to 'same idea person,'
but what it means is that we're on
the same planet on the same level."
One of his other memorable ex
periences with the language was
when he applied for citizenship in
Hungary, and Esperantists trans
lated the application for him.
Esperanto is the most widely
spoken invented language in the
world. While no definitive number
of Esperanto speakers exists, the
BBC reports between 500,000 and
two million speakers worldwide. It
has a national organization that sets
linguistic standards and is the only
invented language for which speak
ers can be certified. Many musical
lyrics and works of literature from
different languages have been
translated into Esperanto for the
Esperanto-speaking international
community to enjoy. For example,
Trio finds the Winnie the Pooh Es
peranto translation "fantastic."
At Stanford, Scott Parks 'l3 co
founded the Esperanto Club.
Parks became interested in learn
ing Esperanto during the summer
between his high school senior
year and his freshman year, finding
it "really, really easy."
"We decided we wanted to
make a student group with the
local Esperanto community and
we have been meeting since then,"
Parks said.
Although many of the club
members were interested in Es
peranto, many were also interested
in what Parks called "conlinging,"
or constructive languages.
"So we changed our focus to
conlinging and linguistics in gener
al and are working on learning
Mandarin specifically this quar
ter," he said.
Parks noted that the local Es
peranto community is strong but
aging. According to him, not
enough members in the student
community or the younger genera
tion are engaged in the effort to
learn and spread the language.
"Esperanto isn't doing as well
as it was 20 years ago," he said.
"But it isn't going to die out any
time soon either it still has an
international standing. Esperanto
gatherings . . . are still going
strong."
