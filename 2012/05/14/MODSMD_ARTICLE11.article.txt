## Library use steady in uncertain times 
### â€“ Elena Ayala-Hurtado 
A 2OOB article in the Times High
er Education supplement stat
ed, "School libraries are suf
fering, and even closing, as re
sources are cut, staff 'rede
ployed' and the Internet deemed more
important to learning than printed mat
ter."
Such a trend, however, has not materi
alized at Stanford, according to Andrew
Herkovic, director of communications
and development for the Stanford Li
braries.
"[The idea of] 'the end of the library'
turns out to be completely untrue at Stan
ford," Herkovic said. "We have not seen
any net decrease [in users] over the years
in each of the libraries, and I don't think
we will."
Of the 20 libraries at Stanford, Green
Library is the most widely used, especial
ly by undergraduates. According to Chris
Bourg, assistant university librarian,
Green has averaged over 600,000 visitors
a year over the last five years.
According to Hoover Library librari
an Paul Thomas, most undergraduates
tend to use Green Library. He added that
"fewer students use our collections be
cause [they're] more geared toward
scholars and graduate students."
Nevertheless, according to Nick
Sierkierski, exhibits and outreach co-co
ordinator at the Hoover Institution, the
Hoover Library does not lack under
graduate visitors. He cites the presenta
tions and tours that he organizes for un
dergraduates, particularly for primary
source materials used in classes in the
Program in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR)
and Structured Liberal Education
(SLE).
The libraries perform different func
tions on campus. Hoover Library, accord
ing to both Thomas and Sierkierski, is
used primarily for primary source re
search, while Green and Meyer Libraries
have more multifunctional roles.
Herkovic pointed out that many stu
dents do work at Green Library and
Meyer Library that they could also do in

their dorm rooms or anywhere else.
"[Students] choose to come to the li
brary because it's the conducive place, it's
the fitting setting for doing their research
and study and secondary reading," he
said.
He held that the library provides a cer
tain atmosphere rather than just being a
repository of books.
"People do everything, most of the
human functions with the exception of
eating [in the library] ... there's study
and homework and sleep and love," he
said.
Not surprisingly, the Stanford librari
ans report that the number of students in

the libraries increases tremendously dur
ing the last few weeks of the quarter.
"It ebbs and flows, towards the end of
each term, we tend to see more students;
towards the end of the year, we tend to see
more students," Thomas said.
Although the possible demise of the li
brary has sometimes been closely linked
to the increase in the digital availability of
information, the Stanford librarians dis
agree that libraries may become obsolete.
"I think it's a complementary thing,"
Sierkierski said. "You still need librarians
and archivists and specialists that really
know their way around the information to
guide people to those places, so I think if

anything having our stuff available online
leads people to come here."
Herkovic noted the increasing role of
the library on the web.
"The libraries spend many millions of
dollars a year paying for subscriptions
and online services," Herkovic said. "In
that sense, we become more and more im
portant to how people get and use infor
mation but we may be less visible doing
it."
"The mediation that libraries have al
ways provided is still very much at play in
a different form," he added.
