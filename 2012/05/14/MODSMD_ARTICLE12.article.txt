# OPINIONS
## EDITORIAL The 						precarious relationship between Stanford and Sihicon Valley 
### 
By now, many on campus
have read Ken Auletta's
New Yorker piece titled
"Get Rich U." The article raises
many interesting questions, the
most fundamental asking
whether Stanford is too inter
twined with Silicon Valley.
Among students, the answer to
that question depends on whom
you ask. For many students, Stan
ford's links to Silicon Valley ben
efit humanity through innovation
and entrepreneurship. Others,
though, believe that such close
ties to industry conflict with the
University's mission to promote
an environment where students
and faculty can pursue scholar
ship without regard for profit.
Both sides of the debate have
merit. The Founding Grant, while
establishing for the University's
efforts to be directed at the "culti
vation and enlargement of the
mind," also directs it to "promote
the public welfare by exercising
an influence on behalf of human
ity and civilization." In both re
spects, Silicon Valley deserves
much praise: Innovations and
wealth developed in the Valley
contribute to academia and im
prove humanity in a myriad of
ways. At the same time, regard
less of which educational philoso
phy you prefer, certain aspects of
Silicon Valley are troubling for
the University and its students.
Whereas a university's aim is
the pursuit of knowledge, this
pursuit is only the aim of industry
if the knowledge is profitable. It
should come as no surprise that,
until recently, the record yearly
enrollment for CSIO6A was at
the peak of the dot-com bubble in
1999-2000. Then and now, some
fraction of the increase is due to
students pursuing the field for
primarily monetary purposes. Al
though this indictment is not par
ticular to computer science
other majors have students in it
for the money the proximity
of Stanford to Silicon Valley am
plifies this effect. Not only do
these students diminish enroll
ment in the less profitable aca
demic fields they leave behind,
but they have the potential to cor
rupt the culture of computer pro
gramming. This may help explain
the "Brogramming" phenome
non, where machismo and a focus
on short-term riches overshadow
genuine innovation.
Furthermore, given how
courses in CS show a general bias
toward professional training, the
intellectual beauty of the field
can become overshadowed by
the message to harness the disci
pline for profit. Classes like
"iPhone and iPad Application
Programming" and "Startup"
abound and are some of the more
popular offerings in the major.
Though many regard these sub
jects as harmless, some of the stu
dents taking these classes are fo
cused more on the potential pay
out than an intellectual immer
sion into computer science. Crit
ics find CSIB3 ("Startup"),taught
by Paypal mogul Peter Thiel, par
ticularly troubling; Thiel views
elite universities as highly over
valued, and two years ago he
started a program that paid stu
dents to drop out of college and
start companies.
There are other ways in which
academic pursuit is influenced by
industry. Online education, for in
stance, is widely considered one of
the next frontiers of technology; as
President Hennessy said recently,
it will "change the world" and we
"have to embrace it." While we
agree that online education will be
transformative, we are not as con
vinced of his second claim. One of
our previous editorials argued

that an overemphasis on technol
ogy can diminish the quality of ed
ucation. Universities, then, should
be wary of technology's role for
the future of education, not blind
ly embracing it. At Stanford, how
ever, there is a profound conflict of
interest in this debate. Two start
ups leading the online education
field, Coursera and Udacity, have
co-founders who are currently
Stanford professors. There is spec
ulation, at least with Sebastian
Thrun's (Udacity) class on Ap
plied Machine Learning last fall
quarter, that the course's rigor was
diminished to cater to the online
audience. We fear that other pro
fessors who volunteer their cours
es for online education startups
will feel similarly pressured to
alter their courses, especially if a
faculty member down the hall has
a major stake in the venture.

In short, one is not hard
pressed to find ways in which
Stanford's close link to Silicon
Valley may negatively affect the
academic environment. Turning
next to students who look to
leverage their Stanford educa
tion to improve humanity, we see
that Silicon Valley's ideal of being
a hotbed of productive innova
tion with which to profoundly
better the world is not always
met. As tech-journalist
Hermione Way wrote in 2011,
"Everyone [in the Valley] is doing
something amazing and trying to
change the world, but in reality
much of the technology being
built here is not changing the
world at all, it's short-sighted and
designed for scalability, big exits
and big profits." Although there
are VCs and incubators devoted
to social entrepreneurship, the
current cash flow seems largely
comprised of investments in so
cial media companies. There is
nothing inherently wrong with
social media, but far too often the
next app or website seems to add
little real value and instead seems
focused on drumming up hype to
secure a large exit, Instagram
style. The lure of this pipeline in
evitably draws talent away from
more productive ends, both in the
Valley and outside it.
Of course, one could just as
easily point out that without Sili
con Valley, entrepreneurship
would not be as popular at Stan
ford. Or that without the money
that wealthy donors with ties to
the Valley provide, funding for
less lucrative programs in the hu
manities and arts would decrease.
But while Silicon Valley may
offer unique benefits to the Uni
versity, these come at a high cost.
Since Silicon Valley and our Palo
Alto campus are here to stay,
Stanford should consider the in
fluence that Silicon Valley can
have on both its academic and
utilitarian pursuits and remain
true to its mission to further high
er learning without entirely aban
doning the spirit of innovation
found in Silicon Valley. By better
balancing these concerns, we will
more closely follow the founding
vision of Mr. and Mrs. Stanford.

Thrun's (Udacity) class on Ap
plied Machine Learning last fall
quarter, that the course's rigor was
diminished to cater to the online
audience. We fear that other pro
fessors who volunteer their cours
es for online education startups
will feel similarly pressured to
alter their courses, especially if a
faculty member down the hall has
a major stake in the venture.

In short, one is not hard
pressed to find ways in which
Stanford's close link to Silicon
Valley may negatively affect the
academic environment. Turning
next to students who look to
leverage their Stanford educa
tion to improve humanity, we see
that Silicon Valley's ideal of being
a hotbed of productive innova
tion with which to profoundly
better the world is not always
met. As tech-journalist
Hermione Way wrote in 2011,
"Everyone [in the Valley] is doing
something amazing and trying to
change the world, but in reality
much of the technology being
built here is not changing the
world at all, it's short-sighted and
designed for scalability, big exits
and big profits." Although there
are VCs and incubators devoted
to social entrepreneurship, the
current cash flow seems largely
comprised of investments in so
cial media companies. There is
nothing inherently wrong with
social media, but far too often the
next app or website seems to add
little real value and instead seems
focused on drumming up hype to
secure a large exit, Instagram
style. The lure of this pipeline in
evitably draws talent away from
more productive ends, both in the
Valley and outside it.
Of course, one could just as
easily point out that without Sili
con Valley, entrepreneurship
would not be as popular at Stan
ford. Or that without the money
that wealthy donors with ties to
the Valley provide, funding for
less lucrative programs in the hu
manities and arts would decrease.
But while Silicon Valley may
offer unique benefits to the Uni
versity, these come at a high cost.
Since Silicon Valley and our Palo
Alto campus are here to stay,
Stanford should consider the in
fluence that Silicon Valley can
have on both its academic and
utilitarian pursuits and remain
true to its mission to further high
er learning without entirely aban
doning the spirit of innovation
found in Silicon Valley. By better
balancing these concerns, we will
more closely follow the founding
vision of Mr. and Mrs. Stanford.

Certain aspects
of Silicon Valley
are troubling for
the University.
By now, many on campus
have read Ken Auletta's
New Yorker piece titled
"Get Rich U." The article raises
many interesting questions, the
most fundamental asking
whether Stanford is too inter
twined with Silicon Valley.
Among students, the answer to
that question depends on whom
you ask. For many students, Stan
ford's links to Silicon Valley ben
efit humanity through innovation
and entrepreneurship. Others,
though, believe that such close
ties to industry conflict with the
University's mission to promote
an environment where students
and faculty can pursue scholar
ship without regard for profit.
Both sides of the debate have
merit. The Founding Grant, while
establishing for the University's
efforts to be directed at the "culti
vation and enlargement of the
mind," also directs it to "promote
the public welfare by exercising
an influence on behalf of human
ity and civilization." In both re
spects, Silicon Valley deserves
much praise: Innovations and
wealth developed in the Valley
contribute to academia and im
prove humanity in a myriad of
ways. At the same time, regard
less of which educational philoso
phy you prefer, certain aspects of
Silicon Valley are troubling for
the University and its students.
Whereas a university's aim is
the pursuit of knowledge, this
pursuit is only the aim of industry
if the knowledge is profitable. It
should come as no surprise that,
until recently, the record yearly
enrollment for CSIO6A was at
the peak of the dot-com bubble in
1999-2000. Then and now, some
fraction of the increase is due to
students pursuing the field for
primarily monetary purposes. Al
though this indictment is not par
ticular to computer science
other majors have students in it
for the money the proximity
of Stanford to Silicon Valley am
plifies this effect. Not only do
these students diminish enroll
ment in the less profitable aca
demic fields they leave behind,
but they have the potential to cor
rupt the culture of computer pro
gramming. This may help explain
the "Brogramming" phenome
non, where machismo and a focus
on short-term riches overshadow
genuine innovation.
Furthermore, given how
courses in CS show a general bias
toward professional training, the
intellectual beauty of the field
can become overshadowed by
the message to harness the disci
pline for profit. Classes like
"iPhone and iPad Application
Programming" and "Startup"
abound and are some of the more
popular offerings in the major.
Though many regard these sub
jects as harmless, some of the stu
dents taking these classes are fo
cused more on the potential pay
out than an intellectual immer
sion into computer science. Crit
ics find CSIB3 ("Startup"),taught
by Paypal mogul Peter Thiel, par
ticularly troubling; Thiel views
elite universities as highly over
valued, and two years ago he
started a program that paid stu
dents to drop out of college and
start companies.
There are other ways in which
academic pursuit is influenced by
industry. Online education, for in
stance, is widely considered one of
the next frontiers of technology; as
President Hennessy said recently,
it will "change the world" and we
"have to embrace it." While we
agree that online education will be
transformative, we are not as con
vinced of his second claim. One of
our previous editorials argued

that an overemphasis on technol
ogy can diminish the quality of ed
ucation. Universities, then, should
be wary of technology's role for
the future of education, not blind
ly embracing it. At Stanford, how
ever, there is a profound conflict of
interest in this debate. Two start
ups leading the online education
field, Coursera and Udacity, have
co-founders who are currently
Stanford professors. There is spec
ulation, at least with Sebastian
Thrun's (Udacity) class on Ap
plied Machine Learning last fall
quarter, that the course's rigor was
diminished to cater to the online
audience. We fear that other pro
fessors who volunteer their cours
