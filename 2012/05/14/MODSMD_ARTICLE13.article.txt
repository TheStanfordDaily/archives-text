# THE
						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## Micro, macro 
### Nina Chung 
My planner is packed, and it's
one of my biggest crutches.
I would argue that every
thing inside is technically important
because I can't miss that meeting
and I can't forget that event. But
when I stop and breathe, I slowly re
alize something, and only now in
my last quarter at Stanford. I've
been squeezing productivity like
pulp from every hour and dropping
much larger concerns. For four
frenzied years, I've been research
ing corruption in Italian govern
ment, the nuclear situation in
Northeast Asia and religious neo
colonialism in Africa. But only re
cently did I realize that it's the mid
dle of May, and I haven't yet re
sponded to my grandfather's email
the brief, but really loving one he
sent me, in January. This is not my
idea of good time management; I'm
afraid of the girl letting this happen.
This may be college, but we have
peers saying, "I don't know who I'm
becoming anymore." This is the
pilot for the mid-life crisis threaten
ing us 20 years from now. Melodra
matic, but I'm serious. Already, in
this supposedly non-"real world"
world, lists and lists of things to do
threaten to blur our bigger picture,
at which point we ask, "Wait, what
the hell am I doing this for?" It's an
issue of accidental worship, in
which we idolize things we never
meant to, and lose track of what we
most meant to pursue. Micro versus
macro; we don't need to graduate to
see the tension.
Relationships can epitomize this.
We're on a campus that parties, so
flippant hook-ups play their reruns
every weekend. Most of these
episodes aren't award-winning life
changers. But as we get caught in a
mindless routine, sometimes they

take the face of it. Living in our short
term time frames, sometimes we
can't help but go with the flow. Last
week, this week, next week... after a
while, late-night calls melt into theo
retical commitments the kind
that "just happen" because no one
accepts it, but no one rejects it.
Most of us will admit, though,
that we're looking for someone
who goes all-in for us on purpose.
Most of us want to be with someone
who consciously decides the same.
But that's a broader ideal, one that
we keep pushing to the side for
more instant gratification. We have
a definite knack for keeping busy
with cheap charms, while holding
off on matters of the heart. It's ro
mantic procrastination, but it stings
because it's also self-compromising.
We forget what we actually wanted.
We get distracted.
Interestingly, the same goes for
our relationship with our money.
The seed for this column was actu
ally planted when some friends and
I started discussing what our fi
nances would look like post-gradu
ation. Someone mentioned omi
nously that the way we use our
money five years from now has
probably already been set by our
habits right now. I was slightly
frightened. In the future, I want to
channel most of my money to peo
ple other than me, and I don't want
to be reckless with spare change.
That's how I live now, though, at a
school that already provides most
of my needs. I'm selfish with my
money.
Another person close to me
tried to reassure me by saying I
couldn't possibly be so idealistic
this far out anyway, since I wasn't
earning income or facing real obsta
cles yet, which is true. Currently, I

don't feel any real financial heat.
But from here, a safe distance from
my future self, I wouldn't trust my
self to keep exception from becom
ing precedent. As I grow up, I'll go
on trips; I'll have a wedding; I'll
have kids; I'll retire. And I could
shelve my biggest priorities every
time.
It sounds like I'm projecting, but
I'm not so sure. I wasn't prepared
for college graduation in a month,
either. Perhaps stronger than the
force of time is the beguiling nature
of habit that makes us forget time
passes at all. "IT'S WEEK
WHAT?!" we say. At a school with
a cornucopia of resources, opportu
nities and amazing events, our ulti
mate temptation is to drown in a life
of breathless details.
Personally, the most obvious
manifestation of tabled priorities is
the curiosity about the existence of
a god. So many people are curious,
letting themselves consider that
there's more than just this. So, if it's
possible to push an issue of that
scale aside, all manner of other val
ues can be forgotten ideal love,
good finances, the person we aspire
to be, everything. Tomorrow never
comes, which makes postponing
our greatest intentions a dangerous
game to play.
I want to live in the moment, to
be sure. I just didn't foresee getting
lost in it.

These days, Nina is trying to tone
down her incessant email-checking.
But if you email her, she won't leave
you hanging. So go for it! At ninamc
