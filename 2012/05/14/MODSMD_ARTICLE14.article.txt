The Alternative Review
Process (ARP) is a judicial
review system used by Stan
ford in cases of sexual misconduct.
Over the past few weeks, there has
been a great deal of debate about
which standard of proof should be
used in the ARP. While it is easy to
identify two sides in this debate
and to pit them against each other,
such a strategy oversimplifies the
issue. The interests of the victim
are not, as one might assume, dia
metrically opposed to those of the
accused. This is not a zero-sum
game between the accused and the
abused; instead, the interests of
these two groups complement
each other.
According to numerous stud
ies, there are three reasons why
most sexual assaults go unreport
ed. The first is that many victims
blame themselves for what hap
pened and feel too ashamed to talk
to authorities. The second reason is
that victims want to avoid reliving
the incident. Before we discuss the
third reason, it is important to un
derstand a few things about the
ARP. Two years ago, when it came
into effect, the ARP implemented
a variety of reforms which make it
easier for victims to approach au
thorities. These changes were ef
fective: initial figures suggest the
reforms led to a substantial in
crease in reporting of abuse to au
thorities. The changes made by the
ARP, however, do not tell us any
thing about how the standard of
proof impacts one's willingness to
come forward, since Stanford only
recently changed the standard of
proof used by the ARP. For its first
year, the ARP operated using be
yond a reasonable doubt Stanford
switched to preponderance of the

evidence (PoE) during the ARP's
second year. Current data does not
suggest that the switch to PoE
made it easier for victims of abuse
to come forward. To the contrary,
we have reason to believe the
switch will actually decrease the
rate at which victims will report
abuse. To understand why, we can
look to the third reason why vic
tims do not report abuse.
The third reason victims do not
report sexual assault is out of fear
they will lose the respect of their
peers that they will be perceived
as troublemakers and blamed for
harming the reputation of their
abuser. The standard of proof in sex
ual assault cases does impact this
reason in that it affects the extent to
which women experience stigma.
One might be tempted to think a
lower standard of proof would de
crease stigma by increasing the rate
at which the accused are found
guilty, legitimizing the claims of the
victim. We contend that a lower
standard of proof will actually make
things worse for victims. The stigma
experienced by victims of abuse
does not depend simply on the ver
dict in a judicial affairs hearing, but
is also impacted by the legitimacy
and credibility of the process.
A standard of proof is only as
strong as its minimum require
ment. The conviction of a man who
is unquestionably guilty is no more
legitimate than the conviction of
someone who barely passes the
PoE threshold. This means that
even in clear cases, a woman who
reports abuse will face doubt and
scrutiny from her peers and will
suffer the emotional distress that
follows. Hence, even when she
wins, she loses. The abuser will be
gone, but the stigma will remain.

Worse still, the incredulity now has
legitimacy, since rational people
can, and indeed should, by defini
tion, harbour a reasonable doubt
about the validity of the outcome.
But there's more to it. PoE cer
tainly makes it more likely that an
accused man will be found respon
sible for sexual assault, but it does
not guarantee such an outcome. We
have shown that a lower standard
makes a conviction less believable,
A corollary is that a lower standard
makes a finding of innocence much
more believable. If a person is
found innocent at the lowest stan
dard of proof, then he would cer
tainly have been found innocent
under a higher standard. Since we
know that people shun negative
outcomes more than they desire
positive ones, the impact is that the
number of women who will come
forward as a result of the lower
standard will be outweighed by the
much larger number of women
who will now be deterred from
coming forward for fear of the ac
cused being proclaimed innocent.
Since the standard is much lower, a
woman who loses a sexual assault
case is now much more likely to be
seen as a troublemaker.
Choosing a standard of proof is
about balancing the rights of the
victim and the rights of the ac
cused. Thus far, student debates
have placed the rights of these
groups in opposition to each other.
It is our hope that students and ad
ministrators will recognize that the
rights of these two groups are in
terdependent, and that the pre
ponderance of the evidence stan
dard is harmful to everyone

even in clear cases, a woman who
reports abuse will face doubt and
scrutiny from her peers and will
suffer the emotional distress that
follows. Hence, even when she
wins, she loses. The abuser will be
gone, but the stigma will remain.

Worse still, the incredulity now has
legitimacy, since rational people
can, and indeed should, by defini
tion, harbour a reasonable doubt
about the validity of the outcome.
But there's more to it. PoE cer
tainly makes it more likely that an
accused man will be found respon
sible for sexual assault, but it does
not guarantee such an outcome. We
have shown that a lower standard
makes a conviction less believable,
A corollary is that a lower standard
makes a finding of innocence much
more believable. If a person is
found innocent at the lowest stan
dard of proof, then he would cer
tainly have been found innocent
under a higher standard. Since we
know that people shun negative
outcomes more than they desire
positive ones, the impact is that the
number of women who will come
forward as a result of the lower
standard will be outweighed by the
much larger number of women
who will now be deterred from
coming forward for fear of the ac
cused being proclaimed innocent.
Since the standard is much lower, a
woman who loses a sexual assault
case is now much more likely to be
seen as a troublemaker.
Choosing a standard of proof is
about balancing the rights of the
victim and the rights of the ac
cused. Thus far, student debates
have placed the rights of these
groups in opposition to each other.
It is our hope that students and ad
ministrators will recognize that the
rights of these two groups are in
terdependent, and that the pre

The Alternative Review
Process (ARP) is a judicial
review system used by Stan
ford in cases of sexual misconduct.
Over the past few weeks, there has
been a great deal of debate about
which standard of proof should be
used in the ARP. While it is easy to
identify two sides in this debate
and to pit them against each other,
such a strategy oversimplifies the
issue. The interests of the victim
are not, as one might assume, dia
metrically opposed to those of the
accused. This is not a zero-sum
game between the accused and the
abused; instead, the interests of
these two groups complement
each other.
According to numerous stud
ies, there are three reasons why
most sexual assaults go unreport
ed. The first is that many victims
blame themselves for what hap
pened and feel too ashamed to talk
to authorities. The second reason is
that victims want to avoid reliving
the incident. Before we discuss the
third reason, it is important to un
derstand a few things about the
ARP. Two years ago, when it came
into effect, the ARP implemented
a variety of reforms which make it
easier for victims to approach au
thorities. These changes were ef
fective: initial figures suggest the
reforms led to a substantial in
crease in reporting of abuse to au
thorities. The changes made by the
ARP, however, do not tell us any
thing about how the standard of
proof impacts one's willingness to
come forward, since Stanford only
recently changed the standard of
proof used by the ARP. For its first
year, the ARP operated using be
yond a reasonable doubt Stanford
switched to preponderance of the

evidence (PoE) during the ARP's
second year. Current data does not
suggest that the switch to PoE
made it easier for victims of abuse
to come forward. To the contrary,
we have reason to believe the
switch will actually decrease the
rate at which victims will report
abuse. To understand why, we can
look to the third reason why vic
tims do not report abuse.
The third reason victims do not
report sexual assault is out of fear
they will lose the respect of their
peers that they will be perceived
as troublemakers and blamed for
harming the reputation of their
abuser. The standard of proof in sex
ual assault cases does impact this
reason in that it affects the extent to
which women experience stigma.
One might be tempted to think a
lower standard of proof would de
crease stigma by increasing the rate
at which the accused are found
guilty, legitimizing the claims of the
victim. We contend that a lower
standard of proof will actually make
things worse for victims. The stigma
experienced by victims of abuse
does not depend simply on the ver
dict in a judicial affairs hearing, but
is also impacted by the legitimacy
and credibility of the process.
A standard of proof is only as
strong as its minimum require
ment. The conviction of a man who
is unquestionably guilty is no more
legitimate than the conviction of
someone who barely passes the
PoE threshold. This means that
even in clear cases, a woman who
reports abuse will face doubt and
scrutiny from her peers and will
suffer the emotional distress that
follows. Hence, even when she
wins, she loses. The abuser will be
gone, but the stigma will remain.
