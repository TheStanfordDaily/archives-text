# Like Mom always said...

### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
In honor of Mother's Day, it
seemed fitting to talk about
my own mom this week.
Growing up, my mom had so
many roles. On the weekends,
she was a soccer mom. She drove
players in her minivan, made the
team banner, cheered from the side
lines, brought us snacks at halftime
and even used her own limited soc
cer expertise to help as assistant
coach. She was the ideal supporter of
my soccer career (as well as my
equally rewarding baseball and bas
ketball careers) despite the fact that
I showed about as much athletic tal
ent as a gum wrapper.
And I loved it. Sports have been
my life for as long as I can remember,
and I found away to enjoy sports that
I sucked at. I loved playing even
though I've always despised exercise,
and I would have a good time even
though I was almost always on an
awful team (it took until my third
year of playing soccer for my team to
win a game). Sports were just what I
would do besides school.
The only thing that caused me
complaints was my aforementioned
hatred of exercise (seriously, it's the
worst), but I never really thought
much of it until my mom began to
question some of my coaches for
their methods. She would tell me
about how youth sports used to be
more about just kids having fun with
less emphasis on being ultra-compet
itive. I know this might sound lame,
but we're talking about eight year
olds in a recreational soccer league.
You get a trophy no matter what.
From then on, I started really
noticing how intense people get
about kids' sports, and it's not a pretty
sight. Parents get thrown out of
games for screaming at officials, play
ers who have yet to reach middle
school get verbally abused by coach
es at the slightest error, and for what?
For a first-place ribbon instead of a
second-place ribbon?
Of course, the goal of many par
ents is to give their child the best shot
at becoming the next Le√üron James,
Lionel Messi, Andrew Luck or Al
bert Pujols (minus 2012). You can't
wait until you're 18 to become Novak
Djokovic or Tiger Woods, so kids
have to start young to have a shot at
being an elite athlete.
The problem, though, is that you
know these athletes' names because
there are so few who get to that level.
What about the 99.9 percent of kids
out there playing youth sports? Are
"winningiseverythjng"and"yourbest
is not good enough" really the mes
sages we want to be sending our kids?
Naturally, competitiveness factors
into sports, and it's good to be com
petitive up to a certain point. But
kids will be competitive on their own
without those messages being
drilled into their heads by adults.
What kids can't do on their own is
put their latest Little League game in
perspective. If your coach tells you
that losing will ruin your life, then it's
going to ruin your life, at least for a
while. And if you think this problem
ends when kids reach middle school
or high school, just take a look at the
problems in college and professional
sports.
Some of the big issues in sports
right now can be traced directly to the
attitudes ingrained in kids through
youth sports. Football is dealing with
problems from blows to the head and
unnecessarily violent play. Baseball
has had to deal with the whole steroid
debacle. Basketball is seeing most of
the top players skipping their educa
tion, or at least blowing it off] in order
to make money now.Think about it: If
you're told to win at all costs as a six
year-old and every week of practice
from then on, why wouldn't you do
whatever possible to get ahead?
Then again, it's definitely a two
way street. If you're growing up idol
izing athletes that hit players in the
head and take illegal substances and
skip college for the money, it's hard
not to want to follow in their foot
steps.
There will always be hypercom
petitive kids with dreams of being a
professional athlete who view youth
sports as the first step on their path to
stardom. But for the rest of us, youth
sports are about having fun the way
only kids can. And I just hope by the
time I have kids, there's still some fun
left to be had in sports.
