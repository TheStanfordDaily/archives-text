## COUGARS CRUSHED 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 12 Stanford baseball
team entered the weekend with
major questions on the mound,
slumbering bats and an unimpres
sive 11-10 record in a conference
that it was once a near-unanimous
favorite to win.
It leaves the weekend with three
dominant pitching performances, a
revitalized lineup and a sweep of
Washington State behind it.
The Cardinal (32-14,14-10 Pac
-12) tried some new things against
the Cougars (24-23,9-14), and they
paid off tremendously in the third
to-last weekend of conference play.
Star hitter Stephen Piscotty took
the mound for his first career pitch
ing start on Saturday, and Stanford
got some of its biggest contributions
at the plate from a pair of under
classmen sophomore Danny
Diekroeger and freshman Dominic
Jose who saw nearly no playing
time at the start of the season.
"We've had some guys who had
n't got a chance to play early really
come in and [make] a difference for
us and help us win some games,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"That's really going to serve us well
as we go down the road, [getting]
contributions from a lot of guys."
Though none of the teams
above the Cardinal in the Pac-12
standings made a maj or misstep this
weekend, the squad has climbed to
fourth in the conference and is with
in striking distance of third-place
UCLA (15-9) and second-place
Arizona (16-8). Conference-leader
No.lo Oregon (18-8) won the first
two games of its series against USC
and will remain three and a half
games ahead of Stanford if it finish
es off the Trojans tonight.
But a Cardinal team that lost
two very winnable games at Ore
gon State last weekend will take the
sweep nonetheless.
Nearly 4,000 fans showed up for
Fireworks Night on Friday, but both
teams' offensive sparks took a
while to materialize, Washington
State righty Tanner Chleborad held
Stanford scoreless into the fifth and
junior ace Mark Appel allowed

only six Cougar hits.
Five of those hits were of the
extra-base variety, however, and
senior rightfielder Derek Jones set
himself up to score the first run of
the game when he doubled off
Appel to lead off the fourth. Appel
struck out the next batter but the
ball got through to the backstop,
putting Jones in position to score on
a groundout by senior second base
man Tommy Richards.
"There were a lot of two-strike
hits, which usually I try to bear
down [on],"Appel said."They were
sitting on off-speed pitches with two
strikes, and we figured that out after
the fourth inning or so and started
pitching backward... It seemed to
be effective."
Appel was dominant with two
strikes the rest of the way, punching
out 10 for the fifth time this season.
Stanford erased the one-run lead in
the fifth inning, getting two straight
hits to lead off the frame before
Danny Diekroeger made it 2-1 with
a bases-loaded single.
Washington State got a runner
to third in the sixth after another
leadoff double and a passed-ball
strikeout, but Appel escaped the in

ning with his seventh punchout of
the night.Two straight doubles from
first baseman Brian Ragira and
rightfielder Austin Wilson in the
bottom half of the frame extended
the Cardinal's lead to 3-1.
That insurance run would come
in handy in the eighth, when the
Pac-12's leading home-run hitter in
Cougar junior Taylor Ard sent a
solo shot sailing over the left field
fences. Though Washington State
mounted an eight-run comeback to
take in its series opener against
Stanford a year ago, the Cardinal
held on to its lead this time around
to win 3-2.
"Getting that Friday win is huge
for the weekend," Appel said. "It
kind of sets the tone, and it's very
tough to come back, down 1-0, and
win the series."
Stanford was still unsatisfied
with its dipping production at the
plate, though, as the Cardinal had
put up five runs or fewer for the
third straight game. The squad has
only lost once when scoring more
than five runs.
"We hit some balls hard today
[but] didn't quite put up the runs we
want," Danny Diekroeger said Fri

day night. "We've just got to keep
bringing it and hopefully the bats
will pick up."
And pick up they did on Satur
day, when the Cardinal's 15 hits
were more than enough to take the
series in an 8-3 victory. But the story
of the afternoon was Stanford's
pitching, not its slugging.
Piscotty (3-2), making his first
career start after several successful
relief appearances this season, daz
zled on the mound by giving up just
one earned run in 6.1 innings. In the
meantime, he compiled a three-hit,
two-walk day at the plate
through five innings,he had allowed
just three baserunners and reached
base three times himself.
"We hadn't tried Piscotty [as a
starter], and obviously he was fan
tastic," Marquess said. "He didn't
throw many pitches, and he kind of
does it all for us."
The Cardinal broke the game
open with two outs in the third.
Danny Diekroeger doubled and
Piscotty walked before a Ragira
single opened the scoring, and a
three-run shot from Wilson his
ninth home run of the season
made it 4-0.
Piscotty singled to lead off the
fifth and was pushed across on a
triple by freshman third baseman
Alex Blandino, but the Cougars
quickly got that run back on a sixth
inning double by Jones.
Junior shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger responded by leading
off the bottom half of the sixth with
a full-count double. Jose singled
him home and later came around to
score on a sac fly by Danny
Diekroeger, increasing the lead to
six runs.
Two unearned runs by Washing
ton State in the seventh made it 7-3
and forced Piscotty from the game,
but redshirt sophomore lefthander
Garrett Hughes easily finished off
the last 2.2 innings, striking out
three and improving his team-lead
ing ERA to 2.21. A sac fly by junior
centerfielder Jake Stewart was icing
on the cake for the Cardinal, which
clinched its fifth Pac-12 series win of
the season with the victory.

Sophomore Danny Diekroeger had at least one RBI in all three games
this weekend, solidifying his position in the lineup at designated hitter
and second base and propelling Stanford to its second Pac-12 sweep.
