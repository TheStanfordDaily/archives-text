# TWO TRIUMPHS AT TAUBE
## EASY SWEEPS FOR CARD 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford women's
tennis team took the first step
towards a third straight NCAA
tournament finals matchup by
defeating Stony Brook and Yale
at home in the first two rounds
of the tournament. Stanford
now travels to Athens, Ga.,
where it will likely face multiple
Pac-12 teams, including the only
team to have beaten the Cardi
nal all year, top-seeded UCLA.
Fourth-seeded Stanford (20-
1, 9-1 Pac-12) shut out both
Stony Brook and Yale 4-0 over
the weekend, setting up a third
round match with Northwest
ern on Thursday in Athens.
The last time Athens hosted
the NCAA tournament in 2010,
Stanford defeated Florida in the
finals. Then-sophomore Mallo
ry Burdette, a Georgia native,
won the deciding match in front
of most of her family and along
side her sister Lindsay Burdette,
who was playing her last match
as part of the Cardinal.
"I obviously love going back
there," said Burdette, who will
be hosting team dinners at her

family's home in Athens. "All
my family will be down there,
and it's a fun place to have the
NCAA tournament."
Stanford also won the
NCAA tournament when it was
hosted in Athens in 2004 and
2005 and was the runner-up
there in 2007.
Playing in her hometown
may also help Burdette forget
about her heartbreaking loss in
last year's finals on the Farm.
Burdette was again the last
player on the court, but this time
she lost in three sets to Florida's
Lauren Embree as the Gators
clinched the title.
Three current Cardinal play
ers competed in the NCAA fi
nals in 2010 and 2011: senior
Veronica Li, junior Stacey Tan,
and Burdette. That experience
will be important for the Cardi
nal, especially because it will be
facing some familiar foes. The
squad's match with Northwest
ern is a rematch of last year's
third round contest, which Stan
ford won 4-2. Stanford lost the
doubles point and was down 2-1
at one point before winning

Senior Mallory Burdette will return to her home state of Georgia as
the Cardinal begins the Sweet Sixteen this week. Last time the Card
traveled to Athens, Ga., it won the 2010 national championship.
three straight singles matches.
"Last year it was a battle," Bur
dette said. "But we know what to
expect of them this year, and I
think we are ready for sure,"
It is very likely that Stanford
will then play two conference op
ponents if it advances. The top four
teams on the Cardinal's side of the
bracket are all from the Pac-12.
Stanford could potentially play
USC in the quarterfinals, a team
the Cardinal defeated 4-2 in the
regular season.
If that should occur, Stanford
would then be in a position to
avenge its only loss of the season,
which came April 14 at home
against UCLA. The Bruins have
three freshmen that play singles,
meaning half of their players have
no postseason experience.
UCLA's relative youth could
help explain its regular season
meltdown, which saw the Bruins
lose to USC in a match that would
have secured a share of the Pac-12
title.
"They have not responded well
under pressure, especially at the
end of the year," Burdette said.
Still, Stanford will be the under
dog if it could make it to the semi
finals, a position the team has come
to relish.
"We've proven throughout the

year that we play best when we're
in that position," said Burdette.
The Cardinal dominated this
weekend as the heavy favorites.
On Friday, the squad defeated
Stony Brook, recipients of the
American East's automatic bid.
Stony Brook had only five healthy
players, forcing it to forfeit a point
and giving Stanford a chance to
give some extra rest for Tan, who is
recovering from several lingering
injuries.
On Saturday, the Cardinal de
feated Yale behind strong per
formances from its top three play
ers, sophomore Nicole Gibbs, Bur
dette and Tan. Gibbs was the first
to finish, winning 6-0,6-1, followed
by Burdette who won 6-1,6-3. Tan
finished off the Bulldogs with a 6-4,
6-1 victory over freshman Hannah
Yu.
"Yale was a step up in competi
tion for us from Friday, and I think
we handled it really well," Bur
dette said.
Next weekend will no doubt be
another step up in quality, but one
Burdette is confident the team can
deal with.
"We've put in a lot of hard work
over the course of the year, and
we're really excited to get to
Athens and show what we're made
of."
Stanford meets Northwestern
on Thursday in Athens, Ga. at 9
a.m. PDT.
