# TWO TRIUMPHS AT TAUBE
## EASY SWEEPS FOR CARD 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford women's
tennis team took the first step
towards a third straight NCAA
tournament finals matchup by
defeating Stony Brook and Yale
at home in the first two rounds
of the tournament. Stanford
now travels to Athens, Ga.,
where it will likely face multiple
Pac-12 teams, including the only
team to have beaten the Cardi
nal all year, top-seeded UCLA.
Fourth-seeded Stanford (20-
1, 9-1 Pac-12) shut out both
Stony Brook and Yale 4-0 over
the weekend, setting up a third
round match with Northwest
ern on Thursday in Athens.
The last time Athens hosted
the NCAA tournament in 2010,
Stanford defeated Florida in the
finals. Then-sophomore Mallo
ry Burdette, a Georgia native,
won the deciding match in front
of most of her family and along
side her sister Lindsay Burdette,
who was playing her last match
as part of the Cardinal.
"I obviously love going back
there," said Burdette, who will
be hosting team dinners at her

family's home in Athens. "All
my family will be down there,
and it's a fun place to have the
NCAA tournament."
Stanford also won the
NCAA tournament when it was
hosted in Athens in 2004 and
2005 and was the runner-up
there in 2007.
Playing in her hometown
may also help Burdette forget
about her heartbreaking loss in
last year's finals on the Farm.
Burdette was again the last
player on the court, but this time
she lost in three sets to Florida's
Lauren Embree as the Gators
clinched the title.
Three current Cardinal play
ers competed in the NCAA fi
nals in 2010 and 2011: senior
Veronica Li, junior Stacey Tan,
and Burdette. That experience
will be important for the Cardi
nal, especially because it will be
facing some familiar foes. The
squad's match with Northwest
ern is a rematch of last year's
third round contest, which Stan
ford won 4-2. Stanford lost the
doubles point and was down 2-1
at one point before winning

Senior Mallory Burdette will return to her home state of Georgia as
the Cardinal begins the Sweet Sixteen this week. Last time the Card
traveled to Athens, Ga., it won the 2010 national championship.
