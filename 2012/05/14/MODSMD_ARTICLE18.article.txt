# CARDINAL TO SWEET SIXTEEN
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford men's ten
nis team booked its ticket to Geor
gia for the Sweet Sixteen of the
season-ending NCAA tourna
ment this past weekend with two
wins on its home court at the Taube
Family Tennis Center. The Cardi
nal defeated Sacramento State 4-0
on Saturday afternoon in the first
round and beat Santa Clara 4-1 in
Sunday's second round.
Because they were held on
campus, the first two rounds of the
NCAA tournament evoked
painful memories of last year's
Sweet Sixteen loss to No. 1 Virginia
at Taube, but these two solid victo
ries surely helped to push those old
memories out of mind. They were
both complete wins, showing off
the depth and quality of the ever
changing Stanford lineup.
The Cardinal dominated Satur
day's win from beginning to end in
the kind of easy victory that has
been a foreign quantity to the team
as of late. The doubles tandems of
Dennis Lin and Ryan Thacher and
Bradley Klahn and John Morris
sey each crushed their Flornets op
ponents 8-1, securing the crucial
first point of the match.
Singles play featured a lot of the
same one-sidedness.The three sin
gles matches that ended up count
ing had a cumulative final score of
36 games for Stanford to just four
for Sacramento State. A good deal
of momentum was built in Satur
day's dominant first-round win
heading into Sunday's matchup
against the upstart Santa Clara
Broncos.
Santa Clara, seeded No. 39 and
appearing in its first NCAA tour
nament, upset higher seeded Texas
on Saturday and charged into its
second-round match against Stan
ford with a large following of bois
terous crowd support. In Sunday's
match, the Stanford crowd was
given the challenge of matching
the flock of Broncos supporters.
"The crowd was huge today,"
said sophomore Daniel Flo. "Since
Santa Clara brought a decent
crowd themselves it was very im
portant for us to match them in
cheering ... At one point in dou
bles, we actually missed a shot but
the crowd was so loud that the ref
was intimidated and overruled the

Santa Clara call."
Every single point in the three
doubles matches proved pivotal, as
the matches were incredibly close.
The team of Lin andThacher fell 8-
6 in the first doubles match, which
was soon canceled out by Klahn
and Morrissey's 9-7 win on court
two, putting the pressure of the
first point on the shoulders of
sophomore Jamin Ball and fresh
man Robert Stinemann. The two
underclassmen came up clutch in a
tight, back-and-forth match, ulti
mately winning 9-8 in a tiebreaker
to give Stanford momentum and a
1-0 advantage heading into singles
play.
"[The doubles win] was defi
nitely crucial," Ho said. "Santa
Clara came out with a lot of ener
gy. Winning the first point shut
them down and gave us energy to
go out in the singles and get off to a
good start."
Singles play did indeed get off
to a good start for Stanford, behind
straight-set wins on courts one and
five from Klahn and Ho that put
the Cardinal on the brink of victo
ry. After a loss by Thacher on court
two, freshman John Morrissey

closed out the match with a three
set victory on court four to send
Stanford to Georgia to compete
for its 18th NCAA championship.
Ho, for one, thinks that the Car
dinal is ready for all the competi
tion that awaits in the final four
rounds of the NCAA tournament.
"I think tennis-wise we are
pretty well prepared. We just have
to try to stay focused on the goal,"
he said.

invariably is an NCAA champi

ford with a large following of bois
terous crowd support. In Sunday's
match, the Stanford crowd was
given the challenge of matching
the flock of Broncos supporters.
"The crowd was huge today,"
said sophomore Daniel Flo. "Since
Santa Clara brought a decent
crowd themselves it was very im
portant for us to match them in
cheering ... At one point in dou
bles, we actually missed a shot but
the crowd was so loud that the ref
was intimidated and overruled the

Santa Clara call."
Every single point in the three
doubles matches proved pivotal, as
the matches were incredibly close.
The team of Lin andThacher fell 8-
6 in the first doubles match, which
was soon canceled out by Klahn
and Morrissey's 9-7 win on court
two, putting the pressure of the
first point on the shoulders of
sophomore Jamin Ball and fresh
man Robert Stinemann. The two
underclassmen came up clutch in a
tight, back-and-forth match, ulti
mately winning 9-8 in a tiebreaker
to give Stanford momentum and a
1-0 advantage heading into singles
play.
"[The doubles win] was defi
nitely crucial," Ho said. "Santa
Clara came out with a lot of ener
gy. Winning the first point shut
them down and gave us energy to
go out in the singles and get off to a
good start."
Singles play did indeed get off
to a good start for Stanford, behind
straight-set wins on courts one and
five from Klahn and Ho that put
the Cardinal on the brink of victo
ry. After a loss by Thacher on court
two, freshman John Morrissey

Freshman John Morrissey may be
making his first NCAA tournament
run, but he was pivotal against
Santa Clara on Sunday, earning a
three-set singles victory to clinch a
Stanford win in the second round.
closed out the match with a three
set victory on court four to send
Stanford to Georgia to compete
for its 18th NCAA championship.
Ho, for one, thinks that the Car
dinal is ready for all the competi
tion that awaits in the final four
rounds of the NCAA tournament.
"I think tennis-wise we are
pretty well prepared. We just have
to try to stay focused on the goal,"
he said.
For Stanford tennis, that goal
invariably is an NCAA champi
onship. The Cardinal is now in po
sition to compete for that goal,
starting at 1 p.m. PDT on Friday
against No. 6 Kentucky.
