## XOX plans march for autonomy 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Chi Theta Chi (XOX) residents
and members of the Stanford com
munity will march on the office of
the Vice Provost of Student Affairs
this morning in protest of the Uni
versity's decision to terminate the
house's lease and in support of the
house's continued independence.
"The [University] has repeated
ly ignored and evaded the residents
of Chi Theta Chi during the process
of their takeover," said a Facebook
event page dedicated to the march.
"The residents of Chi Theta Chi
and all those in solidarity will
march ... to make their voices
heard."
According to the event page,
which listed 85 attendees at the
time of publication, protestors will
march on the office of Student Af
fairs and make a direct case for the
house's continued independence,
"With a forceful and passionate
turnout... we can show the Uni
versity that this cause will not go
away," wrote George Malkin 'l3, a
former XOX resident, in a post on
The Unofficial Stanford Blog.
Administrators first moved to
terminate Chi Theta Chi's lease on
Feb. 8, citing "pressing life safety is
sues," with the intent of assuming
control of the house on April 2. The
University later postponed the
takeover until Aug. 31, when the
annually renewed lease will expire.
XOX Alumni Board represen
tatives and University officials are
currently close to an agreement
that will provide for joint oversight
of the house for a "minimum of two
years."
XOX residents protested the
University's Feb. 8 announcement
vociferously, disputing various ra
tionales put forward by administra
tors as grounds for the lease's ter
mination and criticizing the lack of
notice provided in advance of the
announcement. In subsequent
weeks, a petition supporting the
house's independence gathered
more than 2,000 signatures, and the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
unanimously approved a resolu
tion advocating the lease's renew
al.
"We believe the University is
beginning to understand why inde
pendence is critical to the house's
unique character, thanks to the out
pouring of support from alumni
and the community at large," wrote
Abel Allison 'OB, president of the
Alumni Board, in a March 12
email to The Daily.
In recent weeks, residents have
been much more muted in their
protests. According to Gerald
Hanono 'l2, XOX house manager,
the shift was prompted by requests
from administrators and the
Alumni Board to create a less
strained atmosphere for ongoing
negotiations.
However, as details of the pro
posed resolution emerge, resi
dents and supporters have re
turned to a more vocal posture in
an effort to more directly convey
their displeasure with the settle
ment. Protest organizers singled
out an alleged lack of clarity on
how the house can regain its lease,
as well as the loss of XOX's singu
lar autonomy under joint over
sight, as particular sticking points.
"Residential and Dining En
terprises and the Vice Provost's
Office have continuously dis
played a fundamental lack of un
derstanding of [XOX's] culture,"
Malkin wrote. "XOX's culture is
rooted in its independence."
Event organizers have also
sought to portray the debate as
one with implications beyond Chi
Theta Chi, arguing that the deci
sion to let the lease expire is simply
a manifestation of sustained Uni
versity efforts to "homogenize"
residential life.
"We ask you to stand with us
(literally) to show... that Stan
ford is one community, that the in
justices faced by one house affect
us all," the event page read.
Following an all-campus break
fast at Chi Theta Chi at 9 a.m. on
Monday,marchers will depart for the
office of Student Affairs at 9.30 a.m.
