# STUDENT LIFE
## XOX plans march for autonomy 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Chi Theta Chi (XOX) residents
and members of the Stanford com
munity will march on the office of
the Vice Provost of Student Affairs
this morning in protest of the Uni
versity's decision to terminate the
house's lease and in support of the
house's continued independence.
"The [University] has repeated
ly ignored and evaded the residents
of Chi Theta Chi during the process
of their takeover," said a Facebook
event page dedicated to the march.
"The residents of Chi Theta Chi
and all those in solidarity will
march ... to make their voices
heard."
According to the event page,
which listed 85 attendees at the
time of publication, protestors will
march on the office of Student Af
fairs and make a direct case for the
house's continued independence,
"With a forceful and passionate
turnout... we can show the Uni
versity that this cause will not go
away," wrote George Malkin 'l3, a
former XOX resident, in a post on
The Unofficial Stanford Blog.
Administrators first moved to
terminate Chi Theta Chi's lease on
Feb. 8, citing "pressing life safety is
sues," with the intent of assuming
control of the house on April 2. The
University later postponed the
takeover until Aug. 31, when the
annually renewed lease will expire.
XOX Alumni Board represen
tatives and University officials are
currently close to an agreement
that will provide for joint oversight
of the house for a "minimum of two
years."
XOX residents protested the
University's Feb. 8 announcement
vociferously, disputing various ra
tionales put forward by administra
tors as grounds for the lease's ter
mination and criticizing the lack of
notice provided in advance of the
announcement. In subsequent
weeks, a petition supporting the
house's independence gathered
more than 2,000 signatures, and the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
unanimously approved a resolu
tion advocating the lease's renew
al.
"We believe the University is
beginning to understand why inde
pendence is critical to the house's
unique character, thanks to the out
pouring of support from alumni
and the community at large," wrote
