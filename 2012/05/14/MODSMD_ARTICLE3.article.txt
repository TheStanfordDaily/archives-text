# University braces for large incoming class 						No students to be accepted from wait list following yield jump
## 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
Due to a three percent increase from last
year's yield rate, the Class of 2016 will have
about 50 more students than anticipated by the
Office of Admission.
Administrators across undergraduate de
partments are taking steps to accommodate this
larger entering class, including keeping Gavilan
as an all-frosh dorm,hiring more Pre-Major Ad
visors (PMAs) and potentially hiring more Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) profes
sors and Thinking Matters teaching fellows.
Freshman class size has steadily increased

over the past three years from 1,675 to 1,709 to
1,766 entering students, which is the current ap
proximation for the Class of 2016, according to
Dean of Admission Richard Shaw.
"Right now, the count is 1,786 [students], but
some will withdraw over summer," Shaw wrote
in an email to The Daily.
The class of 2014 and 2015 will also gain 27
transfer students next year, according to Shaw.
Stanford's yield rate has been consistently
increasing from 64 percent in 2002 to this year's
73 percent rate.
Because so many students accepted their

offer of admission, Shaw said that
all students who were placed on
the waitlist were released and ad
mission for the Class of 2016 is of
ficially closed.
Although Stanford Student
Housing was planning to convert
Gavilan in Florence Moore Hall
(FloMo) into a four-class dorm for
the 2012-13 academic year, the res
idence will have to remain all
frosh in order to accommodate the
large freshman class.
Fran'Cee Brown-McClure, stu
dent affairs officer for ResEd,
wrote in an email toThe Daily that
dorms in FloMo often change
their class composition from year
to year.
"FloMo is the type of dorm that
can accommodate a wide distribu
tion of students depending on the
needs of that year," Brown-Mc-
Clure wrote.
Brown-McClure added that al
though the number of incoming
freshmen will be higher next year,
there is adequate residential staff
in place to meet their needs.
In addition to the strain on stu
dent housing, the office of Under
graduate Advising and Research
(UAR) will also see effects of the
larger incoming class.
Freshmen are normally as
signed to Pre-Major Advisors
(PMAs) in groups of four to six
other students. UAR has hired ad
ditional PMAs for next year in
order to maintain the intimate size
of PMA groups.
In an email to The Daily, Dean
of Freshmen and Undergraduate
Advising Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9
wrote that UAR is ready for the
incoming class.
"Luckily, our recruitment ef
forts this year already yielded the
largest number of PMAs ever, so
we're in good shape on that front,"

Lythcott-Haims wrote.
Vice Provost of Undergradu
ate Education Harry Elam wrote
in an email to The Daily that UAR
is developing a new online advis
ing tool in addition to the PMA
program. The new tool, called
"Productive Pathways," would
help freshmen select courses and
make sure they feel supported
during their freshman year.
UAR has also been planning to
hire two new Academic Directors
(ADs), independent of the Class
of 2016 increased yield, as part of
an effort to bring the overall AD
to-student ratio down, Lythcott-
Haims wrote,
Elam added that more PWR
instructors are needed, and that
the new required freshman pro
gram, Thinking Matters, may have
to hire more post-doctoral fellows
to lead discussion sections in order
to maintain small class sizes.
Despite these necessary adjust
ments, administrators said they
were thrilled with the larger-than
usual size of the incoming class.
"On top of the obvious things
the academic excellence and in
finite possibility I imagine the
genuine affection we all feel for
the place comes through and mat
ters to admits," Lythcott-Haims
wrote about why the yield rate was
so high this year.
"It is good news that Stanford
has had such a strong response,"
Shaw wrote. "The University has
the capacity to manage this over
age."
Lythcott-Haims added that
there is only one potential prob
lem with the freshman class size
increasing.
"In UAR, we love freshmen, so
there is no such thing as too many
of them, except to the extent we
can't fit them all in MemAud," she
said, referring to New Student
Orientation events held in Memo
rial Auditorium.
