## VPSA establishes mental health advisory board 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
After implementing 18 recom
mendations from a 2008 report on
campus mental health resources, the
University oversight committee on
the subject will now give way to a
newly-created advisory board.
Counseling and Psychological Serv
ices (CAPS) director Ron Albucher
and Associate Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Sally Dickson will co
chair the advisory board, which is
expected to convene formally for
the first time this fall.
In 2006, Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 convened a
mental health task force, which was
charged with studying the campus
climate and culture surrounding
mental health. The task force pub
lished a report in November 2008,
which included 18 recommenda
tions that were to be implemented
by an oversight committee.
Now that the recommendations
have been implemented, Albucher
said the committee is no longer a
useful body.
"[The advisory board] will kind
of take over from the oversight com
mittee and continue to keep mental
health, well-being, resiliency, even is
sues around substance use, all on the
front burner, if you will, so that we
keep refining what we're doing and
offering to meet student needs," Al
bucher said. "We'll have student
representation on that advisory
board; we'll have faculty and staff as
well."
According to Albucher, the new

board will use the next few months
before fall quarter to solidify its
membership, making sure a broad
spectrum of groups on campus are
represented. The board will also
work to clarify and cement its pur
pose, and its scope of inquiry.
The mental health advisory
board is one of several such groups
that report to Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Greg Boardman, in
cluding advisory boards on sexual
violence and alcohol use on campus.
One undergraduate and one
graduate student will sit on the
board, according to ASSU Presi
dent Robbie Zimbroff 'l2, who said
Boardman has asked him to recom
mend students for the posts.
"I want kids who are going to be
not just by resume good can
didates but also candidates who can
consider lots of sides of any issue,"
Zimbroff said. "We're all for mental
health and wellness, but that doesn't
mean anything when it's such a neb
ulous term. You have to be able to
see how things cut both ways."
Zimbroff cited as an example
that when Resident Assistants
(RAs) are trained to help students
who are stressed or slipping through
the cracks in getting support, there is
a cost for the RAs as well that must
be considered.
"What are the implications of the
RA, who's also a student, doing
this?" he asked. Zimbroff himself is
currently serving his second year as
an RA in Ujamaa.
According to Zimbroff, he and
ASSU Vice President William
Wagstaff 'l2 are talking to student
groups that deal with mental
health and wellness on campus as
part of their search for candidates.
"It's the toughest thing to deal
with on campus when a peer dies,"
Zimbroff said, referring to the re
cent deaths of student-athlete Sam
Wopat on March 25 and junior
English major Cady Hine on April
1. "I didn't know Sam or Cady, and
it's weighed on me ... There needs
to be dialogue about how you deal
with loss in a community and how
you respond to issues of mental
health on a university campus."
Zimbroff emphasized that
these conversations should take
place throughout the campus com
munity and not just in Senate or
advisory board meetings.
"Two execs and 15 senators are
never going to represent the un
dergraduate body completely," he
said. "We're individuals, and when
it comes to an issue like this, I think
this is one where more participa
tion rather than more representa
tion is probably a good thing, hav

ing people talk about this in their
dorms to their friends."
He added that the dialogue sur
rounding mental health needs to
be a continuing presence on cam
pus beyond individual conversa
tions or initiatives.
"I don't think you have a duck
syndrome conversation, and then
you check it off and you move on,"
he said, referencing the well
known phenomenon in which stu
dent stress or anxiety is masked by
a deceivingly serene appearance.
Zimbroff said he would like to
see the mental health advisory
board address issues such as duck
syndrome and other academic
mental health issues, directly in
light of the Study of Undergradu
ate Education at Stanford report.
Zimbroff cited one example of
academic-related stress as the
regimented curricula of 100-plus
unit engineering majors, as com
pared to his 63-unit history major,
in which students don't have the
flexibility to "figure out [their]
passions."
"Having a really honest discus
sion in that area is something that
works in conjunction with SUES,"
he added.

bucher said. "We'll have student
representation on that advisory
board; we'll have faculty and staff as
well."
According to Albucher, the new

board will use the next few months
before fall quarter to solidify its
membership, making sure a broad
spectrum of groups on campus are
represented. The board will also
work to clarify and cement its pur
pose, and its scope of inquiry.
The mental health advisory
board is one of several such groups
that report to Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Greg Boardman, in
cluding advisory boards on sexual
violence and alcohol use on campus.
One undergraduate and one
graduate student will sit on the
board, according to ASSU Presi
dent Robbie Zimbroff 'l2, who said
Boardman has asked him to recom
mend students for the posts.
"I want kids who are going to be
not just by resume good can
didates but also candidates who can
consider lots of sides of any issue,"
Zimbroff said. "We're all for mental
health and wellness, but that doesn't
mean anything when it's such a neb
ulous term. You have to be able to
see how things cut both ways."
Zimbroff cited as an example
that when Resident Assistants
(RAs) are trained to help students
who are stressed or slipping through
the cracks in getting support, there is
a cost for the RAs as well that must
be considered.
"What are the implications of the
RA, who's also a student, doing
this?" he asked. Zimbroff himself is
currently serving his second year as
an RA in Ujamaa.
According to Zimbroff, he and
ASSU Vice President William
Wagstaff 'l2 are talking to student
groups that deal with mental
health and wellness on campus as
part of their search for candidates.
"It's the toughest thing to deal
with on campus when a peer dies,"
Zimbroff said, referring to the re
cent deaths of student-athlete Sam
Wopat on March 25 and junior
English major Cady Hine on April
1. "I didn't know Sam or Cady, and
it's weighed on me ... There needs
to be dialogue about how you deal
with loss in a community and how
you respond to issues of mental
health on a university campus."
Zimbroff emphasized that
these conversations should take
place throughout the campus com
munity and not just in Senate or
advisory board meetings.
"Two execs and 15 senators are
never going to represent the un
dergraduate body completely," he
said. "We're individuals, and when
it comes to an issue like this, I think
this is one where more participa
tion rather than more representa
tion is probably a good thing, hav

ing people talk about this in their
dorms to their friends."
He added that the dialogue sur
rounding mental health needs to
be a continuing presence on cam
pus beyond individual conversa
tions or initiatives.
"I don't think you have a duck
syndrome conversation, and then
you check it off and you move on,"
he said, referencing the well
known phenomenon in which stu
dent stress or anxiety is masked by
a deceivingly serene appearance.
Zimbroff said he would like to
see the mental health advisory
board address issues such as duck
syndrome and other academic
mental health issues, directly in
light of the Study of Undergradu
ate Education at Stanford report.
Zimbroff cited one example of
academic-related stress as the
regimented curricula of 100-plus
unit engineering majors, as com
pared to his 63-unit history major,
in which students don't have the
flexibility to "figure out [their]
passions."
"Having a really honest discus
sion in that area is something that
works in conjunction with SUES,"
he added.

After implementing 18 recom
mendations from a 2008 report on
campus mental health resources, the
University oversight committee on
the subject will now give way to a
newly-created advisory board.
Counseling and Psychological Serv
ices (CAPS) director Ron Albucher
and Associate Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Sally Dickson will co
chair the advisory board, which is
expected to convene formally for
the first time this fall.
In 2006, Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 convened a
mental health task force, which was
charged with studying the campus
climate and culture surrounding
mental health. The task force pub
lished a report in November 2008,
which included 18 recommenda
tions that were to be implemented
by an oversight committee.
Now that the recommendations
have been implemented, Albucher
said the committee is no longer a
useful body.
"[The advisory board] will kind
of take over from the oversight com
mittee and continue to keep mental
health, well-being, resiliency, even is
sues around substance use, all on the
front burner, if you will, so that we
keep refining what we're doing and
offering to meet student needs," Al
bucher said. "We'll have student
representation on that advisory
board; we'll have faculty and staff as
well."
According to Albucher, the new
