## WATER POLO GOES BACK-TO-BACK CARD WINS SECOND STRAIGHT 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The last time that the Stanford and USC
women's water polo teams met at Aztec
Aquaplex in San Diego, the Trojans swam
away with a 10-9 victory over the top-seeded
Cardinal in the 2010 national championship
game.
But when the two squads met yesterday
with another title on the line, No. 1 Stanford
wasn't going to let another title slip away.
The defending-champion Cardinal (26-2)
got a late goal from senior driver Pallavi
Menon and 15 saves from junior goalie Kate
Baldoni to edge the Trojans 6-4 and capture
Stanford's third national championship in
women's water polo and 103 rd overall. Bal
doni's 29 saves to just nine goals allowed over
the tournament won her MVP honors, while
Menon capped her Stanford career with
seven goals over the weekend.
"We definitely have some bad memories
from being here two years ago, but this group,
this team has an incredible spirit about them
and this amazing attitude," said head coach
John Tanner. "They were relentless today."
Neither squad led by more than a goal be
fore Menon's bad-angle shot found the back

of the cage with just 1:11 left in the game.
Menon and sophomore driver Kaley Dod
son each had two goals, with Trojan goalie
Flora Bolonyai stifling Menon on a late
breakaway in the first half
"We were really frustrated with some of
our missed opportunities," Tanner said. "We
thought Owe could've gotten ourselves a two,
three, four-goal cushion, and we just strug
gled to stay up by one. But Kate was ab
solutely phenomenal, and finally Pallavi with
that last goal to give us some breathing room
at a critical time."
Despite the adversity it faced in the finals,
the Cardinal's road to Sunday's showdown
was a relatively smooth one. Stanford
opened its weekend with a 17-5 win over No.
8 Pomona-Pitzer on Friday and a 12-3 victo
ry over fourth-seeded UC-Irvine in the semi
finals on Saturday.
Against the Anteaters, freshman Ashley
Grossman had a hat trick while Menon and
freshman Cory Dodson each tacked on two
goals of their own, and the Cardinal held the
Anteaters scoreless over a 12:56 stretch of
the first half after they had taken an early 1-
0 lead.
