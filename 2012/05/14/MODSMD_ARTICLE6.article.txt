# NATIONAL CHAMPIONS
## WATER POLO GOES BACK-TO-BACK CARD WINS SECOND STRAIGHT 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The last time that the Stanford and USC
women's water polo teams met at Aztec
Aquaplex in San Diego, the Trojans swam
away with a 10-9 victory over the top-seeded
Cardinal in the 2010 national championship
game.
But when the two squads met yesterday
with another title on the line, No. 1 Stanford
wasn't going to let another title slip away.
The defending-champion Cardinal (26-2)
got a late goal from senior driver Pallavi
Menon and 15 saves from junior goalie Kate
Baldoni to edge the Trojans 6-4 and capture
Stanford's third national championship in
women's water polo and 103 rd overall. Bal
doni's 29 saves to just nine goals allowed over
the tournament won her MVP honors, while
Menon capped her Stanford career with
seven goals over the weekend.
"We definitely have some bad memories
from being here two years ago, but this group,
this team has an incredible spirit about them
and this amazing attitude," said head coach
John Tanner. "They were relentless today."
Neither squad led by more than a goal be
fore Menon's bad-angle shot found the back

of the cage with just 1:11 left in the game.
Menon and sophomore driver Kaley Dod
son each had two goals, with Trojan goalie
Flora Bolonyai stifling Menon on a late
breakaway in the first half
"We were really frustrated with some of
our missed opportunities," Tanner said. "We
thought Owe could've gotten ourselves a two,
three, four-goal cushion, and we just strug
gled to stay up by one. But Kate was ab
solutely phenomenal, and finally Pallavi with
that last goal to give us some breathing room
at a critical time."
Despite the adversity it faced in the finals,
the Cardinal's road to Sunday's showdown
was a relatively smooth one. Stanford
opened its weekend with a 17-5 win over No.
8 Pomona-Pitzer on Friday and a 12-3 victo
ry over fourth-seeded UC-Irvine in the semi
finals on Saturday.
Against the Anteaters, freshman Ashley
Grossman had a hat trick while Menon and
freshman Cory Dodson each tacked on two
goals of their own, and the Cardinal held the
Anteaters scoreless over a 12:56 stretch of
the first half after they had taken an early 1-
0 lead.

Junior goalkeeper Kate Baldoni was named the tournament MVP after she stopped 15 USC
shots in Sunday's national title game in San Diego. Baldoni and the Cardinal have now captured
two consecutive NCAA crowns.
Trailing for the first time in the
tournament, the Cardinal grabbed
a 7-2 halftime advantage with a 6-0
run over that same time period, and
the squad was perfect on its three
penalty shots and went 6-for-10 on
the power-play to advance to the
final.
USC scored 5:12 minutes into
the game to take its only lead, but
Menon struck back with a power
play goal just 33 seconds later.
Freshman Kiley Neushul, the
MPSF Newcomer of the Year,
added her third tally of the week
end to grab a 2-1 advantage for
Stanford.
Each team tallied in the final
minute of the first period, but the
back-and-forth affair gave way to a
scoreless second frame that saw
both goalies make key saves and
several Trojan shots bounce safely
off the goal post.
The Trojans drew even a minute
into the second half, but Kaley Dod
son responded with a goal of her
own just 10 seconds later to grab a 4-
3 lead for Stanford. A minute into
the final period USC tied the game
again, and yet again it was Kaley
Dodson who came up in the clutch
with a power-play goal at the 4:13
mark that would end up being the
game-winner.
Then it was up to Menon to seal
the deal in the final minute and a
half.
"I had taken that lob earlier
from five [meters], and I was
pleased with it, so I just fired it in
and really just threw it as hard as I
could," she said. "I saw a little open
ing, and I was so happy. I looked
back and the first person I saw was
Kate, out to her waist, so excited. It
was great to see that energy from

everybody."
The Cardinal's senior class of
Menon, driver Alyssa Lo, driver
Cassie Churnside and defender
Monica Coughlan was instrumen
tal in setting the tone for the repeat
champions all season long.
"There's so much vitality," Tan
ner said. "Usually the seniors are
looking at grad school or their ca
reer, and the freshmen add the en
ergy. Our freshmen did have a
whole lot of energy, believe me, but
our seniors are every bit exuberant,
and that really is uncommon in my
experience."
And while the seniors' contribu
tions were certainly remarkable,
Stanford will likely be the odds-on
favorite to win a third straight na
tional championship next season.
Along with a strong class of in
coming freshmen, the Cardinal
will get back junior Annika Dries
and senior Melissa Seidemann,
who both redshirted this season in
order to train with the U.S. Nation
al Team before this summer's
Olympics.
After the game, Menon was
asked how strong the Cardinal will
be next year despite the absence of
her fellow seniors.
"Oh my gosh, unstoppable,"
she said. "They're only getting bet
ter. I'm so excited to watch this team
flourish, there's so much talent."
Until the 2013 campaign,
though, Stanford can be content
with the team's third national title.
"What I'll remember is just the
excitement that these guys created
every workout, every chance to be
around each other," Tanner said.
"We're looking forward to the fact
that we're not flying home until to
morrow. We get to spend another
evening together."
And what's even better they
get to spend it with a brand new tro
phy.
