## Study finds learning outlook affected by environment 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
Students' outlook toward learning is strongly
influenced by their environment, according to a
recent study co-authored by Stanford psycholo
gist Paul O'Keefe.
The study, published online in the journal Mo
tivation and Emotion, divides motivation for
learning into two distinct categories: mastery and
performance. Students who learn for mastery are
interested in developing new skills for their own
sake, while those who learn for performance are
focused on displaying their abilities to others.
Psychologists tend to favor mastery-oriented
learning since it emphasizes being motivated in
trinsically and seeking out new challenges. Most
schools, however, focus on performance-orient
ed learning, since students must demonstrate
knowledge to others on tests and exams.
O'Keefe along with his fellow researchers
Adar Ben-Eliyahu of the University of Pitts
burgh and Lisa Linnenbrink-Garcia of Duke
University sought to explore the effects of
being exposed to environments that favor mas
tery-based learning.
"We know a mastery environment is great,"
O'Keefe recently told the Stanford News Serv
ice. "We know mastery goals are great. Study

after study shows this, so what we wanted to ex
amine was how a purely mastery-oriented envi
ronment affected goal orientations and whether
these changes would endure when people re
turned to less ideal learning environments."
The researchers surveyed a group of eighth
to tenth-grade students three times over a nine
month period. These students were asked if they
agreed with statements that aligned either with
mastery- or performance-oriented learning, such
as "It's important to me that I learn a lot of new
concepts in science" or "One of my goals is to
show others that I'm good at science."
In the first survey, taken while participants
were still in school, students scored high in per
formance-oriented learning. By the time of the
second survey, however, students were placed in
a mastery-oriented environment a summer
enrichment program and their responses
changed accordingly.
The largest surprise, according to the re
searchers, occurred six months later when the
students took a third survey. Students had re
turned to school, but they continued to score
high for mastery-oriented learning.
The study's authors concluded that these re
sults suggest that mastery-oriented environ
ments have a lasting impact. According to O'-
Keefe, the study indicates that teachers and em
ployers should take steps to foster a mastery-ori
ented environment.
