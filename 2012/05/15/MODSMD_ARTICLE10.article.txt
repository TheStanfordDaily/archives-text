# THE 						PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST LADY
## LOVE ON THE FARM 
### â€“ Stephanie Wang 
The love story that blossomed between
Herbert Hoover, class of 1895, who
would become the 31st President of the
United States, and Lou Henry, class of
1898, his future wife, while they were un
dergraduates at Stanford is a classic example of sen
ior boy meets freshman girl except the two did
not meet at Full Moon on the Quad or at a Screw
Your Roommate event.
In fact, "screw your student" might be a more ac
curate description of their first date, as Herbert and
Lou were set up on a date by their geology profes
sor.
Herbert was a senior majoring in geology when
he first met Lou in the office of John Branner, head
of the Geology Department.
"There was a sly twinkle in his eye as he [Dr.
Branner] said: 'Miss Henry, this is my assistant, Her
bert Hoover. Hoover, this is Lou Henry, our first
woman in the Geology Department," reported the
November/December 1904 issue of The Stanford
Review magazine.
At first, Herbert was not particularly interested
in Lou, but it wasn't long before Branner's wife
arranged for them to have lunch at her house. By
the end of the luncheon, Lou had captured Her
bert's heart.
"His college habits began to change," the maga
zine reported. "He even joined the callers waiting in
the conspicuous Roble reception hall for their girls
to answer the bells in the upstairs corridors."
Although both Lou and Herbert majored in ge
ology, Lou had a strong interest in natural history,
Latin and English, while Herbert loved science and
mathematics. In fact, the July 22,1928 issue of The
New York Times Magazine reported that Herbert
did not pass his English exam until an hour before
graduation.
After they both graduated, Herbert and Lou
married in 1899 before leaving for China, where
Herbert would serve as the head engineer for Be
wick, Mooring & Co, a London mine management
firm.The couple traveled the world until 1917, when
Herbert was appointed to lead the U.S. Food Ad
ministration during World War I.
Before the end of the war, the Hoovers commis
sioned Louis Christian Mullgardt, the architect of
the Knoll, to design a home for them near the Stan
ford campus. However, Mullgardt publicized the
job before the war was over, which led to the termi
nation of his contract because the Hoovers were
worried that the publicity would suggest that Her
bert was not focusing his energies on the war effort
but rather on the construction of his new home.
After the war ended, the Hoovers returned to
Palo Alto and convinced Arthur B. Clark, a Stan
ford art professor, to take on the role of architect.
While Clark was the primary designer of the house,
Lou also contributed her own ideas to the blue
prints and actively oversaw its construction.
In a letter written to her friend Anna H. Rult in
the years following World War I, Lou suggested that
the Hoovers intended for their house to be built in
a style that mirrored that of the rest of the Mission
Revival architecture of the campus.
"My husband and I had said we wanted this
house to be a collection of rooms where we wanted
them for living purposes, enclosed by plain wall sur
faces," Lou wrote. "Of course in visioning the result
before it was built, we felt that it was in decided har
mony with the architecture of the University on
whose campus it sits."
Although the house, which finished in 1920, was
the couple's only permanent residence throughout
their marriage, they only resided there for a short
while before Herbert was appointed Secretary of
Commerce under President-Elect Warren G. Hard
ing in 1921. Their family eventually moved back in
1932, after Hoover's term as president ended.
In 1944, after the death of his wife, Herbert deed
ed the house to the University as a home for profes
sors. It now serves as the private residence of the
University president.
Although more than half a century has passed
since the Hoovers left the Stanford campus, the
legacy of their presence can still be seen from miles
away literally in the form of Hoover Tower,
which was sponsored and founded by Herbert in
1919 to house his collection of war documents. The
collection, renamed the Hoover War Library in
1922, eventually became the largest library in the
world dealing in World War I memorabilia. The
tower itself was completed in 1941, reaching a
height of 285 feet, and grew to include documents
from the interwar period, World War II and the
Cold War.
As evidenced by their architectural and institu
tional vestiges on campus, the Hoovers' legacy
and love story remain landmarks on the Farm.
