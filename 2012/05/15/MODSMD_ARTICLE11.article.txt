## FROM FARM TO FORK Who should feed the hungry? 
### Jenny Rempel 
Course syllabi do not often in
clude the assignment to give
away $lOO,OOO, but when I
walked into Bruce Sievers' Theories
of Civil Society, Philanthropy, and
the Nonprofit Sector seven weeks
ago, there it was. My classmates and
I were thrilled, enthusiastic and a lit
tle nervous. We accepted the chal
lenge.
We have since spent the quarter
reviewing hundreds of nonprofits in
the Bay Area. Our class has broken
into four teams focusing on separate
issue areas (not surprisingly, I ended
up on the "Health and Environ
ment" team), each one crafting
pseudo-mission statements, re
searching potential recipients and
soliciting grant proposals. My team
is beginning our first round of site
visits and interviews today.
It has been an eye-opening
process. Simply scrolling through all
25 Bay Area organizations listed
under "Food" on GreatNonprof
its.org gives one confidence in the
power of civil society. When com
bined with the 68 nonprofits under
"Environment" and the 67 organi
zations under "Health," it's clear
that there are a lot of individuals in
the Bay Area working for positive
change.
The class has not focused solely
on grants, however. Under the excit
ing announcement of our $lOO,OOO
assignment, the syllabus detailed a
list of readings that would ground us
in the theories and practices of civil
society. Coming from Earth Sys
tems and walking into PoliSci 236,1
was a little confused about what ex
actly "civil society" meant.The term
has many rough synonyms, includ
ing "the independent sector," "non
governmental organizations" and
"the nonprofit world," all of which
served as labelers that I don't find
very fitting. The terms "charitable
realm" and "voluntary service or
ganizations" impute a bit more
meaning and value, but are still a bit
confusing.
The term "civil society" is inher
ently amorphous, but to me and
probably Professor Sievers, to
whom this definition should really
be credited civil society embod
ies the realm of nonprofits, founda
tions and philanthropy, as well as the
set of institutions and normative
values that enable these entities' ex
istences, namely protection of indi
vidual rights, freedom of expression,
the rule of law, commitment to the
common good and tolerance.
The term is still up for debate,
particularly as the lines between the
government sector, the for-profit
sector and the "third sector" (civil
society) blur in America. The pur
poses and goals of civil society shim
mer in a mirage-like state, whereby
many different actors can see differ
ent goals for a sector that operates at
the confluence of private and public
interests. One goal that is common-

ly mentioned, though not necessari
ly agreed upon, is the concept that
civil society organizations exist for
the provision of public goods that
would otherwise be unsupplied by
the other two sectors.
Judging from the sheer number
of organizations working to ensure
that individuals in the Bay Area are
being fed, I'd say civil society has
adopted food as an otherwise un
derprovided public good. Given
that most of the 25 organizations
under "Food" are food banks, this
doesn't seem too far-fetched. In fact,
there are many neat civil society or
ganizations operating in the food
sphere, although their size and fund
ing often limit their power to
achieve change and guarantee food
access.
The very existence of this array
of food and hunger-based nonprof
its reveals a sad fact: The U.S. gov
ernment does not view access to
food as a fundamental right. If it did,
nonprofits wouldn't be stumbling
over each other to enter into the
food sphere and ensure this basic
public good.
Further evidence that the gov
ernment does not view food access
as a fundamental right came from
the House Budget Committee last
week.The GOP proposed reversing
planned cuts to the Pentagon de
fense budget in favor of pushing 1.8
million people off of food stamps
and removing school lunch subsi
dies for 280,000 children.
Since the U.S. government does
not view guaranteed food access as
a task that falls under its purview,
and since food is privatized in a for
profit sector that is complicated by
government commodity payments,
civil society organizations are left
with the daunting task of ensuring
that all Americans are fed. That's a
monumental undertaking.
It is especially difficult because
there is no oversight ensuring that
nonprofits are pursuing this task
equally and in all locations, and
there are no guarantees that existing
civil society organizations will oper
ate indefinitely into the future.
If we view access to food as a fun
damental right, we cannot continue
to use civil society as a crutch for its
provision. The government must
play a larger role.
Until then, I will work hard to
convince my classmates that food
organizations are worthy of our
funding money.

Have suggestions for that $100,000?
