# HALF- INVENTED
## Let this be the end. Let all be forgiven. 
### Chase Ishii 
Last Wednesday, on the same
day President Obama gave
his personal endorsement of
same-sex marriage, an equally
shocking tremor ran rampant
through the punk music scene.
Rolling Stone released a teaser
story in which Tom Gabel, lead
singer, guitarist and writer of the
15-year-strong Florida punk band
Against Me! announced he was
transgender. He has dealt with
gender dysphoria and intends to
begin living as a woman Laura
Jane Grace by taking hor
mones and undergoing electroly
sis treatment and full sexual-reas
signment surgery.
Imagine how this announce
ment was received in the punk
community, known for angry out
bursts and middle-finger respons
es a community Gabel helped
create. Many people have been
very supportive, but the responses
have run the spectrum. Many are
confused, some betrayed, others
malicious. Masked by the
anonymity of the Internet, people
have cast their judgment upon
Gabel with every profanity and
vulgarity possible.
I'll be honest: I was very con
fused when I read the preview ar
ticle. I haven't had any close con
versations or relationships with
someone who is transgender (at
least that I know of). I didn't know
about the controversy surround
ing gender identity disorder, de
bating how normative gender
identities and roles actually are
and whether cross-gender feel
ings and behaviors should be con
sidered a disorder. But most im
portantly, I didn't understand the
severity of the issue on a very per

sonal level.
"The cliche is that you're a
woman trapped in a man's body,
but it's not that simple," Gabel
says of gender dysphoria in the ar
ticle. "It's a feeling of detachment
from your body and from your
self. And it's shitty, man. It's really
[freakin] shitty."
What may be more telling of
the struggle is the final song "Full
Clarity" on the band's album
"Searching for a Former Clarity,"
in which Gabel sings, "Confess
ing childhood secrets of dressing
up in women's clothes/ compul
sions you never knew the reasons
to/ Will everyone you ever meet
or love/ be just a relationship
based on a false presumption?"
That album was released in 2005.
It is now 2012. That's seven whole
years to live in torment and an
guish while the secrets that keep
others from truly knowing you
tear you up inside. Gabel reveals
in the interview that the fear and
misery of the situation caused
him to develop an addiction to al
cohol and hard drugs at the age
of 13. That sounds like hell.
I think, given how political the
conversation has become in the
last couple years, it's easy for
those disconnected from the
LGBT community to drown in
the stats and figures and forget
how truly personal and individual
the difficulties are. And given that
everyone I've met who has identi
fied with LGBT has, to some de
gree, begun addressing the inter
nal tension and pain of secrecy, it's
easy to forget how severe that pain
can be.
I have a friend I've known for
years and spent a great deal of time

with who recently revealed some se
crets relevant to this topic. And after
hearing everything they went
through over the last few years to
get to a point where they could
admit it to themselves and to others
the denial and disbelief, the fear
and frustration my only wish is
that 1 could have been there with
them through it all.That they would
n't have had to go through it alone.
I know that, for many, this issue
is a moral issue, and I don't expect
anything 1 write here to be able to
change your moral views, as 1 un
derstand they are grounded in a
very personal part of your life. I'm
not asking that you change these
views but that you hold them in
perspective. Because the opinions
you casually throw out without a
second thought can have lasting ef
fects on another person in a very
deep way. Those words can be the
keys that lock a person into self
isolation and the belief that he or
she can never be his or herself be
cause it is wrong.
You may believe a person's
lifestyle is wrong according to your
God, and there's nothing I can do
to change that. But what else do
your choice of words and actions
say about your god? That he wants
to lock people in their silent de
spair? That his hatred justifies their
outcast and mistreatment from so
ciety? I am a Christian, and that is
not my God. My God desires free
dom and restoration for all, inde
pendent of "right" and "wrong."
My God is love.

cohol and hard drugs at the age
of 13. That sounds like hell.
I think, given how political the
conversation has become in the
last couple years, it's easy for
those disconnected from the
LGBT community to drown in
the stats and figures and forget
how truly personal and individual
the difficulties are. And given that
everyone I've met who has identi
fied with LGBT has, to some de
gree, begun addressing the inter
nal tension and pain of secrecy, it's
easy to forget how severe that pain
can be.
I have a friend I've known for
years and spent a great deal of time

with who recently revealed some se
crets relevant to this topic. And after
hearing everything they went
through over the last few years to
get to a point where they could
admit it to themselves and to others
the denial and disbelief, the fear
and frustration my only wish is
that 1 could have been there with
them through it all.That they would
n't have had to go through it alone.
I know that, for many, this issue
is a moral issue, and I don't expect
anything 1 write here to be able to
change your moral views, as 1 un
derstand they are grounded in a
very personal part of your life. I'm
not asking that you change these
views but that you hold them in
perspective. Because the opinions
you casually throw out without a
second thought can have lasting ef
fects on another person in a very
deep way. Those words can be the
keys that lock a person into self
isolation and the belief that he or
she can never be his or herself be
cause it is wrong.
You may believe a person's
lifestyle is wrong according to your
God, and there's nothing I can do
to change that. But what else do
your choice of words and actions
say about your god? That he wants
to lock people in their silent de
spair? That his hatred justifies their
outcast and mistreatment from so
ciety? I am a Christian, and that is
not my God. My God desires free
dom and restoration for all, inde
pendent of "right" and "wrong."
My God is love.

Last Wednesday, on the same
day President Obama gave
his personal endorsement of
same-sex marriage, an equally
shocking tremor ran rampant
through the punk music scene.
Rolling Stone released a teaser
story in which Tom Gabel, lead
singer, guitarist and writer of the
15-year-strong Florida punk band
Against Me! announced he was
transgender. He has dealt with
gender dysphoria and intends to
begin living as a woman Laura
Jane Grace by taking hor
mones and undergoing electroly
sis treatment and full sexual-reas
signment surgery.
Imagine how this announce
ment was received in the punk
community, known for angry out
bursts and middle-finger respons
es a community Gabel helped
create. Many people have been
very supportive, but the responses
have run the spectrum. Many are
confused, some betrayed, others
malicious. Masked by the
anonymity of the Internet, people
have cast their judgment upon
Gabel with every profanity and
vulgarity possible.
I'll be honest: I was very con
fused when I read the preview ar
ticle. I haven't had any close con
versations or relationships with
someone who is transgender (at
least that I know of). I didn't know
about the controversy surround
ing gender identity disorder, de
bating how normative gender
identities and roles actually are
and whether cross-gender feel
ings and behaviors should be con
sidered a disorder. But most im
portantly, I didn't understand the
severity of the issue on a very per

sonal level.
"The cliche is that you're a
woman trapped in a man's body,
but it's not that simple," Gabel
says of gender dysphoria in the ar
ticle. "It's a feeling of detachment
from your body and from your
self. And it's shitty, man. It's really
[freakin] shitty."
What may be more telling of
the struggle is the final song "Full
Clarity" on the band's album
"Searching for a Former Clarity,"
in which Gabel sings, "Confess
ing childhood secrets of dressing
up in women's clothes/ compul
sions you never knew the reasons
to/ Will everyone you ever meet
or love/ be just a relationship
based on a false presumption?"
That album was released in 2005.
It is now 2012. That's seven whole
years to live in torment and an
guish while the secrets that keep
others from truly knowing you
tear you up inside. Gabel reveals
in the interview that the fear and
misery of the situation caused
him to develop an addiction to al
cohol and hard drugs at the age
of 13. That sounds like hell.
