## Can't we all just get along? 
### Tom Taylor 
Reading Internet com
ments feels a little like
watching a tabloid talk
show. At first it seems
that there might be a
valid point to the proceedings, that
as adults we can maybe come to
gether and have a reasonable dis
cussion. But soon it descends into a
battle of bigoted crazy talk. With
the unaccountability of anonymity,
and egged on by the general tone of
other comments, people don't hold
anything back. Initially this can be a
little amusing, until your mind
starts to ache from the pure stupidi
ty of it all.
Last week, after reading an inter
esting online column about the re
cent boom in television exposure of
soccer in the United States, I kept
reading and plowed headlong into
the comments section below. Pretty
soon a war had evolved; soccer fans
making outlandishly ill-informed
declarations about football, and
very much vice-versa, too. A small
band of peacemakers had bravely
tried to bridge the ideological
chasm, but their balanced and rea
sonable observations were lost
under a flood of abuse.
When I first set foot in Cardinal
territory, I didn't just have zero in
terest in American sports I was
stubbornly opposed to it. Even after
turning my hand to writing about
sports for The Daily, where I was
surrounded by passionate Ameri
can sports fans, it took time to both
like and understand these foreign
games. Meeting my fellow beat
writer for the 2009-10 women's bas
ketball season for the first time, he
asked me how familiar I already was
with the team. I think he was at least
a little taken aback by my admission
that I wasn't even that sure about
most of the rules.
I know I've written some pretty
critical articles over the years about
U.S. sports and received my fair
share of abuse from readers but
over time my opinions have mel
lowed, and I even might have be
come a little Americanized. Last
week a friend accused me of devel
oping a bit of a U.S. twang in my
voice, and when I recently went out
to buy a soccer ball, I came back
with a football, too.
Don't get me wrong. However
cool it may feel to hold a football in
my hand, my fingers spread out,
gripping the laces, getting ready to
attempt a spiraling throw, it'll never
quite match the feeling of having a
soccer ball at my feet. And standing
shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow
soccer supporters easily beats doing
the same with football fans. My cul
tural connections to British sports
will always run deeper than those to
American ones. From the family ri
valry when my soccer team plays my
brother's to teasing my Welsh friend
when England beats his home coun
try though Wales somehow won
the most recent encounter to sit
ting down with my dad to watch
some international cricket, those ex
periences can't be beat.
But I can still enjoy a dazzling
play in football or basketball, and I
am still willing to give baseball and
hockey a chance. In fact, call it a
sport and you've already got my at
tention. Maybe this is what it's like
to be a real sports fan.
The complaints that both sides
have are often real; neither sport
achieves athletic perfection. During
the four hours it takes to play a foot
ball game,there is relatively little ac

tion on the field, and I can't imagine
many fans in the stadium would
complain if a few seconds were
shaved off each pause. Likewise,
soccer games are generally low
scoring affairs, and few supporters
would be against their club playing
a more attacking style.
But both football and soccer are
products of these characteristics.
The breaks in action allow football
players to recover and the plays to
be far more explosive than they
would otherwise be, and the fact
that goals are difficult to score in
soccer is not a negative thing. Sim
ply scoring more points doesn't
make a sport more worthy, or all
baseball fans would be flocking to
watch cricket.
Cheating, the area in which soc
cer usually draws the most critics, is
relative, too. Yes, soccer players do
dive, and even the most hardened
fan feels some embarrassment when
they do. But, as the New Orleans
Saints showed, football teams break
the rules as well. And what is worse,
pretending you got injured or delib
erately attempting to hurt someone ?
Neither strikes me as particularly
courageous or honorable.
There is a lot to get worked up
about in the world of sports, from
the highs of great games and cham
pionship finals to the lows of cheat
ing and corruption, but we should
n't be fighting each other tooth and
nail in some sort of xenophobic de
fense of our national pastimes. A
great pass, be it from a quarter
back's hand or a midfielder's foot,
should impress us all, no matter our
backgrounds.

Just give Tom Taylor the Nobel
Peace Prize already. The award can

ketball season for the first time, he
asked me how familiar I already was
with the team. I think he was at least
a little taken aback by my admission
that I wasn't even that sure about
most of the rules.
I know I've written some pretty
critical articles over the years about
U.S. sports and received my fair
share of abuse from readers but
over time my opinions have mel
lowed, and I even might have be
come a little Americanized. Last
week a friend accused me of devel
oping a bit of a U.S. twang in my
voice, and when I recently went out
to buy a soccer ball, I came back
with a football, too.
Don't get me wrong. However
cool it may feel to hold a football in
my hand, my fingers spread out,
gripping the laces, getting ready to
attempt a spiraling throw, it'll never
quite match the feeling of having a
soccer ball at my feet. And standing
shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow
soccer supporters easily beats doing
the same with football fans. My cul
tural connections to British sports
will always run deeper than those to
American ones. From the family ri
valry when my soccer team plays my
brother's to teasing my Welsh friend
when England beats his home coun
try though Wales somehow won
the most recent encounter to sit
ting down with my dad to watch
some international cricket, those ex
periences can't be beat.
But I can still enjoy a dazzling
play in football or basketball, and I
am still willing to give baseball and
hockey a chance. In fact, call it a
sport and you've already got my at
tention. Maybe this is what it's like
to be a real sports fan.
The complaints that both sides
have are often real; neither sport
achieves athletic perfection. During
the four hours it takes to play a foot
ball game,there is relatively little ac

tion on the field, and I can't imagine
many fans in the stadium would
complain if a few seconds were
shaved off each pause. Likewise,
soccer games are generally low
scoring affairs, and few supporters
would be against their club playing
a more attacking style.
But both football and soccer are
products of these characteristics.
The breaks in action allow football
players to recover and the plays to
be far more explosive than they
would otherwise be, and the fact
that goals are difficult to score in
soccer is not a negative thing. Sim
ply scoring more points doesn't
make a sport more worthy, or all
baseball fans would be flocking to
watch cricket.
Cheating, the area in which soc
cer usually draws the most critics, is
relative, too. Yes, soccer players do
dive, and even the most hardened
fan feels some embarrassment when
they do. But, as the New Orleans
Saints showed, football teams break
the rules as well. And what is worse,
pretending you got injured or delib
erately attempting to hurt someone ?
Neither strikes me as particularly
courageous or honorable.
There is a lot to get worked up
about in the world of sports, from
the highs of great games and cham
pionship finals to the lows of cheat
ing and corruption, but we should
n't be fighting each other tooth and
nail in some sort of xenophobic de
fense of our national pastimes. A
great pass, be it from a quarter
back's hand or a midfielder's foot,
should impress us all, no matter our
backgrounds.

Just give Tom Taylor the Nobel

Reading Internet com
ments feels a little like
watching a tabloid talk
show. At first it seems
that there might be a
valid point to the proceedings, that
as adults we can maybe come to
gether and have a reasonable dis
cussion. But soon it descends into a
battle of bigoted crazy talk. With
the unaccountability of anonymity,
and egged on by the general tone of
other comments, people don't hold
anything back. Initially this can be a
little amusing, until your mind
starts to ache from the pure stupidi
ty of it all.
Last week, after reading an inter
esting online column about the re
cent boom in television exposure of
soccer in the United States, I kept
reading and plowed headlong into
the comments section below. Pretty
soon a war had evolved; soccer fans
making outlandishly ill-informed
declarations about football, and
very much vice-versa, too. A small
band of peacemakers had bravely
tried to bridge the ideological
chasm, but their balanced and rea
sonable observations were lost
under a flood of abuse.
When I first set foot in Cardinal
territory, I didn't just have zero in
terest in American sports I was
stubbornly opposed to it. Even after
turning my hand to writing about
sports for The Daily, where I was
surrounded by passionate Ameri
can sports fans, it took time to both
like and understand these foreign
games. Meeting my fellow beat
writer for the 2009-10 women's bas
ketball season for the first time, he
asked me how familiar I already was
with the team. I think he was at least
