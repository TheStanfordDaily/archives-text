# FANTASTIC FINISH
## SOFTBALL EARNS AT-LARGE BID 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
On the heels of a dominant sweep over
Washington a week ago, the Cardinal Softball
squad closed out the regular season this past
weekend with an impressive series win over
Utah on the road.
The Cardinal (38-17, 11-13 Pac-12) was
blanked by the Utes (28-28,2-22) by a score
of 6-0 in game one, but bounced back with a
9-1 blowout in the second game and a 12-9
victory in the series finale. With the road wins,
Stanford wound up sixth in the highly com
petitive Pac-12 standings.
Junior pitcher Teagan Gerhart was un
characteristically shaky on the mound early
in Thursday's game, as she allowed five
earned runs despite a six-strikeout perform
ance. The Utah offense managed to inflict
most of its damage in the bottom of the sec
ond inning by scoring five quick runs.
The Stanford bats did not help Gerhart
much either. Utah senior pitcher Generra
Nielson dished out eight strikeouts and held
the Cardinal to just four hits over seven
complete innings. Senior catcher Maya
Burns was the leader of an otherwise quiet
offensive showing, going 2-for-3 at the plate.
But the Utes could only hold off the Car
dinal for so long. In game two, the Cardinal's
bats exploded. Senior shortstop Ashley
Hansen stole the show in the batters box,
going 4-for-4 and matching her career-high
for hits in a game. Just as impressive was the
fact that Hansen hit her 18th career triple in
the process, breaking a school record. The
senior currently leads the Pac-12 in triples,
with eight so far this season.
Joining Hansen in the offensive showcase
was freshman leftfielder Leah White, who
hit a three-run homer in the top of the sixth
that allowed Stanford to put away Utah for
good. The dinger added to White's already
impressive rookie campaign by giving her a
total of five home runs on the season. Fresh
man third baseman Hanna Winter also hit
well at the leadoff spot, going 2-for-4. And
the hitters behind her in the lineup certainly
did their jobs, as five Cardinal hitters drove
in one run or more.
Freshman pitcher Nyree White's domi
nant performance on the mound also proved
to be critical in Stanford's victory in game

two. White, who played on the U.S. Junior Na
tional Team this past summer, did not give up
a single walk or an earned run. The only run
that the Utes scored came from a Cardinal
defensive error in the bottom of the first in
ning. The win improved White's season
record to 7-6 and set up the rubber match.
In the decisive game three, the Stanford
offense once again showed up in full force,
and Utah's Nielson could not limit the scor
ing the second time around. Hansen contin
ued her hot streak by hitting a home run and
a double along with scoring three runs and
driving in another pair. Matching Hansen,
both White and junior second baseman Jenna
Rich accounted for three RBI in the game.
The Utes didn't go down without putting
up a tough fight, however. Utah put the pres
sure on Stanford right away by scoring in the
first inning. On the mound, Gerhart pitched

4.2 innings in which she gave up six runs, but
only one was earned. Nyree White came in
to relieve Gerhart in the fifth despite pitch
ing six full innings the day before, but Ger
hart showed her toughness once again by re
entering the game in the sixth to pick up her
second save of the season.
With the regular season officially
wrapped up, Stanford has set its eyes on the
postseason after receiving an at-large bid to
the NCAA tournament two days ago. Post
season play is nothing new for the Cardinal,
which is making its 15th consecutive appear
ance in the national tournament. The Cardi
nal will square off against Baylor (33-20) in
Lafayette, La., in the opening round of the
tournament on Friday.
