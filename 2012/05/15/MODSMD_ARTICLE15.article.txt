# Uncovering Stanford baseball's hidden gem
## 
### Mosbacher Minute JACK MOSBACHER STAFF WRITER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of
the Stanford baseball team from
2008-2011. Each week, he'll take a
look at the Cardinal's ups and
downs on its road to the College
World Series.
Historically, one of the things
that has made Stanford unique has
been its role as a temporary home
for some of the world's finest ath
letes. Indeed, it is through its schol
ar-athlete tradition that Stanford
conclusively separates itself from
Ivy League institutions, finding a
way to sew the world's greatest
athletic department into the fabric
of one of the great research univer
sities on the globe. It is, in my opin
ion, one of the main reasons why
Stanford is such a special place.
Every so often, a special Cardi
nal athlete distinguishes himself or
herself from the rest. I would argue
that we currently have one of those
once-a-decade student-athletes in
our midst and most of us don't
even know it.
If you were at Sunken Dia
mond this past weekend to watch
No. 17 Stanford cruise to an 8-3 vic
tory in the second leg of an eventu
al three-game sweep of unranked
Washington State, you can proba
bly guess that I'm talking about
Stanford's do-it-all extraordinaire,
junior Stephen Piscotty.
Raised in the idyllic and aptly
named Northern California town
of Pleasanton (ranked No. 63 on
CNN's 2011 "Best Places to Live in
America" list), Piscotty attended
Amador Valley High School,
where he excelled both as a pitch
er and a shortstop. Following his
senior year, the Los Angeles
Dodgers selected Piscotty in the
45th round of the 2009 draft but
could not lure the intriguing
prospect away from his commit
ment to Stanford.
When he arrived at the Farm in
September of 2010, he was just one
of many exciting pieces of a star
studded group of newcomers,
ranked by several publications as
the top baseball recruiting class in
the country. Though he had a good
swing, a rifle for an arm and occa

sionally showed flashes of bril
liance, few of us anticipated just
how good Piscotty would become.
After hitting .350 over nearly
three seasons of brilliant baseball,
he has proven himself to be one of
the best offensive players on the
Farm in the past decade. People
outside of the Bay Area are taking
notice as well: after winning the
batting title in the prestigious Cape
Cod Collegiate Baseball League
last summer, Piscotty is projected
to go in the first round of next
month's MLB draft.
In a career of countless high
lights, however, I wouldn't be sur
prised if this weekend's perform
ance proves to be the most memo
rable performance of Piscotty's al
ready-unforgettable career.
On Saturday, in the second
game of a must-win series, Piscotty
went 3-for-3 and reached base in all
five of his plate appearances, all the
while pitching into the seventh in
ning and giving up only one run to
collect the win in his first career
start on the mound. Simply put, it
was a performance unmatched by
any in recent memory.
In Little League and high
school baseball, it is not uncommon
for the best player on the team to
be both the best pitcher and hitter
on the team. That doesn't happen
in college, particularly not in the
über-competitive Pac-12 confer
ence. It appears that someone for
got to remind Piscotty that he is not
in Little League anymore. At this
level, one player isn't supposed to
win games single-handedly.
Any great competitor wants to
do whatever he or she can to help
their team win a game. With Piscot
ty, the difference is that he can do
whatever is needed to win a game.
That's what makes Piscotty so spe
cial: He matches a peerless com
petitiveness with unparalleled
ability and does things that simply
shouldn't be done on a baseball
field.
Furthermore, in his time at
Stanford, Piscotty has also devel
oped into the type of leader that
every team needs. Quiet and re
served by nature, it's not as though
Stephen has turned into General
George Patton, but no one in the
clubhouse or dugout speaks with
more gravity and weight. More
often than not, Piscotty lets his
play do the talking, exhibiting the
relentless effort, hustle and desire
that has come to characterize
Stanford baseball.
Finally, the best part of Piscot
ty's success is the man he is off of
the field. Although no one is per
fect, he is about as close as it gets
to a model human being. In every
sense, he is a great reflection on
our fine University we are in
describably fortunate to have him
in the Stanford family.
Let this be your warning, folks:
Stephen Piscotty won't be on the
Farm much longer. Come June 4,
Piscotty will undoubtedly hear his
name called early in the 2012
MLB Draft. Do not miss out on
watching, and maybe even meet
ing, one of Stanford's hidden
gems; I promise you won't be dis
appointed.

win games single-handedly.
Any great competitor wants to
do whatever he or she can to help
their team win a game. With Piscot
ty, the difference is that he can do
whatever is needed to win a game.
That's what makes Piscotty so spe
cial: He matches a peerless com
petitiveness with unparalleled
ability and does things that simply
shouldn't be done on a baseball
field.
Furthermore, in his time at
Stanford, Piscotty has also devel
oped into the type of leader that
every team needs. Quiet and re
served by nature, it's not as though
Stephen has turned into General
George Patton, but no one in the
clubhouse or dugout speaks with
more gravity and weight. More
often than not, Piscotty lets his
play do the talking, exhibiting the
relentless effort, hustle and desire
that has come to characterize
Stanford baseball.
Finally, the best part of Piscot
ty's success is the man he is off of
the field. Although no one is per
fect, he is about as close as it gets
to a model human being. In every
sense, he is a great reflection on
our fine University we are in
describably fortunate to have him
in the Stanford family.
Let this be your warning, folks:
Stephen Piscotty won't be on the
Farm much longer. Come June 4,
Piscotty will undoubtedly hear his
name called early in the 2012
MLB Draft. Do not miss out on
watching, and maybe even meet
ing, one of Stanford's hidden
gems; I promise you won't be dis
appointed.

Junior Stephen Piscotty has been a do-it-all player for the Card this season. The leftfielder and projected first-round
MLB draft pick has shown off his full repertoire, most notably in several strong pitching performances.
Jack Mosbacher was a member of
the Stanford baseball team from
2008-2011. Each week, he'll take a
look at the Cardinal's ups and
downs on its road to the College
World Series.
Historically, one of the things
that has made Stanford unique has
been its role as a temporary home
for some of the world's finest ath
letes. Indeed, it is through its schol
ar-athlete tradition that Stanford
conclusively separates itself from
Ivy League institutions, finding a
way to sew the world's greatest
athletic department into the fabric
of one of the great research univer
sities on the globe. It is, in my opin
ion, one of the main reasons why
Stanford is such a special place.
Every so often, a special Cardi
nal athlete distinguishes himself or
herself from the rest. I would argue
that we currently have one of those
once-a-decade student-athletes in
our midst and most of us don't
even know it.
If you were at Sunken Dia
mond this past weekend to watch
No. 17 Stanford cruise to an 8-3 vic
tory in the second leg of an eventu
al three-game sweep of unranked
Washington State, you can proba
bly guess that I'm talking about
Stanford's do-it-all extraordinaire,
junior Stephen Piscotty.
Raised in the idyllic and aptly
named Northern California town
of Pleasanton (ranked No. 63 on
CNN's 2011 "Best Places to Live in
America" list), Piscotty attended
Amador Valley High School,
where he excelled both as a pitch
er and a shortstop. Following his
senior year, the Los Angeles
Dodgers selected Piscotty in the
45th round of the 2009 draft but
could not lure the intriguing
prospect away from his commit
ment to Stanford.
When he arrived at the Farm in
September of 2010, he was just one
of many exciting pieces of a star
studded group of newcomers,
ranked by several publications as
the top baseball recruiting class in
the country. Though he had a good
swing, a rifle for an arm and occa

sionally showed flashes of bril
liance, few of us anticipated just
how good Piscotty would become.
After hitting .350 over nearly
three seasons of brilliant baseball,
he has proven himself to be one of
the best offensive players on the
Farm in the past decade. People
outside of the Bay Area are taking
notice as well: after winning the
batting title in the prestigious Cape
Cod Collegiate Baseball League
last summer, Piscotty is projected
to go in the first round of next
month's MLB draft.
In a career of countless high
lights, however, I wouldn't be sur
prised if this weekend's perform
ance proves to be the most memo
rable performance of Piscotty's al
ready-unforgettable career.
On Saturday, in the second
game of a must-win series, Piscotty
went 3-for-3 and reached base in all
five of his plate appearances, all the
while pitching into the seventh in
ning and giving up only one run to
collect the win in his first career
start on the mound. Simply put, it
was a performance unmatched by
any in recent memory.
In Little League and high
school baseball, it is not uncommon
for the best player on the team to
be both the best pitcher and hitter
on the team. That doesn't happen
in college, particularly not in the
über-competitive Pac-12 confer
ence. It appears that someone for
got to remind Piscotty that he is not
in Little League anymore. At this
level, one player isn't supposed to
win games single-handedly.
