## Student tobacco use far below nat' 1 average 
### ARIELLA AXLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford undergraduates are
well below national averages in
all categories of tobacco use, ac
cording to results from the Core
Alcohol and Drug Survey, a na
tionwide survey of alcohol and
drug habits at colleges across the
country.
The survey indicated that
Stanford was around 50 percent
below national averages both in
the number of students who had
used tobacco in the last year and
students who had ever used to
bacco.
Chronic smoking, indicated by
students who say they smoke
three times or more per week,
came in more than 83 percent
below national averages at only
2.4 percent of survey respondents.
"I was pleasantly surprised by
the results of the study," said
Ralph Castro, director of the Of
fice of Alcohol Policy and Educa
tion (OAPE). OAPE adminis
tered the Core Survey to assess
trends in alcohol use at Stanford.
The survey, standardized nation
ally, also gathers data on use of to
bacco and other drugs.
Providing a variety of data, the
survey illustrated the perceptions
of students toward tobacco as
well as quantitative information
about the frequency and locations
of usage. Results of the study
showed that 23.1 percent of stu
dents say they have used tobacco
over the last year, compared with
the national average of 48.3 per
cent.
The numbers provided by the

survey may reflect on the culture
of tobacco use at Stanford.
"I think it is, in part, a reflec
tion of California and the tough
restrictions on smoking in the Bay
Area," Castro said. "In many
parts of California, there is no
smoking in restaurants, bars and
public spaces, based on city and
country ordinances. From a policy
standpoint, taxation on cigarettes
that fund educational programs,
educational services and public
service announcements have
made a real impact on smoking
statistics in California."
The survey population also
demonstrated that gender differ
ences might be a factor related to
tobacco usage at Stanford. Over
80 percent of women said they
never used tobacco, while only 68
percent of men reported similarly.
Many students said that the
smoking culture at Stanford is
highly social, although not preva
lent.
"It's more of a social thing
when I see people smoking," said
Salish Harrison 'l3, a Peer Health
Educator in Arroyo. "Group wise,
more men do it than women. Usu
ally when I see smokers, it is at
night or at parties smoking out
side, and it's normally when peo
ple are drunk that they smoke,"
The Core Survey supported
this perception the highest cat
egory where people said they
used tobacco was at private par
ties, followed closely by the sec
ond highest, in the home.
"A lot of times alcohol and cig
arettes go together; there is a social
