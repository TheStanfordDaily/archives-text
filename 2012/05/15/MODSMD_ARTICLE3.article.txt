# XOX supporters march
## Protesters demand input as admins, alumni agree on two-year plan 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Proclaiming that "we will not
forget and we will not go quietly,"
approximately 70 Chi Theta Chi
(XOX) residents and members of
the Stanford community
marched on the Office of the Vice
Provost of Student Affairs
(VPSA) on Monday morning in
protest of the University's deci
sion to terminate the house's
lease.
Led by drums and bearing
placards with slogans such as
"Home is where the lease is," pro
testers walked from XOX to the
Tresidder Union office of Student
Affairs, where they called on Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman to engage in a direct
dialogue with residents about the
house's future.
"We are distraught by the fail
ure of [University administra
tors] to acknowledge our repeat
ed attempts to demonstrate the
value of our student-owned and
managed community," said
Kelsey Grousbeck 'l2, a XOX
kitchen manager, reading from a
statement signed by all XOX res

idents and eating associates.
XOX residents have ex
pressed concern in recent weeks
at the lack of input they've been
granted in ongoing negotiations
between the University and the
XOX Alumni Board, a sentiment
echoed in the statement. Stanford
officials voted to let XOX's lease
lapse for at least two years, during
which time Stanford and XOX
will jointly manage the house,
"Since the announcement on
February 8 to revoke Chi Theta
Chi's lease, the administration
has failed to treat Chi Theta Chi's
residents as valued undergradu
ate students," Grousbeck said.
"The administration has demon
strated a lack of consideration for
the character, creativity and fam
ily of Chi Theta Chi."
"I think that it's important for
students to have an outlet," said
Abel Allison 'OB, president of the
Alumni Board, in advance of the
march. "Until recently, we hadn't
really been able to communicate
the details of what's being dis
cussed. I trust that they'll be re
spectful."
Grousbeck argued that the in
troduction of joint oversight

between the University and the
Alumni Board —of the house
for an interim period lasting "a
minimum of two years" would
jeopardize the house's culture of
independent living and the insti
tutional memory of that experi
ence among students.
"Without the knowledge of
the level of responsibility re
quired to run the house and main
tain our community values, the
lease would fall into ineffective
hands," Grousbeck said.
Residents also sought more
immediate clarification by the
University on issues identified as
particularly pressing, such as the
ability of the Alumni Board to re
tain control of the lease during
the interim period, the ability of
residents to continue to pay rent
to the Alumni Board and the
restoration of the lease by the
time current sophomore resi
dents are seniors.
The statement's sentiments
were echoed by Daniel Mattes
'l2, kitchen manager at Enchant
ed Broccoli Forest. Mattes argued
that the XOX lease issue has

been symptomatic of more rigor
ous University oversight of the
co-op community, leading to a
"sense of constant suspense and
fear" for co-op residents.
"We stand in full support of
Chi Theta Chi, and we find it
deeply disturbing how the Uni
versity has handled this," Mattes
said.
Boardman acknowledged that
there are "a number of issues
here which we need to go
through" and offered to converse
with a smaller number of resi
dents in private.
"In the next few days, I will be
reviewing and discussing this
[statement] with my colleagues in
Residential and Dining Enter
prises, which includes Housing, as
well as my staff in Residential
Education," Boardman wrote
later in an email to The Daily.
"And, we'll continue to meet with
the Chi Theta Chi Alumni
Board."
When his offer of a smaller

gathering was refused, however,
Boardman returned to his office
while protesters remained out
side to further express their dis
content with the lease issue.
"The response was disap
pointing," Grousbeck said after
the event, noting that XOX resi
dent representatives had met
with Boardman last week and
had notified him in advance of
the march. "We kind of thought
he would have some response,
even a prepared one."
"These are issues that extend
beyond the 37 people in XOX,"
said Autumn Burnes 'l2, XOX
resident assistant (RA), in
thanking her fellow protesters
for the turnout. "What you're
seeing here is an expression of
frustration from students who
feel excluded from the situa
tion."
After spending just over half
an hour outside the office of Stu
dent Affairs, protesters gradually
dispersed or returned to XOX.
After the event, Boardman ac
knowledged that the lack of stu
dent input in ongoing negotia
tions was "understandably frus
trating" for XOX residents, but
argued that the focus on the lease

a legal document between the
Alumni Board and the Universi
ty meant student input had
been harder to incorporate.
"We are indeed making
progress," Boardman wrote. "In
retrospect, we wish we had devel
oped a more open process that in
cluded the student voice in a
more purposeful manner. Having
said that, however, the Alumni
Board has served, in my opinion,
as strong advocates for the Chi
Theta Chi community."
Alex Kindel 'l4, a marcher
and a former ASSU Senator, ex
pressed optimism about the de
gree of student involvement in
the protests, but criticized the re
sponse by administrators.
"I thought it was great that so
many students from across cam
pus rolled out in support," Kindel
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"To their credit, VPSA and Resi
dential Education officials did
listen to student statements, but it
was disappointing to me that they
declined to participate in a con
versation with the gathered stu
dents."

Led by drums and bearing
placards with slogans such as
"Home is where the lease is," pro
testers walked from XOX to the
Tresidder Union office of Student
Affairs, where they called on Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman to engage in a direct
dialogue with residents about the
house's future.
"We are distraught by the fail
ure of [University administra
tors] to acknowledge our repeat
ed attempts to demonstrate the
value of our student-owned and
managed community," said
Kelsey Grousbeck 'l2, a XOX
kitchen manager, reading from a
statement signed by all XOX res

idents and eating associates.
XOX residents have ex
pressed concern in recent weeks
at the lack of input they've been
granted in ongoing negotiations
between the University and the
XOX Alumni Board, a sentiment
echoed in the statement. Stanford
officials voted to let XOX's lease
lapse for at least two years, during
which time Stanford and XOX
will jointly manage the house,
"Since the announcement on
February 8 to revoke Chi Theta
Chi's lease, the administration
has failed to treat Chi Theta Chi's
residents as valued undergradu
ate students," Grousbeck said.
"The administration has demon
strated a lack of consideration for
the character, creativity and fam
ily of Chi Theta Chi."
"I think that it's important for
students to have an outlet," said
Abel Allison 'OB, president of the
Alumni Board, in advance of the
march. "Until recently, we hadn't
really been able to communicate
the details of what's being dis
cussed. I trust that they'll be re
spectful."
Grousbeck argued that the in
troduction of joint oversight

between the University and the
Alumni Board —of the house
for an interim period lasting "a
minimum of two years" would
jeopardize the house's culture of
independent living and the insti
tutional memory of that experi
ence among students.
"Without the knowledge of
the level of responsibility re
quired to run the house and main
tain our community values, the
lease would fall into ineffective
hands," Grousbeck said.
Residents also sought more
immediate clarification by the
University on issues identified as
particularly pressing, such as the
ability of the Alumni Board to re
tain control of the lease during
the interim period, the ability of
residents to continue to pay rent
to the Alumni Board and the
restoration of the lease by the
time current sophomore resi
dents are seniors.
The statement's sentiments
were echoed by Daniel Mattes
'l2, kitchen manager at Enchant
ed Broccoli Forest. Mattes argued
that the XOX lease issue has

been symptomatic of more rigor
ous University oversight of the
co-op community, leading to a
"sense of constant suspense and
fear" for co-op residents.
"We stand in full support of
Chi Theta Chi, and we find it
deeply disturbing how the Uni
versity has handled this," Mattes
said.
Boardman acknowledged that
there are "a number of issues
here which we need to go
through" and offered to converse
with a smaller number of resi
dents in private.
"In the next few days, I will be
reviewing and discussing this
[statement] with my colleagues in
Residential and Dining Enter
prises, which includes Housing, as
well as my staff in Residential
Education," Boardman wrote
later in an email to The Daily.
"And, we'll continue to meet with
the Chi Theta Chi Alumni
Board."
When his offer of a smaller

gathering was refused, however,
Boardman returned to his office
while protesters remained out
side to further express their dis
content with the lease issue.
"The response was disap
pointing," Grousbeck said after
the event, noting that XOX resi
dent representatives had met
with Boardman last week and
had notified him in advance of
the march. "We kind of thought
he would have some response,
even a prepared one."
"These are issues that extend
beyond the 37 people in XOX,"
said Autumn Burnes 'l2, XOX
resident assistant (RA), in
thanking her fellow protesters
for the turnout. "What you're
seeing here is an expression of
frustration from students who
feel excluded from the situa
tion."
After spending just over half
an hour outside the office of Stu
dent Affairs, protesters gradually
dispersed or returned to XOX.
After the event, Boardman ac
knowledged that the lack of stu
dent input in ongoing negotia
tions was "understandably frus
trating" for XOX residents, but
argued that the focus on the lease

a legal document between the
Alumni Board and the Universi
ty meant student input had
been harder to incorporate.
"We are indeed making
progress," Boardman wrote. "In
retrospect, we wish we had devel
oped a more open process that in
cluded the student voice in a
more purposeful manner. Having
said that, however, the Alumni
Board has served, in my opinion,
as strong advocates for the Chi
Theta Chi community."
Alex Kindel 'l4, a marcher
and a former ASSU Senator, ex
pressed optimism about the de
gree of student involvement in
the protests, but criticized the re
sponse by administrators.
"I thought it was great that so
many students from across cam
pus rolled out in support," Kindel
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"To their credit, VPSA and Resi
dential Education officials did
listen to student statements, but it
was disappointing to me that they
declined to participate in a con
versation with the gathered stu
dents."
