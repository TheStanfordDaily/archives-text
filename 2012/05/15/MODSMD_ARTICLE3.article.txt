# XOX supporters march
## Protesters demand input as admins, alumni agree on two-year plan 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Proclaiming that "we will not
forget and we will not go quietly,"
approximately 70 Chi Theta Chi
(XOX) residents and members of
the Stanford community
marched on the Office of the Vice
Provost of Student Affairs
(VPSA) on Monday morning in
protest of the University's deci
sion to terminate the house's
lease.
Led by drums and bearing
placards with slogans such as
"Home is where the lease is," pro
testers walked from XOX to the
Tresidder Union office of Student
Affairs, where they called on Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman to engage in a direct
dialogue with residents about the
house's future.
"We are distraught by the fail
ure of [University administra
tors] to acknowledge our repeat
ed attempts to demonstrate the
value of our student-owned and
managed community," said
Kelsey Grousbeck 'l2, a XOX
kitchen manager, reading from a
statement signed by all XOX res

idents and eating associates.
XOX residents have ex
pressed concern in recent weeks
at the lack of input they've been
granted in ongoing negotiations
between the University and the
XOX Alumni Board, a sentiment
echoed in the statement. Stanford
officials voted to let XOX's lease
lapse for at least two years, during
which time Stanford and XOX
will jointly manage the house,
"Since the announcement on
February 8 to revoke Chi Theta
Chi's lease, the administration
has failed to treat Chi Theta Chi's
residents as valued undergradu
ate students," Grousbeck said.
"The administration has demon
strated a lack of consideration for
the character, creativity and fam
ily of Chi Theta Chi."
"I think that it's important for
students to have an outlet," said
Abel Allison 'OB, president of the
Alumni Board, in advance of the
march. "Until recently, we hadn't
really been able to communicate
the details of what's being dis
cussed. I trust that they'll be re
spectful."
Grousbeck argued that the in
troduction of joint oversight

between the University and the
Alumni Board â€”of the house
for an interim period lasting "a
minimum of two years" would
jeopardize the house's culture of
independent living and the insti
tutional memory of that experi
ence among students.
"Without the knowledge of
the level of responsibility re
quired to run the house and main
tain our community values, the
lease would fall into ineffective
hands," Grousbeck said.
Residents also sought more
immediate clarification by the
University on issues identified as
particularly pressing, such as the
ability of the Alumni Board to re
tain control of the lease during
the interim period, the ability of
residents to continue to pay rent
to the Alumni Board and the
restoration of the lease by the
time current sophomore resi
dents are seniors.
The statement's sentiments
were echoed by Daniel Mattes
'l2, kitchen manager at Enchant
ed Broccoli Forest. Mattes argued
