# STUDENT LIFE
## Professional athlete hopefuls balance sport and school life 
### ANTONIO RAMIREZ 
For many Stanford student
athletes, following their dreams
into professional sports means
making sacrifices. In particular,
they must juggle a demanding ac
ademic schedule and an accelerat
ing athletic career.
Many student-athletes make
plans to graduate early or alter
their schedules in order to pursue
Olympic dreams or a professional
sports career. Some athletes have
to plan alternative class schedules
within University require
ments to accommodate their
professional sports schedules.
These strains are especially
prominent this spring, with sever
al Stanford students selected in
the late-April NFL draft and par
ticipating in the upcoming sum
mer Olympics, along with other
professional sports.
Julia Landauer T4, a hopeful
professional racecar driver, fin
ished up her sophomore year
early this past week in order to
"pursue a racing opportunity"
that she declined to disclose to
The Daily.
Landauer arranged to finish
the 10-week spring quarter in less
than six weeks by her own initia
tive.
"Since about winter break, I

started contacting professors and
looking into the curriculum to see
if there were any classes I could
take where the teachers would
also work with me," Landauer
said. "I could only take classes
with final papers and presenta
tions so I wouldn't break the
Honor Code by taking finals
early."
Kristina Vaculik 'l4, who will
try out for the Canadian women's

gymnastics team in June, had to
miss time to compete almost im
mediately after arriving at the
Farm.
Vaculik missed three weeks of
the fall quarter of her freshman
year to compete in the World
Championships. When she arrived
back at Stanford, it was just in time
for the first round of midterms.
The Canadian women's gym
nastics team qualified for the 2012

Summer Olympics in London, and
Vaculik chose to defer her sopho
more year at Stanford and return
home to train full-time.
"I've always wanted to go to
the Olympics," Vaculik said.
"That's why I planned out my aca
demics and my sport the way I
did."
Like Vaculik, many Olympic
hopefuls arrange to take time
away from Stanford to train or

compete in addition to altering
their schedules.
Among them is Maria Korole
va 'l2, who will be a member of
the U.S. women's Olympic syn
chronized swim team.
Since joining the U.S. national
team in 2007, Koroleva has spent
her summers living and practicing
with the team. This past year, she
chose to postpone her graduation
date, which would have been this
June, to take the year away from
classes to train full-time.
"For synchro, you have to train
with the team," Koroleva said.
"This year, the training location
was in Indianapolis, so if you want
to be on the team, you have to
move."
After the Olympics, Koroleva
plans to return to Stanford and
graduate with a communication
major.
As difficult as it may be to han
dle a vigorous academic schedule
and life as an athlete, the quarter
system helps some athletes.
