# STUDENT LIFE
## Professional athlete hopefuls balance sport and school life 
### ANTONIO RAMIREZ 
For many Stanford student
athletes, following their dreams
into professional sports means
making sacrifices. In particular,
they must juggle a demanding ac
ademic schedule and an accelerat
ing athletic career.
Many student-athletes make
plans to graduate early or alter
their schedules in order to pursue
Olympic dreams or a professional
sports career. Some athletes have
to plan alternative class schedules
within University require
ments to accommodate their
professional sports schedules.
These strains are especially
prominent this spring, with sever
al Stanford students selected in
the late-April NFL draft and par
ticipating in the upcoming sum
mer Olympics, along with other
professional sports.
Julia Landauer T4, a hopeful
professional racecar driver, fin
ished up her sophomore year
early this past week in order to
"pursue a racing opportunity"
that she declined to disclose to
The Daily.
Landauer arranged to finish
the 10-week spring quarter in less
than six weeks by her own initia
tive.
"Since about winter break, I

started contacting professors and
looking into the curriculum to see
if there were any classes I could
take where the teachers would
also work with me," Landauer
said. "I could only take classes
with final papers and presenta
tions so I wouldn't break the
Honor Code by taking finals
early."
Kristina Vaculik 'l4, who will
try out for the Canadian women's

gymnastics team in June, had to
miss time to compete almost im
mediately after arriving at the
Farm.
Vaculik missed three weeks of
the fall quarter of her freshman
year to compete in the World
Championships. When she arrived
back at Stanford, it was just in time
for the first round of midterms.
The Canadian women's gym
nastics team qualified for the 2012

Summer Olympics in London, and
Vaculik chose to defer her sopho
more year at Stanford and return
home to train full-time.
"I've always wanted to go to
the Olympics," Vaculik said.
"That's why I planned out my aca
demics and my sport the way I
did."
Like Vaculik, many Olympic
hopefuls arrange to take time
away from Stanford to train or

compete in addition to altering
their schedules.
Among them is Maria Korole
va 'l2, who will be a member of
the U.S. women's Olympic syn
chronized swim team.
Since joining the U.S. national
team in 2007, Koroleva has spent
her summers living and practicing
with the team. This past year, she
chose to postpone her graduation
date, which would have been this
June, to take the year away from
classes to train full-time.
"For synchro, you have to train
with the team," Koroleva said.
"This year, the training location
was in Indianapolis, so if you want
to be on the team, you have to
move."
After the Olympics, Koroleva
plans to return to Stanford and
graduate with a communication
major.
As difficult as it may be to han
dle a vigorous academic schedule
and life as an athlete, the quarter
system helps some athletes.

Aspiring professional racecar driver Julia Landauer is one of many student-athletes who juggle a budding professional
career with a school schedule. Landauer arranged her coursework to finish this spring quarter early.
Klahn shouldered a heavy aca
demic schedule and stored up
enough units to graduate with an
economics major this past winter
quarter and focus on tennis this
spring.
"There's no shortcut for ath
letes," Klahn said. "It's difficult

for us, no question. Every student
athlete is intelligent and capable
of handling the rigors of balanc
ing both [school and sports]."
Klahn is looking to become a
professional tennis player after he
completes his final season with
the Stanford tennis team.
Many athletes said they find it
difficult to work with professors to
find courses that both count toward
a degree and fit into a professional
athlete's schedule, which can vary
widely depending on the sport.

Landauer said she had to start
planning early to find a plausible
schedule with her professors.
"They appreciated the respon
sibility I was taking with my activ
ities, and I found three [classes]
that worked for me and counted
towards my major," she said. "So I
got pretty lucky with that one,"
Landauer said she has found
her sport and academic pursuits
complementary. Majoring in Sci
ence, Technology and Society
(STS), Landauer plans to apply

her degree toward racing.
"I'll be able to tell by the time
I'm 25 or 26 if it looks like I'll
make it or not," Landauer contin
ued. "If so, fantastic! If not, I'll uti
lize the skills I've learned at Stan
ford and from my Julia Landauer
Racing brand development to go
into the racing industry."
Many athletes agreed that the
scheduling conflicts made their
passion for their athletics even
more apparent.
Molly Kinsella 'l2, who is

training for the U.S. women's
rugby team following the Stanford
team's national championship loss
this weekend, is well aware of this
reality. After her sophomore year,
she made the switch from being a
varsity track and field thrower to
play lock on the Stanford
women's rugby team.
"I think the culture is nice,"
Kinsella said in reference to
rugby. "The people who want to
be there are there, and I think that
makes those few hours a lot more
valuable."
Kinsella said that USA Rugby
expects its players to take respon
sibility and commence the train
ing for the program on their own.
"They [USA Rugby] are trying
to do something new," Kinsella
said. "It's called Eagle 365, and
the idea is that you live every day
of your life with this goal of going
to the World Cup in 2014. They
give you strength and condition
ing workouts, nutritionist access,
mental imagery and a whole
binder of information. The idea is
really trying to make it workable
for athletes."
The USA Rugby team and the
Eagle 365 program are more in
dependent than many programs,
but most professional sports pro
grams present huge time manage
ment difficulties to students.
"It's challenging, but definitely
well worth it," Klahn said of bal
ancing school and tennis.
Likewise, Landauer said she is
willing to make accommodations in
the future to continue with racing.
"The goal is to be able to make
a living from driving a race car,
whether it be in stock cars, formu
la cars, sports cars, production
cars [or] sprint cars," Landauer
said.
"Even school buses," she added,
jokingly.
