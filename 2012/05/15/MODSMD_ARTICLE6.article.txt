## Bing Concert Hall site begins to take final form 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
The rising Bing Concert Hall, a
project seeking to build a "world
class performing arts center" ac
cording to signage near the site, has
made significant progress this
spring and is beginning to resem
ble its finished form. Located
across Palm Drive from Cantor
Arts Center, the concert hall is set
to open in Fall 2012 with its first
performances scheduled for Janu
ary 2013.
"Construction is 75 percent
complete," said Maggie Burgett,
project manager for the concert
hall. "We will have substantial
completion at the end of August."
Burgett said that final touches
on the project will continue into
October.
The building consists of a tall,
stucco cylinder with a square glass
lobby surrounding it. According to
Burgett, a metal trim will be added
to some parts of the stucco cylinder
to complete the building's facade.
The whole facility will ultimate
ly include a lobby, artist suites, a
2,300-square foot rehearsal hall,
offices, practice rooms and storage
space, in addition to the concert
hall.
Although construction will fin
ish around October, Burgett said
the performances will not begin
until January 2013 to allow time to
tune the building and for the music
department and Lively Arts pro
gram to move in.
"The Bing Concert Hall will

feature a wide mix of program
ming in many different genres, in
cluding both visiting artists and
student performers," said Matthew
Tiews, executive director of arts
programs, in an email to The Daily.
Acts scheduled for the 844-seat
concert hall's opening year include
percussionist Glenn Kotche, cellist
Yo-Yo Ma performing with pianist
Kathryn Stott, and pianists
Emanuel Ax and Jon Nakamatsu,
according to the Stanford Report.
"The hall will be high-use," Bur
gett said, noting that the opening
year acts are "typical of what will
be presented" at the concert hall.
Tiews said that the concert hall
will also be available for some stu
dent groups. Performances will in
clude the Stanford Symphony Or
chestra, Symphonic Chorus and
computer-based performers from
Stanford's Center for Computer
Research in Music and Acoustics
(CCRMA).
The hall represents part of a
University effort to enhance arts
programming. The Study of Un
dergraduate Education at Stan
ford (SUES) report even men
tioned the idea of creating an unof
ficial "arts district" on campus,
using Cantor and Bing as anchors.
Two more buildings planned to
help define the arts district, the An
derson Collection at Stanford and
the McMurtry Art and Art History
Building, will open in 2014 and
2015, respectively, near Bing Hall.
