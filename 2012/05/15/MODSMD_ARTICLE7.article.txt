## California Gov. Jerry Brown proposes $8.3 billion in spending cuts 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Matt Bettonville 
California Governor Jerry
Brown proposed heavy spending
cuts Monday to compensate for
the state's $15.7 billion budget
deficit. Brown's proposal, which he
presented at a press conference in
Los Angeles, would cut $8.3 billion
in state spending cuts to public sec
tor employee pay, social programs
and prison spending.
"I don't like making additional
cuts, and I recognize the impact
they have on Californians," Brown
said in discussing the plan, accord
ing to The New York Times. "They
are difficult but necessary in
order to get us back on firm fiscal
footing until California fully recov

ers from the global economic re
cession."
The proposal would help
negate the need for proposed cuts
to California public schools, a topic
of much debate, especially in the
Bay Area. In early March, Stan
ford's Occupy Meyer protest
group traveled to UC-Berkeley to
present an open letter at Berke
ley's Occupy Education protest
against state public education cuts.
Brown has also proposed a
quarter-cent sales tax hike and an
additional tax on the wealthy
known as the Millionaire Tax. On
Monday, he said that these meas
ures, combined with his proposed
spending cuts, would result in a 16
percent increase in state public
school spending.
The taxes, however, are hotly
contested.
Brown said that if the cuts pro
posed today do not pass, the state
would have to cut $6 billion from
funding for public schools.
