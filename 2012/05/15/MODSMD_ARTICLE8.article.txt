## MAKING OF A MUSEUM 
### â€” Josee Smith 
The place where the Iris and B.
Gerald Cantor Center for Vi
sual Arts now stands was once
home to the Leland Stanford
Jr. Museum. The museum was
founded in 1891, the same year as the Uni
versity, and opened to the public in 1894. It
originally housed the artifacts that Leland
Stanford Jr., the University's namesake,
collected in Europe before his death at
age 15 of typhoid fever.
The museum was hit by the 1906 earth
quake and later closed in 1945 following
years of disuse, but the next year a com
mittee was established to rejuvenate the
museum. Over time, the site branched out
to incorporate holdings beyond Stan
ford's initial collection. Eventually, the
museum committee decided to look out
side of Stanford's campus to receive addi
tional funds and direction.
The external contributors recruited to
revamp the museum's direction and fi
nancial backing were Iris and Gerald B.
Cantor, prominent art collectors and phi
lanthropists.
"Iris and B. 'Bernie' Gerald Cantor, a
successful financier and philanthropist,
became serious collectors of Rodin sculp
tures after Mr. Cantor saw Rodin's 'Hand
of God' in a Madison Avenue gallery win
dow in 1947," Patience Young, curator for
education at Cantor, wrote in an email to
The Daily.
Young added that the Cantors' collab
oration with Stanford University
stemmed from a relationship with Albert
Elsen, a professor of art history and ca
reer-long Rodin scholar. With their com
bined passion for the French sculptor,
Elsen and the Cantors planned the Rodin
Sculpture Garden that opened in 1985.
In the late 1980s, the Stanford campus,

including the museum, was hit by the
Loma Prieta earthquake, which caused
significant damage to the building.
In a 1988 article, The Daily reported on
damage to the Stanford campus as a result
of the earthquake.
"Stanford and the surrounding area
were rocked by an earthquake that meas
ured 7.0 on the Richter scale ... Some
pieces of artwork in the [museum] suf
fered major damage from the quake,"The
Daily reported ("7.0 quake rocks Stan
ford," Oct. 18,1989).
A few days later, the museum also "suf
fered major structural damage,"The Daily
reported. The museum administrator at
the time, Mary Drickey, added that the
building was closed indefinitely ("Quake
damage estimate placed at $l6O million,"
October 23,1989).
After the 1989 earthquake, Stanford
and the supporting art community decid
ed to rescue the damaged museum build
ing and revive the institution. Tom Selig
man '65, the John and Jill Freidenrich Di
rector of the Cantor Arts Center until his
retirement in December 2011, was hired
as the full-time director of the museum in
1991 and began fundraising to restore and
add to the existing building.
Young added that the Cantors were
major donors to that campaign, and the
renovated museum now bears their
name. Many other funders were involved,
and their names are displayed in the
lobby and elsewhere around the galleries.
Finally, in January 1999, the museum
reopened to the public and showcased its
new and more extensive exhibits.
"The Stanford Art Museum, now
known as the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor
Center for Visual Arts, will re-open to the
Stanford community and public this

weekend,"The Daily reported. "The Uni
versity spent $36.8 million on the muse
um to undo damage done by the [Loma
Prieta] earthquake" ("Museum reopens
tomorrow," Jan. 22,1999).
Young added that the museum prima
rily relies on gifts, bequests and long-term
loans to attain works. Past exhibitions in
clude "The Photography of John Gut
mann: Culture Shock" (1999), "Fictional
Worlds, Virtual Experiences: Storytelling
and Computer Games" (2003) and "Col
lection Highlights from Europe 1500-
1800, Ancient Greece and Rome" (2010).
Over the years, the museum itself has
received increasingly more visitors due to
its collections. Young estimated annual
visitors at about 200,000.
Anna Koster, Cantor head of commu
nications, added that about 20,000 of
those visitors only visit the Rodin Sculp
ture Garden and never go inside.
"This is the largest and most compre
hensive art museum between San Fran
cisco and Santa Barbara, so we draw a lot
of visitors for many reasons, for formal
study and for informal learning and for
the simple pleasures of spending time
browsing the galleries," Young said.
The museum's exhibitions are made
up of Cantor's own pieces or are bor
rowed from other institutions.
In mid-May, the museum will open its
next big exhibition, titled "Central Nigeria
Unmasked: Arts of the Benue River Val
ley." Organized by the Fowler Museum at
UCLA, the exhibit is currently traveling
across the university art museum circuit.
"Our exhibition schedules are usually
planned some years into the future to
allow each project to mature thoughtfully
for our viewers," Young said.

The place where the Iris and B.
Gerald Cantor Center for Vi
sual Arts now stands was once
home to the Leland Stanford
Jr. Museum. The museum was
founded in 1891, the same year as the Uni
versity, and opened to the public in 1894. It
originally housed the artifacts that Leland
Stanford Jr., the University's namesake,
collected in Europe before his death at
age 15 of typhoid fever.
The museum was hit by the 1906 earth
quake and later closed in 1945 following
years of disuse, but the next year a com
mittee was established to rejuvenate the
museum. Over time, the site branched out
to incorporate holdings beyond Stan
ford's initial collection. Eventually, the
museum committee decided to look out
side of Stanford's campus to receive addi
tional funds and direction.
The external contributors recruited to
revamp the museum's direction and fi
nancial backing were Iris and Gerald B.
Cantor, prominent art collectors and phi
lanthropists.
"Iris and B. 'Bernie' Gerald Cantor, a
successful financier and philanthropist,
became serious collectors of Rodin sculp
tures after Mr. Cantor saw Rodin's 'Hand
of God' in a Madison Avenue gallery win
dow in 1947," Patience Young, curator for
education at Cantor, wrote in an email to
The Daily.
Young added that the Cantors' collab
oration with Stanford University
stemmed from a relationship with Albert
Elsen, a professor of art history and ca
reer-long Rodin scholar. With their com
bined passion for the French sculptor,
Elsen and the Cantors planned the Rodin
Sculpture Garden that opened in 1985.
In the late 1980s, the Stanford campus,

including the museum, was hit by the
Loma Prieta earthquake, which caused
significant damage to the building.
In a 1988 article, The Daily reported on
damage to the Stanford campus as a result
of the earthquake.
"Stanford and the surrounding area
were rocked by an earthquake that meas
ured 7.0 on the Richter scale ... Some
pieces of artwork in the [museum] suf
fered major damage from the quake,"The
Daily reported ("7.0 quake rocks Stan
ford," Oct. 18,1989).
A few days later, the museum also "suf
fered major structural damage,"The Daily
reported. The museum administrator at
the time, Mary Drickey, added that the
building was closed indefinitely ("Quake
damage estimate placed at $l6O million,"
October 23,1989).
After the 1989 earthquake, Stanford
and the supporting art community decid
ed to rescue the damaged museum build
ing and revive the institution. Tom Selig
man '65, the John and Jill Freidenrich Di
rector of the Cantor Arts Center until his
retirement in December 2011, was hired
as the full-time director of the museum in
1991 and began fundraising to restore and
add to the existing building.
Young added that the Cantors were
major donors to that campaign, and the
renovated museum now bears their
name. Many other funders were involved,
and their names are displayed in the
lobby and elsewhere around the galleries.
Finally, in January 1999, the museum
reopened to the public and showcased its
new and more extensive exhibits.
"The Stanford Art Museum, now
known as the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor
Center for Visual Arts, will re-open to the
Stanford community and public this

weekend,"The Daily reported. "The Uni
versity spent $36.8 million on the muse
um to undo damage done by the [Loma
Prieta] earthquake" ("Museum reopens
tomorrow," Jan. 22,1999).
Young added that the museum prima
rily relies on gifts, bequests and long-term
loans to attain works. Past exhibitions in
clude "The Photography of John Gut
mann: Culture Shock" (1999), "Fictional
Worlds, Virtual Experiences: Storytelling
and Computer Games" (2003) and "Col
lection Highlights from Europe 1500-
1800, Ancient Greece and Rome" (2010).
Over the years, the museum itself has
received increasingly more visitors due to
its collections. Young estimated annual
visitors at about 200,000.
Anna Koster, Cantor head of commu
nications, added that about 20,000 of
those visitors only visit the Rodin Sculp
ture Garden and never go inside.
"This is the largest and most compre
hensive art museum between San Fran
cisco and Santa Barbara, so we draw a lot
of visitors for many reasons, for formal
study and for informal learning and for
the simple pleasures of spending time
browsing the galleries," Young said.
The museum's exhibitions are made
up of Cantor's own pieces or are bor
rowed from other institutions.
In mid-May, the museum will open its
next big exhibition, titled "Central Nigeria
Unmasked: Arts of the Benue River Val
ley." Organized by the Fowler Museum at
UCLA, the exhibit is currently traveling
across the university art museum circuit.
"Our exhibition schedules are usually
planned some years into the future to
allow each project to mature thoughtfully
for our viewers," Young said.
