Powwow, which was held for three days
last weekend from May 11 to 13.
The word powwow translates to
"spiritual leader" in Narragansett, the
language of the Narragansett tribe.
Modern-day powwows generally in

volve both Native Americans and non-
Native Americans gathering together
in celebration of Native American cul
ture.
According to Layton Lamsam 'l4,
co-chair of Stanford Powwow, the event
is one of "the top two or three major
ones in the country and definitely the

largest in the Bay Area."
"I am originally from Oklahoma, and
I know people that come out here just
for this event," he said. "When people
hear 'Stanford Powwow,' they know it. It
has name recognition."
