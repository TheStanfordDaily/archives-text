## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Ileana Najarro 
After rigorous debate, the Palo
Alto City Council voted 7-2 on
Tuesday to approve the construc
tion of and rezoning for a new
"gateway" building on the corner of
Lytton Street and Alma Street ac
cording to an article in the San Jose
Mercury News.
The three-story, 50-foot-tall
building would include office
spaces, retail and a 70-foot-tall cor
ner tower.These approved plans are
a reduction of the initially planned
five-story building, following
months of debate between Palo
Alto's planning commission and
Lytton Gateway LCC.
The negotiations also require the
new building to make space for 14
affordable housing units.
While the council officially ap
proved moving forward with the
project's construction, speakers at
the council meeting raised issues
surrounding a possible parking
strain. Many argued that the build
ing's location would only contribute
negatively to the existing traffic con
gestion problem due to a reduction
of parking space.
In response to these claims, the
council also approved Vice Mayor
Greg Scharffs proposal to allocate
some of the funds behind the build
ing's affordable housing project to
the issue of parking and traffic con
gestions. The $2 million in question
would potentially go toward a park
ing garage for city use, but details
are yet to be confirmed.
