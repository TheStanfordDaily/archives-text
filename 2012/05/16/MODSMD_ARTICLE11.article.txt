## WATER IN THE WEST DEPARTMENTS COLLABORATE FOR WATER POLICY CHANGE 
### JOSHHOYT STAFF WRITER 
Many homesteaders
came to the Amer
ican West in the
19th century with
the tragically mis
informed notion that "the rain fol
lows the plow," a theory suggest
ing that human land occupation
and agricultural production of an
area would beneficially alter the
precipitation and climate of that
same region. Ironically, the home
steaders' land, which is consid
ered to be the backbone of Amer
ican agriculture and produces 50
percent of the nation's fruits, veg
etables and nuts, is now known as
the "Arid Region."
"We face some really dire cir
cumstances when we look at the
water situation in the western
United States," said Andrew
Fahlund, executive director of the
Stanford project Water in the
West.
Water in the West, formed in
January 2010, is a joint program
by the Woods Institute for the En
vironment and the Bill Lane Cen
ter for the American West. It aims
to engage in research and policy
initiatives from various academic
disciplines in order to deliver so
lutions for the key water chal
lenges in the western United
States.
In particular, the program fo
cuses on three aspects: groundwa
ter management, water recycling
and water system sustainability.
Fahlund emphasized that he and
his partners are mobilizing all of
the relevant expertise at Stanford
to create an interdisciplinary look
at the pertinent issues.
"The quality of the engineering
department here, coupled with the
remarkable legal minds and the
economists ... then you bring in
people from the history depart
ment and from journalism, and all
of them have contributions to take
on a very complicated issue,"

Fahlund said.
Members of Water in the West
led a 2011 Sophomore College
class on a two-week, 225-mile trip
down the Colorado River in the
Grand Canyon in order to intro
duce undergraduates to the com
plexities of the water system in the
region.
The Colorado River supplies
water and power to over 25 mil
lion people in seven states, as well
as to parts of Mexico. The water is
supplied to a diverse range of peo
ple, from rural farmers to urban
ites in Los Angeles, and increasing
demand for this essential re
source, coupled with a decrease in
water volume, is causing major
conflicts.The river once ran all the
way through Mexico and out
through the Gulf of California but
now runs dry at many places. Ac
cording to a 2010 Smithsonian ar
ticle, the river is 130 feet lower
than it was in 2000.
Besides the effects of water
diversion from dams and irriga
tion, Fahlund stressed that the
dire situation of freshwater
ecosystems in California can be
traced to climate change. Snow
pack in California, a natural
water storage system, is expected
to decrease by as much as 80 per
cent over the next 50 years, and
groundwater is being pumped
out of the ground faster than it
can be replenished.
"Freshwater ecosystems across
the West are pretty stressed and
they are really at breaking point,
and up until recently they were
largely ignored," Fahlund said.
"You don't think about water
policy on a macroscopic level, and
you don't think about things like
[the fact] that L.A. only exists be
cause they have been swindling
water," said Andrea Acosta 'l4,
one of the 2011 Sophomore Col
lege participants.
"Being aware of these bureau
cratic policy fights and being on
the river and seeing the people
and places that policy actually af
fects made the ideas so much more

meaningful," she added.
While students of the Sopho
more College trip reflected that
they had fun learning to raft and
enjoyed being surrounded by the
dramatic landscape, many came
away with deep concerns about
the future of the water in the area.
"I am not really sure who would
be optimistic about this situation,"
said Julia Barrero 'l4, who also
participated in the Sophomore
College class. "Maybe I am opti
mistic just because we need to be
optimistic in the face of this crisis."
Fahlund said he sees hope for
improvement by bridging the
fields through communication and
cooperation.

"We held a meeting just a few
days ago bringing in groundwater
managers from around the state of
California, as well as researchers,"
Fahlund said. "I don't think the re
searchers had historically given a
great deal of thought to what prac
tical questions groundwater man
agers have had, and groundwater
managers had never bothered to
ask the question, 'What could re
search actually do for me in my
practical challenges?'
"Our job is like translating in a
sense," he added.
David Kennedy '63, professor
of history and faculty co-director of
the Bill Lane Center, looks to the
history of water in the West both as

an explanation and guide to han
dling the current water crisis.
"It is just an incredible engi
neering accomplishment to put in
place the system we have, and it
didn't just happen ... it took gen
erations and it took focus and po
litical will and engineering inge
nuity," Kennedy said. "So if prior
generations had that much ambi
tion and ingenuity, then I don't see
why we in future generations
shouldn't have something compa
rable to update the system."
However, he warned, "We
can't go on as we have been."

dramatic landscape, many came
away with deep concerns about
the future of the water in the area.
"I am not really sure who would
be optimistic about this situation,"
said Julia Barrero 'l4, who also
participated in the Sophomore
College class. "Maybe I am opti
mistic just because we need to be
optimistic in the face of this crisis."
Fahlund said he sees hope for
improvement by bridging the
fields through communication and
cooperation.

"We held a meeting just a few
days ago bringing in groundwater
managers from around the state of
California, as well as researchers,"
Fahlund said. "I don't think the re
searchers had historically given a
great deal of thought to what prac
tical questions groundwater man
agers have had, and groundwater
managers had never bothered to
ask the question, 'What could re
search actually do for me in my
practical challenges?'
"Our job is like translating in a
sense," he added.
David Kennedy '63, professor
of history and faculty co-director of
the Bill Lane Center, looks to the
history of water in the West both as

an explanation and guide to han
dling the current water crisis.
"It is just an incredible engi
neering accomplishment to put in
place the system we have, and it
didn't just happen ... it took gen
erations and it took focus and po
litical will and engineering inge
nuity," Kennedy said. "So if prior
generations had that much ambi
tion and ingenuity, then I don't see
why we in future generations
shouldn't have something compa
rable to update the system."
However, he warned, "We
can't go on as we have been."

Many homesteaders
came to the Amer
ican West in the
19th century with
the tragically mis
informed notion that "the rain fol
lows the plow," a theory suggest
ing that human land occupation
and agricultural production of an
area would beneficially alter the
precipitation and climate of that
same region. Ironically, the home
steaders' land, which is consid
ered to be the backbone of Amer
ican agriculture and produces 50
percent of the nation's fruits, veg
etables and nuts, is now known as
the "Arid Region."
"We face some really dire cir
cumstances when we look at the
water situation in the western
United States," said Andrew
Fahlund, executive director of the
Stanford project Water in the
West.
Water in the West, formed in
January 2010, is a joint program
by the Woods Institute for the En
vironment and the Bill Lane Cen
ter for the American West. It aims
to engage in research and policy
initiatives from various academic
disciplines in order to deliver so
lutions for the key water chal
lenges in the western United
States.
In particular, the program fo
cuses on three aspects: groundwa
ter management, water recycling
and water system sustainability.
Fahlund emphasized that he and
his partners are mobilizing all of
the relevant expertise at Stanford
to create an interdisciplinary look
at the pertinent issues.
"The quality of the engineering
department here, coupled with the
remarkable legal minds and the
economists ... then you bring in
people from the history depart
ment and from journalism, and all
of them have contributions to take
on a very complicated issue,"

Fahlund said.
Members of Water in the West
led a 2011 Sophomore College
class on a two-week, 225-mile trip
down the Colorado River in the
Grand Canyon in order to intro
duce undergraduates to the com
plexities of the water system in the
region.
The Colorado River supplies
water and power to over 25 mil
lion people in seven states, as well
as to parts of Mexico. The water is
supplied to a diverse range of peo
ple, from rural farmers to urban
ites in Los Angeles, and increasing
demand for this essential re
source, coupled with a decrease in
water volume, is causing major
conflicts.The river once ran all the
way through Mexico and out
through the Gulf of California but
now runs dry at many places. Ac
cording to a 2010 Smithsonian ar
ticle, the river is 130 feet lower
than it was in 2000.
Besides the effects of water
diversion from dams and irriga
tion, Fahlund stressed that the
dire situation of freshwater
ecosystems in California can be
traced to climate change. Snow
pack in California, a natural
water storage system, is expected
to decrease by as much as 80 per
cent over the next 50 years, and
groundwater is being pumped
out of the ground faster than it
can be replenished.
"Freshwater ecosystems across
the West are pretty stressed and
they are really at breaking point,
and up until recently they were
largely ignored," Fahlund said.
"You don't think about water
policy on a macroscopic level, and
you don't think about things like
[the fact] that L.A. only exists be
cause they have been swindling
water," said Andrea Acosta 'l4,
one of the 2011 Sophomore Col
lege participants.
"Being aware of these bureau
cratic policy fights and being on
the river and seeing the people
and places that policy actually af
fects made the ideas so much more

meaningful," she added.
While students of the Sopho
more College trip reflected that
they had fun learning to raft and
enjoyed being surrounded by the
dramatic landscape, many came
away with deep concerns about
the future of the water in the area.
