## The
						hermit of Jasper Ridge 
### â€” Amrita Rao 
Striding around under the fruit trees of his
terraced garden, Domenico Grosso, the
"hermit" of Jasper Ridge, was a familiar
figure to the first few generations of Stan
ford students. He lived beside an aban
doned mine shaft in a house he had built himself,
surrounded by a chicken coop and stables, an out
door picnic area for his many guests and an orna
mental stream with carefully tended plants.
"It's impossible to have a complete picture of life
as it used to be in the Portola Valley neighborhood
without knowing about one of its most intriguing
and colorful early inhabitants," said Nancy Lund, the
Portola Valley town historian. "His life is the stuff of
local legend."
Grosso, who lived in the Stanford-owned Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve in Portola Valley, Calif.,
was the area's unofficial guide. Especially after the
University opened in 1891, Grosso enjoyed the com
pany of many visitors. Hiking through maze of foot
trails he maintained throughout the hills was a pop
ular Sunday afternoon community pastime. Stan
ford students hiked the trails often, and even Jane
Stanford is reported to have dropped in on occasion.
Hospitable to the extreme, Grosso would sight visi
tors from afar and raise some combination of his
American, Italian, French and Chilean flags.
He offered visitors homemade wine, a vinegary
white for strangers and his best red for regulars. Also
renowned as an excellent cook, he would invite peo
ple over to "come on and eat a rabbit leg" as he put
it. His pickled miniature corn on the cob was a par
ticular favorite.
But if complimented on his cooking, Grosso
would brush it off by saying, "Julia did it." Or when
inviting friends over, he might say, "Don't bring the
Julia." If someone played music, he would mutter
something about Julia and ask that it stop. While no
one knows who Julia was, it is believed she was an
Italian sweetheart he left behind or who died short
ly before he left Italy.
All this could only come from speculation, how
ever, since Grosso was miserly with details of his
prior life. In an interview in 1952, well after Grosso's
1915 death, his friend Frank Bracesco revealed that
he had served as a soldier under Giuseppe Garibal
di and had been a valet to the Duke of Genoa.
Grosso was most likely born near Genoa, Italy, in
the 1830s. He came to America in 1869 and hinted
that he had spent time in Panama and mining in
Chile prior to reaching the continental United
States. He first worked for Hippolyte Belloc's bank
ing company and later for Nicholas Larco as a ranch
foreman. During this period, he is reputed to have
discovered silver in what is now Jasper Ridge, but he
claimed to have hidden the find by covering it with
brush and burning it.
In 1875, when Larco became bankrupt, Belloc
gave Grosso the prospecting rights to the land. He
immediately moved there and set up his elaborate
estate next to the 185-foot abandoned mine shaft in
which he hoped to find silver. When the Stanfords
purchased the property, they unsuccessfully tried to

evict Grosso, but with his prospecting right, he could
stay as long as he made attempts at mining.
For the rest of his life, Grosso would remain ob
sessed with the idea that someone was trying to take
the mine from him. He went to great lengths to con
vince people he had found large quantities of high
grade silver, although records indicate that he never
found anything worth more than one dollar per ton.
Accounts differ, however, and some insist that he
made a fortune.
"He kept mysterious bags under his house, which
he claimed contained ore of the same quality as that
in his display jars," Lund said. "About once a year,
he'd take the bags to Redwood City in a rented
buggy, presumably to cash them in."
It seems unlikely that the content of the bags
proved lucrative, since in his later days, after Belloc's
widow stopped providing him a pension the rea
sons behind her financial support of Grosso are am
biguous he basically lived off the generosity of
others, walking around with a sack in which he would
accept vegetables and other necessities.
He could not work the mine on his own and was
too suspicious of potential investors to ever open it
up again. Instead, he dug over 20 surface pits in the
hope of finding his elusive treasure.
In the spring of 1915, Gross suffered a stroke. He
was discovered in his bed by Ida Bracesco a few days
later. He died on May 18 in the San Mateo County
Hospital, at 85 to 90 years of age.
In 1923, the Stanford Mining Department re
opened the "Hermit Mine" to use as a practice mine.
By this time, most traces of Grosso's stay there had
disappeared, even his house. But his story captured
the interest of many students involved in the project.
Who was this gentlemanly recluse who spoke five
languages and kept up an impeccable appearance?
Did the lonely and mysterious figure, with a beard
down to his chest, ever actually make a "find?" What
kept him up at night, sweeping his maze of paths in
the moonlight?
The last official mention of the mine came in
1941, when the head of the mining department stat
ed that it had not been touched in years. Today, thick
hedges of poison oak guard the location of the mine,
taking on Domenico Grosso's legacy of protecting it
from opportunistic hands.
In addition to an interview with Nancy Lund, this in
formation was gathered from sources including
"The History of Jasper Ridge: From Searsville Pio
neers to Stanford Scientists" by Dorothy F. Regnery,
Volume 27 of the Stanford Illustrated Review in the
Stanford University Library Special Collections and
"The Hermit Mine" by Merle Marion Repass.
