## EDITORIAL The
						benefits of group projects 
### 
As students in classes as var
ied as PoliSci 1 and ME
101 know, group projects
are not unheard of at Stanford,
and it is quite common for stu
dents to complain about working
in groups. Having reached Stan
ford by succeeding as individuals,
the temptation and even prefer
ence to "just do the work yourself'
is a common one on campus. Nev
ertheless, group projects are ex
tremely valuable, both as a format
of applying academic knowledge
but also for the real-world learn
ing experience they provide. The
Editorial Board calls for Stanford
students and faculty to embrace
group projects as a valuable form
of learning, and to expand their
use in programs of study.
Group projects are useful be
cause they test students on more
than one level. Students, of
course, need to have a grasp of the
material that is applied in the
project itself, and they must un
derstand the format of the project
how to best organize a presen
tation or convey an argument in
an essay or build a functioning
model. They also, however, have
to understand how to work with
other people in the group. This
can often be positive, as it has
been shown that teaching others,
like fellow group members, is one
of the most rigorous ways of mas
tering new material. Similarly,
splitting up work means (in theo
ry) that each individual can do
their portion to a higher standard
than if they had to do the entire
project alone, and James
Surowiecki's book "The Wisdom
of Crowds" suggests that groups
often produce better decisions to
gether than any individual could
make. It can also be more con
tentious. Multiple group members
mean that responsibilities must be
delegated, and there are multiple
interests, varying work ethics, and
conflicting schedules to juggle, as
well.These difficulties are frustrat
ing and may well lead to lower
quality group work if members

don't cooperate successfully.
Above all, though, group proj
ects are what the "real world" is
like: Work in the real world
whether it be doing basic science
research in a lab, working on a po
litical campaign, producing a
computer program, or writing a
novel involves collaborating
with others to produce a finished
product. Even the dreaded
"group essay" is akin to real
world reports found in many
fields that are rarely written by
just one author. This collabora
tion involves some of the very
same pitfalls outlined above, and
it usually offers the same upsides
as well. Thus, having more group
projects in college allows students
to show that they have mastered
the material in the manner they
are likely to apply it post-gradua
tion. While the free rider problem
exists both in college and in the
real world, many professors in
clude a component that lets stu
dents grade their fellow group
members to mitigate it.
Some courses may seem to
lend themselves to group work
more than others. Even those dis
ciplines that seem less amenable
to group proj ects, however, should
and often do incorporate
more group work. A philosophy
class that requires students to pre
pare a debate, for example, or
more collaborative pieces in stu
dents' studio art portfolios, would
offer some of the same learning.
While the debate about the Uni
versity's role in educating students
in a "practical" manner as op
posed to educating for the sake of
expanding the intellect may go on
indeed, it has been raised in
several previous editorials
there is no doubt that almost all
students will have to function in
the professional world at some
point. To this end, departments
should utilize more group work in
their curricula because regardless
of which educational approach
you prefer, group projects have
clear benefits.
