# BURSTING THE BUBBLE

candy, everywhere. Just an

second floor (nunnery).
It's May at Stanford, and Greek
life has taken over the spring cal
endar. Pledge retreats at country
homes. Special dinners. Digging
moats at three in the morning.
I've never been fond of frater
nities at universities: too many sto
ries abound of alcohol poisoning,
hazing and even death. And sure,
alcohol and hazing exist here, but if
there's one Greek system that I
feel does a pretty good job, it's the
one here at Stanford.
It's not perfect, of course. There
was an awful lot of heartbreak a
month ago when sorority rush
ended many smiled broadly, an
nounced what sorority they were a
part of at brunch, and you could
just tell they were dying a little in
side. The same can probably be
said for fraternities, though I wit
nessed a lot less of it because
Sigma Chi tapped Burbank's en
tire third floor.
But a lot of it has worked out
since then. Some sorority sisters I
talked to admit that they weren't
too thrilled at first with their new
families, but more for lack of infor
mation than anything else
they've found camaraderie and
great pledge peers in their current
classes. Near-miss fraternity rejects
have gotten over their "we-like
you-but-not-enough" messages.
But it's not always rainbows
and lollipops. Some aren't happy
with their pledge classes, or even
with the system. And considering
they're going to be (and already
are) surrounded by those people
for a year, the best they're doing is

grinning and bearing it.
Fitting, because that seems to
be what a lot of rushees I know did
during their entire rush process
"man flirting," you could say. "It
was just so shallow," one told me,
"I'm so into this, that's so cool, so
nice to see you!" It seemed like
even the most prideful of men
were willing to for a couple
weeks at least parade them
selves and their talents in front of a
panel of upperclassmen.
And the looks on prospective
sorority sisters' faces when they
would come back from their
events! Clutching their blistered
ankles, rasping to me in hoarse voic
es. "We were in there for hours!"
