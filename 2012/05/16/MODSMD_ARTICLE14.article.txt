# BURSTING THE BUBBLE
## Get me to the Greek

Balloons, glitter and candy
candy, everywhere. Just an
other room on Burbank's
second floor (nunnery).
It's May at Stanford, and Greek
life has taken over the spring cal
endar. Pledge retreats at country
homes. Special dinners. Digging
moats at three in the morning.
I've never been fond of frater
nities at universities: too many sto
ries abound of alcohol poisoning,
hazing and even death. And sure,
alcohol and hazing exist here, but if
there's one Greek system that I
feel does a pretty good job, it's the
one here at Stanford.
It's not perfect, of course. There
was an awful lot of heartbreak a
month ago when sorority rush
ended many smiled broadly, an
nounced what sorority they were a
part of at brunch, and you could
just tell they were dying a little in
side. The same can probably be
said for fraternities, though I wit
nessed a lot less of it because
Sigma Chi tapped Burbank's en
tire third floor.
But a lot of it has worked out
since then. Some sorority sisters I
talked to admit that they weren't
too thrilled at first with their new
families, but more for lack of infor
mation than anything else
they've found camaraderie and
great pledge peers in their current
classes. Near-miss fraternity rejects
have gotten over their "we-like
you-but-not-enough" messages.
But it's not always rainbows
and lollipops. Some aren't happy
with their pledge classes, or even
with the system. And considering
they're going to be (and already
are) surrounded by those people
for a year, the best they're doing is

grinning and bearing it.
Fitting, because that seems to
be what a lot of rushees I know did
during their entire rush process
"man flirting," you could say. "It
was just so shallow," one told me,
"I'm so into this, that's so cool, so
nice to see you!" It seemed like
even the most prideful of men
were willing to for a couple
weeks at least parade them
selves and their talents in front of a
panel of upperclassmen.
And the looks on prospective
sorority sisters' faces when they
would come back from their
events! Clutching their blistered
ankles, rasping to me in hoarse voic
es. "We were in there for hours!"
one complained, describing a social

scene where women were sup
posed to sell themselves over loud
music.
And I will spare you the horror
of being with rushees at the Stan
ford Shopping Center, searching
desperately for a sundress for a
"rush event" the next day. As if
shopping weren't stressful
enough.
It's kind of a shame, really, if
it's true that lots of current
pledges had to sell themselves in
order to gain entry into a social
club. It would be an even greater
shame if they had to be someone
they're not after all, it's kind
of hard to fake it for a full year,
around people you will be forced
to live with.
Of course, this is all hearsay, be
cause I never bothered to look at
the fraternity scene, partially be
cause of the stigma of "Animal
House" and a couple damning
Rolling Stone articles.
But again, while it's not perfect,

Stanford does do a pretty good
job. People seem by and large
happy. There's a lot of PDA on
Facebook, on the sidewalks in
front of our dorm and at parties.
"Sister" and "brother" have be
come major parts of students'
identities in non-biological ways.
It sometimes makes me regret
not giving Greek life a shot.
But then again, how many of
our new happy Greek families are
just grinning and bearing it?
