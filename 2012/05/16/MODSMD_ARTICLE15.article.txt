# RAVALATIONS
## The
						Facebook fallacy 
### Ravali Reddy 
Every now and then, some
thing pops up in my Face
book newsfeed that really
catches my eye and occupies my
thoughts for a while. Last week it
was the video of the Harvard
baseball team dancing to "Call
Me Maybe" in the car (the guy
sleeping in the back seat is my fa
vorite), and on Sunday it was the
article from The New York Times
Magazine that was titled "Can
You Call a 9-Year-Old a Psy
chopath?" an unnerving and well
written piece. The other day, how
ever, it was actually someone's
Facebook status that caught my
eye.
One of my Facebook friends
had written a status that read,
"Just finished cleaning out my
Facebook friends list. If you're
reading this status, then congratu
lations, you made the cut!" It had
garnered over 30 likes and got me
thinking: how does one go about a
Facebook cleanse?
The first step is obvious: going
through your current friends list
and unfriending those who you
don't know in real life al
though, to be fair, I don't know
why anyone would add those peo
ple as friends in the first place. The
next thing would be to delete
those individuals you have only
met once or twice. Easy enough.
But then what happens next? Do
you start with the people you
knew in high school but no longer
talk to? What about old co-work
ers? And how about that one girl
you once worked on an IHUM
project with, because your TF
paired you up, but haven't talked
to since? Does she deserve to sur
vive your purge?
A late night discussion with
some friends led to some interest
ing thoughts on the topic. One
friend of mine insists on keeping
his friend list limited to about 200

people. He believes that that
number represents the amount of
people he actively interacts with
at any given time. He argued that
he knows he doesn't need to
delete anyone, and that he knows
this because he feels comfortable
writing on the walls of any one of
his friends, and has done so at
some point or another.
Another friend, who has over
1,000 Facebook friends, told me
that she is completely comfort
able with her social network. Ac
cording to her, you never know
when those old connections might
come in handy, and her only stipu
lation is that she only adds indi
viduals she has met in real life
(well, that and she refuses to add
her parents). She insists that she
doesn't put anything up on Face
book that she has a problem with
anyone seeing, so it doesn't make
a difference to her.
In addition to the act of cleans
ing, there's also the question of
how to deal with the aftermath of
deleting a Facebook friend. If you
choose to delete people you once
knew in high school, what hap
pens when you run into them back
home during breaks? One person
argued that you merely smile and
gesture hello, but that there's no
need for further acknowledge
ment. "After all," my friend ar
gued, "if she wanted me to know
about her life in college, she
would have stayed my Facebook
friend." The fact that she was of
fended by the deletion wasn't
masked very well.
Now, even though I gave my
friend a sympathetic smile at the
time, her words led me to an en
tirely different realization: people
take Facebook way too seriously
nowadays. We are all aware that
Facebook is not real life, yet the
idea that things need to be made
"Facebook official" appears to

have consumed our generation.
We feel the need to wish people
we would never wish in real life a
"Happy Birthday" because the
site tells us to; we share our rela
tionship statuses with the world,
regardless of whether we're shar
ing information about a hook-up
or a breakup, and we get offended
when we get unfriended. I'm as
guilty of it as everyone else is, but
it's important to remember that
our Facebook friendships don't
validate our real ones. At the end
of the day, Facebook is nothing
more than a public forum where
some people choose to share tid
bits of their life and others choose
to share the "Call Me Maybe"
music video, and taking some
thing like that seriously may be as
ridiculous as the aforementioned
music video.
