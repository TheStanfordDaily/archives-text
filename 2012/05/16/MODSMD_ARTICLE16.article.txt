## Tony Blair is a war criminal 
### PETER MCDONALD '11 Occupier of Meyer Library 
If tomorrow it were announced
that Charles Manson was being
released from prison and that
he had a really interesting theory
on sustainable agriculture and
wanted to come to campus to dis
cuss it, what would your reaction
be? Some of the freest of thinkers
might want to hear what he had to
say. Most would think it's kind of
messed up, arguing even if it is an
interesting theory on sustainable
agriculture, Stanford should not be
bringing convicted murderers to
campus, out of some sense of prin
ciple. Arguing from that sense of
principle then, I guess the only dif
ference between the described sce
nario and Tony Blair's arrival on
campus is that Tony Blair hasn't
been convicted yet.
By all accounts, Tony Blair
seems like a nice guy, your arche
typal lovable Brit. Charles Manson
is a lot more scowly. However,
Blair's also a lovable Brit who just
so happened to wage an illegal war.
That's not really a matter of philos
ophy, of whether or not you were
for or against the Iraq War. An
opinion by George Monbiot pub
lished in The Guardian on January
25,2010, reads:
"Under the United Nations
Charter, two conditions must be
met before a war can legally be
waged. The parties to a dispute
must first 'seek a solution by nego
tiation' (article 33). They can take
up arms without an explicit man
date from the U.N. Security Coun
cil only 'if an armed attack occurs
against [them]' (article 51). Neither

of these conditions applied. The
U.S. and U.K. governments reject
ed Iraq's attempts to negotiate. At
one point the U.S. State Depart
ment even announced that it would
'go into thwart mode' to prevent
the Iraqis from resuming talks on
weapons inspection (all references
are on my website). Iraq had
launched no armed attack against
either nation.
"We also know that the U.K.
government was aware that the
war it intended to launch was ille
gal. In March 2002, the Cabinet Of
fice explained that 'a legal justifica
tion for invasion would be needed.
Subject to law officers' advice,
none currently exists.' In July 2002,
Lord Goldsmith, the attorney gen
eral, told the prime minister that
there were only 'three possible
legal bases' for launching a war
'self-defence, humanitarian inter
vention or UNSC [security council]
authorisation. The first and second
could not be the base in this case.'
Bush and Blair later failed to ob
tain Security Council authorisa
tion."
Kofi Annan said the same thing
in 2004 in an interview with the
BBC: "I have indicated it was not in
conformity with the U.N. Charter
from our point of view, from the
charter point of view, it was illegal."
Without legal justification for
the Iraq War, Tony Blair is implicat
ed in the death of over 1,000,000
Iraqis and the displacement of
2,000,000 more. Just because he
was elected by Parliament or
speaks English or doesn't dress in

crazy military garb or is white does
n't mean that he didn't commit a
crime in waging the Iraq War with
out U.N. Security Council ap
proval. The brutality of Saddam
Hussein's regime is irrelevant to
this fact.
If you're one of those people
who thinks "Yeah, but it's interna
tional law. You can't enforce it. Why
does it matter?" I want you to take
a second and think about how silly
that sounds. Every member of the
U.N. agreed to the charter when it
was formed. We're supposed to be
grown-ups here. When dealing with
international affairs, when dealing
with the prospect of invading coun
tries, a snotty "You and what army"
attitude a la Black Bush is not only
not helpful, it frankly has no place
in the thought process of anyone
who considers him/her/perself a
global citizen. International law is
in fact law, and it needs to be re
spected. I mean, you do want world
peace, right?
What Tony Blair is on campus to
talk about, the African Gover
nance Initiative, is also problemat
ic, what with him being the former
prime minister of what still techni
cally is an empire. I hope he faces
questions about the implications of
developing a foundation whose
goal in part seems to be asserting
de facto control of African govern
ments, but the politics of the AGI
aside, Tony Blair is still a war crimi
nal.
