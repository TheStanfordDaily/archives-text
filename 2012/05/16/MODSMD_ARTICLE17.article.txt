## Preserve Oakland's finest 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Five years ago, if I had
made a list of the top
American cities in which
I would least like to run
out of gas, Oakland may
have taken the cake. I really knew
nothing about the 510, other than
that people from the Peninsula
mocked it and that it was home to
world-class rioters and high mur
der rates.
Then I met my girlfriend who
resides in the East Bay, took a few
classes that pulled my head out of
the suburban Florida sand I had
been stuck in for 18 years and slow
ly grew more comfortable making
the trip over the Dumbarton
Bridge and into one of the more
undervalued multicultural hubs in
the country.
Like any major city, Oakland has
its flaws, but its infamous reputation
has far exceeded reality. It's home to
things like gorgeous hiking trails
and incredible places to eat, and
having now driven though "the
town" several times at night, it's
comical to think I was once afraid to
park my car at any BART station.
In fact, the East Bay now feels a
bit like a third home. As a displaced
sports fan begging for a fresh start
with a few unconventional teams,
it's no surprise that Oakland's finest
stood out. For the past couple of
years, I've been loyal to the War
riors, Athletics and Raiders, but it's
been a difficult adjustment. These
teams play in venues that are a far
cry from the state-of-the-art
Amway Center, the playing

grounds of my hometown Orlando
Magic. They're not franchises you
look to as models of effective man
agement. And, most importantly,
these aren't bandwagons you hop
aboard if you enjoy winning.
Never have I left a game in Oak
land feeling as if a championship
were on the horizon. I once saw Le-
Bron James hit the first game-win
ner of his career, naturally against
the Warriors, and that sort of other
team-moment has been all too fre
quent. Games are often attended to
watch opposing players compete,
and I've seen cheers for losses that
improve draft position.
But 1 keep coming back, because
there is something endearing about
the cluster of stadiums directly off
the 880, and something endearing
about the people who migrate to
them that is tough to put into words.
Oakland fans are among the most
passionate and intelligent in the
world. That may be a hard pill to
swallow when A's games are regu
larly filled by fewer people than at
tended my senior prom, and Raider
Nation routinely dresses like a
group of teenagers headed to a
gothic Halloween party.
It's fair skepticism, but the regu
lars are more connected to their
teams than just about any other fan
base I've witnessed, and it is some
thing that needs to be experienced
in order to be understood. (As a
bonus, parking is free and abundant
at the Coliseum BART station.
Good luck finding that at any other
stadium in the country.)
Oakland's teams, regardless of
their recent history, are immensely
valuable to a struggling city. How
ever, they're at risk of fleeing in the
very near future. The Warriors are
being actively enticed by city lead

ers in San Francisco to move back
across the Bay to their previous
home. The much-maligned
Raiders have been rumored to be
leaving the Coliseum again, this
time for a potential stadium-share
with the cross-town San Francisco
49ers. And the As, the beloved
princes of the Moneyball era, have
been mentioned in connection
with places like Fremont and San
Jose. Woof.
I'd be devastated to see any of
the three depart, but my personal
hurt would be nothing compared to
Oakland's. Mayor Jean Quan has
suggested the possibility of building
a sports wonderland in place of the
current relics, allegedly with private
funding, but the Warriors have a
better chance at a championship
than that happening in the near fu
ture. Different markets would un
doubtedly garner more money and
support, but it would kill one of
America's best sports cities.
So much of the hurry for reloca
tion stems from outside pressures
that see Oakland in the way that I
used to see it. Sports are big busi
ness, I understand that, but there are
ways to at least sustain the franchis
es without shipping them away to
less deserving places. The city will
never rival L.A., New York and
Chicago in terms of financial poten
tial, but knowledgeable and pro
ductive leadership can at least set
things in the right direction.
The moral of the story is that
things aren't always as they seem.
The Warriors, Athletics and Raiders
are not second-rate organizations in
a second-rate city. Oakland doesn't
need to go under the knife; it just
needs a little makeup.

Considering that he drives the most
stolen car in America, maybe Zach
Zimmerman should reconsider
leaving his Camry at BART. Send
