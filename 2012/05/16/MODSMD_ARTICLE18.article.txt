# DOWN WITH THE DONS
## 
### PALANI ESWARAN STAFF WRITER 
On Tuesday night, the No. 17
Stanford baseball team came
from behind to beat the Universi
ty of San Francisco, 6-3. Flowever,
it was an up-and-down night for
the Cardinal, which was outhit by
the Dons and left 11 men on base,
despite the win.
Stanford (33-14,14-10 Pac-12)

has now won its last four contests,
while the Dons, who recorded a
sweep over Santa Clara last
weekend, fall to 27-29 overall (12-
9 West Coast Conference). Fresh
man David Schmidt, the winning
pitcher for Stanford, improved to
3-1 on the season.
Offensively, Stanford got off
to a fast start. In the first inning,
junior centerfielder Jake Stewart
reached on an error, and the next

batter, junior leftfielder Tyler
Gaffney, walked. Junior third
baseman Stephen Piscotty's base
hit loaded the bases with no outs
for first baseman Brian Ragira.
Ragira struck out swinging,
but the third strike was a wild
pitch and Stewart dashed home
to score the first run of the day.
San Francisco sophomore starter
Jordan Remer settled down, lim
iting the damage to one run. The
bottom of the second was similar
for the Cardinal, with freshman
catcher Wayne Taylor left strand
ed in scoring position and the
score remaining at 1-0.
In the third inning, San Fran
cisco's offense came to life.
Freshman rightfielder Bradley
Zimmer led off the inning with a
single, and two batters later, jun
ior second baseman Jason Ma
hood hit a towering home run to
left field that put the Dons up 2-
1. The next batter, senior first
baseman Nik Balog, singled to
left. Starter Garrett Hughes, who
was having trouble keeping the
ball down in the strike zone, was
relieved by junior Sahil Bloom,
and he escaped the inning without
giving up any more runs.
In the bottom of the third,
Remer walked Gaffney and Pis
cotty, putting men on first and sec
ond with no outs. Remer was re
placed by junior Andrew Pulido,
who promptly struck out Ragira
and sophomore rightfielder
Austin Wilson.
In the top of the fourth, Dons
leftfielder Tom Barry hit a solo
home run that stretched the San
Francisco lead to 3-1.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal of
fense continued to sputter. In the
bottom of the fifth, a bunt single
by Gaffney, a hit by Ragira and
Wilson getting hit by a pitch
loaded the bases for freshman
second baseman Alex Blandino.
But Blandino struck out, and once
again the Cardinal left runners on
base.
In the top of the sixth, reliever
Dean McArdle remained stellar,
striking out the side, and the bot

torn of the inning finally seemed
to spark the Cardinal offense.
Freshman designated hitter Do
minic Jose hit a fly ball to center
field, where San Francisco center
fielder Justin Maffei laid out in an
attempt to make the catch. It was
difficult to tell whether the ball hit
the ground, but the umpire ruled
that Jose was not out, and he
ended up with a triple. Sopho
more Brett Michael Doran came
in as a pinch hitter and drove Jose
home, cutting the Dons' lead to
one run.
Schmidt relieved McArdle in
the seventh inning, and despite a
fluke single by Maffei and an
error by Blandino, he left the in
ning unscathed. The bottom half
of the seventh was uneventful for
the Stanford offense as reliever
Haden Hinkle retired the side in
order.
After a great eighth by
Schmidt, the Stanford bats finally
exploded. To lead off the inning,
Blandino was hit by a pitch. Jun
ior Elliott Waterman then came
in to relieve Hinkle and quickly
gave up a walk to Jose. Next up
was junior Eric Smith, who had
come into the game at catcher the
inning before. Smith hit a boom
ing double to right field that drove
in Blandino.
"Coming off the bench is al
ways tough," Smith said. "I just
wanted to look for a pitch early in
the count that I could hit, and luck
ily it stayed fair."
After an intentional walk to
Stewart to load the bases, Gaffney
drew a walk to put Stanford up 4-
3. Piscotty then hit a sacrifice fly,
followed by a double by Ragira,
and the Cardinal had a comfort
able three-run lead. In the top of
the ninth, sophomore closer A.J.
Vanegas struck out three batters
to secure the win.
This weekend Stanford will
travel to Salt Lake City to take on
Utah in a three-game series, start
ing Friday at 5 p.m. PDT.

to a fast start. In the first inning,
junior centerfielder Jake Stewart
reached on an error, and the next

batter, junior leftfielder Tyler
Gaffney, walked. Junior third
baseman Stephen Piscotty's base
hit loaded the bases with no outs
for first baseman Brian Ragira.
Ragira struck out swinging,
but the third strike was a wild
pitch and Stewart dashed home
to score the first run of the day.
San Francisco sophomore starter
Jordan Remer settled down, lim
iting the damage to one run. The
bottom of the second was similar
for the Cardinal, with freshman
catcher Wayne Taylor left strand
ed in scoring position and the
score remaining at 1-0.
In the third inning, San Fran
cisco's offense came to life.
Freshman rightfielder Bradley
Zimmer led off the inning with a
single, and two batters later, jun
ior second baseman Jason Ma
hood hit a towering home run to
left field that put the Dons up 2-
1. The next batter, senior first
baseman Nik Balog, singled to
left. Starter Garrett Hughes, who
was having trouble keeping the
ball down in the strike zone, was
relieved by junior Sahil Bloom,
and he escaped the inning without
giving up any more runs.
In the bottom of the third,
Remer walked Gaffney and Pis
cotty, putting men on first and sec
ond with no outs. Remer was re
placed by junior Andrew Pulido,
who promptly struck out Ragira
and sophomore rightfielder
Austin Wilson.
In the top of the fourth, Dons
leftfielder Tom Barry hit a solo
home run that stretched the San
Francisco lead to 3-1.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal of
fense continued to sputter. In the
bottom of the fifth, a bunt single
by Gaffney, a hit by Ragira and
Wilson getting hit by a pitch
loaded the bases for freshman
second baseman Alex Blandino.
But Blandino struck out, and once
again the Cardinal left runners on
base.
In the top of the sixth, reliever
Dean McArdle remained stellar,
striking out the side, and the bot

torn of the inning finally seemed
to spark the Cardinal offense.
Freshman designated hitter Do
minic Jose hit a fly ball to center
field, where San Francisco center
fielder Justin Maffei laid out in an
attempt to make the catch. It was
difficult to tell whether the ball hit
the ground, but the umpire ruled
that Jose was not out, and he
ended up with a triple. Sopho
more Brett Michael Doran came
in as a pinch hitter and drove Jose
home, cutting the Dons' lead to
one run.
Schmidt relieved McArdle in
the seventh inning, and despite a
fluke single by Maffei and an
error by Blandino, he left the in
ning unscathed. The bottom half
of the seventh was uneventful for
the Stanford offense as reliever
Haden Hinkle retired the side in
order.
After a great eighth by
Schmidt, the Stanford bats finally
exploded. To lead off the inning,
Blandino was hit by a pitch. Jun
ior Elliott Waterman then came
in to relieve Hinkle and quickly
gave up a walk to Jose. Next up
was junior Eric Smith, who had
come into the game at catcher the
inning before. Smith hit a boom
ing double to right field that drove
in Blandino.
"Coming off the bench is al
ways tough," Smith said. "I just
wanted to look for a pitch early in
the count that I could hit, and luck
ily it stayed fair."
After an intentional walk to
Stewart to load the bases, Gaffney
drew a walk to put Stanford up 4-
3. Piscotty then hit a sacrifice fly,
followed by a double by Ragira,
and the Cardinal had a comfort
able three-run lead. In the top of
the ninth, sophomore closer A.J.
Vanegas struck out three batters
to secure the win.
This weekend Stanford will
travel to Salt Lake City to take on
Utah in a three-game series, start
ing Friday at 5 p.m. PDT.
