# TRACK & FIELD
## Women second, men fifth at Pac-12s 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
Five individual titles highlighted
a successful trip to the Pac-12 Cham
pionships for the Stanford track and
field teams. The women placed sec
ond while the men tied for fifth, as
host Oregon swept both titles.
Freshman Brianna Bain got
things going for the women's team
on Saturday, winning the Pac-12
title in the javelin. Bain's final
throw of 53.58 meters was good
enough for both the title and a new
Stanford record.
Success in the field continued
on Sunday, when senior Katerina
Stefanidi won the pole vault for the
second straight year. Her vault of
4.48 meters broke her own Stan
ford record and was just two cen
timeters short of the Olympic "A"
standard that Stefanidi is seeking in
order to represent her home coun
try of Greece in the London
Olympics.
In other field events, redshirt
senior Arantxa King and junior
Karynn Dunn placed second and
third, respectively, in the long jump.
King's first jump of 6.42 meters was
the best in the field until Arizona
State's Constance Ezugha edged
her by three centimeters on her
final jump. King added a third
place finish in the triple jump, while
junior Alyssa Wisdom placed third
in the hammer throw.
On the track, sophomore Kori
Carter rounded out the individual
wins on the women's side with a
victory in the 100-meter hurdles.
Carter narrowly edged out class
mate Katie Nelms, 12.99 seconds to
13.01, and both were far better than
the previous Stanford record of
13.13, which was also set by Carter.
Carter and Nelms also con
tributed to a third-place finish in
the 4xloo-meter relay. Redshirt
senior Shataya Hendricks and jun
ior Carissa Levingston ran the ad
ditional two legs to help the team
put up a 44.25, good for the second
fastest time in Stanford history.
Hendricks also placed third in the
100 and sixth in the 200. Junior
Kathy Kroeger had the best finish
in the distances, placing second in
the 5,000.
Meanwhile, the individual win
ners on the men's side were no
strangers to success in big meets, as

seniors Amaechi Morton and Chris
Derrick both added a Pac-12 title
to their trophy cases.
Morton won the 400-meter hur
dles with the sixth-fastest time in
the world this year. His 48.95
missed his own school record by
just one-hundredth of a second, but
it was enough for the Olympic "A"
standard. Along with his first Pac
-12 title, Morton added a second
place finish in the 110-meter hur
dles to account for 18 of the team's
78 total points.

Derrick started out his Sunday
with a close runner-up finish be
hind Arizona's Lawi Lalang in the
1,500. Lalang and Derrick also fin
ished 1-2 at the NCAA Cross
Country Championships and both
the 3,000 and 5,000 at the NCAA
Indoor Championships earlier this
year. Derrick broke through later
on Sunday, though, edging out
Lalang and his teammate Stephen
Sambu to win the 5,000. The win
was Derrick's second career title in
the event and third overall.
"It was a really good day," Der
rick said. "For the 1,500,1 would
have liked to have won, but I got
boxed in a little early. I closed fast,
which I was happy with, but I just
couldn't catch [Lalang].The 5k was
a slugfest. It was a really tough race,
and Sambu was the one pushing
the pace. With a mile or 2k to go, I
noticed Lawi hurting, and I had
never seen him struggling. There
was a lot of lead-trading, and I was
trying to keep up the pressure to fi
nally beat the guy that had beaten
me before. We were all wiped after
ward, but I was pleased to come out
on top."
Other top finishers for the men
were senior Benjamin Johnson,

We needed a
big meet to
breakthrough.
CHRIS DERRICK
who placed third in the 3,000-
meter steeplechase, and redshirt
junior Geoffrey Tabor, who placed
third in the shot put. Tabor fouled
in every attempt at the discus,
though, so he was unable to repeat
his 2011 title.
Overall, the men were disap
pointed with their team finish.
"We weren't too happy with
that," Derrick said. "We're at that
level as a team where we're in a
pack of quality teams and we
needed a big meet to break
through. We had some good per
formances, but not enough. We
know we're built more for
NCAAs, though, so we're looking
forward to that."
Next up for the track and field
teams is the NCAA Regional in
Austin, Texas, on May 24-26. The
NCAA Championships will fol
low two weeks later in Des
Moines, lowa.
