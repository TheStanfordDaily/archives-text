# Transfer class cut by nearly half to compensate for high yield rate

Thirty-three transfer students
received offers of admission this
year out of a pool of more than
1,500 applicants, according to Assis
tant Director of Admission Kate
Shreve. This year's 2.2 percent ac
ceptance rate is nearly half of last
year's 4.1 percent rate, when 58 of
about 1,400 applicants were admit
ted.
"We reduced the transfer admit
target by 20 given the higher than
expected freshman matriculation]
rate," wrote Richard Shaw, dean of
undergraduate admission and fi
nancial aid, in an email to The Daily.
According to Shaw, 17 of the
transfer students are from commu

nity colleges, while 11 are from four
year universities and five are inter
national.
"We did see an increase in the
number of applications for transfer
admission this year," Shreve said.
"However, due to the diverse na
ture of the transfer applicant pool
and its relatively small size, it is diffi
cult to characterize the pool as a
whole and to describe how it differs
from year to year."
Nonetheless, Shreve said she
thinks transfer students differ from
students admitted during regular
admissions in some ways.
"While we do seek many of the
same qualities in transfer students
as in freshmen, [such as] a strong ac
ademic record and intellectual vi
tality, there are also some differ

ences," Shreve said. "With transfers,
we look for students who are aca
demically mature and prepared to
jump into Stanford's rigorous cur
riculum mid-stream. We also have a
strong commitment to our U.S.
Armed Services Veterans and to
students with non-traditional edu
cational backgrounds."
Shaw added that the transfers
are "a different population with dif
ferent kinds of experiences and per
spectives. We believe the transfer
perspective does add to the am
biance of the campus and in the
classroom."
Transfers bring various unique
backgrounds that diverge from
those of the typical Stanford stu
dent who comes to campus directly
after high school. For example,

Emma Wood 'l4 transferred last
year from Williams College after
also spending a year in Italy and Ar
gentina.
This time was not only produc
tive for academic growth, she said,
but was also away to develop her
passion for food, wine and tango
dancing.
Even though not all transfer stu
dents belong to the same graduat
ing class, they still form their own
sense of community, Wood said.
Transfers participate in their
own version of New Student Orien
tation, and this year, most transfer
students live in Kimball Hall or
Paloma in Florence Moore Hall,
making it easier for transfers to
