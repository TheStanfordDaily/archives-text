# Transfer class cut by nearly half to compensate for high yield rate
## 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Thirty-three transfer students
received offers of admission this
year out of a pool of more than
1,500 applicants, according to Assis
tant Director of Admission Kate
Shreve. This year's 2.2 percent ac
ceptance rate is nearly half of last
year's 4.1 percent rate, when 58 of
about 1,400 applicants were admit
ted.
"We reduced the transfer admit
target by 20 given the higher than
expected freshman matriculation]
rate," wrote Richard Shaw, dean of
undergraduate admission and fi
nancial aid, in an email to The Daily.
According to Shaw, 17 of the
transfer students are from commu

nity colleges, while 11 are from four
year universities and five are inter
national.
"We did see an increase in the
number of applications for transfer
admission this year," Shreve said.
"However, due to the diverse na
ture of the transfer applicant pool
and its relatively small size, it is diffi
cult to characterize the pool as a
whole and to describe how it differs
from year to year."
Nonetheless, Shreve said she
thinks transfer students differ from
students admitted during regular
admissions in some ways.
"While we do seek many of the
same qualities in transfer students
as in freshmen, [such as] a strong ac
ademic record and intellectual vi
tality, there are also some differ

ences," Shreve said. "With transfers,
we look for students who are aca
demically mature and prepared to
jump into Stanford's rigorous cur
riculum mid-stream. We also have a
strong commitment to our U.S.
Armed Services Veterans and to
students with non-traditional edu
cational backgrounds."
Shaw added that the transfers
are "a different population with dif
ferent kinds of experiences and per
spectives. We believe the transfer
perspective does add to the am
biance of the campus and in the
classroom."
Transfers bring various unique
backgrounds that diverge from
those of the typical Stanford stu
dent who comes to campus directly
after high school. For example,

Emma Wood 'l4 transferred last
year from Williams College after
also spending a year in Italy and Ar
gentina.
This time was not only produc
tive for academic growth, she said,
but was also away to develop her
passion for food, wine and tango
dancing.
Even though not all transfer stu
dents belong to the same graduat
ing class, they still form their own
sense of community, Wood said.
Transfers participate in their
own version of New Student Orien
tation, and this year, most transfer
students live in Kimball Hall or
Paloma in Florence Moore Hall,
making it easier for transfers to
(NSO) program on bicycle edu
cation for freshmen, free bike
safety classes offered twice a
month for the entire campus
community and a bike safety
web page. Additionally, the pro
gram tries to increase helmet
usage by collaborating with
P&TS to offer discounted hel
mets.
Despite these resources,
much of the campus continues to
bike without helmets, and when
a collision does occur, accident
protocol can get hazy.
Last month, a fellow in the
Stanford Department of Pathol
ogy, Ellen Yeh, was crossing the
street as a pedestrian between
Serra Mall and the Main Quad
when a bicyclist hit her.
"I saw him coming really fast,
stopped to let him pass," Yeh
said. "He swerved into me from
the front, and I fell onto my back.
Both my arms hit the ground."
A witness had called 911, but
Yeh refused the ambulance, as
she "didn't suspect bad injury."
Yeh reports that the bicyclist
was "unapologetic" and claimed
that he had the right of way.
According to Scott, bikers
should yield to pedestrians on
shared paths.
Upon noticing swelling and
pain in her arms, Yeh went to the
ER, where she was informed of

three fractures in her arms, two
in the left arm and one in the
right.
"You can get really hurt by
getting hit by a bicyclist," Yeh
said. "It's not trivial it's dan
gerous."
Yeh said her injuries have
compromised her ability to per
form daily functions, as well as
caused her to postpone her med
ical research trip to Thailand.
"There's a hazy part to being
hit by a bicyclist rather than a
car," Yeh said, in reference to dif
ficulties in contacting the biker
who hit her and the reluctance of
police to get involved.
"The police say there's no
reason for them to be involved,
and I can't force him [the biker]
to talk to me," Yeh said.
"I just want him to realize his
speed, safety and be somewhat
compassionate ... which is hard
to achieve with a bike accident
apparently," she added.
To reduce accidents in the fu
ture, bicyclists must "get in the
mindset that they are 'driving,'"
Scott said. "They should be pre
dictable and visible. Bicyclists
should be 100 percent focused on
riding their bike."
Finally, to reduce the trauma
associated with said accidents,
Norris encouraged helmet usage.
"I've seen too many young
adults cut off in the prime of life
for not having a helmet," Norris
said.

ture, bicyclists must "get in the
mindset that they are 'driving,'"
Scott said. "They should be pre
dictable and visible. Bicyclists
should be 100 percent focused on
riding their bike."
Finally, to reduce the trauma
associated with said accidents,
Norris encouraged helmet usage.
"I've seen too many young
adults cut off in the prime of life
for not having a helmet," Norris
said.

Thirty-three transfer students
received offers of admission this
year out of a pool of more than
1,500 applicants, according to Assis
tant Director of Admission Kate
Shreve. This year's 2.2 percent ac
ceptance rate is nearly half of last
year's 4.1 percent rate, when 58 of
about 1,400 applicants were admit
ted.
"We reduced the transfer admit
target by 20 given the higher than
expected freshman matriculation]
rate," wrote Richard Shaw, dean of
undergraduate admission and fi
nancial aid, in an email to The Daily.
According to Shaw, 17 of the
transfer students are from commu

nity colleges, while 11 are from four
year universities and five are inter
national.
"We did see an increase in the
number of applications for transfer
admission this year," Shreve said.
"However, due to the diverse na
ture of the transfer applicant pool
and its relatively small size, it is diffi
cult to characterize the pool as a
whole and to describe how it differs
from year to year."
Nonetheless, Shreve said she
thinks transfer students differ from
students admitted during regular
admissions in some ways.
"While we do seek many of the
same qualities in transfer students
as in freshmen, [such as] a strong ac
ademic record and intellectual vi
tality, there are also some differ

ences," Shreve said. "With transfers,
we look for students who are aca
demically mature and prepared to
jump into Stanford's rigorous cur
riculum mid-stream. We also have a
strong commitment to our U.S.
Armed Services Veterans and to
students with non-traditional edu
cational backgrounds."
Shaw added that the transfers
are "a different population with dif
ferent kinds of experiences and per
spectives. We believe the transfer
perspective does add to the am
biance of the campus and in the
classroom."
Transfers bring various unique
backgrounds that diverge from
those of the typical Stanford stu
dent who comes to campus directly
after high school. For example,

Emma Wood 'l4 transferred last
year from Williams College after
also spending a year in Italy and Ar
gentina.
This time was not only produc
tive for academic growth, she said,
but was also away to develop her
passion for food, wine and tango
dancing.
Even though not all transfer stu
dents belong to the same graduat
ing class, they still form their own
sense of community, Wood said.
Transfers participate in their
own version of New Student Orien
tation, and this year, most transfer
students live in Kimball Hall or
Paloma in Florence Moore Hall,
making it easier for transfers to
(NSO) program on bicycle edu
cation for freshmen, free bike
safety classes offered twice a
month for the entire campus
community and a bike safety
web page. Additionally, the pro
gram tries to increase helmet
usage by collaborating with
P&TS to offer discounted hel
mets.
Despite these resources,
much of the campus continues to
bike without helmets, and when
a collision does occur, accident
protocol can get hazy.
Last month, a fellow in the
Stanford Department of Pathol
ogy, Ellen Yeh, was crossing the
street as a pedestrian between
Serra Mall and the Main Quad
when a bicyclist hit her.
"I saw him coming really fast,
stopped to let him pass," Yeh
said. "He swerved into me from
the front, and I fell onto my back.
Both my arms hit the ground."
A witness had called 911, but
Yeh refused the ambulance, as
she "didn't suspect bad injury."
Yeh reports that the bicyclist
was "unapologetic" and claimed
that he had the right of way.
According to Scott, bikers
should yield to pedestrians on
shared paths.
Upon noticing swelling and
pain in her arms, Yeh went to the
ER, where she was informed of

three fractures in her arms, two
in the left arm and one in the
right.
"You can get really hurt by
getting hit by a bicyclist," Yeh
said. "It's not trivial it's dan
gerous."
Yeh said her injuries have
compromised her ability to per
form daily functions, as well as
caused her to postpone her med
ical research trip to Thailand.
"There's a hazy part to being
hit by a bicyclist rather than a
car," Yeh said, in reference to dif
ficulties in contacting the biker
who hit her and the reluctance of
police to get involved.
"The police say there's no
reason for them to be involved,
and I can't force him [the biker]
to talk to me," Yeh said.
"I just want him to realize his
speed, safety and be somewhat
compassionate ... which is hard
to achieve with a bike accident
apparently," she added.

ture, bicyclists must "get in the
