## Bike crash highlights helmet use Freshman life saved by bike helmet, ED chief says 
### ERIN INMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Bicycle Program, in
conjunction with the Department
of Public Safety, is working to im
prove traffic control and conges
tion on campus by installing bike
specific stop signs and riding
guidelines on the roads. Two re
cent bicycle-related accidents,
however, contribute to this exist
ing call for increased focus on
biker safety and responsibility,
according to those involved.
Stanford undergraduate
Anna Polishchuk 'l5 was hit
broadside by a car while biking
on Monday, May 7. Polishchuk
hit the windshield of the car,
which was going about 10 miles
per hour through an intersection
by Florence Moore (FloMo)
Hall. She was thrown uncon
scious two car lengths away into
the bushes.
"I was biking home from the
dining hall, and then I find myself
waking up on the ground," Pol
ishchuk said.
Despite the severity of her
crash, Polischuk escaped with
minor injuries because she was
wearing a helmet.
Stanford undergraduates are
notorious for not wearing hel
mets, and this reputation has not
gone unnoticed by Stanford hos
pital's emergency department
(ED), according to Robert Nor
ris, the ED doctor who treated
Polischuk.
"I told her she could not be a
Stanford undergrad because she
was actually wearing a helmet,"
Norris said.
Polishchuk heard similar com
ments from more of the ED staff.
"I was shocked by their shock
at my wearing a helmet," Pol
ishchuk said. "It was unsettling
how amazed they were."
Norris commented on the
value of wearing a helmet.
"This $2O investment [the hel
met] saved her life. Period," Nor
ris said. "Without the helmet
there's no doubt in my mind that
she would have been an organ
donor or dead upon arrival."
The University has been try
ing to fight the stigma behind
wearing helmets.
According to Ariadne Scott,
bicycle program coordinator, the
Bicycle Program under the
umbrella of Parking and Trans
portation Services (P&TS)
continues to offer resources such
as a New Student Orientation
Brown is the 2012 Lee Kong
Chian National University of Sin
gapore (NUS)-Stanford Distin
guished Fellow at Stanford. The
fellowship is awarded to one
scholar annually to conduct re
search at both Stanford and NUS
for up to six months.
During his talk, Brown warned
against legitimizing or misinter
preting the goals of certain groups
of separatists, citing the Filipino
group Abu Sayyaf, which he calls
"pirates and war profiteers."
He emphasized the need to dis
tinguish between greed and griev
ance as causes for conflicts.
"Many times conflicts are not
really caused by religion, but then
it turns out to be in the process," he
said. "People invent causes and
frame them into their identities."
As a researcher, Brown said
one of the fundamental problems
is how social scientists conduct
their research in the field.
"Political scientists and schol
ars working on religion face the
problem of re-labeling religious
conflicts, which feeds into narra
tives that become accessible to
groups [involved in the conflict],"
he said.
Citing ethnic conflict in Sri
Lanka, Brown argued that schol
ars such as Samuel Huntington in
correctly labeled the Sri Lankan
conflict as a religious one, and thus
gave "identity entrepreneurs" the
opportunity to manipulate their

literature.
Brown further argued the idea
of a "relationship between de
mand and supply and identity,"
stating that not all of these identity
narratives stick.
"Attempts to 'lslam-ize' the
Free Aceh movement fall on deaf
ears," he said. "There is something
about the nature of Acehnese
identity that is strong and cohe
sive. People know what it means to
be Acehnese, and Islam is part of
the project, but jihadization isn't."
He contrasted this example
against that of the Moro National
Front in the Philippines, which he
said is "a relatively new and delib
erately put-together bunch of eth
nic groups, and therefore there is a
'demand' for more of a 'jihadized'
identity."
Donald Emmerson, director of
the Southeast Asia Forum at the
Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacif
ic Research Center, provided a
few comments at the end of the
talk.
Even though he agreed with
most of the points presented, Em
merson noted, "Identity is not a
clinical choice and people can
identify with multiple identities
and have a choice,"
"I am interested in Islam in
Southeast Asia and the idea of Eu
rarabia and whether or not there is
a globalized connection of radical
ized Islam," said audience mem
ber Jane Miller Chai '6O.
"The talk was ambitious, but I
felt that the idea of Eurarabia was
not spelled out clearly," she added.

During his talk, Brown warned
against legitimizing or misinter
preting the goals of certain groups
of separatists, citing the Filipino
group Abu Sayyaf, which he calls
"pirates and war profiteers."
He emphasized the need to dis
tinguish between greed and griev
ance as causes for conflicts.
"Many times conflicts are not
really caused by religion, but then
it turns out to be in the process," he
said. "People invent causes and
frame them into their identities."
As a researcher, Brown said
one of the fundamental problems
is how social scientists conduct
their research in the field.
"Political scientists and schol
ars working on religion face the
problem of re-labeling religious
conflicts, which feeds into narra
tives that become accessible to
groups [involved in the conflict],"
he said.
Citing ethnic conflict in Sri
Lanka, Brown argued that schol
ars such as Samuel Huntington in
correctly labeled the Sri Lankan
conflict as a religious one, and thus
gave "identity entrepreneurs" the
opportunity to manipulate their

literature.
Brown further argued the idea
of a "relationship between de
mand and supply and identity,"
stating that not all of these identity
narratives stick.
"Attempts to 'lslam-ize' the
Free Aceh movement fall on deaf
ears," he said. "There is something
about the nature of Acehnese
identity that is strong and cohe
sive. People know what it means to
be Acehnese, and Islam is part of
the project, but jihadization isn't."
He contrasted this example
against that of the Moro National
Front in the Philippines, which he
said is "a relatively new and delib
erately put-together bunch of eth
nic groups, and therefore there is a
'demand' for more of a 'jihadized'
identity."
Donald Emmerson, director of
the Southeast Asia Forum at the
Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacif
ic Research Center, provided a
few comments at the end of the
talk.
Even though he agreed with
most of the points presented, Em
merson noted, "Identity is not a
clinical choice and people can
identify with multiple identities
and have a choice,"
"I am interested in Islam in
Southeast Asia and the idea of Eu
rarabia and whether or not there is
a globalized connection of radical
ized Islam," said audience mem
ber Jane Miller Chai '6O.
"The talk was ambitious, but I
felt that the idea of Eurarabia was
not spelled out clearly," she added.

Stanford's Bicycle Program, in
conjunction with the Department
of Public Safety, is working to im
prove traffic control and conges
tion on campus by installing bike
specific stop signs and riding
guidelines on the roads. Two re
cent bicycle-related accidents,
however, contribute to this exist
ing call for increased focus on
biker safety and responsibility,
according to those involved.
Stanford undergraduate
Anna Polishchuk 'l5 was hit
broadside by a car while biking
on Monday, May 7. Polishchuk
hit the windshield of the car,
which was going about 10 miles
per hour through an intersection
by Florence Moore (FloMo)
Hall. She was thrown uncon
scious two car lengths away into
the bushes.
"I was biking home from the
dining hall, and then I find myself
waking up on the ground," Pol
ishchuk said.
Despite the severity of her
crash, Polischuk escaped with
minor injuries because she was
wearing a helmet.
Stanford undergraduates are
notorious for not wearing hel
mets, and this reputation has not
gone unnoticed by Stanford hos
pital's emergency department
(ED), according to Robert Nor
ris, the ED doctor who treated
Polischuk.
"I told her she could not be a
Stanford undergrad because she
was actually wearing a helmet,"
Norris said.
Polishchuk heard similar com
ments from more of the ED staff.
"I was shocked by their shock
at my wearing a helmet," Pol
ishchuk said. "It was unsettling
how amazed they were."
Norris commented on the
value of wearing a helmet.
"This $2O investment [the hel
met] saved her life. Period," Nor
ris said. "Without the helmet
there's no doubt in my mind that
she would have been an organ
donor or dead upon arrival."
The University has been try
ing to fight the stigma behind
wearing helmets.
According to Ariadne Scott,
bicycle program coordinator, the
Bicycle Program under the
umbrella of Parking and Trans
portation Services (P&TS)
continues to offer resources such
