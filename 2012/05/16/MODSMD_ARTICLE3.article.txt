## Bike crash highlights helmet use Freshman life saved by bike helmet, ED chief says 
### ERIN INMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Bicycle Program, in
conjunction with the Department
of Public Safety, is working to im
prove traffic control and conges
tion on campus by installing bike
specific stop signs and riding
guidelines on the roads. Two re
cent bicycle-related accidents,
however, contribute to this exist
ing call for increased focus on
biker safety and responsibility,
according to those involved.
Stanford undergraduate
Anna Polishchuk 'l5 was hit
broadside by a car while biking
on Monday, May 7. Polishchuk
hit the windshield of the car,
which was going about 10 miles
per hour through an intersection
by Florence Moore (FloMo)
Hall. She was thrown uncon
scious two car lengths away into
the bushes.
"I was biking home from the
dining hall, and then I find myself
waking up on the ground," Pol
ishchuk said.
Despite the severity of her
crash, Polischuk escaped with
minor injuries because she was
wearing a helmet.
Stanford undergraduates are
notorious for not wearing hel
mets, and this reputation has not
gone unnoticed by Stanford hos
pital's emergency department
(ED), according to Robert Nor
ris, the ED doctor who treated
Polischuk.
"I told her she could not be a
Stanford undergrad because she
was actually wearing a helmet,"
Norris said.
Polishchuk heard similar com
ments from more of the ED staff.
"I was shocked by their shock
at my wearing a helmet," Pol
ishchuk said. "It was unsettling
how amazed they were."
Norris commented on the
value of wearing a helmet.
"This $2O investment [the hel
met] saved her life. Period," Nor
ris said. "Without the helmet
there's no doubt in my mind that
she would have been an organ
donor or dead upon arrival."
The University has been try
ing to fight the stigma behind
wearing helmets.
According to Ariadne Scott,
bicycle program coordinator, the
Bicycle Program under the
umbrella of Parking and Trans
portation Services (P&TS)
continues to offer resources such
as a New Student Orientation
