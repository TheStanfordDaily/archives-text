## Brown critiques identity framing 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
Graham Brown, director of the Center for De
velopment Studies at the University of Bath,
warned against generalizing regional conflicts as
caused by one factor, such as religion or nationality,
during a talk Tuesday morning.
Brown said that individuals he called "identity
entrepreneurs" often frame conflicts in terms of re
ligious and national identity so that they can mobi
lize support for their cause. According to Brown, this
is a problematic phenomenon because people face a
range of "overlapping and intersecting identities to
frame their struggle."
"Looking at the dynamics of conflicts in Asia,
when it comes to a choice between selecting a na
tional versus religious identity, there is a payoff ma
trix," Brown said, referring to the main theme of his
presentation. His talk focused on local conflicts in
Southeast Asian regions, such as the Aceh region in
Indonesia, the Sabah region in Malaysia and the
Moro National Front in the Philippines.

"There is definitely a transfer
community, and it's really well
mixed," Wood said. "I think there
can be this fear that transfers will
group off according to where they
came from, but there's no segrega
tion along those lines."
Wood said she doesn't feel as
much of a connection with the Class
of 2014 even though she is technical
ly a sophomore, feeling closer to
those in her academic classes.
"I feel like we're in this interest
ing place where we're between
being a freshman in some senses,
and being practically graduated in
others," said Jesse Clayburgh 'l3,
who transferred from a community
college in San Francisco.
Aside from this sense of separa
tion from one's graduating class, the
transfer experience has its own chal
lenges. Ronaldo Esparza 'l3 trans
ferred after two years at a communi
ty college in Miami.
"You're not sure what year
you're in," Esparza said. "For exam

pie, I was in community college for
two years, but that doesn't mean I'm
necessarily a junior."
"It all depends on what classes
they accept," he added. "That way,
it's good to have people from differ
ent grades that you can identify
with."
Stanford's learning environment
was also distinct from what Esparza
was accustomed to at his former
school.
"At community college and other
colleges, you have to work by yourself
and ace a test," Esparza said. "Here,
you have to work together to be suc
cessful.The challenging part is that it is
not only way more difficult [academ
ically] than my previous college, but
you also have to live and develop your
social skills"
Wood also said that she had to
adjust to Stanford's active social
scene after coming from an institu
tion where academics seemed to be
the school's only focus.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admission hopes to continue to
make these transitions manageable
for incoming transfers through pre
established programs like New Stu
dent Orientation.
"We remain deeply committed to
transfer students and look forward

to welcoming a vibrant and diverse
transfer class to the Farm in the
fall," Shreve said.
