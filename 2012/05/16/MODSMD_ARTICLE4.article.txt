## Brown critiques identity framing 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
Graham Brown, director of the Center for De
velopment Studies at the University of Bath,
warned against generalizing regional conflicts as
caused by one factor, such as religion or nationality,
during a talk Tuesday morning.
Brown said that individuals he called "identity
entrepreneurs" often frame conflicts in terms of re
ligious and national identity so that they can mobi
lize support for their cause. According to Brown, this
is a problematic phenomenon because people face a
range of "overlapping and intersecting identities to
frame their struggle."
"Looking at the dynamics of conflicts in Asia,
when it comes to a choice between selecting a na
tional versus religious identity, there is a payoff ma
trix," Brown said, referring to the main theme of his
presentation. His talk focused on local conflicts in
Southeast Asian regions, such as the Aceh region in
Indonesia, the Sabah region in Malaysia and the
Moro National Front in the Philippines.
