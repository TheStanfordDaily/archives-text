## Freshman dies from leukemia 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DEPUTY EDITOR 
Akash Dube, a freshman from
Dubai, died Friday, May 11, due to
complications from acute lym
phoblastic leukemia (ALL). The
Arroyo resident spent most of win
ter and spring quarter in Stanford
Hospital and the M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.
"He was a really strong, really
enthusiastic, extremely resilient
kid," said Lena Potts 'l2, Dube's res
ident assistant in Arroyo. "He was a
huge member of this community,
even though he was only here for a
few months."
Dozens of friends posted on
Dube's Facebook page following
news of his passing, expressing their
gratitude for being able to get to
know him.
"I have always been so amazed
by the way you care for other people
and the way you take such genuine
interest in the lives and feelings of
others," wrote Austin Block 'l5. "It's
so easy to see why we all love you."
"You were never here for only
one quarter, Akash. You've been
here ever since the fall, as a part of
the Arroyo family, and will always
be in our hearts," said Janhavi Var
tak 'l5.
Even after his leukemia re
turned, Potts said Dube remained
upbeat.
"He was still strong. He was the
same little Akash; he was still strong
and hopeful," she said. "He always
really believed [in himself]. That was
one of the best things about him."
"When I saw Akash in the hospi
tal he was not only smiling and opti
mistic, but his primary concern was
to make sure that I was entertained
and not hungry," said Adam Gold
berg 'l5, a fellow Arroyo resident.
"If you're battling cancer, and
you're preoccupied with the com
fort of your guests, it really just
speaks to how amazing of a person
you are."
Diagnosed his senior year of
high school, Dube organized the
Terry Fox Charity Run in Chennai,
India, in 2009. Dube went to
schools in Chennai and urged stu
dents to run, in addition to sharing
his own experience with cancer.
The race, which takes place in loca
tions all over the world, helps raise
funds for cancer research.
The Arroyo lounge now hosts a
memorial to Dube, and a white
board features written memories
from Arroyo residents and friends
of Dube surrounding photos of the
freshman.
