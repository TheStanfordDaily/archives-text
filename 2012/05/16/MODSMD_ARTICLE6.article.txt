## ASSU seeks to fill Univ. committee spots 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate ad
dressed Tuesday a pressing need to form an in
terim commission to solicit applications, inter
view and nominate student representatives for
more than 40 University committees before a
June 1 deadline.
Senators described the process as "not
ideal," "tough" and even "shitty" during their
second full-length meeting in office.

Nanci Howe, director of Student Activities
and Leadership (SAL), expressed concern
about the administration's frustration with the
ASSU's perceived incompetency if it cannot
meet the deadline for nominations.
"The last three to five years, the ASSU has
been late every year," Howe said. "Particularly
the Board of Trustees and the Faculty Senate
[are] quite unhappy with the performance of
the ASSU ... I worry about the credibility of
ASSU as an organization."
Senate Chair Branden Crouch 'l4 said that

the 13th Senate told this year's Nomination
Commission (NomCom) that the commission's
responsibilities were going to be dissolved at
the end of this academic year. As a result, the
Senate did not recruit new NomCom members
after the commission's term ended.
The premature anticipation of the previous
ASSU Senate may have been due to an expec
tation that an updated ASSU Constitution, de
veloped by the Governing Documents Com-
mission, would pass. The proposed
new Constitution revised the
process for committee nomina
tions, establishing a Joint Nomina
tions Committee made up of
ASSU elected representatives in
stead of delegating the responsibil
ity to the external body, NomCom.
This new document, however,
unexpectedly failed to pass in the
last few weeks of the 13th Senate's
term, leaving the ASSU with an
outdated Constitution and no new
NomCom.
ASSU President Robbie Zim
broff 'l2 initially proposed Tues
day to nominate himself as the uni
lateral chair of an interim nomina
tions committee. Senator Garima
Sharma 'l5 noted, however, that
this suggestion violated the bylaws
of the Association, which say that
"no member of the [Nominations]
Commission shall, during her/his
term, hold an elected office of the
Association," disqualifying Zim
broff from such a position.
For the Senate to approve Zim
broff's self-nomination, represen
tatives would have been required
to suspend the Senate bylaws and
rules of order, an action opposed
by several senators.
Most senators said that while
they viewed the idea of suspending
the bylaws and giving the power of
nomination to Zimbroff as flawed,
the alternative of losing student
influence in committees across
campus would be far worse.
"If this isn't done, there will be
very drastic consequences," Parlia
mentarian Kimberly Bacon 'l5
said in response to a suggestion
that the Senate have an open appli
cation process for a NomCom
chair. "I don't really see a feasible
alternative in the time crunch
we're in."
The senators also discussed
how their decision would affect the
image of the ASSU. Sharma said
that she believed nominating the
ASSU president as the chair of
NomCom, against the bylaws of
the ASSU, would reflect badly on
the Senate in terms of checking
bias.
Howe encouraged the senators
to worry less about the details of
their decision and focus more on
producing nominations efficiently.
"We have more than just the
image at stake," Jack Weller 'l5
said, supporting action rather than
meticulous attention to procedure.
"This is our duty; this is our respon
sibility. So we have to get it done."

The senators compromised by
agreeing to reinstate those mem
bers of last year's NomCom, who
accepted a re-invitation. Although
Crouch, who served on the 2011-
2012 NomCom, could only con
firm that one of the previous mem
bers would return, the senators
voted unanimously in favor of the
revised bill, with both Zimbroff
and the co-chairs of the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) serving as
ex officio members. The Senate did
not have to suspend the rules of
order to approve the bill.
Former GSC Chair Addy Satija
urged the Senate to ensure the ex
officio status of the GSC chairs,
without which the NomCom
would not have a graduate repre
sentative, He said that the only
graduate member on last year's
NomCom has already refused to
serve again.
"If there is a proposal for Nom
inations Commission with no grad
uate students on it, I know that
people would rather defer it and
have completely no appointments
rather than go ahead with a com
mission that is entirely undergrad
uate," Satija said.
Satija also reported that the
Senate budget, which the 13th Un
dergraduate Senate passed in its
last meeting, was rejected by the
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
the following day, leaving the Sen
ate without an operating budget.
Funds for a retreat including Zim
broff, Vice President William
Wagstaff 'l2 and the senators —
which Zimbroff estimated was
around $7OO for hotel rooms, food
and gas came from the former
Senate's budget. The current Sen
ate will discuss the approval of a re
vised version of the budget in fu
ture meetings.
The senators also nominated
and confirmed Senator Christos
Haveles 'l5 as treasurer.

ex officio members. The Senate did
not have to suspend the rules of
order to approve the bill.
Former GSC Chair Addy Satija
urged the Senate to ensure the ex
officio status of the GSC chairs,
without which the NomCom
would not have a graduate repre
sentative, He said that the only
graduate member on last year's
NomCom has already refused to
serve again.
"If there is a proposal for Nom
inations Commission with no grad
uate students on it, I know that
people would rather defer it and
have completely no appointments
rather than go ahead with a com
mission that is entirely undergrad
uate," Satija said.
Satija also reported that the
Senate budget, which the 13th Un
dergraduate Senate passed in its
last meeting, was rejected by the
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
the following day, leaving the Sen
ate without an operating budget.
Funds for a retreat including Zim
broff, Vice President William
Wagstaff 'l2 and the senators —
which Zimbroff estimated was
around $7OO for hotel rooms, food
and gas came from the former
Senate's budget. The current Sen
ate will discuss the approval of a re
vised version of the budget in fu
ture meetings.
The senators also nominated
and confirmed Senator Christos
Haveles 'l5 as treasurer.

I worry about the
credibility of the
ASSU as an
organization.
NANCI HOWE,
Director of Student
Activities and Leadership (SAL)
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate ad
dressed Tuesday a pressing need to form an in
terim commission to solicit applications, inter
view and nominate student representatives for
more than 40 University committees before a
June 1 deadline.
Senators described the process as "not
ideal," "tough" and even "shitty" during their
second full-length meeting in office.

Nanci Howe, director of Student Activities
and Leadership (SAL), expressed concern
about the administration's frustration with the
ASSU's perceived incompetency if it cannot
meet the deadline for nominations.
"The last three to five years, the ASSU has
been late every year," Howe said. "Particularly
the Board of Trustees and the Faculty Senate
[are] quite unhappy with the performance of
the ASSU ... I worry about the credibility of
ASSU as an organization."
Senate Chair Branden Crouch 'l4 said that

the 13th Senate told this year's Nomination
Commission (NomCom) that the commission's
responsibilities were going to be dissolved at
the end of this academic year. As a result, the
Senate did not recruit new NomCom members
after the commission's term ended.
The premature anticipation of the previous
ASSU Senate may have been due to an expec
tation that an updated ASSU Constitution, de
veloped by the Governing Documents Com-
mission, would pass. The proposed
new Constitution revised the
process for committee nomina
tions, establishing a Joint Nomina
tions Committee made up of
ASSU elected representatives in
stead of delegating the responsibil
ity to the external body, NomCom.
This new document, however,
unexpectedly failed to pass in the
last few weeks of the 13th Senate's
term, leaving the ASSU with an
outdated Constitution and no new
NomCom.
ASSU President Robbie Zim
broff 'l2 initially proposed Tues
day to nominate himself as the uni
lateral chair of an interim nomina
tions committee. Senator Garima
Sharma 'l5 noted, however, that
this suggestion violated the bylaws
of the Association, which say that
"no member of the [Nominations]
Commission shall, during her/his
term, hold an elected office of the
Association," disqualifying Zim
broff from such a position.
For the Senate to approve Zim
broff's self-nomination, represen
tatives would have been required
to suspend the Senate bylaws and
rules of order, an action opposed
by several senators.
Most senators said that while
they viewed the idea of suspending
the bylaws and giving the power of
nomination to Zimbroff as flawed,
the alternative of losing student
influence in committees across
campus would be far worse.
"If this isn't done, there will be
very drastic consequences," Parlia
mentarian Kimberly Bacon 'l5
said in response to a suggestion
that the Senate have an open appli
cation process for a NomCom
chair. "I don't really see a feasible
alternative in the time crunch
we're in."
The senators also discussed
how their decision would affect the
image of the ASSU. Sharma said
that she believed nominating the
ASSU president as the chair of
NomCom, against the bylaws of
the ASSU, would reflect badly on
the Senate in terms of checking
bias.
Howe encouraged the senators
to worry less about the details of
their decision and focus more on
producing nominations efficiently.
"We have more than just the
image at stake," Jack Weller 'l5
said, supporting action rather than
meticulous attention to procedure.
"This is our duty; this is our respon
sibility. So we have to get it done."

The senators compromised by
agreeing to reinstate those mem
bers of last year's NomCom, who
accepted a re-invitation. Although
Crouch, who served on the 2011-
2012 NomCom, could only con
firm that one of the previous mem
bers would return, the senators
voted unanimously in favor of the
revised bill, with both Zimbroff
and the co-chairs of the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) serving as
ex officio members. The Senate did
not have to suspend the rules of
order to approve the bill.
