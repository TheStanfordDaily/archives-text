## Caterpillar outbreak prompts night spray 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ileana Najarro 
In response to an outbreak of
oak moth and tussock moth cater
pillars, Buildings and Grounds
Maintenance sprayed oak trees
around Crothers Hall, Branner
Hall and Toyon Hall Tuesday
overnight.
The diluted "Conserve" solution
used on the trees should help pro
tect them from the furry visitors
that have already caused trees near
Crothers to lose a significant
amount of leaves. The University
implemented this solution two
years ago, but the caterpillar popu
lation has continued to spike during
spring.
The spray will provide aid to
more than just oak trees, according
to an email sent out to residents of
the affected houses.
"Pedestrians also typically do
not enjoy having the caterpillars
drop down on them as they walk
by, so benefit from this treatment
program as well," wrote Craig Har
bick, Crothers Hall front desk co
ordinator.
The spraying is part of the Uni
versity's integrated pest manage
ment system implemented this
month, which aims to address this
seasonal phenomenon of the cater
pillar outbreak on campus while
causing minimal damage to the en
vironment.
The caterpillars are a devastating
natural threat to the local oak trees,
according to a pest control notice on
the Student Housing website. The
University has created a map of
which oak trees will be treated.
