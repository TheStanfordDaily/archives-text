## SEEING GREEN Jekyll and Hyde 
### Holly Moeller 
End-of-year academic stress
getting you down? Here's a
spirit-lifting tip: Open your
browser and Google "Heartland
billboard."
You'll quickly find The Heart
land Institute's latest propaganda
piece: a mug shot of Ted Kaczynski
next to the words, "I still believe in
Global Warming. Do you?" Heart
land's not-so-subtle subtext: If you
think the climate is changing,
you're no better the Unabomber.
The billboard, which appeared
alongside a Chicago highway, was
the first in a series that would have
included other standout characters
like Osama bin Laden and Charles
Manson.
But the message was so outra
geous (almost humorously so
see Grist.org for some telling
spoofs) that the backlash which
included public withdrawals of fun
der support convinced Heart
land to cancel the ad within hours.
The incident is the latest in a se
ries of ethical quandaries that have
cropped up since the think tank
switched on its climate change de
nial machinery. The Heartland In
stitute bills itself as a pro-business
non-profit with a $6 million annual
budget for education, lobbying, ad
vertising and regular installments
of its "International Conference
on Climate Change," which fea
tures climate change skeptics from
around the world. Recently leaked
internal documents describe
(mis)education plans and public
opinion campaigns designed to
perpetuate the embarrassingly
prevalent American disbelief in
human-driven climate change, de
spite overwhelming scientific con
sensus to the contrary.
Heartland is just one part of the
pervasive climate change denial
machine, which spans think tanks,
interest groups and political par
ties. Its financers represent an even
broader spectrum, from private
donors to corporations built on
fossil fuel usage. But it's getting
harder and harder to figure out
who's paying for which messages
because, as evidence for climate
change mounts, Americans are
getting more suspicious. For exam
ple, in 2005, Heartland stopped
naming its funding sources, pulling
another shroud between its mes
sages to the American public, and
those who fund them.
Given Heartland's position on
climate change, it's not surprising
to note that, since 1998, the think
tank has received more than half a
billion dollars from ExxonMobil
a multinational energy compa
ny that would do particularly well
by convincing us not to worry
about our carbon footprints.
Though ExxonMobil reported
ly cut ties with Heartland in 2006
after being embroiled in a public
relations fiasco surrounding its
support of climate change denial, it
remains a key member of the
American Petroleum Institute.
The API is the political voice of the
oil and natural gas industry in the
United States. Backed by 400
member corporations includ
ing ConocoPhillips, BP and Shell

it spends $3 million lobbying in
Washington each year, and more
on ad campaigns convincing
Americans of the critical impor
tance of fossil fuels.
The bottom line is simple: If you
sell oil, coal or gas, acknowledging
climate change is bad for business.
But what all these companies
also understand, very clearly, is
that climate change is happening,
and that it can, in itself, be bad for
business. For example, melting per
mafrost threatens the stability of
the Alaskan oil pipeline. And in
tensified hurricanes increase dam
age to Gulf of Mexico drilling rigs.
And then there's the elephant
in the room: fossil fuel supplies are
finite, and we're already on the
downhill side of production. Major
oil and gas companies are adding
alternative energies to their port
folios, hoping to ensure their sur
vival in the post-fossil fuel world.
Perhaps that's why in 2002, long
before it froze out Heartland,
ExxonMobil committed $lOO mil
lion in research funds to Stanford's
own Global Climate and Energy
Project. The company also invests
in energy conservation research at
MIT, Carnegie Mellon and other
research universities.
Exxon is not alone. Consider
BP, now self-styled "Beyond Pe
troleum." Or flip through the
APl's seven-page list of the ways
its member corporations are ad
dressing climate change. Many of
these efforts have been in the re
search pipeline for a decade or
more, occurring behind the scenes
at companies whose public rela
tions machinery busy denying cli
mate change.
This year, investors at Exxon-
Mobil, Chevron and Cono
coPhillips have filed multiple
shareholder resolutions asking for
management transparency. They
want to know what plans are being
made for climate change, whether
greenhouse gas emissions will be
reduced and if hydraulic fracturing
is really still on the table. They
want to know how their stock port
folios will sustain growth in an un
sustainable market space.
These focused demands, and
the gradual change in opinion of
the American public, have forced
many energy corporations to
green their image, highlighting re
newables research and hiding ties
to the Heartlands of the world.
It's our job as consumers of
oil and of advertising â€”to see
those ties anyway. Because as long
as environmental concerns threat
en the profits of these big corpora
tions, a very powerful Mr. Hyde will
be working in Dr. Jekyll's shadows.
