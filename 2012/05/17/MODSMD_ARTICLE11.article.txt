# MODERN MANNERS
## A 						look at Stanford burners 
### Jeff Mandell 
The residents and visitors of
Stanford, Calif, enjoy a
range of dining options
within the grounds of the world's
second-largest contiguous univer
sity campus. It is therefore with
the utmost humility that I attempt
to contribute to your understand
ing of this culinary landscape, as I
talk about the burgers at Stan
ford.
There are far more hamburg
ers to be found at Stanford than
meet the eye. Every dining hall of
fers a variant of the Stanford Din
ing Burger. The Alumni Cafe has
a burger on Thursdays. Numerous
concession stands sell hamburg
ers during athletic contests.
Schwab Executive Services and
other catering companies pro
duce burgers for private, unpubli
cized events, presenting chal
lenges to data collection. In addi
tion, football weekends bring in
legions of tailgaters who grill their
own meats in an uncontrolled en
vironment. That said, I have
reached a few conclusions about
Stanford burgers.
As I remember last year's of
ferings from Manzanita and
Wilbur, they reflect the range of
burgers found at undergrad din
ing halls. The ingredients were
mediocre but satisfying, and for
the most part students were
happy to have what they consid
ered a truly acceptable burger in
the convenience of their dining
halls. Typically nondescript, these
burgers were sometimes en
hanced at Wilbur when they ap
peared as grill specials, with the
addition of chipotle aioli, bacon,
mushrooms or grilled onions. In
particular, the bison burger at
Wilbur was legendary. Manzanita
cooked its patties beforehand and
simply reheated, as was readily
apparent from the tray of moist,
grayish cooling patties behind the
serving counter; if Wilbur did the
same, it was less transparent
about the practice. The difference
showed, though not as much as

one might expect. I assume most
dining hall burgers today are sim
ilarly unremarkable, falling some
where within the Manzanita-
Wilbur spectrum.
The Axe and Palm presents an
interesting case study in the com
mercialization of school spirit. In
an effort to capitalize on the re
cent success of the football team,
a football-themed redesign has
been in place for a couple years
now. A panoramic photo of the
gridiron taken from field level
covers an entire wall, giving a
bizarre impression of being on the
sidelines of a game frozen in time.
Stylized images of Toby Gerhart
and Andrew Luck in action or sur
rounded by band members blan
ket all remaining surfaces, except
for a few framed Daily articles
chronicling great moments in
Stanford Axe history and an enor
mous scoreboard emblazoned
with a "Big Game Countdown"
that could have been displayed in
a quarter of the space. Burgers
have names like The Axe, The
Touchdown, The Big Game and
The Heisman, and they are not
too good.The meat has a slimy ex
terior and little taste, and is ac
companied by a soggy wilted let
tuce leaf. If you don't specify oth
erwise, they might pawn off a cold
whole wheat bun on you.
Despite all of this, some Stan
ford students appear to think
highly of The Axe and Palm. Sev
eral of the people I asked named
TAP as the best burger joint on
campus. They were usually not
overly enthusiastic about it, sug
gesting that they may not have
known the extent of other options,
but they named TAP nevertheless.
Enlightened palates might ques
tion their loyalties, but TAP's
place in undergraduate cultural
life may well be affecting students'
perceptions of its quality.
Like TAP, the Treehouse has a
claim to being a campus institu
tion, which it leverages through
burger names such as The Cardi-

nal and The Axe. Their burgers are
better than The Axe and Palm's
they have to be, since the Tree
house cannot rely on meal plan
dollars to stay in business. While
certainly enjoyable, the burgers
are hardly life-changing.
I also encourage you to ex
plore some of the lesser-known,
out-of-the-way burger options at
Stanford. One has to admit that
Russo Cafe at Munger, while a
vaguely elitist cafe, serves a solid
burger special. Even better, there
is Tootsie's, an Italian lunch spot
on the corner of Stanford Shop
ping Mall next to the Medical
School. They serve a fancy burger
made of veal, pork and beef with
good shoestring fries.
There are still many Stanford
burgers I've never had, so go out
and try them all. Make sure to let
me know what I've missed.

Touchdown, The Big Game and
The Heisman, and they are not
too good.The meat has a slimy ex
terior and little taste, and is ac
companied by a soggy wilted let
tuce leaf. If you don't specify oth
erwise, they might pawn off a cold
whole wheat bun on you.
Despite all of this, some Stan
ford students appear to think
highly of The Axe and Palm. Sev
eral of the people I asked named
TAP as the best burger joint on
campus. They were usually not
overly enthusiastic about it, sug
gesting that they may not have
known the extent of other options,
but they named TAP nevertheless.
Enlightened palates might ques
tion their loyalties, but TAP's
place in undergraduate cultural
life may well be affecting students'
perceptions of its quality.
Like TAP, the Treehouse has a
claim to being a campus institu
tion, which it leverages through
burger names such as The Cardi-

nal and The Axe. Their burgers are
better than The Axe and Palm's
they have to be, since the Tree
house cannot rely on meal plan
dollars to stay in business. While
certainly enjoyable, the burgers
are hardly life-changing.
I also encourage you to ex
plore some of the lesser-known,
out-of-the-way burger options at
Stanford. One has to admit that
Russo Cafe at Munger, while a
vaguely elitist cafe, serves a solid
burger special. Even better, there
is Tootsie's, an Italian lunch spot
on the corner of Stanford Shop
ping Mall next to the Medical
School. They serve a fancy burger
made of veal, pork and beef with
good shoestring fries.
There are still many Stanford
burgers I've never had, so go out
and try them all. Make sure to let
me know what I've missed.

The residents and visitors of
Stanford, Calif, enjoy a
range of dining options
within the grounds of the world's
second-largest contiguous univer
sity campus. It is therefore with
the utmost humility that I attempt
to contribute to your understand
ing of this culinary landscape, as I
talk about the burgers at Stan
ford.
There are far more hamburg
ers to be found at Stanford than
meet the eye. Every dining hall of
fers a variant of the Stanford Din
ing Burger. The Alumni Cafe has
a burger on Thursdays. Numerous
concession stands sell hamburg
ers during athletic contests.
Schwab Executive Services and
other catering companies pro
duce burgers for private, unpubli
cized events, presenting chal
lenges to data collection. In addi
tion, football weekends bring in
legions of tailgaters who grill their
own meats in an uncontrolled en
vironment. That said, I have
reached a few conclusions about
Stanford burgers.
As I remember last year's of
ferings from Manzanita and
Wilbur, they reflect the range of
burgers found at undergrad din
ing halls. The ingredients were
mediocre but satisfying, and for
the most part students were
happy to have what they consid
ered a truly acceptable burger in
the convenience of their dining
halls. Typically nondescript, these
burgers were sometimes en
hanced at Wilbur when they ap
peared as grill specials, with the
addition of chipotle aioli, bacon,
mushrooms or grilled onions. In
particular, the bison burger at
Wilbur was legendary. Manzanita
cooked its patties beforehand and
simply reheated, as was readily
apparent from the tray of moist,
grayish cooling patties behind the
serving counter; if Wilbur did the
same, it was less transparent
about the practice. The difference
showed, though not as much as

one might expect. I assume most
dining hall burgers today are sim
ilarly unremarkable, falling some
where within the Manzanita-
Wilbur spectrum.
The Axe and Palm presents an
interesting case study in the com
mercialization of school spirit. In
an effort to capitalize on the re
cent success of the football team,
a football-themed redesign has
been in place for a couple years
now. A panoramic photo of the
gridiron taken from field level
covers an entire wall, giving a
bizarre impression of being on the
sidelines of a game frozen in time.
Stylized images of Toby Gerhart
and Andrew Luck in action or sur
rounded by band members blan
ket all remaining surfaces, except
for a few framed Daily articles
chronicling great moments in
Stanford Axe history and an enor
mous scoreboard emblazoned
with a "Big Game Countdown"
that could have been displayed in
a quarter of the space. Burgers
have names like The Axe, The
Touchdown, The Big Game and
The Heisman, and they are not
too good.The meat has a slimy ex
terior and little taste, and is ac
companied by a soggy wilted let
tuce leaf. If you don't specify oth
