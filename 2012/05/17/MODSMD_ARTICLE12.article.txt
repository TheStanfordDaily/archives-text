## Dissecting Card's woes at receiver 
### Jack Blanchat 
Since the NFL draft, I've
been spending a lot of
time sifting through the
Internet in order to learn
about the situations that
the former Stanford football play
ers are now in. After all, football
season never really ends. For some,
like Andrew Luck, it means high
expectations abound.
Like my colleague Tom Taylor, I
can't resist occasionally looking at
the inane banter that populates the
comments section of these articles
about Luck. Down in the Stygian
depths of these pages, I frequently
found a refrain that goes some
thing like this: "If he had any good
wide receivers at Stanford, he
would have been incredible."
While this is usually used as a de
fense of Luck's college career (as if
he needed one) or an explanation
of why he'll be good in the pros
(again, as if he needed one), this set
me to thinking: where exactly have
all of Stanford's wide receivers
been hiding over these past few
years?
While there have been some
success stories at wideout these
past few seasons Ryan Whalen
and Griff Whalen became two of
Luck's favorite targets even though
both started their Stanford careers
as walk-ons, and Ty Montgomery
was a smashing success in his fresh
man campaign many of Stan
ford's recruited wide receivers
have never quite seen their careers
get off the ground.
This is partially due to the fact
that tight ends Coby Fleener, Zach
Ertz and Levine Toilolo have been
so prolific, but there still is a gap of
talent out wide that begs to be ex
plained. So, through the magic of
the Internet, I set out to examine
just what has happened to the "elite
receivers" on the Farm.
Perhaps the profound gap at
wide receiver is due to the strange
semi-disappearance of two players
that were perceived to be corner
stones of Stanford's passing game
for years to come.
In 2009, the Cardinal brought in
one of its strongest recruiting class
es in years on the heels of the class
that included future first-rounders
Luck and David DeCastro.That in
cluded two four-star wide receiver
recruits, Jemari Roberts and Jamal-
Rashad Patterson.
Roberts, from Long Beach,
Calif., was ranked the 18th-best re
ceiver in the country, and Patterson,
from McDonough, Ga., was seen as
the 28th-best pass-catcher in the
country. Roberts, at 6-foot-3 and
205 pounds, looked like he would
pair with Patterson, who is 6-foot-2
and 194 pounds, as a pair of deep
threats that would help push the
Cardinal back to its winning ways.
But three years later, the two
four-stars have little to show except
tales of unrealized potential. While
Patterson did reach the end zone to
score his first (and only) career
touchdown against San Jose State
in 2009, perhaps his most well
known career highlight is when he
was ejected from the Cardinal's
2009 48-14 blowout win over Cal
for throwing a punch at a Bear
player before the opening kickoff.
Sadly, Roberts is best known for ..
. nothing. The former four-star has
yet to catch a single pass in his Stan
ford career.
However, their time on the
Farm and their time to make a
mark isn't up yet, as Patterson
will be a senior in the fall and
Roberts will return for his redshirt
junior season.
While they still have a year to
realize their potential, Stanford has
also driven away a pair of promis
ing wide receivers over these last
few seasons.
The next recruiting season, the
Cardinal brought in three-star
quarterback Darren Daniel, an Al
abama native, and, with Luck enter
ing his senior season, new head
coach David Shaw and his staff con
verted him to play wide receiver the
next spring. Additionally, the Cardi
nal secured an early commitment
from Tai-ler Jones, a four-star re
cruit from Georgia, but Jones even
tually changed his mind and signed
with (yuck) Notre Dame instead.
Daniel was generally pretty im
pressive in spring practice, showing
off a lot of athleticism as both a
pass-catcher and a wildcat quarter
back, but he ultimately decided
that the switch wasn't for him, and
elected to transfer, where he ended
up at Itawamba Community Col-
