# DOWN TO GEORGIA
## NCAAs continue vs. Northwestern 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team breezed
through the first and second rounds of the
NCAA Championships on its home courts last
weekend with wins over Stony Brook and
Yale. Now the Cardinal faces its true test in
Athens, Ga. Fourth-seeded Stanford (20-1,9-1
Pac-12) traveled cross-country on Monday
morning in preparation for its match against
13th-seeded Northwestern today.
This will be the Cardinal's 27th straight ap
pearance in the NCAA round of 16, and
Northwestern's ninth straight. Ironically, Stan
ford will be playing Northwestern in the third
round for the second consecutive year. In a
match that went until early in the morning last
May, the Wildcats (20-8, 10-1 Big Ten) came
close to crushing then-No. 1 Stanford's hopes
at a national title earlier than expected. Senior
captain Veronica Li, however, looks back on
last year's battle as something that benefited
her team in the long run.
"It's great to have a tough match in the be
ginning because, if you can secure a victory, it
gets you ready for the rest of the tournament,"
Li said. "Last year, that match helped remind us
to stay tough out there and fight for each point."
Northwestern went up 2-1 early in the
match with a victory on court four after North
western's Kate Turvy's had a straight-set de
feat of Stanford's Stacey Tan. This year, Turvy
will likely face sophomore Nicole Gibbs on
court one, the court both players have manned
for their respective teams throughout the sea
son. Stanford also dropped the doubles point
in last year's matchup, something the players
intend to change this year.
"We want to play with a lot of confidence and
scare some people out there," Li said. "We've
definitely put in a lot of work in doubles, espe
cially in the last month or two. Everyone seems
to be really in sync and working as a team."
Li, who has been playing No. 3 doubles with
junior Natalie Dillon, commented on her part
ner's play.
"She's really competitive and it's such a
huge advantage to have someone you can trust
to fight and pull out the big points," Li said.
This year will mark Dillon's first appear
ance in the NCAA tournament both as a dou
bles and singles player. Sophomore Kristie
Ahn, a critical member of the squad who has

battled injuries since last year's NCAA tour
nament, hopes to make a comeback this year.
At this point, though, her return still seems up
in the air.
"I think we're taking it one day at a time,
but it's a conversation between her and
coaches and trainers," Li said. "As teammates,
we are doing our best to support her, but we
know that she'll be a huge part in our success
and do her best to contribute in whatever role
she plays."
Li also made clear that supporting the team
is what's most important at this stage in the sea
son. The NCAA rules for the tournament man
date that each match is the best of seven points,
so if a team goes up 4-0, then the remaining
matches go unfinished. Some players find this
format to be disruptive and frustrating.
"You know, people are finishers and people
love to be able to go out and give a win," Li
said. "For the players that do, it's great. For the
ones that don't get to finish, it's definitely

tough to stop short because a lot of girls get
better as they go. You've got to be ready for
anything, though. You've got to focus on your
court and play each point the same. If your
team wins, it's all for the better."
As captain and the sole senior on the team,
Li is the most experienced player on the squad.
Her advice to freshman Ellen Tsay and the
other players participating in their first NCAA
is to enjoy the moment.
"It's such a special experience to play for a
team and to have gotten this far," Li said. "You
have to enjoy it. Winning isn't necessarily the
thing I remember the most. It's more about the
little things like playing music in the parking
lot or hanging out at night in a room and
watching a funny movie. My memories are
mostly of spending time with the team."
That being said, there's no doubt the Cardi
nal is ready to take on the nation's elite teams.

but the players are taking it one
step at a time.
"We are a team that doesn't pre
pare differently for certain match
es," she said. "We try to do the best
we can day-to-day, and I don't think
we're thinking about the whole
tournament, but instead the next
match we are going to play."
For right now, that focus is on
getting past Northwestern. The
match will take place at the Dan
Magill Tennis Complex at 9 a.m.
Pacific Standard Time.

This will be the Cardinal's 27th straight ap
pearance in the NCAA round of 16, and
Northwestern's ninth straight. Ironically, Stan
ford will be playing Northwestern in the third
round for the second consecutive year. In a
match that went until early in the morning last
May, the Wildcats (20-8, 10-1 Big Ten) came
close to crushing then-No. 1 Stanford's hopes
at a national title earlier than expected. Senior
captain Veronica Li, however, looks back on
last year's battle as something that benefited
her team in the long run.
"It's great to have a tough match in the be
ginning because, if you can secure a victory, it
gets you ready for the rest of the tournament,"
Li said. "Last year, that match helped remind us
to stay tough out there and fight for each point."
Northwestern went up 2-1 early in the
match with a victory on court four after North
western's Kate Turvy's had a straight-set de
feat of Stanford's Stacey Tan. This year, Turvy
will likely face sophomore Nicole Gibbs on
court one, the court both players have manned
for their respective teams throughout the sea
son. Stanford also dropped the doubles point
in last year's matchup, something the players
intend to change this year.
"We want to play with a lot of confidence and
scare some people out there," Li said. "We've
definitely put in a lot of work in doubles, espe
cially in the last month or two. Everyone seems
to be really in sync and working as a team."
Li, who has been playing No. 3 doubles with
junior Natalie Dillon, commented on her part
ner's play.
"She's really competitive and it's such a
huge advantage to have someone you can trust
to fight and pull out the big points," Li said.
This year will mark Dillon's first appear
ance in the NCAA tournament both as a dou
bles and singles player. Sophomore Kristie
Ahn, a critical member of the squad who has

battled injuries since last year's NCAA tour
nament, hopes to make a comeback this year.
At this point, though, her return still seems up
in the air.
"I think we're taking it one day at a time,
but it's a conversation between her and
coaches and trainers," Li said. "As teammates,
we are doing our best to support her, but we
know that she'll be a huge part in our success
and do her best to contribute in whatever role
she plays."
Li also made clear that supporting the team
is what's most important at this stage in the sea
son. The NCAA rules for the tournament man
date that each match is the best of seven points,
so if a team goes up 4-0, then the remaining
matches go unfinished. Some players find this
format to be disruptive and frustrating.
"You know, people are finishers and people
love to be able to go out and give a win," Li
said. "For the players that do, it's great. For the
ones that don't get to finish, it's definitely

tough to stop short because a lot of girls get
better as they go. You've got to be ready for
anything, though. You've got to focus on your
court and play each point the same. If your
team wins, it's all for the better."
As captain and the sole senior on the team,
Li is the most experienced player on the squad.
Her advice to freshman Ellen Tsay and the
other players participating in their first NCAA
is to enjoy the moment.
"It's such a special experience to play for a
team and to have gotten this far," Li said. "You
have to enjoy it. Winning isn't necessarily the
thing I remember the most. It's more about the
little things like playing music in the parking
lot or hanging out at night in a room and
watching a funny movie. My memories are
mostly of spending time with the team."
That being said, there's no doubt the Cardi
nal is ready to take on the nation's elite teams.

but the players are taking it one
step at a time.
"We are a team that doesn't pre
pare differently for certain match
es," she said. "We try to do the best
we can day-to-day, and I don't think
we're thinking about the whole
tournament, but instead the next
match we are going to play."
For right now, that focus is on
getting past Northwestern. The
match will take place at the Dan

The Stanford women's tennis team breezed
through the first and second rounds of the
NCAA Championships on its home courts last
weekend with wins over Stony Brook and
Yale. Now the Cardinal faces its true test in
Athens, Ga. Fourth-seeded Stanford (20-1,9-1
Pac-12) traveled cross-country on Monday
morning in preparation for its match against
13th-seeded Northwestern today.
