# MEN'S GOLF
## Home cooking at NCAA Regionals 
### AUSTIN BLOCK STAFF WRITER 
After a disappointing fifth-place finish at the
Pac-12 Championships, the Stanford men's golf
team has the chance to redeem itself at the
NCAA Regionals, which start today at the
Stanford Golf Course.
The Cardinal is seeded second behind Cal in
the 13-team tournament. Stanford will be led by
Pac-12 Freshman of the Year Patrick Rodgers
and in-form junior Andrew Yun, who won the
Pac-12 Championships two weeks ago and fin
ished fourth at the Western Intercollegiate two
weeks prior.
Golfweek lists Yun as the nation's 12th
ranked collegiate golfer, and Rodgers is ranked
third. Rodgers was recently named one of three
finalists for the Ben Hogan Award, which is
perennially awarded to the nation's best college
golfer. No sophomores and only one freshman,
current PGA Tour star Rickie Fowler, have
ever won the award.
If Stanford finishes in the top five of the re

gional tournament, the team will then travel to
Los Angeles for the NCAA Championships at
Riviera Country Club, which begins May 29.
Following three rounds of stroke play in the 30-
team tournament, the top eight teams will face
off in match play to determine the NCAA
champion.
For now, the Cardinal's focus is on regionals.
Fortunately for Stanford, this week's field is not
as strong as some of the other fields the team
has faced this season. After No. 7 Cal, the high
est-ranked teams the Cardinal will compete
against are No. 14 San Diego State, No. 22 Cen
tral Florida and No. 23 LSU. Stanford is current
ly ranked eighth nationally.
Rounding out the lineup for regionals is
sophomore Cameron Wilson, who started
strong at Pac-12s before being disqualified for a
scorekeeping mishap, freshman Patrick Grimes
and senior captain David Chung. Players com
peted in four rounds of qualifying last week to
determine which five would play this weekend.
"It was a difficult test for everybody and put
the guys under a lot of pressure," Rodgers said.

''l think we have a great team and I really like
our chances."
But Yun said the weaker field and home
course advantage would not lull the team into a
false sense of security.
"I don't think we're going to have that prob
lem because we've only won one tournament,"
Yun said. "I think everybody on our team un
derstands that winning is a habit, like our coach
always says, and I feel like if you want to get
things rolling and go into nationals on a high I
think we have to get that win under our belt...
I think everyone wants to get that win and I
think they're really motivated to play well."
Yun and Rodgers both agreed that playing
at home puts no extra pressure on the team.
"Since we do have so much support, it's very
easy to have momentum on your side," Yun said.
"When you're not playing that well, people are
there cheering for you and encouraging you to
do better, and when you are playing well, every
body is on your side."

Senior David Chung (above) hopes to finish his college career off with a berth in the NCAA Championships. The Stanford men's golf team can
qualify for NCAAs by placing in the top five of this weekend's 13-team NCAA Regionals. The action starts today at the Stanford Golf Course.
"I don't see really any extra
pressure playing at home, I just
view it as we know the golf course
better than most," Rodgers said.
"We still have to go out there,
though, and hit the shots and get
the job done, but I really like our
chances."
The course will play more diffi
cult than usual, as the greens will be
firm and fast and the rough has
grown long. In light of these factors,
team captain Wilson Bowen said
players need to make sure they
keep the ball in-play off the tee and
that they leave themselves with up
hill putts.
This tournament will mark the
Cardinal's first playoff appearance
since last year's NCAA Central
Regionals, where the team stum
bled to a sixth-place finish and nar
rowly missed out on the national
tournament. Yun said last year's
disappointment is not on his mind.
"I feel like our team is a lot clos
er this year, our te am is playing a lot
better this year, and even the same
guys that we had last year weren't
playing as well as they are this
year," Yun said. "It's a totally differ
ent story, and I think we're going to
have a lot better result this region
al."
The three-day tournament be
gins at the Stanford Golf Course
today.
