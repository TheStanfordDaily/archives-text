# SPORTS BRIEF
## Men's swimming coach Skip Kenney retires after historic career 
### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
Stanford men's swimming
head coach Skip Kenney is calling
it a career after 33 years on the
Farm. The 69-year-old coach was
one of the legends of the swim

ming world, winning 31 consecu
tive conference titles from 1982
through 2012, a streak that more
than doubles the previous Pac-10
record for any sport (John Wood
en's 14-year streak in men's bas
ketball at UCLA).
During this same 31-year peri
od, Kenney led Stanford to a top
four national finish every year, the
longest streak in history. Kenney
won seven NCAA titles in his 33-
year run after the Cardinal had
just one title and four top-three
finishes in the 45 years before
Kenney arrived.
Under Kenney's leadership,
Stanford produced 72 individual
NCAA champions, 134 Ail-
Americans and 1,086 total Ail-
American awards in 33 years. In
addition, 20 athletes went on to
the Olympics, winning a total of 18
medals. Kenney coached many of
them as Olympic head coach of
men's swimming in the 1996
Games.
Perhaps most importantly for
the six-time National Coach of
the Year and 20-time Pac-10
Coach of the Year, Kenney had a
100 percent graduation rate dur
ing his tenure at Stanford, includ
ing 10 Academic All-Americans.
The Long Beach State gradu
ate never swam competitively, but
he has made an enormous impact
on the swimming world as a
coach. Kenney will coach Stan
ford swimmers through the U.S.
Olympic Trials on July 2 before
calling it quits.
