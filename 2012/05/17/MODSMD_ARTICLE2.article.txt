## Profs reform Med School lecture style 
### ERIN INMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The traditional lecture-based for
mat of medical education has be
come obsolete, according to two
Stanford faculty researchers who
have instead put forward a proposal
for medical education in the 21st cen
tury.
The model devised by Chip
Heath '9l, a professor in the Gradu
ate School of Business (GSB) and
Charles Prober, a professor at the
School of Medicine focuses on
shifting large lecture-based classes to
10 to 15 minute videos online and
using the resulting class time to work
in small groups on application prob
lems of the material a "flipped
classroom model" that makes mate
rial more "sticky."
"The average attention span to
listen to a message is between 10 and
15 minutes before the mind wan
ders," Prober said. "We want to take
advantage of this limited attention
span and large class size and move it
onto a smaller stage."
An online platform for lectures
also offers students greater flexibili
ty, according to Prober. Students may
watch videos as many times as they
want, and may do so whenever and
wherever it is most convenient for
