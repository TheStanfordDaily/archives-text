## Profs reform Med School lecture style 
### ERIN INMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The traditional lecture-based for
mat of medical education has be
come obsolete, according to two
Stanford faculty researchers who
have instead put forward a proposal
for medical education in the 21st cen
tury.
The model devised by Chip
Heath '9l, a professor in the Gradu
ate School of Business (GSB) and
Charles Prober, a professor at the
School of Medicine focuses on
shifting large lecture-based classes to
10 to 15 minute videos online and
using the resulting class time to work
in small groups on application prob
lems of the material a "flipped
classroom model" that makes mate
rial more "sticky."
"The average attention span to
listen to a message is between 10 and
15 minutes before the mind wan
ders," Prober said. "We want to take
advantage of this limited attention
span and large class size and move it
onto a smaller stage."
An online platform for lectures
also offers students greater flexibili
ty, according to Prober. Students may
watch videos as many times as they
want, and may do so whenever and
wherever it is most convenient for

them. Videos are also broken up
into segments chosen to match
the average attention span.
Quizzes can also be embedded
into videos to further enhance in
struction, Prober added, noting
that the computer science depart
ment already does so.
"Student responses can be
tracked to indicate to the learner
or teacher that acquisition of ma
terial has occurred," Prober said.
Online classes are "not a novel
idea," he added, referring to the
popular Khan Academy tutorials.
The School of Medicine has also
been videotaping classes for 28
years.
"[Those] videos are not de
signed to be watched in digestible
parts," Prober conceded. "Many
students prefer watching lectures
online so optimizing the structure
of videos then makes sense. We

might as well make the delivery
mechanism better."
After watching the videos and
grasping the key concepts, stu
dents would then come to class
for smaller group interaction.
In one such interaction for a
medical class, "you might be given
a patient who has a disorder,"
Prober said. "Your understanding
of that pathway [learned online]
becomes more relevant to you."
Medical education specifically
can capitalize on this model,
Prober said.
"There's nothing more pro
found than the narrative of a pa
tient story," he argued, referenc
ing medically based television
programs such as "Grey's
Anatomy" or "House" popu
lar with the general population.
"In medicine, medical students
get hungry real quickly for under
standing of where the first two
years are taking them," Prober
said. "It can be hard to appreciate
where that will connect to what
you'll be doing as a doctor. The
more you can create that appreci

ation in this interactive way, the
more the students will appreciate
why they are learning. In doing so,
the material will become more
sticky."
The School of Medicine adopt
ed Prober and Heath's "flipped
classroom" approach for a bio
chemistry class last year. Com
pared to the year before which
used a traditional class lecture
model students gave more
positive feedback and attended
class in elevated numbers.
Prober argued that the
model's principles could be ap
plied in the future to other aca
demic disciplines across the Uni
versity and in other institutions.
"TTiere is and is going to be en
thusiasm for making a change, but
the flavor of change will vary
across universities," Prober said.
"The notion of a new education
model is not going to be a difficult
sell, maybe just a difficult imple
mentation."
