# Faculty, students laud Thiel class
## Despite Pay Pal co-founder's controversial views on higher ed, class highly reviewed 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN STAFF WRITER 
While Peter Thiel has frequently courted
controversy with his disparaging outlook on
the merits of higher education, the famed
venture capitalist's decision to teach a Stan
ford class CS 183: Startup this spring
has been met with approval from administra
tors and students alike,
"Peter was the one who was interested in
teaching the course from the onset," said
Mehran Sahami, associate chair for educa
tion in the computer science department.

Despite his celebrated accomplishments,
including co-founding Pay Pal and being an
early investor in Facebook.Thiel underwent
the same process in proposing and designing
the course as all other non-Stanford affili
ates.
"We thought there were certainly student
demands to find out more about entrepre
neurship and start-ups," Sahami said. "This is
a class that's being offered through the CS
department because it's about technology,
but in some sense it's geared towards the
business of technology rather than the tech
nology itself."

The class, capped at a capacity of 250 stu
dents, filled up rapidly and was still oversub
scribed at the start of the quarter.
"My ideal would be 10 people talking to
Peter Thiel a small little seminar but
obviously, given the level of interest, I think
he manages [the large class] really well," said
Viraj Bindra 'l5.
"He is open to questions during class, but
he otherwise keeps the lectures a good mix of
defining the culture and defining the process,
along with a lot of personal anecdotes that
enhance our learning," Bindra
added.
Thiel did not respond to multi
ple requests for comment by The
Daily.
Thiel's critical view of higher
education is well known he
billed CS: 183 through a
spokesman as potentially "the
last class you'll ever have to take"
and recently opened the Thiel
Foundation, which offers
$lOO,OOO to budding entrepre
neurs to drop out and pursue
start-ups full time. However, his
incendiary comments have thus
far been confined to the media
rather than the lecture hall.
"During class, he will never
make those views the focus,"
Bindra said. "His focus is very
much more on educating people
for whenever they feel ready ...
which might be enough to make
some people feel ready enough to
drop out and start their own busi
ness, but I don't think that that's a
focus."
"He has been only laudatory
of Stanford, describing it as per
haps the pinnacle of higher edu
cation today," said Aaron Sekhri
'l5, a Daily writer. "He has indeed
very seldom discussed his reser
vations against higher education
in the class."
Bindra argued that Thiel's ex
perience as a start-up founder
and investor offers the most valu
able insight to enrolled students.
"That kind of perspective def
initely comes through even in a
huge lecture," Bindra said. "The

takeaway has been exactly what
I've expected, which is kind of a
crash course in how the Valley
works . . . kind of comprehen
sively addressing how to make a
company here and how to make it
successful."
Sahami stated that, while fac
ulty had been well aware of
Thiel's thoughts on higher educa
tion prior to approving the
course, they saw no conflict be
tween Thiel's opinions and the
course's prospects.
"Even though Peter may have
some outspoken views about the
value of higher education, in
some sense we think it provides
more information for students to
make their own choices," Sahami
said. "That's what education is
supposed to be about."
