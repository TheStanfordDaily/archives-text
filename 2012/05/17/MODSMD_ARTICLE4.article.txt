## Spotify co-founder talks music 
### FELIX BOYEAUX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"I never really thought of myself as an
entrepreneur," said Daniel Ek, cofounder
and CEO of the music streaming service
Spotify, to a packed NVIDIA Auditorium
Wednesday afternoon. "I simply see a bunch
of problems to solve and needs to satisfy, is
sues that no one else wanted to do anything
about. Eventually, I decided to do it myself."
Invited as part of the DFJ Entrepreneur
ial Thoughts Leader Seminar, Ek spoke on
his entrepreneurial career as well as the fu

ture of the entertainment industry.
"An entrepreneur is someone who has
an itch for a problem and is annoyed enough
to solve it," Ek said.

After starting his first company design
ing and coding websites at age 14, Ek moved
on to found the advertising company Ad
vertigo. He has since worked as chief tech
nology officer of the online community
Stardoll and as chief executive officer of
uTorrent, a Bit Torrent client. He started his
presentation, however, by explaining his ra-

tionale for founding Spotify.
"After the immense success of
services like Napster and Kazaa
around the millennium shift, it was
clear to me that people wanted to
consume music this way, on-de
mand and readily available," Ek ex
plained.
The fast Internet infrastructure
in Sweden led Ek to found Spotify
together with Martin Lorentzon
there in 2004.
"Our goal was to create servers
that were faster than the pirate
servers," he said. "We thought that
if we managed to do this, we could
get a big chunk of the 500 million
people who consumed music ille
gally."
Ek said he thought that the
problem was not that people did
not want to pay for music, but
rather that an efficient and conven
ient platform for doing so was un
available at the time.
"Because I was young and
naive, I just thought 'Hey, this can't
be too hard,' but realized soon
enough all the problems that arise
from creating a service like Spoti
fy," Ek joked. "I did not even know
that you needed licenses from the
major [record labels]!"
Getting permission from record
labels has been Spotify's single
largest problem to date. The negoti
ations with Universal took over a
year, and Spotify has yet to acquire
the rights from bands such as the
Beatles or Led Zeppelin.
"We were convinced that our
model would work, and that majors
would make profits from letting us
use their content," Ek said. "But try

for yourself to go and tell a 67-year
old man who barely agreed to sell
the music on iTunes for 99 cents
apiece to now give it away for free."
The numbers have proved Ek
right. While the average American
spends $l3 a year on music, the
"premium" Spotify user pays $l2O.
"This allows us to compensate
the right-holders the way they
should be for the great job they are
doing," Ek said.
Responding to a question from
the audience on whether Spotify
might save the music industry, Ek
said that the move away from phys
ically purchasing music has created
a need for innovation in the sector.
"Sweden, the first country
where Spotify was implemented, is
now one of the few countries that
have a growing music industry," he
pointed out.
Ek also discussed the future of
piracy, which he acknowledged as
Spotify's biggest competitor.
"Most people want conven
ience and easy access [to music],"
Ek said. "With Spotify, people can
feel that they have all the world's
music in their music library."
He argued, however, that un
less the television and movie in
dustries work actively to solve the
same problems the music industry
is facing, illegal downloading will
persist.
"I cannot accept that it takes a
year for a great TV show like
'Game of Thrones' to be seen in
Europe," Ek said. "I want content
to be readily available, and if I am
willing to pay for it, why not?"
Ek concluded his talk by en
couraging audience members to fix
the issue, and pursue non-piracy so
lutions to the problem.

services like Napster and Kazaa
around the millennium shift, it was
clear to me that people wanted to
consume music this way, on-de
mand and readily available," Ek ex
plained.
The fast Internet infrastructure
in Sweden led Ek to found Spotify
together with Martin Lorentzon
there in 2004.
"Our goal was to create servers
that were faster than the pirate
servers," he said. "We thought that
if we managed to do this, we could
get a big chunk of the 500 million
people who consumed music ille
gally."
Ek said he thought that the
problem was not that people did
not want to pay for music, but
rather that an efficient and conven
ient platform for doing so was un
available at the time.
"Because I was young and
naive, I just thought 'Hey, this can't
be too hard,' but realized soon
enough all the problems that arise
from creating a service like Spoti
fy," Ek joked. "I did not even know
that you needed licenses from the
major [record labels]!"
Getting permission from record
labels has been Spotify's single
largest problem to date. The negoti
ations with Universal took over a
year, and Spotify has yet to acquire
the rights from bands such as the
Beatles or Led Zeppelin.
"We were convinced that our
model would work, and that majors
would make profits from letting us
use their content," Ek said. "But try

for yourself to go and tell a 67-year
old man who barely agreed to sell
the music on iTunes for 99 cents
apiece to now give it away for free."
The numbers have proved Ek
right. While the average American
spends $l3 a year on music, the
"premium" Spotify user pays $l2O.
"This allows us to compensate
the right-holders the way they
should be for the great job they are
doing," Ek said.
Responding to a question from
the audience on whether Spotify
might save the music industry, Ek
said that the move away from phys
ically purchasing music has created
a need for innovation in the sector.
"Sweden, the first country
where Spotify was implemented, is
now one of the few countries that
have a growing music industry," he
pointed out.
Ek also discussed the future of
piracy, which he acknowledged as
Spotify's biggest competitor.
"Most people want conven
ience and easy access [to music],"
Ek said. "With Spotify, people can
feel that they have all the world's
music in their music library."
He argued, however, that un
less the television and movie in
dustries work actively to solve the
same problems the music industry
is facing, illegal downloading will
persist.
"I cannot accept that it takes a
year for a great TV show like
'Game of Thrones' to be seen in
Europe," Ek said. "I want content
to be readily available, and if I am
willing to pay for it, why not?"
Ek concluded his talk by en
couraging audience members to fix
the issue, and pursue non-piracy so
lutions to the problem.
