# NEWS BRIEF
## GSC extends NomCom terms 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marshall Watkins 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) voted Wednesday evening in
favor of extending current Nomina
tions Commission (NomCom) ap
pointees' terms until June 17 or the
completion of the current nomina
tions cycle. The meeting was the
GSC's first since the transition from
last year's representatives on Sunday.
Under the GSC bill, new ap
pointees to NomCom will be jointly
selected by the ASSU Executive, the
GSC co-chairs and the Undergradu
ate Senate chair.
The interim measure which
garnered eight votes in favor and one
abstention from GSC representatives
was necessary to ensure student
representatives for more than 40 Uni
versity committees are nominated.
The 13th Senate told this year's
NomCom that the committee's re
sponsibilities would be dissolved at
the end of the year, likely in anticipa
tion of an ultimately unsuccessful at
tempt at formulating an updated
ASSU Constitution. As such, the Sen
ate didn't recruit new NomCom
members after the commission's term
ended, expecting a revised format
under the new Constitution.
The GSC bill echoed the at
tempts of the 14th Undergraduate
Senate to address the issue Tues
day evening.The Senate passed the
same bill reinstating members
of the outgoing NomCom as an
interim measure.
Other options, such as nominat
ing ASSU President Robbie Zim
broff 'l2 as unilateral chair of an in
terim commission, were rejected
by Senators on the grounds that
they would defy ASSU bylaws.
