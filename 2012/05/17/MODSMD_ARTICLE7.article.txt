## Faculty examine Obama support forgay marriage Hoover fellows say impact questionable, campus groups mobilize in response 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
President Barack Obama's recent announce
ment of his support for gay marriage was a natu
ral step for his presidential campaign, according
to Stanford community observers. Several
Hoover fellows and students weighed in on the
announcement, its timing and its implications for
the upcoming election.
The timing of the announcement, shortly after
Vice President Joe Biden endorsed gay marriage
and North Carolina voters passed a constitution
al amendment rejecting same-sex marriage, was
more unexpected.
"North Carolina sort of forced his hand," said
Tammy Frisby, a research fellow at the Hoover
Institution. "Advocates for gay rights were un
happy [by the amendment] and turned to their
president."
Bill Whalen, also a research fellow at the
Hoover Institution, downplayed the ground
breaking nature of the announcement, noting
that Obama had dropped numerous hints of his
shifting perspective on the issue.
"When he ran for president, he said he was
opposed," Whalen said. "He's been 'evolving.'"
Frisby noted that the announcement would
likely resonate disproportionately among col
lege-age students, who have historically been
more socially liberal.
"College students are excited," Frisby said,
"because this is an issue on which the majority of
youth fall on the pro-gay rights side."
Lindsay Lamont 'l3, president of the Stanford
Democrats, said that Democrats on campus were
delighted by the announcement.
"I'm surprised that he came out and was
forthright about it, but I'm also really proud,"
Lamont said.
Lamont acknowledged that the move might
harm Obama's electoral standing in states like
North Carolina which voted Democratic in
2008 but expressed support for the announce
ment's motivation.
"I think he wanted to be clear about his inten
tions and this shows how far the country has
come, but it's still risky," Lamont said.
Frisby added that the announcement might
also diminish Obama's backing among Hispanic
and African American voters, who tend to be
more socially conservative but who turned out
overwhelmingly in favor of Obama in 2008.
Kyle Huwa 'l3, president of the Stanford
Conservative Society, said that the conservative
community on campus intends to focus on eco
nomic and domestic policy issues rather than so
cial matters, and framed the announcement as
politically calculated.
"They sent out Biden first to test the waters
and once he was received highly, Obama was
able to come out," Huwa said.
Frisby framed the announcement as a means
of providing an alternate focus on social issues in
an election frequently touted especially by
Republicans as one offering competing eco
nomic philosophies.
"The election will be constrained by the econ
omy," Frisby said. "In the past, if the economy is
doing well, voters vote for the incumbent. If it's
not doing well, they kick him out."
With the presidential election still six months
away, the announcement could have uncertain
ramifications in size and direction.
"We just don't know which way it will sway,"
Frisby said.
"It's advantageous for Obama to put some of
