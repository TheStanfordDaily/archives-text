'Protecting her own'
While Hine's friends remembered her
bluntness about voicing her thoughts, they
recalled fondly that not everything she
said was true. Prone to exaggerations and
half-truths, Hine's provocative proclama
tions often served as a means of protection
for herself and more often, for others.
"Cady wasn't 'truthy,'" Calvo said. "She
didn't shy away from something that had
to be said but there were times when she
had the gall to say things that were outra
geous and openly nonfactual, but she
would do it to protect her own."
During Hine's residency in Enchanted
Broccoli Forest (EBF), she was known for
keeping pet chinchillas in her room
against housing regulations.
"There was a fire alarm one day, she
ran outside of the house and had them
clutched to her chest to save them... She
would have felt terrible if they died, but
there was no fire. Stanford Housing sent
out their person to see if there was really a
fire. Cady had more gall than anyone I
ever knew the housing guy came up
and was like 'Are those animals?' at point
blank range, and she just looked into his
eyes and said,' Stuffed animals,"' Calvo re
called.
"She never got reported," Calvo said. "I
don't think she had to get rid of them."
Calvo then recounted the tale of Hine's
year in Escondido Village's (EV) 'couples
with children' housing, during her brief en
gagement to a student she met at Foothill
College.
"They came up with a story to get fam
ily housing that she was pregnant,"
said Arthur Alvarez, a Stanford under
graduate whom Hine listed as her Stan
ford emergency contact after befriending
him during her freshman year. "Her real
baby was three or four chinchillas and
two rabbits."
Calvo said that by June, when Housing
discovered Hine's ruse, Hine had ended
her engagement and was renting out her
EV apartment to a UC student. Stanford
Housing then terminated her contract.
'Anything to survive'
Hine's friends described her dark sense

I ' tanford undergraduate Cady
Jeanne Hine died of an undis
closed accident at her home in
( 1 PaloAltoonAprillattheage
of 24. A junior English major,
Hine battled severe bipolar disorder, drug
addiction and grief over her mother's sui
cide, which led her to take multiple leaves
of absence. An op-ed by University staff
last month ("Another loss," April 17)
noted Hine's contributions to improving
mental health on campus through the
founding of Stanford Peace of Mind
(SPOM). Hine's close friends and class
mates reflected on her impact on their
lives, painting a picture of a wild, selective
ly honest, fiercely loyal and trusting
friend.
'She always did weird very well'
Edwin Smolski 'O7 described his first
encounter with Hine at Stanford Hospital
and commented on Hine's tendency to
disregard social propriety in favor of say
ing what was on her mind.
"I remember that she would say things
that you'd think were inappropriate,"
Smolski said. "But people would always
crack up when she would say them, but
[her words] were a little bit more than
that."
"She was the kind of friend ... [who]
had a huge presence," said Helena Bonde
'l2. "She'd come into your life and she'd
just grab hold of it. She was never one for
holding anything back."
Bonde met Hine in 2008, when the lat
ter returned to Stanford to finish her last
quarter of Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) after taking multiple leaves of ab
sence. The two bonded over shared expe
riences of familial loss and grief.
"Normally I'm afraid that even talking
about the troubles I've had in the past or in
the present is just going to alienate other
people," Bonde said. "But with Cady it was
the opposite —it brought us closer to
gether."
Smolski recalled that following the
death of her mother, Hine displayed an
urn with her mother's ashes wherever she
was living, allowing guests to open it and
view the ashes.
"She made me see a different kind of
reverence that wouldn't necessarily follow
the lines of what people would normally
see... I feel that really made me think
about the preconceived notions I had in
terms of loss and grief and feeling difficult
things, what's appropriate and what's not,"
Smolski said.
Hine was also known for her sharp wit
and adventurous spirit.
"There was always some adventure she
would lead us on," said Jack Cackler 'O9, a
SLE classmate. "She just had a zest for life
and an enthusiasm that was kind of fun to
be around."
Hine's free-spiritedness made her an ir
replaceable friend.
"If Cady couldn't hang out with you,
there was no one else who would fit that
role," said Leah Calvo 'O9, who befriended
Hine during their freshman year. "It was
like, 'Oh crap, no Cady. Who else do I call?
I don't know anyone who would enjoy that
show or enjoy that movie.'"
"She always did weird very well [and
was] very comfortable with people who
didn't fit [into] other people's categories,"
Calvo added.

of humor, but also said that her willingness
to help anyone in need and her struggles
with personal tragedy were challenges for
Hine.
According to Bonde, Hine was severe
ly bipolar and struggled with heroin addic
tion.
"I know that there were drugs at times
and I know that some of that very well may
have been self-medicating for some of the
pain and trauma she'd been through,"

Calvo said, noting that she and her moth
er, a doctor, once helped Hine research
and check into a rehabilitation facility.
Bonde said Hine had been clean for
almost two years by the time of her death.
Alvarez said Hine was adamant about
coming back to Stanford the fall follow
ing her mother's death instead of taking
time off.
"I thought that was very brave of her,"
he said, commenting on Hine's coping
strategies. "Her way of coping was through
humor, which was fine but awkward for
some."
Calvo shared an example of this black
humor when Hine revealed to her that
she had attempted suicide on campus.

Hi

"The way she said it was 'Yeah, I tried
to hang myself, but my roommate walked
in,'" Calvo recalled. "She made that so
funny. It was basically like 'Duh, I tried to
kill myself and it failed.' She always made
me laugh about the darkest things."
Bonde said that even during times of
suicidal thoughts, Hine reached out for
help.
"Even when she attempted suicide, she
did everything else first," Bonde said. "She
went and got help, she knew about the re
sources on campus and she took advan
tage of them."
Philip Vuong, a former Stanford stu
dent and a close friend of Hine, said that
Hine 'would do whatever it takes to sur
vive,' including a series of odd jobs to sup
port her attendance at Stanford.
"She was a stripper she whipped
men for a living she worked as a domi
natrix," Vuong said.
Alvarez recounted going with his part
ner, Smolski, and Hine to strip clubs in the
area for auditions, laughing nostalgically
at the memory.
"Her big thing was always 'How do I
fund myself?"' Alvarez said. "I do not
know how she got away with a lot of things
she did."
Alvarez and Calvo noted with humor
more of Hine's odd jobs.
"She also worked as a fairy princess for
children's parties," Calvo said. "She was so
beautiful the girls always loved her."
Calvo said that Hine often tried to take
care of others, even at the expense of her
own well-being. Calvo, Bonde, Alvarez
and Vuong all noted that people frequent
ly took advantage of Hine's trust.
"She would run in and was always
ready to make a difference and always
ready to help people who had been
through bad things," Calvo added. "Some
times she overstretched her capacity in
helping people or she would help them
so much that she would be off balance,"
she added.
'Absurdly lucky to have known her'
None of Hine's close friends who
spoke with The Daily were seriously in
volved with SPOM. Most commented
that her legacy with the student group is
likely the same as in their circle of friend
ship.
"Especially at the funeral, I just heard
a lot of people say things like 'Cady made
me feel like it was okay for me to talk
about this or that,'" Bonde said.
"She lived life in the moment and
made her decisions as she went along," Al
varez said. "She didn't apologize very
much."
Vuong held that Hine was not a 'mar
tyr' for mental health.
"I don't want her to be remembered as
a mental health case," Vuong said, re
counting a conversation he and Hine had
on his last birthday. "I asked her the mean
ing of her life. 'Have fun, enjoy the ride.
Sleep around, do drugs.' It was a funny an
swer."
" [She was] a little wild, erratic. She did
n't have the most stable life, but she defi
nitely had one of the more interesting
lives I knew," Calvo said. "I feel so lucky to
have known her absurdly lucky. I don't
think I'll ever meet someone like that
again someone who is so free, yet so
haunted at the same time."

gagement to a student she met at Foothill
College.
"They came up with a story to get fam
ily housing that she was pregnant,"
said Arthur Alvarez, a Stanford under
graduate whom Hine listed as her Stan
ford emergency contact after befriending
him during her freshman year. "Her real
baby was three or four chinchillas and
two rabbits."
Calvo said that by June, when Housing
discovered Hine's ruse, Hine had ended
her engagement and was renting out her
EV apartment to a UC student. Stanford
Housing then terminated her contract.
'Anything to survive'
Hine's friends described her dark sense

I ' tanford undergraduate Cady
Jeanne Hine died of an undis
closed accident at her home in
( 1 PaloAltoonAprillattheage
of 24. A junior English major,
Hine battled severe bipolar disorder, drug
addiction and grief over her mother's sui
cide, which led her to take multiple leaves
of absence. An op-ed by University staff
last month ("Another loss," April 17)
noted Hine's contributions to improving
mental health on campus through the
founding of Stanford Peace of Mind
(SPOM). Hine's close friends and class
mates reflected on her impact on their
lives, painting a picture of a wild, selective
ly honest, fiercely loyal and trusting
friend.
'She always did weird very well'
Edwin Smolski 'O7 described his first
encounter with Hine at Stanford Hospital
and commented on Hine's tendency to
disregard social propriety in favor of say
ing what was on her mind.
"I remember that she would say things
that you'd think were inappropriate,"
Smolski said. "But people would always
crack up when she would say them, but
[her words] were a little bit more than
that."
"She was the kind of friend ... [who]
had a huge presence," said Helena Bonde
'l2. "She'd come into your life and she'd
just grab hold of it. She was never one for
holding anything back."
Bonde met Hine in 2008, when the lat
ter returned to Stanford to finish her last
quarter of Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) after taking multiple leaves of ab
sence. The two bonded over shared expe
riences of familial loss and grief.
"Normally I'm afraid that even talking
about the troubles I've had in the past or in
the present is just going to alienate other
people," Bonde said. "But with Cady it was
the opposite —it brought us closer to
gether."
Smolski recalled that following the
death of her mother, Hine displayed an
urn with her mother's ashes wherever she
was living, allowing guests to open it and
view the ashes.
"She made me see a different kind of
reverence that wouldn't necessarily follow
the lines of what people would normally
see... I feel that really made me think
about the preconceived notions I had in
terms of loss and grief and feeling difficult
things, what's appropriate and what's not,"
Smolski said.
Hine was also known for her sharp wit
and adventurous spirit.
"There was always some adventure she
would lead us on," said Jack Cackler 'O9, a
SLE classmate. "She just had a zest for life
and an enthusiasm that was kind of fun to
be around."
Hine's free-spiritedness made her an ir
replaceable friend.
"If Cady couldn't hang out with you,
there was no one else who would fit that
role," said Leah Calvo 'O9, who befriended
Hine during their freshman year. "It was
like, 'Oh crap, no Cady. Who else do I call?
I don't know anyone who would enjoy that
show or enjoy that movie.'"
"She always did weird very well [and
was] very comfortable with people who
didn't fit [into] other people's categories,"
Calvo added.

of humor, but also said that her willingness
to help anyone in need and her struggles
with personal tragedy were challenges for
Hine.
According to Bonde, Hine was severe
ly bipolar and struggled with heroin addic
tion.
"I know that there were drugs at times
and I know that some of that very well may
have been self-medicating for some of the
pain and trauma she'd been through,"

Calvo said, noting that she and her moth
er, a doctor, once helped Hine research
and check into a rehabilitation facility.
Bonde said Hine had been clean for
almost two years by the time of her death.
Alvarez said Hine was adamant about
coming back to Stanford the fall follow
ing her mother's death instead of taking
time off.
"I thought that was very brave of her,"
he said, commenting on Hine's coping
strategies. "Her way of coping was through
humor, which was fine but awkward for
some."
Calvo shared an example of this black
humor when Hine revealed to her that
she had attempted suicide on campus.

Hi

"The way she said it was 'Yeah, I tried
to hang myself, but my roommate walked
in,'" Calvo recalled. "She made that so
funny. It was basically like 'Duh, I tried to
kill myself and it failed.' She always made
me laugh about the darkest things."
Bonde said that even during times of
suicidal thoughts, Hine reached out for
help.
"Even when she attempted suicide, she
did everything else first," Bonde said. "She
went and got help, she knew about the re
sources on campus and she took advan
tage of them."
Philip Vuong, a former Stanford stu
dent and a close friend of Hine, said that
Hine 'would do whatever it takes to sur
vive,' including a series of odd jobs to sup
port her attendance at Stanford.
"She was a stripper she whipped
men for a living she worked as a domi
natrix," Vuong said.
Alvarez recounted going with his part
ner, Smolski, and Hine to strip clubs in the
area for auditions, laughing nostalgically
at the memory.
"Her big thing was always 'How do I
fund myself?"' Alvarez said. "I do not
know how she got away with a lot of things
she did."
Alvarez and Calvo noted with humor
more of Hine's odd jobs.
"She also worked as a fairy princess for
children's parties," Calvo said. "She was so
beautiful the girls always loved her."
Calvo said that Hine often tried to take
care of others, even at the expense of her
own well-being. Calvo, Bonde, Alvarez
and Vuong all noted that people frequent
ly took advantage of Hine's trust.
"She would run in and was always
ready to make a difference and always
ready to help people who had been
through bad things," Calvo added. "Some
times she overstretched her capacity in
helping people or she would help them
so much that she would be off balance,"
she added.
'Absurdly lucky to have known her'
None of Hine's close friends who
spoke with The Daily were seriously in
volved with SPOM. Most commented
that her legacy with the student group is
likely the same as in their circle of friend
ship.
"Especially at the funeral, I just heard
a lot of people say things like 'Cady made
me feel like it was okay for me to talk
about this or that,'" Bonde said.
"She lived life in the moment and
made her decisions as she went along," Al
varez said. "She didn't apologize very
much."
Vuong held that Hine was not a 'mar
tyr' for mental health.
"I don't want her to be remembered as
a mental health case," Vuong said, re
counting a conversation he and Hine had
on his last birthday. "I asked her the mean
ing of her life. 'Have fun, enjoy the ride.
Sleep around, do drugs.' It was a funny an
swer."
" [She was] a little wild, erratic. She did
n't have the most stable life, but she defi
nitely had one of the more interesting
lives I knew," Calvo said. "I feel so lucky to
have known her absurdly lucky. I don't
think I'll ever meet someone like that
again someone who is so free, yet so
haunted at the same time."

'Protecting her own'
While Hine's friends remembered her
bluntness about voicing her thoughts, they
recalled fondly that not everything she
said was true. Prone to exaggerations and
half-truths, Hine's provocative proclama
tions often served as a means of protection
for herself and more often, for others.
"Cady wasn't 'truthy,'" Calvo said. "She
didn't shy away from something that had
to be said but there were times when she
had the gall to say things that were outra
geous and openly nonfactual, but she
would do it to protect her own."
During Hine's residency in Enchanted
Broccoli Forest (EBF), she was known for
keeping pet chinchillas in her room
against housing regulations.
"There was a fire alarm one day, she
ran outside of the house and had them
clutched to her chest to save them... She
would have felt terrible if they died, but
there was no fire. Stanford Housing sent
out their person to see if there was really a
fire. Cady had more gall than anyone I
ever knew the housing guy came up
and was like 'Are those animals?' at point
blank range, and she just looked into his
eyes and said,' Stuffed animals,"' Calvo re
called.
"She never got reported," Calvo said. "I
don't think she had to get rid of them."
Calvo then recounted the tale of Hine's
year in Escondido Village's (EV) 'couples

disregard social propriety in favor of say
ing what was on her mind.
"I remember that she would say things
that you'd think were inappropriate,"
Smolski said. "But people would always
crack up when she would say them, but
[her words] were a little bit more than
that."
"She was the kind of friend ... [who]
had a huge presence," said Helena Bonde
'l2. "She'd come into your life and she'd
just grab hold of it. She was never one for
holding anything back."
Bonde met Hine in 2008, when the lat
ter returned to Stanford to finish her last
quarter of Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) after taking multiple leaves of ab
sence. The two bonded over shared expe
riences of familial loss and grief.
"Normally I'm afraid that even talking
about the troubles I've had in the past or in
the present is just going to alienate other
people," Bonde said. "But with Cady it was
the opposite —it brought us closer to
gether."
Smolski recalled that following the
death of her mother, Hine displayed an
urn with her mother's ashes wherever she
was living, allowing guests to open it and
view the ashes.
"She made me see a different kind of
reverence that wouldn't necessarily follow
the lines of what people would normally
see... I feel that really made me think
about the preconceived notions I had in
terms of loss and grief and feeling difficult
things, what's appropriate and what's not,"
Smolski said.
Hine was also known for her sharp wit
and adventurous spirit.
"There was always some adventure she
would lead us on," said Jack Cackler 'O9, a
SLE classmate. "She just had a zest for life
and an enthusiasm that was kind of fun to
be around."
Hine's free-spiritedness made her an ir
replaceable friend.
"If Cady couldn't hang out with you,
there was no one else who would fit that
role," said Leah Calvo 'O9, who befriended
Hine during their freshman year. "It was
like, 'Oh crap, no Cady. Who else do I call?
I don't know anyone who would enjoy that
show or enjoy that movie.'"
"She always did weird very well [and
was] very comfortable with people who
didn't fit [into] other people's categories,"
Calvo added.

of humor, but also said that her willingness
to help anyone in need and her struggles
with personal tragedy were challenges for
Hine.
According to Bonde, Hine was severe
ly bipolar and struggled with heroin addic
tion.
"I know that there were drugs at times
and I know that some of that very well may
have been self-medicating for some of the
pain and trauma she'd been through,"

Calvo said, noting that she and her moth
er, a doctor, once helped Hine research
and check into a rehabilitation facility.
Bonde said Hine had been clean for
almost two years by the time of her death.
Alvarez said Hine was adamant about
coming back to Stanford the fall follow
ing her mother's death instead of taking
time off.
"I thought that was very brave of her,"
he said, commenting on Hine's coping
strategies. "Her way of coping was through
humor, which was fine but awkward for
some."
Calvo shared an example of this black
humor when Hine revealed to her that
she had attempted suicide on campus.

Hi

"The way she said it was 'Yeah, I tried
to hang myself, but my roommate walked
in,'" Calvo recalled. "She made that so
funny. It was basically like 'Duh, I tried to
kill myself and it failed.' She always made
me laugh about the darkest things."
Bonde said that even during times of
suicidal thoughts, Hine reached out for
help.
"Even when she attempted suicide, she
did everything else first," Bonde said. "She
went and got help, she knew about the re
sources on campus and she took advan
tage of them."
Philip Vuong, a former Stanford stu
dent and a close friend of Hine, said that
Hine 'would do whatever it takes to sur
vive,' including a series of odd jobs to sup
port her attendance at Stanford.
"She was a stripper she whipped
men for a living she worked as a domi
natrix," Vuong said.
Alvarez recounted going with his part
ner, Smolski, and Hine to strip clubs in the
area for auditions, laughing nostalgically
at the memory.
"Her big thing was always 'How do I
fund myself?"' Alvarez said. "I do not
know how she got away with a lot of things
she did."
Alvarez and Calvo noted with humor
more of Hine's odd jobs.
"She also worked as a fairy princess for
children's parties," Calvo said. "She was so
beautiful the girls always loved her."
Calvo said that Hine often tried to take
care of others, even at the expense of her
own well-being. Calvo, Bonde, Alvarez
and Vuong all noted that people frequent
ly took advantage of Hine's trust.
"She would run in and was always
ready to make a difference and always
ready to help people who had been
through bad things," Calvo added. "Some
times she overstretched her capacity in
helping people or she would help them
so much that she would be off balance,"
she added.
'Absurdly lucky to have known her'
None of Hine's close friends who
spoke with The Daily were seriously in
volved with SPOM. Most commented
that her legacy with the student group is
likely the same as in their circle of friend
ship.
"Especially at the funeral, I just heard
a lot of people say things like 'Cady made
me feel like it was okay for me to talk
about this or that,'" Bonde said.
"She lived life in the moment and
made her decisions as she went along," Al
varez said. "She didn't apologize very
much."
Vuong held that Hine was not a 'mar
tyr' for mental health.
"I don't want her to be remembered as
a mental health case," Vuong said, re
counting a conversation he and Hine had
on his last birthday. "I asked her the mean
ing of her life. 'Have fun, enjoy the ride.
Sleep around, do drugs.' It was a funny an
swer."
" [She was] a little wild, erratic. She did
n't have the most stable life, but she defi
nitely had one of the more interesting
lives I knew," Calvo said. "I feel so lucky to
have known her absurdly lucky. I don't
think I'll ever meet someone like that
again someone who is so free, yet so
haunted at the same time."

'Protecting her own'
While Hine's friends remembered her
bluntness about voicing her thoughts, they
recalled fondly that not everything she
said was true. Prone to exaggerations and
half-truths, Hine's provocative proclama
tions often served as a means of protection
for herself and more often, for others.
"Cady wasn't 'truthy,'" Calvo said. "She
didn't shy away from something that had
to be said but there were times when she
had the gall to say things that were outra
geous and openly nonfactual, but she
would do it to protect her own."
During Hine's residency in Enchanted
Broccoli Forest (EBF), she was known for
keeping pet chinchillas in her room
against housing regulations.
"There was a fire alarm one day, she
ran outside of the house and had them
clutched to her chest to save them... She
would have felt terrible if they died, but
there was no fire. Stanford Housing sent
out their person to see if there was really a
fire. Cady had more gall than anyone I
ever knew the housing guy came up
and was like 'Are those animals?' at point
blank range, and she just looked into his
eyes and said,' Stuffed animals,"' Calvo re
called.
"She never got reported," Calvo said. "I
don't think she had to get rid of them."
Calvo then recounted the tale of Hine's
year in Escondido Village's (EV) 'couples
with children' housing, during her brief en
gagement to a student she met at Foothill
College.
"They came up with a story to get fam
ily housing that she was pregnant,"
said Arthur Alvarez, a Stanford under
graduate whom Hine listed as her Stan
ford emergency contact after befriending
him during her freshman year. "Her real
baby was three or four chinchillas and
two rabbits."
Calvo said that by June, when Housing
discovered Hine's ruse, Hine had ended
her engagement and was renting out her
EV apartment to a UC student. Stanford
Housing then terminated her contract.
'Anything to survive'
Hine's friends described her dark sense

I ' tanford undergraduate Cady
Jeanne Hine died of an undis
closed accident at her home in
( 1 PaloAltoonAprillattheage
of 24. A junior English major,
Hine battled severe bipolar disorder, drug
addiction and grief over her mother's sui
cide, which led her to take multiple leaves
of absence. An op-ed by University staff
last month ("Another loss," April 17)
noted Hine's contributions to improving
mental health on campus through the
founding of Stanford Peace of Mind
(SPOM). Hine's close friends and class
mates reflected on her impact on their
lives, painting a picture of a wild, selective
ly honest, fiercely loyal and trusting
friend.
