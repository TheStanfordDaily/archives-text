Genius Egg Donor Wanted
to help us build our family
excellent compensation
Email: williamn@alumni.stanford.edu for more information.
We are a couple seeking a high-achiever egg donor to help build our family.
You should have high standardized test scores, and preferably have some
outstanding acheivements and awards.
You should be between 18-35 years old.
An example of our ideal egg donor:
21 year old Stanford student with A grade point average, near-perfect
SAT score, several awards in high school and University. She wants to
be an egg donor in order to help bring a child into the world with the
same special gifts she has.
Your eggs will be fertilized with sperm from the husband, and the resulting
embryos used to impregnate the wife, or possibly a surrogate mother.
About us:
We arc a highly educated couple, hut we are unable to have children due
to infertility of the wife. The husband is a highly accomplished
scientist/mathematician and businessman, the wife has a good
graduate-level university degree.
We value education, and we live in one of the best school districts in the
world. We hope that our child will be a top student, as each of us was,
and that he/she will be able to go to university at Stanford or other lop
university.
