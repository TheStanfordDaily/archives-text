# OP-ED
## Where is Stanford's sense of community? 
### 
Ken Auletta wrote an article
for The New Yorker ("Get
Rich U," April 30,2012) that
makes every Stanford parent even
prouder to be a Stanford parent,
and every wannabe Stanford par
ent make their high school junior
take three extra full-length prac
tice SATs. He described Stanford's
relationship with Silicon Valley
and its place as an incubator of
technological innovation and cre
ativity. The relationship to Silicon
Valley corporations and ensuing
conflict of interests aside (that is
the subject of an entirely different
op-ed), Auletta described accu
rately how Stanford's successes, at
their core, are based on collabora
tion, communication, teamwork
and friendship. Kevin Systrom and
Mike Krieger, the founders of In
stagram, provide one example of a
perfect co-founder match one
had the idea, the other brought a
complementary engineering skill
set. And let's not forget other fa
mous Silicon Valley pairs who have
made their mark: Sergei and Larry,
David and Bill. Sergei Brin and
Larry Page, Bill Hewlett and
David Packard, that is.
The photo of d.school graduate
students that accompanied the ar

ticle perfectly symbolizes Stan
ford's obsession with a word that is
rarely used in the context of engi
neering. Stanford is the epicenter
of the Silicon Valley engineering
community, a group of individuals
sharing common occupations, geo
graphical location, interests and
values. When President Obama
visited Silicon Valley, he sat down
to dinner with the leaders of this
community, now captured in an
iconic photograph. Together with
Bill, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg,
our very own University President
John Hennessy, and other promi
nent Valley leaders, Obama raised
his glass to toast. But more impor
tantly, he acknowledged the way
this community has fundamentally
changed the way we live.
As the breeding ground for "fu
ture leaders," another catch phrase
that can be heard almost every five
seconds somewhere on the Farm.it
makes natural sense that part of
Stanford's educational philosophy
ought to include values like com
munication, negotiation, accounta
bility and teamwork. If it's cooper
ation that spawns innovation, it
makes sense that these lessons,
