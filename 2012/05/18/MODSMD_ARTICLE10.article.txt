# OP-ED
## Where is Stanford's sense of community? 
### 
Ken Auletta wrote an article
for The New Yorker ("Get
Rich U," April 30,2012) that
makes every Stanford parent even
prouder to be a Stanford parent,
and every wannabe Stanford par
ent make their high school junior
take three extra full-length prac
tice SATs. He described Stanford's
relationship with Silicon Valley
and its place as an incubator of
technological innovation and cre
ativity. The relationship to Silicon
Valley corporations and ensuing
conflict of interests aside (that is
the subject of an entirely different
op-ed), Auletta described accu
rately how Stanford's successes, at
their core, are based on collabora
tion, communication, teamwork
and friendship. Kevin Systrom and
Mike Krieger, the founders of In
stagram, provide one example of a
perfect co-founder match one
had the idea, the other brought a
complementary engineering skill
set. And let's not forget other fa
mous Silicon Valley pairs who have
made their mark: Sergei and Larry,
David and Bill. Sergei Brin and
Larry Page, Bill Hewlett and
David Packard, that is.
The photo of d.school graduate
students that accompanied the ar

ticle perfectly symbolizes Stan
ford's obsession with a word that is
rarely used in the context of engi
neering. Stanford is the epicenter
of the Silicon Valley engineering
community, a group of individuals
sharing common occupations, geo
graphical location, interests and
values. When President Obama
visited Silicon Valley, he sat down
to dinner with the leaders of this
community, now captured in an
iconic photograph. Together with
Bill, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg,
our very own University President
John Hennessy, and other promi
nent Valley leaders, Obama raised
his glass to toast. But more impor
tantly, he acknowledged the way
this community has fundamentally
changed the way we live.
As the breeding ground for "fu
ture leaders," another catch phrase
that can be heard almost every five
seconds somewhere on the Farm.it
makes natural sense that part of
Stanford's educational philosophy
ought to include values like com
munication, negotiation, accounta
bility and teamwork. If it's cooper
ation that spawns innovation, it
makes sense that these lessons,
most effectively taught outside the
classroom, be incorporated into
Stanford undergraduate life. How
should Stanford build communi
ty?

An entire department of the
Office of Student Affairs is dedi
cated to cultivating a rich and
meaningful residential experience
at Stanford, Residential Educa
tion. Through themed houses, Res
ident Fellows and dorm staff,
ResEd tries to create mini-com
munities that fit students' needs.
It's funny, though, how an institu
tion that prides itself on commit
ment to community left me "com
munity-less" for two of my under
graduate years. I lived in Yost my
sophomore year; I shared a room
with my best friend, and yet, I'd
never felt so alone. I didn't learn
the names of the other residents in
the dorm until the middle of win
ter quarter, and I can't even know
for sure that I knew everyone's
name because I think there were
some residents that I never met.
They will forever remain, in my
eyes, the "Ghosts of Yost."
Abroad at Oxford the fall of my
junior year, with nothing to glue
the residents together into a cohe
sive unit, I felt that I never really
belonged to one of the many
cliques that emerged in the second
and third week. It didn't help that

when I returned to campus, I was
assigned to live in Oak Creek, two
miles away from the heart of cam
pus. It wasn't until my senior year,
when I made the commitment to
live in a co-op as a resident in Chi
Theta Chi, that I felt like I truly be
longed and mattered. If I didn't do
my weekly chore, everyone cared.
And if I didn't show up to my cook
crew, my housemates worried.
As much as Stanford empha
sizes community in its academic
and entrepreneurial pursuits, I
didn't find community until my
final year. Stanford also struggles
to provide students with an ade
quate mental health support sys
tem, as has been covered exten
sively in the pages of this paper. If
loneliness is a feeling more preva
lent on this campus than we may
acknowledge, then what should
residential life at Stanford look
like? How can Stanford build true,
genuine communities that teach
students compassion and account
ability while encouraging inde
pendence and creativity?
We are a generation that
spends more time on the comput
er than doing just about anything
else. We ask each other out on
dates via email and via text, if we
ask each other out on a proper
date at all. So I question the motive
behind some of Stanford's recent
actions. Is threatening to paint
over the murals at the "Social Ac
tion through Non-violence" co
operative, Columbae, going to
teach students about building
community? Does revoking the

Chi Theta Chi lease show students
how effective open communica
tion and negotiation can be? Does
building a graduate residence like
Munger, that looks and feels more
like a hotel, make students feel at
home?

One new massive dining hall,
like Arrillaga Commons, may be a
more cost-effective and efficient
way to feed students, but making a
student feel like just another kid in
the buffet line doesn't spark my
creative appetite. Andreas
Weigend, former chief of technol
ogy at Amazon.com, director of
the Social Data Lab at Stanford,
and former Chi Theta Chi eating
associate writes,"Sharing is central
to humans. We eat together, learn
together, play together." Our stu
dents, the leaders of tomorrow,
need to know what it feels like to
sit at a dinner table and break
bread with their peers in a close
knit, intimate environment. Stu
dents need to feel like they own a
stake, otherwise they might just
pass through their Stanford expe
rience, like I did for my first three
years, without feeling anything. If
community is what cultivates in
novation, then this is where Stan
ford's focus should be. Because
chances are, one day after they've
founded and sold a company to
Facebook and made a few millions
more after investing in another,
they'll be invited to a private din
ner to share a toast with the presi
dent.

Ken Auletta wrote an article
for The New Yorker ("Get
Rich U," April 30,2012) that
makes every Stanford parent even
prouder to be a Stanford parent,
and every wannabe Stanford par
ent make their high school junior
take three extra full-length prac
tice SATs. He described Stanford's
relationship with Silicon Valley
and its place as an incubator of
technological innovation and cre
ativity. The relationship to Silicon
Valley corporations and ensuing
conflict of interests aside (that is
the subject of an entirely different
op-ed), Auletta described accu
rately how Stanford's successes, at
their core, are based on collabora
tion, communication, teamwork
and friendship. Kevin Systrom and
Mike Krieger, the founders of In
stagram, provide one example of a
perfect co-founder match one
had the idea, the other brought a
complementary engineering skill
set. And let's not forget other fa
mous Silicon Valley pairs who have
made their mark: Sergei and Larry,
David and Bill. Sergei Brin and
Larry Page, Bill Hewlett and
David Packard, that is.
The photo of d.school graduate
students that accompanied the ar

ticle perfectly symbolizes Stan
ford's obsession with a word that is
rarely used in the context of engi
neering. Stanford is the epicenter
of the Silicon Valley engineering
community, a group of individuals
sharing common occupations, geo
graphical location, interests and
values. When President Obama
visited Silicon Valley, he sat down
to dinner with the leaders of this
community, now captured in an
iconic photograph. Together with
Bill, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg,
our very own University President
John Hennessy, and other promi
nent Valley leaders, Obama raised
his glass to toast. But more impor
tantly, he acknowledged the way
this community has fundamentally
changed the way we live.
As the breeding ground for "fu
ture leaders," another catch phrase
that can be heard almost every five
seconds somewhere on the Farm.it
makes natural sense that part of
Stanford's educational philosophy
ought to include values like com
munication, negotiation, accounta
bility and teamwork. If it's cooper
ation that spawns innovation, it
makes sense that these lessons,
most effectively taught outside the
classroom, be incorporated into
Stanford undergraduate life. How
should Stanford build communi
ty?

An entire department of the
Office of Student Affairs is dedi
cated to cultivating a rich and
meaningful residential experience
at Stanford, Residential Educa
tion. Through themed houses, Res
ident Fellows and dorm staff,
ResEd tries to create mini-com
munities that fit students' needs.
It's funny, though, how an institu
tion that prides itself on commit
ment to community left me "com
munity-less" for two of my under
graduate years. I lived in Yost my
sophomore year; I shared a room
with my best friend, and yet, I'd
never felt so alone. I didn't learn
the names of the other residents in
the dorm until the middle of win
ter quarter, and I can't even know
for sure that I knew everyone's
name because I think there were
some residents that I never met.
They will forever remain, in my
eyes, the "Ghosts of Yost."
Abroad at Oxford the fall of my
junior year, with nothing to glue
the residents together into a cohe
sive unit, I felt that I never really
belonged to one of the many
cliques that emerged in the second
and third week. It didn't help that

when I returned to campus, I was
assigned to live in Oak Creek, two
miles away from the heart of cam
pus. It wasn't until my senior year,
when I made the commitment to
live in a co-op as a resident in Chi
Theta Chi, that I felt like I truly be
longed and mattered. If I didn't do
my weekly chore, everyone cared.
And if I didn't show up to my cook
crew, my housemates worried.
As much as Stanford empha
sizes community in its academic
and entrepreneurial pursuits, I
didn't find community until my
final year. Stanford also struggles
to provide students with an ade
quate mental health support sys
tem, as has been covered exten
sively in the pages of this paper. If
loneliness is a feeling more preva
lent on this campus than we may
acknowledge, then what should
residential life at Stanford look
like? How can Stanford build true,
genuine communities that teach
students compassion and account
ability while encouraging inde
pendence and creativity?
We are a generation that
spends more time on the comput
er than doing just about anything
else. We ask each other out on
dates via email and via text, if we
ask each other out on a proper
date at all. So I question the motive
behind some of Stanford's recent
actions. Is threatening to paint
over the murals at the "Social Ac
tion through Non-violence" co
operative, Columbae, going to
teach students about building
community? Does revoking the

Chi Theta Chi lease show students
how effective open communica
tion and negotiation can be? Does
building a graduate residence like
Munger, that looks and feels more
like a hotel, make students feel at
home?

One new massive dining hall,
like Arrillaga Commons, may be a
more cost-effective and efficient
way to feed students, but making a
student feel like just another kid in
the buffet line doesn't spark my
creative appetite. Andreas
Weigend, former chief of technol
ogy at Amazon.com, director of
the Social Data Lab at Stanford,
and former Chi Theta Chi eating
associate writes,"Sharing is central
to humans. We eat together, learn
together, play together." Our stu
dents, the leaders of tomorrow,
need to know what it feels like to
sit at a dinner table and break
bread with their peers in a close
knit, intimate environment. Stu
dents need to feel like they own a
stake, otherwise they might just
pass through their Stanford expe
rience, like I did for my first three
years, without feeling anything. If
community is what cultivates in
