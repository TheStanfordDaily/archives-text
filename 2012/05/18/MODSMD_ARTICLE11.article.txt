# MARKS MY WORDS
## Overcommitted? Get over it. 
### Miriam Marks 
If you asked any undergrad to
describe themself in one adjec
tive right now, they'd almost
definitely answer with "tired" or
"busy." Someone with a little
more creativity or a tendency to
ward being overdramatic will use
a better synonym exhausted,
swamped, crushed, etc. Pretty
much everyone on the Stanford
campus is some level of "busy."
But the question is, how does this
make you behave?
Think about a group project.
Let's say that you and four others
have to compile a paper together,
so you divide up the tasks in a rel
atively equal way. As soon as you
assign sections, someone tenta
tively frowns, slowly raises a hand
and fills you in.
"Hey, so, I'm sorry, but I'm ac
tually pretty busy right now. I'm
going to this conference and I'm
also taking 21 units. I'm the presi
dent of a student group, I have to
write five papers by next week
and I'm on my dorm's IM basket
ball team."

The weird thing is, the person
doesn't sound crushed and sad
dened by this looming specter of
work and the all-nighters that will
follow. This person sounds excit
ed, almost boastful, about how
terribly overcommitted they are.
"Look at me," they're saying, "I'm
so busy and important!"
Have you met the busy and im
portant Stanford undergrad?
Have you been one at some
point? Either way, you know what
I mean. My first thought when I
meet one of these students is:

"Congrats, you decided to take
too many classes!" or "Cool, you
chose to be in four student
groups!"

Because in the end being busy
at Stanford is a choice, a decision
that anyone can make. You can
sign up for 20 units of engineering
classes... if you want. You can
join 10 different student groups
they won't cross-check to see
what you're doing. You can even
go to every single on-campus sem
inar, conference and (free lunch)
event that you can find. No one

will stop you. And you'll be very,
very busy.

But the real issue, and one of
the most common symptoms of
the overcommitted student, is the
point where they can't under
stand how anyone else could pos
sibly be as busy as they are. The
students writing honors theses
look at you and scoff, "Um, you're
not writing an honors thesis.
You're not busy." The students on
the Undergraduate Senate roll
their eyes and say, "You're not on
ASSU; you're not busy at all." Re
peat for any overcommitted stu
dent: Their thing is the most im
portant, busy thing.
Suddenly people are so
wrapped up in their own sched
ules that anything you're doing is
completely unimportant. They
can slack off on the group project;
they can cut back on their duties
in an extracurricular group, and if
you subtly try to prod them into
doing something, you get a
lengthy explanation of how in
credibly busy they are. And since
you're not taking those classes,
managing those student groups
and going to those conferences,
you just don't get it. Sorry.

Sometimes this sets off a chain
reaction, and people start trying
to one-up each other. "You may
have 18 units and be president of
a student group, but I have 19
units and am president of two stu
dent groups! I don't have time for
this group project either!" Listen
ing to these kinds of competitions
just makes me want to take a nap.
And as group members take
turns explaining their schedules,
there'll always be a person or two
who doesn't speak up. Others see
this and think, "Why's she being
so quiet?" or "Why isn't he saying
how busy he is?" And therefore,
"They must not be busy."
False. Some people are busy,
but they're busy in different ways.
Maybe they're busy because they
choose to read in their spare time,
or to go to the gym regularly, or to
intentionally spend more time
with friends. Or maybe they're
just as busy with classes, student

groups and events, but they don't
feel the need to actively let every
one know. Not everyone who's
busy feels the need to let every
one know about it.

Now, I'm not suggesting that
being busy is a bad thing or that
Stanford students should all cut
back well, maybe that's not true.
If you can't find time to eat bal
anced meals, sleep more than five
hours every night and shower daily,
then you should cut back. And
there is something fun and exciting
about being busy, about rushing
from meeting to meeting and pack
ing your day with activities.
But instead of assuming that
you might be the busiest person
on campus, take a moment to ap
preciate that everyone here is
busy in some way or another.
Sure, you might not think that
their activities are as "important"
as yours are, but importance is
subjective. If you take pride in
how busy you are, at least have
some respect for others' busy
schedules.

If you email her at melloram@stan

most to reply. But she's pretty busy.

Beingbusyat
Stanford is a
choice, a decision
that anyone can
make.
