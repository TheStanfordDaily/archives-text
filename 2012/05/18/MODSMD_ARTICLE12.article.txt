## The 						importance of place 
### Sebastain Gould 
One concern that has been
brought up in the debate
about the Chi Theta Chi
lease termination is the loss of in
stitutional memory. This is an
issue that affects all of us who par
ticipate in student groups and
other organizations generally. If
you have ever been in a student
group at the end of the year, two
of the biggest concerns for the
next year are what the goals will
be and what the group will be like.

Without the recruitment of
new members, most importantly
from the freshman class, the
group can lose its identity. There is
also the great risk that the group
will die out entirely due to lack of
membership.
For XOX, this issue is extreme
ly important. I think we can all
agree that there is special value in
tying location to identity. By giv
ing members of a group a place to
go where they can act and behave
in a certain way, where it is not
only accepted but even encour
aged to act in that way, you are
making them feel welcome. That
encouragement of shared behav
ior is essential for developing the
habits of character in individuals
that will ensure that the character

of the group continues.
Community centers on cam
pus are an example of importance
of having a physical location for a
group. Throughout history, pos
sessing physical space has added
to the legitimacy of individuals
and groups. The power of physical
ownership also helps recruit new
members, on top of solidifying the
group's culture.
When a group loses its loca
tion, it can lose the pull that hav
ing a physical location has on
prospective new members. They
also no longer have the same ease
with which to meet those poten
tial members and current mem
bers, and facilitate personal con
nections. The importance of mak
ing personal connections based
on your identity cannot be over
stated. That is why the loss of insti
tutional memory can be so tragic.
I propose though that there are
ways to mitigate that loss. The best
and most obvious way is to create a
history of the group: Document ac
tivities, profile group members
and, by all means, try as hard as you
can to continue to meet as a group.

Second, you need to put your
name out there so that prospec
tive group members can find you.

The loss of location doesn't have
to be the end of the group. While
the consequential emotional dis
tress that comes from being dis
placed is not something to dis
miss, people need identity and
connections.

While I personally know very
little of ChiTheta Chi, I fully sym
pathize with their predicament. It
may be hard for me to relate per
sonally to them, but I fully under
stand where they're coming from
in their fear of institutional-mem
ory loss, because of my involve
ment in other student groups. I
hope that they are able to come to
better terms with the University
with regards to the lease in the fu
ture, and at the same time keep
their identities.
