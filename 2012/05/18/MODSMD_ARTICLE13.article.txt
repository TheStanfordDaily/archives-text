## THE
						HOME STRETCH CARD PAYS A VISIT TO UTAH 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
It's time for the No. 12 Stanford baseball
team to flex its muscles.
For the Cardinal (33-14, 14-10 Pac-12),
anything less than a sweep would be a disap
pointment when it heads to Salt Lake City
this weekend, with host Utah (14-35, 7-20)
floundering in its first year as a member of the
Pac-12 Conference. The Utes have only one
series win all season taking 1-0 and 3-1 vic
tories against lOth-place USC (22-25,7-17) in
the opening weekend of conference play
and have been outscored 303-198 in the
process.
Regardless, Stanford will have to avoid the
fates suffered by fellow Pac-12 heavyweights
Oregon and Arizona, which each dropped a
one-run decision to Utah earlier this season.
Even one such loss would be crippling for a
Cardinal team that still is looking to make up
some ground in the conference standings
with six games to play.
If it maintains its positioning in the Pac-12,
Stanford is likely to host a regional, but it still
has some work to do if it wants a chance to
host one of the eight Super Regionals on its
road to Omaha.

No. 10 Oregon is three and a half games
ahead of Stanford and has three fewer games
left, meaning that any Duck win or Cardinal
loss in Pac-12 play would eliminate Stan
ford's outright conference title hopes.
No. 11 UCLA (36-13,15-9) and No. 17 Ari
zona (33-15,16-8), meanwhile, are still within
the Cardinal's reach. Stanford's remaining
Pac-12 schedule is the easiest of the bunch,
but both schools will face the struggling Tro
jans and UCLA has a date with ninth-place
Cal in Berkeley this weekend.
After sweeping eighth-place Washington
State at Sunken Diamond last weekend, the
Cardinal is riding some momentum for a late
season push like the one it put on in 2011,
when the squad won three of its last four con
ference games.

"Our defense has been solid and our
pitching has been pretty good," said sopho
more Danny Diekroeger, who had RBI in all
three games against the Cougars. "Hopefully
our bats can get hot at the right time."
That's exactly what happened on Tuesday,
when Stanford rallied from a 3-2 eighth-in
ning deficit against the University of San
Francisco to upend the Dons 6-3. The game
also featured a triple from freshman Dominic
Jose, who burst onto the scene against Wash
ington State with two starts and his first ca
reer home run, a grand slam.
Ever since the season-ending injury to
sophomore shortstop Lonnie Kauppila, head
coach Mark Marquess has had success with
shaking things up in the field.

"I think we're learning some things," Mar
quess said, "and that's what you need when
you get to the postseason."
"Piscotty was the biggest thing," he added.
"We know he can start now."
Junior Stephen Piscotty had a stellar per
formance in his first career start on Saturday,
giving up one earned run in 6.1 innings to
earn his third win of the season. Even though
Stanford's starting leftfielder had made sev
eral relief appearances before last Saturday,
his endurance on the mound, given the Cardi
nal's lack of a true third starter, will come in
handy down the stretch.
Redshirt junior lefthander Brett Mooney
ham, who was moved to the Sunday slot after
missing a weekend with the flu, also held his
own last weekend in his best outing over the
last month.
Whether or not he moves back to pitching
on Saturdays, Mooneyham said the adjust
ment wasn't a tough one.
"Saturday and Sunday kind of feel like the
same day," he said. "Here at the ballpark the
weather's pretty much the same, the turnout's
pretty much the same.
"It's the same hitters and you're throwing
to [junior catcher Eric] Smith every day, so it
doesn't really matter," Mooneyham added.
In either case, Stanford pitchers are going
to match up favorably with their Utah coun
terparts this weekend. The Utes are clearly
the poorest pitching team in the Pac-12, and

Freshman pitcher David Schmidt (above) and the No. 12 Stanford baseball squad travel to Salt Lake City for a three-game series against Utah
today. The Cardinal hopes to maintain its late-season momentum against the Utes, who are currently sitting in last place in the Pac-12.
