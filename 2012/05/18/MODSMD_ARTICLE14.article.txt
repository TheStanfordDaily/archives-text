# Searching for some stability
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Men's swimming
coach Skip Kenney
was here when
Jimmy Carter was
president, gas cost
under a dollar per gallon and many
of our parents were doing "The
Hustle" in high school gyms across
the country.
In a month and a half, he'll be
gone.
The famed coach announced his
retirement on Wednesday, ending a
storied 33 years with the Cardinal
that saw him guide 31 straight teams
to Pac-10/12 conference titles and
bring seven national championships
to the Farm.
It's hard to imagine doing the
same thing in the same place for that
long, and that well. But not to di
minish his achievements Kenney
is not alone in the world of college
sports. At Stanford, 13 of our 35 var
sity teams are led by a head coach
who has held that position for at
least 10 years. Baseball's Mark Mar
quess, in the home stretch of his 36th
year as the Cardinal's lead man, is
the only coach who has been here
longer than Kenney, with women's
basketball's Tara VanDerveer hav
ing held her post for 26 seasons.
When a coach shows that kind of
commitment to a program and
to a university you've got to
imagine that it trickles down to the
players. The fans definitely appreci
ate it too, especially in big-name
sports like football or men's basket
ball, where there's always a bigger
buck to be made at the pro level.
That's why coaches like Mike
Krzyzewski, who has been with
Duke men's basketball for 32 years,
become the faces of their respective
sports. Despite his recent fall from
grace, Joe Paterno's 46 years at Penn
State made him a local demigod and
a household name across the coun
try.
Football is the one sport in which
too much of a good thing has never
benefitted Stanford. The Cardinal
has never held on to a football coach
for 10 years, and even though you
can't blame football minds like John
Ralston, Bill Walsh and Jim Har
baugh for leaving to go to the NFL,
it sure would be nice to have some
continuity of the type that Kenney
brought to men's swimming.
Stanford will never be able to
compete financially with many
other coaching destinations, given
its rightful commitment to academ
ics. That's why, when David Shaw
was hired as head coach a year ago,
Cardinal fans got a particularly
warm feeling inside when he said, "I
wanted this to be my last head
coaching interview ever."
What about our athletic direc
tor? There are several possible suc
cessors to Bob Bowlsby, who is leav
ing to head the Big 12 next month,
but my guess is that Stanford will
consider longevity one of the most
important factors in making its de
cision. Again, you can't blame
Bowlsby for bolting after six very
successful years, but wouldn't it be
nice to have another Ted Leland
(1991-2005) or A1 Masters (1925-
63) at the helm after his relatively
short tenure?

The only way that's going to
happen is if the new athletic direc
tor has deeper ties to Stanford, ties
that can't be broken by money
alone. Marquess, for example, has
been so successful in his nearly 40
years as the baseball head coach
that he must have attracted some
attention from a professional team
or a college with deeper pockets
along the way. A former two-sport

athlete on the Farm, however, Mar
quess has stayed put at his alma
mater and continued to build a win
ning tradition here.
That's why I was skeptical when
West Virgina athletic director Oliv
er Luck (who, by the way, said
Thursday that he wasn't interested
in the Stanford job) became one of
the biggest names thrown out there
to replace Bowlsby. Two of his kids
have been very successful Cardinal
athletes, but that's not going to keep
him here for the long haul.
My guess is that, if Stanford's
next athletic director isn't an inside
hire, it will be a former Cardinal ath
lete or long-time coach. Now that
Bowlsby has extended Stanford's
winning tradition to football, it's
time for someone to carry the torch
for the long haul.

Joseph Bey da is really just hoping
that Dave Chappelle will be Stan
ford's next athletic director. Tell him

That's why I was skeptical when
West Virgina athletic director Oliv
er Luck (who, by the way, said
Thursday that he wasn't interested
in the Stanford job) became one of
the biggest names thrown out there
to replace Bowlsby. Two of his kids
have been very successful Cardinal
athletes, but that's not going to keep
him here for the long haul.
My guess is that, if Stanford's
next athletic director isn't an inside
hire, it will be a former Cardinal ath
lete or long-time coach. Now that
Bowlsby has extended Stanford's
winning tradition to football, it's
time for someone to carry the torch
for the long haul.
Skip Kenney, you interested?

that Dave Chappelle will be Stan

Men's swimming
coach Skip Kenney
was here when
Jimmy Carter was
president, gas cost
under a dollar per gallon and many
of our parents were doing "The
Hustle" in high school gyms across
the country.
In a month and a half, he'll be
gone.
The famed coach announced his
retirement on Wednesday, ending a
storied 33 years with the Cardinal
that saw him guide 31 straight teams
to Pac-10/12 conference titles and
bring seven national championships
to the Farm.
It's hard to imagine doing the
same thing in the same place for that
long, and that well. But not to di
minish his achievements Kenney
is not alone in the world of college
sports. At Stanford, 13 of our 35 var
sity teams are led by a head coach
who has held that position for at
least 10 years. Baseball's Mark Mar
quess, in the home stretch of his 36th
year as the Cardinal's lead man, is
the only coach who has been here
longer than Kenney, with women's
basketball's Tara VanDerveer hav
ing held her post for 26 seasons.
When a coach shows that kind of
commitment to a program and
to a university you've got to
imagine that it trickles down to the
players. The fans definitely appreci
ate it too, especially in big-name
sports like football or men's basket
ball, where there's always a bigger
buck to be made at the pro level.
That's why coaches like Mike
Krzyzewski, who has been with
Duke men's basketball for 32 years,
become the faces of their respective
sports. Despite his recent fall from
grace, Joe Paterno's 46 years at Penn
State made him a local demigod and
a household name across the coun
try.
Football is the one sport in which
too much of a good thing has never
benefitted Stanford. The Cardinal
has never held on to a football coach
for 10 years, and even though you
can't blame football minds like John
Ralston, Bill Walsh and Jim Har
baugh for leaving to go to the NFL,
it sure would be nice to have some
continuity of the type that Kenney
brought to men's swimming.
Stanford will never be able to
compete financially with many
other coaching destinations, given
its rightful commitment to academ
ics. That's why, when David Shaw
was hired as head coach a year ago,
Cardinal fans got a particularly
warm feeling inside when he said, "I
wanted this to be my last head
coaching interview ever."
What about our athletic direc
tor? There are several possible suc
cessors to Bob Bowlsby, who is leav
ing to head the Big 12 next month,
but my guess is that Stanford will
consider longevity one of the most
important factors in making its de
cision. Again, you can't blame
Bowlsby for bolting after six very
successful years, but wouldn't it be
nice to have another Ted Leland
(1991-2005) or A1 Masters (1925-
63) at the helm after his relatively
short tenure?

The only way that's going to
happen is if the new athletic direc
tor has deeper ties to Stanford, ties
that can't be broken by money
alone. Marquess, for example, has
been so successful in his nearly 40
years as the baseball head coach
that he must have attracted some
attention from a professional team
or a college with deeper pockets
along the way. A former two-sport

athlete on the Farm, however, Mar
quess has stayed put at his alma
mater and continued to build a win
ning tradition here.
