### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team begins
the final chapter of its season tomorrow
when it plays its sweet sixteen match
against the University of Kentucky. Held
at the University of Georgia in Athens, to
morrow's round of 16 will kick off the sea

Stanford (19-8, 5-2 Pac-12) is seeded

2010 NCAA singles championship. As
was also the case back then, Stanford will
be relying heavily on Klahn to anchor
what has been a very unpredictable and
constantly changing lineup cobbled to

Recent matches have shown

composition, as evidenced by the many
different doubles matchups and singles
orders that Whitlinger employs, including
