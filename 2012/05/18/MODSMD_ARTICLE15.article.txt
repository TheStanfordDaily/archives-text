# Card on to the next round in NCAA tourney
## MEN READY FOR ROUND OF 16 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team begins
the final chapter of its season tomorrow
when it plays its sweet sixteen match
against the University of Kentucky. Held
at the University of Georgia in Athens, to
morrow's round of 16 will kick off the sea
son-finale NCAA championship tourna
ment.

Stanford (19-8, 5-2 Pac-12) is seeded
No. 11 and will be the underdogs in its
match against the No. 6 Kentucky Wild
cats (28-5,11-0 SEC).
Friday's match against Kentucky will
be the second time the Cardinal and Wild
cats have faced each other this season.
Their first battle was on Feb. 19 in the con
solation round of the National Team In
door Championships. Stanford won that
match 4-1 in what was arguably the team's
most impressive victory of the season.
Stanford will be coming into the match
following two solid wins last weekend
against Sacramento State and Santa Clara
in the first two rounds of the NCAA Tour
nament held here on the Farm. Momen
tum has been a fickle thing for the Cardi
nal this year, with its longest winning

streak lasting a mere four matches. Al
though its winning streaks may not be
long, Stanford has only lost consecutive
matches twice on the season, both times
coming against top-ranked UCLA and
use.

One of the story lines this week will
surely revolve around Cardinal senior

Bradley Klahn, who will be returning to
the same Athens courts where he won the
2010 NCAA singles championship. As
was also the case back then, Stanford will
be relying heavily on Klahn to anchor
what has been a very unpredictable and
constantly changing lineup cobbled to
gether by head coach John Whitlinger.

Recent matches have shown
Whitlinger flexible view on his team's
composition, as evidenced by the many
different doubles matchups and singles
orders that Whitlinger employs, including
splitting up the potent doubles combo of

Kentucky in the NCAA tournament round of 16 on Saturday. The Cardinal defeated the
Wildcats 4-1 earlier this year in one of its most impressive victories of the regular season.
Klahn and fellow senior Ryan
Thacher, who finished as the run
ners-up in last years NCAA dou
bles championship.

As has been the case with sev
eral of Stanford's matches lately,
the back singles courts beyond
the stable top-three singles trio of
Klahn, Thacher, and junior Matt
Kandath will undoubtedly
prove pivotal in determining the
success of the team. The three un
derclassmen that have been man
ning those back courts for Stan
ford freshmen John Morrissey,
Robert Stinemann and sopho
more Daniel Ho have all
played like seasoned upperclass
men and have been steady win
ners, contributing to the team's
.580 winning percentage on the

back courts this season.
The Stanford men's tennis
team is the most storied program
in the history of college tennis,
having won a record 18 national
championships. The Cardinal's
success shows in its incredible
102-17 all-time record in the
NCAA tournament.

In recent years, however, Stan
ford has uncharacteristically un
derachieved in the NCAAs. Last
season's quarterfinal was deepest
the team has gone since 2006. The
last time the Cardinal won the
whole thing and took home the
NCAA crown was back in 2000,
twelve long years ago.
Tomorrow's match against
Kentucky will be a tough test for
what has been an unpredictable
Stanford team thus far this sea
son. The Cardinal will square off
against Kentucky at 1 p.m. PDT.
