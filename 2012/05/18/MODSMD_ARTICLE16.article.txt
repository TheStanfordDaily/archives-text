# WOMEN IN QUARTERFINALS
## 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team defeat
ed Northwestern 4-1 in the NCAA tourna
ment round of 16 yesterday morning. With the
victory, the Cardinal advanced into the quar
terfinals, where it will see a rematch against
Pac-12 co-champion USC.
Four-seed Stanford (21-1, 9-1 Pac-12) and
five-seed USC (23-3, 9-1) shared the Pac-12
regular season title this year, as both teams
finished with only one loss in the conference.
That one loss for the Trojans was a 4-2 defeat
at the hands of the Cardinal just over a month
ago.
Stanford's side of the bracket now includes
only teams from the Pac-12, as California and
UCLA are set to face off against each other in
the quarterfinal round. No Pac-12 teams are
on the other side of the bracket. That side does
include Florida though, the team that Stan
ford has faced in the finals each of the past two
years.
Flistory seems to be repeating itself, as the
Cardinal's game against Northwestern was
also a rematch of last year's round of 16, when
top overall seed Stanford took well over four
hours to beat Northwestern 4-2. Stanford
reached four points much quicker this year
behind two-set victories from sophomore
Nicole Gibbs, freshman Ellen Tsay, and junior
Stacey Tan.
As the third-ranked singles player in the na
tion, Gibbs comfortably defeated junior Kate
Turvy, the No. 20 singles player, in straights sets
