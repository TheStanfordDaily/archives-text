# WOMEN IN QUARTERFINALS
## 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team defeat
ed Northwestern 4-1 in the NCAA tourna
ment round of 16 yesterday morning. With the
victory, the Cardinal advanced into the quar
terfinals, where it will see a rematch against
Pac-12 co-champion USC.
Four-seed Stanford (21-1, 9-1 Pac-12) and
five-seed USC (23-3, 9-1) shared the Pac-12
regular season title this year, as both teams
finished with only one loss in the conference.
That one loss for the Trojans was a 4-2 defeat
at the hands of the Cardinal just over a month
ago.
Stanford's side of the bracket now includes
only teams from the Pac-12, as California and
UCLA are set to face off against each other in
the quarterfinal round. No Pac-12 teams are
on the other side of the bracket. That side does
include Florida though, the team that Stan
ford has faced in the finals each of the past two
years.
Flistory seems to be repeating itself, as the
Cardinal's game against Northwestern was
also a rematch of last year's round of 16, when
top overall seed Stanford took well over four
hours to beat Northwestern 4-2. Stanford
reached four points much quicker this year
behind two-set victories from sophomore
Nicole Gibbs, freshman Ellen Tsay, and junior
Stacey Tan.
As the third-ranked singles player in the na
tion, Gibbs comfortably defeated junior Kate
Turvy, the No. 20 singles player, in straights sets
with scores of 7-5 and 6-3. Follow
ing suit, Tsay dominated against
junior Brittany Wowchuk on
court three while Tan beat sopho
more Veronica Corning on court
four.

"We're just happy to have won
today," said head coach Lele
Forood. "We have to tighten up
some things ... if we are going to
be contenders here."

Sophomore All-American
Kristie Ahn did not make an ap
pearance in Thursday's match, and
her condition is still day-to-day.
She has been out with a foot injury
for almost the entire year, but the
coaches have not ruled out the
possibility of her playing at some
point during this tournament.
Stanford started the day the
right way by seizing the doubles
point, which it did not do in last
year's meeting. Burdette and
Gibbs highlighted the doubles
play, winning 8-1 on court one. The
doubles team of Tsay and Tan also
managed to defeat the Wildcat
duo of Wowchuk and sophomore
Nida Hamilton 8-5. The duo of
Burdette and Gibbs has some
thing to prove in Saturday's match
with USC, as the Trojans' top team
beat the pair in the finals of this
year's Pac-12 doubles champi
onship.
"We're hoping it's USC [in the
quarterfinals] for a little bit of a
Pac-12 grudge match," Gibbs said
prior to USC's 4-1 win over Bay
lor in the round of 16.
The upcoming match against
USC should be considerably
tougher with the stakes increasing
in the deeper rounds of the
NCAA tournament. Stanford will
square off against the Trojans in
the quarterfinals on Saturday at 9
a.m. PDT in Athens, GA.
