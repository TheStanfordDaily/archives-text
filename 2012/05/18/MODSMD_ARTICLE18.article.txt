## TOP 5: SCARIEST ANIMATED DISNEY CHARACTERS 
### 
Remember all those years of cringing
away from the television as you
watched VHS animated movies and
the evil characters chanted their
theme songs? Yeah, we and our
beloved stuffed animals do, too.
Luckily, we can usually count on
Disney to give its villains their just
deserts. Read on for Intermission's top
picks of the creepiest, meanest ani
mated Disney foes.

The wolves in "Beauty
and the Beast."
They wait in the dark, two-dimension
al woods, teeth gnashing, and then
pounce on the smartest female char
acter to grace the Disney opus. These
wolves are the source of 85 percent of
lupophobes. Plus, because they're
not technically the villains of the story,
they survive to circle the castle for all
eternity!

Frollo in "The
Hunchback of Notre-
Dame."
Actually, the entire film is a sordid,
age-inappropriate romp. The movie's
redeeming innovation is having the
hero be ugly, but we have Victor Hugo
to thank for that. But you can just tell
that the minister of justice is evil
because he is old and has an accent,
sure indicators in the Disney world
that we're dealing with a villain. Frollo
kills the baby hunchback's mother and
tries to kill him too, but instead keeps
Quasimodo cooped up Rapunzel
style. He constantly sings about hell
even as he lusts after gypsies. This guy
is evil and claims the support of the
government and the religious powers,
which only compounds his power.

Spiker and Sponge in
"James and Giant
Peach."
Most of this story is pretty awful, too,
but the abusive aunts who take cus
tody of James after his orphaning run
in with a rhinoceros are especially
awful. They force him to work all day,
threaten to beat him and eventually
try to kill him. Luckily they are
wrapped up in spider silk and arrest
ed, which shows that law enforcement
really is looking out for the well-being
of the psychedelics.

Scar from "Lion King."
Spoiler alert! He killed Mufasa. This
probably goes without saying, given
the fratricide incident, but this is the
cruelest lion to ever grace the big
screen. From his habit of sadistically
toying with his prey to his dumb
hyena coven to the way he leads the
kingdom of Pride Rock into a period
of starvation and sorrow, he's a back
stabbing dictator of an uncle.

Ursula in "The Little
Mermaid."
This manipulative octopus-human
hybrid takes Ariel's voice and then
transforms herself into a beautiful
raven-haired woman to steal Prince
Eric's heart away from bumbling little
mute Ariel. A chameleon-villain is the
worst kind of villain because she can
even look pretty. Most villains are
ugly, according to Disney, so when
surface appearance can be altered,
you'd better watch out.
