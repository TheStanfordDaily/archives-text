## improvisor, inspiration

On a recent Monday morning in
Drama 103: Beginning
Improvisation, two students sit on
stage as their classmates watch. They've vol
unteered to act out an exercise about "sta
tus." For example, a British lord would prob
ably play "high" status, while an indentured
servant most likely plays "low." Standing on
the side, teacher Dan Klein '9l instructs the
two to try to "one up" each other in status.
They begin discussing their majors. "Oh,
you're a psych major?" the girl asks, one
knee crossed over the other haughtily.
"That's so cute,"' Klein suggests. "That's so
cute," she utters sweetly, rife with condescen
sion. The class laughs, marveling at the
transformation of the (otherwise kindheart
ed) student.
Klein makes suggestions in a gentle
voice. When he speaks in front of the class,
his arms hang by his sides innocuously, and
when he talks, there's an irrepressible smile
on his lips. He has a certain peacefulness
about him; it's the stillness of limbs, yes, and
the steady deliverance of his words, but one
gets the sense it's something within. Klein is
the kind of guy you want to ask, what's it all
about? Where does one find such serenity,
such unspoken happiness? Long gone is the
middle school theater director shrilly com
manding his students to enunciate. Klein is
like the Buddhist master of theater, but
instead of daily meditation, his practice of
choice is improvisation. But as it turns out,
the two have more in common than you
might think.
How does one get "professional
improviser" on a business card? For Klein,
it started, incidentally, when he was a soph
omore at Stanford and took Drama 103.
"There was a girl involved," he admits. A
good friend of his. "She was funny and
playful, and I sort of had this crush on her."
He smiles. "It was thrilling, it was scary. I
never really fully let go when I first took it. I
got the idea that I'm so supposed to talk
without thinking beforehand, without edit
ing and censoring, but I still couldn't quite

let go."
Then, in the beginning of junior year,
Klein suffered a serious car accident and had
to miss a full year of school. As part of his
recovery for his head injury the following
year, he took different types of classes to
stimulate different parts of his brain. That's
when he remembered improv. Problem was,
you weren't allowed to take the class a sec
ond time. He thought he found a solution
when the teacher at the time, Patricia Ryan,
asked him to be her teaching assistant. He
recalls sitting in class on that first day. "Dan,
will you be the TA?" Ryan asked. Another
guy named Dan stood up. "Sure," he
answered. Luckily, other-Dan was absent at
the second class. Dan Klein got the job. He
would TA the next year, too. That quarter he
joined Ryan as she created Simps a quasi
acronym (at Stanford? who knew!) for the
Stanford Improvisers a campus
improv troupe that's still thriving
today.
"After my car accident, I had
a different sense of what it meant
to take a risk. Like, the idea of
saying something in front of a
group of classmates I hadn't edit
ed yet wasn't quite as scary as get
ting hit by a drunk driver on El
Camino. And so I was able to let
go, just a little bit more, and I felt,
I just kind of got it," Klein recalls,
beaming. His foray into improv
has since blossomed into a career
not only teaching Stanford stu
dents, but also leading workshops
around the world. He recalls per
forming in front of Japanese den
tal implant salesmen using trans
lator headphones (there'd be a
joke, followed by a few seconds of
painful silence, and then finally,
laughter); performing on a high
definition video conference in
Copenhagen; performing along
side the CEO of the Nordic Stock
Exchange in Stockholm after a
workshop. "How did I get here?"
he remembers thinking.
Stanford students, Klein says,
offer a particular gift. "When I
tell students to shoot for average
and fail cheerfully, I can feel this
burden being lifted, and it's one
of my favorite things about
teaching this population in par
ticular," he says.
For a university marked by its
high academic standards and its
career-driven students, it's tempt
ing to think the cores of improv
are incongruent, even contradicto
ry, with the Stanford mentality.
But Klein is quick to point out that
the improv spirit is embraced on
many levels. He brings up Patricia
Ryan. During her thirty years
teaching at Stanford, she formed a

fruitful alliance with the product
design faculty. What has emerged
in part out of that relationship is
the d.school, which Klein sees as
the embodiment of improv's spirit
of collaboration, the notion of
allowing mistakes to be gifts and a
selfless desire "to make your part
ner look good."
But perhaps the most surpris
ing thing to learn from this
improv expert is that very little of
improv is being funny. "That's
really about a third of it, if that," he
says. That's also one of the hurdles
of teaching newcomers to the
practice: They come in believing
that to succeed as improvisers,
they have to be relentlessly funny.
Having traveled around the
world, Klein has come to believe
that anyone's capable of being
funny. How? It turns out some of
the funniest moments come from
just being authentic
"I'm addicted to the pure, hon
est moments in the classroom
when someone discovers some
thing right there; it's totally fresh
and unexpected, and it surprises
them, and it gets a huge house
laugh... That's what I'm going
for. And I find that moment comes
from anyone."
Klein admits it's the laughs that
got him into it. But he's come to real
ize that improv is about so much
more than that.
"What I really love is changing
for the audience's emotion," he says.
"Laughter is the easiest one to hear,
but to do something that has an
effect on the audience, that's really
amazing."
There's a distinctly humanist
element to how Klein explains
improv. In some ways it's even spiri
tual. He discusses "masks," the char
acters people put on to obscure their

true selves, not just in performance
but in life.
"To be as simple as possible,
some people hide by retreating, and
some people hide by advancing," he
explains. The great beauty of improv,
and theater by extension, is that it
allows people to peel away their
defenses. If there's an irony to this,
that the artifice of the stage gives
voice to this wonderful authenticity,
it's quite a fascinating one. The core
of theater, Klein says, is about con
necting and being authentic. There's
got to be something truthful at the
core of the performance. That's
where the humor comes in: when an
audience is watching a person, a per
former, "having an authentic reac
tion in the moment."
In the process, Klein has learned
a thing or two about humans. He
recalls being intimidated 12 years ago
when he first started leading work
shops with corporations. He expect
ed these people to be serious, high
powered, demanding, critical. It took
a while to realize that every group is
just people. Everyone, even the most
high-powered CEO, has insecurities,
things they're working on and
strengths. And most importantly,
"everyone needs to be witnessed."
Klein's great ability is to create a
space where people can feel safe tak
ing a risk, in front of colleagues or
even strangers.
"I can't believe this is my job; I
really can't believe it," he says. "It's
almost like all those lessons about
improv really were true: say yes, pay
attention, notice what are the offers
and gifts, make use of the mistakes
and twists and turns and see where it
takes you. And it's kind of amazing
that I find that it's taken me here,
where I literally get to play every day,
and that's my job."
Klein smiles wide. "Whatever it

was that made me feel like this was
valuable and worthwhile to me, I
think this is really true for other peo
ple. People want to connect with
each other. They want permission to
mess up and do it together and be
witnessed. And they want to some
times be brilliant and have it be okay
if they're not.
"I'm just lucky" he continues. "I
think improvisers are lucky because
some of the skills improvisers are
taught actually make you luckier.
You're able to notice more things,
you're able to turn negative things
into positive things and you're
more likely to connect with people
and increase the chances of some
thing fortuitous happening." He
leans over and whispers:" That's
what my Ted Talk is about!'
How does one become a pro
fessional improviser? Klein might
give you this simple advice: by
being an improviser in life. To
improvise is to say yes, embrace
mistakes, live in the moment and
listen, closely, to others. Is it any
wonder, then, that students flock
to Klein's classes and, at the tail
end, marvel at how much they've
grown not just as improvisers, but
as people? Perhaps this proves that
the essence of improv is authentic
ity, which everyone possesses in
bucket loads. And how about
Klein's remarkable serenity? That,
too, is solvable. When you've cho
sen to live with fresh eyes, keen
ears and an open heart, and what's
more, spend your time giving
these abilities, these gifts, to others,
you court a lot of good in your
life. And surely, a lot of laughs.
