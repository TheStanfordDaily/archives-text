# DAN KLEIN
## improvisor, inspiration 
### â€“ alex BAYER contact ALEX: abayer@stanford. edu 
On a recent Monday morning in
Drama 103: Beginning
Improvisation, two students sit on
stage as their classmates watch. They've vol
unteered to act out an exercise about "sta
tus." For example, a British lord would prob
ably play "high" status, while an indentured
servant most likely plays "low." Standing on
the side, teacher Dan Klein '9l instructs the
two to try to "one up" each other in status.
They begin discussing their majors. "Oh,
you're a psych major?" the girl asks, one
knee crossed over the other haughtily.
"That's so cute,"' Klein suggests. "That's so
cute," she utters sweetly, rife with condescen
sion. The class laughs, marveling at the
transformation of the (otherwise kindheart
ed) student.
Klein makes suggestions in a gentle
voice. When he speaks in front of the class,
his arms hang by his sides innocuously, and
when he talks, there's an irrepressible smile
on his lips. He has a certain peacefulness
about him; it's the stillness of limbs, yes, and
the steady deliverance of his words, but one
gets the sense it's something within. Klein is
the kind of guy you want to ask, what's it all
about? Where does one find such serenity,
such unspoken happiness? Long gone is the
middle school theater director shrilly com
manding his students to enunciate. Klein is
like the Buddhist master of theater, but
instead of daily meditation, his practice of
choice is improvisation. But as it turns out,
the two have more in common than you
might think.
How does one get "professional
improviser" on a business card? For Klein,
it started, incidentally, when he was a soph
omore at Stanford and took Drama 103.
"There was a girl involved," he admits. A
good friend of his. "She was funny and
playful, and I sort of had this crush on her."
He smiles. "It was thrilling, it was scary. I
never really fully let go when I first took it. I
got the idea that I'm so supposed to talk
without thinking beforehand, without edit
ing and censoring, but I still couldn't quite

let go."
Then, in the beginning of junior year,
Klein suffered a serious car accident and had
to miss a full year of school. As part of his
recovery for his head injury the following
year, he took different types of classes to
stimulate different parts of his brain. That's
when he remembered improv. Problem was,
you weren't allowed to take the class a sec
ond time. He thought he found a solution
when the teacher at the time, Patricia Ryan,
asked him to be her teaching assistant. He
recalls sitting in class on that first day. "Dan,
will you be the TA?" Ryan asked. Another
guy named Dan stood up. "Sure," he
answered. Luckily, other-Dan was absent at
the second class. Dan Klein got the job. He
would TA the next year, too. That quarter he
joined Ryan as she created Simps a quasi
acronym (at Stanford? who knew!) for the
