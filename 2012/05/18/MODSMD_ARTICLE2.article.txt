# Tony Blair visits Farm, sparking controversy
## Former British Prime Minister addresses African development 
### AARON SEKHRI STAFF WRITER 
"Africa, for me, is an endless source of fascina
tion, inspiration and challenge," former British
Prime Minister Tony Blair told a packed audience
Thursday in Cemex Auditorium. "I am fascinated by
its possibilities, inspired by its spirit and challenged
by the immensity of its problems, which ache for so
lutions."

Blair's talk, titled "A New Approach To A New
Africa," focused on using "effective governance" as
a tool to develop partnerships between African and
Western countries. The Center for Democracy, De
velopment, and the Rule of Law (CDDRL) and the
Freeman Spogli Institute (FSI) co-sponsored the
event.
Blair spoke in detail about the challenges he sees
in Africa's future, his opinions on how to address
them and the work of his own initiative, the Tony
Blair Africa Governance Initiative (AGI), which
works with several African nations to address devel
opment problems from the executive branch down
ward.
Blair began his talk by expressing optimism for
Africa's future, but also cited numerous hindrances
to the continent's development, such as inadequate
food supplies, energy concerns, disease and poor or
non-existent infrastructure.
"Today my focus is not [on] what we can give, but
how we can partner," he said.
Blair emphasized the advisory role his organiza
tion pursues, as opposed to "a dependency between
developing and developed nations."
Citing governance as "the distinguishing feature
of successful emerging nations," Blair said this
means more than "simply honest government," but
an "effective government."
He proceeded to give five "illustrations" of his as-

Campus emails advertising the demonstration likened Blair to Darth Vader due to his involvement in the Iraq War and 'neocolonial' business interests in Africa.

sertion, outlining the role of the ex
ecutive branch, infrastructure, for
eign investment, education and
healthcare, and social capital.
Characterizing his organization as
"differing from traditional consult
ants," Blair argued that AGI "did
not simply fly in and fly out, but
works hard on transferring skills."
He outlined the key principles of
AGI, which he said are working di
rectly with the "key decision
maker" and focusing on "prioritiza
tion."

"Show me a leader with 100 pri
orities, and I will show you some
one who will achieve nothing,"
Blair said.

He then discussed the progress
AGI has made in countries such as
Sierra Leone and Liberia by coor
dinating on investments in the en
ergy sector. According to Blair, put
ting resources into these types of ef
forts was more fruitful than small
scale projects.
"[Small-scale projects] may be
very worthy in themselves, but
don't get a nation on its feet," he
said.

Echoing his belief in part
nership, and drawing lessons
from a variety of sources, Blair
said that emerging nations
should, in the spheres of educa
tion and healthcare, "leapfrog
many of the constraints and lim
itations which the legacy of our
systems have created."
He also discussed the role of
technology, which he said can be
"something that generates extraor
dinary waves of emotion, feeling
and impact." Noting Stanford's in
extricable link to Silicon Valley,
Blair challenged the audience to in
novate and design new technolo
gies to be leveraged for political
good.
Blair followed his formal address
with a conversation with Graduate

School of Business (GSB) Dean
Garth Saloner, during which he re
marked on the difficulties of manag
ing political realities with the public
expectations.
"In my profession, you start as
the most popular and least capable,
and you leave the least popular but
most capable," Blair said.
He then praised the leadership
philosophy of Lee Kuan Yew, stat
ing that "the best leaders do not
care who brings the expertise, but
just is concerned with getting the
job done."
Blair noted that the world is ex
periencing "a paradigm change,
where footloose capital coming
from China, India and other coun
tries means investors are looking
for new opportunities." According
to Blair, African nations could ben
efit from this shift if they are able to
"get their private sector framework
right."
Student sentiments toward
Blair's visit varied, with roughly 20
students protesting Blair's alleged
war crimes in the Iraq War, and the
fact that the University allowed
him to speak on campus.
Nicholas Moores 'l5, who at
tended the event, said he thought it
was well-received.
"I thought that he presented a
clear, progressive, perhaps simplis
tic at times, but overall, open-mind
ed agenda to allow Africa to set the
government framework it needs
to, and ultimately take the matter
of development into its own
hands," Moores said.

Blair spoke in detail about the challenges he sees
in Africa's future, his opinions on how to address
them and the work of his own initiative, the Tony
Blair Africa Governance Initiative (AGI), which
works with several African nations to address devel
opment problems from the executive branch down
ward.
Blair began his talk by expressing optimism for
Africa's future, but also cited numerous hindrances
to the continent's development, such as inadequate
food supplies, energy concerns, disease and poor or
non-existent infrastructure.
"Today my focus is not [on] what we can give, but
how we can partner," he said.
Blair emphasized the advisory role his organiza
tion pursues, as opposed to "a dependency between
developing and developed nations."
Citing governance as "the distinguishing feature
of successful emerging nations," Blair said this
means more than "simply honest government," but
an "effective government."
He proceeded to give five "illustrations" of his as-

Students protested the visit of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair outside Cemex Auditorium yesterday afternoon, in advance of Blair's Thursday talk on African development.
Campus emails advertising the demonstration likened Blair to Darth Vader due to his involvement in the Iraq War and 'neocolonial' business interests in Africa.

sertion, outlining the role of the ex
ecutive branch, infrastructure, for
eign investment, education and
healthcare, and social capital.
Characterizing his organization as
"differing from traditional consult
ants," Blair argued that AGI "did
not simply fly in and fly out, but
works hard on transferring skills."
He outlined the key principles of
AGI, which he said are working di
rectly with the "key decision
maker" and focusing on "prioritiza
tion."

"Show me a leader with 100 pri
orities, and I will show you some
one who will achieve nothing,"
Blair said.

He then discussed the progress
AGI has made in countries such as
Sierra Leone and Liberia by coor
dinating on investments in the en
ergy sector. According to Blair, put
ting resources into these types of ef
forts was more fruitful than small
scale projects.
"[Small-scale projects] may be
very worthy in themselves, but
don't get a nation on its feet," he
said.

Echoing his belief in part
nership, and drawing lessons
from a variety of sources, Blair
said that emerging nations
should, in the spheres of educa
tion and healthcare, "leapfrog
many of the constraints and lim
itations which the legacy of our
systems have created."
He also discussed the role of
technology, which he said can be
"something that generates extraor
dinary waves of emotion, feeling
and impact." Noting Stanford's in
extricable link to Silicon Valley,
Blair challenged the audience to in
novate and design new technolo
gies to be leveraged for political
good.
Blair followed his formal address
with a conversation with Graduate

School of Business (GSB) Dean
Garth Saloner, during which he re
marked on the difficulties of manag
ing political realities with the public
expectations.
"In my profession, you start as
the most popular and least capable,
and you leave the least popular but
most capable," Blair said.
He then praised the leadership
philosophy of Lee Kuan Yew, stat
ing that "the best leaders do not
care who brings the expertise, but
just is concerned with getting the
job done."
Blair noted that the world is ex
periencing "a paradigm change,
where footloose capital coming
from China, India and other coun
tries means investors are looking
for new opportunities." According
to Blair, African nations could ben
efit from this shift if they are able to
"get their private sector framework
right."
Student sentiments toward
Blair's visit varied, with roughly 20
students protesting Blair's alleged
war crimes in the Iraq War, and the
fact that the University allowed
him to speak on campus.
Nicholas Moores 'l5, who at
tended the event, said he thought it
was well-received.
"I thought that he presented a
clear, progressive, perhaps simplis
tic at times, but overall, open-mind
ed agenda to allow Africa to set the
government framework it needs
to, and ultimately take the matter
of development into its own
hands," Moores said.

"Africa, for me, is an endless source of fascina
tion, inspiration and challenge," former British
Prime Minister Tony Blair told a packed audience
Thursday in Cemex Auditorium. "I am fascinated by
its possibilities, inspired by its spirit and challenged
by the immensity of its problems, which ache for so
lutions."

Blair's talk, titled "A New Approach To A New
Africa," focused on using "effective governance" as
a tool to develop partnerships between African and
Western countries. The Center for Democracy, De
velopment, and the Rule of Law (CDDRL) and the
