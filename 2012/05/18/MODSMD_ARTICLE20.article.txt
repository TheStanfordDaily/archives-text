cc -w-'m going to focus on the 180 seconds
I in my life that started the race
J-towards my destiny" said designer
and Stanford grad Jason Mayden 'll. "It was
an event that's rather played out in impover
ished neighborhoods, but for me, it became
the catalyst towards my goals and dreams."
At TEDxStanford 2012 this coming
Friday, Mayden will share with the Stanford
community how this life-changing experience
set him on the correct path toward achieving
his goal of designing Air Jordan sneakers.

Current director of innovation for Nike Inc.'s
Digital Sport, Mayden will exhibit the various
steps to success he has taken, ranging from
community involvement to his fellowship at
the Stanford Graduate School of Business
(GSB).

A native of the South Side of Chicago,
Mayden grew up with a knack for two things:
sports and creativity. In love with sneaker cul
ture, Mayden aspired to the ultimate goal in
footwear: to design Air Jordan sneakers. To
accomplish this goal, Mayden packed his bags
and left for design school, where he majored
in industrial design with a minor in graphic

design.
"I got an internship at Nike, and there I
immediately began to work towards my goal

of designing the Air Jordan," Mayden said.
Working his way up the corporate

food chain, Mayden eventually
achieved that goal, obtaining

the position of senior

footwear/innovation
designer for Jordan Brand.
Mayden's cre
ativity shines
through in

pairs of J's such
as the "Old
School" and the

"Air Jordan

2009," as well as

signature kicks j
for L.A. Clipper

point guard,
Chris Paul, and
New York Yankee

shortstop, Derek
Jeter. However,

Mayden's aspirations did not end at Jordan.
He aimed his sights and applied to the
Stanford GSB.

"Stanford, to me, was just as big of a des
tination or opportunity as Nike was,"
Mayden said. "I knew it was a place where I
could become what I wanted to become. I
knew Phil Knight [the founder of Nike] had

attended the Graduate School of
Business, and it was always in the
back of my mind as the place

where dreams come
true."

In 2010, Mayden entered the

GSB as a Sloan Fellow and received a mas-

ter's degree in science with a concentration in
general management. For a couple of years,
Mayden was another student on campus who
loved to chill in the same places students
today know and love.

"I was always sneaking my way over to
Arrillaga to play ball or hang out," he said.
"Another interesting place is Tresidder! I
loved it. I loved sitting there and just peo
ple-watching. Looking at all the people
come and go, wondering to myself, what are
their goals? What are their dreams?"
With an obvious interest in people, it is
no wonder Mayden is inclined toward com
munity involvement. At fordan, he was the
lead designer for the Doernbecher Freestyle, a
project with Nike and the Doernbecher
Children's Hospital.
"[The Doernbecher footwear] directly
connects to a charity and to kids that need it
the most," he said. "I'm so fortunate to be a
part of the process, and each year that's my
favorite shoe. There's nothing more special
to me than seeing a kid's face light up when
they see this design or sketch that's inspired

by them and to make them feel like they're
the celebrities, that they're the athletes I
would look at that as the best product that
I've worked on."

In addition to his work for the

Doernbecher project, Mayden

.is a mentor for Big Brother's

ißig Sisters and the Fellowship

of Christian Athletes.

However, he has a different

take on his mentoring role.
"Most people give back to

help those who are less fortunate," he said.
"I give back because I feel like I would be less
fortunate if I didn't allow myself to learn and
see what other people are struggling with and
what other people are concerned about. I
remind myself of how much more I can give,
how blessed I am and how far I've come. It
really keeps me grounded and focused on
identifying what's best. I don't look at is as
giving back; I look at it as mentoring and cul
tivating the next generation of great, responsi
ble, ethical leaders."

Blessed with artistic inspiration and a
drive for success, Mayden has succeeded in
ways others have only dreamed of. His story
of achievement continues to this day, as he
currently holds the role of director of innova
tion at the developing Nike Digital Sport. His
focus on great things to come runs parallel to
his wish to collaborate with such innovators
as the street artist Banksy, fashion designer
Jean Paul Gaultier and Facebook CEO Mark
Zuckerberg.
High aspirations in impressive company
