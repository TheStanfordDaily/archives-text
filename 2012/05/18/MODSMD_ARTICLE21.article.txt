cc -w- k yhen you're a
\/\ / young adult,
Y Y your own voice
needs to be the strongest one you
hear. It is your college experience
to own, to have agency over
you need to be the author of it,"
said Dean of Freshmen and
Undergraduate Advising Julie
Lythcott-Haims 'B9, known affec
tionately as Dean Julie, who will
speak at Stanford inaugural TEDx
event this Saturday.
The charismatic Lythcott-
Haims is taking her own advice
listening to her own voice as
she leaves Stanford at the end of
this quarter to embark on a new
career: writing. In fact, she plans
to use her TEDx talk to "try out
ideas with the audience" for a
book she hopes to write about the
role of parents in the lives of col
lege students and young adults.
"The over-involvement of

parents," she said, "is leading to the under
construction of young adults" who followed a
"checklisted childhood" of demanding expec
tations devised by parents, schools and socie
ty. Lythcott-Haims wants to help parents
understand that "their job as parents is to put
themselves out of a job," to step back enough
that they don't get in the way of their child's
creativity and self-discovery. She also has a
message for young people: The way to lead an
authentic life is to know yourself and have the
courage to be true to yourself. Everyone, she
said, needs the process of self-discovery, to
learn to focus on what is meaningful and to
follow through.
Lythcott-Haims underwent a similar
process: After earning her undergraduate
degree in 1989 from Stanford and then a law
degree at Harvard, she began practicing law in
Silicon Valley. It was lucrative and prestigious,
she recalled, but after four years, "I was miser
able. It was difficult to turn away and say I'm
choosing something different." But she did,

joining the administration at
Stanford.
Now she is embarking on a
new challenge: earning a master's
of fine arts and pursuing writing,
in particular poetry, at a master of
fine arts program at the California
College of the Arts in San
Francisco. When she was a fresh
man, her professors said her writ
ing needed a lot of work "and
they were right," she said so she
set about improving it. "The

things we fear feel like a big wave
we're running away from, and I
had to turn around and face the
wave," she said.
In 2007, she read a poetry
collection by Lucille Clifton called
"Good Woman." Never before a
poetry fan, she was mesmerized,
recognizing a voice that resonated
with her own. She began writing
her own song lyrics. Now her
poetry touches on identity issues,
relationships and political com

mentary.
"When you get to be my age,
you appreciate more and more
that life is short, and if there's a
voice telling you there's something
out there you want to do, you have
to listen," Lythcott-Haims said. But
she won't lose sight of her time at
Stanford "it has been a great
laboratory and observatory"
and wants to use what she has
learned here to make a difference

elsewhere. She leaves an

incredible legacy at Stanford, espe
cially with the Reflections program
she created for future classes. The
biggest lesson? "Things are going
to go wrong, but you'll be okay,"
she said. "You'll learn from it
that is what life is about."
