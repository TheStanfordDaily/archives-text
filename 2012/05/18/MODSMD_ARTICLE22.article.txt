A mid bright green rubber

x Aprosthetic leg leaning on a
table and muffled noises from the
back room, Krista Donaldson,
CEO of D-Rev, a nonprofit that
develops products to help the health
and income of the impoverished on
a global level, is busy at work.
For Donaldson, who will be a
speaker at Stanford's first-ever
TEDx conference, working at D-
Rev is exactly what she wanted to
do. Donaldson, who also currently
serves as a lecturer and researcher at
the Hasso Plattner Institute of

Design ("the d.school"), knew from

the start that she wanted to be
involved in the intersection of tech
nology and development.
"It's funny you usually hear
about people making a big discov
ery about what they want to do,
but, for me, I've always been inter
ested in engineering for social
good," Donaldson said.

"It really started when I was at
Vanderbilt and led an alternative
spring break trip that got me think
ing about how to involve public
interest in engineering," she added.
Donaldsons enthusiasm led her on
a journey in design, both in the
United States and abroad.

After becoming the first intern
at Kick Start International, an organ
ization aimed at using product
development and design to eradi
cate poverty, Donaldson spent four
years working in Kenya. The lessons
she learned in Kenya have influ
enced her philosophy on design and
engineering for change.
"My time in Kenya made me

take a more systematic approach to
design, from the input to the out
put," she said. "It made me see the
critical questions, such as who is

selling the product, who is going to
be paying for it, how do we know
that the product will be used cor
rectly— if at all?
"For social innovation, you
have to get at the core; you have to
use product design and develop
ment with a renewed look at the

social sector," she added.
Through her innovative ideas
and passion, Donaldson was award
ed a fellowship with the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science to use her unique perspec
tive on design and engineering in
Iraq. Her time abroad also gave her
insight to making a meaningful
impact through design.
"It really is where rubber meets
the road," Donaldson said with a
laugh. "The products need to be
manufacturable."
"You need to bear in mind that
you are designing products in
emerging markets and for popula
tions that haven't used that prod
uct," she said.
Donaldson's experiences have
led to a change in D-Rev's philoso
phy. Though D-Rev once had a

strong emphasis on advocacy, it has
changed to producing more physi
cal products.
"Unlike just donating money
or items, the key difference in devel
opment is designing products that
have value," she said.
D-Rev's design process focuses
on creating value from human
needs. From using medical devices
to address jaundice in infants to
rubber knee joints for amputees, D-
Rev's approach is to constantly try
to improve its products and the way
they are integrated in the life of the
user. For Donaldson, understanding
for whom one is designing is criti
cal. To gain this understanding,
Donaldson goes straight to the
source.
"When we went to India, we asked a
young man about his thoughts on the knee
joint, and he said that he didn't like the click
ing sound that the knee joints made since it
made it hard for him to blend in," Donaldson
said. "We took what he said and designed a
new version that doesn't make any noise, and
now the prosthetic leg blends in better."
This philosophy on the intersection

between engineering and international devel
opment is one that Donaldson is excited to
share at Stanford's TEDx conference.
"I am honored to be asked to speak at
the conference," Donaldson said. "I think it's
going to be a really good dialogue that is
going to push us to think about the role of
technology and ingenuity in society."
Donaldson said she believes that engi

neering and design are powerful tools that can
bring about social change and make a true
impact.
"It's really inspiring because everyday,
everywhere you look, you see something that
has been developed on some level by an engi
neer," she said.
Using engineering and design in an
affordable, effective way for social good is

what Donaldson and D-Rev continue to
explore.
"Enabling people to help themselves is
what it's really about," Donaldson said.

affordable, effective way for social good is

what Donaldson and D-Rev continue to
explore.
"Enabling people to help themselves is
what it's really about," Donaldson said.
A mid bright green rubber

table and muffled noises from the
back room, Krista Donaldson,
CEO of D-Rev, a nonprofit that
develops products to help the health
and income of the impoverished on
a global level, is busy at work.
For Donaldson, who will be a
speaker at Stanford's first-ever
TEDx conference, working at D-
Rev is exactly what she wanted to
do. Donaldson, who also currently
serves as a lecturer and researcher at
the Hasso Plattner Institute of

Design ("the d.school"), knew from

the start that she wanted to be
involved in the intersection of tech
nology and development.
"It's funny you usually hear
about people making a big discov
ery about what they want to do,
but, for me, I've always been inter
ested in engineering for social
good," Donaldson said.

"It really started when I was at
Vanderbilt and led an alternative
spring break trip that got me think
ing about how to involve public
interest in engineering," she added.
Donaldsons enthusiasm led her on
a journey in design, both in the
United States and abroad.

After becoming the first intern
at Kick Start International, an organ
ization aimed at using product
development and design to eradi
cate poverty, Donaldson spent four
years working in Kenya. The lessons
she learned in Kenya have influ
enced her philosophy on design and
engineering for change.
"My time in Kenya made me

take a more systematic approach to
design, from the input to the out
put," she said. "It made me see the
critical questions, such as who is

selling the product, who is going to
be paying for it, how do we know
that the product will be used cor
rectly— if at all?
"For social innovation, you
have to get at the core; you have to
use product design and develop
ment with a renewed look at the

social sector," she added.
Through her innovative ideas
and passion, Donaldson was award
ed a fellowship with the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science to use her unique perspec
tive on design and engineering in
Iraq. Her time abroad also gave her
insight to making a meaningful
impact through design.
"It really is where rubber meets
the road," Donaldson said with a
laugh. "The products need to be
manufacturable."
"You need to bear in mind that
you are designing products in
emerging markets and for popula
tions that haven't used that prod
uct," she said.
Donaldson's experiences have
led to a change in D-Rev's philoso
phy. Though D-Rev once had a

strong emphasis on advocacy, it has
changed to producing more physi
cal products.
"Unlike just donating money
or items, the key difference in devel
opment is designing products that
have value," she said.
D-Rev's design process focuses
on creating value from human
needs. From using medical devices
to address jaundice in infants to
rubber knee joints for amputees, D-
Rev's approach is to constantly try
to improve its products and the way
they are integrated in the life of the
user. For Donaldson, understanding
for whom one is designing is criti
cal. To gain this understanding,
Donaldson goes straight to the
source.
"When we went to India, we asked a
young man about his thoughts on the knee
joint, and he said that he didn't like the click
ing sound that the knee joints made since it
made it hard for him to blend in," Donaldson
said. "We took what he said and designed a
new version that doesn't make any noise, and
now the prosthetic leg blends in better."
This philosophy on the intersection

between engineering and international devel
opment is one that Donaldson is excited to
share at Stanford's TEDx conference.
"I am honored to be asked to speak at
the conference," Donaldson said. "I think it's
going to be a really good dialogue that is
going to push us to think about the role of
technology and ingenuity in society."
Donaldson said she believes that engi

neering and design are powerful tools that can
bring about social change and make a true
impact.
"It's really inspiring because everyday,
everywhere you look, you see something that
has been developed on some level by an engi
neer," she said.
Using engineering and design in an
affordable, effective way for social good is

what Donaldson and D-Rev continue to
explore.
"Enabling people to help themselves is
what it's really about," Donaldson said.
