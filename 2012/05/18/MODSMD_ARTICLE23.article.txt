## 'LOVE SONG'

One of the most exciting
and avant-garde events at
this year's San Francisco
International Film Festival was the
live documentary presentation of
director Sam Green's "The Love
Song for R. Buckminster Fuller." It
screened twice at the SFMOMA on
May 1, a presentation facilitated in
tandem with the SFMOMA, which
has a current exhibit on
Buckminster Fuller in the Bay Area.
Sam Green provided live
voice-over commentary for the
film, and indie rock band Yo La
Tengo performed the film's score

live. In this setting, the film became
a hybrid of cinema and theatre and
the images on screen more like a
visual aid to a live performance
than a stand-alone piece.
Buckminster Fuller was the
quintessential Renaissance man: a
designer, thinker, architect, innova
tor, writer and lecturer decades
ahead of his time. Although per
haps most widely known for his
thick, black glasses and geodesic
domes, Fuller's legacy extends far
beyond that. He was a strong pro
ponent of big-picture thinking and
was, in many ways, a champion of

design thinking. Although some of
his ideas can be easily dismissed as
far-fetched, the point wasn't always
to build everything he proposed
but to expand people's horizons
about how they think about the
world and making things work.
As we learn through the film,
Fuller kept an archive of all of his
activities including every

receipt, every memo and every tel
evision appearance in what is
now known as the Dymaxion

Chronofile. It is the most extensive
archive of any single person's activ
ities, owned and housed by
Stanford University's libraries, and
was the primary source material
for the film and the exhibit. There
are excerpts in the film showing
Buckminster Fuller meeting the
hippies on Hippie Hill in Golden
Gate Park, as well as some of his
television appearances. The film is
essentially a montage of photo
graphs and archival footage of
Fuller and his work, with a few
present-day interviews with schol
ars of the Chronofile.
The difficulty with both the
SFMOMA exhibit and Green's film
is that, by choosing to focus on
Fuller in the Bay Area, they have
also chosen to ignore the greater
context of his work. In fact, Green
did not interview anyone for his
documentary who actually knew
or worked with Fuller personally,
despite the fact that many of them

are still alive and active. Without
this context, it becomes far too easy
to dismiss him and some of his far
fetched ideas as the products of a
crackpot rather than an innovator
trying to challenge the status quo.
For example, the World
Games workshops Fuller ran
where motivated people came
together to hear him speak, get
inspired and work to solve the
world's biggest problems from
food security to sustainable devel
opment weren't in the Bay Area,
and thus they are altogether
ignored in the film. Because
Fuller's concept of "Spaceship
Earth," a place that we all have to
share with limited resources that
we need to preserve, was not a Bay
Area specific idea, it too is ignored.

Yet these are two of Fuller's key
legacies and proof that he was a
leading-edge thinker.
The reference to T.S. Eliot's
"Love Song for J. Alfred Prufrock",
a poem about a lovable but pathet
ic man, in the film's title is no coin
cidence. It's sadly an apt metaphor
for Green's view of Fuller: affec
tionate, but somewhat unim
pressed. Perhaps the film would
have done better to draw its inspi
ration from the Beatles' song "Fool
on the Hill," in what could have
been a much less ignorantly critical
ode to Fuller without ignoring his
controversial idiosyncrasies.
