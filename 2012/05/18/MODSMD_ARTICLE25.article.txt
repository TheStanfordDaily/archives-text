## PART ONE CUSTOM CONSOLES 
### – nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
One late night in the sum
mer of 2009,1 sat
bleary-eyed and jittery
over a rickety card table in my
parents' basement. I'd been there
for what felt like days. A com
pletely disassembled Xbox 360

lay strewn in pieces before me,
each component resting gently
on its own six-inch square of
newspaper. A clap of thunder rat
tled the window as I steadied the
screwdriver in my hand.
By the next morning, I'd
brought a console back from the
brink of death and even man
aged to trick it out with a new
heat sink and some other goodies.
I'm hardly a bona fide techie, and
frankly, that was some hard shit.
But when that pile of bolts
sparked to life and I heard that
disc drive purr ... let me tell you,
it felt damn good.
Most people don't ever think
to open up a console. Or a phone,
a calculator or even an alarm
clock and certainly not a prop
er computer. But as anyone who's
built a PC from scratch can tell
you, there's an unexpected emo
tionality to the experience of
powering something on when
you can think to yourself, I had a
hand in making that.
If more people are going to
experience that quiet euphoria,

the barrier for entry
needs to be lower.
People also need a
better reason to

break out the toolkit in

the first place in this era of mass
produced laptops and Apple Care,
we're getting used to the (very
incorrect) idea that if we ever want
a different experience from our
computer, we should just hand it to
a Genius or pony up for the next
year's model. And with the way we
are taught to use our technology—
companies emphasize computer
generated software more than par
ents encourage their kids to be
astronauts —we occupy ourselves
with software-based tech start-ups
and settle for the hardware they
hand us. For better or worse, we're
sheltered from ever encountering
the inner workings of a computer,
even as we become increasingly
dependent on them. Ironically, that
trend is concurrent with an almost
opposite one: Hardware prices have
absolutely plummeted in recent
years, and it's never been easier to

piece together computer

parts from different
i marketplaces on the
Web.

For the mainstream consumer,
we need something in between
those disparate extremes.
Something, that is to say, must
change. I have to wonder if console
manufacturers could make the dif
ference after all, it certainly
would've made that summer night
a little less nerve-wracking if my
Xbox had beenmeanf to be
opened.

For the uninitiated, it might
be instructive to explain what a
radical shift it would be for a

company like Nintendo or Sony
to sell a console with exchange
able components. Since their
inception, video game consoles
have been all about minimizing
maintenance and maximizing
entertainment. You sit down on
your couch, turn the thing on and
forget about it there are no
files to manage, no drivers to
hunt down and certainly no

graphics cards to update.
It's a trade-off, of course. It
opens the gaming experience to
more people, but closes off the
technical tweaking that enthusi
asts crave. (And let's be honest: A
unified, simple device is always
going to be easier to market.)

I should note that modifiable
consoles aren't entirely hypotheti
cal, but most historical examples
are fairly cringe-worthy. The Sega
Genesis 32X was overpriced and
under-supported, while the

Nintendo 64 disc drive never even
saw release outside of Japan. The
Nintendo 64 also had an interest
ing expansion pack to add a

whopping four megabytes of
RAM, but only two games ever
truly took advantage of it. The
only example in the current gen
eration might be the Play Station
3, which allows users to swap in a
new hard drive.

Those examples are outdated
and mostly superficial, and the
industry has changed since they
came along. I'm not sure if the
industry is ready for properly cus
tomizable consoles, but at the
very least, it's time to re-evaluate
the question.

astronauts —we occupy ourselves
with software-based tech start-ups
and settle for the hardware they
hand us. For better or worse, we're
sheltered from ever encountering
the inner workings of a computer,
even as we become increasingly
dependent on them. Ironically, that
trend is concurrent with an almost
opposite one: Hardware prices have
absolutely plummeted in recent
years, and it's never been easier to

piece together computer

parts from different
i marketplaces on the
Web.

For the mainstream consumer,
we need something in between
those disparate extremes.
Something, that is to say, must
change. I have to wonder if console
manufacturers could make the dif
ference after all, it certainly
would've made that summer night
a little less nerve-wracking if my
Xbox had beenmeanf to be
opened.

For the uninitiated, it might
be instructive to explain what a
radical shift it would be for a

company like Nintendo or Sony
to sell a console with exchange
able components. Since their
inception, video game consoles
have been all about minimizing
maintenance and maximizing
entertainment. You sit down on
your couch, turn the thing on and
forget about it there are no
files to manage, no drivers to
hunt down and certainly no

graphics cards to update.
It's a trade-off, of course. It
opens the gaming experience to
more people, but closes off the
technical tweaking that enthusi
asts crave. (And let's be honest: A
unified, simple device is always
going to be easier to market.)

I should note that modifiable
consoles aren't entirely hypotheti
cal, but most historical examples
are fairly cringe-worthy. The Sega
Genesis 32X was overpriced and
under-supported, while the

Nintendo 64 disc drive never even
saw release outside of Japan. The
Nintendo 64 also had an interest
ing expansion pack to add a

whopping four megabytes of
RAM, but only two games ever
truly took advantage of it. The
only example in the current gen
eration might be the Play Station
3, which allows users to swap in a
new hard drive.

Those examples are outdated
and mostly superficial, and the
industry has changed since they
came along. I'm not sure if the
industry is ready for properly cus
tomizable consoles, but at the
very least, it's time to re-evaluate
the question.
