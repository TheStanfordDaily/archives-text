## ROXY SASS ROXY BREAKS FOR THE WEEKEND 
### 
School may be out for our
friends at semester schools,
but here at Stanford we're still
working, playing and getting hard.
Roxy's midterm schedule may be
unrelenting, but so is her desire to
party. And fortunately, this coming
weekend offers plenty of opportu
nity â€” here's how to get the most
out of (and get the most action
during) the next few days.

Durandom Hookup
What more could Roxy possibly
want out of a party? No explana
tion needed.
Frost Revival Concert
Stanford Concert Network hopes
that the upcoming concert in Frost
will restore the venue, which host
ed the Grateful Dead in the 19705,
to its former glory. Roxy's more
concerned with whether there will
also be a revival of the '7os atti
tudes about free love. If so, there
are plenty of conveniently located
trees and bushes to explore en
route to a little one-on-one explo
ration, and no need to be modest.
For those of you who missed
Coachella, Frost Revival will be a
great chance to channel the hipster
inside you but fortunately for
those also trying to get inside a hip
ster, people will probably have
showered more recently (Roxy likes
it dirty in all but the literal sense).
More into high profile than hip
ster? Roxy certainly wouldn't be
coy about hooking up with a

member of Modest Mouse. She's
willing to accept a little competi
tion Roxy knows she's the one
who's going to end up in the "little
motel" or, more likely, a mega
fancy hotel downtown after the
show.
Bay to Breakers
Every year, Stanford students make
the pilgrimage to San Francisco to
participate in Bay to Breakers. The
event provides a pretense for every
undergrade favorite hobbies: day
drinking and wearing costumes.
Of course, the only thing better
than putting on rally is taking it
off. Bay to Breakers may technically
be a race, but for Roxy, it's more
about the journey than the desti
nation. After all the drinking and
running around, not everyone
reaches the official finish line
but there are plenty of opportuni
ties to finish elsewhere. Have your
own, private marathon somewhere
along the course. Starting to feel
that your current hook-up is a little
stagnant? There's no better oppor
tunity to get some fresh air than by
hooking up outside.
It's definitely going to be a big
weekend. Roxy's got enough stami
na... do you?
