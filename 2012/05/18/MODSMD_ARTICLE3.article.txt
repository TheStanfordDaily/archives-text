# Student demonstrators protest Blair's alleged war crimes
## 
### ELLORA ISRANI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A group of around 20 students protested former
British Prime Minister Tony Blair's visit to Stanford
Thursday evening. Holding signs that read "The an
swer to colonialism is not imperialism" and
"Africa's resources are for Africa's people," pro
testers gathered outside of Cemex Auditorium,
where Blair gave a public talk.
Students protested in conjunction with the
"Tony 2012" movement which, according to its
Facebook page, seeks to "bring the warmonger
[Blair] to justice."
Blair was at Stanford to deliver a speech titled,
"A New Approach for a New Africa." He spoke to
a packed audience about international aid, eco
nomic development and governmental process in
developing African nations.
"Tony Blair has been found guilty of war crimes
under international law by more than one tribu
nal," wrote Zoe Lidstrom 'l2 in an email to The
Daily. "There are any number of other war crimi
nals that Stanford would never bring to campus be
cause of the atrocities they committed, and yet it
has brought Tony Blair. We are challenging the idea
that we should excuse Blair's actions."
According to Lidstrom, the protests had no offi
cial student group affiliation, but many of its partic
ipants are also involved with Occupy Stanford or
Stanford Says No To War.
"[We] who want to challenge this University to
see its role in a larger global context and to under
stand why providing a place for Tony Blair to speak
implicates us in perpetuating neo-colonial policies,"
wrote Anna McConnell 'l4 in an email to The
Daily.
Students mentioned Blair's involvement in the
Iraq War during his time as prime minister as a cor-
nerstone to their opposition.
"I wanted to organize a protest
against Tony Blair because he lied
to the international community,
along with [former U.S. President]
Bush, that Saddam Hussein had
WMDs and that if we didn't re
move him from power then he
would destroy the free world with
those weapons, which is proven to
be not only false, but lies," said
Josh Schott 'l4. "He is a war crim
inal, and it is disgusting that this
University is welcoming him. He
should be in prison."
Students expressed frustration
with Blair's decisions as a political
leader, as well as Stanford's im
plicit "endorsement" of Blair's
policies through hosting his talk.
"It frustrates me how Stanford
students are often seduced by
celebrity status and fail to actually
hold (Western) leaders account
able for their violence and perpet
uation of injustice," wrote Alok
Vaid-Menon 'l3 in an email to The
Daily. "Our silence is a tacit en
dorsement of Blair's violent and
criminal activities."
Protesters were angered by
Blair's actions as a prime minister
as well as his current projects that
focus on providing aid to six sub-
Saharan African nations.
Vaid-Menon called the specific
subject matter "offensive."
"A New Approach for a New
Africa,' are you kidding me?"
Vaid-Menon wrote, "The British

Empire was one of the most dom
inating and violent empires and is
directly implicated in the under
development of Africa. Having
Blair speak about 'Africa' (as if
there were solutions that applied
to all of Africa, a continent com
posed of many different nations
and countries) constitutes, in my
eyes, a pernicious form of neocolo
nialism."
Blair expressed a need for west
ern involvement in African devel
opment during his talk.
"When countries have emerged
from prolonged periods of insecu
rity and conflict, the basic appara
tus of government can be missing,"
he said. "We have the means to
help supply it."
However, Blair also mentioned
third parties among them "new
donors" in China, India and Brazil
as necessary contributors to the
development of sub-Saharan
Africa.

"You start at your most popular
and least capable and you end at
your least popular and most capa
ble," he said.
Blair directly addressed the
protests when speaking with The
Daily after his talk.
"It's great that we live in a vi
brant democracy, but sometimes
what people protest about," Blair
said. "If you're in Africa and you're
desperate to get a decent standard
of life, some change of prosperity
and proper education and health

care, you actually need the outside
world to be your partner in this. We
don't go into any of these countries
unless people want us."
Blair did not address his time as
prime minister with regard to his
involvement in the Iraq war.
Though Tony 2012 is an interna
tional movement it had approx
imately 8,250 likes on its Facebook
page as of publication Stanford
students were not involved until
Blair's visit to campus, according to
Vaid-Menon.
According to Schott, the
protests were a singular effort
against Thursday's event and will
not persist.
Vaid-Menon said he was
pleased with the turnout and pas
sion of the demonstrators, but
commented that he was disap
pointed in the way the University
treated the protest.
"They also prohibited us from
using our megaphone, citing uni
versity policy, and had police watch
our every move," Vaid-Menon
wrote, noting some irony in the sit
uation.
"We found it ironic that the
University feels the need to take
such safety precautions for peace
ful demonstrators and yet allows a
documented war criminal to freely
speak."
