### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate increased
the proposed number of breadth
requirements for undergradu
ates at its Thursday meeting, re
verting back to a recommenda
tion made by the Study of Un
dergraduate Education at Stan
ford (SUES) report in January.
Faculty representatives also
rejected an amendment that
would redefine the scope of the
Breadth Requirements Gover
nance Board, the body in charge
of determining whether or not a

course meets a specified breadth
requirement.

"This experience has made
me so proud of this institution,"
said Acting President and
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2. "A heated disagreement is
good because it shows that we
care that much about undergrad
uate education."

Etchemendy opened the
meeting by announcing a com
mittee to search for a new athlet
ic director, prompted by current
Athletic Director Bob Bowls
by's planned departure at the
end of the academic year.

"We hope to have an athletic
director in place by September,"
Etchemendy said. "Patrick
Dunkley will be the acting ath
letic director beginning June 16
after Bob steps down."
The meeting then moved on
to a continued discussion of Uni
versity undergraduate breadth
requirements. Following the
publication of the SUES report,
the Faculty Senate received rec
ommendations from the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Stan
