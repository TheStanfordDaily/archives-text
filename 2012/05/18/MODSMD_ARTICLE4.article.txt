## FacSen debates number of reqs 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate increased
the proposed number of breadth
requirements for undergradu
ates at its Thursday meeting, re
verting back to a recommenda
tion made by the Study of Un
dergraduate Education at Stan
ford (SUES) report in January.
Faculty representatives also
rejected an amendment that
would redefine the scope of the
Breadth Requirements Gover
nance Board, the body in charge
of determining whether or not a

course meets a specified breadth
requirement.

"This experience has made
me so proud of this institution,"
said Acting President and
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2. "A heated disagreement is
good because it shows that we
care that much about undergrad
uate education."

Etchemendy opened the
meeting by announcing a com
mittee to search for a new athlet
ic director, prompted by current
Athletic Director Bob Bowls
by's planned departure at the
end of the academic year.

"We hope to have an athletic
director in place by September,"
Etchemendy said. "Patrick
Dunkley will be the acting ath
letic director beginning June 16
after Bob steps down."
The meeting then moved on
to a continued discussion of Uni
versity undergraduate breadth
requirements. Following the
publication of the SUES report,
the Faculty Senate received rec
ommendations from the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Stan

History Professor Carolyn Lougee Chappell spoke about an amendment to
restore the number of proposed breadth requirements suggested by the
Study of Undergraduate Education at Stanford (SUES) report.
dards and Policies (C-USP) in re
sponse to the document. C-USP
has recommended that under
graduates take eight breadth re
quirement courses, despite the
fact that that the SUES report
suggested students take 11.

The Senate discussed an
amendment, which would return
to the original SUES recommen
dation for 11 breadth courses. The
amendment would require stu
dents to take courses that fit into
the seven "Ways of Thinking,
Ways of Doing" categories first
created by the SUES report. Stu
dents would be required to take
two courses in "Aesthetic and In
terpretive Inquiry," two in "Social
Inquiry," two in "Scientific Analy
sis," two in "Formal and Quantita
tive Reasoning" (with one in each
branch), one course in "Engaging
Difference," one in "Moral and
Ethical Reasoning" and one in
"Creative Expression."
C-USP, however, has recom
mended double course require
ments in only one of those cate
gories.

"Requiring one course in each
category would be an invitation to
superficiality," said Susan Mc-
Connell, SUES co-chair, as to why
her committee originally suggest
ed requiring two courses in some
categories, but not all. "For in
stance, it can be difficult for stu
dents to engage with science in
just one course because there's a
language barrier. By requiring
two courses, we create opportuni
ties for students to gain familiari

ty with the subject and then get in
depth."
"The proposal does not in
crease the general education
blueprint or narrow the space for
exploration," McConnell added.
Debra Satz, senior associate
dean for the Humanities and Arts,
expressed approval toward the
amendment, but said she feels that
students should have more flexi
bility to take different courses.
"I support a bigger footstep
because I believe that students
should have a wider breadth," she
said.
Satz added a friendly amend
ment to the proposal to split the
"Formal and Quantitative Rea
soning" requirement into two dif
ferent categories, stating that this
division would add transparency.
Faculty senators who spoke
appeared split on which proposal
to move forward. Many cited the
need for students to have aca
demic freedom as a reason to
keep C-USP's recommendation
of fewer requirements. Others
supported the amendment be
cause it would result in increased
exposure to breadth and depart
ment, which Biology Professor
Patricia Jones said is similar to the
requirements at Stanford's peer
institutions.
The Senate ended up voting in
favor of the amendment, and the
higher number of breadth re
quirements.
The senators then moved on to
a discussion of the "governance"
section of the amendment. Some
faculty members said they felt
that the Governing Board was
being given less freedom and
more constraints in an amend
ment.
Most of the senators were in

favor of the current wording in
the C-USP proposal, which they
said would allow for more flexi
bility and freedom for the board
in making decisions.
Senior Associate Vice Provost
of Undergraduate Education and
Biology Professor Martha Cyert
drew the Senate's attention to a
section of the amendment, which
she said tasked the board with the
job of figuring out how to deter
mine whether the courses it has
designated as satisfying a catego
ry "are in fact attaining the major
ity of the learning goals associat
ed with that category."
"Those assessment processes
are a really, really important, huge
task," Cyert said. "Assigning that
to the board is not realistic. None
of us would agree to being on the
board. It is not practical to give
the board that task as well."
In response, Economics Pro
fessor Caroline Hoxby said she
did not think the task would be
too difficult for the board.
"If it walks like a duck and
talks like a duck, it's a duck,"
Hoxby said. "We wouldn't have to
study every chemistry class be
fore deciding which requirement
it fulfills. The board would focus
on a small set of courses that were
much less clear [about their
breadth distribution]."
The Senate voted to oppose
the amendment to Board Gover
nance, preferring the original C
USP wording.
The Senate will discuss recom
mendations about the Program in
Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) and
the annual budget report at its
next meeting on May 31.
