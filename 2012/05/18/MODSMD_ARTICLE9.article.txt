## EDITORIAL Not just apathy – activists undermine participation 
### 
Stanford is effective at pro
ducing many things, from
paradigm-shifting research
to groundbreaking patents. Yet in
terms of on-campus conversation,
Stanford is also a place that pro
duces ideological echo chambers,
to the detriment of campus con
versation. The Stanford blog Stat
ic is one space that tries to break
this trend, by providing a forum in
which campus activists can share
their ideas and projects with the
broader campus and online com
munities. A recent post on Static
by Lizzie Quinlan 'l3, titled "A
Few Thoughts on Activism and
Stanford Culture," examined why
activism is not more prevalent on
campus, pointing to student com
placency, belief in the system and
use of social media as primary
drivers of apathy. While these are
all valid critiques of Stanford cul
ture, the Editorial Board would
like to offer an additional explana
tion: the structure of activist col
lectives on campus provide a bar
rier to entry that deters interested
individuals whose beliefs may not
perfectly align with the dominant
paradigm.
Stanford students do not join ac
tivist groups in part because they
may not subscribe to the multiple,
intersecting ideologies that they
perceive as the foundation of cam
pus activism. Is there a place in the
Occupy movement for a student
who supports income redistribu
tion but opposes gay marriage?
Would a student feel comfortable
joining Stanford Says No to War if
she does not support the divest
ment petition that the group has
sponsored, or Stanford Students for
Queer Liberation if she supports
the return of ROTC to campus?

feel unsure about where their
place is in an activist collective if
they support one part of the
group's ideology but strongly op
pose another. Simply put, there
appears to be little space for ideo
logical frameworks that are not
perfectly congruous with activism
writ large. We do not mean to sug
gest that campus activists are a
monolithic ideological entity; in
deed, we know that members of
the same group are likely to have
nuanced, different views about

their own cause. Rather, we be
lieve that because activist groups
on campus are often so closely tied
together, interested students who
are 'outside' feel unsure about
whether or not there is a space for
their dissenting views in the cam
pus activist community. Even if it
seems self-evident to group mem
bers that their group is a safe
space, a student may feel uncom
fortable joining without a more
explicit acknowledgment that
their opposing views on a topic
won't be seen to diminish their
participation.
An added complication is that
students may feel confused or
alienated by the rhetoric of revo
lution that often accompanies dis
cussions of social change. Quin
lan's article aptly pointed out that
Stanford students generally feel
validated by and comfortable
working within a system. While
most activist groups on campus
have websites that state their mis
sion and projects, students outside
the activist community may still
feel confused as to what the tangi
ble end goals of campus activists
are, particularly if it is couched in
the politically fraught language of
revolution, tn this confusion, they
may choose not to engage at all
even on topics they fervently sup
port. Here, students often draw a
fuzzy line between "activist"
groups and "service" groups, view
ing the latter as defined by more
concrete goals and the former
with vaguer mission statements
about how to enact change. The

Stanford has built several ex
traordinarily effective activist col
lectives — witness, for example,
the effective collaboration of
Stanford Students for Queer Lib
eration, MEChA, the Stanford
Immigrant Rights Project, and
others on the recent event "Undo
ing Borders and Queering the Un
documented Narrative" but
this comes at a cost. Students may
