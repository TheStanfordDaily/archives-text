## Q&A: Art After Dark 
### — Natasha Weaser 
The second annual Art After Dark
festival, held in Old Union and
White Plaza from May 17 to 19,
featured over 250 pieces of artis
tic work from over 100 artists,
ranging from spoken word to paintings to
sculptures. The event was a collaborative
effort between the Student Organizing
Committee for the Arts (SOCA) and Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS),
seeking to showcase Stanford's artistic tal
ent while presenting an underlying theme
of sustainability. The Daily discussed the
festival with SOCA director Jennifer
Schaffer 'l4.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did the
event Art After Dark come to form?
Jennifer Schaffer (JS): Last year, it was
called Vision eARTh. Before that, the arts
and sustainability events were held sepa
rately but on the same weekend. The art
event was called "An Art Affair," and the
sustainability event was called "Future
Fest." Since then it has evolved because we
decided that the festivals could benefit
from being joined together.
TSD: How so?
JS: Both groups [SOCA and SSS] came to
the mutual understanding that sustainable
messages are best conveyed in creative
ways and [through] innovative thinking
that's why we find the partnership to be
very effective. Our goal was that the event
would focus on art, but would have a sus
tainable thread running through every
thing— even the infrastructure was sus
tainable.
TSD: Can you talk a little more about the
architecture at the event?
JS: We decided to do a transparent tent so
people could see the artwork from outside,
as well as pillars with glowing solar lights, ft
was both aesthetically pleasing and gave a
sense of unity throughout the exhibit. We
definitely brought a design eye to the festi
val.
TSD: How do you select what art to display?
What were some of the highlights this year?
JS: It was a really open and inclusive sub
mission process. It was more about trying to
figure out which part of the exhibit the art
would best fit in and soliciting pieces. It is
both a process of curating and having open
submissions.
TSD: What made this year's exhibition dif
ferent from last year's exhibition?
JS: There was definitely more electronic
and interactive art. One of our goals was to
stretch the way Stanford conceived of art in
our community. I think that the quality and
diversity of the artwork this year was phe
nomenal. We had Stanford DJs and bands,
a film from the Stanford Film Society and
performances from the Cardinal Ballet and
the Stanford Shakespeare Company
among many other shows and displays. We
were trying to include every medium this
year.
TSD: Was there any difference in the
events on the three different days?
JS: Thursday had more of a street festival
vibe while Friday and Saturday had more of
a lawn party atmosphere during the day. We
saw our biggest turnout on Saturday when
it turned from laid-back to energetic during
the night.
TSD: What was the experience of planning
the event like?
JS: It was incredible but also incredibly
busy. I got pneumonia right before the fes
tival, so I relied heavily on the core team of
SOCA and SSS members to put the event
together. As a team, we have been working
[on the event] tirelessly since before school
started this year. There were also a lot of
volunteers from the art and sustainable
community and from all corners of campus.
TSD: What does the event mean to you?
JS: Personally, as a freshman, I perceived a
lack of art on campus and wanted to be a
part of something that would galvanize tal
ented artists all across campus. I think we
succeeded in doing that.
