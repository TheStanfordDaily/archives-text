# Schemes, bribes and terminators
## 
### ISSRA OMER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Vanessa Bastidas 'l4 opens
her door quietly, sticks her
head out and glances suspi
ciously down the hallway.
The coast is clear. She grips
her water gun and sprints to the bath
room, where she is safe once again at
least temporarily.
For an intense and fearful few days
during spring quarter, paranoia and de
ception are the norm in most dorms. The
game is called Assassins and no one is
safe. The rules are simple a player is
assigned a victim to eliminate using a
water gun. Once "assassinated," the as
sassin will inherit the victim's target. The
last one standing is the victor.
"It gets really intense," Bastidas said.
"People try to avoid common areas and
carry their guns wherever they go."
The Assassins experience for Peter
Wang 'l5 differed.
"I didn't take the game too seriously,
but some people in my dorm definitely
did," Wang said. "Some people came up
with all these strategies to avoid the
dorm as much as possible."
Assassins is a long-standing Stanford
tradition played in many dorms across
campus. Although widely considered a
freshman experience, many upper-class
dorms and students choose to participate
as well. Crothers, an upper-class dorm,
takes the game very seriously.
This year, each hall in Crothers had its
own preliminary round of the game, The
last two people "alive" in each hall were
allowed to go to the finals. This final
showdown was held on the front lawn of

Crothers in front of the entire dorm.
The winner this year was Ilya
Gaidarov 'l4, who believes his success
was due to a combination of luck and tal
ent.
"It's all about brains over brawn,"
Gaidarov said.
However, as for most other players,
his experience was a stressful one.
"It was the worst," Gaidarov said jok
ingly. "I was so paranoid. At first, I wasn't
even that invested in the game. I just did
n't want to get shot."
Gaidarov's initial plans to not take the
game seriously were almost immediately
changed.
"During the day, I tried to be in a place
where people couldn't kill me, so I basi
cally sat in my room during the day," he
said. "Then at night I would go out to kill
my target."
To achieve victory, Gaidarov formed a
partnership with another resident on his
hall, Youssef Hedroug 'l3, after
Hedroug's roommate tried to assassinate
Gaidarov.
"Because Youssef was honest, we
were in a partnership," Gaidarov said.
"There were others who I knew I could
n't trust."
"It was a bit hectic. I felt like I was al
ways looking behind my back," Hedroug
said.
"I didn't leave my room, and I always
had a friend with me as a witness so no
one could assassinate me," he said.
For Gaidarov, part of the drive to win
came from missing the experience during
his freshman year.
"I didn't get to play freshman year, so
I'm glad that we did Assassins," he said. "I
would have preferred doing it at the be

ginning of the year because I've gotten to
know people better since playing."
Bastidas recalled assassination at
tempts when playing the game last year.
"I had killed my person and thought I
was safe," she said. "But then I got out of
the shower without my gun, and my as
sassin was waiting right outside the door
and shot me."
"Last year I got really into it," she
added. "Even when I got out and wasn't
in the game, I was still so invested. This
year I knew I wanted to do better."
Every year, dorm staff put in a great
amount of effort to make the game a
worthwhile and memorable event.
Sometimes, they also participate as "ter
minators" who have the power to shoot
residents who do not "kill" their target
within 24 hours.
"I think the staff put in the time be
cause honestly, Assassins is a really fun
game," Wang said. "It's a good break
from regular activities."
"The terminators this year were in
tense. They had huge water guns, and I
was actually scared," Bastidas said.
"They were bribing my roommate with
donuts [to co-operate with them]."
In spite of the occasional drama, para
noia and scheming terminators, the ulti
mate purpose of Assassins is to bring res
idents together.
"Assassins is great because it gets
everyone involved, even for people who
don't normally participate in a lot of
dorm events," Bastidas said. "It's some
thing fun — something you can laugh
about later."

Hedroug's roommate tried to assassinate
Gaidarov.
"Because Youssef was honest, we
were in a partnership," Gaidarov said.
"There were others who I knew I could
n't trust."
"It was a bit hectic. I felt like I was al
ways looking behind my back," Hedroug
said.
"I didn't leave my room, and I always
had a friend with me as a witness so no
one could assassinate me," he said.
For Gaidarov, part of the drive to win
came from missing the experience during
his freshman year.
"I didn't get to play freshman year, so
I'm glad that we did Assassins," he said. "I
would have preferred doing it at the be

ginning of the year because I've gotten to
know people better since playing."
Bastidas recalled assassination at
tempts when playing the game last year.
"I had killed my person and thought I
was safe," she said. "But then I got out of
the shower without my gun, and my as
sassin was waiting right outside the door
and shot me."
"Last year I got really into it," she
added. "Even when I got out and wasn't
in the game, I was still so invested. This
year I knew I wanted to do better."
Every year, dorm staff put in a great
amount of effort to make the game a
worthwhile and memorable event.
Sometimes, they also participate as "ter
minators" who have the power to shoot
residents who do not "kill" their target
within 24 hours.
"I think the staff put in the time be
cause honestly, Assassins is a really fun
game," Wang said. "It's a good break
from regular activities."
"The terminators this year were in
tense. They had huge water guns, and I
was actually scared," Bastidas said.
"They were bribing my roommate with
donuts [to co-operate with them]."
In spite of the occasional drama, para
noia and scheming terminators, the ulti
mate purpose of Assassins is to bring res
idents together.
"Assassins is great because it gets
everyone involved, even for people who
don't normally participate in a lot of
dorm events," Bastidas said. "It's some
thing fun — something you can laugh
about later."

Vanessa Bastidas 'l4 opens
her door quietly, sticks her
head out and glances suspi
ciously down the hallway.
The coast is clear. She grips
her water gun and sprints to the bath
room, where she is safe once again at
least temporarily.
For an intense and fearful few days
during spring quarter, paranoia and de
ception are the norm in most dorms. The
game is called Assassins and no one is
safe. The rules are simple a player is
assigned a victim to eliminate using a
water gun. Once "assassinated," the as
sassin will inherit the victim's target. The
last one standing is the victor.
"It gets really intense," Bastidas said.
"People try to avoid common areas and
carry their guns wherever they go."
The Assassins experience for Peter
Wang 'l5 differed.
"I didn't take the game too seriously,
but some people in my dorm definitely
did," Wang said. "Some people came up
with all these strategies to avoid the
dorm as much as possible."
Assassins is a long-standing Stanford
tradition played in many dorms across
campus. Although widely considered a
freshman experience, many upper-class
dorms and students choose to participate
as well. Crothers, an upper-class dorm,
takes the game very seriously.
This year, each hall in Crothers had its
own preliminary round of the game, The
last two people "alive" in each hall were
allowed to go to the finals. This final
showdown was held on the front lawn of

Crothers in front of the entire dorm.
The winner this year was Ilya
Gaidarov 'l4, who believes his success
was due to a combination of luck and tal
ent.
"It's all about brains over brawn,"
Gaidarov said.
However, as for most other players,
his experience was a stressful one.
"It was the worst," Gaidarov said jok
ingly. "I was so paranoid. At first, I wasn't
even that invested in the game. I just did
n't want to get shot."
Gaidarov's initial plans to not take the
game seriously were almost immediately
changed.
"During the day, I tried to be in a place
where people couldn't kill me, so I basi
cally sat in my room during the day," he
said. "Then at night I would go out to kill
my target."
To achieve victory, Gaidarov formed a
partnership with another resident on his
hall, Youssef Hedroug 'l3, after
Hedroug's roommate tried to assassinate
Gaidarov.
"Because Youssef was honest, we
were in a partnership," Gaidarov said.
"There were others who I knew I could
n't trust."
"It was a bit hectic. I felt like I was al
ways looking behind my back," Hedroug
said.
"I didn't leave my room, and I always
had a friend with me as a witness so no
one could assassinate me," he said.
