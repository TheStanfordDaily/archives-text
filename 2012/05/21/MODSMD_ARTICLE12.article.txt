## EDITORIAL The 						ARP: Creating a culture of accountability 
### 
In April 2011, the Department
of Education Office for Civil
Rights issued a "Dear Col
league" letter, specifying actions
colleges and universities must
take in order to promote an ac
countable culture with regards
to sexual assault. The much-de
bated Alternative Review
Process (ARP) is Stanford's im
plementation of the letter's pre
scriptions. The Editorial Board
debated the merits of the ARP
and was unable to reach a unan
imous conclusion. What follows
is the opinion of four members.
Editorial Board Chair Adam
Johnson 'l3 recused himself
from this editorial.
The Dear Colleague letter is
straightforward. It requires col
leges to have a coordinated re
view process to respond to sexual
assault reports that gives equal
balance to both the impacted
party (alleged victim) and re
sponding party (alleged perpe
trator) throughout the process.
For instance, reviewers may not
conduct pre-hearing interviews
with one student but not the
other, and both parties must have
equal ability to call witnesses. The
letter also specifically mandates a
preponderance of evidence stan
dard for sexual assault cases a
"more likely than not" standard,
unlike the "clear and convincing"
standard. Schools that do not im
plement the letter's requirements
risk jeopardizing their Title IX
funding.
In addition to being consistent
with Title IX, we believe that the
ARP is good policy, particularly
the controversial preponderance
of evidence standard. The stricter
'clear and convincing' standard is
inappropriate for an entity like
Stanford that, unlike a criminal
justice system, does not have the
power to compel testimony. Stan

ford's review process inevitably
will have access to substantially
less data than a true court of law,
so the standard of evidence
should reflect this discrepancy.
But most significantly, the
ARP is important because it pro
motes a culture of reporting and
accountability that is desperately
needed. Most of the ARP's
changes aim to make the process
of reporting sexual assault friend
lier and less intimidating. For in
stance, if the ARP allowed the
two students to confront and
cross-examine each other the
procedure in place before ARP's
adoption far more sexual as
saults would go unreported: No
victim of sexual assault wants to
be forced to interact with their as
sailant in a traumatic and intimi
dating manner.
Moreover, we are not terribly
concerned that the system will be
abused by false reports.The prob
lem we face now is chronic under
reporting of sexual assaults. The
statistics on sexual assault in col
lege are grim: a 2007 report found
that about one in five women and
6.1 percent of men are victims of
completed or attempted sexual
assault while in college. More
frighteningly, a 2005 report found
that fewer than 5 percent of com
pleted or attempted rapes are re
ported. We therefore applaud the
adoption of the ARP as a means
of encouraging more victims to
come forward, thereby establish
ing a healthier culture where sex
ual assault isn't implicitly tolerat
ed by an incredibly low percent
age of reported incidents.
