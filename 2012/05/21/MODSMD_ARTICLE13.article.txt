## Against the preponderance of evidence standard 
### ADAM JOHNSON'13 Stanford Daily Editorial Board Chair, Vol. 241 
While sexual assault is an
issue that needs to be
taken seriously by cam
pus administrators, subjecting stu
dents accused of sexual assault to
the preponderance of evidence
standard the lowest burden of
proof in our judicial system is
not the proper way to address
such transgressions.
While the guidelines in the
"Dear Colleague" letter with re
gard to the burden of proof may
be straightforward, the legal justi
fication is tenuous at best. The
Obama administration justifies
using the low standard in these
cases because it is what would be
used, say, if Stanford were to be
sued for discriminating on the
basis of sex. As Hans Bader, a for
mer lawyer for the Office for
Civil Rights, wrote, "Students
cannot violate Title IX; only
schools can be sued under Title
IX, not individuals . . . More
over, Students 'are not agents of
the school,' so their actions don't
count as the actions of the
school." The letter, by requiring a
university's students to be subject
to the same burden of proof as
the university itself, makes a logi
cal leap that is far from self-evi
dent.
Indeed, in Davis v. Monroe
County Board of Education
(1999), the Supreme Court ruled
that Title IX violations occur only
when schools are "deliberately
indifferent to sexual harassment.
.. [that] deprives the victims of
access to the educational oppor
tunities or benefits provided by
the school." It is not clear how ap
plying the clear and convincing
standard (about 75 percent cer
tainty) to sexual assault cases is

representative of a university
being "deliberately indifferent."
In addition to the shaky legal
justification, the preponderance
of evidence standard goes against
one of the core tenets of our judi
cial system: the presumption of in
nocence. Although a preponder
ance of evidence standard is not
presuming guilt, it is hardly pre
suming innocence; only three
fourths of the reviewing panel
needs to be 50.1 percent certain
that a sexual assault occurred.
Some find this acceptable, noting
that the same standard is applied
to civil cases. But whereas the
penalty in a civil suit is monetary,
the internal penalty for sexual as
sault is often suspension or expul
sion. If anything, the conse
quences of being found responsi
ble in such cases warrant the
stronger clear and convincing
standard.
While I am in favor of other as
pects of the ARP for instance, I
agree that the accused should not
have a right to confront the accus
er the preponderance of evi
dence standard opens the door for
innocent students to be found re
sponsible. In a criminal trial, if
there is a generally low conviction
rate for a given crime, we do not
lower the burden of proof. Doing
so violates the due process rights
of the accused. If the loss of feder
al funds were not at stake, Stan
ford would ideally adopt the clear
and convincing standard while
pursuing other means to encour
age sexual assault reporting that
do not jeopardize the rights of the
accused.
