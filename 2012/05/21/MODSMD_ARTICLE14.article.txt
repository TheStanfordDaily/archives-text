# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Hypocrisy and the ARP debate 
### Miles Unterreiner 
I want to suggest that both ar
dent proponents and harsh crit
ics of the Alternative Review
Process roughly speaking, al
though the partisan lines are not
nearly this simple and clean-cut,
"liberals" and "conservatives"
take a moment to reexamine their
opinions about the ARP against
the light of their own deeply held
moral and ideological convictions.
Because it seems to me that both
sides have abandoned important
tenets of their larger philosophies
in their pursuit of policy victory.
Let's start with the so-called
civil libertarian or leftist position.
This campus recently witnessed a
widely supported drive to collect
signatures for a California ballot
referendum outlawing the death
penalty in this state on the grounds
that (among other reasons) it is
racially discriminatory, convicts
and executes innocent people and
denies the accused due process of
law. More broadly, law-and-order
liberals tend to worry a great deal
about the possibility of false con
victions in criminal cases, the right
of defendants to adequate counsel
and the overly harsh nature and
length of criminal sentences. They
also argue that severe punishment
of offenders doesn't necessarily
bring "closure" or relief to victims
or victims' families, dismissing the
"family's feelings" rationale for
imposing exacting retribution
upon violent criminals.
So what happened to the left's
supposed dedication to protecting
the rights of the accused against
the abuses of an overly harsh and
inflexible system? It seems odd
that campus liberals are now argu
ing for (among other things) a sys
tem that denies the accused the
right to face his accuser, does not
provide him with an attorney or
qualified attorney substitute, elim
inates the traditional right of the

accused to be considered innocent
until proven guilty, removes his
right to call witnesses in his favor
and to cross-examine the witnesses
assembled against him and can
place the accused in situations of
double jeopardy.
It might be argued in response
that broader social paradigms sim
ply don't apply on a communal col
lege campus, where everyone
knows everyone else, racism does
n't exist and the possibility for false
convictions is low or nonexistent.
First of all, that comparison is
slightly illogical: areas of the coun
try with less racism or a smaller
town vibe don't have fewer legal
protections for accused criminals,
and as Stanford sets up its own
quasi-judicial system, it's not clear
why we should either.
But for an illustration closer to
home, let me refer you to a now-fa
mous report from the Stanford Po
lice Department of April 9th, 2011,
reporting a sexual assault on Stan
ford campus by an unidentified male,
"Black, around 30 years of age"
who suddenly morphed into an
"Asian Indian" man who smelled of
a "scent similar to apples" upon fur
ther reflection by the victim. Any
chance for a false conviction there, or
any sense that race might play a role
in influencing memory or justice,
even on this campus?
But the standard "conserva
tive" position on the ARP is equal
ly bizarre and contradictory. Out of
a broader ideological ethos that
trumpets harsher punishments for
all, fewer protections for alleged
criminals and a swift resolution to
cases involving people who were
obviously guilty all along has magi
cally emerged a deep and nuanced
concern for the natural rights of un
justly accused Stanford males, un
fairly trampled under the heel of an
oppressive judicial system. Where
did that come from?

As soon as the women of this
campus are the victims, the conser
vative narrative seems to imply, the
possibility for false convictions sky
rockets; the Bureau of Judicial Af
fairs undergoes a nefarious trans
formation into a totalitarian regime
bent on expelling innocent frat
boys, rather than an institution ded
icated to the pursuit of justice; and
the lack of technical protections for
the accused becomes an immense
concern every student on campus
should deplore, rather than a posi
tive development facilitating the
justified punishment of depraved
felons. A little consistency, please.
Ultimately, it seems that where
the ARP is concerned, all sides are
willing to throw their intellectual
baggage out the window. Campus
liberals become stern law-and
order enforcers, thumping their
fists on the table and demanding
justice for victims, while campus
conservatives suddenly acquire a
passion for the fine details of due
process and fair trials, quibbling
over the legal technicalities they
usually detest when applied to so
ciety at large.
As the ARP becomes the third
rail of campus politics, emotional
op-eds fly and the old Undergrad
uate Senate punts the question to
the new senate, fearing to actually
accomplish something important,
let's all take a moment and think
about whether our opinions on this
important policy issue are in fact
consistent with our deeper under
lying values. If we do, the final re
sult will be more honest, more
thorough and, in the end, a great
deal more meaningful.

First of all, that comparison is

reporting a sexual assault on Stan
ford campus by an unidentified male,
"Black, around 30 years of age"
who suddenly morphed into an
"Asian Indian" man who smelled of
a "scent similar to apples" upon fur

chance for a false conviction there, or
any sense that race might play a role

even on this campus?
But the standard "conserva

a broader ideological ethos that
trumpets harsher punishments for
all, fewer protections for alleged
criminals and a swift resolution to
cases involving people who were
obviously guilty all along has magi
cally emerged a deep and nuanced
concern for the natural rights of un
justly accused Stanford males, un
fairly trampled under the heel of an
oppressive judicial system. Where
did that come from?

As soon as the women of this
campus are the victims, the conser

possibility for false convictions sky
rockets; the Bureau of Judicial Af

formation into a totalitarian regime
bent on expelling innocent frat
boys, rather than an institution ded
icated to the pursuit of justice; and
the lack of technical protections for
the accused becomes an immense
concern every student on campus
should deplore, rather than a posi

justified punishment of depraved
felons. A little consistency, please.
Ultimately, it seems that where
the ARP is concerned, all sides are
willing to throw their intellectual
baggage out the window. Campus
liberals become stern law-and
order enforcers, thumping their
fists on the table and demanding
justice for victims, while campus
conservatives suddenly acquire a
passion for the fine details of due
process and fair trials, quibbling
over the legal technicalities they
usually detest when applied to so
ciety at large.
As the ARP becomes the third
rail of campus politics, emotional
op-eds fly and the old Undergrad
uate Senate punts the question to
the new senate, fearing to actually
accomplish something important,
let's all take a moment and think
about whether our opinions on this
important policy issue are in fact
consistent with our deeper under
lying values. If we do, the final re
sult will be more honest, more
thorough and, in the end, a great
deal more meaningful.

I want to suggest that both ar
dent proponents and harsh crit
ics of the Alternative Review
Process roughly speaking, al
though the partisan lines are not
nearly this simple and clean-cut,
"liberals" and "conservatives"
take a moment to reexamine their
opinions about the ARP against
the light of their own deeply held
moral and ideological convictions.
Because it seems to me that both
sides have abandoned important
tenets of their larger philosophies
in their pursuit of policy victory.
Let's start with the so-called
civil libertarian or leftist position.
This campus recently witnessed a
widely supported drive to collect
signatures for a California ballot
referendum outlawing the death
penalty in this state on the grounds
that (among other reasons) it is
racially discriminatory, convicts
and executes innocent people and
denies the accused due process of
law. More broadly, law-and-order
liberals tend to worry a great deal
about the possibility of false con
victions in criminal cases, the right
of defendants to adequate counsel
and the overly harsh nature and
length of criminal sentences. They
also argue that severe punishment
of offenders doesn't necessarily
bring "closure" or relief to victims
or victims' families, dismissing the
"family's feelings" rationale for
imposing exacting retribution
upon violent criminals.
So what happened to the left's
supposed dedication to protecting
the rights of the accused against
the abuses of an overly harsh and
inflexible system? It seems odd
that campus liberals are now argu
ing for (among other things) a sys
tem that denies the accused the
right to face his accuser, does not
provide him with an attorney or
qualified attorney substitute, elim
inates the traditional right of the

accused to be considered innocent
until proven guilty, removes his
right to call witnesses in his favor
and to cross-examine the witnesses
assembled against him and can
place the accused in situations of
double jeopardy.
