# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## Situational friendships 
### Nina Chung 
Not all schools are like Stan
ford, especially when it
comes to people. Outside
Stanford, fame comes from stand
out names, but on the inside, Stan
ford tries hard to get everyone on
the same page. On the first day of
NSO at Roble, for example, each
RA already knew the name of
each student that passed in the
hall.This is how it is at every dorm.
It isn't inherently good or bad.
Some students freak out when
they first arrive and are called out
loudly before saying a single thing.
Other students feel warmly wel
comed, exactly because they don't
have to say a single thing before
being called out so loudly. Most
dorms even feature a world map
with all of the residents' faces on it;
in one glance, everyone is held to
gether nicely in one frame. Stan
ford also places dining halls strate
gically close to living areas, so that
not much transportation is re
quired between sleeping and eat
ing. So, for most Stanford fresh
men, meals-with-friends equals
meals-with-dormmates.
Thus, the freshman dorm is often
the central life headquarters, and op
portunities for bonding are pre
pared in advance. Compare this to
Carnegie Mellon, where "you're on
your own" (as my little brother said).
The year after, though, there's
this thing called the "sophomore
slump." This phenomenon is
shared by enough college students
that it gets a title. It's probably a
complicated psychological phase
that involves academic disillusion
ment and identity reanalysis,
among other things. But, also, stu
dents just have to move their resi

dence, In sophomore year, famil
iar faces that used to head down to
5:15 p.m. dinner together are dis
persed. This small fact can make
the second year at the same school
feel like a different world. Many
friends just don't seem as close
anymore by location. They
might even be "all the way across
campus." A lot of students seem to
think this is the main reason they
stop meeting. Beginning sopho
more year, students even start say
ing it's hard to meet new friends in
classes. Either that or a friendship
formed within 10 weeks ostensibly
disintegrates by the next quarter.
A friend's sister at Harvard con
siders all of Stanford's community
campaigning very contrived: stu
dents dropped conveniently into
community-looking structures and
encouraged to make what look like
friends. She sees it as misleadingly
free of individual action. That re
minds me of a girl at the Hume
Writing Center (presumably a
graduate student) I overheard, ar
guing that Stanford holds its stu
dents' hands for everything.
"OH, I never see you anymore!"
we exclaim. It reflects a shift in
friendship that apparently mystifies
us. It's not just from freshman to
sophomore year that we feel our
friendships take chilling turns. It
happens eveiy year we move resi
dences, if in doing so we are separat
ed from a particular hallmate. It
happens every quarter when we
change classes, and a classmate we
used to see at least twice a week
(plus to study) seems to drop off the
face of the earth. What happened?
But it isn't that campus geogra
phy or the quarter system tarnish-

es relationships. Rather, these are
just the things that slot us next to
someone by default, fooling us
into thinking we're engaged in
something real. We don't always
realize, though, that we've gotten
close with a situation and not a
person, or that we have only con
text in common. This is why, when
settings change, the ground falls
out from beneath so many sup
posed friendships.
Relationships are maintained by
outright effort. We prove our fond
ness for someone when we find our
selves pursuing them, especially
when we didn't have to before. This
takes intention, re-prioritizing and
proactivity. Most of the time, we
don't even register we're doing this.
We simply register a thought, which
turns naturally into action, which
represents a legitimate decision
which, ultimately, is the foundation
for something real.
Time tells, but so does place. I
was thinking about this while my lit
tle brother was visiting me this past
weekend. I realized how much I've
always loved our friendship, across
all of the distances we've been apart.
I've also been thinking about this in
the context of graduation, as greater
distances between friends become
the standard situation. Past that cer
emony lies an immense space for us
to decide which relationships are set
in Stanford stone and which come
with us wherever we go.

For now, though, Nina's set at Stan
ford so email her atninamc@stan
