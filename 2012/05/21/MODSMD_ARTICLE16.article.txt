## Halls fall well short of purpose 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
While watching the
Champions League
final between Chelsea
and Bayern Munich
on Saturday, a friend wondered
aloud whether Didier Drogba
was a Hall of Famer or if there's
even a World Soccer Hall of
Fame for him to enter.
As it turns out, the Interna
tional Football Hall of Fame (re
member, most of the world calls
the game played with your feet
"football") exists, but judging by
the fact that the link to its home
page doesn't work and it hardly
shows up on Google, it's not real
ly at the same level as those for
baseball or football.
At first, this seemed odd to
me. Soccer is the most popular
sport in the world, so why would
n't it have something so basic as
a hall of fame? Sure, there are
national halls of fame, but soccer
is such an international sport
that it would seem to require one
hall to rule them all (and I al
ready gave it a tagline). Because
let's face it, there are a lot of halls
of fame. Wikipedia has a whole
article just listing them.
But thinking about it more, I
realized that halls of fame are
not nearly as fundamental a con
cept as I had thought. After all,
the first major hall of fame was
for baseball, which isn't quite 80
years old yet. The Baseball Hall
of Fame was started because,
one, there was a misconception
that baseball had been invented
in Cooperstown, and, two, it
could make money.
The motto for the Baseball
Hall of Fame is "Preserving His
tory, Honoring Excellence, Con
necting Generations." These are
great goals, and having a place to
learn about the best players of
the past is a good thing. But halls
of fame are known much more
for the select groups of former
players (and coaches and others
involved in the game) that get
the honor of being "inducted."
I don't have any problem with
this, but choosing who to include
in the elite class of players is an
unenviable task, no matter what
the sport. Think about it: if some
one asked you to say who are the
five best players in the NBA
right now, or in the NFL or NHL
or MLB or any other sport, you
would almost definitely dis
agree. And these guys all face
each other year after year. Imag
ine comparing players across
generations.
That is what hall of fame vot
ers have to deal with, and all
that's hanging in the balance is
the entire validation of a player's
career. No pressure.
There's no way to decide
whom to induct without some ar
guments and flaws, but that still
doesn't stop me from having a
beef with the major halls of
fame.
Last year, Bert Blyleven was
inducted into the Baseball Hall
of Fame, When he retired in
1992, he had 285 wins and 3,701
strikeouts. In his first year of eli
gibility in 1998, he had 285 wins
and 3,701 strikeouts, but he did
not get into the Hall. For each of
the next 13 years, his statistics
did not change, but his Hall of
Fame vote percentage did
change every year, although it
wasn't until last year that the
votes eclipsed the 75-percent
threshold necessary for en
shrinement. As of right now, he
still has 285 wins and 3,701
strikeouts, but he's now in the
elite club of baseball players.
What changed? Blyleven's
pitching didn't. And you can't
tell me that people's perspective
on him changed for 14 straight
years. But in the ridiculous sys
tem we have now, a player can be
on the ballot 15 years in a row.
And a lot of times, it takes sever
al years to get the necessary
total.
My question is simple: why
can't you make up your minds
the first time? Why not just wait
10 years or so after players finish
playing so you get some perspec
tive without many players dying
before they can be eligible? Give
voters one chance. A yes or a no,
and that's it.
And while we're at it, let vot
