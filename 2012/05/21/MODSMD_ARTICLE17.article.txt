# UNDEFEATED AT UTAH
## STANFORD SWEEPS BY YET AGAIN 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 12 Stanford baseball
team did its job this weekend in
Salt Lake City. Now, it's going to
need a little help in the final week
of Pac-12 play.
Only two games separate the
top five teams in the conference,
and the Cardinal (36-14, 17-10
Pac-12) is right in the mix after a
crucial road sweep of Utah (14-
38,7-23). Stanford, No. 11 UCLA
and Arizona State are just two
games behind conference-lead
ing No. 10 Oregon (19-8), with
No. 17 Arizona only a game back
at 18-9.
Stanford's starting pitchers
were instrumental in moving the
squad into that tie for third place,
allowing 15 hits and striking out
27 Utes in 23.2 combined innings.
Redshirt junior lefthander Brett
Mooneyham regained his tradi
tional Saturday spot in style, post
ing double-digit strikeouts for the
first time since March 3, while
junior Stephen Piscotty contin
ued his surprising success as a
starter, giving up only one run
over 6.1 innings on Sunday after
noon.
"We knew Utah was a team
that could beat us on any given
day," junior righty Mark Appel,
who threw a complete-game
shutout of his own on Friday, told
GoStanford.com. "Their record
isn't that great, but they compete
and they battle out there."
Top-to-bottom contributions
at the plate backed up those
pitching efforts, with each of the
eight hitters that started in all
three games knocking in at least
one run over the weekend. Stan
ford's infielders were particularly
on top of things, with sophomore

first baseman Brian Ragira, soph
omore second baseman Danny
Diekroeger and freshman third
baseman Alex Blandino all
homering and junior shortstop
Kenny Diekroeger adding two
RBIs of his own.
The Cardinal might not have

put up more than two runs in
any inning this weekend
which was only the case for
Stanford in one other series this
year, when it lost two of three
Oregon but the consistency
was enough to earn it three
comfortable victories.

As Stanford fans are accus
tomed to by now, Appel (9-1)
stole the show on Friday night
with his fourth complete game of
the season, just hours after having
been named a Howser Trophy
semifinalist, an award presented
annually to the best player in col
lege baseball. His 13 strikeouts
put him at 109 on the year, just shy
of his career total of 112 from be
fore this season, and at one point,
he retired 12 batters in a row dur
ing the Cardinal baseball team's
first-ever visit to the Utah cam
pus.
"The slider was moving really
well," Appel said. "Especially for
the high altitudes, you wouldn't
expect that."
Junior catcher Eric Smith was
the only player with an RBI hit in
the game, as he opened the scor
ing with a two-run single in the
top of the fourth. Then, Stanford's
small-ball gradually extended its
lead, with two RBI groundouts
and two sac flies building a com
fortable six-run cushion for
Appel to work with over the final
three innings.
The potential No. 1 overall
draft pick got a flyout with two
runners in scoring position to end
the game and preserve his
shutout.
Mooneyham's effort on Satur
day was arguably just as impres
sive, especially considering the
lefty's up-and-down season that
saw him lose four in a row before
his recent resurgence. He retired
the first six Ute batters he faced
and struck out at least one in each
of the first five innings, but given
his recent efforts to fix some me
chanical issues, Mooneyham (7-
4) still wasn't satisfied.
"[I was] a little bit inconsistent
in the beginning of the start me
chanically," he said. "I just talked
to [pitching coach Rusty] Filter
after the second, ironed it out and
felt like I had a lot better com
mand after that."

Third baseman Alex Blandino had a two-run home run on Sunday to
complement two more RBI on Saturday and continue his stellar freshman
season. Blandino has now knocked in 34 runs in just 118 at-bats
and is second on the team with seven homers behind Austin Wilson.

and Virginia met in the NCAA Tournament last year, and the result

in the first when Piscotty reached
on a two-out error and Ragira
doubled him home. A Kenny
Diekroeger sac fly made it 2-0 an
inning later and two more runs
came around in the fourth, thanks
to a wild pitch and another sac fly,
this one from junior centerfielder
Jake Stewart.
Ragira brought out some
power again with a two-run
homer in the fifth to force Ute
starter Joe Pond from the game.
Mooneyham allowed Utah's first
run of the series on a seventh-in
ning single by Utah second base
man Cory Hunt, but the sopho
more was gunned out by Stewart
trying to stretch it into a double,
ending the inning.
Two more insurance runs on a
single by Blandino in the ninth
clinched a series win for Stanford,
but the Cardinal knew that it real
ly needed a third win if it wanted
to continue to improve its playoff
positioning.
It was up to Piscotty to hold
down the fort in his second career
start, and even without the flair for

strikeouts of Stanford's other two
starters, he threw 6.1 solid innings
for the second weekend in a row.
Danny Diekroeger opened the
scoring with a third-inning solo
homer, marking the 29th time that
the Cardinal has scored first this
season. The squad had gone 24-4 in
those previous 28 contests, and
Blandino made sure that trend
would continue with a two-run
home run, his seventh of the season,
in the top of the sixth to make it 3-0.
After a Ragira fielder's choice
extended the lead to four, two
straight Utah hits in the bottom of
the seventh left runners at the cor
ners with one out, a potentially dan
gerous situation. Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess replaced
Piscotty with sophomore AJ. Vane
gas and only one of those runs
would score, as Vanegas struck out
three Utes over his 2.2 innings to
secure his fifth save of the season
and Piscotty's fourth win.
The Cardinal will head to
Santa Clara to face the Broncos at
6 p.m. on Tuesday and will then
close out its season against cross
bay rival Cal at Sunken Diamond
next weekend with postseason
positioning on the line.

the game, as he opened the scor
ing with a two-run single in the
top of the fourth. Then, Stanford's
small-ball gradually extended its
lead, with two RBI groundouts
and two sac flies building a com
fortable six-run cushion for
Appel to work with over the final
three innings.
The potential No. 1 overall
draft pick got a flyout with two
runners in scoring position to end
the game and preserve his
shutout.
Mooneyham's effort on Satur
day was arguably just as impres
sive, especially considering the
lefty's up-and-down season that
saw him lose four in a row before
his recent resurgence. He retired
the first six Ute batters he faced
and struck out at least one in each
of the first five innings, but given
his recent efforts to fix some me
chanical issues, Mooneyham (7-
4) still wasn't satisfied.
"[I was] a little bit inconsistent
in the beginning of the start me
chanically," he said. "I just talked
to [pitching coach Rusty] Filter
after the second, ironed it out and
felt like I had a lot better com
mand after that."

Third baseman Alex Blandino had a two-run home run on Sunday to
complement two more RBI on Saturday and continue his stellar freshman
season. Blandino has now knocked in 34 runs in just 118 at-bats
and is second on the team with seven homers behind Austin Wilson.

in the first when Piscotty reached
on a two-out error and Ragira
doubled him home. A Kenny
Diekroeger sac fly made it 2-0 an
inning later and two more runs
came around in the fourth, thanks
to a wild pitch and another sac fly,
this one from junior centerfielder
Jake Stewart.
Ragira brought out some
power again with a two-run
homer in the fifth to force Ute
starter Joe Pond from the game.
Mooneyham allowed Utah's first
run of the series on a seventh-in
ning single by Utah second base
man Cory Hunt, but the sopho
more was gunned out by Stewart
trying to stretch it into a double,
ending the inning.
Two more insurance runs on a
single by Blandino in the ninth
clinched a series win for Stanford,
but the Cardinal knew that it real
ly needed a third win if it wanted
to continue to improve its playoff
positioning.
It was up to Piscotty to hold
down the fort in his second career
start, and even without the flair for

strikeouts of Stanford's other two
starters, he threw 6.1 solid innings
for the second weekend in a row.
Danny Diekroeger opened the
scoring with a third-inning solo
homer, marking the 29th time that
the Cardinal has scored first this
season. The squad had gone 24-4 in
those previous 28 contests, and
Blandino made sure that trend
would continue with a two-run
home run, his seventh of the season,
in the top of the sixth to make it 3-0.
After a Ragira fielder's choice
extended the lead to four, two
straight Utah hits in the bottom of
the seventh left runners at the cor
ners with one out, a potentially dan
gerous situation. Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess replaced
Piscotty with sophomore AJ. Vane
gas and only one of those runs
would score, as Vanegas struck out
three Utes over his 2.2 innings to
secure his fifth save of the season
and Piscotty's fourth win.
The Cardinal will head to
Santa Clara to face the Broncos at
6 p.m. on Tuesday and will then
close out its season against cross
bay rival Cal at Sunken Diamond
next weekend with postseason
positioning on the line.

The No. 12 Stanford baseball
team did its job this weekend in
Salt Lake City. Now, it's going to
need a little help in the final week
of Pac-12 play.
Only two games separate the
top five teams in the conference,
and the Cardinal (36-14, 17-10
Pac-12) is right in the mix after a
crucial road sweep of Utah (14-
38,7-23). Stanford, No. 11 UCLA
and Arizona State are just two
games behind conference-lead
ing No. 10 Oregon (19-8), with
No. 17 Arizona only a game back
at 18-9.
Stanford's starting pitchers
were instrumental in moving the
squad into that tie for third place,
allowing 15 hits and striking out
27 Utes in 23.2 combined innings.
Redshirt junior lefthander Brett
Mooneyham regained his tradi
tional Saturday spot in style, post
ing double-digit strikeouts for the
first time since March 3, while
junior Stephen Piscotty contin
ued his surprising success as a
starter, giving up only one run
over 6.1 innings on Sunday after
noon.
"We knew Utah was a team
that could beat us on any given
day," junior righty Mark Appel,
who threw a complete-game
shutout of his own on Friday, told
GoStanford.com. "Their record
isn't that great, but they compete
and they battle out there."
Top-to-bottom contributions
at the plate backed up those
pitching efforts, with each of the
eight hitters that started in all
three games knocking in at least
one run over the weekend. Stan
ford's infielders were particularly
on top of things, with sophomore

first baseman Brian Ragira, soph
omore second baseman Danny
Diekroeger and freshman third
baseman Alex Blandino all
homering and junior shortstop
Kenny Diekroeger adding two
RBIs of his own.
The Cardinal might not have

put up more than two runs in
any inning this weekend
which was only the case for
Stanford in one other series this
year, when it lost two of three
Oregon but the consistency
was enough to earn it three
comfortable victories.

As Stanford fans are accus
tomed to by now, Appel (9-1)
stole the show on Friday night
with his fourth complete game of
the season, just hours after having
been named a Howser Trophy
semifinalist, an award presented
annually to the best player in col
lege baseball. His 13 strikeouts
put him at 109 on the year, just shy
of his career total of 112 from be
fore this season, and at one point,
he retired 12 batters in a row dur
ing the Cardinal baseball team's
first-ever visit to the Utah cam
pus.
"The slider was moving really
well," Appel said. "Especially for
the high altitudes, you wouldn't
expect that."
