# CAVALIER KRYPTONITE
## VIRGINIA CUTS CARD AGAIN 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The No. 11 Stanford men's
tennis team once again encoun
tered heartbreak in the quarter
finals of the NCAA team tour
nament this weekend, losing 4-0
Sunday to No. 3 Virginia after
defeating No. 6 Kentucky 4-1 in
the round of 16 on Friday.
The loss against Virginia (28-
1, 11-0 ACC) was the second
time in as many years the Cardi
nal (20-9, 5-2 Pac-12) has fallen
against the Cavaliers in the final
eight, with a run to the quarterfi
nals last year being brought to
an abrupt end in a 4-3 decision
against the eventual finalists.
The Cardinal entered the
match against Kentucky (28-6,
11-0 SEC) as nominal under
dogs seemingly peaking at just
the right time, after emphatic
victories over Sacramento State
and Santa Clara in earlier
rounds of the tournament. The
Cardinal was also looking to
replicate the upset at Kentucky,
when the Card won 4-1 at the
National Team Indoor Champi
onships in February.
"Beating [Kentucky] at in
doors certainly gave us plenty of
confidence going into the match
that, if we had a complete team

effort, we could get the job
done," said senior Bradley
Klahn.
The Cardinal, however, fell
behind quickly, losing the dou
bles point with the pairings of
senior Ryan Thacher with junior
Denis Lin and junior Matt Kan
dath with sophomore Jamin Ball
both losing 8-2.
"We got our tails whipped in
the doubles," Klahn said. "But
when we came out after the
break for singles, I could see it in
everyone's eyes that we were
going to turn the match around."
The Cardinal did just that,
picking up the first set in all six
singles matches.
"There was never any doubt
in our team that we could come
out with four points," Klahn
said. "Those first 30 minutes of
singles really set the tone for the
match, reversing any momen
tum Kentucky generated from
the doubles."
The Wildcats fought back,
winning the second set in four of
the matchups, but Klahn, play
ing at the No. 1 position, and
Thacher, playing No. 2, tri
umphed 6-1,6-2 and 6-1,7-5 re
spectively to put the Cardinal
ahead 2-1.
Sophomore Daniel Ho ex
tended Stanford's lead further
with a 6-3,2-6,6-4 victory on court
five, before freshman John Mor
rissey clinched the win on court
four with a 6-1, 3-6, 5-4 triumph.
Morrissey's win, which was
marked by several dramatic shifts
in momentum, concluded when a
series of code violations assessed
against his opponent culminated
in a default with Morrissey serv
ing on match point.
"Friday's performance was
one of the best I have seen all sea
son and in my four years at [Stan
ford] as far as the team coming to
gether, showing grit and determi
nation and playing well at the
right time," Klahn said. "[Ken
tucky] certainly didn't make it
easy for us, but I was really proud
of our team for sticking with our
game plan and staying tough
down the stretch."
Last year's quarterfinal defeat
against Virginia as well as a 4-1
loss at the Indoors in February
quickly came to mind for the Cardi
nal as it prepared for Sunday's
match against the Cavaliers, who
were entering their eighth straight
NCAA tournament quarterfinal.
"For all of us who were in
volved in last year's match, we
know how close we came to pulling
off the win, and every one of us be
lieved we could and should have
won that match," Klahn said be
forehand. "Similarly, we played
them very tough this year on their
home courts, and that gives us a lot

of confidence."
The Cardinal started quicker
in the doubles than against Ken
tucky, with Klahn and Morrissey
triumphing 8-5 out of the No. 2
position, but losses by the other
two pairings meant that the Cava
liers were able to clinch the dou
bles point.
Unlike Friday's match, the
Cardinal struggled to reassert it
self in the singles component
and suffered a collapse on the
middle courts. Kandath, Morris
sey and Ho all lost in straight
sets, allowing the Cavaliers to
claim victory before the Cardi
nal could get onto the score
board. Freshman Robert Stine
man, who was leading 6-4,2-1 on
court six when his match was
abandoned, was the only Stan
ford player to win a set.
The loss brings the Cardinal's
team season to a close, marking
the fourth straight year that Stan
ford has surpassed 20 wins but
also extending a relative drought
in the NCAA tournament. De
spite holding a record 18 national
championships and an all-time
103-18 postseason record, the
Cardinal has failed to progress
beyond the quarterfinals since
2003 and last lifted the tourna
ment trophy in 2000.
Nevertheless, the season isn't
over yet for Klahn and Thacher.
Both seniors will participate in
the NCAA singles champi
onships as at-large bids and will
combine as the No. 4 pairing in
the doubles tournament.
Both competitions will begin
on May 23 in Athens, Ga.
