# CAVALIER KRYPTONITE
## VIRGINIA CUTS CARD AGAIN 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The No. 11 Stanford men's
tennis team once again encoun
tered heartbreak in the quarter
finals of the NCAA team tour
nament this weekend, losing 4-0
Sunday to No. 3 Virginia after
defeating No. 6 Kentucky 4-1 in
the round of 16 on Friday.
The loss against Virginia (28-
1, 11-0 ACC) was the second
time in as many years the Cardi
nal (20-9, 5-2 Pac-12) has fallen
against the Cavaliers in the final
eight, with a run to the quarterfi
nals last year being brought to
an abrupt end in a 4-3 decision
against the eventual finalists.
The Cardinal entered the
match against Kentucky (28-6,
11-0 SEC) as nominal under
dogs seemingly peaking at just
the right time, after emphatic
victories over Sacramento State
and Santa Clara in earlier
rounds of the tournament. The
Cardinal was also looking to
replicate the upset at Kentucky,
when the Card won 4-1 at the
National Team Indoor Champi
onships in February.
"Beating [Kentucky] at in
doors certainly gave us plenty of
confidence going into the match
that, if we had a complete team

effort, we could get the job
done," said senior Bradley
Klahn.
The Cardinal, however, fell
behind quickly, losing the dou
bles point with the pairings of
senior Ryan Thacher with junior
Denis Lin and junior Matt Kan
dath with sophomore Jamin Ball
both losing 8-2.
"We got our tails whipped in
the doubles," Klahn said. "But
when we came out after the
break for singles, I could see it in
everyone's eyes that we were
going to turn the match around."
The Cardinal did just that,
picking up the first set in all six
singles matches.
"There was never any doubt
in our team that we could come
out with four points," Klahn
said. "Those first 30 minutes of
singles really set the tone for the
match, reversing any momen
tum Kentucky generated from
the doubles."
The Wildcats fought back,
winning the second set in four of
the matchups, but Klahn, play
ing at the No. 1 position, and
Thacher, playing No. 2, tri
umphed 6-1,6-2 and 6-1,7-5 re
spectively to put the Cardinal
ahead 2-1.
