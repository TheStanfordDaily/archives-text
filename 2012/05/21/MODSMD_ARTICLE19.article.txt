# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Card eliminated in quarterfinals 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
In each of the past two seasons, the No. 5
Stanford women's tennis team has reached
the finals of the NCAA tournament, but the
Cardinal will not complete the trifecta, as its
season came to an end after a 4-2 loss to USC
in the quarterfinals in Athens, Ga.
Fourth-seeded Stanford (21-2,9-1 Pac-12)
entered Saturday's match as the only one-loss
team in the nation. The squad had beaten
USC (24-3) 4-2 at home earlier in the season,
though the doubles point was not played that
day due to inclement weather. That was fifth
seeded USC's only conference loss, and the
Trojans also finished 9-1 in the conference

and shared the Pac-12 title along with Stan
ford.
On Saturday, the Cardinal dropped the
doubles point for only the second time all sea
son an ominous sign, considering the first
time was in its lone regular-season loss to
UCLA.
Stanford's No. 2 doubles team of freshman
Ellen Tsay and junior Stacey Tan finished
first, winning 8-5, but then sophomore Nicole
Gibbs and junior Mallory Burdette fell 8-6 on
the first court in a rematch of the Pac-12
Championship doubles final. The pair fell be
hind USC's Kaitlyn Christian and Sabrina
Santamaria 7-2 before winning four straight
games to make it 7-6. That was the closest
they would get, though, and Gibbs and Bur

dette are now 0-2 this year against USC's top
pair.
Senior Veronica Li and sophomore Kristie
Ahn lost 8-6 in their first match since early
March to clinch the doubles point for the Tro
jans. Ahn, an Ail-American last year, was
making her first appearance for the team
since a foot injury sidelined her more than
two months ago. She also appeared in singles,
where her match was abandoned in the third
set after USC clinched the victory.
"[Getting Ahn back] was really positive
for us going forward," said head coach Lele
Forood.
Stanford's chances in singles looked
promising early, as it won five of
the six first sets. Li and Gibbs
were able to secure wins in their
second sets, but every other
match went to a decisive third set.
Forood had foreshadowed this
issue earlier in the week when
Stanford defeated Northwestern.
"We have to find away to fin
ish some of those matches a little
bit better in the future if we're
going to be contenders here," she
said.
Li, the only senior on the team,
got a 6-4, 7-5 win her 80th ca
reer singles victory â€”in what
would turn out to be the final
match of her Stanford career.
Burdette's 4-6,6-2,6-4 loss was
her first defeat in a dual match all
season. The Georgia native had
been 19-0 in team competitions.
Tsay also lost her final two
sets, falling 1-6, 6-2, 6-2 on court
five. The return of Ahn moved
Tsay back one court from her
typical place on court four and
shifted Li to court six, while jun
ior Natalie Dillon did not play for
the first time in this tournament.
The clinching game was on
court three, where Tan lost in a
third-set tiebreak, 7-5,1 -6,7-6 (5).
"[The match was] a pretty
amazing roller coaster," Forood
said. "I don't think anybody knew
the outcome until it really ended."
Tan, Burdette and Gibbs will
now gear up for the singles por
tion of the NCAA tournament,
which starts on Wednesday.
No. 3 Gibbs will be one of the
favorites of the tournament and
is the most likely to make a deep
run, although No. 5 Burdette will
also be a threat.The two actually
faced off in the final of the ITA
Northwest Regional Champi
onship in October, and it took
Gibbs three sets to beat Bur
dette.
Gibbs, who is riding an eleven
match win streak, also won the
Pac-12 singles championship last
month, defeating Tan along the
way.
Stanford's top two doubles
teams will also be competing next
week in the tournament. Bur
dette and Gibbs are the second
seed, while Tan and Tsay, ranked
25th, have an at-large bid.
