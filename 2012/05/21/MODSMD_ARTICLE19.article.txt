## Card eliminated in quarterfinals 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
In each of the past two seasons, the No. 5
Stanford women's tennis team has reached
the finals of the NCAA tournament, but the
Cardinal will not complete the trifecta, as its
season came to an end after a 4-2 loss to USC
in the quarterfinals in Athens, Ga.
Fourth-seeded Stanford (21-2,9-1 Pac-12)
entered Saturday's match as the only one-loss
team in the nation. The squad had beaten
USC (24-3) 4-2 at home earlier in the season,
though the doubles point was not played that
day due to inclement weather. That was fifth
seeded USC's only conference loss, and the
Trojans also finished 9-1 in the conference

and shared the Pac-12 title along with Stan
ford.
On Saturday, the Cardinal dropped the
doubles point for only the second time all sea
son an ominous sign, considering the first
time was in its lone regular-season loss to
UCLA.
Stanford's No. 2 doubles team of freshman
Ellen Tsay and junior Stacey Tan finished
first, winning 8-5, but then sophomore Nicole
Gibbs and junior Mallory Burdette fell 8-6 on
the first court in a rematch of the Pac-12
Championship doubles final. The pair fell be
hind USC's Kaitlyn Christian and Sabrina
Santamaria 7-2 before winning four straight
games to make it 7-6. That was the closest
they would get, though, and Gibbs and Bur

dette are now 0-2 this year against USC's top
pair.
Senior Veronica Li and sophomore Kristie
Ahn lost 8-6 in their first match since early
March to clinch the doubles point for the Tro
jans. Ahn, an Ail-American last year, was
making her first appearance for the team
since a foot injury sidelined her more than
two months ago. She also appeared in singles,
where her match was abandoned in the third
set after USC clinched the victory.
"[Getting Ahn back] was really positive
for us going forward," said head coach Lele
Forood.
