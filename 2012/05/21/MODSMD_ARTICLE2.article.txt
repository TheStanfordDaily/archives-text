## Stanford Concert Network records profit

Modest Mouse headlined the
Frost Revival Music and Arts Fes
tival on Saturday afternoon at the
Laurence Frost Amphitheater,
marking the first time the venue
had been used for this large of an
event since the 1980s.
The festival was planned by
the Stanford Concert Network
(SCN) and featured musical per
formances by Modest Mouse,
Eyes Lips Eyes and Benjamin
Francis Leftwich. In addition to
the musical performers, Frost
Amphitheater also housed nu
merous large-scale student art
projects.
According to SCN co-director
Alberto Aroeste 'l3, organizers
sold 4,500 tickets in presale. The
amphitheater has a capacity of
5,400.
Katie Chabolla, SCN's finan
cial officer, confirmed there was a

profit from ticket sales.
'All profits will go into a fund
for next year's festival," she said.
Frost was open not only to
Stanford students and affiliates,
but also the general public.
"The crowd that the musical
artists drew is really fun," Eliza
beth Matus 'l4 said at the show.
"Lots of people from the city
showed up, and I really don't feel
like I'm at school at all."
Attendees came not just for
the music, but the atmosphere, as
well. Frost is a renowned venue
that has had an illustrious history
of visiting artists, and its revival
was long anticipated.
"I had never heard of the first
two artists but I was still really ex
cited to come enjoy them," said
Emily Kizzia, 'l2. "I would have
come for any artist. I really came
for the incredible vibes."
For most students, Frost had
been mostly forgotten, as very few

events are held there and none
come close to filling its huge ca
pacity.
"The biggest event I've been to
at Frost before this was senior
wine tasting," Kizzia said. "That's
how I realized how incredible this
event was going to be. I didn't re
ally know it was there before. And
the fact that you can't see any part

of campus from inside makes me
really feel like I'm not on cam
pus."
During the past two New Stu
dent Orientations (NSO), Gram
my Award-winning bassist Victor
Wooten has entertained new stu
dents in concerts at Frost.
"I feel like I got introduced to
Frost right away because of the

Victor Wooten concert during
NSO," Matus said. "It was so se
cluded yet open at the same time,
and I thought, 'What is this place?
It's absolutely beautiful.' I was
also excited because I had heard
they were giving out these art
grants so that students could
