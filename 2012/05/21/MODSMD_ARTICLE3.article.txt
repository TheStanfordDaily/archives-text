# Surgery is basic care, Wren says
## Lack of trained surgeons leads to globed inequity

"As a nation and as a world, we
have to reject the current dogma
that surgery is not part of global
health," said Sherry Wren, Stan
ford Medical Center professor of
general surgery, during her TEDx
talk at Stanford on Saturday.
Wren said surgery lacks a pres
ence in global health agendas be
cause it is perceived as a costly luxu
ry item and requires more trained
personnel.
"It is a commonly held dogma
that surgery is expensive and not
cost effective," Wren said. "Any
body in the U.S. with a surgery bill
would think it's expensive."
But Wren noted that surgery is
cost effective. She explained that an
average surgery costs between $ll
and $33 per disability-adjusted life
year, a measure used to assess dis

that to the cost of common public
health campaigns like HIV treat

both cost hundreds of dollars more
per disability-adjusted life year.
Wren said that surgery is a part
of basic care as opposed to a luxu
ry item.
Currently, surgery is a luxury
item for those in low-income coun
tries. Less than four percent of all
surgeries are performed in low-in
come countries. Two billion people
lack access to surgical care, and al
though one-twenty-fifth of people
in the world undergo surgery, 30
percent of that population ac
counts for 75 percent of the opera
tions, she said.
Wren highlighted the fact that
surgery is necessary for basic care,
noting that 11 percent of diseases
are treatable with surgery. These
common diseases or ailments in
clude burns, hernias, cancer, infec
tion, congenital birth defects, gas
trointestinal diseases, trauma and
maternal-fetal health risks. Ninety
percent of injury-related deaths
occur in low-income countries,
Wren said.
Stressing that surgery should be
considered basic care, she asked
the audience to consider that one
in every four men will have a her
nia in his lifetime, amounting to 20
million per year.
Finally, Wren said that a lack of
