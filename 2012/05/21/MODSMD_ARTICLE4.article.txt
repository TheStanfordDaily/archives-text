### SASHA ARIJANTO MANAGING EDITOR 
On Saturday, 27 speakers
and artists delivered perform
ances, demonstrations and
talks to a packed CEMEX Au
ditorium for TEDxStanford
2012, Stanford's first independ
ently organized TED confer
ence. The event, produced by
the Office of Public Affairs in
partnership with the Graduate
School of Business and the
School of Engineering, was or
ganized around the central
theme of illumination.
The performances and talks
were organized into three ses
sions throughout the day, divid
ing into the categories "Culti
vate," "Captivate" and "Cele
brate." The speakers current
students, alumni, professors

and deans delivered talks in
their respective fields of ex

virtual reality to early detec

Speakers such as Jeremy

currently research and teach at
Stanford, presented their work
on virtual reality and improvi
sation. Bailenson and Klein's
talks were meant as a sample of
their classes Bailenson's
Virtual People and Klein's Be
ginning Improvisation.
While many of the event's
talks focused on innovation
and new technology reflect
ing Stanford's entrepreneurial
ethos there were several in
stances during the day when
speakers cautioned against ex

cessive innovation and drive
that lacks mindfulness for con
text and human needs.
Krista Donaldson M.S. '9B
Ph.D. 'O4 of D-Rev and a re
searcher at The Hasso Plattner
Institute of Design (informally
known as the d.school) urged
budding innovators to consider
context when developing and
delivering new technologies.
Banny Bannerjee M.S. 'OO,
also of the d.school, warned
that students' tendency for bi
nary, oppositional thinking
leads to self-doubt and mis
guided self-reassurance.

talk that parents foster more in
dependence in children rather
than cultivate safe spaces for
undirected achievement.
Some talks more closely re
sembled demonstrations, and the
speaker would call upon the au
dience to act out a series of in
structions. Louis Jackson '9l,
whose teachings fuse the tradi
tions of yoga with modern health
science research, had the audi
ence performing breathing exer
cises to achieve peace of mind.
Klein called on audience

members to create the longest
run-on sentence possible with
those seated near them, while
Esther Gokhale, an anthropolo
gist and back pain expert, in
structed the audience how to re
learn proper pelvic posture and
how to sit.
Notable performances includ
ed 14-year-old cello prodigy Ila
Shon and Pamela Z, who pio
neered the live digital looping
technique for music recording.
Pamela Z projected a video with
dance elements that created a
multimedia experience in the au
ditorium.
TEDxStanford comes on the
heels of STAN (Science, Tech
nology, Art and Nature), which
was produced last May as a pro

totype for events involving short
talks interspersed with perform
ances.
