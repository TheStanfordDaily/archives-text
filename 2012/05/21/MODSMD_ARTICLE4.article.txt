2012, Stanford's first independ

the Office of Public Affairs in
partnership with the Graduate
School of Business and the
School of Engineering, was or
ganized around the central
theme of illumination.
The performances and talks

virtual reality to early detec

talks were meant as a sample of
their classes Bailenson's
Virtual People and Klein's Be
ginning Improvisation.
While many of the event's
talks focused on innovation
and new technology reflect

ethos there were several in
stances during the day when
speakers cautioned against ex

that lacks mindfulness for con

Ph.D. 'O4 of D-Rev and a re

budding innovators to consider
context when developing and
delivering new technologies.
Banny Bannerjee M.S. 'OO,
also of the d.school, warned
that students' tendency for bi
nary, oppositional thinking
leads to self-doubt and mis
guided self-reassurance.
