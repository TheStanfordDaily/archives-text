# Brokaws talk end-of-life decisions
## Father-daughter pair delves into 'taboo'health subject 
### AARON SEKHRI STAFF WRITER 
Peabody Award-winning jour
nalist Tom Brokaw and his
daughter Jennifer Brokaw 'BB,
the founder of Good Medicine, a
private medical practice serving
the Bay Area, appeared at Satur
day's TEDx Stanford conference,
speaking frankly and honestly on
the subject of end-of-life health
care options.
Tom Brokaw began the dia
logue, framed as a conversation
between father and daughter, by
asking the audience to ponder the
reason to have such conversations.
"You are not expected to know,
but you are expected to wish to
know," he said, quoting the late
Yale president Bart Giamatti.
The father-daughter pair dove
straight into the matter at hand,
describing death as "the greatest
certainty we will ever have to
face." Jennifer Brokaw discussed
statistics demonstrating that most
American families are ill-pre
pared to deal with living wills or
situations in which a family mem
ber is no longer able to make de
cisions for himself.
"Only 30 percent of people
have a living wi11... and those
who do are in a position to leave
their families better off emotion
ally and financially," she said.
During the talk, Brokaw asked
her father what his wishes would
be if he were ever in a state where
he could not communicate them
to a doctor.
"I'm a realist, and so I never
want there to be any heroic ef
forts to keep me alive if I am con
fined, am immobile or cannot
communicate with the ones I
love," he said.
Brokaw chided her father for
his lack of specificity to illustrate
that directives for such conditions
must be exceptionally precise.
"When families and doctors
take some enormous decisions on

behalf of others, they need to
make sure they are acting in line
with the priority of their loved
ones," she said.
Only 50 percent of terminally
ill patients have some advanced
directives prepared, she said.
Moreover, of those 50 percent,
only 12 percent had prepared
the directives through consulta
tion with a physician. The re
mainder wrote them with a
lawyer. This, she argued, repre
sents "a crisis in healthcare" as
decisions that few are equipped
to deal with are falling into the
wrong hands.
She praised the United
States' "superb and technologi
cally advanced health care sys

tern" but critiqued its structure.
"Super-specialization means
we end up talking to a lot of -ol
ogists," she said.
She added that, as a result, im
portant discussions with physi
cians who have a holistic knowl
edge of their patients occur less
frequently.
The conversation included a
series of anecdotes intended to
illustrate different aspects of life
and death and the medical care
that can sustain the former. The
duo also elaborated on the fi
nancial angle of the matter, ex
plaining the enormous burden
of full-time medical assistance
and saying that in some cases
people sell off assets to cover

$lOO,OOO to $300,000 per year in
healthcare costs.
"There is a lot of reengineer
ing of our health care system that
needs to take place," Jennifer
Brokaw said. "We have to ask
ourselves: how do you add life to
your years instead of years to
your life?"
Speaking to The Daily, she ex
plained that the idea for the talk
came from personal experience.
"In my own family, my father
is starting to deal with his rela
tives who are near the end of life,
and it got him thinking about his
own stage of life, and what he
wants for himself," she said.
The initial invitation to the
conference was for an entirely

different type of conversation,
but the two Brokaws said they
were happy to address end-of-life
care, an issue they said should not
be the taboo subject that they be
lieve it is.
Tom Brokaw said he felt no
hesitation discussing personal de
tails with a large audience despite
the subject matter.
"In the family, we put every
thing on the table," he said. "And
given how instructive speaking to
my daughter was when my moth
er was passing away, I felt that
talking about this issue was al
most journalistic for me."
