"Once upon a time, a child came across a
butterfly, struggling to emerge from its
chrysalis, and filled with compassion, the child
helped by peeling back the paper shell," said
Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9, Dean of Freshmen
and Undergraduate Advising and Associate
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education at
TEDxStanford on Saturday. "Soon, the butter
fly emerged, but it could not fly. As it turns out,
the butterfly needs the process of struggling on
its own, in order to be able to fly."
During her talk, Lycott-Haims warned

against the dangers of what she calls the
"padded cell of childhood."
"What worries me and my colleagues na
tionwide is the steady decline in the number of
[undergraduate students] that are capable in
going out into the world as adults," Lythcott-
Haims said.
According to her, this behavior is a symp
tom of the increasing tendency of parents to
overprotect their children.
"We hover, we hover over them to ensure
their success, hoist and intervene when need
ed," Lythcott-Haims said. "But do you know
what the message we send them is when we do
that?"

"We are sending the message: 'Hey kid, I do
not trust that you can do this without me,'" she
said.
As a result, Lythcott-Haims noted that
there are more and more "adult children" that
emerge into the world who are happy when
their parents take care of them and who can
not tackle problems and face failures alone.
However, she finished her talk on a positive
note.
"I still think there is time for us to do right
by these amazing young people in our midst
our children, our future," she said.
