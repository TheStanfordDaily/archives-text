# Dean Julie stresses independence as key for kids
## 
### FELIX BOYEAUX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Once upon a time, a child came across a
butterfly, struggling to emerge from its
chrysalis, and filled with compassion, the child
helped by peeling back the paper shell," said
Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9, Dean of Freshmen
and Undergraduate Advising and Associate
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education at
TEDxStanford on Saturday. "Soon, the butter
fly emerged, but it could not fly. As it turns out,
the butterfly needs the process of struggling on
its own, in order to be able to fly."
During her talk, Lycott-Haims warned

against the dangers of what she calls the
"padded cell of childhood."
"What worries me and my colleagues na
tionwide is the steady decline in the number of
[undergraduate students] that are capable in
going out into the world as adults," Lythcott-
Haims said.
According to her, this behavior is a symp
tom of the increasing tendency of parents to
overprotect their children.
"We hover, we hover over them to ensure
their success, hoist and intervene when need
ed," Lythcott-Haims said. "But do you know
what the message we send them is when we do
that?"

"We are sending the message: 'Hey kid, I do
not trust that you can do this without me,'" she
said.
As a result, Lythcott-Haims noted that
there are more and more "adult children" that
emerge into the world who are happy when
their parents take care of them and who can
not tackle problems and face failures alone.
However, she finished her talk on a positive
note.
"I still think there is time for us to do right
by these amazing young people in our midst
our children, our future," she said.
To do so, Lythcott-Haims pro
posed letting the rising generation
explore and experience on their
own.
"We need to back off," Lyth
cott-Haims said. "It is our job as
parents to put ourselves out of the
job."
Acknowledging that parents
want to see their offspring suc
ceed, Lythcott-Haims neverthe
less concluded that the main bur
den should be on the child.
"Sure, we want to see that our
offspring has emerged from that
chrysalis, but it is their job to do
so," she finished. "It is their job to
fly."

In an interview with The Daily
after the talk, Lythcott-Haims ex
plained why she chose this topic

for TEDxStanford.
"I am making my way out into
the world by the end of June to
write about the things that concern
me," she said. "Chief among them
is the topic that I chose today. It
was an opportunity for me to test
drive the ideas and see how the
metaphors worked."
Lythcott-Haims is stepping
down in June to pursue a master of
fine arts in writing with an emphasis
in poetry from the California Col
lege of the Arts in San Francisco.
According to Lythcott-Haims,
Stanford tries to foster this idea of
independence through several
methods.
"When parents seek to behave
in ways that are overinvolved, we
explain that we would really like to

have this conversation with the
student only," she said. "More
proactively with students, we work
on this notion of reflections, small
group conversations with fresh
man students and advisors where
the students can get to know them
selves better."
Lythcott-Haims said she saw
the TEDxStanford event as a
tremendous success.
"I loved it," she said. "When I
heard that TED was coming here,
I was really excited for Stanford.
The event was incredibly well-pro
duced, very professionally organ
ized and an immense pleasure to be
part of."
