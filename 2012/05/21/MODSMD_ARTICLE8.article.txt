### TAYLOR GROSSMAN STAFF WRITER 
The Junot Diaz: A Symposium
event held Friday, May 18 and
Saturday, May 19 in Margaret
Jacks Hall brought together
scholars from around the country
and the Caribbean to speak about
the significance of the work of
Diaz, Pulitzer Prize-winning au
thor of "The Brief Wondrous Life
of Oscar Wao" and creative writ
ing instructor at MIT.
"These two days are ... a
space of conviviality, inter-cultur
ality, a forum for debate, a place to
boast or simply just revel with
each other," said Jose David Sal
divar, undergraduate program di
rector of the Center for Compar
ative Studies in Race and Ethnic
ity. Saldivar was among the three
principle organizers, along with
Monica Hanna, associate profes
sor of English at the United
States Naval Academy, and Jen
nifer Harford Vargas, associate
professor of English at Bryn
Mawr College.
"We were acutely cognizant of
the fact that we would be organiz
ing the first major international
discussion on this important
writer's body of work," Saldivar
wrote in an email to The Daily.
The two-day symposium con
sisted of four roundtable discus
sions as well as the annual Kieve
Distinguished Speaker Lecture,
delivered by Diaz. The Kieve Lec
ture, an annual event endowed by
Anne and Loren Kieve '69, aims
to bring scholars and public fig
ures from around the world to
Stanford to address contempo
rary issues in race and ethnicity.
"I recommended Junot Diaz
for this honor because his work
has profoundly displayed the is
sues of race and ethnicity as part
of the human imagination," Sal
divar said. "In my previous expe
rience as a fellow keynote confer
ence speaker with Junot Diaz, I
had personal knowledge of his
ability to articulate these issues in
a creatively passionate way."
In his address, Diaz first fo
cused on issues surrounding race
and ethnicity in his own fictional
works "Drown" and "The Brief
Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao."
Stepping away from the podium,
Diaz then moved on to a discus
sion of "The Lord of the Rings,"
where he illustrated how he sees
the novel as primarily centered
on race.
"Junot Diaz remained very ac
cessible in the last part of his talk,
when he answered questions pri
marily from the undergraduates
in the audience about how race
was so central to his reading of
Tolkien's work," Saldivar said.
"He concluded with remarkable
attention and focus on his audi
ence, the undergraduates who
had come to see this amazing con
temporary writer ... By using a
book known to almost all of the
undergraduates in the standing
room only audience, he was able
to engage and discuss difficult is
sues with them, issues that are
present in our society today: race,
power, violence."
The symposium was intended

to be accessible to its audience,
with the four roundtable discus
sions designed to create an open
dialogue between panelists and
audience members, Saldivar said.
After individual presentations by
each panelist, the conversation
was opened up to the entire room.
"Symposium comes from the
Greeks and means a space to
drink," Saldivar explained at the
start of the event.
At the first roundtable, stand
ing behind the last row of chairs
and leaning casually against the
back wall of the Terrace Room,
Diaz watched and listened as
scholars debated his work.
When the roundtable evolved
into an animated discussion, how
ever, Diaz became an active par
ticipant. Diaz lent his opinion on
topics ranging from the interpre
tation of his own work to political
issues of contemporary scholar
ship. After one panelist, Arlene
Davila from New York Universi
ty, commented on the defensive
ness exhibited by many scholars
when writing about race and eth
nicity, Diaz added his own
thoughts on the issue.
"How many books published
about racism do not have the
term white supremacy in their in
dexes?" Diaz posed to the audi
ence. "The real beast is still off the
page no one wants to touch it."
The conversation was at its
most animated after Silvio Tor
res-Saillant, a professor of Eng
lish and Latino-Latin American
studies at Syracuse University,
posed a question to the panel. He
asked the audience whether a
problem existed in using litera
ture to study the social sciences or
vice-versa.
"The marketplace is voracious
for paradigms that transcend
everything until you don't know
where to point your finger," Tor
res-Saillant said. "White su
premacy disappears, everything
disappears."
Davila was not as wary of the
problem of intermixing these two
types of studies.
"As ethnic studies, we never
have the purity of translation,"
Davila said. "We are in a very ex
citing space,"
Torres-Saillant's largest con
cern, however, was the common
practice of treating Latin Ameri
can texts solely as cultural relics,
thereby neglecting traditional
critical examination of the work's
literary elements.
"What happens to a work of
art when it is treated strictly as an
anthropological artifact?" Torres-
Saillant said. "We need to admit
that literature is a difficult thing
that is not easily accessible, and
that to study it requires as much
training as an anthropologist
does. We need to try to do them
justice."
This problem was met with
much agreement among panelists
and audience members alike.
While the first roundtable ended
shortly after Torres-Saillant's
piercing question, this interpretive
problem was far from solved.

back wall of the Terrace Room,
Diaz watched and listened as
scholars debated his work.
When the roundtable evolved
into an animated discussion, how
ever, Diaz became an active par
ticipant. Diaz lent his opinion on
topics ranging from the interpre
tation of his own work to political
issues of contemporary scholar
ship. After one panelist, Arlene
Davila from New York Universi
ty, commented on the defensive
ness exhibited by many scholars
when writing about race and eth
nicity, Diaz added his own
thoughts on the issue.
"How many books published
about racism do not have the
term white supremacy in their in
dexes?" Diaz posed to the audi
ence. "The real beast is still off the
page no one wants to touch it."
The conversation was at its
most animated after Silvio Tor
res-Saillant, a professor of Eng
lish and Latino-Latin American
studies at Syracuse University,
posed a question to the panel. He
asked the audience whether a
problem existed in using litera
ture to study the social sciences or
vice-versa.
"The marketplace is voracious
for paradigms that transcend
everything until you don't know
where to point your finger," Tor
res-Saillant said. "White su
premacy disappears, everything
disappears."
Davila was not as wary of the
problem of intermixing these two
types of studies.
"As ethnic studies, we never
have the purity of translation,"
Davila said. "We are in a very ex
citing space,"
Torres-Saillant's largest con
cern, however, was the common
practice of treating Latin Ameri
can texts solely as cultural relics,
thereby neglecting traditional
critical examination of the work's
literary elements.
"What happens to a work of
art when it is treated strictly as an
anthropological artifact?" Torres-
Saillant said. "We need to admit
that literature is a difficult thing
that is not easily accessible, and
that to study it requires as much
training as an anthropologist
does. We need to try to do them
justice."
This problem was met with
much agreement among panelists
and audience members alike.
While the first roundtable ended
shortly after Torres-Saillant's
piercing question, this interpretive
problem was far from solved.

The Junot Diaz: A Symposium
event held Friday, May 18 and
Saturday, May 19 in Margaret
Jacks Hall brought together
scholars from around the country
and the Caribbean to speak about
the significance of the work of
Diaz, Pulitzer Prize-winning au
thor of "The Brief Wondrous Life
of Oscar Wao" and creative writ
ing instructor at MIT.
"These two days are ... a
space of conviviality, inter-cultur
ality, a forum for debate, a place to
boast or simply just revel with
each other," said Jose David Sal
divar, undergraduate program di
rector of the Center for Compar
ative Studies in Race and Ethnic
ity. Saldivar was among the three
principle organizers, along with
Monica Hanna, associate profes
sor of English at the United
States Naval Academy, and Jen
nifer Harford Vargas, associate
professor of English at Bryn
Mawr College.
"We were acutely cognizant of
the fact that we would be organiz
ing the first major international
discussion on this important
writer's body of work," Saldivar
wrote in an email to The Daily.
The two-day symposium con
sisted of four roundtable discus
sions as well as the annual Kieve
Distinguished Speaker Lecture,
delivered by Diaz. The Kieve Lec
ture, an annual event endowed by
Anne and Loren Kieve '69, aims
to bring scholars and public fig
ures from around the world to
Stanford to address contempo
rary issues in race and ethnicity.
"I recommended Junot Diaz
for this honor because his work
has profoundly displayed the is
sues of race and ethnicity as part
of the human imagination," Sal
divar said. "In my previous expe
rience as a fellow keynote confer
ence speaker with Junot Diaz, I
had personal knowledge of his
ability to articulate these issues in
a creatively passionate way."
In his address, Diaz first fo
cused on issues surrounding race
and ethnicity in his own fictional
works "Drown" and "The Brief
Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao."
Stepping away from the podium,
Diaz then moved on to a discus
sion of "The Lord of the Rings,"
where he illustrated how he sees
the novel as primarily centered
on race.
"Junot Diaz remained very ac
cessible in the last part of his talk,
when he answered questions pri
marily from the undergraduates
in the audience about how race
was so central to his reading of
Tolkien's work," Saldivar said.
"He concluded with remarkable
attention and focus on his audi
ence, the undergraduates who
had come to see this amazing con
temporary writer ... By using a
book known to almost all of the
undergraduates in the standing
room only audience, he was able
to engage and discuss difficult is
sues with them, issues that are
present in our society today: race,
power, violence."
The symposium was intended

to be accessible to its audience,
with the four roundtable discus
sions designed to create an open
dialogue between panelists and
audience members, Saldivar said.
After individual presentations by
each panelist, the conversation
was opened up to the entire room.
"Symposium comes from the
Greeks and means a space to
drink," Saldivar explained at the
start of the event.
At the first roundtable, stand
ing behind the last row of chairs
and leaning casually against the
back wall of the Terrace Room,
