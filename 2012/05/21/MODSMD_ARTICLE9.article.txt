## Hennessy visits BOSP in Florence 
### SONYA CHAUDHRY TAYLOR MCADAM 
President John Hennessy visited the Bing Over
seas Studies Program center in Florence Friday, em
phasizing the importance of the abroad experience
for all undergraduates in conversations with profes
sors and students.
"Being abroad is not only about in-depth study,
but also about taking advantage of everything there
is to see around you," he said.
Hennessy spent the morning with long-time Stan
ford in Florence professor Timothy Verdon. They
then visited Palazzo Capponi, the 15th century palace
that will house the Breyer Center for Overseas Stud
ies in Florence starting next fall. Hennessy had lunch
with students and professors, sharing travel advice
and his thoughts on Italy's current political situation.
Florence is the sixth BOSP campus that Hennessy
has visited during his presidency. This March, Hen
nessy took the first part of his sabbatical to attend the
dedication of the Stanford Center at Peking Univer
sity in Beijing.
Although Hennessy does not deal directly with
BOSP operations, he does spend a considerable
amount of time thinking about the abroad experi
ence, As a graduate of Stanford engineering, Hen
nessy shared concerns and hopes for involving more
engineering and pre-med students in the study
abroad programs.
Roughly half of the student body takes advantage
of BOSP programs, through either quarter-long im
mersion or summer seminars, but BOSP and Hen
nessy would like to focus on the participation dispar
ity seen between the various majors and between

athletes and non-athletes. Athletes, engineers and
science majors on the pre-medical track often lose
the opportunity to study abroad because of strict
schedules and requirements, he said.
"It's just as important to study abroad [as it is to
learn the content of your major]," Hennessy said.
"There is definitely enough time, you just have to
plan ahead."
The directors of BOSP have made some changes
that have increased participation from science and
engineering majors in recent years, such as offering a
wider variety of courses at the abroad locations, mak
ing the language requirements more flexible for stu
dents with schedule restrictions and reintroducing
the overseas summer seminars.
In addition to traveling for Stanford related pur
poses, the sabbatical has given Hennessy the oppor
tunity to spend some leisure time in Italy.
"[My wife and I] make an effort to come here
once a year," he said. "Florence is definitely our most
frequented city in Italy."
Hennessy will spend this week in Italy before he
returns to campus for graduation.
"I've been doing lots of reading on the places I
travel to and on higher ed," he said. "I read two large
history books on Egypt and China, and it was nice to
be able to learn about the places before I visited
them. I also read the biography of Steve Jobs. I was
n't sure if I should read a biography of someone I
knew personally, but everyone who read it said it was
a must read. So, I finally did."
