## GREEN STORE: SHOPPING SUSTAINABLY 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Who knew that a desire to find an environ
mentally friendly alternative to the red plas
tic cup a beer pong staple on Stan
ford's campus could spawn an entire store
devoted to selling sustainable products?
The ASSU Green Store was founded to serve this exact
purpose, but since then, has expanded to sell a variety of
sustainable goods, in addition to providing green educa
tion outreach. Through these efforts, this entirely student
run organization hopes to make it easier for Stanford stu
dents to live more environmentally sustainable lifestyles.
In 2008, Susie Choi 'l2 started the Green Store with
three other students, Elaine Albertson 'll M.S.T2, Jeffrey
Sweet'l2 M.S.T2 and Eric KnudsonT2 M.S.T2, through
the ASSU Green Cabinet. According to Choi, one of the
team's first projects was finding a more sustainable alter
native to the übiquitous red plastic Solo cup.
"Our first challenge was finding a replacement for
those red plastic cups that everyone uses on the weekends
and at parties," Choi said. "The problem is that Stanford
Recycling does not have the ability to recycle the plastic
[used to make] Solo cups. If people are going to be using
cups anyway, why don't we introduce more sustainable
cups that students can [recycle]?"
The team introduced recyclable cups in December
2008.
The Green Store is currently run entirely online, and
products sold include compostable plates and utensils,
once-used paper, eco-friendly laundry detergent and
Smart Strips power strips that shut off power to an elec
tronic device when it is not in use to prevent electricity
leakage.
"For all compostable [items], we work with Stanford
Dining and were able to get a wholesale contract so we get
all the products for cheaper," said Allison Fink 'l2, a cur
rent Green Store team member. "We stock up on these
products and sell them for as cheap as possible."
The Green Store makes no sales profits and receives
funding from the student services division of the ASSU.
This money is used to stock up on sustainable products and
subsidize costs for large orders.
"Our prices are pretty competitive with [other] prices
out there, especially because you order online and we de
liver it right to you," Choi said. "Obviously, buying non
sustainable red cups is cheaper, but when we compare with
other sustainable options, our prices are great."
While the Green Store website provides an explanation
of how their environmentally friendly products can be
used most effectively, the team said students sometimes
are not aware of the information. For instance, Choi stated
that very often, students don't realize that the recyclable
cups must be recycled in order to
be considered sustainable.
"Basically, we expect students
to understand why they're buying
[these] products, and on our web
site we explain why our products
are good [for the environment],
but we realized there was a prob
lem, and we weren't sure if people
were actually recycling the recy
clable cups," Choi said.
"We offer recycling bags with
people's purchases that they can
use, and if it's a larger event, [we]
lend them a Green Store banner
to help promote the [online] store,
but we still felt that there was very
little that we could do to educate
students [about these products],"
she added.
In order to combat misunder
standings about the store's func
tion and proper sustainability
practices, Choi founded Green
Events Consulting, an "institution
al service to ensure that a student
service is recycling or compositing
whatever products they pur
chased."
"By [starting Green Events
Consulting], we felt like we were
educating students and that we
could refer them to the Green
Store," she said.
For the most part, many
Green Store purchases are for
large events for which organizers
also coordinate with Green
Events Consulting. Other cus
tomers include Row houses and
cooperatives.
Since the Green Store doesn't
have a physical location, much of

its advertisement is done via email
or by word of mouth. However,
the store has future plans to help
increase the exposure and accessi
bility of eco-friendly products to
students.
"Over the summer, we want to
try to work with the Stanford
Store so that [our] cups could be
sold directly from there," Fink
said. "Once our cups are available
in the Stanford Store, it will be
more conducive for purchasing
this more sustainable product."
In addition to this change, the
Green Store hopes to recruit more
team members to help maintain
and expand their services, includ
ing the establishment of a more
standardized delivery system.
Since the team is small and the de
liveries are done personally, the
group must schedule deliveries
among themselves, which often
makes it difficult to deliver their
products as close to their expected
delivery times as possible.
While the team hopes to in
crease their exposure on campus,
their efforts have (and will contin
ue) to spawn sustainable shopping
habits among Stanford students
that have the potential to carry on
in their lives beyond the Farm.

rent Green Store team member. "We stock up on these
products and sell them for as cheap as possible."
The Green Store makes no sales profits and receives
funding from the student services division of the ASSU.
This money is used to stock up on sustainable products and
subsidize costs for large orders.
"Our prices are pretty competitive with [other] prices
out there, especially because you order online and we de
liver it right to you," Choi said. "Obviously, buying non
sustainable red cups is cheaper, but when we compare with
other sustainable options, our prices are great."
While the Green Store website provides an explanation
of how their environmentally friendly products can be
used most effectively, the team said students sometimes
are not aware of the information. For instance, Choi stated
that very often, students don't realize that the recyclable
cups must be recycled in order to
be considered sustainable.
"Basically, we expect students
to understand why they're buying
[these] products, and on our web
site we explain why our products
are good [for the environment],
but we realized there was a prob
lem, and we weren't sure if people
were actually recycling the recy
clable cups," Choi said.
"We offer recycling bags with
people's purchases that they can
use, and if it's a larger event, [we]
lend them a Green Store banner
to help promote the [online] store,
but we still felt that there was very
little that we could do to educate
students [about these products],"
she added.
In order to combat misunder
standings about the store's func
tion and proper sustainability
practices, Choi founded Green
Events Consulting, an "institution
al service to ensure that a student
service is recycling or compositing
whatever products they pur
chased."
"By [starting Green Events
Consulting], we felt like we were
educating students and that we
could refer them to the Green
Store," she said.
For the most part, many
Green Store purchases are for
large events for which organizers
also coordinate with Green
Events Consulting. Other cus
tomers include Row houses and
cooperatives.
Since the Green Store doesn't
have a physical location, much of

its advertisement is done via email
or by word of mouth. However,
the store has future plans to help
increase the exposure and accessi
bility of eco-friendly products to
students.
"Over the summer, we want to
try to work with the Stanford
Store so that [our] cups could be
sold directly from there," Fink
said. "Once our cups are available
in the Stanford Store, it will be
more conducive for purchasing
this more sustainable product."
In addition to this change, the
Green Store hopes to recruit more
team members to help maintain
and expand their services, includ
ing the establishment of a more
standardized delivery system.
Since the team is small and the de
liveries are done personally, the
group must schedule deliveries
among themselves, which often
makes it difficult to deliver their
products as close to their expected
delivery times as possible.
While the team hopes to in
crease their exposure on campus,
their efforts have (and will contin
ue) to spawn sustainable shopping
habits among Stanford students
that have the potential to carry on
in their lives beyond the Farm.

Who knew that a desire to find an environ
mentally friendly alternative to the red plas
tic cup a beer pong staple on Stan
ford's campus could spawn an entire store
devoted to selling sustainable products?
The ASSU Green Store was founded to serve this exact
purpose, but since then, has expanded to sell a variety of
sustainable goods, in addition to providing green educa
tion outreach. Through these efforts, this entirely student
run organization hopes to make it easier for Stanford stu
dents to live more environmentally sustainable lifestyles.
In 2008, Susie Choi 'l2 started the Green Store with
three other students, Elaine Albertson 'll M.S.T2, Jeffrey
Sweet'l2 M.S.T2 and Eric KnudsonT2 M.S.T2, through
the ASSU Green Cabinet. According to Choi, one of the
team's first projects was finding a more sustainable alter
native to the übiquitous red plastic Solo cup.
"Our first challenge was finding a replacement for
those red plastic cups that everyone uses on the weekends
and at parties," Choi said. "The problem is that Stanford
Recycling does not have the ability to recycle the plastic
[used to make] Solo cups. If people are going to be using
cups anyway, why don't we introduce more sustainable
cups that students can [recycle]?"
The team introduced recyclable cups in December
2008.
The Green Store is currently run entirely online, and
products sold include compostable plates and utensils,
once-used paper, eco-friendly laundry detergent and
Smart Strips power strips that shut off power to an elec
tronic device when it is not in use to prevent electricity
leakage.
"For all compostable [items], we work with Stanford
Dining and were able to get a wholesale contract so we get
all the products for cheaper," said Allison Fink 'l2, a cur
rent Green Store team member. "We stock up on these
products and sell them for as cheap as possible."
