## GREEN STORE: SHOPPING SUSTAINABLY 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Who knew that a desire to find an environ
mentally friendly alternative to the red plas
tic cup a beer pong staple on Stan
ford's campus could spawn an entire store
devoted to selling sustainable products?
The ASSU Green Store was founded to serve this exact
purpose, but since then, has expanded to sell a variety of
sustainable goods, in addition to providing green educa
tion outreach. Through these efforts, this entirely student
run organization hopes to make it easier for Stanford stu
dents to live more environmentally sustainable lifestyles.
In 2008, Susie Choi 'l2 started the Green Store with
three other students, Elaine Albertson 'll M.S.T2, Jeffrey
Sweet'l2 M.S.T2 and Eric KnudsonT2 M.S.T2, through
the ASSU Green Cabinet. According to Choi, one of the
team's first projects was finding a more sustainable alter
native to the Ã¼biquitous red plastic Solo cup.
"Our first challenge was finding a replacement for
those red plastic cups that everyone uses on the weekends
and at parties," Choi said. "The problem is that Stanford
Recycling does not have the ability to recycle the plastic
[used to make] Solo cups. If people are going to be using
cups anyway, why don't we introduce more sustainable
cups that students can [recycle]?"
The team introduced recyclable cups in December
2008.
The Green Store is currently run entirely online, and
products sold include compostable plates and utensils,
once-used paper, eco-friendly laundry detergent and
Smart Strips power strips that shut off power to an elec
tronic device when it is not in use to prevent electricity
leakage.
"For all compostable [items], we work with Stanford
Dining and were able to get a wholesale contract so we get
all the products for cheaper," said Allison Fink 'l2, a cur
rent Green Store team member. "We stock up on these
products and sell them for as cheap as possible."
The Green Store makes no sales profits and receives
funding from the student services division of the ASSU.
This money is used to stock up on sustainable products and
subsidize costs for large orders.
"Our prices are pretty competitive with [other] prices
out there, especially because you order online and we de
liver it right to you," Choi said. "Obviously, buying non
sustainable red cups is cheaper, but when we compare with
other sustainable options, our prices are great."
While the Green Store website provides an explanation
of how their environmentally friendly products can be
used most effectively, the team said students sometimes
are not aware of the information. For instance, Choi stated
that very often, students don't realize that the recyclable
