# FROLICKING IN FOUNTAINS
## 
### NICOLE KOFMAN 
The fountain, previously
masked by construction
work, where the Terman En
gineering Center stood,
combined with 77-degree
weather in recent weeks, has given rise
to an increase in fountain-hopping talk
around campus.
"Have you seen that fountain? It's
like it was made for fountain hopping!"
students exclaim, referring to the pool
length fountain located across the
street from Roble, with tall, sloping
grass hills clearly made with student
sunbathing needs in mind.
My first experience was everything
that fountain hopping is supposed to
be, or at least what I thought it was sup
posed to be based on the endless hours
of "Stanford stalking" I partook in dur
ing the last, lonely three weeks of sum
mer when all my friends had already
begun their college adventures. Like
many of my other freshman peers itch
ing to get to campus, I read every bit of
literature ever published about Stan
ford before arriving in late September,
which both whetted my appetite for
school and increased my fluency in
Stanford abbreviations.
I was in a group of seven in a mini
van on the way back from Hoover
Wilderness after a Stanford Pre-Orien
tation Trip (SPOT), and after six days of
bonding over summer sausage, hiking
and sleep deprivation, we had re
gressed to acting like 7-year-olds, stuff
ing muddy handkerchiefs in our
mouths and sticking sweaty socks in
each others' faces.
Our SPOT leader tried to get us all
to "simmer down" and act our age, but,
in the end, the only thing that could sa
tiate us was a much-needed nap. Luck
ily, the painful, five-hour car ride made
our arrival to Stanford even sweeter
than it would have been otherwise. We
woke up to the staggering site of the
million or so palm trees leading straight
into the heart of campus, hushing us as
our designations as Stanford students
hit us for the first time.
Immediately following our arrival,

we were able to fully initiate ourselves
with an inaugural fountain hop as a
substitute for showering after our
camping trip. Our SPOT leader, veter
an fountain hopper Charlie Johnson
'l2, had the brilliant idea of going foun
tain hopping instead of just sitting in
the hot dust of the Eucalyptus Grove
while waiting in line for the showers.

Fully prepared in river sandals, we
started sprinting for the red fountain in
front of Green Library. After stubbing
our toes on the lights at the bottom of
the fountain, we ran to our next desti
nation, the small fountain in front of
Old Union, where we made a whirlpool
and tried to scramble up onto its top,
the rough surface cutting up our el
bows, and in my case, leaving a scar.
Instead of moving onto the Claw,
which was closed for renovations, we
finished our fountain-hopping course
in the small fountain outside the Bing
Wing of Green Library, piling into it
until it overflowed.
By then we were exhausted from
sprinting, so we sat out on the grass in
the Quad to enjoy each other's compa
ny for what would be one of our last
times as a SPOT group before New
Student Orientation (NSO) began.
I remember distinctly the golden
light filtering through the palm fronds
above us and illuminating the campus
as we dried off and relaxed under the
afternoon sun. As we gazed through
the glowing archway into the barren

expanse of the Quad that last evening,
it was as if we could see the next four
years of our lives stretched before us,
with our first fountain-hopping experi
ence serving as a mark of its beginning.
Taking part in a Stanford tradition
with the small group of friends that I
had grown so close to in just a few days
gave me a glimpse of what the next few
weeks, months and years had in store
for me.
At one point or another, fountain
hopping plays a part in most students'
collections of "I'm the luckiest person
in the world to be at Stanford" mo
ments. This year's freshmen from all
over campus list their first fountain
hopping experience as one that helped
shape their first year on campus.
"It was one of the first things that we
did as a dorm, and it was a very forma
tive bonding experience," said Noam
Rosenthal 'l5. "We had a boom box
blasting, and when we got back to the
dorm, we were all wet and we just had a
dance party in the hallway."
"I felt initiated into the Stanford ex
perience," said Atticus Christensen 'l5,
of his freshman dorm's NSO fountain
hopping excursion.
While fountain hopping plays a key
role in so many Stanford students' ex
periences, there's always the student
who still has not gone fountain hop
ping, perhaps because he or she is not
interested in dealing with chlorine-in
fused hair or running around with wet
clothes, supposedly looking foolish in
front of tourists.
Caitlin Byrnes 'l5 said the reason
she has yet to fountain hop is because
she "didn't have the right sassy bathing
suit" for most of the year. Fortunately
for her â€”and the fountain-hopping
tradition she recently acquired one.
As my freshman year finishes up, I
can look back at my first fountain-hop
ping experience or down at the scar
on my elbow and remember the
quintessential Stanford tradition with
fondness as the first time I felt I be
longed on campus.

tive bonding experience," said Noam
Rosenthal 'l5. "We had a boom box
blasting, and when we got back to the
dorm, we were all wet and we just had a
dance party in the hallway."
"I felt initiated into the Stanford ex
perience," said Atticus Christensen 'l5,
of his freshman dorm's NSO fountain
hopping excursion.
While fountain hopping plays a key
role in so many Stanford students' ex
periences, there's always the student
who still has not gone fountain hop
ping, perhaps because he or she is not
interested in dealing with chlorine-in
fused hair or running around with wet
clothes, supposedly looking foolish in
front of tourists.
Caitlin Byrnes 'l5 said the reason
she has yet to fountain hop is because
she "didn't have the right sassy bathing
suit" for most of the year. Fortunately
for her â€”and the fountain-hopping
tradition she recently acquired one.
As my freshman year finishes up, I
can look back at my first fountain-hop
ping experience or down at the scar
on my elbow and remember the
quintessential Stanford tradition with
fondness as the first time I felt I be
longed on campus.

The fountain, previously
masked by construction
work, where the Terman En
gineering Center stood,
combined with 77-degree
weather in recent weeks, has given rise
to an increase in fountain-hopping talk
around campus.
"Have you seen that fountain? It's
like it was made for fountain hopping!"
students exclaim, referring to the pool
length fountain located across the
street from Roble, with tall, sloping
grass hills clearly made with student
sunbathing needs in mind.
My first experience was everything
that fountain hopping is supposed to
be, or at least what I thought it was sup
posed to be based on the endless hours
of "Stanford stalking" I partook in dur
ing the last, lonely three weeks of sum
mer when all my friends had already
begun their college adventures. Like
many of my other freshman peers itch
ing to get to campus, I read every bit of
literature ever published about Stan
ford before arriving in late September,
which both whetted my appetite for
school and increased my fluency in
Stanford abbreviations.
I was in a group of seven in a mini
van on the way back from Hoover
Wilderness after a Stanford Pre-Orien
tation Trip (SPOT), and after six days of
bonding over summer sausage, hiking
and sleep deprivation, we had re
gressed to acting like 7-year-olds, stuff
ing muddy handkerchiefs in our
mouths and sticking sweaty socks in
each others' faces.
Our SPOT leader tried to get us all
to "simmer down" and act our age, but,
in the end, the only thing that could sa
tiate us was a much-needed nap. Luck
ily, the painful, five-hour car ride made
our arrival to Stanford even sweeter
than it would have been otherwise. We
woke up to the staggering site of the
million or so palm trees leading straight
into the heart of campus, hushing us as
our designations as Stanford students
hit us for the first time.
Immediately following our arrival,

we were able to fully initiate ourselves
with an inaugural fountain hop as a
substitute for showering after our
camping trip. Our SPOT leader, veter
an fountain hopper Charlie Johnson
'l2, had the brilliant idea of going foun
tain hopping instead of just sitting in
the hot dust of the Eucalyptus Grove
while waiting in line for the showers.

Fully prepared in river sandals, we
started sprinting for the red fountain in
front of Green Library. After stubbing
our toes on the lights at the bottom of
the fountain, we ran to our next desti
nation, the small fountain in front of
Old Union, where we made a whirlpool
and tried to scramble up onto its top,
the rough surface cutting up our el
bows, and in my case, leaving a scar.
Instead of moving onto the Claw,
which was closed for renovations, we
finished our fountain-hopping course
in the small fountain outside the Bing
Wing of Green Library, piling into it
until it overflowed.
By then we were exhausted from
sprinting, so we sat out on the grass in
the Quad to enjoy each other's compa
ny for what would be one of our last
times as a SPOT group before New
Student Orientation (NSO) began.
I remember distinctly the golden
light filtering through the palm fronds
above us and illuminating the campus
as we dried off and relaxed under the
afternoon sun. As we gazed through
the glowing archway into the barren

expanse of the Quad that last evening,
it was as if we could see the next four
years of our lives stretched before us,
with our first fountain-hopping experi
ence serving as a mark of its beginning.
Taking part in a Stanford tradition
with the small group of friends that I
had grown so close to in just a few days
gave me a glimpse of what the next few
weeks, months and years had in store
for me.
At one point or another, fountain
hopping plays a part in most students'
collections of "I'm the luckiest person
in the world to be at Stanford" mo
ments. This year's freshmen from all
over campus list their first fountain
hopping experience as one that helped
shape their first year on campus.
