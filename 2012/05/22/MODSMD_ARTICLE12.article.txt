# THE 						FARM ON THE FARM
## Students get their hands dirty at Stanford Community and Educational Farms 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
In the heart of Silicon Valley, less than
two miles from the Stanford National
Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) and
state-of-the-art computer science build
ings, is the Stanford Farm. With irises,
roses and lettuce all spilling into one another,
the farm is totally insulated from the fast
paced, high-stress world that surrounds it (it
doesn't even have Wi-Fi), making it a campus
rarity in more ways than one.
"It's kind of ironic that people call Stan
ford 'The Farm' and this is as much of a farm
as we have," said Amanda Martinez' 14, head
volunteer on the farm, the small, one-acre
plot.
The farm is made up of two distinct parts:
the Community Farm and the Educational
Farm. The Community Farm is made up of
small individual plots managed by professors,
graduate students and other affiliates of the
Stanford community.
The Community Farm was first char
tered in 1996 when Brian Flalweil '97 re
quested a small plot of land near the golf
course and equestrian center to be dedicat
ed to giving students and community mem
bers a place to learn and practice agricul
tural methods. The Educational Farm is a
small strip of land at the edge of the farm
area technically the Earth Systems Pro
gram's plot on the Community Farm. The
plot hosts melons, tomatoes, peas, beans,
leafy greens, cucumbers and squash, as well
as herbs and other plants.

"It's really important for students ... to
have access to something like [the farm]
where they can grow their own goods and
meet other students who are also interested
in food issues and where they can get dirty,"
Martinez said.
Patrick Archie, a professor of earth sys
tems who also holds the title of farm educator,
agreed that it is important for students to en
gage in hands-on learning on the farm.
"The farm is a place where people can get
experiential education that I think is the fun
damental ingredient that ties everything to
gether," Archie said.
Archie currently teaches two classes, one
in the winter called Food Matters, about rep
resentations of food and agriculture in film,
and another called Practices and Principles of
Sustainable Agriculture.
In the latter, according to Archie, students
"learn the basics of everything that you need
to do to take a little patch of earth and grow
food for yourself... they also have the confi
dence to be able to understand at a fundamen
tal level the ecological principles behind sus
tainable agriculture."
There are six classes using the farm's facil
ities this quarter, including a couple of stu
dent-initiated courses. Martinez co-teaches
one of these courses, Grow it, Cook it, Eat It,
with Jenny Rempel 'l2, a Daily columnist.
Martinez cites her own course as an excellent
example of the strong relationship between
the farm and Stanford Dining.
"Stanford Dining is completely in support
of my class and the whole farm program out
here," Martinez said.

Cynthia Liu, administrative program
manager of Stanford Dining, said in an email
to The Daily that the Stanford Farm Project,
a student group that supports farm initiatives,
and the Stanford Educational Farm regularly
work with Matt Rothe, the Stanford Dining
sustainable food program manager, to help
student groups interact more with Stanford
Dining. Rothe also manages a plot of land on
the Community Farm.
"I would say [Stanford Dining] is at the cut
ting edge of food movements among universi
ties around the country," Archie said. "They've
really been thinking about meals that they
serve as an educational opportunity."
Although the farm does not currently
have enough land to supply Stanford Dining
with produce, Archie said they hope to be
able to grow food that will be eaten in dining
halls when they move to a new two-acre plot
of land in about a year.
In addition to connections with student
initiated courses and Stanford Dining, the
farm also has connections to classes in sever
al disciplines. The devices on the farm that
look like they'd be more at home in an engi
neering lab than on an organic farm are the
product of classes such as Design and Con
struction for Sustainability in Extreme Envi
ronments, a class offered by the Civil Engi
neering Department that tests out products
on the farm.
Among the projects being tested on the
Educational Farm are pumps for low-cost
irrigation for farmers in Myanmar, solar
panels that electrify fences for farmers in
India and underground seed storage tech

niques that could protect seeds in the case
of a natural disaster.
Martinez added that in the past there
have been groups making use of the farm
from other engineering departments, the
Graduate School of Business and the Hasso
Plattner Institute of Design (d.school).
"No matter what they're doing, whether
they're in graduate school or if they're un
dergraduates, there's just so many fields that
connect to food and to farming that every
body can find something that interests
them," Archie said, commenting on the ex
pansion of student involvement on the farm
beyond the Earth Systems Program.
Leaders of the farm have noticed an in
creased level of community interest. In the
past, the Community Farm has experienced
problems with careless visitors trampling
their plants, leading certain community
members to be more wary of publicity. The
Educational Farm, on the other hand, wel
comes their increasing visibility.
"There are more and more food related
groups popping up on campus, which is very
promising for the Stanford food movement,"
Martinez said.
She added that the Educational Farm had
a few large groups of at least 50 Prospective
Freshmen (ProFros) come tour the space
over Admit Weekend.
"It was really great to have that much ex
posure with new students at the farm," Mar
tinez said.

tal level the ecological principles behind sus
tainable agriculture."
There are six classes using the farm's facil
ities this quarter, including a couple of stu
dent-initiated courses. Martinez co-teaches
one of these courses, Grow it, Cook it, Eat It,
with Jenny Rempel 'l2, a Daily columnist.
Martinez cites her own course as an excellent
example of the strong relationship between
the farm and Stanford Dining.
"Stanford Dining is completely in support
of my class and the whole farm program out
here," Martinez said.

Cynthia Liu, administrative program
manager of Stanford Dining, said in an email
to The Daily that the Stanford Farm Project,
a student group that supports farm initiatives,
and the Stanford Educational Farm regularly
work with Matt Rothe, the Stanford Dining
sustainable food program manager, to help
student groups interact more with Stanford
Dining. Rothe also manages a plot of land on
the Community Farm.
"I would say [Stanford Dining] is at the cut
ting edge of food movements among universi
ties around the country," Archie said. "They've
really been thinking about meals that they
serve as an educational opportunity."
Although the farm does not currently
have enough land to supply Stanford Dining
with produce, Archie said they hope to be
able to grow food that will be eaten in dining
halls when they move to a new two-acre plot
of land in about a year.
In addition to connections with student
initiated courses and Stanford Dining, the
farm also has connections to classes in sever
al disciplines. The devices on the farm that
look like they'd be more at home in an engi
neering lab than on an organic farm are the
product of classes such as Design and Con
struction for Sustainability in Extreme Envi
ronments, a class offered by the Civil Engi
neering Department that tests out products
on the farm.
Among the projects being tested on the
Educational Farm are pumps for low-cost
irrigation for farmers in Myanmar, solar
panels that electrify fences for farmers in
India and underground seed storage tech

niques that could protect seeds in the case
of a natural disaster.
Martinez added that in the past there
have been groups making use of the farm
from other engineering departments, the
Graduate School of Business and the Hasso
Plattner Institute of Design (d.school).
"No matter what they're doing, whether
they're in graduate school or if they're un
dergraduates, there's just so many fields that
connect to food and to farming that every
body can find something that interests
them," Archie said, commenting on the ex
pansion of student involvement on the farm
beyond the Earth Systems Program.
Leaders of the farm have noticed an in
creased level of community interest. In the
past, the Community Farm has experienced
problems with careless visitors trampling
their plants, leading certain community
members to be more wary of publicity. The
Educational Farm, on the other hand, wel
comes their increasing visibility.
"There are more and more food related
groups popping up on campus, which is very
promising for the Stanford food movement,"
Martinez said.
She added that the Educational Farm had
a few large groups of at least 50 Prospective
Freshmen (ProFros) come tour the space
over Admit Weekend.
"It was really great to have that much ex
posure with new students at the farm," Mar
tinez said.

The Stanford Community and Educational Farms provide a one-acre plot of land on campus where students and community members can learn and practice agricultural methods.
In the heart of Silicon Valley, less than
two miles from the Stanford National
Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) and
state-of-the-art computer science build
ings, is the Stanford Farm. With irises,
roses and lettuce all spilling into one another,
the farm is totally insulated from the fast
paced, high-stress world that surrounds it (it
doesn't even have Wi-Fi), making it a campus
rarity in more ways than one.
"It's kind of ironic that people call Stan
ford 'The Farm' and this is as much of a farm
as we have," said Amanda Martinez' 14, head
volunteer on the farm, the small, one-acre
plot.
The farm is made up of two distinct parts:
the Community Farm and the Educational
Farm. The Community Farm is made up of
small individual plots managed by professors,
graduate students and other affiliates of the
Stanford community.
The Community Farm was first char
tered in 1996 when Brian Flalweil '97 re
quested a small plot of land near the golf
course and equestrian center to be dedicat
ed to giving students and community mem
bers a place to learn and practice agricul
tural methods. The Educational Farm is a
small strip of land at the edge of the farm
area technically the Earth Systems Pro
gram's plot on the Community Farm. The
plot hosts melons, tomatoes, peas, beans,
leafy greens, cucumbers and squash, as well
as herbs and other plants.

"It's really important for students ... to
have access to something like [the farm]
where they can grow their own goods and
meet other students who are also interested
in food issues and where they can get dirty,"
Martinez said.
Patrick Archie, a professor of earth sys
tems who also holds the title of farm educator,
agreed that it is important for students to en
gage in hands-on learning on the farm.
"The farm is a place where people can get
experiential education that I think is the fun
damental ingredient that ties everything to
gether," Archie said.
Archie currently teaches two classes, one
in the winter called Food Matters, about rep
resentations of food and agriculture in film,
and another called Practices and Principles of
Sustainable Agriculture.
In the latter, according to Archie, students
"learn the basics of everything that you need
to do to take a little patch of earth and grow
food for yourself... they also have the confi
dence to be able to understand at a fundamen
tal level the ecological principles behind sus
tainable agriculture."
There are six classes using the farm's facil
ities this quarter, including a couple of stu
dent-initiated courses. Martinez co-teaches
