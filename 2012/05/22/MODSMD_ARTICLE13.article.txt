## FROM FARM TO FORK When health becomes unhealthy 
### Jenny Rempel 
When we speak about gym
visits, kale smoothies,
Dish jogs and the merits
of homemade granola, my friends
and I couch our discussions in
terms of health. When these dis
cussions expand to include eight
minute abs, overeating, weight
concerns and "commitments" to
eat more responsibly (God forbid
we acknowledge they're actually
diets), we still hide behind the
word health.
If I'm just trying to be "healthy,"
what could be wrong? Perhaps the
fact that there are periods when,
internally, I obsess over it. I pub
licly condemn the emphasis on
body image, but somehow I justify
obsessing over it in private. This
type of public-private doublethink
reveals just how unhealthy conver
sations about health can become.
I don't have an eating disorder,
but I do have "body image con
cerns." I know this thanks to the
free Eating Disorders Screening
offered through the Stanford
Healthy Body Image Program.
While my concerns have never
manifested themselves in an eating
disorder, fully 6 percent of the
Stanford population suffers from
anorexia. That's huge. In fact, it's at
least six times greater than the
background rate in the United
States.
This high percentage is typical
on elite college campuses, but its
prevalence doesn't make it accept
able. Though it's harder to meas
ure, Stanford also has a huge num
ber of students with sub-clinical
disordered eating behaviors.
There are some innate behav
iors that predispose high-achiev
ing individuals to obsess over body
image and compete for a perfec
tionist ideal, albeit an unrealistic
one. However, there are also fac
tors specific to Stanford and elite
academic environments that foster
disordered eating. High-stress en
vironments correlate strongly with
eating disorders. In a competitive
environment where driven stu
dents are constantly striving for
improvement, it's easy to add body
image to a list of existing things
we're working on improving
(which might include everything
from this quarter's grades to the
world). At Stanford, we also live in
a rare bubble in which the vast ma
jority of the population is physical
ly fit. This is a symptom as well as a
driver. Fitness is obviously an im
portant part of California culture,
and the labels "active" and "food
ie" describe the ideal Bay Area res
ident.
Stanford students also have a
tendency to compartmentalize and
smile too much. Yes, we smile too
much. Sometimes it's important to
admit that you're struggling. For
food and diet, we shouldn't pub
licly deny the societal importance
of body image but privately obsess
over the size of our thighs or the
chocolate cake at dinner or the
spin classes at Arrillaga.
The tendencies that lead to dis
ordered eating and poor body
image are innate to some Stanford

students before they set foot on
campus, but there's also something
about this environment that exac
erbates these existing tendencies.
It's hard to decry the determina
tion, drive and dedication that en
able academic success as well as
eating disorders, but it is possible
to change the norms and ideals
that transform these positive at
tributes into disordered eating be
haviors.
I live in one of the most accept
ing cooperative communities on
campus and am friends with in
credibly compassionate, encourag
ing individuals who rarely engage
in the type of "fat talk" found else
where in this state and country. But
it can still slip in.
Fat talk denotes the everyday
statements that further a societal
thin ideal. At Stanford, fat talk
does not always fall into the more
easily identified negative genre
(i.e., "Do I look fat in this?" and "I
need to lose ten pounds."). As so
cially conscious students, we know
this discourse is harmful and cloak
our fat talk in more insidious jar
gon. Think: "Those Lululemon
pants look great on you! Have you
been working out?" and "Let's go
to the gym so I can have death by
chocolate for dessert in Ricker
Dining Hall."
So how can we change this cam
pus culture and foster a healthier
body image?
It's important to be open about
these issues. The Stanford Healthy
Body Image Program is attempt
ing to create a space for dialogue
about body image through student
groups and workshops. They also
provide a series of online assess
ments and resources directing in
dividuals and friends to profes
sionals at Vaden, CAPS and else
where on and off campus.
We should all work to eliminate
fat talk. Delta Delta Delta is pro
moting the "fat talk free" pledge,
whereby individuals promise to
"strive not for a thin ideal but for a
healthy ideal." This is a worthwhile
goal, but we should also be careful
to ensure the healthy ideal doesn't
just substitute for the thin ideal.
