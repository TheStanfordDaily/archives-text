# HALF-INVENTED
## Christianity and LGBT: An addendum 
### Chase Ishii 
Last week I wrote a column ti
tled "Let this be the end. Let
all be forgiven." Toward the
end, it briefly touched on the inter
section of Christianity and the
LGBT community. From what I
could tell, it received a good
amount of support and a small but
impassioned amount of criticism.
Judging by the amount of
emails and questions I've received
in the past week, I felt it appropri
ate to write an addendum to last
week's article. Especially at a place
like Stanford, it can be difficult to
vocally express disagreement, es
pecially around the issue of LGBT,
for fear of being labeled a bigot. I
know there are those who dis
agreed with what I wrote, often for
religious reasons, and those are the
people I would like to address.
I first want to apologize to the
community that may have felt of
fended by my broad-strokes lan
guage. The goal of the article was to
make clear the very real pain and
frustration of living in the secrecy

of sexual identity and to encourage
all people, regardless of how they
personally view LGBT issues, to
act and respond out of love and
compassion. And it's true that
there are many people who dis
agree with homosexuality who still
engage with the community in an
unconditionally loving and consid
erate way. But there are also peo
ple who act out of anger and re
sentment to dishonor others and
disguise it as a warped sense of re
ligious or moral love, and those
people were the targets of my crit
icisms.
With that said, I also did not
state whether I think, from a Chris
tian perspective, that homosexual
ity is "right" or "wrong," primarily
because I feel that that is a horrible
way to frame the discussion. "Ho
mosexuality is wrong." What does
that even mean? That heterosexu
ality is right? I can point to a lot of
counter-examples in my life alone
that would dispute that claim.
Maybe the Christian God is less

concerned with etching the line be
tween right and wrong in order to
distribute points, and more con
cerned with rescuing people of all
sexual orientations and identities
through grace and for goodness.
I've been accused of distorting
Christianity, an accusation to
which I would reply, "Ya, you're
probably right." Every Christian is.
I'm not under any false assump
tion that my word is infallible and
that my views may not be incor
rect. To be otherwise would distort
and reject the fundamental prem
ise and principle of Christianity.
I am confident, however, that
Christianity is not defined by the
views one may hold in regards to
the question of homosexuality. Just
because an issue might be influ
enced by religious views doesn't
mean that it is an issue that consti
tutes the religion itself.
The Old Testament is riddled
with examples of people trying to
love and serve God but missing the
point because they focus on the
secondary rather than the primary.
To which I would ask, have we not
done the same? Sure, Jesus speaks
of sexual immorality, but he also
speaks of hypocrisy. Even if it is
your personal belief that Jesus was
including homosexuality as we un
derstand it today when he spoke
against sexual immorality, should
n't the first step be to confront the
sexual immorality in your own life
rather than announcing and con
demning it in the lives of others?
Further, "sexual immorality"
would also include things like
prostitution and human traffick
ing, and I would assume Jesus
would be more outraged with the
global systematic rape and en
slavement of women and children
for economic gain than what the
United States legally constitutes as
marriage. So maybe we are missing
the point.
I'm not trying to dismiss the
tension between Christianity and
LGBT lifestyles. I'm just trying to
put it into perspective. Your opin
ions are your opinions. But the
consequences of your words and
actions are not yours alone. Re
gardless of your personal views,
there exists real pain around the
issue of sexual identity and orien
tation, inflicted by society or by
one's self. All people, and Chris
tians especially, need to address
this pain, not with their heads, but
with their hearts.

ple who act out of anger and re
sentment to dishonor others and
disguise it as a warped sense of re
ligious or moral love, and those
people were the targets of my crit
icisms.
With that said, I also did not
state whether I think, from a Chris
tian perspective, that homosexual
ity is "right" or "wrong," primarily
because I feel that that is a horrible
way to frame the discussion. "Ho
mosexuality is wrong." What does
that even mean? That heterosexu
ality is right? I can point to a lot of
counter-examples in my life alone
that would dispute that claim.
Maybe the Christian God is less

concerned with etching the line be
tween right and wrong in order to
distribute points, and more con
cerned with rescuing people of all
sexual orientations and identities
through grace and for goodness.
I've been accused of distorting
Christianity, an accusation to
which I would reply, "Ya, you're
probably right." Every Christian is.
I'm not under any false assump
tion that my word is infallible and
that my views may not be incor
rect. To be otherwise would distort
and reject the fundamental prem
ise and principle of Christianity.
I am confident, however, that
Christianity is not defined by the
views one may hold in regards to
the question of homosexuality. Just
because an issue might be influ
enced by religious views doesn't
mean that it is an issue that consti
tutes the religion itself.
The Old Testament is riddled
with examples of people trying to
love and serve God but missing the
point because they focus on the
secondary rather than the primary.
To which I would ask, have we not
done the same? Sure, Jesus speaks
of sexual immorality, but he also
speaks of hypocrisy. Even if it is
your personal belief that Jesus was
including homosexuality as we un
derstand it today when he spoke
against sexual immorality, should
n't the first step be to confront the
sexual immorality in your own life
rather than announcing and con
demning it in the lives of others?
Further, "sexual immorality"
would also include things like
prostitution and human traffick
ing, and I would assume Jesus
would be more outraged with the
global systematic rape and en
slavement of women and children
for economic gain than what the
United States legally constitutes as
marriage. So maybe we are missing
the point.
I'm not trying to dismiss the
tension between Christianity and
LGBT lifestyles. I'm just trying to
put it into perspective. Your opin
ions are your opinions. But the
consequences of your words and
actions are not yours alone. Re
gardless of your personal views,
there exists real pain around the
issue of sexual identity and orien
tation, inflicted by society or by
one's self. All people, and Chris
tians especially, need to address
this pain, not with their heads, but
with their hearts.
