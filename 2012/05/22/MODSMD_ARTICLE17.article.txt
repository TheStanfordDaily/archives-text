## EPL is the world's best league 
### Tom Taylor 
My league is better
than your league.
It's a fact. First
things first. It is a
pretty well accept
ed and obvious truth that the best
soccer leagues are in Europe. I
mean this as no great disrespect to
the progress soccer has made in the
United States in recent years, but
the MLS doesn't come close. Even
Brazil and Argentine, giants of the
international game, cannot boast
anything to rival the dominance of
European club soccer. What speaks
volumes is that the best South
American talent plies its trade in
Europe, just like the world's best
basketball players come here to
play in the NBA.
But not all European leagues are
equal, and even within the conti
nent, talent migrates from country
to country. To get some kind of idea
how the leagues rate against each
other, we should turn to Europe's
premiere competition: the UEFA
Champions League.
On an epic night last Saturday in
Munich, Chelsea was crowned
champion for the first time in the
club's history. Even for impartial
soccer fans it was a draining but re
warding experience that was remi
niscent, perhaps, of Liverpool's im
probable win over Milan in Istanbul
seven years ago. Somehow Bayern
Munich squandered every clear
chance that came its way, and when
it finally took the lead as regulation
time began to run out, Chelsea's Di
dier Drogba responded to tie the
game. Drogba then looked like the
villain of the show when he gave
away a penalty in extra time, but still
Bayern couldn't make it count.
And to cap it all, we were treated
to that rarest of all things: a German
team choking on penalties against
an English team. There is nothing
quite like being in a room full of
German soccer fans to make me
side with the English squad not
because I have anything against the
Germans, but because we just have
a lot of soccer history, mostly them
beating us and so, against my bet
ter judgment, I was cheering for
Chelsea. When keeper Petr Cech
saved a shot to bring the London
club level and then Drogba sealed
the game with his strike, I was ecstat
ic.
Since the start of the 2000-01 sea
son, seven countries have been rep
resented in the semifinals of the
Champions League: England,
France, Germany, Holland, Italy,
Portugal and Spain. Though Porto
did win the tournament in 2004, the
obvious weak links include its
home, Portugal, as well as France
and Holland, notching up just four
appearances between them. Italian
teams have won the tournament
three times and made the semifinals
seven times in this period, but Serie
A will no longer be considered one
of Europe's three biggest leagues
next season, being replaced by Ger
many's Bundesliga, and it will now
receive just three tickets into the
Champions League.
Though the Bundesliga's status
has been upgraded, in these last 12
years German teams have only won
the title once and made the semifi
nals on five occasions. In compari
son, Spain's La Liga and England's
Premier League have sent 15 and 17
teams to the semifinals and walked
away with four and three titles, re
spectively.
La Liga would probably be
many people's pick, but I feel that
misses a crucial point. The Spanish
league is dominated by the big two
of Real Madrid and Barcelona. The
three recent times that Barca won it
also simultaneously claimed top
spot in La Liga, and though Real
Madrid only came third when it won
the Champions League in 2002, that
was still sufficient to qualify for the
tournament the following year.
In stark contrast, while Man
chester United claimed the double
of European and domestic honors
in 2008, Liverpool in 2005 and
Chelsea this year finished fifth and
sixth respectively, outside of the
Champions League qualification
spots. Liverpool's case prompted a
change in the rules to allow the de
fending champions automatic qual
ification the following year, and this
rule caused Tottenham Hotspur to
lose its place in favor of Chelsea
next season.
The hallmark of a great league is
that tough competition makes the
best teams better. If one or two
teams begin to dominate, the chal
