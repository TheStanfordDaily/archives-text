# BACK AT NCAAs
## Card qualifies with fourth-place finish 
### AUSTIN BLOCK STAFF WRITER 
Despite finishing a distant fourth in the
NCAA Western Regional, 17 shots behind
tournament winner Cal, the Stanford men's
golf team qualified for next week's NCAA
Championships.
"It was a bit disappointing that we didn't
contend for the title as I thought we would ..
. but we got the job done and we finished
fourth, and the top five get to go to nationals,"
said junior Andrew Yun, who shot a final
round 66 to jump into a tie for 15th individu
ally.
Playing at home, the Cardinal was in con
tention early, shooting an opening-round
team score of three-under-par 277 to trail Cal
by one.
Although the team actually shot a better
score, 275, on the second day of play, Cal and
San Diego State caught fire, shooting a Bl
under 270 and a 15-under 265, respectively, to
pull far into the lead.
That sizable deficit proved too difficult to
make up, and Stanford fell further behind in
the final round as Cal and San Diego State
continued to tear up the Stanford Golf
Course. Cal, ranked No. 6 nationally by
Golfweek, finished with a team score of 25-
under, and San Diego State, ranked No. 14,
finished at 19-under.
Freshman Patrick Rodgers, the nation's
fourth-ranked golfer and a finalist for the
Ben Hogan Award, was the Cardinal's lowest
scorer on the weekend, tying for 10th at four
under.
Yun said that the course played far easier
than normal.
"I don't feel like anybody really played
that poorly, but I think it just kind of caught us
off guard how easy the course was playing,"
Yun said. "Scores were a lot lower than usual.
It was probably some of the best conditions
we've played in all year."
Team captain Wilson Bowen has said that
the team tends to thrive when playing more
difficult courses. The team's performance this
weekend and sixth-place finish in the Pac-12
Championships at the relatively tame Ore
gon State golf course seem to validate this
claim.
However, Stanford should have no further
problems with regards to course difficulty
starting next week. The NCAA Champi
onships will be held at the Riviera Country
Club in Los Angeles, a tough course that has
hosted three major championships and is the
site of the PGA Tour's annual Northern Trust
Open.
Junior Steve Kearney said the Riviera
course should suit the team well.
"It is a very long course, which is great be
cause our team is known for power off of the
tee," he said.
In order to prepare for up to six days of
play at this difficult course, the Cardinal
played a practice round at Riviera a couple of
weeks ago and has been watching film of the

course.
"It was really cool just to get a sneak pre
view of the golf course. Not a lot of other
teams got that opportunity," said freshman
Patrick Grimes, who shot three-over on the
weekend. "You can just kind of get down
there and get a feel for what it's like and then
remember some of the shots out there, and
then that makes your preparation a lot more
specific for the upcoming tournament... it
just adds a layer of comfort that can make our
practice for the tournament a lot more pro
ductive."

Stanford will send five players to nation
als: Rodgers, Yun, Grimes, Kearney and soph
omore Cameron Wilson.
The top five teams in each of six NCAA
Regionals qualified for the tournament.
After three rounds of stroke play, which starts
next Tuesday, the top eight teams in the field
of 30 will be placed in a bracket and pitted
against each other in a single-elimination
match play tournament.

Junior Steve Kearney (above) believes last year's poor finish at regionals helped Stanford's
performance this year, as the Cardinal qualified for NCAAs by placing fourth over the weekend.
from each team will face off
against the golfers of another
team in 18-hole matches. The
school that wins three consecu
tive contests will be declared
NCAA champion on June 3.
Kearney said the Cardinal has
greatly stepped up the intensity of
its preparations with the NCAA
championship right around the
corner.
"Not going to NCAAs last
year was a huge disappointment,
so qualifying this year has moti
vated us to practice really hard
this week," he said. "Each guy is
spending more than four hours a
day on their own time on top of
team practice. This is our chance
to make a statement, and we are
ready to do it."
Grimes and Yun expressed
confidence in the team's chances

next week.
"We've got as much depth as
anyone in the country, and if we
put it together, we showed in our
first tournament of the year that
we're definitely capable of beat
ing the best teams in the country,"
Grimes said. "It's a really long
week, so it's just a matter of who
shows up with their 'A' game and
can put it together for the whole
week."
"That last day [of regionals],
we weren't looking too good for a
little bit. I think for a couple of
holes or so we were outside the
cut line looking in," Yun said. "I
think we a11... played our hearts
out on the last nine holes ... If we
can start off with that same sense
of urgency and that same focus
and motivation, I think we can
start off and finish out the tourna
ment really well."
The NCAA Championship be
gins on May 29 in Los Angeles.
