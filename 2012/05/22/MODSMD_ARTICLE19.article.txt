## Softball ends season with regional loss 
### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
The Stanford Softball team's season ended
on Sunday, as it fell to Louisiana-Lafayette.
The Ragin' Cajuns advanced past the Cardi
nal and into the NCAA Super Regionals.
The Cardinal started off its double-elimi
nation regional on Friday with a 1-0 win over
Baylor thanks to a superb performance from
starter Teagan Gerhart. The junior struck out
seven to notch her ninth shutout of the year.
The win advanced Stanford to take on the
other team to win its first game, Louisiana-
Lafayette. On Saturday, the host Ragin' Ca
juns jumped out to an early lead and cruised
to a 9-3 win to bring Stanford one loss from
elimination in the double-elimination region
al.
The Cardinal did not have long to worry
about this predicament, though, as the team
had to take on Baylor that same evening to
decide who would go home. Once again, Stan
ford proved too much for the Bears, winning
6-2 to stay alive. All eight runs were scored in
i the fifth inning, with the big blow coming off
the bat of freshman centerfielder Cassandra
Roulund, as she crushed a grand slam over
the left-field fence. Gerhart threw her third
complete game in two days to keep the Bay
:j; lor bats quiet once again.
Despite the win, Stanford was still in a
tough spot, needing to beat Louisiana-
Lafayette twice on Sunday in Lafayette to ad
i vance. The Cardinal could not even get the
first win, though, falling 6-2 to end its season,
i Just as they had on Friday, the Ragin' Cajuns
| jumped out to an early lead, scoring five runs
S in the first four innings to put the game out of
reach. Freshman Nyree White came in for her
| first career postseason appearance, allowing
just one run over three innings, but by then
Louisiana-Lafayette had the game well under
control.
Stanford ends its season at 40-19, marking
the 13th time in school history that the team
i reached 40 wins and the 15th straight time the
Y Cardinal made the postseason.
