# New hospital to model future care
## $1 billion campaign for Stanford Hospital to set global example of top patient care 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
With a new, 823,000-square
foot Stanford Hospital, which will
be partially funded by a recently
announced $1 billion fundraising
campaign, Stanford Medicine
aims to connect "science and hu
manity in a caring and dignified
manner," according to School of
Medicine Dean Philip Pizzo.
President John Hennessy an
nounced the Campaign for Stan
ford Medicine two weeks ago as
part of an initiative to build the
new hospital and invest in medical
teachings and research.
Stating that the "the new hos
pital is not just about technology,"
Pizzo said that the specific needs
for the fundraising campaign
range from meeting state building
codes to pioneering patient care.
"The reasons for building the

hospital are multiple," Pizzo said.
"It begins with the need for it to
follow seismic regulations, but
more importantly, it is for the ben
efit of the community."
"Providing the most advanced
health care possible to people
locally, nationally and globally
will be one of the great challenges
of this century," Hennessey said in
his campaign launch speech on
May 7. "The Campaign for Stan
ford Medicine draws upon our
particular strengths the prox
imity of the University to its hos
pitals and clinics to focus on
this issue and better serve the
public. It will allow us to seek so
lutions to some of medicine's
most daunting problems, and it
will begin in our own community
with the new Stanford Hospital."
Pizzo said that the $1 billion
campaign does not reflect the
total cost of the hospital which

could amount to more than $2 or
$3 billion but just the goal of
the present fundraising campaign.
Half the amount the campaign
hopes to acquire has already been
raised through both corporate
and private donations. To date, the
University has received corporate
donations from Apple, Hewlett-
Packard, eßay, Oracle, Intuit,
Nvidia and Intel. In total, these

companies have pledged over
$175 million under the Stanford
Hospital Corporate Partners Pro
gram.
Additionally, three families
the Tashia and John Morgridge
family, the Anne Bass M.A. 'O7
and Robert Bass MBA '74 family,
and the Christopher Redlich '72
family have each contributed
$5O million.

Stanford Medicine intends for
the new hospital to become a pio
neer in the medical field by incor
porating state-of-the-art technol
ogy, such as integrated medical fa
cilities, advanced imaging,
genome sequencing and more ef
fective emergency care.

able nature of the new hospital,
which he said "will have the best
technology, but will also enable
the introduction of new technolo
gy in the years and decades to
come."
He emphasized that while the
new hospital will be a leader in
medical technology, it will also
lead the way in patient care. Fea
tures to improve the quality of life
for patients, such as healing gar
dens and private rooms for visit
ing families, will be incorporated
into the facility, which will begin
construction in 2013 and be com
pleted in 2018.

"We want to be able to deliver
the absolute best care to that next
patient who walks through our
door," said Amir Dan Rubin,
president and CEO of Stanford
Hospital and Clinics, to the San
Jose Mercury News. "We need to
deliver care that leverages inno
vation and technology, but that is
also patient- and family-orient
ed."
Even though the new hospital
will directly benefit the local com
munity, Pizzo said it will also serve
as a model for hospitals world
wide.
"When something has impact
at Stanford, it will travel in the na
tion and the world," he said. "Our
advancements will cross bound
aries."
Medical students, who spend a
significant portion of their time

working at a hospital for the final
two years of their degree, will also
be able to take advantage of the
new hospital's resources.
According to Luz Silverio, a
fourth-year medical student, fu
ture students will appreciate the
work environment in the new
hospital.
"Medical students are essen
tially trapped in the basement for
80 to 90 hours a week," Silverio
said. "It's nice to rest your eyes on
a beautiful painting or look out
side. I think the University has
done a great job overall rejuve
nating the facilities for med stu
dents. I'm really jealous I won't be
around when [the new hospital]
opens."

Pizzo said that the $1 billion
campaign does not reflect the
total cost of the hospital which

could amount to more than $2 or
$3 billion but just the goal of
the present fundraising campaign.
Half the amount the campaign
hopes to acquire has already been
raised through both corporate
and private donations. To date, the
University has received corporate
donations from Apple, Hewlett-
Packard, eßay, Oracle, Intuit,
Nvidia and Intel. In total, these

companies have pledged over
$175 million under the Stanford
Hospital Corporate Partners Pro
gram.
Additionally, three families
the Tashia and John Morgridge
family, the Anne Bass M.A. 'O7
and Robert Bass MBA '74 family,
and the Christopher Redlich '72
family have each contributed
$5O million.

able nature of the new hospital,
which he said "will have the best
technology, but will also enable
the introduction of new technolo
gy in the years and decades to
come."
He emphasized that while the
new hospital will be a leader in
medical technology, it will also
lead the way in patient care. Fea
tures to improve the quality of life
for patients, such as healing gar
dens and private rooms for visit
ing families, will be incorporated
into the facility, which will begin
construction in 2013 and be com
pleted in 2018.

"We want to be able to deliver
the absolute best care to that next
patient who walks through our
door," said Amir Dan Rubin,
president and CEO of Stanford
Hospital and Clinics, to the San
Jose Mercury News. "We need to
deliver care that leverages inno
vation and technology, but that is
also patient- and family-orient
ed."
Even though the new hospital
will directly benefit the local com
munity, Pizzo said it will also serve
as a model for hospitals world
wide.
"When something has impact
at Stanford, it will travel in the na
tion and the world," he said. "Our
advancements will cross bound
aries."
Medical students, who spend a
significant portion of their time

working at a hospital for the final
two years of their degree, will also
be able to take advantage of the
new hospital's resources.
According to Luz Silverio, a
fourth-year medical student, fu
ture students will appreciate the
work environment in the new
hospital.
"Medical students are essen
tially trapped in the basement for
80 to 90 hours a week," Silverio
said. "It's nice to rest your eyes on
a beautiful painting or look out
side. I think the University has
done a great job overall rejuve
nating the facilities for med stu
dents. I'm really jealous I won't be
around when [the new hospital]
opens."

The new Stanford Hospital will offer state-of-the-art imaging equipment. The facilities have been designed to
accommodate future techonological changes, while maintaining a comfortable, humanistic environment.
With a new, 823,000-square
foot Stanford Hospital, which will
be partially funded by a recently
announced $1 billion fundraising
campaign, Stanford Medicine
aims to connect "science and hu
manity in a caring and dignified
manner," according to School of
Medicine Dean Philip Pizzo.
President John Hennessy an
nounced the Campaign for Stan
ford Medicine two weeks ago as
part of an initiative to build the
new hospital and invest in medical
teachings and research.
Stating that the "the new hos
pital is not just about technology,"
Pizzo said that the specific needs
for the fundraising campaign
range from meeting state building
codes to pioneering patient care.
"The reasons for building the

hospital are multiple," Pizzo said.
"It begins with the need for it to
follow seismic regulations, but
more importantly, it is for the ben
efit of the community."
"Providing the most advanced
health care possible to people
locally, nationally and globally
will be one of the great challenges
of this century," Hennessey said in
his campaign launch speech on
May 7. "The Campaign for Stan
ford Medicine draws upon our
particular strengths the prox
imity of the University to its hos
pitals and clinics to focus on
this issue and better serve the
public. It will allow us to seek so
lutions to some of medicine's
most daunting problems, and it
will begin in our own community
with the new Stanford Hospital."
