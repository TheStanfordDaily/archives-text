# New hospital to model future care
## $1 billion campaign for Stanford Hospital to set global example of top patient care 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
With a new, 823,000-square
foot Stanford Hospital, which will
be partially funded by a recently
announced $1 billion fundraising
campaign, Stanford Medicine
aims to connect "science and hu
manity in a caring and dignified
manner," according to School of
Medicine Dean Philip Pizzo.
President John Hennessy an
nounced the Campaign for Stan
ford Medicine two weeks ago as
part of an initiative to build the
new hospital and invest in medical
teachings and research.
Stating that the "the new hos
pital is not just about technology,"
Pizzo said that the specific needs
for the fundraising campaign
range from meeting state building
codes to pioneering patient care.
"The reasons for building the

hospital are multiple," Pizzo said.
"It begins with the need for it to
follow seismic regulations, but
more importantly, it is for the ben
efit of the community."
"Providing the most advanced
health care possible to people
locally, nationally and globally
will be one of the great challenges
of this century," Hennessey said in
his campaign launch speech on
May 7. "The Campaign for Stan
ford Medicine draws upon our
particular strengths the prox
imity of the University to its hos
pitals and clinics to focus on
this issue and better serve the
public. It will allow us to seek so
lutions to some of medicine's
most daunting problems, and it
will begin in our own community
with the new Stanford Hospital."
Pizzo said that the $1 billion
campaign does not reflect the
total cost of the hospital which

could amount to more than $2 or
$3 billion but just the goal of
the present fundraising campaign.
Half the amount the campaign
hopes to acquire has already been
raised through both corporate
and private donations. To date, the
University has received corporate
donations from Apple, Hewlett-
Packard, e√üay, Oracle, Intuit,
Nvidia and Intel. In total, these

companies have pledged over
$175 million under the Stanford
Hospital Corporate Partners Pro
gram.
Additionally, three families
the Tashia and John Morgridge
family, the Anne Bass M.A. 'O7
and Robert Bass MBA '74 family,
and the Christopher Redlich '72
family have each contributed
$5O million.

Stanford Medicine intends for
the new hospital to become a pio
neer in the medical field by incor
porating state-of-the-art technol
ogy, such as integrated medical fa
cilities, advanced imaging,
genome sequencing and more ef
fective emergency care.
