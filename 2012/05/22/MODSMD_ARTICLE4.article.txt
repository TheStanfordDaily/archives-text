## Researchers use DNA as digital data storage 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford researchers have developed a
way to use DNA as rewritable digital data
storage. Keeping data in cells could have
widespread applications in future studies,
according to the team, which was led by
post-doctoral researcher Jerome Bonnet
and Drew Endy, an assistant professor of
bioengineering.
"It's a tool to study processes where
you need to track history of cells," Bonnet
said.
"Most of the questions in biology are

questions about history," said Ton Sub
soontorn, a graduate student who worked
on the research team. "You ask, 'Why does
this cell become a cancer cell?' and 'Why
does this cell stay a normal cell?'"
Just as a computer chip stores data by
flipping an electrical bit or magnetic field
on or off, the DNA system flips the orien
tation of a section of DNA to indicate an
on-or-off bit.
The team's research involved establish
ing precise control over two enzymes
integrase and excisionase that work in
opposition to manipulate proteins within
bacterial cells. The team built on previous

research that showed how to irreversibly
flip a stretch of DNA about 500 base pairs
in length.
"We needed to reliably flip the se
quence back and forth, over and over, in
order to create a fully reusable binary data
register," Bonnet said. "So we needed
something different."
The team had lots of early success flip
ping the sequence in either direction inde
pendently, but struggled to make both sys
tems work within the same cell to create
re-writable data. Endy said that the chal-
