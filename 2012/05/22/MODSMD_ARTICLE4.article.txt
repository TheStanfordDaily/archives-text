## Researchers use DNA as digital data storage 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford researchers have developed a
way to use DNA as rewritable digital data
storage. Keeping data in cells could have
widespread applications in future studies,
according to the team, which was led by
post-doctoral researcher Jerome Bonnet
and Drew Endy, an assistant professor of
bioengineering.
"It's a tool to study processes where
you need to track history of cells," Bonnet
said.
"Most of the questions in biology are

questions about history," said Ton Sub
soontorn, a graduate student who worked
on the research team. "You ask, 'Why does
this cell become a cancer cell?' and 'Why
does this cell stay a normal cell?'"
Just as a computer chip stores data by
flipping an electrical bit or magnetic field
on or off, the DNA system flips the orien
tation of a section of DNA to indicate an
on-or-off bit.
The team's research involved establish
ing precise control over two enzymes
integrase and excisionase that work in
opposition to manipulate proteins within
bacterial cells. The team built on previous

research that showed how to irreversibly
flip a stretch of DNA about 500 base pairs
in length.
"We needed to reliably flip the se
quence back and forth, over and over, in
order to create a fully reusable binary data
register," Bonnet said. "So we needed
something different."
The team had lots of early success flip
ping the sequence in either direction inde
pendently, but struggled to make both sys
tems work within the same cell to create
re-writable data. Endy said that the chal-
lenge took 750 trials over three
years before the team succeeded.
"We now have enzymes which
can bind to the sequence, cut it,
flip it and paste it in the new ori
entation," Bonnet said.
The enzyme system that Bon
net's team produced was adapted
from the behavior of a virus, ac
cording to Subsoontorn. Certain
viruses attack bacteria by splicing
their own DNA into the genome
of the bacteria. The research
team's work used enzymes from
those viruses for its manipula
tions.
According to Subsoontorn,
the DNA region being flipped is a
promoter, meaning it signals for
the expression of another genetic
region. In one example, Subsoon
torn said the team placed a gene
that makes the bacteria glow pink
and another that make the bacte
ria glow blue on either side of the
promoter. Flipping the promoter
then allowed the team to change
the bacteria's color.
Long-term applications for the
idea are far more practical than
just color change, the team said.

For example, if the system is ex
panded to have more bits, a cell
could record data about its own
life cycle, which would be crucial
for research on aging and cancer
ous cells.
"[A cell] can detect arsenic,
heavy metals and stuff like that,"
Bonnet said. "So you can make
basically sensors with memory."
Subsoontorn likened cells to
computing systems. Fie said that
inputs such as light, sugars and
other factors determine a cell's
behavior in predictable ways.
"You can think of a cell as an
information processing unit,"
Subsoontorn said. "You take
some input, and it does some kind
of logical computation, and it spits
out some output."
He said that keeping data
could help bioengineers in partic
ular because they could use the
data to learn the behaviors of cells
in a system.
The DNA system also repre
sents an advance because silicon
computer chips are not yet small
enough to fit within cells to take
data. However, Bonnet said the
DNA system still has advantages
in the long term.
"This idea is not trying to com
pete with silicon memory," Sub
soontorn said. "This is data stor
age that can operate inside a liv

ing cell."
He said that some cells grow
and divide so rapidly that silicon
chips would not function, anyway.
DNA, however, can grow and
multiply along with its cell.
The team said it next hopes to
expand the capability of the data
storage to a multi-bit system, pro
gressing toward a scale where it
can store practical amounts of
data for real use.
