### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Michael Tubbs 'l2, currently running to
serve as a council member in his hometown
of Stockton, Calif., after graduation, received
a significant boost to his campaign when he
became the third political candidate ever to
receive a donation from renowned talk show
host Oprah Winfrey.

Twenty-one-year
old Tubbs, a Democ
rat, is campaigning
to oust 52-year-old
Republican incum
bent Dale Fritchen
for the District 6
city council seat. In
cluding the dona
tion from Winfrey,
Tubbs has raised
over $30,000 from
over 225 donors,
who have ranged
from five-dollar do
nations to Winfrey's
$lO,OOO donation,
according to Tubbs.
Fritchen's most
recent campaign fi
nancial disclosure
states he has raised

$36,372, according to Stockton's The Record.
"It's very encouraging to have someone
like Oprah understand the need to re-invent
Stockton, to go back and to bring Stanford
resources and knowledge back home and re
ally affect change," Tubbs said. "I have a re
sponsibility to use the resources and oppor
tunities I've been given at Stanford back
home in a place that really needs it."
The other two campaigns to receive finan
cial support from Winfrey were both success
ful: Cory Booker's 2006 campaign for mayor
of Newark, N.J., and Barack Obama's 2008
campaign for U.S. President.
Tubbs said he is running for the seat be
cause Stockton is currently facing major
problems he wants to help address. Accord
ing to Tubbs, the city broke its record for
homicides last year and is on pace to break
that record again this year.
Forbes magazine ranked Stockton sev
enth on its 2011 list of the most dangerous
cities in the United States, and the city has
been consistently near the top of those rank
ings for the last decade. The city has high
rates of violent crime and low rates of educa
tion, in additional to significant financial
woes and widespread foreclosures.
"All of these are issues, but I think they're

awesome opportunities to roll up
my sleeves to get to work to bring
great change," Tubbs said.
Tubbs met Winfrey at a lunch
eon when she visited campus last
month. Tubbs said Winfrey took
immediate interest when some
one at the luncheon mentioned
his candidacy.
"She was really excited,"
Tubbs said. "She kept coming
back to Stockton asking, 'Do you
think you could win?"'
"Finally she asked,' Where can
1 send my check?'" he added.
Tubbs attributed Winfrey's in
terest in his campaign to his pas

sion for addressing the challenges
facing the city.
"I think she's more inspired by
the fact that there wasn't a lack of
hope.'Tubbs said. "For all the stuff
that's happening [in Stockton], we
can change it; we have to change it;
we will change it. 1 think that's very
in line with her and her own per
sonal story ... and I think that's
really captivated her."
Tubbs and Fritchen will face
off in Stockton's June 5 primary.
Regardless of the outcome of that
vote, the two will both advance to
the general election on Novem
ber 6.
Tubbs will be the first chal
lenger to Fritchen's seat since he
took office in 2008.
