### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Michael Tubbs 'l2, currently running to
serve as a council member in his hometown
of Stockton, Calif., after graduation, received
a significant boost to his campaign when he
became the third political candidate ever to
receive a donation from renowned talk show
host Oprah Winfrey.

Twenty-one-year
old Tubbs, a Democ
rat, is campaigning
to oust 52-year-old
Republican incum
bent Dale Fritchen
for the District 6
city council seat. In
cluding the dona
tion from Winfrey,
Tubbs has raised
over $30,000 from
over 225 donors,
who have ranged
from five-dollar do
nations to Winfrey's
$lO,OOO donation,
according to Tubbs.
Fritchen's most
recent campaign fi
nancial disclosure
states he has raised

$36,372, according to Stockton's The Record.
"It's very encouraging to have someone
like Oprah understand the need to re-invent
Stockton, to go back and to bring Stanford
resources and knowledge back home and re
ally affect change," Tubbs said. "I have a re
sponsibility to use the resources and oppor
tunities I've been given at Stanford back
home in a place that really needs it."
The other two campaigns to receive finan
cial support from Winfrey were both success
ful: Cory Booker's 2006 campaign for mayor
of Newark, N.J., and Barack Obama's 2008
campaign for U.S. President.
Tubbs said he is running for the seat be
cause Stockton is currently facing major
problems he wants to help address. Accord
ing to Tubbs, the city broke its record for
homicides last year and is on pace to break
that record again this year.
Forbes magazine ranked Stockton sev
enth on its 2011 list of the most dangerous
cities in the United States, and the city has
been consistently near the top of those rank
ings for the last decade. The city has high
rates of violent crime and low rates of educa
tion, in additional to significant financial
woes and widespread foreclosures.
"All of these are issues, but I think they're
