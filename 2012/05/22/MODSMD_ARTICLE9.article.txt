# Researchers demo first invisible photodetector
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marwa Farag 
A team of Stanford and Uni
versity of Pennsylvania engineers
carried out the first experimental
demonstration of a plasmonic
cloaking sensor, a device that ma
nipulates scattered light to render
itself invisible across much of the
visible light spectrum.
The device, a photodetector, is
made up of semiconductors covered
by a thin layer of metal. The experi
ment used silicon nanowires coated
in gold, but researchers state that
aluminum and copper could be sub
stituted for gold to the same effect.
Adjusting the ratio of silicon to
metal creates the cloaking effect.
When light interacts with the metal
lic nanostructure, tiny electrical cur
rents produce scattered light waves
that separate charges in both mate
rials. Carefully engineering the
metal coat to create an equal but op
posite electric charge to the silicon's
charge allows the charges to cancel
each other out, creating invisibility.
The charges must align perfectly
for cloaking to occur, which requires
meticulous balancing of the amount
of materials in the device. The cloak
ing effect, however, works regard
less of shape and placement of the
semiconductor and metal, as well as
regardless of the angle of light.
"These structures can find appli
cation in broadband, chip-scale nan
odevices that naturally interface
with the outside world and as build
ing blocks for transmissive metama
terials," the paper reads. For exam
ple, the device can be used in digital
cameras for sharper images.
The researchers described the
device as part of a "new class" of
chip-scale devices that combine the
geometrical properties of a device
with its materials selection to
achieve both electric and optical
functions.
The experiment's results were
published on May 20 in the journal
Nature Photonics. Materials sci
ence and engineering doctoral
candidate Pengyu Fan served as
lead author, and Mark Brongers

School of Engineering was the
