## BANDING TOGETHER Student musicians find space to jam despite lacking music scene 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
liL

It's 11:48 p.m. on a Saturday
night. I'm standing in the
backyard of 680 Lomita,
wearing a tank top and shorts,
regretting my decision to fol
low the mythical Exotic Erotic dress
code. I sway to the live band's music,
trying to ignore the goose bumps on
my arms. The live band finishes up
one of their original songs, "Waldo,"

and transitions into a song we all
know and love: "Shout" by the Isley
Brothers.
I jump around with the rest of
the crowd, waving my arms in the air
and forgetting I was ever cold as the
saxophone player wails away on his
instrument and one of the lead
singers tells us we make him want to
"Shout!"
Stanford isn't exactly known for
its music scene, but the campus hosts
a myriad of talented musicians, all

vying for a chance to play their
music for people who appreciate it.
The music scene isn't always visible
when you first look at our campus,
but with some digging, trips to house
parties and Facebook stalking, it
starts to reveal itself.
"When I first started at Stanford,
I was primarily making music by
myself," said Ryan Edwards 'l3.
"This year I got involved with IDA
[the Institute for Diversity in the
Arts] and found other people to
work with."
A junior sporting an afro and a
longboard, Edwards has been in
volved in music his entire life, play
ing the harmonica in elementary
school and taking the stage for the
first time during a talent show in the
fourth grade. He began dropping
beats and rapping when he came to
Stanford, mixing hip-hop with other
genres such as jazz and electronica.
Edwards formed a collective
with people he met through IDA,
and they began performing at dif
ferent functions on campus, such as
Wine and Cheese at Kairos and rush
events. For Edwards, getting in
volved in the music scene was tough
because it was not very visible to
him as a freshman.
"Finding people to work with
was difficult during my freshman
year because a lot of people would
be like, 'Oh, I'll rap on a track with
you because it sounds like fun and it
sounds cool,' but actually taking ac
tion and writing a verse and getting
onstage and performing it in front of
people, they don't follow through,"
he said. "It's just a matter of finding
the right people who are taking it se
riously."
Edwards added that working
with people is both more fun and
important for learning collabora
tion.
Others slid more seamlessly into
the music scene at Stanford.
"I took Music 171 [Chamber
Music] last year and they offer jazz
combos," Jared Naimark 'l4 said. "I
wanted to do something easy to
start, so I auditioned and was placed
in a group."
The group fell apart at the end of
last year but Naimark and two other
members continued to play into this
year and incorporated three new
members.
"It's more of a band this year,"
Naimark said.
He started learning music at a
young age and has been playing the
saxophone since the fourth grade.
He got involved in the music scene
at Stanford by jamming with people
in his freshman dorm, Larkin.
"It can be tough getting every
one in the same room and hard to
find committed people," Naimark
said. "There's also been some argu
ments about the vibe of the group."
Harry Doshay 'l4, another
member of the group, began playing
the bass when his dad left one in his
room when he was younger.
"He stuck the bass in the corner
of my room, and after a while it
started talking to me and so I started
playing it," Doshay said.
"It can be difficult to get people
to play on a regular basis at Stan
ford," he continued. "I just try to
play as much music as possible, at
every opportunity."

Their combo, named Too Big to
Mail its third name so far has
played at on-campus events such as
Monday Night Jazz at the CoHo,
Wine and Cheese at Kairos and Art
After Dark. However,Naimark and
Doshay are not interested in publi
cizing themselves too much.
"I'd like to continue playing jazz
and sax because it's how I express
myself, but we don't necessarily
want to put our name out,"Naimark
said. "It's just a fun thing to do, play
ing with friends."

"We're not really playing for
money or publicity," Doshay added.
"I just want to keep playing with
these guys and having fun. I'll prob
ably end up just like my dad and end
up playing with a bunch of buddies,
thinking I can rock, playing at my
own birthday party."
Stephen Henderson 'll M.A. 'l2
has also been playing music most of
his life.
"I grew up on the east side of
Maui that really harbored music,"
he said. "I started playing the guitar
and ukulele when I was 10."
When Henderson came to Stan
ford in 2005 as a freshman, he start
ed a reggae band called Paradise
Groove. He more recently started a
music collective called the Dot Dot
Dots. Henderson has been a
professional musician since the age
of 15 and has been producing pro
fessionally since he was 21.
"Finding people to play with has
to be something that happens or
ganically," Henderson said. "You
have to share the same principles, be
experienced enough and finish each
other's melodies... My own music
is very sacred to me so I want to
make sure it's of quality."
When Henderson first came to
Stanford, he didn't find a class or a
track to develop his music. He
learned about the music industry by
himself through independent re
search, as he felt there was no strong
sense of artistic community.
"People go to see other people
perform because they know some
one in the band, not because the
music is good," Henderson said. "It's
not necessarily indicative of a
healthy community. You want your
art to speak for itself."
In 2010, Henderson co-founded
the Red Couch Project, which
showcases independent artists in an
accessible setting, giving up-and
coming musicians resources to de
velop their careers. In July, he plans
on starting an independent produc
tion company with his older sister
and has plans to build a studio.
"It will be asafe,beautiful,sacred
place for artists to play," he said.

With six albums' worth of mate
rial already, Henderson just wants to
keep making music.
"Hawaii's music scene suffers a
bit, so I'd like to help out there as
well," he added.
Henderson's influence is well
known within the music scene on
campus.
"[At the Knoll] he's created an
open group of musicians who can
come through and play," said Ben
Broer 'l2, drummer of a Stanford
grown band called Den of Thieves.
"I think what he's doing is fantastic,
and I really admire him."
Den of Thieves features Broer
on the drums, John Hollywood 'l2
on the guitar, Alex Klein 'l2 on the
saxophone, Jason Loftus 'l2 on the
bass and Michael Davies 'l2 on the
keyboard. All five of its members
have been in the group since its
start. Their involvement in music
grew from an interest in the craft
and admiration of those older than
them who were playing instru
ments.
The band members dallied in
music their freshman year and came
together during spring quarter of
their sophomore year. Klein de
scribed them as a Grateful Dead
cover during their initial time to
gether, though Hollywood and
Broer disagreed.
"We started out as a classic rock
cover band, but we've developed
our own style," Broer said.
All three agreed that it is tough
to get involved in the music scene at
Stanford.
"There's no place for musicians
to congregate," Klein said, adding
that the Knoll could work as that
place, if it focused less on computer
music. He also expressed an interest
in Frost Amphitheater being
opened to student bands.
"There isn't a huge incentive for
bands to play around [campus] ei
ther," Broer added.
However, Klein offered hope for
the integration of music into cam
pus life.
"The music scene is changing for
the better," he said. "There are a lot
of really talented musicians, but few
bands."
Den of Thieves has played at a
lot of events on campus, mostly
weekly and biweekly "staples," like
Happy Hour at Enchanted Broccoli
Forest, Wine and Cheese at Kairos
and parties at Narnia.
"We're just starting to move off
campus," Broer said, citing a show in
San Francisco this week in which the
group will play original music.
With graduation approaching,
the members all have plans that will
take them away from Stanford and
away from the band, from going on
to work in sound production to at
tending medical school. Though
they may not continue performing,
they stressed the value of their band
experience.
"It's really important to take the
time to do your art," Henderson
said. "If you could be playing music
and you would be playing music,
then you should be playing music. It
has to be just important to you as
your academics."

important for learning collabora
tion.
Others slid more seamlessly into
the music scene at Stanford.
"I took Music 171 [Chamber
Music] last year and they offer jazz
combos," Jared Naimark 'l4 said. "I
wanted to do something easy to
start, so I auditioned and was placed
in a group."
The group fell apart at the end of
last year but Naimark and two other
members continued to play into this
year and incorporated three new
members.
"It's more of a band this year,"
Naimark said.
He started learning music at a
young age and has been playing the
saxophone since the fourth grade.
He got involved in the music scene
at Stanford by jamming with people
in his freshman dorm, Larkin.
"It can be tough getting every
one in the same room and hard to
find committed people," Naimark
said. "There's also been some argu
ments about the vibe of the group."
Harry Doshay 'l4, another
member of the group, began playing
the bass when his dad left one in his
room when he was younger.
"He stuck the bass in the corner
of my room, and after a while it
started talking to me and so I started
playing it," Doshay said.
"It can be difficult to get people
to play on a regular basis at Stan
ford," he continued. "I just try to
play as much music as possible, at
every opportunity."

Their combo, named Too Big to
Mail its third name so far has
played at on-campus events such as
Monday Night Jazz at the CoHo,
Wine and Cheese at Kairos and Art
After Dark. However,Naimark and
Doshay are not interested in publi
cizing themselves too much.
"I'd like to continue playing jazz
and sax because it's how I express
myself, but we don't necessarily
want to put our name out,"Naimark
said. "It's just a fun thing to do, play
ing with friends."

"We're not really playing for
money or publicity," Doshay added.
"I just want to keep playing with
these guys and having fun. I'll prob
ably end up just like my dad and end
up playing with a bunch of buddies,
thinking I can rock, playing at my
own birthday party."
Stephen Henderson 'll M.A. 'l2
has also been playing music most of
his life.
"I grew up on the east side of
Maui that really harbored music,"
he said. "I started playing the guitar
and ukulele when I was 10."
When Henderson came to Stan
ford in 2005 as a freshman, he start
ed a reggae band called Paradise
Groove. He more recently started a
music collective called the Dot Dot
Dots. Henderson has been a
professional musician since the age
of 15 and has been producing pro
fessionally since he was 21.
"Finding people to play with has
to be something that happens or
ganically," Henderson said. "You
have to share the same principles, be
experienced enough and finish each
other's melodies... My own music
is very sacred to me so I want to
make sure it's of quality."
When Henderson first came to
Stanford, he didn't find a class or a
track to develop his music. He
learned about the music industry by
himself through independent re
search, as he felt there was no strong
sense of artistic community.
"People go to see other people
perform because they know some
one in the band, not because the
music is good," Henderson said. "It's
not necessarily indicative of a
healthy community. You want your
art to speak for itself."
In 2010, Henderson co-founded
the Red Couch Project, which
showcases independent artists in an
accessible setting, giving up-and
coming musicians resources to de
velop their careers. In July, he plans
on starting an independent produc
tion company with his older sister
and has plans to build a studio.
"It will be asafe,beautiful,sacred
place for artists to play," he said.

With six albums' worth of mate
rial already, Henderson just wants to
keep making music.
"Hawaii's music scene suffers a
bit, so I'd like to help out there as
well," he added.
Henderson's influence is well
known within the music scene on
campus.
"[At the Knoll] he's created an
open group of musicians who can
come through and play," said Ben
Broer 'l2, drummer of a Stanford
grown band called Den of Thieves.
"I think what he's doing is fantastic,
and I really admire him."
Den of Thieves features Broer
on the drums, John Hollywood 'l2
on the guitar, Alex Klein 'l2 on the
saxophone, Jason Loftus 'l2 on the
bass and Michael Davies 'l2 on the
keyboard. All five of its members
have been in the group since its
start. Their involvement in music
grew from an interest in the craft
and admiration of those older than
them who were playing instru
ments.
The band members dallied in
music their freshman year and came
together during spring quarter of
their sophomore year. Klein de
scribed them as a Grateful Dead
cover during their initial time to
gether, though Hollywood and
Broer disagreed.
"We started out as a classic rock
cover band, but we've developed
our own style," Broer said.
All three agreed that it is tough
to get involved in the music scene at
Stanford.
"There's no place for musicians
to congregate," Klein said, adding
that the Knoll could work as that
place, if it focused less on computer
music. He also expressed an interest
in Frost Amphitheater being
opened to student bands.
"There isn't a huge incentive for
bands to play around [campus] ei
ther," Broer added.
However, Klein offered hope for
the integration of music into cam
pus life.
"The music scene is changing for
the better," he said. "There are a lot
of really talented musicians, but few
bands."
Den of Thieves has played at a
lot of events on campus, mostly
weekly and biweekly "staples," like
Happy Hour at Enchanted Broccoli
Forest, Wine and Cheese at Kairos
and parties at Narnia.
"We're just starting to move off
campus," Broer said, citing a show in
San Francisco this week in which the
group will play original music.
With graduation approaching,
the members all have plans that will
take them away from Stanford and
away from the band, from going on
to work in sound production to at
tending medical school. Though
they may not continue performing,
they stressed the value of their band
experience.
"It's really important to take the
time to do your art," Henderson
said. "If you could be playing music
and you would be playing music,
then you should be playing music. It
has to be just important to you as
your academics."

It's 11:48 p.m. on a Saturday
night. I'm standing in the
backyard of 680 Lomita,
wearing a tank top and shorts,
regretting my decision to fol
low the mythical Exotic Erotic dress
code. I sway to the live band's music,
trying to ignore the goose bumps on
my arms. The live band finishes up
one of their original songs, "Waldo,"

and transitions into a song we all
know and love: "Shout" by the Isley
Brothers.
I jump around with the rest of
the crowd, waving my arms in the air
and forgetting I was ever cold as the
saxophone player wails away on his
instrument and one of the lead
singers tells us we make him want to
"Shout!"
Stanford isn't exactly known for
its music scene, but the campus hosts
a myriad of talented musicians, all

vying for a chance to play their
music for people who appreciate it.
The music scene isn't always visible
when you first look at our campus,
but with some digging, trips to house
parties and Facebook stalking, it
starts to reveal itself.
"When I first started at Stanford,
I was primarily making music by
myself," said Ryan Edwards 'l3.
"This year I got involved with IDA
[the Institute for Diversity in the
Arts] and found other people to
work with."
A junior sporting an afro and a
longboard, Edwards has been in
volved in music his entire life, play
ing the harmonica in elementary
school and taking the stage for the
first time during a talent show in the
fourth grade. He began dropping
beats and rapping when he came to
Stanford, mixing hip-hop with other
genres such as jazz and electronica.
Edwards formed a collective
with people he met through IDA,
and they began performing at dif
ferent functions on campus, such as
Wine and Cheese at Kairos and rush
events. For Edwards, getting in
volved in the music scene was tough
because it was not very visible to
him as a freshman.
"Finding people to work with
was difficult during my freshman
year because a lot of people would
be like, 'Oh, I'll rap on a track with
you because it sounds like fun and it
sounds cool,' but actually taking ac
tion and writing a verse and getting
onstage and performing it in front of
people, they don't follow through,"
he said. "It's just a matter of finding
the right people who are taking it se
riously."
Edwards added that working
with people is both more fun and
important for learning collabora
tion.

ford in 2005 as a freshman, he start
ed a reggae band called Paradise
Groove. He more recently started a
music collective called the Dot Dot
Dots. Henderson has been a
professional musician since the age
of 15 and has been producing pro
fessionally since he was 21.
"Finding people to play with has
to be something that happens or
ganically," Henderson said. "You
have to share the same principles, be
experienced enough and finish each
other's melodies... My own music
is very sacred to me so I want to
make sure it's of quality."
When Henderson first came to
Stanford, he didn't find a class or a
track to develop his music. He
learned about the music industry by
himself through independent re
search, as he felt there was no strong
sense of artistic community.
"People go to see other people
perform because they know some
one in the band, not because the
music is good," Henderson said. "It's
not necessarily indicative of a
healthy community. You want your
art to speak for itself."
In 2010, Henderson co-founded
the Red Couch Project, which
showcases independent artists in an
accessible setting, giving up-and
coming musicians resources to de
velop their careers. In July, he plans
on starting an independent produc
tion company with his older sister
and has plans to build a studio.
"It will be asafe,beautiful,sacred
place for artists to play," he said.

With six albums' worth of mate
rial already, Henderson just wants to
keep making music.
"Hawaii's music scene suffers a
bit, so I'd like to help out there as
well," he added.
Henderson's influence is well
known within the music scene on
campus.
"[At the Knoll] he's created an
open group of musicians who can
come through and play," said Ben
Broer 'l2, drummer of a Stanford
grown band called Den of Thieves.
"I think what he's doing is fantastic,
and I really admire him."
Den of Thieves features Broer
on the drums, John Hollywood 'l2
on the guitar, Alex Klein 'l2 on the
saxophone, Jason Loftus 'l2 on the
bass and Michael Davies 'l2 on the
keyboard. All five of its members
have been in the group since its
start. Their involvement in music
grew from an interest in the craft
and admiration of those older than
them who were playing instru
ments.
The band members dallied in
music their freshman year and came
together during spring quarter of
their sophomore year. Klein de
scribed them as a Grateful Dead
cover during their initial time to
gether, though Hollywood and
Broer disagreed.
"We started out as a classic rock
cover band, but we've developed
our own style," Broer said.
All three agreed that it is tough
to get involved in the music scene at
Stanford.
"There's no place for musicians
to congregate," Klein said, adding
that the Knoll could work as that
place, if it focused less on computer
music. He also expressed an interest
in Frost Amphitheater being
opened to student bands.
"There isn't a huge incentive for
bands to play around [campus] ei
ther," Broer added.
However, Klein offered hope for
the integration of music into cam
pus life.
"The music scene is changing for
the better," he said. "There are a lot
of really talented musicians, but few
bands."
Den of Thieves has played at a
lot of events on campus, mostly
weekly and biweekly "staples," like
Happy Hour at Enchanted Broccoli
Forest, Wine and Cheese at Kairos
and parties at Narnia.
"We're just starting to move off
campus," Broer said, citing a show in
San Francisco this week in which the
group will play original music.
With graduation approaching,
the members all have plans that will
take them away from Stanford and
away from the band, from going on
to work in sound production to at
tending medical school. Though
they may not continue performing,
they stressed the value of their band
experience.
"It's really important to take the
time to do your art," Henderson
said. "If you could be playing music
and you would be playing music,
then you should be playing music. It
has to be just important to you as
your academics."

It's 11:48 p.m. on a Saturday
night. I'm standing in the
backyard of 680 Lomita,
wearing a tank top and shorts,
regretting my decision to fol
low the mythical Exotic Erotic dress
code. I sway to the live band's music,
trying to ignore the goose bumps on
my arms. The live band finishes up
one of their original songs, "Waldo,"

and transitions into a song we all
know and love: "Shout" by the Isley
Brothers.
I jump around with the rest of
the crowd, waving my arms in the air
and forgetting I was ever cold as the
saxophone player wails away on his
instrument and one of the lead
singers tells us we make him want to
"Shout!"
Stanford isn't exactly known for
its music scene, but the campus hosts
a myriad of talented musicians, all

vying for a chance to play their
music for people who appreciate it.
The music scene isn't always visible
when you first look at our campus,
but with some digging, trips to house
parties and Facebook stalking, it
starts to reveal itself.
"When I first started at Stanford,
I was primarily making music by
myself," said Ryan Edwards 'l3.
"This year I got involved with IDA
[the Institute for Diversity in the
Arts] and found other people to
work with."
A junior sporting an afro and a
longboard, Edwards has been in
volved in music his entire life, play
ing the harmonica in elementary
school and taking the stage for the
first time during a talent show in the
fourth grade. He began dropping
beats and rapping when he came to
Stanford, mixing hip-hop with other
genres such as jazz and electronica.
Edwards formed a collective
with people he met through IDA,
and they began performing at dif
ferent functions on campus, such as
Wine and Cheese at Kairos and rush
events. For Edwards, getting in
volved in the music scene was tough
because it was not very visible to
him as a freshman.
"Finding people to work with
was difficult during my freshman
year because a lot of people would
be like, 'Oh, I'll rap on a track with
you because it sounds like fun and it
sounds cool,' but actually taking ac
tion and writing a verse and getting
onstage and performing it in front of
people, they don't follow through,"
he said. "It's just a matter of finding
the right people who are taking it se
riously."
Edwards added that working
with people is both more fun and
important for learning collabora
tion.
Others slid more seamlessly into
the music scene at Stanford.
"I took Music 171 [Chamber
Music] last year and they offer jazz
combos," Jared Naimark 'l4 said. "I
wanted to do something easy to
start, so I auditioned and was placed
in a group."
The group fell apart at the end of
last year but Naimark and two other
members continued to play into this
year and incorporated three new
members.
"It's more of a band this year,"
Naimark said.
He started learning music at a
young age and has been playing the
saxophone since the fourth grade.
He got involved in the music scene
at Stanford by jamming with people
in his freshman dorm, Larkin.
"It can be tough getting every
one in the same room and hard to
find committed people," Naimark
said. "There's also been some argu
ments about the vibe of the group."
Harry Doshay 'l4, another
member of the group, began playing
the bass when his dad left one in his
room when he was younger.
"He stuck the bass in the corner
of my room, and after a while it
started talking to me and so I started
playing it," Doshay said.
"It can be difficult to get people
to play on a regular basis at Stan
ford," he continued. "I just try to
play as much music as possible, at
every opportunity."

Their combo, named Too Big to
Mail its third name so far has
played at on-campus events such as
Monday Night Jazz at the CoHo,
Wine and Cheese at Kairos and Art
After Dark. However,Naimark and
Doshay are not interested in publi
cizing themselves too much.
"I'd like to continue playing jazz
and sax because it's how I express
myself, but we don't necessarily
want to put our name out,"Naimark
said. "It's just a fun thing to do, play
ing with friends."

"We're not really playing for
money or publicity," Doshay added.
"I just want to keep playing with
these guys and having fun. I'll prob
ably end up just like my dad and end
up playing with a bunch of buddies,
thinking I can rock, playing at my
own birthday party."
Stephen Henderson 'll M.A. 'l2
has also been playing music most of
his life.
"I grew up on the east side of
Maui that really harbored music,"
he said. "I started playing the guitar
and ukulele when I was 10."
When Henderson came to Stan
ford in 2005 as a freshman, he start
ed a reggae band called Paradise
