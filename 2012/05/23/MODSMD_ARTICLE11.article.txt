## EDITORIAL Lack of ownership leads to spoiled students 
### 
In February and March 2012, the
Green Living Council and
Aquacue, a water system elec
tronics and monitoring company,
sponsored the "Water Wars," a
month-long competition between
the different dorms in Florence
Moore (FloMo) to see which dorm
could reduce its water consumption
the most. The winning dorm was
promised a prize of $l,OOO for gen
eral dorm funds. A similar competi
tion at the University of California,
Merced incentivized students to cut
their water consumption by 14 per
cent, an impressive reduction. This
was to be a pleasant, good-spirited
competition in support of a greater
cause, right?
Alas, according to Aquacue, early
in the process, someone tampered
with one of its monitoring devices by
inserting wood chips so that the de
vice stopped reporting any water
flow. A backup device was left func
tioning, so no data was lost. More
troubling, however, was that some
one entered Loro's bathrooms and
left the showers and spigots running
overnight, wasting copious amounts
of water. By the end of the competi
tion, Loro used 17,585 more gallons
than its previous baseline consump
tion. For comparison, the winning
dorm Faisan cut its previous con
sumption by 1,306 gallons and the
most-improved dorm Gavilan cut its
consumption by 10,301 gallons.
The irony of the situation is
painfully obvious. The person(s)
who wasted incredible amounts of
Loro's water clearly missed the
point that these Water Wars were in
tended to reduce water consump
tion wasting water to give anoth
er dorm an edge defeats the entire
purpose of the competition.
The Editorial Board is con
cerned that this kind of behavior is
part of a broader lack of respect for
the community in many Stanford
residences. This particular action is
not typical of most Stanford stu
dents,yet many smaller acts of disre
spect take place daily.
In general, as Stanford students,
we are incredibly blessed. Dorm
residents have access to essentially
unlimited food up to 19 times a
week at dining halls or 10 times a
week in self-operated houses, pre
pared with little to no effort on be
half of the students. Most residences
have the luxury of a cleaning staff. It
can be all too easy to become com
placent in such an atmosphere.
On occasion, we see this compla
cency rear its ugly head in the form
of stacks of dirty plates abandoned
in hallways or dorm kitchenettes.

common spaces torn apart by week
end revelers and the accursed phe
nomenon of vomit in bathrooms
and hallways. In addition to being
inherently distasteful, these acts of
disrespect attack the very social fab
ric in residences they promote an
environment of unaccountability
and strain relationships within resi
dences and between students and
staff Perhaps we are spoiled by all of
the services we receive.
To that end, the Editorial Board
believes that more ownership and
accountability would create a resi
dential environment that truly
makes a home out of student hous
ing. Although difficult to implement,
one option is to have students partic
ipate in the upkeep of their resi
dences even in a small way, as self-ops
do with hash. Such a policy would
complement, not supplant, existing
custodial staff. If students were par
tially responsible for the upkeep of
common areas and bathrooms, for
instance, social attitudes among stu
dents toward behaviors like exces
sive intoxication and vomiting would
be vastly different. The sink you
puked in won't be cleaned by some
invisible force while you sleep or are
in class it will be cleaned by your
neighbor and peer, who will not be
pleased with your disregard for the
community and will exert social pres
sure on you to show respect. Of
course, these characteristics are pres
ent in Stanford's co-operatively run
residences, but the Editorial Board
does not expect every Stanford resi
dence to be a co-op.
Nevertheless, it is clear that stu
dent attitudes need to change. The
current reality in which costs of
room and board are paid by some
combination of funds from parents,
students and financial aid means
that students take Stanford and the
lifestyle we are afforded here for
granted. Wasting thousands of gal
lons of water to disadvantage peers
in a competition would be unthink
able in the "real world." Assisting
custodial staff in maintaining resi
dences makes students directly ac
countable for the actions they take
that negatively impact residences.
Programs like Stanford Habla build
community a different way, giving
hard-working Stanford employees
the benefit of English practice and
making students more cognizant of
the people who tirelessly work "be
hind the scenes." Even before this,
pointing out generally disrespectful
attitudes on the part of students who
are undoubtedly intelligent will
begin to cause much-needed
change.
