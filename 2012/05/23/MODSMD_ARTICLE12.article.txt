# BURSTING THE BUBBLE
## Clementi, Ravi and remorse 
### Edward Ngai 
A two-year tragedy may have
come to a close Monday
morning in a New Jersey
courtroom as Dharun Ravi was
sentenced to 30 days in prison for
invasion of privacy, bias crimes and
obstruction of justice.
Most of us have heard this sad
saga by now. Mr. Ravi arrives as a
computer-whiz freshman at Rutgers
University, meets his quiet, intro
verted roommate in Mr. Clementi
and later remotely records demen
ti's intimate moments with another
man on his webcam. He did this not
once, but twice; he posted these
videos to his public Twitter feed.
Days later, Tyler Clementi wrote
in his last Facebook post, "Jumping
off GW Bridge, sorry."
Mr. Ravi's sentence Monday
morning represents a somewhat sur
prising conclusion to a case that has
captured media attention for some
20 months. Indeed, Judge Glenn
Berman's verdict 30 days in
county jail was immediately con
tested by both sides as they sought its
appeal.
"I've disenchanted both sides,"
Berman admitted after both the
prosecution and defense moved to
stay the verdict.
Many think 30 days is just not
enough. This is someone's life here
someone whose life was lost,
whose family must suffer, whose
friends have been hurt. This was no

innocent prank.
True. But we must remember
that Mr. Ravi was not charged with
Tylers death. What he did was,in the
judge's words, "colossally ignorant,"
but he did not push Tyler off the
bridge at least not in the eyes of
the law, and rightfully so. The burden
of Tyler's death is purely a moral one,
and one that should weigh very
heavily on Mr. Ravi for the rest of his
life.
The truth is that Mr. Ravi is also
now irreparably damaged. He has
been living in exile for the last two
years. Work, at least work he is qual
ified for, is surely out of reach for the
rest of his life. His mother sobbed
during the trial about how her son
does not eat, does not sleep, is not the
teenager he should be. And every
mother, and perhaps every son,
should empathize with her sorrow.
But does Mr. Ravi feel this emo
tional burden? Does he really feel
remorse? The judge was very quick
to point out in his verdict that though
Mr. Ravi apologized to the demen
tis in passing in his pre-sentencing

paperwork, he made no mention of
the man the court refers to as "M.
8.," dementi's partner, whose name
was redacted for the trial. The usual
ly stoic Ravi cried yesterday in the
courtroom not for his freshman
year roommate, but for his mother,
whose letter was punctuated by
wails and sobs.
And the defense made Dharun
the victim. He's been living in exile.
He's not been able to lead a normal
life. He was just 18 when he did this!
It was just a prank. Dharun's reputa
tion is forever tarnished. Dharun
won't be able to find work. Dharun
won't be able to pursue the Ameri
can Dream his parents had for him
when they immigrated with two suit
cases and nothing else. Dharun this,
Dharun that. Dharun a victim, just
another victim.
In many ways, he is. But in many
ways he should know far better than
to play this card, even if it's just a
lawyer's strategy to get a lighter sen
tence (a successful one, as it turns

out).
Because we now live in a world
where after Mr. Ravi has finished
passing through the scrutiny of the
judicial system which is no sure
thing given both sides' indignation
regarding the verdict —he must
pass through the scrutiny of the
American people, who will judge for
themselves this man's character
through the video and blog com
mentary that has already flooded
the Internet after his sentencing.
At least one judge will be look
ing, above all else, to see whether or
not Tyler dementi's death has taken
a moral toll on Dharun Ravi.
Which is why it was very disap
pointing to hear in the courtroom,
again and again, that Dharun too
was a victim, that he too had his life
destroyed, that he was improperly
judged by the feeding frenzy that is
the news media, that he does not de
serve the scorn that this nation has
for him right now.
Yes, Dharun is a victim. But his

situation is self-inflicted. And if we
can call him a victim, then I do not
know what word we can use to de
scribe Tyler or his family.
Monday morning, the judge of
fered Mr. Ravi an opportunity to ad
dress the court. The cameras were
still rolling, of course.The judge actu
ally offered Mr. Ravi an opportunity
to address the nation.
He could have stood up and of
fered simple words of apology to
everyone he has hurt: the Clementis,
his classmates at Rutgers, the wit
nesses he tampered with and, above
all, his family. Instead, he shook his
head no.
The nation is still waiting to hear
Dharun Ravi apologize for what he
has done. Given his apparent lack of
remorse, it's likely their verdict will
be much harsher than 30 days in
county jail.

know what word we can use to de
scribe Tyler or his family.
Monday morning, the judge of
fered Mr. Ravi an opportunity to ad
dress the court. The cameras were
still rolling, of course.The judge actu
ally offered Mr. Ravi an opportunity
to address the nation.
He could have stood up and of
fered simple words of apology to
everyone he has hurt: the Clementis,
his classmates at Rutgers, the wit
nesses he tampered with and, above
all, his family. Instead, he shook his
head no.
The nation is still waiting to hear
Dharun Ravi apologize for what he
has done. Given his apparent lack of
remorse, it's likely their verdict will
be much harsher than 30 days in
county jail.

A two-year tragedy may have
come to a close Monday
morning in a New Jersey
courtroom as Dharun Ravi was
sentenced to 30 days in prison for
invasion of privacy, bias crimes and
obstruction of justice.
Most of us have heard this sad
saga by now. Mr. Ravi arrives as a
computer-whiz freshman at Rutgers
University, meets his quiet, intro
verted roommate in Mr. Clementi
and later remotely records demen
ti's intimate moments with another
man on his webcam. He did this not
once, but twice; he posted these
videos to his public Twitter feed.
Days later, Tyler Clementi wrote
in his last Facebook post, "Jumping
off GW Bridge, sorry."
Mr. Ravi's sentence Monday
morning represents a somewhat sur
prising conclusion to a case that has
captured media attention for some
20 months. Indeed, Judge Glenn
Berman's verdict 30 days in
county jail was immediately con
tested by both sides as they sought its
appeal.
"I've disenchanted both sides,"
Berman admitted after both the
prosecution and defense moved to
stay the verdict.
Many think 30 days is just not
enough. This is someone's life here
someone whose life was lost,
whose family must suffer, whose
friends have been hurt. This was no

innocent prank.
True. But we must remember
that Mr. Ravi was not charged with
Tylers death. What he did was,in the
judge's words, "colossally ignorant,"
but he did not push Tyler off the
bridge at least not in the eyes of
the law, and rightfully so. The burden
of Tyler's death is purely a moral one,
and one that should weigh very
heavily on Mr. Ravi for the rest of his
life.
The truth is that Mr. Ravi is also
now irreparably damaged. He has
been living in exile for the last two
years. Work, at least work he is qual
ified for, is surely out of reach for the
rest of his life. His mother sobbed
during the trial about how her son
does not eat, does not sleep, is not the
teenager he should be. And every
mother, and perhaps every son,
should empathize with her sorrow.
But does Mr. Ravi feel this emo
tional burden? Does he really feel
remorse? The judge was very quick
to point out in his verdict that though
Mr. Ravi apologized to the demen
tis in passing in his pre-sentencing

paperwork, he made no mention of
the man the court refers to as "M.
8.," dementi's partner, whose name
was redacted for the trial. The usual
ly stoic Ravi cried yesterday in the
courtroom not for his freshman
year roommate, but for his mother,
whose letter was punctuated by
wails and sobs.
And the defense made Dharun
the victim. He's been living in exile.
He's not been able to lead a normal
life. He was just 18 when he did this!
It was just a prank. Dharun's reputa
tion is forever tarnished. Dharun
won't be able to find work. Dharun
won't be able to pursue the Ameri
can Dream his parents had for him
when they immigrated with two suit
cases and nothing else. Dharun this,
Dharun that. Dharun a victim, just
another victim.
In many ways, he is. But in many
ways he should know far better than
to play this card, even if it's just a
lawyer's strategy to get a lighter sen
tence (a successful one, as it turns

out).
Because we now live in a world
where after Mr. Ravi has finished
passing through the scrutiny of the
judicial system which is no sure
thing given both sides' indignation
regarding the verdict —he must
pass through the scrutiny of the
American people, who will judge for
themselves this man's character
through the video and blog com
mentary that has already flooded
the Internet after his sentencing.
At least one judge will be look
ing, above all else, to see whether or
not Tyler dementi's death has taken
a moral toll on Dharun Ravi.
Which is why it was very disap
pointing to hear in the courtroom,
again and again, that Dharun too
was a victim, that he too had his life
destroyed, that he was improperly
judged by the feeding frenzy that is
the news media, that he does not de
serve the scorn that this nation has
for him right now.
Yes, Dharun is a victim. But his

situation is self-inflicted. And if we
can call him a victim, then I do not
know what word we can use to de
scribe Tyler or his family.
