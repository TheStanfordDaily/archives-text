## Professional procrastination 
### Rave Reddy 
According to my calcula
tions, we're in the middle
of week eight, which
means two things: that summer is
right around the corner and that
most students are finding them
selves buried under all the final
papers and presentations that ac
company the school year's end.
But in typical Stanford student
fashion, the more work we have,
the more ways we conjure to
avoid it.

Procrastinating is as natural to
us as being busy is, and since most
people tend to spend their time
procrastinating on Facebook and
my last column was all about get
ting people to take Facebook a lit
tle less seriously (which starts with
spending less time on the site), I
decided to compile a list of the
best ways to procrastinate proper
ly and productively. After all, if
you can't beat them, join them.
So without further ado, I pres
ent the tips to professional pro
crastination:

1. Call home.
Calling home is a fantastic way
to procrastinate. Not only does it
force those of us who are bad at
staying in touch to check in and
remind our families that we are
still alive, but it's also fail-proof,
considering that your parents will
never get mad at you for spending
time catching up with them. Plus,
chances are you'll end this phone
call a little more motivated than
when you started it. Parents are
really good at saying things like "I
know you'll do great on your
midterm!" even when you know
this may not be true.

2. Do your laundry or clean your
room.

Cleaning is just not fun, and
chances are, you rarely ever want
to do it. However, chances also are
that you find your problem set
even less fun than you find clean
ing. So if you're really dreading
your work, try taking a break and
channeling that energy into vacu
uming your floor or hauling your
clothes down the three flights of
stairs to the laundry room. You
may not get your problem set
done, but at least you'll be able to
wear your favorite shirt and look
good tomorrow when you hop on
your bike three minutes before the
p-set is due so you can turn it in.

3. Go get food or coffee.
Picture this: you're sitting
around with all of your friends.
Everyone is working on their own
thing, whether that's writing a
PWR paper or studying for a
Chem 135 midterm, when sud
denly one person lets out a loud
sigh and says, "I'm starving. Late
Nite, anyone?" Next thing you
know, the person to your right is
talking about how they definitely
need to tag along so they can get a
cup of coffee, and you start think
ing about how you could probably
use a cookie as a little pick-me-up,
even though you're not that hun
gry. Ten minutes later, you're all at
Late Nite sitting around a table,
laughing, talking, running into
other friends, basically doing
everything but working, and this
continues for at least 30 minutes.
Getting food is the perfect way to
procrastinate. After all, no one is
ever going to challenge the legiti
macy of your hunger, and you can
always make yourself feel better
about trekking over to Arrillaga
or Lakeside by telling yourself
that the energy drink you just

bought will get you through the
rest of your assignment/night.
4. Make to-do lists.
I'm fairly positive I spend
more time making to-do lists than
I spend doing the things on them.
That having been said, writing
down all the things you have to do
and making a schedule of when
you plan on doing them and how
long they will take is usually a safe
procrastination technique. In
most cases, the sheer length of
your list should scare you into get
ting started on your work.

5. Go jump in a fountain.
With the weather having been
so nice lately, it's hard to miss the
groups of students splashing
around in the fountains. When it
gets too hot to focus, just tell your
self that fountains are the most ef
ficient way to cool off, slip into
your bathing suit and go dive in
(except not literally since you'll
hurt yourself). I highly recom
mend the newest fountain, which
is located behind the Thornton
Center and is a total beauty.
So there you have it the
tools for proper procrastination.
Hopefully, using any of the above
will leave you a lot happier and a
little less prone to further procras
tination than when you started.
Happy procrastinating Stanford!
