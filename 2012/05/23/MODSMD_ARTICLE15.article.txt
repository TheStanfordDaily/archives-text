# It's not you, NBA coach, it's them
## 
### Zdi Zimmerman Aaishing the Rock 
Stan Van Gundy is a great
NBA coach. He's a brilliant
basketball mind who took
a defensively dysfunctional
organization and turned it
into an efficient winning machine. His
five-year stint with the Orlando
Magic was easily the most successful
coaching tenure in franchise history,
with a Finals appearance in 2009 ac
centuating a 259-135 regular-season
record.
Now, Stan Van Gundy is unem
ployed because the culture of coach
ing has transformed to accommodate
the ever-growing trend of players de
manding more respect than those
they should call their bosses.
To say the position of NBA head
coach is in a state of flux would be like
calling Kobe's shot selection a bit ex
cessive. Of the 29 coaches currently
employed by NBA franchises, only
three began in their current roles be
fore 2008, with just one, San Anto
nio's Gregg Popovich, starting prior
to 2000. Aside from Popovich, and
possibly Boston's Doc Rivers, it's
ridiculous to even attempt to make a
case for any current head coaches as
future Hall of Famers.
This is disheartening. Basketball
has skyrocketed in global popularity
and, like any growing sport, has
evolved to become scientifically ana
lyzed and produced. Coaches and
players fluidly understand certain
facets of the game that just didn't exist
25 years ago. With the game becom
ing visibly more skilled at every level,
the NBA coaching fraternity should
consist of 30 of the most qualified
people in the world.
The problem is, this isn't the case.
Out of the NBA writers I follow on
Twitter, I could easily pick five that I
would choose to serve as head coach
for my team over a multitude of cur
rent leaders. These include people
who didn't play organized hoops past
high school, which is irrelevant. The
argument that these guys haven't
been there before and couldn't guide
a group of professional athletes is an
tiquated at best.
Coaches are picked through a
type of "old boys" club that promotes
nepotism and perpetuates the cycle
of promoting former NBA affiliates
unsuited to fill the role. It's why we've
seen mind-numbing substitutions
and even more ludicrous quotes com
ing from guys in charge of playoff
teams. That can't happen at the high
est level of any sport.
The root of the issue is money. As
the battle to become a "max-contract
player" wages on, those already in
that upper echelon of salaries or
those who feel deserving of greater
recognition take it upon themselves
to demean their bosses and stage ver
bal coups. Those in higher manage
ment are afraid of alienating star
players their moneymakers
and often force coaches onto the
most uncomfortable of islands. How
can a guy possibly do his job with the
looming threat of a rebellious star
constantly looming over everything?
This past season's Dwight
Howard saga was brutal for me to en
dure as a Magic fan, but nowhere
close to as painful as it must have
been for Van Gundy. Dwight's ap
palling lack of respect for his coach
who I believe transformed Howard
into a dominant post defender ul
timately led to the coach's demise.
Van Gundy is a hard-ass, a no-non
sense basketball disciple who refused
to give in to constant outside pres
sures. He went about his job, coached
his team the way he thought it should
be coached and managed to get the
Magic to the playoffs for the fifth con
secutive year, with or without
Howard. As a reward, he got canned.
Star culture won't budge without
a dramatic change in player account
ability. In an ideal world, every one of
the 30 franchises would routinely and
sufficiently punish players who refuse
to adhere to a coach's philosophy.
That doesn't mean that players
shouldn't have a say; they should just
handle themselves professionally
and with cautious candor. Without
this radical alteration, coaching posi
tions will continue to be occupied by
multimillionaire babysitters who suc
cumb to their leading scorers instead
of teaching the game of basketball. I
don't want to be a part of that world
anymore.
This is possibly an exaggerated
rant in the wake of Orlando's recent
decision, but basketball fans can't
possibly like the direction in which
things are headed. People like Vinny

Del Negro and Mike Brown are in
unbelievably high-profile positions
on teams that should be regular con
tenders. There's something wrong
with that.
Bring coaches back. Basketball
misses them.

Howard saga was brutal for me to en
dure as a Magic fan, but nowhere
close to as painful as it must have
been for Van Gundy. Dwight's ap
palling lack of respect for his coach
who I believe transformed Howard
into a dominant post defender ul
timately led to the coach's demise.
Van Gundy is a hard-ass, a no-non
sense basketball disciple who refused
to give in to constant outside pres
sures. He went about his job, coached
his team the way he thought it should
be coached and managed to get the
Magic to the playoffs for the fifth con
secutive year, with or without
Howard. As a reward, he got canned.
Star culture won't budge without
a dramatic change in player account
ability. In an ideal world, every one of
the 30 franchises would routinely and
sufficiently punish players who refuse
to adhere to a coach's philosophy.
That doesn't mean that players
shouldn't have a say; they should just
handle themselves professionally
and with cautious candor. Without
this radical alteration, coaching posi
tions will continue to be occupied by
multimillionaire babysitters who suc
cumb to their leading scorers instead
of teaching the game of basketball. I
don't want to be a part of that world
anymore.
This is possibly an exaggerated
rant in the wake of Orlando's recent
decision, but basketball fans can't
possibly like the direction in which
things are headed. People like Vinny

Del Negro and Mike Brown are in
unbelievably high-profile positions
on teams that should be regular con
tenders. There's something wrong
with that.
Bring coaches back. Basketball
misses them.

Stan Van Gundy is a great
NBA coach. He's a brilliant
basketball mind who took
a defensively dysfunctional
organization and turned it
into an efficient winning machine. His
five-year stint with the Orlando
Magic was easily the most successful
coaching tenure in franchise history,
with a Finals appearance in 2009 ac
centuating a 259-135 regular-season
record.
Now, Stan Van Gundy is unem
ployed because the culture of coach
ing has transformed to accommodate
the ever-growing trend of players de
manding more respect than those
they should call their bosses.
To say the position of NBA head
coach is in a state of flux would be like
calling Kobe's shot selection a bit ex
cessive. Of the 29 coaches currently
employed by NBA franchises, only
three began in their current roles be
fore 2008, with just one, San Anto
nio's Gregg Popovich, starting prior
to 2000. Aside from Popovich, and
possibly Boston's Doc Rivers, it's
ridiculous to even attempt to make a
case for any current head coaches as
future Hall of Famers.
This is disheartening. Basketball
has skyrocketed in global popularity
and, like any growing sport, has
evolved to become scientifically ana
lyzed and produced. Coaches and
players fluidly understand certain
facets of the game that just didn't exist
25 years ago. With the game becom
ing visibly more skilled at every level,
the NBA coaching fraternity should
consist of 30 of the most qualified
people in the world.
The problem is, this isn't the case.
Out of the NBA writers I follow on
Twitter, I could easily pick five that I
would choose to serve as head coach
for my team over a multitude of cur
rent leaders. These include people
who didn't play organized hoops past
high school, which is irrelevant. The
argument that these guys haven't
been there before and couldn't guide
a group of professional athletes is an
tiquated at best.
Coaches are picked through a
type of "old boys" club that promotes
nepotism and perpetuates the cycle
of promoting former NBA affiliates
unsuited to fill the role. It's why we've
seen mind-numbing substitutions
and even more ludicrous quotes com
ing from guys in charge of playoff
teams. That can't happen at the high
est level of any sport.
The root of the issue is money. As
the battle to become a "max-contract
player" wages on, those already in
that upper echelon of salaries or
those who feel deserving of greater
recognition take it upon themselves
to demean their bosses and stage ver
bal coups. Those in higher manage
ment are afraid of alienating star
players their moneymakers
and often force coaches onto the
most uncomfortable of islands. How
can a guy possibly do his job with the
looming threat of a rebellious star
constantly looming over everything?
