## BRONCOS BLASTED 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Junior centerfielder Jake Stewart had al
ready singled, doubled and homered when he
came to the plate in his fourth at-bat on Tues
day night, needing a triple to complete the first
cycle of his Stanford career.
Instead, he added his second home run of
the evening instead to polish off one of the best
games he's played on the Farm.
Stewart went blow-for-blow with Santa
Clara on Tuesday night, as No. 14 Stanford
equaled its longest winning streak of the year
with its eighth straight victory to stay hot head
ing into its final regular-season series. Stewart's
full-count, two-run homer in the eighth inning
was a huge boost for the Cardinal (37-14,17-10
Pac-12) in its 10-5 win over the Broncos (25-26,
4-17 West Coast Conference).
"I was just trying to get on base every single
time I was up," he told GoStanford.com.
"That's what the leadoff hitter's job is, and I
was just trying to do that all day."
Stanford closes out its nonconference sea
son with an impressive 20-4 record, including a
near-perfect 10-2 mark in midweek games.
The Cardinal still has its sights set on the
close race for the Pac-12 title as it prepares to
host Cal this weekend. Stanford, Arizona State
and UCLA all trail Oregon by two games and
are one back of Arizona, meaning that a series
win against the Golden Bears would guarantee
the Cardinal at worst a third-place finish. With
the Ducks squaring off against competitive in
state rival Oregon State which dominated
one of the teams' two midweek meetings this

year Stanford is by no means out of con
tention for its first conference title since 2004.
Even though last night's win won't help the
Cardinal move up in the standings, the all
around effort had to be pretty encouraging for
head coach Mark Marquess. Besides Stewart's
heroics, freshman designated hitter Dominic
Jose and sophomore rightfielder Austin Wilson
each had three hits, with the former doubling
twice and the latter netting a two-bagger of his
own.
After a moderately productive four-hit
weekend against Utah, Stewart didn't give
Bronco starter Tommy Nance any time to set
tle in, blasting the first pitch of the game for his
fifth homer of the season.
"I was looking for a fastball somewhere in
the zone that I could put a swing on," Stewart
said. "Luckily I got one up in the zone that I
could drive somewhere."
Stewart and sophomore second baseman
Danny Diekroeger then opened up the third
with back-to-back walks, but Stewart was
thrown out at home on an infield grounder and
only Diekroeger came around to score.
Santa Clara cut into that tenuous 2-0 lead in
the bottom half of the third on an error by Wil
son — just the fifth of the season for the .970
fielder but Stewart helped break things
open in the fifth when he got on base to lead off
an inning for the third time. He later scored on
a single by sophomore first baseman Brian Ra
gira, with Wilson tacking on a fourth run on his
ensuing double and freshman third baseman
Alex Blandino making it 5-1 with a hit of his
own.
The Broncos got their second run off junior

righthander Sahil Bloom in the bottom of the
fifth, and climbed back within striking distance
when designated hitter Quinton Perry tat
tooed freshman righty David Schmidt's second
pitch in relief for his fourth home run of the
year.
Stewart responded with a leadoff double
and came around to make it 6-3, but Santa
Clara sophomore Kyle DeMerritt came back
with a double of his own to spark a two-run
Bronco rally in the bottom of the seventh.
A double play in the eighth seemed to set up
Santa Clara for a comeback, but Stewart's two
run jack with a full count extended the Cardi
nal lead to 8-5.
"We try to keep those rallies going with two
outs and nobody on," Stewart said. "The wind
was blowing out and it was helping me out a lit
tle on that one."
Stanford added two more runs in the ninth
marking the first time all game that the team
had scored without Stewart coming to the plate
on a two-run double by Jose. Hitting from
the right side in response to a Bronco pitching
change, Jose was thrown out at third trying to
extend the play, but a scoreless bottom of the
ninth clinched the 10-5 win.
Redshirt sophomore lefthander Garrett
Hughes (2-1) got the win after his scoreless,
two-inning start.
The Cardinal now has two days of rest be
fore it hosts Cal (27-24,15-10). Stanford won
both conference games in Berkeley last year,
with the finale cut off due to rain with the Car
dinal leading 7-1 in the fourth inning.

Clara on Tuesday night, as No. 14 Stanford
equaled its longest winning streak of the year
with its eighth straight victory to stay hot head
ing into its final regular-season series. Stewart's
full-count, two-run homer in the eighth inning
was a huge boost for the Cardinal (37-14,17-10
Pac-12) in its 10-5 win over the Broncos (25-26,
4-17 West Coast Conference).
"I was just trying to get on base every single
time I was up," he told GoStanford.com.
"That's what the leadoff hitter's job is, and I
was just trying to do that all day."
Stanford closes out its nonconference sea
son with an impressive 20-4 record, including a
near-perfect 10-2 mark in midweek games.
The Cardinal still has its sights set on the
close race for the Pac-12 title as it prepares to
host Cal this weekend. Stanford, Arizona State
and UCLA all trail Oregon by two games and
are one back of Arizona, meaning that a series
win against the Golden Bears would guarantee
the Cardinal at worst a third-place finish. With
the Ducks squaring off against competitive in
state rival Oregon State which dominated
one of the teams' two midweek meetings this

year Stanford is by no means out of con
tention for its first conference title since 2004.
Even though last night's win won't help the
Cardinal move up in the standings, the all
around effort had to be pretty encouraging for
head coach Mark Marquess. Besides Stewart's
heroics, freshman designated hitter Dominic
Jose and sophomore rightfielder Austin Wilson
each had three hits, with the former doubling
twice and the latter netting a two-bagger of his
own.
After a moderately productive four-hit
weekend against Utah, Stewart didn't give
Bronco starter Tommy Nance any time to set
tle in, blasting the first pitch of the game for his
fifth homer of the season.
"I was looking for a fastball somewhere in
the zone that I could put a swing on," Stewart
said. "Luckily I got one up in the zone that I
could drive somewhere."
Stewart and sophomore second baseman
Danny Diekroeger then opened up the third
with back-to-back walks, but Stewart was
thrown out at home on an infield grounder and
only Diekroeger came around to score.
Santa Clara cut into that tenuous 2-0 lead in
the bottom half of the third on an error by Wil
son — just the fifth of the season for the .970
fielder but Stewart helped break things
open in the fifth when he got on base to lead off
an inning for the third time. He later scored on
a single by sophomore first baseman Brian Ra
gira, with Wilson tacking on a fourth run on his
ensuing double and freshman third baseman
Alex Blandino making it 5-1 with a hit of his
own.
The Broncos got their second run off junior

righthander Sahil Bloom in the bottom of the
fifth, and climbed back within striking distance
when designated hitter Quinton Perry tat
tooed freshman righty David Schmidt's second
pitch in relief for his fourth home run of the
year.
Stewart responded with a leadoff double
and came around to make it 6-3, but Santa
Clara sophomore Kyle DeMerritt came back
with a double of his own to spark a two-run
Bronco rally in the bottom of the seventh.
A double play in the eighth seemed to set up
Santa Clara for a comeback, but Stewart's two
run jack with a full count extended the Cardi
nal lead to 8-5.
"We try to keep those rallies going with two
outs and nobody on," Stewart said. "The wind
was blowing out and it was helping me out a lit
tle on that one."
Stanford added two more runs in the ninth
marking the first time all game that the team
had scored without Stewart coming to the plate
on a two-run double by Jose. Hitting from
the right side in response to a Bronco pitching
change, Jose was thrown out at third trying to
extend the play, but a scoreless bottom of the
ninth clinched the 10-5 win.
Redshirt sophomore lefthander Garrett
Hughes (2-1) got the win after his scoreless,
two-inning start.
The Cardinal now has two days of rest be
fore it hosts Cal (27-24,15-10). Stanford won
both conference games in Berkeley last year,
with the finale cut off due to rain with the Car
dinal leading 7-1 in the fourth inning.

Junior Jake Stewart recorded a single, a double and two home runs in Tuesday night's 10-5 victory over Santa Clara, marking one of the best
games of his career. The No. 14 Stanford baseball team extended its win streak to eight games as it heads into its final regular-season series.

ready singled, doubled and homered when he
came to the plate in his fourth at-bat on Tues

cycle of his Stanford career.
Instead, he added his second home run of
the evening instead to polish off one of the best
games he's played on the Farm.
