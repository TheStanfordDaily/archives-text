# GEORGIA ON THE MIND
## Gibbs, Burdette earn top seeds 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis
team saw its hopes for a second
national title in three years
crushed in a 4-2 loss to USC on
Saturday, but four Cardinal
players, sophomore Nicole
Gibbs, junior Mallory Burdette,
junior Stacey Tan and freshman
Ellen Tsay, remain in Athens,
Ga., to represent Stanford in the
NCAA Singles and Doubles
Championships this week.
Despite Saturday's abrupt
ending to the team's season,
Gibbs said that it provides an
opportunity for the returning
group to learn and improve for
next year's dual-match season.
"Our coaches and our captain
[senior Veronica Li] spoke in the
locker room afterwards," Gibbs
said. "We reflected on the match,
as we do after any loss or any
win. This team has been through
a lot of adversity, and it was a
good moment to observe the
year and figure out how we can
grow from it."
However, No. 3 seed Gibbs
and her Cardinal teammates will
have little time to reflect, as they
must quickly refocus their atten
tion from team play to the
NCAA Singles and Doubles
Championships, which com
mence on Wednesday for singles
and Thursday for doubles.
"There is definitely a differ
ent mental aspect when playing
individually," Gibbs said, "be
cause if you lose, you're done.
Your teammates aren't there to
bail you out."
Gibbs, the top-seeded Stan
ford player, manned court one
for the Cardinal all season and
put up a 31-5 overall record. She
captured the ITA Northwest Re
gional Championship in Octo
ber, the first singles title of her
career, and captured her second
title on April 29, winning the
Pac-12 Championship. Riding an
11-match win streak, the All-
American is entering the tour
nament with reserved confi
dence.
"I don't think this tourna
ment will define me one way or
another," she explained. "I've
had validating performances in
other individual tournaments
this year, I've felt comfortable
with my dual record and I've felt
like I've played well. I'm going in
with a lot of confidence, but the
draw is stacked with the best
players in the country so it'll be a
challenge."
She opens play against Vir
ginia's Emily Fraser on Wednes
day, whom she described as hav
ing "an all-court game style with
a big serve." No. 5 seed Mallory
Burdette will take on South Car
olina State's Maria Craciun, and
No. 25 seed Stacey Tan will face
Rice's Natalie Beazant.
Both Craciun and Beazant
are unfamiliar opponents for the
Cardinal, but if Stanford's repre
sentatives can make it deeper
into the tournament, they could
encounter more familiar Pac-12
faces.
The doubles tournament
commences on Thursday as the
second-seeded pairing of Gibbs
and Burdette takes on Prince
ton's Hilary Bartlett and Lindsay
Graff. This will be Gibbs and
Burdette's first opportunity at
redemption after losing their
doubles match on Saturday to
USC's Sabrina Santamaria and
Kaitlyn Christian. Santamaria
and Christian are not in the Stan
ford pair's quarter of the draw,
but Gibbs would relish a rematch
on the national stage.
"I have a feeling that, if we
were to meet, it would be late in
the tournament," she said. "We
would love to make up for those
two losses, but it would be a chal

lenge for sure."
But before focusing on re
venge, the dominant pairing of
Gibbs and Burdette will have to
get past Bartlett and Graff, a
first-team All-Ivy League dou
bles team.
"Personally, I'm focusing on
getting a higher percentage of re
turns in the court, moving across
the court to cut off ground
strokes and poaching more," she
explained." [Burdette and I] only
experienced two dual-match
losses all year so we aren't mak
ing monumental changes, but we
do have to bring the intensity."
Tan and Tsay, an at-large se
lection to compete in the doubles
draw, will seek to bring a similar
intensity against their opening
opponent. No. 8 seed Kristy
Frilling and Shannon Mathews
of Notre Dame.
Both Stanford pairs will have
to adjust to altered rules in com
parison to the regular season.
Unlike regular season dual
matches, where doubles are
played as eight-game pro sets,
the NCAA doubles tournament
will require the best two out of
three sets. This, along with singles
play, naturally will place signifi
cant physical stress on the body.
"I'm definitely waiting for
the storm to come," Gibbs
quipped. "But we have all the
tools necessary here to deal with
it, and we're all planning on find
ing away to keep our bodies
running."
Individual play begins today
with Burdette's match at 9:30
a.m. PDT, followed by Gibbs and
Tan at 12:30 p.m. PDT. Doubles
play opens on Thursday, May 24,
with times to be announced.

opponent. No. 8 seed Kristy
Frilling and Shannon Mathews
of Notre Dame.
Both Stanford pairs will have
to adjust to altered rules in com
parison to the regular season.
Unlike regular season dual
matches, where doubles are
played as eight-game pro sets,
the NCAA doubles tournament
will require the best two out of
three sets. This, along with singles
play, naturally will place signifi
cant physical stress on the body.
"I'm definitely waiting for
the storm to come," Gibbs
quipped. "But we have all the
tools necessary here to deal with
it, and we're all planning on find
ing away to keep our bodies
running."
Individual play begins today
with Burdette's match at 9:30
a.m. PDT, followed by Gibbs and
Tan at 12:30 p.m. PDT. Doubles
play opens on Thursday, May 24,
with times to be announced.

Sophomore Nicole Gibbs, who captured the Pac-12 singles title in April,
is seeded No. 3 heading into today's NCAA Singles Championship. She
and partner Mallory Burdette are seeded No. 2 in the doubles draw.
The Stanford women's tennis
team saw its hopes for a second
national title in three years
crushed in a 4-2 loss to USC on
Saturday, but four Cardinal
players, sophomore Nicole
Gibbs, junior Mallory Burdette,
junior Stacey Tan and freshman
Ellen Tsay, remain in Athens,
Ga., to represent Stanford in the
NCAA Singles and Doubles
Championships this week.
Despite Saturday's abrupt
ending to the team's season,
Gibbs said that it provides an
opportunity for the returning
group to learn and improve for
next year's dual-match season.
"Our coaches and our captain
[senior Veronica Li] spoke in the
locker room afterwards," Gibbs
said. "We reflected on the match,
as we do after any loss or any
win. This team has been through
a lot of adversity, and it was a
good moment to observe the
year and figure out how we can
grow from it."
However, No. 3 seed Gibbs
and her Cardinal teammates will
have little time to reflect, as they
must quickly refocus their atten
tion from team play to the
NCAA Singles and Doubles
Championships, which com
mence on Wednesday for singles
and Thursday for doubles.
"There is definitely a differ
ent mental aspect when playing
individually," Gibbs said, "be
cause if you lose, you're done.
Your teammates aren't there to
bail you out."
Gibbs, the top-seeded Stan
ford player, manned court one
for the Cardinal all season and
put up a 31-5 overall record. She
captured the ITA Northwest Re
gional Championship in Octo
ber, the first singles title of her
career, and captured her second
title on April 29, winning the
Pac-12 Championship. Riding an
11-match win streak, the All-
American is entering the tour
nament with reserved confi
dence.
"I don't think this tourna
ment will define me one way or
another," she explained. "I've
had validating performances in
other individual tournaments
this year, I've felt comfortable
with my dual record and I've felt
like I've played well. I'm going in
with a lot of confidence, but the
draw is stacked with the best
players in the country so it'll be a
challenge."
She opens play against Vir
ginia's Emily Fraser on Wednes
day, whom she described as hav
ing "an all-court game style with
a big serve." No. 5 seed Mallory
Burdette will take on South Car
olina State's Maria Craciun, and
No. 25 seed Stacey Tan will face
Rice's Natalie Beazant.
Both Craciun and Beazant
are unfamiliar opponents for the
Cardinal, but if Stanford's repre
sentatives can make it deeper
into the tournament, they could
encounter more familiar Pac-12
faces.
The doubles tournament
commences on Thursday as the
second-seeded pairing of Gibbs
and Burdette takes on Prince
ton's Hilary Bartlett and Lindsay
Graff. This will be Gibbs and
Burdette's first opportunity at
redemption after losing their
doubles match on Saturday to
USC's Sabrina Santamaria and
Kaitlyn Christian. Santamaria
and Christian are not in the Stan
ford pair's quarter of the draw,
but Gibbs would relish a rematch
on the national stage.
"I have a feeling that, if we
were to meet, it would be late in
the tournament," she said. "We
would love to make up for those
two losses, but it would be a chal

lenge for sure."
But before focusing on re
venge, the dominant pairing of
Gibbs and Burdette will have to
get past Bartlett and Graff, a
first-team All-Ivy League dou
bles team.
"Personally, I'm focusing on
getting a higher percentage of re
turns in the court, moving across
the court to cut off ground
strokes and poaching more," she
explained." [Burdette and I] only
experienced two dual-match
losses all year so we aren't mak
ing monumental changes, but we
do have to bring the intensity."
Tan and Tsay, an at-large se
lection to compete in the doubles
draw, will seek to bring a similar
intensity against their opening
opponent. No. 8 seed Kristy
Frilling and Shannon Mathews
of Notre Dame.
Both Stanford pairs will have
to adjust to altered rules in com
parison to the regular season.
