Having seen their dual-match season
come to an end on Sunday afternoon in a

the No. 4 seed in the 32-team doubles draw,
and both seniors received at-large bids in
the 64-man singles draw.
The singles tournament will open on
Wednesday, with the doubles event begin

an entire round completed each day, cul

University of Georgia, will see Klahn hop

had goose bumps as we drove into town

familiar spots that bring back great memo

sion in the postseason and appears to be
peaking at just the right time. Klahn has
