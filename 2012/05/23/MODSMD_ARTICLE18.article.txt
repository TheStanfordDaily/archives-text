# Senior duo hopes for strong finish

### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Having seen their dual-match season
come to an end on Sunday afternoon in a
heartbreaker against Virginia, members of
the Stanford men's tennis team will look to
bounce back and conclude the season on a
high note as they enter the NCAA Singles
and Doubles Championships today in
Athens, Ga.
Stanford will once again be represent
ed by seniors Bradley Klahn and Ryan
Thacher in both events. The pairing will be
the No. 4 seed in the 32-team doubles draw,
and both seniors received at-large bids in
the 64-man singles draw.
The singles tournament will open on
Wednesday, with the doubles event begin
ning a day later. Both competitions will see
an entire round completed each day, cul
minating in two finals scheduled for Mon
day, May 28.
The event, which will take place at the
University of Georgia, will see Klahn hop
ing to replicate his performance on the
same courts in 2010, when he stormed to
the NCAA singles title as a No. 13 seed.
"I have very fond memories of this
place, winning it two years ago here, and I
had goose bumps as we drove into town
last week for the team event, seeing all the
familiar spots that bring back great memo
ries," Klahn said.
While Klahn missed the beginning of
the season with an unpredictable back ail
ment, he has a record of rising to the occa
sion in the postseason and appears to be
peaking at just the right time. Klahn has
lost just twice in his past 13 singles match
es, with both defeats coming against top-

Championships. The duo holds the No. 4 seed in the doubles
draw, and both received at-large bids in the singles draw.
seeded two-time national champi
on Steve Johnson of USC.
"I feel prepared and excited to
start the individual portion of my
final NCAAs," Klahn said. "I had
two matches against top-five guys
in the team portion of the event...
and those two matches helped
sharpen my game for the individual
tournament."
Klahn will in fact repeat the sin
gles component of the Virginia
matchup in the first round, facing
the Cavaliers' No. 4 seed, Jarmere
Jenkins, on Wednesday for the sec
ond time in four days. Their match
on Sunday was abandoned with
Jenkins a set ahead.
"It is obviously a very deep field
this year, and I can't look further
than my first match against [Jenk
ins] ," Klahn said. "I've always taken
a step-by-step approach to tourna
ments like the NCAAs, and this
week is no different. I feel confident
in my health and in my game, and
that's the most important thing for
me right now."
Meanwhile, Thacher will look to
replicate the form that saw him
lead the Cardinal lineup for the first

part of the season in Klahn's ab
sence and attain a 22-13 overall
record. Thacher will face Texas
Tech's Gonzalo Escobar in the first
round.
As a doubles pairing, Klahn and
Thacher have been a remarkably
successful team, collecting eight
doubles titles together throughout
their careers. The NCAA doubles
title has thus far proved elusive,
however, with the pair falling to
Texas A&M in a tightly contested
final last year.
Klahn downplayed the sugges
tion that the lack of playing time
the two have recorded together
during the season might hurt their
chances as they prepare to take on
Andre Dome and Matt Fawcett of
Cal Poly in the first round.
"Ryan and I have been playing
doubles together for over three
years now, so I am not worried
about any rust in our partnership,"
Klahn said. "We haven't lost any
recognition of each other's tenden
cies and have been able to get some
practice in as a doubles team the
last few days."
For both Klahn and Thacher, the
upcoming week offers the chance
to finish their already-sterling Stan
ford careers on a high note, after ac
quiring numerous individual hon
ors and leading the Cardinal to two
straight NCAA quarterfinals.

"It's a difficult feeling to know
that this is my last college tourna
ment ever" Klahn said. "I have
been lucky to play at such an in
credible university, and college ten
nis has provided me with memories
that will stick with me forever.
"I won't approach this tourna
ment any differently because it is
my last one," Klahn added. "I will
still go out and enjoy the moment
and compete like I always do, and
be determined to leave college ten
nis on a high note."
Klahn downplayed the psycho
logical impact of the Cardinal's exit
from the team tournament against
the Cavaliers, claiming that the
match experience had instead
helped him and Thacher prepare
for the individual competitions.
"What has happened in the
team event is in the past," Klahn
said. "Yes, it is difficult for me to
look back and know that I will
never play a dual match again, but
at the same time I am lucky to have
an opportunity waiting right
around the corner to try and win
another national championship."
Both Klahn and Thacher will
play their first-round singles action
today, before starting doubles play
tomorrow.
