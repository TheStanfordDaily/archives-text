## ARP debate continues in Senate Law prof offers analysis of the Dear Colleague Letter 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate heard a two-hour series of opin
ions Tuesday from individuals in
volved with the debate on the Al
ternative Review Process (ARP),
Stanford's judicial procedure for
cases involving sexual assault, rela
tionship violence, sexual harass
ment and stalking. Except for the
regular funding bills, which passed
unanimously, the senators did not
pass any new legislation or present
a revised budget for the upcoming
fiscal year, following rejection of
the proposed budget by the Gradu
ate Student Council (GSC).
The senators had invited sever
al involved students, faculty mem
bers and Judicial Affairs members
to speak about the ARP to aid the
senators in better understanding
the involved issues.
Professor Michael McConnell,
law professor and fellow at the
Hoover Institute, explained his in
terpretation of the Office of Civil
Rights' Dear Colleague Letter
(DCL), the document that caused
Stanford President John Hennessy
to unilaterally lower the standard
of proof from beyond a reasonable
doubt to preponderance of evi
dence in April 2011. McConnell
said that the American Association
of University Professors opposes a
burden of preponderance of evi
dence and endorses a clear and
convincing standard. He added
that both civil rights organizations
and the federal government are
currently debating the DCL's legal
status.
"Nothing is written in stone,"
McConnell said. He told the sena
tors that, because the ARP is cur
rently in compliance with the DCL,
they should be in no rush to ap
prove the procedure.
He also expressed worry about
a general diminution of the rights
of the accused.
"The thing about the ARP is
that it isn't just one change," he ex
plained. "Any one individual aspect
of it may actually be quite justifi
able. But it is rather a cascade of
changes, every one of which makes
it more difficult for an innocent
person to [defend themselves]."
In a similar vein, K.C. Johnson, a
professor of history at Brooklyn
College, expressed over Skype his
concern for the protections taken
out of the ARP and cited a preva
lence of false accusations.
Max Sosna-Spear 'l2, who
serves on ARP review panels,
countered Johnson and Mc-
Connell's explanation and defend
ed the procedure's existing provi
sions, including the panel size and
majority voting requirement. He
also argued that the prevalence of
false accusations is much lower
than Johnson posited.
"Certainly we increase the risk
of false findings of responsibility,"
Sosna-Spear said, "but precisely
