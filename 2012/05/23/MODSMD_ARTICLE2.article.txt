## ARP debate continues in Senate Law prof offers analysis of the Dear Colleague Letter 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate heard a two-hour series of opin
ions Tuesday from individuals in
volved with the debate on the Al
ternative Review Process (ARP),
Stanford's judicial procedure for
cases involving sexual assault, rela
tionship violence, sexual harass
ment and stalking. Except for the
regular funding bills, which passed
unanimously, the senators did not
pass any new legislation or present
a revised budget for the upcoming
fiscal year, following rejection of
the proposed budget by the Gradu
ate Student Council (GSC).
The senators had invited sever
al involved students, faculty mem
bers and Judicial Affairs members
to speak about the ARP to aid the
senators in better understanding
the involved issues.
Professor Michael McConnell,
law professor and fellow at the
Hoover Institute, explained his in
terpretation of the Office of Civil
Rights' Dear Colleague Letter
(DCL), the document that caused
Stanford President John Hennessy
to unilaterally lower the standard
of proof from beyond a reasonable
doubt to preponderance of evi
dence in April 2011. McConnell
said that the American Association
of University Professors opposes a
burden of preponderance of evi
dence and endorses a clear and
convincing standard. He added
that both civil rights organizations
and the federal government are
currently debating the DCL's legal
status.
"Nothing is written in stone,"
McConnell said. He told the sena
tors that, because the ARP is cur
rently in compliance with the DCL,
they should be in no rush to ap
prove the procedure.
He also expressed worry about
a general diminution of the rights
of the accused.
"The thing about the ARP is
that it isn't just one change," he ex
plained. "Any one individual aspect
of it may actually be quite justifi
able. But it is rather a cascade of
changes, every one of which makes
it more difficult for an innocent
person to [defend themselves]."
In a similar vein, K.C. Johnson, a
professor of history at Brooklyn
College, expressed over Skype his
concern for the protections taken
out of the ARP and cited a preva
lence of false accusations.
Max Sosna-Spear 'l2, who
serves on ARP review panels,
countered Johnson and Mc-
Connell's explanation and defend
ed the procedure's existing provi
sions, including the panel size and
majority voting requirement. He
also argued that the prevalence of
false accusations is much lower
than Johnson posited.
"Certainly we increase the risk
of false findings of responsibility,"
Sosna-Spear said, "but precisely
the point is that we are trying to
shift the balance. Even with the
ARP process, there are lots of peo
ple [who] aren't coming forward.
So I think there has to be some ...
weighing the likelihood of false re
sponsibility and the very important
interest of keeping this a safe com
munity for all people."
"As it stands, I think the Univer
sity is suffering far more from unre
ported offenders than from inno
cent people who are being expelled
from the University," he added.
Refuting Sosna-Spear's claim

that responding students in the
ARP almost always concede the
facts but argue that their actions
were not criminal, Timothy Lau
J.D. 'l2, a member of the Board of
Judicial Affairs, reminded the sena
tors of the possibility of misidenti
fication and urged them to increase
the voting requirement in order to
compensate for the low burden of
proof.
"The ARP process doesn't just
cover sexual assault; it covers sexu
al assault, sexual harassment, rela
tionship violence and stalking," he
said. "To say that no misidentifica
tion is ever going to happen ... I
think you're all making a stretch,
and you are subjecting people to
unfair accusations ... If you do [ig
nore the problem of misidentifica

tion], are you really committed to
the presumption of innocence?"
Elliott Wolf J.D. 'l3, who served
as president of the Duke student
body immediately following the
2006 lacrosse team scandal,
warned senators of the impact of
what he termed the "student affairs
industry" on processes such as the
ARP.
Sosna-Spear said that he be
lieves that all of the administrators
involved in the ARP, excluding
some faculty members who serve
on panels, were trained in student
affairs.
Reporting on his experience at
Duke, Wolf said he found that a
concentration of faculty members
who saw themselves as educators
rather than adjudicators led to in-

creased bias, more false rulings and
greater undeserved impact on stu
dent lives.
"Every school below the U.S.
News top 10 is now infested with
professional staff with master's de
grees in 'student personnel admin
istration,'" Wolf said. "And sadly,
they are more interested in foster
ing 'teachable moments' with stu
dents than in dispassionately find

ing facts and meting out sanctions
to serve as a deterrent."
"There aren't two sides to this;
there are many sides," Senator Sha
hab Fadavi 'l5 said at the meeting's
commencement, reminding his
peers to develop a nuanced under
standing of the ARP. Although sev
eral senators asked questions
about various aspects of the ARP,
there was no discussion among
them at the meeting.
Garima Sharma 'l5 said that
the Senate is planning to delay the
approval of the ARP until fall
quarter, which is when the proce
dure will be reviewed by the Facul
ty Senate.
