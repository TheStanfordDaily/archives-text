# Ross reflects on strategies for peace
## Middle East advisor recommends route forward for Israel-Palestine in moment of global inattention 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
Ambassador Dennis Ross, a
prominent Middle East adviser to
Presidents Obama, Clinton and
George H. W. Bush, affirmed his
belief Tuesday night in CEMEX
Auditorium that Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
threats to attack Iran if an agree
ment on nuclear weapons is not
reached are sincere.
"I don't think he's bluffing," he
said in response to an audience
member's question. "Netanyahu
defines his role as prime minister
as protecting Israelis and protect
ing Jewish people this is a part
of his self-definition."
"If he believes Iran will cross
the threshold, I do believe he will
act," he added. The statement was
made following his presentation,
which was attended by more than
400 people.
Marty Zack 'l4, president of

the Stanford Israel Alliance
(SIA), introduced Ross as "one of
our country's leading champions
in Middle East peace," noting "he
has dedicated almost his entire
career to the cause."
Ross was appointed Middle
East envoy under President Clin
ton and was heavily involved in
the peace negotiations of the
1990s between Israel and Pales
tine. During this time, he helped
broker the 1995 Interim Agree
ment and the 1997 Hebron Ac
cord.
In 2009, he was appointed spe
cial advisor for the Persian Gulf
and Southwest Asia to U.S. Secre
tary of State Hillary Clinton. He
left the post the same year to join
the National Security Council
staff as senior director for the
central region and special assis
tant to the president. Ross
stepped down from the position
