# Ross reflects on strategies for peace
## Middle East advisor recommends route forward for Israel-Palestine in moment of global inattention 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
Ambassador Dennis Ross, a
prominent Middle East adviser to
Presidents Obama, Clinton and
George H. W. Bush, affirmed his
belief Tuesday night in CEMEX
Auditorium that Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
threats to attack Iran if an agree
ment on nuclear weapons is not
reached are sincere.
"I don't think he's bluffing," he
said in response to an audience
member's question. "Netanyahu
defines his role as prime minister
as protecting Israelis and protect
ing Jewish people this is a part
of his self-definition."
"If he believes Iran will cross
the threshold, I do believe he will
act," he added. The statement was
made following his presentation,
which was attended by more than
400 people.
Marty Zack 'l4, president of

the Stanford Israel Alliance
(SIA), introduced Ross as "one of
our country's leading champions
in Middle East peace," noting "he
has dedicated almost his entire
career to the cause."
Ross was appointed Middle
East envoy under President Clin
ton and was heavily involved in
the peace negotiations of the
1990s between Israel and Pales
tine. During this time, he helped
broker the 1995 Interim Agree
ment and the 1997 Hebron Ac
cord.
In 2009, he was appointed spe
cial advisor for the Persian Gulf
and Southwest Asia to U.S. Secre
tary of State Hillary Clinton. He
left the post the same year to join
the National Security Council
staff as senior director for the
central region and special assis
tant to the president. Ross
stepped down from the position

and Palestinian stakeholders can adjust to more toward peace.
last November.
"I want to look conceptually
and historically at the whole ap
proach to peace and conclude
with a new model," Ross said.
He traced peace efforts from
the 1970s to the 1993 Oslo Ac
cords, giving examples of various
approaches, including Kissinger's
"incremental" approach and the
Carter administration's opposing
"comprehensive" approach.
"People describe me as some
one who believes in 'incremental
ism,' but my approach is you do
what the context permits you to
do," Ross said.
"Statecraft is about marrying
objectives and means," he added.
"If context isn't right, you have to
find away to change the con
text."
Based on this idea, Ross ar
gued that a new approach and
model is needed for the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict because the
current context for conflict is not
conducive to negotiating peace.
"I offer a hybrid model," he
said. "There needs to be a politi
cal process, but there needs to be
something done from the ground
up as well."
Citing polls that show that the
majority of Israelis and Palestini
ans support a two-state solution
but express doubt about its possi
bility, Ross argued that peace
cannot be achieved if the majori
ty of each side thinks the other is
not serious about a two-state so
lution.
"One of the reasons why both
publics don't believe in it [the
possibility of resolving the con
flict] is that they've seen this
movie before," Ross said, refer
ring to prolonged negotiations
throughout the 1990s that yield
ed no significant results.
Offering steps on both sides to
break through the impasse, Ross
suggested that the United States
could help broker negotiations.
On the Israeli side, Ross pro
posed several measures including
reducing the level of Israeli con
trol in the West Bank territories,
providing more economic oppor
tunities for Palestinians, recog
nize Palestinians who take a non
violent approach and adopting
legislation to offer compensation
for settlers who voluntarily move
out of the West Bank.
On the Palestinian side, Ross
listed steps including halting in

citement, condemning violence,
including Israel in maps in Pales
tinian textbooks and institution
building.
According to Ross, following
these steps "will cause both sides
to take a second look and change
the dynamics of political negotia
tions."
Ross pointed out that the
world's attention is currently fo
cused on "everything but the
peace issue between Israelis and
Palestinians. It has not gone away
and it won't go away."
However, he said he views this
moment as an opportunity to
push for progress in negotiations
between the Israelis and the
Palestinians.
"The Arab countries are all fo
cused internally right now," he
said. "Both the Israelis and Pales
tinians have the space to do some
thing. It is in this moment, when
no one is paying attention, that
we should and they should act."
Following the talk, former
Middle East bureau chief for the
Washington Post and communi
cation professor Janine Zacharia
joined Ross on stage for a ques
tion-and-answer session.
Ross dismissed the notion that
the current administration is fo
cused on Iran and ignoring the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict.
"The problem of Iran and the
emergence of nuclear weapons
weighs very heavily," he said.
"The administration is active be
hind the scenes [on the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict] and ap
proaching it in a low-profile way."
He also expressed optimism
on the progress of negotiations
with Iran, crediting increased
pressure from the United States
for improving the situation.
"I don't expect there to be a
breakthrough tomorrow, but I
don't think we have the luxury of
approaching talks like we have
all the time in the world," he said.
"There needs to be a sense of ur
gency."
Moving to the topic of Syria,
Ross highlighted a need to en
gage Russia in efforts to oust cur
rent Syrian President Bashar al-
Assad. Ross stated his support
for a safe haven for the dictator
on the Syrian-Turkish border.
In response to a challenge
from audience members of his
definition of Palestinian identity,
Ross said, "You cannot deny
Palestinian national identity. We
cannot make peace if we do not
recognize the Palestinians."

"I don't think he's bluffing," he
said in response to an audience
member's question. "Netanyahu
defines his role as prime minister
as protecting Israelis and protect
ing Jewish people this is a part

"If he believes Iran will cross

Marty Zack 'l4, president of

in Middle East peace," noting "he
has dedicated almost his entire
career to the cause."
Ross was appointed Middle
East envoy under President Clin
ton and was heavily involved in
the peace negotiations of the
1990s between Israel and Pales
tine. During this time, he helped
broker the 1995 Interim Agree
ment and the 1997 Hebron Ac
cord.
In 2009, he was appointed spe
cial advisor for the Persian Gulf
and Southwest Asia to U.S. Secre

the National Security Council
staff as senior director for the

and Palestinian stakeholders can adjust to more toward peace.
last November.
"I want to look conceptually
and historically at the whole ap
proach to peace and conclude
with a new model," Ross said.
He traced peace efforts from
the 1970s to the 1993 Oslo Ac
cords, giving examples of various
approaches, including Kissinger's
"incremental" approach and the
Carter administration's opposing
"comprehensive" approach.
"People describe me as some
one who believes in 'incremental
ism,' but my approach is you do
what the context permits you to
do," Ross said.
"Statecraft is about marrying
objectives and means," he added.
"If context isn't right, you have to
find away to change the con
text."
Based on this idea, Ross ar
gued that a new approach and
model is needed for the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict because the
current context for conflict is not
conducive to negotiating peace.
"I offer a hybrid model," he
said. "There needs to be a politi
cal process, but there needs to be
something done from the ground
up as well."
Citing polls that show that the
majority of Israelis and Palestini
ans support a two-state solution
but express doubt about its possi
bility, Ross argued that peace
cannot be achieved if the majori
ty of each side thinks the other is
not serious about a two-state so
lution.
"One of the reasons why both
publics don't believe in it [the
possibility of resolving the con
flict] is that they've seen this
movie before," Ross said, refer
ring to prolonged negotiations
throughout the 1990s that yield
ed no significant results.
Offering steps on both sides to
break through the impasse, Ross
suggested that the United States
could help broker negotiations.
On the Israeli side, Ross pro
posed several measures including
reducing the level of Israeli con
trol in the West Bank territories,
providing more economic oppor
tunities for Palestinians, recog
nize Palestinians who take a non
violent approach and adopting
legislation to offer compensation
for settlers who voluntarily move
out of the West Bank.
On the Palestinian side, Ross
listed steps including halting in

citement, condemning violence,
including Israel in maps in Pales
tinian textbooks and institution
building.
According to Ross, following
these steps "will cause both sides
to take a second look and change
the dynamics of political negotia
tions."
Ross pointed out that the
world's attention is currently fo
cused on "everything but the
peace issue between Israelis and
Palestinians. It has not gone away
and it won't go away."
However, he said he views this
moment as an opportunity to
push for progress in negotiations
between the Israelis and the
Palestinians.
"The Arab countries are all fo
cused internally right now," he
said. "Both the Israelis and Pales
tinians have the space to do some
thing. It is in this moment, when
no one is paying attention, that
we should and they should act."
Following the talk, former
Middle East bureau chief for the
Washington Post and communi
cation professor Janine Zacharia
joined Ross on stage for a ques
tion-and-answer session.
Ross dismissed the notion that
the current administration is fo
cused on Iran and ignoring the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict.
"The problem of Iran and the
emergence of nuclear weapons
weighs very heavily," he said.
"The administration is active be
hind the scenes [on the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict] and ap
proaching it in a low-profile way."
He also expressed optimism
on the progress of negotiations
with Iran, crediting increased
pressure from the United States
for improving the situation.
"I don't expect there to be a
breakthrough tomorrow, but I
don't think we have the luxury of
approaching talks like we have
all the time in the world," he said.
"There needs to be a sense of ur
gency."
Moving to the topic of Syria,
Ross highlighted a need to en
gage Russia in efforts to oust cur
rent Syrian President Bashar al-
Assad. Ross stated his support
for a safe haven for the dictator
on the Syrian-Turkish border.
In response to a challenge
from audience members of his
definition of Palestinian identity,
Ross said, "You cannot deny
Palestinian national identity. We
cannot make peace if we do not
recognize the Palestinians."
