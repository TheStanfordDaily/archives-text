## Law School seeks student views on new dean Law students hope replacement dean will match responsiveness to students 
### ANTONIO RAMIREZ 
At a Tuesday town hall meeting, law stu
dents were given an opportunity to engage
and question the search committee that will
recommend a list of candidates to the presi
dent and provost to replace Stanford Law
School Dean Larry Kramer.
Kramer announced in March that he will
step down from his post to serve as president

of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
"Of the great qualities I've seen in Dean
Kramer in the past three years I've been here,
I think one of those is his responsiveness to
students," said Teddy Kider J.D. 'l2, co-presi
dent of the Stanford Law Association and
member of the dean selection committee.
"The fact that there is someone at the top of
the administration who I do think cares about
students is important in a big way."
The current list of candidates for the posi
tion will be kept completely confidential until
a new dean has been selected, as away to en
sure that certain candidates will consider run

ning for the position.
The committee expects to present any
where from three to five candidates to Uni
versity President John Hennessy and Provost
John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2. To select this list
of candidates, the committee began holding
meetings with the public two weeks ago.
Around 50 students attended Tuesday's
town hall meeting, presenting a number of
questions that led Law School Vice Dean
Mark Kelman to describe students' opinions
as ranging from "valuable reinforcement of
information" to assessments that
he "didn't see coming."
One of the qualities that stu
dents consistently identified as an
important trait in the future dean
was continued responsiveness to
students as previously demon
strated by Kramer.
As part of Kramer's willing
ness to engage with students, he
has held periodic town hall meet
ings open to all and has commit
ted himself to teaching classes
and participating in school musi
cals every year.
"I would agree that one of
Dean Kramer's biggest assets
from a student's perspective is
that he is responsive to all stu
dents, especially students that he
doesn't necessarily agree with,"
said Barbara Smith J.D. 'l2. "He is
still just as supportive with them
as he is with anyone else."
Kramer has led a number of
initiatives, including switching the
law school's academic calendar
from the semester system to the
quarter system.
"Although we wish the law
school rankings didn't mean any
thing, they do," Smith said. "It's
important to find someone who's
sensitive to that and who is going
to continue the great trend that
Dean Kramer has started."
Students also voiced concerns
about the impression that Stan
ford Law School may be "a little
California-centric."
"It is unfortunate because
we're the second best law school
in the country and we don't have

more connections to places like
Washington, D.C., and New
York," Smith said. "There's cer
tainly no discouraging of students
who want to go to those types of
places, but I've found that the
search has been a little self-direct
ed."
"It would be wonderful to
have more East Coast, and even
Midwest, sensitivity to what Stan
ford has," she added.

One of Dean
Kramer's biggest
assets... is that he
is responsive to
all students.
