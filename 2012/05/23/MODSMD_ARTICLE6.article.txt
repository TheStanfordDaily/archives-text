## Santa Clara County Board delays vote until August 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Mary Ann Toman-Miller 
The Santa Clara County Board of Supervi
sors decided Tuesday to push back voting on
two proposals that would have dipped into a
fund the University created in 2001 under
agreement with its General Use Permit. The
board will take up the issue again in August.
The two projects in question include a pro
posed pedestrian and bike bridge over High
way 101 and the completion of a Bay Trail link.
These projects would cost $5 million and $3
million, respectively.

The fund of $10.37 million was established
to counter the reduction of recreation space
that resulted from Stanford's 5-million-square
foot expansion.
Stanford Campus Residential Leasehold
ers (SCRL) claim that these projects would
not benefit Stanford households and would
be a misuse of the funds, according to an arti
cle in the San Jose Mercury News.
"The two proposed projects would not
mitigate the adverse effect," wrote James
Sweeney, president of the SCRL board, in a
letter to the board on Sunday.
"Thus spending these funds for these proj
ects would be a breach of the contract and an
inappropriate diversion of funds that were to
be used only as a mitigation specific to campus
residents and facilities users, not meant as a

general mitigation to the entire region," the
letter continued.
Different proposals for the use of the fund,
such as improving a trail around Alpine Road,
have been presented and rejected over the
past year.
Meanwhile, proponents of the proposal
such as Conine Winter, president and director
of the Committee for Green Foothills and the
Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition have urged
board members to examine the advantages she
predicts the projects would have for those liv
ing in the surrounding areas.
"The proposed projects will serve a far
greater number of people and keep the whole
area healthy and active," Winter said in an ar
ticle in the San Jose Mercury News.
