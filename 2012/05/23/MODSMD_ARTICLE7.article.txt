# Researchers identify gene predicting smoking habits

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Mary Ann Toman-Miller 
Researchers have discovered a gene
closely linked to how much African Ameri
cans smoke, according to a School of Medi
cine press release.
"Knowing that this gene is important in
different ancestral groups ... suggests it as
a target for drug discovery and develop
ment," said Sean David, clinical associate
professor of medicine at Stanford, in the
press release.
David was a co-leader of the
study, which collaborated with
more than 75 researchers across
the United States. Drawing data
from more than 32,000 African
Americans, researchers concluded
that the gene CHRNAS is statisti
cally relevant in predicting smok
ing behavior. Researchers previ
ously found that the same gene is
relevant in predicting smoking be
havior of people with European
ancestry.
The study, however, found that
the genetic marker correlated with
smoking behaviors is in a different
place on the gene depending on
one's ethnicity.
According to David, it is crucial
to understand how nicotine recep
tors vary across ethnicities be
cause African Americans statisti
cally have a higher risk of develop
ing lung cancer, despite beginning
to smoke later in life than other
ethnic groups.
Researchers also discovered a
genetic marker that closely pre
dicts number of cigarettes smoked
per day.
Stanford contributed 8,208 par
ticipants to the study, called the
Study of Tobacco in Minority Pop
ulations, or STOMP.
The National Institute on Drug
Abuse and the National Institute
of General Medicine Sciences
funded the study, which was pub
lished Tuesday in Translational
Psychiatry.
