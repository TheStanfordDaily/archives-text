## ONLINE PLATFORM FUNDS CREATIVE PROJECTS KICK-STARTING TO SUCCESS 
### AARON SEKHRI STAFF WRITER 
When Thomas Pauly 'l2 and
Rebecca Hecht 'l2 needed
funding for their senior
project, a theatrical pro
duction titled "The Ones
Left Behind," they took an unconventional
approach to raising the funds. After receiv
ing a generous but insufficient Angel Grant
a $3,000 grant provided by Undergradu
ate Advising and Research (UAR) to assist
students in producing public creative works
the pair created a project on Kickstarter,
a popular "crowd-funding" platform that
allows individuals to seek funding for cre
ative projects.
Although the company was founded in
2009 by Perry Chen, Yancey Strickler and
Charles Adler, the Kickstarter concept
had been in Chen's mind since 2002, when
he backed out of hosting a concert at the
New Orleans Jazz Fest because of the fi
nancial risk. After conversations with the
others, a philosophy emerged that the
service would target artists and entrepre
neurs who do not have traditional access
to financing or publicity.
Kickstarter representatives, following
current company policy, declined to com
ment for this article.
The mechanics of the website are sim
ple, defined by two words: "creative" and
"project." Creativity on Kickstarter is less a
descriptor and more a prerequisite. The va
riety of Kickstarter projects is vast, with en
deavors ranging from filmmaking to design
to manufacturing. The finite quality of a
creative project is crucial to Kickstarter's
standards.
"A project is something finite with a
clear beginning and end," reads the Kick
starter website. "Someone can be held ac
countable to the framework of a project
a project was either completed or it wasn't
and there are definable expectations
that everyone can agree to."
Each project must have a defined
fundraising aim, an allotted time span and
rewards for users who pledge money to the
project. Projects also must not violate Kick
starter guidelines, such as straying from
Kickstarter's defined categories. As of May
2012, over $175 million has been raised on
the website. On May 18, a Palo Alto-based
project Pebble, which is developing a
smartwatch that wirelessly connects to
smartphones to alert the wearer of mes
sages and calls, closed a round of fundrais
ing that exceeded $10,000,000 in backing,
despite a goal of only $lOO,OOO.
The platform is designed for specific and
finite projects, and diminishes risk for both
investors and the producers. Unless the
total is reached, no money changes hands. If
a fundraising total is raised, the group be
hind the project does not need to commit
any of its own money. This presents an ideal
situation for those without traditional ac
cess to finance or investment capital
particularly students.
Tom Cohlmia M.S. 'l3, a student in the

Stanford Design Program, took advantage
of Kickstarter for his final assignment as
part of a Hasso Plattner Institute of Design
(d.school) class, Story Viz. His unique sculp
ture designs, which make use of etched
crystal fragments, are part of a project he
has been developing since high school. The
designs proved a perfect product to market
on the website and Cohlmia reached his
total in a matter of days, ultimately raising
$15,000 more than four times his goal.
Cohlmia's project marks an expansion
of the types of projects Kickstarter first
hosted, projects such as music performanc
es, art pieces and independent films.
"I honestly think that Kickstarter is
most compelling for things, tangible
things," Cohlmia said. "Kickstarter forces
you to prove your ability to do something,
and so when you have a video showing
what you can do and you're just asking for
money to make more of the thing, it's much
more compelling."
Cohlmia went on to challenge the no
tion that Kickstarter is a democratized plat

form, where everybody has an equal shot at
fundraising, or that good products will
achieve their fundraising totals regardless
of their marketing and presentation efforts.
"Kickstarter is just a smaller scale of the
real world," Cohlmia said. "Salesmanship,
timing, the quality of your video, are all just
like if you were selling the product conven
tionally." His advice for aspirant "Kick
starters" is to demonstrate "a combination
of technical expertise with a compelling
story behind the product."
Rahul Bhagat, head of operations at
Pebble, also gave his thoughts on how to es
tablish a quality campaign salient advice
coming from the organizers of the most
successful Kickstarter project to date.
"One of the keys we found was to con
vey use cases through the video," Bhagat
wrote in an email to The Daily. "Sure, the
technology is interesting but most people
just want to know how the device or service
will fit into their day to day lives."
Interestingly enough, Pebble saw Kick
starter as "a plan B ... after having had

limited success with the traditional venture
capital route." The fallback route turned
out far more successful.
"[The platform] gives you knowledge of
how many people are interested in your
product, feedback from potential con
sumers and raises capital without giving
away equity," Bhagat said.
The first of Pebble's watches will debut
in September. Given the success of funding
projects involving the development of
hardware projects different from the
more traditional artistic projects that Kick
starter initially intended to support
Kickstarter may prove more useful to par
ties interested in funding hardware devel
opment.
"It's clear that the platform has the po
tential to support massive hardware and
software projects," Bhagat said. "It is up to
the folks at Kickstarter to decide if they want
to continue to support these avenues."
