## SEEING GREEN Finding my religion 
### Holly Moeller 
CHERRY HILL, NJ. Stand
ing next to my dad under
the watchful eyes of the
sculpted Jesus I remembered well
from childhood church services, I
resolutely censored a mental
curse, I hadn't attended Catholic
Mass regularly in years, and while
I was embarrassed by my stum
bling responses to some recently
reworded portions of the service, I
was still absolutely certain of pro
fanity's sacrilege during this par
ticular Sunday hour.
Whenever I'm home for a visit,
I'm reminded of religion's forma
tive importance during a child
hood that included attending
weekly Mass and religion classes,
singing in the children's choir,
and, later, lectoring during servic
es.
Although my parents are very
spiritual people, both are scien
tists by training and liberals by na
ture. Their beliefs often diverged
from the Church's teachings when
reason suggested a more logical
alternative. Perhaps because my
dad is Lutheran, I never believed
the Pope was infallible. As a fami
ly, we agreed that the Church
shouldn't refuse to distribute con
doms that could slow the spread
of AIDS in Africa. And my moth
er always bit back the urge to con
front the anti-abortion campaign
ers that periodically fundraised
after Sunday services.
For the most part, though, I
identified myself as a Catholic.
That is, until I became acutely
aware of the role of conservative
Christianity in politics. Could I,
now a young adult, stand with a
religion whose conservative social
tenets I more often rejected than
accepted?
Probably not. And after leav
ing home for college, I found my
self drifting farther and farther
away from religious practice.
If anything, though, my spiritu
ality grew stronger. I worked for a
summer in the Pacific Northwest,
finding new cathedrals atop gla
ciers and amid towering Sitka
Spruce. I frequented New Jersey's
cedar swamps and winter coast
line when I needed a quiet respite
to gain perspective. I realized that,
whatever I might believe about
the existence of God or the Tight
ness of any one religion, the works
of evolution would always inspire
my sense of awe, leaving me with
a sense of being encompassed, ab
sorbed, by something mysterious,
something greater than myself.
Simultaneously, I learned
about the myriad threats human
activity poses to the natural
world. Some threats, like the pro
duction of smog or poisoning of
waterways, are obvious, and have
been to some extent controlled.
Others, though, are longer-term
and therefore harder to detect
and address. And it's these prob
lems like climate change,
ocean acidification and nutrient
pollution that will be left in the
hands of our generation.
Back in the 19605, a scientist
named Lynn White argued that, in
part, our penchant for environ
mental degradation stemmed
from a sense of entitlement pro
moted by the very religions that
shaped the Western world and
shaped my own childhood. Chris
tianity and its sister monotheistic
religions set humankind apart
from the rest of Creation, White
wrote, authorizing us to exploit

any and all of the Earth's re
sources that could be useful to us.
In away, even traditional de
scriptions of environmental issues
as negative human impacts on
a world that is most "natural" in
our absence promote this di
chotomy. And by seeing ourselves
as separate from the natural
world, we both lose sight of the
very natural biological drivers be
hind our behavior, and distance
ourselves from the idea of living
"in tune" with nature.
Perhaps, though, there may be
something to that old Christian
separation between man and
beast. Biology is full of examples
E. coli on the Petri dish; lem
mings on the tundra in which
organisms over-exploit their re
sources, leading to catastrophic
population crashes. Depending
on your reading of the data, hu
manity is on the brink of, or is al
ready, exceeding sustainable con
sumption rates, though we have
yet to hit our catastrophic break
ing point. If being human means
circumventing that crash by
choosing to scale back before we
reach the point of no return, then
I'm happy to draw the line be
tween humans and "beasts."
So, too, are a growing number
of Christian environmentalists.
Sometimes led by local leaders
like pastors and bishops, some
times organized into national
campaigns like the Evangelical
Environmental Network, even
members of the otherwise ultra
conservative Religious Right are
citing biblical passages in which
God charges humanity with stew
ardship over the planet. And the
Christian Bible is certainly not the
only holy text to carry such a call.
As religious groups increasing
ly partner with environmental ac
tivists to call for action on climate
change, biodiversity loss and
other global issues, I can't help but
fantasize about a day when all 2.2
billion Christians take up their
God-given mantle to protect the
Earth. Not only could such a glob
al phenomenon transform our
hopes and fears about the future,
but for me, it could also bring a re
union, on new ground, with a fam
ily from which I've long been es
tranged.

After leaving for
college, I found
myself drifting
away from
religion.
