# MODERN MANNERS
## Does Thinking Matters matter? 
### Jeff Mandell 
You've probably heard that
Introduction to the Hu
manities is being replaced
by a one-quarter requirement
called Thinking Matters. In a prior
Daily article, IHUM chair Russell
Berman was quoted as saying that
the new program is intended to
help students transition "from high
school thinking to college think
ing." Another major goal of the
overhaul is to give freshmen more
space in their schedules to explore
different academic areas, as the re
quirement will be completed in
one quarter rather than the three
quarters it takes to finish IHUM. It
has also been generally admitted
that some students intensely dis
like IHUM, and of course every
one hopes that Thinking Matters
will be more popular.
The phrase "Thinking Mat
ters" could be read as "matters
about which to think," but I as
sume most people will read "Mat
ters" as a verb. The implicit mes
sage to incoming students will be

that this class is designed to teach
them that thinking is important.
Wait a second isn't that a little
condescending? Does anyone be
lieve the fact that thinking mat
ters is news to Stanford students?
The people who become Stan
ford undergraduates start out as
some of the most academically
elite high school students in the
world. Every year, the number of
applications rises and the admit
rate drops a little lower, making it
ever harder to impress an admis
sions committee that is used to
seeing perfect grades, near-per
fect test scores, and significant
Advanced Placement coursework
from its applicants. More and
more freshmen are coming in hav
ing already done college-like re
search projects, whether by work
ing in biology labs or pouring
through historical archives. Isn't it
condescending to introduce these
people to college with a course ti
tled "Thinking Matters," as if they
don't already know that? If Stan

ford admits know one thing, it's
that thinking has mattered a lot in
their lives. There are few groups in
the country that are less in need of
hearing this message.
I really do not mean to attack
anyone with this column. I don't
know how Thinking Matters got
its name, but I'm sure that no one
intended the name to disrespect
the abilities and accomplishments
of incoming freshmen. It's not
easy to come up with a name to tie
together a broad general educa
tion requirement that can be ful
filled with a variety of seemingly
unrelated courses, and I personal
ly haven't been able to think of an
other name. I just hope decision
makers will think more about the
connotations of the current title
because I want Thinking Matters
to succeed. When a requirement
has a patronizing name, it is asking
to be disliked, regardless of the
value of the course material.
In an absolute sense, future
freshmen are almost guaranteed
to like Thinking Matters more
than their predecessors liked
IHUM, because they will be tak
ing it for just one quarter instead
of three. But will they truly enjoy
Thinking Matters? After all, it is
possible to be educated without
enjoying it. The goal of general
education requirements is not to
force students to memorize any
specific body of knowledge, but
rather to encourage critical
thought. For students to experi
ence intellectual growth in Think
ing Matters, they will have to en
gage with the material and be in
spired by it, which means they will
have to like it. If the requirement
is instead subject to general deri
sion, then the few who choose to
engage in class will likely suffer a
"Thinking Matters kid" stigma. In
my opinion, students would feel
freer to get excited about the ma
terial if the course had a more in
tellectually serious title. For
Thinking Matters to matter, it
might need a new name.
