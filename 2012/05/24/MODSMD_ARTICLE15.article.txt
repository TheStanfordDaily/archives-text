## LEAVING A LEGACY 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Seven NCAA titles. 72 NCAA individ
ual champions. A 243-40 overall regular
season record. 31 consecutive Pac-10/Pac
-12 championships in one of the most com
petitive and talent-filled conferences in the
nation.
The list goes on.
Most collegiate swim programs have
never come close to reaching these record
breaking heights. These kinds of achieve
ments could take an elite program more
than a century to earn. But the Stanford
men's swimming and diving program has
amassed these prestigious accomplish
ments in just the past 33 years.
And all of it has come under the helm of
head coach Skip Kenney.
Last week, Kenney officially announced
his retirement after coaching the Cardinal
for 33 years.
"Thirty-three years, age 70 and an
Olympic year. Three pretty good reasons
for retiring," Kenney said. "The last couple
years were just a little more difficult, so it

was a good warning sign. Now my goal is to
drive Route 66. It's something that people
in my age group either have done or look
forward to doing. So that's my first goal."
Kenney ended his career as a three-time
Olympic Coach, six-time NCAA Coach of
the Year and 20-time Pac-10 Coach of the
Year. The coaching legend was also induct
ed into the International Swimming Hall of
Fame in 2004 and the American Swim
Coaches Hall of Fame shortly the following
year.
But for Kenney, his prestigious career
isn't mainly about the numbers or the acco
lades; it's about the swimmers he's coached
and the relationships that he's built with
them.
"It's been a heck of a run," Kenney said.
"My proudest accomplishment is helping
kids build team chemistry and teaching
them how to contribute. For a team to be
successful it takes a lot of good athletes and
a lot of good leadership from those ath
letes. I think it's hard for a 20-year-old to be
leader on a team because you're among
your peers. It takes someone a lot of confi
dence to handle that. And Stanford is just

an unbelievable place. The guys here made
it easy for me to come to morning practice
and to be enthusiastic about it."
The coach's close relationships with
many of his swimmers have gone far be
yond the pool and even far beyond Stan
ford.
"I have a real respect for [the swimmers
I've coached]," Kenney said. "I respect that
they're Stanford grads and successful in the
business world. They've carried their expe
riences as athletes into the real world."
Given Kenney's reputation as one of the
greatest swim coaches in the world, his
background in the sport is a bit surprising.
"I never swam competitively and I don't
know if I could've," Kenney said. "When I
first started coaching, I went to more clinics
and talks than anyone else. I think a lot of
swim coaches don't hear anything at these
things because they've already heard all of
it. But I was writing down things as fast as I
could and I learned a lot from them."
What Kenney lacked in personal swim
ming experience he made up for with his
other unique experiences that not many
coaches have. Kenney served in the

Marines and was in combat in Vietnam for
over a year, spending four months of his
time as a sniper.
"Leadership," Kenney said. "That's
what I learned from my experience [as a
Marine], In combat, you see things that
make you realize that the human body is
amazing. It can do amazing things if you let
it. That's what I've tried to apply to some of
the guys at Stanford. You can start out as a
walk-on, but end up an Olympian."
Kenney wasn't exactly handed a power
house when he took over in 1979. During
his first stint as head coach, Stanford went
3-6 in the regular season and could only
muster a sixth-place finish at Pac-10's.
"First year at Pac-10's, we didn't win a
single event," Kenney said. "So my goal for
the second year was to just win one event at
Pac-10's. And we won exactly one event. So
I said, 'Well, here we go.'"
That proved to be the only launching
point that the Cardinal needed. In the fol
lowing season, Kenney led the team to a
Pac-10 title along with a third-place finish
