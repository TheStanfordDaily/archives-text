## LEAVING A LEGACY 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Seven NCAA titles. 72 NCAA individ
ual champions. A 243-40 overall regular
season record. 31 consecutive Pac-10/Pac
-12 championships in one of the most com
petitive and talent-filled conferences in the
nation.
The list goes on.
Most collegiate swim programs have
never come close to reaching these record
breaking heights. These kinds of achieve
ments could take an elite program more
than a century to earn. But the Stanford
men's swimming and diving program has
amassed these prestigious accomplish
ments in just the past 33 years.
And all of it has come under the helm of
head coach Skip Kenney.
Last week, Kenney officially announced
his retirement after coaching the Cardinal
for 33 years.
"Thirty-three years, age 70 and an
Olympic year. Three pretty good reasons
for retiring," Kenney said. "The last couple
years were just a little more difficult, so it

was a good warning sign. Now my goal is to
drive Route 66. It's something that people
in my age group either have done or look
forward to doing. So that's my first goal."
Kenney ended his career as a three-time
Olympic Coach, six-time NCAA Coach of
the Year and 20-time Pac-10 Coach of the
Year. The coaching legend was also induct
ed into the International Swimming Hall of
Fame in 2004 and the American Swim
Coaches Hall of Fame shortly the following
year.
But for Kenney, his prestigious career
isn't mainly about the numbers or the acco
lades; it's about the swimmers he's coached
and the relationships that he's built with
them.
"It's been a heck of a run," Kenney said.
"My proudest accomplishment is helping
kids build team chemistry and teaching
them how to contribute. For a team to be
successful it takes a lot of good athletes and
a lot of good leadership from those ath
letes. I think it's hard for a 20-year-old to be
leader on a team because you're among
your peers. It takes someone a lot of confi
dence to handle that. And Stanford is just

an unbelievable place. The guys here made
it easy for me to come to morning practice
and to be enthusiastic about it."
The coach's close relationships with
many of his swimmers have gone far be
yond the pool and even far beyond Stan
ford.
"I have a real respect for [the swimmers
I've coached]," Kenney said. "I respect that
they're Stanford grads and successful in the
business world. They've carried their expe
riences as athletes into the real world."
Given Kenney's reputation as one of the
greatest swim coaches in the world, his
background in the sport is a bit surprising.
"I never swam competitively and I don't
know if I could've," Kenney said. "When I
first started coaching, I went to more clinics
and talks than anyone else. I think a lot of
swim coaches don't hear anything at these
things because they've already heard all of
it. But I was writing down things as fast as I
could and I learned a lot from them."
What Kenney lacked in personal swim
ming experience he made up for with his
other unique experiences that not many
coaches have. Kenney served in the

Marines and was in combat in Vietnam for
over a year, spending four months of his
time as a sniper.
"Leadership," Kenney said. "That's
what I learned from my experience [as a
Marine], In combat, you see things that
make you realize that the human body is
amazing. It can do amazing things if you let
it. That's what I've tried to apply to some of
the guys at Stanford. You can start out as a
walk-on, but end up an Olympian."
Kenney wasn't exactly handed a power
house when he took over in 1979. During
his first stint as head coach, Stanford went
3-6 in the regular season and could only
muster a sixth-place finish at Pac-10's.
"First year at Pac-10's, we didn't win a
single event," Kenney said. "So my goal for
the second year was to just win one event at
Pac-10's. And we won exactly one event. So
I said, 'Well, here we go.'"
That proved to be the only launching
point that the Cardinal needed. In the fol
lowing season, Kenney led the team to a
Pac-10 title along with a third-place finish

at NCAA. Under his steady guid
ance, Stanford would see a na
tional title three-peat twice , from
1984-1987 and 1991-1994. Kenney
won his final NCAA title in the
1997-1998 season, making him re
sponsible for seven of Stanford's
eight national titles.
Kenney will continue coaching
until the 2012 Olympic trials in
July, which means that he will still
hold his annual summer swim
camp for age-group swimmers. Of
the 32 swimmers on the Stanford
team, 31 will be competing at the
Trials, battling for an all-coveted
spot on the U.S. Olympic team.
Despite announcing his retire
ment just a couple months before
the trials, Kenney notes that his
swimmers are still very focused
on preparing for the big meet.
It might be best to understand
Kenney's extraordinary impact
on his swimmers by hearing a
swimmer's perspective. Kenney
shared with The Daily an email he
received from Adam Messner,

who swam for Stanford from
1997-2001 and captained the
team his senior year. Messner fin
ished his impressive collegiate ca
reer as a two-time national cham
pion in the 200 butterfly.
"Your motivational speech be
fore our 1998 NCAA win is some
thing I will always remember,"
wrote Messner. "You spoke about
how all the work was done, how
we needed to take the fight to
Auburn in their backyard. At the
meet and many others, I wanted
to swim through a brick wall for
the team and for you, because you
gave me the confidence that it had
to be done and more importantly,
that I could.
"At times, when I made selfish
or stupid decisions, you would set
me straight on how my decisions
might 'feel good' at the time, but
that the aftermath could affect
the team," Messner continued.
"That type of team-first mentality
is something that makes even
more sense now that I am a Dad
and a business owner. It's still
hard to live by, but I can more
clearly see that being selfish
works for a little while, but you'll
never feel truly fulfilled only
pleasing your self. Skip, you

helped build that self-awareness
in me at Stanford and this still
helping me in my life today."
Maybe this is what makes Ken
ney a legendary coach, distinguish
ing him from the many other great
coaches across the country. You
can count championships. But
there is no number that can ade
quately quantify the special rela
tionships that Kenney has built
with his athletes. He has influenced
the daily lives of hundreds of swim
mers long after they've left the
pool. Like with Messner, Kenney
has taught them life lessons that
are still significant decades later.
In a few months, there will be a
new head coach standing on deck
at the Avery Aquatic Center, writ
ing workouts and timing swim
mers as they log God-knows
how-many yards at 7 a.m. prac
tices. For the first time in 33 years,
that person won't be Coach Ken
ney anymore. While his impact on
the program and the swimmers
he's coached is here to stay, you
might just find Kenney himself
enjoying his retirement, cruising
down Route 66.

Senior Bradley Klahn (above) upset No. 4 Jarnere Jenkins of Virginia in the opening round of the NCAA Singles
Championships in Athens, Ga. Klahn is the only Cardinal player left in the tournament after fellow senior
Ryan Thacher fell, 6-3, 7-6 (5) in his first-round match against Gonzalo Escobar of Texas Tech.
Seven NCAA titles. 72 NCAA individ
ual champions. A 243-40 overall regular
season record. 31 consecutive Pac-10/Pac
-12 championships in one of the most com
petitive and talent-filled conferences in the
nation.
The list goes on.
Most collegiate swim programs have
never come close to reaching these record
breaking heights. These kinds of achieve
ments could take an elite program more
than a century to earn. But the Stanford
men's swimming and diving program has
amassed these prestigious accomplish
ments in just the past 33 years.
And all of it has come under the helm of
head coach Skip Kenney.
Last week, Kenney officially announced
his retirement after coaching the Cardinal
for 33 years.
"Thirty-three years, age 70 and an
Olympic year. Three pretty good reasons
for retiring," Kenney said. "The last couple
years were just a little more difficult, so it

was a good warning sign. Now my goal is to
drive Route 66. It's something that people
in my age group either have done or look
forward to doing. So that's my first goal."
Kenney ended his career as a three-time
Olympic Coach, six-time NCAA Coach of
the Year and 20-time Pac-10 Coach of the
Year. The coaching legend was also induct
ed into the International Swimming Hall of
Fame in 2004 and the American Swim
Coaches Hall of Fame shortly the following
year.
But for Kenney, his prestigious career
isn't mainly about the numbers or the acco
lades; it's about the swimmers he's coached
and the relationships that he's built with
them.
"It's been a heck of a run," Kenney said.
"My proudest accomplishment is helping
kids build team chemistry and teaching
them how to contribute. For a team to be
successful it takes a lot of good athletes and
a lot of good leadership from those ath
letes. I think it's hard for a 20-year-old to be
leader on a team because you're among
your peers. It takes someone a lot of confi
dence to handle that. And Stanford is just

an unbelievable place. The guys here made
it easy for me to come to morning practice
and to be enthusiastic about it."
The coach's close relationships with
many of his swimmers have gone far be
yond the pool and even far beyond Stan
ford.
"I have a real respect for [the swimmers
I've coached]," Kenney said. "I respect that
they're Stanford grads and successful in the
business world. They've carried their expe
riences as athletes into the real world."
Given Kenney's reputation as one of the
greatest swim coaches in the world, his
background in the sport is a bit surprising.
"I never swam competitively and I don't
know if I could've," Kenney said. "When I
first started coaching, I went to more clinics
and talks than anyone else. I think a lot of
swim coaches don't hear anything at these
things because they've already heard all of
it. But I was writing down things as fast as I
could and I learned a lot from them."
What Kenney lacked in personal swim
ming experience he made up for with his
other unique experiences that not many
coaches have. Kenney served in the

Marines and was in combat in Vietnam for
over a year, spending four months of his
time as a sniper.
"Leadership," Kenney said. "That's
what I learned from my experience [as a
Marine], In combat, you see things that
make you realize that the human body is
amazing. It can do amazing things if you let
it. That's what I've tried to apply to some of
the guys at Stanford. You can start out as a
walk-on, but end up an Olympian."
Kenney wasn't exactly handed a power
house when he took over in 1979. During
his first stint as head coach, Stanford went
3-6 in the regular season and could only
muster a sixth-place finish at Pac-10's.
"First year at Pac-10's, we didn't win a
single event," Kenney said. "So my goal for
the second year was to just win one event at
Pac-10's. And we won exactly one event. So
I said, 'Well, here we go.'"
That proved to be the only launching
point that the Cardinal needed. In the fol
lowing season, Kenney led the team to a
Pac-10 title along with a third-place finish

at NCAA. Under his steady guid
ance, Stanford would see a na
tional title three-peat twice , from
1984-1987 and 1991-1994. Kenney
won his final NCAA title in the
1997-1998 season, making him re
sponsible for seven of Stanford's
eight national titles.
Kenney will continue coaching
until the 2012 Olympic trials in
July, which means that he will still
hold his annual summer swim
camp for age-group swimmers. Of
the 32 swimmers on the Stanford
team, 31 will be competing at the
Trials, battling for an all-coveted
spot on the U.S. Olympic team.
Despite announcing his retire
ment just a couple months before
the trials, Kenney notes that his
swimmers are still very focused
on preparing for the big meet.
It might be best to understand
Kenney's extraordinary impact
on his swimmers by hearing a
swimmer's perspective. Kenney
shared with The Daily an email he
received from Adam Messner,

who swam for Stanford from
1997-2001 and captained the
team his senior year. Messner fin
ished his impressive collegiate ca
reer as a two-time national cham
pion in the 200 butterfly.
"Your motivational speech be
fore our 1998 NCAA win is some
thing I will always remember,"
wrote Messner. "You spoke about
how all the work was done, how
we needed to take the fight to
Auburn in their backyard. At the
meet and many others, I wanted
to swim through a brick wall for
the team and for you, because you
gave me the confidence that it had
to be done and more importantly,
that I could.
"At times, when I made selfish
or stupid decisions, you would set
me straight on how my decisions
might 'feel good' at the time, but
that the aftermath could affect
the team," Messner continued.
"That type of team-first mentality
is something that makes even
more sense now that I am a Dad
and a business owner. It's still
hard to live by, but I can more
clearly see that being selfish
works for a little while, but you'll
never feel truly fulfilled only
pleasing your self. Skip, you

helped build that self-awareness
in me at Stanford and this still
helping me in my life today."
Maybe this is what makes Ken
ney a legendary coach, distinguish
ing him from the many other great
coaches across the country. You
can count championships. But
there is no number that can ade
quately quantify the special rela
tionships that Kenney has built

team his senior year. Messner fin
ished his impressive collegiate ca
reer as a two-time national cham
pion in the 200 butterfly.
"Your motivational speech be
fore our 1998 NCAA win is some
thing I will always remember,"
wrote Messner. "You spoke about
how all the work was done, how
we needed to take the fight to
Auburn in their backyard. At the
meet and many others, I wanted
to swim through a brick wall for
the team and for you, because you
gave me the confidence that it had
to be done and more importantly,
that I could.
"At times, when I made selfish
or stupid decisions, you would set
me straight on how my decisions
might 'feel good' at the time, but
that the aftermath could affect
the team," Messner continued.
"That type of team-first mentality
is something that makes even
more sense now that I am a Dad
and a business owner. It's still
hard to live by, but I can more
clearly see that being selfish
works for a little while, but you'll
never feel truly fulfilled only
pleasing your self. Skip, you

helped build that self-awareness
in me at Stanford and this still
helping me in my life today."
Maybe this is what makes Ken
ney a legendary coach, distinguish
ing him from the many other great
coaches across the country. You
can count championships. But
there is no number that can ade
quately quantify the special rela
tionships that Kenney has built
with his athletes. He has influenced
the daily lives of hundreds of swim
mers long after they've left the
pool. Like with Messner, Kenney
has taught them life lessons that
are still significant decades later.
In a few months, there will be a
new head coach standing on deck
at the Avery Aquatic Center, writ
ing workouts and timing swim
mers as they log God-knows
how-many yards at 7 a.m. prac
tices. For the first time in 33 years,
that person won't be Coach Ken
ney anymore. While his impact on
the program and the swimmers
he's coached is here to stay, you
might just find Kenney himself
enjoying his retirement, cruising
down Route 66.
