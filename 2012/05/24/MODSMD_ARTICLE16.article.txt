# New Luck endowment a good sign
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
On Tuesday afternoon,
the Stanford football
program officially
jumped the shark.
How exactly did the
Cardinal leap from the land of the
normal to the realm of the ridicu
lous? Because on Tuesday, an anony
mous donor elected to endow the po
sition of offensive coordinator for
the Stanford football program and to
forever call the job "The Andrew
Luck Directorship of Offense."
Although all of Stanford's 85
football scholarships are endowed
(and therefore named after the peo
ple who endowed them), and David
Shaw is officially titled "The Brad
ford M. Freeman Director of Foot
ball," I was left scratching my head at
the new "Andrew Luck Directorship
of Offense." Frankly, I didn't know
what to think, other than "I guess it's
kind of nice to have something that
isn't named after Arrillaga on this
campus."
But I was left with one thought
that stood out above all the others:
This is the kind of move that only
happens at a football-mad program.
This stuff only happens at places like
SEC schools, where everything is
named after somebody. At places
that are monuments to college foot
ball, absurd tributes become normal.
For example, Oklahoma has bronze
sculptures of the Sooner players that
won the Heisman Trophy. Alabama
has its own bronze sculptures of
coaches that won national titles with
the Crimson Tide, Tim Tebow's
speech to the media ("You will never
see a team play harder than we will
the rest of the season. God Bless.")
after losing to Ole Miss in 2008 is al
ready immortalized on a plaque next
to the entrance to the Florida weight
room. But something like this is ut
terly bizarre for Stanford.
Naturally, Luck and company
said all the right things about the Di
rectorship, even though the endow
ment is, at best, peculiar. Really, who
on earth would choose to endow the
offensive coordinator position a
coach that certainly makes a couple
hundred thousand dollars a year
and name it after a player who hasn't
even graduated yet, no matter how
good he was?
