# New Luck endowment a good sign
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
On Tuesday afternoon,
the Stanford football
program officially
jumped the shark.
How exactly did the
Cardinal leap from the land of the
normal to the realm of the ridicu
lous? Because on Tuesday, an anony
mous donor elected to endow the po
sition of offensive coordinator for
the Stanford football program and to
forever call the job "The Andrew
Luck Directorship of Offense."
Although all of Stanford's 85
football scholarships are endowed
(and therefore named after the peo
ple who endowed them), and David
Shaw is officially titled "The Brad
ford M. Freeman Director of Foot
ball," I was left scratching my head at
the new "Andrew Luck Directorship
of Offense." Frankly, I didn't know
what to think, other than "I guess it's
kind of nice to have something that
isn't named after Arrillaga on this
campus."
But I was left with one thought
that stood out above all the others:
This is the kind of move that only
happens at a football-mad program.
This stuff only happens at places like
SEC schools, where everything is
named after somebody. At places
that are monuments to college foot
ball, absurd tributes become normal.
For example, Oklahoma has bronze
sculptures of the Sooner players that
won the Heisman Trophy. Alabama
has its own bronze sculptures of
coaches that won national titles with
the Crimson Tide, Tim Tebow's
speech to the media ("You will never
see a team play harder than we will
the rest of the season. God Bless.")
after losing to Ole Miss in 2008 is al
ready immortalized on a plaque next
to the entrance to the Florida weight
room. But something like this is ut
terly bizarre for Stanford.
Naturally, Luck and company
said all the right things about the Di
rectorship, even though the endow
ment is, at best, peculiar. Really, who
on earth would choose to endow the
offensive coordinator position a
coach that certainly makes a couple
hundred thousand dollars a year
and name it after a player who hasn't
even graduated yet, no matter how
good he was?
And yet, despite the craziness of
its all, I think this endowment says
promising things about Stanford
football, and particularly the fans of
Stanford football.
At those big football schools,
donors line up year after year to con
tribute in any way possible to the
continued success of the program,
and it's encouraging to see fans doing
that now. Just a few years ago, it was
hard to get people to show up for
games against top-15 opponents.
Now, they're packing the stands
(more than one sellout a year!) and
serving up lavish endowments. It's
exciting that fans are becoming en
gaged with the program in away like
never before.
However, this kind of crazed fan
hood isn't all good. For example,
sometimes these big donors/rabid
fans will go too far in exercising their
authority, like back in2ooB at Auburn
University. After the hated Alabama
Crimson Tide crushed the Tigers en
route to the 2009 Sugar Bowl, boost
ers called for the firing of head coach

Tommy Tuberville, who had com
piled an 85-40 career record with the
Tigers and taken Auburn to eight
straight bowl games. You read that
right an 85-40 record still wasn't
good enough to stop the boosters
from doing their best impersonation
of the Queen of Hearts from' Alice in
Wonderland."
That said, I don't ever envision
that happening on the Farm it
would truly shock me if Stanford
boosters demanded a coach be fired
after making eight straight bowl

games. Thankfully, Stanford is a
place with a little less ferocious per
spective than the citizens of football
crazed Alabama.
All in all, though, I think that this
"Andrew Luck Directorship of Of
fense" is a sign of good things to
come for the Stanford football team
and its fans. People are taking Stan
ford football seriously again (maybe
a little too seriously), and the pro
gram is reaping some benefits. I
know I'll be pleased if the University
maintains its commitment to having
a good football team well into the fu
ture because it's made my (rapidly
expiring) time here incredibly fun
and memorable.
So even though Stanford football
might be entering a wild new domain
of boosters pouring money into the
program, I'm not afraid of the conse
quences.
And who knows, maybe someday
I'll have enough money to endow a
position in my own name "The
Jack Blanchat Grand Czar of De
fense" does have a nice ring to it.

donors line up year after year to con
tribute in any way possible to the
continued success of the program,
and it's encouraging to see fans doing
that now. Just a few years ago, it was
hard to get people to show up for
games against top-15 opponents.
Now, they're packing the stands
(more than one sellout a year!) and
serving up lavish endowments. It's
exciting that fans are becoming en
gaged with the program in away like
never before.
However, this kind of crazed fan
hood isn't all good. For example,
sometimes these big donors/rabid
fans will go too far in exercising their
authority, like back in2ooB at Auburn
University. After the hated Alabama
Crimson Tide crushed the Tigers en
route to the 2009 Sugar Bowl, boost
ers called for the firing of head coach

Tommy Tuberville, who had com
piled an 85-40 career record with the
Tigers and taken Auburn to eight
straight bowl games. You read that
right an 85-40 record still wasn't
good enough to stop the boosters
from doing their best impersonation
of the Queen of Hearts from' Alice in
Wonderland."
That said, I don't ever envision
that happening on the Farm it
would truly shock me if Stanford
boosters demanded a coach be fired
after making eight straight bowl

games. Thankfully, Stanford is a
place with a little less ferocious per
spective than the citizens of football
crazed Alabama.
All in all, though, I think that this
"Andrew Luck Directorship of Of
fense" is a sign of good things to
come for the Stanford football team
and its fans. People are taking Stan
ford football seriously again (maybe
a little too seriously), and the pro
gram is reaping some benefits. I
know I'll be pleased if the University
maintains its commitment to having
a good football team well into the fu
ture because it's made my (rapidly
expiring) time here incredibly fun
and memorable.
So even though Stanford football
might be entering a wild new domain
of boosters pouring money into the
program, I'm not afraid of the conse
quences.
And who knows, maybe someday
I'll have enough money to endow a
position in my own name "The
Jack Blanchat Grand Czar of De
fense" does have a nice ring to it.

This is the kind
of thing that
only happens at
a football-mad
program.
On Tuesday afternoon,
the Stanford football
program officially
jumped the shark.
How exactly did the
Cardinal leap from the land of the
normal to the realm of the ridicu
lous? Because on Tuesday, an anony
mous donor elected to endow the po
sition of offensive coordinator for
the Stanford football program and to
forever call the job "The Andrew
Luck Directorship of Offense."
Although all of Stanford's 85
football scholarships are endowed
(and therefore named after the peo
ple who endowed them), and David
Shaw is officially titled "The Brad
ford M. Freeman Director of Foot
ball," I was left scratching my head at
the new "Andrew Luck Directorship
of Offense." Frankly, I didn't know
what to think, other than "I guess it's
kind of nice to have something that
isn't named after Arrillaga on this
campus."
But I was left with one thought
that stood out above all the others:
This is the kind of move that only
happens at a football-mad program.
This stuff only happens at places like
SEC schools, where everything is
named after somebody. At places
that are monuments to college foot
ball, absurd tributes become normal.
For example, Oklahoma has bronze
sculptures of the Sooner players that
won the Heisman Trophy. Alabama
has its own bronze sculptures of
coaches that won national titles with
the Crimson Tide, Tim Tebow's
speech to the media ("You will never
see a team play harder than we will
the rest of the season. God Bless.")
after losing to Ole Miss in 2008 is al
ready immortalized on a plaque next
to the entrance to the Florida weight
room. But something like this is ut
terly bizarre for Stanford.
Naturally, Luck and company
said all the right things about the Di
rectorship, even though the endow
ment is, at best, peculiar. Really, who
on earth would choose to endow the
offensive coordinator position a
coach that certainly makes a couple
hundred thousand dollars a year
and name it after a player who hasn't
even graduated yet, no matter how
good he was?
And yet, despite the craziness of
its all, I think this endowment says
promising things about Stanford
football, and particularly the fans of
Stanford football.
At those big football schools,
donors line up year after year to con
tribute in any way possible to the
continued success of the program,
and it's encouraging to see fans doing
that now. Just a few years ago, it was
hard to get people to show up for
