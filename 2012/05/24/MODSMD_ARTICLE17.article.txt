# Gibbs, Burdette advance
## 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
The NCAA singles tournament kicked off
with singles play yesterday in Athens, Ga., where
juniors Mallory Burdette and Stacey Tan and
sophomore Nicole Gibbs represented Stanford in
the first round. Burdette and Gibbs, both top-five
seeds, moved into the second round with easy
wins, while the unseeded Tan fell to Rice's Natal
ie Beazant.
Gibbs, who recently won the Pac-12 individual
title, is the tournament's No. 3 seed, and she con
tinued to display her dominant play of late with a
6-0, 6-2 victory over the No. 22 Emily Fraser of
Virginia on Wednesday. This may not be Gibbs'
last meeting with Fraser, though. Both women are
participating in the same half NCAA doubles
draw as well, which kicks off today. For now, Gibbs
will concentrate on her second round singles
match against either No. 59 Hanna Mar of Duke
or No. 21 Joanna Mather of Florida.
Burdette cruised through her match against
No. 120 Maria Craciun of South Carolina State,
defeating her 6-1,6-1.
"I played a really solid match today," Burdette
said. "I did a great job of making first serves and
returns as well as building points."

Burdette will now play Washington's Denise
Dy in the second round. Dy, seeded No. 22, defeat
ed No. 41 Marianne Jodoin of Fresno State, 6-4,7-
6 (3) in the first round. Burdette has played Dy be
fore and described her style of play as consistent.
"She is a very good defender and she will defi
nitely get a lot of balls back," Burdette said.
Tan wasn't able to capture a victory, instead
stumbling against the unseeded Beazant. Tan,
who earned an at-large bid to the tournament and
is ranked No. 25 nationally, lost 7-5, 6-2. It is
Beazant now who will face No. 4 Robin Anderson
of UCLA, who defeated No. 33 seed Courtney
Collins of Memphis, 6-3, 6-0, in her first round
matchup.
Though Tan's run at the singles title has ended,
she will appear tomorrow in the first round of
doubles with freshman Ellen Tsay. They will play
Kristy Frilling and Shannon Mathews of Notre
Dame. Gibbs and Burdette, the No. 2 doubles
team and Pac-12 runners-up, will begin their quest
for a title as well Thursday against Princeton's Hi
lary Bartlett and Lindsay Graff.
The action continues with the second round of
singles and first round of doubles today at the
Dan Magill Tennis Complex in Athens, Ga.
