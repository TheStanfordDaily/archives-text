# Turkish President talks leadership, innovation
## Gul emphasizes responsibilites and burdens of leadership 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
"Effective leaders must love to learn,
change and expand," said Abdullah Gul, presi
dent of Turkey, to a packed Cemex Auditorium
Wednesday afternoon. "If you are not learning,
maturing, changing or expanding, then you
cannot expect the people to believe in you and
follow you."
Gul's speech titled "Leading Change by
Reform, Commitment and Innovation: Reflec
tions on Leadership by the President of
Turkey" was part of the Graduate School of
Business's (GSB) "View from the Top" lecture
series, a student-run program that brings
prominent figures to campus to share their in

sights on effective leadership.
Prior to being elected president in 2007, Gul
served as Turkey's foreign minister from 2003
to 2007 and prime minister from 2002 to 2003.
He is a member of the Justice and Develop
ment Party in Turkey, a center-right party cur
rently holding a strong majority of seats within
Turkey's parliament.
"The next decade is likely one where Turkey
plays an increasingly important role bridging
economic, geopolitical, cultural boundaries,"
said GSB Dean Garth Saloner as he intro
duced Gul.
Gul focused his talk on leadership traits and
skills, which he applied to examples from his

Abdullah Gul, president of Turkey, spoke Wednesday afternoon in Cemex Auditorium
on leadership traits and skills. He also addressed the ascendancy of Turkey within the
Middle East and identified social media and technology as forces for the 21 st century.
own life ranging from his child
hood in the town of Kayseri to his
path to the presidency.
Kayseri is "renowned for its en
trepreneurs," according to Gul.
However, he recalled that when he
was a child, he failed to effectively
market and sell his grandfather's
sodas.
"If that very failure would not
have happened that day, most
probably I would not be the presi
dent of the Turkish Republic
today," Gul said.
"Of course, had I been success
ful in selling sodas, I would be
much richer now a lot like most
of my fellow Kayseri business
men," he added in jest.
Gul also discussed the eternal
question of whether leadership
ability is innate or acquired.
"Good leaders must, to be sure,
also possess God-given traits," Gul
asserted. "However, 1 believe, in
most cases, leadership is a nurtured
phenomenon rather than a gift of
nature."
Gul emphasized other key
leadership qualities in his talk, in
cluding the abilities to inspire, take
decisive steps, adapt to a rapidly
globalizing world and follow
through on a clear vision.
Gul lauded progress in advanc
ing democracy around the world
citing Egypt's Tahrir Square
protests and the Occupy move
ment â€” but criticized an alleged
lack of bold decision-making by
global leaders, particularly in Eu
rope and the Middle East.
"The current situation in Eu
rope is a telling example of how the
lack of visionary leadership could
adversely affect the lives of mil
lions," he said. "Another area
where we witnessed a tragic failure
of leadership is in the Middle East,
where leaders have long been out
of touch with their people."
Drawing a connection between
Stanford's culture of innovation
and ongoing regime change in the
Middle East, Gul highlighted the
importance of technology and so
cial media in popular movements.
"Because of your innovations,
no regime today has the luxury to
govern its people behind iron cur
tains," he said.
Gul also highlighted the need to
be a risk-taking leader, citing his
own visit to Armenia in September
2008 as an example of a time when
he took an unconventional ap
proach to the strained relations be
tween Turkey and its neighbor.
"Risky as it was, I did the right
thing by visiting Yerevan," Gul

said, denying any regrets about the
visit. "If it is necessary, a good
leader should also be able to make
difficult decisions and painful con
cessions."
Shifting his focus back to
Turkey, Gul emphasized how re
forms implemented at the turn of
the century have positively bene
fited Turkey both politically and
economically, emphasizing that
Turkey remains the second fastest
growing economy in the world be
hind China.
However, while Gul argued
that, "Turkey today is more plural
istic, inclusive and tolerant than
ever before," he conceded, "we are
under no such illusion that our task
in improving democracy is over."
In addition to democracy and
human rights, Gul emphasized
Turkey's continuing objective of
scientific and technological devel
opment, noting that Turkey has the
fourth largest number of Facebook
users globally.
"No nation, however self-suffi
cient or strong it may be, is capable
of coping with the complexities of
today's world alone," Gul said,
stressing the need for strong collec
tive, as well as individual, leader
ship.
Additionally, Gul emphasized
the need for a leader to simultane
ously adhere to his or her princi
ples while embracing reality and
opportunities. When presented,
however, with conflicting choices,
Gul emphasized, "my instinct al
ways goes with the principle, and I
will fight for principle to the end."
He ended his speech by impart
ing leadership advice to assembled
students.
"All I can leave with you today
is the strong but simple advice that
you never shy away from taking re
sponsibility and that you lead
when you can," he said. "Graduat
ing from Stanford, you will already
be equipped with the necessary
tools to succeed as leaders."
Gul's talk was followed by a
question and answer session mod
erated by former Secretary of
State and current Stanford fac
ulty member Condoleezza
Rice. Questions ranged from the
Syrian crisis to Turkey's rocky rela
tions with Israel following Israel's
2010 raid on a Gaza-bound aid ship
in which nine Turks died.
"The Turkish people are major
ity Muslim and are free to practice
what they believe," Gul said in re
sponse to a question from Rice on
the integration of Islam and
democracy. "That's why Turkey has
become a source of inspiration for
many countries in the Arab
world."
