## ASSU leaders discuss student influence Zimbroff advocates cooperative approach toward University 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Recently elected ASSU Presi
dent Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 said that
he believes the 2012-2013 ASSU rep
resentatives should adopt an ap
proach that is more cooperative and
less politicized than that of previous
representatives when interacting
with University administrators.
"Honesty and openness is a good
policy," Zimbroff said. "I don't think
that hiding your cards, or trying to be
overly political, is a function of stu
dent government."
"I think student government is
something different than politics,"
Zimbroff added. "You've got to un
derstand [that] there are ways to

make solutions mutually beneficial
or mutually productive rather than
distributive."
This contention was challenged,
however, by former ASSU Execu
tive Michael Cruz 'l2, who said that
while student representatives gener
ally preserve a cooperative relation
ship with the University, sometimes
senators and members of the Gradu
ate Student Council should adopt a
more adversarial approach.
"It's actually, in many times,more
beneficial to utilize the frame of an
adversarial role as opposed to a co
operative one ... because of the
constrained nature of working as a
Senator or as a member of the
[GSC]," Cruz said. "Most of your
change that can be implemented is
through the legislature, and legisla
tion, especially when presenting an
opinion, is naturally adversarial."
Shahryar Abbasi, external affairs

vice president of the Associated Stu
dents of the University of California
(ASUC), endorsed the adversarial
process of debate and said that at
Berkeley, partially due to its culture
of activism, students have extensive
influence on almost every adminis
trative decision.
"On no decision do we agree 100
percent," Abbasi said of the ASUC's
response to University policies. "We
critically think through everything,
and if there is too much agreement,
there is probably something wrong."
ASUC functions as an independ
ent 501(c)(3) corporation, receiving
no funding from the University, and
lobbies policy makers on both inter
nal and external affairs, according to
Abbasi and the ASUC's current and
past advocacy agendas.
