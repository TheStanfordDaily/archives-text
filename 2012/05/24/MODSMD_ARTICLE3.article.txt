# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## ASSU leaders discuss student influence Zimbroff advocates cooperative approach toward University 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Recently elected ASSU Presi
dent Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 said that
he believes the 2012-2013 ASSU rep
resentatives should adopt an ap
proach that is more cooperative and
less politicized than that of previous
representatives when interacting
with University administrators.
"Honesty and openness is a good
policy," Zimbroff said. "I don't think
that hiding your cards, or trying to be
overly political, is a function of stu
dent government."
"I think student government is
something different than politics,"
Zimbroff added. "You've got to un
derstand [that] there are ways to

make solutions mutually beneficial
or mutually productive rather than
distributive."
This contention was challenged,
however, by former ASSU Execu
tive Michael Cruz 'l2, who said that
while student representatives gener
ally preserve a cooperative relation
ship with the University, sometimes
senators and members of the Gradu
ate Student Council should adopt a
more adversarial approach.
"It's actually, in many times,more
beneficial to utilize the frame of an
adversarial role as opposed to a co
operative one ... because of the
constrained nature of working as a
Senator or as a member of the
[GSC]," Cruz said. "Most of your
change that can be implemented is
through the legislature, and legisla
tion, especially when presenting an
opinion, is naturally adversarial."
Shahryar Abbasi, external affairs

vice president of the Associated Stu
dents of the University of California
(ASUC), endorsed the adversarial
process of debate and said that at
Berkeley, partially due to its culture
of activism, students have extensive
influence on almost every adminis
trative decision.
"On no decision do we agree 100
percent," Abbasi said of the ASUC's
response to University policies. "We
critically think through everything,
and if there is too much agreement,
there is probably something wrong."
ASUC functions as an independ
ent 501(c)(3) corporation, receiving
no funding from the University, and
lobbies policy makers on both inter
nal and external affairs, according to
Abbasi and the ASUC's current and
past advocacy agendas.
Moreover, students serve on ad-
visory committees to every major
administrative or policy-making
body, and Abbasi said that the
University chancellor very rarely
disregards the students' advisory
opinions.
"The way the culture is [at
Berkley] is that you never say
no," he said. "The University will
try to take this power-wheedling
stance sometimes, and we just
don't accept it. It's very much a
push-back relationship."
"It's an amazing association,
and never before have I seen this
much regard for student opin
ion," Abbasid added. "The stu
dents are so involved in the deci
sion-making. When I've spoken
to my colleagues at other institu
tions, I would say it is unparal
leled."
The ASSU, with a mission to
" advocate [s] on behalf of Stan
ford students on issues such as
cost of living, diversity, student
life and student activities space,"
garners authority through its con
stitution, a contractual agreement
between the University, the
Board of Trustees, and the stu
dent body (the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University, of
which all students are members).
Additionally, it distributes annu
ally between $2 and $3 million of
independent funding from its en
dowment and student fees to stu
dent activities, according to Cruz.
The ASSU also theoretically
has jurisdiction over the Office of
Judicial Affairs (OJA), which
oversees all judicial procedure on
campus. It is ostensibly required
that the Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC), in addition to the Pres
ident of the University, approve
any amendment made to the Ju
dicial Charter before it can go
into effect.
However, the ASSU constitu
tion explicitly states that "nothing
in this Charter limits or contra
venes the authority of the Presi
dent ... to promulgate and en
force regulations governing stu
dent conduct," and that, "in ex
traordinary circumstances," he or
she may alter judicial procedure
without input or consent from the
Senate or GSC.
While Zimbroff expressed
confidence that the administra
tion and the student body gener
ally want the same things, Cruz
said that student advisors often
disagree with University officials,
particularly in areas such as in
vestment responsibility, where
Trustees oversee the investment
and management of endowment
securities.
Cruz said that he believes that
the influence of student voice is
vested predominately in the stu
dent appointments made by the
Nominations Committee to over
40 University committees every

year, similar to the structure of
student input at Berkeley. Cruz
said, however, that because of the
Nomination Commission's grad
ual loss of prestige and its discon
nect from the ASSU representa
tive bodies, the student body's
voice has been weakened.
"The role of sitting as a mem
ber of the Nominations Commis
sion is not one that is particularly
lauded on this campus, and there
by the accessibility metrics be
tween the elected bodies of the
association and thereby the
students and the Nominations
Commission tends to be
strained," he explained. "Linking
it more directly to students and
more directly to elected student
representatives greatly improves
the ability of students to feel like
they're having a say in the gover
nance of the University."
Cruz said that he feels these
problems would have been allevi
ated by the establishment of the
centralized Nominations Com
mission outlined in a revised con
stitution proposed at the end of
winter quarter by the Governing
Documents Commission (GDC),
which was chaired by Cruz and
ASSU Parliamentarian Alex
Kindel 'l4 and chartered last year
by the 13th Undergraduate Sen
ate.
Due to strong opposition from
Graduate Student Council mem
bers and ASSU alumni, however,
the drafted ASSU constitution
was not placed on the spring bal
lot in time for the student body to
approve its passage, despite sup
port from most current ASSU
representatives.
"The University's relationship
with students and student repre
sentation would greatly im
prove," Cruz said of the aimed
consequences of a new constitu
tion. "As it stands ... each of the
Nominations Commissions that
I've had the privilege to oversee
has faced significant hurtles in
filling all of the nominated posi
tions ... There would have been
mandated greater oversight over
these nominees, thereby ensuring
that student input is more direct
ly linked toward what nominees
are saying or voting on."

ally want the same things, Cruz
said that student advisors often
disagree with University officials,
particularly in areas such as in
vestment responsibility, where
Trustees oversee the investment
and management of endowment
securities.
Cruz said that he believes that
the influence of student voice is
vested predominately in the stu
dent appointments made by the
Nominations Committee to over
40 University committees every

year, similar to the structure of
student input at Berkeley. Cruz
said, however, that because of the
Nomination Commission's grad
ual loss of prestige and its discon
nect from the ASSU representa
tive bodies, the student body's
voice has been weakened.
"The role of sitting as a mem
ber of the Nominations Commis
sion is not one that is particularly
lauded on this campus, and there
by the accessibility metrics be
tween the elected bodies of the
association and thereby the
students and the Nominations
Commission tends to be
strained," he explained. "Linking
it more directly to students and
more directly to elected student
representatives greatly improves
the ability of students to feel like
they're having a say in the gover
nance of the University."
Cruz said that he feels these
problems would have been allevi
ated by the establishment of the
centralized Nominations Com
mission outlined in a revised con
stitution proposed at the end of
winter quarter by the Governing
Documents Commission (GDC),
which was chaired by Cruz and
ASSU Parliamentarian Alex
Kindel 'l4 and chartered last year
by the 13th Undergraduate Sen
ate.
Due to strong opposition from
Graduate Student Council mem
bers and ASSU alumni, however,
the drafted ASSU constitution
was not placed on the spring bal
lot in time for the student body to
approve its passage, despite sup
port from most current ASSU
representatives.
"The University's relationship
with students and student repre
sentation would greatly im
prove," Cruz said of the aimed
consequences of a new constitu
tion. "As it stands ... each of the
Nominations Commissions that
I've had the privilege to oversee
has faced significant hurtles in
filling all of the nominated posi
tions ... There would have been
mandated greater oversight over
these nominees, thereby ensuring
that student input is more direct
ly linked toward what nominees
are saying or voting on."

I think student
government is
something
different than
politics.
ROBBIE ZIMBROFF,
ASSU president
Recently elected ASSU Presi
dent Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 said that
he believes the 2012-2013 ASSU rep
resentatives should adopt an ap
proach that is more cooperative and
less politicized than that of previous
representatives when interacting
with University administrators.
"Honesty and openness is a good
policy," Zimbroff said. "I don't think
that hiding your cards, or trying to be
overly political, is a function of stu
dent government."
"I think student government is
something different than politics,"
Zimbroff added. "You've got to un
derstand [that] there are ways to

make solutions mutually beneficial
or mutually productive rather than
distributive."
This contention was challenged,
however, by former ASSU Execu
tive Michael Cruz 'l2, who said that
while student representatives gener
ally preserve a cooperative relation
ship with the University, sometimes
senators and members of the Gradu
ate Student Council should adopt a
more adversarial approach.
"It's actually, in many times,more
beneficial to utilize the frame of an
adversarial role as opposed to a co
operative one ... because of the
constrained nature of working as a
Senator or as a member of the
[GSC]," Cruz said. "Most of your
change that can be implemented is
through the legislature, and legisla
tion, especially when presenting an
opinion, is naturally adversarial."
Shahryar Abbasi, external affairs

vice president of the Associated Stu
dents of the University of California
(ASUC), endorsed the adversarial
process of debate and said that at
Berkeley, partially due to its culture
of activism, students have extensive
influence on almost every adminis
trative decision.
"On no decision do we agree 100
percent," Abbasi said of the ASUC's
response to University policies. "We
critically think through everything,
and if there is too much agreement,
there is probably something wrong."
ASUC functions as an independ
ent 501(c)(3) corporation, receiving
no funding from the University, and
lobbies policy makers on both inter
nal and external affairs, according to
Abbasi and the ASUC's current and
past advocacy agendas.
Moreover, students serve on ad-
visory committees to every major
administrative or policy-making
body, and Abbasi said that the
University chancellor very rarely
disregards the students' advisory
opinions.
"The way the culture is [at
Berkley] is that you never say
no," he said. "The University will
try to take this power-wheedling
stance sometimes, and we just
don't accept it. It's very much a
push-back relationship."
"It's an amazing association,
and never before have I seen this
much regard for student opin
ion," Abbasid added. "The stu
dents are so involved in the deci
sion-making. When I've spoken
to my colleagues at other institu
tions, I would say it is unparal
leled."
The ASSU, with a mission to
" advocate [s] on behalf of Stan
ford students on issues such as
cost of living, diversity, student
life and student activities space,"
garners authority through its con
stitution, a contractual agreement
between the University, the
Board of Trustees, and the stu
dent body (the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University, of
which all students are members).
Additionally, it distributes annu
ally between $2 and $3 million of
independent funding from its en
dowment and student fees to stu
dent activities, according to Cruz.
The ASSU also theoretically
has jurisdiction over the Office of
Judicial Affairs (OJA), which
oversees all judicial procedure on
campus. It is ostensibly required
that the Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC), in addition to the Pres
ident of the University, approve
any amendment made to the Ju
dicial Charter before it can go
into effect.
However, the ASSU constitu
tion explicitly states that "nothing
in this Charter limits or contra
venes the authority of the Presi
dent ... to promulgate and en
force regulations governing stu
dent conduct," and that, "in ex
traordinary circumstances," he or
she may alter judicial procedure
without input or consent from the
Senate or GSC.
While Zimbroff expressed
confidence that the administra
tion and the student body gener
ally want the same things, Cruz
said that student advisors often
