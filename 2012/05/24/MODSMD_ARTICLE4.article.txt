## Stanford team explores hypersonic flight theory 
### FELIX BOYEAUX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The possibility of hyperson
ic flight offering endless po
tential in air and space travel
but also posing numerous engi
neering challenges recently
became the domain of Stanford
engineers. The Stanford Predic
tive Science Academic Alliance
Program (PSAAP) received a
five-year $2O million grant from
the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) to investigate the sub

ject virtually.
The DOE awarded grants to
five universities interested in
researching and developing so
lutions to overarching prob
lems as varied as the hyperve
locity impact of metallic projec
tiles and the atmospheric re
entry of space capsules. The
Stanford team chose to tackle
the challenge of hypersonic
flight, which could potentially
result in speeds of up to 15

times the speed of sound.
"We considered many appli
cations for our predictive science
program before submitting our
final proposal," said Parviz Moin
M.S. '75 '7B Ph.D. '7B, professor
of mechanical engineering and
PSAAP faculty director. "We fi
nally settled with hypersonic
flight as we thought it would be a
project we would have fun with
and enjoy working on, and it was
a technological grand challenge."
The project also allows for
multidisciplinary cooperation
between the Computer Science,
Aeronautic and Astronautic En
gineering, Mechanical Engineer

ing and Mathematics depart
ments, as well as Stanford's Insti
tute for Computational and
Mathematical Engineering.
"An overarching problem like
this one is the best catalyst to
promote interdisciplinary re
search," Moin said. "Thanks to
the combined work of these de
partments, we have already
pushed and developed new nu
merical techniques, physical
models and computational plat
forms that are paving the way for
predictive science."
Stanford is at the cutting edge
of research in the discipline, ac
cording to Moin, having even pi
oneered a new science known as
uncertainty quantification.
"Uncertainty quantification
allows us to assess uncertainties
in our numerical solutions,"
Moin explained. "We can back

up our predictions with data
about the error bounds.This
might be the most important
topic in the future of computa
tional science."
Moin also highlighted the im
pact of the DOE grant on the
program's operations.
"We have essentially been
able to create a new mini nation
al laboratory," Moin said. "We
have a large cadre of postdoctor
al fellows and graduate students
who interact in away that has
never been seen before. It has
been a paradigm shift in the way
we do research."
The "large cadre" of faculty,
postdoctoral fellows and gradu
ate students is necessary to tackle
the challenges of hypersonic
flight, according to Moin.
"Nobody has been able to sus
tain hypersonic flight propulsion

for a longer amount of time,"
Moin said. "Most tests have
failed, and the few who succeeded
lasted for only a few seconds."
The problem, Moin said, is that
at hypersonic speed air flows into
the combustion chamber of a
scramjet engine at speeds up to
Mach 15. The time in which the
combustion has to occur is infini
tesimally short, and mastering
such a reaction is the main chal
lenge of the project.
"The equations are all well
known, but they are very hard to
solve," Moin said.
The team's extensive collabo
ration with the Computer Science
Department, and the use of some
of the world's fastest supercom
puters to model hypersonic flight,
is a direct consequence of the
equations' complexity.
"We are heading towards exas

cale computations, with more
than one quintillion flops [float
ing-point operations per second]
and one million cores running si
multaneously," Moin said, ex
plaining that the coding and han
dling of such supercomputers has
required extensive Computer Sci
ence involvement.
The breakthroughs the Stan
ford PSAAP team has already
made and anticipates making in
researching hypersonic flight are
likely to impact many other fields.
"We now know how to simu
late very complex flow dynam
ics," Moin said. "This very tech
nology can also be applied to au
tomobiles, wind turbines, new en
ergy conversion technologies and
in environmental science."

cations for our predictive science
program before submitting our
final proposal," said Parviz Moin
M.S. '75 '7B Ph.D. '7B, professor
of mechanical engineering and
PSAAP faculty director. "We fi
nally settled with hypersonic
flight as we thought it would be a
project we would have fun with
and enjoy working on, and it was
a technological grand challenge."
The project also allows for
multidisciplinary cooperation
between the Computer Science,
Aeronautic and Astronautic En
gineering, Mechanical Engineer

ing and Mathematics depart
ments, as well as Stanford's Insti
tute for Computational and
Mathematical Engineering.
"An overarching problem like
this one is the best catalyst to
promote interdisciplinary re
search," Moin said. "Thanks to
the combined work of these de
partments, we have already
pushed and developed new nu
merical techniques, physical
models and computational plat
forms that are paving the way for
predictive science."
Stanford is at the cutting edge
of research in the discipline, ac
cording to Moin, having even pi
oneered a new science known as
uncertainty quantification.
"Uncertainty quantification
allows us to assess uncertainties
in our numerical solutions,"
Moin explained. "We can back

up our predictions with data
about the error bounds.This
might be the most important
topic in the future of computa
tional science."
Moin also highlighted the im
pact of the DOE grant on the
program's operations.
"We have essentially been
able to create a new mini nation
al laboratory," Moin said. "We
have a large cadre of postdoctor
al fellows and graduate students
who interact in away that has
never been seen before. It has
been a paradigm shift in the way
we do research."
The "large cadre" of faculty,
postdoctoral fellows and gradu
ate students is necessary to tackle
the challenges of hypersonic
flight, according to Moin.
"Nobody has been able to sus
tain hypersonic flight propulsion

for a longer amount of time,"
Moin said. "Most tests have
failed, and the few who succeeded
lasted for only a few seconds."
The problem, Moin said, is that
at hypersonic speed air flows into
the combustion chamber of a
scramjet engine at speeds up to
Mach 15. The time in which the
combustion has to occur is infini
tesimally short, and mastering
such a reaction is the main chal
lenge of the project.
"The equations are all well
known, but they are very hard to
solve," Moin said.
The team's extensive collabo
ration with the Computer Science
Department, and the use of some
of the world's fastest supercom
puters to model hypersonic flight,
is a direct consequence of the
equations' complexity.
"We are heading towards exas

cale computations, with more
than one quintillion flops [float
ing-point operations per second]
and one million cores running si
multaneously," Moin said, ex
plaining that the coding and han
dling of such supercomputers has
required extensive Computer Sci
ence involvement.
The breakthroughs the Stan
ford PSAAP team has already
made and anticipates making in
researching hypersonic flight are
likely to impact many other fields.
"We now know how to simu
late very complex flow dynam
ics," Moin said. "This very tech
nology can also be applied to au
tomobiles, wind turbines, new en
ergy conversion technologies and
in environmental science."
