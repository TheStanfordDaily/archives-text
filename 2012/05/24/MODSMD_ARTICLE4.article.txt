## Stanford team explores hypersonic flight theory 
### FELIX BOYEAUX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The possibility of hyperson
ic flight offering endless po
tential in air and space travel
but also posing numerous engi
neering challenges recently
became the domain of Stanford
engineers. The Stanford Predic
tive Science Academic Alliance
Program (PSAAP) received a
five-year $2O million grant from
the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) to investigate the sub

ject virtually.
The DOE awarded grants to
five universities interested in
researching and developing so
lutions to overarching prob
lems as varied as the hyperve
locity impact of metallic projec
tiles and the atmospheric re
entry of space capsules. The
Stanford team chose to tackle
the challenge of hypersonic
flight, which could potentially
result in speeds of up to 15
