## Ingrassia links cars, US history Pulitzer Prize-winner sees automobiles as cause, effect of American experience 
### AARON SEKHRI STAFF WRITER 
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Paul In
grassia spoke to a packed audience Wednes
day evening at the Stanford Automotive In
novation Facility on the subject of his new
book, "Engines of Change," which provides
"a cultural history that explores how cars
have both propelled and reflected the Amer
ican experience."
The event was hosted by the Center for
Automotive Research at Stanford (CARS)
and the Revs Program, and featured Ingras
sia, deputy editor in chief of Reuters News, in
a casual and humorous discussion. R.B.
Brenner, a visiting communication lecturer
and fellow Pulitzer Prize winner, moderated
the event.
Throughout the discussion, Ingrassia
maintained that particular cars in American
history have either defined or have served as
apt reflections of the cultural Zeitgeist. From
the Model-T Ford to today's Toyota Prius, In
grassia argued that cars tell us a great deal
about ourselves and can even influence the
way we live and behave.
"Engines of Change" examines 15 quin
tessentially American vehicles in the context
of their time, assessing each on their influ
ence and place in history. Beginning with
the Model-T Ford, Ingrassia described how
the manufacturing practices established by
Henry Ford created the notion of mass man
ufacturing and essentially "ended the rural
peasantry."
He continued to describe how the 19205'
LaSalle, a General Motors creation, was a
harbinger of the "roaring '2os, a time of in
creasing wealth when cars meant more than
mobility they meant social mobility."
Ingrassia reviewed both the Cadillac and
the Corvette and discussed the
Volkswagen Beetle at length.
"I always find it funny that
Hitler's car became the hippie
icon," he remarked, referring to
the Volkswagen's troubled history.
Initially, the Beetle was sold in
America simply to bring hard cur
rency to German automakers' cof
fers, but "the combination of
breakthrough marketing practices
and a steady counter-culture
[movement] against excess and
conspicuous consumption pro
pelled the car in the American
market."
Ingrassia went on to claim half
in jest that the 1960 Chevy Corvair
"changed the outcome of the 2000
presidential election." Ingrassia
argued that Ralph Nader's excori
ating book "Unsafe at Any
Speed," which featured the Cor
vair heavily, contributed to
Nader's popularity and siphoned
off votes from A1 Gore in the nar
rowest of recent U.S. presidential
elections.
Ingrassia demonstrated links
between American history and
car design and production, most
memorably with a discussion of

fins on cars as indicative of the
growing influence of marketing
and a carefree post-war boom
mentality.
"The '7os were not a good
decade in America," Ingrassia
said. "We had oil shocks, a humili
ating loss in Vietnam, Watergate,
stagflation. Enter Honda, who, 30
years to this year, opened its first
factory in Ohio, marking a water
shed moment in American auto
motive industry, and brought glob
alization over here."
Ingrassia subsequently focused
on companies' efforts to tap into
different generations of drivers, ar
guing that certain vehicles arrived
at seminal moments that ensured
their success and place in automo
tive industry.
"Chrysler, with its minivans,
was able to tap into the baby
boomers when they had grown up,
cleaned up, taken a shower, gotten
serious, gotten jobs, gotten mar
ried and had children," Ingrassia
claimed.
The BMW by contrast defined
the notion of luxury for a genera
tion "of yuppies whose whole un
derstanding of luxury had shifted
from ornamental and ostentatious
to comfort," a sentiment to which
the German manufacturer, ac
cording to Ingrassia, obviously ap
pealed.
"Personal journeys and auto

motive journeys intertwine," he
said. "Think about it. We went
from hippie to yuppie and from
Beetle to Beamer. That tells you
something about us."
He went on to discuss the influ
ence of the pickup truck as politi
cal statement and the Toyota Prius
as an environmental one, repeat
edly pressing the point that cars
are salient representations of cul
ture.
Speaking to The Daily after the
event, Ingrassia framed the sub
ject as not "a uniquely American
story."
"There is something distinct
about cars here, the wide open
roads ... but this can be seen all
around the world," he said, recall
ing observing a similar passion
and thrill for cars in India on a re
cent trip.
With regards to the future of
cars, Ingrassia said he sees "au
tonomous cars as disruptive, in
the long term." He retains the be
lief, however, that "cars can be
practical or they can be for the
joy of driving them, which means
that different functions will
change the way we approach fu
ture cars."
And what does he drive? "A
red BMW," he said with a smile.
