## Researchers develop bionic eye implant 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at the School
of Medicine have invented a
light-powered retinal implant
or bionic eye that may
someday restore sight to
those blinded through certain
degenerative eye diseases.
According to a recent
study in the journal Nature
Photonics, the treatment,
which stimulates visual neu
rons with high resolution,
could restore sight for people
suffering from retinal pig
mentosa and age-related
macular degeneration, with
only minimal surgery.
The implant combines in
frared video-projection gog
gles with a small photovoltaic
chip implanted inside the
retina to replicate normal
eyesight. Images from a
miniature camera mounted
on the goggles are processed
and projected onto the gog
gles' screen, before laser puls
es of near-infrared light beam
the images to the chip's pho
toreceptors.
Researchers had to over
come the obstacle of deter
mining how to deliver a lot of
light without causing pain for
the user.
"If we used visible light, it

would be painfully bright,"
said Daniel Palanker, profes
sor of ophthalmology and the
study's senior author. "Near
infrared light isn't visible to
the naked eye, though it is vis
ible to the diodes that are im
planted as part of this pros
thetic system."
The research team initially
tested the photodiode arrays
on rat retinas in vitro, allow
ing the team to demonstrate
that the photodiodes could
convert visual images to elec
trical signals in a situation
similar to that induced by de
generative eye diseases.
Those signals would in turn
be transmitted to the brain
via retinal neurons.
"The photoreceptor cells
are dead and gone; all that is
left are the (light-insensitive)
signal processing neurons,"
wrote James Loudin Ph.D. 'll
PD. 'll, the study's co-first
author, in an email to The
Daily. "Without something
that electrically stimulates
them (which is our photodi
ode array), they will simply
not see any light of ANY fre
quency."
Loudin emphasized the
number of technological ob
stacles to developing the elec-
