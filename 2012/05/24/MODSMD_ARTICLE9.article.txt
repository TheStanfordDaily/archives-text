# Obama makes Bay Area fundraising trip
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marshall Watkins 
President Barack Obama ar
rived in the Bay Area Wednesday
for a two-day fundraising trip, dur
ing which he will hope to raise at
least $3 million in campaign dona
tions for the upcoming presiden
tial election, according to the Wall
Street Journal.
The president attended a
fundraiser Wednesday evening at a
private Atherton home. The
$35,800-a-plate dinner was attend
ed predominantly by Silicon Valley

executives, as well as some promi
nent figures from other industries,
such as actor Don Cheadle.
The President subsequently at
tended a larger event Wednesday
evening at Redwood City's Fox
Theatre, before continuing his
campaign schedule today in San
Jose. His trip marks the first time
that Obama has visited the Bay
Area since September, and may
according to an invitation for yes
terday's event "be his last visit
there this cycle."
Obama's trip comes amidst
concerns that Silicon Valley execu
tives have lost faith in his adminis
tration and have instead donated
heavily to Republican candidate
Mitt Romney. Obama has raised
$2.6 million from the technology
industry this election cycle, as op
posed to $3.5 million at this point
in 2008.
By contrast, Romney's experi
ence in venture capital appears to
have won over some technology
executives, a fundraising inroad he
will hope to reinforce with a West
Coast fundraising trip scheduled
for next week.
