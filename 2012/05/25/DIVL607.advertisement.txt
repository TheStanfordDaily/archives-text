When you smoke or breathe secondhand smoke, your heart works harder with
less oxygen, increasing your risk for cardiovascular diseases. Each year, more than 170,000
people die from smoking-related heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases
but you don't have to be one of them. Your heart's health is in your hands.
