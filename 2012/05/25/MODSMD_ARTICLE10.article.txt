## EDITORIAL Failure and accountability: NomCom and the future of the ASSU 
### 
One of the central func
tions of the ASSU is to act
as a liaison between the
student body and the administra
tion, a role exemplified by the ex
istence of the Nominations Com
mission, or NomCom. NomCom
is responsible for screening and
appointing 40 student represen
tatives to committees across cam
pus, including committees to the
Board of Trustees and Faculty
Senate. This critical function is
one of the primary mechanisms
through which student voices can
be heard in administrative con
versations about a variety of top
ics from academics to judicial af
fairs. Yet last week, it was re
vealed that a NomCom for the
2012-2013 school year had never
been assembled, and the ensuing
crisis offers a case study on the fu
ture of the ASSU: its failures, its
strengths and where it can go
from here.

ASSU because they perceive
many of its actions as self-serving,
disconnected and inefficient.
These claims may not be entirely
accurate indeed, the majority
of the ASSU is hard-working and
invested in the student body
but we do believe that they sum
marize the sources of student
frustration. Parliamentary proce
dure and the rules of debate are
undoubtedly important, but
when students see senators argu
ing over bylaws instead of pro
posing creative solutions to a
problem, the crisis of confidence
continues. Much of the problem
is one of perception. It may be
that in debating the substance of
the bylaws, ASSU senators are
actively tackling the problem at
hand. However, that's not some
thing that translates into the stu
dent body's consciousness.

Our advice to the 2012-2013
ASSU is threefold: Focus on tan
gible results, communicate those
results to your peers and most im
portantly, take responsibility for
your mistakes. The first two
pieces of advice are self-evident
in light of the NomCom contro
versy: Many students were
shocked to hear that NomCom,
which is traditionally assembled
in February or March, languished
until mid-May with a June dead
line looming.

Let us first pause and consider
the magnitude of the NomCom
problem, which spans multiple
generations of ASSU leadership.
A new NomCom was never re
cruited because of the assump
tion that a proposed revised con
stitution, which reformed the
NomCom process, would pass.
When it never went to ballot, this
assumption no longer held, and
yet an interim committee was
never established. The 14th
ASSU Senate debated their lim
ited options at a May 16 meeting
with the ultimate decision to re
vive the 2011-2012 NomCom in
order to fill 40 committee spots
reserved for students by June 1.
In discussing the NomCom
issue, we do not wish to point fin
gers at individual ASSU mem
bers or at the 14th Undergradu
ate Senate, which has only been
in office for a few weeks. Howev
er, we hope that in providing con
structive criticism over the Sen
ate's handling of the issue, we can
offer a perspective on how the
Senate and the ASSU as a whole
can restore their credibility with
the student body. Our central ar
gument is this: Students don't
care about parliamentary proce
dure, nuanced debate or a
Google Doc of meeting minutes.
They care about results, which in
the case of NomCom have ex
tremely high stakes.

The third piece of advice
admitting shortcomings is
the most important. With the
NomCom issue, it seemed that
every member of the ASSU with
a stake, past and present, was
scrambling to blame someone
else. On this issue we must be
emphatic: There is no shame in
failure, and the "pass the buck"
mentality that comes to the fore
whenever the Senate, Execu
tive, and GSC bicker is unac
ceptable. At every level of
ASSU involvement, there is a
great deal of conversation about
accountability and transparen
cy, and yet there are precious
few instances in which members
of the ASSU own up to their
mistakes and shortcomings.
Everyone has a stake in ASSU
action (or inaction). It's time for
ASSU representatives to put
egos aside and focus on results.
Their credibility in the eyes of
students, faculty and adminis
trators depends on it.

many of its actions as self-serving,
disconnected and inefficient.
These claims may not be entirely
accurate indeed, the majority
of the ASSU is hard-working and
invested in the student body
but we do believe that they sum
marize the sources of student
frustration. Parliamentary proce
dure and the rules of debate are
undoubtedly important, but
when students see senators argu
ing over bylaws instead of pro
posing creative solutions to a
problem, the crisis of confidence
continues. Much of the problem
is one of perception. It may be
that in debating the substance of
the bylaws, ASSU senators are
actively tackling the problem at
hand. However, that's not some
thing that translates into the stu
dent body's consciousness.

Our advice to the 2012-2013
ASSU is threefold: Focus on tan
gible results, communicate those
results to your peers and most im
portantly, take responsibility for
your mistakes. The first two
pieces of advice are self-evident
in light of the NomCom contro
versy: Many students were
shocked to hear that NomCom,
which is traditionally assembled
in February or March, languished
until mid-May with a June dead
line looming.

Let us first pause and consider
the magnitude of the NomCom
problem, which spans multiple
generations of ASSU leadership.
A new NomCom was never re
cruited because of the assump
tion that a proposed revised con
stitution, which reformed the
NomCom process, would pass.
When it never went to ballot, this
assumption no longer held, and
yet an interim committee was
never established. The 14th
ASSU Senate debated their lim
ited options at a May 16 meeting
with the ultimate decision to re
vive the 2011-2012 NomCom in
order to fill 40 committee spots
reserved for students by June 1.
In discussing the NomCom
issue, we do not wish to point fin
gers at individual ASSU mem
bers or at the 14th Undergradu
ate Senate, which has only been
in office for a few weeks. Howev
er, we hope that in providing con
structive criticism over the Sen
ate's handling of the issue, we can
offer a perspective on how the
Senate and the ASSU as a whole
can restore their credibility with
the student body. Our central ar
gument is this: Students don't
care about parliamentary proce
dure, nuanced debate or a
Google Doc of meeting minutes.
They care about results, which in
the case of NomCom have ex
tremely high stakes.

The third piece of advice
admitting shortcomings is
the most important. With the
NomCom issue, it seemed that
every member of the ASSU with
a stake, past and present, was
scrambling to blame someone
else. On this issue we must be
emphatic: There is no shame in
failure, and the "pass the buck"
mentality that comes to the fore
whenever the Senate, Execu
tive, and GSC bicker is unac
ceptable. At every level of
ASSU involvement, there is a
great deal of conversation about
accountability and transparen
cy, and yet there are precious
few instances in which members
of the ASSU own up to their
mistakes and shortcomings.
Everyone has a stake in ASSU
action (or inaction). It's time for
ASSU representatives to put
egos aside and focus on results.
Their credibility in the eyes of
students, faculty and adminis
trators depends on it.

One of the central func
tions of the ASSU is to act
as a liaison between the
student body and the administra
tion, a role exemplified by the ex
istence of the Nominations Com
mission, or NomCom. NomCom
is responsible for screening and
appointing 40 student represen
tatives to committees across cam
pus, including committees to the
Board of Trustees and Faculty
Senate. This critical function is
one of the primary mechanisms
through which student voices can
be heard in administrative con
versations about a variety of top
ics from academics to judicial af
fairs. Yet last week, it was re
vealed that a NomCom for the
2012-2013 school year had never
been assembled, and the ensuing
crisis offers a case study on the fu
ture of the ASSU: its failures, its
strengths and where it can go
from here.
