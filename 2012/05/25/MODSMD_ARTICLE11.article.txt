# EXISTENTIAL FORTUNE COOKIE
## Conflicting values 
### Sebastain Gould 
We are often presented
with what appears to be
conflict between individ
uals. People who claim to be non
partisan and unbiased will then
extol the virtues of finding some
middle ground between differ
ences. The problem, I think, is not
that there are people competing
to have their ideas succeed be
cause they believe that they are
right, but that each idea that con
tains its own motivation for com
petition. The value of that particu
lar idea must be weighed against
the myriad of other ideas that
exist around us.
Take, for example, the
Art after Dark festival that took
place in White Plaza. We as a stu
dent body generally value art, so
we're willing to pay student fees
to help support such events, and
when they are put on we go partic
ipate in them and view the art that
others have made. At the same
time, we value green grass, or at
least the University administra
tion does. In this case, the value
placed on green grass competed
with the value for an arts exhibit
in White Plaza and the art won

out; now the grass is dead. Of
course, eventually the grass will
be replaced, but what is important
to note is that a compromise was
made, and the quality of the grass
was sacrificed for a period of time
so that we could enjoy the art ex
hibit.
The same thing happens when
cars drive around campus. Stop
signs are put up to keep cars from
hitting other cars and pedestrians,
but at the same time, the low
speeds and frequent stops signifi
cantly decrease the fuel efficiency
of our cars. This creates a tension
between our desire for a healthy
planet with clean air and our de
sire to not get hit by automobiles.
What is especially interesting
about this is that these two values
exist entirely independently with
