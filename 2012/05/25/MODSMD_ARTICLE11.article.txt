# EXISTENTIAL FORTUNE COOKIE
## Conflicting values 
### Sebastain Gould 
We are often presented
with what appears to be
conflict between individ
uals. People who claim to be non
partisan and unbiased will then
extol the virtues of finding some
middle ground between differ
ences. The problem, I think, is not
that there are people competing
to have their ideas succeed be
cause they believe that they are
right, but that each idea that con
tains its own motivation for com
petition. The value of that particu
lar idea must be weighed against
the myriad of other ideas that
exist around us.
Take, for example, the
Art after Dark festival that took
place in White Plaza. We as a stu
dent body generally value art, so
we're willing to pay student fees
to help support such events, and
when they are put on we go partic
ipate in them and view the art that
others have made. At the same
time, we value green grass, or at
least the University administra
tion does. In this case, the value
placed on green grass competed
with the value for an arts exhibit
in White Plaza and the art won

out; now the grass is dead. Of
course, eventually the grass will
be replaced, but what is important
to note is that a compromise was
made, and the quality of the grass
was sacrificed for a period of time
so that we could enjoy the art ex
hibit.
The same thing happens when
cars drive around campus. Stop
signs are put up to keep cars from
hitting other cars and pedestrians,
but at the same time, the low
speeds and frequent stops signifi
cantly decrease the fuel efficiency
of our cars. This creates a tension
between our desire for a healthy
planet with clean air and our de
sire to not get hit by automobiles.
What is especially interesting
about this is that these two values
exist entirely independently with

in individual minds.

Still, if you were to ask an indi
vidual if they would prefer to
have an increased likelihood of
being hit by a car or if they want
ed cars to have decreased gas
mileage, I think everyone would
answer that they care less about
the environment than their own
personal safety. This of course is
not supposed to condemn any
one who does care about the en
vironment; I simply want to
point out that there lies a great
deal of tension and contradiction
within individuals when it comes
to the realization of goals, as they
are often in competition with
other unrelated goals that an in
dividual has.

Of course, I would like to help
offer a solution to this problem,
but I do not think it will be as easy
as one would hope. What I would
like to propose is that you consid
er your values differently. Why is
it that you want some law to be
passed? Your justification for
valuing one option in life more
than another might be just that
you feel it is a better choice, but I
urge you to think hard about why
you choose what you do.

Sometimes, there is some
unique solution to the problem
that allows you to enjoy both of

your competing values through
some sort of compromise. This
may be as simple as being more
conservative with resource use;
taking shorter showers, for exam
ple, allows you to be both clean
and cut down on water waste. You
could also try creating new tech
nologies that enable even greater
achievements, coupling old
processes with new ideas to make
medical surgeries less invasive or
building products that make tan
gible improvements in people's
lives. If you do have to choose be
tween two different things that
you highly value, just try not to do
something you'll regret!

the solution were easy? Email Se

There is tension
within individuals
when it comes to
the realization of
their goals.
