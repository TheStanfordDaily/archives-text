## The 						dread of what's ahead 
### Miriam Marks 
/ / o, what are you doing
year?" It's the
Vj question that strikes
fear into the heart of every gradu
ating student. Well, not necessari
ly. But it's probably the most fre
quent question directed towards
soon-to-be grads, and not every
one is thrilled to hear it.

There are generally three
kinds of responses after this ques
tion is asked.

First are the people who know
what they're doing. Some of them
know it so well that they don't
even have to be asked. You inno
cently say something like "Are
you excited for graduation?" And
in return you get, "It's a little bit
tersweet, but next year I'm con
sulting at McKinsey!"
Even when actually prompted,
the answer comes confidently,
comfortably, often excitedly.
After all, the people who know
what they're doing have few wor
ries. Some of them signed their

contract months earlier, and
they're genuinely eager to begin
working at a new place.
But this category is reserved
for a certain kind of future em
ployment: jobs at places that peo
ple know about. There are the
names like Microsoft, Google and
Facebook for CS kids and JP Mor
gan and Goldman Sachs for the fi
nance-inclined. The political sci
ence-types head off to the White
House, the State Department and
various three-letter organiza
tions. If you're predictably uncon
ventional, you do a start-up. And
for every major, there's Teach for
America.

Then there's more school,
which includes scholarships like
the Rhodes, Marshall and Ful
bright. Or maybe you're heading
off to another university for a law,
business or doctoral degree. Med

Its the question
that strikes fear
into the heart of
every graduating
student.

school? That sounds good too. All
of these things are logical next
steps after Stanford because, like
Stanford, they're recognizable,
big names.

So when, as a graduating stu
dent from Stanford, your next
destination also has an impres
sive title, your response will be
pretty well received. And you'll
speak out with gusto because,
well, it's gratifying to elicit a few
"oohs" and "ahhs" from people
when you tell them what you're
doing after graduation. "Wow,
you're working at Apple!" or
"Congratulations on the Peace
Corps!"

The next category is those
people who have a job lined up,
but it's not the most recognizable.
They're working at a smaller
company that hasn't quite caught
the public eye yet.
"Hey, what're you doing next

"I'm working at [insert name
of company no one's heard of ex
cept its 15 employees]!"
"Oh ... right. What does [in
sert name of company] do?" The
other person may already be los
ing interest, but they have to stick
it out at this point. You respond,
and they nod knowingly and try
ing to look excited for you. But
because they still have no clue
what this company (nonprofit) is
or what it really does, this excite
ment can only go so far.
And so you find that these stu
dents are a little less outspoken
about their future careers. If they
know that a simple "What're you
doing next year?" will require a
lengthy explanation, they won't
say anything unless asked. Having
to describe your future job, and
subtly justify why it's worth your
time and interest takes energy.

It also comes with some judg
ment. When someone hasn't

heard of the place you're going to
work at, you risk getting that
vaguely disappointed look, the
look that silently says, "Why isn't
this Stanford grad working at
someplace I've heard of?"

Then there are those who still
don't know what they're doing
next year. Maybe they've had a
few rejections from their top
choices, or maybe their job
search process started a bit late.
For them, the repetitions of "So
what're you doing next year?"
become more and more painful
each time.
Want to make their lives easi
er? When someone answers the
question with, "I actually don't
know yet," there's no need to
gasp in shock. There's also no
need to flood the person with a
series of job recommendations
and pieces of "advice." And they
won't feel better if you say some
thing like, "Oh! Don't worry, I
know a whole bunch of grads
who didn't have a job until
months after graduation! You'll
find something."

No, that's not comforting or
helpful. If you really want to help,
actually offer to help. Ask about
their interests and try to connect
them to a promising opportunity.
Is that more than you wanted to
do? Then there's no need to dwell
on the topic. The student in ques
tion won't mind if their looming
unemployment isn't the subject
of conversation.

And as for students: If your
future is still undetermined, you
can always spice up your answer
to the question. Say that you'll
be taking some time off to travel
(to your home). Or that you're
going to take a few months to
finish your book (after you start
it). Or that you're going to found
your own company (a job-seek
ing service for yourself). The
questioner will get the point, and
hopefully they'll move on.

because they still have no clue
what this company (nonprofit) is
or what it really does, this excite
ment can only go so far.
And so you find that these stu
dents are a little less outspoken
about their future careers. If they
know that a simple "What're you
doing next year?" will require a
lengthy explanation, they won't
say anything unless asked. Having
to describe your future job, and
subtly justify why it's worth your
time and interest takes energy.

It also comes with some judg
ment. When someone hasn't

heard of the place you're going to
work at, you risk getting that
vaguely disappointed look, the
look that silently says, "Why isn't
this Stanford grad working at
someplace I've heard of?"

Then there are those who still
don't know what they're doing
next year. Maybe they've had a
few rejections from their top
choices, or maybe their job
search process started a bit late.
For them, the repetitions of "So
what're you doing next year?"
become more and more painful
each time.
Want to make their lives easi
er? When someone answers the
question with, "I actually don't
know yet," there's no need to
gasp in shock. There's also no
need to flood the person with a
series of job recommendations
and pieces of "advice." And they
won't feel better if you say some
thing like, "Oh! Don't worry, I
know a whole bunch of grads
who didn't have a job until
months after graduation! You'll
find something."

No, that's not comforting or
helpful. If you really want to help,
actually offer to help. Ask about
their interests and try to connect
them to a promising opportunity.
Is that more than you wanted to
do? Then there's no need to dwell
on the topic. The student in ques
tion won't mind if their looming
unemployment isn't the subject
of conversation.

And as for students: If your
future is still undetermined, you
can always spice up your answer
to the question. Say that you'll
be taking some time off to travel
(to your home). Or that you're
going to take a few months to
finish your book (after you start
it). Or that you're going to found
your own company (a job-seek
ing service for yourself). The
questioner will get the point, and
hopefully they'll move on.

/ / o, what are you doing
year?" It's the
Vj question that strikes
fear into the heart of every gradu
ating student. Well, not necessari
ly. But it's probably the most fre
quent question directed towards
soon-to-be grads, and not every
one is thrilled to hear it.

There are generally three
kinds of responses after this ques
tion is asked.

First are the people who know
what they're doing. Some of them
know it so well that they don't
even have to be asked. You inno
cently say something like "Are
you excited for graduation?" And
in return you get, "It's a little bit
tersweet, but next year I'm con
sulting at McKinsey!"
Even when actually prompted,
the answer comes confidently,
comfortably, often excitedly.
After all, the people who know
what they're doing have few wor
ries. Some of them signed their

contract months earlier, and
they're genuinely eager to begin
working at a new place.
But this category is reserved
for a certain kind of future em
ployment: jobs at places that peo
ple know about. There are the
names like Microsoft, Google and
Facebook for CS kids and JP Mor
gan and Goldman Sachs for the fi
nance-inclined. The political sci
ence-types head off to the White
House, the State Department and
various three-letter organiza
tions. If you're predictably uncon
ventional, you do a start-up. And
for every major, there's Teach for
America.

Then there's more school,
which includes scholarships like
the Rhodes, Marshall and Ful
bright. Or maybe you're heading
off to another university for a law,
business or doctoral degree. Med

Its the question
that strikes fear
into the heart of
every graduating
student.

school? That sounds good too. All
of these things are logical next
steps after Stanford because, like
Stanford, they're recognizable,
big names.

So when, as a graduating stu
dent from Stanford, your next
destination also has an impres
sive title, your response will be
pretty well received. And you'll
speak out with gusto because,
well, it's gratifying to elicit a few
"oohs" and "ahhs" from people
when you tell them what you're
doing after graduation. "Wow,
you're working at Apple!" or
"Congratulations on the Peace
Corps!"

The next category is those
people who have a job lined up,
but it's not the most recognizable.
They're working at a smaller
company that hasn't quite caught
the public eye yet.
"Hey, what're you doing next

"I'm working at [insert name
of company no one's heard of ex
cept its 15 employees]!"
"Oh ... right. What does [in
sert name of company] do?" The
other person may already be los
ing interest, but they have to stick
it out at this point. You respond,
and they nod knowingly and try
ing to look excited for you. But
because they still have no clue
what this company (nonprofit) is
or what it really does, this excite
