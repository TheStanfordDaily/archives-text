## The dread of what's ahead
### Miriam Marks 
/ / o, what are you doing
year?" It's the
Vj question that strikes
fear into the heart of every gradu
ating student. Well, not necessari
ly. But it's probably the most fre
quent question directed towards
soon-to-be grads, and not every
one is thrilled to hear it.

There are generally three
kinds of responses after this ques
tion is asked.

First are the people who know
what they're doing. Some of them
know it so well that they don't
even have to be asked. You inno
cently say something like "Are
you excited for graduation?" And
in return you get, "It's a little bit
tersweet, but next year I'm con
sulting at McKinsey!"
Even when actually prompted,
the answer comes confidently,
comfortably, often excitedly.
After all, the people who know
what they're doing have few wor
ries. Some of them signed their

contract months earlier, and
they're genuinely eager to begin
working at a new place.
But this category is reserved
for a certain kind of future em
ployment: jobs at places that peo
ple know about. There are the
names like Microsoft, Google and
Facebook for CS kids and JP Mor
gan and Goldman Sachs for the fi
nance-inclined. The political sci
ence-types head off to the White
House, the State Department and
various three-letter organiza
tions. If you're predictably uncon
ventional, you do a start-up. And
for every major, there's Teach for
America.

Then there's more school,
which includes scholarships like
the Rhodes, Marshall and Ful
bright. Or maybe you're heading
off to another university for a law,
business or doctoral degree. Med

Its the question
that strikes fear
into the heart of
every graduating
student.
