## THE
						BIG FINALE 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
One of the closest Pac-12 baseball races in
recent memory has come down to its final
weekend, and No. 11 Stanford is currently on
the outside looking in when it comes to win
ning the conference or hosting a Super Re
gional.

That could change in a hurry for the Cardi
nal (37-14,17-10 Pac-12) if everything goes its
way this weekend, as Stanford hosts unranked
Cal (27-24,10-17) with just two games separat
ing the top five teams in the Pac-12 and only
their respective rivalry series remaining. The
last time that even three squads at the top of
the conference finished within two games was
in 2004, when Stanford won its last Pac-10 title
in a close finish over Washington and UCLA.
"We're aware of the standings but at the
same time we know that all we can do is go up
and win games," said first baseman Brian Ra
gira, whose .330 batting average is third-best
on the squad. "We'll let things fall where they
will."

This time around. No. 9 Oregon is in the dri
ver's seat to win its first conference champi
onship since the Ducks reinstated their base
ball program in 2008-09 following a 28-year
hiatus. They can clinch at least a share of the

title with a series win over Oregon State, but
the No. 20 Beavers are no pushovers, having al
ready beaten Oregon once this season.
No. 13 Arizona is only a game behind the
Ducks at 18-9, but it must face a top-tier oppo
nent as well in 17-10 Arizona State, which is
unranked in the Coaches Poll due to NCAA
sanctions but still ranked as high as 16th by
some publications.

Also at 17-10 is No. 10 UCLA, which has
perhaps the easiest series of the bunch this
weekend.The Bruins will play at home against
lOth-place USC, which has lost eight of its last
nine in Pac-12 play.
Rounding out the group is Stanford, which
will ride an eight-game winning streak into its
series with the Golden Bears. With a sweep,
the Cardinal would likely finish in second
place in the conference, which could bring a
Super Regional to Sunken Diamond if the
squad can stay alive long enough in the post
season.

Unless Oregon gets swept for the first time
this season, winning just twice would, at best,
put Stanford in a three-way tie for second.
With UCLA likely to have a strong showing as
well, the Cardinal would have a hard time dis
tinguishing itself to the selection committee if
it finishes below 20 Pac-12 wins.

Thus, a sweep is imperative for Stanford for

the third straight weekend.
"It always is [a must-win] once the postsea
son comes around," Ragira said. "It was pretty
similar last year."

The Cardinal did win three of its last four
games of the 2010 season, including two victo
ries at Berkeley. And given its results playing
under pressure over the last two weeks, the
squad has a good shot at filling that tall order.
Two 3-0 weekends against eighth-place
Washington State and conference doormat
Utah weren't entirely unexpected, but they
helped revitalize a Stanford lineup that lost
three of four to Oregon State and San Jose
State, never scoring more than five runs in the
process. Since its May 6 loss to the Beavers, the
Cardinal has dipped below the five-run mark
only once.
Additionally, Stanford's starting pitchers
combined for a 1.40 ERA and struck out dou
ble-digits on three separate occasions in those
two series. Redshirt junior lefthander Brett
Mooneyham (6-4) has returned to form with
two straight wins, while junior utilityman
Stephen Piscotty recently named a finalist
for the John Olerud Award, given to the best
two-way player in college baseball has
emerged as a reliable starter to round out the

Sophomore second baseman Brett Michael Doran (above) and the No. 11 Stanford men's baseball crew will close out the regular season by
hosting unranked Cal starting tonight. A sweep over its cross-Bay rivals could reward the Cardinal with the chance to host a Super Regional.
