# Pac-12:The strongest of them all
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
The Pac-12 has hardly
been getting off Scott
free. Conference Com
missioner Larry Scott
earned $1.9 million in
2010, USA Today reported
Wednesday, making him the high
est-paid commish in the nation just
months after he took the position.
By comparison, Thomas Hansen,
who headed the Pac-10 from 1983-
2009, made less than $600,000 in his
last full year on the job.
Though it's no surprise that the
Pac-12's pockets have been getting
progressively deeper in this era of
big-money college sports, it's excit
ing that the conference is doing so
much better financially than its
major counterparts. Its 12-year, $3
billion TV deal with Fox and ESPN
shattered records and has begun to
inspire other conferences' similarly
lucrative agreements, though none
have yet eclipsed the Pac-12's.
Having lived my entire life in the
Bay Area, I'm no fan of the East
Coast bias. But I'm a huge fan of
blaming absolutely everything on
the short-sightedness of our friends
to the east, and when it comes to the
conference pecking order, East
Coast bias is clouding their under
standing of something we are all
very aware of: The Pac-12 is the
most powerful league in college
sports.

First of all, we have a practical
monopoly over the world's biggest
hotbed of sporting growth: Califor
nia. In college, California has pro
duced indisputably the three most
successful programs in NCAA his
tory. UCLA's 108 NCAA team
championships, Stanford's 103 and
USC's 94 are miles ahead of the
take of the next-best Division I pro
gram, Oklahoma State (50).
But the Pac-12 is no stranger to
uncharted territory. We started the
whole conference realignment
shindig that is still rocking the
NCAA two years later. Big Ten fans
will point out that their conference
started the realignment rumors in
early 2010, but while they were busy
doing all the talking the Pac-10 ig
nited the powder keg by adding
Colorado on June 10, one day be
fore Nebraska announced its move
to the Big Ten.
And what's more, the Sports
Business Journal nominated both
Scott and the Pac-12 for its executive
and league of the year, respectively,
making them the only college-level
nominees in each category.
Nobody cares about the big pic
ture, you might quip. It's all about
the biggest teams in the biggest
sports around: football and men's
basketball.
I can't detract from the SEC's
six straight football titles. But on the
other hand, the Pac-12 gets to send
a team to the Rose Bowl the
biggest event in college athletics
on a nearly annual basis. We
haven't done that seven times, or

even 70; no fewer than 92 Pac-12
schools have been in Pasadena for
New Year's.

The ACC may seem to have a
claim to men's basketball, with
perennial powerhouses Duke and
North Carolina. But the Pac-12 has
actually won more national titles
(15) in the sport than any other con
ference, even the ACC (12). And
even though the conference has hit
a rough patch on the hardwood
over the last couple of years, given
the storied history of programs like
UCLA, you can't expect those dif
ficulties to stick around for long.

When it comes to the so-called
"Olympic sports," the Pac-12 is
dominant. League members have

already won eight national titles
this year, and the conference has
several major contenders in base
ball and softball (though neither is
actually played at the Olympics
anymore).
So is the Pac-12 paying Larry
Scott ridiculous amounts of
money? Without question. But it
has been getting quite a lot of bang
for its buck, and before long even
those from the East Coast will have
a hard time denying its superiority.

Joseph Bey da is bracing himself for
an earful from sports fans in the
Southeast and East Coast. Give
