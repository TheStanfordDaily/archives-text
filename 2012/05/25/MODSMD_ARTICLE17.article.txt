# KLAHN ON TO SWEET SIXTEEN
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team, now com
peting in the singles and doubles portion of
the NCAA championships, had a successful
day on Thursday, with Bradley Klahn advanc
ing into the Sweet 16 of the singles tourna
ment and the duo of Klahn and fellow senior
Ryan Thacher winning their first round dou
bles matchup.
Klahn, playing the day after his impressive,
straight-set upset victory over No. 4-seed
Jarmere Jenkins, continued his stellar play by
knocking off No. 27 Remi Boutillier of Fresno
State 6-1,6-1. Klahn rolled right from the get-go
on Thursday, dominating Boutillier and cruis
ing to an easy victory. Boutillier has been a fa
miliar opponent for Klahn as Stanford and
Fresno State have squared off in each of
Klahn's four seasons with the Cardinal.

Thursday's victory was a continuation of
the extremely strong play that Klahn has ex
hibited since returning from an injury that
had cost him much of the first half of his sen
ior season. True to the form that Cardinal fans
have come to expect of Klahn during his Stan
ford career, he has elevated the quality of his
play for the postseason, having lost just twice
in his last 15 singles matches. Both of those
losses came at the hands of No. 1 Steve John
son of USC.

Seeded No. 4 in the doubles portion of the
NCAAs, Klahn and Thacher gritted through a
tough two-set victory in their opening round
match. Against Niall Fitzgerald and Casey
Watt of Notre Dame, the Cardinal pair consis
tently came up more clutch than their Irish
counterparts in the match's most critical situa
tions, eventually closing out a 6-4,7-6(2) victory.
